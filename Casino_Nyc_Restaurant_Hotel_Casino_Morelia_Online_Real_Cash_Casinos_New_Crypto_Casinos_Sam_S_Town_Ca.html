<p>The 2023 All-Star Game will feature some of the best basketball players in the world. We say “some” because not all the best players are going to play on Sunday. Some players, including Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, and Zion Williamson are going to miss the All-Star game due to injuries.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there will still be plenty of starpower in Utah. But which team will win? Captained by LeBron James, the Western Conference team is seen as the betting favorite. The Eastern Conference team, whose captain is Giannis Antetokounmpo, however, is ready to prove bookies wrong.</p>

<p>Team LeBron to Miss Two Important Players</p>
<p>The Western Conference All-Star team is captained by LeBron James (Los Angeles Lakers), who was supposed to start the game along with Nikola Jokic (Denver Nuggets), Luka Doncic (Dallas Mavericks), Stephen Curry (Golden State Warriors), and Zion Williamson (New Orleans Pelicans).</p>
<p>Unfortunately for them, Curry and Williamson are out with injuries, which is why they’re going to be replaced by Ja Morant (Memphis Grizzlies) and Lauri Markkanen (Utah Jazz).</p>
<p>Even without the two superstars, Western Conference Team is still incredibly strong. After all, with James, Doncic, and Jokic, these guys look capable of winning the All-Star Game. Each of those three is playing fantastic basketball lately.</p>
<p>For instance, James has recently broken the NBA record for most career points. Further, Doncic is killing it for Dallas, which has shortened his MVP odds. Speaking of which, the winner of the previous two MVP awards, Jokic, is also playing incredible basketball since the start of 2023.</p>
<p>Team Giannis Motivated to Do Great on Sunday</p>
<p>Giannis Antetokounmpo has been sensational this season, but even the Greek Freak can’t win the All-Star Game on his own. He will need the help of his teammates if he’s going to cause an upset. The bad news is that Kevin Durant (Phoenix Suns) will have to miss this game. His replacement in the starting lineup is Joel Embiid (Philadelphia 76ers).</p>
<p>In addition to Giannis and Embiid, Donovan Mitchell (Cleveland Cavaliers), Jayson Tatum (Boston Celtics), and Kyrie Irving (ex-Brooklyn Nets) will be in the starting lineup. Although these guys just aren’t as great as those playing for LeBron’s team, they do have the motivation to showcase their talent.</p>
<p>2023 All-Star Game Prediction</p>
<p>Player-for-player, Team LeBron is way stronger than Team Giannis. The problem, however, is that this is an exhibition event, meaning that superstars might not be willing to give their utmost to win. This is why we think the underdogs might upset the odds. If they win, they’re going to put an end to Team LeBron’s dominance that started back in 2018.</p>
<p>Picks: Team Giannis to win</p>
