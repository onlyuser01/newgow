    <h1>Casino Buffalo Ny Wind Creek Casino Wetumpka Casino Free Games Slots Black Lotus Casino American Onl</h1>

<p>Dear GURU!</p>
<p>The purpose of my appeal is to help in the return of the commission that was improperly collected when withdrawing funds from the 1xbet casino.</p>
<p>On October 11, I received incomplete withdrawal amounts from 1xbet casino to my Neteller payment wallet. The casino withheld $ 280.</p>
<p>On October 13th, I informed 1xbet that as a result of two withdrawals, I had lost 280 USD.</p>
<p>I received a reply from 1xbet that "in special cases, compensation of payment systems commissions may be canceled for some gaming accounts of bettors". I was not able to get any comments from the casino on the existence of violations on my part and information on the "special case".</p>
<p>I contacted Neteller (this payment system was used for the deposit and withdrawal of funds) to receive information on the collection of the commission. According to their answer, Neteller did not charge a commission for processing my payments (I am ready to provide a screenshot of the answer). Also, the 1xbet website in the "Payments" section indicates that no commission is charged when depositing and withdrawing funds through the Neteller payment system. And since this information is publicly available, I have the right to regard it as a public offer.</p>
<p>Thus, the indication of 1xbet that they charged me a commission due to the compensation of commissions of payment systems is not true. I believe that 1xbet is misleading me. I will provide screenshots of my correspondence with 1xbet when you indicate to which address they can be sent.</p>
<p>I would like to ask you to help us get a commission refund of $ 280.</p>
