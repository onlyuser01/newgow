<p>Symplify, a Stockholm-based customer relationship management (CRM) and AI cloud solutions company, has launched a new US subsidiary to capitalize on the local market. The new entity will be called Symplify US and will be led by Stephen Crystal as president.</p>
<p>Symplify US Welcomes Crystal as President</p>
<p>Symplify is a company that is dedicated to powering the retail and iGaming casino sectors. As a developer of CRM solutions, the firm seeks to help operators connect with their customers, monitor their activity and prevent gambling-related harm. The company’s products are highly customizable and allow partners to be in charge of their data.</p>
<p>Symplify prides itself on being able to put all its ideas into practice and provide its clients with robust CRM ecosystems that help them drive engagement and boost customer conversion and retention.</p>
<p>By doubling down on its efforts in the US, Symplify will be able to capitalize on the opportunities in its exceptional market. The US-facing arm will have Stephen Crystal as its president. Crystal will, meanwhile, continue his tenure as chief executive of SCCG Management.</p>
<p>Crystal spoke on the opportunity to head Symplify US. He lauded Symplify’s CRM and AI-based solutions as “industry firsts” and said that the firm has weaponized AI and turned it into a great tool for operators across North America. The company’s mission now is to help these solutions reach more operators.</p>
<p>Kimber Is Excited about the New US Arm</p>
<p>Robert Kimber, chief executive of Symplify, called the new US operation the “next and natural step” of Symplify’s evolution. He noted that his firm seeks to establish a permanent foothold in the US and become a leader when it comes to CRM solutions.</p>
<p>The gaming market in the US is becoming home away from home for Symplify technology. We meet like-minded innovators who need a platform that understands the marriage of traditional casino entertainment and the expectation of the newly transitioned digital user. Robert Kimber, CEO, Symplify</p>
<p>Kimber added that the pairing of Symplify’s iGaming expertise with SCCG’s experience with brick-and-mortar casinos is already proving to be a resounding success. Because of that, Kimber is looking forward to expanding in the US and establishing a local base headed by Crystal. Symplify’s CEO said that he considers Crystal a great friend and colleague and is sure that he will be able to deliver results.</p>
<p>Symplify is a company with over two decades in iGaming. The company turned AI into something more than a fad and now powers operators in many key markets with AI-based solutions. The company currently has offices in the USA, Canada, Malta, Italy, Spain, Denmark and Hong Kong.</p>
