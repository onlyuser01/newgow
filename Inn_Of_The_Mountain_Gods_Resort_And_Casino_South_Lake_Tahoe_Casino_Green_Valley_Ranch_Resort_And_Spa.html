<p>EveryMatrix is excited to launch in yet another fast-growing market and supply local operators with proprietary and aggregated content</p>
<p>EveryMatrix, a leading business-to-business iGaming platform provider, announced that its SlotMatrix RGS casino content has been successfully certified in Bulgaria. As a result, the supplier will be able to offer both in-house and third-party games to operators in this fast-growing market.</p>
<p>Having secured approval to launch games in Bulgaria, EveryMatrix will be able to unleash slots from its proprietary Armadillo and Spearhead studios in the local market. Local customers will therefore get to experience some of the best games the provider has to offer. This will notably include titles such as John Daly Spin It and Win It, Hot Hot Honey, Sweet Gems and Mythological Mayhem, among others.</p>
<p>Existing EveryMatrix clients that hold licenses in Bulgaria, such as Kaizen, will launch the games in question on their platforms. The supplier’s aggregation partners will also make games from Armadillo and Spearhead studios available to local casino companies.</p>
<p>In addition, EveryMatrix will be able to leverage its SlotMatrix B2B aggregation division to offer relevant game content to operators in Bulgaria. The solution offers seamless integration, enabling instant revenue and a game offering boost.</p>
<p>As a result, SlotMatrix partners can not only get games from Armadillo Studios and Spearhead Studios but from a variety of third-party companies as well.</p>
<p>The Launch Is Important for EveryMatrix</p>
<p>The launch in Bulgaria is an important development for EveryMatrix, considering the rapid growth of the local betting market. H2 Gambling Capital predicts that Bulgaria’s regulated gambling and betting market will record a total gross win of $459.2 million in 2023.</p>
<p>Razvan Haiduc, EveryMatrix’s CEO of games, commented on the launch in Bulgaria, saying that the opportunity to serve a new fast-growing market is a very encouraging development for the company.</p>
<p>To gain access to another fast-growing market is very encouraging and enables SlotMatrix to distribute both our own and best-performing third-party studio content to new and existing operators and suppliers and their audiences. Razvan Haiduc, CEO of games, EveryMatrix</p>
<p>EveryMatrix, which is committed to delivering content to both established and emerging brands, continues to grow and expand. The company currently has 700 employees across ten countries, serving more than 200 clients in Europe, the US and beyond.</p>
<p>The company is a member of the World Lottery Association, European Lotteries Association, and iDEA Growth in the US.</p>
