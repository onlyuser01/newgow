<p>Liverpool vs. Newcastle is the first Premier League game of 2024. It’s played on Monday, January 1, at Anfield, with a live broadcast on USA Network</p>
<p>Liverpool needs to win this game to stay in the race for the No. 1 spot in the Premier League. The Reds have been in great form even though their recent schedule has been somewhat tough.</p>
<p>It’s almost the opposite when it comes to Newcastle. The Magpies had a relatively easy fixture list in December, but they ended up losing to some real underdogs like Luton and Nottingham Forest.</p>
<p>Liverpool vs. Newcastle Odds</p>
<p>Moneyline Odds Liverpool -210 Draw +390 Newcastle +550</p>

<p>Liverpool Going for Another Win at Anfield</p>
<p>Jurgen Klopp’s team is 12-6-1 right now, with a 7-2-0 record at home. What’s interesting is that those two draws happened in their last two games at Anfield. This, however, doesn’t mean their form has dipped in any way. On the contrary, they’ve been playing very well.</p>
<p>The reason why they didn’t win those two games is that they played against two really tough opponents – Manchester United and Arsenal.</p>
<p>Speaking of how great the Reds have been on home turf, we also need to mention that the last time they lost a Premier League game at Anfield was in October 2022.</p>
<p>Will Newcastle’s Poor Form Continue in 2024</p>
<p>Newcastle is 9-2-8 overall in the Premier League, but the Magpies are in horrible form lately. They lost four of their last five games in the league, with their most recent defeat happening to Nottingham Forest at home. Before that, they lost to Luton.</p>
<p>We did see them beat Fulham 3-0 at home, but before that, they suffered two losses – to Tottenham and Everton, each time on the road.</p>
<p>These guys obviously don’t do great in away matches. In fact, they’re 7-2-0 in Newcastle, while their record on the road is 1-2-6. What this practically means is that just 17.24% of the points they won in the 2023-24 Premier League season, they won away from home.</p>
<p>Liverpool vs. Newcastle Prediction</p>
<p>Liverpool is one of the best home teams in the Premier League; Newcastle is one of the worst visitors. These facts tell the whole story about the Liverpool vs. Newcastle game on 2024 New Year’s Day. The hosts are going to win, we have little doubt about that.</p>
<p>But will they score three or more goals? We’re not so sure about that. The visitors from Newcastle are likely to defend with all they’ve got, so staying away from the over/under betting market is our advice.</p>
<p>Pick: Liverpool</p>
