    <h1>Funclub Casino No Deposit Bonus Hard Rock Hotel Casino Bristol Casino In Canada Tropicana Atlantic C</h1>

<p>Ludwig Ahgren is one of the most recognizable names when it comes to video game streaming. The professional recently held a big poker tournament for gaming celebrities. As an afterthought, Ludwig shared that he doesn’t really enjoy gambling.</p>
<p>Ludwig’s Tournament Was a Sight to See</p>
<p>The tournament Ludwig held had a whopping $1 million prize pool and featured some major names in gaming. The event welcomed celebrities such as Alexandra Botez, Jimmy “MrBeast” Donaldson, Tyler “Ninja” Blevins and Felix “xQc” Lengyel among others. Phil Hellmuth, a professional poker player, was also present at the event.</p>
<p>Ludwig streamed the poker clash on his official YouTube channel on May 2, allowing fans of the celebrities to watch the action live. In the end, Botez grabbed first place with $456,900 in winnings. MrBeast was just behind her with $438,900, followed by Ludwig in third place with $404,700.</p>
<p>This isn’t the first time Ludwig has played poker with his streamer friends. In September, the Internet celebrity streamed another live game against MrBeast. In the end, Ludwig lost the game and gave $50,000 to his friend.</p>
<p>Ludwig Reveals He Isn’t Fond of Gambling</p>
<p>In the latest episode of The Yard, a podcast series, the streamer shared that gambling isn’t exactly his thing. When the other hosts mentioned going to Las Vegas to gamble, Ludwig said that he doesn’t like to play that much.</p>
<p>The gamer said that one of the reasons is that he is not very good at playing gambling games. Most of the time, he would lose the money he bet which would infuriate him. Furthermore, he would often bet a lot on a single hand, which is a bad habit that tends to cost him a lot.</p>
<p>I’m over it. I really don’t enjoy it. I didn’t enjoy it, it wasn’t fun losing the money and I’m a bad gambler. Ludwig Ahgren</p>
<p>Despite Ludwig’s criticism of his own playstyle, Hellmuth was impressed by the streamer and lauded his composure. The elite player thanked Ludwig for organizing the game and praised him for “handling his ups and downs like a true pro.”</p>
<p>Ludwig Ahgren was cool as the other side of the pillow! He organized the game, he played great poker, he won big, and he handled his ups and downs like a true pro (unlike me!). GG Ludwig Phil Hellmuth</p>
<p>Gambling streams are one of the most controversial topics in the world of professional gaming. Many love them but others blame Twitch and YouTube for promoting gambling harm.</p>
