    <h1>Gold Country Casino Red Mile Casino Poker Casino Near Me Ameristar Casino Black Hawk Co First Counci</h1>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>1) I have accumulated my winnings WITHOUT any active bonus. I have NEVER activated or used BONUS on my account.</p>
<p>You can peacefully verify it from the screenshots I send you from which you see that it is entirely PERSONAL payments (1 page of the attachment).</p>
<p>2) NO, in the past my account has never been verified as I had opened it that evening there.</p>
<p>3) I have never requested the WITHDRAWAL because they disabled it IMMEDIATELY. In the first 24 hours you can't really withdraw by setting the site, and after the first 24 hours I went to withdraw but everything was blocked. I asked for an explanation. Nobody understood why. After many hours (and many reminders of mine) they asked me to verify my account. Immediately, on 02.12.2020, I sent ALL the documentation (credit card, document, selfie, photo with the chat, etc.). No reply. The regulation says they have 3 to 14 days to check but that's crazy. I begged them, pleaded with them, sent emails, attachments, retransmitted attachments but nothing.</p>
<p>Nobody minds me.</p>
<p>They have to check 4 attachments, ie 4 PDF files and they take 14 days. It is shameful. It's just a way to not pay.</p>
