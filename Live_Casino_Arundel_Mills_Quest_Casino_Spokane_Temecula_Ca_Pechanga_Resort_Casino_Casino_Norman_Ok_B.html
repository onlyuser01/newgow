<p>The Casino Guru Awards is interested in projects that are both finished and ongoing, small and big, gauging the potential of each candidate’s initiative and how it can improve the industry for the better when it comes to social responsibility, problem gambling, transparency, communicating with consumers, and more.</p>
<p>Casino Guru will weigh in on each category with the help of no fewer than 20 external judges who are respected authorities in the field of responsible gambling, social responsibility, and general gambling operations. All of the panel experts are accomplished individuals in their fields, and they will hold applicants to some of the industry’s highest standards.</p>
<p>Casino Guru will also bring a number of internal judges, among whom Head of Content Maros Gasparik and Sustainable &amp; Safer Gambling Lead Simon Vincze who have become authorities in the field of responsible gambling over the last few years. Each of the candidates will be judged objectively and based on merit only, with the best operators, companies, and professionals distinguished during the February online ceremony.</p>
