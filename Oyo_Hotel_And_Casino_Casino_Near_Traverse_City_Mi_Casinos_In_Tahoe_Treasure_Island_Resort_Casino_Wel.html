<p>About NextGen Gaming games</p>
<p>NextGen has an interesting history. Formed in Australia in 1999, it set out to create land-based casino games, but quickly found that the online market had huge potential. As part of parent company Next Generation Entertainment, it grew inside the Australia market and became one of the country's dominant game providers.</p>
<p>In 2011, NextGen merged with Swedish company NYX Gaming, a move that gave the company a foothold in Europe and widened its game selection to over 300 titles. Going from one strength to another, it accepted a huge offer of $630 million from gaming giant Scientific Games (SG) in 2017, becoming SG Digital, the new interactive division, in the process. For this reason, you'll find the SG logo appears when you load up a NextGen game in one of the many casinos with NextGen games.</p>
<p>Any NextGen or SG game that you play is bound to strict gaming regulations, so you can be sure you get a fair deal when you play. The Malta Gaming Authority, with its respected reputation in the iGaming industry, is one of the licences the company holds.</p>
<p>Today, SG is regarded as one of the top gaming companies in the world with enormous resources, so don't be surprised to see many new games powered by NextGen's mechanics coming your way.</p>
<p>Nextgen slots and casino games</p>
<p>NextGen's range of games is impressive, an output that has been helped by their integration with SG. You'll find them among thousands of others on SGI's Open Gaming System software (OGS) that gives players access to thousands of titles.</p>
<p>A running theme through the NextGen slots collection is magic and luck, and you'll find leprechauns, pots of gold and wizards scattered across many of its titles. Emerald Isle is an example, with its quaint Irish theme and nice bonus games. The game is very nice to look at and gets exciting if you pick up one of its features: the Free Games bonus gives you up to 20 free spins with trebled wins, while the other lets you choose treasure chests that offer up to 500x your stake. Merlin's Millions and Irish Eyes are similarly themed games.</p>
<p>You'll also see many NextGen slots with animal themes, ranging from foxes to gorillas, and even the famous mystical ape-man Bigfoot. Big Foot has a basic but colorful design, taking you on a hunt of the elusive creature. If you get three Bigfoot footprint symbols then you'll activate the bonus game, where you select any pair of eyes in the forest to win a prize. A winning combo of five symbols on the reels can also land you a nice, big cash win. Other titles in this genre are Gorilla Go Wild, Mad Mad Monkey and Foxin Wins, as NextGen look to inject a little fun into their slot games.</p>
<p>If slots aren't your thing, then NextGen also has several classic casino games including blackjack and roulette. Double Zero Roulette and Blackjack Pro offer the usual bright visuals and straightforward gameplay that NextGen are known for.</p>
