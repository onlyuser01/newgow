<p>SPRIBE, the innovative business-to-business supplier for the iGaming industry, has secured an important milestone by entering the Portuguese gambling landscape, obtaining the necessary permit, and preparing itself to take off with its award-winning and player-favorite Aviator title, Casino Guru News learned in an email press release.</p>
<p>Aviator is one of the most ambitious projects by SPRIBE and has been one of the most ambitious games in the crash genre. Released in 2019, Aviator has been one of the most-played games the industry has seen. A total of 160,000 bets are being placed every single minute of the game, based on SPRIBEâ€™s own data with more than 10m monthly active users.</p>
<p>The game is also particularly successful with Generation Z and Millennialgenerations, which means that it appeals to a fairly young crowd in the industry, making it even more important for companies that are looking to strengthen their foothold in regulated markets and want to attract an active and engaged customer base.</p>
<p>Although not all developers reveal data about their titles specifically, Aviator has been truly one of the most outstanding cross-border titles to captivate the million-strong audience. The game focuses on social interaction by allowing players to chat with each other as they play, but also letting them compete in a leaderboard.</p>
<p>This crash game is also tested by BMM Test Labs, which further guarantees that Aviator is a worthwhile crash game that produces fair and honest results. Players are welcome to explore the new title as part of the Portuguese iGaming landscape moving forward, although SPRIBE has announced no immediate plans to team up with any specific brand just yet.</p>
<p>SPRIBE CCO Giorgi Tsutskiridze welcomed the opportunity and said: "We are on a mission to launch Aviator in all regulated markets across the world so being given the green light to enter Portugal is a major moment for us."</p>
<p>He said that operators in Portugal would now have the chance to add Aviator and offer brand-new experiences in their game lobbies for the very first time, with locals being amongst the 10m players who enjoy Aviator every month.</p>
<p>SPRIBE has been popularizing its Aviator game far and wide, with the title certainly grabbing quite a few operator eyeballs in its time. The supplier launched the successful title in Italy with SKS365 and it has also inspired many others to follow in the crash game genre and seek out their own games.</p>
