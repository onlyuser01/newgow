<p>Intertops Poker (now rebranded as Everygame Poker) is an expansive online poker site in the United States that caters to a vibrant community of aspiring players. The website has been online since 1996 and has helped advance online poker as part of the Horizon Poker Network. Today, the card room hosts hundreds of players together with the other flagship poker site on the network, Juicy Stakes Poker.</p>
<p>Our Intertops Poker review had a look at what Intertops Poker has to offer to players in the United States. The website runs a generous $1,000 welcome bonus matched at 200%, offers 36% rakeback like its sister brand, and gives US players the quality experience they have all asked for as online poker aficionados.</p>
<p>The website holds a Curacao license, has a vibrant community of 300-something players on average, and runs an extensive selection of cash games and quite a few poker tournaments.</p>
<p>Welcome Bonus &amp; Intertops Bonus Code</p>
<p>Intertops Poker is geared towards the needs of the community. The website runs decent poker promotions, including the $1,000 welcome bonus matched by 200% on your first deposit. The bonus offers extra 25 free casino spins, you may use if you decide.</p>
<p>To claim the bonus, all you need to do is make the minimum deposit, which is $25. You will also have to use the 1000ITP Intertops Poker bonus code to release funds in your account. Once you do, you will have 3 months to make your funds eligible for withdrawal.</p>
<p>The bonus is released as you accumulate Frequent Player Points (FPPs) which you amass at a rate of $1 Rake = 1 FPP and $1 Tournament Fee = 7 FPP. To release $1 of bonus funds, you need to have 83.335 FPP. Here is a specific breakdown of how you earn FPPs based on the game you participate in:</p>
<p>Game Type FPP Earned Poker Ring Games 1 FPP – $1 Raked Poker Tournaments 7 FPP – $1 Tourney Fees Casino Slot 3 FPP – $100 Wagered Casino Video Poker 8 FPP – $100 Wagered Casino Blackjack 1 FPP – $100 Wagered Casino Hold’em 3.5 FPP – $100 Wagered Let It Ride 5 FPP – $100 Wagered Caribbean Stud 5 FPP – $100 Wagered</p>
<p>Even if you are a modest player with no particularly big ambitions, you will still have no reason to worry about cashing out your money with Intertops, as the rate of release and deadline is very comfortable.</p>
<p>Intertops No Deposit Bonus</p>
<p>As part of the Horizon Network, the Intertops Poker no deposit bonus is again part of the same offer where you purchase Gold Chips (GC) and play as a sort of Sweep Stakes model. The way this bonus work is you buy GC’s and then send an email to [email protected] asking for your GC’s to be exchanged for a bonus. Your email subject should read ‘Gold Chips $x Bonus’.</p>
<p>The ‘x’ indicates what bonus amount you are looking to secure. This bonus is definitely not a traditional no deposit bonus, so it can definitely be a little confusing at first. To purchase GC’s, you can do so at the following rate:</p>
<p>$5 for 20 Gold Chips</p>
<p>$25 for 100 Gold Chips</p>
<p>$100 for 400 Gold Chips</p>
<p>It’s good to note that there is a way to secure a real no deposit bonus by using the Gold Chips you convert from FPPs. For every 100 FPPs you have, you will receive 1 Gold Chip. Once you have enough, you can claim the no deposit bonus.</p>
<p>Intertops Poker Reload Bonus</p>
<p>If you are looking to reload your bankroll you can do so by claiming an additional bonus. The reload bonuses, however, are only available via email and are granted at the behest of the casino. You will need to go to ‘Newsletter Subscriptions’ and check the box that says ‘Poker E-Mails’ to activate the promotions that are disbursed by the casino at random intervals.</p>
<p>Intertops Poker Software &amp; Games</p>
<p>Intertops Poker offers both instant play and a dedicated download client. You can use both to play from a number of devices, including Mac, desktop PCs, Android, and iOS devices. Players will have no trouble navigating both the download and mobile lobby and enjoy the same pace and quality of play regardless of the gaming environment they have chosen.</p>
<p>The software operates smoothly and allows you to navigate through the lobbies with ease. In terms of specific games, Intertops Poker has a whole lot to offer. There are multiple versions of poker to try first hand, including Texas Hold’em and Omaha.</p>
<p>As to specific poker variations, players will get to enjoy Fixed Limit, Pot Limit, and No Limit games. The table limits will vary from $0.0 to $0.04 and $10/$20 for most No-Limit Texas Hold’em games. Meanwhile, Pot Limit Texas Hold’em starts at around $0.02/$0.04 and goes all the way up to $50/$100.</p>
<p>Last but not least you have Pot Limit Omaha $0.02/$0.04 and all the way up to $10/$20. Most of the gameplay will focus on low-stake games, where the risk is lower.</p>
<p>With the growth of the network to some 400 cash players recently, though, the low stake games have become more dynamic, offering more in the way of action. Players who are looking to grind their way from the grounds up will definitely appreciate Intertops Poker for the opportunity.</p>
<p>Intertops Poker Tournaments</p>
<p>Tournaments are a big part of the Intertops Poker offer. You will find a variety of options, most of which are focused on Sit &amp; Go and Multi-Table layout, but there are some big showdowns that take place from time to time.</p>
<p>The majority of events pivots around $250-$1,000 as the fixed prize, but Intertops Poker often runs a variety of other events, such as the Plan 9 from Outer Space or its famed Summit Series.</p>
<p>Each tournament has a unique Intertops ID making it easy to track, but more importantly, the events have their buy-in and GTD prize pool displayed. Once again, Intertops caters to low-stake players, with the events starting from as little as $50 GTD with some exceptions pushing this number to over $2,500.</p>
<p>Intertops Poker Deposit and Withdrawals</p>
<p>Intertops Poker has some of the most extensive banking options. They are a combination of FIAT payment methods, such as credit cards, bank wires, e-wallets and cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>Deposits</p>
<p>Presently, you can deposit using some 13-odd banking methods. They include:</p>
<p>Bank cards: Visa, MasterCard</p>
<p>Cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin</p>
<p>E-wallets: Neteller, Skrill, Sofort, ecoPayz</p>
<p>Bank transfers</p>
<p>Prepaid vouchers: Paysafecard</p>
<p>Others: Money Global, Cash Direct</p>
<p>The majority of these payment methods will require a minimum deposit of $25. The maximum amount you can deposit will vary from $1,000 to $5,000, with a few exceptions here and there.</p>
<p>All deposit methods have a 100% success rate. There are no fees for the majority of payment methods, but if you are making a Bank Wire transfer, some fees may apply based on your bank.</p>
<p>Withdrawals</p>
<p>Withdrawals are always a little trickier with most websites you play at. Intertops Poker has made sure to list all available payment methods, the minimum, and maximum amounts, as well as the processing time.</p>
<p>Players can use Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to request withdrawals worth between $100 and $2,500 every week. The processing time usually takes 48 hours. A check is worth between $150 and $3,000 once a week and takes up to 5 business days to process.</p>
<p>Bank Wire Transfer is only available once per week and can take 10-15 business days to process. Most players avoid transferring via bank, although others, who aren’t in a hurry, don’t mind waiting a bit at all.</p>
<p>Neteller, Skrill, and ecoPayz seem to be the most flexible banking methods as they offer between $25 and $2,500 in cashouts, and come with free withdrawals twice a month. It takes up to 48 hours to process a cash-out request involving any of the payment methods.</p>
<p>You should be aware that some of the methods listed on the page may not be immediately available based on your current location. However, most US players should have no trouble accessing any of the payment methods.</p>
<p>Intertops Poker Customer Support</p>
<p>Intertops Poker has state-of-the-art customer support. You will be able to get in touch without any issue at all, whether you prefer to live chat or via email at [email protected]. If you have an issue with your payments, use the dedicated [email protected] instead.</p>
<p>Players can also use the Intertops Poker contact number directly and call at 1-800-819-0919 if they prefer. Customer support is available 24/7 so don’t hesitate to get in touch.</p>
<p>Is Intertops Poker Rigged?</p>
<p>Intertops Poker has established itself as a trusted operator of poker games. The website is licensed by Curacao and maintains a reputation for trustworthiness. The card room is systematically developing new products and launching new tournaments to keep people entertained.</p>
<p>Intertops also require AML and KYC compliance, even though this is not part of its licensing agreement, indicating the high degree of safety players insist on. So, in conclusion, Intertops Poker is certainly not rigged.</p>
<p>Intertops Poker Review: Reddit’s Opinion</p>
<p>To be able to draw a full picture of any poker site in the USA, you will want to know what fellow players are saying. We browsed through Reddit and other pertinent card room forums to find the opinions of actual players.</p>
<p>Our team identified some complaints lodged against Intertops publicly, but they were mostly debunked by other players, either current or someone who used to play at Intertops Poker. In one instance, a player explained that Intertops had failed to honor a cryptocurrency payout.</p>
<p>After a short discussion, the user was able to identify that he had fallen victim to a phishing attack that had compromised his crypto wallet independently of anything Intertops had done. Another user was unhappy with the fact that Intertops required verification.</p>
<p>KYC and AML practices are necessary and even mandatory even if you choose to play with Bitcoin. Overall, Reddit players have given Intertops good marks, notwithstanding the withdrawals, which may take longer, but are always honored.</p>
<p>Final Word on Intertops Poker</p>
<p>Our Intertops Poker review has focused on covering everything there is to know about the card room. From the availability of certain games to the GTD prize pools in tournaments. We have covered it all. The opinions of fellow players have been invaluable in putting Intertops Poker on the map. It’s the most popular website on the Horizon Poker Network and still offers a very decent 36% rakeback to make your gaming a little more comfortable. If you are a poker player looking to enjoy some low-stake tournaments and cash games, Intertops Poker is the right choice for you.</p>
