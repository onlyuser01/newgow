<p>Bally’sCorporation has announced a new strategic partnership with Stakelogic that will allow the prominent US-oriented operator of iGaming products to bring even more exciting opportunities to its audiences and player base. Moving forward, the two companies will work together on the provision of live casino games supplied by Stakelogic.</p>
<p>This partnership comes shortly after the go-ahead by legislators in Rhode Island who allowed the state to become an iGaming hub of its own. Bally’s is currently the sole active casino in the state, which gives it a further incentive to leverage the newly-regulated market in the best way it can. Bally’s hopes to bring games such as Roulette, Baccarat, and Blackjack to the market.</p>
<p>Stakelogic though has been a well-seasoned and fast-growing developer with more than 250 dedicated slot games and a rapidly expanding portfolio of live dealer technology and opportunities. Stakelogic has two dedicated studios in Europe from whence it produces cutting-edge live gaming experiences, and the company is live in more than 20 markets with all or part of its product portfolio.</p>
<p>Adding dedicated live dealer games by Stakelogic would allow Bally’s Interactive to build its offer quickly in the region and create compelling experiences for its companies. Stakelogic, too, is committed to expanding its footprint in North America by bringing a mix of its live as well as traditional online casino games.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Bally’s wants to get going in Rhode Island with a range of live casino games at some point in April 2024. Commenting on this new opportunity, Bally’s Corporation CEO Robeson Reeves welcomed the opportunity to see his company team up with a partner such as Stakelogic and prepare for the pending launch of Rhode Island’s online gambling industry. Reeves said:</p>
<p>"With a partner like Stakelogic, we know we are putting our best foot forward, and we are confident that we will be able to provide our Rhode Island customers with a truly exciting live dealer experience."</p>
<p>Stakelogic CEO Stephan van den Oetelaar was similarly pleased with the opportunity to see his company’s portfolio join an established and trusted industry veteran. More importantly, the partnership enables Stakelogic to bring its extensive technology to the United States and build on the strong live casino momentum that the supplier has gathered in the past 14 months, the executive argued.</p>
<p>Stakelogic has also been building up momentum in Europe where the company launched with Princess Casino in Romania and Royal Casino in Denmark.</p>
