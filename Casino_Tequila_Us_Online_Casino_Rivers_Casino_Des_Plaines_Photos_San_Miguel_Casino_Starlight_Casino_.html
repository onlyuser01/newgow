<p>Six of the top 8 Wimbledon seeds are already out of the competition. Still, the top one is still in the game – Novak Djokovic has reached the quarterfinal of the 2022 Wimbledon Gentlemen’s Singles. That’s where he’s going to lock horns with Jannik Sinner, the Italian player who’s slain several giants already, most notably Carlos Alcaraz.</p>
<p>Can Sinner upset the odds again and get his first-ever win over Djokovic? Oddsmakers do not think so. In fact, they seem to be certain that the Serbian player is going to win on Tuesday. However, he might not have a field day at All-England Club.</p>

<p>Odds Keep Shortening on Novak Djokovic</p>
<p>Novak Djokovic is the main favorite to win the 2022 Wimbledon. That’s been the case ever since sportsbooks published their odds, but in the last couple of days, his odds became much shorter than before.</p>
<p>The reason is that since the start of the tournament, a number of his rivals got knocked out, including five of the top 7 seeds – Casper Ruud, Stefanos Tsitsipas, Carlos Alcaraz, Felix Auger-Aliassime, and Hubert Hurkacz. Further, the #8 seed Matteo Berrettini had to withdraw after testing positive for COVID-19.</p>
<p>As a result, it’s now very likely that Djokovic will face his arch-rival Rafael Nadal in the final. Of course, only if neither of them messes it up. Judging by Novak’s odds, the chances of that happening are very slim.</p>
<p>He’s expected to win on Tuesday, although it might not be an easy match for him. The thing is that we’ve seen him struggle in a couple of matches since coming to England, dropping two sets so far. One of the sets he lost happened on Sunday evening when he played a late-night match against Tim Van Rijthoven.</p>
<p>Jannik Sinner Determined to Win (at Least) a Set</p>
<p>So far, Jannik Sinner has played against Djokovic only two times. Their first duel happened in January 2021 in an exhibition match that Novak ended up winning 1-0 (6-3). Their first (and so far, only) ATP duel happened three months later at the 2021 Monaco Open, where we saw Djokovic win 2-0.</p>
<p>Sinner might not have a great history with Djokovic, but he’s still very young. The Italian is turning 21 in a month’s time, meaning that a bright future is ahead of him. At least, that’s the expression we got after seeing him do great in the first couple of matches at 2022 Wimbledon.</p>
<p>Sinner’s most impressive performance happened in the previous match, in which he defeated favored Alcaraz 3-1 (6-1, 6-4, 6-7, 6-3). The win has certainly given him a major confidence boost, which is why we expect him to play at his best against Djokovic.</p>
<p>Novak Djokovic vs Jannik Sinner Prediction</p>
<p>Djokovic will win this match, there’s no doubt about it. The big question, however, is whether he’s going to win in straight sets. He dropped one against Van Rijthoven, who is 104th in the ATP Rankings, which makes us think the same might happen against world no. 13. That said, we should see at least four sets in this match.</p>
<p>Pick: Novak Djokovic to win; over 3.5 sets</p>
