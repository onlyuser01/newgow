<p>Greentube announced that Neccton’s responsible gaming solution Mentor will be launched for the brand StarVegas in Spain. Following the successful launch of the responsible gaming tool in the UK, Greentube announced that Mentor will enter more markets soon.</p>
<p>Neccton’s Responsible Gaming Solution to Launch for Spanish Market</p>
<p>Greentube, the NOVOMATIC Interactive division, is looking to launch Neccton’s Responsible Gaming solution across the Spanish online gaming market, the company revealed in a statement on Monday. The news about the expansion comes after a successful launch of the solution in the UK.</p>
<p>The implementation of the responsible gambling solution Mentor tool will be launched with the StarVegas brand in Spain. The tool will reinforce Greentube’s commitment to safe entertainment for its customers. Furthermore, with this move, the company will solidify its position as a responsible global games supplier and operator.</p>
<p>The Mentor tool was first launched in the UK with Admiral Casino. Besides expanding to the Spanish market, according to Greentube’s statement, the new responsible gaming solution will be rolled out in more markets very soon. By expanding Mentor to more markets, the company will also ensure the “highest level of social responsibility and player protection“.</p>
<p>The New AI Responsible Gaming Solution Mentor</p>
<p>The Mentor tool helps Greentube identify potentially problematic gambling behavior. The tool operates in real-time and automatically interacts with the players who may potentially be demonstrating harmful behavior.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Neccton’s new AI-based responsible gaming solution is tracking metrics which may indicate that a user is spending more than what they can afford. Those metrics include chasing losses, in-session deposits, failed deposits as well as canceled withdraws.</p>
<p>If one of those potential harm related factors is present, Mentor alerts the operators instantly. The responsible gaming solution communicates with the players via messages which feature details about changes in play or increased spending. Moreover, users also gain access to information that outlines their behavior and compares it to the player database.</p>
<p>StarVegas Is Very Pleased with the Partnership, Says the Company’s Managing Director</p>
<p>The Brand Manager and Managing Director of the StarVegas Spain and StarVegas Italy brands at Greentube, Adam Warren said in a statement that the company is committed to responsible gaming.

<p>In a statement, Neccton’s Director, Dr. Michael Auer said that the company is excited to strengthen its relationship with Greentube. He added that Neccton is looking forward to working together with Greentube across new markets.</p>
<p>According to Auer, Mentor, will help operators learn which players have the tendency to play at risk. He added that operators across the globe are increasing their focus on responsible gaming and player safety. In conclusion, Auer said that by teaming up with Neccton, Greentube is at the “forefront of offering safe casino entertainment online“.</p>
