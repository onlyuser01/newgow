<p>Dr. Toonz review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Dr. Toonz is themed around a lab filled with whimsical creatures.</p>
<p>In a secret underwater facility, players will meet an eccentric researcher. Together, they’ll study a variety of mysterious and adorable life forms.</p>
<p>This slot is a great choice for fans of sci-fi, or players looking for a cheerful atmosphere.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The reels are crafted from large test tubes, and inside players will see smiling alien-like characters. These cute creatures come in blue, orange, green, pink, and brown. Some peer out from their reel with just one eye, while others sport tiny horns.</p>
<p>Beside the reels, Dr Toonz himself slumps in his seat, often snoozing. With a white lab coat and a large mustache, he brings to mind quintessential scientist characters such as Doc from Back to the Future.</p>
<p>In the background, the lab is walled by glass, revealing green liquid on the other side. This suggests that this is no ordinary operation or setting.</p>
<p>Together, the music and animation create a quirky sci-fi world.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Dr. Toonz is a six reel, four row slot.</p>
<p>Wins are awarded for landing matching symbols in adjacent reels. These combinations are calculated from left to right.</p>
<p>The Cascade feature means that winning symbols vanish, making way for new symbols to fall into their positions.</p>
<p>The maximum win is 22,000x the player’s total bet.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter symbol.</p>
<p>There is a meter beside the reels called the Quantumeter that begins at 0 and charges during winning Cascades.</p>
<p>Once fully charged, the Quantumeter activates once the winning combinations are paid out. There are a variety of fully charged features offered by the Quantumeter:</p>
<p>Quantum Wilds: 2-6 Wilds are added to the reels.</p>
<p>Metamorphosis: 5-8 symbols are changed into another symbol, excluding Wilds and Scatters.</p>
<p>Disintegration: All lower-paying symbols are removed from the reels and 2 Wilds are added.</p>
<p>The Free Spins feature is triggered when players land at least 3 Scatters. The number of free spins awarded depends on the number of triggering Scatters as follows:</p>
<p>3 Scatters = 10 free spins</p>
<p>4 Scatters = 15 free spins</p>
<p>5 Scatters = 20 free spins</p>
<p>6 Scatters = 25 free spins</p>
<p>The Quantumeter begins the Free Spins feature with 1-2 charges.</p>
<p>At least one reel is chosen to have a 2x multiplier during the Free Spins feature. As many as six multipliers may be active at the same time.</p>
<p>The Free Spins feature cannot be retriggered.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.25%, just above our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.20 up to a maximum of $/£/€100 per spin.</p>
