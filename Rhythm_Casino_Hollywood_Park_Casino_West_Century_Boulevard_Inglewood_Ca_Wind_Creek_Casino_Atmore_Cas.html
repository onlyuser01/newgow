<p>The Malta Gaming Authority (MGA) issued a notice of license cancellation to AMGO iGaming Malta. According to the regulator, the gaming company has committed three major breaches leading to the notice.</p>
<p>First of all, AMGO iGaming failed to pay the total annual license fee covering the period between November 22, 2022, and November 22, 2023. According to the Maltese regulator, the company still owes €13,915.12 (approximately $14,700), thus violating Regulation 3 (1) (b) of the Gaming License Fee Regulations.</p>
<p>In addition, the licensee violated Regulation 3 (1) (a) and Regulation 6 of the Gaming License Fees regulations by failing to pay the applicable compliance contribution fees to the MGA.</p>
<p>Finally, the MGA noted that it has reason to believe that AMGO iGaming has also failed to meet commitments to players in a timely manner. If not, the Maltese regulator believes that a failure relating to Article 38 of the Player Protection Directive is imminent.</p>
<p>AMGO iGaming Has 20 Days to Respond</p>
<p>The MGA added that AMGO iGaming now has 20 days to explain its violations in writing and explain why its license should not be canceled by the MGA.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the MGA asked the offending gambling operator to settle all outstanding dues. The Maltese authority noted that the operator will be charged the applicable interest rate emanating from the Income Tax Rules in accordance with the delay.</p>
<p>The MGA reasserted that the gambling operator’s license is to be canceled if it fails to contact the regulator in a timely manner. The MGa said that it reserves the right to take any other measures in relation to the outstanding fees if needed.</p>
<p>Other MGA News</p>
<p>The notice comes just after the MGA canceled the license of Arabmillionaire Limited, which committed similar offenses. The company, however, failed to properly respond to the MGA’s initial notice, forcing the regulator to issue an official cancelation of authorization number.</p>
<p>In other MGA-related news, CEO Carl Brincat just announced his departure from the regulator. Brincat is set to leave on January 25. The MGA is currently looking for a suitable successor who will first spend several weeks shadowing Brincat before stepping into the office on January 26.</p>
<p>Brincat admitted that the decision to leave the MGA was a difficult one. He said that he has truly enjoyed his time with the Maltese regulator and that he will continue to follow the Maltese gaming sector with interest.</p>
