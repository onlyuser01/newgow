<p>EvenBet Gaming has tapped Roman Bogoduhov as its new head of business development for the Latin American region. Bogoduhov will seek to introduce EvenBet’s offering across leading markets in the region, working on specific customer and audience preferences.</p>
<p>Bogoduhov Brings Industry-Wide Experience</p>
<p>Previously, Bogoduhov has held a stint as executive vice president for Olymp Bookmaker. He has a deep understanding in the day-to-day operations of sports odds, event analysis and customer service, combined with his grasp of staff management and the production of promotional materials. Commenting on his appointment, Bogoduhov said:</p>
<p>“It’s an understatement to say I’m delighted to be joining the EvenBet Gaming team. As a company, we have built up significant momentum across the online poker landscape and that shows no sign of slowing down.” EvenBet head of business development LatAm Roman Bogoduhov</p>
<p>The new executive is thrilled at the opportunity of joining the company and has vowed to help EvenBet push its Latin American footprint and strengthen relationships with local partners, further showcasing the company’s technology and services.</p>
<p>Bogoduhov is versed in both iGaming and sports betting and brings linguistic aptitude as well as cultural background. He is fluent in Spanish and English allowing him to communicate freely with the majority of potential business partners and regulators in the burgeoning region.</p>
<p>An All Star-Team Charting the Way in LatAm</p>
<p>He will be joining Danny Ortiz in Costa Rica where the company’s Spanish-speaking support team is based. EvenBet does all of this as a clear commitment to growing its footprint in the region, which has been the subject of big appetites.</p>
<p>Bogoduhov will be available at the Peru Gaming Show on Wednesday and Thursday and will work together with Evenbet’s Manuel Jimenez, the company’s representative for Columbia. EvenBet CEO Dmitry Starostenkov welcomed the latest addition arguing that his talent would be highly appreciated as part of the team.</p>
<p>“This industry knowledge and experience will be invaluable to our business as we continue to design and deploy market-leading online poker solutions across LatAm and beyond.” EvenBet CEO Dmitry Starostenkov</p>
<p>Previously, EventBet hired Jimenez to spearhead the company’s operations in Colombia and the LatAm region as a whole. EvenBet has operated elsewhere as well, focusing on Asian markets as well.</p>
