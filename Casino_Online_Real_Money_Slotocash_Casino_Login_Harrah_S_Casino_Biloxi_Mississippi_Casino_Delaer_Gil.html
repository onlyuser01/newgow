    <h1>Casino Online Real Money Slotocash Casino Login Harrah S Casino Biloxi Mississippi Casino Delaer Gil</h1>

<p>If anything from my instruction is not clear, please, ask me. If you do not own a PC, ask someone around for help.</p>
<p>We try to help players in resolving their issues, but we also require cooperation on their side. Please note this is at least the third time I am requesting these emails from you, and we are talking about a very simple request. Therefore, I would like to inform you that in case you fail to provide me with the requested confirmation emails in the required form, I will be forced to think you do it on purpose, and the complaint will be rejected.</p>
<p>I would need the emails like the one you posted here before (see your screenshot below), but I need confirmation emails of the disputed withdrawals - forwarded as attachments.</p>
<p>So, now, please, find the confirmation emails of the allegedly unconfirmed and incorrectly processed transactions in your Gmail account, and forward them to my email according to the instructions.</p>
<p>I see you sent me the screenshots from your mobile phone again, but I recommended using a PC for it. There is a good reason why I asked you for it this way, and it is very simple when you use a PC.</p>
<p>"As I assume, these transactions were made to the e-wallet ending with "sr36t3" . Please, find the confirmation emails of these 2 transactions in your email inbox, and forward them to my email address according to my instructions above - click the right mouse button on each email and select "Forward as attachment". I recommend using a PC to do it. My email was mentioned several times above."</p>
<p>Since all other screenshots are useless, I recommended you use a PC to send me the additional details and gave you instructions, while you even sent the screenshots of the requested emails before in this thread, there should not be a problem finding them and sending them to me as attachments. Therefore, I would like to repeat the second part/request of my post from May 28, 2023.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is only one screenshot that includes the information I asked you for (see it in the screenshot below). However, we are much closer, and thanks to this relevant screenshot, we can move forward.</p>
<p>Please, consider my previous reminder irrelevant. It was only an automatically generated post because you only sent me the email, but did not reply here in 7 days.</p>
<p>Thank you, jmerriman119, for your email and all the screenshots provided.</p>
