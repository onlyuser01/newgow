<p>Global gambling and hospitality giant MGM Resorts International has once again been recognized, this time by the Military Times, a news outlet focused on the veteran community. The largest operator on the Las Vegas Strip has successfully made it into Military Times’ Best for Vets 2023 Employers list, making it one of the only two companies in Nevada to do so.</p>
<p>The Best for Vets: Employers list is “the most comprehensive annual ranking” of the United States’ best companies in terms of military-connected employment programs, benefits and support efforts. The annual survey seeks to identify and highlight companies that hire, retain and support veterans, veterans’ partners and military caregivers.</p>
<p>MGM Resorts International placed 50th on the Military Times’ list, underscoring its efforts to help former service members. This makes it one of two Nevada-based companies to make it on the list, in addition to the Veterans Benefits Guide which placed 58th. In terms of hospitality companies on the Military Times’ list, MGM was outranked only by Hilton Hotels &amp; Resorts which placed 10th.</p>
<p>MGM Is a Proud Supporter of the Nation’s Veterans</p>
<p>MGM expressed its pride in supporting military members and their families and reaffirmed its commitment to recruiting and employing military men and women and providing them with professional development programs.</p>
<p>The hospitality giant’s care for former service members is further underpinned by the inclusive culture it fosters through its Employee Network Groups. For reference, the casino and hospitality giant is also a member of the Veteran Jobs Mission, a group of companies that seek to provide rewarding careers to veterans across the country.</p>
<p>MGM Resorts’ chief people, inclusion and sustainability officer, Jyoti Chopra, commented on the matter, saying that MGM is honored to appear on the Military Times’ list. According to her, the company remains committed to showing respect to the nation’s veterans, service members and their families. Chopra noted that this is in line with the company’s overall culture of inclusion.</p>
<p>We are unwavering in our efforts to extend support, resources and career opportunities to those who have courageously defended our liberties and fundamental human rights. Jyoti Chopra, chief people, inclusion and sustainability officer, MGM Resorts</p>
<p>In addition to its other veteran-oriented efforts, MGM Resorts hosts the annual Salute to the Troops celebration. The casino and hospitality leader is also one of the biggest sponsors of the annual Las Vegas Veterans Day Parade.</p>
