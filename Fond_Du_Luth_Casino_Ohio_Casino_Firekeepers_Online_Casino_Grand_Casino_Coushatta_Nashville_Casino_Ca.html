    <h1>Fond Du Luth Casino Ohio Casino Firekeepers Online Casino Grand Casino Coushatta Nashville Casino Ca</h1>

<p>, hello, my complaint started like this i was or am at steak 7 sister site partner site of kashimachi, i had a problem with the betting history the history of my spins was paid unfairly as is weird unfair in my opinion but i accepted it I maybe just had bad luck at kashimachi the next day had the same problem â‚¬45 and was winning 25 cents or nothing on every fifth spin at 50 cent pocket so from my perspective on the betting aspect it was unfair and I am I am currently still writing to the supporters and the user, probably from the board, wrote me very unfriendly where the problem is and I have proven it with screenshots that I also had a complaint with you yesterday on the partner site and that I could get a refund my attitude would like to have or 50 free spins but i was told no the spins t is currently correctly credited to us and since there is no refund then she wrote on it if it keeps going like this that you are constantly asking the agents for free spins or a bonus amount I have to block your account I had manipulated the e-mails in the past so that I could get free spins received and I apologized and that has already been clarified and I was also accused of it again although it has been clarified so it was not said that I did it again but it was just hinted again that I was betting or always trying 50 To get free spins anything, it's really just that it's unfair from my point of view, that it's not correct, that's why I contacted support and didn't hear that I have a game problem that I'm getting on my nerves, so to speak, even though questions don't cost anything there there is still no reason in my opinion to legally block the account d That's why I demand that if they block my account without a reason, I get my entire deposit without the profits, which are significantly more than 8000 and I don't think it's correct and it's a cheek that the city of support explains to me or also helps what exactly is coming those with false hints towards game problem. Then after she had my account blocked she comes with the answer I wanted to hear it's not a technical problem I answered that's exactly the question I wanted my answer and yes that's why I'm here at Casino with Guru., their Assuming I have more screenshots that I can prove, but I can't upload them here because it doesn't fit, so I'm happy to email them I've downloaded a few trailers here, namely the service and my betting history, not the complete one overview</p>
