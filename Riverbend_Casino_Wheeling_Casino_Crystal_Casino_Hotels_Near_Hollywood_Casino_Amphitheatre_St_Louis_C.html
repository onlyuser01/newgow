    <h1>Riverbend Casino Wheeling Casino Crystal Casino Hotels Near Hollywood Casino Amphitheatre St Louis C</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>i have asked a permanent closure and a permanent self exclusion on the 31st of May 2022, exactly like you adviced as title in the mail i sent... They told me that they will transfer my demand to the appropriated department. I will send you the mails as proofs later once it is approved.</p>
<p>One week later, i had no reply from them so i wrote them again on the 7th of June to ask again a closure and a permanent self exclusion. Instead of that, they sent me promotions offering free money and bonuses on deposits, i will send you the mails later once you approve this complaint. The offer was sent a month after i asked a self exclusion and has the title of my mail saying permanent self exclusion so it is obvious that they just replied to my previous mail and did not care at all of my demand.</p>
<p>From this date i have deposited 140 euros with cashlib and 140 euros with neosurf among their 3 casinos, especially on this one La riviera casino. They even stole me 20 euros with my card when i tried to deposit. My bank statement clearly shows the payment but they said it was not after i sent the proof 3 times it actually did deduct the money from my account. I can send you the bank statement showing the transaction too.</p>
<p>I have also asked a closure on their casino clic, they told me to wait 48 hours to close my account, to not connect on the account. I did not connect for whole week and nothing was done. I wrote them again to ask a closure, i did not even get an answer.</p>
<p>I know i probably will not have my money back since they have no license and can behave like they want but at least their mark will go down and other players can see they are using such methods. I will also denounce them to the swiss gambling commission that they are accepting swiss players which is forbidden. I usually do not do this but when it comes to a scam casino, i do.</p>
<p>I contacted the casino to ask for a refund as it should be when they do not respect the self exclusion but they just sent me the same mail again saying that i do not connect for 48 hours on the account so they close it. I wrote again to prevent them, to fic it so i do not have to submit the complaint, again no answer.</p>
<p>In conclusion, i ask a refund of the amounts deposited after the date of my self exclusion demand, they can deduct the 100 euros i won 2 weeks ago.</p>
<p>I will send you every proof as soon as you want.</p>
