<p>BetMGM, the sports betting brand of MGM Resorts International and Entain, announced today the appointment of Michigan basketball legend and analyst Jalen Rose as its celebrity ambassador.</p>
<p>“Jalen Rose is an All-Star addition to the BetMGM team.” Matt Prevost, Chief Revenue Officer, BetMGM</p>
<p>Strengthen Bond with Sports Fans</p>
<p>Jalen Rose will participate in upcoming marketing and promotional campaigns for BetMGM, as well as in other types of fans events, to help the sports betting brand affirm its market presence and strengthen the bond with sports fans.</p>
<p>As sports betting is gradually picking up speed across multiple US jurisdictions creating excitement among sports fans, Rose expressed his delight to get more involved and join one of the leading sports betting brands nationwide.</p>
<p>“I’m beyond excited to go from a spectator to a player joining the BetMGM team, continuing to defy industry expectations.” Jalen Rose, Brand Ambassador, BetMGM</p>
<p>Jalen Rose will be tasked with personal and virtual engagement with customers at BetMGM and members of M life Rewards loyalty program of MGM Resorts, besides featuring in content on social media as well as on radio and television broadcasts nationwide.</p>
<p>“The impact he has had on the game of basketball is surpassed only by the exceptional analysis he provides fans daily. We anticipate a great relationship and look forward to the initiatives we’ll pursue together.” Matt Prevost, Chief Revenue Officer, BetMGM</p>
<p>Michigan is Important for BetMGM</p>
<p>Jalen Rose enjoyed 13 years as a player in the National Basketball Association (NBA) before moving on to become a popular media personality, industry analyst, and columnist. As part of one of the most famous college basketball teams in Michigan, The Fab Five, Rose captivated the hearts of basketball fans in the state where BetMGM is setting the pace industry-wide since the official launch of mobile sports betting in January.</p>
<p>The addition of Jalen Rose followed in the footsteps of another prominent sports personality, retired Detroit Lions running back and Pro Football Hall of Fame player Barry Sanders, who was appointed as an official brand ambassador last month to bolster marketing efforts of the company in the Great Lakes State.</p>
<p>In September last year, BetMGM and the Detroit Lions teamed up to make the sports wagering brand the first official sports betting partner of the famous National Football League (NFL) franchise and allow its branding to feature in in-stadium promotions and signage, as well as on social media and digital broadcasting channels.</p>
