    <h1>Black Oak Casino Resort Branson Missouri Casinos Grand Sweeps Casino Casino Apps That Pay Real Money</h1>

<p>The document verification is a weird one. I have accounts at different casinos on line. This is the second casino that asked for the following;</p>
<p>"In order to proceed with your withdrawal, please upload proof of the last deposit - a screenshot of the bank transaction on which we can see the amount deposited, date and time of the transaction, and bank account number with the owner's name. Also, please upload a screenshot of a bank account with the chequing number and holder's name visible"</p>
<p>So how I understand this statement is one screen shot of my bank statement that is 9 pages long with over 200 transactions. My name and address is printed at the top of the document. So just imagine me trying to get everything they are asking for in one screen shot with all of that showing.</p>
<p>So I did try to cut and clip everything from my on line banking account on my laptop. My name, the line with the transaction, even the e transfer confirmation I sent with the email request to make the withdrawal from the said casino.</p>
<p>Of course that got rejected because it was an edited document and it was the only way that I could get the proof that I made the deposit.</p>
<p>I think and believe the disconnection here is that the agents on line that represent that said casino do not understand the way other countries conduct banking statements with transactions. Every country is totally different.</p>
<p>My main thing here is that in Canada for my bank they do not show the time of the transaction coming from the bank account just the Amount, but on the confirmation of the E transfer it has a confirmation number which Im sure has the time the money was deposited in their system at the casino. If they would only just check that confirmation number.</p>
<p>This issue has an easy resolution.</p>
<p>They asked to see my address so I posted my bank statement with both of my accounts that I use that also has my address at the top. I took a screen shot of the line of the transaction which with my bank doesn't show the time.</p>
<p>In Canada bank statements get printed every 30 days so in my situation my transaction was June 24th 2022. My bank statement gets printed from the 7th to the 7th which means My June statement starts on May 7th and goes to June 7th. Now seeing as thats how the statement is printed If I already stated that a statement for the month could have over 200 transactions and my name is printed on the top of the page with my address how do they expect someone to take a screen shot with the transaction, the time, with your name showing?</p>
<p>I think all casinos on line should educate themselves on the way bank statements and transactions are shown in different countries. If you have someones passport and a bank statement showing the accounts and then if u need further info ask for a screen shot of the e transfer and check the confirmation number in the system to see if it matches. Nope instead I have to call my bank and prepare a special document thats not edited that shows the transaction with my name and time in one screen shot.</p>
<p>I think if online casinos around the world dont understand that process and dont understand the way the banks print statements in different countries do not allow people that are gonna face these issues make deposits.</p>
<p>Lets see what happens next. I'll keep u guys updated.</p>
