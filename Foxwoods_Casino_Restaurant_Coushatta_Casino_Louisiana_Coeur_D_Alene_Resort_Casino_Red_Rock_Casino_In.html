<p>A settlement has been reached between Wynn Resorts and shareholders. Wynn Resorts will pay a total of $49 million to turn the page of former CEO Steve Wynn’s sexual harassment saga.</p>
<p>Wynn Resorts to Pay $49m in Settlement Case</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Wynn Resorts said it would pay $41 million to settle a derivative lawsuit filed by the company. Nearly half of this amount, estimated $20 million, will come directly from former CEO and chairman Steve Wynn.</p>
<p>The total sum will be increased to $49 million because of “corporate governance enhancements”, resulting from filing the lawsuit, to which the company has agreed.</p>
<p>As part of the statement, the company has included a clause whereby none of the chief executives or the company itself is found guilty or complicit with any of the wrongdoing Mr. Wynn allegedly committed. The segment specifically reads:</p>
<p>“[…] neither the company, nor its current or former directors and officers were found to have committed any wrongdoing in connection with the settlement.”</p>
<p>The settlement should offer a resolution to eight individual shareholder cases filed against the company, following the saga involving Mr. Wynn and his alleged sexual harassment of female employers for years.</p>
<p>Specifically, the shareholders’ lawsuits sought to claim damages stemming from the investigations and reports of “disregarding a sustained pattern of sexual harassment and egregious misconduct.”</p>
<p>Wynn Resorts has avoided paying by withdrawing the money from insurance carriers. Meanwhile, Mr. Wynn’s decision to pay is seen as a sign that he acknowledges wrongdoing, or in the very least cannot avoid a court of law proving otherwise.</p>
<p>Things Will Have to Change</p>
<p>Moving forward, Wynn Resorts is going to introduce changes to its governance policies to ensure that similar situations do not happen.</p>
<p>While the Nevada Gaming Commission was conducting its investigation, the watchdog stipulated that Wynn Resorts’ higher-ups knew of Mr. Wynn’s misconduct.</p>
<p>The main allegation against Mr. Wynn was also the most shocking. Based on these allegations, Mr. Wynn assaulted and impregnated an employee. To settle, Mr. Wynn used a “private, confidential settlement with Employee 1 and paid her and her husband $7.5 million through a separate legal entity funded by Steve Wynn.”</p>
<p>On another occasion, Mr. Wynn paid a cocktail server $975,000 pushing her into a non-consensual sexual relationship, the complaint specified. Since the scandal broke, Wynn Resorts has gone through multiple internal shifts, appointing Matt Maddox as CEO and introducing Ellen Whittemore as general counsel.</p>
<p>Briefly, the lawsuit threatened some of Wynn’s projects, with regulators threatening to cancel previously issued permits and set the company back millions.</p>
<p>Despite the lawsuit, many have seen an opportunity to scoop up Wynn shares in anticipation of a price upswing. As of today, Wynn Resorts, Limited shares are up 0.35% traded at $121.97 each.</p>
