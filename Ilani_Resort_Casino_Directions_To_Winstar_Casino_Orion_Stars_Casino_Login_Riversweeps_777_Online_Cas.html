<p>Chelsea to play in the EPL without being able to carry out transfers</p>
<p>Manchester United debuts Harry Maguire but hasn’t found a replacement for Lukaku</p>
<p>Both teams need to be more competitive to take on Liverpool and Manchester City</p>
<p>Chelsea will face Manchester United at Old Trafford in their first EPL game in the 2019/2020 season. Both teams need to improve on last season’s performance.</p>
<p>Chelsea to Play Opening EPL Game at Old Trafford</p>
<p>The English Premier League (EPL) continues on Sunday and Chelsea will travel to Old Trafford to take on Manchester United. After a rather subdued performance in the 2018/2019 season, both teams are coming into the game with great hopes and a host of young players.</p>
<p>A lot has happened in the past few months. FIFA banned Chelsea from carrying out any transfers whereas Manchester United lost Romelu Lukaku in a recent transfer to Inter Milan but has failed to replace the player since. Meanwhile, the Blues are led by none other than Frank Lampard, Chelsea’s former captain, who has barred his players from commenting on the FIFA transfer embargo.</p>

<p>Manchester United Fields Harry Maguire vs. Chelsea</p>
<p>After spending a pretty penny to secure Harry Maguire from Leicester City, who set a transfer record, the Red Devils seem more confident in their chances of pulling off a better performance this year.</p>
<p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Manchester’s interim manager, has expressed his satisfaction with signing Maguire and the impact the footballer has had. Another valuable contribution has been Aaron Wan-Bissaka who was picked from Crystal Palace.</p>
<p>In the long term, Solskjaer hopes that the players will be enough to make up for the disastrous last season the Red Devils had. The team’s performance plummeted to a historic law after Jose Mourinho – the sacked manager of the team – had decided not to carry out any transfers in the summer of 2018.</p>
<p>Chelsea Battling a FIFA Transfer Ban</p>
<p>With Roman Abramovich skirting EU sanctions and selling the team, Chelsea’s performance took a plunge in 2018. The team is definitely going to need to muster a lot of courage to come out victorious. They are in a position that resembles that of Manchester United at the beginning of last season.</p>
<p>As a result, Lampard will depend on many of the younger players, as will Manchester. Pulisic will be in the center of Chelsea’s ambition at a time when the future seems uncertain.</p>
<p>Overall, hopes are that Manchester and Chelsea will be able to compete with Liverpool and Manchester City this season and make for a more interesting season in the EPL overall.</p>
