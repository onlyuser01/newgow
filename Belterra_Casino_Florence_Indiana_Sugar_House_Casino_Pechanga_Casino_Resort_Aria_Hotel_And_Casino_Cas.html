<p>The Beau Rivage Resort &amp; Casino in Biloxi, Ms., was the site of a lucky 25-cent wager that won more than $642,000 just days before the Christmas holiday.</p>

<p>‘Tis the season of giving, and a Wheel of Fortune progressive slot machine at the MGM Resorts casino did just that on the morning of December 21. A visitor from Georgia who wished to remain anonymous won $642,012.23 on just a quarter bet.</p>
<p>The player says they had only recently begun gambling. After just seven short minutes betting only 25 cents playing the Wheel of Fortune terminal, the individual hit the jackpot.</p>

<p>Wheel Living Up to Its Name</p>
<p>Wheel of Fortune-branded slot machines are manufactured by IGT. One of the more popular titles in casinos across the country, the IGT products are known for delivering the most fortunate gamblers life-changing wins.</p>
<p>IGT debuted Wheel of Fortune slots in 1996. The company says that over the past 25 years, the game has made more millionaires than any other slot title.</p>
<p>Wheel of Fortune slots have minted over 1,100 millionaires and awarded over $3.3 billion in jackpots since its launch in 1996,” an IGT statement to Casino.org detailed.</p>
<p>December 2021 has been especially kind to Wheel players.</p>
<p>Along with the Beau Rivage lucky gambler, a patron at Graton Resort &amp; Casino in Rohnert Park, Ca., won a $181,000 Wheel of Fortune jackpot on December 10. And on Monday, a North Carolina man gambling at Sam’s Town in southeast Las Vegas won $97,302 on a Wheel progressive.</p>
<p>IGT said November was also extra kind, as Wheel progressives paid out $1 million or more four times. Three of the wins were hit at Las Vegas casinos — Wynn, Circa, and Main Street Station. The fourth was won at a casino in Ontario, Canada.</p>
<p>One of the largest Wheel of Fortune jackpots in 2021 was delivered at The Venetian on the Las Vegas Strip. An Arizona man visiting Las Vegas in April won $2.9 million on a $5 Wheel bet.</p>
<p>Those on vacation at a casino this week still have plenty of chances to strike it rich. Wheel’s Jackpot Paradise progressive game currently has a jackpot of more than $1.7 million. The game can be found throughout Nevada.</p>
<p>Gulf Coast Rebound</p>
<p>Mississippi casinos have recovered quickly from COVID-19. Pent-up demand has been credited for bringing back visitors to the riverboats.</p>
<p>Through November, Gulf Coast casinos have reported gross gaming revenue of $1.47 billion. At this time last year, gambling income was at $1.08 billion.</p>
<p>We’ve had a great year. Just look at the revenues,” Larry Gregory, executive director of the Mississippi Hospitality and Gaming Association, recently told the Biloxi Sun Herald.</p>
<p>Gregory explained his belief that visitors are aware that casinos are some of the safest indoor public places amid a pandemic. That’s predominantly because of commercial casinos’ vast air filtration systems.</p>
<p>“I think they just had faith in our business that they would be safe,” Gregory said of the quick return of visitors.</p>
