<p>Booming Games’ hiring spree, which saw the company double in size in 2022, continues with two new additions</p>
<p>Booming Games, a rapidly-expanding developer of slots, has unveiled two new additions to its team. The iGaming experts Kaska Pysz and Dorota Gruszka will be joining the company as product owner and marketing manager respectively, the supplier announced.</p>
<p>Booming Games explained that both of its new members boast years of experience in the iGaming sector and will be valuable additions to its team.</p>
<p>Pysz Boasts 15 Years in Gaming</p>
<p>Pysz, for example, is a product and gamification specialist with an impressive track record in gambling. She has more than 15 years of experience in the sector, having worked with both land-based and iGaming companies. Her time at brick-and-mortar casinos helped her learn first-hand about player behavior.</p>
<p>Pysz graduated from the University of Cracow with a Degree in Marketing and Management. She has already leveraged this experience during her time working on gamification tools that enhance customer experience.</p>
<p>The new product owner said that she is very excited to join Booming Games’ amazing team and that she is looking forward to bolstering its pipeline. Pysz added that she is also thrilled to be working with Gruszka whom she considers a friend and a talented marketer.</p>
<p>Gruszka Is Passionate about Marketing</p>
<p>Speaking of Gruszka, Booming Games’ new marketing manager joined the iGaming sector 7 years ago. For the past few years, she has worked in various departments for various operators and providers and has acquired significant experience.</p>
<p>A few years ago, Gruszka discovered her passion for marketing and dedicated her efforts to mastering her marketing skills. She will put these skills into good use, overseeing Booming Games’ marketing department, as well as developing and deploying new campaigns for the studio.</p>
<p>Gruszka praised Booming Games as an innovator that is truly dedicated to diversity. The company’s team has people from more than 40 nationalities, which has proven instrumental in creating varied and engaging slots.</p>
<p>Gruszka said that she is very happy to join the organization and added that she is “super excited” to be teaming up with Pysz once again.</p>
<p>The Leadership Welcomed the New Hires</p>
<p>Moritz Blume, Booming Games’ director of product, welcomed the new hires on board. He said that the company doubled in size over 2022 and is constantly looking for experienced professionals.</p>
<p>I am convinced that Kaska and Dorota will add significant value to our company, and I am delighted to start working with them both. Moritz Blume, director of product, Booming Games</p>
<p>The company’s chief commercial officer, Frederik Niehusen, also welcomed Pysz and Gruszka to the company. He noted that the company’s hiring spree has helped it bring many talented individuals on board. Nielsen said that he is looking forward to working with all of them.</p>
