<p>Gannett Co., Inc, a prominent media company in the United States, has secured a new partnership with Gambling.com Group Limited, an established content creation service for the affiliate and gambling industry.</p>
<p>The partnership sees Gannett and Gambling.com agree on the distribution of various insightful and useful materials geared towards sports fans across the formerâ€™s network of publications and media properties in the United States.</p>
<p>Gannett, which is the parent company of the USA Today Network, will now add Gambling.com Group content to prominent and high-value publications such as Freep.com, Tennessean.com, AZCentral.com, and others.</p>
<p>The opportunity was well met by Gannett Chairman and CEO Michael Reed who said that this partnership was right for both companies. Reed described Gambling.com Group as an innovator that brings authority betting content and in-depth analysis, breaking news, and insights by well-versed experts in the world of sports.</p>
<p>"Our highly engaged audience of more than 47m sports fans crave analysis and betting insights to make smart decisions and find the best sportsbooks and online casino sites," Reed continued. He further said that the company expects to see an immediate boost to key financial metrics, such as Free Cash Flow and EBITDA.</p>
<p>Reed similarly added that the deal would only increase in value in light of the rapid regulatory push to regulate more sports betting markets in the United States. So far, 33 states and Washington, DC regulate sports gambling, with more coming.</p>
<p>The partnership between Gannett and Gambling.com is not entirely surprising as similar partnerships have already been negotiated over the past months. In August, Better Collective, another prominent expert in the delivery of sports and betting content, announced a similar alliance with the Chicago Tribune.</p>
<p>These alliances have been struck all over the world, not exclusively in North America or the United States. For example, Gaming Innovation Group, which acquired the AskGamblers property, signed a partnership in December with News UK. Such partnerships are indicative of the high value and synergies that collaborations between media and affiliate companies can drive for both businesses and consumers.</p>
