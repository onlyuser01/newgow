<p>MGM Resorts International teased its intentions to grow the brand beyond the UK</p>
<p>MGM Resorts International, a global casino and hospitality leader, announced the launch of a new BetMGM iGaming and online sports betting brand in the United Kingdom. The launch is in line with the operator’s ambition to turn BetMGM into a leading international gaming brand.</p>
<p>According to the announcement, the newly-launched brand leverages the technology and platform of LeoVegas, a Swedish gambling company that MGM Resorts acquired back in 2022. The announcement also noted that the new venture uses the BetMGM Brand and MGM Resorts’ best-in-class heritage entertainment in Las Vegas to deliver a “compelling and safe online experience” to customers in the UK.</p>
<p>BetMGM’s UK-facing iGaming and online betting brand is set to provide British players with many exciting products and features. For example, payers in the United Kingdom will be able to experience the spectacular jackpot offerings BetMGM is known for. In addition, UK gamblers will be able to try out the operator’s tempting loyalty rewards, promotions and exclusive products.</p>
<p>The new product is available to both desktop and mobile players. The brand is set to get its own dedicated app in mid-September, adding an extra layer of convenience to the experience. British players can learn more about the brand on betmgm.co.uk.</p>
<p>MGM Wants to Grow BetMGM Internationally</p>
<p>MGM Resorts’ president and chief executive officer, Bill Hornbuckle, commented on the new launch. He said that as a joint venture between MGM Resorts and Entain, BetMGM is a “proven brand” in the betting and gaming sectors.</p>
<p>Hornbuckle added that his team is looking forward to welcoming an international audience and growing the brand’s global footprint.</p>
<p>Today’s announcement represents a key step forward in our international growth strategy, which has been advancing rapidly since our acquisition of LeoVegas. Bill Hornbuckle, president &amp; CEO, MGM Resorts</p>
<p>For reference, the LeoVegas brand is currently available in nine jurisdictions across Europe and Canada.</p>
<p>MGM Resorts International Interactive’s president, Gary Fritz, also commented on the matter. He noted that BetMGM is a beloved brand in the United States and Canada. Because of that, his team is convinced that it can replicate its success in other markets as well.</p>
<p>The UK is a mature online gaming market, and we believe the BetMGM brand will provide distinct relevance to both sports bettors and iGaming consumers. Gary Fritz, president, MGM Resorts International Interactive</p>
<p>According to Fritz, the launch in the UK is just the start of BetMGM’s international expansion.</p>
