<p>The Jackpocket lottery app and WynnBET, the digital sports betting brand of the global luxury hospitality company, Wynn Resorts, have revealed a new partnership on Sunday that has the two firms collaborating in the New York State market. The pair have already brought exclusive offers to the Empire State as per the official release, which coincided with the Super Bowl.</p>
<p>Super Bowl LVI Inspires Wynn and Jackpocket to Act</p>
<p>The partnership kicked off with a new promotion dubbed the “Big Game Big Deal,” referring to the now wrapped up Super Bowl LVI. Players who signed up on Sunday had access to $200 in free bets on WynnBET after placing a $10 bet on any odds greater than -120. Commenting on this partnership, Jackpocket CEO Peter Sullivan said:</p>
<p>“As Jackpocket expands into new gaming verticals and partnerships, we’re excited to provide special offers, exciting sweepstakes, and new chances to win back to our players.” Jackpocket CEO Peter Sullivan</p>
<p>He welcomed the partnership with WynnBET and said that there could be no better time than one of the biggest nights in football to boost awareness for the betting brand and the Jackpocket app. Jackpocket has the raw data to back interest in Super Bowl by its consumers.</p>
<p>According to a 2021 survey commissioned by Jackpocket, 13% of its user base had participated in some form of sports betting in the six months leading up to the survey. That was before New York passed a law that enabled online sports betting, ushering in a new age of betting opportunity that is set to eclipse all other state results in the US.</p>
<p>New York Expected to Be Complete Record-Setter</p>
<p>Jackpocket is also a notable player in the lottery segment. The app hosts numerous games, including Powerball, Mega Millions, Win 4, and many more. Consumers have won $100 million in various lottery prizes thanks to its offer. WynnBET became the seventh operator to launch in New York State as an online betting platform on February 4.</p>
<p>Commenting on this milestone, Wynn Interactive president Ian Williams said: “WynnBet beginning operations in New York is a monumental step in the growth of our company.” This expansion is only expected to keep on giving as New York is set to break all betting records after a busy January. The Super Bowl results are likely to drive handle even higher, although the vacuum after the Big Game may be detrimental to the overall betting activity.</p>
