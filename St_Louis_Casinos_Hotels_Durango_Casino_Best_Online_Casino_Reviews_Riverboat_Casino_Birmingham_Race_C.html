    <h1>St Louis Casinos Hotels Durango Casino Best Online Casino Reviews Riverboat Casino Birmingham Race C</h1>

<p>Dear Casino Guru team,</p>
<p>I am a registered user on Velobet with a fully verified account (you have all my details in private). After placing some bets, I requested a withdrawal of 150 euros on January 27th. From the beginning, I noticed an issue: the withdrawal cancellation button, which usually appears right after making a withdrawal request, was not available.</p>
<p>Despite this, I waited for the standard three business days, even though cryptocurrency withdrawals from the company's casinos usually take only a few hours to reach the player's crypto account.</p>
<p>Despite waiting for the specified timeframe, the withdrawal still shows as "in processing."</p>
<p>I have contacted customer support multiple times, and the last response stated that bank transfers may take up to 3 days.</p>
<p>However, I did not request any bank transfer.</p>
<p>It seems like time is passing without the casino finding a simple solution, such as crediting the amount back to my Velobet account (then I can re-request the withdrawal) or correctly processing the withdrawal with the details I provided during the withdrawal request.</p>
<p>Every time I contact them, I have to repeatedly explain everything from the beginning. The payment department, with whom I am in contact via email, provided a response that is completely unrelated (mentioning even a bank transfer, which I did not request at all).</p>
<p>I kindly request a resolution to this situation either by crediting the amount back to my Velobet account (so I can subsequently request the withdrawal again) or by correctly processing the withdrawal as I requested several days ago.</p>
<p>Sincerely.</p>
