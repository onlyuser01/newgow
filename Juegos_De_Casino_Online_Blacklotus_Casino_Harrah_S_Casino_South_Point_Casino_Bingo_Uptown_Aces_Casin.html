<p>Digging deeper into the online gambling vertical, the company confirmed the launch of its platform in Ontario and revealed plans to introduce a mobile app</p>
<p>Regulated media and sports betting company, Rivalry, confirmed the launch of its casino product in its home market in Ontario, Canada. The company said Wednesday that Casino.exe, its interactive casino platform, will debut in Ontario, featuring a total of 8 casino games.</p>
<p>Rivalry has identified the potential of the iGaming vertical and has been continuously growing this segment of its operations. Last summer, the company announced the launch of Aviator, its first-ever third-party casino game. More recently, Rivalry confirmed the addition of live dealer games and as well as table games. The expansion of casino offerings included games such as Roulette, Blackjack and more.</p>
<p>It didn’t take long for the company to see the benefits of the casino segment. Since the launch of casino games, the company reported that the casino segment was responsible for 15% of its revenue, as well as 30% of its betting handle for the third quarter of 2022. At the same time, Rivalry noted that those results came after “minimal marketing efforts.”</p>
<p>The Company Remains Focused On Growth</p>
<p>Besides the launch of its interactive casino platform, Rivalry confirmed plans for further growth within the market in Ontario. In addition to the platform, the company said that it plans to strengthen its presence and offering by launching a mobile app as well.</p>
<p>“Launching our casino experience with a proven product that we’ve validated in our other markets is an exciting next step as we continue to grow our reach and offering in Ontario.“ Steven Salz, co-founder and CEO of Rivalry</p>
<p>Steven Salz, Rivalry’s co-founder and CEO, explained that launching in Ontario represents another major step for the company that has been continuously growing its presence. According to him, the company’s interactive casino platform delivers engaging, proprietary and interactive experiences for the customers within the market. Salz added that this, in turn, helps Rivalry stand out from the competition in the region.</p>
<p>The co-founder and CEO added that the company focused on prioritizing user experience, design and targeting specific audiences. Finally, Salz said that Rivalry remains committed to driving innovation within the vertical via new customer experiences and supreme entertainment offered through its platform.</p>
