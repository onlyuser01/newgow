    <h1>Par A Dice Hotel Casino Peoria Free Bonus No Deposit Casinos Aquarius Casino Resort Laughlin Casino</h1>

<p>I have decided to lodge a complaint ahead of schedule since my faith in this casino has been shattered.</p>
<p>I had to wait nearly 10 days to acknowledge my deposit of 200 Euros.</p>
<p>Thanks to your assistance, I managed to access my funds and won 5,000 Euros, requesting a withdrawal.</p>
<p>At that point, KYC begins asking for an impossible amount of information, each item requiring a separate email:</p>
<p>1 A utility bill (gas, electricity, water, Internet, TV or telephone), issued within the last 6 months, containing your first name, last name, residential address and issuance date.</p>
<p>You must provide a photo of a printed copy or a PDF.</p>
<p>Sent and seems okay</p>
<p>2 Bank Statement</p>
<p>Sent and seems okay</p>
<p>3 Front/back photo of the credit/debit card ending in XXXX, with the first six and last four digits visible. Please cover the other digits and the CVC code on the back with a piece of paper, as these are sensitive information we do not require.</p>
<p>Sent and seems okay</p>
<p>4 A card statement containing the following information:</p>
<p>a. Bank details (bank name, bank address, bank SWIFT/BIC code).</p>
<p>b. Customer data (first and last name, residential address)</p>
<p>c. Account data (card: <strong><em>* with IBAN: </em></strong>***, currency, currency)</p>
<p>d. Issuance date (must be issued within the last 6 months)</p>
<p>e. Bank logo</p>
<p>You must provide a photo of a printed copy or a PDF.</p>
<p>Sent and seems okay</p>
<p>5 Thank you for providing us with your documents. The documents have been reviewed and accepted.</p>
<p>However, to ensure account security, we need the following:</p>
<p>A photograph of you holding your identification document.</p>
<p>Sent and seems okay</p>
<p>And here we plunge into absurdity, to the extent that today I had to visit a notary:</p>
<p>6 To enable us to manage it, we kindly ask you to send us one more item:</p>
<p>A notary attested copy of your identification document.</p>
<p>To clarify, this is a stamped and signed photocopy, issued by an official notary.</p>
<p>Kindly provide us with a photo of this document.</p>
<p>Just sent</p>
<p>This appears to me like an attempt to discourage clients from withdrawing and keep them playing to lose the amount as I've had happen before.</p>
<p>Regards</p>
