<p>Shut since last year due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, nightclubs, and casinos in British Columbia may soon reopen. A new restart plan rolls out on July 1 and if the COVID-related hospitalizations are low and more people are vaccinated, more restrictions may be lifted.</p>
<p>Casinos and Nightclubs in British Columbia Remain Closed for the Moment</p>
<p>The COVID-19 impact on businesses was felt around the world since the start of the pandemic last year. Canada’s westernmost province, British Columbia is no exception. Gambling venues, bingos, and casinos in the province have remained closed for more than a year now, despite the local government gradually lifting restrictions. Those venues were closed on March 16, 2020, over fears of spreading the respiratory disease COVID-19.</p>
<p>Besides casinos, nightclubs in B.C. have also felt the significant economic impact brought by the pandemic. Those venues have been shut since September last year over similar fears of spreading COVID-19.</p>
<p>BC’s New Restart Plan May Ease COVID-Related Restrictions</p>
<p>With that in mind, the current situation may quickly change as early as this summer. On Tuesday this week, local health officials revealed British Columbia’s restart plan. Under the four-step plan, the local government plans to gradually increase indoor and outdoor gatherings, as well as lifting some traveling restrictions. The plan is set to roll out on July 1, which means that casinos, bingos, and nightclubs may resume business at limited capacity and while following strict health and safety measures.</p>
<p>Here, it’s important to mention that the success of the plan depends on an increase in the number of people vaccinated against COVID-19. Furthermore, local health officials are going to monitor the positive COVID-19 hospitalized cases. If all this goes as planned and more people receive the COVID-19 vaccine while at the same time hospitalizations remain low, under the restart plan, more restrictions may be lifted.</p>
<p>COVID-19 Vaccination in BC Continues</p>
<p>Focusing on the COVID-19 vaccination, we see that as of Tuesday, May 25, more than 2,778,907 people from British Columbia have received at least one dose of an approved COVID-19 vaccine, according to the COVID-19 Tracker Canada. This number represents approximately 54% of the population of the province. On the other hand, some 148,580 people from British Columbia have already been fully vaccinated against COVID-19 by receiving two vaccine shots.</p>
<p>In total, since December, British Columbia has received 3,499,660 doses of COVID-19 vaccines. Out of that total, until Tuesday, May 25, approximately 83.7% of the doses delivered to the province have been administered.</p>
