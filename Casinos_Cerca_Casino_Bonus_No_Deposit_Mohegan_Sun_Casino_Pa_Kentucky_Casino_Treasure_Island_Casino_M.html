<p>Play’n GO has received yet another license that will allow the company to operate in the US iGaming market.</p>
<p>Play’n GO which made its ambitions for the online gaming market in the United States known earlier has been working quickly to move forward and provide local operators with outstanding content.</p>
<p>Play’n GO Gets New License for West Virginian Market</p>
<p>Among those have been New Jersey and Michigan, but now, the company has finally obtained a license for West Virginia, which will allow it to wrap up the year with yet another success under its belt. This marks an important step forward for the supplier of cutting-edge content, and Play’n GO expects more markets to go legal in terms of online casino offerings in the future.</p>
<p>Play’n GO has been working to consolidate its footprint on both sides of the border, including in Ontario, Canada, but the entry into West Virginia clearly shows the company’s dedication to bringing next-generation iGaming products to the market. The United States admittedly had been catching up to what most European operators offer their players in the online casino segment, but with the arrival of suppliers such as Play’n GO the field is about to level.</p>
<p>Play’n GO CCO Magnus Olsson welcome the new milestone and said that it was one of the crowning achievements of the year. Olsson argued that West Virginia’s iGaming market is thriving and that it remains a key priority for the company to expand further.</p>
<p>Play’n Go Remains Optimistic about Future Success in the US</p>
<p>The year finishes on a strong note for Play’n GO, Olsson added, thanks to this new license. He added:</p>
<p>Players are different in terms of their game preferences in every jurisdiction, of course, but the common thread that runs through all players is that the quality content rises to the top – players want to be entertained first and foremost. Play’n GO CCO Magnus Olsson</p>
<p>Olsson is similarly confident that the company is able to deliver cutting-edge games and entertainment products.</p>
<p>The product pace is particularly quick with the company having new titles to release every week and the company saw more than 50 online slot releases in 2022 across a number of jurisdictions, including Ontario, New Jersey, and Michigan which are covered in the North American market with a license extended to Play’n GO.</p>
