<p>Prodigy F1 driver Lewis Hamilton made a short appearance on GGPoker on Tuesday, November 10, teased by the platform in a Tweet.</p>
<p>GGPoker Teases Lewis Hamilton Appearance</p>
<p>Formula 1 legend-in-the-making Lewis Hamilton has decided to make a quick stop off the racing track and right into the competitive world of poker with GGPoker teasing an appearance by Hamilton on the platform. Hamilton played alongside a handful of skilled poker opponents, to name Christian Rudolph, Niklas Astedt, Artur Martirosian, and Isaac Haxton.</p>
<p>The F1 driver didn‚Äôt quite cut first place in the Tuesday event, and he trailed 113th out of a total pool of 130 players instead. Speaking to PokerNews, a website dedicated to the industry and offering in-depth coverage, GGPoker, said that Hamilton was just a guest at the platform, albeit some suggested ‚Äì or rather hoped ‚Äì the F1 racer may transition to an official position as a brand ambassador.</p>
<p>LADIES &amp; GENTLEMEN‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Please give a warm welcome, on his debut at the @GGPokerOfficial tables, to ü•Å ü•Å ü•Å‚Ä¶</p>

<p>Yet, as PokerNews noted, poker signage has been in plain sight during some of the latest F1 races. Particularly, PokerStars‚Äô brand name has appeared on a Belgian Grand Prix broadcast, suggesting that F1 may be more opened to exploring further partnership opportunities with poker platforms. In the meantime, GGPoker has decided to do some cleaning-up in its own backyard, ousting stakeholders abusing Real-Time Assistance (RTA) software.</p>
<p>GGPoker Continues to Gather Momentum</p>
<p>Hamilton has not suggested anything about becoming a brand ambassador as of the moment, although GGPoker has been picking up quite a bit of momentum. The brand already has a team of ambassadors who consist of famous personalities such as Daniel Negreanu, Fedor Holz, Bertrand Grospellier and Felipe Ramos to name just a few.</p>
<p>Apart from its team of ambassadors, GGPoker has also hired a dedicated staff of streamers who focus on poker and promoting the brand‚Äôs name. The website and poker platform‚Äôs popularity has been steadily increasing, and particularly after the announcement that the company would host the World Series of Poker (WSOP) jointly with WSOP.com.</p>
<p>In fact, the World Series of Poker‚Äôs Online Series has managed to attract massive interest to the point where the total prize pool has reached $27,559,500 million, inking GGPoker‚Äôs name in the Guinness World Records.</p>
<p>The commendation was awarded by Negreanu himself and GGPoker continues to grow its portfolio of events, famous personalities joining it, and tournaments. Online poker is in a particularly good position now with the second round of lockdowns slowly but steadily pushing online traffic numbers up. An ambassador deal with Hamilton would definitely be a great move by GGPoker bringing two equally competitive worlds closer together.</p>
