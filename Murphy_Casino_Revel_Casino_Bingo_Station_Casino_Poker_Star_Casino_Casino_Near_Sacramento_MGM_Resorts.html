<p>MGM Resorts International’s charity initiative, the MGM Resorts Foundation, has donated almost $2 million via 82 grants to various non-profit organizations across the towns and regions where MGM Resorts has its operations.</p>
<p>MGM Resorts Foundation 82 Grants Will Benefit Local Communities</p>
<p>The MGM Resorts Foundation was founded in 2002 and gives the opportunity to MGM employees and guests to contribute to charity initiatives targeted at local communities.</p>
<p>The 2022 round of 82 grants amounting to nearly $2 million in total were distributed to non-profit organizations, which help regional communities in the areas where MGM Resorts operates. These areas include Southern Nevada, Michigan, Mississippi, New Jersey, New York, Northeast Ohio, the DC Metropolitan area and Western Massachusetts. The focus of the current grants were organizations that offer help with basic needs to the residents of these communities. This included initiatives providing food, shelter, medical care, mental health care, etc.</p>
<p>MGM Resorts International’s executive director of community engagement Maria Jose Gatti expressed her deep gratitude to all of the contributors to the Community Grant Fund and highlighted the local impact of the initiatives that received the grants: “Year after year we are amazed at the generosity of our employees and now guests. In 2022, MGM Resorts employees gave to 82 nonprofit organizations that serve the communities where we live and work.“</p>
<p>The donations were collected in the MGM Resorts Foundation’s Community Grant Fund and come from the contributions of MGM Resorts employees and MGM Resorts guests.</p>
<p>How are the Donations to the Community Grant Fund Allocated?</p>
<p>The Community Grant Fund does not work with specific non-profit organizations that directly receive funds from the grant. Various charity initiatives are selected during a competitive process, which is on a proposal basis. A committee of volunteers coming from MGM Resorts employees and functioning as representatives for the different regions where the company operates assesses the proposals and allocates the grants accordingly.</p>
<p>Since 2002, when it was established, the MGM Resorts Foundation has collected donations of over $100 million, which have been distributed to over 1,500 non-profit organizations and charities. The Foundation’s goals are to provide support to the development of local communities in terms of sustainability, resilience, better job opportunities, the improvement of various skills, etc. These goals are in alignment with MGM Resorts’ company motto “Focused on What Matters: Embracing Humanity and Protecting the Planet“, sustainability goals and the company’s objectives to have a meaningful social impact.</p>
