<p>Global sports betting and online gaming company 888 and League of Ireland Premier Division Shamrock Rovers Football Club announced today an agreement to make the gambling operator an official sponsor of the football club for the 2021 and 2022 seasons.</p>
<p>Brand Presence on Shirt and Stadium</p>
<p>Under the terms of the sponsorship agreement, official 888sport branding will feature on players’ shirts and the home of Shamrock Rovers, the Tallaght Stadium. The move signaled the strong commitment of the Gibraltar-based gambling group towards local communities in areas in which it has operations.</p>
<p>“We are delighted to announce our sponsorship of Shamrock Rovers. The Club enjoyed a fantastic season last year and is back fighting for a place in the Champions League for the first time in a decade.” Kieran Spellman, VP and Head of Sport, 888</p>
<p>Following on a historic season last year in which Rovers went unbeaten for 18 games to become the new League of Ireland Premier Division champion for the first time since 2011, this year the Hoops will be competing for a place in the most lucrative football competition in Europe, the UEFA Champions League.</p>
<p>“We welcome 888sport on board as our Principal Partner ahead of this weekend’s President’s Cup match, before commencing our defense of the league title.” Ciarán Medlar, Independent Chairman, Shamrock Rovers Football Club</p>
<p>Located just over 8 miles away from the 8000-seat stadium, 888’s office in Dublin provides employment for 140 people and plays its role in driving customer engagement and growth for the Sport division of the gaming group.</p>
<p>“As a sizable employer in Dublin, committed to Dublin and to the Irish Market, we are very much looking forward to playing our part in supporting our local team.” Kieran Spellman, VP and Head of Sport, 888</p>
<p>Rovers Have Title to Defend</p>
<p>The sponsorship deal with 888 was signed in time for the new season opener on Friday, March 19, in which Shamrock Rovers welcomes to the Tallaght Stadium St. Patrick’s Athletic to begin the defense of its title.</p>
<p>“The team at 888sport share our desire for success and we look forward to working with them to build a strong relationship over the next two seasons.” Ciarán Medlar, Independent Chairman, Shamrock Rovers Football Club</p>
<p>The new sponsorship deal with the League of Ireland Premier League champions will re-affirm 888sport’s presence on the Irish gaming market and help the gambling group to reach its business objectives for 2021 and 2022.</p>
<p>In a post-trading update released in January, 888 further raised the bar regarding the financial performance of the group in 2020. Following on an earlier announcement in December 2020 that the results would beat market expectations, the group announced revenue is expected to be moderately above the company’s previous estimates.</p>
