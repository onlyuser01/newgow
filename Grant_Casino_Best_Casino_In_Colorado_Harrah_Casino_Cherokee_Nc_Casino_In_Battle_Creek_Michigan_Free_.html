<p>Sporting Solutions, a leading provider of sports wagering technology, has unveiled a three-year partnership with CSGOEmpire, the most trusted CS:GO skin gambling site. As per the deal, the former company will provide its Odds Services Plus service to the operator.</p>
<p>The service in question is Sporting Solutions’ in-house pricing and risk management solution that leverages machine learning to enhance odds. As per the agreement, Odds Services Plus has been rolled out across much of the CSGOEmpire sports betting products, bolstering the customer experience.</p>
<p>CSGOEmpire was launched in 2016 after several months of development. The site eventually added betting to its offerings, allowing CS:GO fans to experience innovative wagering experiences.</p>
<p>CSGOEmpire’s traditional sports betting offerings were launched a year ago, adding to the company’s existing esports betting products.</p>
<p>CSGO Empire Welcomed the Partnership</p>
<p>The agreement was welcomed by the two parties, with representatives sharing their thoughts on the matter. Andy Wright, Sporting Solutions’ chief executive officer, for example, expressed his team’s delight about the partnership. Wright said that Sporting Solutions is happy to provide “the groundbreaking Odds Services Plus solution” to the operator.</p>
<p>Wright praised CSGOEmpire for its fast growth and said that he believes the new integration will further reinforce its business. He said that he is looking forward to working with CSGOEmpire and hopes that the partnership will benefit both parties.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Sporting Solutions will continue to empower companies with its solutions.</p>
<p>As the sports betting landscape continues to evolve, Sporting Solutions remains committed to providing innovative solutions that empower operators like CSGOEmpire to stay at the forefront of the industry. This partnership renewal is a testament to the trust and confidence that CSGOEmpire places in Sporting Solutions’ expertise and technology. Andy Wright, CEO, Sporting Solutions</p>
<p>Luke McMillan, a match book operator at CSGOEmpire, also commented on the matter, saying that this deal is in line with his team’s desire to improve its sportsbook products and continue its growth “on the traditional sports betting side of the coin.”</p>
<p>At CSGOEmpire we want to provide our users with the best possible product available and the Odds Services Plus solution gets us one step closer to that goal. Sporting Solutions allows us to incorporate traditional sports betting whilst still remaining true to our values of having a fair and transparent betting product. Luke McMillan, match book operator, CSGO Empire</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Sporting Solutions renewed its long-standing partnership with Sky Bet.</p>
