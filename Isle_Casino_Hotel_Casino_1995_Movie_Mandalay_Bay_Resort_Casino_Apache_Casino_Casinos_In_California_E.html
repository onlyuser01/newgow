<p>Evolution Gaming Sets Up 12 New Titles at ICE London 2020</p>
<p>Evolution Gaming is starting the year with a bang as the company is showcasing 12 new titles at ICE London 2020 between February 4 – February 6. The portfolio offers traditional casino products as well as popular games with a unique spin.</p>
<p>The studio has invited players to visit their boot and check out titles such as Instant Roulette, Power Blackjack, and Lightning Baccarat – a continuation of Evolution signature style table games solutions.</p>

<p>Another highlight includes Crazy Time, which the studio has aptly called “the most fun Live Casino game ever created.” Casino classics have been freshened up with the help of the “newest technological innovations,” the company said in an official statement.</p>
<p>Speaking on the occasion, Evolution Gaming Chief Product Officer Todd Haushalter commented on the new additions to the company’s portfolio:</p>
<p>“All of our new games are built on three pillars: firstly, a sharp focus on evolving core games such as Roulette, Blackjack and Baccarat so that they have appeal to the next generation of players”</p>
<p>Haushalter also drew attention to Evolution Gaming’s daring approach to game shows as well as “bonusing tools.” Without doubt, Evolution has been at the forefront of the live dealer segment.</p>
<p>Evolution Gaming’s Latest Titles at ICE</p>
<p>Each game in this year’s line-up is as exciting as any live game can get. The studio has finally decided to bring another classic to the live segment with the addition of Craps, one of the most exciting dice games dating back to Ancient China.</p>
<p>Crazy Time is another big draw this year and Evolution has been pushing it, calling it the “craziest and most fun title” of all times. The game offers bonus levels as well as generous multipliers. Another addition is Mega Ball, a crack at the lottery segment where a multiplier tempts players to try their luck for a massive 1,000,000x times their bet.</p>
<p>Continuing in the table game segment, Evolution has oiled the wheels of Auto Roulette transforming it into an instant live roulette. Power Blackjack will offer you an opportunity to push your bets massively on the first two cards.</p>
<p>An interesting addition is also Lightning Baccarat which clearly takes its cue from Lightning Dice and Lightning Roulette, both of which come with great multipliers. For those seeking for a slightly more optimized and even quicker gameplay, Speed Blackjack remains a viable option.</p>
<p>More importantly, a number of games now feature the option to run as first-person titles, to name Football Studio, Dragon Tiger and Mega Ball along with Craps and Baccarat.</p>
<p>The Best Game Line-Up Ever</p>
<p>The company’s efforts have culminated in what Haushalter has called the best game line-up ever. He further noted that EG has paid particular interest on improving the core games while continually adding “bonus-laden, relaxing and comfortable products”.</p>
<p>Lastly, Haushalter noted that there is definitely something for every player out there on Evolution Gaming’s 2020 roadmap.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Evolution Gaming also won the Online Casino Supplier of the Year at the Global Gaming Awards London.</p>
