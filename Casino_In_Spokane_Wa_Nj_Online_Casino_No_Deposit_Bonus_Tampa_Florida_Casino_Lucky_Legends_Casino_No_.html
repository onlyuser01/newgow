<p>How do free spins work?</p>
<p>Free spins promotions present an additional bonus, which you get only in combination with a deposit bonus or as a form of no deposit bonus - e.g. free spins no deposit offers. You will be able to spin several tens of times, sometimes even hundreds of times, on one of the most popular slot machines (or a combination of multiple slot machines), such as Starburst.</p>
<p>If you are already familiar with how free spins promotions work, you can go ahead and check our list of free no deposit promotions which include free spins. Be sure to check the Safety Index of each casino before you register and claim your free spins.</p>
<p>Conditions for free spins (no deposit)</p>
<p>You will not be able to withdraw your winnings immediately - you will usually have to roll them over 50-100 times in other games. It works the same with bonuses. Thanks to a small percentage advantage that casinos have in every game, your winnings from these spins can easily gradually lower to zero. Casinos count on this. Your only chance is to quickly gain a bigger win, with which you then succeed to meet the rollover requirements. Even if you manage to do it, casinos also limit the maximum credit amount converted into real money. Generally it is 100€ or less. Free spins are a genius marketing tool. Every spin is set to a minimum bet in a given game - for example for 0.10€ on Starburst. Thirty five free spins certainly sounds better than a 3.50€ bonus. But the true value the bonus actually is only 3.50€.</p>
<p>For historical reasons, free spins are managed in a game provider system. That’s why you don’t see them in your casino account. You see them only when you open the game where you can play them (e.g. Starburst). As for the wins from free spins, these are usually credited right into your casino balance. However, they are considered to be a bonus, and are subject to the usual bonus conditions (rollover requirements, maximum withdrawal, allowed games etc.).</p>
<p>Free spins are a nice bonus. They give you chance to try slots for real money without risk. You can get familiar with casinos before making a deposit. But free spins certainly shouldn’t be a primary factor when choosing an online casino. The probability that something real will remain in your account at the end of the day is very low.</p>
