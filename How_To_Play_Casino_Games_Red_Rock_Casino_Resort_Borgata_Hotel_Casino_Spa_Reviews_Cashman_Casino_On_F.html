    <h1>How To Play Casino Games Red Rock Casino Resort Borgata Hotel Casino Spa Reviews Cashman Casino On F</h1>

<p>Global supplier of sports betting data and integrity monitoring technology, Sportradar, announced it entered into a multi-year supplier deal with premier online sports betting and gaming operator PointsBet.</p>
<p>US Supplier of Choice</p>
<p>The deal between Sportradar and PointsBet established the Swiss-based technology company as the US supplier of choice for data from the MLB, NBA, NHL, college football, and college basketball for the Australian-based gaming operator.</p>
<p>“With the popularity of in-play betting exploding in the US, having fast, reliable, accurate data is critical to driving greater engagement amongst bettors. We look forward to working together to help PointsBet deliver a cutting-edge product to its consumers.” Neale Deeley, Managing Director, US Betting, Sportradar</p>
<p>PointsBet will utilize a range of Sportradar’s pre-match and in-game betting services like pre-match odds suggestions and trading tools, live data and content solutions, including live match trackers and live scores to boost engagement with the audiences under the terms of the deal. Sportradar’s Live Channel Online, a live streaming solution designed to enrich the in-play sports wagering experience for bettors, is also part of the data supplier deal.</p>
<p>“The PointsBet team is unwavering in our commitment to providing the most comprehensive and fastest in-play betting experience. We are excited today to officially announce our partnership with Sportradar and look forward to enhancing those in-play betting capabilities alongside their team.” Johnny Aitken, CEO, PointsBet USA</p>
<p>Affirming Presence in the Sports Data Space</p>
<p>The partnership deal signed between the data technology company operating on the nexus of sports and the sports betting industry by creating immersive experiences for sports bettors and fans and the global sportsbook and iGaming operator is the sixth agreement for top-tier US sports data Sportradar reached with a multi-state US betting company this year. It is an industry-wide recognition of Sportradar’s growing role as a leading source of trustworthy real-time sports data and data technology solutions.</p>
<p>Last month, the NBA signed a new expansive deal with Sportradar to utilize the data supplier’s capabilities to grow domestic operations, strengthen their engagement with fans, and increase the leagues’ popularity on the international scene beginning with the 2023-24 season.</p>
<p>In the meantime, PointsBet was busy expanding its executive team in Canada in preparation for the official launch of operations north of the US. PointsBet also secured market access in Virginia in a partnership with Colonial Downs Group.</p>
