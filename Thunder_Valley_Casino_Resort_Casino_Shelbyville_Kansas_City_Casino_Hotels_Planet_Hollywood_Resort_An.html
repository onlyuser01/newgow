<p>The Commission of Economy, Banks, Finance and Financial Intelligence approved an opinion to modify several law articles</p>
<p>Peru, which recently introduced a law that regulates iGaming and online sports wagering, has announced that players will be unable to maintain their anonymity when playing online. The measure seeks to prevent financial fraud and possible tax evasion.</p>
<p>Gamblers Will be Unable to Remain Anonymous</p>
<p>Peru legalized online gambling in August when Law 31,557 was signed into law. However, the country continues to find its way around the complex digital landscape and has just introduced amendments that will prevent tax evasion in online gambling.</p>
<p>As reported by the gambling news outlet iGamingBrazil, the Commission of Economy, Banks, Finance and Financial Intelligence approved an opinion to modify several law articles.</p>
<p>As a result, online sportsbooks will have an automated authorization process. Furthermore, they will be unable to provide anonymity to their customers in order to prevent money laundering in online gaming.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the amendments note that the cash bonus applied to iGaming and online sports betting will continue to serve as the guideline for calculating the tax on such offerings.</p>
<p>Lastly, the amended law says that existing sportsbooks in the proximity of religious and educational centers will be able to continue operating. For reference, recent law banned sports betting venues from opening within 150 meters of temples and schools.</p>
<p>Peru Now Has a Regulated Online Market</p>
<p>Law 31,557 was enacted into law in August 2022, ushering in an age of online gambling in the South American country. As officialized by President Pedro Castillo Terrones, companies in Peru can now offer iGaming and online sports betting.</p>
<p>At the time of the legalization, the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Tourism was provided with four months to create appropriate regulations for the vertical.</p>
<p>The bill was backed by an overwhelming number of Peruvian Congressmen and supervised by Roberto Sanchez, the countryâ€™s Minister of Foreign Trade and Tourism. The latter believes that an iGaming market will help Peru collect millions of dollars in tax revenue.</p>
<p>Following the legalization of online gambling, numerous companies penned Peru-facing deals. To list a few, in November, Pragmatic Play agreed to provide Tinbet with gaming content. Later, the same provider also inked a deal with Pentagol.</p>
<p>In January this year, AstroPay launched prepaid VISAs in the country. A month later, MGA Games entered the Peruvian market through a deal with Olympo.bet.</p>
<p>In more recent news, Oddin.gg, an esports specialist, strengthened its Peruvian trading hub, further consolidating its presence in the Americas.</p>
