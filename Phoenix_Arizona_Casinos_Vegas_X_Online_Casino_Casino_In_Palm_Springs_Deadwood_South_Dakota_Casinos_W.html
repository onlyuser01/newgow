<p>Dwarf Mine review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Like many of Yggdrasil Gaming’s slot machines, Dwarf Mine is a twist on familiar mythology. J.R.R.Tolkien has taught us that Dwarfs are a mining race, with a love of precious metals and precious stones.</p>
<p>Here though they trade in pickaxes for drill bits and rope and pulley for industrial elevators.</p>
<p>The symbols are therefore mining related, with precious stones thrown into the mix, and the four card suits to bulk out the numbers.</p>
<p>It's a cool combination of both the mining and mythology themes which pervade the world of slot machines.</p>
<p>Simple win in the Colectibles' bonus round</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The graphics are pretty good on Dwarf Mines. While they are not very flashy, they do give a nice sense of the underground world. The expanding reels are done with a real sense of scale and the animations are TV cartoon quality.</p>
<p>The soundtrack is pretty cinematic, though might begin to annoy most people after it loops for the fiftieth time. Luckily the sounds are easy to turn off, which costs some atmosphere but is worth it to stay sane.</p>
<p>Gameplay video featuring free spins and huge win</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>The gameplay is somewhat unique in the world of slots. A version of the all ways pay system adapted to a five reel, four-row slot format and with an additional feature.</p>
<p>You win, as with 243 ways systems by getting the same symbol in any position on three or more consecutive reels starting from the leftmost reel (or two for some of the highest paying symbols).</p>
<p>There is also a mechanic whereby hitting the Bonus symbol you expand the reels, with multiple Bonus symbols each adding an extra row (extra details below.)</p>
<p>How the Bonus symbol works in Dwarf Mine slot</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>There is no Wild symbol in this game.</p>
<p>The Bonus symbol, as described above, adds a row to the bottom of the gaming grid. If you manage to hit three or more on one spin, you trigger ten free spinswith three extra rows making for a five by seven grid.</p>
<p>When you collect 5 collectible symbols, you get 5 free spins bonus game</p>
<p>The additional rows are also the only place you can hit the collectable symbols. Getting five matching collectables triggers five Collectable Free Spins. Collectable Free Spins take place on a five by seven grid and have one of four additional "Super High Paying" symbols.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to players for Dwarf Mines is 96.80%. Not a great percentage, but above the 96% we use as an rough industry yardstick.</p>
<p>Dwarf Mine - Super high symbols paytable</p>
<p>Dwarf Mine’s volatility is medium. We prefer high volatility to go with our chosen strategies.</p>
<p>The site we used had a minimum of £/$/€0.10 per spin and a maximum of £/$/€125.00. This should still be plenty wide enough a range for most bankroll sizes.</p>
<p>Patyable - high symbols in the base game</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Dwarf Mine is a nice looking game with some familiar elements in its design, and some cool innovations in its gameplay.</p>
<p>The expanding reels is a nice touch as are the collectables which help keep a player invested.</p>
<p>The downsides are largely around its volatility which is not high enough to use with our strategies.</p>
