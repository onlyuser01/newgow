<p>Emara Play’s operator partners will soon have access to Kalamba Games’ huge array of slot titles, which come with signature features to improve acquisition, participation, retention, and monetization. This is possible through an integration of Bullseye, Kalamba’s Remote Gaming Server (RGS).</p>
<p>Emara Play Will Soon Be Able to Access Kalamba Games Titles.</p>
<p>Kalamba offers some of the most innovative gameplay mechanics and engaging themes available in the industry to a diverse range of demographics and operators worldwide. Blazing Bull, Ducks Till Dawn, and the Joker games series are among the best-received titles.</p>
<p>Emara Play has created a completely new model in the gaming aggregation industry, making it easier for operators and suppliers to achieve full customer satisfaction.</p>
<p>Emara Play’s aggregation platform provides over 400 online casino games and player interaction resources from industry leaders to its vast operator network.</p>
<p>Head of sales and account management of Kalamba, Tamas Kusztos, said: “Emara Play is one of the most dynamic companies working in Spain and LatAm today and we’re really pleased about giving local players the chance to play our games.</p>
<p>This move further emphasizes our commitment to regulated markets and significantly enhances the reach of our content.”</p>
<p>CEO of Emara Play, Daniel Rubio stated that Emara Play can now give their players some of the most creative and entertaining slot games on the market thanks to their partnership with Kalamba.</p>
<p>The Kalamba team is always working to be at the forefront of slot design, understanding and meeting the needs of a diverse range of player demographics.</p>
<p>Emara Play is always delighted to collaborate with such a service provider, and the organization is naturally optimistic about the future.</p>
<p>Emara Play Helpes Habanero Expand Its Market Share</p>
<p>Earlier in April, Emara Play partnered with Habanero, this partnership allows Habanero to expand its market share in Europe and Latin America, which are the developer’s primary regions.</p>
<p>The already well-known brand in Latin America is looking to strengthen its relations and expand the reach of its products. The provider will carry a variety of fun games as well as promotional resources to help operators promote the content.</p>
<p>At the time, Rubio said that his company believed in Habanero’s chances of success from the moment they saw its games. Habanero is a young, dynamic business with a lot to offer the Spanish and Latin American markets.</p>
<p>Emara’s focus is still on local providers who can deliver high-quality games.</p>
