    <h1>Casino Carnival Las Vegas Casino Hotel Free Online Casino Slots Primm Valley Casino Brand New Online</h1>

<p>Thank you, juujuu, for your response and for forwarding the message. It's important to recognize that if you requested the casino to prevent you from opening an account and they acknowledged your request, their actions were appropriate. I fully agree that ideally, the casino should have prevented you from registering in the first place. However, once they identified your self-exclusion request and suspected a gambling issue as the reason, it was justified for the casino not to pay out winnings to a player facing gambling addiction.</p>
<p>I want to emphasize once again that the ideal scenario would have been to prevent you from opening an account altogether. However, since you didn't have an account at the time of the self-exclusion request, linking your email to an account was apparently technically challenging and took some time to identify.</p>
<p>If you've already received your deposited funds, unfortunately, there may not be much more we can assist you with.</p>
<p>Please let me know if there is any additional information that I have overlooked, but Iâ€™m afraid I will be forced to reject your complaint as unjustified. I wish I could be of more help. Thank you in advance for your reply and understanding.</p>
