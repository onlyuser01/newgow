<p>Raquel Pennington Wants to Keep on Winning</p>
<p>Raquel Pennington is a 35-year-old Colorado-based fighter who‚Äôs been fighting professionally since 2012, with her amateur debut happening back in 2009. She joined the UFC in 2014 after an unsuccessful stint with Invicta FC. In Dana White‚Äôs promotion, she has been fantastic, especially since the start of the 2020s decade.</p>

<p>After losing to Holly Holm by decision in June 2020, she went on to win five fights in a row. The best thing is that she defeated a couple of real elite fighters, most notably, Ketlen Vieira. She beat her by a split decision in January 2023.</p>
<p>She did great striking-wise in that bout, landing 81 significant strikes in three rounds. That‚Äôs a lot of strikes and punches, but that‚Äôs not unusual for ‚ÄúRocky.‚Äù She tends to land 4.02 strikes a minute. The bad news for her is that the same is the case with Mayra Bueno Silva.</p>
<p>Mayra Bueno Silva Ready to Make a Giant Leap Forward</p>
<p>Mayra Bueno Silva has 10 wins in her portfolio, with two losses, one draw, and one no contest. Both of her losses happened by decision ‚Äì to Mayna Moroz and Manon Fiorot. Her only draw happened against Montana De La Rosa. It was a majority draw, which ‚ÄúSheetara‚Äù would have won if she wasn‚Äôt deducted one point for grabbing the fence.</p>
<p>When it comes to the one that was declared no contest, it happened against Holly Holm. Originally, it was a win by submission for Bueno Silva, but the result was overturned after she tested positive for a banned substance.</p>
<p>Bueno Silva has 10 wins in her portfolio, with her biggest wins including those against grappling expert Gillian Robertson, whom she defeated by submission, against former Muay Thai world champion Lina L√§nsberg, and so on.</p>
<p>Raquel Pennington vs. Mayra Bueno Silva Prediction</p>
<p>Our prediction for the UFC 297 co-main event is that Mayra Bueno Silva will win. We think she‚Äôs way better in all aspects of fighting than Raquel Pennington, not to mention that she seems much tougher. She‚Äôs ready to go to war on Saturday and come out of it victorious.</p>
<p>Pick: Mayra Bueno Silva</p>
