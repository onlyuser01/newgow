<p>William Hill, one of the world’s leading sports betting brands, has launched “EPIC,” a new soccer campaign, which will have its premiere in the UK this weekend and will further demonstrate the company’s understanding of the soccer culture. The new campaign comes off the heels of William Hill’s partnership with Sky Sports.</p>
<p>The TV Ad Is Just the Start of the Campaign</p>
<p>The launch of the TV ad is just the start, William Hill noted. The sportsbook is set to replicate the look across numerous platforms and provide fans with a truly epic experience. William Hill’s ad was filmed at QPR’s home field and Nico and Michel Arribehaute were responsible were bringing it to life.</p>
<p>Charlotte Emery, William Hill’s chief brand officer, commented on the development by saying that William Hill wants to be well-known for its dedication to soccer. Emery added that the success of the Women’s Euro and the upcoming World Cup, which is the first in history to be held in winter, gives William Hill “new opportunities.”</p>
<p>She also added that William Hill was very happy with Nico and Michel’s contributions to the company’s 2021 campaign, which is why it decided to work with them yet again. As a concluding matter, Emery noted that the integrated 360 EPIC campaign is tailored for each international territory in which William Hill operates and it will serve to show the company’s dedication to soccer.</p>
<p>The TV ad features Jermaine Jenas, a former English soccer star and a pundit for BBC. He stated that it was exciting for him to be a part of this campaign and that he’s eager to see what the new soccer season has in store, and is looking forward to William Hill’s initiatives.</p>
<p>William Hill International Was Recently Purchased by 888 Holdings</p>
<p>At the start of July, William Hill released an official statement that confirmed that its non-US have been acquired by 888 Holdings Plc.</p>
<p>This resulted in several new appointments in the executive leadership team of the Group. Itai Pazner was appointed as CEO, Yariv Dafna was appointed as CFO, Vaughan Lewis was appointed as CSO, Guy Cohen was appointed as COO and Harinder Gill was appointed as CRO. Other notable changes in the leadership team included Mark Skinner (CPO), Satty Bhens (chief product and technology officer), Naama Kushnir (CTO), and Phil Walker (UK MD).</p>
<p>The organizational changes also resulted in Eric Hageman and Ulrik Bengtsson, former CFO, and CEO of William Hill, having to leave after the completion was finalized.</p>
<p>Andrea Gisle Joosen, Randy Freer, and Andria Vidler were appointed as independent non-executive directors, effective immediately.</p>
