<p>Gibraltar subsidiary of iGaming aggregator and content supplier Relax Gaming was granted gaming supplier license by the UK Gambling Commission, the company announced in a press release today.</p>
<p>New Growth Opportunities</p>
<p>The approval for one of the world’s strongest markets for online casino games will open up new opportunities for Relax Gaming’s suite of quality casino games which will reach UK players supplied by its Gibraltar arm to licensed UK operators.</p>
<p>“Following a fruitful relationship with the UKGC through our Malta-based company, having all our products and services approved for our Gibraltar branch is another major commercial highlight for us. Its significance will be felt across the business, including by our valued third-party partners.” Tommi Maijala, CEO, Relax Gaming</p>
<p>Operator partners Boylesports, 32Red, and BetVictor have already been transferred to Relax Gaming’s Gibraltar network, the aggregator platform company outlined, pointing to Entain brands Ladbrokes and Coral as the next to follow with the transition.</p>
<p>The gaming supplier license in the UK followed in the footsteps of the approval Relax Gaming received from the licensing authority in Gibraltar. Together with the other group licenses from the Malta Gaming Authority and the Romanian National Gaming Office, the UK permit helps multiply the points of sale for the content supplier across regulated markets.</p>
<p>“This licence acquisition represents fresh opportunity in our drive to deliver excellence and growth across all regulated markets.” Tommi Maijala, CEO, Relax Gaming</p>
<p>Apart from the UK, Relax Gaming continues with its efforts to establish itself as an in-demand provider in the Nordics, where online casino players are famous for their discerning skills. The aggregator already received recognition in the region earlier this year when it received an EGR Nordics Casino Content Supplier award.</p>
<p>The aggregator’s vast portfolio featuring over 2,000 casino games among which in-house studio slots and third-party titles supplied to its gaming partners via the Silver Bullet and Powered By Relax partnership programs position Relax Gaming as one of the industry’s leading B2B suppliers of gaming content.</p>
<p>Following its Gibraltar license in October 2020, Relax Gaming started building its portfolio of gaming partners, with OneTouch being among the latest the aggregator added to its Powered By Relax program last month.</p>
<p>In March, Relax Gaming collaborated with another major gaming operator, Parimatch, to add unique content from more than 50 third-party studios to its aggregation platform.</p>
