    <h1>Seminole Hard Rock Hotel Casino Hollywood Milkyway Online Casino Pennsylvania Online Casinos Wynn La</h1>

<p>Stakelogic has announced a new partnership with MrQ, one of the leading online casino brands in the United Kingdom. As a result, Stakelogic will deploy its full portfolio of games with MrQ and introduce more than 250 slot games to layers. The integration will be carried through Relax Gaming, an established aggregator of third-party products and developer of bespoke gaming products itself.</p>
<p>More Slots to MrQ’s Portfolio from Stakelogic</p>
<p>MrQ players will have access to a number of Candyways Bonanza 2 Megaways, El Patron, and Wild Wild Bass to name a few. Players will also be able to access the company’s dedicated Super Stake mechanic.</p>
<p>Commenting on this opportunity, Stakelogic sales manager Danila Dzehs said that the company was delighted to be launching with MrQ in the UK market. She praised the brand, which has been there since 2018, and said that moving forward, the two companies will have an excellent relationship. She added:</p>
<p>We are grateful to our partners at Relax for their assistance in getting this deal over the line, further solidifying our relationship with them as an aggregator of our games. Stakelogic sales manager Danila Dzehs</p>
<p>MrQ head of gaming operations Satpal Chaggar was similarly pleased with the deal and welcomed the opportunity to work closer with MrQ and assist with the company’s mission to introduce games with some of the best return-to-player options to players in the UK. This new partnership with Stakelogic is definitely a reason for the company to be proud.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Stakelogic continues to expand its European footprint. The company recently launched with Unibet in the Netherlands and specifically introduced its exclusive Runner8Runner game show in the country. Prior to the partnership with MrQ, Stakelogic Live, the live casino-focused arm of the company, obtained a license from the UK Gambling Commission in August.</p>
