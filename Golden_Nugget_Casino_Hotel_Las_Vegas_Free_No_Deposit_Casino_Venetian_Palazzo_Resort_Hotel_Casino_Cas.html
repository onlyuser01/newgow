<p>Leading poker site GGPoker partners up with Fantastic Ladies in Poker (FLIP) to support the women’s poker community.</p>
<p>GGPoker and FLIP Share a Vision to Make the Game More Inclusive</p>
<p>GGPoker has partnered up with FLIP to help the female poker community grow. The website plans to promote the development and growth of FLIP with different initiatives. Under the deal, members of the community will receive benefits and access to exclusive tournaments.</p>
<p>After making Dan Bilzerian its ambassador and the following backlash, GGPoker stated that poker is not a discriminatory game and the company will soon make a “concerted effort in extending its outreach to female players.” The partnership between GGPoker and FLIP comes not long after that statement.</p>
<p>Daiva Byrne, the founder of FLIP, was appointed by GGPoker as an outreach and community advocate. She created a Facebook group dedicated to female poker, FLIP, which is now the leading female poker player community on the social media.</p>
<p>The Facebook group has more than 3,500 members. Daiva goes by the nickname ‘Baltic Blonde’ and is one of the biggest poker ambassadors. According to The Hendon Mob, she won more than $200,000 in live tournaments.</p>
<p>When commenting on the partnership between FLIP and GGPoker, Byrne expressed her excitement, stating that both communities share a similar vision for poker. They both want to make the game more inclusive. Byrne also said that she is thrilled to partner up with a brand that creates innovations that ‘resonate with the poker community.’</p>
<p>GGPoker’s head of PR, Paul Burke was happy to welcome FLIP to GGPoker’s community. He believes its members will enjoy the gaming experience. He expressed his confidence in Daiva’s ability to contribute to the company’s goal to make every player feel welcome.</p>
<p>FLIP Celebrates Women’s Success in Poker</p>
<p>As a community that supports women, Fantastic Ladies in Poker celebrates the achievements of its members. It plans upcoming events and hosts discussions on a variety of topics. Three years ago, in an interview Promoting Women’s poker, Daiva Byrne addressed some of the challenges women face. Byrne stated that in poker, the audience is predominantly male and marketing supports that. She suggested having advertising that would appeal to women to make them feel more welcome. Byrne also mentioned that promoting women’s success in the game would give the ‘I can do that too’ environment, which will make the game more inclusive.</p>
<p>She also said that online tournaments, exclusive only to women, would make new female players more comfortable. There have been many good examples of strong female role-models in pokers, though.</p>
<p>One of those has been Maria Ho, a player with whom we spoke in December and who is a strong advocate for equality in the game. In her book “The Biggest Bluff,” Maria Konnikova, who is a PhD researcher-turned-professional player, talks about how she challenges masculinity and gets away against players who “don’t like to lose to a girl.”</p>
