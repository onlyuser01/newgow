<p>The future of the Web3 regulatory framework will be decided by the Constitutional Council</p>
<p>French blockchain enthusiasts have a reason to rejoice as the Sorare law was passed with overwhelming support. Under the new law, which would provide the foundation for a regulatory framework for games using NFT and crypto features, such titles will not be classified as gambling.</p>
<p>Backed by 437 voters and opposed by 77, the so-called Jonum (games with monetizable digital objects) regime is set to seek a balance between innovation and player protection.</p>
<p>The Sorare law still needs approval from the Constitutional Council but is an important step toward the legitimization of NFT and crypto games. The council will now review the voted measure and decide its future. The council has the power to reject the Sorare law, which would be a suboptimal outcome for the future of blockchain technology in France.</p>
<p>If the law is passed, however, the Jonum regime could be the development that companies tapping into blockchain technology desire. In any case, the regime would likely still need tweaks and amendments, considering the novelty of the crypto gaming vertical.</p>
<p>France Seeks to Regulate Crypto Games</p>
<p>Because of their inherent similarities, crypto games risked being classified as gambling, which is subject to higher taxes.</p>
<p>While crypto games will not be considered gambling, their compliance will still be overseen by France’s watchdog, the Autorité Nationale des Jeux (ANJ). Like in gambling, the ANJ will require crypto gamers to provide their age and prove their identity when withdrawing funds. However, they will not need to verify their identity when registering an account. Web3 games will also be subjected to a number of other regulations they would be required to follow.</p>
<p>Experts have suggested that the Sorare law would give preferential treatment to crypto games, which is why existing operators might be inclined to explore the opportunities the blockchain sector offers. Pari Mutuel Urbain, for example, already offers a crypto-based fantasy racing game called Stables and is likely to further dabble in Web3 technology.</p>
<p>While some companies are sure to adapt, casino groups have slammed the new law, accusing the government of not inviting them to participate in the discussion. Under French law, only casino companies with a physical presence can offer online gambling. Many of these companies believe that the regulation of Jonum is a bad move that would usher in an age of illegal gambling.</p>
<p>Some even fear that some online casinos may use NFT payouts to circumvent France’s gambling rules.</p>
