<p>ComeOn Group has entered into a partnership with automated brand interaction specialist Ada. Through this partnership, ComeOn Group’s websites and brands will integrate Ada’s cutting-edge chatbot which is powered by AI algorithms that have significantly improved the customer care experience for the players of existing partners.</p>
<p>Elevating Customer Support Involves Automation</p>
<p>The chatbot is able to deliver a highly-personalized experience that elevates the customer care experience and sets a gold standard. The automation of this feature is not a drawback but rather a powerful tool that enables brands to better understand and respond to consumer needs.</p>
<p>ComeOn Group is confident about this partnership and has already introduced the chatbot in several markets. However, the company wishes to make the experience a step further by making sure that the solution is live in all of its covered markets and languages by the third quarter of the year. The ambitious timeline reflects ComeOn Group’s determination to bring the best possible experience to its consumers.</p>
<p>Customer Experience is a front-and-center tenet of the group and Ada’s solution already has a great track record for ensuring that customers have to wait for less to get the solutions they need. ComeOn Group COO Daniela Vella welcomed this opportunity and said:</p>
<p>This is a big enabler for the team to drive forward our signature first-class support whilst still aligning with the bigger automation transformation of the group. Ada was a natural choice for ComeOn Group given the synergies between us – the solution is efficient from both a technology and a human aspect. ComeOn Group COO Daniela Vella</p>
<p>Ada is Happy with ComeOn’s Partnership</p>
<p>Ada VP of customer experience Jim Monroe was similarly excited to be contributing to the ComeOn Group’s offer. The executive added:</p>
<p>They’re an innovative team and are inquisitive, analytical, and adept with the Ada Platform. They are leveraging our segmentation and multilingual capabilities to deliver a personalized experience to their customers across their multiple brands and languages. Ada VP of customer experience Jim Monroe</p>
<p>Automated solutions in the iGaming sector are becoming more popular. Casinos and companies are trying to ensure that their customers have access to more automated and tailored solutions but the only way to do that is by entrusting powerful AI algorithms duly supervised by brand managers and customer care experts.</p>
