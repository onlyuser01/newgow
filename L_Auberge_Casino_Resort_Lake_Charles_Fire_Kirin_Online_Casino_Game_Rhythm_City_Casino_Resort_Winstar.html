<p>Gambling giant Entain has announced that it will be relaunching Unikrn, an esports betting and entertainment media company it acquired in 2021. After the acquisition, Entain began renewing Unikrn interface and improving overall user experience.</p>
<p>Entain Worked Hard on Improving Unikrn</p>
<p>Unikrn will make a return with an entirely new interface, Entain announced. Over the past year since acquiring the esports brand, the gambling operator’s team has been diligently working to turn it into a modern yet safe and accessible product that players can trust. As announced by Entain, the refreshed Unikrn brand is the result of the former company’s aim to introduce a high-quality esports betting platform that is in line with the demands of video game-loving bettors.</p>
<p>Entain summarized the updated platform as one that will enable players to easily wager on an around-the-clock stream of video game action. Players will be able to bet through the Unikrn Casino, Unikrn Sportsbook, Unikrn Esportsbook, Unikrn Rewards and Unikrn Virtual brands.</p>
<p>Unikrn was first launched eight years ago and is one of the most reputable brands in esports betting. Following the relaunch, Entain plans to further expand its reach and help the platform make forays into more regulated jurisdictions. Brazil and Canada are two of the markets where Entain plans to launch Unikrn.</p>
<p>Unikrn Wants to Engage a New Generation of Bettors</p>
<p>Justin Dellario, MD of esports at Entain and chief executive officer of Unikrn, spoke about the launch. He noted that Entain’s passionate year spent a year working with Unikrn to help it create a safe, accessible, secure and compliant product that is also trustworthy. Dellario explained that the two companies wanted to turn Unikrn into a platform where even first-time bettors would feel safe.</p>
<p>Dellario added that launching Unikrn in Brazil and Canada would be just the first step in growing Entain’s esports wagering arm and appealing to fans of esports.</p>

<p>Entain continues to grow its business with other acquisitions as well. A few days ago, the company acquired the Croatian gambling and sports betting operator SuperSport Group. Entain also successfully expanded its global presence by launching the bwin brand in Zambia and the Ladbrokes, bwin and Sportingbet brands in Germany.</p>
<p>In other news, Entain is currently being sued in Australia as Tabcorp is very unhappy with a deal between the operator and NSW pubs.</p>
