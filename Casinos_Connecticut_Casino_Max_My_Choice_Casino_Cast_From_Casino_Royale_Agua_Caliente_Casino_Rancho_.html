    <h1>Casinos Connecticut Casino Max My Choice Casino Cast From Casino Royale Agua Caliente Casino Rancho</h1>

<p>There is a deposit bonus in chat, but when I asked if it was possible to withdraw by deleting it, it was said that I could do it.</p>
<p>Specifically, there is 1200 dollars and 200 dollars is a bonus, but I asked if there is no mistake in recognizing that the difference of 1000 dollars remains</p>
<p>I received a reply saying that it was Mr. Left, so when I deleted the bonus, about 1000 dollars disappeared, and even if I inquired to return it, I can not do it, so I would like you to solve it.</p>
<p>The other party admits that the wording was bad, but it is said that it can not be corrected.</p>
