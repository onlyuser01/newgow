    <h1>Sunrise Casino Admiral Casino Red Rock Casino Rooms Vegas Casino Online No Deposit Bonus Wind Creek</h1>

<p>dishonest - withholding money . They take days to answer a message - They promised a bonus but it was fake as it didnt appear post deposit, they accepted thousands in deposits with no mention of ID but when i tried to withdraw £100 - MY FIRST EVER WITHDRAWAL they wanted all sorts of ID. I have been owed £252 since 26th November 2022 and they are refusing to pay out. Incompetent, rude, arrogant, no knowledge and/or compliance with Gambling Commission regulations, most often they are docile, ignorant and are blatantly trying to illegally withhold my monies. Worst customer service I have encountered in 5 years of online betting. They are now asking for a copy of a card last used in October 2022 - which was replaced as per my current card by my bank so it was cut up - this card is nothing to do with this money and is from October 2022 - THEY HAVE A COPY OF MY CURRENT CARD - MY DRIVING LISENCE AND STILL THEY WONT PAY SAYING THEY WANT A STATEMENT NOW - nothing to do with my last deposit - using every excuse not to pay me - i have asked for a deadlock letter and now they are ignoring this too</p>
<p>I reminded them that the UKGC state: players must not be asked for information at the point they request a withdrawal from their account if the operator could reasonably have asked for this information at an earlier time.</p>
<p>so - can you clarify - is this your final response or deadlock letter to me? its so I can take my case straight to IBAS.</p>
