<p>Slovakia’s Office of Gambling Regulation is getting ready to publish new advertising standards for media outlets and gambling operators. The new rules will be introduced in a document called “Concept of Responsible Advertising.” The guidelines will primarily address the irrefutable need to bring improvement to the current gambling advertising regulations in the country.</p>
<p>The New Document – the Foundation for Fresh Control Mechanisms</p>
<p>The new document will serve as a source of information for all licensed operators in Slovakia regarding the new acceptable advertising standards in relation to the gambling services and products they offer. The same document will also be aimed at all media entities catering to the needs of consumers in the country.</p>
<p>Both gaming operators and stakeholders in the media industry have been asked to thoroughly obey the new guidelines and use them as the foundation for upcoming control and self-regulatory mechanisms. Some of the main goals of the fresh advertising rules refer to a strengthening of the government’s gambling regulatory objectives as well as the creation of a safer marketplace for domestic players.</p>
<p>Additionally, the new guidelines are meant to prevent gambling-related crimes while promoting public safety against gambling harms and problems. The Office of Gambling Regulation will also ask for periodical feedback on a series of practical comments from representatives in the industry, alongside operators and a number of third parties.</p>
<p>The Slovak Gambling Act Was Last Changed in 2019</p>
<p>The country’s Gambling Act was last changed in 2019 as a way of complying with the European Commission’s requirements regarding market competition. The new amendments brought in a few significant changes in the lives of Slovak players, including the elimination of online poker and casino options from the monopoly held by the national lottery operator TIPOS. Another big change that came into effect three years ago refers to the introduction of the Office of Gambling Regulation as the new licensing and regulatory body in the market. All industry incumbents need to have their domiciled businesses within the country’s borders in order to receive a license to function.</p>
<p>Slovak Gambling’s general director David Lenčéš called the fresh regulations “socially desirable” while reinforcing the need for responsible content and further arguing the need for the Concept of Responsible Advertising. The focus and overall content of gambling ads in the country need to follow a new direction, and the new document has been created precisely with this goal in mind.</p>
