    <h1>New Orleans Casino Hard Rock Hotel Casino Atlantic City Max Casino No Deposit Bonus Matrix Casino Sa</h1>

<p>Dear casino team,</p>
<p>According to point 8.19 of our T&amp;C – "1Bet may offer VIP service to certain loyal customers for a certain period of time. A VIP membership can only be purchased by official invitation. 1Bet has the right to discontinue the VIP service at any time at its sole discretion."</p>
<p>At the time of my registration and during my playing time, paragraph 8.19 was not in any terms and conditions, I have screenshots of the terms and conditions from the past. In the course of our correspondence with Mrs. Drommond, you have constantly adjusted your terms and conditions, I have proof of this. Both videos and screenshots. You can count on me having all the screenshots and videos of your terms and conditions. They would be right if that had been stated in their terms and conditions beforehand. But that was definitely not the case. Otherwise I would have been informed about it and would not have complained about VIP question for weeks, I read your terms and conditions the whole time. You could have mentioned that much earlier in correspondence with Mrs. Drommond, but you only made it up after I sent the screenshots with VIP.</p>
<p>What is noticeable in the screenshots you provided is that the email address used is from our regular support email and the logo we use is also that of regular support. For our VIP members we have specially set up communication channels in which the abbreviation VIP is always present in the title, in our emails and in signatures.</p>
<p>You cannot send me offers whose terms state that the offer provided is only for a limited number of VIP members and then emphasize that you were not messaged through the VIP channels. If you don't see me as a VIP, why did your VIP Account Manager message me or why did I receive this VIP offer via email?</p>
<p>According to our official records, you have not been invited to our VIP services by any official communication channel. Please also remember that all regular emails with special bonuses and other services are also sent to offer you a variety of different services, giving you a glimpse of the services that can be offered to VIP members as well.</p>
<p>That would be true if you had told me that in good time at the time, that was not the case and it was not stated anywhere that it is only an insight into the services of the VIP. Their VIP account manager wrote me for weeks via Whatsapp and made me the VIP offer official via email (see screenshots "This offer is only available for a limited number of VIP members"), as I mentioned above, it stood nowhere inside with the invite by the time of the complaint.</p>
<p>With that in mind, it is not a subject for different scenarios, even if you were a VIP player there is still a maximum win amount and it is by definition no higher amount than what has been mentioned in our official T&amp;Cs.</p>
<p>When your VIP account manager wrote to me, I told him twice that the bet and winnings limits were too limited, he wanted to look for a solution and said he would get back to me, but he didn't do it when I paid the high amount have paid in. While there is no official win limit adjustment, I would like to mention how pushy the VIP advisor was, I feel cheated/tricked in this regard. Your terms and conditions state that VIP customers can receive higher limits. However, no further details are given. How is the customer supposed to know?</p>
<p>I'm trying to find a solution here. How you treated me with VIP is evident in the evidence. Your employees or companies first make me feel like I'm a VIP with you and when I make big profits, I'm suddenly a normal customer.</p>
<p>I can log in all the time, but my account is still locked. I paid you twice.</p>
<p>Their evidence is based on claims that are not regulated anywhere and are made known afterwards. You have also changed the terms and conditions. My evidence documents are made irrelevant by your new terms and conditions.</p>
<p>The calculation made by your company is still unacceptable. Winnings are taken into account per day, losing is allowed. But the profits from the excess amounts were deducted from my account total balance. You have to take them off every day, that's what it says inside.</p>
<p>If your terms and conditions have a win limit of 100k per day, then I can win 100k that day. However, you cannot deduct the remaining amounts over 100k from my total balance.</p>
<p>If you look at the winnings individually per day, I am entitled to an amount of €236,048.90 without VIP.</p>
