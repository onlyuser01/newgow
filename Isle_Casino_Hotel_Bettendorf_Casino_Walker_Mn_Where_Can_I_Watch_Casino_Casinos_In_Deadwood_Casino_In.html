    <h1>Isle Casino Hotel Bettendorf Casino Walker Mn Where Can I Watch Casino Casinos In Deadwood Casino In</h1>

<p>I made a Bitcoin deposit of $26, as instructed by chat rep, in order to verify my account and proceed with a withdrawal of $80.</p>
<p>I started the deposit process on 12/30/22 and got the crypto address to make the deposit. Paypal is the wallet I use and it was down on the 30th so the transfer didn't occur until 12/31. I had several attempts at contacting the chat support because I wasn't seeing it posted to my account, but each time the chat would suddening close when I asked about it.</p>
<p>I finally reached someone that told me my deposit was rejected on 12/30/22 and asked me to send the transfer confirmation info to support@goldenladycasino.com. which I promptly did. At that time, I could see it was being held in the cryto address I was given by the casino. (This occurred on 1/1/23.)</p>
<p>By 1/2/23, the $26 had been transferred from the blockchain to the casino. However, I have not gotten any response from email support despite my follow up emails. Chat support is completely useless and routinely closes the chat. One even told me I could go ahead and make another deposit! Wow!</p>
<p>I'm including the last email I sent, which includes the transaction details, as well as other relevant screenshots.</p>
<p>I'm not sure how they would have rejected the deposit on 12/30 when I hadn't even been able to make the Bitcoin transfer until 12/31/22.</p>
<p>Any assistance you can provide would be very much appreciated.</p>
