<p>To this end, BETBY will work with Common Ground, a community center in Riga, Latvia, where the operator has a strong presence. The center is offering support to civilians who have been forced out of their homes because of the ongoing war in Ukraine, waged on the country by its belligerent neighbor, Russia.</p>
<p>BETBY to Work with Local Communities</p>
<p>BETBY and Common Ground will now work together to help refugees and asylum seekers to pick the skills they need to adapt to their new surroundings and integrate into local society. This humanitarian project reinforces BETBY’s own commitment to supporting people’s well-being and puts the company’s focus on giving back to local communities and working towards a healthy and caring society outside of its core business interest.</p>
<p>BETBY’s own team members have already become volunteers at the Common Ground center, providing aid to the displaced individuals and their families. BETBY head of human resources and culture Oksana Petrova welcomed this opportunity to see the company engage further with communities and help alleviate the pain and suffering of the people who have had to leave their homes due to the unprovoked invasion of their country:</p>
<p>This project will help us implement our social responsibility mission and have a real influence on society and helping those that have been affected by the war in Ukraine. We want to make a positive difference to people, even if it’s in a small way. We have seen wonderful engagement with our initiatives so far and we plan on significantly growing our partnership with Common Ground. BETBY Oksana Petrova</p>
<p>Support for Ukraine from the iGaming industry has been visible over the past year. Most recently, William Hill donated the proceedings of all Eurovision bets to the country. TVBET launched a Bet on Good Foundation to raise more funds for the war-torn country. Of course, there has been some grumbling in iGaming circles, with some exhibitions choosing to limit access for Belarusian and Russian iGaming companies.</p>
<p>Overall, the message has been clear with the industry rallying behind the victim of the attack, not its aggressor.</p>
