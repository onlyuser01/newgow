<p>The Swedish Gambling Industry Association (Spelbranschens Riksorganisation, SPER) has promoted senior adviser Maria Wennerberg Sedigh to the position of chief executive officer. Sedigh will use her rich expertise working in the gaming regulation field to grow and improve SPER’s activity and results.</p>
<p>Maria Wennerberg Sedigh Calls Her New Position a “Fun Assignment”</p>
<p>Wennerberg Sedigh commented on the news of her appointment, saying she feels excited and content to have won SPER’s trust. She is also looking forward to bringing her own contribution to the continuous growth of SPER’s activities in terms of consumer protection and self-regulation, calling the new task a “big and fun assignment”.</p>
<p>Wennerberg Sedigh, who is SPER’s representative in the National Board for Consumer Disputes has managed to gather no less than two impressive decades of experience in the gaming field under her belt, with special emphasis on gambling regulations as part of the SERP and the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<p>As head secretary in the Inquiry Secretary proposing fresh regulations for the gambling industry in the country, she victoriously obtained a new gambling law that changed the face of the industry at the beginning of 2019.</p>
<p>As senior adviser for the trade organization for gambling companies in Sweden, Wennerberg Sedigh worked with external monitoring, various advocacy groups, politicians, and the authorities. She also managed six SPER groups of gaming experts busy interpreting regulations and represented the association in the Swedish council for match-fixing led by the Gambling Authority. She was also part of the management team at the Swedish Gambling Authority that brought back limits on online gambling in January for five years, deputy director of the Ministry of Finance, and front desk officer for the Ministry of Communication as well as the Ministry of Defense.</p>
<p>SPER’s Board, “Extremely Happy” With the Decision</p>
<p>SPER’s chairman and Svenska Spelt’s chief executive officer, Patrik Hofbauer, expressed the board’s excitement that Wennerberg Sedigh will be the one who will replace Jenny Nilzon who has announced she will be leaving her position after spending five years in the lead. Hofbauer also added that Maria Wennerberg Sedigh’s one-of-a-kind expertise in the field will help the association move forward with a bright outlook ahead as a result of the fruitful collaboration. Wennerberg Sedigh will occupy her new position prior to SPER’s regular yearly member meeting that will be held at the end of March.</p>
