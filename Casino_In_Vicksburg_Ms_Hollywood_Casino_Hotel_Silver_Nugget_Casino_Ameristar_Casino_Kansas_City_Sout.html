    <h1>Casino In Vicksburg Ms Hollywood Casino Hotel Silver Nugget Casino Ameristar Casino Kansas City Sout</h1>

<p>I now got an email from them stating that I am in violation of their terms and conditions because after they denied my withdrawl at least twice and the money was being processed for a 3rd time they sent me an email for another bonus. So I was still hoping this casino was legit and maybe they sentbit to me for my troubles. I got on and did the bonus code just like it said to do, then done my playthru, of course no win that time but then they had denied my withdrawl again and deposited the $100 back into my account. That's when I reached out to you. Well after they told you they finally verified my identity and sent a rude email saying they were sorry for the inconvenience I caused their team but that my kyc was finally verified. I go back on to start the process for a 4th time and see they reattached a play thru to it. When asked about it they said I was in violation for taking a second bonus when not allowed. It was obviously allowed when they sent me the email to claim it, allowed me to claim it thru my account and allowed me to play thru it. They had expected me to keep going and play thru the returned withdrawl as well but I didn't. It actually wasn't even denied till after I finished that bonus and bit was denied for bogus kyc excuses. So now they are refusing to pay based on the fact that after I followed all the rules, was not in violation when every withdrawl attempt was made but somehow became in violation for an offer they brought to me after the fact, that somehow voids all winnings made before the supposed violation. Can they actually do that? I could see if it was after a violation but I was with the rules, terms and conditions when all this started and never would have attempt another bonus had they not sent me an email offering it to me and allowing it to work on my account. Most casinos won't send you a prompt for it nor will they let you have it if it's a violation.</p>
