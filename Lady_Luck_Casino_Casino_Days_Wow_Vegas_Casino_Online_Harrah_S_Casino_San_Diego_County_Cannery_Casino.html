<p>Caesars Sportsbook Releases NFL Win Totals, Kansas City and Baltimore Lead Way</p>
<p>Posted on: April 16, 2020, 12:38h.</p>

<p>The Caesars Sportsbook has unveiled NFL regular season over/under win totals for all 32 teams, and the Kansas City Chiefs and Baltimore Ravens lead the way at 12 wins each. The New Orleans Saints and San Francisco 49ers are next at 10.5, and Dallas Cowboys, Philadelphia Eagles, and Seattle Seahawks at 9.5.</p>

<p>Caesars has Tom Brady’s new team – the Tampa Bay Buccaneers – at nine wins, an over/under shared with the Buffalo Bills, Pittsburgh Steelers, and Minnesota Vikings.</p>
<p>Brady’s old team – the New England Patriots – open at 8.5 wins. That’s the Pats’ lowest preseason over/under win total since 2003.</p>
<p>My raw number on the Patriots is less than eight,” Caesars head oddsmaker Jeff Davis told ESPN. “Outside of the secondary, which is one of the best in the league, the rest of their roster I think is one of the worst in the NFL.”</p>
<p>FanDuel has Brady’s odds of taking the Bucs to the playoffs for the first time since 2007 at -154 (implied chance 60.63 percent). The Patriots’ odds of playing in the postseason for the 12th straight year, but first since 1997 without Brady, are at -200.</p>
<p>The NFL Playoffs this year are set to expand to 14 teams. A third Wild Card will be awarded in each conference, and only the two top seeds receive first-round byes.</p>
<p>At the bottom of Caesars’ over/under odds are the Jacksonville Jaguars and Washington Redskins, both at 4.5 wins. The Las Vegas Raiders are projected to win seven times in their new home.</p>
<p>Sports Climate</p>
<p>The NFL futures are assuming we’ll actually have an NFL season in 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic has halted all sports in America.</p>
<p>Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the federal government’s top medical expert in combating the coronavirus, said recently that sports could soon resume, but without fans. A poll conducted by Seton Hall University found that’s just fine with most sports fans, as 72 percent of respondents said they would not feel safe attending a game before a vaccine for the respiratory disease is available.</p>
<p>President Donald Trump wants sports to resume as soon as possible, saying this week that he’s “tired of watching baseball games that are 14 years old.”</p>
<p>NFL Outlook</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Trump opined that he believes the NFL regular season will begin on time. Whether medical experts, the NFL, and players agree could be a different story.</p>
<p>Online oddsmakers ask, “When will the NFL 2020 regular season start?” After September 13 is the favorite at -160, and “on or before September 13” the underdog at +120.</p>
<p>The Washington Post reported this week that the NFL is considering shortening its 17-week season. League sources said games will likely take place in empty or partially filled stadiums.</p>
<p>“The schedule is being done in such a way that builds in that flexibility,” a person familiar with the NFL’s planning told the Post. The NFL is expected to release its 2020 schedule no later than May 9.</p>
