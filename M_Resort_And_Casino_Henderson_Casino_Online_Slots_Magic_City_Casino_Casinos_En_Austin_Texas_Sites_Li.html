<p>Codere has announced that it’s allocating $300,000 in donations as part of its good cause campaign #CodereConEllas (#CodereWithHer) to support women’s football. The donation has been awarded to "She Wins," a non-government organization, which seeks to support and develop female football in Spain, Mexico and the LatAm region.</p>
<p>Both Codere and She Wins want to empower women and the gaming and betting giant is hoping to use sports and education to achieve this goal. This is a sentiment that She Wins shares with the firm, the NGO confirmed. Speaking on this occasion, Codere Online Coordinator of Social Networks in Mexico, Claudia Angélica Pacheco López, said that supporting local female football was a satisfying experience and that many of the company’s local partners were on the same page with the NASDAQ-listed firm.</p>
<p>Codere is already working with Real Madrid CF in Latin America to further the cause of involving more women in the game and helping them achieve their goals within the sport. López said that Codere shared values with local teams insofar as it sought to help women realize their football potential and pursue it more seriously in life.</p>
<p>Codere has been a vocal supporter of women’s rights throughout the company’s history. The CodereConEllas campaign has been ongoing and focused on creating more opportunities for female participation in athletic contests in a professional capacity.</p>
<p>The campaign has already been able to attract a lot of interest and backing from prominent figures. Codere stated that its local partners in the Latin American market and sports teams were just as eagerly engaged in promoting equality and inclusion of women into sport, which made the company glad to be working with such partners in the first place.</p>
<p>Codere is one of the most significant entities in the betting and gaming markets. It was the first company from the sector to be listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange, making history as it did. Meanwhile, the company has been expanding quickly through the Latin American market, with operational capacity now in Colombia and Uruguay, but also in other jurisdictions such as Mexico, Panama, Argentina, and elsewhere in Europe.</p>
