<p>After losing 6-1 to Newcastle last weekend, Tottenham Hotspur are trying to rebound. It won’t be easy as they’re facing Manchester United on Thursday, April 27</p>
<p>Both teams are in the Top 5 right now, but both have even higher ambitions. Manchester United want to keep on winning to overtake the No. 3 position of Newcastle. Tottenham, on the other hand, hope that they can get out of the pit in which they’ve been over the last couple of weeks. Otherwise, they could drop out of the “Euro” zone.</p>

<p>The Spurs are In a Horrible Situation</p>
<p>Antonio Conte left the Tottenham post after the 3-3 draw with Southampton. Since then, Cristian Stellini has been in charge and his record as the Spurs manager is 1-1-2. One of those two defeats was the blowout 6-1 loss to Newcastle.</p>
<p>Stellini will stay in the role of Tottenham’s manager until the end of the season, even though everyone seems to agree he’s not the right man for the job. Sure, he probably can’t mess things up royally in the remaining six Premier League rounds.</p>
<p>However, there is the danger that the Spurs might drop out of the Top 5, losing a spot in the Europa League. Right now, they’ve got only two points more than Aston Villa, who are just behind. Plus, Liverpool are also very close with three points fewer, as well as one game fewer than the Spurs. What this means is that Stellini and his boys need to start winning points ASAP.</p>
<p>Man United 100% Focused on English Competitions</p>
<p>Man United are out of the Europa League after suffering a humiliating defeat to Seville. However, the Red Devils have reached the final of the FA Cup, where they will take on their city rivals, Manchester City. In the Premier League, they’re in the No. 4 position with 59 points.</p>
<p>That’s the same number of points as Newcastle, who are in third place. But Man United have played one game fewer than the Magpies, meaning that if they beat Tottenham on Thursday, they’re going to get to the No. 3 position.</p>
<p>So, can they beat the Spurs? Well, they’re in much better shape than Tottenham, but they will miss several of their first-team players in the next match – Alejandro Garnacho, Donny van de Beek, Scott McTomminay, Bruno Fernandes, and Raphael Varane.</p>
<p>Tottenham vs Manchester United Prediction</p>
<p>The Spurs are going to defend with all they got as their No. 1 goal for this game is to prevent another horrible loss. The Red Devils, on the other hand, are going for the win in this game. It’s not going to be a big one, but we’re certain they’re going to pull it off.</p>
<p>Pick: Manchester United to win &amp; under 2.5 goals</p>
