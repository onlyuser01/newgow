<p>Andrade cited as the favorite against Namajunas</p>
<p>Silva to fight Cannonier after the loss to Adesanya</p>
<p>The game costs $30 to watch on ESPN+ for new subscribers</p>
<p>UFC 237 will take place in Jeunesse Arena, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil tomorrow, Saturday, May 11. The event will be headlined by the fight between Rose Namajunas and Jessica Andrade with the straweight title on the line.</p>
<p>UFC 237 Predictions: Andrade vs Namajunas</p>
<p>Jessica Andrade and Rose Namajunas are not naturally born enemies. Still, Namajunas has a title that Andrade wants and this is the pivotal point for UFC 237 which will be taking place in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on Saturday, May 11.</p>
<p>Andrade had a crack at the title versus the former Polish champion, Joanna Jedrzejczyk. Jedrzejczyk defeated Andrade twice, but she yielded before Namajunas who is now cited as the underdog in the fight against Andrade.</p>
<p>Both fighters seem confident about the upcoming game and they approach it with determination. Yet, you won’t seen Andrade or Namajunas taunting each other as most UFC fighters do. There is respect, and this will be a defining moment of the upcoming game.</p>
<p>Instead of having fighters punch the life out of each other, both Namajunas and Andrade will probably try to achieve a more technical victory. Andrade is the more aggressive one and she has a good grappling technique, but we know how quick and assault-driven Namajunas is as well.</p>
<p>When Andrade gets in close to an opponent she can force a takedown and win by submission. At the same time, Namajunas’ fight style has approved immensely since she first debuted in UFC, meaning Andrade will be threatened by a far more refined opponent that she expects.</p>
<p>Not only that, but Namajunas managed to pry the title away from Jedrzejczyk which makes it even more dangerous to Andrade.</p>
<p>Anderson Silva vs Jared Cannonier: UFC 237</p>
<p>The game between Namajunas and Andrade is not the only one worth looking into. After Anderson Silva’s loss to Israel Adesanya, the fighter has been trying to get a foothold back in UFC. He is not in his prime any more and facing a younger challenger in Jared Cannonier.</p>

<p>Yet, it’s fair to say that both are equally matched opponents capable of impressive play. Silva is a native in Brazil, so he might have a slight edge over his opponent enjoying the home advantage. Silva is one of the more composed fighter out there.</p>
<p>You can say that it’s age, but he has always showed appreciation for his opponents, which means that he will play with confidence and tact.</p>
<p>If pressed, we will definitely bet on both Andrade and Silva:</p>
<p>Anderson Silva +110</p>
<p>Jessica Andrade -130</p>
<p>The game will cost $30 for new subscribers to watch at ESPN+, Business Insider reports.</p>
