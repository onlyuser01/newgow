<p>Adult Entertainment Expo Brings the Sin to Sin City</p>

<p>The Annual AVN Adult Entertainment Expo kicks off in Las Vegas this week with plenty of risque business</p>
<p>Las Vegas has built its legacy on not only its casinos, but on the promise – overt or otherwise – of sex, drugs and rock n’ roll. While ironically prostitution is, in fact, illegal in Clark County – the county in which Las Vegas sits – few people realize this and most assume that sex is anywhere and everywhere. And they’re not entirely wrong, either – wink, wink, nudge, nudge.</p>
<p>Annual AVN Awards Show</p>
<p>So where else would the Adult Video News (AVN) Awards show up each year but Sin City? It’s the perfect marriage of one illicit industry with another, and each enhances the other’s reputation, if only by association. And with it comes the Adult Entertainment Expo (AEE), where you can see just about anything – and we do mean anything.</p>
<p>If you happen to be in town this week, head on down to the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino for the 2014 awards show and all its ancillary debauchery; starting January 15, some 300,000 attendees will crowd Las Vegas, either directly participating or hoping to catch a glimpse of their favorite porn star(s), up close and personal.</p>
<p>It will be four days that center around four key events; as well as an industry trade show that encompasses everything from “pleasure” products to porn producers hawking their wares and doing the shmooze. Think of it as Hollywood without the slightest pretext of artistry for those nude scenes.</p>
<p>Super Educational</p>
<p>Or – for those who want a more legit convention vibe – you can even attend seminars, things with topics such as “Porn Goes to College,” “Avoiding the Blues After ‘Fifty Shades of Grey’ Fades” and “The Feminist Porn Mystique”. And don’t forget those stage shows – billed only as “sexy” – but given that sexy stage shows go on 24/7/365 in Las Vegas at numerous so-called gentlemen’s clubs around town – these ones would have to deliver a little more than sexy to hold their own.</p>
<p>At the smaller but parallel AVN Novelty Expo – which runs one day short of the Expo, ending on the 17th – you can find all manner of racy lingerie, sexual aids, supplements to fire up your loins, and every manner of aphrodisiacs, makeup, condoms, and – ahem – accessories for the bold and beaudacious among you.</p>
<p>The company names alone are worth the price of admission. Names like Digital Sin, Bootiful Butt Enhancement Cream, SweetSpot Labs and the infamous Fleshlight are among more than 50 companies that will be trying to land your business this year. Apparently, sex sells – literally.</p>
<p>Finally, there’s the ever-popular AVN Fan Fest, where 300+ well-known porn stars will appear from January 16-18 to sign autographs and pose for photos (we’re not sure in what state of dress or undress). There’s also something we are afraid to know too much about called “The Lair” – -which is described as being specially designed for the kinkier attendees, leaving us guessing that whips, chains, and all manner of freaky fetish activity will be going on.</p>
<p>Or if you want something a little less potentially painful, how about some Porn Star Karaoke or Porn Star Beer Pong? Surprisingly, turns out almost anything is more fun when you add the word “porn” in front of it.</p>
