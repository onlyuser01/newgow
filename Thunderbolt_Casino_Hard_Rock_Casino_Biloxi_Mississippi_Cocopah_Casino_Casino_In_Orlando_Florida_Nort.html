    <h1>Thunderbolt Casino Hard Rock Casino Biloxi Mississippi Cocopah Casino Casino In Orlando Florida Nort</h1>

<p>Pragmatic Play has announced that it will launch its products with Casino Epic, an iGaming operator owned and operated by Sweden-focused company Kanon Gaming. The partnership will grant Casino Epic access to a sizable chunk of Pragmatic Play’s portfolio where they can access excellent and popular player-favorite titles such as Barn Festival, Wolf Gold, John Hunter, and the Quest for Bermuda Riches, as well as Gates of Olympus.</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play Adds Live and Slot Experiences</p>
<p>Apart from slots, Pragmatic Play will contribute with its portfolio of live dealer games, including Blackjack, Baccarat, and its unique Mega Roulette. Pragmatic Play has been actively building up its commercial footprint, signing with a number of established names in the iGaming industry over the past weeks.</p>
<p>Those include Begame, Palms Bet, and Maxbet, all accomplished recently. Commenting on this partnership, Pragmatic Play chief business development officer Yossi Barzely said that bringing the products live in Sweden was an excellent opportunity for Pragmatic to continue expanding in a key regulated market. He further added:</p>
<p>“As one of Europe’s most mature markets, our titles are always received well there, and finding more partners to bring our games to players in the region is something we continue to strive for. We really look forward to this positive relationship.” Pragmatic Play chief business development officer Yossi Barzely</p>
<p>Welcomed Opportunity for Everyone Involved</p>
<p>Kanon Gaming CRM manager Jennifer Wiljen added that Pragmatic Play’s slots and live casino offer are a globally-recognized product that stands to significantly boost Casino Epic’s own offering and portfolio options. Wiljen said:</p>
<p>“Through the single API integration, we’re able to add products swiftly and quickly scale the potential of the deal, which is something that allows Pragmatic Play to stand out through its numerous product tranches.” Kanon Gaming CRM manager Jennifer Wiljen</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play is chugging along at a good production pace these days. It’s producing six new slot titles a month and works hard on live and bingo games. It also offers a single API to ease integration and product adoption by newly signed partners. Previously, Pragmatic Play also inked a content deal with bet365. The company released some notable titles this month as well, including Goblin Heist Power Nudge and Fire Strike 2.</p>
