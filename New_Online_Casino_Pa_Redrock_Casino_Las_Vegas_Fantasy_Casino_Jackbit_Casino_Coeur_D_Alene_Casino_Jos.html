    <h1>New Online Casino Pa Redrock Casino Las Vegas Fantasy Casino Jackbit Casino Coeur D Alene Casino Jos</h1>

<p>Pariplay Ltd, a leading aggregator in the iGaming industry, has appointed Jose Micallef as its new Business Development Director.</p>
<p>Jose Micallef’s know-how will boost Pariplay’s plans</p>
<p>As Pariplay continues its global expansion through partnerships with leading operators and game studios worldwide, Jose Micallef will lead the company’s strategic operations. His rich experience includes a similar position at NetEnt and 7 years at B3W group. His industry’s know-how will serve as a boost for Pariplay as the company grows in the United States and other regulated markets.</p>
<p>Pariplay CCO Christine Lewis said that the company’s platform reaches more than 16 regulated markets on a global scale, and by signing a few strategic partnerships, the company wants to move forward while keeping its momentum. She said that appointing Micallef as the new Business Development Director at Pariplay will further optimize its strategy in these exciting times.</p>
<p>FusionTM platform makes the industry sit up and take notice</p>
<p>Pariplay’s extensive portfolio includes thousands of titles from leading developers in the industry, along with its host of proprietary slots on its FusionTM platform.</p>
<p>Micaleff, now-Business Development Director at Pariplay, said: “Pariplay’s work in expanding the reach of its comprehensive FusionTM platform has made many in the industry sit up and take notice.” He also stated that he is looking forward to joining the company’s dynamic team, recognized for their hard work and ability to resonate with players in regulated markets worldwide.</p>
<p>Pariplay recently welcomed Gamshy Games to its Fusion aggregator platform. With Gamshy’s selected state-of-the-art games, Pariplay’s portfolio became even more appealing. Some of Gamshy’s player-favorite titles are Jumping Sushi, Inferno, Western Barn, and Fruit Tribe. All of them are available on Pariplay’s platform. With Fusion, Pariplay exposes its partners to new audiences offering a powerful gateway to new customers.</p>
<p>At the end of 2020, Pariplay strengthened its ties with Valiant, signing a three-year extension to their partnership. Under the deal, Valiant allowed Pariplay to release Valiant’s branded games. Pariplay has stated that Valiant’s games are very popular among players, and the company is happy to continue the mutually beneficial partnership.</p>
