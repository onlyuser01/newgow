<p>The recently secured license from the West Virginia Lottery enables the company to distribute its portfolio of premium online casino games</p>
<p>The provider of premium online games, Hacksaw Gaming, continues to expand its North American footprint after securing a new license. The company confirmed Wednesday that it secured a full supplier license for the regulated gambling market in West Virginia. The recent license, awarded by the West Virginia Lottery, effectively allows Hacksaw Gaming to distribute its engaging and unique portfolio of games to operators in the state.</p>
<p>Thanks to the license, fan-favorite online slot games such as Wanted Dead or a Wild, Hand of Anubis and Gladiator Legends, among others, will become available to online casino operators in West Virginia. The new gaming supplier license complements the company’s expansion and enables it to grow in an important US gambling market.</p>
<p>Marcus Cordes, Hacksaw Gaming’s CEO, highlighted the importance of the company’s entry into the United States. He acknowledged that this entry represents an important milestone for the company and complements its growth seen in other jurisdictions such as Canada and Europe.</p>
<p>Cordes praised the strong ambition and hard work of Hacksaw Gaming’s team which played a key role in the US entry. Additionally, the iGaming developer’s CEO predicted that its games that provide unique themes, mechanics and concepts will be well received by online casino players.</p>
<p>“Entering the US, a nation with a rich gaming heritage, represents a huge milestone in our relatively short lifespan, building on the good work we have made across Europe and Canada over the previous months.“ Marcus Cordes, CEO at Hacksaw Gaming</p>
<p>Recently, Hacksaw Gaming signed a deal with Rush Street Interactive (RSI). That collaboration enabled the company to deliver its games to BetRivers’ customers in Ontario, Canada.</p>
<p>The Online Casino Content Supplier Continues to Expand</p>
<p>Speaking about the market in West Virginia, Cordes explained that it has seen significant growth since the regulation of online gambling. He outlined that Hacksaw Gaming is delighted to deliver its games to customers in West Virginia and help expand further the iGaming market in the state.</p>
<p>According to Cordes, the company’s entry in West Virginia marks a milestone moment in its growth in the US. “We’ll be aiming to expand our US presence across additional states by teaming up with a number of tier-one operators in the coming months,” he explained in conclusion.</p>
<p>Besides West Virginia and Ontario, Hacksaw Gaming is currently certified by the UKGC and the MGA. Additionally, the company holds licenses in Sweden, the Netherlands, Latvia, Italy, as well as Greece and Romania. The latest US-facing license complements its growth and enables Hacksaw Gaming to continue to expand on a global scale.</p>
