<p>Playtech and Enlabs negotiated a poker network partnership as Enlabs has chosen to withdraw from GG Network and join the iPoker Network instead.</p>
<p>Enlabs Signs Poker Network Partnership with Playtech</p>
<p>Sweden-based online gaming company, Enlabs AB, has announced that is parting ways with the GG poker network to join Playtech’s iPoker Network instead. The company will be finalizing its integration with Playtech in the summer, the official press release stated.</p>
<p>Housing over 200 employees across seven offices in Stockholm, Riga, Malta, Minsk and elsewhere, poker has been a fast-developing vertical within Enlabs AB’s operations. Moving forward, Enlabs will consolidate its footprint in the Baltics, and a key aspect of this strategy is the successful integration with Playtech’s iPoker Network.</p>
<p>Enlabs has been working with GG Network for years, with the network expanding beyond its traditional bastion in Asia to spearhead a global effort that has saw a number of important partners added over the years. Earlier this year, GGPoker and WSOP collaborated to host the WSOP Circuit Online Series.</p>
<p>The company, i.e. Enlabs, gave no reasons as to why the change and choice of a new poker network supplier had been necessary. However, Enlabs is going to soon launch poker on its Sweden-facing brands Optibet and Bestpoker.</p>
<p>While no specific timeframe has been given, Enlabs assured in the press release that the move is imminent this summer. Previously, OlyBet opted out of MPN and joined GGPoker, following the news of the company’s planned network shut-down.</p>
<p>Ensuring the Quality of the Experience</p>
<p>Enlabs may have not given reasons for parting ways with GG Network, but it didn’t save superlatives for the iPoker Network. Maskims Gorbacs, Enlabs Chief of Poker, Enlabs expressed the company’s determination to be at the forefront of developments, providing Enlabs’ player base with the necessary “stable and high-quality products.”</p>
<p>Gorbacs felt confident that the iPoker Network is well-equipped to provide players with an array of features perfectly fit to users’ expectations. By making the shift towards iPoker Network, Enlabs would be able to provide players with a cutting-edge and well-rounded experience, the press release clarified.</p>
<p>Enlabs CEO George Ustinov took to the developments positively, sharing the company’s excitement to be joining forces with a flagship entertainment brand. He further emphasized on key qualities of the product such as fairness, safety and an overall satisfactory poker experience.</p>
<p>The partnership has a further twist, as Enlabs and Playtech will also collaborate in the casino and live casino verticals, boosting synergies further. iPoker has been a viable pick for many brands withdrawing from the Microgaming Poker Network which closes today.</p>
