<p>The expanded deal will allow BetGames' content to enter emerging markets in Eastern Europe, Africa and Latin America</p>
<p>Supplier of live-dealer betting games BetGames announced its ongoing partnership with QTech Games has been expanded to include the Rest of the World (RoW) and help the game distributor increase its global reach into new territories.</p>
<p>Widening the Reach of the Partnership</p>
<p>The expanded agreement between BetGames and QTech Games will allow the Asian-based game distributor to widen its BetGames remit to include RoW distribution of the supplier’s portfolio of live-dealer gaming content that has already grabbed the attention of Asian players.</p>
<p>Commenting on the new arrangement, Daniel Long, chief commercial officer at QTech Games was delighted to see the partnership grow to now allow the distribution of BetGames content outside Asia, honored from the trust to utilize BetGames’ distribution rights across markets the people at QTech Games know “like the back of [their] hand.”</p>
<p>“BetGames is a constant force and source of vibrant, varied and visually stunning games which raise the bar for live-dealer content,” Long added, hailing this new expansion of QTech Games’ premium platform across markets outside Asia, many of which would be new for the live-dealer games supplier.</p>
<p>The expanded partnership will allow QTech Games’ platform which already has the entire BetGames’ gaming portfolio incorporated into it to showcase globally games classics such as Wheel of Fortune and Bet on Baccarat that have gained popularity across a number of demographics and geographies.</p>
<p>Adamant that “delivering the finest and most engaging iGaming experiences is a hallmark” of QTech Games’ platform and that live-dealer games represent a key vertical in delivering on this objective, Long was thrilled to add BetGames “as a key component” of the platform’s “live-casino arsenal.”</p>
<p>Riding On the Back of the Fastest-Growing Distributor</p>
<p>Headquartered in Vilnius, Lithuania, BetGames established itself as one of the most innovative suppliers of live-dealer games, offering a unique and immersive experience, ease of use and high bet rates. The supplier features a team of over 250 talented personnel and utilizes a hub in Malta.</p>
<p>On behalf of BetGames, vice president of Europe, Asia and the Americas, John-Paul Rowland, hailed QTech Games as “a renowned and respected distributor with an impressive customer base” that has impressed everyone at BetGames with its work in Asia and influenced the expansion of the agreement to include RoW.</p>
<p>“The enlarged deal with QTech Games can build on our ongoing success together, given that this aggregator and platform provider has routinely demonstrated its credentials as a great judge of online casino content to both established and emerging markets,” Rowland said, confident that this partnership will bring benefits to BetGames.</p>
<p>As the thriving live-dealer domain continues to gather pace globally, BetGames is looking forward to expanding its footprint via the fastest-growing games distributor across various emerging markets from Eastern Europe, Africa and Latin America where QTech Games has a significant presence.</p>
