<p>Richmond Bets Double or Nothing on Casino, as City Seeks Second Referendum</p>

<p>If the Richmond City Council has its way, residents in the Virginia capital will be asked again about a nearly $600 million casino resort that they previously rejected.</p>

<p>Richmond voters narrowly rejected ONE Casino + Resort last year, a $565 million resort project that would have put a casino adjacent to the Philip Morris tobacco plant along I-95. The rejected local ballot referendum, councilmembers argue, cost the city 1,500 good-paying permanent jobs. It also nixed an immediate one-time $25 million payment from the resort development group and an estimated $30 million in new annual tax revenue.</p>
<p>The potential benefits, the council concluded, far outweigh the potential societal harms opponents have argued, such as gambling addiction and crime. That’s why the City Council last night voted 8-1 in favor of proceeding with a second vote on the casino proposal. Councilor Katherine Jordan was the lone dissenter, the 2nd District rep saying she simply opposes gambling.</p>
<p>Urban One, a Black-focused media conglomerate headquartered in Silver Spring, Md., and Peninsula Pacific Entertainment, a California-based casino company that owns and operates six Rosie’s Gaming Emporiums and Colonial Downs Racetrack in Virginia, are behind the ONE Casino venture. The partnered companies plan to sign a new development and host agreement with Richmond in order to initiate a second ballot vote.</p>
<p>Tax Break Floated</p>
<p>Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney (D) is supportive of the city asking residents for a second time to back a commercial casino resort undertaking. In hopes of winning over some of the 2021 “no” votes, the mayor has proposed a two-cent reduction to the city’s real estate tax rate if the measure passes.</p>
<p>Stoney says minorities in the city took the failed casino vote personally, many claiming that they don’t feel welcomed to be part of the region’s economic future.</p>
<p>ONE Casino was set to be the first Black-owned commercial casino resort in the United States. Along with Urban One, the ownership structure was to include 50 investors who identify as minorities.</p>
<p>Election results showed that wealthier neighborhoods north of the James River heavily opposed the casino, while more minority-rich communities on the southside overwhelmingly support the project.</p>
<p>Of the approximately 77,000 votes cast on ONE Casino, the final tally was separated by only 1,500 votes in favor of rejecting the project.</p>
<p>Alfred Liggins, Urban One CEO, says the company will do a better job of promoting the economic and community benefits of voting in favor of his casino, should a revote occur.</p>
<p>Obstacles Remain</p>
<p>Opponents argue that Richmond trying to hold a second referendum is undemocratic. State Sen. Joe Morrissey (D-Richmond) voted in favor of ONE Casino last year. But he is now working on the state level to pass a law that would allow nearby Petersburg to hold a casino referendum and relocate Richmond’s unissued gaming license south to the town.</p>
<p>Morrissey’s bill also seeks to prohibit Richmond from asking residents again on the gaming matter.</p>
<p>Richmond community activist Allan-Charles Chipman told the Richmond Times-Dispatch that a second vote wrongly takes a page out of the casino industry playbook to “defy the expressed will of the people.”</p>
<p>“While double or nothing is an acceptable tool for someone who lost a bet in the casino, it is not an acceptable option for the members of this body who lost a bet on a casino,” Chipman told the council yesterday evening.</p>
