<p>Betfair New Jersey Online Poker Operations End, Casino Games Remain</p>

<p>While Betfair Poker’s disastrous performance in New Jersey is something of a mystery, at least the company has a massive global online casino operation to fall back on. (Image: betfair.com)</p>
<p>Betfair’s poorly performing online poker site has become the second to leave the New Jersey online poker space since the state regulated Internet gaming just over a year ago.</p>
<p>Betfair follows Ultimate Gaming out of the market as a result of the wild underachievement of its poker platform; however, unlike Ultimate, which ceased all its operations shortly after leaving New Jersey, the UK-based betting exchange still has a healthy online casino in the state and has reported this week that its global operations are going full steam ahead.</p>
<p>Why Did it Fail?</p>
<p>It’s difficult, on the surface, to understand just why Betfair’s poker platform failed so miserably. The company reported taking just $50 in rake during the first 10 months of 2014 at a time when Party/Borgata was reporting $1 million per month in revenue. In September, Betfair took just $1 (yep, a single buck) in rake and then, in October, nothing at all.</p>
<p>Although it may not be a hugely recognizable brand in America, it’s a well-known and trusted company worldwide, and as a skin of the Ongame Network, albeit the only one in New Jersey, Betfair possesses tried, tested, and reliable software.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the poker room had one of the most competitive promotional schemes in the market, with a sign-up bonus equivalent to some 40 percent in rakeback and a VIP rewards with a value equal to 20 percent at the top level. And, with a poker platform linked to a healthy online casino platform, which, in October took a reported $856,000 in gross gaming revenue, the mystery deepens.</p>
<p>No Picnic in the Garden State</p>
<p>It has been far from smooth sailing for Betfair in New Jersey. It launched its iGaming operations there in November 2013, initially partnering with the now-defunct Trump Plaza. When, in mid-July, is was announced that the Plaza would be closed, Betfair found itself in a sticky situation: as part of New Jersey regulations, online gambling companies must ally themselves with existing land-based operators in order to offer their services in the state.</p>
<p>However, the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement (NJDGE) ruled that Betfair’s agreement had been with Trump Entertainment, not just the Plaza, and therefore the company’s servers could find a new home at the Trump Taj Mahal. The relief was short-lived, though, as in September, Trump Entertainment announced it would file for bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Betfair has since formed a relationship with Caesars, albeit through a temporary transactional waiver granted by the DGE, valid for just six months, while it seeks a more permanent arrangement.</p>
<p>Hope and Change (as in, Cha-Ching)</p>
<p>Elsewhere, though, things are going better for Betfair.</p>
<p>The company posted its biannual results this week, announcing a 51 percent rise in earnings for the period, to £73.9 million ($116 million). This has allowed Betfair to give its shareholders a £200 million ($313 million) Christmas present. Betfair said these record results are down to a growth in its customer base, which it attributes to a strategy of withdrawing from unregulated markets and trying to attract new users with its traditional sports book product.</p>
<p>The company also cited a string of favorable sports results, including good profits from this year’s World Cup, as reasons for the spike in revenue.</p>
