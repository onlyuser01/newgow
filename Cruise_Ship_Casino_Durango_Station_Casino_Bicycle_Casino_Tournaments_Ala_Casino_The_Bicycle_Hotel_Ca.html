<p>Swiss betting and gambling regulator ESBK has added Sportsbet.io to its list of blacklisted operators earlier this week. So far, 285 domains have been banned under the country’s hardline regulatory policy on foreign gaming and betting entities.</p>
<p>Sportsbet.io Now on Switzerland’s Betting Firms Blacklist</p>
<p>The Swiss Federal Casino Commission (ESBK) has added Sportsbet.io – one of Coingaming Group’s flagship blockchain betting brands – to its blacklist. This comes as part of a broader move undertaken by the Swiss regulator to minimize the penetration of foreign gambling brands in the country.</p>
<p>ESBK blacklisted 36 entities earlier this week. Among those were other trusted brands, such as CampoBet, Lucky Bird Casino, Bob Casino, and others. As a result, domestic internet service providers (ISPs) are now legally obliged to suspend access to blacklisted websites.</p>
<p>IPS will use a do-not-serve (DNS) service to block traffic to these websites. In case of failure to comply with the blacklist, the responsible parties would be trialed under the country’s Swiss Money Gaming Act. Further to that list, the country’s telecommunications regulator, Comlot, runs a dedicated blacklist of its own to help limit access to non-licensed operators.</p>
<p>Sportsbet.io is not the only high-profile and reputable brand to have been blacklisted by the Swiss regulatory watchdog. Previously, bet365 was also suspended. Overall, there are over 285 domains that are off-limits for Swiss residents.</p>
<p>However, other industry bid players have been capable of securing an entry into the country. Thanks to the Swiss Money Gaming Act, country-based operators may expand and offer online gaming solutions.</p>
<p>Several big names in the iGaming industry, including Evolution and Playtech, have signed partnerships with Grand Casino Baden Baden and Swiss Casinos respectively.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the ESBK has been busy expanding the current number of operators in the country. Earlier this year, the Swiss National Council approved licenses for Casino Lugano and Casino du Lac Meyrin. The brands later obtained approval from the ESBK.</p>
