    <h1>New York City Casino Casino Games Online Real Money Durango Casino Jobs Seven Clans Casino Thief Riv</h1>

<p>A person who presented himself as a financial advisor and a life coach in Las Vegas was sentenced to one year in prison after allegedly using investment money for gambling. As announced by KLAS, Rodney Buckle, 66, was sentenced this week Thursday by Clark County District Court Judge Jasmin Lilly Spells. His punishment is one year in jail followed by probation. Additionally, Buckle, who reportedly ran a Ponzi scheme, was also ordered to pay $283,000 in restitution.</p>
<p>According to investigators from the Nevada Secretary of State’s Office, the 66-year-old was operating multiple businesses. The list included organizations with the names “Rodd One,” “Rodd United,” and “Rodd U.” He reportedly presented himself as a financial advisor and a life coach. Advertisements online helped promote Buckle’s businesses. Despite running those businesses and presenting himself as a financial advisor, Buckle did not hold a federal or state certification.</p>
<p>Aaron D. Ford, Nevada’s Attorney General, revealed that the 66-year-old defrauded a number of victims between February 2014 and October 2016. Most of Buckle’s victims were elderly. In a statement on the topic, Ford condemned people who engage in deceiving practices for personal gain. “Fraudsters exploiting hardworking Nevadans will continue to face investigation and prosecution by my office,” added Ford.</p>
<p>“To deceive and manipulate others, and worse our seniors, for personal gain is both immoral and illegal.“ Aaron D. Ford, Nevada Attorney General</p>
<p>The Financial Advisor Wagered on Sports with Investors’ Money</p>
<p>According to investigators, Buckle had accumulated some $2.4 million in sports betting wagers at Westgate Hotel and Casino. While the venue banned the self-proclaimed financial advisor and life coach, he had already lost some $76,000 there.</p>
<p>At another venue, the South Point Casino, he reportedly placed some $444,000 in wagers. Out of that total, Buckle lost some $434,000, investigators said.</p>
<p>The investigators revealed that “investment” sums collected by Buckle were between $100 and more than $700,000. They said the 66-year-old kept the details of his investor clients in a spreadsheet that contained their names along with the invested sum.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in Nevada, an Idaho resident was arrested last week after he allegedly pulled a knife on a police officer at the Cactus Petes Resort Casino in Jackpot. The 41-year-old was detained on multiple charges with police uncovering outstanding warrants against him.</p>
