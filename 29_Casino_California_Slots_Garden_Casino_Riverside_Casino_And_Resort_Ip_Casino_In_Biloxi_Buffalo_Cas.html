<p>Secure and licensed</p>
<p>Bovada Casino has a slick new look after the website has undergone a recent design overhaul a few years back. If anything, Bovada has introduced consistent improvements and hotfixes to its user interface to make it more appealing. The casino officially launched in 2011 and it has been one of the main suppliers of gaming entertainment to US players.</p>
<p>Today, the casino offers hundreds of awesome slots and over 300 games in total. That number is quickly increasing. The casino has partnered with multiple game developers to ensure variety and a unique gaming edge, and you will find Bovada Casino to be one of the best for US players.</p>
<p>The team behind the brand welcomes players to a variety of online slot machines, card games, and a dedicated live studio. Bovada had to step into the US market when Bodog, the casino’s sister website owned by the same company, Mohawk Morris Gaming Group, had to retrieve.</p>
<p>There is a lot I would like to say about Bovada.lv today. The website is an absolute delight and works great on both desktop and mobile. I believe my Bovada Casino review will help you find out everything there is to know about the casino. If you do have some questions that my review hasn’t covered, I encourage you to get in touch with the website’s 24/7 support service.</p>
<p>Bovada Casino Welcome Bonus and Promotions</p>
<p>Bovada Casino’s offer is extensive, to say the least. The casino has a dedicated selection of bonuses that will fit any player’s taste. You will be able to pick from a bonus for every situation, including:</p>
<p>$3,750 Bitcoin Casino Bonus</p>
<p>Refer a Friend</p>
<p>$3,000 Welcome Bonus</p>
<p>Reward Points</p>
<p>$25 Bitcoin Referral bonus</p>
<p>Each promotion is unique and provides slightly different perks. You will notice that that the casino lets you choose the bonus you like best. Below, I will review Bovada Casino promos to help you make up your mind and start with the type of bonus you deserve.</p>
<p>I recommend you guys don’t forget to read the terms and conditions before you make your choice, as these may change from time to time, and it’s best to be on the safe side. In any event, Bovada has quite a reputation for delivering consistently great promotions, and here is why.</p>
<p>Your $3,750 Bitcoin Welcome Bonus</p>
<p>Players who have become part of the Bitcoin revolution will find Bovada Casino a perfect venue where you can use your BTC to play your favorite online slots, table games, video poker, and live dealer games. The $3,750 Bitcoin bonus comes in three separate installments to make it easier for you to claim.</p>
<p>Each deposit is matched at 125% up to $1,250. For your first deposit, you will need to use the BTCCWB1250 bonus code and for your second and deposit bonus code, there is BTC2NDCWB.</p>
<p>Deposit Bonus Code Information 1st Deposit BTCCWB1250 125% match up to $1,250 2nd and 3rd Deposit BTC2NDCWB 125% match up to $1,250</p>
<p>Another upside here is that Bovada Casino has decent playthrough requirements. You will need to deposit each deposit and bonus amount 25 times before you can withdraw any funds thereof. One minor drawback is that you cannot use the bonus funds to play Live Dealer Games, but I will come back to this in a bit.</p>
<p>$3,000 Welcome Bonus for FIAT Players</p>
<p>Now, if you prefer to play with FIAT money that is perfectly fine. The total bonus amount you can claim is a little smaller, but I don’t hold this to be a particular drawback of this offer. You will be able to claim the full amount of the bonus across three deposits once again.</p>
<p>Deposit Bonus Code Information 1st Deposit NEWWELCOME 100% match up to $1,000 2nd and 3rd Deposit BV2NDCWB 100% match up to $1,000</p>
<p>Your first deposit will be matched at 100% up to $1,000 and activated by depositing $20 and punching in the NEWWELCOME bonus code. For your second and third deposit, you will need to use the BV2NDCWB welcome bonus.</p>
<p>Get Your Friends on Board</p>
<p>If you want to get a $100 referral bonus, all you need to do is to navigate to your account and find the special referral code that is unique to your account. Your friend will get a 200% deposit up to $100, and benefit from an extra $25 if the deposit is made in Bitcoin. I find the referral system to be quite intuitive and easy to follow, allowing you to bring your friends on board in no time.</p>
<p>Treat Yourself with Bovada Casino’s Rewards</p>
<p>Like any casinos expecting to encourage loyalty, Bovada Casino has spent some time working out on its loyalty program. The loyalty program is all about balance and the amount you stake will circle back to you in one form or another. Every dollar you bet will allow you to get something out of the casino thanks to the Loyalty Program.</p>
<p>For each dollar you bet on video poker and table games, you will get 1 reward point. When you bet on slots, you will get 5 reward points instead. Specialty games will even bring you 15 reward points per dollar bet. Here is a full table as to how to earn points at Bovada:</p>
<p>Game Amount Spent Reward Points Earned Video Poker $1 1 Table Games $1 1 Slot Games $1 5 Specialty Games $1 15</p>
<p>*Please note that Live Dealer games do not contribute reward points.</p>
<p>If you want to use your points to redeem cash, the current redeem rate is 2,500 RP. The loyalty program comes with a bunch of levels, including Starter, Rookie, Pro, All-Star, Legend, Hall of Fame. As you scale up through the levels, you will get better synergies and enjoy a much better redemption rate of your reward points.</p>
<p>Bovada Casino Games &amp; Software Providers</p>
<p>Bovada Casino has an extensive selection of games that will always keep you entertained. Presently, the casino is ranked pretty high on the all-time games list with an outstanding selection of over 370 games.</p>
<p>Thanks to the content partnership it has struck with established gaming companies, however, Bovada Casino is capable of increasing its number of slot machines, table games, video poker, and even live dealer games from one year to the next quickly.</p>
<p>Today, you can choose titles from established developers such as Realtime Gaming, Rival, Visionary iGaming, Revolver Gaming, Makitone Gaming, and Bovada’s own proprietary software solutions.</p>
<p>Online Slot Games</p>
<p>Bovada has such an extensive selection of games that you would definitely want to be part of. Better yet, you can try your hand at some delightful titles yourself.</p>
<p>The casino’s selection of portfolio features many award-winning games, that is true, but you will also get to enjoy some of the best proprietor games there are, including Gold Rush Gus, Cyberpunk City, A Night with Cleo, and 777 Deluxe to name a few.</p>
<p>Here is a somewhat more complete list of the available slot games you will find at Bovada. Hope you enjoy it:</p>
<p>5 Times Wins Progressive Flea Market Red Sands 8 Lucky Charms Flying Colors Red, White &amp; Bleu 8 Lucky Charmsgressive Food Fight Reel Blood A Day at the Derby Football Frenzy Reel Circus A Switch in Time For Love &amp; Money Reel Crime 1: Bank Heist All Aboard Forbidden Slot Reel Crime 2: Art Heist Arabian Tales Fortune Keepers Reel Fighters Ares : The Battle of Troy Frogged Reel of Fortune As the Reels Turn 1 Fruit Frenzy Reel Party As the Reels Turn 2 Future Fortunes Reel Party Platinum As the Reels Turn 3 Gladiator Wars Rise of Poseidon Astral Luck Global Cup Soccer Rock On Atomic Age Gnome Sweet Home Roll out the Barrels Aussie Rules Gobblers Gold Ronin Aztec’s Treasure Goblin’s Gold Scary Rich Baby Boomers: Cash Cruise Gold Rush Scary Rich 2 Best of Luck Goldbeard Scary Rich 3 Big Cash Win Golden Gorilla Secret Garden Big Money Bigfoot Goldenman Sevens &amp; Stripes Birds of Fury Grandma’s Attic Sevens and Bars Blazin’ Buffalo Gushers Gold Shamrock Isle Bowled Over Heavyweight Gold Sherwood Forest Fortunes Bulletproof Babes Hercules The Immortal Shopping Spree Bust-A-Vault Heroes Realm Silver Unicorn Caesar’s Empire Hobo’s Hoard Six Shot Showdown Candy Cottage Hole in Won Snow White &amp; The Poison Apple Cash Money Mermaids Hydro Heat Snow Wonder Cash Money Mermaids Ice Picks So 80’s Catsino Indiana Jane Soccer Babes Champs Élysées Invasion Spartan Warrior Chicken Little Jack the Ripper Spy Game Cirque du Slots Jacques Pot: Gourmet Slot Star Jewels Cleopatra’s Coins Japan-O-Rama Strike Gold Cleopatra’s Gold Jenny Nevada &amp; The Diamond Temple Summer Ease Coins of Olympus Jolly Roger’s Super Diamond Mine Cosmic Quest I : Mission Control Leonardo’s Loot Surf Paradise Cosmic Quest II : Mystery Planets Lion’s Lair Swinging Sweethearts Costume Party Lion’s Roar Tahiti Time Crazy Camel Cash Loco 7’s Tea Cup Dragons Cream Of The Crop Lost Secret of Atlantis Ten Times Wins Crystal Waters Major Moolah The Back Nine Demi Gods Mega Wins Thunderbird Derby Dollars Metal Detector Tiger Treasures Desert Kingdom Midway Madness Travel Bug Diamond Cherries Milk the Cash Cow Treasure Island Diamond Dazzle Mister Money Tycoon Towers Diamond Dozen Money Magic Vintage Vegas Diamonds Downunder Moonlight Mystery Wacky Wedding Diggin’ Deep Moonshiner’s Moolah Watch the Birdie Dino Island Mystic Wolf Western Wildness Dirty Martini Nuclear Fishin’ Whale O’ Winnings DJ Moo Cow Ocean Treasure Wheel of Cash Dog Pound Dollars One Million BC Wild Carnival Doo Wop Daddy-O Opera Night Wild Safari Dragon Princess Panda Party Wild Wild Spin Dragons Pigskin Payout Win Mill Eggstravaganza Pistols &amp; Roses Windy Farm El Luchador Pond of Koi Winter Wonders Fantastic Fruit Precious Treasures Witches and Wizards Fantasy Fortune Psychedelic Sixties World of Oz Fast Lane Pub Crawlers Zombies Vs Cheerleaders Firestorm 7 Queen Of Kings Zombies Vs Cheerleaders II Fixer Upper Rain Dance Zombiezee Money</p>
<p>Now, please note that I haven’t included all slot titles here, as Bovada has kept adding titles and I haven’t tracked all the new additions. As an aggregate, though, the slots are well over 200 dedicated games right now.</p>
<p>New &amp; Featured Games</p>
<p>With so many great titles flying around, Bovada has tried to narrow down your search a little. Therefore, I find the New &amp; Featured Games section a very handy solution to help you pick some of the best titles at Bovada. I recommend trying any of the following games:</p>
<p>Dragon’s Siege</p>
<p>Gods of Luxor</p>
<p>Pandas Go Wild</p>
<p>Fairy Wins</p>
<p>Cyberpunk City</p>
<p>Reign of Gnomes</p>
<p>Genie’s Gifts</p>
<p>Gold Rush Gus</p>
<p>There are also plenty of table games that have made it to the featured list, including Double Deck Blackjack, Baccarat, and American Roulette. Oh, and one title I definitely recommend to try is Multiplier Man. It’s an awesome Marvel-like superhero slot that is designed by Bovada themselves and definitely worth your time.</p>
<p>Blackjack Games</p>
<p>There are surprisingly just a few versions of blackjack you will find at Bovada. Still, they are quite neat and you will have no reason not to try them. In fact, these games are awesome in terms of paying potential. Players can pick from the following blackjack titles at Bovada:</p>
<p>Blackjack</p>
<p>Classic Blackjack</p>
<p>Classic Double Deck Blackjack</p>
<p>Classic Single Deck Blackjack</p>
<p>Double Deck blackjack</p>
<p>European Blackjack</p>
<p>Perfect Pairs</p>
<p>Single Deck Blackjack</p>
<p>Zappit Blackjack</p>
<p>Each title offers its own unique twist, but most of these games are actually fantastic as they pay over 99%.</p>
<p>Table Games</p>
<p>Next on the list, we have a whole bunch of brilliant table games Bovada Casino has prepared for you. Players will get to enjoy all sorts of games, including roulette, craps, and several versions of poker. To make it easier for you, I have listed all the available table games titles here:</p>
<p>Andar Bahar</p>
<p>American Roulette</p>
<p>Baccarat</p>
<p>Caribbean Hold’em</p>
<p>Caribbean Stud Poker</p>
<p>Classic American Roulette</p>
<p>Classic Baccarat</p>
<p>Classic Craps</p>
<p>Classic Tri Card Poker</p>
<p>Classic European Roulette</p>
<p>Craps</p>
<p>European Roulette</p>
<p>Let ‘Em Ride</p>
<p>Let ‘Em Ride Classic</p>
<p>Lucky Wheel</p>
<p>Pai Gow Poker</p>
<p>Roll the Dice</p>
<p>Teen Patti Pro</p>
<p>There are a few more titles to add to this list that are definitely worth your attention. Nevertheless, you will find the selection of table games to be quite neat and well-rounded.</p>
<p>Video Poker</p>
<p>Next, Bovada Casino has made sure to include a whole lot of video poker games which have arguably the highest Return to Player (RTP) rate of all games. Here is a quick list of the video games you can try:</p>
<p>Bonus Deuces Wild 1 Hand Double Bonus Poker 1 Hand Jacks or Better 1 Hand Joker Poker 1 Hand Bonus Poker 1 Hand Double Double Bonus Poker 1 Hand Jacks or Better 10 Hands Joker Poker 10 Hands Bonus Poker Deluxe 1 Hand Double Double Jackpot Poker 1 Hand Jacks or Better 3 Hands Joker Poker 3 Hands Deuces Wild Double Jackpot Poker 1 Hand Jacks or Better 52 Hands Joker Poker 52 Hands</p>
<p>I think Bovada’s selection of video poker games can use some additional work, but it’s definitely not bad to begin with. The theoretical return once again exceeds 99% in most of these titles, and you will have a blast going through any of the games here.</p>
<p>Specialty Games</p>
<p>I have discovered a more casual selection of titles that will certainly appeal to those who have come to Bovada to have a bit of fun and not put too much stress on their gaming session. Players are very welcome to explore the full selection of Specialty Games here including bingo, keno, and a few whimsical titles such as Pirates Pillage, Pesca Bingo, and Penguin Payday.</p>
<p>Is Bovada Live Casino up to Scratch?</p>
<p>I won’t lie to you, I was thrilled to try the Bovada Live Casino after all the good things I have heard about it. After all, every other reviewing service I respect and follow has given the website’s live dealer games top marks.</p>
<p>And so, I approached the casino with a mix of excitement and critical attitude only to discover that the action at Bovada doesn’t stop 24/7 and you have access to the website’s immersive tables around the clock no matter what.</p>
<p>Players will be absolutely thrilled to try Live Blackjack, Live Baccarat, and Live Roulette. The table limits will range from $5 to $2,500 for blackjack and baccarat, but you will find roulette to be more accommodating with the limits set both lower and higher in the $1 – $3,000 range.</p>
<p>Now, there are plenty of games to try. In fact, there are some 32 games and most of them scale very well. Each game will display a table limit as well as the live dealer who is in charge of the table, and how many people are participating.</p>
<p>The best title seems to be Blackjack Early Payout which pays 99.5% and has an entry-level of $5 per bet. If you are a high roller you can still bet $100 per hand of blackjack and baccarat or per spin of roulette. I don’t think there is any difference whether you play with Unlimited Players or Fixed Players either, as it’s you against the house.</p>
<p>Bovada Mobile Casino: Good for HTML5</p>
<p>When Bovada was only just getting started in 2011, they didn’t immediately establish itself as a mobile-friendly casino. What temporary lapses there may have been, Bovada has fixed very quickly.</p>
<p>Today, many of the casino’s games are actually mobile friendly, thanks to the shift to HTML5 technology by developers. Players won’t see a dedicated app, but I assure you no such thing is necessary either.</p>
<p>Now, one thing that I must note here is that since around 2017, Bovada is no longer working with Betsoft Games. The reasons behind the decisions are private, but there was a rumor that the RNG used by Betsoft wasn’t exactly accurate.</p>
<p>I won’t venture to accuse Betsoft of anything, as they are one of the biggest gaming names in the industry, but it just goes to show that Bovada are very willing to retain their reputation and not let a partnership reflect poorly on their reputation. I definitely appreciate Bovada’s commitment to player safety.</p>
<p>Banking at Bovada Casino: Simple and Quick</p>
<p>Banking at Bovada Casino is simplified. As one of the leading online casinos available to US players, you can rest assured that everything is top-notch. Players will feel very comfortable depositing and withdrawing their money from Bovada. We have broken down the methods into two sections.</p>
<p>Deposits</p>
<p>Deposits at Bovada Casino are quick, versatile, and highly reliable. You will have no trouble placing a deposit with any of the payment methods listed on the website. Now, let me offer some details. There are several banking options you can use, and they include:</p>
<p>Bitcoin</p>
<p>Bitcoin Cash</p>
<p>Visa, American Express, MasterCard</p>
<p>Zelle</p>
<p>Voucher</p>
<p>For all debit and credit cards, the deposit limit will range between $20 and $1,500. For Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash, you can deposit between $10 and $5,000, which is more flexible. Then you have vouchers that allow you to deposit between $10 and $3,000.</p>
<p>There are no casino fees, but keep in mind that some credit card processors may charge a 3% fee. However, so long as you are depositing in USD, it should be relatively easy and no surcharges should be added.</p>
<p>Withdrawals</p>
<p>To withdraw money from Bovada Casino and you will mostly get to choose between five dedicated methods. Of course, they may change over time but that’s alright since you will always have the full list of options at the cashier. The available payment methods include:</p>
<p>Bitcoin</p>
<p>Bitcoin Cash</p>
<p>Check by Courier</p>
<p>Wire Transfer</p>
<p>Voucher</p>
<p>Withdrawals are actually pretty quick. You can request between $10 and $9,500 for both Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash and expect a quick processing time within 60 minutes and no additional charges.</p>
<p>If you run into trouble using the banking options at Bovada, just hop to the customer support channels and make sure to get in touch with an agent who will sort you out.</p>
<p>Bovada Customer Support</p>
<p>Bovada has several ways of getting in touch with customers. Players can contact a customer support agent via phone number at 1-888-263-0000, choose a live chat contact or email at [email protected]. Customer support is only available in English so keep this in mind when you reach out. Bovada has an instant response time via their phone lines and live chat system.</p>
<p>Final Word</p>
<p>Bovada Casino has the stamp of approval of many respected casino reviewing services. Today, I speak on the behalf of the entire GamblingNews reviewing staff when I say that our extensive testing proved that Bovada is a casino that is ready to lead the way in iGaming.</p>
<p>Even though the operator is based “offshore,” Bovada has everything it needs to make an impression on even the most skeptical player. I have looked at every nook and cranny and can reassure you that the operator is definitely one of the best you can find on the market today.</p>
<p>You should have no trouble whatsoever finding relevant games, awesome bonuses, and withdraw all your money quickly.</p>
