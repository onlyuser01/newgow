<p>On Wednesday, Gov. Phil Murphy announced that New Jersey would increase the capacity from 35% to 50% for restaurants, casinos, gyms, personal care places as of March 19. Seating at bars will not be allowed. Indoor private gatherings will also increase to 25 people and outdoor ones up to 50 people.</p>

He said that on February 5, after the last capacity change, there were less than 2900 patients, and that number has lowered by 1000 since then.
