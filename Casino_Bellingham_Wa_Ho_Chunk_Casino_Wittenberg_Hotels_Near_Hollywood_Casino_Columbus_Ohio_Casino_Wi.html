<p>North American XB Net has entered into a distribution agreement with flagship European sportsbook VBET, driven by Bet Construct.</p>
<p>A Mutually Beneficial Deal</p>
<p>Horse and greyhound racing content provider XB Net has announced that it has struck an agreement with VBET. Through the agreement, XB Net will supply the European sportsbook property with an assortment of live photos, data and betting services from its portfolio of over 50 North American racing tracks. This would allow VBET to flexibly and comfortably fill in its programming schedule with a selection of fast betting opportunities.</p>
<p>XB Net’s content pipeline is drawn from a substantial state-side well that covers around 90% of all US horse and greyhound racing. This includes several of the most prestigious racing competitions across the globe, such as the Belmont and Preakness Stakes Triple Crown competitions, the Pegasus World Cup and the Breeders’ Cup. The latter is of particular importance as VBET saw an immediate surge in engagement when it attended the competition’s two-day festival.</p>
<p>VBET offers an assortment of fast betting opportunities during a comfortable time range between 18:00 and 05:00 CET. The company’s offers have proven both reliable as well as a nice fit for European domestic racing.</p>
<p>Confidence in Agreement</p>
<p>XB Net International Senior Vice President Simon Fraser has stated that the partnership would be highly beneficial for XB Net as it would help the company organically grow the influence and reach of its products. According to him, the deal was especially welcome given that VBET was an emerging force on the European Market.</p>
<p>“North American racing enjoys peak recreational alignment after the close of Europe’s daily domestic cards, and we’re delighted to report that levels of engagement and retention are surging during these key evening segments.” Simon Fraser, XB Net International Senior Vice President</p>
<p>VBET UK Regional Director Artur Manasaryan expressed confidence in the agreement as well. He has stressed that VBET was delighted to work with XB NET, whose one-stop racing services helped VBET generate new revenue streams and record turnover during the Breeder’s Cup in November.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Mr. Manasaryan stated that while live sports are still trying to adapt to an uncertain future, North American Racing is consistently and seamlessly managing to plug the gaps in its scheduling and managing to secure viewer retention during primetime periods. This has proven a significant factor for increased betting activity, he believes.</p>
<p>“XB Net are masters in optimizing and positioning an unfamiliar product in order to engage our key audiences. As a result, VBET are now offering a comprehensive and cohesive racing experience across digital and mobile channels, each benefiting from BetConstruct’s powerhouse platform which underpins our innovative B2C brand. Together, we plan to continue consolidating our progressive position in both mature and evolving European markets,” said Artur Manasaryan, VBET UK Regional Director.</p>
