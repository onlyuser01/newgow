    <h1>Indiana Casino Top Casinos Panda Master Casino Biloxi Ms Casinos Tulsa Ok Casinos Sportradar Receive</h1>

<p>Global supplier of official sports data for the sports betting industry Sportradar announced today its US subsidiary received a license to operate as an online gaming provider in Connecticut and had its West Virginia supplier license renewed.</p>
<p>Double Delight</p>
<p>The Online Gaming Service Provider license granted to Sportradar in Connecticut and the renewal of its Sports Wagering Supplier license in West Virginia affirm the data and content supplier’s position across 20 regulated jurisdictions in the US.</p>
<p>Connecticut approved the measure to legalize online sports betting in May and officially launched online wagering on sports last month after the Connecticut Lottery Corp. (CLC), Mohegan and Mashantucket Pequot tribes received final approvals to go live.</p>
<p>“Sportradar is committed to providing our clients the highest quality sports data and services. As sports betting legalization accelerates in the US, strong and transparent data will help govern the growing industry expansion in a sustainable and ethical manner.” Arne Rees, CEO, Sportradar US</p>
<p>And while Connecticut is one of the most recent US jurisdictions to allow wagering on sporting events, West Virginia has been doing that since 2018 when it became the 5th state to introduce legal sports betting. The state authorized online wagering from the very beginning.</p>
<p>“These licenses underscore Sportradar’s commitment to the US market, our leadership in integrity and the value of our products and services.” Arne Rees, CEO, Sportradar US</p>
<p>Operating on both state and tribal levels nationwide, Sportradar’s products and services provide its business partners, sports betting operators and gaming agencies, with transparent and accurate data around the clock to power their offerings and help maintain the integrity of the sport.</p>
<p>Industry-Wide Accreditation</p>
<p>Last month, Sportradar’s quality assurance processes related to the collection and distribution of data received the industry-wide recognition of the International Betting Integrity Association’s (IBIA) Data Standards Kitemark for matching the set of standards and guidelines to help protect the integrity of the sport from betting corruption.</p>
<p>In the US, Sportradar completed its initial public offering (IPO) in September to go live with public trading on the NASDAQ. The listing was expected to happen earlier in the year via a merger with the special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) Horizon Acquisition Corp., but the $10 billion deal hit the rails after the lost deal with the NFL caused a downward revision of the total valuation of the deal and forced the data supplier to withdraw.</p>
