<p>Odds Shorten on Adam Laxalt Winning Nevada Governor Race After Campaign Manager Alleges Attack by Liberal Operative</p>

<p>Nevada Attorney General Adam Laxalt, the Republican candidate in the state’s gubernatorial race, has closed the gap on his opponent, current Clark County Commissioner Steve Sisolak.</p>

<p>And it appears an alleged attack on Laxalt’s campaign manager by a liberal operative is only helping the conservative’s cause.</p>
<p>Kristin Davison, 31, alleged she was physically attacked by a Democratic activist working for American Bridge 21st Century, a liberal super PAC originated by Media Matters founder David Brock and largely funded by billionaire George Soros. After an event, Davison told police that Wilfred Michael Stark III, 50, grabbed and yanked her arm and refused to let go.</p>
<p>Politics is a little bit aggressive these days, but this is just insane. I’ve never seen anything like it,” Davison told Fox News.</p>
<p>Stark was taken into custody by Las Vegas City Marshals, but was later freed on $1,140 bail. Davison released photos of the bruises she sustained on her arm from the incident. American Bridge said it had immediately terminated Stark’s employment following the altercation.</p>
<p>According to its website, American Bridge is a “progressive research and communications organization committed to holding Republicans accountable for their words and actions and helping you ascertain when Republican candidates are pretending to be something they’re not.”</p>
<p>Odds Fluctuate</p>
<p>Sisolak’s campaign immediately denounced Stark’s actions, and said it had nothing to do with the incident.</p>
<p>“No one should ever feel unsafe at a political event and the type of physical violence reported is beyond the pale. We strongly condemn this violence,” Sisolak campaign manager Chris Sloan stated.</p>
<p>Political bettors at PredictIt, however, seem to believe the incident might impact the outcome of the November 6 election. Shares of a Laxalt victory have jumped five cents over the last 24 hours. Sisolak still holds a slim lead, with his shares trading for 56 cents, and Laxalt now at 54 cents.</p>
<p>Less than a month ago, Sisolak shares were trading at nearly 70 cents, and Laxalt at around 35. The Real Clear Politics polling average has the race at a dead heat. Both Sisolak and Laxalt are at 42.5 percent, and Libertarian candidate Jared Lord at 6.5 percent.</p>
<p>The race will decide who replaces Gov. Brian Sandoval (R), who is stepping down after serving two terms.</p>
<p>Stark Raving Mad</p>
<p>This week’s incident isn’t Stark’s first alleged attack. He was arrested a year ago this month in Virginia for disorderly conduct at an event for then-Republican gubernatorial candidate Ed Gillespie.</p>
<p>And earlier this year, the American Bridge operative was arrested for allegedly assaulting the female press secretary of the US Department of the Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke.</p>
<p>Zinke has made plenty of headlines over the last year, due to his involvement with a controversial Connecticut tribal casino issue. The Mashantucket and Mohegan Indians were given approval by the state to jointly build a satellite casino on non-sovereign land, but only on condition that Zinke approve of the plans and confirm the project wouldn’t jeopardize current gaming compacts.</p>
<p>Zinke never issued an opinion, which effectively stalled the satellite casino. The legal challenge is ongoing.</p>
