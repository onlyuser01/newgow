    <h1>Fast Payout Online Casino Ohio Online Casino South Point Hotel Casino Durango Casino And Resort News</h1>

<p>Lightning Box has announced the launch of Stellar Cash Chicken Fox 5x Skillstar, an arcade-style game with the innovative Stellar Cash feature</p>
<p>Light &amp; Wonder, the NASDAQ-listed iGaming company that calls itself the “world’s largest and most-trusted iGaming ecosystem“, acquired the Sydney-based provider of slots and iGaming products Lightning Box in August 2021.</p>
<p>Ever since, Lightning Box has benefitted from enhanced commercial support and recorded impressive jumps in growth. The company also managed to continue its commitment to producing top-tier slots, and its freshest announced release comes to strengthen this idea.</p>
<p>The game that is a sequel to their already successful Chicken Fox 5x Skillstar slot will originally mark its exclusive debut via Sky Betting and Gaming prior to being launched officially in Europe and the UK. The 3×5 reeler with 20 win lines features the Chicken Catch Bonus and other interesting mechanics.</p>

<p>Get Ready to Revisit the Farmyard in the New Sequel</p>
<p>The new game introduces players to a farmyard packed with plenty of specific design elements and symbols ranging from chickens, pigs, goats, and tractors. The Lady symbol in the slot represents the Wild which can replace the rest of the symbols with the exception of the Golden Egg symbol.</p>
<p>The Golden Egg represents the Scatter Bonus symbol. Landing three, four, or five Gilden Eggs triggers eight, 15, or 30 Free Games respectively, along with the Chicken Catch Bonus.</p>
<p>The Stellar Cash feature is the retro addition brought to the new slot. Players receive it when a minimum of three spaceships pop on the reels.</p>
<p>There are six levels that can be engaged when shooting targets to discover prizes or move up and advance to a new level. When players complete all six levels, the Jackpot level is triggered. Here, players can win up to $125,000.</p>
<p>Skillstar and Chicken Catch Bonus</p>
<p>Players landing the Golden Eggs symbols automatically engage the Skillstar round which gives them the chance to reach the leaderboard as the sneaky Fox attempts to collect as many golden eggs as it can using a sack. The Skillstar round begins with three lives and gives players the opportunity to collect as many points as they can.</p>
<p>Next, players will take a trip to the chicken coop during the Chicken Catch Bonus round. During this round, landing the Fox symbols five times will multiply Free Games by 5 when awarded with the white egg. At the same time, any chicken caught with Fox x5 will pay five times.</p>
<p>Light &amp; Wonder’s vice president of game development Rob Procter spoke about the original game’s success, then he expressed confidence in the ability of the added retro animations and one-of-a-kind Stellar Cash feature to improve the gameplay in the new game.</p>
<p>Lightning Box’s chief product officer David Little also praised the new game’s potential to grow in popularity among their players while acknowledging the “shake-up” given to their previous hit game with the help of the Stellar Cash feature.</p>
<p>Last November, Lighting Box released its first keno game.</p>
