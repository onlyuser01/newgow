<p>It’s time for Super Bowl LVIII. The 2024 NFL Championship Game will take place at Allegiant Stadium in Paradise (Las Vegas), Nevada on Sunday, February 11, 2024. See our prediction on who’s gonna win the Lombardi Trophy, the San Francisco 49ers or the Kansas City Chiefs</p>
<p>The Kansas City Chiefs are the defending champions who weren’t too impressive in the regular season. However, Andy Reid’s men really switched to the top gear when the postseason started.</p>
<p>They’ve already slain a couple of giants in 2024 and they’re determined to do the same on February 11. However, Super Bowl LVIII odds suggest the San Francisco 49ers will be the ones to lift the Lombardi Trophy.</p>

<p>Kansas City Chiefs Looking Great Ahead of Super Bowl LVIII</p>
<p>The Kansas City Chiefs went 11-6 in the regular season. It was their worst record since 2017, which was the rookie season of Patrick Mahomes. The quarterback had a mediocre season in 2023, but his form has improved since the start of 2024.</p>
<p>He’s thrown for four touchdowns in the three playoff games the Chiefs have played so far. It may not seem too impressive, but you need to keep in mind that these guys played against some really tough opponents – the Miami Dolphins, Buffalo Bills, and Baltimore Ravens.</p>
<p>Mahomes and his colleagues from Kansas City’s attacking team have been great, but it’s the Chiefs’ defense that’s been a real-world-beater in 2024. In the AFC Championship Game, they absolutely destroyed Lamar Jackson and the Ravens, keeping them to only 10 points.</p>
<p>Can the San Francisco 49ers End the Chiefs’ Dominance?</p>
<p>It’s been 29 years since the San Francisco 49ers won the Super Bowl the last time. Since then, they played the NFL Championship Game on two occasions, namely, in 2014 and 2020. The latter – Super Bowl LIV – saw them lose 31-20 to the Chiefs.</p>
<p>Mahomes was the MVP of the Championship Game, while his teammate at the time, Damien Williams, scored two touchdowns (one rushing and one receiving TD). Williams, however, is no longer in Kansas City. The same goes for another five players from the starting 11 in the Kansas City Chiefs offensive team in Super Bowl LIV.</p>

<p>When it comes to San Francisco’s offensive team, only four players from the 2020 game are still on the roster. But those are elite players – Deebo Samuel (WR), Kyle Juszczyk (FB), George Kittle (TE), and Jimmy Garoppolo (QB). Garoppolo won’t play on February 11, but the Niners have a better alternative in Sam Darnold.</p>
<p>Compared to their 2020 lineup, the Niners offense looks much stronger. There’s Christian McCaffree in the running back position, as well as Elijah Mitchell. When it comes to their defensive team, it’s all about Nick Bosa, who’s one of the best defensive ends in the world.</p>
<p>Kansas City Chiefs vs. San Francisco 49ers Super Bowl LVIII Prediction</p>
<p>If there’s a team that can outsmart the Kansas City defense, it’s San Francisco. It’s very likely the Niners will go hard on the running game, which is great news for their fans because they’ve got McCaffrey, Mitchell, and Juszczyk to carry the ball forward.</p>
<p>But can their defense stop Mahomes &amp; Co.? We think they can. They can keep them to just one or two TDs, which should be enough to win the game.</p>
<p>Pick: San Francisco 49ers</p>
