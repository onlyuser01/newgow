<p>Holland Casino has paired up with Playtech to launch casino activities in the Netherlands. Playtech, a gambling software company that was created in 1999, supplies software for online casinos for different types of games such as online poker, table games and others. It is quoted on the London Stock Exchange and is an FTSE-250 Index listed company. It will now become Holland Casino's strategic provider of gambling technology in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>Holland Casino has been active for 45 years and has been a cornerstone in leisure in the Netherlands. This enterprise has the legal monopoly for gambling in the Netherlands, with fourteen casinos that offer recreational gambling throughout the country. Profits obtained from the casinos are destined to the Dutch Treasury.</p>
<p>Part of the agreement is that a live casino studio has been constructed near the current Holland Casino premises in Scheveningen. Here, gamblers can access Playtech live tables via the casino site with games such as blackjack or roulette. According to Erwin van Lambaart, the CEO of Holland Casino, they aim to offer "the best product and experiences in a safe and enjoyable online environment."</p>
<p>The collaboration with Playtech will bring the Dutch concern greater gaming technology and optimize the current gambling experience with the state-of-the-art gaming knowledge of the British company.</p>
<p>Holland Casino started its own casino product by teaming up with Nuvei, which it announced at the start of the month. However, there was a glitch in the system and this forced a delay. This was resolved, and Holland Casino was able to offer the gaming services on October 5.</p>
<p>The Dutch casino has made considerable investments in its offer with Nuvei because it views digital transformation as essential for its future development. It received one of the first 10 licenses for online betting after iGaming was approved by the Kansspelautoriteit, the country's gaming regulator.</p>
<p>Various other operators have started in the Netherlands once the online gambling law passed. Evolution and Finnplay are among them, with additional entities looking to overcome the challenges set forth by the country's strict gaming regulations.</p>
<p>The iGaming market opened in the Netherlands on October 1 and, since then, 28 operators paid the license fee of â‚¬48,000 ($55,720). Holland Casino was one of the first licensees to operate iGaming, and teaming up with Playtech will assure it a leading position with gamers in the country.</p>
