<p>Many Romanian players will get to experience the best titles Gaming Corps has to offer</p>
<p>Gaming Corps, a prominent Swedish developer of casino content, has secured a new partnership agreement with Skywind Group, one of the biggest Romanian gaming companies. As a result, the former company’s full portfolio of games will become available to Skywind’s customers.</p>
<p>The games will be rolled out on Skywind’s multiple brands, including Cashpot.ro, Luck.com, Magnumbet and Princess Casino. This will greatly expand Gaming Corps’ presence in the country, allowing many new players to try out its titles.</p>
<p>Gaming Corps is a reputable gaming company with a background in video games. Thanks to its experience in video gaming, Gaming Corps is able to create a multitude of engaging and gamified experiences, allowing it to grow at a fast pace.</p>
<p>The provider’s portfolio consists of a rich selection of slots, crash games, mine games and traditional table titles. Some of its most popular products include 777 Jackpot Diamond Hold and Win, Aztec Bonus Pot, Coin Miner, Penalty Champion, Plinko and Raging Zeus.</p>
<p>The quality of Gaming Corps’ titles is universally recognized as attested by multiple deals with industry-leading companies. For example, SuprNation recently onboarded content from Gaming Corps, following another partnership deal between the provider and Pin-UP Casino.</p>
<p>Many New Players Will Get to Try Out Gaming Corps’ Titles</p>
<p>Gaming Corps’ chief commercial officer, Danielle Calafato, commented on the tie-up with Skywind, praising the company for its robust presence in Romania. Calafato noted that her team is excited to be able to reach Romanian players and allow them to experience Gaming Corps’ outstanding titles.</p>
<p>Calafato also said that the deal represents a major development for her company:</p>
<p>This is another significant step forward for us in Romania, and I look forward to what I’m sure will be a very successful partnership. Danielle Calafato, CCO, Gaming Corps</p>
<p>Skywind Group’s head of CRM, Daniela Asaftei, also shared her thoughts on the deal. She said that her team is excited to offer Gaming Corps’ “exciting and modern games” to its players. The arrangement, Asaftei added, is a great opportunity to expand Skywind’s portfolio.</p>
<p>This [partnership] will allow us to expand our offering and present players with even more premium casino and video games as we further strengthen our brands. Daniela Asaftei, head of CRM, Skywind Group</p>
<p>Last month, Skywind’s Princess Casino brand also added content from Stakelogic, further expanding its strong portfolio.</p>
