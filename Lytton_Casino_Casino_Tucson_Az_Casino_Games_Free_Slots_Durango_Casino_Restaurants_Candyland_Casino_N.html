<p>Monumental’s NBA and NHL franchises team up with William Hill</p>
<p>The Capital One Arena in Washington D.C. to host the first WH sportsbook in a sports arena</p>
<p>Monumental hopes to transform Capital One Arena into a premier sports venue</p>
<p>Sports management company Monumental Sports &amp; Entertainment and British sportsbook William Hill have inked a fresh sports betting deal that will see the arrival of a brand new sportsbook in a professional sports venue – a first.</p>
<p>William Hill and Monumental Team Up for Betting Partnership</p>
<p>William Hills made news twice on October 3, with the operator announcing a second partnership, this time with Monumental Sports &amp; Entertainment. The pair will work on the first sportsbook to operate within a professional sports venue. Capital One Arena in Washington D.C., owned by Monumental Sports &amp; Entertainment, will host this unique sportsbook. Monumental also owns the well-known NBA franchise the Washington Wizards.</p>
<p>Just inking a deal with the NBA to become the league’s official sports betting sponsor, William Hill US is already moving in on another landmark partnership with the Washington Wizard. Similarly, Monumental already owns the NHL Washington Capitals and WNBA team Washington Mystics which are also featured in the deal.</p>

<p>As a result of the partnership, the newly-emerging sportsbook will have luxurious betting facilities and be located on multiple floors across the arena. William Hill’s sportsbook will be open for business daily whether there’s an event on any given day.</p>
<p>Place Your Digital Wagers</p>
<p>All fans will be able to come to the arena and use their WH mobile apps to place a wager if they prefer digital wagers over spending time queuing up at the counter. WH will also become the official sports betting partner for the Wizards, Capitals and Mystics – a continuation of the previous partnership today.</p>
<p>Here’s how Ted Leonsis, Monumental Sports &amp; Entertainment Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive, commented the news:</p>
<p>“We are excited to partner with William Hill, the industry leader in sports betting, to become the first professional sports arena in the US to feature a sportsbook.”</p>
<p>Leonsis explained that the brand was excited to improve on the fan experience by adding innovative gaming tech. Similarly, there will be other things to try such as culinary treats and more. By adding William Hill, Leonsis believes that Monumental is on its way to transforming the venue into a premier sports arena.</p>
<p>WH US boss Joe Asher was also excited to comment on the news. He stressed the importance of the Washington D.C. area and spoke highly of the Monumental team behind the deal:</p>
<p>“This deal sets a new benchmark for how the industry will serve fans and how fans engage in sports.”</p>
<p>While Asher and Leonsis are pinning great hopes on sports betting, Washington D.C. still hasn’t legalized the industry in full, with a test run now taking place. Meanwhile, Greek lottery company, Intralot, may have been greasing palms to get itself a cushy contract with the lottery in the state.</p>
<p>A judge has already cautioned that the lawsuit brought up against Intralot is probably going to succeed.</p>
