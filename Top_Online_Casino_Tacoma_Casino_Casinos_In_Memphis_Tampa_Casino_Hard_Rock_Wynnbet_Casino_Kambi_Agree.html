    <h1>Top Online Casino Tacoma Casino Casinos In Memphis Tampa Casino Hard Rock Wynnbet Casino Kambi Agree</h1>

<p>The partnership comes at a time when 711 plans to request an extension of its license which would enable it to offer sports betting services in the country</p>
<p>Sports betting technology supplier Kambi Group announced a new important long-term agreement Friday. The company revealed that it joined forces with the fast-growing gambling operator in the Netherlands, 711. Under the terms of the new collaboration, the renowned sports betting platform and technology supplier agreed to power the operator’s sportsbook.</p>
<p>Thanks to the latest long-term deal, 711 will gain access to Kambi’s market-leading complete sportsbook solution. This includes the company’s AI-powered trading products and award-winning Bet Builder solution.</p>
<p>Recently, 711 has been enjoying strong growth within the regulated gambling market in the Netherlands. The company holds a license for online gambling in the country and has steadily increased its customer base since its entry last year. Considering the latest deal with Kambi, the fast-growing online casino operator plans to secure an extension to its license, allowing it to offer sports betting services.</p>
<p>To start offering such services, 711 needs to secure approval from the gambling regulator in the Netherlands, Kansspelautoriteit (KSA). Once this happens, the fast-growing operator anticipates leveraging its established brand sponsorship deals with leading Dutch teams, including FC Emmen, Telstar and Excelsior Rotterdam.</p>
<p>The deal with 711 comes after earlier this month, Kambi was selected as sportsbook technology provider for Svenska Spel, a leading Swedish gambling operator. Under the terms of that deal, the company agreed to power Svenska Spel’s online and retail sportsbook, delivering its cutting-edge technology.</p>
<p>The Collaboration Brings Excitement to 711</p>
<p>Gilles de Backer, 711’s COO, spoke about the company’s growth within the online gambling sector since its launch in the Netherlands last year. He revealed that expanding into the sports betting vertical was identified as an important next step for 711. Finally, 711’s COO pointed out: “By partnering with a leading sportsbook provider like Kambi, we are excited to be in a position to provide our growing customer base with a best-in-class product and exciting sports betting experiences.”</p>
<p>“711 online casino has achieved strong growth since we debuted in the Netherlands last year and it became clear that sports betting would be an important next step in the brand’s journey.“ Gilles de Backer, COO of 711</p>
<p>Kristian Nylén, Kambi’s co-founder and CEO added that the company is thrilled to deliver its services and power 711’s sportsbook in the Netherlands. He added that the latest deal reaffirms Kambi’s position as a leading sportsbook technology provider in one of the important markets on the Old Continent. Finally, Nylén predicted that its technology would supercharge 711’s sportsbook and help them achieve success.</p>
