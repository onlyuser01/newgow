    <h1>Free Online Casino Slot Games Excalibur Hotel Casino Resort Diamond Jo Casino Hotel Longhorn Casino</h1>

<p>Some casinos shows RTP below games ... but how can u tell if some casino (not from top 10-20) have RTP as they should?</p>
<p>Someone mention here earlier that play'n go and pragmatic are not reliable and let casinos fix their RTP,</p>
<p>I saw like 50 different providers on some casino and some of them i never heard of... still the question is how can u know what RTP is really behind them if they have questionable licence ?</p>
<p>i KNOW that some providers offers to casinos to chose % of RTP , but how can we know what casinos are those?</p>
<p>i Swear to god, in 5 years actively playing slots, i can't remember when i last time won anything on Microgaming or Netent games... Pragmatic maybe 50-50... Others idk, EGT/Greentube/Merkur/RTG/Betson/Habanero are ok i mostly play those.... i don't really play some ridiculous providers with silly art games or copy of other games from this providers with different pics and name..</p>
<p>Anyway, is there any way to we can be sure that casino have RTP that they should have?</p>
<p>Because im 100% sure that some games have 30-35% top of RTP...</p>
