<p>The first UFC event of 2024 will be headlined by the second fight between Magomed Ankalaev and Johnny Walker</p>
<p>It’s no surprise the UFC decided to start the year with a fight between Magomed Ankalaev and Johhny Walker, two elite Light Heavyweights. Ankalaev is a former title challenger, while Johnny Walker is hoping to become one with a win on Saturday, January 13, 2024. Will he make this dream come true? Let’s find out!</p>

<p>Magomed Ankalaev to Put Himself Back on the UFC Map</p>
<p>In his most recent fight, the Dagestan-based fighter landed an accidental illegal knee that made Walker unable to continue fighting. It happened in the first round, and the fight was declared a no-contest.</p>
<p>Roughly a year before, Ankalaev fought Jan Blachowicz in a battle for the UFC Light Heavyweight title, but that bout too didn’t get a winner. After five rounds of hardcore fighting, the fight was declared a split draw, with Ankalaev getting media votes (23 out of 25).</p>

<p>The last time Ankalaev won a fight was in the summer of 2022 when we saw him beat Anthony Smith by a technical knockout. KO/TKO is his favorite method of finishing fights, while submissions aren’t his expertise.</p>
<p>Rather strangely for a fighter from Dagestan, Ankalaev isn’t much of a wrestler/grappler. He’s never won a fight by submission and his only career loss happened by this method. Is this something Johnny Walker can take advantage of?</p>
<p>Johnny Walker to Take It Up a Notch</p>
<p>This is a fight that can lift Johnny Walker’s career to a whole new level. He’s 27-1-1 overall with a 7-4-1 record since joining the UFC. He’s already fought many elite opponents, including Jamaal Hill and Nikita Krylov who beat him, but also Paul Craig and Anthony Smith, whom he defeated.</p>
<p>Johnny Walker is a well-rounded fighter whose No. 1 weapon is striking. When it comes to his ground game, he’s better than Ankalaev, but there’s a big question mark over whether he can take the fight to the floor.</p>
<p>The Brazilian has a 100% takedown success rate in the UFC, but the thing is that he’s only gone for a TD twice in his 12 fights in this promotion. Further, Ankalaev is almost exclusively using his wrestling skills for defense, which explains why his TD defense is 86%.</p>
<p>Magomed Ankalaev vs. Johnny Walker Prediction</p>
<p>Magomed Ankalaev is a -450 favorite to win Saturday’s fight for a reason. His powerful strikes and fantastic TD defense make him exactly the kind of a fighter that Johnny Walker cannot handle. That said, we suspect the Dagestani will finish his Brazilian foe probably within the first couple of rounds.</p>
