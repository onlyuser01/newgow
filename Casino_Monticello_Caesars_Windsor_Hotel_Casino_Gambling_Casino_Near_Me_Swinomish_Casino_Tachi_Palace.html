    <h1>Casino Monticello Caesars Windsor Hotel Casino Gambling Casino Near Me Swinomish Casino Tachi Palace</h1>

<p>Would let a game round complete and kicked me from the round right when it ended with a big win!!! I was playing book of Oz. And I hit all five doctor oz symbols. Then I was giving the boot form the slot amd went right too customer service? Then I asked if I was getting my withdrawal for the cash. The bet i was making at the time was a bet of one hundred amd 125 dollars I think, the spins i was playing at were 20 dollars a spin. So when I had four of the doctor oz and I respinned the fifth reel for the final symbol it ended up. Well we already know from the beginning of the story but on we go now. So back too the story at hand the support I was talking too told me they couldn't give me the cash because my account was not verified with my a couple other credentials for withdrawal. I think a bank statement and a couple pics of bank cards front/back. So I did all of this and when I finished they did not know what I was talking about and the game was reset. I wasn't in a good mood now, since I was being lied too and they wouldn't give me the data on the game. Still they will not release my data on the game and chat history of the event. Wondering if you could investigate this so I can finally receive my winnings. The support of the wildtornado casino still will not release anything too me on the game or the chat conversations! And I would love the help from some type of gaming authority figure that can help get this information amd the winnings payed out.</p>
