    <h1>7 Cedars Casino Bellagio Hotel Casino News Casino In Waukegan Illinois Boot Hill Casino Resort Casin</h1>

<p>Dear Marc,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. Could you please forward all the emails or screenshots showing that you have sent requests for the self-exclusion? My email address is petronela.k@casino.guru. Did you specify in those requests for how long you wish your account to be closed and clearly stated the reason why?</p>
<p>I have checked the general terms and conditions on the website, and this is what I found https://www.casino1club.com/general-terms-conditions/?lang=en:</p>
<p>„Responsible Gaming. For those customers who wish to restrict their gambling, we provide voluntary self-exclusion tools, which enable you to close your account or restrict your ability to place bets. If you require any information relating to this facility, please contact Customer Support or send an email to support@casino1club.com.</p>
<p>. Self-exclusion - you may want to exclude yourself from gambling for an extended period of time. You can request Self-Exclusion for a period between 6 months and 5 years.</p>
<p>. We will endeavor to implement your request within a reasonable time period and to ensure compliance with your self-exclusion. However, you accept that we have no responsibility or liability whatsoever if you continue gambling before your request has been implemented or you seek to use the Website and we fail to recognize or determine that.</p>
<p>. You acknowledge that exclusion and limits are set per account, and should you have accounts on more than one site owned by us, you must set the limits and exclusion on each account accordingly.</p>
<p>. During your self-exclusion period, all your accounts detected by us will be blocked and you are not allowed to open a new account with us during the self-exclusion period. Any new accounts you might attempt to open during your exclusion period will be blocked as soon as detected by us. In the event that you breach your self-exclusion by opening a new account with another casino brand operated by us, we shall close any such account, and will not be liable to refund you any funds which may have been wagered or won in association with this account.</p>
<p>. Please note that if you decide to reactivate your account(s) at the end of your selected self-exclusion period you must notify our customer support by sending an email to request reactivation of your account, which will be reactivated no sooner than 24 hours after your request."</p>
<p>Is support@casino1club.com the email address where your requests have been sent?</p>
<p>I hope we will be able to help you to resolve this issue as soon as possible. Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
