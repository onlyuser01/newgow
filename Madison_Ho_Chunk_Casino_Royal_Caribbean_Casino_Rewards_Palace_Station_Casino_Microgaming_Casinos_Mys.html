<p>SOFTSWISS Sportsbook, a provider of sports betting solutions, software, and platform, has teamed up with Sportradar Integrity Exchange, bolstering the latter’s commitment to global match-fixing globally.</p>
<p>Through this new collaboration, SOFTSWISS Sportsbook is hoping to bring a set of relevant and advanced solutions for Sportradar Integrity Exchange to leverage and use in its commitment to keep sports betting integrity and ensure a fair experience for customers.</p>
<p>Sportradar Integrity Exchange is an advanced and trusted solution that provides partners with insight into sports corruption and helps tackle global threats. The solution runs monthly and quarterly match-fixing reports to help partners better address the risks, along with an early-warning system in cases involving suspicious betting partners.</p>
<p>There are also annual trend reports which are based on hard data and help sportsbooks and software providers such as SOFTSWISS act preemptively to ensure that consumers are protected and sports betting contests are not marred by match-fixing.</p>
<p>Sportradar Integrity Exchange does not directly prevent sports betting as much as it creates it much harder for offenders to avoid detection, which discourages match-fixing in the first place. The solution also helps decrease the time it takes for responsible authorities to act and intervene in cases of actual match-fixing.</p>
<p>Commenting on this, SOFTSIWSS Sportsbook Head Alexander Kamenetskyi said that his company was committed to the highest standards of ethical conduct, fairness, and transparency. This recent partnership is a proactive approach designed to tackle match-fixing and help safeguard the integrity of sports.</p>
<p>SOFTWISS Sportsbook’s team will also work to actively gather and analyze data from publicly available sources to help with further assistance in specific cases.</p>
<p>Kamenetskyi spoke highly of Sportradar’s solution as it is designed as a two-way exchange where the company is swapping information with its partners to ensure that everyone is on the same page and that sportsbooks and software providers are able to contribute to the fight against match-fixing.</p>
<p>What is unique about Sportradar is that it has a particular insight into what sports match-fixers target and what methods they use to make it happen, making SOFTSWISS Sportsbook and other similar solutions more resilient and capable of registering suspicious betting patterns.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, SOFTSWISS was distinguished as one of the best sports betting providers at the BGS Awards 2023. The company is now committed to continue strengthening this reputation.</p>
