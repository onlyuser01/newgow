<p>Gambling provider Light &amp; Wonder has signed a major new deal with Spribe, the company behind the world’s biggest crash game, Aviator. Thanks to this tie-up, Spribe will be able to penetrate the US market, bringing its cutting-edge games to American audiences.</p>
<p>Under the landmark distribution agreement, Aviator and Spribe’s Turbo Games portfolio will be integrated into Light &amp; Wonder’s product lineup in the USA. As a result, the developer will be able to tap into the opportunities in the North American market.</p>
<p>Aviator, Spribe’s flagship game, is universally acknowledged as the best crash game in the contemporary gambling market. Currently live with a whopping 2,000 operators, the game is played by as many as 10 million consumers every month.</p>

<p>Aviator is a simple, yet engaging title where players must cash out their bet before the titular aviator and their airplane fly away. The longer a player waits before cashing out, the higher the multiplier.</p>

<p>Light &amp; Wonder’s senior director of digital partnerships, Steve Mayes, also shared his thoughts on the deal, saying that it will assert his company as a leader in the US ecosystem.</p>
<p>SPRIBE’s top-performing crash game, Aviator, has made impressive waves in the industry and been a resounding success in a short space of time, attracting a previously untapped demographic of players and we expect a similar reception in the U.S. market.
