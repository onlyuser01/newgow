<p>I Want to warn anyone or anybody to stay away from g slot casino If you want to be a charity case and take a gamble on whether the g slot casino will give your winnings if you win. then do play ..Playing with them is another gamble so if you want to see your winnings then do not play but let me tell you it is like playing for free only you're using your money and if you win then the gamble will be 30% you might get it.. To me, it seems like if you're a player that has had a lucky streak in their casino then you are jumping through hoops to even see your winnings.. In my case its been over 55 days since I was fully verified with this casino and told them I would not make any dep unless they verified me as I sent all my documents but then asked for the proof of my dep method no problem sent it to them even though I had already made a successful withdrawal of 400 They asked me for a selfie sent over 15 of them before they said it was approved but guess what its been 55 days now they re saying they are investigating I would appreciate if someone had this info of Gslot and had warned me so here I am just telling my story to help someone not to go through the nightmare My withdrawal is 4000 and I have not seen a penny ...April 13th made the withdrawal today is May 25th still not a penny MY STORY OF GLOT PLEASE JUST INFORMING EVERYONE..Want to add I have proof of all emails saying they approved my withdrawals, I have chats from Chris saying go ahead now its been approved and after now 55 days its been nothing but mocking me it will be processed wait your turn, it is processed to now telling Peter here that they are investigating but what they never say Stay away from its beyond terrible ..I will keep you updated if I ever get my 4000 its been heartbreaking as in the early days when I won was so happy and when they approved it I knew I would get it within days and I budget knowing I would have that money so they are not only scammers but cruel and lie to make you think your getting your funds I have all the proof</p>
