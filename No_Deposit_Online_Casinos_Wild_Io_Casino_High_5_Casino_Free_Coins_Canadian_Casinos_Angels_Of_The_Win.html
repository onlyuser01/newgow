<p>FanDuel, a leading North American online gaming company, has teamed up with YouTube to provide football enthusiasts with an exclusive promotional offer for the highly anticipated NFL Sunday Ticket.</p>
<p>FanDuel’s Offer with Bonus Bets and Sunday Ticket Savings</p>
<p>Running from August 21 to September 18, the promotion caters to both new and existing FanDuel Sportsbook customers. For new users who place a $5 bet, the rewards are substantial: a generous $200 in Bonus Bets and a $100 discount on the NFL Sunday Ticket package available on YouTube and YouTube TV. Existing customers are not left out, as a $5 bet will also earn them a $100 reduction on the NFL Sunday Ticket price.</p>
<p>YouTube secured the broadcasting rights to NFL Sunday Ticket in a monumental seven-year agreement valued at $2 billion, which was unveiled in late 2022. Fans can choose between accessing this coveted package as an add-on to YouTube TV or as a standalone option on YouTube Primetime Channels.</p>
<p>Mike Raffensperger, chief commercial officer at FanDuel, expressed his enthusiasm for the partnership, stating: “This partnership makes FanDuel the only category partner making it easier for fans to access every out-of-market Sunday afternoon NFL game and elevates the sports betting and entertainment experience for millions of fans across the United States.”</p>
<p>Raffensperger further added that the partnership with YouTube to assist in delivering NFL Sunday Ticket on YouTube and YouTube TV to their customers positioned FanDuel directly at the crossroads of one of the most esteemed sports and media offerings globally.</p>
<p>FanDuel’s Strategy Unveils Exciting Features and Collaborations</p>
<p>As part of its larger strategy as the Official Sports Betting Partner of the NFL for the third consecutive year, FanDuel is introducing an array of innovative features and offerings to captivate fans. Among these is the highly anticipated FanDuel Explore, an intuitive product that presents users with simplified, narrative-driven question format bets. This user-friendly approach includes engaging options like predicting game winners and estimating points scored. Educational tutorials and parlay builders will also be accessible on the new Explore tab within the FanDuel app, providing a welcoming entry point for those new to sports betting.</p>
<p>Football is not the only sport where FanDuel has been striking collaborations in order to benefit fans. Two weeks ago FanDuel teamed up with the PGA Tour to enhance its golf betting offerings by integrating IMG ARENA’s Golf Event Centre into its Sportsbook platform. This integration introduced new live betting markets and advanced data visualization tools for fans, starting with the FedEx St. Jude Championship.</p>
<p>In July, FanDuel also renewed its partnership with the Women’s Tennis Association (WTA), solidifying its position as the WTA’s authorized gaming partner for the Hologic WTA Tour across the Americas and providing engaging experiences for fans through innovative products and storytelling opportunities.</p>
