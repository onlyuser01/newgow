<p>Leading casino software provider SkillOnNet has made a foray into the regulated German market. The renowned operator entered the European country with a suite of games from Hölle Games, a local slot developer.</p>
<p>SkillOnNet Adds Hölle Games Titles to Its Platform</p>
<p>Hölle Games is a developer that is entirely focused on producing slot games with a distinct “Made in Germany” atmosphere. Its products are tailored to the needs of the German customer and offer exciting betting experiences. In addition, the studio is famous for its proprietary Bonus Spin line of games, which, as the title suggests, engages customers with fun bonus games.</p>
<p>The mutually-beneficial agreement will help both companies expand their footprints and reach new markets. For SkillOnNet, this partnership represents a great opportunity to explore a market it has yet to tap into. Hölle Games, on the other hand, will join SkillOnNet’s network, which will help its products reach a myriad of new players.</p>
<p>Hölle Games Is a Perfect Fit for SkillOnNet</p>
<p>Robert Lenzhofer, co-founder and chief executive of Hölle Games, spoke about the new agreement with SkillOnNet. He praised the latter brand for supplying some of the biggest gambling operators in Europe and beyond. Because of this, Lenzhofer is happy to join the provider’s network and help its products reach new customers.</p>
<p>Lenzhofer added that this is a major moment for the German developer as it continues to work hard to deliver premium gaming experiences to its fans. He added that Hölle Games is known for always being compliant with regulations, which is why it is the perfect choice for operators that wish to target German players.</p>
<p>Jani Kontturi, SkillOnNet’s head of games, also commented on the agreement. He noted that his company wants to provide German players with experiences that exceed their expectations. To that end, Hölle Games is the perfect partner, thanks to its profound understanding of what german players love.</p>
<p>Kontturi also noted that SkillOnNet acknowledges that simply adding more games is rarely enough. Instead, his company seeks to work with studios that are experienced in providing localized content that appeals to the needs of local customers. Konturri firmly believes that Hölle Games is the best fit for SkillOnNet’s operations in Germany.</p>
<p>SkillOnNet continues to expand its global presence by inking partnerships with various renowned casino game developers. A week ago, the provider launched in Ontario and rolled out a suite of games developed by Wazdan. At the beginning of August, SkillOnNet penned an agreement with Gaming Corps and added the latter’s innovative casino content to its platform.</p>
