<p>Gaming and media affiliate HeadsUp Entertainment announced the launch of revenue platforms across all six US gaming jurisdictions in which it has been approved to offer online casino gaming and sports betting, as well in the Canadian Province of Ontario.</p>
<p>Sports Betting Content Creation Daily</p>
<p>The launch of multiple revenue platforms by HeadsUp Entertainment confirmed the company’s focus on the gaming sector since its inception in 2008 and opened opportunities for substantial revenues.</p>
<p>As part of a number of content production initiatives, HeadsUp Entertainment teamed with Enteractive Media, a multi-platform broadcasting and event company based in Calgary, to collaborate on the creation of sports betting content for customer acquisition on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Both partners will feature at the SIGMA America’s iGaming Conference in Toronto, hosting multiple panels and a main stage presentation at the event that will gather industry leaders from the Americas.</p>
<p>HeadsUp Entertainment and Enteractive Media will also partner in a series of super affiliate collaborations starting with Casino Affiliate Partners that is expected to drive monetization for their core sports handicapping and information service viewership base across regulated gaming jurisdictions.</p>
<p>As part of the Casino Affiliate Partners agreement, HeadsUp’s brand GameChangerz will serve as a sublicensed operator across all six US states and Ontario to drive traffic for leading gaming operators such as DraftKings, FanDuel, PointsBet, and others. Throughout North America, this partnership is expected to lead to over 60 affiliate revenue deals.</p>
<p>The partnership is currently negotiating to deliver customer acquisition content for major sports networks in the US and Canada and launch a dedicated football show in Ontario for the start of the NCAAF College Football and NFL seasons, a 30-minute TV show on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Once launched in Ontario, the television football show will be syndicated in the US through social media platform distribution in the form of “call to action” short videos aimed at different demographics and regions. In preparation for that, HeadsUp and Enteractive already launched daily content across the most popular social media platforms, as well as a subscription service.</p>
<p>In line with the exponential growth in regulated online casino and sports betting markets in the past 24 months, the partnership sets itself ambitious performance targets, projecting to generate revenues of approximately $1.3 million in its first year of operation and reach $30 million by year four.</p>
<p>Content will be produced initially in studios in Toronto and Calgary until the plan featuring shot box studios at multiple land-based casinos and sportsbooks materializes.</p>
