<p>Cubee Slot Review</p>
<p>Cubee from Realtime Gaming is a unique game that does not tick the standard boxes that you are normally used to seeing in around 99% of all the video slots on the market right now. The unique and challenging game comes with orbital reels and floating symbols, something our experts do not come across frequently when reviewing new games to recommend to you. With an excellent theme, comic, children’s games-inspired aesthetics, and a potentially big win potential of up to 50,000x the line bet, Cubee is a 2019 release that is expected to keep you engaged for a while, and for good reason.</p>
<p>Here is everything you need to know about the themes, storyline, animations, soundtrack, gameplay, paytable, main features, and our conclusion on the game.</p>
<p>Theme, Storyline, and Graphics: Travel in Time to Help Cubee Join Defeat His Nemesis</p>
<p>Cute, cuddly, comic-looking Cubee is the main character in RTG’s unique title. Cubee warmly invites players to join him in a mesmerizing Time Travel Adventure as he explores different Ages while feeding off his energy balls and trying to beat Rocco the Cyclop to move faster to the upcoming Age.</p>
<p>Every time a new spin is triggered, the eight available floating symbols designed by the creators of the game part of the time vortex will proceed to build up Cubee’s energy level.</p>
<p>This will carry him from the Stone Age straight into the Viking Age. There, he will be busy scooping up more bows and arrows that will be changed into free spins while switching to the Age of Piracy, where he will collect a few cannons that will, later on, be turned into multipliers. While this occurs, players will successfully beat the energy out of Rocco.</p>
<p>As the action unfolds even more on the vividly colored screen with lots of animations, players will need to focus on bringing Cubee back to his home in Cubeeland. There, they will be rewarded with their payouts in the form of multipliers and free spins.</p>
<p>Cubee must find his nemesis in the form of four different monsters ranging from the level 1 green monster, the yellow level 2 monster, the blue level 2 monster, and the red level 4 monster.</p>
<p>The weapons and energy balls have also been designed with the same cartoonish, childish style and aesthetics in mind and they perfectly match the theme and storyline. None of the standard playing card symbols are present, which means the action is not in any way interrupted and players can completely lose themselves in the game.</p>
<p>Cubee: Game Symbols and Payouts</p>
<p>All eight symbols in the game are visible every step of the way, all at the same time since there are no actual reels or pay lines to worry about. Cubee is busy defeating all his enemies who are either at his own level of strength or they are weaker than him. The game is initiated with a strength of 1, which means players should have no problem defeating the weakest enemies. With the help of the energy balls, players will strengthen Cubee and boost his power, eventually helping him defeat those enemies that are stronger than him, once sufficient levels are reached. Once the weapons are seen popping, Cubee’s health level will be drastically lowered. Eventually, this will mean that Cubee will be defeated, with the switch being made to a different era where more exciting action awaits.</p>
<p>All combinations consisting of defeated enemies and energy balls are always counted toward a payout. At the same time, floating monsters who have a superior power level compared to Cubee will not be used to determine the payout. Any combination of six symbols will pay 40 coins.</p>
<p>Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The animations are flawless with the entire game being designed and acting like a computer game in itself. The tribal, fast-paced soundtrack, drum beating, and monster growling sound effects nicely complement the overall theme.</p>
<p>Cubee Gameplay</p>
<p>Once players decide upon the size of their bet using the dedicated plus and minus symbols in the lower right part of the screen, they can click the spin button and wait for the mesmerizing Time Travel Portal to start spewing combinations of eight gloating enemies, along with energy balls and weapons. Cubee has a default strength level for each game round which is set at one. Each time a new energy ball is seen coming out of the portal, it will add one more level to Cubee’s strength during the round. All energy balls count as defeated enemies. Weapons are also used to diminish Rocco’s health. Once the Cyclops is defeated, Cubee can switch to the next era.</p>
<p>All bet amounts have their own progress saved. The maximum win per paid spin is set at 50,000x the bet.</p>
<p>Cubee: Free Games and Multipliers</p>
<p>The free games can be collected in the Era of Piracy once a new cannon pops up. At the same time, the multipliers can be accumulated in the Viking Era once a bow and arrow make an appearance. Free games are played at the multiplier accumulated once the main character in the game reaches Cubeeland, at the bet amount that has been used during all three stages. Once Cubee reaches his homeland, where Rocco the Cyclop is unable to go, there are no more weapons coming out of the time-traveling portal. This means the odds of landing combinations that pay more are much higher.</p>
<p>Final Thoughts</p>
<p>Without a doubt, Cubee by RTG is certainly not your everyday, standard, déjà vu type of slot you could expect to come across in this day and age. On the contrary, the game introduces a unique concept that is well executed, delivering a fair share of one-of-a-kind features and excellent payouts that are prone to make players come back for more. With full mobile compatibility, a system based on orbital reels featuring scatters-dependent wins, and a maximum reward that can go as high as 50,000x the line bet, the game is hard to beat in its category.</p>
