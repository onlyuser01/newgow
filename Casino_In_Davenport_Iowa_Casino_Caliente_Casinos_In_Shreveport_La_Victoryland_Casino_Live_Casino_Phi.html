<p>NuxGame continues to strengthen its portfolio of iGaming titles with the latest addition of ZeusPlay, an established content studio that has a significant reach in both the land-based and online casino sectors.</p>
<p>ZeusPlay is a company known for its innovative and fresh approach to casino game development, combining traditional and innovative themes and features. Among the 50-odd titles developed by the studio are such outstanding titles as Disco Fever, Diamond’s Fortune, and Don Mafioso, all of which are player-favorite titles and have engaging and rewarding gameplay.</p>
<p>Thanks to this collaboration with ZeusPlay, NuxGame will strengthen the content library it provides to partner operators. The developer is also known for the use of HTML5 technology which makes the games it produces fast, intuitive, and easy to run.</p>
<p>The partnership lands additional momentum on NuxGame’s Online Casino platform, which has been established with the idea of providing operators with the infrastructure as well as the content library they need to bring their brands to life.</p>
<p>NuxGames uses a dedicated game aggregation solution that makes the integration of titles simple and straightforward. NuxGame Head of Sales and Business Development Bar Konson said that the expansion of the Online Casino offering with ZeusPlay ensured that the company continues to provide a varied and high-quality content library for its clients.</p>
<p>"We have no doubt ZeusPlay’s titles will perform well with our clients and increase retention and acquisition rates, we anticipate this being a fruitful new partnership," Konson said. This new partnership comes on the tail of similar agreements with Barbara Bang and Espresso Games, two other studios that are now also contributing with their games to NuxGames’ constantly evolving and expanding library of titles.</p>
<p>ZeusPlay CEO Antonis Zlatanos was similarly happy to see his company join NuxGame and help the supplier’s product gain more prominence with respected operators and wider audiences. ZeusPlay is focused on continually adding to its library and will benefit greatly from having more audiences to deliver its games to.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, NuxGame also added products from another developer, RubyPlay, as the company continues to pursue a more diversified portfolio offering when it comes to iGaming titles.</p>
