    <h1>Best Casino In Lake Charles Princess Casino Hollywood Casino Perryville Md Best Casinos Mirax Casino</h1>

<p>I was playing at the Casino and I was withdrawing a little over € 1000 so there was some miracle answer and the withdrawal was rejected. So I had already sent the necessary identification information to this Casino a long time ago. I had received a request (for which I had not even deposited money) on the website of that casino’s sister casino asking for my bank statements, employer and payslips. I reportedly wanted to make sure what money I was playing with, that I wasn’t playing for others, etc. Well, how do I explain when people have paid me the money they lent me, or when my mom puts me money, or when a friend puts me money that lives with me, and I tell him. .. Why does the casino ask you to provide such information when you are repatriating your winnings, but you can even put the stolen money at them at the Casino. I am very disappointed with this kind of activity ...</p>
