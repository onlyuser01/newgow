    <h1>Hard Rock Casino Wheatland 29 Casino Harrah S Casino Kansas City Missouri Atlantic City Hotels Casin</h1>

<p>I tried to make a $1,300.00 withdrawal before having read the terms and conditions. Naturally my withdrawal was reversed. My complaint is mainly that there has been absolutely zero correspondence from Bingo Billy as to why it was denied and reversed. After 2 live chats I was informed that they hadn't received my verification documents although I had in fact sent them via email and fax 4 separate times on 4 different days. Still, at no time has anyone sent me any kind of response as to the status or reason for not processing my withdrawal. They just continue to place the money back into the account. I have:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Deposited within the last 30 days</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Played the 30xs requirement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Withdrew outside the 72 hours since my deposit</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only requested $500 ( the maximum allowed per week for slots)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Made the withdrawal request before Thursday-Sunday</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Submitted a copy of my photo I.D., filled out and returned the credit card approval form, sent copy of credit card,and utility bill via email AND fax.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I did everything they state they require and still could not cash out.</p>
<p>My biggest complaint is the fact that in their own list of requirements it clearly states that with each withdrawal requested that they shall provide you an email as to whether or not your withdrawal was approved or if it was denied. Not once has anyone from Bingo Billy contacted me. Its as though they are dragging their feet, beating around the bush and not acknowledging me in hopes that I will simply go away. Well surprise! I'm definitely going away, far, far away. And I suggest that everyone else considering playing here does the same thing! Never again will I wasted my time or money at the casino ever again! What a bunch of hog wash, rip off artists these people are! Good riddens!</p>
