<p>Toronto-based digital sports media company, Playmaker Capital, has completed an acquisition deal for 100% of the digital assets of US-based World Soccer Talk, a soccer-focused media business. The purchase price was $1.15million and consisted of cash payment, 510,000 newly issued Playmaker shares, and an additional earn-out.</p>
<p>Playmaker Positions Itself to Tap Soccer’s Growing Popularity in the USA</p>
<p>World Soccer Talk is a high-profile US media company focusing on TV and streaming coverage of soccer events, news, and information. The company’s rise in viewers coincides with soccer’s increasing popularity in the USA. It now ranks fourth in popularity after American football, basketball, and baseball. The acquisition is a significant boon to Playmaker, as World Soccer Talk generated a yearly page view count of over 12 million. The company has an iPhone and Android app. Its content includes daily newsletters, podcasts, TV guides, and eBooks.</p>
<p>Playmaker CEO Jordan Gnat stated that the acquisition deal was another step in his company’s efforts to become a leading provider of soccer content across the Americas.</p>
<p>We are excited to welcome… World Soccer Talk into our family and our ecosystem Jordan Gnat, Playmaker CEO</p>
<p>Gnat lauded World Soccer Talk founder Christopher Harris for his commitment to the sport and welcomed the new team into the fold. The CEO noted that their talent would be indispensable during the upcoming World Cups 2022, 2023, and 2026.</p>
<p>World Soccer Talk Joins a Large Family of Successful Brands</p>
<p>With the deal’s conclusion, Playmaker Capital will add World Soccer Talk to its growing collection of successful brands. Among these is the digital media outlet Futbol Sites. The brand focuses on countries such as Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and the US Hispanic market. It is considered the preeminent Latin digital sports provider in the Americas and operates over 20 popular football-related web properties and brands.</p>
<p>Other Playmaker properties include digital sports media platforms Yardbarker and The Nation Network. The company also owns Two-Up, a B2B online gaming technology provider that services some of the leading names in the sports betting industry like William Hill, SkyBet, News International, BetGenius, AtTheRaces, and Sporting Solutions. Playmaker recently purchased US media company The Sports Drop and Brazilian editorial content provider Futmarketing. This most recent acquisition indicates that it plans to continue with its expansion.</p>
<p>Playmaker’s latest progress report indicated that its various properties had gathered over 106 million followers on social media. The media giant has a presence on all major online platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, and Twitch. World Soccer Talk’s sizable fanbase will undoubtedly add to these metrics in the future.</p>
