<p>The global watchdog whose members provide betting data to help detect aberrations in betting patterns and behavior has welcomed the news that 10 Chinese professional snooker players have been sanctioned</p>
<p>The penalties have been handed down by the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA) which opened a probe into 10 players suspected of having manipulated matches in order to realize betting gains through bookmakers.</p>
<p>IBIA’s Data Proves Vital in Cracking Open the Case</p>
<p>IBIA, the International Betting Integrity Association, played an instrumental role in the case, providing detailed data about the suspicious behavior and performance of the player, which helped guide WPBSA as part of its initial investigation. IBIA was able to highlight several suspicious matches that triggered a closer look at the players’ behavior:</p>
<p>Aaron Hill v Zhao Jianbo (Northern Ireland Open Qualifiers)</p>
<p>Bai Langning v Zhou Xintong (British Open)</p>
<p>Chang Binyu v Jamie Jones (British Open)</p>
<p>Yuan Sinjun v Jimmy White (Northern Ireland Open Qualifiers)</p>
<p>Lu Ning v Robert Milkins (European Masters Qualifiers)</p>
<p>IBIA CEO Khalid Ali said that the organization was supportive of WPBSA’s decision and success in prosecuting the case. Ali added that much of this was made possible with the concentrated efforts of IBIA’s members who provided the necessary data to spot the dodgy patterns in the first place.</p>
<p>The chief executive also saw in the latest decision by the watchdog an opportunity to send yet another clear message to professional athletes about the dangers of engaging in match-fixing and the serious consequences this may have on their professional careers and personal lives.</p>
<p>Many Young and Talented Players Impacted</p>
<p>The case has resulted in comprehensive penalties proportionate to the offenses committed by the players. Two players, Liang Wenbo and Li Hiang, were banned for life from the sport and won’t be able to compete any longer. They committed various offenses in 2022.</p>
<p>Another player, Lu Ning, has been suspended for eight years, Yan Bingtao and Chen Zifan have been handed down seven-year-and-six-month suspensions, Zhang Jiankang was suspended for four years and five months, and a four-year suspension was awarded to Bai Langning.</p>
<p>Other players to have been suspended include three years and six months for Zhao Jianbo and three years for Chang Bingyu. Two years and six months were awarded to Zhao Xintong. Commenting on this case, WPBSA chairman Jason Ferguson said that the case was particularly difficult and ultimately – despite the successful outcome – it was heartbreaking to see so many talented young players resort to match-fixing and impinging on the WPBSA Conduct Regulations.</p>
<p>“Those who try to corrupt sport are constantly trying to find new ways to avoid our monitoring processes and this outcome must be taken as a lesson to those who think they can avoid detection,” Ferguson stated flatly.</p>
