<p>Mackenzie Dern Hoping to Bounce Back After a Loss to Yan Xiaonan</p>
<p>Mackenzie Dern is 12-3 overall in her MMA career, with a 7-3 record since joining the UFC. What’s interesting is that each of her three losses happened by decision. Not only that, but those losses happened to real legends of female MMA – Amanda Ribas, Marina Rodriguez, and Yan Xiaonan.</p>
<p>When it comes to Dern’s wins in the UFC, the most impressive ones happened after she came back from a pregnancy break. She won four straight fights after ending the hiatus, and for three of those wins, she was awarded the Performance of the Night bonus.</p>
<p>Each of those wins happened by submission, which is no surprise considering that she’s a true expert in grappling. Dern is the daughter of legendary Brazilian grappler Wellington “Megaton” Dias. She followed in her dad’s footsteps from an early age, winning all sorts of medals in Brazilian jiu-jitsu – gold at the 2016 World Cup, gold at the World 2016 Jiu-Jitsu Championship, and so on.</p>
<p>Angela Hill Seem to Hold the Key to Defeating Dern</p>
<p>Each time Dern lost in MMA, it happened after the final bell. And two of those losses happened in five-round bouts. Angela Hill knows this, which is why you can be 100% certain that her plan is to turn this into a marathon bout.</p>
<p>Luckily for her, she definitely has the stamina needed to five Dern for full 25 minutes. The evidence of this is that 20 of Hill’s 27 professional MMA fights went the distance. This includes each of her last nine UFC fights.</p>
<p>Hill’s got amazing stamina, but her No. 1 advantage over Dern is striking. “Overkill” lands 5.68 significant strikes per minute, which is one of the highest numbers in women’s MMA. She lands a huge volume of kicks and punches, although they’re usually not too powerful. Still, the fact is that she’s got five knockout/technical knockout wins in her portfolio.</p>
<p>Mackenzie Dern vs Angela Hill Prediction</p>
<p>Angela Hill is superior to Mackenzie Dern in terms of striking, however, when it comes to grappling, she’s nowhere near as good as her. If Dern manages to take the fight to the ground, we see no other scenario but another submission win.</p>
<p>Pick: Mackenzie Dern to win by submission</p>
