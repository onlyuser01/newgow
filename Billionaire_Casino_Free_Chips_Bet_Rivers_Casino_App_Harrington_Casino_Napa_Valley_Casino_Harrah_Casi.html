    <h1>Billionaire Casino Free Chips Bet Rivers Casino App Harrington Casino Napa Valley Casino Harrah Casi</h1>

<p>Hello Kristina,</p>
<p>I had on 05.04. Wrote to the casino again and saw today that they replied to me. The casino sent me the amount back to the casino account, allegedly for technical reasons. I'm supposed to start a payout again, but I'm not sure if I'll get my money this time. I copied the history below as you can see. How should I proceed now?</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>
<p>Petra</p>

<p>Hello San,</p>
<p>First of all, I would like to thank you for replying to me for a long time. But you could have written that to me a long time ago, right?</p>
<p>Saw the money in the casino account. Who can guarantee me now and today, if I initiate a payout again, that I won't have to wait so long until I get an answer or the payout will then be transferred to my known account. I don't want to keep chasing my win for so long.</p>
<p>And it could also be that I now want to pay out a different amount, is that okay? If I order the payout, I expect information from you when the money will be transferred to my account. Can I then rely on it? I hope for a positive message from you and a confirmation that I will definitely get my money.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Hello, no money has been received yet. Can't you finally agree that I'll take a part of my profit v. 12/17/21 received. I'm now really tired of having to text them all the time and I don't get an answer. What kind of people are they? If you did that to them, they probably wouldn't think it was great either and they would try everything to get their money, wouldn't they? I'd like to hear from you now, but most of all I'd like to see the money posted to my account. so please It can't be that difficult to answer.</p>
