<p>NetEnt’s Aloha! Cluster Pays transforms itself for the upcoming Christmas holiday to bring a more thematic experience to players from far and wide.</p>
<p>Aloha! Cluster Pays Reinvents Itself for the Christmas Holiday</p>
<p>NetEnt is giving its leading Aloha! Cluster Pays slot a Christmas makeover to vibe with the holiday season and give the well-established Hawaiian slot a new lease of life.</p>
<p>In the touched-up version, your favorite tropical slot has a distinct holiday theme attached to it, bringing Xmas to all NetEnt’s customers in the warmer climates. Conversely, the game will prove a real ray of iGaming sunshine to those caught in the snowy winter.</p>
<p>Aloha! Christmas, as this new iteration styles itself, is a 6-reel, 6-row video slot which comes with NetEnt’s bespoke Cluster Pays and Sticky Re-spins mechanics. The game will sport other signature moves by NetEnt, including Mystery and Multiplier Wild symbols, adding to the excitement of the game.</p>
<p>Holiday Season Celebrated in Fashion</p>
<p>To celebrate the holiday season, NetEnt is powering up the experience with Tiki Bar Free Spins and Tiki Bar Max Free Spins, which come as a source of extra rewards this holiday season. The game will offer 96% return-to-player (RTP) rate players can tap into and enjoy for a chance to escape the cold and warm themselves to some neat payouts!</p>
<p>Commenting on the product, Games Director at NetEnt Carl Ejlertsson has said that combining the well-loved features of the original game with some “twinkling twists” leads to a product that will appeal to players in new and exciting ways.</p>
<p>Aloha! Christmas is a top choice for players who are looking to have something fun to this holiday, Ejlertsson added.</p>
<p>Familiar Gameplay, Low Volatility</p>
<p>Aloha! Christmas is a laidback slot with low to medium volatility you may play on any budget. The game is optimized to run on HTML5 and any device, and has a free version. The slot retains much of its original look and feel, with Stacked Symbols and Multiplier Wild Symbols always readily available for new and exciting payouts.</p>
<p>The multipliers pack a powerful punch and vary from 2x to 7x, depending on the combinations. The Tiki Bar and Tiki Bar Max will bring you a varying number of free spins to top off the holiday experience.</p>
<p>NetEnt’s slot division is going strong with several big releases this year. The company recently gave a fresh makeover to its popular Divine Fortune jackpot game, adding the Megaways mechanic licensed by Big Time Gaming.</p>
<p>The company recently launched Red Tiger slots in Pennsylvania amid a takeover bid that completed earlier this week, with NetEnt’s assets transferring to Evolution, which announced 300 redundancies and shut down NetEnt Live.</p>
