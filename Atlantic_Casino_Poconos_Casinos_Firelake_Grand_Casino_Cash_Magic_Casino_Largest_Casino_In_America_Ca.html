    <h1>Atlantic Casino Poconos Casinos Firelake Grand Casino Cash Magic Casino Largest Casino In America Ca</h1>

<p>Dear complaint resolving team,</p>
<p>Casombie casino refuses to payout my winnings allegedly because of a breach in Terms and Conditions from my side. I believe that this is the false claim from their side and I did not breach their rules. I have exhausted all the direct communication options with the casino and because of that I’m writing this complaint.</p>
<p>On 28.09.22 I’ve won the jackpot in Divine Fortune slot in the amount of 223975$. After that my account was frozen and I received an email with KYC-request.</p>
<p>The KYC-procedure took almost two months, during which Casombie requested immense amount of redundant documents, most of which had no relation to my activity in their casino.</p>
<p>On 23.11.22 casino informed me by phone that they have found some inconsistencies in the documents that I have provided. They proposed to payout half of my winnings and wanted to withheld the other half.</p>
<p>On 25.11.22 I informed casino that because I didn’t receive a written confirmation (they refused to provide it) of the proposal I consider it non-existent in a legal sense. And hence I cannot respond to it.</p>
<p>On 30-th of November I received an email from Casombie, in which they suggested to sign a waive letter (which was not discussed with me before), according to which I receive a refund of my deposits and also 5000$ on top of that as goodwill gesture.</p>
<p>In the waive letter Casombie claimed that I’ve had no legal right to register and play in their casino because of my Ukrainian citizenship. I was absolutely surprised by this claim, because at this moment it has already been two months since the KYC-procedure have started and it was the first time when I’ve heard from them that I allegedly had no legal right to play in Casombie because I have Ukrainian passport.</p>
<p>On 03.12.22 I responded with the demand of full payment of the entire winnings amount.</p>
<p>I consider the allegations invalid and the investigation of the casino to be incorrect because of the following reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Before registering in Casombie, I’ve communicated with the livechat support of the casino explaining my circumstances and they confirmed that I can play.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I indeed am an inhabitant and resident of Thailand. This fact clearly follows from the documents that I’ve provided to the casino. Namely from my Thai Bank account Statement (it is impossible to open a bank account in Thailand without a residency status) and by my Residency Certificate from Thailand Immigration Office.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Also photos of my Thai visas confirm that I stay in Thailand for more than 180 days, which automatically makes me the resident according to Thai legislation.</p>
<p>Based on the above I assume that it is clear that I have the right to act as a Thailand resident while playing in an online casino in current circumstances.</p>
<ol>
<li>T&amp;C of Casombie states the list of excluded jurisdictions. It is directly stated in clause 2.3 that the person who lives or is located on the territory of Ukraine has no right to open an account in Casombie. I am not living and not located in Ukraine for quite a long time already. Nothing is said about citizenship in this clause. The statement refers to the residency status only.</li>
</ol>
<p>The employees of the casino knew about my citizenship. Why didn’t they immediately inform me that I have allegedly violated some clause in terms in conditions? I suspect that in an imaginable event of me losing all my deposited money Casombie would not pay attention to the fact that I’m a citizen of Ukraine and would not return my funds. It seems to me that the employees of the casino have searched for a long time for something they can nitpick. They didn’t have success in finding any violations in my other documents and that’s why they payed attention to my citizenship despite their own rules.</p>
<p>All in all, I consider my rights to be flagrantly violated. I think that Casombie casino creates non-contractual conditions, which interfere with implementation of the rights of the consumer. I think that casino’s actions fit the definition of aggressive commercial activity. According to the Directive of May 11, 2005 No. 2005/29/EC, commercial practice shall be regarded as aggressive if, in its factual context, taking account of all its features and circumstances, by harassment, coercion, including the use of physical force, or undue influence, it significantly impairs or is likely to significantly impair the average consumer's freedom of choice or conduct with regard to the product and thereby causes him or is likely to cause him to take a transactional decision that he would not have taken otherwise.</p>
<p>I would not have registered or played in Casombie if I knew that they will not honestly payout my winnings. I am sure that the casino abuses their power and acts illegally.</p>
<p>I’ve described the situation very briefly and I am ready to provide any other information needed. I attach the screenshots of my full correspondence with Casombie and some other documents.</p>
