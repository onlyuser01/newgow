    <h1>Cast Of Casino Royale 1967 Ladyluck Casino Niagara Falls Casino Canada Caf Casino Buffalo Bill S Res</h1>

<p>Good afternoon I am writing to you to help you resolve the issue with 747live.net! I am shocked by this company and the situation, how they ignore my request for payment and that they tell me their license number.</p>
<p>I registered on the 747live.net website on September 9 and uploaded my documents to the site. Didn't play on their site until September 21st. Сейчас на моем балансе 503.33 USD и они отказываются выплачивать мне мои деньги, так же как и называть номер лицензии свой компании FUN EXTREME N.V.</p>
<p>The situation went like this: I requested a withdrawal of 100USD from my account, they canceled my payment and told me to upload my documents. But I uploaded my documents when registering on September 9, which means they didn’t even bother to check them.</p>
<p>After that, she wrote that I needed to go through the video verification procedure and schedule a call on the calendar. I chose September 26th. On September 23, I wrote them a letter and chatted with the agents about the fact that I don’t speak English and how the call would proceed. This message was ignored and I did not receive any response.</p>
<p>On September 26, there was a video call that lasted literally a few minutes, I tried to answer something as best I could, but since I don’t speak English, they hung up. After that, I started writing them a support chat why they ended the call and what next, to which they replied that since I don’t speak English, they hung up. But I wrote to them a few days before the call that I do not speak English, I have a lot of screenshots of my letters to them and communications with the support chat as well.</p>
<p>Now they sent me a letter that I was prohibited from registering on the site and they can return my deposit. But this is a lie, my country was not in the prohibited countries, they deliberately added it there.</p>
<p>Now I want to get the truth and file a complaint against them wherever I can, because people need to know what kind of scammers they are. At the moment they don’t even want to provide me with their license number, which for some reason is not listed.</p>
<p>I have a lot of screenshots with their support and my email to them which have benn just ignored. But what they did, adding my country to the list of prohibited ones specifically so as not to pay me winnings, is fantastic.</p>
