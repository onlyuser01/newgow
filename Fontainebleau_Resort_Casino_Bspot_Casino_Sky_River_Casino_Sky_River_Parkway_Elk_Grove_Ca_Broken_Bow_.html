<p>Tennessee Titans vs Indianapolis Colts is an AFC South duel that will take place at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis on Sunday, October 2. Each team has won just one game in 2022, meaning that their duel in Week 4 carries a lot of significance, especially given the fact that their divisional rivals, the Jacksonville Jaguars, are doing great this season.</p>
<p>The main problem for both Tennessee and Indy is that their offenses haven’t been very productive. The Colts are the AFC team with the least number of points scored in 2022, while the Titans are the fifth worst in the conference.</p>
<p>This is very surprising considering that both teams have some amazing players on their offensive teams, especially in the running department. In fact, the Titans vs Colts is the clash between two arguably best running backs in the AFC, Derrick Henry (Tennessee) and Jonathan Taylor (Indianapolis).</p>

<p>Can Derrick Henry Produce Anything in Week 4?</p>
<p>Derrick Henry is the crucial player for the Titans, who’s recorded two rushing touchdowns so far in 2022, which accounts for one-third of all TDs scored by Tennessee this season. Not only is he their best player, but their strategy this year is to focus on him. The evidence of this is that almost 48% of Tennessee’s plays in the three games of the 2022 season were run plays.</p>
<p>Although Henry sure is one of the best running backs in the NFL (if not the very best one!), we might not see him perform too great in Week 4. The thing is that he doesn’t have a great record against Indy, with just six TDs scored in 12 Titans vs Colts games.</p>
<p>Further, in 2022, the Colts are doing great when it comes to rush defense. This is the team that’s allowed the fewest run yards in the league.</p>
<p>Jonathan Taylor Ready to Score His Second TD of the Season?</p>
<p>It’s no surprise that the Colts defense is great at stopping opposition running backs when they got Jonathan Taylor to practice with every week. Indy’s running back was one of the stars of the conference last year and is generally considered one of the top runners in the league.</p>
<p>In 2022, he hasn’t done too great, scoring just one rushing touchdown so far. This, of course, doesn’t mean that he was playing poorly. It’s just that his team was focused more on the passing game. That proved to be the right decision last weekend when they got to their first win of the season.</p>
<p>The Colts defeated the mighty Kansas City Chiefs 20-17, with QB Matt Ryan throwing for the decisive touchdown in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>Tennessee Titans vs Indianapolis Colts Prediction</p>
<p>If the Colts manage to stop Derick Henry, the Titans are in a lot of trouble. Their offense just won’t be able to do much in that case, while their defense probably isn’t going to be able to stop Indy’s running backs. Further, knowing that Matt Ryan has started to get the pieces back together, the Colts are likely to be very dangerous in the passing department as well.</p>
<p>Picks: Indianapolis Colts to win and cover the spread; under to hit</p>
