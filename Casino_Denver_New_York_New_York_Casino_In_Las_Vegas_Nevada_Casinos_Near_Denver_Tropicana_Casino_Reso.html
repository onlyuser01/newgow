    <h1>Casino Denver New York New York Casino In Las Vegas Nevada Casinos Near Denver Tropicana Casino Reso</h1>

<p>I am writing to seek your assistance in bringing to light a concerning situation that I have encountered with Betboom Casino. As an online casino player residing in Thailand and originally from Israel, I have recently won a substantial amount of over 1000 EUR while playing on their platform. However, Betboom Casino is now refusing to honor my winnings and is attempting to justify their actions through questionable means.</p>
<p>I want to emphasize that at no point during my interactions with Betboom Casino was it explicitly stated that Israeli citizens or residents are prohibited from playing on their platform. Their Terms and Conditions indeed contain the list of prohibited countries but not Israel and not Thailand are not on that list. In fact, I have screenshots of my interactions with their customer support team where they confirmed that Israel was not listed as a prohibited country on their website. This implies that I was under the impression that I was playing within the terms of their platform and their rules.</p>
<p>Despite these interactions, Betboom Casino is now claiming that they intend to add Israel to their list of prohibited countries in the future. This sudden change in their stance seems arbitrary and unjust, as it appears to be an attempt to retroactively justify withholding my winnings. It's important to note that I have already secured evidence of their previous stance through the screenshots of our conversations.</p>
<p>The situation raises serious concerns about Betboom Casino's integrity and their commitment to fair play. I am deeply disappointed and frustrated by their actions, which have not only caused financial distress but have also shaken my confidence in the online gaming industry.</p>
<p>Please let me know if there are any steps I can take or if you require any further information, such as the screenshots and evidence I've mentioned.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time and understanding. I look forward to any support you can provide in addressing this unjust situation.</p>
<p>P.S. I have attached screenshots with some of the most ridiculous quotes for the chat with BetBoom support.</p>
