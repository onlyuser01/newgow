    <h1>Metropolis Illinois Casino Red Hawk Resort Casino Casino Royale Theme Cherokee Casino Concerts Win R</h1>

<p>The new game is a familiar-looking title packed with innovative features that players are going to adore</p>
<p>Yggdrasil, an industry-leading iGaming content provider and publisher, has teamed up with the gaming studio Reflex Gaming, releasing a new slot. The new game is called Fast Fruits DoubleMax and is best described as a classic-looking game with a “supercharged twist.“</p>
<p>Fast Fruits DoubleMax Metrics</p>
<p>Rows: 3</p>
<p>Reels: 5</p>
<p>Paylines: 20</p>
<p>RTP: 95.5%</p>
<p>Min/Max Bet: 0.20/100</p>
<p>Max Win: 20,000x</p>
<p>A Modern Twist of a Classic Game</p>
<p>The new title is a fruit-themed slot featuring many familiar symbols, such as Lucky 7s, bonus symbols and, of course, fruit.</p>
<p>The game sports the DoubleMax feature that removes any winning combination from the reels, with a multiplier doubling with every winning outcome during a single spin. Thanks to this pop-and-drop feature, players can win huge prizes with a single wager. The multiplier resets only after a losing cascade.</p>
<p>In addition, after every winning spin, a wild with a possible modifier will appear on the reels, allowing players to make additional combinations. Modifiers can include Super Wilds, Boost Wilds, Each Way Wilds and regular Wilds.</p>
<p>Player excitement is further boosted by a Free Spins mode that is triggered when gamblers land on three or more bonus symbols. Three symbols award 7 spins, four symbols provide 10 and five give a whopping 13 free spins. During the bonus, the multiplier starts at 1x and builds up without resetting after every spin.</p>
<p>A gamble feature allows players to stake their free spins for a chance to win more. However, if their wager is unsuccessful, they will lose all spins.</p>
<p>If players want to skip straight to the action, they can buy 7 spins with the price depending on their bet. Alternatively, they can use the Golden Bet feature which increases their stake by 25% while doubling their chance to naturally trigger free spins.</p>
<p>The new game is a familiar-looking title that is nevertheless packed with innovative features that players are going to adore.</p>
<p>A Great Addition to Reflex’s Portfolio</p>
<p>Yggdrasil’s chief gaming officer, Mark McGinley, said that the pairing of the DoubleMax mechanic with a fruit genre game makes Fast Fruits DoubleMax a slot that would appeal to both casino traditionalists and modern players who desire fast-paced, high-volatility gameplay.</p>
<p>With giant win potential on every spin, as well as numerous wilds bringing new elements to the reels with every appearance, there is a lot to love in our latest launch! Mark McGinley, CGO, Yggdrasil</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Reflex Gaming’s chief product officer, Mat Ingram, said that his team desires to create titles that players love to play. He is certain that Fast Fruits DoubleMax is precisely one such title.</p>
<p>We took the classic fruit theme and modernized it with the DoubleMax GEM, as well as our own brand-new WILD mechanic. With giant multiplier potential, wilds can then trigger a pay-both-ways mechanic, there’s plenty in it for gamers of all appetites. Mat Ingram, CPO, Reflex Gaming</p>
<p>In May, Reflex Gaming and Yggdrasil published a potion-themed slot called Purrfect Potions.</p>
