<p>Wild Mantra review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Wild Mantra is a mountaintop retreat based around Tibetan Buddhist prayer wheels. The real life prayer wheel often has the ‘om mani padme hum,’ written around the outside. Here it has the symbols of the slot machine: card suits, lotus blossoms, mandala circles, waves and knots.</p>
<p>These are done in the abstracted art style that echoes Tibetan monastery decorations while also putting a modern spin on them.</p>
<p>It is a relaxing and unusual theme, one which works beautifully with the give and take of hope and profit that marks each spin of the slot just as it does a spin of the wheel.</p>

<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The graphics are beautiful. A simple digital watercolour of mountains makes for a serene background.</p>
<p>Each reel is represented by a segmented prayer wheel, in a perfect example of fitting form to theme, and the reels have a simplistic style in the design which meshes nicely with the more detailed and complex 3D animation of the reels and the win indicators.</p>
<p>The music is perfectly matched to the visuals with a rich and varied soundscape for the win and spin sounds.</p>
<p>Player gets one respin whenever one new Wild symbol hits the board</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Wild Mantras is a five prayer-reel, four row slot machine.</p>
<p>The game uses 25 win lines and sports a fun twist on its Wilds (see below for details on this and on the bonus game).</p>
<p>There is no gamble feature, but the game is paced well enough to maintain the player's interest without one.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter symbol. All Wilds come in stacks of four.</p>
<p>When a Wild lands on a reel, it triggers a free respin. Any further Wilds that land during the respins trigger a further respin. When this happens, any other Wilds are moved so that a further Wild in the stack joins the reel.</p>
<p>Three Scatter symbols pay out fifty times the player’s bet per line, four pay out five hundred times and five Scatters pay out a whopping 25,000 times.</p>
<p>In addition to the payouts, three or more Scatter symbols trigger ten free spins. In the first spin, one Wild is guaranteed to appear at the top of one reel. All Wilds that land during the free spins stay in place until the final spin. If the player fills a reel with Wilds, they are awarded a further free spin.</p>

<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.30%, in the ballpark of our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.25 up to a maximum of $/£/€125.00 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is low to medium, which makes it a bad match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>

<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>If looks were all we went on, Wild Mantra would get a recommendation with flying colours.</p>
<p>As is, we don’t have much in the way of harsh criticism. The RTP could be higher. So could the volatility. But on the whole Wild Mantra does what it does well, and with great style.</p>
<p>We highly can recommend this slot for gameplay. But not to those players who are using our slot machine strategies. The volatility is too low.</p>
