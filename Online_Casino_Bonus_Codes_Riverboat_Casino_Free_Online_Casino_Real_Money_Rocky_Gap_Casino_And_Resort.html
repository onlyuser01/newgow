<p>Gaming Corps, one of the fastest-growing iGaming developers, and Kindred Group, one of the world’s most prominent operators of online casino brands, have entered a new content partnership that will see the studio inject fresh additions to Kindred’s sprawling library of titles.</p>
<p>This time, Gaming Corps is bringing its Crash and Plinko products to the gaming group and its many established brands. Moving forward, Kindred will have access to Gaming Corps’ esteemed titles and introduce them to brands such as Unibet, Storspelare and Vlad Casino.</p>
<p>A big focus of the partnership is of course the Crash and Plink products, but Kindred Group will have access to the studio’s Slots and Mine game options as well. This will power up the brands and allow them to quickly scale their offer with fresh content.</p>
<p>Gaming Corps is also going to expand the content alliance by introducing custom-branded games that will add to the distinguishable character of each of Kindred Group’s brands and unique atmosphere. Commenting on the latest opportunity, Kindred Group Head of Casino Gareth Jennings said that the group was thrilled to see fresh content from Gaming Corps arrives on its platform.</p>
<p>More importantly, Jennings explained that Gaming Corps shared the group’s ethos for responsible gambling and the need for a varied and high-quality portfolio that helps brands stand apart from the crowd. "This along with the addition of custom content is why we see this studio as being an exciting addition for our players," Jennings said.</p>
<p>Gaming Corps Head of Commercial Danielle Calafato was similarly pleased to see the supplier’s content portfolio enter with some of the world’s best brands, and Kindred Group’s distinguished casinos. "Whenever we add additional distribution it’s a credit to the team here and gaining access to audiences as extensive as those that Kindred can offer, make these deals even more rewarding," Calafato said.</p>
<p>Calafato was similarly excited to see that the game categories and specific titles developed by Gaming Corps were already enjoying a strong reception with some of the industry’s biggest names and most prominent players. Gaming Corps has been expanding quickly over the past several weeks.</p>
<p>The company struck a partnership with Play North last week agreeing to provide its content to several of the operator’s brands, including Kansino, Kiirkasiino, and Pikakasino, among others.</p>
