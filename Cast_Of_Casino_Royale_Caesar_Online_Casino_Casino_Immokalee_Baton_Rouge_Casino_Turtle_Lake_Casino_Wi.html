<p>SCCG Management, a full-service consultancy for gambling companies, has agreed to provide the dynamic game provider BGaming with its services. The former company will advise its new client on how to develop its business in North America.</p>
<p>SCCG Management to Support BGaming</p>
<p>As announced by Stephen Crystal, SCCG Management’s founder and chief executive officer, his company will supply strategic consulting and business growth services to its new partner. As per the agreement, SCCG will help BGaming boost its growth and launch its critically-acclaimed games in more regulated online casinos.</p>
<p>BGaming’s main objective is to expand its digital presence and score agreements with more operators. This, in turn, will help its content launch in more regulated markets and, by extension, will help the company grow. SCCG Management’s job will be to provide BGaming with crucial advice on how to best achieve this. To that end, it will leverage its three decades of experience and its experienced consultancy team.</p>
<p>This agreement is in line with BGaming’s belief that an operator must know its customers very well and provide them with enough player choice to keep them engaged. To achieve this, BGaming’s team keeps on studying its player base very carefully. SCCG Management’s advice will be a valuable addition to BGaming’s efforts to better understand its target audience.</p>
<p>SCCG Is a “Natural Fit” According to Bgaming’s Director</p>
<p>CEO Crystal spoke about the new agreement with the game provider. He noted that SCCG Management’s team is thrilled by the opportunity to work with BGaming and support its fast-growing iGaming content with the consultancy’s services.</p>
<p>Crystal noted that both SCCG and BGaming are very experienced in their respective fields and will, therefore, be a power duo.</p>
<p>BGaming and SCCG form a veteran duo with a combined 50 years of experience in iGaming. We have a great presence in the online casino industry at SCCG. Our best-in-class resources and services, paired with BGAMING’s online casino games, will fill a major gap in this growing industry. Stephen Crystal, CEO, SCCG Management</p>
<p>Marina Ostrovtsova, BGaming’s director, also shared her thoughts. She called SCCG Management a “natural fit” for BGaming’s ambitions. Ostrovtsova noted that her company hopes to usher in a new generation of retention-oriented content in North America and help many operators engage their players with premium online casino content.</p>
<p>SCCG was a natural fit with our aligned goal of launching the next generation of retention oriented content in the North American market. Together we’re excited to help new studios go live and to help operators better engage their players. Marina Ostrovtsova, director, BGaming</p>
<p>A month ago, SCCG Management also supported the NA expansion of Low6, an award-winning sports gamification platform.</p>
