<p>What is your take or opinion on players that have a gambling addiction to the unhealthy and cant control themselves around gambling?</p>
<p>Do you feel the best way of dealing with something as strong and potentially devastating as a strong addiction is avoidance? Avoiding casinos or any other gambling hall, bingo hall in hopes there inner addict doesn't come out.</p>
<p>My personal opinion of this is the same way i feel about any addiction of alcohol, cigarettes or drugs, anything that can posses you do its bidding and takes away your free will cannot be helped, cured or relieved by avoiding it just letting it sit for the day when your weak and forgetful, maybe accidentally pass by the gambling hall from work , sooner than you realize you'll be back at it ! Because it never left you, it just was waiting its time to act. The only way is to talk about it, ask your family, friends for help, they will admire your strength in being able to ask another for help! Trust me. Go to a gambler anonymous or group therapy sessions, face it head on and be open to new ideas and ways to cope with feelings inside yourself. Don't let it sit and wait for the time you least expect it and resistance inst strong.</p>
<p>Anyone have any comments or advice for others? Please share your mind.</p>
