<p>Pragmatic Play has been meticulously building up its global presence, with the latest commercial partnership signed by the supplier and developer of online casino content focusing on the Latin American market, and Venezuela in particular. The company has signed a new partnership with a prominent local operator, Liderendeportes.bet, which has welcomed the opportunity to work with Pragmatic Play and expand its pull with local players.</p>
<p>Commenting on this opportunity, Liderendeportes.bet President Felipe Saldivia said that signing with the company was great news for the company, but also for its players who are looking to engage with the best possible form of content and gaming.</p>
<p>"We’re committed to providing the best quality experience and this new parentship will allow us to continue doing just that," Saldivia assured. Pragmatic Play brings a variety of game genres that will now be available to the operator, including games across slots, live casinos, and virtual sports products. All of these verticals are popular in regulated iGaming markets across the region.</p>
<p>Among the titles that players will enjoy as part of the new content alliance are options such as Fury of Odin Megaways, Bonanza CandyLand, Mega Wheel, Gates of Olympus, and Sugar Rush to name a few. Players can further explore Greyhound Racing and Fore 1, Horse as part of the new virtual sports products.</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play VP of LatAm Operations Victor Arias was happy with the opportunity to see the supplier launch with a prominent brand as Liderendeportes.bet and plunge into the Venezuelan iGaming market.</p>
<p>Once again, said Arias, the company was able to supply a multi-vertical package to a trusted and respected local partner that would undoubtedly help Pragmatic Play build up its prominence in the region much in the same way that Pragmatic would help Liderendeportes.bet makes an impression on its players.</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play has been building its commercial momentum worldwide of late. The company teamed up with Azerion’s Whow Games for even more worthwhile opportunities in the German market.</p>
<p>The company has also been working on its products launching Diamond Dazzle Bingo and a new virtual sports Darts product. Pragmatic play continues to build up its portfolio and offering by teaming up with new operators and ramping up production.</p>
