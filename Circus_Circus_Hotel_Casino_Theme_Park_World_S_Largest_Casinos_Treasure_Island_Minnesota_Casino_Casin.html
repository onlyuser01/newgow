    <h1>Circus Circus Hotel Casino Theme Park World S Largest Casinos Treasure Island Minnesota Casino Casin</h1>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>The below is the email I have replied to mrsloty they have took extra money from my bank account. "It’s really easy to calculate add up the amount deposited into my mrsloty gaming account from BSYSTEMS LIMITED (£388) it’s my lifetime net deposit. Then add up the total number taken from my bank account (£587.95) that’s a total difference of £199.95 that’s gone missing it’s left my bank account never made it into the mrsloty (never requested this payment to be deposited) you guys have literally taken an extra £199.95 from me and the money isn’t accounted for. If someone could contact me urgently"</p>
<p>Second email sent - "I have pictures and matched the transactions up for you so it’s clear and easy to see :)</p>
<p>Number 1 (£131 deposit at 12.40pm - Matches with Number 1 on my bank statement (£130.93)</p>
<p>Number 2 (£76 deposit at 2.09pm - Matches with Number 2 on my bank statement (£76.50)</p>
<p>Number 3 (£81 deposit at 2.11pm - Matches with number 3 on my bank statement (£81.83)</p>
<p>Number 4 (£100 deposit at 3.33pm - Matches with number 4 on my bank statement (£100.79)</p>
<p>All of those payments are perfect and all match up I have had 4 successful deposits with mrsloty however as you can see there has been 5 separate payments removed from my bank account so there has been 1 extra payment taken and I don’t know where the money has gone the payment I am now querying about is the random £197.90 that’s been taken from my bank account by you guys at MrSloty I’ve never tried to deposit that sum on the 1 transaction, the two deposits that were cancelled and unsuccessful are completely irrelevant and I’m not worried about them.</p>
<p>I just want you guys to tell me why £197.90 has been taken from my bank account on the same day ?? Can you tell me why thanks.</p>
<p>Live chat nor email are now replying to me now they’ve literally stole money from me and I want it back can you help thanks ! I have attached the phoots for you guys to look at and hope you can see and understand where I’m coming from</p>
