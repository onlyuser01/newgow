    <h1>7Bit Casino San Manuel Indian Bingo Casino Wildhorse Casino Pendleton Oregon Sc Casino Westgate Las</h1>

<p>Dear all,</p>
<p>All what I am writing today can be proved by screen shots and by evidences (emails, etc…).</p>
<p>I am a big player with comfortable situation. I won’t disclose the amounts played but I just inform that I did play huge amounts.</p>
<p>This casino assigned to me a VIP Manager (Anastasiya).</p>
<p>Apart from being unable to reply to some technical issues this is my last experience (may 9, 2022) :</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>there is a weekly cash back that player should ask for. It is not automatic, if you forget to request it you won’t have it. Anastasiya did send me the paragraph confirming this from Terms and Conditions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>once I knew that, every Monday I send a WhatsApp message and emails to get the bonus credited.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Monday may, 9 2022 (three days ago), I did as usual make the same request.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>No response from my account manager whereas she read my WhatsApp messages. No réponses to my emails sent to the vip and even support service.</p>
<p>I know that my cashback is usually big but I play big also (formula is 15% of last week deposit minus bonus and withdraws).</p>
<p>As a conclusion : apart from unfair T&amp;C, this casino have a bad support, a bad vip service so also a bad Management.</p>
<p>I don’t recommend it to big players at all : it’s really the worst I did ever know (I play on so many others that I can list).</p>
<p>I am considering a complaint to their higher Managers since it looks support team and VIP team are partners in mediocrity. If I have any relevant reaction from them, I will fairly change this feedback.</p>
<p>As told in the beginning : I have all the material to prove all what I written here</p>
