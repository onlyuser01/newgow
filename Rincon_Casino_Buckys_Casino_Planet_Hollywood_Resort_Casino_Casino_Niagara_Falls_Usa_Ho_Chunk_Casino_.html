<p>The global managed hosting, cloud, security and connectivity provider, Continent 8, expanded further its presence in the United States after announcing the launch of additional sites in five states. The company confirmed Thursday it expanded further its presence in Kansas, Louisiana, Iowa, Illinois, as well as Puerto Rico, by launching secondary sites.</p>
<p>The recent launch complements the ongoing growth of the company and its existing multi-site in-state infrastructure established in strategic markets such as Pennsylvania, Michigan, New Jersey, Indiana, Colorado and Arizona. Thanks to the launch of secondary sites in Kansas, Iowa, Illinois, Louisiana and Puerto Rico, the company now offers "secondary and disaster recovery solutions," a statement reveals.</p>
<p>Justin Cosnett, Continent 8's Chief Product Officer, shared his excitement saying: "Data center resilience is an important consideration for infrastructure planning." He added: "We also know that regulators across various states want to see licensed operators deliver resilient and reliable services to customers and partners."</p>
<p>Cosnett explained that the company continues to expand its presence by enabling suppliers and operators within the vertical to benefit from its "diverse MPLS-connected backbone to create disaster recovery, backup or even active-active capabilities to guarantee availability."</p>
<p>According to the Chief Product Officer, an established multi-site in-state infrastructure enables the company to provide its clients with off-site backup service that is delivered thanks to the company's regulated Public iGaming Cloud solution. "Ultimately, we’re providing the very best infrastructure solutions so that customers can concentrate on what they do best – focus on the success of their business," said Cosnett in conclusion.</p>
<p>To ensure its compliance within multiple North American jurisdictions, Continent 8 continues its collaboration with regulators within the gambling vertical. The company seeks to ensure its compliance as it enters new states and delivers its solutions and services to new partners. Currently, some of the biggest online gambling and sports betting operators in the US leverage Continent 8's award-winning solutions.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Continent 8 announced it hired two regional sales directors. Back in January, the company confirmed it hired the services of Randy J. Alessio and Nigel Renouf.</p>
<p>As noted, the latest launch of secondary sites will further expand Continent 8's reach. It was last year when the company launched its first website in Puerto Rico, while back in 2021, it entered the markets in Louisiana and Kansas by launching its services for partners in the two states. Before that, in 2020, Continent 8 launched its services in Illinois, while 2019 marked the company's Iowa entry.</p>
