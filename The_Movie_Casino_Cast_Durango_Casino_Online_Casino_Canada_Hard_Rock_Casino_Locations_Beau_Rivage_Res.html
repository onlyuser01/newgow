    <h1>The Movie Casino Cast Durango Casino Online Casino Canada Hard Rock Casino Locations Beau Rivage Res</h1>

<p>Goldwin's notorious for doing their very best to delay withdrawals as much as humanly possible. I had a verified account with them and it still took them over a month to process my withdrawal because they wanted me to reverify my account and kept rejecting the documents I sent for random reasons.</p>
<p>They also really like to cancel your withdrawal so you're tempted to play more, so whatever you do, don't keep playing.</p>
<p>In my experience, they eventually pay out your winnings if you keep sending them what they ask for. They are far from a fair casino, though, and I'll never deposit a cent in that casino ever again.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I have no suggestion for you in your specific situation. I think that if you don't have the physical card you should stop using it for depositing anywhere and just order a new one.</p>
