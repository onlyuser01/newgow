    <h1>Tropicana Casino Resort Maria Casino Bovada Casino Log In Atlantic City Casinos On The Boardwalk Bin</h1>

<p>Adding the feature to other Blackjack tables was an easy decision to make, Dejan Loncar said</p>
<p>Stakelogic Live, Stakelogic’s live casino division, has enhanced the blackjack experience for live casino enthusiasts by incorporating the Super Stake Blackjack feature into all American Blackjack tables. The addition is set to “take the live casino blackjack experience to the next level”, the company said.</p>
<p>Super Stake Blackjack is a proprietary Stakelogic product that was first released in November 2022. Proving to be a resounding success with both operators and players, Super Stake Blackjack has now inspired Stakelogic to take its features and add them to all dedicated American Blackjack games.</p>
<p>Similar to the Super Stake feature Stakelogic’s slots players are familiar with, the Super Stake Blackjack feature allows players to pay 50% more to increase their winning potential. The feature allows players to multiply their main bets from 2x up to 100x, allowing them to rake in big wins.</p>
<p>Once all bets are placed, players who have activated Super Stake will have up to six Multiplier Cards appear on their screen. Each card will display a multiplier of up to x50. If a player wins a hand using one or two cards with multipliers, their bet will be increased correspondingly.</p>
<p>Stakelogic Is Happy to Take Blackjack to the Next Level</p>
<p>Stakelogic Live’s newly-appointed head of live casino, Dejan Loncar, commented on the matter, expressing his excitement about the addition of the Super Stake feature into all American Blackjack tables.</p>
<p>Super Stake Blackjack has been a huge success for Stakelogic Live, so taking its features and adding them to our other Blackjack tables was an easy decision to make. Dejan Loncar, head of live casino, Stakelogic Live</p>
<p>Loncar added that the new addition will allow his team to “take the blackjack experience to the next level,” further elevating Stakelogic’s blackjack portfolio.</p>
<p>In other news, Stakelogic recently introduced a major update to the user interface of its proprietary slot games. Thanks to that, players can now enjoy an enhanced and more intuitive experience while playing one of the supplier’s cutting-edge gaming titles.</p>
<p>The reformed UI was introduced ahead of the release of a new feature. Stakelogic promised that the upcoming feature (set to launch on November 9, 2023) will revolutionize gaming. However, the company did not disclose much more, allowing fans and industry enthusiasts to theorize.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Stakelogic just provided Chroma Key Studio to One Casino and 777.nl, expanding its presence in the Dutch gaming market.</p>
