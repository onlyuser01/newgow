    <h1>Casinos With Hotels Near Me Casino Games With Best Odds Cast Casino Draftkings At Casino Queen Winst</h1>

<p>It's about the following: I've actually been playing at Machance-Casino for several years (and also in the partner casinos vegasplus &amp; unique) and have never had any problems with payouts (even if the identity check is more than just tedious)...this time but apparently everything is different .... A renewed check of my address made the beginning, which took forever, but then after almost 10 days it was turned positive and accepted! Then I was able to make my payment request on October 9th (normally 3-5 days is in the terms and conditions)...after 5 days I asked and was put off until the beginning of next week...next week came and another employee from livechat explained to me that it is because I have to wait longer because I have a too high "payout ratio" (apparently means that I paid out more than I paid in)...I find that per se cheeky - but ok. ..pass it on 5 days later I wanted to ask again, I see the payout (1500 euros) again on my casino account - and after quite agitated inquiry I got the explanation "technical error" - please apply again...Without further explanation and despite Great skepticism on my part, I applied for a payout again on October 20th...Now I was back in the live chat today - October 27th - and got the "explanation" that the casino had changed banks and it was therefore taking longer...without specifying how long "longer" means... For me it's clearly a delaying tactic... Now I unfortunately made the mistake (out of emotion) to threaten them with a lawyer in the live chat - whereupon I was "temporarily blocked". ..Now I really don't know what to do...</p>
<p>My question to you now would be: Can you help me? Or tell me how to proceed? I'm really at my wit's end and know from buddies that you can often give good advice or even be directly helpful! Please for your support, glg thomas</p>
