<p>Good day! I am asking you for help in resolving my problem. Parimatch Casino unjustifiably confiscated my $ 4070 winnings, accusing me of providing invalid documents.</p>
<p>The problem itself arose back on February 03, 2021, when I could not withdraw my money, the casino justified this with technical problems. Various personal documents were then requested.</p>
<p>05.02 I uploaded a photo of my ID card on both sides and my selfie with this card.</p>
<p>On February 15, at the casino's request, I sent a screenshot of my Skrill electronic wallet showing transactions in favor of Parimatch.</p>
<p>On February 18, I sent a selfie with an ID card in the background of correspondence with the support service (as requested by the casino).</p>
<p>22.02 sent in higher quality.</p>
<p>Later, March 15, March 28, March 31, I sent my selfie with an ID card at the request of the casino.</p>
<p>I confirm that all documents sent by me belong to me and are valid. I didn't use any editing software.</p>
<p>I can assume that the casino perceived the photo on the back of the ID card as edited, but it is on the back of the card in this form.</p>
<p>After the accusations against me, I asked the casino to provide evidence of my guilt, however, the casino did not want to explain anything, canceling my winnings in the amount of 4070 US dollars. I believe that the casino is violating my rights, accusing me of something that I did not do.</p>
<p>I am sending you screenshots of my correspondence with the casino for review.</p>
<p>I am also ready to provide additional documents, for example, a photo of a foreign passport, for additional verification.</p>
<p>Hopefully the casino lives up to its high rating.</p>
<p>I ask you very much for your help.</p>
