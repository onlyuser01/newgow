<p>The BetMGM Bracket Challenge has proven to be a formula for success. Its 2022 iteration generated substantial bettor interest, bolstering interest in professional basketball and allowing fans to engage with the sport on a new level. This year’s event features the same $10 million grand prize, among other promotions and awards. BetMGM will also use the opportunity to raise awareness of its responsible gaming campaign.</p>
<p>Savvy Bettors Can Win Big</p>
<p>The leading sports betting and iGaming operator continues to invest substantially in marketing for the USA, doing its best to stay one step ahead of the competition. BetMGM’s latest press release celebrated the return of its free-to-play Men’s Basketball Championship bracket challenge, which saw tremendous success in 2022.</p>
<p>The lucky fans who successfully predict a perfect bracket can win up to $10 million. If nobody makes the correct guess, the operator promises to distribute up to $100,000 in guaranteed prizes to the people who made the most successful picks. Participants are also in the running for odds boost tokens, bonus bets, and parlay tokens for select games.</p>
<p>BetMGM Has Special Offers for New Signups</p>
<p>Onboarding new players is a priority for any operator, so customers signing up with BetMGM will receive special offers. The operator’s First Bet Offer promises up to $1,000 paid back in bonus bets for new customers whose wager doesn’t win. BetMGM CEO Adam Greenblat was excited regarding the returning contest, promising fans engaging content during the coming season.</p>

<p>Fans can enter the bracket challenge online from their computers or via the BetMGM mobile sports betting app. To participate, they must complete and submit their bracket in the challenge section and hope for the best. BetMGM is now available in 21 states after Massachusetts officially launched online sports betting on 10 March.</p>
<p>Safe Gaming Remains a Priority</p>
<p>BetMGM’s latest promotion coincides with its gambling harm prevention campaign. The operator announced that starting 1 March, its marketing and advertising materials will feature responsible gaming messages. BetMGM hopes to reach the largest possible audience with messages at brick-and-mortar venues, on physical billboards, television, radio, and on BetMGM’s digital and social platforms.</p>
<p>The collaboration with GameSense should significantly bolster the operator’s digital platforms. Users can now utilize spending limit tools, easily access basic gambling information and contact highly trained GameSense Advisors if they require help with their gambling habits. BetMGM’s commitment to safe gambling and its relentless expansion efforts have helped the operator remain among the market leaders in the USA.</p>
