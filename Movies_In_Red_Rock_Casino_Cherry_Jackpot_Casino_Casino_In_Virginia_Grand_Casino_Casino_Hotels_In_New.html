<p>Kitty Glitter Review</p>
<p>Theme and Story Line</p>
<p>Kitty Glitter comes with no real story line and a straightforward theme.</p>
<p>As the title suggests the theme is cats: Siamese cats, Calicos and Tabbies with the top cat being the Persian. The ‘glitter’ is there largely in the Diamond symbols that work as wilds and scatters in the bonus rounds (more on which later).</p>
<p>The theme should appeal to anyone who agrees with the movie Homeward Bound – ‘cats rule, dogs drool’.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The adorable kitties in the symbol artwork are a little rough, and generally less enjoyable to look at than a cat should be. However they are easily read and well animated on the reels.</p>

<p>The sound design is also solid. Not great, but not making any major mistakes and with a nice spike when the Bonus symbol lands.</p>
<p>Overall it is more functional than beautiful.</p>
<p>Kitty Glitter Gameplay</p>
<p>The gameplay is pretty much what you’d expect. Five reels, 1 to 30 win lines and no additional frills. Hit spin and watch the cats go.</p>
<p>This simplicity does make for rather bland gameplay. Apart from the occasional bonus rounds, the gameplay does not vary much from spin to spin and there are no extra features like scatter, stacks or tumbling symbols.</p>
<p>Though for many players this would not be an issue, I would prefer a little more variation and if you feel the same way it might be worth looking at some of the other slots reviewed on our site.</p>

<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins in Kitty Glitter</p>
<p>The game comes with the standard additional symbols a Wild symbol (with ‘Kitty Glitter’ written on it) in and Bonus symbols (with an image of a cat food bowl full of diamonds). The Wild can play as any symbol with the important exception that is does not act as a Bonus symbol.</p>
<p>Bonus spins can be won by getting three Bonus symbols on the middle three reels. Each bonus round is fifteen free spins and the reels are more likely to hit during these spins due to increased wilds and bonuses.</p>

<p>Another fifteen spins can be retriggered during the bonus rounds by hitting three Bonus symbols on the middle reels again.</p>
<p>To make the bonus spins even more profitable, the Bonus symbol then becomes wild in the Bonus rounds, and each time one appears on reel 5 it is added to an accumulator that makes more symbols wild on certain reels.</p>
<p>For example three diamonds in the accumulator makes the White Persian Cat symbol wild on reels 2 to 5. This is where the big wins happen.</p>
<p>Kitty Glitter Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The game has a medium to high variance, which we normally like, but the RTP is rather low, at 94.92%. The site we tried had coin sizes ranging from £0.01 up to £5.00 allowing for you to bet from £0.01 up to £150 on each spin.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Kitty Glitter is an unexceptional, but basically well made slot machine. It suffers from a slightly low RTP.</p>
<p>The bonus system works nicely, but hits very rarely making for a high-variance experience.</p>
<p>Though not much to look at it is well animated and plays smoothly. Dog lovers need not apply!</p>
