    <h1>Latest Casino Bonuses Free Online Casino Real Money Niagara Seneca Casino Seven Clans Casino Warroad</h1>

<p>While some gambling industry stakeholders in the UK are bracing themselves for a serious overhaul once the Gambling Act 2005 review is complete and the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) releases its white paper, others seem to be unfazed by preliminary reports suggesting gambling sponsorships may be prohibited.</p>
<p>Official Betting Partner</p>
<p>Queens Park Rangers (QPR), a soccer club competing in the English second echelon, the EFL Championship, confirmed it entered into a deal with Tebwin.com, a sports betting brand part of Malta-based King J. Entertainment, to name the brand its “Official Betting Partner” for the 2021/22 season.</p>
<p>QPR has a tremendous legacy that extends back to the 19th century, we already feel part of the British footballing tradition because of it. Partnering with a team like QPR is a unique opportunity for a new company like ours, and the start of what we hope will be a long and mutually rewarding relationship.” Pearl Dougall, Business Manager, King J. Entertainment</p>
<p>Operating under licenses from the UK Gambling Commission and Malta Gaming Authority (MGA), King J. Entertainment’s brands Tebwin and King J. offer sports betting and online casino gaming, respectively, emphasizing the importance of player protection as a key ingredient for its future business outlook.</p>
<p>Both brands actively promote the UK charity commissioning prevention and treatment services BeGambleAware and gambling self-exclusion scheme GAMSTOP and that was more than enough for QPR, which is about to announce a partnership with GAMSTOP soon, to elect for the agreement.</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to have secured this partnership with Tebwin, who have impressed us with their customer vetting and onboarding process, which is second-to-none,” said QPR’s Commercial Director Euan Inglis.”QPR are committed to promoting safer gambling enjoyment as evidenced by our discussions with GAMSTOP, so we are delighted that Tebwin take their responsibility towards safer gambling seriously and are fully integrated with the GAMSTOP scheme,” he added.</p>
<p>The partnership with Tebwin will support QPR’s efforts to engage with its fans in “responsible and innovative ways,” while continuing to offer them an enhanced fan experience, Inglis concluded.</p>
<p>Stadium Brand Display</p>
<p>The partnership deal will provide exposure for the sports betting brand, as the Tebwin logo will be displayed around the home of QPR, Kiyan Prince Foundation Stadium, as well as in other promotional material in which Tebwin will stress responsible gambling.</p>
<p>Further, Tebwin will gain exclusive rights to QPR official logos and marks to use for marketing and other promotional activities within the sports betting category. Tebwin will also gain access to QPR’s blockchain app as part of the deal.</p>
<p>The new partnership comes as a surprise on the background of recent reports that the government is seriously considering forcing sports clubs to cut their ties with gambling operators. At least one other Championship club, Bolton Wanderers, would disapprove the deal, as the club announced last month that it would be severing ties with the gambling industry.</p>
