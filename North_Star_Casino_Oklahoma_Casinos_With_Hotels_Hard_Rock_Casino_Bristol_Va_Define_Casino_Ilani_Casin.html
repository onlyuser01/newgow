<p>R.I.P. City review</p>
<p>Theme and Style</p>
<p>R.I.P. City transports players to the wrong side of the tracks.</p>
<p>Players will discover a cartoon cat and mouse in the midst of a rather violent feud. Some players may recall other famous cat and mouse duos such as Tom and Jerry, but in this world the spats are considerably darker.</p>
<p>Players looking for a gritty, comedic atmosphere may particularly appreciate this slot.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The central characters of this slot are a cat named Ro$$ and a mouse named Maxx. They stand on either side of the reels, both looking worse for wear with injuries. Ro$$ in particular looks as if he’s had a rough time with his bleeding black eye. Maxx has some rips in his ears, but otherwise appears fierce and ready to keep fighting.</p>
<p>In the background, players will see the illustration of a shadowy city alley in shades of charcoal grey, allowing the neon symbols to stand out. This may remind some players of the graphic novel Sin City in which black and white illustrations are punctuated with vivid colors.</p>
<p>Among the symbols, players will find skulls, bananas, and dice, giving an eclectic feel to the reels. Smiley faces with crossed out eyes add to the grisly atmosphere.</p>
<p>The soundtrack is a piano melody that has a slightly spooky vibe. Players will feel as if they are joining a stealthy chase scene, and they’ll need to decide if they are on the side of the cat, or the mouse.</p>
<p>Overall, the animation and soundtrack of this slot give a dark twist to classic cartoon aesthetics.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>R.I.P. City is a five-reel, five-row slot with 19 win lines.</p>
<p>The maximum payout for this slot is 12,500x the player’s total bet.</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all regular symbols.</p>
<p>The Wild Cat symbol substitutes for all regular symbols and expands downward whenever doing so would complete a winning combination.</p>
<p>In the event that the Wild Cat symbol expands through a Wild symbol, that Wild transforms into a multiplier that is applied to the whole expanded Wild Cat symbol. These multipliers range from 2x to 200x. If two multipliers are created, their values are added together and then applied to the win.</p>
<p>When players land 3 Free Spin Scatter symbols, the Ro$$ Bonus begins, starting with 10 free spins. If players land 3 Free Spin Scatter symbols during the Ro$$ Bonus, 4 additional free spins are awarded.</p>
<p>Landing 4 Free Spin Scatters during the Ro$$ Bonus awards the Maxx Bonus at the conclusion of the Ro$$ Bonus. If the number of remaining free spins is under 10, the count is reset to 10.</p>
<p>The Maxx Bonus begins with 10 free spins. During the Maxx Bonus every reel may be activated when a Wild Cat symbol lands there. After a reel is activated a Wild Cat symbol is guaranteed to appear on that reel on any remaining free spins.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.22%, our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.10 up to a maximum of $/£/€100 per spin.</p>
<p>R.I.P. City offers medium volatility, making it a less ideal match for our preferred slot machine strategies. We suggest pursuing the highest possible volatility when selecting slots.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We recommend this high RTP, medium volatility classic cartoon-themed slot.</p>
<p>The decent RTP and amusing animation make this slot a solid choice. However, players with a mathematical mindset may be less moved by the moderate volatility.</p>
<p>The engaging bonuses add extra appeal to this somewhat macabre slot.</p>
