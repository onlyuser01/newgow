    <h1>Yellow Brick Road Casino Silver Legacy Casino Victory Casino Cruise Reviews Slot Casino Online Niaga</h1>

<p>It's been a great year or two with Casinoextreme, and the whole staff. Well, until recently anyway.</p>
<p>I'm sure there are many clients who are much richer, and have deposited so much more than me. Lord knows what flows into a casino located in Cyprus, headquartered in... Bulgaria? I won't speculate on the sources.. doesn't matter..</p>
<p>I put a lot of very hard earned money into CasinoExtreme.eu. about a third of my life savings, probably 30,000. I am just a retired military veteran, so I don't have a lot.</p>
<p>The treatment and disrespect I have received lately is beyond insulting, and hard to believe.</p>
<p>I admittedly made a few minor inadvertent mistakes related to bonus rules, and this caused me to lose two of the only withdrawals I would have made in the couple of years I have been a customer. Even after reaching Platinum Membership, and being among some of the top players over several different months, I was never given a chance to discuss what occurred, nor given any leeway.</p>
<p>I put a lot of money into your company, Casino Extreme.eu. All the deposits, losses, and then denial of withdrawals for the smallest of any technicality will affect me and my family's life for quite a while to come.</p>
<p>I thought it was a miracle after hours and hours of play I had managed to win $5300.. I had visions of a great Christmas, and some hope for relief from all my bills and expenses. The game I was playing had a label $5, but I later realized, I was hitting the 3 coin button, so it added up to $15. So, my $5300 winning from all of my hours of play, on many, many different games {none of which was above $10) was discounted. My years of playing at the casino, Platinum Member BS whatever, and lost $30,000... all counted for nothing. See picture of the slot machine below. Wasn't familiar with the 1920's style, or circa 1980 software for it...</p>
<p>I put A LOT of money and time into CasinoExtreme.eu. I hope it is all not wasted, and things change. Not sure where all that money went.. Probably some russian mafia organization? IDK.. Hopefully to hardworking people like me.... and to something worthwhile.</p>
<p>This is actually the second withdrawal I was denied.. First was because: although I had completed my wagering requirement, could have withdrawn everything, I decided to play a progressive slot I had never played before a couple times.. so all winnings were revoked.</p>
<p>In both cases, there was nothing approaching any form of human empathy or emotion. Nor any consideration for me, my large losses, loyalty (GOT THAT PLATINUM MEMBERSHIP!), or that fact that people make mistakes...</p>
<p>After 10 years of online gambline I have played at almost every online casino. Casinoextreme.eu was one I chose to stick with because I thought I could trust it, the people there, and the management to do the right thing. I WAS WRONG. I wish I had never deposited a dime. Even after having my $5000 winnings from yesterday basically stolen from me... I asked today for a bonus chip, or reward, after explaining the situation. I was told I could get nothing more that a $50 bonus chip....</p>
<p>Hope this story reaches someone at CasinoExtreme that cares. I hope, somehow, someway... someone else will be prevented from suffering like I have. We are all human.... and corporations are a conglomeration of humans, and we all make mistakes.. Lord knows over the years I have seen quite a few on Casinoextreme's website, and software.. with no repercussions..</p>
<p>I hope it changes... I hope someone cares.. and reads this, and realizes my children won't be receiving the Christmas presents I dreamed of giving them as I went to make that $5000 withdrawal.. then was denied it all, everything.. because of a minor, inadvertent mistake.. I bet $15, instead of $10 on a game, because I had never played it before and didn't fully understand it.</p>
<p>Nothing will change... NOBODY CARES! I KNOW THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT ME...DO THEY CARE ABOUT ANY OF THEIR CUSTOMERS? DO THEY CARE ABOUT YOU? DO THEY CARE ABOUT ANY EMPLOYEES? Where the hell is the humanity, reasoning, understanding, slightest bit of empathy?</p>
<p>I wish everyone the best. Thank you sincerely if you took the time to read this.</p>
<p>Please close my account permanently, delete my email address from your marketing, and never contact me again.</p>
