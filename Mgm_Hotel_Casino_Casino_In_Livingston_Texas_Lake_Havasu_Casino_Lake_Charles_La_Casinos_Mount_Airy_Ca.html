    <h1>Mgm Hotel Casino Casino In Livingston Texas Lake Havasu Casino Lake Charles La Casinos Mount Airy Ca</h1>

<p>I had a big win at a £4 stake on the monopoly website, I would think it would have been at least £10,000 at these stakes. I had a page full of wilds and the game crashed, I could not log in to that game for 4 or 5 days and I told the operator immediately after the win failed and crash, I believe they manipulated the out come so that they did not have to pay me back, they blocked my account told me the win was £48 and refunded the money back to my card. This is not fair game and as far as I'm concerned this illegal and constitutes a element of fraud. This is the email that they sent to me afterwards.</p>
<p>We're sorry to hear you feel we have closed your account in an effort to hide what you believe is fraud. Please rest assured, this is far from the case. In your Live Chat conversation with Ashley you advised that you felt we had maliciously manipulated your game to ensure you would not gain a large amount of wins, and if the matter remained unresolved, you would contact your bank and ask for the funds you had legitimately placed on site to be returned to you. It is a part of our internal policies and processes to close an account to prevent any further activity if there is a dispute regarding deposits and/or if a member threatens to chargeback any transactions.</p>
<p>We can absolutely appreciate your disappointment regarding this matter, and we can only apologise for any upset caused. Regrettably, we can only refer to the data recorded by the secure servers on which all games are played. This matter was escalated on to the game provider, who reviewed their logs and confirmed £48 was the outcome and as such, this was credited to your account. Please note, the information regarding this matter was available in our site Terms and Conditions, which you had full access to prior to registering your account on site, and which you confirmed you had read, understood and agreed to when completing the registration process. For your own peace of mind, we have included the relevant Terms and Conditions below:</p>
<ol>
<li>PAYMENT OF WINNINGS</li>
</ol>
<p>13.3 Our Decision is Final: You agree that we and our records (and/or the records of any of our third party Game and/or service providers) shall be the final authority in determining the terms of any Games you play, any Wagers you place and the circumstances in which such Wagers were placed, subject to your rights under section 19.1 of these Terms and Conditions.</p>
<p>Please note, we can appreciate this is not the response you had hoped to receive, and we can only apologise for your experience.</p>
<p>In the meantime, may we just take this opportunity to wish you all the best for the future.</p>
<p>They surely cannot do this. I have already contacted the gaming board regarding this matter.</p>
