    <h1>Inn Of The Mountain Gods Resort Casino Mescalero Chumba Casino Class Action Lawsuit Casino Jizzle Fo</h1>

<p>Online sports and esports betting leader Rivalry has diversified its product offering, adding a custom-branded slots category to its Casino.exe platform. The move seeks to capitalize on the popularity of slot games and allow the operator to engage more players.</p>
<p>According to the announcement, Rivalry’s plan is to add more than two dozen best-in-class slot games, enhancing its online casino lineup. Thanks to this, Rivalry will be able to further tap into the lucrative online casino market.</p>
<p>Rivalry Slots now boasts its own page within the Casino.exe platform. It is now available to customers in many markets where Rivalry operates and is set to launch in Ontario in a few weeks.</p>
<p>In line with the company’s effort to engage Millennial and Gen Z consumers, the slots page sports an early 2000s aesthetic, evoking a sense of nostalgia among gamers. The page also incorporates a number of fun interactive “Easter egg” elements that are designed to further excite younger audiences.</p>
<p>The launch of Rivalry Slots is expected to bolster Rivalry’s handle. For reference, the Canadian company generated CAD 57.5 million during the second quarter of the year.</p>
<p>The New Addition Aligns with Rivalry’s Values</p>
<p>Rivalry’s co-founder and chief executive officer, Steven Salz, commented on the new addition. He pointed out that his company’s foray into the world of online casino has generated a meaningful stream of new players and revenue.</p>
<p>Salz pointed out that slot games have proven time and time again to resonate with fans, which is why his team wanted to explore the opportunities this vertical represents. The CEO added:</p>
<p>We’ve also maintained our high product standard by uniquely incorporating slots into our proprietary Casino.exe platform, which will allow us to continue scaling our iGaming catalog without compromising the premium experiences that users come to Rivalry for. Steven Salz, CEO &amp; co-founder, Rivalry</p>
<p>Rivalry’s director of product design, David King, also commented on the matter, saying that Rivalry’s main product philosophy is to engage fans with “fundamentally entertaining experiences.” The new launch, according to him, aligns with those values.</p>
<p>Rivalry Slots delivers that entertainment factor by wrapping an ordinary product in design nostalgia to not only be relevant to a young Millennial or Gen Z customer, but also strategically differentiate our offering from the countless other online casinos players have to choose from. David King, director of product design, Rivalry</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, Rivalry also launched a new innovative game called Cash &amp; Dash.</p>
