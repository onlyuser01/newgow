    <h1>Free Casino Slot Machine Games Boomtown Casino Bossier City Casinos In Carson City Nevada Venetian C</h1>

<p>Many people say that the casino always wins and ordinary players cannot make money from it. But that is not true. There are always people who managed to find a strategy and make money on it. Of course, the casino wins in the end, but only because millions of people around the world drop billions there daily. This tutorial is for players who want to earn money with Aviator.</p>
<p>How does the Aviator game work?</p>
<p>To develop a strategy, you need to understand what the Aviator game is about. It all starts with a circle. A round is each new flight of the plane, before which all players bet on the duration of the flight. All casino "rounds" are identical and last an average of 30 seconds, and all games are determined by a server hosted by the provider Spribe. Before each new spin, players have 10 seconds to place a bet.</p>
<p>Watch your bets because they are your winnings. The casino does not limit the bet size, but you cannot bet more than twice during the game. Professional players advise you to make small deposits simultaneously, at several gaming bureaus and try to organize additional events to increase your winnings (this strategy is suitable for experienced players).</p>
<p>The bet can be canceled at any time from the start of the flight or the departure limit can be set immediately. You win if you collect the money before the machine crashes or leaves the screen. You cannot change the bet during the game, so you have to come up with a strategy in advance.</p>
<p>The multiplier is the duration of the car parts flight. The more he flies, the more players earn.</p>
<p>The circular story helps you build your strategy. At the top of the screen is the history of the last 28 flights. After analyzing them, you will understand what the game will be like. If there are several big wins in a row, the next one will likely be smaller.</p>
<p>The betting window shows what other players are betting on. You can see what odds and amounts they bet on. If you remember the best players, you can use their strategies.</p>
<p>Aviator game odds</p>
<p>Why read a chart? If players know how to read the graph, they can understand which odds are good and which ones they can bet on and which ones are bad.</p>
<p>The bad odds are from 1.00 to 1.40. With them, you will not earn anything or not enough, and in the long run you will simply lose. The average coefficient is 1.45-1.95. You can already earn money on them, and these amounts are quite common. Good odds are 2.00-3.65. If you want regular income, consider the probabilities of that particular amount. They are very common and very effective. Optimal odds - 3.70 - 4.95. This is a pretty risky area, but you can still try your luck with them. Make sure you don't choose red if you make a mistake. The worst odds are between 5.05 and 1,000,000. Sometimes you want to get lucky and win all the money in the world, but unfortunately it's very rare for someone to succeed.</p>
<p>Strategy in the Aviator game: how to read the chart?</p>
<p>The aviator game does not like patient people. Everything on this platform is built so that you can bet fast and lose money. Let's see the image below:</p>
<p>A very typical situation is presented: two levels of difficulty and a fake gift.</p>
<p>The main rule is that pink, the worst probability, appears randomly. Therefore, they do not need to be considered when reading the chart.</p>
<p>The 1.63x and 1.16x odds are blue, which means there is a 90% chance that the next two odds are also the same color (2.12x and 4.21x). These double repetitions occur at most once or twice in a row. In this case, the repetition occurs only once. And then the pattern breaks and there is a repeat again (2.60x and 4.35x). This situation can be called chess because bad and good odds alternate.</p>
<p>So how do you win? You must see this pattern and follow it. However, many miss out because they start following it too late and don't finish in time.</p>
<p>Remember that a double repetition (bad-good-bad) occurs no more than 1-3 times in a row. And chess (bad-good-bad-good) can be played 5-6 times.</p>
<p>Sometimes it takes longer. But if you want to earn and earn money, you have to be patient and careful. When in doubt, it's best to skip a few laps and look at the big picture.</p>
<p>When should you exit the game?</p>
<p>However, we play at the casino and he wants to win. Therefore, there is always a moment when absolutely everyone loses. How do you see? There have already been 6-8 failures in a row, the rate of which is less than 2x. At that point, you think that next time you will definitely be lucky and bet more and more. If you observe 4 or more losses in a row, we recommend that you exit the game immediately. Rest and don't play for about 40 minutes, this saves money.</p>
<p>winning streak</p>
<p>If there is a losing streak, there will be a winning streak. It happens very rarely, but if it happens, don't miss a round and more bets.</p>
<p>Generally all odds on this series are over 5x and you can win good money.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Remember that Aviator is a game for patient and determined people. Stay calm, assess the situation, and try to find a pattern. You can analyze other players' strategies, but don't trust them 100%, everyone can make mistakes.</p>
