<p>Lawmakers on the panel are diligently exploring various aspects of this expansion, with the expectation to present their findings on December 15, following another scheduled meeting on November 13</p>
<p>The potential expansion of mobile sports gaming beyond the confines of the state’s casinos took center stage during the second meeting of the Mobile Online Betting Task Force on October 24.</p>
<p>Mississippi Gaming Commission Director Advocates Critical Legislation for Mobile Sports Betting</p>
<p>Jay McDaniel, the executive director of the Mississippi Gaming Commission, addressed the lawmakers, highlighting critical factors requiring consideration for drafting potential legislation, reported media outlet The Center Square. These include determining an appropriate tax rate, outlining the distribution of proceeds, and contemplating the possibility of a referendum process that would allow counties to opt out of mobile gaming, mirroring existing protocols for counties and alcohol sales.</p>
<p>McDaniel emphasized the necessity of increased penalties to deter illegal operators from establishing unauthorized betting platforms. He also introduced the concept of geofencing, a technology that could establish geographic boundaries, ensuring compliance with regulatory guidelines.</p>
<p>In September 2023, Mississippi’s sports betting handle surpassed $50 billion, with football being the most popular sport among bettors. Coastal Mississippi accounted for $33,494,794 of the total handle, while taxable revenue declined to $8,144,027 billion, compared to the previous year’s figures. Basketball and baseball also attracted significant wagers, and parlay cards remained a popular choice among players in different regions of the state.</p>
<p>PENN Entertainment Envisions Boosting Mississippi’s Economy Through Online Gaming Expansion</p>
<p>Jason Tosches, Director of Public Affairs and Government Relations at PENN Entertainment, a prominent gaming operator with a national presence, expressed optimism about the expansion of online gaming. He highlighted the potential economic benefits, citing opportunities to boost the state’s gaming industry, enhance tax revenue, and implement responsible gaming measures to create a secure wagering environment. PENN Entertainment, which operates numerous casinos across the state, is currently collaborating with sports network ESPN to rebrand its US online sportsbooks as ESPN Bet.</p>
<p>Tosches pointed out that online gaming is currently legal in 29 states, putting Mississippi at a competitive disadvantage. Unlike other states, Mississippi’s casinos currently only permit on-site sports betting, a limitation that curtails the state’s potential revenue stream.</p>
<p>Speaking on behalf of the National Council of Legislators From Gaming States, West Virginia Delegate Shawn Fluharty emphasized the importance of adopting mobile gaming. He cited statistics indicating a significant shift from traditional sportsbooks to online platforms in recent years.Fluharty referenced Louisiana’s experience, where a staggering 85% of sports wagers migrated to mobile devices, slightly below the national average of 93%. He stressed the urgency of regulating the market, highlighting the risks associated with unregulated platforms, such as mobile manipulation, which can adversely affect consumers.</p>
