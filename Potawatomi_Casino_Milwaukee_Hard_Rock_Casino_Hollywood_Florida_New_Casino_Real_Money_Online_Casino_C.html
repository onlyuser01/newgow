    <h1>Potawatomi Casino Milwaukee Hard Rock Casino Hollywood Florida New Casino Real Money Online Casino C</h1>

<p>The popular Swedish iGaming developer continues to strengthen its network of partners, realizing a yet another content opportunity with a prominent operator</p>
<p>As a result, Gaming Corps will bring its games in strength with Vera &amp; John and offer the operator an opportunity to increase its content library with innovative and player-focused games designed to bring better entertainment to players across the board.</p>
<p>Gaming Corps Delivers Innovative Content for Vera &amp; John</p>
<p>Gaming Corps has been developing a variety of titles and focusing specifically on the Plinko game genre. Plinko is among the first games to hit Vera &amp; John’s casino platform with a dedicated Mine game also coming. Commenting on this opportunity, Vera &amp; John said:</p>
<p>We’re thrilled to expand our exciting arcade vertical with Gaming Corps, as specialists in the space. The launch of Plinko offers more control and variety to our players and their preferences in the game. Vera &amp; John</p>
<p>Gaming Corps CCO Danielle Calafato was similarly pleased with the opportunity to see the company’s content launch with yet another operator.</p>
<p>“Vera &amp; John not only leads but has essentially created the entirety of its active market with others joining to build online operations in the region,” Calafato said. The executive further commended the operator for focusing on providing player bases with local content that truly strikes home with them.</p>
<p>Calafato further thanked for the opportunity to see Gaming Corps products launched with Vera &amp; John. Gaming Corps is also a refreshing supplier that is adding games that defy iGaming expectations and provide content that is innovative and breaks the industry’s mold.</p>
<p>Gaming Corps provides a strong variety of titles, including crash, mine, slots, and table, as well as the aforementioned Plinko. The supplier has been growing its footprint at a good pace, teaming up with Napoleon Casino in Belgium.</p>
<p>The company similarly sought to expand its footprint in Africa, a vibrant market that is embracing iGaming, with Gaming Corps now setting a firm foot in it.</p>
