<p>Caesars Entertainment has appointed Sandra Douglass Morgan to the company’s Board of Directors effective November 7, 2021. Morgan’s appointment, while still subject to regulatory approvals, is an important addition to the company’s ranks of executives as she previously served as a chairwoman to the Nevada Gaming Control Board (NGCB), making her intimately familiar with the regulated gaming and betting industries in the United States.</p>
<p>Morgan’s career path spans multiple high-profile roles. She worked for AT&amp;T and was in charge of handling government and community affairs in Nevada. She was also the City Attorney for the City of North Las Vegas and she got involved with the gaming industry as a litigation attorney.</p>
<p>Forging the Gaming Industry through Leadership</p>
<p>Caesars minced no words in welcoming Morgan, arguing that she is rooted in the industry in a way that “few others could be.” Company executive chairman of the Board Gary Carano praised Morgan for her wealth of experience and understanding of the processes in the iGaming and interactive wagering landscape:</p>
<p>“Sandra is rooted in the gaming industry in a way few others could be. Her experience as chair of the Nevada Gaming Control Board and as a member of the Nevada Gaming Commission gives her a deep understanding of our industry.” Caesars executive chairman of the Board Gary Carano</p>
<p>Carano cited Morgan’s experience working with government entities and gaming corporations to advance the industry in the country and argued that her expertise would help Caesars to continually evolve as gaming moves forward.</p>
<p>Ushering in the Changes that Gaming Needed</p>
<p>In her position as chairwoman, Morgan introduced numerous changes that served to the overall betterment of the industry. She was instrumental in adding important changes to the licensing conditions through which she helped tackle discrimination and gave a boost to the introduction of cashless wagering, a measure that was welcome and adopted at the nadir of the pandemic. Cashless payments have been championed by a number of companies, including IGT and Sightline, Boyd and Aristocrat, and others.</p>
<p>Caesars CEO Tom Reeg welcomed Morgan and argued that her motivation to always do the right thing would fit with Caesars’ own company culture and mentality. Reeg expressed confidence that with Morgan’s help, the company would continue to drive results and generate value for stakeholders and the industry. Caesars’ board now features 10 dedicated members who help guide the company through advice and oversight.</p>
