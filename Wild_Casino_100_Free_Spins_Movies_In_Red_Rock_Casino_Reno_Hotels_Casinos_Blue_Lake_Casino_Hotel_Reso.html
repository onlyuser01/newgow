    <h1>Wild Casino 100 Free Spins Movies In Red Rock Casino Reno Hotels Casinos Blue Lake Casino Hotel Reso</h1>

<p>Deposited £50 here. Played with absolutely no bonus. They still have silly small print which states you cannot bet more than 50 euro or equivalent on any single casino bets, and no more than 100 euro on any single live casino bets.</p>
<p>Basically I got from £50 to £7000 on live lightning roulette… I stuck within the rules mentioned throughout this time but except for ONE single spin where I had bet 120 euro by MISTAKE. I tried to undo this bet before the timer ran out for the next roulette spin but I was not quick enough - but on this £120 spin I had won NOTHING off of that single bet so really no harm was done in my opinion. I’m more than sure I was already on around £3000 before placing the "breached" bet spin. Anyway I spoke to the live chat agent and told him I was worried about this - he said "Thomas don’t worry, we are not trying to take your money, if any winnings were accumulated off of the breached single bet we will just void that and you keep the rest of the other money" so I won nothing off that single bet. I unfortunately did not screen shot that specific chat but I did screen shot a similar chat earlier. The issue is this morning they emailed to inform me of my very very TINY breach and have removed my winnings £6650 removed!!! and they claim I was at just a mere £350 before I breached the rules so left me with £350 instead of £7000 when in fact I was on over £3000 when I accidentally bet £120 instead of £100. So I’ve been robbed of £6650 and LIED TO by there moody live chat agents. I replied to there email asking for evidence of my breach and times etc and I’ve yet to have a response. There casino transaction history for me to see online is very limited how convenient for them!! I feel they will not respond at all because they are rubbish but I want real JUSTICE because I was made to feel like everything was going to be fine when it certainly was not! Nobody realise how badly this has affected me mentally, I was planning holidays with my partner and to buy nice things for once in my life and pay some debts off. For them to just take that all away from me is absolutely DISGUSTING and leaves me with no faith in humanity at all! All this grief for an accidental £20 spin that turned out to be a losing bet anyway! I will not stop until I get justice I am determined about this big time! I’m absolutely certain they will ignore me and ignore anyone else investigating this! I don’t want deposits back, I want my £6650 that was won off of bets that did not breach any rules! Thanks guys.</p>
