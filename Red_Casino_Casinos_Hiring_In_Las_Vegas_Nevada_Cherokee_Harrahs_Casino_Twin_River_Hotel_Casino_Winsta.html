    <h1>Red Casino Casinos Hiring In Las Vegas Nevada Cherokee Harrahs Casino Twin River Hotel Casino Winsta</h1>

<p>My experience with this casino started off pretty good.</p>
<p>I mainly used their sportsbook which provided a wide offer as far as in-play matches are concerned.</p>
<p>Of course I verified my account before depositing funds and using the site by sending my ID (back/front side) and a legal government document to validate my house address and after they both got accepted and verified I actually started using their services.</p>
<p>It all went smooth until I began asking for my first withdraw.</p>
<p>I deposited around 600e and made it to nearly 3k euros in my balance.</p>
<p>My first withdraw request was for about 2keuros which they took 12+ without ever confirming the request.</p>
<p>I kept asking their chat about the reason behind not paying my winnings and after MANY attempts they told me that the maxwithdraw is 1000e per day.Had I not spamed them with questions regarding my withdraw , I would keep waiting on this 2k euros payout which would never arrive.</p>
<p>Afterwards I canceled that withdraw and requested smaller ones.One 700e withdraw and another 700e withdraw 4days after.Still no confirmation about either of these withdraw requests and I doubt I will ever get my money.</p>
<p>In email , they keep assuring me that all winnings will get paid eventually , but the pending withdraw requests are too many so it may take a while until I actually get my money.They also keep asking for my patience each time the time-frames that they had originally set for the payouts falls short."Please wait until Monday , because on that day the most withdraw requests are getting approved." and "Please give it another 3-4 days and you will get the withdraw confirmation." and other such bullshit.</p>
<p>Do not fall into the same trap that I fell in.</p>
<p>They don't seem to be willing to pay winnings.</p>
<p>I will keep you updated regarding my "lovely" experience with them , to save fellow bettors from getting scammed the way I did.</p>
<p>Regards</p>
