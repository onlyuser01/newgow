    <h1>Lucky Duck Casino Casino Reinvestment Development Authority Croc S Resort And Casino Quilceda Casino</h1>

<p>Konami Gaming and Sky River Casino have introduced a cashless gaming option that is available at the newly constructed location in Sacramento, California. Cashless is becoming an increasingly important part of the experience, and although it’s not on track to replace cash completely, it’s a solution that has been a preferred option for many properties to have.</p>
<p>Sky River Casino’s New Property Gets Cashless by Konami</p>
<p>Most recently, IGT also introduced its cashless solutions to Station Casinos in Las Vegas. Now, Sky River Casino is following in the same footsteps. Company COO and president Chris Gibase welcomed the opportunity to enhance the type of experience that players get and create more fond memories for visitors. Gibase suggested that cashless was already a consumer preference:</p>
<p>By investing in cutting-edge cashless technology that brings convenience and innovation to payments, loyalty and rewards, Sky River allows guests to focus on the entertainment, using whichever touchpoints they prefer. Company COO and president Chris Gibase</p>
<p>The end goal is not to uproot physical payments, however. Rather, Sky River wants to create a comprehensive omnichannel experience that enables consumers to pick and alternate between methods that they have handy, or they feel like using. This includes a mix of traditional and contactless payments, digital and mobile.</p>
<p>Konami Gaming EVP and COO Tom Jingoli were similarly pleased to have the opportunity to make this partnership a reality. Jingoli explained that he was impressed with the historic opening of the new property and was thrilled to have the opportunity to deploy the industry-leading cashless solution on-site. He added:</p>
<p>Wherever the transaction, with whatever payment method, guests have the opportunity to enjoy robust, real-time loyalty rewards and the use of integrated, digital account funds across all casino touchpoints. Konami Gaming EVP and COO Tom Jingoli</p>
<p>Creating Fulfilling Wholesome Gaming and Hospitality Experience</p>
<p>The property features 2,000 slot machines, 80 table games, and not least, 12 different dining experiences. Everi Fintech Business Leader and EVP Darren Simmons welcomed the opportunity for the property. Sky River Casino’s opening of its 100,000 sq ft destination makes the casino a prime candidate for imbuing it with technology that is designed to make the customer journey simpler and more fulfilling.</p>
<p>Visitors and guests can experience a complete mobile ecosystem thanks to the CashClub Wallet digital funding at slots and table games, Simmons assured. Cashless is going to be a lot in the news, whether as a go-to option or a complementary feature to make consumer experiences better.</p>
