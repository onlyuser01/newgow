<p>DAZN and the DP World Tour will bolster the coverage they are offering to fans in Germany, Austria and Switzerland</p>
<p>The DP World Tour has unveiled a new broadcast deal with DAZN, providing the sports media giant with distribution rights for the DACH (Germany, Austria and Switzerland) region. As a result, sports fans can expect to see all games from the DP World Tour in the region on DAZN.</p>
<p>Not only will the media giant broadcast DACH tournaments, but it will also have co-exclusive live subscription OTT rights, together with Sky Germany.</p>
<p>Furthermore, DAZN also succeeded in securing the rights to broadcast delaying highlights of the 2023 Ryder Cup – an event scheduled to run from September 29 to October 1 at Marco Simone Golf and Country Club in Rome. In addition to all that, DAZN will also showcase features on golf’s greatest team contest prior to the event.</p>
<p>The very first tournament that DAZN will broadcast as a result of this partnership will be this week’s Porsche European Open in Hamburg. Sports aficionados can hop on DAZN to watch the action as it unfolds.</p>
<p>The Deal Will Strengthen DACH Golf</p>
<p>Richard Bunn, the managing director of European Tour Productions, shares his thoughts on the new agreement, praising DAZN for its commitment to covering golf and responding to the growing demand for golf content. Bunn said that his team is very happy that DAZN has decided to dedicate its focus to the DP World Tour.</p>
<p>DAZN are growing their golf coverage – tapping into growing consumer demand as golf’s popularity continues to rise – and we are delighted that they have focused on the DP World Tour for their first venture into men’s professional golf. Richard Bunn, MD, European Tour Productions</p>
<p>Bunn concluded that DAZN and the DP World Tour will be able to collectively bolster the coverage they are offering to fans in Germany, Austria and Switzerland.</p>
<p>Recent DAZN-Related Developments</p>
<p>In March, DAZN improved its accessibility by launching DAZN 1 HD, a non-stop programming in the UK and Ireland. The programming, as DAZN promised, already featured many exciting sports events, including the return of the boxing star Anthony Joshua to competing professionally.</p>
<p>The launch of DAZN 1 HD reflected DAZN’s desire to make professional sporting events accessible to as many fans as possible. It was, furthermore, in line with the company’s overall strategy for expansion in the UK market.</p>
<p>Despite the positive developments, DAZN also faced some difficulties. At the beginning of the year, the company had to postpone its IPO plans, after it reported losing billions. Much of this money was lost as a result of the broadcasting rights DAZN secured – a move that the company hopes will pay off in the future.</p>
