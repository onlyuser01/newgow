    <h1>Route 66 Hotel And Casino Casino In Eagle Pass Casino Host The Gardens Casino Cherokee Casino Spin F</h1>

<p>I deposited €100 and played with bonus. When the bonus was fully wagered, I was able to withdraw €1500.</p>
<p>The payment has not yet been made.</p>
<p>I should upload the usual data for verification and use it to verify ID, address and payment. I did that too.</p>
<p>My account was then closed and additional data was requested for verification. First, I should disclose my payment history from Mifinity for the last 3 months. Then I should disclose my bank statement for the last 3 months and also my payslips for the last 3 months.</p>
<p>But that doesn't seem to be enough either. Now my Skype ID is needed (although I don't use Skype) and is supposed to let me call Skype next week. The conversation should then take place in English, although unfortunately my English is not very good.</p>
<p>It seems I'm being scammed here. The casino is trying to unnecessarily lengthen the verification process, has already blocked my account and apparently does not want to pay out my winnings, although I have uploaded much more than a casino usually asks:</p>
<p>-ID (front and back)</p>
<p>-Selfie with ID</p>
<p>-Proof of address</p>
<p>-Proof of payment</p>
<ul>
<li>Salary slip of last 4 month</li>
</ul>
<p>-statement of bank account (last 3 month)</p>
