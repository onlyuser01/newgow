<p>Yggdrasil and ReelPlay have united to release ReelPlay’s partner studio Hot Rise Games’ freshest slot. The new game is called Monsters VS Gigablox and it is likely to become yet another knockout game from the studio that developed its own Hot 1 game mechanic. Players are invited to tap into their primal fear of monster-like creatures ruling over a deserted city in flames while collecting big wins. The game features the successful Gigablox Game Engagement Mechanic (GEM), which triggers an oversized symbol ready to land on new spins. The symbols can range from 2×2 to 6×6 in size.</p>

<p>Join the Ultimate Monster Battle</p>
<p>The game is based on the Ancient prophecies that have foretold of the massive battles between the giant monsters that will ultimately decide our destiny. It has been designed to showcase an incredible bird’s eye view over a city in flames that surrounds the grid with 50 pay lines. The main game symbols are extremely colorful and are found in a large variety of sizes, with low-paying symbols in the form of cards from 9 to A ranks, followed by a total of six premium monster symbols, and the mighty King Kong character. Monsters VS Gigablox also features</p>
<p>wild symbols represented by golden crowns. The golden crowns are used by players to finish a winning line by replacing all paying symbols. The scatter symbol in the game is represented by the “VS” symbol. When a minimum of five scatter symbols pop on the grid, they trigger the free spins round. Once the free spins bonus round is triggered, one of the monsters turns into a Rampaging Monster.</p>
<p>Players Get up to 40 Free Spins</p>
<p>The game rewards a maximum of 40 free spins with impressive wins. The monster symbol that is shown most often during the triggering spin is turned into the chosen champion. Provide no monster symbol pops, the game automatically selects Kongo King as the champion. All the Gigablox symbols during the bonus round are exclusive Monsters symbols. All wins that contain a wild symbol or the game’s champion symbol pay twice as much.</p>
<p>In certain countries, players are allowed to buy the bonus round in exchange for 75x the stake. Yggdrassil’s head of product &amp; programs Stuart McCarthy described the game as one that brings “an exciting, apocalyptic environment” to the grid. He added the incorporation of the GEM mechanics is another excellent addition to the YG Masters portfolio. ReelPlay’s chief executive officer David Johnson spoke about the company’s partnerships with a large number of independent gaming studios that enable them to prove their versatility in terms of game development.</p>
<p>Johnson added ReelPlay was proud of its partnership with Hot Rise Games. At the end of May, Yggdrasil and Bang Bang Games launched a Jokrz Wild ULTRANUDGE, a retro classic slot. During the same month, Yggdrasil partnered with Peter &amp; Sons to release Water Blox Gigablox Slot.</p>
