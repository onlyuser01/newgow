<p>A lucky Chicago person has won $1.2 million after matching all five Lucky Day Lotto numbers. As of the time of this writing, the player has yet to claim their prize.</p>
<p>The winning ticket was sold at a Jewel Osco store in the Lake View community area on October 27. The player in question correctly guessed the winning combination, which was as follows: 14-15-24-25-34.</p>
<p>The store which sold the winning ticket is set to receive a $12,000 bonus for selling the winning ticket. The bonus represents 1% of the total amount of the jackpot. The winner, meanwhile, has a year from the date of the draw to collect the prize.</p>
<p>The lottery advised the winner to keep the ticket safe until he redeems it. Officials also advised them to write their name on the back of the ticket just in case.</p>
<p>For reference, the jackpot winner isn’t the only lottery player to return home richer. According to official statistics, a total of 50,000 players in the state have drawn a winning ticket. In total, the lottery will hand more than $1.3 million in prizes.</p>
<p>The winner was congratulated by Rush Street Interactive’s president, Richard Schwartz, who said that her win shows that online gambling allows players to achieve life-changing victories no matter the time or place.</p>
<p>In other news, a player from New Jersey just turned a $2 online bet into a $290,000 payday. The lucky woman was playing Divine Fortune on SugarHouse Online Casino’s online platform during an online conference when she struck the prize and almost screamed mid-call.</p>
<p>The New Powerball Jackpot Continues to Grow</p>
<p>In the meantime, America braces for the upcoming Powerball draw, which will provide players with a shot at a staggering $152 million prize. The Powerball jackpot has been ramping up for several weeks now, tempting more and more players with its size.</p>
<p>In October, a Californian player won the previous Powerball jackpot, which had reached $1.765 billion. This was notably the largest jackpot in the history of the game. However, this led some players to question the legitimacy of the game.</p>
