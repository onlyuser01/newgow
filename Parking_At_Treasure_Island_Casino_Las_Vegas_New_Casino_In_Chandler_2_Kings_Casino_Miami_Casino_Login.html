<p>Despite having to go through the qualification playoffs, Portugal is expected to do very well in the 2022 FIFA World Cup. Oddsmakers expect Cristiano Ronaldo &amp; Co. to advance to the Round of 16 from the no.1 position in Group H. Uruguay is predicted to finish just behind them, in the no.2 position.</p>
<p>Although it’s not often the case, we do agree with bookies on everything regarding Group H. Keep on reading to learn why we think Portugal and Uruguay will advance to the knockouts in that specific order.</p>
<p>2022 World Cup Group H Winner Prediction – Portugal (-149)</p>
<p>Portugal is currently eighth in the list of 2022 World Cup favorites with the betting odds of +1650 at the moment of writing. The reason why the odds aren’t shorter is that Portugal struggled in the qualifiers. This team finished second in the qualification group, which meant that they had to play in the qualification playoffs.</p>
<p>They did qualify for the World Cup Finals in the end, but that made the bookies uncertain about their chances in Qatar. Still, we do have faith in them. The reason is simple – Portugal’s roster is incredibly strong in 2022.</p>
<p>Cristiano Ronaldo is their captain, but Portugal isn’t a one-man army. Instead, this team has some incredible players in literally every position on the pitch. That said, we do expect them to go (relatively) far in Qatar.</p>
<p>Group H Runner-Up Prediction – Uruguay (+150)</p>
<p>Uruguay might not be as strong as Portugal, but this team is definitely better than South Korea and Ghana. With players like Darwin Nunez, Luis Suarez, Edinson Cavani, Rodrigo Bentancur, and others.</p>
<p>Uruguay just needs to advance to the knockout phase of the 2022 World Cup. If they fail to do so, it’s going to be a huge upset.</p>
<p>Best Group H Prop Bet – Exact Order: Portugal/Uruguay/South Korea/Ghana (+450)</p>
<p>As explained previously, we think Portugal will win Group H. The team that will almost certainly finish in second place in Uruguay. But, what about the remaining two spots?</p>
<p>We think South Korea is (slightly) better than Ghana, which should be enough for this team to finish in the no.3 position. This team’s biggest star is Tottenham’s forward Heung-min Son, but South Korea does have many other amazing players on the roster, even though they aren’t as famous as him.</p>
<p>When it comes to Ghana, this team’s biggest star is Jordan Ayew, who plays for Crystal Palace. He’s a decent player, but we doubt he can carry this team to success in Qatar.</p>
