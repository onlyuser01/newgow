    <h1>Doubledown Casino Game Attire For Casino The D Casino Hotel The Meadows Casino Binion S Casino Las V</h1>

<p>It's been approved but now I get a email saying you are are waiting on a free tracking number and it's going to be over 30 days. To be honest that is absolutely bull crap. A customer should not have to wait. Now I have to put my self at risk and download bitcoin that I have never used on my life. On your site it says if you make a mistake you will not get your funds. Me as a first time user of bitcoin may mistake. It's just your way of making more money and screwing the consumer. As for my account like I mentioned I can't get on and it says I do now exist and also just a side note.. if your going to have other countries using your site you should have a procedure in place so those countries do not have to listen to the excuses your company makes . Accommodate everyone. Also I would highly suggest secret shopping your own site. Make a profile , and ask multiple questions to multiple representatives and you will see they all have no clue what to do. After writing this is was brought to my attention that sites that use bitcoin know it's a scam. So basically once I receive it and something happens it's totally gone. So again my suspicion of your site is still at 1000 %</p>
