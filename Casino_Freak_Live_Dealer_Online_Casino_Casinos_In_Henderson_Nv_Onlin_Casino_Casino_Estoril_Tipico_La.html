    <h1>Casino Freak Live Dealer Online Casino Casinos In Henderson Nv Onlin Casino Casino Estoril Tipico La</h1>

<p>Malta-based sports betting operator Tipico announced the launch of its sports betting app in New Jersey, marking its official entry to the US regulated market. Following a conditional approval by the state’s Division of Gaming Enforcement (DGE) in September and a soft launch in October, the full rollout now made Tipico’s proprietary sportsbook app available for bettors in the Garden State.</p>
<p>Data from Sportradar Will Power the Sportsbook App</p>
<p>Powered by official sports data from the leader in betting data supply Sportradar and managed by an in-house team based in New Jersey, the new app launch is celebrated by sign-up promotions and cash offers for new customers, including a $100 maximum cash match on bets of $25 or more, available through December 21.</p>
<p>Tipico also launched an advertising campaign across the US to facilitate its official entry in the sports betting market by outlining the company’s nearly 2 decades in sports betting and strong commitment to treat sports bettors with the required level of customer respect they deserve.</p>
<p>Speaking about the launch of the sports betting app, Keith Gormley, head of US marketing at the gaming operator said that, as one of the “strongest and most recognizable brands in all of sports betting and online gaming”, the company is aware of the deep commitment bettors in the US “have for their craft”, as well as “the passion for sports”, and have integrated all these in the inaugural campaign.</p>
<p>One Year of Development</p>
<p>The US journey for Tipico began in December 2019, when the operator opened an office in New Jersey and appointed Adrian Vella as its US Managing Director. Since then, the gaming company employed individuals within sportsbook development, digital marketing, cloud-engineering and other roles.</p>
<p>The company made significant steps towards entering the US sports betting market in July 2020, when it partnered with US omni-channel digital ad services provider Digiland to make it its main US buyer, and signed deals for gaming content with NetEnt and access to the OpenGaming aggregation platform to power up its iGaming offering with Scientific Games.</p>
<p>“Tipico is a betting experience unlike any other and we are confident that as we expand our reach in the US, users will love the new features we are regularly adding to the app. This is just the start, but we are proud to call New Jersey our home and it’s been great to see the positive response from sports bettors across the state.” Adrian Vella, Managing Director, US Business, Tipico</p>
<p>The official launch is just the beginning for the European sportsbook operator, with the next step being entry into the sports betting market in Colorado. In October, Tipico teamed up with NASDAQ-traded Century Casinos to become the third sports betting provider for the casino operator, besides Circa Sports and Bet365.</p>
