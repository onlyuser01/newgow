    <h1>How To Do Diamond Casino Heist Casino Syracuse Ny Isle Capri Casino Lake Charles Louisiana Live Casi</h1>

<p>For 2 years i am already playing on iGame. I made several deposits and several withdrawals.</p>
<p>This sunday i wanted to cashout again but on monday i got a e-mail that there is something wrong with my bankaccount.</p>
<p>According iGame is the bankaccount on B instead of C with my backname.</p>
<p>I told them B and C are the same person since B is my nickname.</p>
<p>When i opened the bankaccount i was 6 years old and was proud that i could open my bankaccount. I did not know better than my name was B instead of C (what is the name on my passport). Now a few years later, everything is on C since i got problems with renting a car when i was on holiday.</p>
<p>So my cards and all are now on C. Only when i make a deposit my bank shows that it is from B.</p>
<p>After i think 200 deposits iGame found this out and made a problem out of this.</p>
<p>I provided them with a Screenshot from my internetbanking + my card and still no answer from iGame.</p>
<p>After every mail you send you have to wait 7!!! days!</p>
<p>I told them already that if they do not believe me that they should handle it as a fraud case and just send all the deposits back to the bankaccount from what they think is from B minus the withdrawals. But really no respond from iGame what so ever.</p>
