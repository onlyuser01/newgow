<p>“Players around the world have loved discovering exciting mechanics and features within our recent hit releases, so we’re thrilled to present The Funky Boombox with its variety of ways to win.“ Joey Hurtado, managing director at Wizard Games</p>
<p>Joey Hurtado, Wizard Games’ managing director, explained that the new game delivers highly popular features and mechanics. He added that online players enjoy such mechanics and pointed out that The Funky Boombox offers a variety of chances for wins. Finally, Hurtado said: “With colorful, engaging visuals, a nostalgic ‘80s soundtrack and plenty of chances for players to land bonuses and wins with Collect Pots and the Free Spins bonus, we can’t wait to see the reception to this release.”</p>
<p>Boombox Multipliers, Funky Wheel and Pick and Match Mechanic</p>
<p>The base game of the 5×3 slot enables players to grow progressive Collect Pots. This, according to Wizard Games is boosted when five or more Funky Boombox symbols land on the reels, regardless of where. The more Boombox symbols the players secure, the higher the multiplier.</p>
<p>Additionally, the game offers a Funky Wheel spin. To activate this functionality, the players need to land three Funky Wheel symbols on the first, third and fifth reels. This takes them to a special Funky Wheel Bonus round that gives players a chance “to collect credits and multipliers or a progressive Collect Pot prize.”</p>
<p>Last but not least, online players can also benefit from the Free Spins feature that activates a Pick and Match mechanic. To activate this, players need to land three Free Spins symbols on the reels. Then they will have the option to choose three matching tiles that can reveal up to 20 free games.</p>
