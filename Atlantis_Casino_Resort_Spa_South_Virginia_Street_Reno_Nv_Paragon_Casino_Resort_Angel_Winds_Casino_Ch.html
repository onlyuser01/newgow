<p>Compliable, a gaming licensing firm, has struck a partnership deal with the leading tech and consultancy company Odds On Compliance. The agreement will see the two join forces to help operators navigate the complex US regulatory landscape.</p>
<p>Odds On Compliance Will Help Compliable with Its Expertise</p>
<p>The agreement will see Odds On Compliance power Compliable’s White Glove Onboarding service with its licensing expertise. White Glove Onboarding is an add-on service through which operators can get a two-hour consultation on compliance. It is divided into two one-hour parts. First, operators can address any concerns they have about licensing and regulations. After that, experts will help customers review their required forms before submitting them.</p>
<p>As per the agreement, clients will first get their compliance issues sorted out on Compliable’s platform. Following that, they will be redirected to Odds On Compliance’s expert support team which will provide further help and counsel.</p>
<p>Eric Frank, co-founder and chief executive at Odds On Compliance, shared his thoughts. He emphasized that combining Compliable’s tech with Odds On Compliance’s experience will result in another best-in-class service for the industry.</p>
<p>Frank noted that Odds On Compliance is always tuned with the constantly changing US regulatory landscape. Because of that, it is well-positioned to offer important counsel to gambling companies that wish to operate in the region.</p>
<p>Compliable Will Enhance Its Cutting-Edge Offering</p>
<p>In short, the partnership will combine Odds On Compliance’s long experience with Compliable’s tech expertise. Therefore, the two companies will be able to deliver enhanced counsel to customers that need regulatory help. The firms will guide operators through complex licensing processes and help them remain compliant in each and every market where they launch.</p>
<p>Compliable already offers intuitive and easy-to-use licensing solutions and numerous tools that help operators fulfill the regulatory conditions of US markets. Paired with Odds On Compliance’s counsel, Compliable will offer professional expertise that will help operators solve all regulatory issues.</p>
<p>Compliable’s chief executive officer, Chris Oltyan, also commented on the new partnership. He said his team feels thrilled to team up with Odds and Compliance and help companies navigate the US gambling sector.</p>
<p>Oltyan also spoke about Compliable’s solutions and pointed out that the firm offers the best tools for licensing in the industry. He believes that Odds On Compliance’s “wealth of knowledge and consulting experience” will help the duo “massively accelerate” its customers’ entrance to the market.</p>
