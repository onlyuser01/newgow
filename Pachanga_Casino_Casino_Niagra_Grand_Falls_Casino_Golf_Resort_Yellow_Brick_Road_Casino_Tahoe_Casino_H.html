    <h1>Pachanga Casino Casino Niagra Grand Falls Casino Golf Resort Yellow Brick Road Casino Tahoe Casino H</h1>

<p>Danske Spil’s board has elected a new Licens Spil (licensed games) chief executive, set to take over in 2022 – Karsten Fogh Holanng. Licens Spil is the online gambling and sportsbook unit of Denmark’s gambling operator, which is owned by the state.</p>
<p>Holanng Will Take Over in February 2022</p>
<p>Before being appointed as Licens Spil’s new inbound chief executive, Holanng served as the unit’s CIO since 2016. Per records, Holanng will take up the new role in February 2022. With this appointment, Niels Erik Folmann is getting a replacement.</p>
<p>Folmann announced that he won’t serve as Licens Spil’s CEO anymore and thus, ended his tenure that lasted nine years. The reason why he chose to part ways with Licens Spil is that he will be joining Tivoli, a theme park operator from Denmark, as the CCO.</p>
<p>One of the main tasks that Holanng will have as the unit’s chief executive includes leading the performance of the online gaming portfolio of Danske Spil. The portfolio features the entity’s Casino, Tips, Oddset, Poker And Bingo verticals.</p>
<p>Danske Spil Group CEO, Nikolas Lyhne-Knudsen, stated that Holanng is the best candidate to replace Folmann and added that he has extensive knowledge of the company’s partners and its business and has delivered fantastic results for Danske Spil while working as an IT officer.</p>
<p>Lyhne-Knudsen is also pleased to draw far more from Hollang’s managerial and commercial experience by being the director of the Danske Licens Spil.</p>
<p>In a concluding statement of Danske Spil, Lyhne-Knudsen issued a thank-you-note to Folmann for his contributions as a leader of Danske Spil. In the note, Lyhne-Knudsen said that Folmann and his strong team succeeded in maintaining the company’s market position as a leader and he managed to balance its approach to responsibility with decent financial results.</p>
<p>Danske Spill is Looking For Replacements in Other Positions</p>
<p>Danske Spil is also looking for a new CEO of Danske Spil Lotteries. The reason why is that Pernille Mehl will end his 6-year tenure in the said working position at the end of this month. Mehl will join as a Group CEO of a company that is yet to be announced.</p>
<p>Finding decent replacements and being surrounded by the biggest experts in the gambling industry is of massive importance to Danske Spil. After all, gambling is a major part of its economy and a recent study clarified its importance. The goal in the country remains the same – to provide its residents with the most secure and most entertaining experience, while also promoting responsible gambling and making sure that underage kids are not involved in this industry.</p>
