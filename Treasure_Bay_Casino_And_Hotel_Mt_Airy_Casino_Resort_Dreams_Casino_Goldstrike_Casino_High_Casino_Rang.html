<p>Glasgow Rangers Going for the Title This Year</p>
<p>In the 2023-24 season of the Scottish Premiership, the manager of Glasgow Rangers FC is Michael Beale. He was the assistant to Steven Gerard during Glasgow’s title-winning season three years ago. It was the last time The Gers took the trophy away from Celtic in 10 years. The Celts got it back the next season and defended it in the previous campaign.</p>
<p>But Rangers do have big ambitions this season. It’s not only because they’ve got a good coach whom they know and love; it’s also because this team’s roster looks really strong in 2023. The Gers made some really good signings over the summer, starting with former Crystal Palace goalkeeper Jack Butland. They also signed midfielder Jose Cifuentes from the MLS Cup-winning team Los Angeles FC.</p>
<p>Still, it’s their offensive department that they’ve strengthened the most, which they had to do after terminating the contract of Alfredo Morales who was their talisman in the previous season. They signed Danilo from Feyenoord, who’s their eighth-most expensive transfer of the 21st century. They also brought Cyriel Dessers from Cremonese, as well as Sam Lammers from Sampdoria.</p>
<p>Celtic Playing Great Soccer in 2023</p>
<p>Same as their archrivals, The Hoops too have made a lot of signings during the summer transfer period, although, if we’re being frank, they’re not as good as those made by Rangers FC.</p>
<p>This summer, they also sold a couple of players, most notably, Jota, who moved for over $30 million to Al Ittihad of the Saudi Pro League. The Portuguese winger was Celtic’s key player in the last two seasons, which is why there were worries about how they would cope without him. But so far, so good. At least in the domestic league.</p>
<p>We’re three rounds into the 2023-24 Scottish Premiership and Celtic is sitting top of the table with a 2-1-0 record and a score difference of 7-3. What’s got to worry them is that the draw in question happened in the previous round of the Premiership when they played 0-0 with St. Johnstone at home. And a few days before that, we saw them lose 1-0 to Kilmarnock on the road in the Scottish League Cup.</p>
<p>Rangers vs. Celtic Prediction</p>
<p>The Gers look set to win this game. They usually do well in The Old Firm duels played on their turf, and in 2023, they seem as if they could do great wherever they might play. That said, we do think they’re going to triumph on Sunday at Ibrox.</p>
