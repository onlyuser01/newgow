<p>1x2 Network has added a new partner to its list of third-party suppliers that provide partners with excellent games across the board</p>
<p>The newest partnership targets Gromada, an iGaming studio known for its outstanding gaming titles. Thanks to this partnership, 1×2 Network is able to host content for a number of prominent brands included as part of Gromada’s offer, to name Grand Vision Gaming, Sega Sammy, and Azure.</p>
<p>Gromada and 1×2 Network Strengthen Their Offer through Partnership</p>
<p>Gromada Games is a fairly new and upcoming studio. It was founded by Predrag Popovic and Soeren Christensen, both of whom are part of the iGaming industry elite and have years of experience under their belt.</p>
<p>Gromada focuses on delivering proprietary and original games that are meant to establish the studio’s signature. The studio is joining a number of products, including 1×2 Network’s own products, to wit 1x2gaming and Iron Dog Studio titles designed to appeal to large swathes of players and demographics.</p>
<p>1×2 Network is particularly happy with the opportunity to expand its portfolio and list of partners with this new addition. Commenting on the collaboration, 1×2 Network Chris Loftus said that the company was thrilled to add Gromada’s impressive portfolio of titles.</p>
<p>The opportunity to feature games by Azure, Sega Sammy, and GVG is a fantastic chance to truly expand customer bases and bring existing players unprecedented and unrivaled experiences. Gromada co-founder Popovic was equally chuffed at the opportunity.</p>
<p>He said that the company was extremely proud to expand its reach in the regulated European market with a trusted and respected partner 1×2 Network, seeking to consolidate its footprint there.</p>
<p>1×2 Network has had a string of successful partnerships over the last weeks and months. The company expanded its collaboration with Markor Technology. The company also launched in the Ontario gaming market through an 888casino linkup.</p>
