<p>Sports betting network VSiN announced today it expanded an existing partnership deal with iHeartMedia to bring its unique sports betting markets coverage to iHeartRadio. The leading three-in-one free digital music, radio and podcasting platform will serve as a vehicle to increase VSiN’s audio reach to new listeners for free starting January 1, 2021.</p>
<p>“We’re thrilled to build on the success we’ve had with iHeart on the podcasting and betcasting front to announce an expanded partnership that will help us offer a better product to a broader audience for free.” Brian Musburger, Founder and CEO, VSiN</p>
<p>Free Service for the First Time</p>
<p>VSiN’s CEO further noted that by removing the subscription fee on audio platforms would launch a new phase for the company, providing it with a technologically ubiquitous vehicle for live programming around the clock, to allow it to reach to more listeners on more devices and boost its advertising revenue.</p>
<p>The terms of the expanded deal relate to the dedicated live iHeartRadio station, where VSiN will broadcast on a daily basis live from sportsbooks and gaming properties across the country, offering credible information for sports betting purposes from reliable sources, as well as discussing real-time news, analysis and data to provide insights into the process of setting betting lines while entertaining sports fans.</p>
<p>Additionally, the iHeartPodcast Network will distribute current VSiN’s shows, besides ensuring the network collaboration of the No.1 podcast publisher on the development of new podcast products underlying sports betting.</p>
<p>The third scope of the expanded deal, betcasts, concerns the recently debuted EPL BetCast Radio which delivers audio sports betting content to soccer fans by leveraging iHeartRadio’s technology platform to stream low latency high quality news feeds and provide sports fans with invaluable information.</p>
<p>Under the partnership which would deliver one marquee soccer game each week for the 2020-2021 EPL season, several new sports betcasts would be launched.</p>
<p>Ideal Platform to Expand Audio Reach</p>
<p>VSiN, which is at the forefront of the sports betting industry since its launch in 2017, delivers the most credible content, according to iHeartRadio and iHeartMedia Network Groups president Darren Davis.</p>
<p>“iHeartRadio is the ideal platform to enable this team to reach an even larger audience, and to educate and entertain more sports fans on the betting industry.” Darren Davis, President, iHeartRadio and iHeartMedia Network Groups</p>
<p>The Las Vegas sports media network is recognized by some of the largest casino and gaming operators, including BetMGM and Circa Sports.</p>
<p>In August, the sports betting broadcasting network teamed up with the sports betting brand of MGM Resorts’ and GVC Holdings’ joint venture Roar Digital, to discuss latest moves in sports under the Betting Across America show, which broadcasts live from BetMGM venues.</p>
<p>VSiN also partnered with Circa Resorts Casino in Las Vegas to establish sports betting television studio and radio booths for the state-of-the-art sportsbook of the property which opened doors in the end of October.</p>
