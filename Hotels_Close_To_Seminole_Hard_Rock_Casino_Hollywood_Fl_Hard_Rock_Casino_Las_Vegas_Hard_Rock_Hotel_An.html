    <h1>Hotels Close To Seminole Hard Rock Casino Hollywood Fl Hard Rock Casino Las Vegas Hard Rock Hotel An</h1>

<p>Good afternoon.</p>
<p>I played at this casino on a Sunday I won those values on the slot machine I tried to get some and I couldn't, in the morning the next day it appeared that my account had been frozen for security reasons, I informed me what was going on and sent my documentation, then I set up a Skype meeting with the casino, after that meeting they said it would take 2-3 weeks to give an answer. They took 4 weeks to respond and this Thursday they told me this by direct message from the casino: "Good evening,</p>
<p>Unfortunately your Mostbet account has been permanently blocked based on clause 2.5 of our terms of use.</p>

<p>I am fully aware of the casino rules and know that I have not disrespected the casino and as such I would like to understand why I cannot get my money out.</p>
<p>carefully</p>
