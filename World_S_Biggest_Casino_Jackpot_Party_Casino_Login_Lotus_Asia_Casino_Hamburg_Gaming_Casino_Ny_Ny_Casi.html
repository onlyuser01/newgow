    <h1>World S Biggest Casino Jackpot Party Casino Login Lotus Asia Casino Hamburg Gaming Casino Ny Ny Casi</h1>

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>My account has been blocked and forwarded for review. I have deposited two of my cards and two foreign cards that have been fully verified, as well as their owners in my account. Today I requested a withdrawal and received the following response from efbet:</p>
<hr />
<p>Your account has been reviewed in detail before making the desired withdrawal. It has been established that you have made successful deposits with foreign funds once again after you have been warned. According to the rules of the site, your account must be closed until the next order.</p>
<p>The case was handed over to a management team to make a competent decision. Expect an answer as soon as possible.</p>
<hr />
<p>My friends are ready to come to the office with me, if of course from efbet they express a wish, but I doubt ...</p>
<p>My questions are the following:</p>
<p>"What can I expect to happen?"</p>
<p>"Can I do something for me?"</p>
<ul>
<li>Why is this rule and why do they give information about it after a withdrawal is required and not a deposit?</li>
</ul>
