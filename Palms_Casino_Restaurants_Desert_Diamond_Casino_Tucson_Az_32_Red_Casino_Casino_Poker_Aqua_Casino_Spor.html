<p>Sportradar has teamed up with DOJO Madness to launch a dedicated esports joint-venture â€“ Bayes Esports Solutions.</p>
<p>Esports will be worth a billion US dollars in 2019</p>
<p>Betting on the outcome of esports is becoming more popular</p>
<p>Companies seek a better way to outsmart customers</p>
<p>Dojo Madness &amp; Sportradar create Bayes Esports Solutions to help B2B customers</p>
<p>DOJO Madness Will Develop Esports Data-Driven Solutions</p>
<p>Business customers can finally get an edge against esports fans. Esports betting has proven a lucrative segment for some â€“ mostly gamers who have been following games for years, developing a keen, visceral understanding for what transpires on the screen.</p>
<p>Since 2015, multiple companies have been entering the segment for esports betting solutions, including Betway, Pinnacle, Unikrn, and Rivalry.</p>
<p>Bayes Esports Solutions will give us equity in a rapidly growing market and the dedicated resource and expertise to design and develop market leading products and services for the esports market.</p>
<p>Many others today have esports markets to offer to customers as well. Only a few turn a profit, though Pinnacle and Betway are supposedly among the few bookmakers to actually finish a financial year in the black. Unikrn, a fully-committed esports platform, has been one of the first licensed companies in the United States to legally offer this type of bets.</p>
<p>Sportradar is now keen on exploring new opportunities by providing data-driven information to their B2B customers through a newly set-up venture, Bayes Esports Solutions. The company is not going it alone, having brought DOJO Madness on board to help build reliable products.</p>
<p>Sportradar has already partnered with noteworthy esports organizations, specifically ESL.</p>
<p>Game predictions &amp; data aggregator â€“ Bayes Esports Solutions Adds Value</p>
<p>Bayes Esports Solutions will focus on supplying companies with reliable esports predictions as well as give broadcasters access to various information in real-time, allowing them to go into detail and better breakdown the gameplay for viewers.</p>
<p>While some games such as Dota 2, Counter-Strike, Fortnite, Rocket League and others hardly need an explanation, this could be a potentially useful tool for some of the tougher nuts to crack â€“ including Valveâ€™s recent flop of a game â€“ Artifact.</p>
<p>"The Bayes Esports Solutions joint venture is a game changer." We're partnering with @DOJOMADNESS for the launch of Bayes Esports Solutions â€“ a joint venture that will leverage #esports data products. ðŸ”—https://t.co/Rl2ZT7ukam pic.twitter.com/Ssd2jnHkp9 â€” Sportradar (@Sportradar) January 24, 2019</p>
<p>Bayes Esports Solutions will be managed by Martin Dachselt who has expressed great hopes for the partnership between DOJO and Sportradar:</p>
<p>The successful cooperation we had with Sportradar is now giving birth to a full joint venture between both companies merging the best experiences of both parties in a fully independent business entity: deep esports domain experience from DOJO paired with Sportradarâ€™s global experience and relationships in the sports betting industry including integrity services and quality assurance.</p>
<p>Sportradar Managing Director Warren Murphy welcomed the opportunity, highlighting his own companyâ€™s expertise in esports.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Murphy, the collaboration with DOJO will allow Bayes Esports Solutions to develop a product in a rapidly expanding market. In fact, the video gaming market is larger than Hollywood, although this doesnâ€™t necessarily apply to esports, or to the particular segment that Bayes Esports Solutions target for the time being.</p>
<p>Still, by diversifying early on and offering value added services to the esports community, Bayes Esports Solutions are on the right path to becoming an important element of the multi-faceted ecosystem of competitive video gaming.</p>
