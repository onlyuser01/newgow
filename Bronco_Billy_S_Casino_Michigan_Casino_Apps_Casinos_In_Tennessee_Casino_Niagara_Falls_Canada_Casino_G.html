<p>Bragg is thrilled to deepen its relationship with Flutter by powering Adjarabet with exciting, player-engaging content</p>
<p>Bragg Gaming Group, a content-driven iGaming technology provider, has expanded its global footprint, launching content in Georgia thanks to an agreement with Adjarabet. The latter company is a Flutter-owned operator and one of the best gambling companies in Georgia.</p>
<p>As agreed, Bragg Gaming will inject both proprietary and aggregated content into Adjarabet’s platform, providing its customers with many new games. Thanks to the supplier’s Remote Game Server technology, Georgian players will get to experience a number of titles from Bragg’s proprietary studios, Atomic Slot Lab and Indigo Magic.</p>
<p>Some of the in-house titles that will become available to Adjarabet players include Fairy Dust, Queenie and Egyptian Magic. In addition to that, Bragg will also power its new partner with a selection of aggregated games from third-party studios. Under the deal, more titles will be added to the deal in the coming months.</p>
<p>As mentioned, Adjarabet is the leading operator in Georgia. Founded over 20 years ago, the company provides online gambling and sports betting to local audiences. The operator was acquired by Flutter in 2019 and has been steadily growing ever since.</p>
<p>The agreement with Adjarabet will further reinforce Bragg Gaming’s European footprint, following recent deals in Switzerland and Spain.</p>
