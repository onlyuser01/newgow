<p>Buddy Byron McKenzie, 41, of Richland, Wash. allegedly fired a gun at officers in Caribou County, Idaho last Wednesday. That led to a chase, which ended with police fatally shooting him near McCammon, Idaho.</p>
<p>During the pursuit, he was followed by several officers in their patrol cars. They also lay down spikes on a highway to puncture tires on his pickup truck.</p>
<p>When he drove over them, the tires got deflated, but McKenzie kept on driving on rims. His truck eventually stopped on Highway 30.</p>
<p>McKenzie then aimed his firearm at officers, police said. They shot him. The entire pursuit lasted about 20 minutes.</p>
<p>McKenzie’s death remains under investigation by the Southeastern Idaho Critical Incident Team.</p>
<p>“After a lethal threat from the suspect, law enforcement was forced to fire their weapons,” according to a Facebook post from the Bannock County Sheriff’s Office.</p>
<p>The suspect was pronounced deceased on scene. Officers involved were not physically injured.”</p>
<p>McKenzie was wanted for the alleged shooting of his ex-girlfriend outside of Legends Casino in Toppenish, Wash. on Oct. 4. She was wounded in the stomach and head.</p>
<p>There was a warrant out for his arrest for charges of attempted first-degree murder, first-degree assault, and second-degree unlawful firearms possession, according to a news report.</p>
<p>The victim at the casino was identified last week as Lupe Torres, 37, KIMA, a local TV station, reported.</p>
<p>She required hospitalization. Earlier, Torres rejected McKenzie following a relationship, apparently leading to the shooting, it was revealed by a poster on Facebook.</p>
<p>The victim is the mother of children, the post adds.</p>
<p>Following the fatal shooting, McKenzie’s identity was confirmed late last week by the Bannock County Coroner and the local sheriff’s office.</p>
<p>Prior Convictions</p>
<p>McKenzie had prior convictions for felony harassment, fourth-degree assault, violating protection orders, taking a motor vehicle without permission, and second-degree possession of stolen property.</p>
<p>Other convictions were for obstruction, intimidating a witness, and unlawful imprisonment, according to the Yakima Herald-Republic, a Washington State newspaper.</p>
<p>The Legends Casino Hotel is located on the Yakama Indian Reservation. It is about 162 miles southeast of Seattle.</p>
<p>Muckleshoot Casino Shooting</p>
<p>In an unrelated incident, last Wednesday a late-night shooting near Washington State’s Muckleshoot Casino Resort left one person wounded. A suspect was placed in custody.</p>
<p>The unidentified victim was taken to Seattle’s Harborview Medical Center. The person’s condition was not immediately available.</p>
