    <h1>Casinos With Slot Machines Near Me Lucky Seven Casino South Point Casino And Hotel In Las Vegas Casi</h1>

<p>Dear Casino Guru Team,</p>
<p>I contacted Tigerspin by email 2 days ago that I was at risk of gambling addiction and would like to close my account. No answer yet, the account is still open.</p>
<p>I also noticed and stated this in the same email to Tigerspin that the Tigerspin Casino runs under the same license MGA / B2C / 284/2014 as Lapalingo. I have been banned from Lapalingo for a long time due to gambling addiction. Attached you will find the confirmation that I am banned there due to gambling addiction.</p>
<p>As part of the MGA license, I should not have been able to register, let alone verify, at Tigerspins Casino, as you are obliged to comply with the gambling addiction lock casino license across the board. I am already verified there.</p>
<p>I am relying on the following information.</p>
<p>MGA Player Protection Directive (2018) - Part IV - Responsible Gaming:</p>
<p>"Provided further that, in the event that a player has been excluded by the B2C</p>
<p>licensee in light of sufficient reasons which indicate that the player may have problem gambling issues, that player shall be excluded across all brands operated by the B2C licensee. "</p>
<p>The "sufficient reason" are legally more than fulfilled with my ban on Lapalingo.</p>
<p>I've consistently used the same data. Username and mail were also identical in the casinos.</p>
<p>I therefore request the repayment of my € 100 deposit at Tiger Spins.</p>
<p>So far, Tigerspins has not contacted me about the account closure or my reimbursement request.</p>
<p>I only ask for the deposit of € 100 as I should not have been allowed to register at Tigerspins Casino.</p>
<p>I thank you for your feedback.</p>
