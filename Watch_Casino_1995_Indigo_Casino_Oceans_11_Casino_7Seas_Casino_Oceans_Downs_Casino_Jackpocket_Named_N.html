<p>Jackpocket, an app that allows users to buy tickets for various lottery games, has expanded its partnership agreement with the New York Islanders, a famous National Hockey League (NHL) team. As per the deal, the lottery app will become the franchise’s official home helmet partner.</p>
<p>The New York Islanders have picked Jackpocket as their official home helmet partner. This means that the lottery app’s branding will appear on the players’ helmets during their home games throughout the 2022/23 NHL season.</p>
<p>In addition, the Islanders will promote Jackpocket’s brand across their stadium and broadcasts and will feature the company’s logo on its Digitally Enhanced Dashboards during TV broadcasts. The lottery brand will get a total of two minutes of airtime per match, thus greatly expanding its brand recognition among fans of the Islanders.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Islanders will also feature Jackpocket’s barding on its LED signage at the UBS Arena, the team’s home stadium. All live broadcasts of the team’s home games will take place from Jackpocket’s Radio Booth.</p>
<p>Lastly, Jackpocket and the New York Islanders will provide sports fans with opportunities to win various rewards, including UBS Arena tickets and UBS Club fan experiences. Smaller prizes include various Islanders-branded items.</p>
<p>Both Parties Are Glad to Deepen their Partnership</p>
<p>The new NHL season notably marks the Islanders’ 50th anniversary in the league. The franchise’s co-owner, Jon Ledecky, spoke about the new agreement. He said that the team is glad to expand its existing partnership with the lottery company and welcome it as the official sponsor of its home helmets.</p>
<p>Ledecky added that the NHL team deeply trusts Jackpocket and is looking forward to working with the company.</p>
<p>Jackpocket is a trusted partner, and we could not be more excited for the ways that we are working together to evolve our digital and game day experiences for our loyal fans. Jon Ledecky, co-owner, NY Islanders</p>
<p>Peter Sullivan, the founder and chief executive of Jackpocket, praised the Islanders as a true-blue New York institution. He said that his team is delighted to deepen its ties with the franchise and become its home helmet sponsor.</p>
<p>Sullivan added that Jackpocket has also been named as the official digital lottery courier for all live events at the team’s home stadium.</p>
<p>We’re also very proud to be the official digital lottery courier for all live events at the UBS Arena, where we look forward to providing an easy way to order lottery tickets from the convenience of a smartphone for all fans and visitors to the arena. Peter Sullivan, CEO, Jackpocket</p>
<p>Jackpocket has cemented itself as a well-known name in New York. In late August this year, the lottery app awarded its sixth $1 million lottery prize in the state.</p>
