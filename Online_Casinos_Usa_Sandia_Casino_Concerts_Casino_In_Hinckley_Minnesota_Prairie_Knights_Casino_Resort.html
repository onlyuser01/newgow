<p>Paf has expanded its collaboration with Tallink Grupp, with plans to review and modernize entertainment and improve responsible gambling onboard the vessels</p>
<p>Nordic gaming operator founded on the Åland Islands “with the clear purpose to generate funds to be used for the benefit of society,” Paf, has announced an extension of its lucrative partnership with shipping company Tallink Grupp.</p>
<p>The newly inked multi-year cooperation agreement will allow Paf to keep offering its gaming entertainment options onboard Tallink’s vessels.</p>
<p>Tallink Grupp, “Pleased to Continue” the Long-Standing Agreement</p>
<p>The shipping company’s chief operating officer for Land &amp; Ship, Lasse Danielsson, took the opportunity to express their pleasure for the continuation of their “long-standing history” with Paf.</p>
<p>Danielsson also referred to the freshly updated partnership as “an important step towards further improving the entertainment experience” for their customers.</p>
<p>The group currently operates a number of passenger ships in the Northern Baltic Sea area under the Tallink and Silja Line brands.</p>
<p>Tallink’s excitement is also motivated by the announced gaming experience renewal plans expressed by the gaming operator that showed impressive performance in 2022.</p>
<p>The Customer Journey Concept</p>
<p>The operator is determined to change the way entertainment is offered onboard Tallink Grupp’s ships. The ships operate under the Silja Line brand between Finland, Sweden, and Åland.</p>
<p>The upgrades are expected to include several new coinless machines that will be integrated with screens meant to improve player’s gaming experiences.</p>
<p>Paf’s key account manager, Christian Lundell, announced the implementation of the Customer Journey concept, which will be used to improve the interaction with players while strengthening their gaming experience and communications regarding their responsible gaming policies.</p>
<p>Paf will also consider the possibility of offering even more gaming opportunities through specific amusement games aimed at adults.</p>
<p>Paf has already implemented a number of updates that have helped improve responsible gaming onboard the group’s ships currently operating to and from Estonia.</p>
<p>Passengers on the respective vessels are asked to identify themselves using boarding cards before they are allowed to play slot machines.</p>
<p>Tallink Grupp’s group entertainment director, Kairi Maidla, spoke about the “higher standard for the gaming activities onboard” obtained via their collaboration with Paf, expressing hope that similar improvements will be brought onboard all their ships alongside Paf in the upcoming years.</p>
<p>In May, Kambi and Paf announced they would strengthen their decade-old partnership in the sportsbook vertical. During the same month, Paf also expanded its collaboration with Finnish shipping company Eckerö Linjen.</p>
<p>September marked the month when the operator decided to continue its innovative tech education program called grit:lab launched two years ago with the purpose of allowing students to learn from each other, thus eliminating the need for teachers.</p>
