<p>Leading developer of multi-award-winning games certified and licensed in more than 20 global jurisdictions, Pragmatic Play, has announced the release of its freshest slot, 3 Buzzing Wilds.</p>
<p>The studio has once again proven its interest to only “craft immersive experiences and responsible thrills” through the new 5×4 game that incorporates a large number of Wilds that generate higher wins and different types of game-altering effects.</p>
<p>At the start of July, the provider released the rock’n’roll-themed slot Hellvis Wild, followed by Power of Merlin Megaways earlier in the month and Spellbinding Mystery Slot at the end of June.</p>

<p>Join the Hive of Sweet Thrills in Paradise Garden</p>
<p>The action is set in what appears to be a garden paradise, filled with buzzing insects whose role is to help players create winning matching combinations across the 20 available paylines. Wins are created from left to right, on adjacent reels.</p>
<p>Landing between three and five identical low-paying or high-paying symbols will trigger wins ranging between $0.50 and $100 for a standard bet of $2. Wild symbols that land on any location and contribute to a winning combination or improve it pay the same as the highest-paying symbol represented by the honey bee.</p>
<p>The developer has also introduced three different types of Special Wild features that can be triggered randomly during the base game:</p>
<p>Random Wilds , which work by awarding a random number of wilds at any given moment in time, on random grid positions</p>
<p>, which work by awarding a random number of wilds at any given moment in time, on random grid positions Expanding Wilds , which work by expanding all wild symbols that are seen popping and filling their reels</p>
<p>, which work by expanding all wild symbols that are seen popping and filling their reels Surrounding Wilds, which work by spawning wild symbols located in all adjacent positions around landing wilds symbols</p>
<p>Free Spins Bonus Rounds</p>
<p>To trigger the bonus round, players need to come across a minimum of three golden beehive scatter symbols. During the round, players are allowed to choose one of three available features inspired by the previously mentioned wild features.</p>
<p>The first one is the Random Wilds Bonus Round which gives players 10 free spins while turning all added wild symbols from the random wilds feature into sticky symbols become for the remainder of the round.</p>
<p>During the Expanding Wilds Bonus Round, players receive eight free spins and see all wilds expanding, covering their reels, and turning into sticky symbols for the rest of the bonus round.</p>
<p>Finally, when the Surrounding Wilds Bonus Round is active, players get to enjoy six free spins and see all wild symbols from the surrounding wilds feature keep their positions frozen for the remainder of the round.</p>
<p>In mid-July, Pragmatic Play inked an important agreement with Finnish monopoly Veikkaus Oy, agreeing to fuel it with fresh games and help it bolster the experiences of its players.</p>
