<p>Being one of the top favorites to win the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, it’s no surprise that England is projected to finish first in Group B. It seems that the real question is who will finish second – the US, Wales, or Iran?</p>
<p>In this post, we’re going to examine the chances of all four teams of Group B, sharing our top predictions along the way.</p>
<p>2022 World Cup Group B Winner Prediction – England (-227)</p>
<p>England to finish in first place in Group B seems like a sure bet. The Three Lions have the most expensive roster of all the teams traveling to Qatar, not to mention that they’ve been playing amazing soccer in 2022.</p>
<p>We know this, but so do the bookies, which is why they’re giving only -227 on this wager. A bet with more value is the one focused on who’s going to finish in second place in the World Cup Group B. So, who’s going to be? The short answer is the United States. For a longer answer, check out the next section.</p>
<p>Group B Runner-Up Prediction – United States (+200)</p>
<p>It’s been a while since the United States Men’s National Soccer Team was this strong. It seems that the Americans have at least one star player in every position on the pitch. Their biggest stars, however, are in the offense. Christian Pulisic, the forward for Chelsea, is their superstar, followed by Giovanni Reyna of Borussia Dortmund, and Timothy Weah of Lille.</p>
<p>The USMNT also have a couple of decent players in the midfield, while their defense doesn’t look that strong. This is why we expect the Americans to score, but also concede a lot of goals during the group phase of the World Cup.</p>
<p>The attacking-minded strategy probably won’t work against England, but we think the US will outscore Wales and Iran. As a result, the USMNT will get to the knockouts from the no.2 position in Group B.</p>
<p>Best Group B Prop Bet – Iran Not to Qualify for Knockouts (-455)</p>
<p>Even though we think the US will get to the knockouts, we can’t say we’re 100% sure of that. The reason is that Wales is also in Group B. We do believe the Americans are better than the Welsh, but the Dragons have some really special players on the roster.</p>
<p>Their captain Gareth Bale is the best example, the man who scored the winning goal for Los Angeles FC in the final moments of the 2022 MLS Cup.</p>
<p>We might not be 100% sure which team will advance to the knockouts, but we’re sure that Iran will not. In fact, we see Iran as the most likely candidate to finish bottom of the Group B table. We even think this team might finish its 2022 World Cup journey with a 0-3 record.</p>
