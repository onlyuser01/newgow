    <h1>100 Dollar Free No Deposit Casino Hotels In Thackerville Ok Near Winstar Casino Casino Niagara Falls</h1>

<p>BetssonGroup and Light &amp; Wonder have expanded on their collaboration, scaling their alliance globally, and ensuring that both parties benefit from a strong exposure and product quality, helping them break into new markets while consolidating their presence in existing ones.</p>
<p>The pair has been working together for a long while, with Light &amp; Wonder leveraging the power of third-party games that have been distributed through the OPENGAMING System (OGS) solution to bolster operators’ libraries across the world. Betsson Group in the meantime is a well-established entity that operates dozens of casino websites in Europe and Latin America.</p>
<p>Thanks to this new partnership, both companies will be benefiting from an expanded footprint and area of their collaboration. Light &amp; Wonder MD Europe Magdalena Podhorska-Okolow welcomed the chance to once again build upon the sound foundation established with Betsson Group as one of the most important partners for the company over the past years.</p>
<p>"The fact that the agreement has been renewed solidifies the group’s plans to view us as a key growth partner," Podhorska-Okolow said. Moving forward, the companies will continue to work together hard to ensure that they meet their ambitious goals and reach their desired results.</p>
<p>Betsson Group Head of Supplier Relations Laura Peretta was similarly excited at this opportunity and said that Light &amp; Wonder has been one of the group’s most trusted suppliers, not just because of the OPENGAMING ecosystem, but also its ability to scale the product offer and constantly seek out and deliver on unique and tailored content.</p>
<p>"We followed a similar path of market entries when the landscape was shifting, and they have always been there for us," Peretta said speaking of the shared ambitions of both companies. In the meantime, OpenGaming is a platform that already features more than 3,500 games which are down to Betsson Group’s brands and players to explore.</p>
<p>Light &amp; Wonder has also been scaling up its presence through individual partnerships and activations in specific markets. The company teamed up with Grand Casino Luzern and its mycasino brand in Switzerland in May. The company also tried to strengthen its presence in social gaming through a bid for SciPlay also in May.</p>
