<p>RAW iGaming has reported that its content aggregation platform, RAW Arena, has already signed a trio of tier-one operators, which will allow the company to demonstrate its capabilities and provide partners with outstanding and more importantly - innovative content, the company said in a press release shared via email.</p>
<p>RAW Arena was created with the idea of only aggregating content from companies that are truly committed to building products that break the industry mold and cast brand-new gameplay features and scenarios. The partnership with PAF.comOlyBet.com and Twin.com marks an important step forward for the aggregation platform.</p>
<p>RAW iGaming rebranded the aggregation solution from Leander LeGa in mid-November, as it wanted to ensure that the company’s brand and name will stick with partners and players. Since the rebrand, RAW has been working on launching with trusted partners, and through innovative games such as LuckyMcGee’s SuperSlice Swirl, Journey to Chaos, and not least – Wheels of Rock.</p>
<p>RAW Arena tries to buck the trend which the parent company says is an industry that is too saturated with similar content. As a result, RAW will try and deliver aggregated content that truly elevates the gameplay experience – something that is easier said than done. OlyBet Casino Manager Erika Padisaar has welcomed the partnership, however, noting that working with aggregators such as RAW Arena was particularly helpful for the brand itself.</p>
<p>New and exciting content is always uppermost in the minds of the operator, says Padisaar, and this is precisely why OlyBet.com has sought to work with RAW Arena. Meanwhile, RAW Chief Executive Tom Wood has hailed the qualities of the aggregation platform and argued that RAW Arena will help boost the overall level of innovation in the iGaming industry.</p>
<p>It’s all about providing players with unrivaled experience, Wood said. Content aggregation has played a key role in helping operators boost their offerings. While suppliers used to strike individual deals with operators, this tended to be too time-consuming and resource-heavy.</p>
<p>The emergence of innovative solutions such as RAW Arena and even Relax Gaming’s aggregation platform has contributed to a world where new and existing operators can quickly and reliably receive content from leading brands. In November, RAW continued on its journey to innovation by purchasing the full assets for Spigo from Lady Luck Games AB.</p>
