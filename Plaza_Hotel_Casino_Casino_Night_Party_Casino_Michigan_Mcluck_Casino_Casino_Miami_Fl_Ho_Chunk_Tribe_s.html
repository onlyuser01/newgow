    <h1>Plaza Hotel Casino Casino Night Party Casino Michigan Mcluck Casino Casino Miami Fl Ho Chunk Tribe s</h1>

<p>The federal government branch in the US that deals with the relationships between the government and Indian Tribes, the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), has announced that it approved Ho-Chunk Nation’s proposal for a gaming facility located in Beloit, Rock County, Wisconsin.</p>
<p>Bureau of Indian Affairs Approves Ho-Chunk Nation Casino Project</p>
<p>The recent approval puts an end to a process that has been ongoing for more than 20 years. It was back in 1999 when Beloit residents voted in favor of a proposal for a casino in the city. Then in 2012, the Ho-Chunk Nation submitted an application with the BIA seeking to acquire approximately 33 acres of land in the city of Beloit which can be used for gaming as well as other purposes. Thanks to the recent approval, now the Tribe can initiate the construction works for the planned casino project.</p>
<p>“Our community has eagerly awaited the groundbreaking for this high-quality complex that will provide an additional boost to our economy.” Lori Curtis Luther, Beloit City Manager</p>
<p>Lori Curtis Luther, Beloit City’s manager, revealed that the approval marks an important moment for the community that has been waiting for the launch of the project which will help boost the local economy. She added that the city will continue to collaborate with the Ho-Chuck Nation considering the start of the development of the entertainment project.</p>
<p>“The Nation, our partners, and this community have been anticipating this moment for years.” Karena Thundercloud, VP at Ho-Chunk Nation</p>
<p>Ho-Chunk Nation’s VP, Karena Thundercloud, revealed that the community, the Tribe and its partners have been patiently waiting for the approval of the project for years. She acknowledged that despite skepticism related to the timeframe of the project, the Ho-Chunk Nation remains confident that the new entertainment destination will bring benefits. In conclusion, Thundercloud outlined that Wisconsin, the city of Beloit and the Tribe will all benefit from the proposed project.</p>
<p>The Entertainment Resort Will Bring Benefits to Beloit City</p>
<p>The new project will use some 33 acres of land and its price tag is expected to surpass $400 million. The significant investment will help create some 3,000 temporary workplaces related to construction. Once completed, the project will include a hotel, casino, restaurants, beverage outlets, convention space, retail spaces, and entertainment spaces. Overall, the entertainment destination is expected to create 1,300 permanent workplaces.</p>
<p>What’s known so far is that the project would have a large casino floor, as well as a convention space and a 40,000-square-foot water park. The entertainment venue will also feature a hotel with 300 rooms. Besides creating new jobs for the region, the Tribe’s project will help boost local tourism as well.</p>
