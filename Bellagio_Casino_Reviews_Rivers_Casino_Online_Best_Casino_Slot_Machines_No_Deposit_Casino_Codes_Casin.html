    <h1>Bellagio Casino Reviews Rivers Casino Online Best Casino Slot Machines No Deposit Casino Codes Casin</h1>

<p>Hello, this is my first post. I’ve been a user of Yabby Casino for a couple months now. I used their free spins bonus last night and got up to $50 and went to cash out. But first, you have to send verification documents to them if you’re cashing out for the first time.</p>
<p>I sent them the documents they asked for, then I get an email hours later saying they’re sorry but they cannot find an active account linked to my email address, all communication with the casino must be done exclusively via a registered e-mail address. This doesn’t make sense, I’ve signed up with only one email and they send me emails almost every day. So I sent them additional pictures of my Yabby profile that shows my email address, and I sent a screenshot of their email to me with my email address. I’m waiting to hear back from them, if I ever do hear back from them. I know this casino has a high rating but I’m feeling discouraged now.</p>
