<p>A man who was related to the operation and ownership of illegal gambling business in Canton, Ohio, pleaded guilty to tax fraud conspiracy Wednesday.</p>
<p>Florida Man May Face Five-Year Prison Sentence</p>
<p>Details released by the Department of Justice (DOJ), point out that Larry Dayton, 46, pleaded guilty to conspiring to defraud the IRS. Citing statements and court documents, the DOJ pointed out that Dayton collaborated co-conspired with two other individuals: Rebecca Kachner and Jason Kachner. Joining forces, the trio used to own and operate Skilled Shamrock and Redemption, two illegal gambling businesses. Although Dayton pleaded guilty to tax fraud conspiracy, his sentencing hearing will be set for a later date.</p>
<p>According to the DOJ, between 2012 and 2017, Dayton failed to report more than $2 million in income from the two gambling operations. Additionally, the DOJ claims Dayton and his accomplices “created a false “purchase agreement” where he purported to sell the assets of the gambling business to a nominee owner’s entity.” Considering the charges he may face, the maximum penalty which may be issued is up to five years in prison. What’s more, Dayton may face monetary penalties, restitution as well as a supervised release period.</p>
<p>Multiple Agencies Collaborated during the Investigation of the Case</p>
<p>The investigation of the criminal case was the result of collaboration between the IRS-Criminal Investigation unit, the US Department of the Treasury, Office of the Inspector General and the Ohio Casino Control Commission. The DOJ pointed out that the Homeland Security Investigations unit also helped by providing “substantial assistance” in the investigation.</p>
<p>Currently, the case is prosecuted by Assistant US Attorneys Robert Patton and David Toepfer from the Northern District of Ohio, as well as Trial Attorneys Richard M. Rolwing and Sam Bean from the Tax Division.</p>
<p>Investigation against Illegal Gambling Continues, Three Other People Face Charges</p>
<p>Late last month, another man from Canton was charged in Cleveland, Ohio for his participation in an illegal gambling operation. Christos Karasarides Jr. was charged with five conspiracies to conduct illegal gambling, an attempt to defraud the IRS, as well as multiple counts of submitting false tax returns and tax evasion.</p>
<p>Allegedly, Karasarides conspired together with Jason and Rebecca Kachner and operated the illegal Canton-based gambling business, Skilled Shamrock. Earlier this month, the couple Jason and Rebecca Kachner pleaded guilty to participating in tax conspiracy, the DOJ revealed.</p>
