<p>Red Rock Resorts, a casino and hospitality company, published its Q2 report for the three months ended June 30.</p>
<p>The company reported a very slight year-on-year drop in net revenues from $422.2 million in Q2, 2022, to $416.1 million in Q2, 2023. Net income, on the other hand, skyrocketed by a whopping 130.9% to $74.9 million. For reference, the net income for Q2, 2022, was only $32.4 million.</p>
<p>Adjusted EBITDA for the period sat at $175.3 million in Q2, 2023, which translates to a 7.2% year-on-year decrease from last year’s $188.9 million.</p>
<p>Red Rock Resorts also published data concerning its performance in Las Vegas, highlighting $412.6 million in net revenues from its operations in the city. Although the figure represents a 1.8% drop, it shows that the company’s Vegas business still constitutes the majority of its revenues.</p>
<p>The operator’s adjusted EBITDA from its Las Vegas operations was $193.1 million for the second quarter of 2023. This is a 7.1% year-on-year decrease from the $207.8 million recorded in Q2, 2022.</p>
<p>In February, Red Rock Resorts also published its FY 2022 results, following its mixed Q4 report. Despite the headwinds, the full-year report was satisfactory. The company attributed its favorable results to its robust business model and adamant discipline.</p>
<p>Red Rock Pays Dividends to Stakeholders</p>
<p>Red Rock Resorts disclosed that its cash and cash equivalents on June 30, 2023, were $100.9 million. The company also reported that its total outstanding debt at the end of the second quarter was $3.2 billion.</p>
<p>In its announcement, the company said that its board of directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.25 per Class A common share for Q3, 2023. It will be payable on September 29 this year to all stockholders of record as of September 15.</p>
<p>Before the payment has taken place, Station Holdco will make a cash distribution to all unit holders of record (the company included) of $0.25 per unit. A total of $27.1 million will be distributed during the round, with around $15.6 million to be distributed to the company itself. The remaining money will be distributed to the other unit holders of record of Station Holdco.</p>
<p>On August 3, Red Rock Resorts hosted a conference call, discussing its financial results.</p>
