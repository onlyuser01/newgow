<p>SharpLink Gaming Ltd, a company specializing in data-driven user engagement and conversions for the US iGaming and sports betting market, has confirmed that it has been legalized to offer its services in 21 states and the District of Columbia. The company is also licensed and authorized to operate its business model in Ontario, Canada, giving a significant boost to the companyâ€™s North American reach.</p>
<p>SharpLink Gaming similarly says that it has already established an affiliate partnership with every significant and major betting and gaming company in the United States. Among the companies the brand works with are BetMGM, FanDuel, Tipico, WynnBet, Unibet, Caesars, DraftKings, and many others. Commenting on this launch, SharpLink CEO and Co-founder Rob Phythian said:</p>
<p>Pursuing authorization to legally operate in states that have approved online sports betting has been paramount to our Company achieving our ultimate aim of becoming the preferred gamification, conversion technology and online marketing partner to sports media operators, teams, leagues and sportsbooks in the United States and Canada.</p>
<p>SharpLink is set to reach 98% of the total legal sports betting market in North America, owing to its sports betting conversion technologies and affiliate marketing products and partnerships. The estimation is cited by SharpLink and is backed up by reporting from Legal Sports Report, a respected media publication.</p>
<p>SharpLink also has more plans in the pipeline. Commenting on the recently announced acquisition plans for SportsHub, Phytian said that his company would only stand to benefit from acquiring a brand that is known for its loyal fan base and thriving ecosystem of cash players. He added that there was enough studies to back the claim that fantasy sports fans who are based in a state with regulated gambling market are quickly making the switch.</p>
<p>According to the executive, SharpLink has everything it would need to seamlessly integrate a number of excellent sportsbook offers in all parts of the user experience, driving even better overall results for the company across the board. North America clearly remains the principal goal for SharpLink Gaming.</p>
<p>The company is also aware of the nature of betting in North America, making sure that it is focused on the mobile segment, which is the main driver of interest among sports fans who are turning to their handheld device to consume sports and place a wager as well. The company also has been making some changes in its executive lineup, most recently appointing Robert DeLucia as CFO.</p>
