    <h1>Miami Valley Casino Free Casino Casino Hotels In Albuquerque New Mexico Casino Roulette Game Goldie</h1>

<p>The World Series of Poker, and their main partner, GGPoker Network, have achieved another important milestone in their joint partnership – the launch of a dedicated poker card room available online in Ontario, Canada. Ontario, which legalized private gambling in April, and is home to 14.57m people, is touted as one of the biggest poker, gaming, and sports betting markets in North America.</p>
<p>It's also a former home to Daniel Negreanu, the poker professional and GGPoker ambassador, who is the richest Canadian player playing the game and the third most successful player in the game’s history in terms of all-time money ranking. Negreanu has certainly welcomed the news of the World Series of Poker opening a dedicated card room for Ontario players.</p>
<p>He reminisced about his own time growing up in Toronto and said that back in the day, he had to make difficult decisions and move away to the United States to play WSOP events and enjoy poker. This is no longer the case for anyone in Ontario, though.</p>
<p>WSOP.ca will make it possible for players to have a blast and enjoy themselves by participating in Ontario WSOP online events. The inaugural one is already running through October 16, and it has 12 WSOP rings on the line for players to pick. It also runs a guaranteed prize pool of CA$2.5m ($3.42m). Ty Stewart, WSOP’s Executive Director, was equally pleased to make this a reality.</p>
<p>He welcomed the opportunity for players in Canada to actually be a part of the WSOP family and be able to contest with some of the most capable players from around the world. WSOP.ca will serve as a place for local talent to grow and attend the land-based events in the United States, later on, Stewart said.</p>
<p>WSOP is hardly the only poker card room to have entered the market in the United States, though. The company is just the latest in fact, after PartyPoker, PokerStars, 888, and BetMGM, all of which have been offering an excellent poker products. Admittedly, though, few companies can quite measure up to WSOP.ca and the reputation it has for running some of the most generous events.</p>
<p>Negreanu welcomed the opportunity and encouraged local players in Ontario to give it their best and compete for WSOP bracelets. There is no need to relocate as he did 25 yearsbefore, Negreanu joked.</p>
