<p>After a whole month of competing, two teams have made the finals of the 2021 League of Legends World Championship and it is not at all surprising to see DWA KIA facing off with Edward Gaming during the finals on Saturday, November 6.</p>
<p>Both teams have been able to crush the opposition and they are heading into the final clash with a lot riding on DWA KIA as the shoo-in for the Grand Final. DWA KIA is posted at (-455) but we think the underdogs from Edward Gaming (+280).</p>
<p>Odds to Win LoL Worlds 2021 – Grand Final</p>
<p>Team Moneyline Edward Gaming +280 DWA KIA -455 *Odds on November 5 at Betway</p>
<p>DWG KIA Coming Strong after T1 Win</p>
<p>The odds are looking up for DWA KIA posted at (-455) which won the 2020 edition of the event and will be looking for a repeat of the previous title. The only team to have won a back-to-back Worlds Finals is SK Telecom T1 which secured the titles in 2015 and 2016.</p>
<p>Interestingly, T1 almost eliminated DWA KIA in the Worlds’ semi-finals, but the team managed to rally and make it all the way to the Grand Finals which will be played on Saturday.</p>
<p>To be fair, T1 had DWA KIA on the ropes, but the exceptional play demonstrated by Khan, ShowMaker, Ghost, Canyon, and Beryl rallied the team and allowed it to overcome their toughest opponent to date.</p>
<p>The game against T1 was quite the contentious one and it took five rounds to settle, but DWG KIA won. So, does this mean Edward Gaming has no chances of succeeding? Well, they were the underdogs in the LPL against FunPlus Phoenix, but we knew that the team had improved its play significantly, and securing a victory back then wasn’t at all surprising to us.</p>
<p>What Are the Odds for Edward Gaming?</p>
<p>So, why is Edward Gaming is posted at only (+285) in the coming game? The team went the distance with a number of teams, including Royal Never Give Up, defeating them in a contested 5-game series and did the same to Gen.G throughout the Worlds. The team also exchanged a win and a loss with T1 in the Group Stage and 100 Thieves.</p>
<p>Overall, Edward Gaming has been delivering on great performance across the board, but there seems to be a huge gap in what bookmakers see in the team’s performance and what they expect to happen when Edward tries to take on DWG.</p>
<p>The logic is probably that while Edward has the ability to perform well under pressure, they are not expected to be able to find a solution to ShowMaker who has been carrying DWG KIA through most of the event with the support of his teammates. Both teams know how to hold themselves in clutch moments, though, we see DWG KIA having fewer such moments to worry about this year.</p>
<p>The oddsmakers even predict that the game will be solved in fewer than 4.5 games, meaning that the series won’t go the full distance. However, we see this Grand Final going the distance and will bet on Edward Gaming as they already proved themselves once during the LPL and have posted near-perfect performance throughout the entire month of the Worlds.</p>
<p>Posted at an exceptional value of (+280) we are calling Edward Gaming the winners here and predict that T1’s back-to-back Worlds record will be safe for at least another year.</p>
