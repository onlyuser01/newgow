<p>Twenty of Carnival Corporation’s ships already employ the GOS, allowing them to offer progressive jackpots to their clients</p>
<p>Galaxy Gaming, аn omnichannel table games expert delivering innovative games and technologies, has agreed to supply its Galaxy Operating System (GOS) to the Carnival Corporation, a British-American cruise operator. Under the deal, Galaxy Gaming’s table games system will be rolled out across more than 50 of the leisure company’s ships.</p>
<p>Twenty of Carnival Corporation’s ships already employ the GOS, allowing them to offer progressive jackpots to their clients. This includes the Carnival Cruise Line, Holland America Line and Princess Cruises ships.</p>
<p>GOS is Galaxy Gaming’s proprietary next-gen state-of-the-art game management system. Originally launched this year, the system offers multiple unparalleled progressive jackpot options, LED sensors and unprecedented digital tracking.</p>
<p>Carnival Corporation Will Step Up Its Game</p>
<p>The two companies expressed their excitement to join forces through representatives who released statements on the agreement. Carnival Corporation’s senior vice president of global casino operations, Marty Goldman, explained that his team’s goal is to engage customers by providing them with “extraordinary cruise vacations.”</p>
<p>To that end, the Galaxy Operating System will help us create a table game experience that is second to none, ramping up the fun, excitement and rewards more than ever before. Marty Goldman, senior vice president of global casino operations, Carnival Corporation</p>
<p>Goldman added that he expects the new table games to instantly resonate with Carnival Corporation’s guests.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Todd Cravens, Galaxy Gaming’s president and chief executive officer, praised Carnival Corporation as a global leader in the provision of premium cruise experiences for guests. The continued collaboration between the cruise operator and Galaxy Gaming also attests to the two companies’ shared focus, Cravens believes.</p>
<p>We’re thrilled that the deployment of our GOS system will deliver the best-in-class progressive experience and world-famous content to their [Carnival Corporation’s] casino players fleet-wide. Todd Cravens, president &amp; CEO, Galaxy Gaming</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Galaxy Gaming formed a partnership with Konquer, an industry newcomer founded by former DraftKings employees Ashford Kneitel and Aditya Singh. Under the deal, the former company supplied cutting-edge titles to the operator, helping it jumpstart its business.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Galaxy Gaming aligned itself with Spirit Gaming to deliver progressive blackjack to German audiences. Thanks to that, Spielbank Hannover visitors now have the opportunity to enjoy progressive blackjack on-site, marking the first time players in Germany have been able to play such a game.</p>
