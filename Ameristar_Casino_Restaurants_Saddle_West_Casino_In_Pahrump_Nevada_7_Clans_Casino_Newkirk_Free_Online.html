    <h1>Ameristar Casino Restaurants Saddle West Casino In Pahrump Nevada 7 Clans Casino Newkirk Free Online</h1>

<p>Neccton, one of the leading Responsible gambling (RG) and Anti-Money Laundering software solution providers, has teamed up with Intouch Games, one of the leading iGaming operators of popular brands such as mFortune, Mr Spin, and Jammy Monkey in the United Kingdom, Casino Guru News learned via an email press release.</p>
<p>As a result, Intouch Games will have access to Neccton’s advanced products which will ensure that consumers and players that use the company’s products are better protected. Essentially, the Skywind Group-owned company is tapping into Neccton’s acclaimed mentor solution, which offers real-time data analysis powered by AI.</p>
<p>This solution allows operators and brands to track erratic gambling behaviors and ensures that both players and operators can flag and spot potential issues in a prompt fashion. Mentor is trained to recognize important changes in customer behavior, such as a rapid increase in spending or depositing frequency.</p>
<p>Operators will get such customers flagged so they can contact them directly and see if they can help said players make better-informed decisions, or whether those players are indeed overspending. This comes in the context of the UK Government’s White Paper, which has proposed tighter spending limits on online gambling and specific age groups.</p>
<p>However, Intouch Games is not waiting and is taking matters into its own hands, enhancing its player protection solutions with a world-leading company that has an established track record. Mentor is great as it similarly helps companies to also add several modules, that include aCRM, AML and Fraud, making it a very powerful solution.</p>
<p>Neccton is a very powerful solution indeed. It’s based on the seminal work of Dr Michael Auer who spent the last 15 years doing academic research to garner better insight into responsible gambling and player behavior. His insight has been seminal in ensuring that a powerful AI solution can indeed prove helpful to vulnerable players and gamers.</p>
<p>Commenting on this new tie-up with Intouch Games, Dr Auer himself noted that the company was proud to see the company’s famous brands join the Neccton and mentor families.</p>
<p>"Working with us means they are ahead of the curve with player protection, and what operator would not want that? We are looking forward to a great partnership with Intouch Games – and even more UK players protected with our software," he concluded.</p>
<p>Intouch Games Director Hilary Stewart-Jones was similarly pleased to see mentor now strengthen the company’s own efforts to provide consumers with the best and safest experience.</p>
