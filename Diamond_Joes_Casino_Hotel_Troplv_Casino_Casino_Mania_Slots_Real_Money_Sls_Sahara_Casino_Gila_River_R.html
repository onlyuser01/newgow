    <h1>Diamond Joes Casino Hotel Troplv Casino Casino Mania Slots Real Money Sls Sahara Casino Gila River R</h1>

<p>Play n go shines again with a new slot. Apparently it is important to bring a lot of new slots onto the market - regardless of whether it is pointless or not. Quality is sinking here.</p>
<p>About the slot itself - you have to say there are very few book games or book-like games at Play n go</p>
<p>Book of dead</p>
<p>Legacy of Dead</p>
<p>Rise of Merlin</p>
<p>Cat Wilde Doom of dead</p>
<p>Lord Merlin</p>
<p>Doom of Egypt</p>
<p>Rich wild amulet of dead-this game being the absolute crowning glory of bullshit or lack of imagination.</p>
<p>Basically a mixture of Cat Wilde Doom of dead and Book of dead! only that full wilds can come in the middle reels 2-4. If you HAVE 1, then the win is times 2, with 2 it is times 3 and with 3 it is just 5. But the winnings are much lower, as with Doom of Dead, because wilds often come.</p>
<p>The problem itself is but what use are the wilds if there are no amulets (scatters) that you need for the free game. Rarely get as few chances as in this game.</p>
<p>Although I have to say that I think the whole play n go book series is pretty bad.</p>
<p>From my point of view there is a book game which is far better</p>
<blockquote>
<p>torros gold</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I got free spins with a stake of 20 cents. The letter A came and I had a full picture - and for that I got 100 euros - at Book of Dead you get 30 euros for it. So everyone can picture for themselves where it is better</p>
