    <h1>Casinos In Kc Sunrise Slots Casino Casinos Massachusetts Plaza Hotel Casino North Main Street Las Ve</h1>

<p>Hello. I want to file a complaint about the opacity of the casino rules. I made several deposits without a bonus in this casino and won about 21 thousand rubles on bets. Then I got a cashback of 600 rubles. I started betting and my balance dropped below the cashback amount (about 16 thousand), which means the bonus was lost, because. it is essentially not tied to a deposit (in a normal casino). Then I won 9 thousand in slots and the balance became 25 thousand. BUT, it turned out that according to the rules of the casino, their cashback is wagered with REAL money and at the end of wagering, 12 thousand were written off from my balance and only 13 thousand were left, because. maxwin from the bonus is only x10 of its amount and ALL winnings go to the bonus amount. Yes, yes, bets are made with real money, and winnings go to the bonus, despite the fact that this is not a deposit bonus. It turns out that for the sake of wagering 600 bonus rubles, I lost 8 thousand real ones.</p>
<p>I have not encountered this in any casino and am very disappointed that at first glance a good casino deceives its players in this way. If itâ€™s not possible to return my winnings, or at least the balance by the time I accepted this ill-fated cashback, then I ask you to at least mark the fact that the bonus rules are opaque so that other players do not make my mistake.</p>
