<p>A free-to-play sports betting app with cash prizes and rewards program from Caesars Entertainment was launched today by daily fantasy sport (DFS) platform SuperDraft.</p>
<p>“We are thrilled that SuperDraft has developed yet another way for players to experience Caesars Rewards.” Eric Hession, Co-President, Sports &amp; Online Gaming, Caesars Entertainment</p>
<p>Sports Betting without Financial Risk</p>
<p>The SuperDraft Free SportsBook App is a product of the collaboration between the fantasy operator and Caesars as both parties signed a strategic partnership deal in January. Under the terms of the deal, Caesars Entertainment acquired a minority stake in the DFS operator.</p>
<p>“SuperDraft’s Free SportsBook is an exciting part of our best-in-class mobile and online ecosystem. Our connected palette of mobile and online apps allows Caesars Rewards members to play across our digital offerings and earn Reward Credits which can be used at all of the Caesars’ destinations and online properties.” Eric Hession, Co-President, Sports &amp; Online Gaming, Caesars Entertainment</p>
<p>The SuperDraft Free SportsBook aims at creating new ways to engage with casual sport fans by offering them a chance to utilize their knowledge in sports and win cash prizes, and thus complement SuperDraft’s fan-friendly DFS offering.</p>
<p>In addition, the app is looking to provide fun for sports fans while competing against their friends and among themselves and leverage social gaming experience by letting them make big bets on their favorite sports with no financial risk.</p>
<p>“Sports betting is exploding across the country, and fans are crying out for a better way to use their hard-earned sports IQ to cash in. We’re giving them something even better –– a way to win without spending a dime.” Steve Wang, CEO &amp; Founder, SuperDraft</p>
<p>Exciting Prize Pool</p>
<p>Cash, gift cards, consumer electronic gadgets, tickets for sports and concert events, as well as experiences from Caesars Rewards are part of the prize pool for the free-to-play app.</p>
<p>“The SuperDraft Free SportsBook is unlike anything fans have ever seen. We can’t wait to reward players with exclusive Caesars experiences and big-ticket prizes.” Steve Wang, CEO &amp; Founder, SuperDraft</p>
<p>The SuperDraft Free SportsBook, developed by Nate Hunter, chief technology officer at SuperDraft, in partnership with Sportnco, will offer free-to-play sports betting on all major leagues in the US and some global markets, by utilizing straight and parlay bets, round-robin and live in-game bets, with daily, weekly and monthly leaderboards displaying who is eligible for a prize by the end of the period.</p>
<p>A social gaming currency, SuperCoin, is used in the app as a token currency to place bets and to redeem prizes from the in-app store, besides the Caesars Rewards credits players can use for vacation packages and other experiences across Caesars properties.</p>
