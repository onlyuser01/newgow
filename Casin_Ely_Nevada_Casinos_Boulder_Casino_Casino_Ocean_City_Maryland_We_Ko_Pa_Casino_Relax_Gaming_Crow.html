<p>At the beginning of December 2022, the iGaming aggregator and supplier of unique content announced the fifth Dream Drop Mega Jackpot winner in the person of a Dutch player who scooped up a €1,886,174.63 ($1.990.951,63) prize via the Kansino brand. Now, the provider of over 4,000 online casino games has announced the sixth winner of a similarly massive progressive jackpot.</p>
<p>The €2 Bet That Unlocked the Latest Jackpot</p>
<p>The lucky player chose to engage in the exciting Temple Tumble 2 Dream Drop slot by Relax Gaming that was released on May 4, 2022, using White Hat Gaming’s platform. The sequel to the popular original game was actually the pioneer title that was introduced to Relax Gaming’s roster of progressive jackpot games featuring the much-anticipated Dream Drop jackpot game mechanic. The latter was introduced to the public in March 2022.</p>
<p>It only took a small €2 ($2.88) bet for the lucky gambler to quickly turn into the winner of the life-changing seven-figure jackpot. The latest win once again proves the rewarding potential of the brand’s premium portfolio of games that have already generated five other seven-figure jackpot winners on a Relax Gaming jackpot game.</p>
<p>“Exciting” to See Players Win Life-Changing Amounts</p>
<p>White Hat Gaming’s head of gaming Mike Dearling spoke about the player who chose their platform to play the winning Temple Tumble 2 game, saying it was “exciting” to be able to witness their own players win large amounts of money with the potential of changing destinies.</p>
<p>Dearing also expressed their delight that the massive win resulted from a popular game part of Relax Gaming’s library. He took the opportunity to describe the brand as one that keeps innovating its offerings in a way that fully resonates with players.</p>
<p>At the start of the year, White Hat Gaming announced its launch in the state of Pennsylvania as a means of expanding its foothold in the US.</p>
<p>At the same time, Relax Gaming’s chief executive officer Simon Hammon explained that the main purpose behind the creation of the exciting jackpot mechanic was to generate a mechanism that would “pay out more frequently than any other competing product on the market”.</p>
<p>Hammon also spoke about the upcoming fresh Dream Drop Jackpot games that will be released in the upcoming months while expressing excitement to watch the winning momentum keep going.</p>
<p>How Does the Dream Drop Jackpots Mechanic Work?</p>
<p>Relax Gaming’s innovative game mechanic features a progressive jackpot that is engaged whenever players land six Dream Drop symbols during a jackpot entry spin that is triggered randomly.</p>
<p>The studio’s slots that encompass this special feature are unique in the sense that they allow players to enjoy familiar types of progressive jackpots while the Must Drop mechanic lets them see in real-time just how close they are to winning a mouth-watering jackpot.</p>
<p>There are a total of five different intertwined progressive jackpots part of Dream Drop slots. Rapid, Mini, and Maxi jackpots act as normal progressive jackpots. Major and Mega jackpots feature individual must-win levels. The starting value of the Mega Jackpot begins at €500,000 ($531.380) and it goes all the way up to €10,000,000($1.062.902).</p>
