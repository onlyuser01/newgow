    <h1>Casino Albuquerque Riverbend Casino Osceola Casino Houston Casino Graton Casino Resort Pariplay Plan</h1>

<p>Continuing its global expansion, the leading aggregator joined forces with Bet Network to propel its expansion across South Africa</p>
<p>NeoGames subsidiary and leading content provider and aggregator, Pariplay, continues to expand its global footprint after announcing a new important partnership. The company unveiled Thursday it joined forces with Bet Network, paving the way for its expansion in the regulated gambling market in South Africa.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the new agreement, Pariplay will leverage Bet Network’s presence and knowledge within the market. The collaboration will see the leading aggregator utilize Bet Network’s National Manufacturing License to deliver its games within the regulated market in the country. Such titles would include games from Pariplay’s Wizard Games studio, along with third-party titles delivered via Ignite.</p>
<p>The Western Cape Gambling and Racing Board will initially certify Pariplay’s products for the region. Additionally, the aggregator confirmed it will consider further expansion in South Africa soon.</p>
<p>Iain Gutteridge, Bet Network’s managing director, was thrilled to see the company team up with Pariplay. He explained that the aggregator delivers an extensive range of games that are already popular with fans across the globe.</p>
<p>Moreover, Gutteridge predicted that Pariplay’s content would be well-received by the local players, allowing the company to expand its reach rapidly. “By working closely together, we’ll be able to greatly expand its reach in South Africa, and we’re very excited by the potential of this partnership,” he said in conclusion.</p>
<p>“Pariplay brings an unmatched level of aggregated and in-house content that is beloved by players the world over, and we’re confident that by bringing it across South Africa we can quickly establish it as a must-have portfolio for operators.“ Iain Gutteridge, managing director of Bet Network</p>
<p>The Leading Aggregator Continues to Expand</p>
<p>The latest collaboration complements Pariplay’s growth trajectory. Last month, the aggregator further expanded its presence by adding games from the up-and-coming iGaming provider, Boldplay, to its Fusion platform. That collaboration enabled the iGaming content supplier to reach new customers across the globe.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, seeking expansion into Latin America, Pariplay joined forces with Eyas Games back in July. Teaming up with the prominent operator for the region further expanded the aggregator’s global footprint.</p>
<p>“South Africa is a market with enormous potential, and we’re delighted to partner with Bet Network to ensure we can maximize our reach in the country through their local insight and knowledge.“ Andrew Maclean, VP of sales at Pariplay</p>
<p>Andrew Maclean, Pariplay’s VP of sales, acknowledged the importance of the South African market for the company. Highlighting the incredible opportunities that the market holds, he said that Pariplay is excited to join forces with Bet Network.</p>
<p>Maclean explained that Pariplay’s content is well-received across different markets around the globe. Finally, he predicted that the collaboration would bring thrilling experiences for players in South Africa.</p>
