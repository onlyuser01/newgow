    <h1>Casino Siteleri Maryland Live Casino And Hotel The Linq Hotel And Casino Directions To Hard Rock Cas</h1>

<p>Hello, I have a big problem with Parimatch and I don't know what to do anymore. I've been playing for about a year on global.parimatch.com/ and for a month, now when I try to access the site it says "Sorry, we are not available in your country/region right now' (I am from Poland). I had to use a VPN to access the site, I then chatted to a Parimatch employee and got the response</p>
<p>"Being number 1 global gaming platform,Parimatch is continuously developing and improving the quality of its customer experience across 4 continents. Our willingness to grow and develop has taught us never settle for less than the best. As we want to deliver the authentic solution that perfectly suits Global brand,Parimatch needs a little bit more time to enhance its localization strategy and come back with the best version.</p>
<p>I asked what exactly it means because I don't understand and if the site will start working normally, I got the answer: At the moment it's difficult to predict the exact dates. We do our best to get back to you.</p>
<p>I have photos of these chat conversations as proof. It's been a month, the global Parimatch site is still down, so I can't log in and withdraw my funds. What should I do, or should I just wait? I have written 2 emails to you and have not received any reply.</p>
<p>When I wrote the third e-mail, they replied only to give my id number (seriously this is help??) I just want the parimatch website to start working in Poland, or to write specifically what is happening that the site has been down for over a month.</p>
<p>It looks as if no one wants to help me and it is unknown why the site for Poland suddenly stopped working without the possibility of withdrawing money</p>
