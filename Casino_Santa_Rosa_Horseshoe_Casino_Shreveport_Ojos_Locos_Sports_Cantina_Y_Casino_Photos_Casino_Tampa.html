<p>The National Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG) is seeking to help vulnerable communities and help equip them better against the dangers of problem gambling</p>
<p>A new program launched by the NCPG is now focusing entirely on Hispanic youths in the hopes of educating them about the pitfalls of gambling and the dangers of excessive gambling in Cleveland, Ohio.</p>
<p>NCPG Keen on Helping Vulnerable Groups to Beat Problem Gambling</p>
<p>The intuitive has been launched with the Hispanic Urban Minority Alcoholism and Drug Abuse Outreach Program which was awarded $40,000 to help better educate the target group about the dangers of problem gambling.</p>
<p>The program will seek to educate 100 Hispanic students in middle and high school as part of comprehensive prevention efforts about gambling disorders. The program explained stated its goal thus:</p>
<p>The program aims to raise awareness to the dangers of at risk and problem-gambling behaviors with Middle and High School youth, these youth can then relate this to their peers and their families via 1-1 conversations, social media, print, posters, and other created media. Hispanic Urban Minority Alcoholism and Drug Abuse Outreach Program</p>
<p>To have maximum impact, the program will operate as a bilingual initiative that will allow it to better connect with the target groups. The program is an important stepping stone in addressing problem gambling and gambling-related harm in Ohio. The state sees that 15% of Hispanic males aged 18-24 are at risk of developing a gambling disorder.</p>
<p>Addressing problem gambling with minorities has been a priority for many organizations engaged with furthering the understanding and advocating for safe and responsible gambling practices.</p>
<p>In places such as the United Kingdom, there has been research indicating that minorities tend to suffer from gambling disproportionately even though they make up a much smaller part of the people who participate in gambling as a whole.</p>
<p>The NCPG has been very active across different communities and is determined to bring the best possible campaigns and awareness initiatives to geographies and communities that may be impacted by various gambling-related problems.</p>
