<p>I only think the biggest issue of loss and deposit limits is the simple fact that when you reach the limit, you can go to another casino and nobody will ask about the limit you reached in the previous casino. Otherwise, setting the limits is a great and simple thing you can do to protect yourself.</p>
<p>I worked in a casino so I noticed how people play and make deposits. Many people can control themselves, but they sometimes reach a point when they feel some injustice or they feel like the moment of the great winnings is coming so they start depositing more and more until they have nothing to deposit. They lose the control for 1 gambling session, but it costs them a fortune. Those people often come the next day and claim that someone hacked their account etc.</p>
<p>Deposit limits would easily protect you against this and even when players feel they can control themselves, they should set the limits. Loss limits can be very helpful in a case when you're lucky and you win some nice amount of money. When it happens, many people tend to start betting higher bets and try to win more which only results in a quick loss. Loss limits can protect you from losing you winnings.</p>
<p>I'd also like to highlight that unfortunately there are enormous differences in how those limits work in different casinos so it's always important to read the terms and conditions or ask the customer support. It happened many times that a player thought that the limit would protect them, but it didn't, because it behaved differently than the player expected. Fortunately, we have a team of testers in CasinoGuru and they're already reviewing how those responsible gambling tools work in different casinos so we should have some data about it in the future as well.</p>
