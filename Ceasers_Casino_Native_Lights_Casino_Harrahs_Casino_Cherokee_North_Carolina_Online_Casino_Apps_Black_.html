<p>Provider of social casino games SciPlay doubled down on efforts to promote its free-to-play mobile game, Quick Hit Slots, by launching an advertising campaign featuring Jerry O’Connell.</p>
<p>Build upon Momentum</p>
<p>The launch of the “Winning Day” campaign featuring the popular actor and television host as a spokesperson is looking to build upon the momentum of one of the fastest-growing social casino slot games in 2022.</p>
<p>Commenting on the new arrangement, O’Connell stated that with all his life’s work dedicated to entertainment, the collaboration with SciPlay was “a natural extension” of his “passion for sparking excitement and fun,” making him happy to participate in the commercials that bring to life the Vegas experience and Quick Slot Hits.</p>
<p>“It has been a real pleasure working with SciPlay and I can’t wait to see how the campaign resonates with their players,” O’Connell concluded.</p>
<p>By featuring O’Connell walking through a bright and vibrant Quick Slot Games-branded Vegas Strip, the short advertising spots are showing the audience that they can easily replicate the fun and excitement of authentic Vegas slot games right on their phones for free.</p>
<p>“The success of our recent campaigns with Sofía Vergara, the Wendy Williams Show and NASCAR’s Kaulig Racing team have made strategic partnerships a key part of SciPlay’s continued growth,” said chief revenue officer at Sci Play, Noga Halperin, highlighting O’Connell as a “beloved” and “famous” actor whose fans are naturally aligned with SciPlay players.</p>
<p>Halperin also expressed his excitement at the opportunity to work with O’Connell and bring to life the Vegas experience of Quick Slot Games, convinced that “his familiar face and passion for entertainment” will engage with the audiences throughout the campaign.</p>
<p>Let Growth Rain</p>
<p>The campaign was created in collaboration with Rain the Growth Agency which led media planning and strategy, as well as creative strategy, production and ongoing analytics support. SciPlay chose to collaborate with the agency due to its expertise in using data to develop integrated campaigns.</p>
<p>It was Rain the Growth Agency’s data-driven approach that analyzed customer sentiment for a comprehensive list of celebrities to pinpoint the ideal spokesperson for the target audience of the “Winning Day” campaign.</p>
<p>“Partnering with an industry leader that also values data-driven strategies enabled us to deliver a strong audience-first campaign that will drive app downloads and elevate the SciPlay brand,” commented Sue Collins, chief client officer at Rain the Growth Agency.</p>
<p>Available on the Apple App Store, Google Play and Amazon App Store, Quick Slot Games features popular Vegas slots, including Zeus Slots, Dragon Spin, 777 slots, Monopoly Slots, Fireball Slot Machines, Lock it Link, Cash Spin Slots, Quick Hit Platinum slot machine, and others.</p>
<p>To entice new players, SciPlay is offering them a welcome bonus of six million playing coins during the “Winning Day” campaign which started on January 23 and will run through February 12, airing on national TV networks, cable and OTT.</p>
