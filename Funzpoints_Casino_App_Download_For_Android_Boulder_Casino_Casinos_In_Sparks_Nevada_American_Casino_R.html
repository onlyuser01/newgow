    <h1>Funzpoints Casino App Download For Android Boulder Casino Casinos In Sparks Nevada American Casino R</h1>

<p>I initiated a withdrawal of 600 euros on the 5th of October, 2024, and I'm still waiting. I've spoken with my bank from which I made the withdrawal via Iban, and they informed me the issue isn't with them but rather the casino. They advised me to request a PDF receipt of the transfer the casino made, but the casino has provided me with nothing. When looking at the casino's withdrawals, the amount shows as 'in progress' but nothing has happened yet. While I've conversed many times with the N1 live chat, I feel like I'm getting the run-around. Each person tells me something different: one says just to be patient, another says the problem will be resolved immediately. As a long-time player, I can't understand this delay, especially since the betting site is based in my own country.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, they've informed me that they've escalated my issue to the appropriate department and that I would be updated via email, but that hasn't happened as of today.</p>
<p>Lastly, they sent me an email saying I wagered more than 5 euros, which isn't possible as I don't play with such high amounts.</p>
