<p>Flutter Entertainment-owned global gambling company, Paddy Power, strengthened its leadership team by selecting Francesco Borsetti as its sportsbook director.</p>
<p>Flutter Names Francesco Borsetti Paddy Power Sportsbook Director</p>
<p>Overall, Borsetti has nearly a decade of experience within the betting and gaming industry as a part of Flutter. He has a Bachelor’s degree in Marketing Phycology from the Sapienza Università di Roma. In 2012 he earned his Master’s degree in Political Science, Government and Communications from Luiss Guido Carli University. Besides a Master’s degree, Borsetti has a Master of Business Administration (MBA) from LUISS Business School.</p>
<p>Back in October 2013, Borsetti started his career with Paddy Power. In his interim position as Product and Operations Manager, he was responsible for research, analysis of operations and interviews. After that, in February 2014 Borsetti was promoted to lead commercial analyst. In that position, he was in charge of multi-million eGaming acquisition budgets.</p>
<p>For nearly 2.5 years until June 2018, Borsetti held the position of brand marketing and customer acquisition director for TVG and Betfair US, formerly known as Paddy Power Betfair USA. In that position, he was in charge of customer acquisition, TVG and Betfair’s advertising strategy. What’s more, he was responsible for a million-dollar marketing budget.</p>
<p>In July 2018, Borsetti was appointed as gaming director at Betfair. Despite years of decline, thanks to his leadership, in 2021 a double-digit growth was observed in customer acquisition, as well as volume and net revenues. Moreover, Borsetti spearheaded several major content deals and market launches.</p>
<p>Borsetti Shares His Excitement</p>
<p>In a recent statement released via LinkedIn, Borsetti acknowledged that a few weeks ago he started his position as sportsbook director at Paddy Power. He pointed out that he is proud to witness the transformation of Betfair Gaming in the last years. Additionally, Borsetti said that he is grateful for the new opportunity.</p>
<p>“Some weeks ago I started a new role as Sportsbook Director for Paddy Power Online. I am proud of the years of transformation in Betfair Gaming. And grateful and excited for the next opportunity in Flutter Entertainment Plc onwards.” Francesco Borsetti, sportsbook director at Paddy Power</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Flutter confirmed the leave of Victor Corcoran, Paddy Power’s chief executive officer. The announcement came amid senior leadership changes announced by the company. With the changes, Flutter sought to improve the effectiveness of its leadership teams for Ireland and Britain. Replacing Corcoran, the company picked Dave Newton to serve as its CEO. Besides being CEO, Newton will also lead Paddy Power as its online and retail brand chief commercial officer.</p>
