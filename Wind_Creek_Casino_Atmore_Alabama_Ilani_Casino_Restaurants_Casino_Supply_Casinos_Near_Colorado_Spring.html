    <h1>Wind Creek Casino Atmore Alabama Ilani Casino Restaurants Casino Supply Casinos Near Colorado Spring</h1>

<p>The leading global sports betting supplier will power the launch of the ‘Lance! Betting’ sportsbook, leveraging its substantial industry experience</p>
<p>This collaboration marks a significant milestone for both companies, combining Kambi Group’s expertise in providing cutting-edge sports betting solutions with Eyas Gaming’s vision for a dynamic and immersive wagering experience. The move significantly strengthens Kambi’s position in the Latin American market, aiding the company’s ambitious expansion strategy.</p>
<p>The New Sportsbook Unites Industry Leaders</p>
<p>Powering ‘Lance! Betting’ will see Kambi join some of Brazil’s leading sports companies. ‘Lance!’ is the country’s premier football media outlet, sporting over 15 million active monthly users. These impressive viewership numbers should give the company’s sportsbook project a significant head start, capitalizing on existing users willing to immerse themselves in their favorite sport.</p>
<p>Industry conglomerate Gauselmann Group also joined the project, leveraging its decades of experience in the entertainment industry to ensure the new sportsbook has a successful and memorable launch. Eyas Gaming CEO Adam Joseph noted that Kambi’s inclusion would help Lance! Betting realizes its full potential and secures a leading position in the competitive Brazilian sportsbook market.</p>
<p>Kambi’s track record in Latin America and proven suite of high-performance technology made partnering with them a natural choice. Adam Joseph, Eyas Gaming CEO</p>
<p>The launch of the ‘Lance! Betting’ sportsbook represents a commitment to driving innovation and enhancing the user experience in the sports betting realm. Kambi Group’s advanced technology, extensive industry knowledge, and Eyas Gaming’s passion for creating an immersive platform will contribute to an innovative and customer-focused betting environment.</p>
<p>Kambi Remains Ahead of the Competition</p>
<p>Collaborating with Eyas Gaming demonstrates Kambi’s commitment to expanding its market presence and working with innovative partners to deliver top-notch betting solutions. The developer’s growth-oriented strategy contributed to impressive Q1 2023 results, as new partnerships positioned it for sustained momentum. Kambi’s commitment to innovation, quality, and delivering an exceptional betting product proved paramount for remaining ahead of the competition.</p>
<p>While Kambi maintains its focus on the Latin American market, as demonstrated by its recent collaboration with Colombian operator Corredor Empresarial, the developer maintains a worldwide presence. Its state-of-the-art sports betting technology has proven its merits across diverse jurisdictions, setting the stage for sustained growth.</p>
<p>This agreement further bolsters Kambi’s impressive range of partners throughout Brazil and Latin America. Kristian Nylén, Kambi CEO and co-founder</p>
<p>The upcoming launch of the ‘Lance! Betting’ sportsbook marks another opportunity to showcase Kambi’s industry-leading technology. The deal will bolster the developer’s Brazilian footprint and brand recognition, helping it secure future collaborations. As the partnership unfolds, the industry will closely monitor the impact of the ‘Lance! Betting’ sportsbook and how it elevates the sports betting experience</p>
