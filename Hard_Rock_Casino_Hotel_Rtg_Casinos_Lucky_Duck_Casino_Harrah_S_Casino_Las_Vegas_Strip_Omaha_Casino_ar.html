    <h1>Hard Rock Casino Hotel Rtg Casinos Lucky Duck Casino Harrah S Casino Las Vegas Strip Omaha Casino ar</h1>

<p>Hi there! I was looking for a good resource where I would be able to open a complaint and found out that you represent the interests of the Arcanebet casino and it has not a bad rating here. Besides this, I read a positive feedback about you so I rely on you that you will be able to help me with that.</p>
<p>An accident takes place on June,5 2020 where I was able to claim 2nd welcome bonus 50% up to 200 euros. I triggered a win of 571 euros playing a Secret Admirer game with 4.5 euros bet and after that I decided to try my luck with another games Scudamore's Super Stakes playing it with 5 euros bet. I decided to switch a game because I was pretty sure that after a first win on Secret Admirer I will loose my bonus at all because the slot was to "hot" at the moment to continue playing it. I finished my wagering requirements playing with Scudamore's Super Stakes on the amount 1898,5 euros. Yes, it was really a good luck for me.</p>
<p>After that the casino requested the documents from me including a selfie holding me a passport or ID. I provided the casino with all the documents and a few days later I got a message from a customer support agent (Simon) with the text that I have violated their bonus terms and conditions, namely the points (I will provide a screenshot of this message with a full text):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Increasing your balance with one pattern and then significantly changing that pattern to complete wagering requirements;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Betting with high variance, whereby you claim a promotional offer and place large bets on volatile outcomes, before switching to regular variance outcomes with lower volatility to clear wagering requirements.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>After that I did not get any explanation from the casino why they confiscated my winnings because there were no any explanation of such the rules on their website. I did not change my playing pattern significantly and there were no any statements how to identify which game belongs to higg varience outcomes or low varience outcomes. I expect you will be able to help me my winnings to be back.</p>
<p>Thank you very much!</p>
