<p>The leading provider of content for the iGaming industry, Pragmatic Play, announced a new partnership with Sportbet, a popular Italian-facing operator. Announced Wednesday, the new collaboration saw Sportbet become a partner of Pragmatic Play and benefit from its leading live casino games.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the collaboration, Pragmatic Play agreed to provide its live casino titles for Sportbet customers in Italy. This new deal expanded significantly Sportbet's offering by delivering new live casino games that are proven hits. As a result, the operator will benefit from titles that are proven to increase fan engagement, as well as revenue. Such games include Pragmatic Play's Mega Wheel, Boom City and Sweet Bonanza CandyLand, all of which, are significantly popular.</p>
<p>Besides live casino games, the new deal will deliver more traditional titles from Pragmatic Play, such as PowerUP Roulette. This will further complement Sportbet's offering and deliver new and exciting games for its growing customer base.</p>
<p>While the new deal expands Sportbet's offering, it also boosts the growth of Pragmatic Play. In fact, the collaboration expands the company's presence not only in Italy but in Europe as well.</p>
<p>In a statement released on December 21, 2022, Sportbet's Casino Manager, Alessandro Palumbo, said that the company is delighted to join forces with Pragmatic Play and deliver live games for its growing customer base.</p>
<p>He added: "The company's reputation and leading products are known by operators all across the globe, and we are thrilled to be able to offer a collection of its prominent experiences to our Italian customer base."</p>
<p>On the other hand, Irina Cornides, Pragmatic Play's Chief Operating Officer, acknowledged that the company is also excited to team up with Sportbet. "We're delighted to announce the addition of another up-and-coming business to our operator network, with Sportbet reinforcing our growing presence in the Italian market," she said.</p>
<p>Finally, Cornides pointed out: "Europe is well established as a key region in our growth strategy, and we look forward to providing Sportbet with some of the best Live Casino content on the market."</p>
<p>Recently, Pragmatic Play has seen rapid growth. Last week, the company expanded into the Swiss market via a new partnership with Grand Casino Luzern and its online brand, mycasino. Before that, Pragmatic Play expanded its global footprint by signing a deal within the Latin American market. The company forged a new deal with Liderendeportes.bet, a leading operator for the market in Venezuela.</p>
