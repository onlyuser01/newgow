<p>International iGaming studio Kalamba Games has reinforced its team with the appointment of Elliot Scales. The latter will serve as a senior account manager and will manage the company’s quick growth.</p>
<p>Scales Has Worked for Some of the Leaders in iGaming</p>
<p>Scales is a seasoned gaming industry veteran who has worked for some of the most esteemed brands in the sector. He opened his career with a four-year tenure at the Swedish operator LeoVegas. He joined the company in 2016 and served as its UK outbound retention agent. In this position, Scales was in charge of the whole UK, Canada, India and New Zealand market and was responsible for engaging the company’s clients with weekly promotions.</p>
<p>In September 2020, Scales left LeoVegas and joined Relax Gaming, where he served as an account manager. He conducted many events for the company’s clients and once again designed engaging promotions to provide Relax Gaming fans with more fun.</p>
<p>After his time in Relax Gaming, Scales had a short five-month stint with Playtech. He joined the company as a sales manager and was responsible for attending business events, attracting clients and promoting products to existing clients.</p>
<p>The Appointee Is Excited to Join Kalamba</p>
<p>As a senior account manager at Kalamba, Scales will help to maintain and boost the company’s commercial growth as it continues to expand into new regulated jurisdictions. Kalamba is currently one of the leading slots developers and is lauded for its premium monthly releases.</p>
<p>Kalamba Games’ chief commercial officer, Andrew Crosby, welcomed the new appointee on board. He said that the whole team is delighted to have Scales around. Crosby praised the new senior account manager’s experience and said that his skills are “very welcome” at a time when the company is expanding significantly.</p>
<p>His track record in the industry is going to prove vital as we continue to deliver our powerful combination of innovative games and promotional tools. Andrew Crosby, CCO, Kalamba Games</p>
<p>Elliot Scales also spoke about his new position. He revealed that he is thrilled to join Kalamba Games, which it considers to be one of the best companies in iGaming.</p>
<p>Its rise in the industry has been impressive and I’m truly excited to join the team, bringing my own experience to the role to support the company’s core goals. Elliot Scales, senior account manager, Kalamba Games</p>
<p>Speaking about Kalamba’s expansion, the company recently made a foray into Ontario, thanks to an agreement with Bragg Gaming. A few months ago, the iGaming specialist doubled down on its LATAM expansion by partnering with BetPlay in Colombia.</p>
