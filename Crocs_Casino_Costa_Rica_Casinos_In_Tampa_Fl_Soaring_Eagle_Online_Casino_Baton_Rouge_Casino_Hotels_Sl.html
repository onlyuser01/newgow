<p>Space Invaders will now be part of the online casino content developer’s lineup of Slingo titles</p>
<p>Gaming Realms has signed a new licensing agreement with TAITO Corporation, one of the leading video gaming companies in Japan, and a globally-recognized company for its Space Invaders franchise.</p>
<p>A Blast from the Past Gets New Lease of Life</p>
<p>Moving forward, Gaming Realms will offer players its unique Slingo mechanic mixed with the SPACE INVADERS franchise in the namesake Slingo SPACE INVADERS game. The video game was introduced back in 1978 and has immediately become one of the most influential games in the local and international markets.</p>
<p>Decades later, gamers of all generations have at least heard the name SPACE INVADERS, and this is what Gaming Realms and TAITO Corporation are banking on, bringing the classic to iGaming audiences and at some of the most prominent operator websites.</p>
<p>Gaming Realms is launching the Slingo SPACE INVADERS game through its international operator partners and the Social Publishing business. The new addition to the library joins an already impressive variety of branded and regular gaming options, such as Slingo Deal Or No Deal, Slingo Shark Week, and Slingo Deadliest Catch to name a few.</p>
<p>Commenting on this opportunity, Gaming Realms business development Craig Falciglia hailed the opportunity to embark on the joint project and recreate the timeless SPACE INVADERS in a new form that will be made available to players from all over the globe. The game, Falciglia explained, guarantees an immersive and engaging gaming experience for all.</p>
<p>Slingo Does the SPACE INVADERS’ Anniversary Credit</p>
<p>TAITO Corporation CEO Tsuyoshi Nishiwaki said that teaming up with Gaming Realms and spreading the franchise’s popularity with iGaming fans was a proper way to celebrate its 45th anniversary.</p>
<p>“We feel that Slingo and SPACE INVADERS will make a great partnership, and we are excited to see our iconic pixelated Invader characters manifest in this established platform,” Nishiwaki said. The company has been enjoying robust results in 2022, with revenue increasing by 27% on annual basis, the company said earlier in February.</p>
<p>As to available games, Gaming Realms has been going at a good production pace with the company launching Slingo Golden Envelope in January and continuing to introduce more games in the unique proprietary format.</p>
