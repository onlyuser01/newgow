<p>Dragon Blox GigaBlox review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Dragon Blox GigaBlox takes players on a quest to meet an extremely cute dragon.</p>
<p>After putting on some armor and grabbing their favorite sword, players will set out with a gang of medieval characters in search of treasure. If they can tame a giant red dragon, they might just walk away with some gold and precious gems.</p>
<p>Game of Thrones fans who are in the mood for a wholesome atmosphere will love this slot.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>Players will immediately notice that this slot’s titular dragon has wrapped his body around the stone reels. Animated in a cartoon style, this gentle giant is immediately endearing with his red scales and tiny golden crown. He might remind some players of the mischievous dragon in How to Train Your Dragon.</p>
<p>The reels are filled with gem symbols cut into the shape of card suits. Vivid shades of blue, purple, and yellow ensure that these jewels are eye-catching.</p>
<p>A range of medieval fantasy characters can also be found among the symbols. They are animated in a style that brings to mind video game avatars, each holding their weapon of choice. An burly warrior, a seductive archer, and a pensive wizard all sway in the reels ready for action.</p>
<p>Behind the reels, players will see a castle chamber filled with gold coins, weapons, and chests of treasure. This seems to be the hoard of treasure that the dragon is guarding.</p>
<p>The soundtrack adds a royal atmosphere to this slot with a dramatic rhythm and plenty of trumpets.</p>
<p>Together, the animation and soundtrack of Dragon Blox GigaBlox create a lighthearted world of medieval fantasy.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Dragon Blox GigaBlox offers a Golden Bet feature which increases a bet by 1.5x and increases players’ chances of triggering Gigablox symbols and triggering bonuses.</p>
<p>Dragon Blox GigaBlox is a six-reel, six-row slot with 50 win lines.</p>
<p>Players can buy directly into the bonus features if they choose (see further details below).</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols with the exception of the Scatter symbol.</p>
<p>Dragon Blox GigaBlox features special Gigablox symbols which come in 2x2 and 6x6 sizes, taking up more of the reels, but functioning like individual symbols.</p>
<p>It is possible for Scatters to be Gigablox symbols as well.</p>
<p>Lock’n Blox symbols have the special ability to combine themselves together and remain sticky on the reels. Lock’n Blox symbols also come with multipliers between 1x and 5,000x.</p>
<p>The Monster Free Spins Bonus begins when players land 6 or more Free Spins symbols. The number of triggering Free Spins symbols corresponds to the number of free spins awarded. An additional free spin is awarded whenever players land a new Scatter.</p>
<p>The Monster Jackpot Bonus game begins when players land 6 or more Lock’n Blox symbols. Players begin this feature with 3 free spins. If a new Lock’n Blox symbol lands, the free spin count is reset.</p>
<p>Throughout the Monster Jackpot Bonus, the Lock’n Blox symbols that triggered the feature remain on the reels. Adjacent Lock’n Blox symbols will form a larger pattern with the triggering symbols.</p>
<p>The Monster Jackpot Bonus concludes when no free spins are left.</p>
