    <h1>New Las Vegas Casinos Poseidon Casino Vegas Horseshoe Las Vegas Hotel Casino Casino Jack Texoma Casi</h1>

<p>Microgaming has announced that it will be unloading the world-famous Quickfire distribution business and portfolio. This includes the platform’s jackpot games which will be shifting ownership under Games Global Limited’s banner.</p>
<p>The change of ownership will include the host of games studios across multiple jurisdictions, Games Global mentioned in a LinkedIn release. This operation is expected to complete in the second quarter of 2022, and the buyer will immediately gain access to various jurisdictions, as Games Global will be acquiring regulation-ready assets.</p>
<p>Games Global will end up managing a total of 25 studios and over 3,000 games, which will include the platform’s renowned progressive jackpot network and distribution facilities with 260 customers and a total of 980 brands. The company’s acquisition of the product is a significant upheaval of who controls what assets in iGaming.</p>
<p>Consolidation has been the modus operandi of many companies, but Microgaming is divesting and allowing a new player to emerge quickly. As a result, Games Global will have 1,100 staff members across Europe, North and South America, Oceania, and South Africa.</p>
<p>A New iGaming Giant is Born</p>
<p>Games Global CEO Walter Bugno has welcomed the opportunity to be getting a flying start in the industry. He emphasized the fact that Games Global is a brand-new studio and a fresh development in the industry that we have not witnessed for many years now.</p>
<p>“We see a very vibrant gaming market at present across the world, with many new regulated markets coming online. The creation of a new large-scale independent supply chain that Games Global will be has not been witnessed for many years.” Games Global CEO Walter Bugno</p>
<p>Bugno outlined the mission statement of the company as delivering the “best-of-breed product” that will enhance the end-customer experiences. The executive and Games Global are prepared to work on all fronts to reveal new opportunities ahead of the company.</p>
<p>Games Global is a brand-new company in the iGaming space, established early in 2021. Bugno, who comes from IGT and Lottomatica and Tim Mickley, is presently a CFO at the company and previously of SafeCharge and Playtech.</p>
<p>Microgaming to Not Quit Business Entirely</p>
<p>Microgaming CEO John Coleman welcomed the opportunity to strike a deal that presents significant opportunities for both his company and Games Global. The partnership has been in the making for some time, Coleman noted.</p>
<p>“Games Global will acquire the game IP and distribution business previously known as Quickfire, and Microgaming will continue to support its traditional core business, while increasing its reach with the addition of new business and managed services.” Microgaming CEO John Coleman</p>
<p>Microgaming is not quitting the business Quickfire represents entirely, though. The company will continue to offer turnkey solutions to key customers.</p>
