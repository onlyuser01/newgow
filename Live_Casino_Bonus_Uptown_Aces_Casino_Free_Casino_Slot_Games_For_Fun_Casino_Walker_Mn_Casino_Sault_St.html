    <h1>Live Casino Bonus Uptown Aces Casino Free Casino Slot Games For Fun Casino Walker Mn Casino Sault St</h1>

<p>Hi Nick,</p>
<p>I played with a deposit bonus (not a free bonus) and I had finished my wagering requirements well within the alotted time.</p>
<p>They did a special verification which took three weeks just a month before when I made my previous withdrawal (they did not ask for any documents on this occasion). As far as I am concerned this was just a tactic to buy time (which this casino does a lot). They found nothing unusual on my account during that long verification.</p>
<p>I requested withdrawals of R12,448 on September 16 and R900 on September 19. They take five working days to process a withwal (if you are lucky). So I was expecting the money on September 21 which is the day on which they closed my account (I was unable to log in from then).</p>
<p>They didn't even have the manners to mail me about it. I mailed them and eventually they responded with the note that said there were "irregularities" on the account. They did not give a proper explanation.</p>
<p>I logged a complaint on AskGamblers where 7Reels responded saying that I had more than one account, which is a blatant lie. I have played there for many years now with just one account.</p>
<p>They then sent so called evidence to AskGamblers, who found in the casino's favour (again without an explanation). I don't understand how they could have sent evidence of another account when there is none.</p>
<p>I have mailed 7Reels a number of times and apart from the same "irregularities" response most of my mails go unanswered. I have sent mails directly to the casino manager Ron who is also ignoring them (we have spoken on the phone previously when they were delayng payments).</p>
<p>The bottom line is that they closed my account and stole my withdrawal without giving me a proper reason why. In roughly the past month I have made deposits of about R30,000, so my withdrawal is far lower than that. They accepted these deposits without a word and then when I wanted to withdraw, they stole my money and closed my account.</p>
<p>I mailed the manager Ron for a third time last night and he is still ignoring my mails. Something very fishy is going on here and I think I deserve to know what grounds they have used to steal my money.</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>
<p>Surly</p>
