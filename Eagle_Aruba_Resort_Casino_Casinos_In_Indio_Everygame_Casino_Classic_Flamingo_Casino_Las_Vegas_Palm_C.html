    <h1>Eagle Aruba Resort Casino Casinos In Indio Everygame Casino Classic Flamingo Casino Las Vegas Palm C</h1>

<p>Their site can be glitchy at times. I ALWAYS play $54-$55 per spin on Live Vegas Roulette. I hit the rebet button and nothing happened, I hit it again nothing happened, so I logged out and logged back in and they had took $328 of my money. No bets ever showed and when I called they were rude basically telling me I was just upset I lost a big bet. This is gambling and if I lose, I lose but I did not bet that and they are no help at all. I asked that they check with IT and they can see I logged out and logged back in, and I think they should be able to tell no wagers was showing but they aren’t willing to do that so I feel as if they stole my money. I spoke with Percy who said that he is the casino manager and he was very rude and told me that there is no one else above him to talk to. If they check the history since I have had my account I always bet pretty much the same numbers and bet $54-$55 per spin. I’ve never even bet over $100 per spin. They don’t want to listen they are just accusatory. At this point they can have the money but I will do my best to make sure players are informed that their customer service is awful and that they steal money.</p>
<p>I’ve been trying to figure out how it got to $328 by me hitting the rebet button and i think what it did was double my bet twice. For example I play $2 on number 4 and they said I played $16 on it and on number 1 I bet $5 and they said I bet $25. No bets ever showed up on the board and it didn’t say I had bets played and my amount was eight hundred something odd dollars when I logged out. I think they should do their research of my account and speak with their IT but they aren’t willing to because they just want to keep my money. The number that came out was 10 and I was logged back in by number 15 and that’s when I noticed the money gone and took that screenshot. That screenshot really don’t show anything except for the fact that I was logged back in and Percy the "manager" said I logged out and back in after 10 minutes. Which wasn’t the case. Again I want to reiterate that their customer service is awful!</p>
