<p>Hi, I was making bets in BETSOFA. I made all the bets on eSports Cyber live arena eBasketball matches. Yesterday morning, I had around $173 in my BETSOFA account and I also had made a withdrawal of $200. But, when I opened my account after sometimes I had 0 dollar in my BETSOFA account and withdrawal is also gone. I contacted BETSOFA customer support and they gave me this response.</p>
<p>Dear Princekumar!</p>
<p>"Thank you for contacting BetSofa Support!</p>
<p>We hasten to inform you that we received a response from the relevant departments.</p>
<p>Bets have been cancelled according to the rule '' Betsofa reserves the right to cancel any bet made on obviously "wrong" odds''!</p>
<p>Also, based on this, recalculations were made and the amount of funds on your account could have changed, hence the delay or cancellation of withdrawals.</p>
<p>Kind Regards,</p>
<p>Tatjana,</p>
<p>BetSofa Customer Support team"</p>
<p>Now, I don't know whom to complain, where to get, because I know they are not going to listen me and return my money.</p>
