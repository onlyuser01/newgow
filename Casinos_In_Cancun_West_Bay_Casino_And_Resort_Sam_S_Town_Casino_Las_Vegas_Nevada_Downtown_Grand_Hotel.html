<p>As an organization, Sounders FC holds our home turf in high regard, with our 133-47-44 home record as a special point of distinction. Today’s naming rights agreement brings in a partner that complements the pride and success that we want those attending matches at Lumen Field to feel, and we’re happy to continue working with the Puyallup Tribe and EQC as they support soccer in our region.

<p>Meanwhile, the Puyallup Tribal Council released its own statement on the relationship. The tribe said that its members are proud to continue working together with the Seattle-based soccer team and are honored to see the tribe’s name and logo on the Lumen Field pitch.</p>
<p>The Sounders have been a joy to partner with and are committed to learning about and honoring our deep history and culture here as Puyallup people. We congratulate them for all their achievements. Puyallup Tribal Council statement</p>
<p>The council added that the Puyallup Tribe’s impact in the region has so far been positive, as the tribe has helped many people find a job and has provided gamblers with premium entertainment. The Puyallup want to continue their commitment to excellence by working with other community leaders that share the same values as them.</p>
