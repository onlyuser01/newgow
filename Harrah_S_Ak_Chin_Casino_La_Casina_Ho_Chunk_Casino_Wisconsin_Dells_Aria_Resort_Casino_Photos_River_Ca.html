<p>Manchester United vs. Aston Villa is arguably the most interesting Premier League Boxing Day duel. The game is played on Tuesday, December 26, at Old Trafford in Manchester</p>
<p>Manchester United and Aston Villa both have the same plans for the 2023-24 Premier League season. They want to finish the campaign in the Top 4 and qualify for the Champions League. Right now, Aston Villa is in a much better position to make that dream come true.</p>
<p>Unai Emery’s men are in much better form than Erik ten Hag’s boys, but there’s one thing that needs to worry the Villans ahead of their trip to the North. They’ve got a very bad record at Old Trafford, losing 17 of their last 20 games on Man United’s turf.</p>

<p>The Red Devils are Ready to Ruin Aston Villa’s Christmas</p>
<p>There’s a notable trend when it comes to Man United’s performances this season. The Red Devils are doing alright against underdogs, but they just can’t seem to find a way to upset the odds against big teams.</p>
<p>Another trend we’ve noticed is that when they defend with all they’ve got, they can win points. The best example is the game with Liverpool earlier this month, which saw them “park the bus” in front of their goal.</p>
<p>March: Liverpool have 18 shots against Manchester United, win 7-0</p>
<p>December: Liverpool have 34 shots against Manchester United, draw 0-0</p>
<p>Funny old game, football. — Lewis Steele (@LewisSteele_) December 17, 2023</p>
<p>It worked as they managed to keep a clean sheet despite Liverpool making 34 goal attempts. In comparison, Man United’s players made only six goal attempts that day.</p>
<p>But will they defend with everything against Aston Villa? We don’t think so. After all, they’re playing on their turf on Boxing Day against a direct rival for a spot in the Top 4.</p>
<p>That’s why they need to go all-in on the offense on Tuesday. Unfortunately for them, that’s a tactic that’s backfired many times this season. Will the same happen against the Villans?</p>
<p>Ambitious Aston Villa Coming to Old Trafford for All Three Points</p>
<p>Aston Villa is the biggest surprise of the 2023-24 Premier League season. This team was projected to be in the middle of the table at this stage of the season, but the Villans are competing for the No. 1 spot with Liverpool and Arsenal.</p>
<p>If they want to stay in the competition for the title – which would be their first since 1981 – they need to keep winning. In normal circumstances, going for a draw at Old Trafford would be the logical thing to do, but the Villans want to stay high in the standings, which is why they need to try and beat the Red Devils.</p>
<p>The bad news is that they’ve got a bad record on Man United’s turf. The good news is that they’re doing very well in the 2023-24 season, performing as a collective that’s worth more than the sum of its parts. These guys are great both offensively and defensively, so no one can blame them if they feel confident of winning the 2023 Boxing Day game.</p>
<p>Manchester United vs. Aston Villa Prediction</p>
<p>The biggest advantage of the Red Devils in the Boxing Day game is that they play in front of their own fans. At home, they tend to show up, even though their 2023 roster doesn’t seem good enough to beat the in-form Aston Villa.</p>
<p>We don’t think they’re going to beat the Villans this time, but we don’t think they’re going to lose either. Instead, this game seems destined to finish in a tie.</p>
<p>Pick: Manchester United vs. Aston Villa – Draw</p>
