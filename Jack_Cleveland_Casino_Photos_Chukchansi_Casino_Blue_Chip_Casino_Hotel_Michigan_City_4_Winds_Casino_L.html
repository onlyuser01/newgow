    <h1>Jack Cleveland Casino Photos Chukchansi Casino Blue Chip Casino Hotel Michigan City 4 Winds Casino L</h1>

<p>Beware of high ratings/reviews of this casino. I read thru this casino's reviews after being ripped off from them and was not surprised to discover that so many of the reviews are fake! Multiple reviews use the same language - "a nice win to take home" "slick platform" blah blah blah. Does anyone actually use the word slick under the age of 70? It's all cheeze and rice reviews. Proceed with caution they ripped me off for $621</p>
<p>When reading the email below from the casino, keep in mind that the second address they are asking me to verify is an old address - haven't lived there in over a year and is not the address on my spinfinity account or my bank account (despite the fact that it's not even the right "old address") They transposed the numbers in it, so essentially I've never lived at that address so I could never even verify it if I wanted to. I never played at their sister site, maybe I opened an account there but I never played.</p>
<p>Also 2 of the cards they want me to verify, I don't have anymore they have been canceled as stolen or lost.</p>
<p>Below is the actual email from their support team, requesting these ridiculous and over the top verification that really just proves they don't want to pay me. The kicker is, I've spent thousands of dollars at this casino. SAD...Beware!</p>
<p>They cancelled my account before anything could even get handled.</p>

<p>Hi Jennifer</p>
<p>In regard to the card copies sent in they are digitally edited (drawn over) and we are unable to accept documents that have been edited in anyway per the terms of the casino.</p>
<p>If you'll please send a New Copy of the card ending in 3170, as well as Front &amp; Back of cards ending 4190 / 3564 / 3076 as these where used in our casino group on our site slots ninja</p>
<p>For your security you can cover the CVC with a small strip of paper. We do only need to see the first 6 digits and the last 4 digits of the card along with the name on the card to confirm ownership. If you would like to cover the numbers in the middle, that is not a problem. Any cards that have been digitally modified will not be accepted</p>
<p>To avoid delay please ensure the copies are:</p>
<p>fully legible and not blurred</p>
<p>displaying the full document showing all 4 corners (not folded/enveloped/covered),</p>
<p>In full color</p>
<p>Not digitally edited (including paint/drawing editing software)</p>
<p>We also need the Proof of Address for 4201 N 40th St #49 phoenix, AZ 85018, which is the address shown on your Slots Ninja account.</p>
<p>To complete your account verification, we do need to complete a quick verification call (approximately 5 minutes)</p>
<p>I understand the frustrations but per our casino's terms of operation you will need to provide all the above to complete verification. Once completed then the cashier team will begin the processing of the withdrawal</p>
