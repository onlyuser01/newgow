<p>Caesars Low-Quality Stock with Bear Market Rally Potential</p>

<p>Shares of Caesars Entertainment (NASDAQ:CZR) are off 46.72% year-to-date, and the company is one of the most debt-riddled in the gaming industry. So it fits the bill as a low-quality stock in the eyes of some market observers.</p>

<p>That dubious status could actually work in the casino operator’s favor should a summer rally come to pass on Wall Street after more than four months of relentless selling. Caesars appears on a list of bear market rally candidates constructed by Bank of America.</p>
<p>The bank screened for S&amp;P 500 member firms with quality grades of “B” or lower that also qualify as high beta names.</p>
<p>During bear-market rallies, low quality, high risk stocks that are most beaten down typically outperform,” writes Bank of America strategist Savita Subramanian.</p>
<p>Beta gauges a security’s volatility relative to the broader market. In simple terms, a high beta stock like Caesars is likely to overshoot market moves in either direction, and when its momentum wanes, selling pressure can be severe.</p>
<p>Caesars in Interesting Company</p>
<p>Caesars is one of 28 stocks on the aforementioned Bank of America list, and is the only gaming name in the group. Other companies on the list include Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook parent Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB), and COVID-19 vaccine maker Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA).</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Harrah’s operator closed at $49.83, extending its one-month decline to 25.65% while marking the stock’s first close below $50 since November 2020. That despite US casinos setting a gross gaming revenue (GGR) record in the first quarter, with many operators signaling that momentum is carrying over into the current quarter.</p>
<p>Still, analysts remain bullish on Caesars, saying the stock’s selloff is too severe, and the name is now underappreciated by investors.</p>
<p>“CZR continues to frame one of the largest CY22E and CY23E deleveraging stories, in our view, with the most significant components scheduled for the near-term. As CZR’s tapped the breaks on digital spend and brick-and-mortar operations grows sequentially, free cash flow (FCF) harvesting is underway,” said B. Riley analyst David Bain in a note out earlier this month.</p>
<p>Caesars Not Short of Catalysts</p>
<p>While 2022 could be the year “sell in May and go away” proves to be fruitful investing wisdom, some market observers are wagering on a summertime rally.</p>
<p>Given stocks’ proclivity for summer lethargy coupled with a downbeat start to 2022, that might be asking a lot. Specific to Caesars, however, the operators has catalysts, including a potential near-term announcement on the sale of one of its Las Vegas venues. Speculation is intensifying Flamingo is the property that will be sold, and it could command a $1 billion price tag.</p>
<p>“Bottom line is that we continue to have the utmost confidence in management’s ability to navigate this tricky environment and emerge a leaner/more efficient company which should directly enhance shareholder value over time,” said Stifel analyst Steven Wieczynski in a note. “We continue to see a path back to a triple-digit CZR share price, an outcome supported by management’s ability to generate $8-$10 or more of FCF per share over time.”</p>
