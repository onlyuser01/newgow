<p>Thank you for your reply, MatthewLane. I apologize for the misunderstanding, the message was published automatically based on the information you provided while submitting this complaint.</p>
<p>I checked the bonus T&amp;Cs and I found this:</p>
<p>"2.4 Players may not redeem multiple non-deposit offers, including free-spin offers without making a real money deposit in-between. Management reserves the right to withhold any winnings derived from activity that does not meet this condition."</p>
<p>Although I agree that ideally, casinos should not let players do anything that would result in winnings confiscation, a rule like this is industry standard, and not many casinos can (and do) enforce it on a software level. This is a very common rule and the vast majority of online casinos prohibit claiming multiple free chips in a row.</p>
<p>I am afraid that if you claimed more than one no-deposit bonus without a deposit in between them, there is nothing we can do and it doesn't matter if you won something from such bonuses in the past or not.</p>
<p>Please, let me know if there is anything else I could help you with, otherwise, I will be forced to close this complaint. Thank you for your understanding.</p>
