<p>Toro Wilds Reel</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Toro Wilds Reel is a bull-themed online slot game from Synot Games. The slot is based on the Spanish sport of bullfighting and features traditional images from the sport.</p>
<p>Graphics Sounds, and Animation</p>
<p>Synot Games has kept things very basic with the design of the Toro Wilds Reel slot. So much so that it could have been released much earlier than it was.</p>
<p>The reels sit in the middle of a little Spanish town, with balconies full of flowers and red buntings filling the street. The soundtrack is as you would expect, taking inspiration from Mexican culture with a slight Mariachi sound.</p>
<p>Overview of Toro Wilds Reel slot</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Toro Wilds Reel keeps things simple with its base game action. The slot uses five reels and four rows, with 50 active paylines on each spin. Winning combinations are formed by landing three or more matching symbols across a payline, starting on the leftmost reel.</p>
<p>The control panel at the bottom of the reels is used to adjust the stake, spin the reels, and set the autoplay options.</p>

<p>Wild, Bonuses, and Free Spins</p>
<p>Like the base game and the design, the Toro Wild Reels bonus features are all a little bit basic. The slot only has one notable bonus, and that is a Free Spins round. This is triggered when you land three or more of the Bull Scatter symbols. No matter how many Scatters you land, you are given 12 spins. During the round, all winnings are instantly tripled.</p>

<p>Bet Size, RTP &amp; Variance</p>
<p>As we've mentioned already in this Wild Toro slot review, the stake for the game is adjusted under the reels by clicking on the +/- buttons. The minimum stake is $0.20, and the maximum is $100, which is a fairly standard range.</p>
<p>The slot has a maximum win of 2,000x your stake, and the RTP is 96.04%, which is around the industry average according to our slot strategy guide.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Toro Wilds Reel is a game that fails to muster a lot of excitement. The design is not offensively bad, but it is not likely to live long in the memory, and the lack of bonuses, poor winning potential, and an average RTP mean this is a slot you can happily avoid.</p>
