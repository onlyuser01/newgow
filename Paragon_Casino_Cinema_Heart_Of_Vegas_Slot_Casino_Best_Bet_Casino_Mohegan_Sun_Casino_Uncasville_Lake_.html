<p>Just six days after their clash in the league, Manchester City and Liverpool meet again. This time, they lock horns in the semifinal of the English FA Cup. The game is played on Saturday, April 16 at Wembley.</p>
<p>Last weekend, we saw the two foes share points with the final score being 2-2. This Saturday, however, the game cannot finish in a draw. If it’s tied after 90 minutes, extra time is to be played, followed by a penalty shootout (if needs be).</p>
<p>So, which team will win on Sunday, thus booking the ticket to the FA Cup final – Manchester City or Liverpool?</p>

<p>Odds (Slightly) Favor Manchester City</p>
<p>Manchester City is seen as a slight favorite to win in the 90 minutes. However, the odds on Pep Guardiola’s team advancing to the final of the FA Cup are significantly shorter than Liverpool’s. In fact, Man City is an odds-on favorite to qualify for the next stage.</p>
<p>The problem is that in order to win, Sky Blues need to outscore Liverpool. Unfortunately for them, their offense hasn’t been too productive over the last couple of weeks. Evidence of this is that Man City players failed to find the net in three of their previous ten matches. This includes the game they played on Wednesday with Atletico Madrid in the Champions League.</p>
<p>They did score twice against Liverpool last weekend, but they also conceded two. The reason this should worry Guardiola is that the Reds had only six goal chances in total that day, but still managed to turn a third of them into goals.</p>
<p>Liverpool Going for the Quadruple</p>
<p>Jurgen Klopp’s Reds have already won the EFL Cup (Carabao Cup) this season. They’re also in the race for the Premier League title, with just one point less than the table leaders Manchester City. Further, the Merseyside Reds have also advanced to the semifinal of the Champions League, where they’re taking on Villarreal.</p>
<p>Finally, they’re also in the competition for the title in the FA Cup. What all this means is that there’s a chance we could see Liverpool win four titles this season. It’s never been done, but the prospect of making history sure is good enough of a reason for the Reds to continue to fight.</p>
<p>Manchester City vs. Liverpool FA Cup Semifinal Prediction</p>
<p>It’s going to be a real thriller! Same as in their previous clash, we should see plenty of goals this time. But who’s more likely to advance to the FA Cup final? Liverpool is in slightly better form, which could prove crucial in this game.</p>
<p>Picks: Liverpool to win; over 2.5 goals</p>
