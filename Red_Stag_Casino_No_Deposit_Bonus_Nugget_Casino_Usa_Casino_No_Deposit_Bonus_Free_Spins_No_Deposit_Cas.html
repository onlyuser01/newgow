    <h1>Red Stag Casino No Deposit Bonus Nugget Casino Usa Casino No Deposit Bonus Free Spins No Deposit Cas</h1>

<p>Hello dear Casinoguru team,</p>
<p>In my case, it is about 2 different topics that I have had to deal with for a few days/weeks now.</p>
<p>Payouts:</p>
<p>The first issue concerns my withdrawals at Blizz Casino. I'll explain the whole process to you so that you can understand everything. After winning quite a bit, I wanted to cash out part of the winnings. on 12/22/2022 I tried to withdraw $3000. This payout was then rejected on December 23, 2022, with the notice that I still had to go through a verification process. So I provided all the documents that were needed. This is where it started, that each verification step took between 24-48 hours. Step 2 could only be uploaded when Step 1 had been checked, etc. So it took until December 31, 2022 for my verification to be finally completed. Of course, I have nothing against verification per se, but the way the process is handled there is definitely not designed to be user-friendly. So my payout was delayed by over a week. I then made a new withdrawal on 12/31/2022 of $5000. Nothing happened again until January 5th, 2023 and I sat down with a service employee for the 10th time to ask where the problem with the payout was. Since I had already completed the verification process a long time ago and the Terms and Conditions on the page state that payments usually take place immediately, I was a little surprised what took so long there. The service representative then told me that he had spoken to the "finance department" and that I should split my $5000 withdrawal into 5 separate $1000 withdrawals so that the process could be completed. He assured me that the payouts will then take place on the same day. So I made 5 withdrawal requests of $1000 each. The first $1000 was actually paid out on the same day, the second $1000 on January 7th, 2023. To date, none of the other 3 payments have arrived and I now find it cheeky how the customers are treated there. I have not received any notification from the finance department, which is why it is delayed and I also do not understand the issue of splitting the payment into 5 payments. I have now applied for further payments. $2500 on 01/06/2023, $2500 on 01/09/2023 and $500 on 01/10/2023 (Total $8500 left now). I just don't want to be stalled and ask for the payment as soon as possible. After all this back and forth, my patience is at an end. I am aware that the weekly withdrawal limit of $5000 must be observed, although I also received a message here that I had special conditions in my current rank as a customer, so that the withdrawals are faster and higher limits also apply to me would. But even after repeated inquiries, I did not get a correct answer here as to how high the limits are now.</p>
<p>Topic 2:</p>
<p>Blizz Casino held a so-called "Christmas Race" in December. Here there was a ranking of the players who have implemented the most money in a certain period of time. The race ended on December 31, 2022 and I ended up in 8th place there. So I should be credited with $300 cash and 300 free spins. After consultation with the service, it said that the money and the free spins will be credited to my account on 01/01/2023 or at the latest on 01/02/2023. To date (01/10/2023) nothing has arrived and when inquiring in the service they only say that the department is working on it. No information what it is or why there is such a long delay.</p>
<p>My general feeling here is just that you are stalled with all things. On the other hand, deposits are of course always in the account immediately and without processing time and I can gamble away thousands of dollars within minutes. There is no relationship at all here and there should definitely be more player protection and much better communication. Despite everything, the chat support was always friendly and helpful. However, no solution could be found.</p>
<p>I really hope that you can help me here.</p>
<p>Thank you very much and best regards Ranba</p>
