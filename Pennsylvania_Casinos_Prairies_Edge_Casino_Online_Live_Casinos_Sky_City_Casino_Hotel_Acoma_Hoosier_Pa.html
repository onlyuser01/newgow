<p>Analyst Bullish on ‘Underappreciated’ Twin River, Sees Upside of More Than 25%</p>

<p>Twin River Worldwide Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: TRWH) – a casino operator that has been public for just over two months – is already drawing bullish praise from analysts.</p>

<p>In a research note published June 20, Union Gaming analyst John DeCree initiated coverage of the owner of the Tiverton Casino in Rhode Island with a “buy” rating and a $38 price target, implying upside of 25.45 percent from Friday’s close of $30.29.</p>
<p>Twin River is an underappreciated, catalyst-rich, regional small/mid-cap gaming company with a solid balance sheet, strong free cash flow generation, and a proven track record of accretive mergers and acquisitions,” said DeCree.</p>
<p>In addition to the Tiverton Casino, Twin River owns and operates the Twin River Casino Hotel, which is also located in Rhode Island; Dover Downs Hotel &amp; Casino in Dover, Delaware; Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino in Biloxi, Mississippi and the Arapahoe Park racetrack in Aurora, Colorado.</p>
<p>Baby Being Tossed With The Bathwater</p>
<p>“Don’t throw the baby out with the bathwater” is a centuries old idiom that is widely used on Wall Street to describe selling of a good stock when investors are parting ways with related, but more flawed equities in the same sector or industry.</p>
<p>That may be what is happening to Twin River in June. Month-to-date, the shares are down 5.23 percent amid concerns about the US/China trade imbroglio and the competitive threat presented by Sunday’s opening of Wynn Resorts. Ltd.’s (NASDAQ: WYNN) Encore Boston Harbor. DeCree contends that regional gaming operators, such as Twin River, have been unjustly affected by international trade tensions.</p>
<p>“TRWH fits right into our ongoing thesis that U.S. regional gaming companies have been unfairly coupled to the US/China trade tensions,” said the analyst. “We contend that the U.S. macroeconomic environment is still strong and fundamentals for regional gaming remain encouraging.”</p>
<p>The analyst also believes investors are overreacting to the potential impact Encore Boston Harbor could have on Twin River’s New England market share.</p>
<p>“One of the reasons TRWH is trading below fair value is concern around the opening of Encore Boston,” he said. “We are estimating a 13 percent decline in revenue at Twin River, which is less than the commonly discussed 20 percent impact.”</p>
<p>DeCree said TRWH’s Rhode Island properties have some advantages over Encore Boston Harbor, including better parking and legalized sports betting.</p>
<p>The analyst said that with the “monopoly-like status” of Twin River’s two Bay State properties, if sports gambling there can replicate the success seen in New Jersey, that could add another $1 to $2 of value to TRWH shares.</p>
<p>Rewarding Investors</p>
<p>Twin River recently announced it will spend up to $250 million on dividends and share buybacks, an impressive sum for a newly public company with a market capitalization of $1.24 billion.</p>
<p>DeCree estimates the company will generate $104 million, or $2.54 per share, in free cash flow next year and that TRWH could afford to allocate half of that to dividends.</p>
<p>“Assuming TRWH would be willing to pay out 50 percent of levered free cash flow in dividends, we estimate the annual dividend per share could increase 3-fold to a $1.20, representing a 4 percent yield on the current share price and 3 percent on our $38 price target,” said the Union Gaming analyst.</p>
