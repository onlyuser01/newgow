    <h1>Shooting Star Casino Mahnomen Silver Slipper Casino Funzpoints Com Casino Login Winstar Casino In Th</h1>

<p>I requested a withdrawal of EUR 800 on May 9th. All previous withdrawals took no more than 72 hours to arrive, so after a week went by without receiving my funds I was starting to sense something went wrong.</p>
<p>I contacted support and my "VIP Manager" numerous times and also contacted support after this. They asked me to send my bank statement (which I did) to ensure I had not received the EUR 800 withdrawal. After sending this I have not received any update on the status of my withdrawal. They closed my support ticket automatically after 3 days. When I replied that I had not received anything they again closed it but stated "SOLVED" as a reason… The VIP manager only gives answers in the spirit of "My friend, have patience. My friend, we need time" without actually giving any sort of update on what we are waiting on. They actually replied to one of my emails via the "JungliWin support desk" which verifies 0xbet and JungliWin are the same group. I have played on enough online casinos over the last 15 years to sense that something’s not right here.</p>
<p>Again, all previous withdrawals were pretty smooth so I have nothing negative to say about that. However, once a withdrawal goes wrong there apparently is zero support.</p>
<p>They use "Nodapay/Naudapay" for withdrawals. I also asked 0xbet support to give me some sort of transaction number so I can check with them directly, which they refused.</p>
<p>All in all I would just like to receive my withdrawal and hope CasinoGuru can help me in this.</p>
