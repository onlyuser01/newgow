    <h1>Hamburg Gaming Casino Excalibur Hotel Casino Hollywood Casino Toledo Lakeside Hotel And Casino Salar</h1>

<p>At the end of August, virtual sports and gaming supplier Highlight Games signed a licensing deal with Manchester City that would allow it to use the club’s historic footage. The London-based supplier has now announced that it has expanded a similar deal with Turkish Super Lig. Highlight Games will continue to use the soccer league’s historic footage in the upcoming years. The content will be used for gaming, lottery, and sports betting products, with special emphasis on their award-winning SOCCERBET product.</p>
<p>The Turkish SOCCERBET Product Is Popular Worldwide</p>
<p>Highlight Games launched and started distributing the Turkish SOCCERBET product together with the Turkish National Lottery and Sisal Sans in 2019. The product first reached the Turkish market and gradually started to make its presence felt in a number of international markets as well.</p>
<p>The fresh contract upgrade will allow the supplier to benefit from a renewal of rights that will spread over several years. The renewal will grant it additional access to decades of archive footage belonging to the Turkish Super Lig. The footage will only be available for use in instant win games and the SOCCERBET product. The company’s co-chief executive officer Steven Holmes spoke about the “very successful launch and deployment” of their Turkish SOCCERBET product while expressing delight to announce that their “commitment to excellence in video virtual sports” has led to a renewal of their contract “for the foreseeable future”.</p>
<p>SOCCERBET, the Number One Product in Europe’s Largest Virtual Sports Market</p>
<p>SOCCERBET is Highlight Games’ flagship product and also its best-selling title in the largest market for virtual sports in Europe. The product is the best-ranking game part of the supplier’s branded portfolio that features titles like NBA Last 60. SOCCERBET is currently accessible on a large number of lottery and gaming markets in all parts of the world, including the US, the UK, Turkey, Greece, Italy, Colombia, and the Philippines. It encompasses a design that has been highly optimized according to decades of archived live soccer footage. It features clubs and players from some of Europe’s best leagues, mixing iconic stars, top commentary, and unforgettable action. The product is available with standard betting markets, along with yellow/red cards, and in-play betting, and pays out in the 85%-90% range, following operators’ requests. All of Highlight Games’ titles are entirely customizable for mobile, online, and retail options. They can be efficiently tailored to match the offerings of a variety of virtual sports and sportsbook operators.</p>
<p>Highlight Games Holds On to Its Crown in the Video Gaming Market</p>
<p>The news of the fresh agreement expansion comes to strengthen the supplier’s position as a global leader in the video gaming industry. Homes called their portfolio an “unrivaled” one packed with engaging and exclusive games. The co-CEO further explained that the company will keep growing its business “from strength to strength” while building a more solid portfolio and preparing to celebrate the ongoing success of the Turkish SOCCERBET products worldwide.</p>
