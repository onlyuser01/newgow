<p>Hi Casino Gurus,</p>
<p>it is now over 14 days since my Heybets withdrawal was requested. This has still not received &amp; I have since been notified than my account has been closed due to 'multiple accounts' despite this being my one &amp; only account at Heybets.</p>
<p>17 days ago I created an account at Heybets and took a 200% deposit bonus. I then deposited approx $100 in Litecoin crypto and was credited approx $300. I started to play. 24 hours later I had met all wagering requirements (40x i think, around $12,000 staked). I then converted my 'heybucks' into litecoin and initiated my withdrawal to my Binance crypto wallet.</p>
<p>24 hours later my account had been deactivated so I contacted Heybets support to find out what was wrong and where my withdrawal was. Heybets support coyldnt tell me any info at all and could only say that they were 'investigating' and that they had escalated to a supervisor.</p>
<p>Seeing that other posts on this site all have the advice to wait 14 days before raising a complaint I tried to be patient and wait for a response.</p>
<p>A response from a Luke Jackson at Heybets Support finally came around 1 week later informing me of the below -</p>
<p>Dear (name deleted)</p>
<p>We regret to inform you that your account with Heybets must be closed due to §6.3 of our Terms of Service (https://heybets.io/tos), which prohibits players from registering multiple accounts. We understand that this may be disappointing news, but we can not allow players to abuse our bonuses and promotions.</p>
<p>We ask that you refrain from creating new accounts under a different username, as this will be detected by our software and the accounts will be closed again.</p>
<p>We apologize for any inconvenience caused by the closure of your account and appreciate your understanding in this matter. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact us.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Heybets Support</p>
<p>‐----------------------</p>
<p>I replied to this mail a day or two later as soon as I had saw it as below -</p>
<p>Hi Luke,</p>
<p>Apologies. This mail had gone to spam so only just seeing it.</p>
<p>Confused as this is my only account. I deposited approx $100 in litecoin and had a few wins that left my balance at approx $2900 upon completing bonus wagering requirements. Can you please process my withdrawal?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<hr />
<p>I am still yet to receive any kind of response to my latest mail from Heybets and have been waiting for the last 8 days.</p>
<p>They have NEVER asked me to complete any KYC and when I did have access to my account there was no obvious place to complete this.</p>
<p>Claiming that I have multiple accounts is a complete lie. Not to mention the lack of KYC i am extremely confused as to why they can be so confident that i have multiple account with them.</p>
<p>Seems like a big scam and they just don't want to pay!</p>
<p>Any &amp; all help greatly appreciated.</p>
