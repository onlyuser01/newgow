<p>Golden Egypt review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Ancient Egypt. Again.</p>
<p>Rolling sands, golden death masks, pleasure barges, jewels, and an infestation of scarab beetles. This is the setting for Golden Egypt.</p>
<p>Eschewing the usual hieroglyphs in favour of a more varied array of artefacts and characters, Golden Egypt builds a vision of the Ancient Near East that is familiar to most slot players, but which comes with a few small twists.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The graphics are nothing special. The background is beautifully rendered Nile-bank real estate with pyramids and temples. But the reels are decorated with rather plain artwork. Realistic but characterless.</p>
<p>The animations are decent. Clean and simple movements to flag up wins, and smooth weightless spins of the reels.</p>
<p>The music is also short on atmosphere. It is made up of a perfectly fine ambient track. The win and spins sounds are solid too. But they could all be used on almost any kind of slot. There is nothing unique or engaging to make this slot feel different.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Golden Egypt is a five reel slot with four rows and 25 win lines.</p>
<p>There is neat Coins counter feature and a simple bonus. This is where the slot starts to make some room of its own.</p>
<p>The play feels familiar, but with enough spice to begin to make up for the bland visuals.</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Bonus symbol. In the base game, Wilds appear when the counter at the top of a reel fills. When this happens, the next spin removes a Gold Coin from the counter and the entire reel comes up Wild. This continues until the Gold Coins run out.</p>
<p>The Gold Coin symbol on a reel adds a Gold Coin to the counter of that reel. The player begins with two randomly assigned coins on separate reels. There is room for two Gold Coins on each counter.</p>
<p>Three or more Bonus symbols trigger a Free Spin bonus. The player can choose between low, medium, and high variance options. The low variance option gives the player one random reel of Wilds each spin, the medium variance gives the player two, and the high variance gives the player three.</p>
<p>The number of free spins is correspondingly adjusted. With more spins in the low variance option, and fewer spins the higher the variance.</p>
<p>For example, three Bonus symbols get the player five spins with three Wild reels, fifteen spins with two Wild reels, or thirty spins with one Wild reel. Four Bonus symbols award twice the number of spins at each level of variance. Five Bonus symbols triple the number of spins.</p>
<p>We like high variance options, so recommend going for the few spins with more Wild reels.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.18%, a little over our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.25 up to a maximum of $/£/€500.00 per spin.</p>
<p>IGT lists the volatility of this game as medium. Medium volatility makes it a poor match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>With its medium volatility and uninspiring visuals, this slot isn’t doing a lot at first glance to attract us.</p>
<p>However, players who do not mind lower volatility shouldn’t be put off. The gameplay is fun and clever, the RTP is perfectly fine, and the design is solid if a little underwhelming.</p>
<p>While this doesn’t get a strong recommendation from us, its popularity means it is clearly working for a subset of players. You’d have to give it a try to see if you are one of them.</p>
