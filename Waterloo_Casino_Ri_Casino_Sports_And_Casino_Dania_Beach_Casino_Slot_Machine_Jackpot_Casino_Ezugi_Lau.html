    <h1>Waterloo Casino Ri Casino Sports And Casino Dania Beach Casino Slot Machine Jackpot Casino Ezugi Lau</h1>

<p>Ezugi, one of the world’s best live casino game providers, has released Royal Poker. Its new live poker game is streamed from the company’s studio and is hosted by trained dealers. It also offers numerous opportunities for players and allows them to make various decisions.</p>
<p>Royal Poker Is Played Against the House</p>
<p>According to Ezugi, which recently signed a content partnership with NuxGame, Royal Poker enjoys massive popularity in Eastern and Central Europe. The game is played against the dealer and standard poker rules are applied.</p>
<p>The goal of the game is to beat the five-card hand of the dealer by having a better combination. In terms of the added opportunities for the players, Royal Poker allows players to exchange cards for a chance to receive a stronger hand or buy an extra card for the dealer to help them qualify.</p>
<p>Pang Goh, the business development director at Ezugi, shared some thoughts on the new game, which will expand the studio’s poker offering. Goh noted that players are always looking for something new and that is exactly what Royal Poker brings.</p>
<p>Thanks to the fact that players are up against the house, the overall excitement is ramped up and hence, players can “experience a new spin on a classic variation.” Players will face several choices throughout the game and that adds another layer of challenge and complexity.</p>
<p>Goh also spoke on the history of Royal Poker by saying that its roots come from Eastern Europe but there’s no doubt that the variant is becoming increasingly popular across other parts of the world.</p>
<p>Ezugi Is Dedicated to Reaching New Markets</p>
<p>Ever since Ezugi became a part of the Evolution Gaming family in 2018, it has focused on expanding across various markets. Europe has been one of the main targets and the studio recently doubled down on its goal by partnering with OlyBet in the EU and Baltic regions.</p>
<p>OlyBet is one of the leading entertainment platforms in several European countries, including Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. Thanks to this partnership, Ezugi will supply the online gaming and betting brand with its live games and help the platform provide players with a more unique gaming experience.</p>
<p>The chief performance officer at OlyBet, Tomas Graham, shared his words on the partnership. He said that it is important for the operator to constantly improve its game portfolio and that is exactly where Ezugi is able to help.</p>
<p>Goh added that with the partnership, Ezugi will reap several benefits. Not only will it provide players in the Baltics and the EU with new experiences, but it will also strengthen its positions in Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia.</p>
<p>Ezugi’s dedication to creating a more diverse portfolio was also shown back in April 2022, when the studio launched Ultimate Sic Bo. This game was able to increase the thrill that players experience as it featured multipliers of up to 1,000x. The best part about it is that Ultimate Sic Bo has very simple gameplay.</p>
