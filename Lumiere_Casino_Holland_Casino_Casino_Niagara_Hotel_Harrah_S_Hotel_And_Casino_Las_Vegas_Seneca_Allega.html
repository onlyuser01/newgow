    <h1>Lumiere Casino Holland Casino Casino Niagara Hotel Harrah S Hotel And Casino Las Vegas Seneca Allega</h1>

<p>Good evening, let me explain better what happened, I created an account at the casino in question, I deposited some money and played, their policy is not to let you make more than a daily withdrawal of 500 euros, my first withdrawal was done normally without there being any "technical problem". I continued depositing more money and won a 1000 in two days as was their political withdrawal 1000 which they returned back to my account with the added "technical problem" of mine and without even explaining to me what they owe what is this problem with the result that I continue to play and these funds disappear as if by magic I want the casino to compensate me with the amount of my withdrawals as I am not responsible for the technical problems that were deliberately invoked and without ionizing it I welcome any explanation In addition, the fact that they have closed my so-called 24/7 support, which has made me even more sure that they are scammers</p>
