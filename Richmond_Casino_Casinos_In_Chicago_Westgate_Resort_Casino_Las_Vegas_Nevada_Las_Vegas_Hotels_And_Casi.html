<p>Baltimore Ravens Partners up with BetMGM</p>
<p>The Baltimore Ravens have signed a multi-year partnership deal with BetMGM, a leader in the gaming industry. Under the agreement, BetMGM will become the team’s first official gaming partner. Fans will have access to co-branded promotions and BetMGM’s brand will be visible on digital media channels, social media content, and on M&amp;T Bank Stadium. The company will have a private suite within the stadium, and its app will feature the team’s special promotions and campaigns.</p>
<p>Ravens chief sales officer Kevin Rochlitz stated that one of the top priorities for the team is to find new ways to engage with its fans. The Ravens anticipate working together with BetMGM and look forward to the new innovative entertainment experience the company will provide to the team’s fans.</p>
<p>BetMGM chief revenue officer Matt Prevost said that The Ravens are a football team and an organization with a rich history. The company is proud to become the team’s first official partner in the gaming industry.</p>
<p>Maryland Legalized Sports Betting in 2020</p>
<p>Maryland voters approved sports betting legalization in November 2020. Even though mobile and land-based sports wagering are now legal in the state, lawmakers are still working on the industry’s regulation.</p>
<p>In April, the Senate approved the amended House Bill 940 during the State General Assembly and sent it to Gov. Larry Hogan for a signature. According to lawmakers, they are right on track, and sports betting would go live in time for the NFL season.</p>
<p>It’s an exciting time for Maryland, as its casinos reported a record revenue last month with a total amount of $162 million for last month, which was $16.78 million more than in April 2019. MGM alone saw a revenue of $58.217 million, which was a significant increase compared to $10.38 million in 2019.</p>
<p>BetMGM Continues to Expand Responsibly</p>
<p>BetMGM continues its expansion, but its primary focus remains on responsible gambling. The company provides resources, helping its customers to play.</p>
<p>In April, BetMGM announced that it would integrate GameSense, a responsible gaming program, in 2021. The program, developed by British Columbia Lottery Corporation (BCLC), will see its first utilization in the US through its agreement with BetMGM.</p>
<p>Recently, Pennsylvania became one of the few states in the US to feature BetMGM Poker and Borgata Poker after BetMGM launched its partypoker apps in the US. Тhe apps offer players reward programs and benefits.</p>
<p>MGM National Harbor, President &amp; Chief Operating Officer Jorge Perez stated that BetMGM’s collaboration with Baltimore Raves comes at a subliminal time for MGM National Harbor as a company, as it enters the newly-legalized sports wagering market in Maryland. As the team’s new official partner, BetMGM has confidence that it will provide The Ravens’ fans an immersive experience before the football season starts and even after the games.</p>
