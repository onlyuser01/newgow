<p>As Sightline continues to advocate for the adoption of cashless sports betting solutions, Nevada drops an idea to enable remote sports betting registration in the Silver State.</p>
<p>Sightline Never Tried to Push Remote Registration</p>
<p>An amendment to potentially enable remote registration for sports betting activities in Nevada is now dead, reports Ellen Schmidt from the Las Vegas Review-Journal. The idea, which was introduced in September, and sought to alleviate some of the pandemic-wreaked havoc has ultimately crashed and burned suggests the Las Vegas Review-Journal.</p>
<p>Originally submitted by Sightline Payments LLC and Sightline Interactive LLC, which have been launching digital payment solutions across the United States, the proposal has now been mothballed and may not pick back up soon.</p>
<p>One of the reasons why seems to be the fact that Nevada relies heavily on land-based operations and introducing digital or remote opportunities may pave the way down to an interactive industry that could ultimately hurt the Silver State.</p>
<p>Responding to Schmidt, though, Sightline co-founder Omer Sattar explained that Sightline was not seeking and never had been seeking to introduce remote registration. In the email exchange with the Las Vegas-Review Journal, Sattar confirmed the goal set out by his company, and specifically to introduce cashless options for patrons on casino floors pertaining to slot machines and table games.</p>
<p>Cashless to Lead the Way in Casinos</p>
<p>Sightline has teamed up with Boyd Gaming and Aristocrat to introduce more cashless solutions, something the company has been advocating for from the onset of the pandemic. It’s hardly the first company with interests in the casino industry to have done so.</p>
<p>The American Gaming Association (AGA) has been pushing for the adoption of more cashless solutions as a way to reduce the potential threat of transmission since very early into the pandemic. AGA boss Bill Miller has confirmed that making such solutions possible was one of the top priorities undertaken by the company.” He further added:</p>
<p>“The COVID-19 pandemic made it all the more important for us to advance our efforts to provide customers with the payment choice they are more comfortable with and have increasingly come to expect in their daily lives.” -AGA CEO Bill Miller</p>
<p>There have been numerous calls for cashless solutions already. IGT received approval for a cashless wallet in Nevada in 2020. Morongo casino in California has also embraced digital payments as a way to minimize the on-site risk of transmission of covid-19.</p>
<p>In June 2020, AGA stated that it would seek to push the case for more cashless technologies used in payment.</p>
