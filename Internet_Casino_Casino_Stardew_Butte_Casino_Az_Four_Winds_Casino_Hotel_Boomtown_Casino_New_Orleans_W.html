    <h1>Internet Casino Casino Stardew Butte Casino Az Four Winds Casino Hotel Boomtown Casino New Orleans W</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am self excluded with gamstop. And I have had ongoing problems with gambling addiction and mental health problems over the past year.</p>
<p>I have taken steps to recover from the above hence why I registered with Gamstop. However in March I relapsed and I was able to create an account with William hill. I gambled Â£1600 in the space of 24hours all my details were as shown on gamstop. And no verification or safe gambling tips were carried out by William hill.</p>
<p>I contacted them to tell them if my gamstop and to close my account before I further gambled anymore money. I requested a refund due to their lack of highlighting the above information and protecting me as a vulnerable individual.</p>
<p>this has now been ongoing since March they have stopped replying to my emails. I have provided them with my gamstop certificate which was emailed to them via gamstop themselves and then they suddenly stopped replying.</p>
