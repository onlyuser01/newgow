    <h1>Mandalay Bay Resort And Casino Best Slots To Play At Casino Casino Waukegan Parx Casino Poker Hotels</h1>

<p>Dear Steliyan,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. I have checked the terms and conditions, and this is what I found (here).</p>
<p>„3.4. All Customers should at all times be able to guarantee not to be:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Acting on behalf of a third party</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Depositing money of unclear origin</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Depositing money through a credit card which they are not authorized to use or knowingly receiving money from such credit card.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using the services, offered by AE Group B.V., for money laundering."</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Please understand that this rule has been breached. Some exceptions might be allowed by casinos when depositing or withdrawing funds using a joint card or this possibility is communicated beforehand. Technically it is very difficult to check who’s the owner of the payment method at the depositing stage. This can be checked only during the account verification, which is usually done when a withdrawal is requested. Therefore, it is a player’s responsibility to use allowed payment methods only.</p>
<p>If you’re not able to prove that you are a legitimate owner of the payment method and you haven’t received approval from the casino allowing you to use a third-party payment method, I’m afraid there’s not much we can do for you.</p>
<p>Thank you very much in advance for your reply and understanding.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
