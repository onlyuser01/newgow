    <h1>Who Owns Hard Rock Casino Bally S Quad Cities Casino Hotel The Palms Casino Parx Casino In Bensalem</h1>

<p>BetGames has struck a new partnership for content distribution with Salsa Technology, targeting Latin America. The alliance will allow the pair to work together on the distribution of BetGames products across key LatAm markets, including Mexico and Colombia, and help expand its footprint in the region.</p>
<p>Adding More iGaming Content to Latin America</p>
<p>Salsa Technology will use its namesake platforms, Salsa Omni, Salsa Studio, and Salsa Gator, to allow BetGames to debut its products in the targeted markets and bring them across a range of devices. This is not least thanks to Salsa Technology’s own status as a licensed party in Latin America and the markets that BetGames is now exploring itself.</p>
<p>Commenting on this launch, BetGames COO Aiste Garneviciene noted that the company was happy to be entering this partnership with Salsa, praising the tech company’s powerful tech suite and position in the Latin American region.</p>
<p>“Striking a deal with a company well-positioned in a market like LatAm is great news for our partners and us. With full integration, players can now enjoy our industry-leading fixed-odds betting games in the continent’s key regulated markets.”</p>
<p>Salsa and BetGames are looking to make the biggest splash possible in the market, which includes multichannel releases, such as launches on desktop, mobile, and retail.</p>
<p>Salsa Technology Praises New Partner Studio</p>
<p>This is a good arrangement that will allow BetGames to scale up quickly across markets it has an interest in and for Salsa Games to continue providing the flexible and diverse content offer.</p>
<p>Salsa Technology COO Alberto Alfieri commented on the partnership, commending BetGames for their outstanding gaming portfolio. Alfieri is confident that the products will fit well with Salsa Gator.</p>
<p>“We’re always looking to enhance our iGaming offering, and we cannot wait to start seeing results now the integration work is done,” Alfieri concluded. Alfieri was appointed at Salsa back in March and has presided over the company’s Latin American and European expansions. Under his stewardship, BetGames managed to enter Georgia.</p>
