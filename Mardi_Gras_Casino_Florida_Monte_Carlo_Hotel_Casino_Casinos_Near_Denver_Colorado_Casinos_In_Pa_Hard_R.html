<p>The American Gaming Association said that is very important for sports media companies to promote safer gambling</p>
<p>The SportsGrid Network has joined forces with the American Gaming Association to promote its responsible gambling campaign. As a result, the streaming network will promote the Have A Game Plan. Bet Responsibly. initiative across its platform.</p>
<p>The partnership will see SportsGrid leverage its website, app, multimedia content platform and live programming to help the campaign’s message reach more Americans.</p>
<p>Have A Game Plan. Bet Responsibly. was originally launched in 2019. As its name suggests, the program seeks to teach consumers to be responsible when wagering on sports. To that end, the program outlines a few guidelines that people can follow to make sure they don’t become problem gamblers.</p>
<p>These principles are as follows:</p>
<p>Set a budget and stick to it</p>
<p>Keep it social – sports betting is a form of entertainment for adults</p>
<p>know the odds</p>
<p>Play with legal, regulated operators</p>
<p>These principles are clear and easy to follow, making it easier for players to enjoy sports betting without risking gambling harm.</p>
