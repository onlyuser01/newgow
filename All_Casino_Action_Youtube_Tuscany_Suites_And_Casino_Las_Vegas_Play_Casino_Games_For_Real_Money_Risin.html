<p>Inspired Entertainment has struck a partnership with Rush Street Interact to provide the company with its signature style content, integrated directly with the operator’s game platform. Inspired Entertainment currently holds licenses to operate in multiple states across the United States. As a result, Inspired will be launching its products with RSI in New Jersey, Michigan, and West Virginia among other authorized jurisdictions where the partnership will take effect.</p>
<p>Popular Products with Local Gamers</p>
<p>Inspired is confident that its products have been well-received across the American market and is now moving into the three aforementioned states and beyond, enjoying the approval of local players. Specifically, the company will be launching four distinct titles, among which will be Christmas Cashpots, Big Spin Bonus, and Santa King. Big Spin Bonus has been Inspired’s top performer.</p>
<p>Inspired COO and president Brooks Pierce has commented on the development and argued that RSI is a well-established operator with an established footprint in key gaming markets in across North America. Pierce added:</p>
<p>“This framework agreement allows us to launch our content with RSI in multiple markets and grow our North American presence. We are excited to expand our reach in the future with additional North American jurisdictions where Rush Street operates.” Inspired COO and president Brooks Pierce</p>
<p>Rush Street has an established pedigree in the American gaming market, having joined the online casino market in New Jersey with PlaySugarHouse.com back in 2016. The company led the way in Pennsylvania when the Keystone State launched its own regulated iGaming market and the BetRivers.com platform has been the company’s leading sports betting platform in the country.</p>
<p>RSI’s Reach Goes Beyond the US</p>
<p>RSI is also running online gaming activities in Colorado, Indiana, and Illinois, but the company is also expanding across Latin America through a recent entry in Colombia with its RushBet.co brand which encompasses both an online casino and a sportsbook.</p>
<p>Rush Bet is also an exclusive partner with LaLiga as part of a Latin American partnership between the sports league and the operator.</p>
<p>RSI CEO Richard Schwartz has welcomed the opportunity to be expanding portfolio with more games from Inspired:</p>
<p>“We pride ourselves on our exceptional content and the premier experience we offer our customers. Inspired has proven to be a top iGaming provider and we are looking forward to working with them on delivering an innovative online entertainment experience to our loyal players.” RSI CEO Richard Schwartz</p>
<p>Inspired has been well-represented and active across numerous verticals as well. The company’s Q3 results have also shown resilience and Inspired’s market and product strength.</p>
