<p>Golden Nugget and High 5 Games have expanded their New Jersey partnership to now cover the Michigan iGaming market expected to launch in 2021.</p>
<p>High 5 Games Secures Michigan License, Golden Nugget Alliance</p>
<p>High 5 Games, a content developer for the iGaming industry, has obtained a license from the Michigan Gaming Control Board, allowing the company to tie-up a strategic alliance with Golden Nugget Online Casino and other iGaming establishments in the Great Lakes State.</p>
<p>The partnership comes ahead of an anticipated launch for the iGaming industry due to take place in early 2021, with the full suite of casino games now available to partner entities in the state, High 5 Games confirmed in a press release.</p>
<p>Commenting on these developments, High 5 Games CEO Anthony Singer said that the company was ready to build up on years of success in New Jersey and translate that experience into success for Golden Nugget and Michigan operators in general.</p>
<p>Launching in Michigan, Singer said, was a “no brainer,” referring to the company’s expertise in the segment. High 5 Games is distinguished as an Operator of the Year for multiple years now and Golden Nugget is the right choice to move the online casino experience a step further, Singer said.</p>
<p>Working on a New Jersey license has been exciting for the company and the knowledge is easily transferrable, Singer reminded. Meanwhile, Golden Nugget Online Gaming Senior Director Warren Steven shared the company’s excitement to be teaming up with High 5 Games, calling it one of the integral parts of Golden Nugget’s success in the Garden State. He had this to add:</p>
<p>“We’re excited to extend our relationship to Michigan where goldennuggetcasino dot com will continue to demonstrate our never-ending commitment to our players by providing them with the best online casino experience.” -Golden Nugget Online Gaming Senior Director Warren Steven</p>
<p>More Success for High 5 Games in iGaming</p>
<p>High 5 Games has been one of the first entries into the regulated iGaming market and has been present in New Jersey since 2012, delivering high-quality casino entertainment products. Earlier this year, High 5 Games teamed up with GAN, a B2B supplier focusing on delivering iGaming software to the land-based US casino industry.</p>
<p>The partnership allowed High 5 to reach new audiences and benefit from the link-up by enjoying access to GAN’s vast distribution network. Meanwhile, High 5 Games secured another worthwhile alliance with SkllOnNet in March this year, landing its portfolio of games to numerous SkillOnNet brands, including but not limited to Lucky Vegas, Slingo, DrückGlück, and PlayOJO.</p>
