    <h1>Buffalo Bills Resort And Casino Majestic Star Casino Grand Casino Coushatta Encore Casino Boston Cae</h1>

<p>unjustified?????? i have been playing for 7 years and this is the biggest win ive ever had and it came at a time that we really could use it, like this was a lifechanging win. not being able to work in the field that i went to university for for over 2 years because of a the pandemic, and as a result it has cut my income into 1/4. My father came down wit covid 3 months ago and was induced into a coma for the last 2 and a half months so he hasnt been able to work and ive had to take care of my parents this whole time. Now he gets out and needs to be on all sorts of expensive ass medication and needs constant care just to do daily activities which means i need to hire a caregiver. And randomly my mother and i decide to throw in a couple bucks because we had nooooo idea how we were gonna pay for alll of it. Then out of no where i hit that f<strong><em>*</em>g massive win..... the relief and insane amount of happiness we both had for all of 2 days was just wild. then i talk to live chat after giving them alllllll the information they asked for and right before both our eyes they drained my account and im not sure if youve ever been in a room with two people both having extreme anxiety and panic attacks,,,, but it might have been the worst moment of our lives. the money that was on that business account was money that i f</strong><strong>*g worked my ass off for, the person whos name is on the card was sitting right beside me and gave fulll consent to using it, it even has the same last name and same address as me on file. Like all it would take is for any one of the completely useless assholes at supremo casino to just take a second and maybe just phone the cardholder and say hey did this guy commit fraud on your card or were you aware of the transaction..... and when she said nope no fraud was commited.... then i might have 15 thousand dollars right now. but instead they chose to be cheap ass greedy little douchebags and take away money that would seriously impact a families life. i really hope some people see this and maybe have had a similiar experience where a heartless greedy casino strips hard working people of the money they won over some absolute bulls</strong>t and we can start a bigger conversation and shut down some of the scam artist losers running these sites. so if supremo can see this... i am going to post this story to every single review site, every blog, every forum, every live stream i see that has you guys featured in it, every time i see someone mention the name supremo casino i will post this story so that person can see it. i will reach out to every single person who has a complaint about you and have them do the exact same thing. i dont think you realize just how much you screwed me and my family over.... so i willl not stop until you see some repercussion for doing what you did. social media can bury you, and ive got alot of followers and friends with millions of followers so i hope i can dig this grave deep for your trash can of a casino.</p>
