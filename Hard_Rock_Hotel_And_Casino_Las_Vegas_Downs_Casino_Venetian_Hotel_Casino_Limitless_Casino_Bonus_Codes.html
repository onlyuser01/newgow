<p>Sports betting is now live in Wyoming with DraftKings and BetMGM becoming the first operators to receive licenses to launch in the US state.</p>
<p>Wyoming launched sports betting on 1 September with the Wyoming Gaming Commission first approving DraftKings for an online sports betting license. The state is now the 13th where the sport betting and fantasy sports operator’s mobile sportsbook is available, meaning players in Wyoming can wager on professional and collegiate sports using the DraftKings app.</p>
<p>To commemorate the launch, the operator is offering special promotions to customers in Wyoming related to the University of Wyoming’s opening college football game of the season on 4 September. The state is the third this year to launch the DraftKings online sportsbook, which went live in Virginia and Michigan in January.</p>
<p>DraftKings North America Co-Founder and President Matt Kalish said: "We are thrilled that Wyoming sports bettors have the opportunity to experience the highly accessible and immersive fan experience along with best-in-class consumer protections that our product offers millions of skin-in-the-game sports fans."</p>
<p>BetMGM, the joint venture between Entain and MGM Resorts, became the second operator to launch its online sports betting platform in Wyoming, which is now the 14th state to offer BetMGM’s mobile and online product. The operator mentioned its commitment to responsible gaming education as it continues to expand in the US.</p>
<p>BetMGM CEO Adam Greenblatt added: "We're ecstatic that BetMGM is one of the first mobile sports betting platforms to launch in Wyoming, just in time for the start of the football season. Wyoming is an important state for us as we continue to expand BetMGM's footprint in the West. We're confident that its sports fans will enjoy the BetMGM experience."</p>
<p>With its launch, Wyoming became the first state in 2021 to pass a sports betting bill, after initially passing House Bill 0133 into law this April. The sports betting law requires operators to pay $100,000 for initial permits which are valid for five years, and costs $50,000 renewal fee, while sports betting revenue will be taxed at 10%. The state is now the 23rd to legalize sports betting in the US since PASPA was overturned in May 2018.</p>
