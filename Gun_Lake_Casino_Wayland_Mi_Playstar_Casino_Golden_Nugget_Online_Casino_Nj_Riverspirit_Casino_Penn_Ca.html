<p>Information about deposit bonuses in Sweden</p>
<p>In 2018, the Swedish online gaming industry received a boost. The Swedish Gambling Act broke away from the nation's previously conservative betting industry and welcomed private investment for the first time. This meant that foreign operators could offer services to Swedish customers, alongside domestic firms such as state-owned Svenska Spel.</p>
<p>While Svenska Spel benefit from their past monopoly and still control over half of the country's gambling industry today, the new rules mean there is more competition than ever between online casinos for Swedish customers. These sites often organize special promotions including bonuses for new customers, and the deposit, or welcome bonus is perhaps the most popular of these.</p>
<p>This is normally extra credit that is added to the player's account after they make a deposit. The casino in question normally adds this automatically, but players might need to enter a special code or send a short request email to activate it.</p>
<p>During the Covid pandemic, the Swedish government raised concern about the bonuses and their potential to encourage problem gambling. It announced an online bonus limit of SEK 100, or just under 10 euros, so players in Sweden have a more restricted selection to choose from nowadays.</p>
<p>Despite this, they can still be a nice way to get to know a casino and get a bit of extra money to play with, subject to certain conditions. However, with the changes in law, Swedish casinos can only offer one bonus per player at the time of writing. If that's the deposit bonus, then this will almost certainly just be the welcome bonus — the amount you receive after you make your first deposit.</p>
<p>Note: Remember that deposit bonuses are subject to wagering requirements before you can withdraw any winnings from them. This means you must stake the deposit or bonus amount a certain number of times, such as x30. Check out our How casino bonuses work article for more information about this.</p>
<p>How to find the best deposit bonuses in Swedish online casinos</p>
<p>The purpose of this page is to help you sort through the deposit bonuses available to players in Sweden and find the best one for you.</p>
<p>You can do this by making use of the page's filters which will guide you to your desired bonuses. To start with, you can see the very best deposit bonuses available to you with the 'Recommended' tab selected — these are the ones that are deemed to be the pick of the bunch by the Casino Gurus team, and they'll likely have a high rating. The 'Latest' tab will bring up the newest Swedish deposit bonuses on our system, while 'All' will give you the complete list.</p>
<p>A special thing to look out for the are the bonuses under the 'Exclusive' filter. These are offers reserved just for Casino Guru users and you can claim these by clicking on them and signing up to the casino in question. You should receive the bonus automatically once you're registered but check out the information box to see if you must enter a promo code or contact the casino to activate it. This box will also tell you information about the bonus, such as the maximum bet you can place, or how long you'll have to wait to get it.</p>
<p>One last thing to consider is the casino offering the bonus. While the offer may look awesome, it's important that the site behind it is, too, so click on the casino name in the box and make sure it has a positive rating and review.</p>
