<p>The leading developer of online casino games for the growing iGaming industry, Octoplay, announced a new deal expanding the reach of its leading products. On Tuesday the company confirmed it joined forces with the online casino operator and platform provider, Soft2Bet.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the new collaboration, Octoplay's first five titles have gone live for Soft2Bet customers around Europe. The list of leading games includes Hot Harvest, Disco Dive, Heavy Anchor, Blazing Touch, as well as Pearly Shores, all of which were built on Octoplay's proprietary game server. According to a statement released by the company, the games arrived for Soft2Bet customers after a direct integration was completed.</p>
<p>Daniel Mitton, Soft2Bet's Director of Gaming, said about the latest deal: "Octoplay has been turning heads in the industry since its launch and we're delighted to be among the early adopters to get our hands on the games." Finally, he pointed out: "The partnership aligns with our long-term ambition of building a premium portfolio of titles featuring the very latest in gaming technology and innovation."</p>
<p>Carl Ejlertsson, Octoplay's CEO, was also excited about the collaboration. He explained that the new deal with Soft2Bet helps the company's content reach new audiences in different regulated jurisdictions. Moreover, Ejlertsson deemed the collaboration an important milestone for Octoplay.</p>
<p>"That a successful casino group and platform provider like Soft2Bet is excited about taking our games is a testament to the quality of our games and our unique product vision," said the company's CEO. In conclusion, Ejlertsson predicted further growth for Octoplay this year and hoped that the latest deal will be the first of many to come.</p>
<p>Without any doubt, the collaboration with Soft2Bet will give Octoplay's reach a boost. This is because the leading casino platform currently holds licenses in Ireland, Denmark, Sweden, as well as Malta. What's more, Soft2Bet operates more than 10 sportsbooks, as well as casino brands such as ZulaBet, LightCasino and CampoBet, among others.</p>
<p>The collaboration with Soft2Bet comes after Octoplay made another important announcement recently. Early in February, the company strengthened its senior-level team by hiring Ralitsa Georgieva. Joining Octoplay, she was named the company's new Director of Business Development.</p>
<p>In her role, Georgieva will leverage her industry experience and oversee Octoplay's growth and expansion to new jurisdictions. At the time of the announcement, she explained that the company is "making a significant impact in the industry" and that she will be happy to join Octoplay's CEO, Ejlertsson, and help guide the company to its next level of growth.</p>
