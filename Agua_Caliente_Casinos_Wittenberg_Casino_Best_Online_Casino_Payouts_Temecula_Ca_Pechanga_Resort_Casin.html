<p>Los Angeles FC vs Philadelphia Union is the grand finale of the 2022 MLS season. The winner of the MLS Western Conference takes on the Eastern Conference champion in a battle for the MLS Cup. And it’s going to be a fierce battle, judging by the fact that three of the four LAFC vs Philadelphia games ever played saw four or more goals.</p>
<p>Bookmakers think that’s very likely to happen, giving the odds of -189 on “over 2.5 goals”. They also think LAFC will score most of the goals on Saturday, November 5, as evident from the fact that they’ve made this team the odds-on favorite, priced at -125.</p>
<p>Are they right to think so? Or maybe we’ll see the underdog win?</p>

<p>When, Where, and How to Watch?</p>
<p>Place : Banc of California Stadium in Los Angeles, California</p>
<p>: Banc of California Stadium in Los Angeles, California Date : Saturday, November 5</p>
<p>: Saturday, November 5 Time : 4:00 PM ET</p>
<p>: 4:00 PM ET How to Watch: FOX</p>
<p>Reasons Why Los Angeles FC is the Betting Favorite</p>
<p>Los Angeles FC is the best team in the United States, there’s no arguing about that. The evidence is that this team is the winner of the MLS Supporters Shield – the award for collecting the most points in the regular season.</p>
<p>In fact, we think that LAFC might be the very best soccer team in the Americas. With superstars like Gareth Bale, Carlos Vela, and Giorgio Chiellini, this team looks stronger than any other side in both North and South America.</p>
<p>These players have European experience and have won many big competitions, including the Champions League. That said, you can expect them to shine on Saturday in the 2022 MLS Cup game.</p>
<p>Can Philadelphia Union Upset the Odds?</p>
<p>Philly’s been playing great soccer this season, with their offense being their strongest weapon. They seem capable of scoring against any MLS team, including LAFC. In fact, the last time they played, Philly put away two goals. Unfortunately for them, they also conceded two goals.</p>
<p>Actually, in each of the four LAFC vs Philadelphia matches ever played, Philly’s defense wasn’t great. This team’s record against Los Angeles is 0-3-1 with a score differential of 7-10.</p>
<p>Los Angeles FC vs Philadelphia Union Prediction</p>
<p>LAFC is the better team, but you can be certain that Philly won’t surrender without a fight. On the contrary, the winners of the Eastern Conference will fight back as they always do in the game against Steve Cherundolo’s team.</p>
<p>As a result, we’ll probably see plenty of goals at Banc of California Stadium, very likely on both ends. Still, we do think LAFC will be the team that scores more.</p>
<p>Picks: Los Angeles FC to win &amp; over 2.5 goals</p>
