<p>Dallas Cowboys are Fantastic in the Offense</p>
<p>The Dallas Cowboys secured a spot in the playoffs back in Week 15. Despite losing to the Jacksonville Jaguars 40-34 after overtime, they still booked the ticket to the postseason thanks to the fact that the Washington Commanders lost the same weekend.</p>
<p>Before that loss, they were in a superb run with four straight wins in which they scored a total of 149 points. That accounts for 37.25 points per game on average. Their amazing offensive stats in their period are mostly thanks to their quarterback Dak Prescott.</p>
<p>This is one of the best throws from Dak Prescott this season!</p>
<p>You want to talk about dropping it in the bucket on a dime, this throw is flawless to T.Y. Hilton #DallasCowboys pic.twitter.com/zwAj6heClJ — Kevin Gray Jr. (@KevinGraySports) December 25, 2022</p>
<p>The 29-year-old signal-caller is having the season of his life. He’s playing with confidence, although we did see a couple of his passes get intercepted last month. Nevertheless, it seems that his decision to play risky football has paid out. We expect to see even more from him by the end of the regular season.</p>
<p>Tennessee Titans are Great Defensively</p>
<p>The Titans got to the no.1 position of the AFC South mostly thanks to their amazing defense. Their performances did dip in the last couple of weeks. For instance, we saw them concede 30+ twice in the last five games. As a result, the Titans lost a couple of games they really should’ve won.</p>
<p>As a result, they still haven’t secured a spot in the playoffs, but they’re very close to achieving that. This goes especially if they manage to beat the Cowboys on Thursday.</p>
<p>The bad news is that the Cowboys are the kind of team they usually struggle to beat. Even though the Titans are good defensively, they might not be good enough to stop Prescott &amp; Co. Further, their offense just looks too anemic to do much damage to Dallas’ defense.</p>
<p>Dallas Cowboys vs Tennessee Titans Prediction</p>
<p>The Titans are in a need of a win, but the quality is on the side of the Cowboys. Anything can happen in this game, but our vote goes to the visitors. Prescott and his teammates just seem impossible to handle at this moment.</p>
<p>Picks: Dallas Cowboys to win and cover the spread</p>
