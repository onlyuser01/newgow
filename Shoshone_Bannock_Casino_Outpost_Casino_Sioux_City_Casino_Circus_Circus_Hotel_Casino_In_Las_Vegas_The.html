    <h1>Shoshone Bannock Casino Outpost Casino Sioux City Casino Circus Circus Hotel Casino In Las Vegas The</h1>

<p>Hello Phil,</p>
<p>Thank you for your feedback.</p>
<p>I’ve been in touch with a concerned representative regarding the matter and was informed that the Payout requests from your side have been completed while using different BTC wallet addresses for each request. As I understand, you have a dynamic BTC wallet which changes with every transaction. As it is crucial for us to make sure the provided wallet is the right one to use, the Casino representatives are obliged to confirm the wallet each time before the approval, to make sure that the funds can be received with no issues. In case you would like to receive your winnings to a different BTC wallet each time, please confirm it with the Billing team to avoid any additional confirmations. We’ll do our best to be in touch so any changes come through the fastest possible.</p>
<p>Moreover, I’ve been informed that the rest of your winnings has been approved for Payout, so you will receive it within 24 hours as max time frame.</p>
<p>Should you have any questions please let us know.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Red Dog Casino Team</p>
