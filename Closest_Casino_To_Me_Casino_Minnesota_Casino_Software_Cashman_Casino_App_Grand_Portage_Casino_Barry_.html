<p>BetMGM has appointed NFL Hall of Famer Barry Sanders as an official brand ambassador for its brand in Michigan.</p>
<p>Detroit Lions’ Barry Sanders Joins BetMGM in Michigan</p>
<p>MGM and Entain continue to develop their partnership through BetMGM with the sportsbook now signing retired running back and Pro Football Hall of Fame player Barry Sanders as an official brand ambassador for the company in Michigan.</p>
<p>The former Detroit Lions ace will bolster BetMGM’s marketing efforts in the Great Lakes State and participate in various marketing activations designed to shine the limelight on BetMGM, one of the fastest-developing sports betting firms in the United States.</p>
<p>Commenting on the opportunity this partnership presented, BetMGM chief revenue officer Matt Prevost simply said that it’s an honor to have Sanders onboard:</p>
<p>“Adding Barry to the BetMGM family brings a new level of excitement and the potential for us to create unique experiences for our customers.” BetMGM chief revenue officer Matt Prevost</p>
<p>BetMGM has already existing ties with Detroit Lions, which it’s an official sponsor for. Sanders is the right person to tap for the job of ambassador, as the former running back has 10 years in the National Football League (NFL) and he has been instrumental in many of the Lions’ own successes.</p>
<p>Taking the opportunity to express his own satisfaction with the partnership, Sanders said that he was excited to be a part of the BetMGM team and help its business expand. Here is what Sanders had to add:</p>
<p>“Typically, I am the one breaking records in Michigan, but it is amazing to see what BetMGM already has accomplished in my home state.” NFL Detroit Lions former running back Barry Sanders</p>
<p>BetMGM’s footprint across the United States has been expanding at a good clip. The company signed with Richard Childress Racing, a NASCAR competitive outfit earlier this week.</p>
<p>The company signed an interesting partnership with The Athletic, a paid and highly-respected sports publication in the United States, to reach new audiences and help The Athletic kickstart a dedicated section for sports wagering.</p>
<p>All of this comes with the company expecting higher revenue forecasts in 2020 with another important entry in Virginia secured.</p>
