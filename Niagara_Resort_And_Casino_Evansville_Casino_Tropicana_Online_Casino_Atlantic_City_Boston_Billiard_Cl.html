<p>Australian sports betting operator PointsBet announced its sports betting app would now feature clips focused on betting events via the company’s new content hub, PointsBet+.</p>
<p>‘Sports Betting and Content Go Hand-In-Hand’</p>
<p>Pointsbet+, the first-of-its-kind content experience within a sports betting app, will also provide access to individual custom-curated feeds as PointsBet is looking to build on its leading position in live betting and further enhance the offering of its app.</p>
<p>Liam Roecklein, PointsBet USA’s senior vice president of Content, outlined that “sports betting and content go hand-in-hand,” explaining that the creation of the new content hub is going to set a new industry standard.</p>
<p>PointsBet will utilize shows like The Straight Line with Ryan Leaf for its daily content for the app, keeping fans updated on the day’s most important sporting events via 20-25 video-on-demand clips aimed at individual markets, such as spread wagers, same game parlays, and player props, as well as news, insights and analysis to help them make informed betting decisions.</p>
<p>“Getting insights directly from sports figures like Ryan Leaf will be a gamechanger for bettors and help shape both how users wager on and consume sports,” Roecklein continued, adamant that the operator would “delight” its players “by providing them with industry-leading live betting options like Lightning Bets” alongside statistics and insight needed to support their betting decisions.</p>
<p>Pushing the Boundaries within Sports Betting</p>
<p>Commenting on the news, former NFL player and current sports analyst and PointsBet host Ryan Leaf expressed his excitement at the opportunity to be able to deliver clips from The Straight Line to sports fans via the app, outlining PointsBet’s efforts “to push boundaries of what is possible within the sports betting world” by offering sports fans “a more analytical and perceptive way” on how to make their sports betting decisions.</p>
<p>The Pointsbet+ platform will provide refreshed content tailored to individual betting needs on a daily basis curated based on the sporting events occurring that day, bringing information about core markets, player and game props, and PointsBet’s proprietary Points Betting.</p>
<p>To mark the start of the 2022 NFL season, PointsBet released an advertisement that stirred controversy and was deemed unfit for TV broadcasting and forced the operator to create a second edition of the ad while keeping the original version available only on its social media channels.</p>
<p>Earlier in October, PointsBet USA announced a partnership with 1/ST TECHNOLOGY, a North American thoroughbred horse racing business, that will see numerous products of the horse racing company become part of the offer of PointsBet’s subsidiary Premier Turf Club.</p>
