    <h1>Indian Casino Near Me With Slot Machines Riverside Casino Golf Resort Riverside South Point Casino B</h1>

<p>I so unhappy this casino is ridiculous I been a valid customer and online gamer for years now this by far tops all involved with the lack of customer service and clearly the issues with withdrawal !! Not only have I already had a few withdrawal and verified for me to be waiting on latest withdrawal over a month now ? The fact I have been denied or something that my husband payment I used had to be deducted from my withdrawal even after valid payment information allowing such card to be used I have done in the past with this casino !! I then get told that it’s approved by being sent out for the last week now?! I get a offer and a call from whom ever they are saying I can offer you 500 lije a type of negotiation with my use of husband card on deposits? Wow!! Then it’s the next issue I havec2007 in balance I cannot withdrawal payment till this clears and it’s also only for 500 says I can only withdraw 5*the deposit payment which is freakin insane one reason is I never take bonus payment ever and the deposit was 50 and I got yet another offer saying I can only get 500 bucks off a legit win for the money I get to only win 5 times a amount!!!!!! Omg someone help me before I explode on the phone I have even been verified and I lady had a withdrawl of 2000 let’s say few months ago and it came out fast to bitcoin wallet and I assure you I didn’t add 200 bucks to be able to withdrawl it at 2000 one needs to have deposited 200 correct? They seem to be able to withdrawl or make customers happy when they are ready it’s not fair not really right they should be ashamed of themselves and I want the money for both as I legitimately have win the money no bonus no reason to deny me of my money!!</p>
