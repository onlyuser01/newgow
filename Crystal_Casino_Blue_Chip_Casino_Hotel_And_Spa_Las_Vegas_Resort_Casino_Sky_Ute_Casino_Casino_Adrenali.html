    <h1>Crystal Casino Blue Chip Casino Hotel And Spa Las Vegas Resort Casino Sky Ute Casino Casino Adrenali</h1>

<p>Hello</p>
<p>I am a gambling addict, and between 30/10 - 03/11 i was allowed to deposit and gamble 93,13805789 LTC (17.865,76$) i lost everything i got and was mad, so i reached out to the support operator concerning i was allowed to deposit this much with no questions asked by Casino, and requested my account closed and deposits minus withdrawals refunded, Emma / Support chat operator confirmed that my request was forwarded.</p>
<p>On 30-11-2021 it was payday and i accessed their website. I could not access the sportsbetting page, it was blank. I reached out to the support chat, and they tell me that Denmark IP has been restricted for all providers. But right after Emma writes to me 'Please change IP address to access casino services' instead of telling me that i cannot use their website as they should.</p>
<p>On 30-11-2021 after this, i was allowed to deposit my paycheck and lose it within hours. This time i reached out to the support again, i was mad because losing whole pay-check and wanted out but i also needed the money for bills, so i informed them that i think it was bad faith for the support operator to instantly encourage me to keep using their site well knowingly that i have lost previous and encourage me to use alternative methods when i did not know it was an option. I wrote that because she confirms my country is restricted, i want to close my betting account.</p>
<p>This is now second time i asks them to close my account, and meanwhile they also actively instantly encourage me to use alternative methods to keep using their site, even when they admit my country was restricted, they allowed me to deposit from danish IP. Doing this time i was allowed to deposit big amounts, asking for bonuses several times which should have given multiple red flags, and asked for account closure multiple times.</p>
<p>So during the time i have been in contact with support operators multiple times asking for bonuses after losses, asked them to close my account twice and they ignore country restrictions and actively encourage me to use another IP just seconds after they write that the country is restricted.</p>
<p>Going into December i had a tough time and personal issues, and i was able to gather a big loan and since FortuneJack was the only site that have not closed my account. Since the casino did not close my account and even restricted my country, i was able to deposit and lose the loan which should have been used otherwise, they allowed deposits and loses of 59,09 LTC (Almost 10.000$).</p>
<p>After this i reached out to the Casino Operator regading this case, and suddenly they write back to me that my account is now closed, but they refuse to give me a reason. Because if it is because of closing account request, they should have done so on 7. November or at latest 1. December when requested it second time, when given clear signs and writing requests for account closure and refunds multiple times the casino ignored clear signs.</p>
<p>I have screenshots of all communication with Casino operator and also downloaded the full chat in their chat-system, so i have all communications.</p>
<p>Deposits and losses on 30. November (deposit minutes withdrawals): 6,40067218 LTC (USD 1024$ with market value at the deposit time)</p>
<p>Deposits and losses on 11-12 December (deposit minutes withdrawals): 57,00196482 LTC (USD 9120$ with market value at the deposit time)</p>
<p>If Casino Operator did close my account back on 7. November where i clearly asked them that i wanted a refund and my account closed, i would not have been able to deposit and lose in total 63,402637 LTC (10.144$ with the market value at the deposit time). But i can accept that the request is regarding losses made after 30. November which was second time i requested account closed, even when i did request my account closed on 7. november and wrote clearly back then for a refund and account closure.</p>
<p>Furthermore i would also like to add that the Casino Operator has no landingpage or information regarding responsible gaming on their website.</p>
<p>If this is not clear evidence of bad faith and break of the responsible gaming by casino operator, being allowed to deposits tens of thausands of dollars, requesting bonuses multiple times after losses, requesting account closed and asking for refunds for all deposits multiple times, no matter the reason for closure it should be taken seriously by casino operator, when also expressing clear dissatisfaction and Casino operator having no responsible gaming policy - Furthermore there should also have been several reports of unusual transactions looking at the Curacao Gaming Control Board laws as transactions above 5000 naf (2800$) should be deemed unusual which should also have given even more red-flags on top of it all.</p>
