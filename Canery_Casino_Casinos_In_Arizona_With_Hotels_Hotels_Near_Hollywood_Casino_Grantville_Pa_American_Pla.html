    <h1>Canery Casino Casinos In Arizona With Hotels Hotels Near Hollywood Casino Grantville Pa American Pla</h1>

<p>888AFRICA first entered the African market in March 2022, formed as part of a joint venture, and led by former The Stars Group CMO Christopher Coyne, who has been the company’s Chief Executive Officer ever since. Under his watch, 888FRICA made a series in entries into several markets in the region, including Kenya, Tanzania, Mozambique, and Zambia in October 2022.</p>
<p>Now, the company is further strengthening its presence in the region through the acquisition of BetLion, an important local operator that has its roots deep in the African continent, and an opportunity for 888AFRICA to continue expanding with renewed strength.</p>
<p>This acquisition has been welcomed by the Chief Executive who described the deal as a "critical step" in achieving the joint venture’s further growth and strategic goals in the market. As Coyne puts it, 888AFRICA is determined to establish a market-leading position all across the continent and this requires staff, operational capabilities, and a strong pull with local audiences, such as the one that BetLion has been able to cultivate.</p>
<p>BetLion is also a multinational operator, which opens up access to new audiences for 888Africa and makes it possible to add to the company’s growth momentum. BetLion MD Robert Chirchir was similarly excited to see the company become a part of 888Africa’s growth journey in Africa and help create more experiences that delight customers.</p>
<p>Chirchir also sees 888AFRICA as a business that was established with the purpose of pursuing significant strategic gains on the continent – something that BetLion will be able to contribute to as well. Coyne similarly praised the talent and team found at BetLion, arguing that the existing teams would significantly strengthen 888AFRICA’s local presence through the exchange of knowledge and expertise.</p>
<p>BetLion is also operational in several jurisdictions in the continent, adding to 888AFRICA’s existing footprint with Kenya, Zambia, and the Democratic Republic of theCongo, and coinciding in part with the parent company’s existing footprint. Africa has already been attracting experience from international brands with 888 Holdings hardly the only one to make a dedicated move in the region.</p>
<p>Entain, a well-established rival to 888 Holdings, also launched its signature Bwin brand in Zambia in November, a month after 888AFRICA’s arrival. However, Entain has been more ginger about expanding in the continent whereas 888 seems to be moving forward more confidently and determinedly.</p>
