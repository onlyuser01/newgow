<p>It seems that Kick has made gambling streams a mandatory requirement for specific high-profile streamers on their platform</p>
<p>Popular Call of Duty streamer Nick “NICKMERCS” Kolcheff has announced his foray into gambling streams on the Twitch rival platform, Kick. Kolcheff, a co-owner of Faze Clan, recently signed a lucrative non-exclusive deal with Kick, reportedly worth eight figures. During his first livestream on the platform, he confirmed the inclusion of gambling streams, citing it as a contractual obligation.</p>
<p>High-Profile Kick Streamers Are Obliged to Host Gambling Streams</p>
<p>While many were taken aback by this unexpected turn, it appears that gambling streams are, in fact, a stipulated requirement for certain high-profile streamers on Kick. The platform, backed by Stake.com, one of the leading gambling platforms in the industry, seems to have made gambling an integral part of its content strategy.</p>
<p>Kolcheff, addressing his viewers during the livestream, revealed that he would be conducting gambling streams in the future. He mentioned that he would not be doing a lot but confirmed that some gambling streams were definitely planned, emphasizing that it was a part of the contract. He also revealed that these streams will be conducted from a secret location outside the United States, as legal constraints prevent such activities within the country.</p>
<p>The collaboration between Kick and Stake.com has raised questions about the ethical implications of promoting gambling to a wide audience, especially considering the ban imposed on gambling sites by Twitch in 2022. Many prominent Twitch streamers expressed concerns about the promotion of gambling to underage viewers, prompting the ban of several gambling-related sites.</p>
<p>Streamer Investments and Ethical Debates Define Platform Dynamics</p>
<p>Kick, however, seems undeterred by these concerns. The platform, known for its substantial financial investments in securing renowned streamers such as Félix “xQc” Lengyel and Kaitlyn “Amouranth” Siragusa, appears determined to push the boundaries of content creation. Kolcheff’s announcement adds another layer to the platform’s controversial image, already marred by previous incidents involving other streamers and their questionable content.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen how the community will react to this controversial decision. With Kolcheff’s assurance of conducting viewer giveaways using the gambling funds provided by Kick, the streams are bound to attract significant attention, both from fans and critics alike.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in July, Kick addressed concerns about gambling content and view-botting with new updates. Co-founder Ed Craven announced measures to combat view botting, including extra view count protection, emphasizing Kick’s commitment to a fair environment. Kick also introduced a toggle option, allowing users to control their exposure to gambling streams.</p>
