    <h1>Seminole Hard Rock Hotel Casino Hollywood Photos Wyandotte Casino Treasure Valley Casino Chanced Soc</h1>

<p>LuckyKong, could you please send me these proofs as well? Email is rde97@hotmail.com</p>
<p>A summary of the case:</p>
<p>-I notified LuckyKong by email that "I want to close my account permanently due to a gambling problem on 13/04/2022" (there is clear proof of this). There was no response to this email. I remember that I was only offered free money and cashbacks, spins, etc. so that I would play more. (Responsible?) I also asked for these myself. So I was still allowed to play and make deposits.</p>
<p>-I also asked to block again a second time a little later (I had already played a lot in the meantime) and LuckyKong claims that they sent me a link 24 hours after the block, where I could choose between a gradual block and a permanent block. I can't find such messages in my email, and my account still hasn't been closed even though they were aware of my gambling problem and twice I had asked for it.</p>
<p>-After the third email when I asked for permanent blocking, I received a link to the email where I can confirm the permanent self-blocking. So they closed my account only the third time. And they claim that all the responsibility would still have been on me, even though casinos operating under a Curacao license must follow responsible gaming practices.</p>
<p>You are using your own immoral terms of responsible gaming, which you yourself did not follow in this case.</p>
<p>Everyone makes mistakes and only respect grows if you admit that it can happen to you too and you take responsibility for your mistake by reimbursing me these 1300â‚¬ deposits.</p>
