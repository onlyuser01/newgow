<p>Dear arian9595,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. I checked the casino terms and conditions and found this:</p>
<ol>
<li>SELF EXCLUSION</li>
</ol>
<p>In case You are diagnosed with a gambling addiction or try to stay away from gambling for a different reason, we want to assist you to stay away from anything, that does nothing good for you. "Self-Exclusion" means, that You exclude yourself, out of Your own choice, from all gambling services. This exclusion cannot be undone for a set amount of time. If you wish to self-exclude yourself from gambling, please message our support and give them a time span between 6 months and 5 years. They also will explain to you the all future steps and what is needed from you.</p>
<p>• email:support@casinointense.com</p>
<p>Please keep in mind that Self-Exclusion is permanent for the set time span and will not be undone for your own protection.</p>
<p>During Self-Exclusion you are not allowed to create a new Account and every attempt to create a new Account during Self-Exclusion is a violation of our Terms of Service and may result in the permanent ban of your original account.</p>
<p>Have you tried contacting the casino using the email and requesting the self-exclusion that way? Would you be able to forward emails with the original request of self-exclusion to my email tomas@casino.guru?</p>
<p>I hope we will be able to help you to resolve this issue as soon as possible. Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Tomas</p>
