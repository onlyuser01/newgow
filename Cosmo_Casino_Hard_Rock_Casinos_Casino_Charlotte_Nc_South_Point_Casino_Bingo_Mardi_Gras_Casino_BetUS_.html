    <h1>Cosmo Casino Hard Rock Casinos Casino Charlotte Nc South Point Casino Bingo Mardi Gras Casino BetUS</h1>

<p>To whom it may concern,</p>
<p>I have written to you once before. I’m not sure if I can make another complaint about a different casino? I feel like a few of them have really disappointed me by letting me re-open/open new accounts , all the same information except maybe a different email address. This all being after I closed the accounts openly admitting I had a gambling problem and wanted no option to re-open.</p>
<p>Bet US re-opened my account over "10 "times. I did call and the man in charge of security John was very mean to me.</p>
<p>They did give me a refund but not the amount they originally said and certainly not going back to when I first reopened my account. I closed it due to struggling with gambling addiction.</p>
<p>They stated they can only refund amounts to a certain date and they can’t refund bitcoin deposits. I would like to ask you if that’s true? Do I have any retribution on getting more funds returned? I would also like to send you the letter I wrote regarding the way I was treated by the head of security.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Dianne Sawyer</p>
