<p>This week, the company was recommended for an approval for a license to operate sportsbook at Silverton Casino and will now seek approval from the Nevada Gaming Commission</p>
<p>The fast-growing sportsbook, Circa Sports, continues to expand its presence in Nevada. Besides the state, the sportsbook has established operations in other important markets, including Colorado, Iowa and Illinois. Additionally, Circa is expected to enter the betting vertical in Kentucky as well. Earlier this week, the company made progress in its expansion in Nevada, after a meeting with the gambling regulator in the state, the Nevada Gaming Control Board (NGCB).</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the Board recommended Circa for approval for a license for the operation of the Silverton Casino Lodge, located less than five miles from the famous Las Vegas Strip. At the meeting on Wednesday, the NGCB recommended the operator be approved for licensing to operate Silverton.</p>
<p>Circa confirmed its plans to open a temporary sportsbook at the location early next year, possibly on January 1, 2024. However, to proceed further and expand its presence, the sports betting operator would need to secure approval from the Nevada Gaming Commission as well. This approval, Circa expects to secure this at an upcoming meeting with the Commission scheduled for November 16, 2023.</p>
<p>Once this happens, the operator would be cleared to take over the operation of Silverton. Currently, the venue is operated by Caesars Entertainment’s William Hill. Given that Circa secures the approval from the Nevada Gaming Commission, the company confirmed it will prepare to launch a temporary sportsbook, while the venue undergoes renovation.</p>
<p>Permanent Sportsbook Expected to Open in March</p>
<p>George Assad, one of NGCB’s members, who was recently cited by CDC Gaming Reports, spoke about the benefits of having Circa sportsbook in Las Vegas. On Wednesday, he explained: “You’re a plus for the entire state and certainly for the downtown area and I’m more than thrilled to approve this application and watch you succeed with your expansion of Circa Sports throughout the country.”</p>
<p>“The sportsbook would include a substantial renovation of the property and be an investment on our part. We plan on hiring all of the individuals and they’ll be Circa Sports employees.“ Derek Stevens, co-owner of Circa Hospitality Group</p>
<p>The revamped Circa sportsbook at Silverton is expected to open its doors just in time for the 2024 March Madness, confirmed this week the co-owner of the Circa Hospitality Group, the company operating Circa Sports, Derek Stevens. He explained that this project includes a significant renovation of the property. Moreover, Stevens said that Circa is prepared for the investment required for this renovation. Finally, he said that the company is also planning to hire the people who would be employed by the new sportsbook.</p>
