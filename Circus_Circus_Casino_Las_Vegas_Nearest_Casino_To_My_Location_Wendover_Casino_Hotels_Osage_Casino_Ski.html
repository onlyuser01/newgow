<p>The Chelsea vs. Brighton odds suggest we’re going to witness a big battle on the field of Stamford Bridge on Sunday, December 3, 2023</p>
<p>Brighton are coming to London after four Premier League games with zero losses. The Seagulls are taking on Chelsea, whose form isn’t too impressive, but the Blues have put on some really great performances lately (e.g., a 4-4 draw with Man City, a 4-1 win over Tottenham, etc.). Judging by the Chelsea vs. Brighton EPL odds, the boys from London are set for another brilliant game.</p>
<p>Chelsea vs. Brighton Odds</p>
<p>Moneyline Odds Chelsea -143 Draw +333 Brighton +320</p>
<p>Goals Total Odds Over 2.5 -189 Under 2.5 +140 *Odds taken from bet365 on Wednesday, November 29.</p>
<p>When, Where, and How to Watch?</p>
<p>Place : Stamford Bridge in London, England</p>
<p>: Stamford Bridge in London, England Date : Sunday, December 3, 2023</p>
<p>: Sunday, December 3, 2023 Time : 9:00 AM ET</p>
<p>: 9:00 AM ET How to Watch: Peacock</p>
<p>Reasons Why Chelsea’s Odds are -143</p>
<p>When the Chelsea vs. Brighton odds were released, the Blues from London were priced at +100. However, they’re now -143, the reason being that their form has improved significantly.</p>
<p>Mauricio Pochettino’s men are 4-4-5 in the 2023 English Premier League (EPL), but we saw them do very well in a couple of recent games. In their first EPL game in November, they destroyed Tottenham 4-1 on the road. Then, they played 4-4 with the reigning champions Manchester City.</p>
<p>Mauricio Pochettino on his/Jackson's suspensions: "(Jackson) had to run (for his punishment)," Pochettino revealed. "And I am going to pay for a dinner because I got suspended and I cannot run, so I prefer to pay."

<p>In that game, he received a yellow card for which he had to let his assistant Jesus Perez lead the team in the previous EPL round. Without Poch in the dugout, the Blues lost 4-1 to Newcastle.</p>
<p>But he’s back now and his team’s expected to do very well. After all, Poch has a very good record against Brighton. As a Tottenham manager, he was 5-1-1 against the Seagulls. Now, he’s ready to take on Brighton for the first time as Chelsea manager.</p>
<p>Brighton Hoping to Get the Good Run Going</p>
<p>The Seagulls are undefeated in the last five Chelsea vs. Brighton duels in the Premier League. However, their squad has changed a lot since their last duel with the Blues. In fact, a couple of former Brighton players are now playing for Chelsea – Robert Sanchez, Marc Cucurella, Moises Caicedo, etc.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Brighton are doing pretty well in the 2023-24 Premier League. They’re 6-4-3, with just two points fewer than the closest team in the top six. They’re also in very good form, with no losses in the Prem since October.</p>
<p>Truth be told, they haven’t had too tough a schedule lately, with the Chelsea vs. Brighton game being their, by far, toughest duel in more than a month.</p>
<p>Chelsea vs. Brighton Prediction</p>
<p>We predict that this is going to be a real spectacle, probably with some goals on both ends. Still, we do believe the Blues will end up winning all three points.</p>
<p>Chelsea’s roster is just better than the one of Brighton. Plus, they play at home and are super motivated to get themselves in the contest for a spot in Europe.</p>
<p>Pick: Chelsea &amp; over 2.5 goals</p>
