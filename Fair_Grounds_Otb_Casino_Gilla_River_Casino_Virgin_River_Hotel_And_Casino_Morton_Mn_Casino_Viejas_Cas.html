    <h1>Fair Grounds Otb Casino Gilla River Casino Virgin River Hotel And Casino Morton Mn Casino Viejas Cas</h1>

<p>Dear CasinoGuru Team and Artep55,</p>
<p>Thank you for your feedback.</p>
<p>We sincerely regret that this situation happened and that you have doubts about our service and casino.</p>
<p>However, we would like to clarify the situation and our rules in more detail.</p>
<p>According to our casino policy, every player must go through the verification process before withdrawing funds and provide us with all the necessary documents, because this is a very responsible and important process.</p>
<p>As we can see, your account is still in the process of verification and you have been asked for additional documents because you have used third-party payments for deposits in our casino, which is strictly prohibited by our rules - https://boomerang-casino4.com/ru/rules:</p>
<p>4.1 The credit/debit card or any other payment method that you use to top up your account balance belongs to you, is not stolen and has not been lost by another person.</p>
<p>Moreover, according to our policy - https://boomerang-casino.com/en/rules:</p>
<p>6.16 The company may delay the processing of your withdrawal requests to perform checks on your identity, account balance, source of funds, and of your compliance with the Terms and Conditions.</p>
<p>Since you did not provide the requested document but only provided an explanation for it, these explanations have been accepted for further investigation.</p>
<p>As for the request to change the data, according to our Terms and Conditions, it cannot be done in the chat, only through an official request by mail, where your personal information has to be indicated.</p>
<p>In addition, as we can see, our manager informed you in the chat that you need to write a request to us by mail and indicated exactly what personal data you need to provide in the text form, but unfortunately, we didn`t receive a full request.</p>
<p>Also, we would like to inform you that we have written you a letter and requested information again, in order to process your request as soon as possible, so please check your email and we will await for your reply.</p>
<p>We are always happy and ready to help, however, we also have rules and conditions under which we operate.</p>
<p>We hope we have managed to explain the situation to you in more detail.</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Boomerang Casino Team</p>
