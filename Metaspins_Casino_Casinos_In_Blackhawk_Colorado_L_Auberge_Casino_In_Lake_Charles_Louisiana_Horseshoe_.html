<p>The supplier of content, technology, hardware and services for the gaming industry Inspired Entertainment announced the launch of its virtual basketball game in Greece. V-Play Basketball is set to become the third channel of virtual sports, alongside V-Play Soccer 3.0 and Matchday, as it is already available across the entire OPAP retail estate of nearly 3,700 betting shops.</p>
<p>V-Play Basketball Proved an Immediate Success</p>
<p>The new virtual game addition which includes Euro League and Greek League Basketball is in response to the popularity of basketball in Greece. First launched in 2019, Inspired’s virtual basketball has been immediately adopted, generating incremental revenue upon launch.</p>
<p>“It has been one of our highest-performing products in terms of amount wagered and we expect similar success with OPAP, which has been a great partner and done a terrific job launching new Virtuals into the marketplace.” Brooks Pierce, President and Chief Operating Officer, Inspired Entertainment</p>
<p>The gaming content and technology provider is looking to offer sports betting opportunities for sports fans beyond the end of the sports season with Inspired Virtual Sports, which uses lifelike graphics to mimic the experience of sports betting. Achieved through a technology that has been evolving for nearly two decades, Inspired is offering 90-seconds-long virtual sports betting events designed to be easy to play.</p>
<p>DraftKings and Scientific Games Among Inspired’s Strategic Partners</p>
<p>The company’s achievements in virtual sports received sound recognition in April, when daily fantasy and sports book operator DraftKings signed a contract with Inspired to gain access to its V-Play portfolio. And V-Play Basketball is the game that stands out as the “world’s best virtual basketball product”.</p>
<p>“Basketball is very popular in Greece, and we knew it would be an ideal addition to our Virtual Sports offerings. Inspired has gone above and beyond by customizing this product specifically for our customers, introducing the only Virtual Greek Basketball League. We put our customers at the center of everything we do, and we are pleased to bring them this exclusive offering.” Jan Karas, Acting CEO, OPAP</p>
<p>In June, Inspired’s portfolio of virtual sports offering received another boost, as the company entered into a licensing agreement with Scientific Games, to roll out the portfolio of virtual games across the OpenMarket sports betting aggregation platform.</p>
<p>The virtual portfolio of Inspired became earlier this month the first virtual to be authorized in Turkey on behalf of the Turkish National Lottery. Inspired will provide its complete end-to-end online virtual sports book product, V-Play Plug &amp; Play.</p>
