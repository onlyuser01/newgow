<p>Cash Vandal review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Playing on the cultural cache and mystique of big-name graffiti artists like Banksy, Cash Vandal takes you on a whistle-stop tour of some of the trendiest cities in Europe: London, Paris and Berlin. Shaking up your paint cans and spraying down the sides of public transit, gentrified neighbourhoods and corporate buildings.</p>
<p>The theme is held together rather loosely with many of the symbols being fruit or signs of wealth like diamonds and gold bars, but the setting is realised strongly enough that these incongruities do not bother the player too much.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>Oddly for a Play’N Go slot, Cash Vandal’s graphics are rather weak. You would expect a slot based around street art to have a higher pixel count on its reels for example and the backgrounds are given very little character when the whole game is centred around global locations.</p>
<p>The music is a dead trendy track which loops innocuously in the background keeping the tone of the game just right without distracting or annoying the player.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>The base game is a four reel slot with three rows and ten winlines. While the respin feature can make for an exciting change of pace, on the whole the game feels a little lacklustre in the gameplay department.</p>

<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Spray Can and Golden Can symbols.</p>
<p>The Golden Can is the key to the bonus system and appears on reel four. If you hit a Golden Can with no other Spray Cans, you get a re-spin giving you the chance to catch a Spray Can this time around.</p>
<p>Free spins bonus in the Paris feature</p>
<p>If you hit a Golden Can and one or more Spray Cans on a spin or re-spin, you trigger one of several bonuses.</p>
<p>A Golden Can with two or more Spray Cans will trigger the Free Spin feature. This will award five spins for two Spray Cans and ten spins for three. Wilds are stacked on reel four and you can choose a City Feature to be active on every spin.</p>
<p>If you land just one Spray Can with your Golden Can you trigger one free spin with the current City Feature. Once a city feature finishes you move to the next City. The game always starts with Paris as the first City Feature.</p>
<p>3 City Features explained</p>
<p>The Paris feature melds reel one and two to create a single reel populated with two-by-two symbols; Berlin adds two or three wilds to reels one to three at random; and London adds up to nine identical symbols anywhere on reels one to three (the symbol is chosen randomly every spin).</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of Cash Vandal is 96.47%, which is a little above the number we use for average, 96%. When coupled with Cash Vandal’s high volatility, this makes the game a good match for our preferred strategies.</p>
<p>The bet sizes on the site we tested started out at $/£/€0.10 and ran up to a maximum of $/£/€100.00 per spin. Most people’s bet size preferences will fall somewhere in that range.</p>

<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Cash Vandal look good under the hood, with a reasonable return to player and high volatility. On the other hand, the visuals aren’t great, the soundtrack is irksome and the gameplay not that fun.</p>
<p>Overall it is a bit of a mixed bag, not bad by any means, but not to everyone’s taste.</p>
