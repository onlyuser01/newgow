<p>In an innovative move aimed at overcoming state laws prohibiting direct sales, Tesla is taking a new approach by opening showrooms on tribal lands</p>
<p>Mohegan Sun, a well-known casino and entertainment complex in Connecticut owned by the federally recognized Mohegan Tribe, recently announced that Tesla would set up a showroom with a sales and delivery center on its sovereign property this fall.</p>
<p>Sales &amp; Delivery Center Opens at Mohegan Sun Casino Complex</p>
<p>The Tesla Sales &amp; Delivery Center at Mohegan Sun will be situated within the casino complex, providing customers with the unique experience of test-driving vehicles around the resort. Additionally, Tesla plans to showcase its solar and storage products at the location, making it a comprehensive showcase of the company’s offerings for interested customers.</p>
<p>This decision marks Tesla’s second foray into tribal territories, as it was previously reported that the company planned to open another showroom on the lands of the Oneida Indian Nation in upstate New York by 2025, reported Associated Press.</p>
<p>The move to tribal lands comes as Tesla faces staunch opposition from traditional car dealerships and state lawmakers who have blocked the company’s attempts to obtain dealership licenses and establish direct-to-consumer sales in several states.</p>
<p>Hayden Reynolds, chairperson of the Connecticut Automotive Retail Association, emphasized the importance of maintaining a level playing field for all car dealerships in the state. While respecting the sovereignty of the Mohegan Tribe, Reynolds stated that the association still opposes Tesla’s direct-to-consumer model, claiming that Connecticut’s dealer franchise laws benefit consumers and promote healthy competition.</p>
<p>Tesla’s Victory in Delaware Paves Way for Direct Sales</p>
<p>Tesla has been engaged in various legal battles and advocacy efforts to alter state laws and regulations to enable its direct sales approach. The company secured a significant victory earlier in the year when the Delaware Supreme Court overturned a ruling preventing Tesla from selling cars directly to customers in the state.</p>
<p>Tesla’s move to open showrooms on tribal lands has been seen as a strategic way to work around the restrictive state laws. The company had previously established its first showroom and repair shop on Native American land in 2021, partnering with the Nambé Pueblo tribe in New Mexico.</p>
<p>Mohegan Bolsters PR and Advertising Teams</p>
<p>Mohegan has recently ramped up its PR and advertising efforts with a shake-up of its PR and advertising teams. In March Mohegan appointed Cody Chapman as PR Director and Charisse Huff as PR Manager to bolster its corporate PR team.</p>
<p>Both longtime members of Mohegan are focusing on external communication strategies and overseeing media relations for Mohegan’s properties, primarily in the Northeast. Additionally, in April Mohegan Sun appointed David Fausel as its director of advertising. With over two decades of experience in the advertising industry, Fausel will lead the company’s advertising and marketing strategy and provide strategic guidance for the “All in for Mohegan” ad campaign.</p>
