    <h1>Casino Terre Haute Casino Michigan Casino Life Poker Hotels Near Thunder Valley Casino Gold Nugget C</h1>

<p>Pragmatic Play continues to grow across all of its verticals, with the company releasing a brand-new live casino game and adding it to its portfolio</p>
<p>The new game, set in the Baccarat vertical, carries the apt name “Mega Baccarat” and it offers an innovative twist to the classic Live Casino experience, the company explains.</p>
<p>Mega Baccarat Adds Variety to the Popular Vertical</p>
<p>Mega Baccarat introduces a fast pace of play that is set as a gameshow and gives players the opportunity to boost their winnings significantly as part of the Mega Round. To enter this round, the players would need to roll dice and hit eight or nine to trigger the bonus level.</p>
<p>During Mega Round, mega Multipliers will be displayed on top of the regular betting payouts, which can give players a chance to significantly increase their winnings from playing the game. A winning bet may return up to 1,000x, offering players an excellent opportunity to add to their winnings in a spectacular way.</p>
<p>The product is part of Pragmatic Play’s constantly improving and growing portfolio of casino games. Pragmatic Play COO Irina Cornides welcomed the addition of the new product and said that it’s an exciting way to innovate the Baccarat game genre and add to the Live Casino portfolio that Pragmatic has been investing in heavily over the past years. Cornides had this to add:</p>
<p>At Pragmatic Play, we’re constantly expanding our Live Casino range with new premium tables, immersive gameshows, and classic titles with a twist. Pragmatic Play COO Irina Cornides</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play has been focusing on growing its content portfolio over the past months, along with the increase of its local presence in specific geolocations. The company has been pushing heavily in the Latin American region where it has been able to work out some important partnerships with local operators.</p>
<p>Latin America Is an Important Focus of Pragmatic’s Efforts</p>
<p>Pragmatic recently expanded with Vem Betar in the regulated market in Colombia, marking yet another market entry for the supplier, and a broader expansion in the Latin American region. Another prominent partnership in the region was signed with Land Vegas, the first casino based in the Metaverse in the region.</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play is excited to be a part of the rapidly-shifting landscape in the Latin American market, something that is a priority for the supplier these days. Mega Baccarat is only going to add to the variety of live casino games.</p>
