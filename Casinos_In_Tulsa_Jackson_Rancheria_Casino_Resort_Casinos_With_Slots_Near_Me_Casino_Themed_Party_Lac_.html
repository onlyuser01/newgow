    <h1>Casinos In Tulsa Jackson Rancheria Casino Resort Casinos With Slots Near Me Casino Themed Party Lac</h1>

<p>I deposited funds with sugar casino, met all wagering, won $370 USD and put forward our request to make a withdrawal. This is the second time we have played with them. Last week we won $100 USD which we claimed and it was paid immediately to the credit card we used to deposit. So we were confident they were a legitimate casino.</p>
<p>However when we checked out withdrawal process, it had been canceled. Eventually we managed to speak to someone via online chat who told us there was a breach and that we had made a bet of 4€ plus. We advised them that the highest bet made was 80c however they then advised that we would not get the funds back. When we checked our account all betting information for the day they claimed we made the €4 plus bets has been removed and they’ve not provided any evidence to verify their claim.</p>
<p>Once we had requested the withdrawal. We made two more deposits, no bonuses were used and we lost both amounts. I’m not sure if that matters but wanted to be open.</p>
