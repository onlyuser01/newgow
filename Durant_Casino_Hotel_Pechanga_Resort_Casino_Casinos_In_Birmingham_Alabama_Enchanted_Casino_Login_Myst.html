    <h1>Durant Casino Hotel Pechanga Resort Casino Casinos In Birmingham Alabama Enchanted Casino Login Myst</h1>

<p>ComeOn Group has announced that it has reorganized its C-level leadership after announcing three new executives who will lead its product, technology, and performance marketing units. The changes come as the company continues to see strong demand for its iGaming solutions,</p>
<p>ComeOn Adds Execs</p>
<p>The B2C gambling subsidiary of Cherry AB has promoted Cristiano Blanco from Gaming Director to Chief Product officer (CPO). Blanco will be directly responsible for the coordination of product operations and product development &amp; design, as well as roadmap management for ComeOn’s multi-brand portfolio.</p>
<p>Mikael Angman was previously the company’s Director of Technology and Products and will now serve as ComeOn’s new Chief Information Officer. ComeOn stated that Angman was a leader during his six-month stint in technology leadership, where he developed the group’s project roadmap for executing ComeOn’s proprietary iGaming platforms and systems. Previously, Angman worked with Gaming Innovation Group, NetEnt and Playtech.</p>
<p>Efi Peleg, the former Director, Performance Marketing of William Hill, will become the third C-level appointment to ComeOn’s executive leadership. Peleg is an expert in the field of iGaming and marketing. He will be responsible to reoptimize ComeOn’s marketing channel and acquisition channels. Peleg will join ComeOn in the new year and will be based in the London office.</p>
<p>Additional Expansion Coming to ComeOn</p>
<p>Juergen Reutter, CEO of ComeOn, stated that the three executives were crucial in executing the company’s new product vision. He asserted, “Our leadership team is now complete with both new and existing Executive team members, adding on to that we have our Hybrid Office approach that is pioneering and will set us apart making sure to keep and attract talent in our industry.”</p>
<p>ComeOn has been growing across several fronts lately. Not only has it teamed up with a number of high-profile sports organizations and iGaming companies, such as Playtech, this year, but it is also rewriting the script on how business workforces conduct day-to-day operations.</p>
<p>Reutter, who was appointed CEO last December, added, “ComeOn has a history of innovating in this exciting industry for more than 12 years and we have a solid growth strategy in place, in which Product, Tech, and Marketing play a key role. The recent launch of WeSpin is one of many examples where our organisation keeps innovating with Product, Tech and Marketing coming together and driving our differentiating edge.”</p>
