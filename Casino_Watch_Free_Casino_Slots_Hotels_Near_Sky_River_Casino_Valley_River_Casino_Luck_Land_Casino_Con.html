<p>After a soft launch during a week in which bettors were able to place bets in sports and casino games in a limited way, Connecticut sports regulators authorised online casino and sports betting in earnest as of 6am 19 October in Connecticut.</p>
<p>There are three entities that head this initiative: the Mohegan Tribe, the Mashantucket Pequot Tribe and the Connecticut Lottery Corporation. All three have been authorised to offer online sports betting.</p>
<p>Anyone can play as long as they are 21-years-old and over. Bets are now accepted via the sportsbook partnerships such as Rush Street Interactive with the Connecticut Lottery Corporation, FanDuel with the Mohegan Tribe or and DraftKings with the Mashantucket Pequot Tribe.</p>
<p>Owners and operators of the Mohegan Sun and Foxwoods Resort Casino, located in southeast Connecticut, are also going to be allowed to offer Internet casino gaming to people over 21 years of age. A total of 130 games are to be offered by Mohegan Sun's partner FanDuel. The other mega-company, DraftKings, in association with Foxwoods, will offer 163 games and is expected to increase that number shortly.</p>
<p>Ned Lamont signed the legislation for this last May after years of discussions and negotiations that did not work out. Finally, the two tribal nations that are federally recognised with exclusive rights to this type of gambling in the state of Connecticut reached legalisation.</p>
<p>Lamont said of the launch: "This is an exciting moment for our state and our tribal partners. Connecticut has proven to be a leader when it comes to the gaming economy going back decades, and that legacy will continue with the launch of these new online options for all eligible residents."</p>
<p>This new law permits online keno and lottery tickets as well. However, these two have yet to be passed by the Department of Consumer Protection. When this is approved, players 18-years-old and older will be allowed to play these games, which are expected to be offered by all three operators.</p>
<p>The Connecticut Lottery Corporation has partnered with Sportech, an off-track betting operator. Both are pending final approval by regulators to carry out their activities for in-person sports betting. Sportech will have betting kiosks of its lottery associate in its 10 venues in the state. On 30 September, both entities unveiled their sites for in-person betting.</p>
<p>While the soft launch was in place, authorities collaborated with the gaming companies to ensure that there were no issues in the platforms that were operating correctly.</p>
<p>The Department of Consumer Protection in Connecticut (DCPC) also verified that the three gaming companies would be able to offer the periodic reports they must present in Connecticut to protect consumers. The DCPC also verified the limits for people in betting, who can sign up and how they can play on the various gaming sites.</p>
