<p>Richard Schwartz, Rush Street Interactive’s CEO, revealed that an ongoing commitment for the company is to offer engaging and unique experiences for its players. According to him, Light &amp; Wonder Premium Live Dealer games by Authentic Gaming are a perfect match for this goal. “Authentic Gaming has created a compelling array of content that speaks directly to the preferences of players in Michigan and this is a partnership we believe will prove to be highly successful going forward,” explained Schwartz in conclusion.</p>
