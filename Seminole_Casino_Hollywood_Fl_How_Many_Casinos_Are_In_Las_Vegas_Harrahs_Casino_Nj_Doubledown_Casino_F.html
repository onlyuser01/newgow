    <h1>Seminole Casino Hollywood Fl How Many Casinos Are In Las Vegas Harrahs Casino Nj Doubledown Casino F</h1>

<p>The ACMA acknowledged the three gambling companies’ quick reaction and decided not to impose sanctions</p>
<p>The Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) announced that it has found a number of operators guilty of breaching the country’s rules on gambling. As reported by the authority, the gambling companies in question used “Fast/Quick Codes” to facilitate in-play betting on sports matches.</p>
<p>Violators, according to the ACMA, included Entain’s Ladbrokes and Neds, bet365 and Sportsbet.</p>
<p>The ACMA reminded companies that in-play betting on sports matches is prohibited under the Interactive Gambling Act 2001, save for a few limited exceptions such as placing bets over the phone. However, in order for this exception to apply, a customer needs to provide their bet type, amount and confirmation via the phone call.</p>
<p>According to the ACMA, the aforementioned operators violated this rule by instead providing a Fast/Quick code option to customers. The codes in question embed the event, bet selection and bet type. Thanks to this, customers can just quote the Fast/Quick code to operators over the phone.</p>
<p>The ACMA Did Not Impose Further Sanctions</p>
<p>The ACMA explained that Ladbrokes and Neds, bet365 and Sportsbet all violated Australia’s rules on Fast/Quick Codes.</p>
<p>Ladbrokes and Neds (Entain), bet365 (Hillside) and Sportsbet (Sportsbet) in-play betting services were found to individually generate Fast/Quick Codes for each particular in-play bet when that bet was built by a customer via the service’s website or App – at least for the first customer. ACMA statement</p>
<p>Australia’s communications regulator concluded that this betting information had been communicated via the website or app, rather than entirely via the phone call. As a result, the exception to the prohibition on in-play betting on sports matches did not apply.</p>
<p>In the wake of the investigation, all three operators in question have taken steps to make their Fast/Quick Codes compliant with the local rules. As a result, companies will only be able to generate such codes prior to the beginning of a sporting event, independent of customers selecting bets. These codes will be generic and the same for all customers, the ACMA added.</p>
<p>The ACMA acknowledged the three gambling companies’ quick reaction and decided not to impose sanctions.</p>
<p>Last month, the ACMA learned that the Seven Network Operations has breached the country’s gambling ad regulations. This was not the company’s first violation either, resulting in a penalty of $13,320.</p>
