<p>Stakelogic is certain that its live casino content will help PepperMill Casino dominate its competitors in Belgium</p>
<p>Casino content house Stakelogic has secured a new agreement with the gambling operator PepperMill Casino. Under this Belgium-oriented deal, the supplier will provide its new partner with live casino games.</p>
<p>As a result of the agreement, PepperMill Casino players will be able to enjoy some of the best titles Stakelogic has to offer. The latter company will provide the operator with a selection of dice slots, a variety of classic casino titles and auto roulette.</p>
<p>Stakelogic is famous for its traditional-looking fruit-themed slots and engaging mechanics. Features such as Super Stake, bring innovation to well-known types of games, adding new twists to engage players.</p>
<p>The developer’s live casino titles, meanwhile, field experienced dealers that greatly improve the customer experience. The titles are broadcast from Stakelogic Live’s proprietary studio in Malta, ensuring the best quality for players.</p>
<p>Stakelogic Will Keep PepperMill Ahead of Its Competitors</p>
<p>Stakelogic’s commercial director, Jose Simon, commented on the agreement with PepperMill. He praised the online casino for its extensive presence in the growing Belgian market. Simon also added that Stakelogic is excited to make a foray into this market with its dice slots and auto roulette in the market.</p>
<p>Simon is certain that Stakelogic’s dice games will appeal to Belgian customers, just like they have appealed to players in so many other markets. Games with unique styles have proven to be popular in the country, Simon noted and concluded that players will soon see “what all the fuss is about.”</p>
<p>PepperMill Casino’s general director, Anthony Rus, called the current deal a “big integration” for his company. He confirmed Simon’s expectations, noting that players in Belgium are very passionate about slots and live dealer games. Since Stakelogic is among the top providers of such content, Rus is certain that local gamblers are going to delight in the new games.</p>
<p>Lastly, Richard Walker, Stakelogic Live’s head of live casino, spoke about the quality of his company’s live offerings. He noted that Stakelogic always prioritizes excellence and that its dealers have what it takes to make players feel like stars.</p>
<p>Walker concluded that PepperMill Casino will now be able to leverage this premium content to distinguish itself from its competitors.</p>
<p>In early March, Stakelogic also consolidated its presence in the Netherlands through an agreement with 711. The previous month, the company penned another live casino-oriented deal with Interwetten. This followed an integration with Paf, which adopted some of Stakelogic’s best slot games.</p>
