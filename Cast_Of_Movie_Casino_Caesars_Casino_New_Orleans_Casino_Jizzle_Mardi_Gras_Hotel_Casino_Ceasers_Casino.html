<p>Thanks to a new content agreement, SpaceCasino will expand its offering, delivering thrilling and engaging games from Spinomenal</p>
<p>The up-and-coming online gambling operator, SpaceCasino, expanded its offering thanks to a newly signed content agreement with the leading provider for the iGaming sector, Spinomenal. The collaboration between the duo was announced Monday and sees Spinomenal deliver a portfolio of games for the fast-growing online gambling operator.</p>
<p>The games from the leading iGaming content provider will go live on SpaceCasino via Fusion, Pariplay’s innovative aggregation platform. Ultimately, by expanding its portfolio of games and delivering new titles, SpaceCasino anticipates growing its presence in the competitive online gambling market.</p>
<p>Thanks to the new deal, top-performing games from Spinomenal will become available for the online gambling operator. The list of games includes Demi Gods II, Queen of Ice and Baba Yaga Tales, among other fan-favorite and engaging games developed by Spinomenal.</p>
<p>Dmitrijs Solovjovs, SpaceCasino’s head of product, revealed that the company is delighted to boost its portfolio of games with the addition of Spinomenal titles. He spoke about SpaceCasino’s commitment to delivering unique and engaging experiences by offering quality iGaming titles.

<p>Spinomenal Continues to Expand Content Reach</p>
<p>The partnership with SpaceCasino comes on the heels of another important deal announced by Spinomenal recently. Late last month, the company confirmed it agreed to supply games to the Spanish powerhouse, Lowen Play. The collaboration further strengthened the iGaming provider’s presence on the Old Continent, while at the same time, expanding the reach of its portfolio to new audiences.</p>
<p>Again, in August, Spinomenal signed a content agreement with the global iGaming and betting operator, NetBet. That deal saw the operator expand its offering with thrilling games from Spinomenal.</p>
<p>“SpaceCasino is a brand on an impressive growth trajectory and we’re very happy to be partnering with them.“ Lior Shvartz, CEO of Spinomenal</p>
<p>Lior Shvartz, Spinomenal’s CEO, shared his excitement about the company’s latest deal with SpaceCasino.
