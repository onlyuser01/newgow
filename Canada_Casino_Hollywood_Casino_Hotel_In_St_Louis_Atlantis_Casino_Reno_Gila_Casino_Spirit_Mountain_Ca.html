    <h1>Canada Casino Hollywood Casino Hotel In St Louis Atlantis Casino Reno Gila Casino Spirit Mountain Ca</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>so there was no misunderstanding, after all, I'm afraid to say.</p>
<p>Are those over-max bets shown in your gaming history? If so, I can't imagine how could you possibly prove that you have not bet those.</p>
<p>Did you use some kind of "buy free spins" feature or any other kind of "buy" feature? That should explain the bets. But I still think that this is prohibited.</p>
<p>The max bet rule is a standard rule that must be obeyed in order to get the winnings after all requirements are met.</p>
<p>Would probably be different if you had realized a mistake, informed the support, and waited for the decision of the casino, I can imagine that one wrong bet can be explained and accepted, or the casino could set your balance back.</p>
<p>Regarding the bonus, can you tell me which bonus in which casino you took ? It will require knowing the exact terms of the bonus, the free spins may go first. I have no clue without the terms and your gaming history. The max cash out is another basic rule, however.</p>
<p>I don't understand the part where you mentioned Amelie and Paula, I guess they both work as support. Ok?</p>
<p>If you feel that the casino or Amelie and Paula are not right, submit the complaint, please.</p>
