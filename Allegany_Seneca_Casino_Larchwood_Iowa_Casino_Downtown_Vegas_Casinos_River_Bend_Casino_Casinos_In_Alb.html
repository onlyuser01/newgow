<p>Award-winning, business-to-business multi-product gaming provider Relax Gaming has released Wild Chapo Dream Drop, a sequel to its already popular Mexican-themed slot launched last April. The new game has a strong focus on the provider’s progressive jackpots and it is packed with eye-catching features with a huge win potential. The list includes expanding TNT symbols, sticky wild respins, and bonus bomb symbols. Wild Chapo Dream Drop has a win potential of up to 10,000x the initial bet.</p>

<p>Roll With Wild Chapo in the Mexican Outback</p>
<p>Relax Gaming invites players to go back to the Mexican Outback and once again roll with the iconic Wild Chapo character in its freshest release. The explosive character is again ready to test out their limits with three different explosives that were also part of the original game: Sticky Wild Re-Spins, Expanding TNT Wilds, and Bonus Bomb symbols. Each of these features is capable of summoning some incredible wins during the base game. This time around, however, the game also features a series of incredible Dream Drop jackpots that can go as high as 10,000,000.</p>
<p>The new slot’s active panel has kept the initial position to the side of a Mexican bar where Chapo likes to spend his time. The game incorporates a series of intriguing explosions triggered when a number of wild symbols with multipliers reach the same line. The charming design and comic characters are nicely brought together by the engaging soundtrack chosen by the provider.</p>
<p>Jackpot Spin &amp; Dream Drop Bonus</p>
<p>Once the Jackpot Spin is triggered, players can use it as an extra spin prior to a regular spin. When this occurs, the reels become packed with Dream Drop symbols and wooden blockers. To engage the bonus, players must land a minimum of five Dream Drop symbols during the Jackpot Spin that is triggered randomly. The game offers five different jackpots: Rapid, Midi, Maxi, Major, and Mega. During the Dream Drop Bonus round, players receive one spin. At the end of the spin, they learn which jackpot they managed to win.</p>
<p>Relax Gaming’s chief executive officer Simon Hammon described the new game’s “array of dynamite features” as “set to explode” onto their partners’ platforms. He also described the way the classic game was upgraded with the now iconic Dream Drop Jackpot, making it even more appealing to all audiences.</p>
<p>At the beginning of August, Relax Gaming announced it had agreed to offer its iGaming content to bet365. At the end of June, the same provider signed a content deal agreement partnered with Peter &amp; Sons.</p>
