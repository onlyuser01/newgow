    <h1>Mesquite Casino Restaurants In The Crown Casino Melbourne Erie Pa Casino Sunset Casino Casino Themed</h1>

<p>I'm going to start off by saying I thoroughly enjoy this site/app. The instant plays are great. They have a tournament running every hour. The games are quality (in terms of play and graphics). They give you $1 every 24 hours. Heck they just gave a guy a trip to Hawaii!</p>
<p>Now let me say this: There is no RTP. I bet you I'm close to $800, give or take $100, into this site in the last week. Any cashouts? Not one. I have yet to make it to the $50 mark to do a cashout. The games do not pay back anywhere close to other online casino games. I've played on other sites with 90% or better RTP, per what our great friends here places them at, and not once had to put the kind of coin from my bucket into the games to play them like I have to do with Luckyland.... The RTP with this site must be well below that of any online casino out there. I'd place it within the low 60s, yet, I still find my way back there.</p>
<p>I'm just wondering what our online collective thought is on this site. Seeing how there isn't a thread about Luckyland posting a score and all the other amazing information our wonderful team here digs up (admins, if you can get us something worked up I'd love you forever).</p>
<p>In closing I'd just like to say : There is no reason Luckyland can not give back to the community with games that boast 95% RTP or greater. Some deposit bonus'. Or any other great token that many of the other grand online sites offer to their players. A daily 2 hour-buy only once- offer for $30 to get 35 SC is not cool. I'm not with that. $30 for 50SC I'm with. Though I'd rather see $5 for 10SC, with 3 buys. But I'm only a gold teir level 53, so maybe those grand deals are still to come.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading and I look forward to hearing everyone's voice on this site.</p>
