<p>Despite the favorable results, the actual revenue recorded by sportsbooks declined by 9.2%</p>
<p>The New York sports betting market continues to post record-breaking monthly results. As reported by the New York State Gaming Commission, sports betting operators in the state recorded betting handle of $2.1 billion in November. This exceeds October’s spectacular results when the industry also exceeded $2 billion in bets, becoming the first state to surpass this milestone.</p>
<p>November’s record-breaking results represent a 5.1% month-on-month increase and a whopping 35.7% year-on-year increase. The state’s ability to not only repeat but surpass the October results attests to the fast growth of the local industry and the increased interest in betting products.</p>
<p>Despite the favorable results, the actual revenue recorded by sportsbooks declined by 9.2%. For reference, sports betting operators in The Empire State reported total revenue of $150.9 million and a hold rate of only 7.1%. For reference, the industry had a hold rate of 8.2% last month.</p>
<p>The lower hold rate does not undermine sportsbooks, though, as their revenue still exceeded the revenue recorded in November 2022.</p>
<p>FanDuel Dominated the NY Market</p>
<p>New York’s Gambling Commission also provided information about the performance of the state’s legal sports betting operators. The market continued to be dominated by FanDuel, which singlehandedly handled $925.4 million of the total $2.1 billion in handle. It was followed by DraftKings, which recorded a betting handle of $732.1 million. Rounding up the top three is Caesars with a handle of $204.9 million</p>
<p>BetMGM, on the other hand, reported $120.6 million in handle. Rush Street Interactive, PointsBet, WynnBet and ResortsWorld Bet failed to surpass the $100 million mark, reporting handle of $76.6 million, $27.2 million, $11.3 million and $6.8 million, respectively. In November, Bally’s also returned to New York, generating $4.3 million in handle through its BallyBet brand.</p>
<p>In terms of revenue, FanDuel maintained its lead, reporting $69.2 million from its November operations. DraftKings remained in second place with a revenue of $54.3 million. Caesars, on the other hand, earned $11.6 million.</p>
<p>The top three were followed by BetMGM at $7.9 million. Rush Street Interactive and PointsBet, meanwhile, recorded handle of $4.9 million and $2.4 million respectively. ResortsWorld Bet, BallyBet and WynnBet failed to hit the one million mark, instead reporting revenues of $483,000, $234,000 and $312,000, respectively.</p>
<p>The sports betting operations in New York resulted in $83 million in taxes to the state.</p>
