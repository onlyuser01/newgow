<p>The two clubs believe that Safer Gambling Week is a very important initiative</p>
<p>Two soccer clubs, namely Southampton FC and Blackpool FC, are among the organizations to express their support for Safer Gambling Week. The annual initiative, which seeks to promote responsible gaming, continues to attract support from operators, charities and sporting clubs.</p>
<p>Southampton FC Will Promote Safer Gambling with Better Change</p>
<p>Southampton FC will join forces with Better Change to help fans engage in safer-gambling-related discussions. As a result, Better Change will provide a place where fans can discuss their passion for sports while commenting on the importance of safety,</p>
<p>Southampton FC, on the other hand, will share a video promoting Safer Gambling Week, providing insights from the head of performance psychology, Malcolm Frame.</p>
<p>Southampton FC’s CCO, Charlie Boss, highlighted the importance of promoting safer gambling, saying that it is a part of the club’s commitment to the community. He thanked Better Change, which is helping to champion a safer future for the fans and the industry as a whole.</p>
<p>David Richardson’ Better Change’s head of strategic partnerships, noted that the time his team has spent partnering with Southampton FC has been a pleasure, lauding the club as one that “proactively makes an impact” through its socially responsible activities.</p>
<p>Richardson also highlighted the importance of breaking down the stigma and providing support to those who need it.</p>
<p>Blackpool FC Will Replace LeoVegas’ Logo for a Game</p>
<p>In the meantime, Blackpool FC teamed up with its gambling partner, LeoVegas, to further promote the initiative. To that end, the two parties will encourage responsible gambling during the team’s upcoming game against Shrewsbury Town on November 18.</p>
<p>As a part of the initiative, Blackpool will temporarily remove the LeoVegas logo from their shirts, instead replacing it with safer gambling messaging.</p>
<p>According to the club, it is the only EFL organization to commit to responsible gambling in such a way. Its chief operating officer, Jonty Castle, underscored the importance of Safer Gambling Week to the United Kingdom’s sports and gambling sector and expressed his desire to promote the initiative.</p>
<p>Castle thanked LeoVegas for its ongoing support and praised the kind donation of its front-of-shirt sponsorship for the cause.</p>
<p>LeoVegas’ director of UK and Ireland, Sam Behar also commented on the matter, saying that responsible gambling is in the company’s DNA. He said that his team is proud to work with Blackpool FC and help fans understand the range of safer gambling tools available to them.</p>
<p>In the meantime, 888 just provided insights into its own efforts to protect players from harm.</p>
