<p>The World Series of Poker has announced all of the championship events at the upcoming Las Vegas event in June and July 2020.</p>
<p>$10K+ WSOP Buy-In Events Announced</p>
<p>The 2020 Las Vegas World Series of Poker is coming up, and the last we heard about the event was at the end of last year when a dozen events were announced. Up until now, we only new about 12 events, covering a wide variety of buy-ins – but, the latest announcement targets the high-rolling WSOP hopefuls.</p>
<p>The WSOP has released the dates for a few more events. This time around, the organizers are letting players know about the championship events (those that have a buy-in of $10,000 or more). The following events geared at high roller players have been announced:</p>
<p>Date Event Buy-In June 3 Omaha Hi-Lo $10,000 June 6 Seven Card Stud $10,000 June 8 Short Deck $10,000 June 9 HORSE $10,000 June 12 Super Turbo Bounty NLH $10,000 June 13 Dealers Choice 6-Handed $10,000 June 15 No-Limit 2-7 Single Draw $10,000 June 18 2-7 Triple Draw $10,000 June 20 Pot-Limit Omaha $10,000 June 22 Poker Players Championship $50,000 June 24 Razz $10,000 June 26 Pot-Limit Omaha Hi-Lo $10,000 June 28 Seven Card Stud Hi-Lo $10,000 June 29 No-Limit Hold’em Six-Max $10,000 June 30 Limit Hold’em $10,000 July 1-3 Main Event $10,000 July 2 WSOP.com Online NLH $10,000</p>
<p>It’s an interesting mix of events, as the World Series of Poker aims to appeal to a wide range of players. Draw, Omaha and Hold’em games are all available. So, it doesn’t matter what kind of player you are – you’re still going to have the opportunity to play in a Championship event during the WSOP.</p>
<p>“The Championship Events are always among the most special offered at the WSOP each year. We are proud to be the only tournament series who spreads such an offering and have worked with some of the games most distinguished players this off-season to ensure our schedule and the events themselves align well with where poker is in 2020″ – Jack Effel, WSOP Vice President.</p>
<p>Of course, if you don’t have the kind of bankroll to support a $10K poker buy-in, there are many ways for your to earn your way into championship WSOP events via satellites. Over the course of the next few months, you’re sure to find out about a range of smaller events that will feed into the championship tournaments during the Las Vegas World Series of Poker 2020.</p>
