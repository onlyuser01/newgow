<p>Rabbit Royale review</p>
<p>Theme and Style</p>
<p>The battle is on with Rabbit Royale as an army of savvy bunnies take on a farmer and his wife.</p>
<p>As the sky darkens, players will help some rabbits avoid traps, poison, and knives. If this fluffy regiment can make it through the night, they’ll be rewarded with all the carrots they can eat.</p>
<p>Players looking for a unique experience will particularly appreciate this slot. Some may be reminded of the Japanese action thriller Battle Royale, in which a range of characters must fight to the death.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The soundtrack blends ambient sounds, including crickets, radio static, snippets of country music, animal calls, and raspy comments from the farmer and his wife. This wide range of sounds may sometimes be slightly confusing, but it definitely contributes to the chaotic atmosphere. The reels themselves spin with a delicate clicking sound, with a cheerful melody celebrating wins.</p>
<p>The rabbit characters are animated in a personified cartoon style. Each wears a distinct military ensemble, and a smile that shows their adorable front teeth.</p>
<p>The farmer and his wife are an elderly couple with grim expressions and weapons in their hands. They bring to mind the villains of a horror story as they stare out of their reels with cruel eyes.</p>
<p>Bottles of poison, trackers, mailboxes, claw traps, and sewing machines all appear among the symbols. Each is illustrated in a shadowy, ominous style. The most eye-catching symbols on the reels are the carrots which are orange, ripe, and dewy.</p>
<p>Behind the reels, players will see a farm with a lush garden. In the distance, the sun has almost set, leaving only pale light in the sky.</p>
<p>Together, the soundtrack and animation create a dark, quirky world of rabbit-human warfare.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Rabbit Royale is a five-reel, five-row slot. Wins are awarded for landing connected clusters of 5 or more matching symbols. In total, there are 259 ways to win.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols with the exception of Rabbit symbols and Carrot symbols.</p>
<p>When a Wild symbol contributes to a winning combination, the Wild reveals a Carrot symbol with a randomly selected value. Rabbit symbols collect the values of Carrot symbols and a respin is awarded.</p>
<p>The Bonus feature is awarded when players land at least 3 Bonus symbols. The number of free spins and Sticky Rabbits awarded depends on the number of triggering Bonus symbols:</p>
<p>3 Bonus symbols = 3 free spins + 1 Sticky Rabbit</p>
<p>4 Bonus symbols = 4 free spins + 2 Sticky Rabbits</p>
<p>5 Bonus symbols = 5 free spins + 3 Sticky Rabbits</p>
<p>Sticky Rabbits are a special symbol that remain on the reels for the duration of the Bonus feature. During Rabbit Collect respins, players do not use up any free spins.</p>
<p>The Bonus can be retriggered if players land at least 3 additional Bonus symbols.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 94%, well below our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.20 up to a maximum of $/£/€100 per spin.</p>
<p>Rabbit Royale offers high volatility, which would have made this slot a good fit for our preferred slot machine strategies if the RTP were higher. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We do not recommend this low RTP, high volatility rabbit war-themed slot.</p>
<p>Though Rabbit Royale offers a creative theme and some fun bonuses, the RTP is simply too low to merit a recommendation.</p>
<p>Some players might stop by to explore this slot’s eccentric world, but they would do well to move on to slots that can offer a more favorable RTP.</p>
