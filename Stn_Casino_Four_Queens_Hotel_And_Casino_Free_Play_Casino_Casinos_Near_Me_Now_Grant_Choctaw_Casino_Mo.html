<p>The world-famous brand that is popular in more than 70 countries around the globe, Hard Rock International (HRI), announced last week that it raised more than $1 million during PINKTOBER, seeking to help breast cancer research. Supporting its charitable arm, Hard Rock Heals Foundation, HRI organized its 23rd annual PINKTOBER campaign.</p>
<p>During the campaign, Hard Rock locations including Hard Rock Hotels, Casinos, Cafes, as well as Rock Shops, included different limited-edition menu items, that helped raise funds for charities focused on breast cancer. Additionally, the company organized a songwriting contest, as well as other events that helped in the efforts to raise invaluable funds for breast cancer research.</p>
<p>PINKTOBER initially launched back in 2000 and has helped raise millions of dollars for research. Last year's edition of the event set a new record by raising $700,000 to help breast cancer research. This year's edition surpassed the previous record by raising $1 million, marking the second year in a row HRI surpasses its record.</p>
<p>As a part of PINKTOBER, David Correy, a world-famous artist who lost his mother to cancer in 2020, participated in a Breast Cancer Awareness Song Contest at Hard Rock Hotels. In a statement, Hard Rock explained that Correy "encouraged fans to compose for a cause by sharing their lyrics as a vessel to honor fighters, survivors, and loved ones that have stood by their side for PINKTOBER."</p>
<p>The contest winner was a breast cancer survivor who received a $5,000 grand prize, as well as a $5,000 donation in her name to the American Cancer Society. What's more, the winner's lyrics became a part of the PINKTOBER Anthem by David Correy and she also collected an all-inclusive voucher for a 4-night stay at Hard Rock Hotel.</p>
<p>Besides the Breast Cancer Awareness Song Contest, Hard Rock introduced another initiative during PINKTOBER. Hard Rock Cafe unveiled a collaboration with Dominique Crenn, a globally recognized French chef, who is a breast cancer survivor. The collaboration saw the creation of "a limited-time menu item of Baja Style Shrimp Tacos exclusively available at Hard Rock Cafe locations around the world," HRI explained.</p>
<p>Hard Rock International's Chief Operating Officer, Jon Lucas, said that PINKTOBER is one of the most-anticipated events for the company. He added: "Each October, our company divisions and properties around the globe truly personify our mottos of "Love All â€“ Serve All" and "Take Time To Be Kind" by joining together to support breast cancer awareness and research."</p>
<p>Lucas acknowledged that the company is delighted to join forces with Chef Crenn and the famous musician David Correy. He explained that the duo was both impacted by breast cancer and helped HRI's PINKTOBER initiative. "We're appreciative of their support to help raise awareness and donations for the American Cancer Society and related charities within our local communities," Lucas said in conclusion.</p>
