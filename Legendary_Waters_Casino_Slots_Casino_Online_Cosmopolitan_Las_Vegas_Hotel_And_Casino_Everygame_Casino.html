    <h1>Legendary Waters Casino Slots Casino Online Cosmopolitan Las Vegas Hotel And Casino Everygame Casino</h1>

<p>Scout Gaming has signed a partnership agreement with Betano Brazil, expanding its own footprint and market service to another leading operator. Betano is a Kaizen Gaming brand that is billed as one of the fastest-growing game tech companies in Europe. Scout Gaming provides leading B2B daily fantasy sports, sportsbook and fantasy sports betting products to an array of customers.</p>
<p>As per this deal, Scout Gaming will bring forward its proprietary fantasy sports platforms, player odds and accompanying products to be integrated with Betano’s brand. Betano is currently a leading sports betting operator in Brazil making it a flexible and reliable choice with Scout Gaming looking to reach the most consumers in the state.</p>
<p>Scout Gaming is also eager to establish its product line as the go-to choice for fantasy, sports betting, and fantasy betting products, as per the company’s official press release. The company has made similar moves in the United States and is now expanding in South America.</p>
<p>LatAm Proves Next Focal Point of Scout Gaming’s Efforts</p>
<p>Scout Gaming CPO Andreas Sundal commented on the current partnership, welcoming the opportunity to be building up Scout’s relationship with Kaizen Gaming in Brazil.</p>
<p>“South America is a highly interesting market when it comes to both fantasy and sports betting, and we are very happy to be working with Betano, one of the most established and popular brands in the market. This forms part of wider efforts to grow our product range and enter more markets,” Sundal explained.</p>
<p>Kaizen sportsbook product manager John Tsakalakis commented that Betano is looking to offer the best possible sportsbook experience by creating a comprehensive, one-stop-package for all things betting. Scout Gaming allows the company to achieve that, he noted.</p>
<p>“We look forward to leveraging the full potential of its award-winning products while also keep offering the best experience to those who trust us for their entertainment,” Tsakalakis explained as his company is looking to strengthen its presence in the Latin American market.</p>
<p>Last week we spoke with Scout Gaming CCO Joakim Renman who detailed the company’s expansion plans in the Latin American market and spoke about the company’s distinct DFS and sports betting brand.</p>
