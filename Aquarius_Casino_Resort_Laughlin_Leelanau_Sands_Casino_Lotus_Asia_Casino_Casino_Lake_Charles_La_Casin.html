<p>Michael Conlan vs TJ Doheny Odds to Win</p>

<p>Where and When to Watch Conlan vs Doheny?</p>
<p>Date : Friday, August 6</p>
<p>: Friday, August 6 Time : 3 pm EST</p>
<p>: 3 pm EST Watch: ESPN+</p>
<p>Michael Conlan Remains Undefeated</p>
<p>As you can imagine, Conlan is an almost undisputed favorite for this one. He’s priced at (-600), and he has the track record to prove that the oddsmakers didn’t make a mistake. Conlan repeatedly took on some of the most notable opponents out there, and his wins include fighters such as Sofiane Takoucht and Ruben Hernandez.</p>
<p>Admittedly, the fight against TJ Doheny will be another big milestone in his career, and outside of his fight against Takoucht, he has not faced another opponent who is as experienced in boxing.</p>
<p>Conlan shows the strength and commitment that few other fighters have. He has been able to bring in 15 victories in total, eight of which with a KO and all of this in less than four years of professional boxing. He has the stamina, reach, and attributes that make him the clear favorite in the upcoming bout.</p>
<p>Colan vs TJ Doheny Tale of the Tape</p>
<p>Michael Conlan TJ Doheny 29 Age 34 5’8″ Height 5′ 5 ½” 69″ Reach 68″ 15 Fights 24</p>
<p>What to Make of TJ Doheny</p>
<p>Perhaps Doheny’s own career has not been as quick as his opponent’s. Colan is closing in the distance between him and Doheny in just a few years. It took Doheny eight years to set up 24 fights.</p>
<p>Yet, dismissing Doheny would be a grave mistake, and when he is given odds of (+400), you can see how this is a great boxing betting value if the fighter manages to bring the fight home.</p>
<p>It’s also important to note that Doheny fought fighters that have had more experience boxing than Conlan. He defeated both Martinez and Roman, he took on Mike Oliver and Pipat Chaiporn and won against all. He most notably took down Sutep Wangmuk, a fighter with over 68 bouts in his career, and four losses.</p>
<p>Doheny is a long shot, and Conlan is definitely a very talented boxer, but when the odds seem to give you such a great opportunity, it seems at least wise to consider placing a bet on Doheny on the moneyline.</p>
