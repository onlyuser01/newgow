<p>The certification is in line with the supplier’s desire to grow its global footprint</p>
<p>BGaming, a rapidly-growing provider of online casino content, announced that it has secured a Spanish certification from BMM Testlabs, the longest-established and most experienced private independent gaming testing laboratory in the world.</p>
<p>In addition, the supplier’s technical system of gaming software and gaming content have been officially greenlit for launch by the Dirección General de Ordenación del Juego (DGOJ), Spain’s official gambling regulator.</p>
<p>As a result, BGaming can now launch its newly-certified gaming titles with any operator in the strict Spanish market.</p>
<p>The launch in Spain is a big moment for the company, which has been bullish on expanding its international presence. BGaming’s games are currently available in multiple European markets, including Bulgaria, Greece, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia and Spain.</p>
<p>In the meantime, BGaming continues to expand its cutting-edge content portfolio with new additions. The supplier rolled out one of its latest games, Dice Bonanza, a few days ago, after a month-long exclusive period on Stake. In March, the developer also released Book of Kemet, an Egypt-themed slot.</p>
<p>BGaming Is Happy to Grow in Spain</p>
<p>BGaming’s chief executive officer, Marina Ostrovtsova, commented on the new certification, highlighting its importance for the company. She said that this achievement wouldn’t have been possible if not for the outstanding work of her team.</p>
<p>Obtaining Spanish certification is a significant achievement for us as an iGaming content provider and a testament to the hard work and dedication of our team. Marina Ostrovtsova, CEO, BGaming</p>
<p>Ostrovtsova added that BGaming is excited to make a foray into Spain and supply “high-quality gaming experiences” to local operators and players. She concluded that the BMM Testlabs certification is a testament that BGaming’s games are fair.</p>
<p>With this certification, players in Spain can rest assured that our games are safe, secure, and fair. Marina Ostrovtsova, CEO, BGaming</p>
<p>BGaming Continues Its International Growth</p>
<p>In other news, BGaming recently signed an agreement with BetMexico, launching more content in Mexico. The move further highlighted the supplier’s desire to grow internationally and supply content to operators in many countries across several continents.</p>
<p>In February, BGaming also inked a content agreement with SkillOnNet, providing the company and its players with slots, arcade-style games and provably fair titles.</p>
<p>In March, BGaming welcomed Ulf Norder as its new chief commercial officer. Norder’s appointment was a huge milestone for the company because of the hire’s extensive experience with the iGaming sector.</p>
