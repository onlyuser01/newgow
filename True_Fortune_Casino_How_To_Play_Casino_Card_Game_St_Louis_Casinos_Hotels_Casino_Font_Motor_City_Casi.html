    <h1>True Fortune Casino How To Play Casino Card Game St Louis Casinos Hotels Casino Font Motor City Casi</h1>

<p>While looking for an online casino that accepts Mastercard deposits, I came across Casino vegasplus via the website https://www.spielhallentest.com/ (https://www.vegasplus.com/de). I first informed me about the casino here https://de.casino.guru/vegasplus-casino-rezensions and, based on the positive review, registered there on Tuesday, April 6th.</p>
<p>I deposited 100 euros and received 100% bonus money. After I had completely gambled away the stake and bonus, I successively deposited another 400 euros without a bonus. These were debited from my credit card account on Thursday, April 8th.</p>
<p>I made huge profits as a result. Since this casino only allows a withdrawal of EUR 1,500 per week, I wanted to make a withdrawal when this limit was reached. But then I had to find out that a payout is only possible after the KYC documents have been fully verified. So I have the necessary documents (ID, proof of address, credit card) on Wednesday, April 7th. uploaded. Then the usual procedure began and some documents (which I had already successfully used at other casinos) were rejected. I've re-created and uploaded this. On Thursday, April 8th, the documents were accepted and I was able to order the payment via bank transfer ("We have successfully received your payment request. The current status of your request is" Pending ". The transaction should be processed within 24 business hours As soon as this happens, you will receive an e-mail from us. We will keep you up to date. ").</p>
<p>In addition, on April 8th, I received a call from a Vegasplus casino manager on a Frankfurt phone number who offered me a bonus. This happened even though I did not consent to the advertising measures.</p>
<p>On Friday, April 9th, I received the following cryptic email</p>
<p>"Withdrawal request denied</p>
<p>Hello xx, Unfortunately your withdrawal cannot be processed at this time due to the need to play the amount of your first deposit as per Terms and Conditions 7.2.</p>
<p>Please log into your account and make sure all the details are correct, then resubmit your request.</p>
<p>Many Thanks,</p>
<p>The VegasPlus team "</p>
<p>The GTC 7.2 are:</p>
<p>"Every real money deposit is subject to the internationally recognized AML (AML = Anti-Money Laundering) rules. This is a security regulation that aims to prevent international money laundering. Therefore, we will in case of withdrawal requests regarding funds that are not used for betting who have refused to withdraw. "</p>
<p>????</p>
<p>Since then, it has no longer been possible to log into my account. A message appears, "Your account is blocked for security reasons. Please contact to unblock it".</p>
<p>Although the mail didn't say who to contact, I tried to chat. The support replied in the chat that the account had been deleted and that I should send an email to support kundenservice@vegasplus.com.</p>
<p>I did that on Friday, April 9th, except for the message that a ticket had been created but got no response.</p>
