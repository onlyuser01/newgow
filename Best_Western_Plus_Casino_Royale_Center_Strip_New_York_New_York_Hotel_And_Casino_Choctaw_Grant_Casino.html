    <h1>Best Western Plus Casino Royale Center Strip New York New York Hotel And Casino Choctaw Grant Casino</h1>

<p>Dear Basel,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint and for forwarding all the relevant communication. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. Before we’ll contact the casino and ask for their standpoint, could you please forward your cashier history? My email address is petronela.k@casino.guru. Could you please specify how much is your active balance at the moment?</p>
<p>I have checked terms and conditions, and this is what I found https://www.zevcasino.com/en/static-texts/terms-and-conditions:</p>
<p>„ CLOSURE AND TERMINATION BY YOU</p>
<p>14.1 Provided that Your Account does not show that a balance is due to us, You are entitled to close Your Account and terminate the Terms of Use on not less than twenty four hours’ notice to us at any time, by contacting us through support@zevcasino.com:</p>
<p>14.1.1 indicating Your wish to close Your Account; and</p>
<p>14.1.2 stating the reasons why You wish to close Your Account, in particular if You are doing so because of concerns over the level of Your use of the same.</p>
<p>We will respond to Your request, confirming closure of Your Account and the date on which such closure will be effective, within a reasonable time, provided that You continue to assume responsibility for all activity on Your Account until such closure has been carried out by us (at which point the Terms of Use shall terminate).</p>
<p>14.2 When You request closure of Your Account under paragraph 14.1 we will, subject to paragraph 13.3, return any outstanding balance in Your Account to You."</p>
<p>I hope we will be able to help you to resolve this issue as soon as possible. Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
