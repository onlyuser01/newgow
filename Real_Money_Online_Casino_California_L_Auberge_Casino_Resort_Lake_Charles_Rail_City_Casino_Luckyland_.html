    <h1>Real Money Online Casino California L Auberge Casino Resort Lake Charles Rail City Casino Luckyland</h1>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am querying two large transactions where I was charged high fees that are outside of MyStake's own Terms &amp; Conditions. My first withdrawal on 02/01/23 was supposed to be for £6000.00 however £5779.32 was paid into my account via a SEPA transfer. The second withdrawal on 01/02/23 was again supposed to be for £6000.00 however £5829.14 was paid into my account, also via SEPA transfer.</p>
<p>When I queried this with MyStake Customer Service they said it had to be my bank who took a transfer fee, I have raised this with my bank multiple times and they confirmed no fee was deducted by them therefore it had to be on MyStake's end. With all due respect, I am more inclined to believe my multinational bank over this unlicensed casino. I have never had this issue before with any other casino.</p>
<p>Please note the monies owed I initially calculated as £391.54 however MyStake's Terms do state a maximum fee can be applied to withdrawals of €16 which x2 is €32 (equivalent to approximately £29 in my currency at the time of year these transactions were made, I will round up to £30 allowing for varying exchange rates) therefore I am owed £361.54 but have had to round down to £361.00 as your website does not allow for values with pence.</p>
<p>I would very much appreciate your team's cooperation with this matter as I have raised this before with MyStake's Live Chat and they just say it must be my bank and don't seek to investigate further.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>
