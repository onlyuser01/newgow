<p>NetBet has expanded its collection of games with Darwin Gaming, a leading online supplier for the iGaming sector</p>
<p>Thanks to this newly-formed alliance, NetBet will grow its library by featuring titles from the mobile gaming specialist which has been building its own portfolio at a rapid clip. Darwin Gaming offers a selection of exciting and worthwhile choices, including Crash Evolution, Judgement of Anubis, and The Blackjack, among others.</p>
<p>NetBet Gets Solid Content Injection</p>
<p>Meanwhile, NetBet has had more than 20 years of experience building an impressive portfolio that is available across numerous jurisdictions. Presently, NetBet features some 5,000 games on its list, which makes it one of the largest operators in terms of the sheer volume of content it can offer its players.</p>
<p>NetBet PR manager Claudia Georgevici was similarly excited about the partnership and said that having Darwin Gaming’s titles available to NetBet’s players was a huge plus for the operator as well.</p>
<p>“By joining forces with Darwin we continue to bring NetBet.com customers the diverse and dynamic gaming experience for which we’re known, all over the world,” Georgevici said. Darwin Gaming CEO Nuno Gonçalinho was similarly excited to see this new opportunity with NetBet form up.</p>
<p>NetBet is a global behemoth in the iGaming space, which means that Darwin Gaming stands to benefit from new audiences and extend its existing clout in markets it already operates in.</p>
<p>Partners Confident in the Success of Collaboration</p>
<p>Gonçalinho spoke with confidence, arguing that the partnership would lead to new and better experiences and a revolution for players worldwide.</p>
<p>“Brace yourself for an exhilarating journey where innovation knows no bounds, and our collaboration propels us to new heights of success and player delight,” Gonçalinho added. Darwin Gaming also develops games such as branded titles, crash and mines, bingo, table games, and slots, among many others.</p>
<p>Among the popular games developed by the company are Val’s Haunted Party, Crash Single, Luva Power Basket, Formula Beto, and so many more. NetBet has been building up its footprint with numerous individual and aggregation partnerships.</p>
<p>To this end, the company announced partnerships with Wazdan, a prominent supplier of some of the finest iGaming titles, and SlotMatrix RGS, a platform owned by EveryMatrix, that aggregates third-party games and distributes them to partner operators.</p>
