<p>Such a move would have significant implications, bolstering the operator’s competitiveness and benefiting players via increased prize pools</p>
<p>BetMGM recently hinted at an imminent move to introduce shared liquidity between its online poker platforms in New Jersey and Michigan. This initiative could position the company as the third multi-state online poker platform in the United States, alongside PokerStars and WSOP.com. These other operators have demonstrated the value of such consolidation, likely motivating BetMGM’s decision.</p>
<p>Poker Remains among BetMGM’s Leading Products</p>
<p>The specific timeline for BetMGM Poker’s shared liquidity has yet to be detailed, as the company’s recent announcement only used the term “imminent,” leaving some ambiguity. While BetMGM operates in Pennsylvania, the state hasn’t joined the Multi-State Internet Gaming Agreement (MSIGA) that facilitates cross-state online poker play.</p>
<p>During BetMGM ’s most recent business update, CEO Adam Greenblatt emphasized the company’s continued dedication to digital gaming, emphasizing that online poker remains a significant part of its strategy. BetMGM has been increasingly promoting online poker by collaborating with MGM Resorts properties for live tournaments held at venues such as Aria and Borgata.</p>
<p>We are confident that we will be able to advance our competitive position as our business and products continue to develop. Adam Greenblatt, BetMGM CEO</p>
<p>BetMGM remains ready to seize new opportunities to expand its market share. West Virginia recently entered the MSIGA, indicating the operator may soon expand its regional offerings with online poker. Additionally, Connecticut has legalized online gaming and poker, prompting interest from state tribes and leaders to join the MSIGA and offering potential opportunities for MGM and other operators.</p>
<p>PokerStars Highlights the Benefits of Such a Merger</p>
<p>Combining the player pools of New Jersey and Michigan is expected to result in larger prize pools and a broader player base for BetMGM. PokerStars implemented a similar merger in January, effectively combining players from different states. The impact of shared liquidity was notable in both states, with increased cash game traffic and tournament participation.</p>
<p>PokerStars indicated that tournament prize pools had surged by approximately 25% in 2023, demonstrating the positive effects of a larger player pool. These results are not unexpected, significantly benefiting the operator and its players and setting a positive example for competitors. BetMGM likely hopes to achieve similar results, eventually merging other states.</p>
<p>As BetMGM prepares for this anticipated shared liquidity launch, it aims to leverage its scale to enhance global jackpots and further fortify its position in the thriving online poker landscape. The operator noted that its multi-product jurisdictions had higher absolute revenues, exploring synergies and allowing players to experience more of its high-quality offerings.</p>
