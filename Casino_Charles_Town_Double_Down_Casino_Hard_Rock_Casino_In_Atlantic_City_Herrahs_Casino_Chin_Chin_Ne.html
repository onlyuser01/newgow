<p>Recent Layoffs, Furloughs in Las Vegas Tourism</p>
<p>But the post-internship job picture is uncertain unless a predicted rebound comes soon to the casino and hotel sectors in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>Last month, Penn National Gaming laid off workers, with word that 159 employees were being let go at Henderson, Nevada’s M Resort Spa Casino.</p>
<p>Most prominent layoffs were at MGM Resorts International during 2020. In August, MGM formally terminated approximately 18,000 workers in response to COVID-19.</p>
<p>Another property, The Tropicana, located on the Las Vegas Strip, laid off 702 employees in October. As of January, it planned to lay off 132 more workers starting at the end of December 2020 and into this year, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported.</p>
