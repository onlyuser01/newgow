<p>Esports betting agency Rivalry continues to grow its international footprint. As this happens, the company is hiring new people to assist it with what is shaping up to be a busy year ahead. The latest addition is Liam Doherty, who will step in as VP of marketing.</p>
<p>Marketing to Play Key Role in 2022</p>
<p>Doherty will spearhead Rivalry’s marketing efforts as the company seeks to connect with the “next-generation” consumers across sports and esports. Doherty will be tasked with creating and executing global marketing campaigns that will help the business deliver on key KPIs.</p>
<p>The new executive will be working with numerous divisions of the company to establish the best course of action. Doherty will develop activations, social media campaigns, and other promotional materials that reflect on the Rivalry brand and help it grow in a sustained and organic manner.</p>
<p>Commenting on this, Rivalry CEO and co-founder Steven Salz said that he was thrilled to welcome Doherty onboard:</p>
<p>“Liam joining Rivalry represents a step function change in the caliber at which we will be executing from here on out in terms of brand, marketing, and campaigns.” Rivalry CEO and co-founder Steven Salz</p>
<p>Salz praised Doherty’s experience, who has worked with Popeyes, Adidas, and Old Spice. Rivalry began as a fully esports-focused platform, but it has quickly moved past that while still retaining a great deal of focus on competitive video gaming.</p>
<p>Building the Future of Betting</p>
<p>The company created engaging betting experiences that transcend a single vertical and are equally applicable to different aspects of the betting experience. The company sends an unmistakable message about its future, arguing that it would seek to build next-generation experiences.</p>
<p>Rivalry also saw strong performance markers throughout the last financial quarter, indicating that its rapid growth has not encumbered its profitability. Rivalry is going through 2022 debt-free, and with millions of ready cash, it can muster on a whim to propel further growth.</p>
