    <h1>Choctaw Casino Hotel Rooms Casino In Danville Virginia Casinos In Destin Florida Firekeepers Casino</h1>

<p>Gaming Innovation Group (GiG) is rapidly positioning itself to be a formidable player in the North American gaming sector. As the region continues to experience tremendous growth, the B2B tech and media solutions company wants to be involved wherever it can showcase its services. To do that, it has now recruited a long-time sales executive to lead the charge.</p>
<p>David Elmore Joins GiG</p>
<p>David Elmore was previously at New Jersey-based gaming regulatory lab GLI, where he spent 14 years helping the company expand its footprint. In his most recent position with GLI, he served as its Global Sales and Development Manager. This experience and the network he built will be vital in his new role as GiG’s VP Sales for North America, where he will be “responsible for contributing and delivering the commercial strategy,” according to a press release by GiG.</p>
<p>Part of that commercial strategy includes finding new targets for GiG’s data solutions. Having worked extensively with the industry and coming equipped with a deep understanding of the regulatory challenges being faced, Elmore can easily transition into his new role. He asserts, “I am eager to build on the solid foundation that has been developed over the last decade. GiG is perfectly positioned to partner with state and tribal clients to digitally transform their gaming business and to create a unique customer experience.”</p>
<p>He added, “Success for GiG and our clients is based on integrity, loyalty, and long-term trust. These core values support the building of GiG’s presence in North America.”</p>
<p>North America, the Land of Gaming Opportunity</p>
<p>There’s no shortage of opportunities for gaming companies in North America, with the sports betting and iGaming segments rapidly expanding in the US and Canada. GiG has several deals already in the works, including a recently-signed partnership with Playstar and its ambitions in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. It is also eyeing Ontario and other Canadian provinces, optimistically preparing for significant expansion throughout the region.</p>
<p>Martin Collins, who heads up GiG’s Sales and Business Development department, adds of Elmore’s ability to help the company, “I am delighted to welcome David to the team and for GiG to be able to leverage his extensive network and knowledge of the complex but very lucrative US market. GiG has a rich history in delivering solutions and we believe our continued innovation across our product portfolio and market-leading services are incredibly relevant in the market and we are sure with David on board, we can accelerate growth in these markets.”</p>
