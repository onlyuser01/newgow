    <h1>Wind Creek Casino Atmore Live Blackjack Casino Lakeside Casino Osceola Largest Casino In Oklahoma Ha</h1>

<p>So I was offered 43 free spins on a game called warrior conquest. In one minute I finished the spins with a balance of $10.75 (Charlie your winnings is coming form a free chip, the rules was:</p>
<p>43 Spins on Warrior Conquest</p>
<p>1x redemption only</p>
<p>Slots &amp; Keno only</p>
<p>40x Playthrough | $50 max cashout only.</p>
<p>Everything what was above $50 has been revoked. Are the rules they are going by and I followed. Keep in mind a 50$ cashout max. Instead of cashing out. I decided to play, which is now rightfully my money as won under their rules, so I started playing another game for over an hour and had some pretty good results. I had accumulated over $5000 that were withdrawable and showed as real money, not bonus, play through or any other non withdrawal kind. I started the withdraw process and it asked for My ID and some other information to finish the withdraw. I was having trouble uploading my Identification so I continued playing and had lost about 900$ when all of a sudden it said I had insufficient funds to finish bet. I was betting 50$ bets and had 4300 left when the money vanished. I was told it was a cupon reversal withdraw. No where does it state that the winnings from the free spins are subject to confiscation without notice. I was allowed a max 50$ cashout which I was in compliance with, the free spin deposit was approved of 10.75$ and I was allowed to continue playing for an hour before the stole my money. It is clearly theft because I was in the guidelines of the 50$ cashout they stated in the rules of free spin play. My cashout winnings of under 50$ that were rightfully won were used as real money to with the money that was confiscated by the casino on rules that did not apply to what now was money rightfully mine. I kept getting the rules from the spin recited to me but they failed to address the issue that the 43 spins were completed and done with . That only took one min. The fact that I played over an hour on the $10.75 until I reached 5000 and was able to really cashout for real, everything was takin during gameplay as I was playing. I could not cashout because my Identification wasn't fully submitted yet which is still in progress because they took the money before I could finish it. I had 99 comp points from that game play, which you can not get from free spin plays. I would say that this is theft, misleading and not right because the 50$ max cashout was the money I used to get the 5000$. If I am wrong please tell me how. Yes I did use one free spin email in 2022 and one this year. I do not deal in crypto currency so I had no bitcoin wallet at the time. The rules I have met and filled to the best of knowledge the casino offered. I have attached photos of the transaction and the identification process that shows I had a withdrawable sum. Before they took the money it showed 5000$ . Now it shows zero. You can't withdraw zero so there would be no reason to ask for my identity. 99 comp points to. I only got 1 from the 43 free spins, the other 98 came from what was won from the those spins( max cash out of %50), which was 10.75. Rightfully my money as per game rules. When the spins were over it automatically stopped and deposited free spin winnings to my account, at that point those rules should have been done with as were the free spins and not added on to the 50$ cashout that is allowed.</p>
