<p>Recently rebranded PressEnter has expanded its online casino portfolio. The company has announced the launch of a new Western-themed casino called Rapid Casino. The new online casino is a strong addition to PressEnter’s growing portfolio and features, more than 2,000 games from top developers.</p>
<p>PressEnter Group Expands Its Online Casino Portfolio</p>
<p>PressEnter Group has announced that it introduced a new casino to its growing portfolio. Rapid Casino is the company’s sixth casino so far. Before introducing Rapid Casino, PressEnter Group launched Ultra Casino, NitroCasino, NeonVegas, 21.com, as well as JustSpin.</p>
<p>Now, once again, the company is expanding its portfolio and players of the new casino will be able to enjoy more than 2,000 games. Besides slots and table games, the online casino also offers live casino titles. Players can now find titles from NetEnt, Big Time Gaming, Pragmatic Play and many more leading industry developers. Licensed by the Malta Gaming Authority, Rapid Casino will launch its services for players within regulated markets.</p>
<p>Rapid Casino Tells a Story about the Wild West</p>
<p>According to PressEnter, the new Western-themed casino offers “an explosive player experience” while at the same time unfolding a unique story with every promotion. Rapid Casino tells the story of Trae Rapid. Although his parents were slaves in Mississippi, he managed to escape and was taught the cowboy ways by The Old Gunslinger. Rapid embarked on a journey seeking revenge for The Old Gunslinger’s murder, and this is how the legend about his persona was born.</p>
<p>Rapid Casino offers plenty of promotions for its players. Besides a “Wild Welcome Bounty,” the Western-themed casino offers a “Most Wanted” promotion, free spins and many more entertaining promotions.</p>
<p>PressEnter Continues to Grow Its Portfolio of Online Casinos</p>
<p>PressEnter was formerly known as Betpoint Group until its rebranding that happened last week. Rebranding is not a frequent occurrence, but it most certainly reaffirms when a company has been continuously growing. This is precisely the case with PressEnter as the company revealed that it has grown significantly from a single brand operator. Naturally, PressEnter said that rebranding was the next chapter for the company.</p>
<p>Rapid Casino is a strong addition to our impressive portfolio of online casinos and promises to deliver a superior player experience.” Lahcene Merzoug, CEO at PressEnter Group</p>
<p>Lahcene Merzoug, PressEnter’s current CEO, was hired in June of this year. At the time, the company was still known as Betpoint. Now, in light of the launch of Rapid Casino, PressEnter’s CEO acknowledged that the new casino is a strong addition to the company’s growing portfolio. Additionally, he outlined that Rapid Casino aims to deliver an unrivaled player experience. Merzoug added that the company remains focused on brands that entertain and engage with players but at the same time offer “a safe and responsible gaming environment.”</p>
