<p>Pragmatic Play has launched its new Darts game as part of the company’s Virtual Sports portfolio. Pragmatic, which is a developer and supplier of casino content for global tier-one operators, has been actively seeking to innovate its portfolio of products and offers.</p>
<p>Darts Becomes the Latest Addition to Pragmatic’s Virtual Sports Portfolio</p>
<p>The launch of Darts is another step in this direction. Players can explore a Darts game that has been tailored to fit the preferences of an iGaming crowd. The new title is marked by cutting-edge animation and has ultra-realistic player movement and expression, along with commentary and background music to ensure that you are having the best possible experience.</p>
<p>Players will get to play in matches from a list of 24 names and are required to play against every other competitor twice. The first throw rights alternate from one game to the next. Matches are played every two minutes to guarantee that you are getting plenty of action to boost revenue opportunities.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Pragmatic Play lets players pick from scheduled events, fixed-odds tournaments, and more, with each outcome coming down to a Random Number Generator (RNG). Pragmatic Play is further empowering the operators that wish to incorporate the Darts game through numerous customization options that will bring a variety of worthwhile options that can create branded experiences for each partner.</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play has already created an outstanding portfolio of Virtual Sports titles, including Penalty Shootout, Horseracing, Greyhound Racing, Fantastic League, Formula 1 and so many others.</p>
<p>Virtual Sports Is a Revenue-Boosting Vertical in the Industry</p>
<p>Speaking on this new release, Pragmatic Play COO Irina Cornides noted that the Virtual Sports vertical has become exceedingly popular with players from all backgrounds and that Pragmatic has been able to develop its own product and offering in it to provide players with the best possible experience.</p>
<p>Not least, Virtual Sports are associated with a boost to revenue, and Darts itself is a very popular game that deserves to be incorporated into the iGaming experience. “Our new virtual product builds on this success by offering darts betting fans a new way to enjoy their favorite sports,” Cornides noted.</p>
