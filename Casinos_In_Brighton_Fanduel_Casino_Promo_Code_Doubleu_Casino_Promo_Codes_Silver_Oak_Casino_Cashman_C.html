    <h1>Casinos In Brighton Fanduel Casino Promo Code Doubleu Casino Promo Codes Silver Oak Casino Cashman C</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>sorry to hear about such an issue. I believe that casinos or more specifically the casino's system or risk department probably flagged you. I can only speculate about the cause, but I would guess, that there are some similarities with other accounts, and the casino decided to organize a verification call.</p>
<p>Meaning, they need to be sure that it was you who registered, deposited, and played, that you only used your payment options, as well that you played only by using one active account.</p>
<p>They will ask you a series of questions about your account, games you played, and methods you used for depositing, those are the information you are supposed to answer with ease to pass the verification. It is the best tool how to confirm your identity in case there are some similarities with other profiles or other doubts from the casino's side.</p>
<p>I can understand that the casino is not pretty interested in explaining the whole situation because it could spoil the results of this check, seems that the casino wants to investigate first.</p>
<p>I can imagine that this all put you under pressure, but I still think that you should try to cooperate.</p>
<p>It is always the easiest way.</p>
<p>Try to stay calm and let us know how it goes, in case you need help just ask.</p>
