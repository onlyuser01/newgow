<p>Mr Green, one of William Hill’s flagship brands, is entering the Latvian markets, with the company leveraging the expertise of 11.lv, another William Hill asset in the country.</p>
<p>William Hill Breaks Ground in Latvia with Mr Green</p>
<p>William Hill has broken ground in the Latvian iGaming market once again with the roll-out of Mr Green and thanks to a license issued by the Lotteries and Gambling Supervisory Inspection of the Republic of Latvia.</p>
<p>The company continues to build up its footprint in the Baltics, reinforcing its clout in Latvia after previously buying out MRG Group and its flagship 11.lv brand. MRG Group acquired 11.lv back in 2018.</p>
<p>Moving forward, William Hill will also be in charge of Mrgreen.lv, another brand that was originally the property of MRG Group before the buy-out, benefiting not only the local ecosystem but also bringing the lessons learned through 11.lv to good use on the Mr Green domain.</p>
<p>Commenting on this partnership, William Hill Latvian Operations CEO Janis Tregers said that the arrival of Mr Green is an opportunity for the company to further shape the market in its image. Despite the challenges 2020 threw at the industry and consumers, the news that there is still room for growth has been inspiring, Tregers noted.</p>
<p>Ready to Grow, Ready to Double Market Share</p>
<p>Any extra time the brand has had, Tregers said, was used to develop quality entertainment product and leverage it towards the building of a safe and fair environment for everyone. William Hill International and CEO Mr Green Ltd, Patrick Jonker, spoke favorably of the team’s expertise in the Baltics.</p>
<p>He praised the know-how the local Latvian team is bringing to the table and said that combining that knowledge with a renowned brand such as Mr Green is a winning combination and the company looks forward to doubling its presence in the Latvian market.</p>
<p>“Of course, we are also excited to be using the Green Gaming framework to further solidify our group’s leadership in the Responsible Gaming area of our business,” Jonker concluded.</p>
<p>Latvia remains an important market within the iGaming industry. Companies such as Enlabs AB have been present in the country for years now.</p>
<p>Recently, GiG entered a partnership with Latvian operator Admirālu Klubs as a testament to the strong local iGaming market. William Hill’s US assets were subject to a now approved acquisition by Caesars Entertainment.</p>
