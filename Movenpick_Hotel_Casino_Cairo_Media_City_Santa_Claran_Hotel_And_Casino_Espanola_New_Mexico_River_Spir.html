<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The calming soundtrack is accented with string notes and flutes. The music induces a relaxed spiritual feeling well-suited to the theme. A gong sounds upon wins, adding a sense of majesty to the moment.</p>
<p>The animation has a high-quality look and consistent colorful aesthetic. The symbols include a friendly monkey and kindly bird, both dressed in formal East Asian attire. Softly glowing lanterns also appear, subtly printed with card suits.</p>
<p>One of the most stunning symbols is the nine-tailed fox spirit, who floats in her reel adorned with red ornaments. Her white fur seems to glow and her large eyes are irresistibly cute.</p>
<p>The other showstopping symbol is a magical fox-girl with qualities of both human and animal. She wears a glamorous ensemble and smiles at the player mischievously.</p>
<p>A fox mask appears on the reels as well, embellished with flowers and an enigmatic expression. Shimmers surround the mask, suggesting it is no ordinary decoration.</p>
<p>Overall, the music and animation give this game an ethereal atmosphere.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Tale of Kyubiko is a three reel, three row slot, with 5 win lines.</p>

<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols. The Inari Stacked Wild does the same with some additional features.</p>
<p>The Inari Stacked Wild has the chance to nudge to cover an entire reel if it lands even partially. This nudging onto the reel will happen if the Inari Stacked Wild would contribute in a winning combination.</p>
<p>The Inari’s Dance feature occurs when players win with an Inary Stacked Wild. These wins trigger a re-spin with a multiplier that increases up to x25. For each re-spin, the Inari Stacked Wild moves to a randomly selected reel.</p>
<p>Respin feature with multipliers is the only bonus feature of the game</p>
