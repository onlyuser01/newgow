    <h1>Virgin River Hotel Casino Casino Slots Online Real Money Choctaw Pines Casino French Lick Casino Red</h1>

<p>The Iowa Tribe of Oklahoma’s latest press release revealed some of its plans regarding the new project, including its approximate location. Onboarding Caesars as a management partner will add much-needed expertise, while the Harrah’s brand will substantially bolster the new venue’s appeal. The partnership builds on Caesars Entertainment’s relationship with US tribes and should significantly benefit both parties.</p>
<p>Details about the New Project Are Still Scarce</p>
<p>Little is yet known regarding the Iowa Tribe’s newest integrated resort project. The initial press release places the venue somewhere off Interstate 44. Given the Iowa Tribe’s reservation boundaries, that would put the casino resort between Tulsa and Oklahoma City. While the tribe did not announce a start date for construction, Caesars’ involvement should significantly speed up the process.</p>
<p>The leading casino operator was a natural choice for the Iowa Tribe thanks to its history of successful partnerships with US tribes. Recently, the company expressed its intention to partner with tribes in Maine, hopefully overcoming the region’s inhospitable business environment. Compared to that, cooperating on a new integrated resort in a developed market should not pose a challenge.</p>
<p>Both Parties Were Excited to Bolster Oklahoma Gaming</p>
<p>The Iowa Tribe of Oklahoma currently runs two properties- Cimarron Casino and Ioway Casino. A new property under the Harrah’s brand should bring significant long-term returns, providing guests with a world-class experience. Iowa Tribe of Oklahoma Chairman Perri Ahhaitty lauded the operator’s contributions to tribal gaming and expressed confidence in the new venue’s future success.</p>
<p>We look forward to a long and prosperous relationship with Caesars and the local community with the brand-new Harrah’s right here in Oklahoma. Perri Ahhaitty, Iowa Tribe of Oklahoma Chairman</p>
<p>If successful, the new casino will be a significant boon to the tribe, providing much-needed employment opportunities and bolstering the resources available to local communities. Caesars Entertainment SVP of Development Robert Livingston was proud to partner with the Iowa Tribe and help them achieve their objectives. The move should also be a significant boon to the operator, extending its reach into the Sooner State.</p>
<p>With properties throughout the Midwest, Harrah’s is the perfect brand fit for Oklahoma. Robert Livingston, Caesars Entertainment SVP of Development</p>
<p>Such partnerships form the cornerstone of Caesars’ growth strategy. While such aggressive expansion has incurred substantial financial debt, the operator’s Q1 report indicates strong investment returns. The upcoming Harrah’s casino in Oklahoma should be no exception, building on the company’s success and strengthening its relationship with local tribes.</p>
