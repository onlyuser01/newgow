    <h1>Bangor Hollywood Casino Duckyluck Casino No Deposit Bonus Bitcoin Casino Online No Deposit Welcome B</h1>

<p>On December 11, a new version of the Wheel of Prizes promotion was launched in a Christmas theme, and I was officially invited to it. For every $50 spun, one could earn 35 additional spins on the wheel.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there were technical issues and I noticed that I should have received some extra spins several times that weren't added. This was the case for some players but for others, their spins were added instantly. By the end of December 11, I reported this issue through the chat and I was informed that this problem was quite widespread and not just affecting me. A week has passed since my report and the promotion is ending soon. I'm fearful that they'll soon tell me that the promotion is over and that I will not be compensated for the extra spins I did not receive for two and a half days (from December 11 to the noon of December 13). I repeatedly sent emails about this issue. Initially, they asked me to wait, but then a consultant got short with me and did a quick calculation. According to him, €1400 divided by 50 results in 14 extra spins and with a daily one spin for the last 24 hours, it's 21 spins. Therefore, he decided that my problem has long been solved. However, I quickly pointed out their mistake. €1400 divided by 50 gives 28 spins and with 7 days, it's 35 spins which is what I should have rightfully received from the whole Christmas Wheel of Prizes challenge.</p>
<p>Since pointing out their mistake, no resolution was made to my problem, and I am still waiting for their response. I have contacted their team on Twitter, Facebook and the PokerStars community, but I only received a copy-pasted message in return. It's as though they aren't even reading my messages and each time I ask for an update, I'm told they have a backlog of complaints and my issue has yet to be resolved. It's rather ridiculous to think that they are incapable of calculating the spins I've made over a 7-day period. A consultant was able to do this during our live chat in 20 minutes, but it's now been three weeks without a solution from their technical team. I feel disrespected and deceived which is why I am not willing to drop this issue.</p>
