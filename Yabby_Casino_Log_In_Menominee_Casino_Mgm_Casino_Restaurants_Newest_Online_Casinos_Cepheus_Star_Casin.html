    <h1>Yabby Casino Log In Menominee Casino Mgm Casino Restaurants Newest Online Casinos Cepheus Star Casin</h1>

<p>Hello! With respect I treat you as guides of sites. I constantly use your information on sites. But I had a chance to deal with a site that runs a dishonest gambling business. We are talking about a casino resource about which you, as a site guide, have a very good opinion. You have this site in good standing with a high rating it is the site of Casino Bongo. gg (((((((. I am very discouraged by this site, not only did I run into a problem with the game, so in addition the site does not withdraw funds, citing the fact that there are problems on the side of the payment provider, although all this is solid deception, and I can prove it to you that in fact everything works for them correctly.It started like this, with the initial withdrawal request on my balance sheet was 12,000 UAH, I wanted to withdraw the entire amount at once. deposit within 24 hours from the moment of application.When I tried to withdraw 6000 thousand, a refusal also occurred.I turned to the support chat to find out why the application was not given, to which I received the answer that there are temporary difficulties with the solid method, when I offered another method bank card to me refused and said that the withdrawal is carried out to the bank card with which the deposit was created. To my question when the system will work, I was told that nothing was known. It took somewhere a couple of hours ov, I again tried to withdraw the amount that allowed me and this is 6000 UAH, but the transactions were not even created. Then I remembered that it is possible that you need to create applications up to 4999 UAH, since there are sites that do not withdraw more than the amount in one transaction, unfortunately it didnâ€™t help ((! And now the most interesting thing !!!!!!!! I decided to try to withdraw a small amount and Three requests go !!!!!!! Three requests for 900 UAH And how could this happen ???? If the system temporarily does not work, it will not skip all requests at all, regardless of the amount. I began to write to the support chat again how this could be. To which I was told that from time to time for small amounts of applications go through. In general, saazali repeat the withdrawal of funds in a couple of days. More time has passed the situation is still unchanged today I managed to put another request for 1000 UAH Dear guide, this is a complete deception !!!!! It is profitable for this casino resource to withdraw funds this way, because after every second application a commission is charged (5% !!!!!!!) That's right. I let them withdraw 14,900 UAH when by such a barbaric method for each next deposit I lose 5%! I believe that you are obliged to understand and evaluate this site !! I wanted to write you another 48 hours ago, but after listening to them I decided to give it to you, how it all happened in vain. Without you, I can't decide here. There are all screenshots !! To prove that this site can be equated to a site that has a dishonest gambling policy.</p>
