    <h1>Rhode Island Casino Renaissance Aruba Resort Casino Aruba Free Spin Casino 100 No Deposit Bonus Code</h1>

<p>I made a deposit of $198 on the May 25th 2023 and claimed 505INSTANT bonus code.</p>
<p>The terms and condition of the bonus back then indicated max cashout of 10 times deposit (I sent them a screenshot of the terms)</p>
<p>I won $3200 but the system fixed the balance to 10 times deposit exactly as the terms indicated to be $1982</p>
<p>The terms and condition were changed during June and now when I try to cashin they want to apply the new rules of this bonus which is 5 times deposit as max cashout which is of course not fair.</p>
<p>They are willing to pay $991 and they say they can change the terms whenever they want ...."The Casino reserves the right to alter, amend or withdraw any Game from the Casino at any time, as well as to alter prices, features, specifications, capabilities, functions or other characteristics of Services and/or Games. https://limitlesscasino.com/terms-and-conditions"</p>
<p>Of course they can change the terms whenever they want but they have to pay first the players that played the older terms.</p>
