    <h1>Casino Castle No Deposit Bonus Casino De Monte Carlo Casino Definition Casino Play Online Fitzgerald</h1>

<p>Did the site not give me the prize money from the free tournament? I registered at this casino site and decided to participate in a free daily tournament and first I decided to ask the support service if I can participate in the daily tournament, the support service employee told me that according to the terms of the site regarding the free daily tournament, the tournament is available only to those customers of the site who have deposited within a month, the minimum deposit is $ 20, and the employee told me that as a new client of the casino site, I will be made an exception and for me the site itself will deposit any minimum amount into my account in order for me to open the passage and access to the free slots tournament, support service employee asked me to wait a bit in the chat so that during this time he made a minimum deposit of $0.50 to my account, a small amount did not matter, because any minimum amount plays the role of a key for the tournament gate lock and that the gate opens for me to enter the free tournament , I thanked the site support employee and the site employee in response wished me GOOD LUCK and after leaving the chat I registered in a free tournament and started playing, the first day I lost but on the second day I took 1 PLACE with a prize of 800 TOR (TOR is inside the site currency 1 TOR is equal to 1 $), I was delighted and waited 48 hours according to the site conditions to receive a prize in order to wager 800 TOR with a 60x wager and multiply by playing 800 TOR up to 58000 TOR (800 * 60 = 58000) and after winning I could get $800 on my real account and after receiving $800 on my real account according to the site conditions $800 has a 2x wager so that I can withdraw a maximum of $1600 if I want to withdraw more than $800, I waited 48 hours to receive my 800 TOR prize and after it expires waiting time 48 hours, 800 TOR did not appear on my bonus balance, I contacted the support service and they told me that I should wait another 24 hours, after 24 hours I again contacted the support chat claiming that the site had not yet credited me my prize 800 TOR to my bonus balance, they started asking me about the exact date of the month of my winnings, and after a long questioning of them, I showed them several screenshots as evidence, and not finding any more reasons to accuse me, the site employee brazenly answered me I wrote in the chat that my bonus 800 TOR was not credited to me because I do not have the right to it and the reason for this is the site conditions for participation in the free tournament, the client needs to deposit a minimum amount of $20 answer and told the employee that as an EXCEPTION, as a new client, the site employee paid me ANY minimum amount: $ 0.50 to give me a CHANCE to WIN with full confidence that I, as a newcomer, would lose 99%, but when I TAKEN 1 PLACE, all site employees were in SHOCK and for this reason I was asked to wait another 24 hours after waiting 48 hours for the MANAGERS and staff of the site to discuss this RARE and UNUSUAL SITUATION, because all the new ones lost 120% to the many thousands of professional tournament players who are used to always winning. And after a long dispute between me and the staff and MANAGERS of the site in the chat and in my gmail mail. The case ended with the fact that for some reason they PRINCIPALLY stubbornly and brazenly stood their ground. I even suggested to them that if I can stop playing my 800 TOR and turn the bonus money into real money, then I will let them withdraw those $20 introductory money from my real account if I win, but they answered me with some kind of philosophical dimogogy and all the time pointing out the conditions of the site and specifically relying on their main reason: THE FREE TOURNAMENT IS ALLOWED ONLY TO PARTICIPANTS WHO MADE THE MINIMUM AMOUNT FOR 30 DAYS, I wrote them in response that: THEIR SITE STAFF MADE THE MINIMUM DEPOSIT FOR ME TSVE EXCEPTIONS AS A NEW CUSTOMER, But because of their REPUTATION because of GREED and ALLOCITY they firmly told me that they are 200% right in their IMPRESENT and LOW MEAN ACTIONS. I took a screenshot of the entire conversation from their chat and told them that I, using these SCREENS as PROOF OF THEIR FRAUD, will contact the relevant ORGANIZATIONS in order to fully EXPOSE and PENALIZE, I offered them options for solving this problem, YIELDING, but now I PRINCIPALLY wish not only to receive your winnings</p>
<p>The rest of all information and screen files are in my dialogue with your colleague Thomas</p>
