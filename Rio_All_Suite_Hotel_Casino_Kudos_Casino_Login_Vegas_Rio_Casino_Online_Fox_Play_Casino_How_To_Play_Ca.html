<p>Gennady Golovkin is one of the most impressive boxers of our time and he will be squaring up against Ryota Murata at Saitama Super Arena, Saitama, Japan on April 9. The fight billed as the Big Drama, will have the pair compete for the WBA (Super) IBF, and IBO middleweight titles and become an opportunity for boxing fans all over the world to watch a worthwhile bout.</p>
<p>Golovkin Takes on Murata in Upcoming Big Drama Fight</p>
<p>To help you not miss part of the action, you will also have cryptocurrency betting platform Stake.com as the ringside sponsor of the event, which is now rooting for Murata to win the fight and scoop all of these titles.</p>
<p>Stake.com, which has been sponsoring a number of events over the last year, including the Ultimate Fighting Championship, is going to be seen during the main event fight with the company’s logo present across the venue, and on the entrance shirt and trunks for Murata. Other prominent positions have also been booked by Stake.com and fans in attendance will participate in a special giveaway hosted by the firm on-site.</p>
<p>Talking about this opportunity, Stake.com sponsorships manager Dominic Rae welcomed the opportunity to be sponsoring the Big Drama fight in Japan and paying praise to Murata. Stake.com was stoked about the upcoming bout, Rae said:</p>
<p>“Everyone at Stake.com is eagerly anticipating the fight and both fans in attendance on the night and those watching worldwide are guaranteed a memorable night thanks to our in-arena giveaways and on-site promotions.” Stake.com sponsorships manager Dominic Rae</p>
<p>The venue has a capacity of 36,000 people in live attendance and the global audience is expected to run into seven figures. It’s understandably one of the most looked-forward fights this year, second only to Usyk versus Anthony Joshua and Tyson Fury versus Dillian Whyte. These bouts will determine whether a final showdown between Usyk and Fury would finally happen.</p>
<p>Stake.com and Murata Happy to Be Together in This</p>
<p>Commenting on the Stake.com ringside presence, Murata praised the platform for its ambition to be a leading gaming community where consumers can use cryptocurrency to access a variety of products and specifically sports betting. Murata argued that it was an honor to be joining Stake.com’s team of ambassadors and was looking forward to a win. He also praised Stake.com’s efforts to help organize a great event</p>
<p>“Fight fans coming to Big Drama in Japan should expect fireworks in the ring thanks to me and outside thanks to Stake.com.” Stake.com ambassador Ryota Murata</p>
<p>Stake.com has been actively expanding its reach in the world of sports. Previously, the company decided to grow its partnership footprint with the UFC and added Brazil as one of the targeted categories, ahead of the anticipated sports betting launch in the country.</p>
