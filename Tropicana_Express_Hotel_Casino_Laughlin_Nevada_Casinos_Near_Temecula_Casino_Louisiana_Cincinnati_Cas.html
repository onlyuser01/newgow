    <h1>Tropicana Express Hotel Casino Laughlin Nevada Casinos Near Temecula Casino Louisiana Cincinnati Cas</h1>

<p>This is the information I received from the casino representative:</p>
<p>"Dear Casino Guru,</p>
<p>After a careful examination of Mr. Downer’s account, it was concluded that he once again used modified credentials to be able to create another account with us while previously being registered with one that is blocked.</p>
<p>The account Mr. Downer registered with had modified details than previously, and once an account is closed, this means that you will not be able to register another account with those credentials.</p>
<p>On Mr. Downer’s attempt to register, it was clear that the system would not allow him to register; therefore, Mr. Downer has altered personal details in order to bypass the system and therefore being able to register at 21LuckyBet Casino.</p>
<p>Upon registration, Mr. Downer agreed to adhere to our Terms and Conditions and that these Terms and Conditions govern the contractual relationship between us.</p>
<p>Bearing the above in mind and the fact that there are several instances where our Terms and Conditions were breached; we consider that we had no other choice than to proceed forward with our relevant actions.</p>
<p>Mr. Downer has the right to refer the dispute to an alternative resolution (ADR) entity. The applicable entity is eCogra.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely</p>
<p>21LuckyBet Casino"</p>
