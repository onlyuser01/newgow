<p>Developer of software for the iGaming industry SoftSwiss announced today an expansion of its crypto solution with the addition of NEO, a new altcoin that is now part of the cryptocurrencies supported by the platform.</p>
<p>Expanding the List of Supported Cryptocurrencies</p>
<p>The newly added to SoftSwiss’ list of supported cryptocurrencies NEO is the cryptocurrency of a blockchain-based platform built around digital payments, identities and assets, linked within a smart economy model. It is ranked among the top 100 cryptocurrencies by CoinMarketCap.</p>
<p>“The SOFTSWISS Crypto Casino Solution is one of the most innovative and forward-looking in the brand product portfolio. Evolution of blockchain technology and constant changes in crypto regularly present new challenges, helping to develop our product in line with the latest industry requirements.” Vadim Drozd, Head of Payments, SoftSwiss</p>
<p>The integration of NEO marks the first new cryptocurrency integration for SoftSwiss in 2022, following numerous integrations last year, with Binance Coin (BNB), Cardano (ADA) and TRON (TRX) being the latest to be become available for payment options and gameplay to platform clients in December and expand the list of more than 20 major integrated cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), Dogecoin (DOGE), Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Tether (USDT).</p>
<p>“We closely follow the development of cryptocurrencies and are systematically expanding the list of those that our Online Casino Platform supports. The integration of NEO was, therefore, a logical decision as part of the development of the SOFTSWISS Crypto Casino Solution.” Vadim Drozd, Head of Payments, SoftSwiss</p>
<p>All-Round Solution for Gambling Startups</p>
<p>The SOFTSWISS Online Casino Platform currently offers White Label Solution, Turn Key Solution and Crypto Casino Solution to companies willing to launch gambling business, and powers operations for more than 300 online casino brands from jurisdictions around the world, Greece being the latest to authorize its services.</p>
<p>Besides the online casino solution, SoftSwiss offers additional products and services such as the sports betting platform SOFTSWISS Sportsbook, virtual jackpot system Jackpot Aggregator, Game Aggregator with more than 11,800 games supplied from over 170 gaming providers, and Managed Services providing full-cycle player care, to create an entire ecosystem for its clients, as each of these products can be easily integrated with the client’s online casino solution.</p>
