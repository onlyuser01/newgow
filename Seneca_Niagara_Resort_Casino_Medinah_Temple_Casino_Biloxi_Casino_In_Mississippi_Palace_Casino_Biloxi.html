<p>BetMakers teams up with PointsBet</p>
<p>The company is looking to boost its Australian market</p>
<p>Possible further expansion into the United States possible</p>
<p>PointsBet adds BetMakers as a live horse racing partner. The company is hoping to offer Australian customers improved experience and better horse racing betting statistics.</p>
<p>PointsBet Focuses on Expanding Horse Betting Offer</p>
<p>Australian sportsbook PointsBet has expanded its horse racing markets, including a customized racing channel and a partnership with a sports betting software developer BetMakers. The deal with BetMakers will allow PointsBet to make a full use of the live racing channel which will allow bettors to follow races in real time.</p>
<p>In addition, customers will now be allowed to see big data in real time, allowing them to place more accurate bets. An overlay will display data as well as bolster the live stream offer. Each week, customers of PointsBet will have access to over 2,000 horse racing events, making for a very big market.</p>
<p>The offer will be accessible from both desktop devices, but customers may also download a dedicated app for additional comfort. The online platform will use BetMakers’ expertise to stream races from the entire world, including Canada, the United Kingdom, the United States, Mexico and of course Ireland.</p>
<p>The @PointsBetSarge is up and priming for a big spring. He gives his best for today's racing. Will you be backing him in?</p>

<p>Australian customers will be able to benefit from this offer in full, as affirmed by the company’s official release. The company’s chief executive, Sam Swanell, had this to say when the announcement was made:</p>
<p>“We are always looking for ways to improve the offering to our clients and now our punters are able to watch and wager on a vast array of international racing events directly from our website and app.”</p>
<p>The news was welcomed with equal enthusiasm on the part of BetMakers, and the company’s chief exec Todd Buckingham. Buckingham summed up the partnership and future prospects in the following statement:</p>
<p>“PointsBet have built in the customised solution very quickly which is testament to their tech team and how quickly they can get a product to market.</p>
<p>BetMakers works with rights-holders from around the world to deliver racing content to their contracted operators. Commercially, BetMakers is remunerated by the rights-holders, while the operator has a commercial agreement with rights-holders. It’s easy to understand how this is winning solution for all parties involved.”</p>
<p>The U.S. Market Costly, Will It Boost Results?</p>
<p>PointsBet is hoping to make up for an income tax amounting to $41.9 million that the sportsbook reported in August. A point that has yet to be established is whether PointsBet will integrate BetMakers platform to cater to U.S. customers.</p>
<p>PointsBet has recently focused on expanding across the United States which has prompted the sportsbook to register high losses as part of the ambitions plan to be present in the United States. Employee benefits and staff expansion also contributed to the expenses which climbed up to $15.6 million.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the platform is hopeful to leverage the fast-expanding U.S. market and use its expertise in delivering horse racing coverage to explore new revenue potential.</p>
