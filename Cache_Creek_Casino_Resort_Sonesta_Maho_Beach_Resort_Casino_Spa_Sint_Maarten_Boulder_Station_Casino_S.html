    <h1>Cache Creek Casino Resort Sonesta Maho Beach Resort Casino Spa Sint Maarten Boulder Station Casino S</h1>

<p>I won $50 on free spins. I satisfied the playthrough, requested my $50 withdrawal and passed all the verifications. I was required to deposit $10 to verify my bitcoin account, which was in turn added to the $50 withdrawal request. So I waited 24 hours and contacted the casino via live chat. Sean Snow informed me that I would not be receiving my money due to too many free chips redeemed in a row. I was actually playing all of the free spins I received in the last month.</p>
<p>Why was I not warned, as I was playing all of the spins I have been awarded?</p>
