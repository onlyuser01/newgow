<p>The leading sports tech and premier online gaming operator in North America, FanDuel, announced it completed a new donation last week. The company revealed Wednesday it donated $1 million to the UNCF.</p>
<p>The new collaboration will see FanDuel provide financial support to students within Maryland's four Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). Those include the Coppin State University, Morgan State University, Bowie State University as well as the University of Maryland-Eastern Shore.</p>
<p>In a statement released on December 14, 2022, FanDuel Group's President, Christian Genetski, said that the company is excited to offer its services for the regulated gambling market in Maryland legally via its leading platform. He added that what's more important is that FanDuel joined forces with UNCF to help the growing HBCU community. Finally, the company's President said: "Our goal is that these funds help make a difference in the lives of hard-working students while also creating a track for some to join us at FanDuel as part of our summer intern program."</p>
<p>According to the latest announcement, the donation will help students by providing vital support for food, housing, and technology. FanDuel's donation will also help with education-related expenses such as tuition.</p>
<p>Besides the donation, via the new collaboration, the company agreed to "a track for students from the four schools to join its annual summer internship program at the company's headquarters in New York." This collaboration will undoubtedly deliver new experiences for the students.</p>
<p>The donation was completed as a check presentation, FanDuel Explained. The prestigious event was held at the FanDuel Sportsbook located at Live! Casino and Hotel in Hanover, Maryland. Celebrity guests of the ceremony included Santana Moss, the ex-Washington Commanders wide receiver, executives from FanDuel, as well as UNCF representatives.</p>
<p>The new donation comes on the heels of a partnership between FanDuel and ONE Championship, the largest martial arts organization in the world. Earlier this month, the duo joined forces that saw FanDuel expand its FanDuel TV network by bringing ONE Championship content. The deal brought martial arts for the first time to FanDuel TV.</p>
<p>Before that, back in October, FanDuel forged a new deal with Sportradar. The terms of the collaboration saw the company benefit from Sportradar's official NBA data.</p>
<p>Focusing on the UNCF once again, FanDuel's new donation marks the second time the company helped the organization. Back in February 2021, FanDuel together with the Washington Football team donated another $1 million to the UNCF. At the time, the donation was focused on helping students within Virginia's five HBCUs.</p>
