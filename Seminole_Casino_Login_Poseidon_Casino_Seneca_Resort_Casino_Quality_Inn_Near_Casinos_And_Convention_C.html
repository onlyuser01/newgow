<p>Red Rake Gaming has signed a deal with Pokerdom to offer its innovative and high-end iGaming portfolio to players in Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>Focus on an Innovative Player Experience</p>
<p>Online casino gaming supplier Red Rake Gaming has expanded its footprint in Eastern Europe via a content deal with Pokerdom, one of the region’s leading operators.</p>
<p>In a news release published today, Red Rake Gaming announced that Pokerdom and Joker Online will now have access to its entire game portfolio, including its best performing products and latest titles such as Diamond Cascade, Lorelei’s Pearls, Wild Animals, and Million777, Red Rake’s most recent and top tier game. Million777 offers one million different ways to win, with seven features and bonus content.</p>
<p>With its main focus on enhancing and innovating player experience and to develop its gaming offerings, Red Rake Gaming has been steadily growing and expanding in the casino game market.</p>
<p>Pokerdom Praises Red Rake’s “Premium Games”</p>
<p>This deal with Pokerdom attests to Red Rake’s high-quality casino products and its position as a top slot gaming developer.</p>
<p>According to the Marketing Director of Pokerdom, Julia Vaskovych, “Pokerdom offers its users only the best games from the leading slot games developers on the market,” as Red Rake’s “premium games” will be added to the company’s portfolio.</p>
<p>Red Rake Malta Managing Director Nick Barr declared that the new partnership with Pokerdom is a great opportunity for both companies and that Red Rake’s portfolio will be greatly appreciated by Pokerdom’s players “as demonstrated through our existing presence and strength in these markets.”</p>
<p>Red Rake Signs Multiple Content Deals</p>
<p>In September, Red Rake Gaming struck a deal with operator Moosh.pt, before signing a similar deal with Portugal’s leading sports betting and casino supplier Betway at the beginning of November. Last month, the casino game provider also reached an agreement with the top operator in Europe, BetVictor.</p>
<p>Via a deal with Rivalo last week, Red Rake is now quickly expanding over the Columbian and Latin American markets.</p>
<p>Red Rake also rolled out crucial partnerships with 888 and Entain, GVC’s recent rebranding, delivering its iGaming portfolio to multiple jurisdictions worldwide.</p>
