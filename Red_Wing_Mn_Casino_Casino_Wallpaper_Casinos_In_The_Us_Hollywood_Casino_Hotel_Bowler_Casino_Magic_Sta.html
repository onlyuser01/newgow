<p>Magic Stars 6 review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Magic Stars is another vaguely spaced themed slot from Wazdan. Like many other Wazdan offerings, Magic Stars 6 has a kind of trippy kaleidoscopic feel, with icons made up of gem-like geometric stars and a background of hyper-colourful milky way constellations.</p>
<p>The effect is visually striking and atmospherically compelling, and is executed with the kind of polish in the detail that Wazdan do particularly well.</p>

<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The theme exists more as a kind of style or tone than something more precise. The artwork is beautiful with the interstellar void rendered in the background truly gorgeous. The symbols on the reels are bright and sharply designed, for a batch of stars, each one feels distinct and unique.</p>
<p>The animations and sounds assist in selling this experience. The 80s synth soundtrack melds well with the animated twinkling on each symbol and the win and spin sounds are selected to work in the same milieu.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Magic Stars 6 is a six reel slot machine with three rows and twenty paylines.</p>
<p>The game uses a gamble feature that allows players the option of a double or nothing gamble on each spin’s winnings. If the player used the gamble feature they choose one of two stars, one of which is gold underneath. If the player picks the gold one, they double their stake. This can be rolled over up to six times.</p>
<p>There are also volatility settings: high, medium and low, and a simple free spin bonus to keep things interesting.</p>

<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter symbol. It also pays out of its own accord if it appears along a win line. When paying out, it is the highest value symbol, so keep an eye out for it.</p>
<p>Player gets 30 free spins for hitting 6 scatters</p>
<p>Three or more Scatter symbols result in the player getting a Free Spin Bonus. The number of free spins is determined by the number of Scatters. Three Scatters net the player fifteen free spins, while six scatters will get them 30 free spins.</p>
<p>During the free spins, a x3 multiplier is applied to all winning combinations.</p>

<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.49%, a little over our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.20. This should keep the lower stakes players happy, while high rollers can bet up to a maximum of $/£/€90.00 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is determined by a button which toggles between low, medium and high volatility. Our preferred slot strategies target the highest possible volatility. So everything else being equal, we recommend players opt for the highest level of variance in this game.</p>

<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Magic Stars 6 is a pretty slot with an outer space theme and trippy visuals. It has a rocking eighties soundtrack and beautifully thought through sound effects and animations.</p>
<p>The RTP is a little over average, certainly enough for us to give that aspect a soft thumbs up, and we like that the volatility is adjustable. Though for our slot strategies we would be keeping it on high.</p>
<p>Overall, this is a nice little slot and well worth a look.</p>
