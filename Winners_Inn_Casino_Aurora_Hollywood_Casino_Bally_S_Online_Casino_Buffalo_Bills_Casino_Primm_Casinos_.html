<p>The validation reaffirms the company's dedication to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and continue to expand and grow sustainably</p>
<p>The leading global gaming company, International Game Technology (IGT), announced that it secured validation for its near and long-term science-based commitments to reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The validation came from the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), effectively recognizing IGT’s commitment toward reaching net-zero GHG emissions by the year 2050. The SBTi is a global collaboration between the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC), DCP, World Wide Fund for Nature and the World Resources Institute.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the SBTi provides strategic guidance and promotes best practices when it comes to science-based target setting. Besides guidance for the commitments by different companies around the globe, the SBTi independently assesses and validates science-based targets.</p>
<p>The recent validation represents an important milestone for IGT on its way to reducing further GHG emissions. In fact, since 2017, the company has been a member of the UNGC. Reaffirming its commitment to sustainable growth and eliminating GHG emissions, the company adopted nine out of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals by the UN. Those rules were aligned by IGT with its sustainability strategy.</p>
<p>Recently, IGT confirmed its plans to showcase products at the upcoming Australasian Gaming Expo (AGE). At the event, set between August 15 and August 17, 2023, the company confirmed it plans to display its popular Peak cabinets and present other solutions and technologies.</p>
<p>IGT Reaffirms Near and Long-Term Sustainability Commitments</p>
<p>One of IGT’s near-term targets is to reduce absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions by 50% until the year 2030, from 2019. Additionally, the company plans to decrease Scope 3 GHG emissions by 30% while following the same timeframe.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the company has established long-term science-based commitments as well which involve reducing absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions by 90% by the year 2050 from 2019. Within the same timeframe, IGT anticipates a reduction of absolute Scope 3 GHG emissions by 90% as well.</p>
<p>According to the company, it “would then offset the residual 10% of emissions by 2050.” A priority for the IGT would be the reduction of direct emissions, while the residual emissions would be neutralized while following preset criteria by SBTi before the company hits net-zero emissions.</p>
<p>“Receiving this validation from the SBTi represents a milestone achievement for IGT as it reassures our stakeholders that we are committed to reaching net-zero GHG emissions.“ Wendy Montgomery, SVP of marketing, communications and sustainability at IGT</p>
<p>Wendy Montgomery, IGT’s SVP of marketing, communications and sustainability, acknowledged that SBTi’s validation marked a significant achievement that reaffirms the company’s commitment toward reaching net-zero emissions. Finally, she said that the established science-based targets enable IGT to grow sustainably while reducing GHG emissions.</p>
