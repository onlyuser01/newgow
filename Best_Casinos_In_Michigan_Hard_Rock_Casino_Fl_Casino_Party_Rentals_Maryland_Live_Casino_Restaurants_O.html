<p>BetMGM has become the fourth sportsbook to join Virginia’s fledgeling sports betting market on time for the Super Bowl.</p>
<p>Virginia Welcomes BetMGM as Fourth Sports Betting Operator</p>
<p>After FanDuel got a jump-start on competitors in Virginia, thanks to its tie-up with the Washington Football Team, BetMGM is making its mark on the state, launching its app with a number of available markets, including pre-game and in-play futures, parlays and more.</p>
<p>The company is just on time for the Super Bowl, which is taking place just days from now and gives sports bettors a good time window to register and put down their first legal wagers in Virginia.</p>
<p>BetMGM is a joint venture between MGM Resorts International and Entain, previously known as GVC Holdings, and it has been one of the most successful sports betting companies in the United States, even if it started to ramp up its operations a little after most other stakeholders.</p>
<p>As a result of the BetMGM launch in VA, customers will have access to the proprietary MGM Resorts’ M life Rewards program as well as redeem points directly at various MGM properties across the United States, including the Grand, Bellagio, and Aria in Las Vegas Nevada.</p>
<p>MGM Resorts and BetMGM are counting on both a great sports betting products and complementing this with synergies between the online gaming and retail markets, thanks to the dedicated rewards program.</p>
<p>Better yet, BetMGM is now available in 10 regulated markets and it is planning to continue scaling up its offer all throughout 2021. Commenting on the partnership, BetMGM chief executive Adam Greenblatt had this to say:</p>
<p>“We’re ecstatic that BetMGM is one of the first mobile sports betting platforms to launch in Virginia. Virginians are passionate sports fans, and we’re thrilled to provide them with a user-friendly sports betting experience.” -BetMGM chief executive Adam Greenblatt</p>
<p>BetMGM comes on the tails of others having launched it shortly before it with BetRivers and DraftKings also bringing their operations online. Overall, there have been 26 applications for sportsbooks and affiliate websites in the state.</p>
<p>The Virginia Lottery can only grant 12 sportsbook requests. Meanwhile, BetMGM continues to grow its footprint despite a failed takeover bid between the parent company’s owners.</p>
