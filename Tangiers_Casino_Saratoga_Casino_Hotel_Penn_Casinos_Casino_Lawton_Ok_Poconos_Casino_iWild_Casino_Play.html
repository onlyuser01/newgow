    <h1>Tangiers Casino Saratoga Casino Hotel Penn Casinos Casino Lawton Ok Poconos Casino iWild Casino Play</h1>

<p>Why do you want players to make a withdrawal after converting a bonus?</p>
<p>Instead of stuck players waiting for a withdrawal, you could have players who could be potential depositors.</p>
<p>If the casino converts this money into real cash (winnings instead of withdrawal in the mentioned term), the players who win from a bonus could continue playing and not wait for days.</p>
<p>When a player gets this bonus, converts it and tries to withdraw, he must wait how many days?</p>
<p>In this case, Delvecio didn't get any advantage when he played with the balance after the casino capped his winnings. He could keep the winnings if he withdrew the money and redeposit them.</p>
<p>Now, look at the best casinos in the industry. Do you think these casinos have unclear rules or trying to confuse players somehow? No, they know that everything must be clear for the players. And if the player accidentally does something bad (breach the max bet rule in one bet accidentally or some mistake in good faith.) These casinos would pay the player anyway because they know that this player will be loyal to them for that. If the casino finds an excuse to avoid paying, it will cost them potential players who instead choose a friendly casino.</p>
<p>I assume your goal is to have a good casino, but your biggest goal is to make money. And what affects your profits most is the player base. When your terms are clear, and players feel good, your player base will grow fast and profits too. However, when you use unclear rules to avoid paying, players will complain and be unhappy. Players will be writing their stories on the internet, your casino will become well known for unclear/unfair terms, and your player base will grow slower. Eventually, your player base will only be decreasing, and the casino will be closed after some time.</p>
<p>My justification is that this rule is wrong, confusing players, and they are lured into situations where they lose the money they could withdraw because of a trap.</p>
<p>In this case, your justification is that you have a rule in the terms and players needs to follow the rules.</p>
<p>It is not a surprise that these rules are in Curacao-licensed casinos. (It is because better licenses would never allow casinos to have these rules in their terms and conditions) and another surprise, when the players seek the regulator's help, the regulator responds: sorry, these rules are in the terms, so the casino has the right to void the winnings.</p>
<p>I assume that you see how unfair these rules are. By the way, not many casinos are using them, and all have terrible reputations.</p>
<p>Did you ever hear about these rules?</p>
<p>If you deposit €1000 and make 10x €100 bet and then make one more deposit of €100 to make another €100 bet, you breach this rule, and all winnings will be voided.</p>
<p>This rule is even more interesting because it affects all the players, not only the new ones.</p>
<p>This rule literally means that until you deposit at least 200, you can win only x10 of your deposit, so if you deposit a €100 and win a jackpot, then you get €1000 and bye-bye the rest of the money.</p>
<p>Now I would like to show you two other rules:</p>
<p>This rule is well known and commonly used in casinos, however, with a bit different wording:</p>
<p>The biggest problem that I see here is the rule itself:</p>
<p>Thank you for this opportunity to explain to you the logic of my decision.</p>
<p>Dear iWildcasino representative,</p>
<p>Thank you for this opportunity to explain to you the logic of my decision.</p>
<p>The biggest problem that I see here is the rule itself:</p>
<p>"1.1. Maximum possible withdrawal amount from no deposit bonuses received in the Bonus Shop: x5 of the amount of bonus or funds received from free spins (depends on the status of the account)."</p>
<p>This rule is well known and commonly used in casinos, however, with a bit different wording:</p>
<p>Maximum possible winnings amount…</p>
<p>Now I would like to show you two other rules:</p>
<p>In case that a player's total deposit amount is equal to or less than €200, the player will be limited to withdrawing up to x10 of the deposit in play. This rule will also be taken into account in a case where the Casinos sees that a player made additional deposits, specifically to surpass this rule.</p>
<p>This rule literally means that until you deposit at least 200, you can win only x10 of your deposit, so if you deposit a €100 and win a jackpot, then you get €1000 and bye-bye the rest of the money.</p>
<p>Placing total bets equal to or greater than 30% of the value of the smallest deposit currently in play. Including purchasing in-game features including but not limited to free spins with a total bet amount of 30% or greater than the value of the deposit.</p>
<p>This rule is even more interesting because it affects all the players, not only the new ones.</p>
<p>If you deposit €1000 and make 10x €100 bet and then make one more deposit of €100 to make another €100 bet, you breach this rule, and all winnings will be voided.</p>
<p>Did you ever hear about these rules?</p>
<p>(These rules applied to real money play.)</p>
<p>And now the logic:</p>
<p>I assume that you see how unfair these rules are. By the way, not many casinos are using them, and all have terrible reputations.</p>
<p>It is not a surprise that these rules are in Curacao-licensed casinos. (It is because better licenses would never allow casinos to have these rules in their terms and conditions) and another surprise, when the players seek the regulator's help, the regulator responds: sorry, these rules are in the terms, so the casino has the right to void the winnings.</p>

<p>My justification is that this rule is wrong, confusing players, and they are lured into situations where they lose the money they could withdraw because of a trap.</p>
<p>And now a big picture:</p>
<p>I assume your goal is to have a good casino, but your biggest goal is to make money. And what affects your profits most is the player base. When your terms are clear, and players feel good, your player base will grow fast and profits too. However, when you use unclear rules to avoid paying, players will complain and be unhappy.

<p>In this case, Delvecio didn't get any advantage when he played with the balance after the casino capped his winnings. He could keep the winnings if he withdrew the money and redeposit them.</p>
<p>Forcing players to make a withdrawal also makes no sense from a business perspective.</p>
<p>When a player gets this bonus, converts it and tries to withdraw, he must wait how many days?</p>
<p>If the casino converts this money into real cash (winnings instead of withdrawal in the mentioned term), the players who win from a bonus could continue playing and not wait for days.</p>
<p>Instead of stuck players waiting for a withdrawal, you could have players who could be potential depositors.</p>
<p>So, is my logic wrong?</p>
<p>Why do you want players to make a withdrawal after converting a bonus?</p>
