    <h1>Ocean Resort And Casino Flandreau Casino 4 Bears Casino And Lodge Grand Bay Casino Four Winds Casino</h1>

<p>Are you talking to me ? That came from magic lotto not I are you confused? Pure maths ? No clue I’m here to help you I’m not sure if you saw what I texted to Nick I’m on your side I have all the proof in the world when I make a statement I don’t want a penny this is the first time I’m saying anything after 50 years of gaming do you know or have you ever met anybody that plays for five days straight without sleep and food being brought to him so he won’t starve ? Would you like the names of the casinos that can verify what I just said it’s all in the history I never knew your site existed until last week and I always thought if someone is cheating it would get out through social media or something but I never saw anything in 50 years until I saw guru and it’s wonderful what you and your team are doing but from the complainants I’m reading they are spot on and I’ve personally at one time or another have experienced every one of them mostly multiple multiple times my only gripe is I can tell in five minutes maybe what may take your team a week or month or maybe never when I see an issue that is flat out criminal and guess what everyone I have experienced is criminal one way or another I have had lunch with senators governors and alderman presidents and I have photos it’s a bigger problem then the drug problem how do I know that play what I play 24/7 on these sites every day and you’ll become a walking bot I’m not seeking revenge but I saw your site I’m like cool maybe I can make there job easier and I have at least 6000 screen shots and so much information I don’t know how to bring it out properly and politically correct but if your not interested then I will stop but I have 15 20 25 plus sites that are criminals and cheats and each one with at least five issues that are totally different from each other cheat that is again any recouped money give it to charity I’ve lost millions and it doesn’t bother me a bit except when I find out plain as water that they cheat lie and steal but I’m doing this to the people that don’t have money to lose or they have an addiction issue so goodbye vim going back to playing I’m disconnecting from your site I wish you the best and support what you and your team are doing goodday radka I apologize if I offended you ✌️👍😢</p>
