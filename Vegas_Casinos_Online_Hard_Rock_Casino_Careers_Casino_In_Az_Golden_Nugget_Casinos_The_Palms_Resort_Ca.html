    <h1>Vegas Casinos Online Hard Rock Casino Careers Casino In Az Golden Nugget Casinos The Palms Resort Ca</h1>

<p>I am having problems getting my money that is in the casino because the casino does not want to approve the payment to my bank account. I started playing at Casinostugan in 2022, everything was fine. I won a few times and never had any problems withdrawing. My account was fully verified, as I uploaded all the required documents during the game. Since I was active in the game, I always left a part of the balance in the game account to continue playing.</p>
<p>Then, at the beginning of 2023, I stopped playing for a few months, but a large part of my previous winnings was left in my gaming account, SEK 593,000. On August 8, 2023, I came back and requested a withdrawal, but have yet to receive it. After I requested a withdrawal, Casinostugan for some reason decided to request documents for verification, claiming that I had not uploaded them before. I uploaded everything that was requested and got the reply that everything was in order with the documents. When I asked if I could now receive my money, I was told that my request had not yet been reviewed.</p>
<p>I was patient and gave them time to solve their questions. However, I have not received any updates on my request. I wrote again to find out why the payment was delayed, but received no information at all. They even stopped responding to my later messages!</p>
<p>I couldn't withdraw my money, but could play with it, and apparently Casinostugan was delaying so that I could lose all that money and then I would have nothing to withdraw. But to their great disappointment, that didn't happen... I just won even more! Now there is SEK 950,000 in my account, and now I can't even log into my gaming account. They have completely restricted my access to my account! When I wrote again to find out why they blocked me, they sent me a message a few days later explaining:</p>
<p>"After carefully reviewing your case, we have decided that your account with us will be closed and will remain closed. I would like to kindly refer you to the following provisions found in our customer terms and conditions:B.5.1 cd</p>

<ol>
<li>By outstanding balance is meant the sum of all deposits reduced by the wagered amount. Based on the conditions above, we can state that you have wagered all your deposits and a refund will therefore not be made."</li>

<p>I want to achieve justice and still hope to withdraw my money.</p>
