<p>Dream Hotel Group announced that it is finally starting the construction of its Dream Las Vegas hotel. The company’s new property sits on Las Vegas Boulevard, near McCarran International Airport.</p>
<p>The final version of the project will have 531 rooms and stretch 20 floors. The hotel will contain a selection of unique restaurants, 30,000 square feet of casino space, a nightclub, ballroom and meeting space, parking space for 825 vehicles, and various other amenities. The hotel is notably smaller than competing venues in the area and will instead focus on offering a boutique-style experience.</p>
<p>The Project Faced Multiple Delays</p>
<p>The initial plan was for construction to start in early 2021, but the project suffered several setbacks. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the construction lender temporarily became unable to provide financing, which delayed the start of the construction efforts by several months. During that period, the US Transportation Security Administration (TSA) froze the project due to security concerns related to the hotel’s proximity to the airport.</p>
<p>After several design changes, Dream Las Vegas finally received regulatory approval in October 2021. To meet the TSA’s recommendations, the hotel lost its ninth-floor pool club and all balconies facing the airport. The entire building was also moved slightly closer to the Strip. The changes aim to prevent cases similar to 2017 when a shooter staying at Mandalay Bay killed 60 people during the Route 91 Harvest festival. The man managed to break his hotel room window undetected before opening fire on the crowd.</p>
<p>The Venue Will Become Dream Hotel Group’s Flagship Property</p>
<p>Friday, July 7, will mark the official start of the construction process. Its official developers are the real estate firm Shopoff Realty Investments and commercial real estate development group Contour. McCarthy Building Companies will serve as a general contractor.</p>
<p>To commemorate the event, Dream Hotel Group will hold a ceremonial groundbreaking with several guest speakers such as Governor of Nevada Steve Sisolak, CEO of Dream Hotel Group Michael Lindenbaum, and Chair of the Clark County Board of Commissioners James Gibson. Dream’s other partners for this project will also send representatives to the event.</p>
<p>Contour CEO David Daneshforooz noted that the new hotel would be a perfect fit for the Las Vegas Strip and fill an unsatisfied niche.</p>
<p>There is no shortage of megaresorts in Las Vegas, but there is a lack of boutique hotels that offer a more intimate curated experience. David Daneshforooz, CEO of Contour</p>
<p>Dream Las Vegas will be the company’s flagship property and is situated accordingly. Several significant sports facilities are located nearby, such as the Allegiant Stadium and the T-Mobile Arena. With Mandalay Bay Resort and the Pinball Hall of Fame within walking distance, future guests will have easy access to the best of the Strip.</p>
