<p>Betsoft is the latest content creator to join Play Royal</p>
<p>Play Royal’s platform is powered by Ethereum and Tron</p>
<p>Betsoft continues to innovate</p>
<p>Tron and Ethereum cryptocurrency casino Play Royal has secured a content supplier deal with Betsoft, an award-winning casino games maker.</p>
<p>Betsoft Signs Supplier Deal with Play Royal</p>
<p>Casino games developer Betsoft has signed a pivotal partnership with Play Royal, an Ethereum-powered crypto casino, becoming one of the few mainstream game makers to expand into blockchain-based gambling.</p>
<p>Betsoft is not entirely unfamiliar with the area, as it has previously signed a partnership with other companies in the crypto iGaming sector.</p>
<p>Similarly, the company notched up keystone partnerships with Casino Gran Madrid, Wanabet and WeAreCasino.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Play Royal is powered by both Ethereum and Tron, a popular cryptocurrency used on other crypto gaming projects. Bitcasino.io added Tron earlier in October. Before that, another gaming portal, TRONUP, launched a 1,000,000 TRX promotion.</p>
<p>Good News for the Vendor and Operator</p>
<p>Commenting on the occasion, Betsoft Gaming’s Francesca Raniolo, Sales Executive for the company, had this to say:</p>
<p>We are very excited to announce our partnership with Play Royal, one of the world’s leading crypto casinos. We pride ourselves on developing innovative, exciting cinematic content that appeals to a wide range of player types, and this is what attracted Play Royal to our games. Betsoft Gaming looks forward to a great partnership.</p>
<p>Similarly, Play Royal CEO Tony Campbell also welcomed the addition of Betsoft, as a bona-fide provider of casino solutions: “We are extremely impressed with the quality of Betsoft’s innovative games. From the moment we saw titles such as Max Quest: Wrath of Ra, we knew that Betsoft backed up its reputation for developing fresh and exciting content, and we can’t wait to bring their games to our customers.”</p>
<p>Betsoft definitely has reasons to feel proud of recent developments. The company was nominated for the EGR B2B awards in Innovation and it secured first-place in RNG Casino Software Category.</p>
<p>Similarly, the company received praise for its work on one of the latest additions to its portfolio, Max Quest: Wrath of Ra. The game stands by virtue of its ‘multi-player shoot’em up experience’ bringing the casino gaming experience closer to an authentic video game.</p>
<p>The company was specifically recognized as RNG Supplier of the Year, one of the highest distinctions in iGaming, which consolidates the position of the developer as a flagship company in the sector.</p>
<p>More Distinct Slots</p>
<p>Betsoft has had a god October, with the company releasing Cashen’s Arrival, a Chinese-themed game. Based on the developer’s 3D cinematographic technology, Cashen’s Arrival offers an entirely new experience, akin to the ward winning Max Quest title.</p>
<p>Players could multiply their bet up to 35,000x times and there is an additional 3x multiplier that comes hand in hand with the free spins. In addition, players can benefit from the scatter symbol there to boost the overall payouts.</p>
<p>The year is not yet out and 2019 has more products lined up for release later in November and December.</p>
