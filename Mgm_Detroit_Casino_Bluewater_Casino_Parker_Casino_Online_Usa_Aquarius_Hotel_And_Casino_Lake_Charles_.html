<p>The leading gaming company powering lotteries, sports betting operators and gaming machines, International Game Technology (IGT), confirmed that it was recognized for its diversity, equality and inclusion efforts within the gambling vertical. Earlier this week, the company unveiled that it secured recognition from the 2023 Women in Gaming (WIG) Diversity &amp; Employee Wellbeing Awards. IGT won the "Diversity and Inclusion" category of the recent awards, recognizing it as a leader in diversity, equality and inclusion.</p>
<p>In 2018, the company created its Office of Diversity &amp; Inclusion. Since then, IGT has implemented different policies, programs and systems that support its efforts within equity, diversity and inclusion. Such efforts include special mandatory training that boosts the company's commitment to anti-discrimination. Moreover, IGT implements a hiring process that is equitable and inclusive. Additional efforts within the vertical include competitive benefits for same-sex partners.</p>
<p>Being at the forefront of diversity, the company expanded its executive-sponsored and employee-led Diversity &amp; Inclusion Groups (DIGs). As a result, those Groups include ACE (Employees of African descent), Women's Inclusion Network (WIN), NEXGEN (millennial and Gen Z employees) and many more.</p>
<p>Ultimately, with all those efforts, IGT seeks to develop a work culture that supports diversity and equality and at the same team repeal discrimination. The latest award is a testament to the company's ongoing focus on achieving strategic objectives and ensuring that all of its employees feel accepted and respected.</p>
<p>Brian Blake, IGT's Vice President, Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, shared his excitement about the recent accomplishment in a statement. "IGT winning the "Diversity and Inclusion" category at the WIG Diversity &amp; Employee Wellbeing Awards reflects our commitment to creating a workplace culture that is empowering to women and their colleagues globally," he said.</p>
<p>Last but not least, Blake pointed out: "We are dedicated to our ongoing efforts to embrace our core values and embed equality across our organization while setting a standard of excellence in the gaming industry that empowers our employees, stakeholders, and the communities we serve."</p>
<p>The news about the recent award comes after only recently, IGT confirmed it secured a new 10-year licensing agreement for the Wheel of Fortune brand with Sony Pictures Television. The new contract granted the company exclusive rights for the brand for iLottery, lottery, gaming and iGaming.</p>
<p>On the other hand, IGT also tapped into non-exclusive rights for the famous Wheel of Fortune brand for free-to-play social casinos. At the time of the announcement, the company confirmed that the contract is effective through December 31, 2034.</p>
