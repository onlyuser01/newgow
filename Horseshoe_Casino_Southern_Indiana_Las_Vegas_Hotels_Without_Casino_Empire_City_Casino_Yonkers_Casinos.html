<p>Louisiana's sports betting market continues to get more crowded. WynnBET launched its mobile and online sportsbook in the state this week. It is now the seventh operator to offer digital sports betting in the state, offering online sports betting services via its website and app, along with Caesars Entertainment, DraftKings and Rush Street Interactive.</p>
<p>Ronnie Johns, chairman of the Louisiana Gaming Control Board, signed the operator's license approval this week. Thursday morning, an official announcement was made, but the sportsbook had begun accepting bets on Wednesday.</p>
<p>In addition to the seven online sportsbooks from which Louisiana sports bettors can choose for Super Bowl LVI betting, there are also 40 online skins for commercial use in Louisiana and one for the Louisiana Lottery.</p>
<p>WynnBET customers will be able to access the Wynn Rewardsloyalty program, which allows them to redeem experiences and benefits at Wynn Resorts in addition to the new customer offer.</p>
<p>WynnBET has now launched in nine states, following the launch of its Louisiana operation and its previous launch in New York City on February 4. The remaining seven states are Arizona, Colorado, Indiana, Michigan, New Jersey, Tennessee and Virginia.</p>
<p>WynnBET isn't the only operator to add Louisiana to its portfolio. Fubo Gaming has been granted market access to offer mobile betting services in Mississippi and Louisiana. However, it won't be ready in time for the Super Bowl.</p>
<p>The sports betting operator, a subsidiary of FuboTV, has reached an agreement with Caesars Entertainment for Fubo Sportsbook to be available in Louisiana and two other states, Mississippi and Missouri. This is subject to regulatory approval and the launch of online betting in those states.</p>
<p>Sports betting is currently only allowed in Mississippi's casinos. Missouri legislation has not yet been passed to allow for any type of betting. Online sports betting could be legalized in both states in 2022.</p>
<p>Scott Butera, President of Fubo Gaming, asserted, "We are pleased to have the opportunity to extend our relationship with Caesars Entertainment as we expand access to Fubo Sportsbook across key markets in the US. Mississippi, Louisiana and Missouri all have passionate fanbases, particularly around college athletics, who will embrace our unique, immersive sports and wagering entertainment platform."</p>
<p>This is the second such agreement Fubo Gaming and Caesars Entertainment have made. They previously secured access deals in New Jersey, Indiana and Pennsylvania. Fubo Gaming has market access agreements in Arizona, Iowa, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Texas.</p>
<p>The new agreement brings the company's coverage to 10 states. However, Fubo Sportsbook is only currently available in Iowa and Arizona.</p>
