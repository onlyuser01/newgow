<p>FC Cincinnati vs. Columbus Crew is the 2023 Eastern Conference title game, which will take place at TQL Stadium, Cincinnati, Ohio, on Saturday, December 2</p>
<p>FC Cincinnati stands a chance to win the first MLS Eastern Conference title in the history of the club. Judging by the 2023 MLS Playoff odds, Pat Noonan’s boys might very well do it. They’re seen as favorites to win the Ohio Derby, but that’s only possible if they don’t underestimate Columbus Crew.</p>
<p>After all, the last time they met, Columbus Crew destroyed them 3-0. Still, the game in question took place in Ohio, while in Cincinnati, Noonan’s team needs to be considered the favorite.</p>

<p>Reasons Why FC Cincinnati Is Favored to Win the MLS Eastern Conference</p>
<p>FC Cincinnati is the winner of the 2023 MLS Supporters’ Shield, meaning that this is the team that won more points than anyone else during the regular season.</p>
<p>Cincy went 20-9-5 overall, but it’s their home record that was really impressive. These guys were 13-2-2 at TQL Stadium, with both of their losses, as well as one draw, happening in the last four rounds of the regular season, after they already secured a spot in the 2023 MLS Playoffs.</p>
<p>These guys also have a very good record in home games against their state rival, Columbus Crew. They’re undefeated against this opponent since making TQL Stadium their home venue in 2021.</p>
<p>Can Columbus Crew Upset the Odds on December 2?</p>
<p>If there’s something Columbus Crew players have taught us in the 2023 season, it’s that they never give up. These guys made it to the 2023 Eastern Conference Final after some real thrillers against some really tough opponents.</p>
<p>In their most recent game, they defeated Orlando City in Florida 2-0 after overtime. Before that, they won the series with Atlanta United 2-1, with a brilliant performance in the decisive game, which saw them score four goals.</p>
<p>When motivated, these guys seem capable of beating any opponent in the MLS. This includes their biggest rival FC Cincinnati as evident from the fact that they beat Cincy 3-0 in Columbus in August.</p>
<p>FC Cincinnati vs. Columbus Crew Prediction</p>
<p>This is going to be a real banger, probably with plenty of goals on both ends. FC Cincinnati is the favorite for a reason, but you can be 100% sure Columbus Crew will fight back. The result is that soccer fans will get to witness a memorable game on December 2.</p>
<p>Picks: FC Cincinnati &amp; over 2.5 goals</p>
