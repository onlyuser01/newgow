    <h1>Largest Casino In The Us Casino In Charleston West Virginia Sam S Town Hotel And Casino Shreveport I</h1>

<p>After some time, I decided to deposit here and claim the 150% deposit bonus, which were they currently offering.</p>
<p>First I asked live supp, if I am eligible, and if the bonus will not expire soon, so I have enough time to wager, etc. After ensuring that everything is OK, I deposited (I think around 40â‚¬ in crypto), got around 60â‚¬ bonus, and started to play.</p>
<p>After a short while, my balance suddenly fell from around 70â‚¬ to cca. 10â‚¬. I was shocked and immediately asked live support, what just happened.</p>
<p>And here comes the most ridiculous thing on the whole case. I have never seen this during my gambling life - the only thing I have been told so far (live chat, email, any way communication) is just some variation of "bonus was forfeited for security reasons and we cannot share the exact reason with you".</p>
<p>I managed to keep some of my communication with them, everything could be proved. Also that the bonus was forfeited "by hand" and not by expiration time.</p>
<p>What level of arrogance and fraudulence must a casino or its representatives possess, to be able to</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>ensure player, that he is safe to deposit and get the bonus,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>let him claim it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>after he is almost on zero balance, forfeit it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>decline telling anything about the actual reason</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I noticed later that I had already a little argument with this casino in the past, also about some problem in not credited bonus (don't remember exact details). After tough fight and public calls, casino changed their opinion and added me the bonus (that I rightfully should already have, no extra provided). I consider this behaviour simply a pitiful revenge attempt.</p>
<p>Despite that I am open to receive finally a meaningful response and explanation - as well as, in the other fall, to receive the bonus back into my account (not expecting any extra, that would be naive at least ðŸ™‚)</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for your help, Casino.Guru</p>
