<p>Canelo Alvarez Reportedly Becomes a Free Agent</p>
<p>The middleweight boxing champion Saul “Canelo” Alvarez reportedly cut ties with Golden Boy Promotions and DAZN. According to CBS Sports, the boxer severed his ties with both Golden Boy Promotions and DAZN, becoming a promotional free agent. A press release by Alvarez’s manager Eddy Reynoso confirmed that from November 6, the boxing star is a free agent and he will continue with his boxing career.</p>
<p>Reynoso stressed that he and Alvarez have been working very hard in the gym so that Alvarez can be in top physical shape to fight this year. In conclusion, Reynoso said: “We will announce date, rival and place very soon, and we will return stronger than ever to keep growing and showing that Mexican boxing is the best.”</p>
<p>Back in 2018, Alvarez inked a deal for the staggering $365 million with DAZN for 11 fights over 5 years. Earlier this year, the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the schedules for many sports, boxing included. With that in mind, DAZN was seeking to reduce the amount it had to pay to Alvarez. Consequently, Canelo filed a lawsuit against DAZN as well as Golden Boy.</p>
<p>The 30-year-old boxing champion’s complaint included claims for breach of contract, fraud, interference with prospective economic relations, and more. All in all, Canelo sought the sum of $280 million in damages as well as the right to schedule fights independently from Golden Boy or DAZN.</p>
<p>Alvarez, born in Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico has won four world titles in different boxing weight categories. The 30-year-old professional boxer has a total of 56 fights with only 2 draws and 1 loss from Floyd Mayweather Jr. in 2013. Canelo has a total of 53 wins and 36 of them were won by KO.</p>
