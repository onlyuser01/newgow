<p>Alexander Zverev vs. Carlos Alcaraz is arguably the most exciting match of the quarterfinal round of the 2024 Australian Open Men’s Singles. The duel between the ATP No. 6 and No. 2 is on the program on Wednesday evening (Eastern Time)</p>
<p>Along with Novak Djokovic, Carlos Alcaraz is the main favorite to win the Australian Open. He’s been doing great so far, but in the quarterfinal, he’s about to get his skills tested by a Top 10 player. In fact, his opponent is Alexander Zverev, who’s currently in the sixth place in the ATP Rankings.</p>
<p>The German player has a very good record against Alcaraz, winning four of their seven duels, including the one played last November. Can he do it again? Let’s find out!</p>

<p>Alexander Zverev Might be Carlos Alcaraz’s Kryptonite</p>
<p>Alexander Zverev has played seven times against Carlos Alcaraz so far, winning four of those matches. Three of his four wins happened on the hardcourt, which is the type of surface used in Melbourne.</p>
<p>His most recent win over Alcaraz happened in their most recent duel – at the ATP Finals in Turin last November. Zverev won the match 2-1, despite losing the first set after a tiebreaker. The last time these two met at a Grand Slam tournament, it was Alcaraz who won. It happened at the 2023 US Open when we saw Zverev suffer a 3-0 defeat.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to the 2024 Australian Open, and the two will meet again. Zverev is seen as a huge +395 underdog; one of the main reasons for this is that he wasn’t too impressive in his last match.</p>
<p>He played against Cameron Norrie in the previous round, and it took him more than four hours to beat the ATP No. 22 in five sets.</p>
<p>Carlos Alcaraz To Take Things Seriously</p>
<p>Carlos Alcaraz is a big favorite to advance to the semifinals, but he needs to take this match seriously. He hasn’t had many problems getting to this stage, mainly because he didn’t play against too tough opponents.</p>
<p>The highest-ranked player he’s faced so far at the 2024 Australian Open is Lorenzo Sonego, who’s 46th in the ATP Rankings. The match with Sonego is the only match so far that saw Alcaraz drop a set. In all the other matches, he won in straight sets.</p>
<p>Now, he’s facing a much harder challenge, but he needs to give his best on Wednesday evening as there’s so much at stake. If he wins, he’ll book the ticket to the semifinal where he’ll play against the winner of the Hurbert Hurkacz vs. Daniil Medvedev match.</p>
<p>Alexander Zverev vs. Carlos Alcaraz Prediction</p>
<p>Alexander Zverev’s fuel is running low after a 4-four marathon duel with Cameron Norrie. We doubt he will have the stamina for another big battle, especially because his next opponent is the world’s second-best male player.</p>
<p>Of course, he will give his best shot, but if he loses the first set, we think Alcaraz will steamroll him in the following two. That’s why our top pick is Alcaraz to win in straight sets.</p>
<p>Pick: Carlos Alcaraz to win 3-0 (+125)</p>
