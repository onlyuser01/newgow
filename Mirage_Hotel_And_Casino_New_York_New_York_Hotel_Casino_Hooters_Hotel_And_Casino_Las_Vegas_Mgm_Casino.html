<p>The Buffalo Bills vs. New England Patriots Week 7 game is on the program on Sunday, October 22, 2023, at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts, where the Pats haven’t defeated their AFC East rivals since the end of the Tom Brady era</p>
<p>Buffalo Bills vs. New England Patriots is one of the most interesting games of Week 7 of the 2023 NFL for several reasons. First of all, this is a duel between two AFC East rivals. Secondly, the game will take place in Foxborough where the Bills have been undefeated since the start of the 2020s decade. Judging by the Bills vs. Patriots Week 7 odds, the boys from Buffalo will prolong that streak.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bills Coming to Foxborough for Another Win</p>
<p>The Buffalo Bills are 4-2 in the 2023 NFL season, with both of their losses being kind of strange. The first one happened against the New York Jets in the first gameweek. The game saw the Jets’ new quarterback Aaron Rodgers pick up a potentially season-ending injury, but that did not stop the New Yorkers from getting a win. They beat the Bills 22-16 after overtime.</p>
<p>Buffalo also suffered a 25-20 defeat against the Jacksonville Jaguars two weeks ago. However, there’s an explanation for that as well – the game in question was played in London.</p>
<p>The Bills came back to America last week and beat the New York Giants 14-9 at home. Their defense was brilliant as always, keeping the opposition to a single-digit number for the second time this season.</p>
<p>The Bills defense kept the Giants out of the end zone on all five trips into the red zone on Sunday.</p>
<p>That marks only the second time this season a defense has held an opponent to no touchdowns on 5+ RZ trips, with the Broncos also forcing the Jets to go 0-5 in Week 5. pic.twitter.com/Cp9lPTv4pS — Buffalo Bills PR (@BuffaloBillsPR) October 17, 2023</p>
<p>What’s surprising, however, is that their offensive team scored only 14 points in that game – their worst offensive performance since September 2021.</p>
<p>Given that the Giants aren’t an elite defense, the Bills can only blame themselves for the bleak offensive display. Their QB Josh Allen went 19-for-30 in that game for 169 yards and two touchdowns, with one of his passes getting intercepted.</p>
<p>His TD throws were caught by Deonte Harty and Quintin Morris, but it’s Stefon Diggs who really excelled in the wide receiver’s role, recording 10 receptions for 100 yards.</p>
<p>When it comes to rushing, James Cook and Latavious Murray did okay, but they were expected to do even better.</p>
<p>New England Patriots Need to Up Their Offensive Game</p>
<p>The Patriots are without a win over the Bills at Foxborough since the Tom Brady era. With Mac Jones as their quarterback, they’re just not doing too great offensively. This season, their average is just 12.0 points, which is the worst number in the AFL.</p>
<p>The Pats’ defense isn’t doing much better either with 25.33 points conceded per game. All this explains why they have a 1-5 record in the 2023 NFL. Their only win this season happened in Week 3 when they defeated the Jets 15-10. Since then, however, they’re 0-3, scoring just 20 points along the way.</p>
<p>Will they be able to up their offensive game in Week 7? Probably not, knowing that they’re welcoming the NFL’s No. 2 defense on Sunday, which is conceding just 14.66 points per game.</p>
<p>Buffalo Bills vs. New England Patriots Prediction</p>
<p>The Bills’ offense is looking to rebound from a relatively poor performance last weekend, which could’ve been costly if it weren’t for their brilliant defense. They scored just 14 points last time, but Allen &amp; Co. just have to do better this Sunday. Will the Pats offense improve as well? Highly unlikely. Instead, we think the Bills might even keep them to only one or two TDs.</p>
<p>Picks: Buffalo Bills to win and cover the spread; under 41.5 points</p>
