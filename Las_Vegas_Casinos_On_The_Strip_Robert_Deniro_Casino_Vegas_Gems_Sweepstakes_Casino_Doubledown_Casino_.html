    <h1>Las Vegas Casinos On The Strip Robert Deniro Casino Vegas Gems Sweepstakes Casino Doubledown Casino</h1>

<p>Hello Thomas, thank you for doing this for me. I just checked again, my payout of 850 euros, which I then applied for again on November 3rd, is still pending. Yesterday morning I asked again why they still haven't processed the payment because they wrote it takes up to 72 hours. Only they wrote that so many times and canceled it again exactly after the 72 hours. In the evening the answer came back with the 72 hours and that it could be delayed at the weekend. But that's how it's been since October 18th, they're waiting until they cancel. Then check documents again in 72 hours, when they are accepted again you go back to payment and wait again these 72 hours until you cancel again. It always starts from the beginning. They stall customers instead of telling them which documents are really missing. But they always come up with a new excuse. The best they wrote me, which was canceled due to technical reasons and I should request a new withdrawal. And then you still canceled again because a document was still missing? I'm very curious if the casino will take a stand here, I definitely don't believe it. The way this casino behaves they just don't want to cash out. Hard to believe that it is a Malta Casino, because I have never experienced anything like this in any other casino.</p>
