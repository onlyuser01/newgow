<p>Everi Holdings said this accreditation was made possible by the hard work of its team members and its commitment to maintaining a positive workplace culture.</p>
<p>Everi Holdings, a leading provider of casino and iGaming products, financial technology and loyalty tools, has announced that it has received a new badge of honor. The supplier proudly announced that it has been named one of Nevada’s top workplaces.</p>
<p>The 2023 Nevada Top Workplaces award, provided by the Las Vegas Review-Journal and Las Vegas Business Press, designates Everi Holdings as a company with a healthy workplace culture that cares for its employees.</p>
<p>2023 notably marks the third year in a row Everi Holdings has received this recognition. In total, the company has received 21 Top Workplaces honors over the last three years, further attesting to its functional culture.</p>
<p>In 2023, Everi also earned four Culture Excellence awards from Top Workplaces – for Innovation, Work-Life Flexibility, Compensation and Benefits, and Leadership. Furthermore, the provider’s name made it to the Top Workplaces USA list for the second year in a row.</p>
<p>Randi Taylor, chief executive officer of the company, said:</p>
<p>We have worked diligently to create a positive company culture with shared values across multiple office locations and with our talented team of remote employees in Nevada, so we are thrilled to be recognized once again by Top Workplaces. Randi Taylor, CEO, Everi Holdings</p>
<p>Taylor added that Everi Holdings would not have secured the award if not for the extreme dedication and hard work of its team members.</p>
<p>Energage Praised Everi Holdings’ Efforts</p>
<p>It is worth noting that the Top Workplaces award Everi has received is entirely based on employee feedback gathered by the employee engagement technology platform Energage. Energage has over 16 years of experience in probing how employees from over 70,000 organizations feel about their workplace.</p>
<p>The best thing about this vote is that it maintains the anonymity of the respondents, allowing them to share their honest thoughts on 15 culture drivers. Some of these include alignment, execution and connection, among others.</p>
<p>Energage’s chief executive officer, Eric Rubino, commented on the development, saying that a Top Workplaces award is a badge of honor for companies. He added that Everi Holdings should be proud of receiving the award for the third year in a row.</p>
<p>In today’s market, leaders must ensure they’re allowing employees to have a voice and be heard. That’s paramount. Top Workplaces do this, and it pays dividends. Eric Rubino, CEO, Energage</p>
<p>Everi Holdings shared its thoughts, attributing the accreditation to the hard work it has put into creating a positive company culture. Despite having many offices in Nevada, the company strives to maintain homogeneous values across its hubs, ensuring the well-being of all of its workers.</p>
