<p>White Hat Gaming has announced a couple of new appointments as the iGaming platform seeks to consolidate its footprint in the United States. Moving forward, the company will have Ed Bullock fill in the position of a chief operating officer and Chris Hipkiss serve as chief delivery officer.</p>
<p>White Hat Gaming turns to Two Proven Industry Specialists</p>
<p>Bullock’s appointment is with immediate effect, and it will see the newly assigned COO start working on helping the company boost the efficiency and efficacy of all business operations. The appointments will help improve White Hat’s market reach and growth and help forge new and thriving relationships with existing and future clients.</p>
<p>Bullock has previously worked at bet365 and has the relevant industry experience to help steer White Hat’s ambitions. As to Hipkiss, his position as CDO will allow him to focus on the company’s present success and strengthen its proposition and pillars. Hipkiss is an in-house promotion as he previously served as head of product and delivery at White Hat Gaming, and he is well-versed in the company’s culture, long-term ambitions, and strategic goals.</p>
<p>White Hat Gaming CEO Phil Gelvan welcome the opportunity and said that the appointments were an important part of the company’s future aggressive expansion in the US market. The changes in the lineup are very much in accordance with the plan.</p>
<p>“I believe that Ed and Chris are exactly the people to afford us the agility and precision in our operational and delivery capabilities to achieve this growth,” Gelvan said. Bullock pitched in and said that White Hat Gaming is fully focused on the US market and added that there is great potential to build upon what is clearly one of the most important markets for the company.</p>
<p>White Hat Gaming Is Determined to Continue Growth in the United States</p>
<p>Hipkiss was similarly pleased with the changes and said that White Hat Gaming has been undergoing swift business development in the past months. The two appointments follow the news that the company launched its services in Kansas, making the Sunflower State the 13th jurisdiction in which the company has rolled in.</p>
<p>White Hat Gaming has struck up several important partnerships recently, including a distribution collaboration with Pariplay. The company also teamed up with Slot Factory back in April.</p>
<p>In the wake of the rapid legalization of the sports gambling segment in the United States, White Hat Gaming and other companies are now expecting with trepidation a possible sprawl of iGaming as the next logical step for regulating online gambling in the country.</p>
