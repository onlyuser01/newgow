<p>Bragg Gaming has announced the launch of Lady Luck Casino Egyptian Magic, a bespoke game intended for Caesars Digital players from Michigan and New Jersey</p>
<p>The global business-to-business gaming technology platform provider, Bragg Gaming, has launched Lady Luck Casino Egyptian Magic Slot, a custom-made, exclusive game intended for players at Caesars Palace Online Casino in New Jersey and Michigan.</p>
<p>The name of the game is an interesting combination of Bragg and Caesars aesthetics that reunites the provider’s imagery and gameplay from Egyptian Magic with Caesars Entertainment’s Lady Luck Casino brand.</p>
<p>The game is actually an adaptation of Bragg Gaming’s iconic Egyptian Magic slot but which now encompasses fresh visuals promoting the Lady Luck brand.</p>
<p>While the official press releases from Caesars and Bragg Gaming do not offer any details and images related to the new game, it is implied that no significant gameplay changes have been brought to the original game, other than the integration of the Lady Luck brand elements.</p>

<p>Bragg Gaming, Rooting for “Many More Successful Releases” on Caesars Palace Online Casino</p>
<p>The group’s chief operating officer for Americas, Kunal Mishra, spoke about the exciting release in partnership with their “valued partners at Caesars Digital” that is supporting their commitment to introducing the highest quality content to US players.</p>
<p>Mishra also commented on the way they successfully managed to deliver “an even richer portfolio of online casino games” to Caesars Digital players from Michigan and New Jersey since the official launch with their freshest RGS technology in the past months.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the COO said that he was looking forward to “many more successful releases on Caesars Palace Online Casino” as the group will keep launching fresh gaming portfolios from Bragg Studios and their Powered by Bragg partners.</p>
<p>In July, the group announced forging a historical global distribution partnership with 888 Holdings, further reinforcing the pre-existing agreement between the two parties.</p>
<p>Bragg Content Resonates Well with Caesars Digital’s Database of Players</p>
<p>As explained by Caesars Digital’s senior vice president of iGaming, Matt Sunderland, Lady Luck Casino Egyptian Magic is an excellent addition to their roster of custom games that their players can exclusively access at Caesars Palace Online Casino.</p>
<p>Since Caesars is already familiar with the positive manner in which Bragg Gaming’s content is received by its players, the new custom-made is expected to rapidly turn into a “player favorite.”</p>
<p>For players who are not already accustomed to the original game, the action is set against Ancient Egypt’s popular pyramids and counts 50 win lines. The game encompasses two special features.</p>
<p>When at least six Respin Orb symbols are seen landing during random spins in the base game, they engage the Respin Feature. The latter gives players the opportunity to scoop up Credits and Jackpopts with a one-of-a-kind upgrade feature.</p>
<p>The same Respin Orbs symbols can also pop up during the Free Games round. Only Michigan and New Jersey players who are over 21 are allowed to download the Caesars Palace Online Casino app on their Android and iOS devices or visit the caesarspalaceonline.com platform to play the game.</p>
<p>In August, Bragg Gaming recorded two major events with the launch of its games in the UK via Unibet and the expansion of its content in Ontario thanks to a collaboration with bet365.</p>
