    <h1>Chewelah Casino Play For Real Money Casinos Casino Missouri Casino White Cloud How Many Casinos In A</h1>

<p>Good day. Something very annoying happened to me at Vegas plus casino.</p>
<p>I got a €35 bonus and implemented the full bonus terms and after that I had 800 in the account and they took everything down to 140 from the account.</p>
<p>then I worked my way back up to 970 with this €140 and then to pay something out I deposited €15 and then won again. Then I cashed out 300 and then again €20 and then again €30 to be able to withdraw more money. I finally made it to €3800 in the account but I'm only allowed to withdraw €300. That can't be correct. According to the terms and conditions. 6.12 a player may withdraw up to 20 times their total deposits. That's 1300 for me and not just 300€</p>
<p>I also asked explicitly if I could pay out 1000 with the last €50 I paid in and I was told yes, you can pay out the money and I was told that twice.</p>
<p>and then they said they could take the winnings that were achieved with the 15 € from the account and then I can play and continue to pay out again. But then they removed the entire 3800 from my account and only left 50 €. That can't be right and fair.</p>
<p>first, after my converted bonus conditions, almost 700 were removed and then I keep winning and at the very end I can pay out 300 and 3800 each are taken from the account.</p>
<p>I continued to make a profit after I deposited 20 and also made a profit after I deposited 30 €. Can you please help me?</p>
<p>I find all of this highly dubious</p>
