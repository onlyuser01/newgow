<p>The Kansas City Chiefs are the top favorites to win the Super Bowl LVI next February. They did it two years ago and were very close to winning back-to-back Super Bowls last season, but the Tampa Bay Buccaneers crushed their dreams.</p>
<p>The Chiefs are also favored to be the team with the best record in the regular season, with some pundits even suggesting they could go 17-0 in 2021. The odds on such a scenario are currently +3300. If they’re going to do it, they’d need to beat the Cleveland Browns in Week 1.</p>
<p>So, will they? The short answer is: yes! For a more elaborate answer, keep on reading!</p>

<p>It’s All About Patrick Mahomes</p>
<p>He’s arguably the best quarterback in the NFL at the moment. In fact, Mahomes has probably been the best for several years now, starting with the 2018 season when he won the NFL MVP award.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, he’s the main favorite to win it in 2021, with the odds being in the ballpark of +500. In comparison, the last season’s MVP, Aaron Rodgers, who’s currently the second favorite, is priced at +1000.</p>
<p>Mahomes is expected to shine in 2021, probably from the very beginning of the season. The guy’s turning 26 in a few days’ time (September 17), which seems to be the best age for him to get involved in the race for the GOAT status.</p>
<p>No Win for the Browns Against the Chiefs in Nine Years</p>
<p>The Chiefs won the previous four games against the Browns. The last time the Cleveland team beat them was in 2012 when most of the Browns’ crucial players were still in high school.</p>
<p>Speaking of their key men, it seems that everything’s revolving around quarterback Baker Mayfield and his favorite target, wide receiver, Odell Beckham Jr.</p>
<p>Last season, Mayfield made 26 touchdown passes, almost singlehandedly taking the Browns to the postseason. Odell Beckham Jr. would’ve played an important role as well, but he spent 11 games off the field due to an injury (nine regular-season games and two playoff games).</p>
<p>The good news for the Browns is that he’s back, which means that this team is going to be much, much dangerous in the offense than before. Does this mean they should hope for a win against the Chiefs?</p>
<p>Well, no… Even though it’s very likely they will score a couple of touchdowns, it’s almost certain that the Mahomes-led Chiefs offense will score even more. That said, we expect the Browns vs Chiefs game to be a high-scoring affair, probably with more than 53 points in total.</p>
