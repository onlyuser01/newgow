<p>Tennessee had a good month in September. The state managed to clock in a total of $336.9 million in sports wagers, a good total betting handle all things considered, and the sixth-best the Volunteer State has had to date. The state’s tax revenue amounted to $8.7 million, the Sports Wagering Advisory Council reported.</p>
<p>Tennessee Betting Tax Beats All Expectations</p>
<p>This is the biggest tax amount on record that the state has been able to collect since sports betting launched off to a shaky start in November 2020. The previous tax amount to set a record was registered in November 2021 when Tennessee generated $5.9 million in tax from sports wagering.</p>
<p>The present results have surpassed all expectations and given hopes that the months ahead will remain just as action-packed. There is definitely plenty of events to explore down the road with a number of fantastic events, including the NBA, NFL, and the NHL running at full throttle. Interestingly, the total amount wagered, $336.9 million, wasn’t actually the largest on record.</p>
<p>The state generated its biggest total betting handle in a single month back in January 2022 when gamblers wagered $386 million in total. Tennessee presently taxes gambling revenue at 20%, but it bases the tax rate on the net operator revenue as opposed to the gross receipts. Out of this amount, 80% is forward towards education and 15% is divvied between local governments. Another 5% is then earmarked for mental health programs in the state.</p>
<p>The uptick in sports gambling tax may have to do with the change in how sportsbooks calculate their net revenue after a change was enacted in mid-2022. Meanwhile, state regulators are due to meet on October 24 and discuss the license renewals of several companies, including BetMGM, DraftKings, Action 24/7 and FanDuel. The state has a total of 11 operators, with BallyBet and Fubo Sportsbook both approved but not yet launching.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Fubo Sportsbook announced in a quick financial update that it is discontinuing its sportsbook initiative as it lacked a way of making this project generate shareholder value.</p>
