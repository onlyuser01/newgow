<p>Ticket to the Stars review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Ticket to the Stars takes you on a journey, not just to the stars but to the future, where commercial interstellar travel is a possibility and robot butlers have finally been perfected.</p>
<p>The setting is realised nicely with charming space captains, sylph-like stewardesses and plenty of champagne on ice.</p>
<p>Humankind should always be looking to the stars, and in this slot from Quickspin, we finally get to go.</p>
<p>Example of a win in the Ticket to the Stars slot machine</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>With is kooky retro-futuristic take on space travel, Ticket to the Stars comes with a loot box of fun designs on the reels, each of which is well drawn to fit with the Dan Dare aesthetic, while the background looks like a perfect 1960s tourism poster but for space.</p>
<p>The soundtrack is a pleasant ambient track with plenty of twinkling scales and gentle synth sounds to set the mood without irking the player. The animation and reel sounds are well chosen to fit with the theme but also to give the game some punch and tension.</p>
<p>Overall the design team have done a lovely job on this upbeat and hopeful slot.</p>
<p>Extra spins gained in the free spin bonus</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Ticket to the Stars comes with the boilerplate parts for a modern slot. The base game is played on five reels of three rows each, with twenty-five winlines between them.</p>
<p>To keep the player interested there is a cascade feature (called "Swooping Reels" in Ticket to the Stars bumf) and a Free Spin bonus, which is covered in detail below.</p>
<p>The Swooping Reels feature removes any winning symbols after the winnings have been calculated and the symbols above the empty space drop down to replace them. The feature ends when no new winning combinations occur.</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter symbol.</p>
<p>The Scatter symbol does not pay out. However, landing three or more anywhere on the reels will trigger the Free Spin bonus. Fifteen free spins are awarded for three Scatters and an additional five for each extra Scatter after that.</p>
<p>During the Free Spin bonus a multiplier of one is added to the reel. After every third winning combination the multiplier increases by one, and the number of free spins by two. The final multiplier is applied to the entire win for the Free Spin bonus.</p>
<p>Free spins super win in Ticket to the Stars slot</p>
<p>The bonus is where the real cash is to be won in this high variance slot.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of Ticket to the Stars is 96.53%, a good half per cent over our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.25 up to a maximum of $/£/€100.00 per spin. This is a nice wide range and should work for most player’s bet sizes.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is extremely high, which makes it a perfect match for our preferred slot machine strategies.</p>
<p>Paytable for Ticket to the Stars slot</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>This is a really excellent and hugely under-appreciated slot. The theme and design work together to create an engaging and immersive world that is great fun to enter into.</p>
<p>On top of that, the volatility is high, and return to player a little above average both of which are big plusses in our book. The gameplay is perhaps a little simple, but the cascade feature makes for regular spikes in excitement and so maintains the interest of the player.</p>
<p>We highly recommend.</p>
