    <h1>Casino Lisboa Wild Horse Casino Az Palace Casino Biloxi Ms Caesars Casino Online Real Money Riverswe</h1>

<p>SoftSwiss’ affiliate tracking platform, Affilka, has entered into a new deal with VipSlot.club in its first major partnership of 2022. The terms of the deal stipulate that the Affilka platform will be used by the online casino operator to help launch its own affiliate program, Aff.House. That program is expected to be introduced later this year.</p>
<p>Affilka Gains Ground in 2022</p>
<p>The arrangement includes a flexible commission builder, including standard CPA (cost per action) and RevShare (revenue sharing) capabilities, and hybrid and custom commissions. It also comes with a built-in payment processing solution so operators can accept Neteller, Skrill, cryptocurrencies, and bank transfers. Detailed reports are available through the platform in both CSV and JSON formats.</p>
<p>Anastasia Borovaya, Product Owner at Affilka, said in a statement, “I am pleased to welcome VipSlot.Club to the large Affilka family. This partnership is a special reason for us to be proud, as Affilka once again demonstrated its flexibility and versatility.”</p>
<p>She added that, even though VipSlot.club is an independent platform, it will be able to benefit from the same affiliate marketing benefits that its online casino counterparts at SoftSwiss enjoy. She added that the company’s offerings will bring a lot of benefits to VipSlot.club’s development.</p>
<p>The online casino can also run projects with operators of SoftSwiss Online Casino Platform and third-party solutions.</p>
<p>Affilka’s Humble Beginnings</p>
<p>The SoftSwiss Online Casino Platform became its own platform in 2018, transitioning to the Affilka brand name two years later. Last June, it became an independent website that had less interaction with SoftSwiss.</p>
<p>It was then that Affilka began to take off, reporting a significant increase in online and sportsbook collaborations in the first six months of the year. By July, it had over 100 new partners.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for VipSlot.club said that Affilka’s partnership with the company promises to bring a lot of positive benefits. The ease with which it can use the platform facilitates an easier rollout.</p>
<p>The spokesperson added, “For us, as a young and ambitious company, an individual approach and the ability to adapt the functionality to our needs was especially important. Therefore, in the process of communicating with the platform team, I was once again convinced that we made the right choice in favour of Affilka.”</p>
