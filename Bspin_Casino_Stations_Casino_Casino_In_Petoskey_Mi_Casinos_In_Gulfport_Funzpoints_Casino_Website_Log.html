<p>Pragmatic Play, one of the leading iGaming content and game developers, has teamed up with 500 Casino, an iGaming operator. As a result, Pragmatic Play will make its array of games and products available to 500 Casino. This includes both slots and Live Casino titles, covering all present releases and those to come in the future.</p>
<p>Boosting Pragmatic’s Game Reach with New Operators</p>
<p>Players will be able to enjoy award-winning options such as Gates of Olympus, Greedy Wolf, Magic Money Maze, Gorilla Mayhem, and other trademark games developed by Pragmatic Play and enriching the iGaming portfolio and ecosystem. There is a number of excellent Live Casino games to explore as well.</p>
<p>As a supplier, Pragmatic Play has not slowed down with its push in the Live Casino vertical and has created some of the best live blackjack and roulette experiences. Other innovative experiences in the same segment include Boom City and Sweet Bonanza CandyLand, two originally developed in-house titles by Pragmatic Play.</p>
<p>Through this partnership, Pragmatic Play continues to grow its footprint with high-profile partners. Most recently, the company established partnerships with Hollywoodbets, Betway, and RushBet to cover the same regional markets as 500 Casino.</p>
<p>New Opportunities with Pragmatic Play’s Content</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play COO Irina Cornides welcomed the opportunity and argued that 500 Casino is one of the ever-growing clients the company has.</p>
<p>It’s another exciting commercial deal in which we look to further our footprint in targeted regulated markets like Latin America, Europe, and Africa. Pragmatic Play COO Irina Cornides</p>
<p>500 Casino COO Christoffer Andersson also joined the conversation and said that it has been a priority for the operator to provide customers with leading casino games and products. “Its titles provide a seal of quality to any casino, and we are very pleased to be able to offer two of its core verticals to our customers,” Andersson concluded.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Pragmatic Play continues to push with its product development process, building games beyond Live Casino and Slots and also adding Bingo production to its assembly line. The company is producing as many as seven games a month, making it one of the biggest developers.</p>
