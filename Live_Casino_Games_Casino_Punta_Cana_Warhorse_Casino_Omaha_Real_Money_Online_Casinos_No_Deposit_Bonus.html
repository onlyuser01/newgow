    <h1>Live Casino Games Casino Punta Cana Warhorse Casino Omaha Real Money Online Casinos No Deposit Bonus</h1>

<p>I applied for a 25% cashback bonus for the first time yesterday.</p>
<p>I have not claimed or rejected any other bonuses so far.</p>
<p>The terms state that any cashback amounts due will be calculated using the following formula. Net losses on participating games from deposits made during the promotional period x 25% (Net losses from bonus money are not included in the calculation) The promotional period was from Monday 00:00 to Sunday 23:59. During this promotional period my net loss was €1045. I haven't won anything. Played exclusively in the live casino.</p>
<p>I was then credited with €98. Which in my opinion should have been €200. The maximum amount is given as €200.</p>
<p>I then asked for verification in live chat.</p>
<p>As always, I just got brushed off. It's all right! Was the statement without further explanation.</p>
<p>Supposedly I've reached level 4 and I have a "personal</p>
<p>Account Manager" I then sent emails to the VIP area</p>
<p>No answer since yesterday morning. I tried live chat again last night. Catastrophic. The contact person Bob had to get in touch with my "personal VIP account manager" several times! The whole thing took 1 hour. Then Bob informed me: The calculation was correct. Without further explanation. I want to write to the VIP manager. After I informed him that it had happened 8 hours ago, the following answer: O-ton:</p>
<p>Please note that the number of VIP managers is rather small, so there may be a delay in replying. But they always answer. You would receive thousands of emails a day. I just have to wait. That's it.</p>
<p>So far no answer, no picture, no sound.</p>
<p>I have never experienced such a catastrophic support in any casino. Never!</p>
