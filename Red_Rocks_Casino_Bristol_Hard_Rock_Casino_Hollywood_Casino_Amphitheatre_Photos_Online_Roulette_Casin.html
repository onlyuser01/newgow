<p>Strive Gaming, the provider of the prestigious iGaming player account platform (PAM) that caters to the needs of gaming operators that target several North American jurisdictions at a time, has added Golden Nugget Online Gaming (GNOG) to its already impressive assortment of partners. The two companies have signed a deal that would help GNOG reinforce its footing in the US while also expanding its presence on Canadian soil in Ontario in an attempt to turn into a regulated iGaming operator once the country’s legislation allows it.</p>
<p>Strive Gaming Will Deliver a Premium Sports Betting Experience in Arizona</p>
<p>According to the partnership, Strive will power and support GNOG’s online sportsbook launch in Arizona. This will help the online gaming and digital sports entertainment company further expand its online presence in North America with the help of its new and reliable PAM partner. Strive PAM will be used to rapidly integrate and launch GNOG’s engine used for sports betting online while relying on Infinity Engine, a special engine that uses flexibility and reunites customer relationship management and operator insights with player data in real-time.</p>
<p>Strive’s PAM has already proven its superiority in front of its competitors with the help of its post-PASPA (Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act) compliance solutions created for digital betting and gaming operators in North America looking for unified customer experiences across several states.</p>
<p>Strive’s Chief Executive Officer Max Meltzer regards the GNOG team as one of the most experienced iGaming operators in the country, thus justifying their partnership decision. Meltzer also added that GNOG’s choice also came after a thorough assessment of all existing PAM suppliers on the North American market, which should be regarded as a testament to the company’s capacity and potential.</p>
<p>GNOG Will Be Strive’s Third Customer With US Operations</p>
<p>GNOG’s president Thomas Winter considers Strive Gaming an excellent choice of a partner, mentioning the undeniable performance and top results that both the PAM and the team behind it have managed to obtain so far.</p>
<p>The partnership will represent another important milestone for Strive’s, as GNOG will this way become its third customer with operations within the North American borders. The deal will also mark Strive’s second launch in the US, after its debut in Colorado last August.</p>
<p>Strive also experienced the much-anticipated Desert Diamond Mobile app launch for the Tohono O’odham Tribe. The mobile sportsbook provides a rich selection of betting solutions and it features custom wagers on local and global sporting events and a special match tracking function that allows bettors to keep a close eye on their favorite teams 24/7.</p>
