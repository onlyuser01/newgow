    <h1>Harrahs Cherokee Casino Resort Marriott Stellaris Casino Aruba Casino At Atmore Best Casino In Detro</h1>

<p>It seems like you have a good relationship with Fair Go. That's why I chose you.</p>
<p>I'm not going to lie I really felt stupid until I read the Aussie boy and it was like reading myself in a lot of ways explain in a minute.</p>
<p>September 26th I deposit $32 AUD in to Fargo and go coupon hunting. I land on Exhibit 1. which I had a and I had a hard time deciding between exhibit one and exhibit two this is exhibit two very similar. And I think I specifically chose one because it was a minimum of $20 and exhibit 2 was a minimum of 25 and I was thinking American so that's that's what I did I had $23 American and I forgot to switch to Aussie bucks but anyway that being said I had already made up my mind to choose that one so I did.</p>
<p>so I start things are going good I go up I go down and then I decide to go over to Achilles deluxe and I hit it pretty good for about 700 I was feeling all right and then BOOM. I hit five Achilles on the pay line $1.80 bet paid $3,700 unbelievable I was excited and you know just happy and I quit for the night and then I started laying in bed thinking oh my God what if it didn't make it through the playthrough so it might have been a boy transaction. I call in the morning I speak to about two or three people and everybody thinks either I'm stupid because I think they're way stupid and nobody gets what I'm saying because this whole time I'm telling them I'm like I'm talking about voided cash and getting through the playthrough nobody is bothering to tell me that this coupon is a no Max cashout. It just seems like everybody's like talking in circles around me so I'm like hell with it I'm thinking I'm getting eight or nine hundred so I just kind of play with them with the bells a little bit I'm just doing some what I think is fake betting cuz I only cash so high right and then I talk to a guy his name is Gavin and he starts talking to me about voided cash and I asked him specifically can I can I get him to clear the cash out of the account he goes no I know I can't clear the cash but you know you can't you can do it so you know what I'm just going to take care of it or something to that effect.</p>
<p>He knew what I was talking about because he talked about playthrough and the excess cash and I said normally they sweep it out and he said yeah they normally do and I said well hell can I just go ahead and clear it so I can reload for tonight yeah yeah you can do that he said and I guess if he thought I was on a 30 times Max cash that would be the appropriate response but he said let me take time to review your account and your bonuses and your play. He should have known that I was a no Max cash and I didn't have to worry about playthrough or anything like that but nobody would give me that answer it was like nobody wanted to tell me what I could cash. And Gavin should have looked at my coupon and said sir you don't need to worry about voided cash you don't have way to cash that's all your cash it's worth it in this casino but it's valuable to you nobody ever told me that that day what they basically told me was we're going to play a game today we're going to save your high score over here and we're going to play again tomorrow but you got to reload.</p>
<p>Here's why I think they're targeting a specific person it's just a guess but it's it's different take a look at it before exhibit for an exempt one or exactly the same except something's missing on exhibit one. And it states that basically if it doesn't it states in the terms and conditions if it is not if it is not specifically designated a Max cash out it is a 30 Max cash out well obviously didn't think it was a Max cash out and I'll bet about 2,700 other people didn't either because you're meant to think that it's that it's a 30 Max cash out not a no Max cash out. and when you hit the terms and conditions of that specific 20 bandits 3 the one with no Mass Cash out it takes you to the general terms and it says nothing about it nothing about it they tell me this after I've completely made really ridiculous and stupid bets to get rid of the cash in my account so I can play tonight but don't worry it's recorded it's time stamp which they had everything time stamp there's an account there's a game history which will show your most recent transactions and then you're supposed to be able to look at your total game history but they've gotten smarter about that and took it off probably because the Aussie boys deal he had screenshots and all this you don't have anything and as I was making these stupid bets I went occasionally and even sit there it doesn't it never told me that I was ham I wasn't winning a thing which I knew the money was the money was voided in the casino meaning they could still take it from me but I couldn't win impossible to win that's enough for now I look forward to hearing from you because the proof is in the presentation and I'm out of I'm out of characters so looking forward to talking to you</p>
