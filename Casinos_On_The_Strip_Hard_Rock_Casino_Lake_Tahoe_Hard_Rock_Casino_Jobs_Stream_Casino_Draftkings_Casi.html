<p>Buffalo Rising Megaways review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>The great plains of North America were once inhabited by millions of buffalo roaming in vast herds that numbered in the tens of thousands. None of them had the glowing red eyes of the bison depicted here in Buffalo Rising Megaways, however, or they might have frightened off the hunters that nearly drove them to extinction.</p>
<p>The other fauna depicted in Buffalo Rising Megaways are more accurately presented, with ordinary limpid or dark eyes. The enormous moose, the majestic bear, the lithe and clever wolf.</p>
<p>These are the symbols of the American wilds which Buffalo Rising Megaways intends to evoke, and if you’re a fan of American wildlife, this might appeal to you.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The creatures are drawn nicely in the spray-painted mural style that all American wildlife themed slots have borrowed from one another. Though here the visuals are rather less annoying than in other slots that have been done in this style.</p>
<p>In fact, when coupled with the clean animation style and pleasant music, sound effects, and win sounds, the whole slot has a decidedly charming tone.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Buffalo Rising Megaways uses the Megaways system. This system has six reels, with each reel having between one and seven symbols on it. The exact number of symbols is decided at random on each spin.</p>
<p>Instead of using winlines, winning combinations are made up of any sequence of symbols on consecutive reels starting from reel one. This system results in up to 117,649 ways to win.</p>
<p>There is also a cascade mechanic and a Mystery symbol, which transforms into any symbol except the Scatter once it lands, adding a second layer of tension to each spin.</p>
<p>The cascade occurs after wins are calculated. The winning symbols are removed and new symbols fall down from above to take their place. Wins are then recalculated and any additional cascades occur if there are any new winning combinations.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter symbol.</p>
<p>Four or more Scatter symbols will trigger the Free Spin bonus. The Free Spin bonus comes in three flavours, each of which has a different volatility. They either start with: 15 free spins with a starting multiplier of x10, 10 spins with x5, or 5 spins with x10. Additional Scatters above four award additional spins.</p>
<p>There is also a Mystery bonus that awards a randomised starting multiplier and a randomised number of spins. The multiplier increases by one with every winning spin.</p>
<p>Players can buy directly into the bonus round using the Buffalo Bet option, which is priced at 100x the bet per spin.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.50%, nicely over our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.10 up to a maximum of $/£/€10.00 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is medium to high, which makes it a reasonable match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility, and although a higher RTP would be preferable, 96.50% is perfectly acceptable for this level of volatility.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>With its pleasing graphics, atmospheric sound and clean animation, Buffalo Rising Megaways makes a good first impression.</p>
<p>We’d prefer a little more oomph in the volatility department but medium-high is not bad, especially when coupled with the above average RTP and exciting bonus features.</p>
<p>This slot has our recommendation.</p>
