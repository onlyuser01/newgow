<p>The new tech hub location is expected to help the company continue to growing, strengthening its teams with local talent</p>
<p>The sports betting and platform supplier, Amelco, continues to expand its presence in Europe. The company has announced that it created a new tech hub office space located in the city of Pécs, Hungary. The new office location of the company complements its ongoing growth and is expected to play a pivotal role in its expansion on the Old Continent.</p>
<p>Moreover, Amelco anticipates engaging with local talent and attracting developers with its new tech hub. The new location will also be the company’s latest base for its Central European operations. The new office in Hungary expands further Amelco’s footprint in Europe. Thanks to the tech hub, the company continues its expansion. It comes in addition to Amelco’s office in Warsaw, Poland and is planned to be pivotal for the growth of the company’s front-end delivery teams.</p>
<p>Details regarding the new office in Hungary come after early last month, Amelco confirmed the launch of its iGaming suite in New Jersey, the United States. That strategic launch grew its US-facing footprint, by allowing the company to enter one of the most important markets in the country. Thanks to Amelco’s entry in New Jersey, operators in the state can now benefit from its extensive aggregation offering.</p>
<p>The Company Continues Global Expansion</p>
<p>Amber Walton, Amelco’s business development manager, spoke about the company’s growing presence in strategic regions, including the United States. She explained that Amelco remains focused on capturing emerging opportunities within different markets that can help it grow its teams. Walton added: “By opening our latest location, we’re set to create an additional hub to add to our global portfolio of tech centers.”</p>
<p>“As Amelco continues to grow from strength to strength across multiple regions, territories and the US, we are always on the lookout for opportunities to broaden our teams and skill sets.“ Amber Walton, business development manager at Amelco</p>
<p>According to her, the company continues to grow its Hungarian team. She praised the efforts of those members, explaining that they play an important role in many of the company’s projects. Finally, Walton predicted that in the next year, Amelco will continue to expand the number of its employees, seeking sustainable growth.</p>
