<p>Royal Potato 2 secured the Most Watched Slot, Most Streamed Slot and Best New Slot Game of the Month awards in the Tier 3 category</p>
<p>Print Studios, a developer of cutting-edge slots, has once again found its way into the GamblingNews Awards. This time, the developer’s fresh Royal Potato 2 game swept all three Tier 3 awards for September. For reference, the Tier 3 category refers to developers that release 1 slot game a month or less.</p>
<p>Royal Potato 2 secured the Most Watched Slot, Most Streamed Slot and Best New Slot Game of the Month awards in the Tier 3 category. The 5×5 game is a continuation of the beloved Royal Potato title. Featuring 30 paylines and multiple features, this video slot also boasts premium graphics and a crisp sound design.</p>
<p>About Royal Potato 2</p>
<p>Royal Potato 2 players are tasked with collecting a multitude of symbols representing various named characters. Print Studios introduces slot enthusiasts to a colorful cast of potato-themed aristocrats, including King Eduardo, Queen Taterina, Duchess Wafflecut, Countess Frytoria, Baron Roasti and Lord Chippington.</p>
<p>The game features a variety of features that boost the players’ chances to win big prizes, including the Superspinners mechanic that randomizes multipliers across the reels. Royal Levy, on the other hand, will see King Eduardo and Queen Taterina symbols award cash prizes of up to 500x or entry to the Spud Spins Bonus.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, Spud Spins is Royal Potato 2’s feature-packed bonus game where they will grow a jumbo potato symbol when certain conditions are met.</p>
<p>Print Studios is a fresh contender in the slot market that is quickly gaining traction thanks to the high quality of its games. This is not the first time the studio has won as it previously grabbed GamblingNews’ Most Streamed &amp; Watched Tier 3 Slot awards for June.</p>
