<p>Dear MadDawg,</p>
<p>A small correction to the previous e-mail,</p>
<p>after verification your balance has been completely cancelled due to this rule in the terms and conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any deposit and winnings related to a deposit bonus will be blocked until the wagers indicated for the offer have been made.</li>
</ul>
<p>'2.4.7. Players must wager the entire deposit before requesting a withdrawal. If the deposit is not played at least once, the withdrawal request will be cancelled.</p>
<p>Therefore, there are no remaining balances at this time. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.</p>
<p>Please familiarize yourself with our terms and conditions to avoid disappointment in the future.</p>

<p>We remain at your disposal for any additional assistance.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

<p>Dear MadDawg,</p>
<p>I am writing regarding your withdrawal request on Casino Estrella.</p>
<p>We inform you that our Financial Department has canceled your withdrawal, and reversed this amount back into your casino account, as this is a deposit that you did not play accordingly.</p>
<p>Indeed, according to our Terms of Use, any deposit must be wagered at least one time entirely, before any withdrawal request.</p>
<p>‘2.4.7. The players must play the full deposit before asking for a withdrawal. If it’s not wagered at least once the withdrawal request will be canceled.’</p>
<p>Consequently, you can only withdraw your winnings, but not the deposits made before playing the equivalent amount.</p>
<p>Thank you for your understanding.</p>
<p>We remain at your disposal for any additional assistance.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Ophélie</p>
