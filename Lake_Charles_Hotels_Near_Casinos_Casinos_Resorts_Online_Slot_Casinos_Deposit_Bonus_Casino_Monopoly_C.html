    <h1>Lake Charles Hotels Near Casinos Casinos Resorts Online Slot Casinos Deposit Bonus Casino Monopoly C</h1>

<p>Leading publisher of online gambling content Yggdrasil and game development studio specializing in mobile and casino games Peter &amp; Sons have once again reunited for the release of a new slot. After launching Dungeon Tower Multimax and Voodoo Hex together, the two companies have announced their fresh product: The Legend of Musashi. The game with high volatility and a maximum win of 20,000x the stake has been inspired by the iconic Ancient Japanese legend of the great master of the double blade. The game is packed with eye-catching, adrenaline-pumping mechanics and special features, ranging from ten Power Mode levels, Monster Multipliers, Monster Free Spins, and Super Free Spins games.</p>
<p>The Legend of Musashi Metrics Overview</p>
<p>Reels: 6</p>
<p>Rows: 4</p>
<p>Paylines: 4096</p>
<p>RTP: 96.1%</p>
<p>Hit Freq: –</p>
<p>Max Win: 20,000x</p>
<p>Volatility: High</p>
<p>Min/Max Bet: 0.10-20</p>
<p>Collect Scatters to Trigger the Power Mode Level</p>
<p>The action is set in a soothing-looking building with sloped tiled roofing, wooden floors, and lanterns to set the mood. The winning combos can be scored from the leftmost side of the grid and they will land over consecutive reels. Once the winning symbols are in sight, the cascade machine will pop them off the board, enabling the remaining symbols to fall and fill in the gaps. The cascading motion will continue until there are no more fresh wins making an appearance.</p>
<p>The Legend of Musashi incorporates a standard card suit as symbols, along with nunchucks, fans, clubs, blades, and character symbols. The scrolls that display the letter “W” on them are wild symbols and they can replace all regular paying symbols.</p>
<p>Players who manage to collect 65 scatters in a meter automatically trigger one of the ten available Power Mode levels. The Power Mode is a popular collection feature rewarding loyal players while introducing an element of progression to the gameplay. During this mode, players are randomly given between three and ten lives. Once a Wild symbol pops up, it will turn into an Expanding Wild that will use up one of the lives. The Power Mode ends when all lives are lost.</p>
<p>When a player manages to complete all levels and collect around 650 scatters, the Super Free Spins game is activated. Here, the wilds turn into expanding wilds. When a scatter hits, an additional free spin is given to the player. The multiplier’s starting value goes up by +1. Similarly, players who land three scatters receive ten Monster Free Spins and two extra free spins for every extra scatter. Here, the multiplier resets after each free spin.</p>
<p>An Excellent Year for Both Companies</p>
<p>Yggdrasil’s head of products and programs Stuart McCarthy expressed their delight regarding the fresh release with “visually stunning” elements that were made possible with the help of Peter &amp; Sons. McCarthy added they “couldn’t have asked for a better game” to end the year.</p>
<p>Peter &amp; Sons’ business development manager Yann Bautista called 2022 “a fantastic year” in terms of releasing “top-tier games with Yggdrasil.” Bautista called The Legend of Musashi the epitome of “everything we’re about”, expecting it to perform “exceptionally well.”</p>
