<p>The San Francisco 49ers travel to Pennsylvania this coming Sunday to take on the Philadelphia Eagles in the 2023 NFC Championship game</p>
<p>The 49ers vs Eagles NFC Championship game is a clash between the two highest seeds in the NFC. The Eagles finished the regular season with the best record in the conference (14-3), which earned them a bye in the first round of the playoffs. Their first postseason game was against the New York Giants, which Nick Sirianni’s boys defeated 38-7.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Niners finished second in the NFC, and had to play a Wild Card game. They had no problems beating the Seattle Seahawks 41-23 in the first match of the playoffs. Then, in the Divisional Round, Kyle Shanahan’s men defeated the Dallas Cowboys 19-12.</p>

<p>San Francisco 49ers are Ready for the NFC Championship Game</p>
<p>The 49ers vs Eagles game is going to be the youngest QB matchup in the NFC Championship history. Philly’s quarterback Jalen Hurts is 24 years old, while the Niners signal-caller Brock Purdy is a year younger.</p>
<p>Even though he started the season as a third-string QB, Purdy proved to everyone that lack of experience isn’t an issue for him. He was instrumental in taking the Niners to their 18th conference championship game – the most in the history of the NFL.</p>
<p>They got to the NFC Championship game after beating the Dallas Cowboys in a very difficult match last Sunday. The final score was 19-12, with each team scoring just one touchdown. Christian McCaffrey scored a rushing TD for San Francisco, while the rest of his team’s points came from field goals. Placekicker Robbie Gould went 4/4 in field goals, while also scoring one extra point.</p>
<p>The reason behind this is that most of his kicks were from close range – Purdy &amp; Co. did a great job in bringing the ball close to the red zone. We expect to see something similar from the Niners in the NFC Championship game. They’re going to try and run the ball, probably without risking too much.</p>
<p>Philadelphia Eagles Ready for the Toughest Challenge of the 2022-23 Season</p>
<p>The Eagles were brilliant in the regular season, but truth be told, their schedule wasn’t too hard. They also had an easy job in the Divisional Round, in which they played against the New York Giants, who are probably the biggest overachievers of the 2022-23 season.</p>
<p>As a result, their toughest challenge of the season is on the program this Sunday. They’re taking on the 49ers for the first time since September 2021. They lost that game 17-11, but their QB Jalen Hurts – who was rookie back then – had a decent game, at least running-wise.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, Hurts has been great running the ball, as you’d expect from this guy, but in the 2022-23 season, his passing game has been superb as well. In the Divisional Round, we saw him throw 16/24 for 154 yards and two touchdowns. Unsurprisingly, he also made nine carries, scoring one rushing TD along the way.</p>
<p>San Francisco 49ers vs Philadelphia Eagles Prediction</p>
<p>We’re 100% certain both teams will focus on the running game. They’re going to take things easy, trying to get the ball in the field goal zone, rather than going for risky passes. That said, we expect this to be a very low-scoring affair. But which team will win the slugfest?</p>
<p>Our vote goes to the Niners, the main reason being that their key men have way more experience than those playing for the Eagles.</p>
