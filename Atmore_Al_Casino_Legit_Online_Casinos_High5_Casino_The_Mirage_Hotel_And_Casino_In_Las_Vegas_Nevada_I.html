    <h1>Atmore Al Casino Legit Online Casinos High5 Casino The Mirage Hotel And Casino In Las Vegas Nevada I</h1>

<p>Pariplay’s Wizard Games studio has tapped a new iGaming veteran who will serve as its chief operations officer. Deane Hendricks is stepping into the position to provide the Pariplay brand with all that it would need to continue expanding its footprint in the industry.</p>
<p>Charting New Growth Strategies</p>
<p>Just last week, Pariplay announced that it’s adding Wizard Games to Kaizen Gaming, giving it a further leg-up in the European gambling market. In his position, Hendricks will seek to expand on existing growth strategies and coin new ones with the studio’s in-house games team.</p>
<p>He will also be in charge of looking to secure new partners where Wizard Games can list its games and bring added value for those brands’ customers as well as the studio itself. Hendricks is coming from a similar position at GameART.</p>
<p>He has also been involved with some of the most notable developers of our time, name NetEnt, where he worked as senior game product owner and game product owner lead, and Play’n Go, where he served as casino games producer.</p>
<p>Pariplay has allowed Wizard Games to exist as a standalone business unit within its ecosystem where the company can make autonomous decisions about further development. The studio benefits from the fact that Pariplay is a powerful aggregator platform that can quickly inject the latest releases with its customers.</p>
<p>Numerous Products in the Pipeline</p>
<p>Pariplay has 28 products in the pipeline for 2022 alone, which will come on top of the 120 brands currently available as part of the studio’s portfolio. Pariplay’s Fusion aggregator platform is now available across 15 regulated markets in Europe, North, and Latin America, making for a quick and reliable delivery system for Wizard Games’ products.</p>
<p>Wizard Games newly appointed COO welcomed the opportunity to be joining Wizard Games and be able to further spearhead its growth and day-to-day operations. The executive added:</p>
<p>“We are blessed with a highly skilled creative team, and it is important that we can continue to demonstrate to operator partners’ products that can really deliver. The product roadmap for 2022 is exciting, and I am determined to build on our current momentum to deliver strong growth.” Wizard Games COO Deane Hendricks</p>
<p>Wizard Games managing director Joey Hurtado welcomed the appointment, praising Deane’s credentials as an industry leader and innovator. Deane’s joining the team serves as a clear signal to partners about how serious Wizard Games is to scale its products and offer the best possible solutions to partners around the world.</p>
