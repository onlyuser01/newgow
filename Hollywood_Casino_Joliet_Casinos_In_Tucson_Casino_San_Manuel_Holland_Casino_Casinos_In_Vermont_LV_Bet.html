<p>LV Bet Appoints Douglas Costa de Souza as Brand Ambassador</p>
<p>Online sports betting and casino operator LV Bet has appointed Brazillian football player Douglas Costa de Souza as its Brand Ambassador for Brazil. The move is part of LV Bet’s push to strengthen its presence in the Brazilian and Latin American online gambling markets.</p>
<p>Through the contract, Costa will provide the online sportsbook operator with insights and expertise to help the company capitalize on the burgeoning Latin American market. The market has been growing for some time now and has finally begun attracting widespread international attention.

<p>Costa is an internationally renowned player, currently a winger for Bundesliga club Bayern Munich, on loan from Italy’s Juventus Football Club. Costa often referred to with the nickname “Flash” has established himself as a strong winger, capable of playing on either flank. He is also renowned for his adaptive and creative style of play, as well as his speed, agility, and explosive acceleration on the field.</p>
<p>LV Bet and Costa Both Excited for Brazilian Market Partnership</p>
<p>In regard to joining the LV Bet team, Costa stated that he was delighted to sign with the company as a brand ambassador. He lauded the online sportsbook operator and its ambitious team. Costa said it was his privilege to provide his expertise to the company and help it grow in the Brazilian online gambling market.</p>
<p>LV Bet Chief Commercial Officer Marcin Jablonski also welcomed Costa as the company’s new Brand Ambassador. According to him, the internationally renowned football player fits perfectly with LV Bet. Furthermore, Jablonski stressed that Costa’s energy, commitment, and drive on the field matches LV Bet’s philosophy as a brand.</p>
<p>Jablonski also noted that working with Costa will not only provide LV Bet with greater brand awareness in the Brazillian market but will also allow the company to build trust in a new market.</p>
