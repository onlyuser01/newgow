    <h1>Wynn Casino Poker Tournament Who Owns Wynn Casino In Vegas Casino Where To Watch Red Dragon Casino C</h1>

<p>As announced by Ewa Bakun, Clarion Gaming’s director of industry insight and engagement, the internationally recognized Customer Protection Zone, will make a return. Citing the responsible approach to advertising award the zone won at the recent Global Regulatory Awards, Bakun noted that the CPZ is “one of the many success stories made possible by ICE.“</p>
<p>ICE London 2023 Will Have the Biggest CPZ Yet</p>
<p>The United Kingdom’s Gambling Commission will be one of the participants in the ICE London event next year. The British regulator will join the award-winning Consumer Protection Zone, as announced by the Clarion spokesperson.</p>
<p>Following the successes mentioned by the Clarion industry insight director, ICE has decided to expand the CPZ for this year’s event. The fair will sport 20 stands in the zone, meaning that it will be 50% larger than it was in the event’s previous iteration and more than 100% larger than it was when it was first introduced in 2018.</p>
<p>Bakun pointed out that the CPZ is “the brainchild” of Tim Miller from the UKGC. She noted that the Customer Protection Zone, which at first had only eight stands, has now expanded significantly. It will now occupy a prominent location adjacent to the main boulevard at ExCeL London – the place where the event will take place.</p>
<p>Bakun thanked the generous industry supporters and sponsors for helping the CPZ raise $177,000 for various gambling industry charities over the previous three editions of the event. She hopes to boost this number to $242,000 during the upcoming iteration of the event.</p>
<p>Major Companies Will Attend the Event</p>
<p>ICE London is scheduled for February 7-9 and will take place at the ExCeL Exhibition Center in London. As mentioned, the new Customer Protection Zone will have 20 stands and will feature a variety of leading responsible gambling tech providers and non-profit organizations.</p>
<p>Here is the complete list of the bodies that will participate in the event:</p>
