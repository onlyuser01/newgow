    <h1>777 Casino Drive Cherokee Nc 28719 Sweepstakes Casino Lake Charles Casino Quinault Beach Resort Casi</h1>

<p>On January 26, 2022 I deposited $30 twice (Trace ID 261835 and trace ID 261837) onto my players account at the Hallmark Casino. I did not use any bonuses on these deposits. I won $1500+ and decided to get a withdraw of $1000 and I kept $500 of my winnings in my account. I received an email stating that my request was approved. Then it was a couple of days and I sent an email asking about the process which they sent an email back saying it was being processed. I filled out the account authorization form and sent the pictures of my id and my cards front and back and my utility bill. They sent me an email stating that my withdraw request was approved for $300 and I am like what happened to the remaining $700? I have been dealing with this we are going on three weeks I have been working on this just to get my winnings. I used my hard earned money. I have a copy of all our correspondances and copies if my transaction history, my top victories, my game history, etc. They state that on the inital withdraw they only give 100% of the deposit? How is that possible? it shouldn't matter what I deposited I won that money fair and square and no where in their terms and conditions does it state that is what they intend to do. So what happens to the balance of $700? I dont want to play at this casino anymore I want my winnings. I tried getting a contact information with regards to contacting the person who takes complaints and the lady I was chatting with refused to give me this information I asked politely like four times for that information to no avail which is very frustrating for me. I shouldn't have to deal with this. I have cancer and was just trying to enjoy some time at the casino since I cannot go physically to the casino right now. I never thought that this would ever happen to me. Can your company please help me? These winnings will help me with my bills.</p>
