<p>Boyd Gaming’s efforts to reopen its gaming venues are taking a big step in the right direction, with the Orleans owner saying it plans to restart business at 13 of its casinos, including nine in Las Vegas, from June 1 through June 4.</p>

<p>Joining a slew of Nevada operators in targeting a June 4 restart date, Boyd will reopen all but three of its Sin City venues. The Orleans, Gold Coast, Suncoast, Aliante, Cannery, Sam’s Town, Fremont, California, and Jokers Wild will receive patrons on June 4, while East Side Cannery, Eldorado and Main Street Station will open at a later date.</p>
<p>Upon reopening, all properties will operate with limited amenities and capacity restrictions in compliance with state and local requirements,” according to a statement issued by the company. “Additionally, all Boyd Gaming properties will practice ‘Boyd Clean,’ a set of comprehensive protocols aimed at protecting the health and safety of our team members and guests.”</p>
<p>At a meeting earlier this week, the Nevada Gaming Control Board (NGCB) hashed out issues. governing the reopening of the state’s gaming venues, including temperature screening of employees and guests, and a requirement for staff to wear masks.</p>
<p>Other Reopenings</p>
<p>Boyd also said its Ameristar St. Charles and Ameristar Kansas City in Missouri, and the Diamond Jo Dubuque and Diamond Jo Worth in Iowa, will come back online on June 1.</p>
<p>That means the operator will restart 13 properties in three states between June 1 and June 4. Last week, the company reopened a total of eight casinos in Kansas, Louisiana, and Mississippi. By number of venues, Louisiana, with five, is Boyd’s second-largest market after Las Vegas.</p>
<p>With the aforementioned early June restarts, 21 of Boyd’s 29 venues will again be open for business following the more than two-month coronavirus shutdown.</p>
<p>“By the first week of June, we look forward to having 21 of our 29 properties across the country back in operation, and we are optimistic that we will be able to reopen most of our remaining properties by the end of June,” said Boyd CEO Keith Smith in the statement.</p>
<p>Waiting on the Midwest</p>
<p>While Boyd has the green light to restart business in Iowa and Missouri, the operator is waiting on some other Midwest states to follow suit.</p>
<p>Indiana, where Boyd owns the Belterra and Blue Chip, is aiming for mid-June reopening dates for casinos. But there’s less clarity on when Illinois – home to Boyd’s Par-A-Dice – will lift COVID-19 restrictions.</p>
<p>The company owns Belterra Park in Ohio, a state that hasn’t announced a firm date for reopening casinos. Last week, regulators in Pennsylvania, where Boyd runs the Valley Forge Casino, delivered reopening protocols to operators of the state’s 12 land-based gaming properties. But it’s not immediately clear when those venues will resume business.</p>
<p>Boyd said it will provide updates on the still-shuttered properties as information becomes available.</p>
