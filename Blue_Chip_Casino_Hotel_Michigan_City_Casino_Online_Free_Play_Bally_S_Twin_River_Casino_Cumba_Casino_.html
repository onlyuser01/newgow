<p>Bragg Gaming Group has expanded its iGaming footprint in the United States by teaming up with the prominent operator</p>
<p>Moving forward, Bragg games will be made available to FanDuel customers in Michigan and Connecticut, two states which have been fast-embracing online gaming. FanDuel has been keen to strengthen its own footprint in the sector, bringing in different licensed suppliers to help it achieve this.</p>
<p>Bragg makes for a perfect partner as the company is capable of delivering games from its own studios as well as injecting content from third-party suppliers. There will be numerous releases and content integrations in the coming months, Bragg said in a press statement.</p>
<p>Among the titles delivered to FanDuel are games by Atomic Slot Lab, Indigo Magic, and Spin Games, which are all part of Bragg’s family of proprietary development assets. However, Bragg will also deploy third-party content through its Powered by Bragg solution, which includes Bluberi, Incredible Technologies, Galaxy Gaming, King Show Games, Sega Sammy Creation, and more.</p>
<p>This content rollout allows FanDuel and Bragg to both benefit as they seek to consolidate their standing in the iGaming market in the United States.</p>
<p>Bragg CEO Yaniv Sherman welcomed the opportunity to see his company’s footprint in the North American market increase and for the company to be able to bring in excellent iGaming solutions for some of the leading operators in the region. He added:</p>
<p>As such, the rollout of our new proprietary and third-party exclusive games and technology with FanDuel in Michigan and Connecticut is a significant proof point of the success of our new US content roadmap. Bragg CEO Yaniv Sherman</p>
<p>Bragg Is Committed to Working with the Best iGaming Brands</p>
<p>Sherman welcomed the chance to be building further on the relationship with FanDuel and deliver even more premium content to help grow engagement and retention with customers. Bragg has been one of the most rapidly evolving and expanding studios with the supplier launching also recently launching a global distribution alliance with 888 Holdings.</p>
<p>The supplier similarly worked out a new iGaming rollout for its products in Pennsylvania where the company teamed up with Rush Street Interactive’s BetRivers brand to further consolidate its presence in the local market.</p>
<p>Bragg has been similarly expanding in Europe, where the company has secured a number of important deals in Switzerland and Italy, all the while maintaining strong financial performance in the first quarter of the year.</p>
