<p>An official press release by gaming giant Konami announced that David Punter, operations manager of sales, marketing, and service for the ANZ and APAC regions, will also take charge of the Asia region and service. The company expressed confidence that Punter’s significant experience and substantial industry knowledge would help meet the needs of the areas under his management.</p>
<p>Konami Lauded Punter’s Accomplishments</p>
<p>A punter has about two decades of relevant industry experience, making him well-suited to his expanded role. He has been with Konami for over four years, starting as a national sales manager for the Australia and New Zealand regions. According to the company’s press release, Punter achieved stellar results, demonstrating consistent success and driving growth in the markets he managed. Steve Sutherland, executive officer of Konami’s global gaming and systems division and managing director at Konami Australia, expressed confidence that Punter’s expanded duties would improve customer satisfaction and drive product sales across his assigned regions.</p>
<p>With David’s expanded leadership across Asia and passion for effective market delivery, his expanded role will drive even further momentum across ANZ and APAC. Steve Sutherland, managing director at Konami Australia</p>
<p>Sutherland also lauded Punter’s extensive management experience across high-profile companies in the gaming industry. He added that the new Asia region manager’s drive for customer satisfaction, sales, and marketing, made him the perfect choice for the promotion.</p>
<p>He Worked for Industry Leaders Aristocrat and Scientific Games</p>
<p>The new position should not pose any challenge to a veteran like Punter. After graduating from the University of Newcastle in 1999 with a Bachelor’s degree in Commerce and Marketing, he made his big break at gaming solution provider Aristocrat Technologies. He spent 13 years with the game developer, starting as regional marketing manager for Australia’s New South Wales province.</p>
<p>Punter’s motivation and dedication quickly propelled him through the ranks, and over the course of 13 years, he rose to general manager of the Asia Pacific region. Leading a team of over 25, he directed sales, research, finance, marketing, and operations, developing and implementing region-specific products and strategies. Punter later moved to Scientific Games, another well-known name in the gaming industry. He worked for three years at the Lottery products and service provider’s Sales division before moving to Konami in 2018.</p>
<p>Punter Steps In at a Crucial Moment</p>
<p>A reshuffling in the leadership team for the Asia area could signify a shakeup at Konami or a change in priorities. The region’s gambling market is currently in flux, with Macau’s sustained decline leading many casino suppliers to relocate to the Philippines and Singapore in search of better opportunities.</p>
<p>Punter’s promotion could result from Konami’s desire to capitalize on resurging global uncertainty in the gambling market by placing an experienced professional in charge of a key region. The new Asia manager’s impressive career and a sizable list of accomplishments make him a solid choice to take the additional responsibility.</p>
