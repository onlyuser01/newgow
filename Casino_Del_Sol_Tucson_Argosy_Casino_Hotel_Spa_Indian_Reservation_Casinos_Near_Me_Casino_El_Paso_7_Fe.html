<p>SOFTSWISS has released its new Jackpot Aggregator solution via RocketPlay Casino through a new partnership</p>
<p>The award-winning and fast-growing provider of online gaming and betting software has announced the launch of its new solution as a means of expanding its global reach.</p>
<p>Jackpot Aggregator to Offer a Superior User Experience</p>
<p>SOFTSWISS’s Jackpot Aggregator provides a one-of-a-kind, multi-purpose “Jackpot as a Service” business model that strengthens online casinos’ list of offerings while helping boost player acquisition and retention numbers.</p>
<p>As explained by SOFTSWISS, jackpots can considerably improve brand competitiveness and draw in fresh players while retaining existing customers. At the same time, they are effectively used for expanding lifetime value and bet amounts while resulting in increased operator revenue.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the provider’s jackpot software module is expected to assist its partners, including its fresh RocketPlay Casino partner, with boosting the value proposition of their online gaming brand. The Jackpot Aggregator solution will be initially used by RocketPlay Casino to make sure that its Mystic Jackpots campaign will be running as smoothly and effortlessly as possible.</p>
<p>The casino’s chief commercial officer Yuriy Mogyr called the new deal a “great opportunity to work with SOFTSWISS to leverage the Jackpot Aggregator.” Mogyr also expressed their desire to offer a fantastic gaming experience while announcing their eagerness to observe the effects of the new partnership.</p>
<p>RocketPlay to Reach Its Player Retention Goals with SOFTSWISS</p>
<p>The campaign that is run by the crypto-friendly casino that offers multi-currency payment alternatives to players counts three different prize levels with the top reward reaching €22,200 ($23,640). RocketPlay has already built an impressive portfolio that hosts more than 3,000 slots from over 40 software providers and gaming studios, along with roulette games, live dealer titles, and a series of additional gaming options.</p>
<p>The agreement inked with the Curacao-licensed gaming platform will help SOFTWSWISS extend its client portfolio with the casino that is “famous for their extensive game choices and fair practices,” according to SOFTSWISS’ head of Jackpot Aggregator Aliaskei Douhin. Douhin added SOFTSWISS will offer its support throughout RocketPlay’s jackpot campaign and guarantee the casino will reach its player retention goals.</p>
<p>In general, casinos that decide to use the Jackpot Aggregator will be given access to SOFTSWISS’ custom virtual jackpot system that will be easily integrated with any existing project, whether it is a game provider, a game aggregator, or an online casino.</p>
<p>At the start of the month, SOFTSWISS announced it was selected to deliver its Jackpot Aggregator solution across all of Cleopatra Group’s six casinos. The decision marked the first time that the solution would power an entire casino group.</p>
