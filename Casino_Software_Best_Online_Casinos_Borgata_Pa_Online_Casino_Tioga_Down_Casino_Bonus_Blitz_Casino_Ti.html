The game invites players to unleash the power of the Golden Tiger while scooping up the well-hidden riches in a lush jungle.</p>
<p>If you are ready to learn more about the game released in 2017 by Genesis Gaming, keep reading. Our expert Tiger Temple slot review experts have tested the slot that offers free spins, a maximum win of 400x the total bet, a Majestic Respin feature in place, and captivating art and animation for you. Here is what they came across.</p>
<p>Theme, Storyline, and Graphics: the Legend of the Ancient Temple of the Tiger</p>
<p>Like many other top providers in the iGaming world, Genesis Gaming likes to inspire its storylines and themes from popular legends and folktales around the world. This time around, the studio selected the ancient Chinese legend that speaks about the ancient temple of a tiger. The fascinating temple is located in the tropical jungle and it creates the mysterious universe of the game where players are invited to get acquainted with the local culture while coming across the hidden treasures guarded by the dangerous tiger. As long as players follow a set of simple rules, they should be safe and sound and not avoid turning into the fearful predator’s next victim.</p>
<p>The eye-catching reels are set against a dark red backdrop representing a Chinese pagoda-type building. The overall stylization of the slot consists of bright colors that are representative of Chinese culture. All design elements have gone through detailed drawing sessions with a lot of attention to detail.</p>
<p>The overall aesthetics also consist of bright flashes of color and numerous beams of light seen cascading from the sides of the grid. The five available reels are also set against a dark-colored background and they are packed with brightly-colored coins displaying purple, golden, green, and blue dragons. The rather peculiar layout of the uneven rows consists of the first and last reels counting three rows of symbols, whereas the central reels count four rows each.</p>
<p>Tiger Temple: Game Symbols and Payouts</p>
<p>The game’s low-paying symbols are the standard card values (10, J, Q, K, A) featuring stylized versions that perfectly match the chosen theme. Players who manage to match a minimum of three of these card symbols are awarded a win. For example, the 10 can trigger up to 10x the bet per line, while the J card brings players up to 12x the line bet.</p>
<p>Matching a minimum of three Qs or Ks brings players up to 14x times the bet per line, while the A card can lead to a payout of 14x the line bet. The dragon symbols are the high-paying symbols, with the green awarding up to 20x the line bet, the blue triggering up to 30x the line bet, the gold paying up to 40x and the purple dragon triggering a payout of up to 50x the line bet.</p>
<p>The scatter symbol is represented by the fortune god. Players only need to see one of these symbols anywhere on the grid to trigger a win, which is a nice change of pace when compared to other slots where a minimum of three scatters are necessary to generate a win.</p>
<p>Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>All the animations run smoothly which means that players’ progress is seamless with each new spin they take. This is true even when the turbo setting is in play.</p>
<p>The upbeat Oriental-inspired soundtrack perfectly complements the theme and storylines without distracting players from the actual gameplay. At the same time, the additional sounds heard while the reels are spinning are subtle and they do a good job of adding more to the excitement of the gameplay.</p>
<p>Tiger Temple Gameplay</p>
<p>The game features the same standard control panel found in all Genesis Gaming slots. The 40 available pay lines are fixed by default, which means that players solely need to focus on betting via the Bet button, with bets starting at 0.01 up to 2 coins per line. Players can adjust the bet per payline while the total wager per each of the spins is determined by multiplying the amount by the 40 fixed pay lines.</p>
<p>To start spinning the reels, players must click or tap the big blue button that will turn into a Stop button at the end of the round. The small key tab with round arrows will trigger Autoplay mode which lets players select their preferred number of spins and run the game with zero hassle. The question mark button introduces players to additional information regarding the paytable, symbols, and overall gameplay and settings. Players can also click the speaker to turn off the music.</p>
<p>Tiger Temple: Re-Spins and Fortune God Free Spin Feature</p>
<p>The Wild symbol is represented by the golden tiger symbol. Matching a minimum of two of these symbols brings players an additional win of up to 400x the initial line bet. Wilds can be stacked on the reel, in which case they will also trigger a golden tiger re-spin. When this occurs, all wilds will remain locked in their positions while also bringing players three free spins.</p>
<p>Players who manage to land two stacks of wilds will initiate the tiger re-spin. During the re-spin, the wild symbols will be locked again and trigger two re-spins. The feature comes with a 2x multiplier that will help build juicer payouts.</p>
<p>The scatter symbol is represented by a golden man statue that has the word Bonus written on it. Landing a minimum of three of these symbols across the reels will initiate the free spins feature which will bring players 10 free spins. During this feature, players can re-trigger an additional 10 spins when three scatters are seen landing.</p>
<p>Final Thoughts</p>
<p>If you are looking for an Asian-themed slot with 40 pay lines and a cool tiger theme, try Genesis Gaming’s Tiger Temple and get ready to enjoy some cool bonus features that will make your gameplay more lucrative and engaging.</p>
