    <h1>Fitzgerald Casino Tunica Windstar Casino Hotel Kansas Crossing Casino Hotel Santa Fe Station Hotel C</h1>

<p>The Minnesota Vikings professional National Football League franchise will be collaborating with tech solutions provider SharpLink Gaming for launching a fantasy online Pass or Play game on the Vikings’ app. The announcement was made yesterday by SharpLink.</p>
<p>The Vikings’ New Pass or Play Game</p>
<p>Players can play the Pass or Play game through Minnesota Vikings’ official phone app or the franchise’s official website. As a fantasy game, Pass or Play will let users create a customized team each week. Players will be provided with three cards for each position. The cards are dealt in a row – upon seeing the first card, and players can decide to either play it or pass it. If they pass, the second card is revealed, and so on. Should a player pass all three cards in one of the positions, they will be given a new card the next day.</p>
<p>Players earn points like in a traditional fantasy game. Each week’s top three players will receive various rewards, provided by the Minnesota Vikings and the app’s sponsor Mystic Lake Casino and Hotel.</p>
<p>The app will greatly benefit from SharpLink’s cutting-edge tech solutions as the company has vast experience in working for the sports and betting industries. Its clever and well-designed tools make it easy for sports fans to discover sports betting and enhance their experience. SharpLink fields a state-of-the-art AI system that tailors custom betting offerings for each of its players.</p>
<p>Engaging the Minnesota Vikings Fanbase</p>
<p>SharpLink’s chief executive officer, Rob Phythian, spoke on the partnership and the necessity of providing the best fantasy-style games to sports fans in the United States.</p>
<p>“With more than 60 million Americans actively playing free-to-play fantasy-style games and contests online last year, digital gamification of real-time sports has become a must-have fan engagement tool by sports media publishers, leagues, and teams,” he explained.</p>
<p>Phythian pointed out that SharpLink has more than 15 years of field experience when it comes to fantasy games. Thanks to its profound knowledge on the matter, the company specializes in providing entertainment that brings fans and teams closer together.</p>
<p>Finally, Phythian added that as sports betting is yet to be legalized in Minnesota, it is important to create other “innovative and fun gaming experiences” for fans of the football team.</p>
<p>Minnesota Vikings’ executive director of digital media and innovation, Scott Kegley, is excited to offer the Pass or Play game to fans of the franchise and engage them even further in the days before the team plays on the field.</p>
<p>Kegley is glad to be working with SharpLink for a third consecutive year. He believes that Pass or Play is a great offering to fans of the Minnesota Vikings.</p>
<p>“It’s a game we feel is best-in-class, blending luck and skill and engaging our fans that crave this type of gaming experience.”</p>
<p>Minnesota Vikings lovers can download the mobile app or hop in on the team’s site to play.</p>
