<p>South Korean Companies Fined $1 Million Over Deceptive Loot Box Odds</p>

<p>Three South Korean games developers, have been hit with fines totaling nearly $1 million for misrepresenting the odds used in their in-game loot boxes.</p>

But if social casino games are now considered illegal gambling in Washington State, why not loot boxes too, which use similar mechanisms? (Image: Nexon Korea)</p>
<p>According to the Korean Herald, the country’s largest games developer, Nexon Korea, received the lion’s share of fines – around $890,000 – for deceiving customers over the chances of winning virtual prizes via loot boxes in Counter Strike Online 2 and Sudden Attack.</p>
<p>The South Korean Fair-Trade Commission (FTC) said Nexon also failed to inform customers of their right to withdraw in-game purchases in Counter Strike Online 2.</p>
<p>The remainder of the penalties were imposed on NextFloor, the creator of mobile game Destiny’s Child, and Netmarble, which publishes Ys Online and Star Wars: Force Arena, for similar transgressions. The FTC ordered all three companies to revise the way they promote and disclose odds in the future.</p>
<p>Are Gamers Being Looted?</p>
<p>Loot boxes are consumable in-game items that offer randomized chances to win more virtual items or skills. Increasingly, bought-and-paid-for video games – not just mobile games apps – are demanding microtransactions from players for access to loot boxes, which often offer skills that are necessary for advancement in the game.</p>
<p>Titles like Star Wars Battlefront II have been singled out for criticism and have recently brought loot-boxes into the political sphere.</p>
<p>Lawmakers from Washington State to Hawaii have been asking questions about whether in-game loot boxes can be classed as illegal gambling, and the issue has even been raised in Congress.</p>
<p>In February, US Senator Maggie Hassan (D-New Hampshire) quizzed the Federal Trade Commission to ask whether it believed that “children being addicted to gaming – and activities like loot boxes that might make them more susceptible to addiction – is a problem that merits attention?”</p>
<p>She told fellow lawmakers she had also written to the video games industry self-regulator, the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB), which last October said it would not give loot box games “adults only” ratings because it did not consider them to be gambling.</p>
<p>Hassan is applying pressure on the ESRB to reconsider its position.</p>
<p>Something of Value</p>
<p>Just weeks ago, a federal court ruled that the games at Big Fish social casino constituted illegal gambling under Washington State law because the play-money chips used in its casino-style games were “something of value” and therefore could be classed as a gambler’s “stake.”</p>
<p>The definition of gambling in Washington state, as it is in many states across the US, is “risking something of value on the outcome of a contest of chance or a future contingent event not under the person’s control or influence to receive something of value in the event of a certain outcome.”</p>
<p>As has been widely reported, the verdict has troubling ramifications for social casino industry. But social casino games are obvious targets because they are simulations traditional gambling games.</p>
<p>If virtual in-game items such as play-money chips represent “something of value,” then loot boxes must also constitute illegal gambling, at least in Washington State, since they incorporate “valuable” in-game items risked on games that contain elements of chance.</p>
<p>The ruling in Washington State is eccentric and will be challenged – with a good chance of success. But, until then, it’s not just social casino operators who should be concerned.</p>
