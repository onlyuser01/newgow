<p>Going forward, Big Ten Network fans will be presented with new experiences featuring integration and visualization of sports data</p>
<p>Sports data and technology company Sportradar announced today it has moved to renew the company’s partnership with Big Ten Network through the 2024-25 college athletics season.</p>
<p>The Collaboration Is Set to Continue</p>
<p>The contract extension means that Nasdaq-listed Sportradar will continue to power Big Ten Network’s OTT platform B1G+ for three more years, as well as manage the backend and frontend (including web, mobile and connected TV apps), UX/UI design and third-party integration of the network dedicated to covering one of the biggest collegiate conferences in the US, Big Ten Conference.</p>
<p>Sportradar and Big Ten Network initially teamed up in 2021 when the conference selected the provider of sports entertainment products and services for the relaunch of its direct-to-consumer subscription service for non-televised events, B1G+.</p>
<p>The revitalized OTT service includes approximately 1,500 live streams of Big Ten Olympic sports and video-on-demand of basketball and football games that were previously aired on linear channels and allows consumers to directly subscribe to televised events supported by the Big Ten Network.</p>
<p>Sportradar delivered live streams of Big Ten Olympic sports, video-on-demand of basketball and football games and school-specific channels creating an end-to-end OTT solution with historical content and shoulder programming that provides fans with extensive customization and personalization options and the ability to focus on content from their favorite team.</p>
<p>Big Ten Network and Sportradar will continue their collaboration moving forward, enhancing the user experience through additional front-end experiences that will also feature integration and visualization of sports data to create an immersive experience for the viewers.</p>
<p>The Big Ten Network</p>
<p>Created as a joint venture between one of the premier collegiate conferences in the US, the Big Ten Conference, and Fox Networks, the Big Ten Network is the first network dedicated to covering a collegiate conference that is distributed internationally.</p>
<p>Serving as the ultimate destination for Big Ten Fans and alumni nationwide, the network presents more than 1,700 events across its platforms, allowing its fans to see and support their favorite teams from any place in the country around the clock.</p>
<p>Events include football and men’s and women’s basketball games, Big Ten Olympic sports and championships, studio shows and classic games, while activities and accomplishments of some of the nation’s finest universities are highlighted in the network’s original programming.</p>
<p>A digital extension of the Big Ten Network, the Fox Sports App delivers live games and on-demand programming to Big Ten Network customers online and via mobile.</p>
<p>Operating at the intersection of sports, media and betting, Sportradar provides sports federations, news media, consumer platforms and sports betting operators with a range of solutions to support growth for their partners.</p>
<p>Sportradar’s OTT partners benefit from the continuous innovation of the platform’s end-to-end solutions aimed at deepening fan engagement via customization and personalization.</p>
