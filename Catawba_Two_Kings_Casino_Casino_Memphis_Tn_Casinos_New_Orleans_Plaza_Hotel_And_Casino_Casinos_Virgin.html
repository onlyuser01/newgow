<p>The details of The Cordish Companies Local Share Account $21M raised for local projects in Westmoreland Country have been made public</p>
<p>Since the $150-million, first-class gaming and entertainment destination Live! Casino Pittsburgh opened its gates in November 2020 under the reputable The Cordish Companies’ brand, the two have set up a $21-million Local Share Account (LSA). The LSA money was used to generate grants that have since reached a number of municipalities and non-profit organizations in Westmoreland County.</p>
<p>Now, the duo has made all the details of the grants known to the public, giving grant recipients, leaders in the local communities, state legislators, county commissioners, and Hempfield Township representatives many reasons to celebrate.</p>
<p>All Community Investments, Aimed at Improving the Quality of Life</p>
<p>Proving their goal to play “an important role in supporting and enhancing the communities” in Philadelphia’s Westmoreland County, the Cordish Companies, the family-owned business with global reach that develops urban revitalization projects and entertainment districts, has announced the destinations of the funds.</p>
<p>The money reached a series of important projects, including the reconstruction of old bridges, the resurfacing of roads, bringing improvement to local parks and playgrounds, upgrading stormwater and equipment used by local emergency services including the fire department and the police, and more.</p>
<p>The LSA grant proceeds have three different sources for funding: the Local Share Account Statewide with $12,928,220, the Local Share Account Category 4 Facilities Program for Westmoreland County with $4,021,881, and the Hempfield Township which received an extra $4,021,881.</p>
<p>The LSA proceeds generated by Live! Casino for fiscal years 2021 and 2022 reached 38 local municipalities and organizations and were used as an important investment for 77 projects in the county while individual grants ranged from $2,850 to $1 million.</p>
<p>The Hempfield Township Casino, “a True Blessing”</p>
<p>According to Douglas Weimer, the vice chair of the Hempfield Township Board of Supervisors, the opening of the Hempfield Township casino has enabled them to “reverse and improve the economy around the mall” while enhancing the resources and services in the local community.</p>
<p>Since its opening three years ago, the Live! Casino facility has generated close to $519 million in investments to the local economy, including $40 million paid in licensing fees, $100 million in construction jobs and expenses, $5.1 million paid as local taxes to the Hempfield Township, $123 million that reached the Pennsylvania Department of Revenue in the form of taxes from gaming, and close to $55 million in employee compensations among others.</p>
<p>The Cordish Companies’ managing partner, Joe Weinberg, praised the work put in by their team members, along with elected officials and local organizations toward building a “stronger Westmoreland County through our continued partnership.”</p>
<p>Joining in on the celebrations, the general manager for Live Casino, Sean Sullivan, explained that making a positive impact on the local community has always represented a top priority for them. He added they will continue to support local families with more employment opportunities and local charities with the help of donations and volunteering work.</p>
<p>In April, The Cordish Companies introduced their plans for a $250 million casino resort project in Louisiana. In November 2022, The Cordish Companies’ gaming division, Cordish Gaming Group, announced it would share ownership of its mobile sports betting license in Maryland with its employees.</p>
