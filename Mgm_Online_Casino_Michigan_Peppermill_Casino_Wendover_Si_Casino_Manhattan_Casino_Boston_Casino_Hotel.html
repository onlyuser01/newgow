<p>Gargantoonz review</p>
<p>Theme and Style</p>
<p>Gargantoonz is themed around a gang of adorable aliens.</p>
<p>Players will travel through a twinkling galaxy where they will meet some extraterrestrial friends. Each colorful creature will help players discover the secrets of the universe.</p>
<p>Fans of previous Garga franchise slots will particularly appreciate this incarnation.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The soundtrack of Gargantoonz has an 80s vibe, bringing to mind retro sci-fi films. The Gargantoonz themselves occasionally make cooing noises that add to their cuteness.</p>
<p>Behind the reels, players will see a cartoon spacescape with many sparkling stars. This creates an enchanting atmosphere and establishes the Gargantoonz alien status.</p>
<p>The stars of this slot are the Gargantoonz themselves who come in a range of colors. Each little creature has a welcoming smile that makes them immediately endearing. Some have one eye while others sport spikes and horns.</p>
<p>Beside the reels, a sleeping Gargantoon can be found in a glass chamber. Players will feel curious to find out how their alien technology works.</p>
<p>Overall, the soundtrack and animation create a playful, extraterrestrial world.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Gargantoonz is a seven-reel, seven-row slot.</p>
<p>Wins are awarded for landing clusters of at least 5 matching symbols. Matching symbols must be connected horizontally or vertically.</p>
<p>The maximum win for this slot is 7,000x the player’s total bet.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>Gargantoonz has five Wild symbols which substitute for all symbols.</p>
<p>During each round, a one-eyed symbol is selected at random to fluctuate. When fluctuating symbols form winning combinations, 1-2 Quantum Wilds will appear where the symbol disappears.</p>
<p>During non-winning rounds, 4-8 Quantum Wilds can be added to the reels at random.</p>
<p>Winning combinations have the ability to charge a special charger when no Experiments are active. It takes 20 symbols in total to charge the charger in this state.</p>
<p>After the charger has been filled, an Experiment is chosen at random to become active. If this Experiment is successful, another Experiment begins. This continues until all 3 Experiments are finished. However, the sequence ends if an Experiment is not successful.</p>
<p>Experiments consist of special selections of Wilds appearing on the reels and enhancing winning combinations.</p>
<p>Every successful Experiment also charges the Gargantoon charger, prompting the Gargantoon to evolve. The Gargantoon charger begins with a multiplier of 1x that increases by 1 with experiment charges.</p>
<p>When players achieve 3 successful Experiments, the Gargantoonz feature begins. During this feature, Gargantoon Wilds have the ability to merge and become extra large. These Gargantoon Wilds also have associated multipliers.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.20%, slightly above our yardstick for an average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.10 up to a maximum of $/£/€100 per spin.</p>
<p>High volatility makes this slot a good match for our preferred slot machine strategies. We suggest pursuing the highest volatility possible when selecting slots.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We recommend this high RTP, high volatility, alien-themed slot.</p>
<p>Fans of this franchise will especially adore the selection of endearing alien creatures, as well as the selection of bonuses.</p>
<p>Mathematically-minded players will find the decent RTP and impressive volatility appealing.</p>
