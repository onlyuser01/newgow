    <h1>La Cabana Beach Resort Casino Jackpot Party Casino Login Larchwood Casino Cimarron Casino Perkins Ok</h1>

<p>The Yolo Group sports betting and technology company is deepening its roots in the United Kingdom and the country’s topflight soccer</p>
<p>This is possible through a new partnership between Sportsbet.io and Newcastle United, which is currently competing in the Premier League, the country’s highest soccer tier. The partners have agreed to collaborate over the next several years and bring sports fans closer to the action through incisive content, analytics, and various incentives to place a wager.</p>
<p>Innovating the Fan Experience Together</p>
<p>The partnership was well received by the club’s chief commercial officer, Peter Silverstone, who hailed Sportsbet.io’s track record as a proven innovator and a company that loves sports and focuses on developing worthwhile experiences. Silverstone said:</p>
<p>Sportsbet.io is a digital innovator and shares the club’s desire to unlock new ways of engaging with supporters and those who love sport. Newcastle CCO Peter Silverstone</p>
<p>Silverstone further noted that Sportsbet.io brought distinct digital expertise that will help the club strengthen its reach and pull with fans. He also noted that the two organizations have already collaborated successfully in the past and that Sportsbet.io had a strong reputation for engaging with fans and coming up with innovative ways to connect with audiences.</p>
<p>Yolo Group founder Tim Heath was similarly receptive and welcoming of the partnership. Heath said that the new collaboration was yet another milestone for both companies. It’s an incredible opportunity to connect with all fans of the team globally.</p>
<p>“We share a common vision to push the boundaries of digital innovation in the sports industry and we are thrilled to work hand in hand with the club to create unforgettable moments for these dedicated supporters worldwide,” Heath added.</p>
<p>The official release of the partnership does not mention logos or branding, and it comes at a time when the public’s opinion of alliances between soccer clubs and sports betting platforms is not favorable. The government in the United Kingdom is expected to pass a complete ban on gambling firm logos displayed on player shirts in the next couple of years.</p>
<p>This has not dissuaded many prominent operators from pursuing gambling partnerships with established soccer teams in the United Kingdom, however, as indicated in a recent report by Caytoo.</p>
