    <h1>Casino Casino Hotel Casino Albuquerque Cool Cat Casino Candy Land Casino San Diego Casino Monaco vs</h1>

<p>The Derby de la Mediterranée between Monaco and Marseille is on the program this coming Sunday. Our prediction is that this is going to be a real barnburner. The reason isn’t just that the two clubs are rivals from the south of France. It’s also because both teams are playing terrific soccer in the 2022-23 season.</p>
<p>Both teams have 27 points right now, each with an 8-3-3 record after 14 rounds. Marseille is sitting in fourth place in the French Ligue 1, while Monaco is just one place below. The reason for that is that L’OM have a (slightly) better score differential – they are 23-11 this season, while Monaco is 27-18.</p>

<p>Monaco Looking for Their Fourth Straight Win</p>
<p>Monaco’s form this season has been streaky. They had periods of disappointing performances, as well as some with brilliant results. Right now, they’re surging on a fantastic run of three straight victories, three of which happened in the French Ligue 1.</p>
<p>This team’s strongest weapon this season has been their offense. So far, they’ve put away a total of 27 goals, which is almost 2.0 goals per game on average in Ligue 1. What’s interesting is that 12 of their 22 first-team outfielders have scored at least one league goal so far.</p>
<p>Their top scorer is Breel Embolo with seven goals, followed by Wissam Ben Yedder with five. Monaco’s player with the most assists in the 2022-23 Ligue 1 is left-back Caio Henrique.</p>
<p>Marseille’s Roster Looks Strongest in a While</p>
<p>Olympique de Marseille is a team with huge ambitions for the 2022-23 season. And their ambitions are justified. This team has a really good roster this season, with at least one goal player for every position on the pitch.</p>
<p>Their biggest star is Alexis Sanchez, the former Barcelona and Arsenal forward. He’s also their top-scorer, but in our opinion, the offense isn’t Marseille’s best section. Instead, this team is much stronger in the midfield and defense.</p>
<p>In the central part of the pitch, Marseille have two French internationals who will compete at the 2022 World Cup – Matteo Guendouzi and Jordan Veretout.</p>
<p>Their defense seems even stronger, with players like Leonardo Balerdi, Sead Kolasinac, Chancel Mbemba, and Nuno Tavares. The evidence of how good these guys have been in the defense is that Marseille have conceded just 11 goals in 14 Ligue 1 games. Only PSG and Lens have conceded fewer goals so far.</p>
<p>Monaco vs Marseille Prediction</p>
<p>This is going to be a clash between a great offense (Monaco) and a great defense (Marseille). So, which soccer philosophy will prevail on Sunday? We think neither. Instead, this game looks destined to finish in a tie.</p>
<p>Picks: Monaco and Marseille to draw; under 2.5 goals</p>
