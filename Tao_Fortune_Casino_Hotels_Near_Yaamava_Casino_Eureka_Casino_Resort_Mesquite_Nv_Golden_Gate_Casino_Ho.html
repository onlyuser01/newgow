<p>The European Gaming and Betting Association (EGBA) published the findings from a new report by the European Commission. According to the report, a significant reduction in the unintentional placement of gambling advertisements on websites that infringe intellectual property rights (IPR) has been achieved due to an industry-led memorandum of understanding (MoU).</p>
<p>The MoU on online advertising and intellectual property rights was published back in 2018, seeking to limit advertising on websites that infringe copyright or disseminate counterfeit goods. The voluntary agreement signed by different industry associations which represent major advertising sectors in Europe is facilitated and coordinated by the European Commission.</p>
<p>Effectiveness through Awareness</p>
<p>The European Commission found that the MoU created extra awareness among brands that were likely to end up advertising on IPR-infringing websites. The review on the effectiveness of the MoU outlined a 12% reduction of the share of total advertising for European businesses on IPR-infringing websites. For the gambling sector, including all members of EGBA, the report found the decrease for the reported period was even bigger, 20%.</p>
<p>EGBA, which recently published a new Code of Conduct for operators, welcomed the report findings and expressed its content at the significant progress achieved by its members and other major industry brands which efforts resulted in the reduction of unintentional placement of advertising on such websites.</p>
<p>“EGBA welcomes the progress made by EGBA members and other major gambling brands in significantly reducing the unintentional placement of their advertising on IPR-infringing websites and is pleased that major online gambling companies are playing a central role in EU efforts to crack down on IPR infringement.” Maarten Haijer, Secretary General, EGBA</p>
<p>EGBA continues to be fully committed to the promotion of responsible advertising in the online gambling sector of the continent, seeking to be at the forefront of all initiatives led by the European Commission related to online advertising and IPR infringement.</p>
<p>“Most reputable companies do not intend to advertise on IPR-infringing websites, but it happens and is difficult to control, and EGBA acknowledges that remedial action is needed to prevent it. That is why we have been actively engaging with the European Commission and other stakeholders to take action and are pleased those efforts are beginning to bear fruit.” Maarten Haijer, Secretary General, EGBA</p>
<p>Gambling Sector Relies on EGBA</p>
<p>Being the single gambling sector association representative in the MoU, EGBA sees its continuous efforts in promoting and educating its members and the wider industry about the principles in the MoU as key in the achieved reduction in IPR-infringing advertising in the sector.</p>
<p>“EGBA is committed to promoting responsibility and driving standards in Europe’s online gambling sector and we encourage other companies to join us – and be part of the solution, not the problem – by adhering to responsibility initiatives such as the MoU. This initiative proves that greater cooperation at EU-level can benefit the sector and how it is able to respond to the challenges it faces, including on advertising.” Maarten Haijer, Secretary General, EGBA</p>
<p>The success behind the MoU as outlined by the European Commission’s report, highlighted the importance of cooperation among various stakeholders at EU-level, and the benefits involved in the prevention of IPR online infringement for right owners, platform and industry trade associations, advertising companies, intermediaries and affiliates.</p>
