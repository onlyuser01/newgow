    <h1>Ramona Casino Emerald Casino Hardrock Casino Tampa Sweeps Coins Casinos Best Reno Casinos Tim Howard</h1>

<p>The joint venture of Entain and MGM Resorts International, BetMGM, expanded its roster of brand ambassadors on Tuesday. The company revealed it selected Tim Howard, the famous US soccer star as its new celebrity brand ambassador.</p>
<p>As a brand ambassador with BetMGM, Howard will participate in different activations in-person, as well as online. He will engage with BetMGM customers and MGM Rewards members and participate in appearances on social media, as well as TV and radio spots around the US.</p>
<p>To celebrate the new addition and coinciding with the planned 2022 international soccer events, BetMGM also will launch free-to-play games and special incentives. The company will introduce offers for new customers, existing customers, as well as two free-to-play games.</p>
<p>New customers that sign up during the 2022 tournament can benefit from a risk-free bet of up to $1,000, according to a statement released by BetMGM. What's more, new customers who place a $10 wager on their first game and a goal is scored will be awarded $200 in free bets.</p>
<p>Besides exclusive offers for new customers, BetMGM vowed to introduce different incentives for existing clients. Those include daily odds boosts and tokens, as well as risk-free one-game-parlay wagers, among other offers available during the tournament.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the two free-to-play games are called Tim Howard's Shootout Challenge and $250,000 Bracket. The $250,000 Bracket will give players an opportunity to win a $250,000 grand prize by predicting a perfect bracket correctly. According to BetMGM, if there is no one that predicts the perfect bracket, the user with the most accurate bracket will be awarded $50,000 within the free-to-enter competition.</p>
<p>Tim Howard's Shootout Challenge is the other free-to-play game which according to the company will give BetMGM players "the opportunity to face off against the iconic American goalie in a shootout." The company explained that the new game guarantees different prizes for the consumers.</p>
<p>Matt Prevost, BetMGM's Chief Revenue Officer, commented saying: "Tim Howard's performances on the pitch thrilled a generation of U.S. soccer fans." Moreover, he added: "With Tim's support, we will bring a similar level of excitement to our customers through various games and interactive opportunities."</p>
<p>Sharing his excitement, Howard added: "America's excitement for soccer is at a fever pitch and I can't wait to take it to the next level with BetMGM, offering new ways for fans to get engaged in the game." Last but not least, he explained that BetMGM is currently a leading sports betting operator and pointed out that he is proud to join its team just ahead of the launch of some of the most-anticipated sports events.</p>
