<p>Crown Resorts on Trial: Australian Federal Officials to Testify in Corruption Investigation</p>

<p>Australia’s anti-corruption watchdog is to quiz current and former federal government officials at a series of public hearings next week as part of its investigation into the “visas for high rollers” scandal involving Crown Resorts.</p>

<p>Among them will be Roman Quaedvlieg, a former Australian Border Force commissioner who was fired from his position last year for corruption unrelated to the Crown probe.</p>
<p>Quaedvlieg has alleged in interviews with Australian media that he was lobbied by senior lawmakers to “smooth out” border security processes for Crown’s VIP players, so they could “land on a private jet at Melbourne airport, receive the minimal amount of clearances, put them in cars, get them into the casino and spending money.”</p>
<p>Arms Dealer Blew $6 Million</p>
<p>The Age, The Sydney Morning Herald and the Nine network’s 60 Minutes program have accused Crown Resorts of having untoward relationships with triad-affiliated junket operators, and of spiriting Chinese criminals into the country via visa loopholes.</p>
<p>One such high roller may have been the Indonesian businessman Joseph Wong Kiia Tai, who the United Nations has accused of dealing arms to former Liberian despot Charles Taylor.</p>
<p>According to documents seen by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), Kiia Tai was allowed to lose over A$6 million ($4.1 million) at Crown’s Melbourne and Perth properties, despite being the subject of UN sanctions at the time, which included a travel ban.</p>
<p>‘Mr Chinatown’</p>
<p>The Department of Home Affairs (DHA) has said it had an agreement with Crown to “facilitate quick visa processing of short-stay visas,” as it did with many companies that were major contributors to the Australian economy.</p>
<p>But the watchdog, the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity (ACLEI), is looking into whether anyone at the DHA or the Australian Border Force conspired with Crown Resorts to fast-track criminals into the country.</p>
<p>It will also examine how Border Force official Andrew Ure came to be moonlighting as a bodyguard to a wealthy junket operator called Tom Zhou – known as “Mr. Chinatown” — who worked with Crown Resorts and is wanted by Interpol for serious criminal conduct.</p>
<p>Zhou has been charged by Chinese authorities with major corporate fraud, and is mentioned in civil cases in China as having used extortion and violence against business associates.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Crown Resorts claims the media reports are “sensationalized” and “deceitful,” and has said the public hearings will be a chance to offer its perspective.</p>
<p>Crown notes that junket operators are independent third parties that deal with the casino industry across the world, not just Crown properties. The company said it complies with global anti-money laundering directives and denied that it has ever “sought to circumvent visa requirements or compromise any process of identification or verification for immigration purposes.”</p>
