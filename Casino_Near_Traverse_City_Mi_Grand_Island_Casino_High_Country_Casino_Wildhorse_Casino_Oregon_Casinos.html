    <h1>Casino Near Traverse City Mi Grand Island Casino High Country Casino Wildhorse Casino Oregon Casinos</h1>

<p>Leading technology-driven sports wagering monitoring company US Integrity (USI) has decided to hit the refresh button on its 2018 partnership with the Pac-12 collegiate athletic conference. The two will continue to promote the integrity of college conference athletic competitions in the context of the quickly expanding market for sports betting in the US. The Pac-12 Conference is dedicated to creating the nextgen of leaders by promoting the well-being of student-athletes and excellence in athletics and academics.</p>
<p>USI to Provide the Pac-12 Conference with Integrity Monitoring Services</p>
<p>According to the terms of the expanded partnership, USI will keep offering its integrity-monitoring services to the Pac-12 Conference with the help of its dashboard used to find irregular patterns in dozens of sets of data. USI’s co-founder and chief executive officer Matthew Holt explained that the company’s mission will continue to be to offer “conflict-free, best-in-class insights and compliance solutions” to their clients. Hold also expressed their eagerness to keep working with the “exceptional team” at Pac-12, adding that the partnership will guarantee integrity in sports betting while strengthening the one-of-a-kind proprietary tools used to detect anomalies.</p>
<p>The Pac-12 Conference’s Impressive Competitive Success</p>
<p>Also known as the “Conference of Champions,” the Pac-12 Conference reunites some of the most iconic and prestigious universities and athletics programs in the country. The list includes the University of Arizona, the University of California, Arizona State University, Berkeley University, and the University of Colorado Boulder, among others. Ever since its expansion to 12 teams more than a decade ago, the league has scooped up 100+ National College Athletic Association team championships, reaching the 544 all-time mark. The Pac-12 Conference</p>
<p>owns and manages Pac-12 Networks, which is the Conference’s sports media company responsible for producing and distributing 850 live sporting events every season. Their networks also provide digital content with the help of online platforms like the Pac-12 Insider, Pac-12 official athletics sites, Pac-12.com, or the Pac-12 Now app.</p>
<p>Pac’12’s general counsel Maggy Carlyle expressed their excitement for renewing their partnership with USI, speaking about their “pivotal role” in helping them monitor sports betting, across all athletic competitions and programs.</p>
<p>With headquarters in New York and Las Vegas, USI has the support of important investors like Las Vegas Sands and SeventySix Capital while partnering with some of the greatest professional sports leagues and collegiate conferences in the country and a plethora of regulators and licensed operators. In October, USI announced it would be partnering with Saracen Casino for an integrity agreement.</p>
