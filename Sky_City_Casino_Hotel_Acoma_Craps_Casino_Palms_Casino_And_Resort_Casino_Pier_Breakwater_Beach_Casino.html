    <h1>Sky City Casino Hotel Acoma Craps Casino Palms Casino And Resort Casino Pier Breakwater Beach Casino</h1>

<p>I made two separate deposits minutes apart. One for $7.69 and the other for $7.62. I waited for several hours and checked the status on the Blockchain. Both transactions were confirmed and sent to my player wallet. Neither of which was credited. I reached out through chat support (Emma was my representative). I was told that it clearly stated in the T&amp;C's that any deposit under .0003500 BTC would be lost. Emma then said the deposits were eaten up by mining fees and I had no recourse to recoup my money and that they would not credit my account. Even though I could see clearly that the fees had not in fact eaten my deposits up and that the remaining funds were sent to my player wallet. I spent the next hour being told there was nothing they could do and then finally after I did some research online I requested a refund of my deposits. To which the response again was that the T&amp;C's clearly stated my money was permanently lost. I asked for my concern to be escalated and was told again that there was nothing I could do but that she has passed along my concerns to a manager who would reach out to me sometime in the next 24 hours. I tried to open a new chat hoping to speak to someone more helpful but Emma popped back on and stated that there were no more answers to my questions. When I asked for an official transcript of our conversations I was finally given an email. (I took screenshots either way of both conversations). I then asked what the procedure for a refund request was and was met with the answer once again "Don't Worry". I was told by Emma that she had already submitted my request to a manager but that refunds were not something offered for these instances and hopefully the manager could make me understand. My reply to this was that she had not addressed my question and that I simply wanted the information regarding making an official refund request. I was given a generic support email and told once again nothing could be done.</p>
