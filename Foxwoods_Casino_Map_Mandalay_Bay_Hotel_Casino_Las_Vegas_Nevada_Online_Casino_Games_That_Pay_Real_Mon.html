<p>CT Interactive and Vivelo24 have signed a content partnership that will see the operator benefit from the supplier’s titles. Vivelo24 is a leading brand in Mexico, and it will now offer its players a number of games by CT Interactive to local audiences.</p>
<p>CT Interactive is a company that has developed more than 200 games so far, with classic slots, dice slots, and cascading slots being just some of the available game genres that the supplier works on.</p>
<p>Popular game choices include Wizard Blizzard x5, Fruitata Wins, The Oldest Oak, Giraffe Wild, and others. The supplier has been building up its presence in the Latin American market over the past several months, with a range of similar partnerships, and notably with BetMexico.mx.</p>
<p>This new opportunity with Vivelo24 has been welcomed by CT Interactive Head of Business Development LatAm Diego Verano who said that the company was proud to collaborate with a noteworthy operator in the local market and further strengthen its presence in the market.</p>
<p>"We are so excited to expand our reach and provide Mexican players with our best games," Verano said. The news was similarly met by Vivelo24 Deputy Director Patricio Molloy who was similarly pleased with the opportunity.</p>
<p>He argued that CT Interactive is a company known for providing players with high-quality products and that Mexican crowds would appreciate the supplier’s portfolio. Molloy noted that Vivelo24 is similarly interested in developing its own product and brand in the local market.</p>
<p>CT Interactive is at SBC Summit Barcelona 2023, where the company is showcasing its products this week. The company has been working hard to expand its global reach not only in Latin America or Mexico, but also back in Europe where it has had successful launches in Italy, Serbia, Switzerland, and other interesting jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Overall, the past months have been very dynamic for CT Interactive, allowing the company to pursue new avenues and team up with established and trusted operators with a global pull and a strong base audience.</p>
