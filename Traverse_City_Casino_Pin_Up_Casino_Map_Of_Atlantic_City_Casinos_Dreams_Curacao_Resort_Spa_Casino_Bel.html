<p>Aspire Global, a provider of B2B solutions for the iGaming sector, including platform and content, has teamed up with Stakelogic Live, to offer partner brands the opportunity to further strengthen their live casino portfolio.</p>
<p>Stakelogic Live is one of the most recognizable names in the live casino gaming vertical, and as such – it’s a strong and reliable content partner to individual brands. Onboarding with the supplier’s games will now be made much easier thanks to Aspire Global, specifically for partners of the network.</p>
<p>The integration that will enable Stakelogic Live to inject its games into operators working with Aspire Global will be carried out by Pariplay, a powerful aggregator, supplier, and tech solutions company itself. This deal allows Stakelogic Live and Aspire Global to provide clients in some of the most heavily regulated jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom, Sweden, and Denmark with an outstanding and compliant-ready product.</p>
<p>Not only that, but the products will also be available to partners that are currently covered by a Maltese license and a permit from the Malta Gaming Authority. Stakelogic Lives has plenty to bring, from traditional live casino games to dedicated game shows that are truly outstanding in their own right.</p>
<p>Richard Walker, Head of Live Casino at Stakelogic Live spoke highly of this opportunity to see his company partner with Aspire Global. He hailed the opportunity to be teaming up with Aspire and bring the casino’s products to core markets such as Sweden, Denmark, and the United Kingdom, all of which are of particular importance to the company.</p>
<p>Walker called Stakelogic’s live portfolio as consisting of must-have products and games and assured that the reception of the company’s products would be strong with target audiences and operators.</p>
<p>"At Stakelogic Live, our mission is to become the number one provider in the live casino space and integrations with partners such as this with Aspire show we are well on our way to achieving that goal," he concluded.</p>
<p>Stakelogic Live has been reaping many successes in the past months, signing particularly live casino-focused alliances. One such was struck with Circus in the Netherlands, with Stakelogic Live agreeing to deliver a dedicated live casino experience and offer distinct products for the operator’s audiences.</p>
<p>In terms of the company’s slot content, Stakelogic signed a partnership with Paddy Power Betfair in the United Kingdom, significantly expanding its clout.</p>
