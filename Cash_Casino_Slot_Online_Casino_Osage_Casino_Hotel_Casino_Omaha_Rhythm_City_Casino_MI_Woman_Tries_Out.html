    <h1>Cash Casino Slot Online Casino Osage Casino Hotel Casino Omaha Rhythm City Casino MI Woman Tries Out</h1>

<p>A lucky woman from Warren, Michigan, has won a $390,000 jackpot playing Lucky for Life. What makes this win so special is the fact that this was the first time she ever played the game.</p>
<p>Shayla Kauflin, 39, explained that she bought the Lucky for Life ticket on a whim. She was browsing the Michigan Lottery website, seeking to purchase Powerball tickets online. While looking around, she saw the Lucky for Life game listed. Telling herself “Why not?” Kauflin bought $10 worth of tickets.</p>
<p>She logged into her lottery account the next day and was surprised to see that she had won a $390,000 prize. In an interview with MLive, she said:</p>
<p>I logged in to my Lottery account the next day to see if I’d won anything, and when I saw $390,000 pending, I started screaming, crying, and freaking out! I called my husband to tell him how much I’d won, and he was concerned at first because he thought something was wrong. Shayla Kauflin, lottery winner</p>
<p>Kauflin opted to receive $390,000 as a one-time lump-sum, instead of $25,000 a year for 20 years.</p>
<p>Kauflin told reporters that she plans to celebrate by booking a Disney vacation for her whole family. The woman plans to invest the rest of the sum.</p>
<p>The woman admitted that the feeling of having won such a sum is indescribable and that she feels like “the weight of the world has been taken off her shoulders.” She admitted that this sum is not enough to change the world but it’s definitely enough to change her world.</p>
