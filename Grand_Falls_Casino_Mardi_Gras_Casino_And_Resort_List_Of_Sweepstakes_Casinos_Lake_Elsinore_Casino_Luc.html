<p>Play’n GO, a leading supplier of online slots, has struck a strategic deal with the gambling juggernaut BetMGM. Per the agreement, Play’n GO will power the operator’s offering in New Jersey with its acclaimed suite of exciting slot games.</p>
<p>BetMGM to Offer Play’n GO Content to NJ Players</p>
<p>Play’n GO agreed to provide BetMGM with a premium selection of the best slots it has to offer. As a result, the operator will be able to engage clients in New Jersey with supreme titles, including both classics and fresh releases. This means that players in the Garden State will get to enjoy many engaging games such as Ankh of Anubis, Cat Wilde and the Lost Chapter, Cash Pump and Blinged, among others.</p>
<p>Both parties are excited about the agreement. Because of that, the two companies have planned to launch Play’n GO’s titles in other states as well. BetMGM hopes to roll out its new partner’s titles in Michigan next.</p>
<p>The deal will help BetMGM engage its customers with many exciting experiences, provided by Play’n GO. The studio, on the other hand, will expand its US reach as it seeks to reinforce its footprint in North America.</p>
<p>The Studio Is Excited about Its NA Expansion</p>
<p>Play’n GO’s chief commercial officer, Magnus Olsson, commented on the launch in New Jersey. He noted that the company has been in the United States for just a few weeks but is already enjoying a lot of attention from local players.</p>
<p>Olsson said that the foray into the US is a “hugely exciting time” for the company’s journey to North America. Play’n GO recently appeared at G2E for the first time and is already breaking ground in New Jersey and Ontario. Olsson concluded that his company aims to become the casino entertainment supplier of choice of many regulated jurisdictions in the region.</p>
<p>Speaking about the agreement with BetMGM in particular, Olsson lauded BetMGM as “one of the most trusted names in US gaming” and a company that “needs no introduction.” The CCO added that he is optimistic about the company’s future in the state.</p>
<p>This partnership gives a large New Jersey audience access to some of the most popular online slots in the world, including Book of Dead. Magnus Olsson, CCO, Play’n GO</p>
<p>Play’n GO is already one of the biggest suppliers of slots in Europe and Latin America. The company is currently looking to replicate this success in the highly-lucrative US market as well. To that end, Play’n GO keeps on releasing hit titles and signing deals with major operators.</p>
<p>In September, Play’n GO launched ImmorTails of Egypt, a cat-themed slot with an Egyptian vibe.</p>
