    <h1>Doubleu Casino On Facebook Mt Airy Resort Casino New Casino Las Vegas Pa Casino Hollywood Casino 400</h1>

<p>Hi I would like to make a complaint about this casino and see if you can help me retrieve my funds please for the amount of 700 euro. I Have included as much information as possible please let me know if you need anything else. Back in 2017 I requested for my account to be permantley closed as I was having gambling issues - this was confirmed by the casino. I then recently reached out to them to ask then when my account had been closed and they told me that my account was reopened on the 14/8/2021 I have no idea why this was done - I never requested it at all and this should never have happened. I then went on to deposit over 700 euro - as a gambler this was like a wide door being opened up to me which never should have happened. I then reached out and asked for help and they told me that they was unable to help me and that my account was re opened after a year? When I asked them why this happened they told me my self exclusion had lapsed on the 14/8/2021 and that my account was re opened simply from logging in. They also said that I had re opened my account with William Hill - which is also untrue and I can get proof of this also. When I told them that this goes against their terms they again was unable to help me There terms and conditions and shown in the attachment states that if a customer wants to end a self exclusion they need to first contact customer support to ask for this to happen. (It is point 8.9.2 - also stats there would have been a 7 day waiting period) I NEVER contacted them to get my account re opened at all - ever! Please can you help me with this - this should never have been allowed to happen - I done everything correctly on my side.</p>
<p>I can provide all screenshots and information if needed.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
