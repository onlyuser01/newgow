    <h1>New Casino Near Me Casino In Atmore Alabama Harrington Raceway And Casino Casino Wheel Casino Vancou</h1>

<p>The thing about the Hard Rock is it’s not just about filling the position, it’s about putting rock stars in the position, president Iafrate said</p>
<p>Hard Rock prepares for the launch of its new Rockford property in August and announced it plans to hire 400 more people.</p>
<p>As reported by the Rock River Current, an Illinois and Wisconsin-focused news outlet, Hard Rock Casino Rockford has many available management positions in food and beverage service, casino operations, transportation, retail, warehouse and other key areas of its operation. The company offers supervisor salaries of over $50,000 a year and manager salaries of over $70,000 a year.</p>
<p>In addition, a multitude of positions in casino operators are available. The company is looking for drivers, cashiers, security personnel, technicians and dealers, among others, offering starting pay of $18 an hour for non-tipped workers and $10-16 an hour for tipped staff.</p>
<p>A variety of other employees, such as chefs, cooks, bartenders, servers and hosts, among others, are also needed.</p>
<p>Hard Rock Casino Rockford is preparing to host workforce readiness workshops next year and run hiring events in the summer of 2024. Management positions will be officially posted in March. Supervisor positions, on the other hand, will be posted in April. Other job opportunities will become available in May.</p>
<p>Hard Rock Casino Rockford Wants to Hire “Rock Stars”</p>
<p>Hard Rock Casino Rockford’s president, Geno Iafrate, commented on the company’s workforce needs, saying that “the thing about the Hard Rock is it’s not just about filling the position, it’s about putting rock stars in the position.”</p>
<p>Iafrate admitted that hiring 400 people is no easy task, which is why it is never too early to start reaching out to the community. Through community connection events, the company will get the opportunity to meet the right people and find the exact “rock stars” it is looking for.</p>
<p>We want world-class hospitality folks. That doesn’t mean you have to have 25 years of hospitality experience. You have to have the right heart. You have to have a servant’s heart to work in the entertainment and in the hospitality space. We’ll teach you everything else. Geno Iafrate, president, Hard Rock Casino Rockford</p>
<p>Hard Rock is already employing 350 people at its A Hard Rock Opening Act property, a temporary venue where people can play before work on the permanent Hard Rock Casino Rockford is complete. The permanent casino will thus have a total of 750 employees.</p>
<p>The final property will sport a spectacular 65,000 square feet gaming area that will be packed with 1,300 slots, 44 live gaming tables, 6 poker tables and a sportsbook. In addition to that, Hard Rock Casino Rockford will have a variety of food and beverage locations, as well as a 1,600-seat entertainment hall.</p>
