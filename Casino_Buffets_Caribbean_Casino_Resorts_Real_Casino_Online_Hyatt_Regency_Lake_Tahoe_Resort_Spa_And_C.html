<p>The global holding operating multiple gambling and sports betting brands, Kindred Group, boosted its Swedish responsible gambling efforts by announcing a new initiative.</p>
<p>SGC’s Local Version Takes Place in Stockholm</p>
<p>The company said Friday that it is hosting a local version of its Sustainable Gambling Conference (SGC) at its office located in Stockholm, the largest city and capital of Sweden. This marks the first such local version of Kindred’s conference and the main theme for the event is “A sustainable gambling industry for the future.”</p>
<p>The event which is taking place today seeks to discuss how the gambling industry can overcome challenges related to problem gambling. This, according to the event organizer will be achieved via improved collaboration between gambling operators, regulators and the media, among other stakeholders.</p>
<p>Kindred revealed that Members of the Parliament will also participate in the event and “give their view on the development of the gambling market, almost four years after the Swedish reregulation.” Additionally, the company revealed that NGOs and sports movements will also join the event and present new possibilities for responsible gambling and player protection.</p>
<p>The new local event comes after last month, the main SGC wrapped up in Amsterdam. The theme of this year’s event was “An honest conversation” and it marked the seventh such conference.</p>
<p>Kindred Is a Leader in Responsible Gambling</p>
<p>Pär Nygårds, Kindred Group’s head of corporate affairs in Sweden, pointed out that the company is committed to offering responsible entertainment for its customers. With that in mind, he added that the new local SGC will further boost those efforts and contribute toward making a more sustainable gambling market in Sweden. Finally, Nygårds said: “Taking a local perspective is important in this regard, as we come closer to each market’s specific conditions.”</p>
<p>“We as an individual operator of course have a big responsibility to provide a safe and reliable environment for our customers.“ Pär Nygårds, head of corporate affairs Sweden at Kindred Group</p>
<p>Jonas Daag, Kindred’s general manager in Sweden, added that he is proud to see the local version of the SGC in Stockholm. He pointed out that the collaboration will bring together representatives from different authorities, sports and media organizations, as well as other stakeholders within the industry. Last but not least, Daag said that the local collaborations within the event are “crucial for the development of a sustainable gambling market.”</p>
<p>“Hosting the first local version of the Sustainable Gambling Conference here in Stockholm is something I am very proud of.“ Jonas Daag, general manager Sweden at Kindred Group</p>
<p>The recent local initiative boosts further Kindred’s position as a leader in responsible gambling. In fact, the company has an ongoing plan that seeks to remove revenue from problem gambling. Labeled as a “journey towards zero,” Kindred aims at having zero percent revenue from problem gambling by the end of 2023.</p>
