    <h1>Casinos Cerca Play For Real Money Casino Casin Three Rivers Casino Florence Barton S 93 Casino Jackp</h1>

<p>I opened an account at the advice of my daughter and niece who live with me and told that I could only use one bonus or they wouldn't give me my withdrawl if I won anything. I truly never expected to win at all and never dreamed I would win 990.00 which after the 20 dollar transfer fee would have put my gtotal deposited winnings 970.00 USD. I thought my prayers had been ansered I hadn't used more then the one deposit I had finished the required playthrugh I emailed the documents that were requested did everyday by the book and guidelines they had for my deposit. I waited just over 10 business days before I longed in to find that my withdrawl had been canceled. They didn't just put my winnings back they just took it and told me that I couldn't get my winnings because my daughter and neice had accounts and lived with me. WTF seriously we don't have the same full name and neither of them had sent any papers or ID and things of that nature in I do remember that my neice had won a couple hundred and was told that her winnings were forfit because she had used multiple bonuses before winning. Which was how she knew to warn me to not do that. I didn't break any of their posted policies or rules. And completed the required playthrough and guidelines for the bonus I used. They are complete liars and should just tell people it is just for fun and they don't intend to pay you if you win but will continue too send email after email begging you to deposit your hard earned money. If I can't trust you uphold your site to pay me what I had won fair and squre why would I then give you money. I think it is the worst kind of why to do business you are more than happy to take any and all money deposited and lost or and or but refuse to play winnings without any reason other than three people living together having all played on your casino website.</p>
