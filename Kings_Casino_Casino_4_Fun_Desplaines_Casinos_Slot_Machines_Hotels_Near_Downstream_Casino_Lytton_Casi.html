<p>On April 21, 2023, tribal police uncovered the dealer's purported misconduct following a pit manager's observation of suspicious card handling</p>
<p>A baccarat dealer at Mohegan Sun, Yu Wen Fu, 64, faces charges of manipulating games, resulting in a $124,000 loss for the casino.</p>
<p>Dealer Accused of Prearranging Cards, Resulting in Massive Casino Losses</p>
<p>Tribal police discovered Fu’s alleged malpractice on April 21, 2023, after a pit manager observed him handling cards suspiciously. Surveillance cameras captured Fu setting up the deck before a specific player, Haoen Jiang, approached, reported Connecticut media outlet The Day.</p>
<p>Rather than adhering to the standard procedure of washing cards on the table, Fu arranged them in a specific order, allowing him to deal with prearranged cards when Jiang played. Police investigation revealed a pattern of collusion between Fu and Jiang, with the casino’s losses totaling $124,260 between March 29 and April 20, 2023.</p>
<p>In the game of baccarat, where players bet on the outcome of the dealer or player’s hand reaching closest to nine, Fu allegedly signaled the appearance of the nine by strategically placing face cards in the deck. Surveillance footage tracked the chips paid out on each hand, determining the extent of the winnings.</p>
<p>Upon questioning, Jiang denied collaboration with Fu but had Fu’s cell phone number on his device. Jiang claimed their last conversation was about concert tickets and was subsequently ejected from the casino, facing no charges.</p>
<p>Baccarat Dealer Maintains Innocence Amidst Larceny Charges</p>
<p>Fu, suspended pending investigation, maintained his innocence, asserting that cards accidentally turned face up during the wash, and he merely fixed them without rearranging them for personal gain.</p>
<p>Arrested on November 15, Fu faces charges of first-degree larceny, second-degree larceny (four counts), and third-degree larceny. Released on a $25,000 bond, Fu was arraigned in New London’s Part A court on January 8 for serious crimes.</p>
