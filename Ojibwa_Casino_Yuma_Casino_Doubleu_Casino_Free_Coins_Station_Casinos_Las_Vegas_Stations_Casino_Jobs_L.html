    <h1>Ojibwa Casino Yuma Casino Doubleu Casino Free Coins Station Casinos Las Vegas Stations Casino Jobs L</h1>

<p>I'm having a problem with verification. My account number with LEON is 78453149.</p>
<p>I completed their automatic KYC verification and received an email stating that the verification went through successfully.</p>
<p>Upon receiving the email confirming my successful KYC verification, they sent out an email requiring me to submit pictures of the bank card used for transactions. I complied.</p>
<p>Subsequently, they requested me to submit a picture confirming my residential address. This step had not been asked for in the previous step, but I obliged nonetheless. LEON, however, rejected this, stating that it wasn't sent in a PDF format. However, they hadn't specified any file format in their initial email, and a picture of this sort was also part of the original KYC verification process which was approved.</p>
<p>I resubmitted the requested material, this time voluntarily enclosing an additional picture of my passport. Surprisingly, they asked me to submit a picture of myself holding both my passport and a piece of paper with the current date and company title, and to also include a screenshot showing my account. This requirement was not mentioned in their original instructions. They also stated that they had attached an example picture, but there was no file attached to the message.</p>
<p>I once again complied and sent in the files. However, they sent out another message stating that the passport was unclear and not sufficiently visible in the picture. This is perplexing considering the difficulty I had trying to get a clear image using an ordinary mobile phone with so many objects that need to be clearly visible, and also taking into account that I had already sent in pictures of my passport during the initially approved automatic verification and voluntarily after previous messages.</p>
<p>I have available screen captures and images that exceed the 5MB limit for attachments.</p>
