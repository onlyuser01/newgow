<p>The Registrar of the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario has issued new enforcement action against companies in Ontario over various breaches</p>
<p>The Registrar stated that it operates in the public interest and that it strives to maintain a safe and responsible internet gambling environment. As a result, the regulator has served BV Gaming Limited and Fitzdares Canada Limited with Notices of a Monetary Penalty for a total of CA$30,000.</p>
<p>AGCO Remains Committed to Keeping Gambling Clean in Ontario</p>
<p>The penalty was served for alleged infractions of the Standards for Internet Gaming, the watchdog clarified. This comes amid a heightened debate in Canada over the proliferation of sports gambling advertisements and a call for tougher action on the industry, the way it promotes its products, and an overall increase in customer protection standards.</p>
<p>In the specific cases concerning the two companies, the Registrar alleges that the operators took wagers on Ontario Hockey League, Quebec Major Junior Hockey League, and Western Hockey League during the 2022-23 season.</p>
<p>The regulator has explained that these wagers are prohibited as they target minor league sports, and the three major junior hockey leagues specifically. AGCO COO Dave Philips has clarified the matter and said:</p>
<p>As the regulator of Ontarioâ€™s sports betting industry, the AGCO is resolved to maintain the integrity of sports betting which, in turn, may serve to protect the integrity of sport. Dave Philips, COO, AGCO</p>
<p>He reiterated that there is a prohibition in place to offer bets on minor league sports, as well as Canadian major junior hockey. Philips said that the regulator will continue to watch over the regulated market in Ontario as it seeks to establish a fairer industry for everyone.</p>
<p>More Needs to Be Done to Make the Industry a Safe Place</p>
<p>AGCO has been actively involved in bettering the regulated gambling market in the province, especially following its mass legalization and expansion for the private sector.</p>
<p>However, increased pressure from concerned parties, including politicians, has led the regulator to now look closely at advertising practices while continuing to pursue a tougher stance against individual companies as well, as indicated by the most recent action. Previously, AGCO hit with penalties three iGaming operators over various breaches.</p>
