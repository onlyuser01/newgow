    <h1>Orion Stars Casino Hard Rock Casino Fl Casino No Deposit Bonus Marriott San Juan Resort And Stellari</h1>

<p>Hello Tom√°s, thank you for helping me with my case, I proceed to answer your questions below:</p>
<p>Could you please indicate how long you have been a player at the casino and when exactly your account was blocked?</p>
<p>Approximately 9 months ago, my account was blocked on June 6 of this year.</p>
<p>Did the casino specify which casino rules were violated?</p>
<p>There was no specification, despite the fact that I repeatedly demanded an explanation of the reason for the suspension. These are the exact words of your email sent."Your account has been disabled by our team after verifying inconsistencies in your account that are not allowed according to our terms and conditions."</p>
<p>What games did you play to build up your current casino balance? (slots, live games, multiplayer)</p>
<p>Live casino games.</p>
<p>Did you get your current balance with an active bonus?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Within hours of making my claim by this means, I receive an email from Bodog (minutes after writing my discharge) asking for my information to verify:</p>
<p>Dear. We need to confirm some of the information registered in your account profile, we request that you please send us the following documentation:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Photo of both sides of your identity document.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Selfie with your document in hand</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Photographs of the front and back of the registered cards.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It can be a screen print if it is a virtual card. In the event that the application does not allow it, it can be a photo of the cell phone screen or an account statement showing the deposit transaction on the web.</p>
<p>The photographs are requested to verify if you are the owner. You can hide the first numbers of the card, we only need to see the last 4 digits and your name.</p>
<p>Sincerely, Validation Team</p>
