    <h1>Casino Royal Caribbean Hard Rock Casino Jobs Free Play Online Casino Best Online Casino Slots Online</h1>

<p>Novibet closed my account with 16292,00 BRL there</p>
<p>They are saying I broke some rules 2.7, 2.8, 13, 14 and 17.</p>
<p>I read all of them and it makes no sense.</p>
<p>Firstly, all the money I have on my account is related to my DEPOSIT MONEY, there is no relation with any bonus. I received a bonus when i created my account and lost everything. Then I deposited again and made these profits.</p>
<p>Secondly, there is no multiple accounts. I sent all my personal documents and verified it (id, adress and selfie holding my id). The money was deposited from my personal bank account and I asked a withdrawal for my personal bank account as well.</p>
<p>I always accessed from my personal mobile phone.</p>
<p>The only exception was when I visited my friend Alisson and asked his permission to place a bet using his internet because my 4G signal was weak. It happened just ONE time.</p>
<p>Novibet closed my account and closed his account as well. There is no relation between my account and his, besides the fact that we are friends.</p>
<p>So because ONE time in life I accessed my account from a friendÂ´s house they will consider it as multiple accounts? The bets he placed are not the same I did.</p>
<p>I understand there are rules related to multiple accounts and bonus abuse, but its cleary not the case.</p>
<p>All my balance has no relation with bonus. I can send all my documents, payments sheets proofing the money came from my personal account and what else you need.</p>
<p>Its an absurd to close my account just because of it. If there were bonus involved, ok. But there is no bonus.</p>
<p>I hope you can help me to solve that, thanks</p>
