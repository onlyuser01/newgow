<p>A new initiative in Denmark is expected to lead research into gambling addiction and help develop a safer market for customers in the country. The research will be led by a new Danish Gambling Committee that will focus on the vertical and join forces with leading experts and researchers within the field.</p>
<p>The Danish Gambling Committee secured funding of DKK 12 million ($1.8 million) which will be vital for its research in the next three years. Leading gambling operators that have established their presence within the regulated gambling market in the country contributed to the funding which came in the form of a donation.</p>
<p>Among those companies are Danske Spil, Mr Green, Betsson Group, Kindred Group, as well as Spilnu.dk. It’s important to mention that all of the aforementioned gambling operators currently hold a license from the gambling authority in Denmark and this move reaffirms their commitment to responsible gambling.</p>
<p>Currently, the Danish gambling market is famous for being one of the most tightly regulated gambling markets in the world. Despite the regulations, the industry in the country has seen significant growth in the last decade and enjoyed a boost from online gambling.</p>
<p>While the growth of the gambling sector in Denmark is evident, research into responsible gambling and problem gambling wasn’t able to keep up with that pace. This is precisely where the efforts of the Danish Gambling Committee will be focused. The Committee is expected to focus on four prime areas. Those involve:</p>
<p>Treatment of problem gambling</p>
<p>Prevention of gambling harm especially within vulnerable groups such as young people and children</p>
<p>Prevention of gambling harm within the online vertical</p>
<p>Collecting valuable knowledge about problem gambling</p>
<p>Research Is Crucial for the Prevention of Problem Gambling</p>
<p>Kate Jacquerot, Danske Spil’s legal director in charge of responsible gambling, said that the company is delighted to support the creation of a gambling market in Denmark that is secure and safe. Moreover, she said Danske Spil is “happy to support the Danish Gambling Committee, where new independent research can play a key role in creating knowledge about how we best prevent and take care of gamblers, which show signs of addiction.”</p>
<p>“It is absolutely crucial for the Kindred Group that investment is made in increased research into the prevention and treatment of gambling addiction.“ Kim Olesen, general manager for Denmark and Italy at Kindred Group</p>
<p>Kim Olesen, Kindred Group’s general manager for Denmark and Italy, added that it is incredibly important for the company to invest in research that can prevent and treat problem gambling and addiction. This initiative resonates well with Kindred’s goal to reach zero revenue from problem gambling and the general manager explained that the company doesn’t want to benefit from people who have an “unhealthy relationship with gambling.” Finally, Olesen said that the efforts of the Danish Gambling Committee will help develop new ways for treating gambling addiction and prevent problem gambling.</p>
