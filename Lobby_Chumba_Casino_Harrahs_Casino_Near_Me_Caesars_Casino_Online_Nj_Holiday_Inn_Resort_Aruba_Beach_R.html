<p>ParlayBay, a newly set-up developer and supplier of sports betting games, has announced its inaugural partnership with an operator company. The company is teaming up with Ellmount Group in a bid to secure an entry into the sports and iGaming verticals, and ParlayBay’s products will be introduced throughout the group’s portfolio of brands.</p>
<p>ParlayBay’s STREAK, BOSS, GEKKO, CUT, and RUSH games will debut on a number of Ellmount’s websites, including Casinoroom.com, and will offer an alternative way to experience sports betting. ParlayBay has committed to a player-centric experience that is focused on achieving straightforward gameplay that comes with the depth and scalability of the experience.</p>
<p>While the company’s games are promoted as sports titles, they draw on the best features of the casino, social gaming, and sports betting experiences to provide a full-package product that offers a great user interface and gameplay to it.</p>
<p>Easy to Follow Gameplay and Rewarding Experience</p>
<p>ParlayBay’s products are focused on bursts of short rounds that make it easy for players to stay focused and enjoy the experience without straining themselves. ParlayBay expects that its re-buy, cashout, and leaderboards features, along with different social tools, will lead to a greater level of engagement and create a sense of community.</p>
<p>ParlayBay commercial manager William Lövqvist spoke about the significance of the partnership between the two companies, and why Ellmount Group would make a worthwhile first partner for the company:</p>
<p>“Ellmount Group is a renowned and respected operator that shares our vision for the future of sports betting and entertainment. We couldn’t think of a better partner to make our debut with and to show their players an innovative, fun, and engaging sports betting games product.” ParlayBay commercial manager William Lövqvist</p>
<p>Lövqvist feels confident that the games developed by ParlayBay are able to bring value to bettors and create experiences that they have not seen before. While this is the first partnership for ParlayBay, the company is determined to continue adding more solutions and content for partners and players to experience.</p>
<p>Innovation Much Needed in Sports Betting and Gaming</p>
<p>All new products are set to offer a “remarkable gaming experience” as per Lövqvist who is excited to see how the industry is going to react to ParlayBay’s products.</p>
<p>Ellmount Group CEO Claës af Burén welcomed the partnership and argued that there has been a lot of talk about innovating the experience in sports betting, but few options to do so:</p>
<p>“Online casino, and even more so sports betting, are in desperate need of innovation. Our customers deserve it, and we all need to find new and improved ways to engage with our customers.” Ellmount Group CEO Claës af Burén</p>
<p>The executive is confident that ParlayBay’s games are capable of delivering on a unique experience that intersects all important aspects of the gameplay. Becoming the company’s first operator partner is an important milestone for Ellmount Group as well, and something that the organization is proud of.</p>
<p>“ParlayBay steps up to the plate and delivers a much-needed game-changing experience,” af Burén concluded.</p>
