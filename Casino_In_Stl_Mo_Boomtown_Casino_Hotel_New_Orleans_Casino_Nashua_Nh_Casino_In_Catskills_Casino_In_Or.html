<p>The prominent gaming and sports betting brand has thumbed a new leaf with an upcoming game and the second installment of its “Winning is Undefeated” ad campaign</p>
<p>FanDuel Casino is working with IGT and the company’s Cleopatra game to now usher in a new era of Egyptian-themed fun with Fort Knox Cleopatra, the derivative and exclusive title that has been added to the casino’s own shopping windows and is designed to celebrate the feeling of victory.</p>
<p>A Campaign Designed to Celebrate the Feeling of Victory</p>
<p>The game will be exclusively available at the casino in the coming weeks thanks to IGT PlayDigital and it is designed to bring fresh experiences for players. This move coincides with the arrival of the new ad campaign that seeks to help players find more ways to win, including through a 50 free spin bonus when signing up and making their first deposit.</p>
<p>Commenting on these new initiatives, FanDuel VP of brand strategy Daniele Phillips said that FanDuel Casino was all about celebrating the feeling of victory.</p>
<p>“Our latest campaign doubles down on how the feeling of winning outranks all else from successfully avoiding your neighbor to catching your car keys in one hand,” Phillips added. Pete Lefebvre, creative director at Mischief @ No Fixed Address, the creative agency behind FanDuel Casino’s latest marketing campaign, said that there was no feeling quite like winning.</p>
<p>The Fort Knox Cleopatra game is plenty of fun as well, as it features a progressive jackpot mechanic that is brand new and has the opportunity to trigger hefty winnings.</p>
<p>Designing a Unique Game with Plenty of Winning Options</p>
<p>There is The Cleopatra Bonus as well as the newly-introduced Fort Knox Bonus, which players can trigger by hitting three Sphinx Scatter Symbols and activating the 15 free spins.</p>
<p>During this round, all winnings are tripled. FanDuel Casino managing director Asaf Noifeld said that creating and adding great games was a top priority for the company and the arrival of IGT PlayDigital’s Fort Knox Cleopatra was a clear step in that direction.</p>
<p>The game was also welcomed by Gil Rotem, IGT president of gaming, who said that it was thrilling to have an exclusive title. “As FanDuel Casino continues to grow, we look forward to bringing Fort Knox Cleopatra to new and existing players,” Rotem added.</p>
