<p>The new collaboration designates the trio as Effective Partners of the Associations and complements its goal to developing a sustainable licensed gambling sector in the country</p>
<p>The Portuguese Online Betting and Gaming Association (APAJO), an organization representing the regulated online gambling and betting sector, announced it created a new membership status for companies within the market in the country that deliver technology, services and solutions, powering regulated betting and gaming operators.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the Association confirmed the new membership status, Effective Partner, and added a handful of globally-recognized companies to that list. APAJO confirmed that the first companies that were added to the new list are the globally recognized betting and gaming industry giants, IGT, Playtech and Evolution.</p>
<p>In 2016, Portugal launched its licensed online gambling market. In less than a decade, the iGaming market has been steadily growing, attracting customers that previously used black market operators and engaging with clients from the retail sector.</p>
<p>Judging by a recent study from Aximage, approximately 60% of the customers in Portugal use the services of a licensed gambling operator. Still, APAJO hopes to increase that percentage and reduce the number of players using black market operators by collaborating with experienced, licensed betting and gaming companies, as well as other industry stakeholders. Ultimately, the Association aims to contribute toward the development of a sustainable, safe and entertaining market that caters to the growing number of customers.</p>
<p>Ricardo Domingues, APAJO’s board president, acknowledged the Association’s efforts toward the development of a sustainable and safe iGaming market in Portugal. He welcomed IGT, Playtech and Evolution as the first Effective Partners of APAJO. Finally, Domingues said that APAJO anticipates further expansion of its list of partners soon.</p>
<p>“We are very proud and happy to welcome Evolution, IGT and Playtech, all leaders in this business who have been supportive of the concept from the beginning, as the first partners of APAJO.“ Ricardo Domingues, board president for APAJO</p>
<p>The Trio Is Delighted to Team Up with APAJO</p>
<p>IGT’s SVP, chief compliance and risk management officer, Luke Orchard, explained that the company is thrilled to fuel the growth of the licensed gambling sector in Portugal. Additionally, he said that IGT is glad to support APAJO’s goals by becoming an Effective Partner.</p>
<p>Playtech’s head of regulatory affairs, Charmaine Hogan, added: “Playtech is delighted to join APAJO and collaborate with both local operators and our international peers to support growth of the sector in Portugal.” She explained that the company has extensive experience within the iGaming sector and will be excited to leverage it and contribute toward the development of a safer licensed sector in collaboration with APAJO.</p>
<p>Finally, Nicholas Peters, Evolution’s chief business development officer, Europe, said that the collaboration with the Association complements the company’s goal of being present in regulated gambling markets across the globe. He said that based on experience, Evolution knows that a sustainable market environment is created via an effective collaboration with regulators, suppliers and operators. Finally, Peters said that the company is looking forward to the successful collaboration with APAJO and predicted it will deliver positive change.</p>
