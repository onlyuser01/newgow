<p>The provider of premium content for the online gambling industry, Red Rake Gaming, announced a new partnership with the leading Lithuanian online casino platform, 7bet. Confirmed on Tuesday, the new content distribution deal will see Red Rake Gaming significantly expand the reach of its leading casino games to new audiences in the country. Per the new collaboration, the provider of premium games agreed to supply its portfolio of thrilling titles, powering 7bet's operations for the regulated gambling market in Lithuania.</p>
<p>Thanks to the new deal, customers of the operator will be able to access engaging games from Red Rake Gaming, including the feature-rich 1st of the Irish game, as well as Guardians of Luxor and Super 20 Stars, among other hit games. The outstanding portfolio of games will significantly expand and enhance 7bet's offering in the country.</p>
<p>At the same time, the partnership enables Red Rake Gaming to reach new clients, delivering its products that stand out with unique features and themes. The collaboration represents an important achievement for 7bet, considering that Red Rake's games are already renowned for their quality across multiple markets in Europe.</p>
<p>Nick Barr, Red Rake Gaming Malta's Managing Director, was excited about the latest collaboration in Lithuania with 7bet. In a statement, he pointed out: "We are thrilled to partner with 7bet, who is a key player in the Lithuanian market."</p>
<p>Barr pointed out that Red Rake has seen great success in similar markets with its popular content. He predicted that the company will replicate this success and at the same time, propel 7bet's growth in the region. Finally, Barr said: "Red Rake Gaming continues to go from strength to strength across the regulated landscape and we look forward to the Lithuanian market contributing to our ongoing success."</p>
<p>The latest strategic content agreement with 7bet comes after earlier this month, Red Rake confirmed a partnership with LuckyStreak, the leading online casino solutions provider. Under the terms of that deal, the provider of games for the iGaming sector agreed to grant LuckyStreak access to its thrilling games.</p>
<p>Per that deal, the operator gained access to Red Rake's entire catalog of in-house games, expanding significantly its offering. Similarly to the deal with 7bet, that partnership enabled Red Rake to expand its reach and engage with new audiences.</p>
<p>Currently, the company has a presence in more than 16 regulated gambling markets around the world. Red Rake continues to expand its footprint and has more deals in the pipeline that are expected to propel the reach of its engaging content further.</p>
