<p>Hard Rock Online Casino New Jersey became the latest mobile sports betting operation to hire the services of payments platform provider Paysafe after a partnership for card processing was announced today.</p>
<p>Seamless Card Transactions</p>
<p>The Hard Rock Online Casino New Jersey mobile app will benefit from the experience gained over more than 20 years of global iGaming operation by the payment provider via a streamlined integration with Paysafe’s payment gateway to offer players card deposits.</p>
<p>“We’re thrilled with the product performance and incredible service that Paysafe has provided for the Hard Rock Online Casino New Jersey mobile app. Paysafe has been a great partner and we continue to explore ways to further incorporate their payment solutions into Hard Rock Digital’s suite of products as we expand into new markets.” Matt Primeaux, Executive Managing Director and President, Hard Rock Digital</p>
<p>Operated by Hard Rock Digital, the exclusive Hard Rock International and Seminole Gaming vehicle for interactive gaming and sports betting, Hard Rock Online Casino New Jersey is the latest online betting and gaming app in New Jersey that adds payment options from the leader in iGaming payments, joining the ranks of SuperBook Sports which teamed with Paysafe in November last year.</p>
<p>Navigating the Payment Experience</p>
<p>The new partnership ensures seamless and secure transactions with debit or credit cards to fund player accounts at the mobile sports betting and gaming app within seconds and enable wagering on sporting events, as well as play at any of the online casino’s games, a mixed portfolio of branded and original slots, table games and live dealer titles.</p>
<p>“We’re proud to partner with Hard Rock Digital to facilitate online payments for its iGaming and sports-betting brand as well as its customers in New Jersey. We hope to continue to grow our relationship with Hard Rock and its brands in the future.” Zak Cutler, CEO, North America iGaming, Paysafe</p>
<p>The agreement will also allow Hard Rock Online Casino New Jersey customers real-time access to their winnings through their bank accounts, utilizing Paysafe’s connection to third-party providers of warranty services for ACH payments.</p>
<p>Paysafe announced last month it entered into the recently launched mobile sports betting market in New York by offering payments and affiliate services to continue to expand its footprint in the US and North America and keep the strong momentum of the business since 2021. Following the New York launch, Paysafe has active operations in 18 US states plus Washington, D.C.</p>
