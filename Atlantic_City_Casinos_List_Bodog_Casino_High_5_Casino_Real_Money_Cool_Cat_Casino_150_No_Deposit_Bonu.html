<p>The West division of the Clash Royale League (CRL) is back with 11 teams competing for a spot in the World Finals 2020 which will get underway on December 5-6 in Shanghai, China.</p>
<p>Supercell Announces Clash Royale League West for September 19</p>
<p>The Clash Royale League (CRL) West is returning for another chapter on September 19, Supercell revealed on Friday, September 4. The event is a qualifying tournament for the Clash Royale League (CRL) World Finals 2020 which will be hosted on December 5 and December 6 in Shanghai, China.</p>
<p>Overall, Supercell is offering a decent prize pool as well as four qualifying spots for teams interested in progressing to the World Finals. The CRL West reunites some of the most promising Clash Royale esports teams, including Chivas Esports, Cream Real Betis, Dignitas, Misfits Gaming, paiN Gaming, SK Gaming, Spacestation Gaming, Team Liquid, Team Queso, and Tribe Gaming.</p>
<p>Supercell has not released full details of the league just yet, but information about the prize pool, rosters, and schedule should be coming in the next few days. Meanwhile, the CRL could be played in an online format similar to the spring season and due to COVID-19. The company might agree to go with a LAN format, though.</p>
<p>In the previous competitive chapter in the CRL we saw Spacestation Gaming, a newly-formed team, soar to impeccable victory in both the regular season and playoff games. The team faced and defeated Misfits Gaming 3-0 in the finals.</p>
<p>Spacestation will be returning to the event to defend their title and progress to the World Finals 2020. Only four teams will progress to the next stage. Meanwhile, the CRL East started on August 15 featuring eight teams. Both East and West division teams are looking to secure the $225,000 prize pool in the upcoming World Finals.</p>
