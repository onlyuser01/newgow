<p>Sports betting and iGaming brand 888 announced today it signed a deal with the National Football League (NFL) to become an official sports betting partner for the league in the UK and Ireland.</p>
<p>NFL Events to Feature 888 Ads</p>
<p>Under the terms of the partnership deal, Gibraltar-based gaming operator 888 will have the right to advertise its sports betting and iGaming products during the official broadcasts from the NFL on Monday Night Football and the league’s biggest events of the season, the playoffs and Super Bowl Final which feature on Sky Sports. 888 will also be an official partner for the league for the games it will play in London in 2021.</p>
<p>“This is the start of an exciting chapter for 888sport. We pride ourselves on being at the forefront of live sporting experiences and we’re delighted to partner with an internationally adored brand such as the NFL. We look forward to playing our part in an exciting NFL season, which kicks off this weekend, and beyond.” Guy Cohen, Senior Vice President and Head of B2C, 888</p>
<p>888 Social Channels to Popularize NFL Product</p>
<p>The sports betting operator that became the first official NFL betting partner in the UK and Ireland, will launch on its social channels “The Punt”, a special series of videos in which the focus will be the latest news from the NFL discussed by celebrity guests.</p>
<p>“We are delighted to partner with 888Sport, our first official UK betting partner. It is a brand that will help us deepen fans’ engagement with our sport, and this partnership will provide us with strategic insights that will shape our broader sports betting strategy.” Chris Halpin, Executive Vice President and Chief Strategy &amp; Growth Officer, NFL</p>
<p>The deal 888 signed with the professional football league is similar to the one the NFL signed with TabCorp in 2019, under the terms of which the horse racing and betting operator became the league’s first Official Wagering Partner in Australia.</p>
<p>The new deal is not the first interaction between the league and the sports betting and online gaming operator. In 2019, 888 signed a partnership deal with the New York Jets from the NFL to have its brand feature extensively at the MetLife Stadium’ s video board during games.</p>
<p>Besides the deal with 888, the professional football league in the US signed a similar deal with Costa Rica’s betting operator Betcris. The bookmaker which has strong presence in the US market became the league’s official sports book in Latin America.</p>
