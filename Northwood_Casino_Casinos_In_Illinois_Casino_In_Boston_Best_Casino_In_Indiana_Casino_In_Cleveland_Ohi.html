    <h1>Northwood Casino Casinos In Illinois Casino In Boston Best Casino In Indiana Casino In Cleveland Ohi</h1>

<p>@Radka - thank you for explaining and now I understand why you put what is in their terms.</p>
<p>Would it be helpful to add something to the section ‘Doesn't accept players from United Kingdom’ registration may not be blocked so you risk not being able to withdraw winnings (for example)?</p>
<p>My Live Chat with Velobet Casino:</p>
<p>Me</p>
<p>I am from the UK and managed to register with you, but as I understand it you do t allow UK players. What do you do to prevent this and if I played and won would I be able to withdraw winnings?</p>
<p>Live Chat</p>
<p>After full verification, you will be able to make a withdrawal. You need to verify your identity, address, and email as well.</p>
<p>Me</p>
<p>So you do accept players from the UK then?</p>
<p>Live Chat</p>
<p>We accept Players only from those countries and geographic regions where online gambling is allowed by law. It is the Player’s sole responsibility to inquire about the existing gambling laws and regulations of the given jurisdiction before placing bets on the Website</p>
<p>Me</p>
<p>You are not answering my question properly - you say does not allow UK players yet you do - how does that work please?</p>
<p>Live Chat</p>
<p>UK players are also permitted to play on our website.</p>
<p>Me</p>
<p>Do you not think then you need to remove the UK from the restricted Countries list so there is no confusion?</p>
<p>Live Chat</p>
<p>Please wait, I will check the information for you to give you detailed information</p>
<p>They stop responding and suddenly this appeared but the chat had been ended!</p>
<p>Chat</p>
<p>Could you specify which point you are referring to in our terms and conditions?</p>
<p>Please note that the chat will be closed automatically due to inactivity.</p>
<p>If you have no further questions, I'll close the chat with you and wish you a nice day and good luck!</p>
