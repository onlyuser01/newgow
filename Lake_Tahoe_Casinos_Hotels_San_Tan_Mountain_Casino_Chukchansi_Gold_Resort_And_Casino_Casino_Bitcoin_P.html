<p>On November 20, GiG signed an expansion deal with existing partner KAK to offer its online and retail sports betting services, which includes a fully integrated omnichannel sportsbook.</p>
<p>25 Land-Based Location to Offer Sports Betting</p>
<p>Gaming Innovation Group (GiG) signed on Friday, November 20 an extension of an existing partnership with tourism and hospitality company KAK DOO Skopje (KAK), providing retail and online sports betting solutions, including a custom proprietary omnichannel sportsbook. An initial 25 North Macedonia sports betting venues are covered in the agreement.</p>
<p>In July this year, KAK and GiG agreed on a long-term deal for providing KAK’s digital casino platform with GiG’s technology and managed services. As KAK recently decided to enter the sports betting industry in North Macedonia, the new agreement will allow the company to develop its online and land-based sports betting offering through GiG’s end-to-end platform.</p>
<p>Fully-Integrated Sportsbook</p>
<p>Previously, GiG announced on September 7 an agreement with Betgenius for the creation of a “fully-integrated sportsbook and platform solution for operators in regulated markets around the world”.</p>
<p>This deal means that KAK will also benefit from trading, risk management services, and end-to-end live data, which includes about 300 competitions across the world.</p>
<p>The new digital and land-based sports betting offerings will launch in the second quarter of 2021. GiG agreed to power KAK’s digital expansion in September.</p>
<p>GiG CEO Richard Brown said the addition of its online and OTC sportsbook solutions to KAK’s online casino, already powered by GiG, will allow North Macedonian players to have a “seamless end-to-end experience”.</p>
<p>“We are very much looking forward to working with them to deliver a great product to the local market.” -GiG CEO Richard Brown</p>
<p>KAK’s decision to extend its gaming offering to sports betting, online and offline, was “a natural step” for the company, CEO Ognjan Cigovski said. The company already operates successful gambling locations.</p>
<p>“We can now offer our customers a full suite of products across multiple locations as well as online.” -KAK CEO Ognjan Cigovski</p>
<p>GiG also said last week that it had agreed on a three-year contract with Latvian operator Admirālu Klubs. The iGaming supplier will provide new digital services, including a sportsbook, front-end development solutions, and an online platform.</p>
