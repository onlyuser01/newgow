<p>The Venetian is implementing some 800 steps to keep the Las Vegas gaming property safe when it eventually reopens. Precautions range from increased numbers of emergency medical technicians (EMTs) to using thermal cameras to check for coronavirus-linked fevers.</p>

<p>While the Las Vegas Sands Corp. property has yet to identify a reopening date, this week it released the Venetian Clean Commitment plan for the casino floor, hotel suites, meeting spaces, as well as restaurants and lounges.</p>
<p>Our company will continue to adhere to guidance provided by the state of Nevada, as we look to data to inform our decision on when best to open our doors to guests and Team Members. It is not prudent to set an opening date without the appropriate data to support it,” a Venetian spokesperson told Casino.org on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Under the plan, The Venetian will have EMTs on duty 24 hours a day to provide care to visitors with possible coronavirus. The venue will also have a team of 25 EMTs. A third of them will be at the property daily. That is believed to be more than typically are found at gaming properties.</p>
<p>There will also be additional cleaning and use of disinfectants, especially in the area where a guest found to have COVID-19 symptoms was located.</p>
<p>If a guest at the hotel is found to have coronavirus, their suite will be sanitized by a specialized cleaning service. It will not be used until fully sanitized.</p>
<p>Thermal cameras will be installed at entrances so security officers can check temperatures of workers and visitors. Anyone with a temperature over 100.4 degrees will be checked a second time, and if a high fever is confirmed, they will get a medical assessment and then be advised to receive medical treatment as needed.</p>
<p>Players and other guests can wear a face mask and gloves. But the face mask cannot cover the entire face.</p>
<p>The gaming floor will see stepped-up cleaning. That specifically includes cashier counters, gaming machines, and gaming tables.</p>
<p>Casino Chips Disinfected Every Two Hours</p>
<p>“Our casino chips are disinfected at each table approximately every two hours, with additional sanitation procedures in place throughout the day,” according to the plan. “In addition, slot machines and chairs are arranged to allow for appropriate distancing, and table games have a maximum of three chairs per table.”</p>
<p>Those staying overnight at The Venetian will be given a face mask by the hotel. A safety kit with hand sanitizer, disinfecting wipes, and latex gloves will also be provided to hotel guests.</p>
<p>Visitors, players, and employees must keep physical distance from others. Guests need to stand at least six feet away from other people if they are in lines, in elevators, or walking around the resort. No more than four people will likely be allowed in elevators concurrently.</p>
<p>The Venetian will use electrostatic sprayers to clean high-touch surfaces with advanced disinfectant. Crews will also use ultraviolet lights to sanitize shipping boxes, luggage, and mail.</p>
<p>Gondolas will be limited to four passengers at one time. Gondola drivers must wear face masks.</p>
<p>The Venetian’s restaurant tables, slot machines, and other furnishings and equipment will be relocated to ensure appropriate distancing. Restaurants and bars will have less seating.</p>
<p>Chairs at the pool will also be spaced out for safety. Also, plastic barriers will be located throughout the venue.</p>
<p>Special cleaning and distancing precautions will also be implemented in exhibition spaces. The same will take place in conference areas.</p>
<p>The Venetian Cancels Reservations for May</p>
<p>Currently, The Venetian is not accepting reservations. The resort also cancelled all previously booked reservations through May 31.</p>
<p>Employees will continue to receive full salary and benefits through May 17. Emergency salaries for workers at partner restaurants are getting paid.</p>
<p>Wynn Resorts and MGM Resorts International will also beef up health precautions when they reopen, given the risk of transmission from coronavirus, according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal.</p>
<p>As of Monday, there were 3,793 COVID-19 cases in Clark County, Nevada, where Las Vegas is situated. There have been 186 deaths in Clark County associated with the pandemic.</p>
