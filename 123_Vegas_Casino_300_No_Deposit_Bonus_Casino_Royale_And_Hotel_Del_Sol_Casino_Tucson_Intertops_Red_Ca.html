<p>Rhode Island has done it. The Ocean State is now officially the seventh state to have legalized iGaming, a form of interactive wagering that will allow online casino games to become a part of the gambling landscape. With a population of just over one million residents, Rhode Island isn’t the biggest market in the United States, but it is certainly one of the most forward-thinking ones.</p>
<p>Rhode Island is now preparing to launch iGaming in the state by March 2024. In the United States, just because an activity is legalized it doesn’t mean it’s live yet, and some states have taken lengthy periods to actually go ahead and roll out their gambling products despite having signed the appropriate laws. Rhode Island though is looking at a much shorter time window. Gov. Dan McKee who signed iGaming into law is hoping that his state will welcome online casinos by early next year.</p>
<p>The law will prohibit anyone who is not of the legal gambling age to participate in online casino gaming. This means only individuals 21 or older would be able to play. The online casinos will be operated out from the Twin River and Tiverton Casinos through the lottery division of the state’s Department of Revenue. The legal gambling age for sports betting, for example, is only 18.</p>
<p>The news was welcomed by the sponsors and champions of the law (2023-S 0948B, 2023-H 6348A). Senate President Dominick J. Ruggerio has been pleased with the opportunity to see this legislation passed, stating in an official address, that it would make it much easier for players to access gaming products from their mobile devices.</p>
<p>This, Ruggerio explained, would lead to vital funding for state programs and investments. "The time has come for us to take this step and be competitive with our neighbors," Representative Gregory J. Costantino pitched in, arguing that Rhode Island has been falling behind in terms of gambling regulation – no more. The state indeed stands to benefit in terms of tax, as Rhode Island will be bagging 61% of online slot gaming revenue.</p>
<p>The towns of Lincoln and Tiverton where the physical operators are based will also get a 1.45% cut. The state is going to receive 15.5% of revenue from online table games, with the two towns getting 1%. Interestingly, though, for the table games, a live dealer would need to be present to make these games legal.</p>
