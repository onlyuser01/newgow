    <h1>Gulfstream Park Racing And Casino Choctaw Casino And Resort How To Start Diamond Casino Heist Casino</h1>

<p>There are only three races on the Formula 1 calendar that the reigning champion Max Verstappen still hasn’t won. What’s interesting is that he can win each of those by the end of the 2023 season. The first of those three races is on the program on Sunday, September 17. Oddsmakers think he’ll pull it off. Are they right to think so?</p>

<p>Why is Verstappen Favored to Win the 2023 Singapore GP?</p>
<p>Max Verstappen is the best driver in the 2023 Formula 1, who’s driving the best car in the competition. This is why no one should be surprised that he’s won 12 races so far in 2023. Nine of those happened in the last nine events.</p>
<p>Further, in the two races that he didn’t win, Verstappen finished second, just behind his Red Bull Racing teammate, Sergio Perez. Perez is the one who won the Singapore GP last year. In that race, Verstappen finished in the No. 7 position. Before that, the event wasn’t held for two years due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The result is that Verstappen is without a win at this circuit. The Singapore GP is one of the three races on the F1 calendar that he still hasn’t won. The other two are the Qatar GP and the inaugural Las Vegas GP, both of which are yet to be held in the 2023 season.</p>
<p>Can Someone Ruin Verstappen’s Plans on September 17?</p>
<p>The short answer is no. The Dutchman is someone who needs to be taken seriously in every single event of the 2023 F1 season. But, if something goes astray for the reigning champ, who could take advantage of that?</p>
<p>Lewis Hamilton is the man to focus on. The former champ is without a single win in 2023, meaning that he’s super motivated to win on September 17. Plus, the Singapore race might be suitable for this guy. The thing is that this is a high-downforce circuit, which is the kind that usually suits Mercedes drivers.</p>
<p>The Spanish Grand Prix belongs to this category, a race in which Hamilton finished second – his tied-best record of the 2023 season.</p>
<p>2023 Singapore GP Prediction</p>
<p>Max Verstappen will win this race. Anything other than that would be a huge upset. However, Verstappen’s odds are just way too short. A driver with better odds is Hamilton. Although we don’t think the British driver is going to win, we do think he’s going to finish on the podium on Sunday.</p>
<p>Picks: Max Verstappen to win; Lewis Hamilton to finish in the top 3.</p>
