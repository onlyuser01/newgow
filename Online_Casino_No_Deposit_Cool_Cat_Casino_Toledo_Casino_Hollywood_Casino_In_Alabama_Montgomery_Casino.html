    <h1>Online Casino No Deposit Cool Cat Casino Toledo Casino Hollywood Casino In Alabama Montgomery Casino</h1>

<p>Hello. I am forced to file a complaint against the Skol casino. Because they are delaying my refund. I played my favorite game in this casino and made deposits of 350 EUR. When I made a withdrawal request, I received a letter saying that they cannot issue a withdrawal to my card with which I made deposits, and I can withdraw funds to my SWIFT bank account. I waited a few days, but I don't really care by which method I will receive my funds. I made a withdrawal to a bank account. But as soon as I made the withdrawal, I received a letter from them that they will cancel all my winnings, and the deposits will be returned to my deposit method that I used to deposit funds. After that, they asked me to send them my documents, namely a photo of my passport, a photo of proof of address, and a selfie with my passport in my hands. I sent them the documents as soon as I received the letter about it. A few days later, I contacted their customer service via chat and was told twice that my documents had been approved and verified. When I asked about my refund, the agent just closed the chat with me. I applied again and they told me that they could not help me with this. So I wrote an email to their support, asking them to explain to me why I still haven't received my deposits back, as they said in their letter. Unfortunately, they only answer me that they need time to resolve the issue. I note that I sent the documents on January 25, 2023 at 19:54. And they promised to return my funds after checking my documents. But today, February 1, 2023, my documents were checked and verified. And my funds are still with them, and they do not understand where my funds are now, and why they have not yet sent them to me by return, as they said in their letter. Please help me get my deposits back. This company breaks all terms with players and their customer support does not support their customers one bit. I am shocked by this attitude. My account has already been verified (it was also verified before playing them) But I still can't get my deposits back. I don't know where my funds are and what they are doing with them all these days.</p>
