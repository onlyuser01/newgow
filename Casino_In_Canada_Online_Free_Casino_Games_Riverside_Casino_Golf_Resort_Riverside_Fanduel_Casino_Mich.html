<p>Kindred Group has faced a rough patch with many of the company’s top-level executives deciding that the time to move on has come. After announcing his leave from the company earlier this year, Johan Wilsby will now be succeeded by another Kindred veteran and a trusted industry specialist, Patrick Kortman.</p>
<p>Wilsby said in May that he will be retiring from his position as a Chief Financial Officer, which is now met with the Group’s readiness to introduce a new trusted person in the position. Kortman, however, is filling a temporary role as he is stepping in as Interim CFO for the Group. He assumed the role on Wednesday, June 21, 2023, and will continue in his new office until the Group's top brass has found a person they want to promote in a permanent position.</p>
<p>This is not to say that Kortman may not remain in the position should the Group decide he is the best fit for it. Kortman is an industry specialist, and more importantly – a Kindred Group insider. He has been with the Group since 2018, and has worked with its many teams and executives, garnering a very strong knowledge of what Kindred is trying to achieve and how it intends to get there.</p>
<p>The changes at the top began with the Group’s long-standing chief executive officer Henrik Tjärnström stepping down from his position in May, and Nils Andén stepping in as an Interim CEO for the Group. Kindred is also mulling a potential business sale, but no further details have been offered at this time.</p>
<p>Commenting on the appointment of Kortman in the position, Andén said that he was happy to see the man step into that position. He said:</p>
<p>"Patrick knows Kindred very well and has a vast experience in the financial sector, and he will continue to bring great value to Kindred's financial operations, to the wider Executive Team, and to the Board as we continue to focus on the strategic review."</p>
<p>Andén hailed Kortman’s appointment as a sign that Kindred Group is capable of maintaining momentum and consistency despite recent challenges. In the meantime, the Group has engaged with its responsible gambling and social responsibility initiatives as well as its ongoing commitment to continually expand its footprint and secure new business opportunities across the board.</p>
<p>Kortman moved to an Interim CFO from his position as Director of Corporate Development and Investor Relations.</p>
