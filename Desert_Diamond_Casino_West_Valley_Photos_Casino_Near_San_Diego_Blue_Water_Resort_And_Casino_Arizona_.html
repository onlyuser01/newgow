<p>Las Vegas Fixture, Hip-Hop Icon Snoop Dogg Offers to Perform at King Charles Coronation</p>

<p>When King Charles is coronated as the UK’s monarch in May, the ceremony showcases something a little unusual. The rapper, marijuana lover, actor, and casino entrepreneur Snoop Dogg says he’s ready to take the stage to perform.</p>

<p>Snoop would welcome a chance to participate in the coronation, he days. He recently told The Sun that he would perform to honor “Queen Lizzie” in reference to the late Queen Elizabeth II. He says the performance would showcase his respect for Elizabeth and the royal family.</p>
<p>Snoop has recently aligned himself with the casino and iGaming world. This month, he partnered with crypto online casino Roobet to promote the cryptocurrency-centric online casino. His new role is apparently “chief ganjaroo officer.”</p>
<p>“Roobet took amazing care of me even before they realized who I was, bringing the ultimate player experience, and I been sayin’ Roooooo ever since,” Snoop said previously about the company.</p>
<p>Roobet co-founder Matt Duea told the media that Snoop is “a real visionary” for the gambling company.</p>
<p>Snoop has been a staple in American music since the early ’90s. He’s best known for hits like “Gin and Juice” and “Drop it Like It’s Hot.” He’s received 17 Grammy nominators, an American Music Award and a Primetime Emmy.</p>
<p>In 2021, he performed at the Super Bowl LVI halftime show with Dr. Dre, Eminem, Kendrick Lamar and Mary J. Blige.</p>
<p>In 2019, he created his own esports league, known as the “Gangsta Gaming League.”</p>
<p>Bad Reputation</p>
<p>Snoop has suffered from some bad publicity in England in the past. In 2006, Snoop got into a tiff at London’s Heathrow Airport when British Airways refused to allow him and his entourage into a VIP lounge. Some group members were traveling in economy and couldn’t enter, leading to a brawl involving over 30 people.</p>
<p>That led to Snoop missing a planned concert tour in the UK. The issue wasn’t resolved until four years later. He then regained entry after he sued – and beat – the UK Border Agency.</p>
<p>But despite the storied past, he apparently has a soft spot for Queen Elizabeth. In an interview with The Guardian eight years ago, Snoop stated that he beat the Border Agency because of the Queen’s intervention.</p>
<p>Per his version of the story, she listened to her grandchildren, Princes William and Harry, when they begged her to show him mercy. From that point forward, Snoop was hooked. “The Queen, that’s my gal,” he boasted.</p>
<p>Snoop also faced UK tabloid fodder after he was accused of murder in the US. He was acquitted in 1996.</p>
<p>Change in Genre</p>
<p>The last coronation in the UK occurred 70 years ago, ushering in Queen Elizabeth’s era. That included hits like “Chaconne” from the 1691 opera “King Arthur” and more contemporary music. “Confortare” by classical musical composer George Dyson debuted during the event.</p>
<p>Should Snoop get his chance, it would be a first and a definite break from tradition. And the odds are increasingly in his favor. Sir Elton John, Harry Styles, and others have backed out over recent royal controversies, possibly paving the way for Snoop Dogg history.</p>
