<p>The Red Queen review</p>
<p>Theme and Style</p>
<p>The Red Queen is themed around Lewis Carroll’s classic Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.</p>
<p>Players will enter a whimsical realm where the fierce Red Queen rules. Giant mushrooms, white rabbits, and mad hatters ensure that this slot is a trippy experience.</p>
<p>Of course, fans of the book that inspired this slot, or Disney’s film adaptation Alice in Wonderland, will particularly enjoy the aesthetics and atmosphere.</p>

<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The Red Queen’s soundtrack has a dreamy soundtrack with a sinister undertone. At first the tinkingling notes seem charming, but the melody quickly turns eerie and almost unsettling. This suits the Wonderland setting perfectly, as do the ambient sounds of birds and cuckoo clocks.</p>
<p>Vivid shades of red, pink, and gold dominate this slot’s color palette, adding a subtly royal vibe. Behind the reels, enormous fuschia toadstools glow softly as butterflies flutter among them.</p>
<p>The reels are adorned with vines and flowers, with a curiosity-provoking red door covering some of the game area. Fanciful letters appear in jewel tones, including red, green, pink, and purple.</p>
<p>Among the symbols players will also find a pink Cheshire Cat with an unnerving grin, a white rabbit with a pocket watch, and the stern Red Queen herself sporting a golden crown.</p>
<p>Together, the soundtrack and animation create an eccentric and slightly ominous world that invokes the Wonderland universe well.</p>
<p>The Mystery symbol changes into randomly selected symbol for each spin</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>The Red Queen is a five-reel, three-row slot. However, there is a sixth reel that may be unlocked (see further details below).</p>
<p>Wins are awarded for landing matching symbols in adjacent reels, starting from the leftmost reel and going towards the rightmost.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol appears on reels 2-5 and substitutes for all regular symbols. Wild symbols may land with an associated multiplier of 2x or 4x at random.</p>
<p>The Mystery symbol changes into one, two or four instances of a matching paying symbol after every spin.</p>
<p>Throughout the base game, the sixth reel will remain locked until 2-3 Bonus symbols land. At this point the sixth reel will unlock and spin only Queen symbols, Bonus symbols, and blank symbols.</p>
<p>If a Bonus symbol lands on the sixth reel, the Free Spins feature begins. If a Queen symbol lands on the sixth reel, the Queen Respin feature begins.</p>
<p>6th reel opens if at least 2 bonus symbols land on reels</p>
<p>During the Queen Re-spin feature, any Bonus symbols which landed during the base spin will transform into Wilds. Each of these wilds receives a randomly selected multiplier. These remain on screen for the duration of the feature. The Wild multipliers apply to all winning combinations created after the respin.</p>
<p>The Free Spins feature can also be triggered by landing 3-4 Bonus symbols. Prior to the start of the feature, a clock will appear and spin to determine the number of free spins awarded. When the feature is triggered by 4 Bonus symbols, players will have slightly more favorable odds during the free spin assignment.</p>
<p>Above each reel, players will see 4 Soldiers that can display randomly chosen modifiers. This includes guaranteed splitting symbols, guaranteed Wild multipliers, and additional free spins.</p>
<p>During the Free Spins feature, the sixth reel is unlocked, containing regular, paying symbols.</p>
