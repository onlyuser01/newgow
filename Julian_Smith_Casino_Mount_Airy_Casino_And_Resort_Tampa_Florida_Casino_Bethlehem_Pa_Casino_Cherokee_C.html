    <h1>Julian Smith Casino Mount Airy Casino And Resort Tampa Florida Casino Bethlehem Pa Casino Cherokee C</h1>

<p>I am of the opinion that bonuses should be regulated by the EU so that the bonus conditions are the same for all casinos.</p>
<p>Bonuses don't serve to make the game fun for the player - because that's what the slots should do. Bonuses actually only serve to make you deposit money, and the bonus makes your life difficult to get a payout.</p>
<p>If there is a bonus, please use the same conditions for all casinos.</p>
<p>What would be acceptable bonus conditions?</p>
<p>Let's start with the wagering - in my opinion, only the bonus amount should be wagered and not the deposit amount too.</p>
<p>How often should the bonus amount be wagered - in my opinion a maximum of 30 x the bonus amount.</p>
<p>And when you talk about turnover, then the value of the spin should be calculated here, just like the winnings - unfortunately there are always casinos that only value the spin, but not the winnings</p>
<p>Let's come to the payout - what's the nonsense when casinos specify a payout of a maximum of 10 times your deposit amount.</p>
<p>Example - you deposit 25 euros, you get 100% bonus, i.e. 50 euros. The casino requires you to wager the bonus and deposit amount (50 euros) 50 times - that would be 2500 euros. Once you have done that, you are allowed to withdraw a maximum of 250 euros. But maybe you were really lucky and had a few thousand euros in your account. Please kid someone else. Of course, it should simply say that payout is unlimited.</p>
<p>Blocked games - if games with bonuses are not allowed to be played, then they are not allowed to open</p>
<p>Very important - if the casino is reputable and you register there - verify your account immediately. Send your documents there immediately and wait until your account has been verified. And don't play beforehand. You will see how quickly your account is verified, as opposed to only doing so when you make a withdrawal.</p>
<p>Because then, strangely enough, the verification takes much longer than if you do it beforehand - many casinos then write to you that unfortunately the verification was not successful, please send these documents. And the money that you sent for withdrawal will be sent back to your gaming account. All of this isn't fun, the casino assumes that you will continue to play until it's verified, then with the money that's back in your account. And you will notice how little slots pay out at once - 95% of the time the players usually lose. That's why I think it's cheeky when the casino returns the money just because they need other documents.</p>
