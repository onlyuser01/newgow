<p>Future Anthem has been successfully leveraging AI and data science in order to improve the iGaming experience for operators and consumers. Now, the company is putting forward a new solution dedicated to achieving the exact same goal. The new service is designed to help studios leverage big data and use it to boost their player retention and revenue through behavior AI analysis.</p>
<p>Future Anthem Leverages AI Solutions to Streamline iGaming Products</p>
<p>Future Anthem, therefore, uses the solution, Amplifier AI, to collect spin-by-spin player data so that it can leverage it and unlock important insights into what motivates players to approach one product over another. The tool collects the data anonymously and aggregates it to discover trends that can help studios develop games that are optimized to player preferences, patterns, and subtle trends that may not be otherwise known to game creators.</p>
<p>The Performance Optimization module developed by Future Anthem is a powerful tool that serves as an all-in-one solution that will help developers make informed decisions, design their games effectively and even promote the resulting products – all of this will be done with greater confidence as the company is now capable of delivering the right insights.</p>
<p>Commenting on this new release, Future Anthem CEO Leigh Nissim said that the company has worked closely with studios to make sure that it can accurately collect and analyze level data, delivering second-to-none solutions in the end.</p>
<p>Building iGaming Titles That Are Based on Big Data</p>
<p>“These suppliers are now able to personalize the player experience on a level that’s never been seen before, helping them get far ahead of their competitors,” Nissim said. Future Anthem is currently running a demo version of its product and hopes that it can collaborate with companies in order to develop its product further and help with the creation of titles that are specifically built to appeal to players and their needs.</p>
<p>Today, Future Anthem has a long list of partners that it has collaborated on various projects. Future Anthem works with Blueprint Gaming, RAW iGaming, Lady Luck Games, Big Time Gaming, and many others to bring exciting products to market on the daily. The latest AI-driven initiative is just another step in this direction.</p>
