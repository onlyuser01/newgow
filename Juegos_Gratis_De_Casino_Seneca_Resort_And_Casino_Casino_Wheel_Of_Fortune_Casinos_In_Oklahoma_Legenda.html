    <h1>Juegos Gratis De Casino Seneca Resort And Casino Casino Wheel Of Fortune Casinos In Oklahoma Legenda</h1>

<p>Without trying to sound harsh, in reply to your claims "players play willingly and are responsible for their decisions"..</p>
<p>Id argue that an addict has no control, and therefor doesn’t play willingly, nor responsibly.</p>
<p>If a casino does it’s part of monitoring potential for problem gamblers/ or addictive behaviours such as:</p>
<p>spending hours on the same slot. (we all know how time flies when you’re deep into slots) making multiple deposits (in quick succession - like chasing loses should be monitored we all know casinos wouldn’t cash out multiple times in the hour without implementing such a check on player game history) If players stop logging in and wagering on site, automatically be taken off the email list of "exclusive offers just for you" these casinos chase players as much as an addicted player submits to the calling of the casino. Live support. They’re their to help you if you have an issue on site; why shouldn’t a casino have an employee team of support that speak out to players that either begin to develop these problematic behaviours and/or display them upon registration.</p>
<p>Gambling addiction produces a long lasting change in the human brain to anyone with repeated exposure to the dopamine rush from the suspense of gambling.</p>
<p>Casinos that promote and state they’re apart of, or support responsible gaming but don’t have automatic support on stand for players signed in for 2 hours + , then again after 4-8-24 hours etc etc) I’ve had personal gambling sessions that run into 24-36 hour session of non stop deposits , non stop spinning. If a casino had these very basic, off the top of my head things I could think that would help me as a problem player I think the casino would be successful and hold a good reputation amongst all players</p>
<p>(I’m using 2 hours as a basis due to a length of a film lasting average 2 hours - since gambling is meant to be fun, and casinos should encourage fun responsible play)</p>
<p>Sorry for the length of message but I personally feel everything stated is valid in response to you stating "players play willingly". I feel that’s incorrect.</p>
