<p>On Thursday, authorities uncovered a Leeds, Ala., illegal gambling operation. Five gambling machines, two firearms, and an unspecified amount of cash were found in the property.</p>
<p>Following the gambling raid on the Elliott Lane operation, Thomas Jeffery Bynum, 56, was arrested on five counts of possession of a gambling device and a single count of promoting gambling, according to Alabama TV station WBMA.</p>
<p>The search was approved by a local judge. Details were not released by Alabama police.</p>
<p>South Carolina Arrests</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Danny Ray Turner and Brenda G. Turner, both 74, of Marion County, S.C., were charged with gambling and seven counts of unlawful possession/operation of a gambling device.</p>
<p>The South Carolina Law Enforcement Division raided their home on July 10, according to South Carolina TV station WMBF. Seven gambling machines were seized from their residence, the report added.</p>
<p>The devices were described as Pot O Gold gaming machines. They include poker, keno, and blackjack games. They are illegal in South Carolina.</p>
<p>The duo was arrested on July 12. They were booked at the Marion County Detention Center and released from custody after each posted an $8K bond.</p>
<p>Brenda Turner admitted to “keeping and operating the illegal machines for the purpose of illegal gambling,” according to South Carolina TV station WBTW.</p>
<p>Their cases were turned over to local prosecutors from the 12th Circuit Solicitor’s Office.</p>
<p>$18K Cash, Gambling Devices Seized</p>
<p>Five people were arrested in Akron, Ohio, and illegal gambling devices were seized last month during a raid.</p>
<p>A half-a-gram of suspected fentanyl, drug paraphernalia, an AR-15 style rifle, three handguns, over $18,000 in cash, and 40 gambling motherboards were apprehended from the gambling operation, according to Akron TV station WOIO.</p>
<p>Following the court-approved search on June 7, Kyle Brown, 27, Leonard Cross IV, 23, and Davontae James, 30, were each charged with gambling and operating a gambling house, according to the report.</p>
<p>Brown and Cross were booked at the Summit County Jail. The other suspects were issued a summons to appear in local court.</p>
<p>Michael Walsh, 37, allegedly possessed the fentanyl and drug paraphernalia. He was charged with possession of drugs and drug paraphernalia.</p>
<p>Beth Ison, 33, was arrested on an unrelated warrant and for misrepresenting her identity, authorities said.</p>
<p>Each of the five cases were turned over to local prosecutors.</p>
<p>Teen Shot</p>
<p>In another Akron case, a 16-year-old was arrested after getting shot in June in an alleged illegal gambling operation. Two adults were also charged.</p>
<p>The incident took place on June 5 at Akron’s Royal Queens Party Center.</p>
<p>The unnamed teen was wounded in the abdomen. He was transported to Akron Children’s Hospital. The injuries were described as serious, but not life-threatening.</p>
<p>He was charged with aggravated robbery and aggravated assault, according to Ohio TV station WKYC.</p>
<p>Authorities said the teen pulled out a firearm when he entered the business. The teen and another person struggled over the firerarm, and a weapon discharged.</p>
<p>Authorities also seized gambling machines, gambling devices, and an unspecified amount of cash from the business.</p>
<p>While police were on the scene, they charged Donovan Alexander, 19, a manager, and Billy Walker, 34, who leases the property, with operating a gambling house, according to the report.</p>
<p>The two men were booked at the Summit County Jail.</p>
