<p>The former casino executive with more than 50 years of experience passed away at 89 on Sunday</p>
<p>Steve Norton, a former casino executive and pioneer for the gambling industry in the United States, passed away at the age of 89. The gaming executive was the first one to oversee the operations of a gambling venue outside Nevada back in the 1980s. Norton was an experienced executive with a solid background after spending more than 50 years within the gambling sector across the US.</p>
<p>As a retired casino executive, he continued to bring strategic guidance to the growing gambling industry. Norton provided strategic guidance and advice to commercial and tribal gaming operators, as well as state gambling regulators. He worked tirelessly to address gambling-related risks such as addiction and also helped create the premier national trade group for the US casino industry, the American Gaming Association, his son, Rob Norton explained, according to a report released by The Associated Press.</p>
<p>Currently, his son holds a senior-level role as president of the leading gaming and entertainment company, Cordish Gaming. According to Rob, his father died on Sunday. His passing comes after an incident at his Oceanside home in California, explained his son.</p>
<p>Norton Ran the First Casino outside of Nevada</p>
<p>Throughout his career, Norton accumulated significant knowledge, experience and insights into the gambling sector in the US. His strategic advice helped multiple states expand gambling and this included the popular riverboats available in different states across the country.</p>
<p>In 1978, Norton was the first executive to run a casino outside of Nevada. Back then, Resorts in Atlantic City, New Jersey, opened its doors to visitors. The casino immediately became a huge success and gained popularity, with people buying different tickets for buffets just to enter the casino floor, Norton explained during an interview with The Associated Press from last year. “It was incredible, it was a madhouse. There were so many cigarettes stubbed out on the floor that before long you couldn’t tell what color the carpet was,” he said at the time.</p>
<p>Besides Resorts, Norton was a part of Las Vegas Sands, as well as other gambling operators, including Argosy Gaming and Gold River Gaming. His knowledge and understanding of the gambling sector helped state governments in Indiana, Illinois and Louisiana expand gambling by bringing the popular riverboats offering casino and entertainment activities.</p>
