    <h1>Payson Casino How Many Casinos Are In Las Vegas The Bicycle Casino Argosy Casino Hotel Spa Clams Cas</h1>

<p>I was already a verified player that had made previous withdrawals before. When I opened my account and got verified I used my tablet which I used almost every time I played with the casino, It was only once or twice that I used the phone to log in to my account to play and I had no idea it had been used by some one else to play on there account. even tho I don't think that is a fair reason to block a loyle players account, I expect the fact that is there reason. But they should not of kept taking my money, If they have the ip address logged for every time Ive logged in they have the capability and no doubt the software that can alert them of this any time some one logs in to there account to play. But because they have no morals and clearly don't care about there players they choose not to tell you until they have too or in my case until they have to payout . Mean while here I am unaware that I have breached the contract because I just happened to use the household device to logg in to my account insted of my normal device, And every day for weeks they let me keep depositing hundreds of dollers in to an account which they have only just now decided is in breach of there contract. If it is in breach of contract now because of the duplicate ip address being used it was in breach the day I logged in on the other device there for they shouldn't have been taking my money from that very moment and that is why I believe I am in titled to all my deposits back from that point. Its really very sad that they are unwilling to see that an honest human mastake was made by using another device. But if that's the reason they are using to keep the 15000 dollers I rightfully won then so be it. And for that very same reason is why they should refund all my deposits made from the point they say I breached</p>
