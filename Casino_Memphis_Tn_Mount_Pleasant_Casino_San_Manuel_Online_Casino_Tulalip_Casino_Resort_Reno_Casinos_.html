<p>US land-based casino operator MGM Resorts International and its digital gaming brand BetMGM announced today a further deepening of their commitment to responsible gaming as they joined promotional efforts of the Problem Gambling Awareness Month throughout March.</p>
<p>Promoting Problem Gambling Awareness Month</p>
<p>The comprehensive tools that are part of the collaboration with the British Columbia Lottery Corporation (BCLC) under its responsible gaming program GameSense are now available for people who gamble in-person and online, outlined the companies as they elected to join the National Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG) to promote its Problem Gambling Awareness Month.</p>
<p>“As we enter our fifth year with GameSense, we remain focused on offering new and innovative resources to our guests, designed to increase responsible gaming awareness and to promote healthy play. GameSense remains an instrumental part of our guest service model and we’re confident that it has and will continue to make a difference.” Bill Hornbuckle, CEO and President, MGM Resorts International</p>
<p>Initially developed and licensed to MGM Resorts by the BCLC in 2017, GameSense is placing the focus on positive, transparent and proactive conversations with players seeking to educate them on how to gamble with their resources responsibly.</p>
<p>Under the program, casino floors feature slot machines with QR codes that provide access to GameSense’s responsible gaming information and educational materials, while GameSense signage is being featured across MGM Resorts’ properties and on marquees.</p>
<p>Additionally, under the GameSense Advisor employee training program, MGM Resorts certified more than 180 GameSense Advisors that are now at players’ disposal staffed at each MGM Rewards desk nationwide.</p>
<p>GameSense Integration to Complete</p>
<p>On its behalf, BetMGM said March would be the month to see the full integration of GameSense into its desktop and mobile platforms. The brand announced the integration of the BCLC’s responsible gaming program in April last year.</p>
<p>“Our industry is expanding at a rapid rate as more markets legalize sports betting, and we’re committed to growing the right way. It is important to empower and educate our customers, and the enhancements we’ve invested into GameSense within BetMGM provides the best information and guest services for players to bet responsibly.” Adam Greenblatt, CEO, BetMGM</p>
<p>With information covering subjects such as setting responsible gaming limits, common gambling myths, and basic rules of gambling, GameSense’s integration into BetMGM complements the brand’s already existing responsible gaming tools and actively promotes responsible gaming with customers.</p>
<p>GameSense also gives access to resources for both customers and their families who may be seeking support and assistance in dealing with problem gambling and to promote the Problem Gambling Awareness Month, BetMGM will deliver to its employees GameSense training.</p>
<p>Promoting the NCPG’s Problem Gambling Awareness Month is the latest initiative supported by MGM Resorts and BetMGM. In September last year, both operators joined as official partners the “Have A Game Plan. Bet Responsibly” public services campaign launched by the American Gaming Association.</p>
