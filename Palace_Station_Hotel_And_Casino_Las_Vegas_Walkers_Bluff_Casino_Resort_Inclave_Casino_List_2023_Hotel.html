    <h1>Palace Station Hotel And Casino Las Vegas Walkers Bluff Casino Resort Inclave Casino List 2023 Hotel</h1>

<p>Hello.</p>
<p>It has now been 16 days since I requested a withdrawal. I received a $30 Cashback which I turned over $1200 and was ready for withdrawal on the first day.</p>
<p>The support team has told me 2-3 times that no deposit bonuses are not applicable for Swedes and I've responded that I'm lucky it was cashback then.</p>
<p>Oops, they now see that it was not a bonus but a cashback and it is still pending. 3-4 times, they've asked for my Bitcoin address which I've sent each time. Most recently, the support team said the lengthy processing time is because I need to verify my account, something no one mentioned or sent an email about.</p>
<p>My account has been verified for a year and I've made a deposit with Bitcoin where I put in $14 but only received $7 because half disappeared somewhere.</p>
<p>The support responds saying one must verify their account twice a year, that was news to me. But I sent the same documents they already have 2 days ago.</p>
<p>It would be kind of you to look into this.</p>
