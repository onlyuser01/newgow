<p>The fast-growing provider of iGaming content, Spinomenal, announced a new deal, bolstering its presence in the Balkans. The company confirmed Thursday it joined forces with Efbet, one of the leading operators in Bulgaria. Under the terms of the new collaboration, Spinomenal titles will power the operator's offering in the European country.</p>
<p>Securing approval from the National Revenue Agency in Bulgaria, Efbet rolled out a number of games from Spinomenal. To provide access to its games, the iGaming supplier used Fusion, Pariplay's aggregation platform.</p>
<p>As a result, Efbet players can now benefit from hit games from Spinomenal, including Queen of Ice, Demi Gods II and Poseidon's Rising. Moreover, players can also tap into Book of rampage and Majestic King, two highly-popular titles from the leading iGaming content supplier.</p>
<p>A representative of Efbet commented on the topic in a statement, revealing that the company is thrilled to expand its offering with popular casino games provided by Spinomenal. "This strategic decision perfectly aligns with our commitment to delivering a constantly refreshed and appealing gaming experience for our customers," explained the representative. Finally, they noted: "We believe that this partnership will contribute to both brands increasing their popularity and solidifying their status as key players."</p>
<p>The same level of excitement was displayed by Lior Shvartz, Spinomenal's CEO. He explained: "We’re very pleased to announce that our premium slot games are now reaching a wider audience of Bulgarian game enthusiasts, courtesy of our partnership with Efbet, one of the country’s most prominent betting platforms." Finally, Shvartz explained that the agreement with Efbet represents an important achievement for Spinomenal in the region, considering the operator's leadership status and dedication to offering exceptional experiences to players in the country.</p>
<p>The latest content agreement is expected to benefit the two companies by creating synergies. On one side, Spinomenal grows its reach and can engage with new customers in Bulgaria while on the other, Efbet significantly strengthens its offering by delivering thrilling games. The new collaboration is also expected to positively impact the iGaming vertical in the region as well.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Spinomenal clinched another important deal in Bulgaria. The company agreed to deliver its games for 8888.bg, strengthening the offering of the operator. The delivery of Spinomenal's titles was facilitated via the leading iGaming supplier and dedicated platform provider, 7777 gaming. As a result, 8888.bg players gained access to a wide range of games that have proven their popularity across the globe.</p>
