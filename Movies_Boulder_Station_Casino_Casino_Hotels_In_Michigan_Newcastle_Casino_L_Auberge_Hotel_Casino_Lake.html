    <h1>Movies Boulder Station Casino Casino Hotels In Michigan Newcastle Casino L Auberge Hotel Casino Lake</h1>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am from India, I made my account on King Billy by July, 9,2022 under 30 spin bonus, where I got $45 with 30x wagering. After completion of wagering they deducted all balance and given $150 in my account. But that time i was not having usd withdrawal payment option so i continue play with my main balance. Later my balance reached $570.00, I talked with many customer support they told me now you are welcome to withdrawal but first you have to deposit minimum amount and need to weger 3 times and after that you have to upload document for account verification.</p>
<p>Same I did I have deposited INR 500 and Wegered 3 times later I uploaded my all document for account verification which got approved but they told me you can not withdraw money in INR since you earned money from USD also I have requested withdrawal of $50.00 in dogecoin which got rejected by mentioning crypto withdrawal is not available for your account. As per customer support they told me to deposit minimum amount via skrill and no need to weger simply message us and we will set up skeill in your account and later you may withdraw.</p>
<p>After all this I started play again on July 11 and my balance reached $3100 where I lost some balance and on July 12th my balance was $1891.00 and also I was having akrill account with me but when I contact customer support I connected with a guy Joe who is very much rude like I did something wrong with him and he is taking rahenge.</p>
<p>I get to know this is happening because I earned this much but he deducted my all balance and again my balance went to $150.00 which is very big cheating also he said this under our t&amp;c. He also mention do what you want he don't care anything.</p>
<p>I am Indian gambling is not legal in India.</p>
<p>We all aware about that.</p>
<p>But this is not about money this all about trus in a single minut that huye broke my all trust.</p>
<p>I have debt of 12 lacs INR but I thought bi I can bring my life again on track also I thought I will buy a byke and will use king Billy steaker on that but in a single minut my all trust, dream got broken.</p>
<p>Really what I can do if any casino will say I will not give your money do what what you want.</p>
<p>We can't do anything.</p>
<p>Moreover I don't have anything to say my be suside will be my final dream of my life.</p>
<p>Thanku so much</p>
