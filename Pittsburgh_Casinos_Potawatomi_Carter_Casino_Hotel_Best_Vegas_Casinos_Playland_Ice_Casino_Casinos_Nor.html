    <h1>Pittsburgh Casinos Potawatomi Carter Casino Hotel Best Vegas Casinos Playland Ice Casino Casinos Nor</h1>

<p>Warning! They do not payout! Registration and verification was fast. But when it comes to payout.. no no! You get a bunch of options for depositing, although I didn't find either of my prefered ways, I had already created an account so I might as well give gift card or what ever you call it a try. Since those gift cards has a fee, I ended up paying €40 but was playing for a total of €30 at the casino. As it turned out the luck was on my side and I won €700. When I go to withdraw "bank transfer" sounded like the best option. But no, I instantly got the message that I have to deposit the same way as I wish to withdraw. Not unusual. Although withdraw to gift card is not possible, "bank transfer" was not available on my deposit options. But here I discorvered the interesting part. As I said you get a bunch of deposit options, you also get a bunch of withdrawing options. But! Only two of those options matched! Bitcoin being one of them. I've never gotten a crypto wallet, so thats not an option. I looked into it once, but it seems quite hard. Which leaves me with just one option. "EzeeWallet". I did not have that, so I downloaded it and had to go through verification there as well. Only to find out that the only way to deposit for my country is by Trustly. I blocked my trustly several years ago in order to not be able to gamble everywhere. I contacted EzeeWallet to ask weather or not I could get another option to deposit, -no answer what so ever. I contacted Trustly in order to unblock myself, -they told me to get back in seven days before they could do anything, due to that I blocked it because of gambling issues. So I contacted burning bet again, asking them to add "bank transfer" or perhaps VISA as options to deposit and withdraw. That was a big NO. And in that mail I also learned that after depositing you also have to wager your deposit a few times before being able to withdraw. As you can understand this has taken several days, so my only option was to wait additional seven days to even try Trustly. Although it is SO hard to keep yourself from touching the money just lying in the casino. So I ended up losing all of it. Of course this is what they know and counting on, thats why they make it so tough for you. My advice? Stay the h*ll away! There are so many better casinos!</p>
