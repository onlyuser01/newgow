    <h1>Casino Royale Cast Petoskey Casino Casino Indiana Cashman Casino Games Twin Pine Casino And Hotel Tu</h1>

<p>Hello everyone, I want to present my case and inquire a little about my experience in this strange 20Bet casino. A few days ago, I started playing in this casino, first I made my first deposit and then another one; through two credit cards. I also deposited cash through my registered Skrill and Netteller accounts. So far so good: suddenly a few days ago I started to win hugely at roulette, and in four days I already had more than 25,300 Swiss francs won; so i decided to withdraw 24,000. Before that check my cards, one was rejected and the other accepted. I sent bank statements of my credit cards, then I took a photo of my two credit cards. On the other hand, I sent screenshots of my registered Skrill and Netteller accounts, with this the support proceeded to verify my documents, so far so good. The problem began then when I requested to withdraw those 24,000 francs, thinking that everything was going well, that is, luxury, I stayed calm; Then, after a while, support sent me a few emails telling me without specifying much: your withdrawal request has been rejected, the reason: your cards have to show the recipient's name, digit numbers, etc. I say: either these are stupid or they play stupid; because first they verified my accounts since everything was clearer than water. Knowing that my accounts are fully registered in said casino, I sent the pertinent documents again today to see what nonsense I get this time. Continuing with my story, a while ago I also made a withdrawal of 23,000 Swiss Francs. Now it is only possible to wait for them to be sensible and comply by sending me the cash withdrawn; otherwise I will have to file a complaint to see if the casino deigns to do its job, which at the moment is not pleasant for me. In short, I am just waiting to see if they comply with their motto: withdrawals at 20bet casino are extremely fast within 24 hours. Gentlemen of the 20bet casino, I know that for one reason or another you will read the content of my comment, I urge you: do your duty, and do not be scamming people everywhere, there are already thousands of negative reviews on different websites. You do not know that you yourself are damaging by affecting your already decayed reputation; by acquiring so many negative reviews against it. After all, the scam is persecuted worldwide and of course; the boldest fish falls sooner or later into the net.</p>
