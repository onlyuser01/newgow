    <h1>Golden Nugget Casino Las Vegas Las Vegas Hotels Without Casino Salt Creek Casino Clearwater Casino C</h1>

<p>Dear Mark,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint and forwarding relevant screenshots. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. Before we’ll contact the casino and ask for their standpoint, could you please advise if you have sent more emails or requests for your account’s closure? If yes, please forward them to my email address petronela.k@casino.guru. Did you specify in those requests for how long you wish your account to be closed and why?</p>
<p>I have checked general terms and conditions on the website, and this is what I found https://www.wunderino.com/en/about/terms/#6-social-responsibility-and-self-protection:</p>
<p>„Self-Exclusion of the Player’s Account. A Self-Exclusion of the Player’s Account can have the following effective periods:</p>
<p>Six months ii One year iii. Five years iv. Permanently v. Indefinitely</p>
<p>An account that has been Self-Excluded for one of the above effective periods cannot be opened until the full effective period has elapsed, even if the Player wishes to do so. The Player is also able to Self-Exclude the Player's Account for an indefinite period of time. An account that has been Self-Excluded for an indefinite period of time can be reopened seven days after the Operator receives such a request.</p>
<p>The above Gaming Limitations are carried out by using the tools available in the Responsible Gambling section on the Site or by contacting Customer Service at the Site (Customer Service/Contact Us/Select Topic/Limits) or in writing. A requested Gaming Limitation will have effect immediately when using the tools in the player safety section or when a confirmation email from Customer Service is received by the Player."</p>
<p>Is this the email address that you have sent your email to?</p>
<p>hello@wunderino.com</p>
<p>I hope we will be able to help you to resolve this issue as soon as possible. Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
