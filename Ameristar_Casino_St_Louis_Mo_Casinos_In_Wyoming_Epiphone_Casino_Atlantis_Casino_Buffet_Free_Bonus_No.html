    <h1>Ameristar Casino St Louis Mo Casinos In Wyoming Epiphone Casino Atlantis Casino Buffet Free Bonus No</h1>

<p>The case is simple, and to inform i have sent an official complaint to their license issuer. But it seems to take no action yet. I want people to be aware of this.</p>
<p>I deposited amount 35$ on the casino, after that i needed my details arranged as KYC to play. My phone number got up as already in use. I was upfront with the casino and told them i had this issue, and if they could fix it. They sent the request to a department, and my money was sitting there unable to withdraw, play or wager (With one exception to a lucky wheel on their site, which i wagered 5$ on accident because i thought it was free, my bad)</p>
<p>I got a verdict from the casino saying my account was blocked for duplicate, which i wont judge them for saying as the phone number was already registered. Now i try to reason with the casino and ask for a withdrawal of remaining balance. They say they can't do that, but they can open one of the duplicate accounts but the funds need to be voided (Deleted). I said no, and asked kindly to withdraw remaining balance.</p>
<p>This has been going on for over a week, soon two. They keep using loophole to keep my money which is tied to no wager or bonus. I simply want my money back, and i respect their decission to keep both accounts closed due to money laundering regulations. I have good knowledge on the regulations regarding gambling under their lisence, but for some reason they refuse to even acknowledge that this superseeds their sketchy terms.</p>
<p>I want my money back, which is 30$, and simple. I kindly ask GURU to help with this, and the compensation for this issue is being handled by their license issuer later on.</p>
