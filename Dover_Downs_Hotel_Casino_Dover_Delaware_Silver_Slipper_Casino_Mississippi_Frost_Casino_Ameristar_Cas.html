<p>The continuously growing business-to-business (B2B) aggregation platform and iGaming provider, REEVO, signed a new content deal with the innovative provider of games for the online gambling industry, RubyPlay. The terms of the freshly minted agreement see the iGaming developer provide its portfolio of games for REEVO's aggregation platform.</p>
<p>Currently, RubyPlay offers more than 80 engaging slot games that deliver unique experiences. Thanks to the collaboration with REEVO, the iGaming developer's titles will be able to reach new audiences in different markets around the globe.</p>
<p>Dr Eyal Loz, RubyPlay's CPO, shared his excitement about the latest content deal in a statement. "We are thrilled to collaborate with a visionary B2B games provider like REEVO, and this partnership will undoubtedly amplify our global presence," he said. Additionally, Loz explained that the integration of the company's innovative games and tools into REEVO's platform will enable RubyPlay to deliver thrilling experiences to new customers. "Together, we are redefining the landscape of iGaming and setting new standards for excellence," he said in conclusion.</p>
<p>Petra Maria Poola, REEVO's Head of Sales, added: "Partnering with RubyPlay is another great stride for REEVO." Finally, she explained: "We are truly honored to onboard RubyPlay, and together, we aim to offer a diverse selection of captivating slot games and content, contributing to an enriched gaming experience for our operator partners and players alike."</p>
<p>While for RubyPlay, the collaboration will enable the company's games to reach new audiences, the deal also boosts REEVO's aggregation platform. Strengthening its offering, the leading aggregator continues to sign content agreements, allowing its platform to deliver unique and engaging games from leading iGaming providers. To ensure ease of access, REEVO's partners can tap into RubyPlay's leading games via a single API integration.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, REEVO signed a content deal with AvatarUX, an award-winning provider of slots. Per the terms of that collaboration, AvatarUX agreed to grant the operator access to its popular games. Under the terms of the agreement, popular games from the iGaming provider were added to REEVO's aggregation platform. That deal helped expand AvatarUX's range, allowing new customers and operators to access its thrilling games that feature the award-winning PopWins and MultiPop mechanics.</p>
<p>As a fast-growing aggregator, REEVO currently offers games from more than 70 leading providers of table, crash, slot and live casino titles. The company's aggregation platform brings more than 8,000 games. Earlier this year, REEVO confirmed that it anticipates signing more content agreements throughout the end of the year and beyond.</p>
