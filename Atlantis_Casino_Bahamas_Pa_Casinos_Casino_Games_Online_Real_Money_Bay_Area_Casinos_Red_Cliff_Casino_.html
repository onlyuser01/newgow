    <h1>Atlantis Casino Bahamas Pa Casinos Casino Games Online Real Money Bay Area Casinos Red Cliff Casino</h1>

<p>Saturday is not going to be like any other UFC Vegas event as both the main card and preliminary card are full of fights you would want to see. The bout between Arman Tsarukyan and Christos Giagos is one of those. Both fighters are on the main card and the odds back Tsarukyan overwhelmingly giving him a (-850) shot at winning the upcoming clash.</p>
<p>Then you have Giagos whose professional career has taken him through various ups and downs. Giagos is a heavy, heavy underdog posted at (+600) and his chances of a win look fairly slim. Giagos has only one lost fight in his five appearances in the UFC, and this is worth mentioning.</p>

<p>Tale of the Tape Tsarukyan vs Giagos</p>
<p>Christos Giagos Stats Arman Tsarukyan 5’10” Height 5’7″ 155 lbs Weight 155 lbs 71″ Reach 72″ Orthodox Stance Orthodox 19-8-0 Record 16-2-0</p>
<p>Giagos on a Winning Streak to Face off Unchallenged Tsarukyan</p>
<p>Giagos’ overall showing in the UFC has been patchy. He fought in nine Ultimate Fighting Championship events and won in five. His overall career stats is 19-8-0, and it’s safe to say that he has mileage behind his back. Fans definitely know Giagos who now has a chance to carry on with yet another victory in the promotion.</p>
<p>He has won both of his most recent fights against Carlton Minus and Sean Soriano. He submitted Soriano in less than a minute which revealed him as a determined and unapologetic fighter.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we have Arman Tsarukyan. The fighter has made a great impression in the UFC so far with a single loss in his debut fight against Islam Makhachev. Since then, he has been flying on a three-win streak which will now come to a test. In all three fights, Tsarukyan went the distance and fought five minutes.</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean that he is incapable of knocking down or submitting an opponent sooner – it just means that he would much rather bid his time than risk making a mistake. It’s a fighting style that is supposed to pay off dividends against Giagos. Whether this is the case would become clearer on Saturday.</p>
<p>We still see tremendous value in Giagos, though, as the fighter’s (+600) fight promises a tidy reward. The totals are (+150) for the fight going over two rounds, but the bookies seem to give much better odds to the fight concluding within the first two rounds.</p>
<p>Ideally, we would pick Totals Over 2 ½ rounds (+150) and Tsarukyan to win, although if pressed, we might put a small wager on Giagos as well.</p>
