<p>Ahead of the expected launch of sports betting in Massachusetts, the regulator in the state is currently reviewing license applications submitted by operators</p>
<p>Betr, a gambling venture backed by the famous boxer and social media star Jake Paul, was one of the operators that were reviewed by the gambling regulator in Massachusetts, the Massachusetts Gaming Commission (MGC).</p>
<p>The Regulator in Massachusetts Probes Betr</p>
<p>A recent report released by Sports Handle revealed that Betr made an important step forward in Massachusetts, considering that the regulator agreed that the sports betting operator meets the requirements for a license. During a meeting set by the MGC, Paul was questioned amid controversial reports that emerged regarding his persona. Responding to the probe, the famous social media star explained that with fame comes “unwarranted claims.”</p>
<p>Additionally, Paul said that although he has made mistakes, he learned from them. Most importantly, he added that he was never convicted of any crime and pointed out that nothing has come out of media allegations. Paul acknowledged that he has “a stellar reputation” and flagged that social media often spreads rumors that are untrue and have nothing in common with the real world.</p>
<p>“Little or nothing has come from these headlines. I’ve never been convicted of a crime, and as frustrating as they are, they have helped me to grow as a businessman and a person.“ Jake Paul, co-founder of Betr</p>
<p>MGC Continues Public Meetings</p>
<p>Eileen O’Brien, the MGC’s commissioner, explained that tough questions are asked because the regulator needs to ensure that applicants are suitable. She pointed out that it was exciting to see Betr’s application which included “a lot of detail about Massachusetts to a lot of detail on responsiveness and the product offering.” O’Brien reiterated that suitability is incredibly important, which is why the MGC is looking into the license applications submitted by all applicants very carefully.</p>
<p>Besides Betr, the MGC will continue to hold meetings, considering applications for Category 3 sports betting operator licenses from FanDuel, Bally’s, DraftKings, and other leading operators. Multiple public meetings will take place and afterward, the regulator is expected to unveil the final result.</p>
<p>Considering the licensing process is still ongoing, a solid date for the launch of the regulated sports betting market in Massachusetts is yet to be set. Still, it was hinted that retail betting may be launched near the end of this month, followed by a mobile betting rollout in March.</p>
