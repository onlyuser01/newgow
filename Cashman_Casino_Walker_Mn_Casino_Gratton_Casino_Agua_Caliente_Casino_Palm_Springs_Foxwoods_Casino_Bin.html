    <h1>Cashman Casino Walker Mn Casino Gratton Casino Agua Caliente Casino Palm Springs Foxwoods Casino Bin</h1>

<p>Hello everybody. So I have the following problem namely. Is it so that I have deposited 50 to 100 euros daily in this casino for the last 10 to 12 days. I have not even experienced it in this one with so much money and deposit that I came close to 100 euros as a profit. I deposited several times a day at different times of the day. I asked. That I must have deposited 300 or more just for the game sugar rush to play it. All these days. Got into free spins 4 or 5 times. With so many deposits. So never seen or experienced anything like this at any other casino. Also had absolutely no profit. So if I invest so much time and money. Then I also expect fun and free spins and winnings. I don't play for millions of euros. It's damn hard to win 400 or 500 euros here. Or win at least 200 euros. But the highest profit was just over 40 euros. But I deposited so much that I felt stupid myself. So really never experienced something close to that. They gave me a crap bonus of 5 to 8 euros from time to time where I even had to ask or beg soon. And tried different games 7nd on principle but I stuck to sugar rush just to see if anything happens to win or maybe I'm right there's something wrong. Then it happened. That I also deposited around 100 euros several times a day just for sugarusch and it actually didnâ€™t even go into the free spins and that too 4 to 5 days in a row. Then received and made a profit of 2 euros. I can cry at something like that. And I find that extremely strange and of course I feel cheated and fooled. Because I took extra this large period of time and money. And was gutted like a Christmas goose. Really sad and bitter because I have always liked to play 8n this casino, in my opinion something was wrong there. Very funny.</p>
