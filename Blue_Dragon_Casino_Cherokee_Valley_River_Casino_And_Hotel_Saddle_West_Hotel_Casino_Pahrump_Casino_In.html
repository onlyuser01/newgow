<p>Miriam Adelson’s Affinity For President Trump Literally Reaches Biblical Proportions</p>

<p>Miriam Adelson, the wife of Las Vegas Sands Chairman and CEO Sheldon Adelson, has long been a fan of President Trump. That affection appears to be reaching biblical proportions.</p>

<p>In a recent column in the Las Vegas Review-Journal, the paper she and her husband co-own, Miriam Adelson brings up the idea of the Bible adding a “Book of Trump.”</p>
<p>Would it be too much to pray for a day when the Bible gets a ‘Book of Trump,’ much like it has a ‘Book of Esther’ celebrating the deliverance of the Jews from ancient Persia?” she opined.</p>
<p>In addition to the Review-Journal, Adelson also included Israel Hayom, an Israeli daily newspaper that she owns, in the column’s byline. That paper has been criticized by rival publications for being too kind to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</p>
<p>Adelson, 73, was born in Israel and has citizenship there and the US. Following the recent transfer of a massive amount of Las Vegas Sands shares from her husband into her name, Miriam Adelson became Israel’s richest person with an estimated net worth of $22 billion.</p>
<p>Overt Adulation</p>
<p>Adelson is an ardent backer of her native country and is rumored to have previously said she would have moved back to Israel permanently if not for finding love with her casino mogul husband, whom she married in 1991. Adelson’s support for Israel appears to be the driving factor for her esteem of President Trump.</p>
<p>“Under his watch, America has finally made good on its decades-old pledge to formally recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and move the U.S. Embassy there,” Adelson wrote. “In another service to historical justice, Trump declared the Golan Heights to be Israeli territory, and in service to the security of Israel and the whole world, he withdrew the United States from a nuclear deal with Iran that was a contemporary echo of the Munich Agreement.”</p>
<p>In addition to calling Trump a “patriot,” Adelson ponders why Trump does not enjoy more support among American Jews while noting the president is well-liked in Israel.</p>
<p>During the 2016 presidential election, just 24 percent of American Jews supported Trump, the lowest percentage given to a Republican candidate since the 19 percent of the Jewish vote garnered by George W. Bush in 2000, according to Pew Research.</p>
<p>For her part, Adelson seems optimistic that Trump can make some inroads with the US Jewish community ahead of the 2020 election.</p>
<p>Don’t Bet on Book of Trump</p>
<p>There isn’t going to be “Book of Trump,” and that isn’t a comment on his politics. In an interview with USA Today, Dr. Joel M. Hoffman, a Jewish Bible scholar, said “there is no way to add another book to the Jewish Bible.”</p>
<p>Book or no book, Adelson’s support of Trump is undaunted. She and her husband have already donated $10 million to the president’s 2020 reelection effort.</p>
<p>While historians and political pundits will likely have a field day with the Trump Administration, whether that era ends in 2020 or 2024, Adelson boils her faith in the current US president down to simple terms.</p>
<p>She views Trump as a man of his word when it comes to policy with Israel, lauds the president for quitting the Iran nuclear deal and a Middle East peace process she deemed a “sewer,” and called her native country the best of the US allies.</p>
