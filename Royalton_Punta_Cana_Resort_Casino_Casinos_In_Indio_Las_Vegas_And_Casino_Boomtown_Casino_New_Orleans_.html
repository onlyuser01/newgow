    <h1>Royalton Punta Cana Resort Casino Casinos In Indio Las Vegas And Casino Boomtown Casino New Orleans</h1>

<p>One of the fastest-expanding iGaming suppliers in Europe, Gaming Corps, has signed a new partnership that will allow it to consolidate its presence in the Italian market and also strengthen its reach with local audiences.</p>
<p>The company has teamed up with Octavian Lab, which is an aggregator platform which will make it much easier for Gaming Corps to find local partners and provide them with a variety of innovative and established content titles.</p>
<p>Gaming Corps is known for genres such as plinko, crash, table, slot, and mine. In addition, the game has already developed an outstanding selection of games that are cited as player-favorite choices across multiple jurisdictions and offer real value to players in terms of innovative mechanics and gameplay opportunities.</p>
<p>Among the games on the list are choices such as Coin Miner, 777 Jackpot DiamondHold and Win, Plinko, PenaltyChampion, WildWoof, and so many others. Octavian Lab is also a prominent and respected aggregation solution, having brought many successful iGaming suppliers to market and has allowed them to quickly gather momentum in the local market in Italy.</p>
<p>Octavian Lab CEO Emanuele Nocentelli has welcomed this new opportunity and said that his company will make it possible for Gaming Corps to increase its footprint like never before. "I look forward to working with them and I am very pleased our platform will host Gaming Corps’ innovative content," Nocentelli concluded.</p>
<p>The news was welcome by Gaming Corps CCO Danielle Calafato who was similarly pleased with the success of this new tie-up and what it would mean for the company moving forward. Calafato welcomed the opportunity to be working with Octavian Lab as its latest partner.</p>
<p>"We’re genuinely delighted to be able to offer our games via its gaming aggregator platform," she noted, arguing that Octavian Lab was indeed an ideal partner for the company as it seeks to increase its distribution capacity across Europe.</p>
<p>Gaming Corps has been in the meantime strengthening its reach in the region and beyond after the company received the go-ahead from the Latvian Lotteries and Gambling Supervisory Inspection at the end of June.</p>
<p>Gaming Corps has also formed another aggregation content alliance with QTech, a company that focuses on emerging markets in Asia, and which makes a great partner as the supplier pursues further growth opportunities.</p>
