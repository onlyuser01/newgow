    <h1>Midnight Rose Hotel And Casino Best Online Casino For Real Money Funclub Casino Login Paradice Casin</h1>

<p>Hacksaw Gaming has been one of the fastest-expanding iGaming suppliers across the United States, with the company recently obtaining a New Jersey license, and now delivering on it. The company has teamed up with DraftKings, a well-represented sports betting and online casino in the Garden State, and will deliver its range of titles to the company.</p>
<p>DraftKings and the company’s players will benefit from outstanding experiences, and specifically the unique Dare2Win titles, such as Mines and Boxes, but also many of the studio’s more linear but still exciting Chaos Crew and OmNom games. Not only that, but the first ten titles released with DraftKings are now available exclusively with DraftKings during the first two weeks of rollout.</p>
<p>Hacksaw Gaming CEO Marcus Cordes has welcomed this new opportunity and said that he was very excited to see his company continue to increase its presence in the regulated market in the United States. The company’s hard work is going to see Hacksaw Gaming expand in other jurisdictions locally, including Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Hacksaw Gaming only acquired its license a week ago, and it has already been delivering on it. So far, the supplier's forays into the United States have been modest, but Cordes is confident that his company will soon be picking up the delivery pace.</p>
<p>Hacksaw Gaming has also been operating well beyond the United States iGaming market, which is still only getting started. The company has been able to collaborate on other important and interesting content opportunities with NetBet and Eurobet in Italy.</p>
<p>The supplier similarly expanded its international reach through another tie-up with REEVO, seeking to join the aggregation solution and make sure that it delivers the best possible games to global audiences. Not least, Hacksaw Gaming pivoted towards the Eastern European market with an entry in Bulgaria, and expanding its reach in the fast-evolving region.</p>
