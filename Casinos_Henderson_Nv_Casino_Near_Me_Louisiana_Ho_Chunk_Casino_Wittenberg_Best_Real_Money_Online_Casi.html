<p>So what well being!? And why confisticate my money if I won this fair and square and didnt break any rules. Like I said yesterday if they want to close my account for whatever made up reason fine by me but why confesticate my money?. They have no right to do that for I didnt break any rule. I was a new member at that casino, verified. Didnt had any SE at any other brand casino.</p>
<p>Its just a scam.</p>
<p>So whenever you win big they just say oh we close your account because of the wellbeing of the player and confesticate your money. That is easy .. so they will never pay out your winnings?</p>
<p>But for me mentioning all the casino's of the same brand is as a warning. Because I see more complaints similiar problems but same brand casino's.</p>
<p>You win big and problems comes.</p>
