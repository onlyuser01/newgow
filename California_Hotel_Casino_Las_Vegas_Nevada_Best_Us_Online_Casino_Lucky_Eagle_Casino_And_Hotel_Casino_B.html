<p>For the next 18 months, Betsson will be the main front-of-shirt sponsor of the famous soccer team from Argentine, helping the company expand further its presence in the region</p>
<p>The leading holding company that invests and manages fast-growing operators within the online gambling vertical, Betsson AB, expanded its Latin American-facing presence by announcing a new sponsorship agreement. The company has announced it became the primary front-of-shirt sponsor for Boca Juniors, a popular sports club headquartered in La Boca, Buenos Aires, Argentine.</p>
<p>Details regarding the new sponsorship agreement were released Sunday during a testimonial game with the legendary soccer player Juan Roman Riquelme called “Para Toda La Vida,” SBC News reveals. The game, which was attended by Lionel Messi, was played at the La Bombonera Stadium.</p>
<p>Besides the famous soccer players, Betsson’s CEO, Jesper Svensson, also attended the event. He commented that the Para Toda La Vida match is famous among soccer fans and Boca Juniors’ growing fan base. Speaking about soccer and sports, the CEO added: “The sport and soccer, in particular, are in Betsson’s DNA; That’s why not we could be left out of such a significant and important for the club with the most titles and most popular in Argentina.”</p>
<p>“This is a historic match that will remain engraved in the hearts of all Boca Juniors fans and soccer lovers.“ Jesper Svensson, CEO of Betsson</p>
<p>The new sponsorship agreement further boosts Betsson’s growing presence in Argentina. Additionally, it helps the company’s expansion within the Latin American region as well, after signing similar sponsorship deals only recently.</p>
<p>Although financial details regarding such sponsorship deals are not disclosed publicly, Boca Juniors’ sponsorship is evaluated at some $7.5 million. Thanks to the new deal, Betsson will position its logo on the front of the shirt of the team’s matchday kits.</p>
<p>Reportedly, the collaboration is effective for the next year and a half. The sponsorship agreement with Betsson marks an important achievement for Boca Juniors. This is because the team did not have a front-of-shirt sponsor since last year in July and has now found a strong partner in the face of Betsson.</p>
