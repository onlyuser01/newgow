<p>The police are looking for three men who tried to break into a casino in Endike Lane, Hull, and fled the scene when the officers arrived at the scene.</p>
<p>The Humberside Police have issued an appeal to locals who might have doorbell footage or witness information to share in regard to a report concerning an attempted burglary on Endike Lane in Hull.</p>
<p>Attempted Burglary During the Night</p>
<p>The incident took place in the early hours of Tuesday, November 14. At around 4:30 am, the police were called to investigate a claim from a local resident that three men were trying to gain entry into Merkur Slots casino using power tools.</p>
<p>It was the sound of the said power tools that woke up the Good Samaritan who most likely saved the casino from what could have brought them some serious damage.</p>
<p>Officers were deployed to the casino located on Endike Lane. Upon their arrival, the trio managed to flee the scene in a white BMW. He is believed to have traveled in the direction of 21st Avenue towards Cranbrook Avenue. The other two potential burglars are believed to have run toward Greenwood Avenue.</p>
<p>The authorities have made an appeal to anyone who possesses any kind of information in relation to the case, including dash cam or CCTV footage in the area nearby to assist them with their inquiries by contacting them on their non-emergency number 101 quoting log 35 of 14 November.</p>
<p>Anyone who has information on the three suspects and wishes to remain anonymous can alternatively get in touch with Crimestoppers by calling 0800 555 111.</p>
<p>$1 Million in Casino Chips Stolen from Genting Highlands</p>
<p>At the start of the month, we reported on a $1 million casino theft at Genting Highlands that resulted in 10 people being detained.</p>
<p>Genting Highlands is a top-tier gaming and entertainment property operated by leading gaming company Genting Malaysia. The thieves broke into the room where the casino chips worth around $1 million were stored on October 28, which led to the police being notified of the break-in.</p>
<p>The investigation is still ongoing, and the authorities refrained from disclosing any extra information on the case details. The version of an inside job was not, however, ruled out.</p>
<p>Ex-Police Officer Sentenced for Casino Heists</p>
<p>Last month, an ex-police officer in Las Vegas was sentenced for a series of casino heists at three major casinos in Sin City that resulted in the theft of over $160,000 between November 2021 and February 2022.</p>
<p>Caleb M. Rogers received a 12-year federal prison sentence by US District Judge Andrew P. Gordon, at the end of a shocking trial that revealed the casino robberies.</p>
<p>Apparently, Rogers wore dark clothes, black latex gloves, and a face mask while executing the robberies with amazing precision.</p>
