    <h1>7Bit Casino 75 Free Spins Hotels Near Sky River Casino Seneca Niagara Casino Promotions Shooting Sta</h1>

<p>Ladies and Gentlemen</p>
<p>I've been playing in the N1 group for several years and in the DAMA LV group for about 1 year. Here I have almost always had positive experiences and I really enjoy playing in casinos such as e.g. Oshi.io, 7Bit, Bitkingz, Fastpay and many more.</p>
<p>Over time I have made a lot of deposits, some of which are high (don't worry, the money I'm gambling away, even if it's significantly more than others, isn't a problem for me). My account is verified at all the casinos where I play and the payouts have never been a problem. Due to the sometimes high stakes that I play, I have of course also had high "hits" from time to time, such as around €30,000 at Oshi and €25,000 at 7Bit. Payouts were never a problem here and went smoothly. Of course, the counter-calculation plus and minus is negative for me too, but you have to accept that when you play.</p>
<p>Now on Tuesday 4/21/2023 I had a very enjoyable evening at Fastpay Casino. That night I got extremely lucky in two games and was able to get two nice hits at high revs. I had already worked my way up to around €12,000 and then had a "hit" in the free spins in Bomb Bonanza with a €50 bet of around €28,000. Shortly thereafter I changed the game and at Fruitparty 2, even without free spins, I had a "hit" of around €18,500. So I had a balance of about €58,000 in my account.</p>
<p>Of course you can imagine the joy.</p>
<p>Since I have only had good experiences with Fastpay so far and my account is fully verified, I was able to request the first payout. The first payout of €4800 and the next two payouts of €5000 each came without any problems, just as I am used to with the DAMA LV Group.</p>
<p>Then an email came with the following content:</p>
<p>Hello Frank Winnewisser!</p>
<p>Please, be informed that your account will be closed according to the p.3.6 of our T&amp;C:</p>
<p>3.6 Fastpay Casino reserves the right to refuse the service (and to close the account) to the visitor, without explaining the reasons.</p>
<p>https://fastpay-access.com/en/terms-and-conditions</p>
<p>After withdrawal of your balance your account will be closed finally, unfortunately.</p>
<p>Please, do not create new accounts in the casino.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>FastPay casino team.</p>
<p>I was surprised by this email, but even in Las Vegas, casinos can ban customers who are too lucky at the casino in question.</p>
<p>I would have loved to continue playing in Fastpay and I would certainly have gambled away some of my winnings.</p>
<p>The email clearly stated that the account would be closed once the entire payment had been made.</p>
<p>So I paid out my remaining balance (€43,000) over 8 x €5,000 and 1 x €3,000 and the payments were confirmed. After that I couldn't log in to the casino anymore.</p>
<p>I've been waiting for all the payments since Saturday, March 25th, 2023.</p>
<p>I am in contact with the casino and they wanted a statement from my account from 03/15/2023 - 04/04/2023, which I provided yesterday morning.</p>
<p>The nice employees made an effort and always wrote to me not to worry and to pass it on to the finance department and I would receive information.</p>
<p>Since I haven't received any feedback since noon yesterday, even after asking twice, I thought I'd ask you for your opinion and ask for your help, since I've selected all the casinos I play through your website.</p>
<p>No bonus or free spins have ever been used by me</p>
<p>I don't have duplicate accounts</p>
<p>I never used a VPN</p>
<p>I have already received several payouts from the casino (so my account is fully verified and confirmed)</p>
<p>So far I've only had good experiences with DAMA LV, recommended it to others, uploaded winning videos and given very good reviews.</p>
<p>I would like to say explicitly that I am NOT upset, just because of the high amount and the fact that my account has now been closed and the payouts have been very quick so far, I want the matter to be clarified quickly and I do not want to be put off for long with the high payout.</p>
<p>A part of this profit will anyway be reinvested in the DAMA LV Group or N1 Group.</p>
<p>Even with this small issue at the moment I would like to remain loyal to the group, I have no grudges, but I would like the matter to be clarified at short notice and receive the payments.</p>
<p>I look forward to your feedback/help.</p>
<p>I wish you a pleasant evening and send many greetings</p>
<p>Frank Winnewisser</p>
