    <h1>Caesars Casino Promo Code Casino In Canada Are There Casinos In Texas Aria Hotel And Casino American</h1>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>my name is Ana TCL99 have failed to honor my withdrawal of $4010.53 that was apparently made via osko from their commonwealth bank account on the 22nd of December @ 11.48 pm EST i didn't receive the payment instantly so i enquired with their chat BOT (because its the same reply over and over) as to which i was told that i was a first time payees so it was being held for 24hrs due to security reasons. It didn't sit right with me cause i had made a withdrawal with them previously so i entered the account number on their dodgy receipt into my banks pay anyone section and it said invalid bsb and account number. i enquired with the chat bot again when i was told that their account is restricted. i asked what that meant for me and the reply was they could not access their account at that moment due to being restricted but as soon as they verify they will look into it. but assured the payment went through. if everything was legit it should of hit my account exactly 24hrs later which was 11.48pm 23/12/2023 regardless of it being a weekend or public holiday. why i know this i made a withdrawal of $805.26 at AUBOSS1 casino on the 27/12/2023 @ 2am it was held 24 hours for security reasons then at 1pm the same day the 27th of dec i made another withdrawal from AUBOSS at 1.11pm of $3151.20 which they had to scrape up to pay me but they did and honored my withdrawal. Before the 24hrs security hold was up AUBOSS contacted me to inform me they were having issues with there bank and they had to cancel the $805 transfer and resend so i would know the time it should hit my bank because it will be 8 hours late. however the $3151 transfer hit my bank exactly 24 hours later and they were honest enough to tell me they had to pull money from a heap of different accounts. TCL99 however keep saying that they have sent the money and its my bank. thegreater bank has informed me its not them but their bank. I seen while i was researching TCL99 a man from Australia with an identical story as mine so i wont be waiting another day. Since this all began i have been writing all of TCL"s PAYID AND BANK ACCOUNT NUMBERS DOWN And i make a promise to TCL99 and the other casinos they are affiliated with that i will personally call every bank their payids are with and put them in to the fraud squad until they have no option to shut down. IT is going to cost them more than the the $4010 they ripped from me in lost revenue because it dont take a genius to see which casinos they Also own. TO all those Australians that are assisting them by supplying them with a Australian name and details etc for them to funtion as a unregistered casino You should rethink ya job.</p>
<p>Even if TCL99 bans me from their casino i have lots of people in there already good luck finding them.</p>
<p>IT may seem like i'm using blackmail to get my withdrawal but TBH thats the only LANGUAGE these crooks may understand. HEY DEAR ðŸ˜˜ TALK SOON DEAR</p>
