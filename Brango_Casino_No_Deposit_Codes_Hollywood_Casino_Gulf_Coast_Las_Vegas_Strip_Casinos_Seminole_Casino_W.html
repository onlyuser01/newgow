    <h1>Brango Casino No Deposit Codes Hollywood Casino Gulf Coast Las Vegas Strip Casinos Seminole Casino W</h1>

<p>I have requested 2 deposits from this casino-one for $100 on 6/24, which was confirmed, and another one for $200 on 6/27, which is still being "Verified". Then I get a message from their banking department stating that my bitcoin address is not going to work for payment. The exact message said "The crypto address you provided is a cash based crypto address which we cannot use as your payment method."</p>
<p>I find this rather odd, as I used the exact same address to deposit to this casino. The address I submitted is a Cashapp BTC address. I called Cashapp customer service, and was told this address is sufficient for payment.</p>
<p>The first $100 was won from welcome free spins, and I satisfied all requirements for that payout. The second was from a deposit.</p>
