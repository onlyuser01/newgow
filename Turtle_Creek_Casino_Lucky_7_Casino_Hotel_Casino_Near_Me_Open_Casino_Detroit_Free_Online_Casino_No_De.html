<p>The leading supplier of online games, powering the global gambling industry, EGT Digital, announced a new deal, growing its footprint in Europe. The company confirmed on Friday it joined forces with Microgame, entering the regulated gambling sector in Italy. Teaming up with the company, EGT Digital's games will significantly grow its reach, engaging with new audiences and operators.</p>
<p>This will be achieved via Microgame's extensive partner network with titles from EGT Digital arriving for 35 betting sites. The new content agreement represents an important leap for the iGaming content supplier as it expands the number of players who have access to their quality games.</p>
<p>Only recently, EGT Digital expanded once again its global footprint by teaming up with Vbetin Armenia. Per that deal, the iGaming content supplier agreed to power the operator with its offering available via www.vbet.am. As a result, Vbet customers gained access to thrilling games provided by the Bulgarian iGaming content supplier.</p>
<p>Marco Bedendo, Microgame's COO, was thrilled about the freshly minted content agreement with EGT Digital. "Being the first in Italy to offer EGT Digitalâ€™s titles in our portfolio is an expression of our constant strive to always be at the forefront of the market and reflects our constant commitment to provide the Italian operators and players with a wide and continuously updated portfolio of games," he explained in a statement.</p>
<p>Zornitsa Boncheva, EGT Digital's Regional Manager for Italy, added that the company is honored to forge this new alliance. She spoke about Microgame's strong position in Italy, confirming that they represent the perfect partner for EGT Digital.</p>
<p>Per the terms of the new agreement, Microgame's partners and their clients will be able to access Bell Link, EGT Digital's bestselling jackpot. Games that will grow their reach include fan-favorite titles such as Burning Hot Bell Link, Flaming Hot Bell Link and Shining Crown Bell Link, among others.</p>
<p>Boncheva spoke about the company's bestselling jackpot explaining: "Bell Link is already widely popular in many countries around the world and has demonstrated excellent results so far." Finally, she said: "That is why I am confident that it will fully satisfy the preferences of local players as well and will quickly rank among their favorites, which will pave the way for our next highly-potential gaming proposals."</p>
