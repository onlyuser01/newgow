    <h1>Huuuge Casino Slots Vegas 777 Hard Rock Tampa Casino Rincon Casino In San Diego Online Casino Bettin</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I want to inform you about my issue with 888Casino Team! on 02/04/2022 they approved and transferred my winnings to my bank account via Wire Transfer, the amount is 83.85 USD. After waiting 7 business days for getting my money in my bank account there was nothing on it. I contacted my bank and they said that the intermediary bank canceled this wire transfer, then I contacted the 888casino Transactions Team to investigate this issue but they are saying that they approved this transaction and can not see cancelation from their side. I requested an investigation that Casino should find information from their bank, just why the intermediary bank canceled the transaction and it is stuck, never back to them and also never came to me!</p>
<p>They do not have an exact answer about this and do not do anything for 14 days after my request!</p>
<p>Please help me in this matter to get information on what is going on it!</p>
