    <h1>William Hill Casino Twin Arrows Navajo Casino Resort Resort Boulevard Flagstaff Az Fortune Bay Resor</h1>

<p>Hello Kristina,</p>
<p>thank you for your message and for approving my complaint.</p>
<p>Yes, you are right. I only received 50 free spins from the 200 normally promised in the deposit bonus terms.</p>
<p>I have contacted the chat first time and i talked to Arthur. I asked him how to use the next 50 free spins parts but all he was telling me is that i cannot play them because i do not have money on my balance. He also proposed me a bonus of 150 % if i deposit, which of course i declined.</p>
<p>In this casino, you cannot log into a game if your balance is 0, and it is written nowhere in their terms of the bonus that we need to have balance to play free spins. For me, it is a fraud to offer free spins bonus in 4 parts if you cannot log into the game if you lose the first part.</p>
<p>I connected to the casino the following day to see if the problem was fixed but no, i still could not log into the game. I contacted chat again and it was Alice this time. I got same answer, she proposed me to deposit only 5 euros so i can play the free spins. I declined of course, i do not have to make another deposit to be able to play a previous bonus .</p>
<p>I then went to write my complain here. After that, i prevented them that i have posted a complaint on your site.</p>
<p>A couple minutes later, i received a mail from the support, here it is:</p>
<p>Dear customer,</p>
<p>The second deposit bonus with free spins has the following conditions:</p>
<p>50 free spins in {game_name} on your second deposit</p>
<p>The maximum win amount with an active bonus is 250 EUR/USD or equivalent in account currency</p>
<p>Wagering: 40x bonus sum</p>
<p>Maximum bet: 5 EUR/USD or equivalent in account currency</p>
<p>Bonus expired in 7 days.</p>
<p>Please provide us a screenshot of when you were promised free spins and for which bonus exactly.</p>
<p>This is all crap because the bonus clearly mentionned we have 200 free spins in several parts.</p>
<p>I replied them this:</p>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>i have been talking with your support for like 2 days about it, do not act like you do not know anything.</p>
<p>You know your bonuses, no need to explain you.</p>
<p>On 2nd deposit bonus, we were awarded 200 free spins, 50 per day in a period of 7 days. You can see the bonus still active in my account. There is no need to cancel it by the way i already took screenshots.</p>
<p>I connected the other day to play my next 50 free spins but since my balance was 0, it is impossible to log in the game. So why propose free spins bonuses if players cannot log in the games to play them. So i have to deposit again to be able to play my bonus i received from the previous deposit bonus ? This is a fraud.</p>
<p>My complaint has been submitted on Guru, i wait it is approved so we talk there. I want to put your mark there more down and to prevent players of your inacceptable behaviour and scam.</p>
<p>Once this is done, you will be denounced to the swiss gambling commission as well so all swiss players are blocked from your site, just like i did about your luckycrypto casino. Do not worry, it just takes time to be put in place but it sure will, time will tell you.</p>
<p>You should be ashamed to act like that just for free spins lol.</p>
<p>The replied me this:</p>
<p>The 200 free spins which are part of the welcome bonus set will be added in installments of 50 free spins over 4 days (if the player has access to this bonus and has fulfilled all the conditions for receiving it). The first 50 free spins will be added as soon as you deposit, and then 50 more every 24 hours until all 200 free spins have been awarded. Please note that canceling any part of the welcome bonus at any stage will also result in the cancellation of all subsequent parts of the bonus under this offer.</p>
<p>I replied this:</p>
<p>Hello again,</p>
<p>every condition was met, the 200 free spins are normally on my account. This is not the problem, the problem is that you block access to games for players when the balance is 0, so it some other words players cannot play their free spins bonus, so you are a scam.</p>
<p>See you on guru, that is all i will say, since you are always responding witha copy paste i already explained.</p>
<p>From this mail, i had no answers.</p>
<p>I will send you screenshots of the concerns to your mail so you can check yourself the bonus terms and that it shows me deposit page when i try to log into the game to play my free spins. I will also send you the bonus buy section which is really suspicious: echange 1000 points for 10 euros and 50000 for 50 euros, it is nonsense.</p>
<p>Thank you for your future reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>mrmileena</p>
