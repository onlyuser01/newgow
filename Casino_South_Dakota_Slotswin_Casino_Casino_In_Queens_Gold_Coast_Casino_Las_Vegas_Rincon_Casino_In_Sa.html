    <h1>Casino South Dakota Slotswin Casino Casino In Queens Gold Coast Casino Las Vegas Rincon Casino In Sa</h1>

<p>I joined the casino I think in July 2022.</p>
<p>The account has not been active since April 18, when Block was implemented for Germans after my complaint, this is the admission that fairspin made a mistake.I had balance of 0.015 BNB.Yes, I requested self-exclusion and closure of the account, my request was ignored and instead of being respected, they urged me to take further actions.</p>
<p>In a crisis of addiction later after I was misled that there is no restriction in Germany from the main license I filed again, however I kindly note that:</p>
<p>if they had respected my request, it is reasonable to assume that subsequent deposits would have been prevented and therefore these losses would have been prevented.In other words, while I communicated with them, they additionally asked me to send an email, ignoring my request and causing me trouble. "And I ask you to close my account as after research today I found that your service cannot be offered legally as I ask you from today to include Germany in your terms as a country that you do not accept as a customer as this creates confusion and intentional deception of Germans of your users, i.e. intentional deception."The casino was aimed at the German market and had a page in German, while stating that German players were welcome.. it did not take any measures to keep Germans out instead they came out saying that German players are welcome unlike me who am a consumer them . they knew that they would not be able to legally offer their services in Germany, this is called willful blindness or deception. Therefore, the research I did about the situation was based on the fact that two large forums gave the sense of legitimacy, as well as fairspin itself claiming that it can legitimately offer its service, which is not the case. Therefore, the exhortation German players accepted is a misleading statement that aims to mislead the German player who happens to be a consumer and should receive the protection. I was informed about this when I went to play a game and this message appeared.So I started researching what actually applies.In my communications with the casino, the casino stated the following:17 März 2023</p>
<p>As it was said before there is no refunds according to the fact that you used your funds in games , also you agreed T&amp;C of our website and responsible for the actions that you did (even if it is violation of your country legislation) due to the information that your country is not restricted to our licensee. Thank you for your request, we wish you good day!</p>
<p>Another’s statement:«You have violated limit deposits 1000 Euro and us I understand you don’t have license to accept Germ...»— According to the Terms and conditions there is not restrictions from our licensee for German players. Still you have to pay attention to the legislation of YOUR country, cause during the registration you confirmed that read and agreed T&amp;C and You are responsible for your actions.</p>
<p>Am 04.05.2023 legal department fairspin statement.</p>
<p>· He was informed, that our list of Restricted Jurisdictions includes the following: .. Germany, (the "Restricted Jurisdictions").</p>
<p>Here, fairspin mentions that Germany according to its terms was a country of restriction , this is a false statement which aims to mislead . Also, I have all the evidence that Germany was presented as a border country after April 17, therefore it is a false statement with the aim of deceiving .</p>
<p>· He will take legal responsibility and bear liability for compliance with the legislation applicable to him and confirm that a bank or payment service provider who is processing any of his deposit or withdrawal transactions shall not be liable for any violation of the laws and legislation applicable to him.</p>
<p>· Fairspin is not be liable for any loss, costs, expenses or damages, whether direct, indirect, special, consequential, incidental or otherwise, arising in relation to his use of the Websites or his participation in the Games.</p>
<p>· He fully indemnifies and hold harmless Fairspin, its directors, employees, partners, and service providers for any cost, expense, loss, damages, claims and liabilities howsoever caused that may arise in relation to His use of the Website or participation in the Games.</p>
<p>· The Games are organized from Curaçao and his participation therein takes place within the aforementioned territory. Any contractual relationships between him and Fairspin shall be deemed to have been entered into and performed by the parties in Curacao, at the registered address of Fairspin, under the laws of Curaçao. Any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or in connection with T&amp;Cs, or the breach, termination or invalidity thereof, shall be submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of courts of Curacao.</p>
<p>Thus, via using our services the Player have breached our internal rules that prohibit using fairspin.io by German citizens, and, apparently, local legislation applicable to the Player allegations.</p>
