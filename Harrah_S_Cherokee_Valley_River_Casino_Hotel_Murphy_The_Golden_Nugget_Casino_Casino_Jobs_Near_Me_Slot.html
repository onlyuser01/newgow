    <h1>Harrah S Cherokee Valley River Casino Hotel Murphy The Golden Nugget Casino Casino Jobs Near Me Slot</h1>

<p>In December of 2022 I Made a deposit that included free spins, with the terms being max win from free spins is $150, I was up to over 700, but was able to withdraw $400 with no issues, I had won very early and did not have to use bonus money, clearly I believe was and is that the max winnings from free spins was capped at $150, but after wage requirements were met there was no term saying max cashout had any limit.</p>
<p>But this time with the exact same type bonus and terms, there system took $1,698 of my winnings, once again I had won early and was using real money first. I don't see how this is fair or legal. It clearly says max winnings from free spins is $150, it states no where that there was a max cashout!</p>
<p>I have asked casino for an explanation but they have gave me none whatsoever.</p>
