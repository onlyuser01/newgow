<p>The reigning NBA champions Golden State Warriors are coming to Texas on Wednesday, March 22, to take on the Dallas Mavericks at American Airlines Center</p>
<p>Neither team has secured their place in the postseason, and with only a few weeks left before the end of the regular season, they need to switch to the top gear. Thatâ€™s one of the reasons why we expect to see a real thriller in Dallas on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Other reasons include the fact that Luka Doncic might finally return after missing five games, that the Warriorsâ€™ superstars are in a 3-pointer-scoring mood, and so on.</p>

<p>Golden State Warriors Hate Playing on the Road</p>
<p>On Monday evening, the Golden State Warriors finally ended their horrible streak of 11 straight losses on the road. They defeated the Houston Rockets 121-108 in an away game. We saw Steph Curry and Klay Thompson scoring five 3-pointers each in that game, but their teammates did not do much.</p>
<p>Beating the worst team in the Western Conference isnâ€™t much of an achievement, but the victory came at the right moment for Steve Kerrâ€™s boys. Itâ€™s given them a massive confidence boost ahead of another game in Texas.</p>
<p>Steph Curry led the Warriors to their FIRST road win since January 30th with 30 points against the Rockets ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥</p>

<p>This is going to be a much harder game, but they got the motivation to give their utmost on Wednesday. They need to win to make another step toward securing their spot in the playoffs. Right now, theyâ€™re 37-36, sitting in the No. 6 position in the Western Conference standings, and in the fourth spot in the Pacific Division.</p>
<p>Their divisional rivals Los Angeles Lakers look like a team that could ruin their plans. Theyâ€™re just two wins behind the Warriors with one game in hand. That said, unless the Warriors switch up a gear, they could be in trouble.</p>
<p>Luka Doncic Might Return for Dallas Mavericks</p>
<p>Dallas Mavericksâ€™ talisman Luka Doncic missed the last five games due to a thigh injury, but he could come back to the court on Wednesday. In his absence, his team went 2-3 with one of those two wins happening in overtime. The game in question was the one against the San Antonio Spurs, the second-worst team in the Western Conference.</p>
<p>"Heâ€™s gonna be day-to-day with this thigh injuryâ€¦He could be back as soon as their next game."</p>

<p>They definitely need Doncic to help them secure their playoff future. At the moment, theyâ€™re 36-36, but they got a relatively easy schedule ahead. There are many easily-winnable games on their fixture list, but the one on Wednesday isnâ€™t one of them.</p>
<p>Still, they shouldnâ€™t be afraid of the Warriors, as they got a very good record against this opponent, especially in games played in Texas. At American Airlines Center in Dallas, the Mavericks are 7-3 in their last 10 duels with the Warriors.</p>
<p>Golden State Warriors vs. Dallas Mavericks Prediction</p>
<p>We think that the outcome of this game will depend on Luka Doncic. If he returns (and is able to play the whole game), the Mavericks are going to win. Although thereâ€™s no official confirmation, there are reports suggesting that heâ€™s almost 100% fit.</p>
<p>Pick: Dallas Mavericks to win</p>
