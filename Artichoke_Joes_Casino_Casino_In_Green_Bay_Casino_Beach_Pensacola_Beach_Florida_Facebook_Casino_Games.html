<p>William Hill Sees Red Following Australian Regulatory Changes, Hopeful for US Sports Betting Market Expansion</p>

<p>William Hill Australia has been negatively impacted by the country’s ban on credit betting, which came into force earlier this month.</p>
<p>This has led the group to dramatically reassess the value of its Australian assets, reporting a £238 million ($333 million) impairment charge. Also known as a book-value reduction, this is a non-cash charge that is nevertheless reported as an expense, thereby reducing net income. The bookmaker showed a £221 million($308.6 million) loss in Australia last year, before interest and tax.</p>
<p>Chief Executive Philip Bowcock said during an earnings call on Friday morning that the Australian business “took a higher level of bets using credit than others.”</p>
<p>William Hill Australia Sell-Off?</p>
<p>The company said in a note to the UK’s FTSE 100 last month that it would consider selling its Australian arm, although an alternative would be to seek consolidation with another Australian-facing company.</p>
<p>The prohibition of in-play betting, as well as new taxes and advertising rules, have also damaged business in Oz. Meanwhile, the likely implementation of a point-of-consumption tax has added an extra layer of bleakness to the horizon.</p>
<p>“If you go back in time to 2013 when we acquired the business, Australia was a different place,” rued Bowcock.</p>
<p>William Hill entered the market through the £460 million acquisition of Sportingbet’s regulated assets, and shortly afterwards it absorbed Australian brand Tom Waterhouse.</p>
<p>“This has been a very disappointing acquisition for shareholders,” Stifel analyst Jeffrey Harwood told the Financial Times on Friday.</p>
<p>US Sports Betting Would Be Boon</p>
<p>The picture was rosier closer to home, with a significantly improved year-on-year performance, particularly in its online operations. But with a government review expected to significantly reduce the maximum stakes of fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs), the retail bookmaking sector is likely to be squeezed hard in 2018, despite the World Cup this summer.</p>
<p>One silver lining for William Hill is the potential opening-up of the US sports betting market. The company operates over 100 full sports books and betting kiosks in the state of Nevada, including some at mostly off-Strip smaller Las Vegas casinos. Hill would be a natural partner for other gaming venues across the country if the market were to expand beyond the Silver State.</p>
<p>“We are a leader in sports betting in the US and are well-positioned to benefit should more states start to regulate if the pending Supreme Court decision is positive,” Bowcock emphasized during that earnings call.</p>
