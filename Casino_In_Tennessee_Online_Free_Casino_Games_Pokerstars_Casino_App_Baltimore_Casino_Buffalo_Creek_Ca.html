<p>Swintt, the developer of such hits as Cleopatras Pearls, Samurais Pleasure, Electric Elements, Lucky Fortune Door, and many others, has confirmed that it is further expanding in Germany through a new partnership with ZEAL Network.</p>
<p>ZEAL Network is one of the leading instant and lottery product &amp; games distributors across the country, and it has been a preferred and familiar option for many players. Through this new tie-up, Swintt will significantly strengthen its product offering in the country, and benefit from ZEAL’s own ambitious expansion move.</p>
<p>ZEAL Network, which provides mostly state-licensed lottery products, has recently branched out into scratch cards and arcade-style games through a dedicated division, ZEAL Instant Games, which is where Swintt will be able to help with many of its exciting slot releases.</p>
<p>ZEAL Network will tap into Swintt’s content and offer it to German customers, helping both the supplier and operator benefit from a strengthened local reach. The companies are expecting the newly-introduced games to have a high impact on audiences and become immediately recognizable among player bases.</p>
<p>SwinttPremium, a collection of hand-picked games, is expected to have the biggest impact on the local market, the companies shared in the official statement. Among the SwinttGames that are arriving on ZEAL Network’s platforms are Cash Joker, the aforementioned Electric Elements, and others. This tie-up is a great opportunity for Swintt to connect with new player bases in the country as well.</p>
<p>Commenting on this opportunity, ZEAL Instant Games Managing Director Games Business Julian Tietz was appreciative of the opportunity to strengthen the platform’s content library with excellent games by Swintt.</p>
<p>"Virtual slot games are becoming increasingly important in the gambling sector and will continue to establish themselves as a crucial business model in the lottery segment," Tietz explained, arguing that players are looking for an extensive selection of titles to try when they play online.</p>
<p>Swintt Head of Business Development Lars Kollind was similarly excited about the opportunity to see Swintt become a part of the German market and further strengthen its presence in the country. To achieve this, the company has been actively looking into trustworthy and strong local brands.</p>
<p>Kollind welcomed the partnership with ZEAL Network arguing that the brand has long been established locally and its decision to pursue the instant games vertical was an opportunity for mutually-beneficial growth. Meanwhile, Swintt recently teamed up with NetBet to introduce its products in Germany, among other jurisdictions.</p>
