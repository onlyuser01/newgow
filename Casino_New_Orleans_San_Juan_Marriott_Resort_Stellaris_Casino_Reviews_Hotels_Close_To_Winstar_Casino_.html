    <h1>Casino New Orleans San Juan Marriott Resort Stellaris Casino Reviews Hotels Close To Winstar Casino</h1>

<p>Soaring Eagle Casino &amp; Resort, a venue describing itself as “the Midwest’s premier gaming and hospitality destination,” has commenced the installation of the Quick Custom Intelligence (QCI) platform in its Mount Pleasant casino. The agreement with QCI will help the operator handle and process data.</p>
<p>QCI to Process Data for Soaring Eagle</p>
<p>Under the agreement, QCI will leverage its unified gaming platform to align marketing, player development and casino operations around one view of Soaring Eagle’s customer data. The Saginaw Chippewa Indian Tribe-owned casino and hospitality specialist believes that QCI’s AI-powered analytics is a perfect fit for the casino.</p>
<p>In an official statement, Melinda Coffin, chief executive officer of Soaring Eagle Casino &amp; Resort, shared that her team is looking forward to using the QCI Platform. She explained that prior to choosing QCI, Soaring Eagle extensively researched the available business analytic tools. The research identified QCI as the leading company in AI-powered solutions, which is why the casino decided to adopt its tech.</p>
<p>Coffin added that QCI’s Robotic Process Automation solution will help Soaring Eagle save a lot of time and money each month by supporting its marketing efforts.</p>
<p>QCI Is Excited about the Agreement</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Dr Ralph Thomas, the chief executive officer of Quick Custom Intelligence, praised Soaring Eagle as a leading local operator and said that the QCI team sees the agreement as an important business opportunity. He noted that the casino and hospitality venue’s decision to pick QCI’s platform shows how important continually developing high-quality products that fit the customers’ needs is.</p>
<p>“We see our business partnership with Soaring Eagle, a premier operator in the Michigan market, as a strategic business relationship.</p>
<p>Thomas noted that his company currently serves more than 85 casino resorts across North America and over 4,000 sites across the world. He said that this team is confident in the proven qualities of the Unified Gaming Platform and is sure that it is going to meet the growing needs of Soaring Eagle Casino &amp; Resort.</p>
<p>In other news, in September, Gaming Dynamics, a leading gaming analyst, announced that it had reached an important milestone in Australia with QCI. The latter company leveraged its solutions to offer tools for more than 2,500 games in various locations across the Australian state of New South Wales.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Soaring Eagle teamed with Evolution, which is keen on expanding its presence in Michigan. To that end, the provider agreed to supply the tribal operator with online casino content.</p>
