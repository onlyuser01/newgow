<p>The fast-growing provider of games for the online gambling sector, CT Interactive, continues to expand its European footprint. The company confirmed earlier this week that a number of its games are now live with the leading Belarusian online gambling operator, BRAZINO 777.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the recent collaboration, CT Interactive boosted the offering of the operator, delivering its unique games to new audiences. At the same time, the deal is expected to propel the presence of BRAZINO 777 by bringing unrivaled entertainment to its growing customer base.</p>
<p>Thanks to the latest agreement, customers of the operator in Belarus will be able to tap into the captivating portfolio of games provided by CT Interactive. The company's content is renowned for its high quality, distinct features, immersive sounds and incredible graphics, making them a perfect addition to the operator's portfolio. Per the new collaboration, BRAZINO 777's clients will be able to enjoy the thrill and excitement of games such as Coffee Magic, Duck of Luck, 40 Treasures, as well as Lucky Clover, among others.</p>
<p>Yulian Krotevitch, BRAZINO 777's CEO, was excited about the latest collaboration inked with CT Interactive. "This agreement shows how our company is developing and evolving. CT Interactive is one of the leading online providers of casino content," he explained in a statement. Finally, Krotevitch said: "It is amazing to be teaming up with a brand that has a professional and honorable reputation."</p>
<p>Milena Tsankarska, CT Interactive's Head of Business Development EMEA, was similarly delighted with the latest agreement in Belarus. "For us, it is a great honor to partner with one the favorite websites of the Belarusian customers," she added. Last but not least, Tsankarska pointed out: "We are proud that our team is making our games visible for more players than ever before, as we continue to make strides both at home and in regulated markets across the world."</p>
<p>The deal with BRAZINO 777 in Belarus further strengthens the presence of CT Interactive in the country and on the Old Continent. Back in 2021, the company entered the market in Belarus for the first time. Since then, its content has enjoyed strong popularity within the region.</p>
<p>CT Interactive announced another important distribution partnership recently. Late last month, the company confirmed it forged an agreement with iGaming Deck, a leading game aggregator powered by iGP. At the time of the announcement, CT Interactive confirmed that this partnership will propel the reach of its products, allowing it to engage with new clients around the world.</p>
