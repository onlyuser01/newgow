    <h1>Dover Downs Hotel And Casino Casino Pier Photos Casino Mit Bonus Hard Rock Casino Hollywood Casino S</h1>

<p>Good afternoon</p>
<p>I have just been left feeling very angry and hurt by the activities this casino have behaved in treating me. They have been unethical , misleading and in my opinion behaved in fraudulent manner to take deposits from members knowing they don't have to pay them.</p>
<p>I should know better but upon registering I asked chat if my account was ok and legitimate so there would be no issues if i wanted to make a withdrawal. His name was John (if this is true) but he checked my account and said everything looks okay and no signs of illegal activity. I said great that's good to know as I mentioned in the above.</p>
<p>It turns out though it was all lies and even though I registered and it accepted me from the UK . Since then strangely it won't let you register from the UK.</p>
<p>I deposited £2072.15 which to my surprise were deposit fees included in that. I can't believe how cold and calculated these people can be and that is the response I got from someone called Lydia on chat who just kept throwing 2.8 from the mass terms and conditions they have.</p>
<p>When I asked how do you think I feel knowing the amount I have deposited I was never going to receive a penny from any possible winnings , her response was it's your fault and your responsibility, can I help you with anything else just to rub it in.</p>
<p>They will let you make deposit after deposit knowing you should not be registered with them and that they can throw the terms and conditions at you if you try to make a withdrawal.</p>
<p>How can a company behave in this way. Again I say they are running in a way which is almost fraudulent because they are misleading people into making deposits and then saying it's all you fault when questioning there ethics.</p>
<p>In short they have taken over £2000 from me from deposits they should not have accepted and falsely gave me the impression it was okay to play at there casino.</p>
<p>I don't know what you can do to help me but I hate seeing this happen and would hate for this to happen to anyone else.</p>
<p>I will tell you a bit about myself as if you do get in contact with them I know they will probably mention this. As in my statement I will be honest with what I say.</p>
<p>I am a recovering gambling addict and have been clean for some time. Obviously the reason why I ended up at this casino was because gamstop prevents you from playing on UK casino sites. I used to gamble as a way of escaping or dealing with issues and this is the reason I was drawn in again.</p>
<p>I accepted originally that I'd gone too far ( like old habits) and that enough was enough I contacted them on chat to close my account because I explained my personal circumstances. I accepted my money was lost.</p>
<p>After a few days I contacted them because I wanted to be sure that even though I'd lost, I'd lost on the slots and not there practices.</p>
<p>And because of there unethical practices I am here to make this complaint. It is a separate issue from my gambling issues and so has nothing to do with that.</p>
<p>It is about the conspiracy to defraud members.</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>
<p>Ashley</p>
