<p>PartnerMatrix, EveryMatrixâ€™s division that exclusively handles affiliate marketing, has teamed up with DeepCI, a software that enables the company to dig into big data, optimize and enhance marketing campaigns, and translate background information into stronger financial results.</p>
<p>DeepCI focuses on just handling existing revenue channels, but also allows PartnerMatrix partners to look into previously unexplored options, as the affiliate market evolves globally, challenged by shifting consumer tastes, business practices, and not least, regulatory expectations.</p>
<p>As a result, companies that utilize PartnerMatrix to facilitate affiliate services are put in a stronger position as they can now reduce the time it takes to study affiliates and understand which websites perform better than others, which have potential for growth, and more.</p>
<p>DeepCI also allows for real-time optimization which means that businesses can execute important business decisions and introduce calibrations to their strategies without unnecessary delay. Affiliate website traffic analytics is among the services performed, along with First Time Depositors and Net Gaming Revenue.</p>
<p>PartnerMatrix CEO Vahe Khalatyan was similarly excited about the opportunity to onboard another solution as part of the broader PartnerMatrix solution and provide customers with what he described as "complete control over every element of affiliate operations."</p>
<p>This is becoming increasingly important as indicated by a new partnership between Casino Guru Academy and AffPapa, which launched an iGaming Affiliate Management Essential course.</p>
<p>Khalatyan hailed the significance of DeepCI as a solution that is intended and meant to help analyze new streams of data and turn them into an opportunity for businesses to strengthen their understanding of the vertical. DeepCI CEO Lewis Civin was similarly happy with this opportunity and said that the partnership was not a chance one either.</p>
<p>"PartnerMatrix has undeniably solidified its position as the premier provider of affiliate marketing solutions in the iGaming industry," Civin explained. He also expressed confidence that the partnership will help build more robust solutions globally and help affiliate agencies and operators reach "unprecedented heights."</p>
<p>PartnerMatrix now has access to what is arguably the most sophisticated tool to analyze data in the affiliate vertical.</p>
