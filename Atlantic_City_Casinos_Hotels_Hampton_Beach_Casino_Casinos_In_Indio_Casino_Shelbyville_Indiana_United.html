<p>Evoplay, a prominent game studio and developer, continues to grow its footprint in Italy, one of Europe’s most lucrative markets. The latest expansion has been achieved through a collaboration with Scommettendo, a local iGaming operator that will now benefit from the 52 high-performing casino slots injected into its library by Scommettendo.</p>
<p>Evoplay Doubles Down on Italian Expansion</p>
<p>The titles that Scommettendo players can enjoy now include Fruit Super Nova, Hot Triple Sevens, and Eleven Princesses among others. The partnership is mutually beneficial as Evoplay is keen to secure further exposure in the iGaming market, something that is possible through Scommettendo’s own standing.</p>
<p>The operator, on the other hand, is constantly looking to grow its library of games and help itself grow in the market, get new players and boost engagement. Evoplay’s products have been performing well across all of these criteria. Evoplay has already been able to secure several partnerships in the Italian market, one of which is with Sportbet. Evoplay CCO Vladimir Malakchi commented on the partnership and welcomed the opportunity:</p>
<p>Establishing deals of this kind is key to our business model, and we look forward to reaping the rewards of reaching more players in the region than ever before with our leading content. Evoplay CCO Vladimir Malakchi</p>
<p>Scommettendo product manager Rosalba Turrisi was similarly pleased with the opportunity. Turrisi said that Evoplay provided an outstanding portfolio of games that offers the highest quality of experiences to customers.</p>
<p>“In addition to its retro and Vegas-style fruit titles, the developer provides a real variety of themes and experiences that are guaranteed to go down well with our customers,” Turrisi concluded. Evoplay has recently signed another prominent partnership, this time with Novibet. Italy remains an important market for iGaming brands.</p>
<p>Last week, live casino supplier Religa signed with Betflag in Italy. Playtech has been building up its poker reach in Italy with an AdmiralBet deal.</p>
