<p>Six months after the official launching of online casino in Pennsylvania in the summer of 2019, the number of operators offering online gambling within the state has grown up to six, as FanDuel has recently joined the group by expanding on its sports betting success with the introduction of slot and table games.</p>
<p>Sports Betting Popularity Leads to Product Growth</p>
<p>The Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board has been testing the operational side of the company’s new product for two subsequent days and having found it fit for service, the regulatory body allowed FanDuel to officially launch its new mobile casino on Friday.</p>
<p>Starting only with 12 slot games, among which one of the NetEnt’s locally popular title Divine Fortune, which gained popularity after an unnamed customer recently hit the jackpot of $285,385, and 5 table games consisting of three roulettes and two blackjack versions, all made available through FanDuel sports betting app, the new product is only available for mobile phones, as it is not accessible through desktop or tablet, with the desktop playing option, according to the assurances of FanDuel’s Vice President for casino operations, being next on the operator’s list for the near future.</p>
<p>Time for the FanDuel Casino Brand</p>
<p>Operating through its parent company Flutter Entertainment, Pennsylvania is the second state where FanDuel offers mobile casino, after the initial introduction of the product in New Jersey, where FanDuel has its operations under the Betfair Casino brand in partnership with Valley Forge Casino Resort through Boyd Gaming.</p>
<p>Unlike in New Jersey, the company decided to launch the new casino product in Pennsylvania, again in partnership with Valley Forge, but under its own brand, as it believes the vast popularity its brand has already gained due to the enormous success of the company’s sports betting operations, allows for that significant change in the market approach.</p>
<p>“…we felt it was a natural product expansion in Pennsylvania to leverage the FanDuel brand to bring our online sports book players a more robust online gaming offering”, Jesse Chemtob, Vice President for Casino, FanDuel</p>
<p>Founded back in 2009, FanDuel gained popularity by offering fantasy sports contest with the idea to make sports more exciting, has subsequently grown its product range by adding sports betting and online casino, turning into a full-range gambling operator with its current number of registered users being more than 6,000,000, promising a bright future for the company ahead.</p>
