<p>Several operators are ready to go live on the day of the launch</p>
<p>Red Tiger, an online slots provider which is owned by Evolution, has announced that it is launching its innovative progressive jackpot games in New Jersey. Red Tiger has already launched in Connecticut, Ontario, Quebec, and Michigan, and New Jersey is the latest state to feature over 50 Red Tiger online slot games with these timed jackpots. The games include Cash Volt, Dynamite Riches, Gonzo’s Quest MegawaysTM, Piggy Riches MegawaysTM, and Narcos MexicoTM.</p>
<p>Red Tiger Expands Timed Jackpot Games to Multiple US States, Including New Jersey</p>
<p>Red Tiger is the only games supplier to offer timed jackpots in the US. The company’s state-of-the-art progressive jackpot mechanic for online slot games allows operators to set up progressive jackpots that are guaranteed to hit before a certain time.</p>
<p>Each of these games in New Jersey will offer three progressive jackpots, all of which are configurable by the operator. These include an Hourly Jackpot that most operators start at $100, a Daily Jackpot that is usually configured to start at $1,000, and a regular progressive jackpot that has no time limit.</p>
<p>The Daily Jackpot is configured to hit before a certain time each day, with many operators choosing a time during peak hours between 9:00 pm and 11:00 pm.</p>
<p>Several operators have already gone live with Red Tiger jackpots in New Jersey, including Rush Street Interactive, which is a BetRivers brand, BetMGM, and FanDuel, with more operators coming soon. The only remaining jurisdictions in the US for Red Tiger to launch its timed jackpots are Pennsylvania and West Virginia, which are soon to follow.</p>
<p>Evolution’s CCO Jeff Millar Praises Timed Jackpots’ High Performance</p>
<p>Jeff Millar, chief commercial officer of North America at Evolution, said that timed jackpots are a big hit with players and that operators have given fantastic feedback on the high performance of these games in states such as Michigan and Connecticut.</p>
<p>Another recent development saw Red Tiger launch its timed jackpot games in Michigan in January. The company introduced its innovative progressive slot games to one of the USA’s most competitive markets. Back then Red Tiger’s daily and hourly jackpots had already proven successful in Connecticut, Ontario, and Quebec.</p>
<p>Red Tiger offers 48 titles that support the feature, which allows operators to offer progressive jackpots that are guaranteed to hit within a specified time frame. The supplier is optimistic that its products will prove popular with fans and help bolster customer engagement and retention in the US states where they are currently available.</p>
