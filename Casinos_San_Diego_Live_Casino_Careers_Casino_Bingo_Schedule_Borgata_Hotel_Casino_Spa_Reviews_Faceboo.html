<p>Baptista will work from BMM's office in Spain and will report directly to the company’s executive vice president of EURSAM, Marzia Turrini.</p>
<p>BMM Testlabs, the oldest and most experienced private independent gaming testing lab, has promoted Rubén Baptista to senior vice president of operations for the EURSAM region. In his new position, Baptista will help the company deliver on its projects in Europe and South America.</p>
<p>The new SVP joined the company back in 2021, first working as senior director of service delivery for the EURSAM region.</p>
<p>Prior to joining the gaming testing specialist, Baptista worked as the delivery excellence manager of SQLI, a digital company that excels in building and growing the digital business value of international A-brands.</p>
<p>Between 2014 and 2020, BMM Testlabs’ new SVP served Scytl, an expert in digital voting solutions and electoral modernization. Before that, Baptista occupied various technology-related and operational positions in other companies.</p>
<p>While the new SVP does not boast decades of experience in the gambling sector, he has the operational expertise to help BMM Testlabs grow its products and services. Past jobs have seen Baptista work in a variety of LATAM and Europe-oriented positions, making him a perfect fit for his new role.</p>
<p>As SVP of operations of EURSAM, Baptista will report directly to the company’s executive vice president of Europe and South America, Marzia Turrini. He will assist the company from its office in Spain.</p>
<p>Baptista Is Thrilled to Grow BMM Testlabs</p>
<p>Baptista commented on his new promotion, saying that he feels grateful to be a part of an excellent team that is full of talented and knowledgeable people. He said that he cannot wait to leverage his experience with Telecom and software development to further boost BMM Testlabs’ growth.</p>
<p>Despite being fairly new to the gaming industry, Baptista is looking forward to working beside the rest of the team and providing BMM Testlabs customers with best-in-class service.</p>
<p>Turrini praised Baptista for his promotion, saying that she is very happy to welcome another leader to the Spanish office. She lauded the newly-promoted SVP’s diligent work in helping BMM become the best partner it can be.</p>
<p>Turrini explained that Baptista’s job as SVP of operations will be overseeing and controlling the operations of the company’s professional service delivery and IT teams in Europe and South America.</p>
<p>In other news, BMM Testlabs received a license and a permit to conduct tests and issue certifications in Massachusetts last September. A few months prior to that, the company also received a license to launch in Nebraska.</p>
