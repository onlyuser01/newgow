<p>Madison Square Garden Sports Corp and Madison Square Garden Entertainment Corp. have revealed that they are joining the American Gaming Association’s (AGA) Have A Game Plan – Bet Responsibly campaign designed to promote safer and responsible gambling among consumers.</p>
<p>The initiative has reunited numerous sports leagues, franchises, and industry players. AGA has successfully secured support from Rush Street Interactive, BetMGM, and MGM Resorts, among others. The campaign has numerous partners, beyond those names, to wit the New York Jets, NASCAR, Entain, DraftKings, the PGA Tour, UFC, the Vegas Golden Knights, the Washington Football Team, and others.</p>
<p>Commenting on the latest alliance between AGA and MSG Entertainment, company executive vice president of marketing partnerships Ron Skotarczak had this to add:</p>
<p>“With the continued growth of legal sports gaming throughout the tri-state area, it’s a priority for MSG Sports and MSG Entertainment to ensure that fans and viewers have access to educational resources on how to wager responsibly.” MSG Entertainment’s Ron Skotarczak</p>
<p>MSG Sports and MSG Entertainment will promote Have A Game Plan messages throughout the Madison Square Garden Arena as well as through the available digital channels owned by the New York Knicks and the New York Rangers. The Have A Game Plan branding will also be visible during dedicated sports betting shows available through MSG Networks such as Odds with Ends, The Betting Exchange, and The Bettor Half Hour.</p>
<p>The news was welcomed by AGA senior VP Casey Clark, who argued that MSG is “a fixture in the New York sports market.” Clark was confident that the tie-up would help AGA communicate its message about responsible gambling more clearly and reliably:</p>
<p>“MSG’s unique activations further support our goal of convening the sports betting ecosystem around a common message to advance responsible gaming.” AGA senior VP Casey Clark</p>
<p>AGA points out that sports betting is already legal in 32 states and the District of Columbia. So far, 31 jurisdictions have launched, and this means that 142 million American adults have access to legal sports betting in their states.</p>
<p>The association’s efforts to educate consumers about gambling began in 2019 when Have A Game Plan launched. Responsible gambling has been a core principle in all of the existing gambling laws. The National Football league aired its first responsible gambling messages last week, getting a tepid response from audiences.</p>
