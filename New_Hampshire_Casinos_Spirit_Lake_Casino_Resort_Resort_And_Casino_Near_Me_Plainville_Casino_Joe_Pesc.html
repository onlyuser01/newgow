<p>Data and insights will overlay onto live action to create a new immersive viewer experience</p>
<p>Sports data and technology company Genius Sports announced a new agreement with TSN that will see the network’s newly-launched TSN+ streaming product deliver augmented broadcasts of NFL games.</p>
<p>Revolutionize Viewer Experience</p>
<p>The cutting-edge broadcasts from the NFL on TSN+ will be powered by the league’s official data partner, Genius Sports, delivering augmented streaming to revolutionize the viewer experience, beginning with the upcoming NFL Playoffs and Super Bowl LVII.</p>
<p>“TSN+ allows fans to go deeper into TSN’s world-leading live sports portfolio with augmented feeds, multi-casts, and additional featured content from our marquee properties, including the NFL,” commented vice president at Bell Media Sports Shawn Redmond, excited to partner with Genius Sports and deliver “these world-exclusive, data-enhanced augmented broadcasts to TSN+ users.</p>
<p>The new direct-to-consumer streaming product available on TSN.ca and the TSN app will feature Genius Sports’ full suite of augmentation tools to provide viewers with a new way to enjoy sports even more than before. Genius Sports is already utilizing these augmentation tools for audiences of competitions such as the NFL, EPL, NBA, March Madness, and others.</p>
<p>Hailing these broadcasts as “a unique marriage” between Genius Sports’ “state-of-the-art technology” and “an innovative new platform to deliver a football first for Canadian NFL Fans,” chief executive officer of Genius Sports, Mark Locke, was thrilled to enter into this partnership with Bell Media’s TSN.</p>
<p>“The NFL Playoffs and Super Bowl are world-renowned and we’re proud to be providing our full suite of broadcast augmentation tools to help bring fans closer to the action, transforming the way every play is experienced on TSN+,” Locke concluded.</p>
<p>Data and Insights Overlay onto Live Action</p>
<p>Combining play-by-play statistics with data-driven insights, the augmented NFL feeds on TSN+ will offer fans an entirely new viewing experience, utilizing graphic overlays, visualizations and other techniques to ensure a more immersive experience.</p>
<p>Genius Sports’ technology will overlay key player statistics, including the number of completed passes, rushing, passing and receiving yards, onto the live action, displaying route trails, radar maps and other on-field augmentation to further enrich the viewing experience.</p>
<p>As the exclusive television broadcast partner of the NFL in Canada, Bell Media’s channels TSN, CTV, CTV2, and RDS will all deliver NFL games across Canada in all of the league’s broadcast windows. Augmented NFL feeds will be exclusively available on TSN+.</p>
<p>BET99, a Canadian-based online sports betting and gaming operator, will also stream live in Canada all NFL games via a Genius Sports license, while in the US, a new Watch &amp; Bet video streaming option via Caesars Entertainment will allow fans to watch all NFL games live on their mobile phones.</p>
