    <h1>Casino Okc Casino Kc Durango Casino Fireworks Aces Casino Best Atlantic City Casinos NASCAR Inks Bet</h1>

<p>The partnerships come amid an increased interest in NASCAR betting</p>
<p>The National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing (NASCAR) has unveiled partnerships with nVenue and FanDuel.</p>
<p>nVenue to Seve as NASCAR’s Micro-Betting Data and Tech Provider</p>
<p>Under the first agreement, nVenue, an innovative micro-betting tech company, will become NASCAR’s official micro-betting data and tech provider. The pairing of NASCAR’s commitment to innovation and nVenue’s tech expertise has poised the partnership for a resounding success, the official announcement reads.</p>
<p>As the association’s micro-betting partner, nVenue will work with the league to design and develop in-race odds. The data will then be delivered to motorsports fans through sportsbooks and gambling operators.</p>
<p>In-race markets will include innovative betting windows like stage results, qualifying and pit-road betting opportunities, among others. Fans will thus have tons of new ways to engage with NASCAR races.</p>
<p>NASCAR’s managing director of sports betting, Joe Solosky, said that the collaboration “epitomizes a shared vision to entertain fans and enhance the race viewing experience.”</p>
<p>nVenue’s co-founder and CEO, Kelly Pracht, called the partnership a “terrific match.” She believes that this unprecedented partnership will benefit the NASCAR as a whole.</p>
<p>We predict this industry-first collaboration will be significantly beneficial not only for sportsbooks and media, but also for NASCAR’s base of knowledgeable, and new fans. Kelly Pracht, co-founder &amp; CEO, nVenue</p>
<p>FanDuel Becomes an Authorized Betting Operator</p>
<p>In the meantime, FanDuel will serve as an authorized gaming operator of NASCAR. The operator has thus secured the right to use NASCAR branding and will work with the association to create and promote engaging betting experiences, including odds integration into NASCAR’s fantasy platform.</p>
<p>FanDuel also hired FOX analyst and racing icon Clint Bowyer as an ambassador and will work with him on a variety of NASCAR-related activations.</p>
<p>Solosky shared his thoughts on this deal as well, saying:</p>
<p>Partnering with FanDuel, a best-in-class sports gaming company and iconic brand in the space, is a huge win for NASCAR and its fans. Joe Solosky, MD of sports betting, NASCAR</p>
<p>Solosky added that his team is thrilled to join forces with FanDuel and deliver engagement opportunities to fans.</p>
<p>FanDuel’s vice president of strategic partnerships, Clifton Ma, also commented on the matter. Ma said that he sees a huge potential in NASCAR betting offerings, which is why FanDuel is committed to engaging its fans with more motorsport action.</p>
<p>We’re thrilled to partner with the premier racing organization in North America and continue to grow its presence in the sports gaming space. Clifton Ma, VP of strategic partnerships, FanDuel</p>
<p>In other news, FanDuel just inaugurated PPA Tour Betting in North America.</p>
