<p>HungryBear Gaming has introduced a new sport-themed Slot Masters multiplayer game that is debuting with Ladbrokes, a prominent operator owned by Entain Group, which will deliver a new way to experience gaming, Casino Guru News learned in a press email release.</p>
<p>Slot Masters has become a leading experience industry, as attested to by Justin Chamberlain, HungryBear’s Chief Executive Officer in one of his most recent interviews with Casino Guru News.</p>
<p>The new product, called Clash of the Day, uses the familiar free-to-play tournament platform that has become Slot Masters’ signature style and has been successfully adapted to appeal to soccer fans, with a particular focus on the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>Basically, players will be given the chance to pick from Premier League clubs or go with the Fanzone FC club which is the operator’s own team in the game. Then, every player will be trying to score higher on the leaderboard, which will add better engagement and player retention to the operator’s achievements.</p>
<p>Slot Masters has been known not just because of its highly engaging social experience but also because the platform has made it possible to try and influence your opponents and prevent them from winning more. In Clash of the Day, players can use cool soccer-themed stratagems as VAR, Tackle, Wall, and Red Card, to ensure that they continue to climb up the leaderboard while their opponents are having a bit of a harder time at it.</p>
<p>"The launch of Clash of the Day with Entain and Ladbrokes is an important moment for us. It demonstrates the potential of the Slot Master’s model, providing online sportsbooks and casino with an efficient and fun way to further engage players," added Chamberlain, who hailed the arrival of this new product and its successful implementation into the Ladbrokes offer.</p>
<p>It’s something that will definitely be taking the experience for soccer fans to the very next level, Chamberlain noted. As Chamberlian recently noted, none of this would have been possible just a few years ago.</p>
<p>HungryBear has been interested in expanding the reach of its Slot Masters portfolio and has signed various franchise partnerships with other operators from the industry. The company teamed up with Blueprint Gaming to gain access to the studio’s intellectual property and integrate it with the Slot Masters portfolio.</p>
