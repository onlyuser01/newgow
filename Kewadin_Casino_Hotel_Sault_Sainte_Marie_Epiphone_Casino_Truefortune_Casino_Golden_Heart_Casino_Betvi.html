    <h1>Kewadin Casino Hotel Sault Sainte Marie Epiphone Casino Truefortune Casino Golden Heart Casino Betvi</h1>

<p>Globally-recognized online brand Videoslots announced Thursday a new agreement, allowing it to strengthen its offering. The company confirmed it joined forces with Delasport, the leading iGaming supplier, for the integration of its API for a variety of sports.</p>
<p>The latest agreement complements Videoslots’ growth. The brand expanded its offering back in 2020, accessing the betting vertical and delivering new experiences to its growing customer base. Now, Videoslots will strengthen its portfolio thanks to the latest collaboration with Delasport which is expected to propel its presence within the sports betting sector.</p>
<p>Through API content integration, Delasport’s feed will significantly expand its reach, entering more than 20 jurisdictions around the globe. The innovative solution delivers a plethora of betting markets, while at the same time, the company offers 24/7 trading and risk management, along with the handling of bet processing.</p>
<p>Late last month, Videoslots celebrated a milestone moment, by confirming that it offers more than 10,000 online games. Since its launch in 2011, the company has reached many milestones. However, this one undoubtedly marked an important achievement for the brand. The 10,000th game available via Videoslots was RAW iGaming’s Raging Super2Ways, a thrilling and unique title. The achievement comes after in January this year, Videoslots celebrated its 9,000th title.</p>
<p>Early in July, Videoslots confirmed a new senior-level appointment, strengthening its team with the addition of Marco Trucco. Joining the company, the former GGPoker and The Stars Group executive was appointed to the role of chief marketing officer.</p>
<p>The Agreement Brings Excitement to the Duo</p>
<p>Rosaire Galea Cavallaro, Delasport’s VP, shared his excitement about the new collaboration with Videoslots. He explained that the deal with the trusted and globally-recognized brand represents an important achievement for Delasport. “We’re grateful to Videoslots for trusting us with all their brands and I believe our partnership will flourish even further in the future,” explained Cavallaro in conclusion.</p>
<p>“Adding Delasport’s feed to our current portfolio is a great expansion step for us, and we’re glad we get to do it with an experienced partner like Delasport.“ Ulle Skottling, deputy CEO at Videoslots</p>
<p>Ulle Skottling, Videoslots’ deputy CEO, shared Cavallaro’s excitement. He explained that the feed from Delasport helps strengthen Videoslots’ portfolio. Moreover, Skottling said that the company is thrilled to team up with an experienced company like Delasport. Finally, he predicted an uptick in the popularity of Videoslots among bettors and further expansion for the brand on a global scale.</p>
