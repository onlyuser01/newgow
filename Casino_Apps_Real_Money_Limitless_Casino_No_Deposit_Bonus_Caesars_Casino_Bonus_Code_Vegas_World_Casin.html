    <h1>Casino Apps Real Money Limitless Casino No Deposit Bonus Caesars Casino Bonus Code Vegas World Casin</h1>

<p>I was playing Action Dragons March 26, 2022 at $4.80 a spin and got a bonus for 10 free spins. I tried to spin but the game wouldn’t do anything. So I screened printed and went back out. Went back in and I got in the game but didn’t see my free spins. Played a few times and got another bonus with 10 free spins. Game froze again. Screen print again. The next day I contacted them. They told me it was my device and told me all this stuff to do with my phone which I eventually did within a weeks time. Still didn’t work. When I went into the game it was froze. One day I deposited $5 and the games unfroze and let me play that then went back to frozen on the free spins. Emailed back and forth a number of times and they still tried to say it was on my end. Finally one day someone said it sounded like it was on their end and would look into it. Well they did look into it and all they did was take my freeze spins off! One day I was in their sight and I went to play and it said do I want to play with $20 free credits or deposit so I chose the free credits. Later went to my email and got one form them that said they gave me $20 in free credits for my lost 20 free spins at $4.80 a spin and I said no way!!! So then they offered me $79 in credits and I said no. This emailing back and forth went on for almost a month and I gave up dealing with them. I would get a different person every time and they would all say something different. I would like them to pay me a decent amount that would be close to what I would have gotten if the game didn’t freeze on me.</p>
