Bookies don’t seem to think so. Instead, their odds suggest Mexico will win the 2023 Gold Cup. What do we think? Keep reading to see our top prediction!</p>

<p>“El Tri” to Feel Like Home at SoFi Stadium</p>
<p>The 2023 Gold Cup Final is played at SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles, a city with a big Mexican diaspora. It’s estimated that north of 3.5 million people of Mexican heritage live in the City of Angels. Meanwhile, there are roughly 200,000 Panamanians in the entire US. What this means is that it’s Mexico that will get the support from the stands on Sunday evening.</p>
<p>But even if that wasn’t the case, “El Tri” would still be seen as favorites to win the 2023 Gold Cup. The thing is that Mexico’s roster looks really good, with plenty of experienced players (e.g., 38-year-old goalie Guillermo Ochoa), as well as some rising stars (e.g., 24-year-old Roberto Alvarado).</p>

<p>El Tri were in a commanding position before half time after goals from Martin &amp; Chavez, and sealed the game late on when Alvarado tapped home pic.twitter.com/nV0azn4u4d — Footie Matters ⚽ (@InternationFF) July 13, 2023</p>
<p>Still, Mexico’s biggest strength in this tournament has been team spirit. These guys work great as a collective, both offensively and defensively. This explains why they were able to beat Jamaica 3-0 in the semifinal. Can they do something similar in the Gold Cup Final?</p>
<p>Panama Hoping for Another Surprise</p>
<p>Panama entered the semifinal game with the USMNT as a +600 underdog but still managed to advance to the final. So, what happened in that game? The thing is that “Los Canaleros” played against jaded Americans who had played an exhausting game with Canada (that lasted for over two hours) just a few days earlier.</p>
<p>After 0-0 in regulation, the game went to extra time, in which each team scored a goal. Then, a penalty shootout ensued, in which Panama did better. These guys can count themselves lucky for advancing to the final, but beating Mexico seems like a mission impossible for them.</p>
<p>Mexico vs. Panama Prediction</p>
<p>The Mexicans will have their fans to support them on Sunday against a team that played a two-hour-long game just four days prior. And even if that wasn’t the case, “El Tri” have a much, much better roster than their opponent, which is why anything but an easy win for Mexico in 90 minutes would be a shocker.</p>
<p>Pick: Mexico to win</p>
