<p>The Rolling Stones announced a 16-date North American tour schedule on Tuesday that includes a stop at Allegiant Stadium on May 11, 2024. And this may indeed be the last time for singer Mick Jagger, 80, and guitarists Keith Richards, 79, and Ronnie Wood, 76.</p>

<p>The Stones, who performed their first gig during the Kennedy administration, released their 24th studio album, “Hackney Diamonds,” last month, their first since 2005.</p>
<p>The “Stones Tour ’24 Hackney Diamonds” is sponsored by AARP, though bassist Bill Wyman, 87, was the only original member to actually retire. Founding drummer Charlie Watts died at age 80 in August 2021, after what Richards suggested last year was a battle with cancer. He has been replaced by longtime Richards drummer Steve Jordan.</p>
<p>The Stones roll April 28 in Houston and come to a stop July 17 in Santa Clara, Calif., hitting LA, New Jersey, Chicago, New Orleans, Seattle, Atlanta, Denver, Cleveland, Philadelphia, and Clevaland in between.</p>
<p>Tickets for all dates go on sale December 1 at 10 a.m. local time via Ticketmaster.com, with more information available at the Rolling Stones’ website.</p>

<p>Garth Brooks has extended his “Plus One” Colosseum residency by 18 shows, adding dates from September 26 through December 24.</p>
<p>In a statement, the 61-year-old superstar said: “My experience working with the family and crew at Caesars and the audiences of the residency has been next level. I couldn’t have picked a better place to play or better people to play for.”</p>
<p>Tickets go on sale to the general public starting Monday, November 27 at 10 a.m. Citi card members will have access to a presale starting Tuesday at 10 a.m. Previous ticket purchasers and Caesars Rewards members, Caesars Entertainment’s loyalty program, and Live Nation and Ticketmaster customers will have access to a presale starting Wednesday, November 22, at 10 a.m.</p>
