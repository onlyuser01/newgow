<p>Fast-growing provider of content for the iGaming industry, Spinomenal, announced it expanded the reach of its leading portfolio</p>
<p>On Monday, the company revealed it secured the necessary approval for the market in Greece.</p>
<p>Spinomenal Achieves HGC Licensing, Expands Reach</p>
<p>By securing a license in the country, Spinomenal can now introduce its content to operators and customers. The achievement comes after the gambling regulator in the country, the Hellenic Gaming Commission (HGC), granted the iGaming content provider with a license. The Manufacturer A1 Suitability license from the HGC clears the path for Spinomenal’s growth in the country, enabling the company to deliver its leading games.</p>
<p>As a result, players in Greece can now enjoy famous classic titles from Spinomenal such as Majestic King, Demi Gods II and Book of Rampage. What’s more, customers in the European country will be able to experience the developer’s leading Universe concept, which takes the user experience to a new level and provides immersive entertainment.</p>
<p>The License Marks an Important Achievement for the Company</p>
<p>Lior Shvartz, Spinomenal’s co-founder and CEO, shared his excitement about the recent announcement. He acknowledged that the license in Greece marks an important milestone for the company. At the same time, Shvartz said that the latest achievement is in line with the positive momentum accumulated in 2022. Finally, the company’s boss pointed out that securing a license in Greece marks a vital part of Spinomenal’s plan for future expansion.</p>
<p>“Entering the Greek market is another top achievement for our business and perfectly wraps up another strong year. Our presence in Greece forms a major part of our expansion strategy within the leading regulated iGaming markets.“ Lior Shvartz, CEO and co-founder of Spinomenal</p>
<p>Before Greece, Spinomenal secured licenses in other major European markets. The company met the requirements of the gambling regulator in the UK, the Gambling Commission, as well as the ONJN, the regulatory body in Romania. Overall, the MGA license holder’s games are certified in nearly two dozen countries in Europe.</p>
<p>Although it was founded not even a decade ago, back in 2014, Spinomenal proved itself as one of the fastest-growing suppliers of iGaming content. By now, the company has more than 300 game titles. Offering entertaining and quality games is a part of Spinomenal’s growth strategy. Its games offer a plethora of themes and features that make them unique and engaging. The company’s leading portfolio of content has already proved its popularity and its list of partners is continuously expanding.</p>
