    <h1>Eureka Casino Resort Mesquite Nv Cherokee Casino West Siloam Springs Karamba Casino Allegany Seneca</h1>

<p>UPDATE 5/4</p>
<p>after denying my withdrawals many times for a different reasons they asked me to deposit 20 euro with skrill and then try to withdraw like I mentioned in my complaint!</p>
<p>but now it seriously takes a turn for the worst!!ðŸ˜«ðŸ˜«ðŸ˜«ðŸ˜«</p>
<p>TODAY 5/4</p>
<p>11:19 CPH TIME</p>
<p>a guy who I believe to be a team leader for the support staff</p>
<p>**** (support) wrote</p>
<p>" Dear Player"</p>
<p>"we have detected and "FIXED" the technical error so your withdrawals requests has been cancelled</p>
<p>unfortunately, due to a technical glitch, your a skrill account has been disconnected from player account.</p>
<p>and in order for the financial department to process your payment again we ask you you make another skrill deposit of 20 euro to reconnect your skrill with player account once again.</p>
<p>please request a new withdrawal to your skrill account again after a successful deposit - now everything should work fine"</p>
<p>"In addition, the loyalty team will find a way to reward you for the inconvenience"</p>
<p>KEEP IN MIND THAT THE CASINO HAVE REQUESTED ME TO DEPOSIT 20 EURO ON 2 DIFFERENT OCCASIONS ONLY TO HAVE MY WITHDRAWALS + THE MONEY FROM SKRILL DEPOSITS LOCKED AFTER THEY HAVE TOLD ME TO THE TECHNICAL ERROR WAS IDENTIFIED AND FIXED</p>
<p>Seriously who operates this way ??? I have never experienced anything like this before ??</p>
<p>Everything I have stated is absolutely true and I can back up every single statement with evidence.. screen recording of every dialogue and bet transaction and they are also aware of this but apparently they donâ€™t careâ€¦</p>
<p>can someone help me get my funds?</p>
<p>i would kindly appreciate any assistance I could get.. I feel honesty horrible</p>
<p>I am a 22 year old boy and I personally feel like the casino is making me doubt my own reality, sanity and perception of the situationðŸ¥¹</p>
<p>whenever I call them out on their behavior they just tell me sorry and I will be contacted at a later time</p>
<p>I need help from a mature kind human with good morals ..</p>
<p>i signed up to this site after seeing the high rating on casinoguru only to have the worst online casino experience ever..</p>
<p>Thank you so much - kind regards Mitch</p>
