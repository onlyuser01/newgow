<p>Salsa Technology, a leading iGaming solutions provider in Latin America, has reinforced its technical team with Diego Mourglia. The latter joins the company as its new chief technology officer and will use his experience to develop cutting-edge online gambling products.</p>
<p>Diego Mourglia Joins Salsa Once Again</p>
<p>Mourglia is a skilled individual who is already familiar with Salsa’s team. Mourglia first joined Salsa in 2014 and was appointed development manager. Three years later, the employee was promoted to CTO and served in this role for another three years. In December 2020, Mourglia ended his tenure at the company to work on another entrepreneurial project in the region. He is now returning to the firm and will leverage his skill to develop new iGaming products and improve older ones.</p>
<p>The appointee’s ultimate goal will now be to help Salsa Technology grow its portfolio and expand its presence in the LATAM region. His appointment comes ahead of the launch of Salsa’s proprietary sports betting platform, Salsa Sportsbook. The latter is designed with the Brazilian betting audience in mind and is a monumental solution that will greatly reinforce Salsa’s portfolio. Mourglia will, therefore, be tasked with overseeing the development and seamless rollout of Salsa Sportsbook in Brazil’s regulated market.</p>
<p>Salsa’s Team Is Happy to Have the CTO Back</p>
<p>André Filipe Neves, Salsa Technology’s chief operating officer, welcomed Mourglia back to Salsa and praised his knowledge of the LATAM market. He said that the entire company’s team is delighted to have him back and is looking forward to working with him once again.</p>
<p>His rich experience will be invaluable as we push the company forward and deliver on a number of exciting tech projects. André Filipe Neves, COO, Salsa Technology</p>
<p>Mourglia also commented on his new role. He lauded Salsa as a “very interesting and rewarding project” and said that he is happy to be back. The hire is excited to once again take the reins of the company’s tech team and grow the business. He concluded that the company will now focus on the launch of Salsa Sportsbook in Bazil</p>
<p>We will be concentrating on enhancing the product and preparing for the regulations in Brazil, which I believe is an excellent opportunity for the entire sector. Diego Mourglia, CTO, Salsa Technology</p>
<p>With Mourglia back, Salsa Technology once again has a complete senior team. His addition follows the appointment of André Filipe Neves as COO and the promotion of Eliane Nunes to head of marketing and sales.</p>
<p>In other news, the company recently inked a deal with NoLimit City, adding the latter’s content to Salsa’s proprietary aggregation platform.</p>
