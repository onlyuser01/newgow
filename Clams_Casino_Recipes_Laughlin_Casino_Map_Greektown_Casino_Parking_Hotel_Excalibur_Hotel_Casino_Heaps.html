<p>Amid the growing popularity of sports betting across the US, integrity threats continue to raise concerns. Only recently, the 8-6 loss of Alabama Crimson Tide to LSU raised such concerns, given that the gambling regulator in Ohio received details regarding “suspicious wagering activity.” US Integrity, a trusted and popular independent integrity monitoring company based in Las Vegas provided data regarding the baseball game. As a result, sports betting for events with Alabama were temporarily halted.</p>
<p>Now, a report released by The Associated Press suggests that a man from Indiana, who is the father of a member of the University of Cincinnati baseball team, may be at the center of investigations related to Alabama, as well as the Bearcats. Citing sources close to the case who spoke on condition of being anonymous because they were not allowed to comment publicly on the investigations, the publication suggested that the man was identified as Bert Neff of Mooresville.</p>
<p>Alabama’s Former Coach May Be Involved</p>
<p>Allegedly, Neff may be related to Cincinnati and Alabama cases. A separate report from ESPN suggested that surveillance footage from the sportsbook at Cincinnati’s Great American Ballpark identified a person was communicating with Brad Bohannon, Alabama’s head baseball coach who was fired earlier this month amid the heat of the scandal.</p>
<p>Shortly after details regarding the potential integrity threat emerged, the University of Alabama took action. At the time, they confirmed that Bohannon will be relieved from his duties. Greg Byrne, the director of athletics made the announcement earlier this month. Supporting its decision, the University of Alabama’s statement claimed that Bohannon, among other things breached the “standards, duties, and responsibilities” expected from a University employee.</p>
<p>As suggested by the AP, Neff may be the person that communicated with Bohannon for the sports wagers at the sportsbook at Great American Ballpark. Allegedly, the man from Indiana placed bets at the sportsbook. Still, it’s important to mention that there are separate investigations into the alleged gambling breaches which are ongoing. Official public statements on the topic are yet to be released.</p>
