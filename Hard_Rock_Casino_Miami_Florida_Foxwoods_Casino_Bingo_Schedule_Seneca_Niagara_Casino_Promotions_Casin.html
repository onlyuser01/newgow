<p>Golden State Warriors Fired Up to Get to the Playoffs</p>
<p>The Warriors are .455 (20-24) in the 2023-24 NBA, which puts them below the playoff zone. However, there are plenty of games left to be played before the end of the regular season, meaning that they still have a good chance of advancing to the postseason.</p>
<p>For that, however, they need to win games like these. The good thing is that they seem to have the motivation to pull it off. They’re playing in honor of their late assistant coach Dejan Milojevic, as well as to avoid the embarrassment of missing the playoffs for only the third time since head coach Steve Kerr took charge of the team in 2014.</p>
<p>The Warriors haven’t been in great form since the start of 2024, but they did put on a decent performance in their most recent game. They defeated the mighty Philadelphia 76ers whose best player Joel Embiid spent roughly half an hour on the court, scoring 14 points.</p>
<p>The man who scored the most points in that game was Steph Curry with 37 points. Before that, against their divisional rivals, the LA Lakers, he scored even more (46 points).</p>
<p>Banged-Up Memphis Grizzlies Are in Trouble</p>
<p>The Memphis Grizzlies have a young and talented roster that has a bright future in the NBA. But in 2024, these guys probably won’t do much. Not only are they .383 (18-29) at the moment, but they also have plenty of players on the injury list.</p>
<p>Their scoring leader Desmond Bane will miss Friday’s game, along with as many as 10 of his teammates, including Ja Morant, Marcus Smart, Vince Williams, and so on.</p>
<p>The Grizzlies have also had a very rough schedule lately, with their most recent game happening less than 24 hours before the clash with the Warriors.</p>
<p>Golden State Warriors vs. Memphis Grizzlies Prediction</p>
<p>We have no doubt that the Golden State Warriors will win this game. Unfortunately, bookies think the same, which is why they’re not giving too attractive odds on the visiting team. A much better value is for spread, which we think the Warriors are going to cover.</p>
<p>We also think it’s worth paying attention to props, particularly those with Steph Curry in the spotlight. He’s been on form, and we think he can easily go over 30 once again.</p>
<p>Pick: Golden State Warriors</p>
