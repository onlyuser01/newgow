<p>Parimatch’s branding will feature at the King Power Stadium through the 2023/24 season</p>
<p>Sports betting and online gaming giant Parimatch has renewed its sponsorship agreement with Leicester City FC, a major soccer club. The operator will thus continue to serve as the club’s official betting partner through the 2023/24 season.</p>
<p>Parimatch has served as the team’s official partner since the 2020/21 season. The partnership between the two parties proved to be a fruitful one, prompting the current extension.</p>
<p>As agreed, Parimatch’s branding will feature at the King Power Stadium. The operator’s logo will be visible on the stadium’s pitch-side advertising boards and interview backgrounds. The gambling company’s branding will also feature across Leicester City FC’s social media and other digital platforms.</p>
<p>In return, Parimatch will hold online and offline advertising rights.</p>
<p>Leicester City FC Is Excited to Extend a Fruitful Partnership</p>
<p>Harj Hir, Leicester City FC’s head of partnerships, commented on the matter. He said that the club has enjoyed a very successful relationship with Parimatch so far and is looking forward to expanding the partnership.</p>
<p>Hir pointed out that the partnership has benefitted both parties, allowing them to grow their respective international footprints.</p>
<p>We’ve helped to grow each other’s international profile over the past few years, and we now look forward to building on that success. Harj Hir, head of partnerships, Leicester City FC</p>
<p>Parimatch UK’s head, Filip Pirozenok, also commented on the expanded partnership, expressing his team’s delight at the opportunity to continue working with the soccer club and serve as its official betting partner for another season.</p>
<p>Pirozenok noted that the partnership allows his team to tap into Championship advertising. It also allows Parimatch to offer exclusive promotions, competitions and giveaways, the head added.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Parimatch will also continue to serve as the official betting partner of Chelsea FC, another famous British soccer club, despite earlier considerations.</p>
<p>Parimatch Faces Trouble in Ukraine</p>
<p>Speaking of Parimatch, the betting and gaming site was recently suspended in Ukraine because of alleged ties with Russia. Parimatch, believing the sanctioning to be a mistake, asked the government to reevaluate its stance.</p>
<p>After a petition collected thousands of signatures, Zelenskyy himself commented on the matter. He pointed out that numerous gambling organizations with ties to Russia had previously worked to undermine Ukraine. However, he admitted that a mistake may have been made and asked Denys Shmyhal, Ukraine’s prime minister, to review the case.</p>
