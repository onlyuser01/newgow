<p>Penn National and Evolution Gaming have signed up a live casino games deal. As a result, Penn will use Evolution’s studio in Pennsylvania to stream live games across the state.</p>
<p>Evolution Gaming and Penn National Sign Live Dealers Deal</p>
<p>World leading supplier of live gaming solutions Evolution Gaming has teamed up with casino operator Penn National Gaming to allow the casino to broadcast live games to players within the state. For this purpose, Penn will use Evolution’s upcoming studio, which will stream throughout the Keystone State.</p>
<p>This comes at a time when Evolution Gaming has stated its intention to continue expanding its presence in the U.S., anticipating a rapid growth for online gambling in the country and amid shrinking markets in Europe, subject to ever-tougher regulations.</p>
<p>Similarly, Penn National is also looking for ways to consolidate its footstep in the digital gaming space across the U.S. Commenting on the developments, Chief Business Development Officer for America James Stern had this to say:</p>
<p>“We very much look forward to delivering world-class Live Casino gaming for their players along with operational excellence, peace of mind and exciting revenue potential for their business.”</p>
<p>Penn National currently operates 40 facilities in 18 jurisdictions in North America, making it one of the largest companies and a good fit for Evolution gaming’s own ambitions to expand.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Penn National recently teamed up with DraftKings to allow the sports betting platform to launch its mobile app in the Keystone State. The casino operator also teamed up with the Stars Group alongside other theScore and PointsBet.</p>
<p>Evolution Strengthen Ties with Industry Leaders</p>
<p>Earlier in October, Evolution Gaming extended a deal with Scientific Games and specifically the Open Gaming System (OGS) distribution network</p>
<p>Stern also commented on the occasion of SG and Evolution Gaming strengthening their partnership, saying:</p>
<p>“We have worked with Scientific Games for a number of years on exclusive game content and we are glad to extend this relationship and have Evolution’s Live Casino available on the Scientific Games platform.”</p>
<p>Penn on the Lookout for a New Partner</p>
<p>During the company’s Q3 Earnings Call at the end of October, Chief Operating Officer Jay Snowden said that Penn was actively looking for a new media partner to help it push its offer more aggressively.</p>
<p>Penn specifically wants to find ways and engage with sports fans and find a common ground between wagering on sports and informing customers. Presently, Penn has an ongoing deal with theScore, a media and betting company.</p>
