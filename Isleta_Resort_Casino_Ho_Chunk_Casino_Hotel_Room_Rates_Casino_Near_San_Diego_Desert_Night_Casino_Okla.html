<p>Explore the Streets in Search of Golden Scatters and Wilds</p>
<p>Players are invited to join the lovely furry friends in the game and start scouring the streets by their side, in search of Golden Scatters and Wilds. The 20-payline slot is highly volatile and could pay more than 10,000x the stake at an RTP of 96.31% in the long term. The graphics and overall theme are inspired by the furry animals and their neighborhood, cans of cat food, balls of yarn, and basic Royal symbols.</p>
<p>The game has three feature symbols. The wild replaces all symbols and can randomly add 2x or 3x multipliers. The slot also counts two scatter symbols that can trigger between nine and 15 free spins or further upgrade them, along with sticky wilds, even more generous multipliers, and the upgrade alternative.</p>
<p>The Free Spins Gamble Feature</p>
<p>With the help of this special feature, players get a chance to gamble up to five upgrades as they are asked to pick one of the three existing coins. Two of the available coins offer upgrades, including three more Free Spins, two guaranteed Sticky Wilds, and 2x multipliers applied on Wilds. Nonetheless, the third coin sends players to the start of the base game.</p>
<p>Upgrades are also engaged with the help of the Golden Scatter symbol. While playing the base game, players can catch three blue or gold Scatters to trigger Free Spins. Every Golden Scatter symbol has one upgrade attached to it, which means they add a greater big win potential to the slot.</p>
<p>Playson’s chief commercial officer Tamas Kusztos called Bozo Cats “a thrilling addition” to their current portfolio that consists of more than 85 omnichannel casino games fully tested and certified for the greatest regulated markets in Europe. Last September, Playson entered the Ontario gaming market.</p>
<p>Kusztos also spoke about the already popular Free Spins mechanic that continues to be an all-time favorite for many of their players. He mentioned the added interactive gamble twist which he called “a dramatic inclusion within this mode.”</p>
<p>Last week, Playson launched the first slot of the year to its portfolio. Pirate Chest: Hold and Win is a slot with instant cash prizes and a massive 3000x Grand Jackpot.</p>
