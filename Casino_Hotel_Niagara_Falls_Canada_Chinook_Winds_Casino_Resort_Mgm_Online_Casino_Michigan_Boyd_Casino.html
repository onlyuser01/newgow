<p>The 30,000-square foot Esports Arena Las Vegas – a joint venture between Esports Arena, Allied Esports, and MGM Resorts – plans to host some of the biggest tournaments on the esports calendar, but it’s not just for pro-gamers.</p>
<p>The space is organized into three connected zones, with a front lobby filled with virtual reality and gaming spaces open to all comers, while the dome area offers retro gaming with consoles like Sega, Super Nintendo, and Atari.</p>
<p>The main competition stage holds 1,500 people and the first event will kick off on Saturday – a two-day, $25,000 Super Smash Bros for Wii U tournament, featuring some of the game’s top stars.</p>
<p>This is the latest phase in Las Vegas’ mission to embrace competitive video gaming and to win the hearts and minds of the hard-to-reach millennial generation, which has turned its nose up at traditional casino gaming.</p>
<p>Growth of a Phenomenon</p>
<p>Esports is no longer a quirky fringe interest. As a spectator event, it regularly fills arenas, while studies suggest it has become as popular a viewing habit among male American millennials as basketball.</p>
<p>Mainstream brands – from sports leagues, to media companies, to casinos – are eager to buy themselves a stake in a multi-billion-dollar industry in the making. In 2016 esports generated $493 million in revenue, reaching a fragmented global audience of about 320 million people.</p>
<p>“The industry itself is projected to reach $1 billion in revenues over the next couple of years and in Las Vegas, what we are building is out championship destination,” said Jud Hannigan, CEO of Allied Esports “It’s a global phenomenon, there are almost 400 million people tuning in a watching esports on the regular.”</p>
<p>No Baby Boomers</p>
<p>MGM has been particularly committed towards this burgeoning phenomenon. It has hosted international tournaments at the Mandalay Bay, and meanwhile its Level Up lounge at the MGM Grand is a skill-gamer’s delight.</p>
<p>The new venue will be the second esports arena in town, after the Millennial Esports Arena opened downtown in March last year.</p>
<p>And of course, not only can you now watch esports tournaments on the Strip, you can also bet on them, at certain sports books, at least.</p>
<p>Regulators in Nevada sanctioned esports wagering in 2016, and in November that year Downtown Grand’s William Hill sports book took the city’s first ever e-sports bet.</p>
