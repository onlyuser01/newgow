<p>Top Australian sports betting operator TAB has scored an important partnership that will see it in the position of the National Basketball Association’s official local betting partner. The deal will see the two betting partners collaborate and bring exciting wagering offerings to Australian sports bettors.</p>
<p>TAB Becomes NBA’s Official Betting Partner</p>
<p>The deal covers the entirety of the 2021-2022 season. As an official betting partner, TAB will see its logo featured throughout all of the NBA’s digital marketing outlets. This includes the league’s social media accounts, as well as the official site. In turn, TAB will offer an Australian version of the NBA’s beloved free-to-play Pick’Em prediction game.</p>
<p>Furthermore, TAB will work together with the basketball league to create a fully localized version of NBA’s betting-oriented broadcast, NBABet. This is a monumental moment for NBA and a great honor for TAB as this will be the first time NBABet has been broadcast in a foreign country.</p>
<p>This triumph for TAB builds on the previous efforts of its parent company Tabcorp. Back in 2019, Tabcorp inked a deal with NBA that brought the NBA TV to Australia.</p>
<p>TAB Gets an Opportunity to Diversify Its Offerings</p>
<p>Tabcorp Wagering and Media’s managing director, Adam Rytenskild, is proud to have TAB selected as the partner of the NBA. He noted that the popularity of the NBA in Australia is growing, especially among younger audiences. This will be a good opportunity for TAB to tap into this market since most of its usual sports offerings are focused on racing.</p>
<p>“We look forward to working with the team at the NBA to provide our customers with a unique offering through outstanding products, promotions and content,” Rytenskild said in the official release.</p>
<p>Scott Levy, the executive vice president of NBA Asia, spoke on the partnership with TAB and why the company was selected as the association’s official betting operator. Levy explained that fan engagement is the core of the current partnership. TAB’s experience as a proven leader and innovator in the wagering space played a big part in NBA’s choice.</p>
<p>“This NBA season is primed to be yet another thrilling basketball showcase, and together with TAB, we will deliver the best possible gaming experience to deepen our engagement with the many passionate NBA fans in Australia who are interested in gaming,” Levy explained.</p>
<p>This partnership is an important step for the popularization of professional basketball and the NBA outside of the United States. It will also be a good opportunity for TAB to broaden its offering and reach new audiences. TAB’s parent company has been faring well recently as it quickly recovered from COVID-19. It is now time to expand its business.</p>
