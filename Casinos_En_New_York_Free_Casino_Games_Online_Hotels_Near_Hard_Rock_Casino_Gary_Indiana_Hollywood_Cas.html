<p>The prominent operator, which is the official partner to Burnley FC, has announced its newest promotion that will grant cricket fans a chance to get more out of their love for the sport</p>
<p>The Hundreds is a 100-ball cricket tournament that involves eight men’s and eight women’s teams that are based in England and Wales, and to celebrate this sports event, the operator has decided to launch the “Play in THE HUNDRED &amp; Win Bonus” which will let sports fans to share in the joy of the event.</p>
<p>W88 Capitalizes on Cricket Competitions Globally</p>
<p>The Hundred is also one of the most-watched sports events worldwide as it’s considered one of the most prestigious events in cricket. The campaign will focus on the Indian market where W88 is well-represented and where cricket is the most loved sport.</p>
<p>To participate, customers will have to bet on every match during The Hundred Men’s Competition 2023 and place a stake of at least INR300 ($3.60) per match to qualify. Customers will get an INR5000 bonus ($60). Players must also contact customer support using any of the supported communication channels in order to enter the promotion.</p>
<p>According to W88, this is an opportunity for cricket fans in the country to leverage their love and knowledge for the sport to boost the amount they win from the competition. There is a “sense of involvement,” W88 said in an official statement. The promotion will be available from August 1 through August 27, 2023, GMT +8.</p>
<p>W88 has been keen on growing its footprint in global markets with the betting operator becoming a Principal Partner for Burnley FC in June 2023. Meanwhile, cricket has been attracting a lot of interest from fans, operators, and not least – data companies which are able to provide everyone in the ecosystem with quick and actionable insights.</p>
<p>Statscore and Sportradar have both been following the sport globally and leveraging official data feeds and streams to ensure that partners get the best possible experiences. Meanwhile, W88 has not been only engaging with one team in the United Kingdom, with the operator also reaching out to Fulham and establishing a “record sponsorship” with the soccer club as well, significantly expanding its own footprint and brand awareness in the region.</p>
<p>All of this is coming at a time when partnerships between sports betting operators and sports teams, particularly soccer clubs, are coming under increased scrutiny.</p>
