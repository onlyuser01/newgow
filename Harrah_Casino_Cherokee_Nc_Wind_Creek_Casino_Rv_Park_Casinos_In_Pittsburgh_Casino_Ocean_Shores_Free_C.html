<p>Paysafe and the Ontario Lottery Gaming Corporation have agreed to extend their partnership and thanks to the new agreement, Paysafe will supply OLG with an affiliate program powered by Income Access. The two parties have been working side by side since 2015.</p>
<p>The Affiliate Program Is Fitting for Income Access’ Anniversary</p>
<p>Geoff Smorong, the vice-president of operations at Income Access, commented on the development and stated that the launch of the affiliate program is fitting for Income’s Access 20th anniversary, after being founded in Montreal.</p>
<p>He cited the “deep Canadian roots” as one of the reasons why Income Access is proud to launch the first affiliate program and provincial lottery together with OLG.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the chief digital and strategy officer of OLG, Dave Pridmore, stated that OLG is regarded as a trusted brand in Ontario and with the help of Paysafe and Income Access, OLG’s platform will continue to thrive and prosper.</p>
<p>As a concluding matter, Pridmore noted that the growth of the customer base at OLG is a massive thing for the whole province as all of the company’s profits are reinvested in Ontario.</p>
<p>With this partnership, all affiliates will be able to promote OLG for play within the province. That includes an online casino and sports betting products on PROLINE+. The benefit for affiliates is the fact that OLG is a recognized brand that can attract numerous players to their platforms.</p>
<p>Additionally, all affiliates that join the OLG program will receive support from Income Access’ Canadian affiliate managers.</p>
<p>Ontario’s Gambling Market Keeps Expanding</p>
<p>Online gambling was officially legalized in the Ontario province on April 4. Since then, the region had massive success as numerous operators applied and got a license. The most recent gambling operator to enter the market is DraftKings.</p>
<p>Even though the company was not included in the roster of companies that launched on the same day as the launch of online gambling in Ontario, it is bound to catch up. The Alcohol and Gaming Commission, Ontario’s regulator, is determined to make sure that the industry is well-regulated and that operators adhere to the standards.</p>
<p>Those that do not adhere to these standards face penalties, which is exactly what happened to PointsBet and BetMGM. AGCO issued fines to the pair for alleged advertising and bonus shortcomings.</p>
<p>Although the launch of the online gambling market is greeted by many, land-based casinos in the province oppose it as they think that Ontario will actually lose money. A Great Canadian Gaming report, which was issued back in January 2022, stated that the province may lose as much as $2.8 billion. One of the main reasons why is the fact that land-based casinos in Ontario are taxed at 55%, whereas the taxes for online gambling operators are smaller.</p>
