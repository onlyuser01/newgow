<p>The new role of responsible gaming coordinator will ensure progress on existing initiatives, identify gaps and problems, and develop recommendations to advance the state’s responsible gaming work</p>
<p>In an effort to tackle the problem of gambling addiction, New Jersey’s Attorney General Matthew J. Platkin and Division of Gaming Enforcement (DGE) director David Rebuck have announced several new measures, including the establishment of a new position to deal with responsible gaming, new advertising standards for operators and easier self-exclusion access for players.</p>
<p>New Jersey Attorney General Appoints Responsible Gaming Coordinator to Assist At-Risk Patrons</p>
<p>Speaking at the East Coast Gaming Congress held at the Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino in Atlantic City, Attorney General Platkin said that the new position of responsible gaming coordinator would be filled by an experienced attorney and would report directly to the DGE director.</p>
<p>As New Jersey’s gaming and sports wagering industries continue to grow, Platkin said the obligations to assist patrons who are at risk for problem gambling are also becoming wider.</p>
<p>He further added that the other initiatives will help protect consumers and make it easier for individuals to access the help they need when their gaming behavior becomes problematic.</p>
<p>DGE’s March 2023 gaming revenue results showed that for that month, online gaming revenue reported by casinos and their partners was $165.7 million, a rise of 17.8% compared to $140.7 million for March 2022. Sports wagering gross revenue reported by casinos, racetracks, and their partners was $93 million for March 2023, a 40.1% increase compared to last March.</p>
<p>New Jersey Launches Initiatives to Make Responsible Gambling a Priority</p>
<p>The initiatives announced by the Attorney General include new online and sports gambling advertising standards, making it clear that operators must make responsible gaming a priority. These initiatives require operators to display the gambler hotline prominently in their ads. They also require them to end dubious promises of guaranteed wins or risk-free bets.</p>
<p>Additionally, operators must make wagering requirements clear in their terms and conditions. Advertising in locations where it could entice those under 21 years of age to play must be limited. Finally, the public must have the ability to swiftly opt out of direct advertising.</p>
<p>DGE will also make it easier for players with problem gaming behaviors to exclude themselves from gaming by creating a video-conference option, and by establishing a 24/7 hotline dedicated to assisting people with questions about the self-exclusion program and the process for signing up.</p>
<p>According to Felicia Grondin, executive director of the Council on Compulsive Gambling of New Jersey, the increase in online gambling opportunities, access, and the amount of advertising has put many more people in New Jersey at risk for problem gambling.</p>
<p>Keith Whyte, executive director of the National Council on Problem Gambling, also commented that the initiatives announced on April 20 will further bolster responsible gambling protections and reduce barriers for people seeking help.</p>
