    <h1>Casinos In Canada Hollywood Casino York Boomtown Casino Nevada San Manuel Casino Buffet Royal Ace Ca</h1>

<p>I deposited around € 900 yesterday 4 September at Spinia casino and played. When I was then going to withdraw € 390, I realized that they had removed Trustly as a withdrawal method which was the only way for me to withdraw money from that site.</p>
<p>the support refuses to help me.</p>
<p>So they have no problem receiving my money but now I can not get any money out at all.</p>
<p>I would like the entire amount I deposited to be repaid now I feel.</p>
<p>ie refund on what I deposited because I still can not get any money out of the side, I could just as easily have played with "play money". But of course they shit in one when you try to get help via support. They also interrupt you in the middle of the chat session because they refuse to help you.</p>
<p>so how can I get my money back from these thieves?</p>
