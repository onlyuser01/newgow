<p>Greyhound Resumes Direct Bus Service From New York City to Atlantic City</p>

<p>After 217 days with the route shuttered, Greyhound Lines is restoring its “Lucky Streak” direct service route to and from New York City’s Port Authority to Atlantic City casinos on the Boardwalk.</p>

<p>Greyhound suspended the service from midtown Manhattan to the Boardwalk casinos on March 16 after the gaming venues were forced to close.</p>
<p>Though New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy (D) allowed Atlantic City slot machines and table games to resume operations ahead of the July 4 holiday weekend, Greyhound kept the AC route dark because of limited demand.</p>
<p>As of today, the casino bus from NYC to AC is back running. It made its first trip at 7:30 this morning and arrived around 10:45 am.</p>
<p>A one-way ticket from the Port Authority on 8th avenue and 41st in New York City to the Atlantic City Boardwalk starts at $30. The fare includes a $20 bonus coupon that riders must pick up at a Greyhound kiosk at the Port Authority.</p>
<p>The $25 promotional slot play credit is a $5 reduction from what Greyhound and Atlantic City casinos gave bus riders prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>In Atlantic City, Greyhound stops at Resorts, Bally’s, Caesars, and Tropicana. The travel time on the bus is roughly three hours and 15 minutes, considerably longer than the two hours Google Maps says it should take in an automobile from Manhattan to Atlantic City.</p>
<p>During the suspension of the Lucky Streak line, Greyhound continued offering riders service to the Atlantic City Bus Terminal, which is located several blocks inland from the Boardwalk.</p>
<p>COVID in NYC</p>
<p>On the weekends, the casino bus from New York is often packed with younger Manhattan residents getting away from the city for a gambling trip, or bachelor and bachelorette parties. But through the week, Greyhound casino buses from New York City and New Jersey are filled with seniors.</p>
<p>Murphy allowed casinos to reopen at 25 percent capacity and with numerous health measures in place to protect gamblers from the coronavirus. The first-term governor has continually voiced his concerns that casinos could be ideal environments for COVID-19 to spread.</p>
<p>COVID-19 is more lethal inside than outside,” Murphy declared in June. “Casinos sort of have the attributes that are hardest to deal with this virus. It’s indoors, no ventilation.”</p>
<p>Seniors are more at risk to be hospitalized and die from COVID-19. According to the CDC, compared with the 18-29-year-old demographic, people aged 50-64 are 30 times likelier to die from the coronavirus. That rate surges to 90 times for 65-74 years of age, 220 times for those aged 75-84, and 630 times for 85+ and older.</p>
<p>Greyhound Safety</p>
<p>Greyhound is reigniting service from New York City to Atlantic City casinos but in a new manner.</p>
<p>Riders are required to wear face masks throughout the trip, Greyhound says it’s enhanced its cleaning and disinfecting procedures, and cabin air is replaced every five minutes with outside air.</p>
<p>Plexiglass divers have been installed to separate the driver area from the passenger cabin.</p>
