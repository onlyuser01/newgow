    <h1>Caesars Online Casino Pa Casinos In Montego Bay Island View Casino Resort Gulfport Ms Hollywood Casi</h1>

<p>After introducing a jackpot version of its popular slot The Secret of Ali Baba just last week, RAW iGaming has more fresh and exciting news for its fans.</p>
<p>RAW Group’s in-house developer studio has announced the development and release of SuperSymbols, its latest game mechanic. The new mechanic currently waiting for a patent joins the impressive list of similar game mechanics like SuperSlice, SuperTracks, and SuperStretch that has entirely changed the way featuring online slots are played.</p>
<p>The fresh feature has made its debut in the studio’s newly launched Mighty Buffalo SuperSymbols slot. In the near future, Raging Super2Ways will join the roster of games that will incorporate the new win potential boosting mechanic.</p>
<p>The Larger the SuperSymbols, the Greater the Wins</p>
<p>Continuing its goal to “blast industry monotony out of the sky” and disrupt the status quo, RAW iGaming has envisioned the innovative mechanic with matching symbols that can be seen landing adjacent to one another each in groups of at least 2×2.</p>
<p>Once the matching groups merge, they trigger SuperSymbols, which are paying symbols that will grow in size once the same symbols will be seen landing adjacent to them.</p>
<p>The size of the symbols is determined by the pixel count of the image. In other words, the larger the SuperSymbols get, the greater their win potential becomes. All players, with special emphasis on mobile players, will this way have a much easier time understanding the exact outcomes of the games they are engaged in while enjoying a better experience.</p>
<p>The SuperSymbols mechanic can be used together with other bonus features including respins, cascades, free spins, and progressive multipliers, similar to the SuperTrack mechanic that can be combined with multipliers, additional bonuses, and free spins.</p>
<p>RAW, the “Pink Shark in the Sea of Sameness”</p>
<p>Tom Wood, the chief executive officer of the group that was recently granted a business-to-business supplier license in Sweden, commented on their goals to generate better player experiences with the help of mechanics like SuperSymbols.</p>
<p>Wood acknowledged the way these unique mechanics have turned them into the “must-have developer for some of the biggest operators” in the industry. Describing themselves as “a pink shark in the sea of sameness”, Wood also spoke about SuperSymbols’ simplicity which makes it easy to grasp and understand when compared to other next-gen game mechanics.</p>
<p>The CEO also added that these types of mechanics that are easy to use and deliver engaging experiences are the main thing that has helped them stick their heads above the crowd and attract new partnerships. In May, the studio inked a content distribution deal with NetBet Italy, an important online casino operator in the European country, following a similar deal with SKS365 announced in March. At the beginning of the year, First Look Games agreed to promote RAW iGaming’s portfolio using its affiliates network which currently counts over 800 names and reaches over 20 million players worldwide.</p>
