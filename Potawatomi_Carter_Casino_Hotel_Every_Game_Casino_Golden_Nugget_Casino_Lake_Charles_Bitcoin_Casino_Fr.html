    <h1>Potawatomi Carter Casino Hotel Every Game Casino Golden Nugget Casino Lake Charles Bitcoin Casino Fr</h1>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>so i scrolled through my bank and there was no deposit, so i decided to look and see if it were at the casino, and thats where they put the ‘money’. Im really disappointed and it really kinda sucks that they continually lied to me and tried to direct my attention back to policies they didnt tell anyone about- they have since changed this and it does say on their withdraw page exactly what it should have all along- so in the long run they basically knew they were in the wrong- even if they wont make it right with me- i am done fighting, and i wont recommend them to anyone- and its apparent that they dont value their customers anyway so its no hair off their back. I guess the $60 in question plus the $20 that they wont even acknowledge and lied about even sending from the start is whats gonna break them so there they go- i am curious how this will go if i win again? Not that im dumb enough to think that they are a company with enough integrity not to rig the games - from this whole thing if nothing else was learned at least we know DESERT NIGHTS CASINO HAS NO INTEGRITY.</p>
<p>Thank you for your help</p>
