    <h1>Palms Casino Resort West Flamingo Road Las Vegas Nv Luck Land Casino Roses Casino Casino Near Palm S</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>First of all, I am disappointed how Librabet treated me as a customer.</p>
<p>Here's what happened:</p>
<p>In April 2023 I deposited ‚Ç¨200 and then another ‚Ç¨100 and had a nice streak of luck. In total I earned around ‚Ç¨1300 with it.</p>
<p>I didn't have to do verification right from the start, only after I had made those sizeable wins. During this verification, documents such as my transaction history of my debit card were required, with all transactions of the last 3 months. I have sent all these documents and cooperated.</p>
<p>After that, my account was closed without warning. I suddenly couldn't log in anymore. When I contacted live support, the only response I got was that my account failed verification under T&amp;C 9.1 and was funded by a third party. Only my last deposit would be refunded.</p>
<p>This claim is definitely not true, there was no third party funding.</p>
<p>My last deposit (‚Ç¨100) was made on May 17th. refunded, but not my first deposit (‚Ç¨200) and not all my (!) winnings either! üôÅ</p>
<p>When I asked support via email, they confirmed once again that my last deposit would be refunded and that no further payments would be made. No further information was given.</p>
<p>With that, Librabet not only robbed me of my first deposit, but also of all my fairly earned winnings.</p>
<p>At the same time, they don't want to listen to me either, Librabet is not interested in any clarification of their allegations and seems to want to keep all my money and would rather block my account than process my case. This is totally unacceptable, especially since there is absolutely no information on the exact reasons for the ban from Librabet. The argument of third-party financing was not substantiated in any way and I cannot understand it with the best will in the world.</p>
<p>I have legal protection insurance and can therefore take legal action without bearing the risk of the costs. But I would like to emphasize that I would very much like to forgo it and settle the matter through Casino-Guru. I hope for the support of Casino-Guru and for the honest cooperation of Librabet, so that I can refute their exact accusations (there is actually no exact accusation, only the buzzword "third-party financed" has been mentioned), because I definitely have nothing wrong have made.</p>
<p>Thanks very much!</p>
