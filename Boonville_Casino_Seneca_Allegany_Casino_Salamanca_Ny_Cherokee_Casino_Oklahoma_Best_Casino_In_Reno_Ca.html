<p>The hand-picked jury which will determine the winners consists of over 150 leading professionals in the gambling industry. Getting shortlisted for an award is reserved for only the top-performing companies in the sector. As a result, judges will have the arduous task of picking winners among the very best.</p>
<p>Since many members of the judging panel are also members of shortlisted companies, they are required to declare any conflicts of interest and will not vote in problem areas. The SBC awards have also made judges sign a non-disclosure agreement to protect the confidentiality of applicants.</p>
