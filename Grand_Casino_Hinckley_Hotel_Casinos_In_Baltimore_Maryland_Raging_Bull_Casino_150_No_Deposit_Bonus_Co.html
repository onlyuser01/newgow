<p>Hard Rock's popular entertainment brand is coming to the city of Deadwood in the heart of the Black Hills National Forest</p>
<p>Hard Rock International, the gaming brand of the Seminole Tribe of Florida, announced today that its world-class entertainment is coming to the historic city of Deadwood in South Dakota.</p>
<p>Welcome Deadwood’s ‘Can’t Miss’ Property</p>
<p>The Rocksino by Hard Rock Deadwood, a boutique hotel and casino in the city of Deadwood, will have its grand opening on August 8, gathering Hard Rock International executives, local community members and civic leaders to celebrate the region’s newest economic driver.</p>
<p>Commenting on the announcement, Mayor of Deadwood, David Ruth, outlined the excitement in the city “notorious for entertaining guests since 1876” as everyone is thrilled to welcome the “newest, can’t miss property,” Rocksino by Hard Rock.</p>
<p>“Our rich, old West history combined with the Hard Rock brand will enhance the Deadwood experience that we are known for,” Ruth said, adamant that “the Rocksino by Hard Rock is sure to be an additional gem luring visitors” to the city’s amazing community.</p>
<p>Bringing everything the Hard Rock brand is popular with to Deadwood, albeit on a smaller scale, the Rocksino by Hard Rock will feature a boutique hotel, a casino with 86 new slot machines, a full-service restaurant, and a bar offering craft cocktails and delicious food, including Deadwood’s most loved pizza.</p>
<p>Provide Economic Stimulus to the City</p>
<p>Jon Lucas, chief operating officer of Hard Rock International, outlined Hard Rock’s pride from “being able to provide authentic and memorable experiences… embodied by music and rich cultural history,” thrilled to have the opportunity “to become a part of one of the most celebrated historic places in the US and provide an economic stimulus to the city of Deadwood.”</p>
<p>Guests of Rocksino by Hard Rock Deadwood will be able to enjoy their meals on the Historic Patio featuring a wood fire grill, or inside, submerging into the atmosphere of the bar or the VIP mezzanine. Additionally, the Rock Shop Retail Store will present them with an opportunity to shop for custom Rocksino by Hard Rock Deadwood apparel.</p>
<p>True to its commitment to supporting local communities, Hard Rock will partner with Tunnel to Towers Foundation to bring relief to the eighth largest Native American Reservation in the US, the Oglala Sioux Tribe, under the tribe’s veterans program. Hard Rock would provide further details about its partnership with the foundation at the Grand Opening Guitar Smash at Outlaw Square, featuring headliner Sublime with Rome.</p>
<p>Just days ago, Hard Rock International received recognition from Deloitte and Wall Street Journal by winning the distinction of the best-managed company. The honor is issued on an annual basis to companies that have revenues of at least $250 million.</p>
