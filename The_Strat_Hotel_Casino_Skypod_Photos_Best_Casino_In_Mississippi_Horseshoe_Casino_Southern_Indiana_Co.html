<p>We’re so proud to be partnering with GG.BET. This is our first international partnership with a betting company, and it was incredibly important to us that our partner makes the development of esports its top priority, and understands our community and what they want. Team Vitality CEO Nicolas Maurer</p>
<p>Vitality fans will stand to benefit from unique activations, community experiences, and next-generation content, which will strengthen the bond between the team’s supporters and the organization. GG.BET’s branding and signage will appear across Team Vitality’s social media channels and on player jerseys as they complete in live events in the remainder of the 2022 and 2023 seasons.</p>
