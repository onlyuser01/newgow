    <h1>Casino With Hotel Near Me Hard Rock Hotel Casino Hollywood Fl Redrock Casino Las Vegas Comic Casino</h1>

<p>The max. bet rule is a standard rule applied to most of bonuses. It's very rare to find a bonus that doesn't have this rule attached to it.</p>
<p>Anyway, I can imagine a situation where even though the player breaches this rule, it wouldn't be fair to void all winnings. The rule exists in order to make sure that the player needs to play a certain amount of spins with the bonus before they complete the wagering requirement. Of course, that decreases the players chances on completing the wagering requirement and it also reduces the chance that a player gets some huge winning while playing with bonus money. That's why the size of bets is capped. Just in case it actually happens and the player wins a lot, then another rule comes in play - the "max. withdrawal limit from a bonus"</p>
<p>On the other hand, I remember numerous occasions when we favoured the player when it came to breaching this rule. It's typically in a case when the player plays a lot of spins, but breaches the max. bet one or two times without winning anything from it. In such a case, it's clear that the player just did a mistake which can happen when you wager hundreds or thousands spins on various games. The fact the player didn't have any significant win from the spin also shows that the player didn't get any unfair advantage by doing the mistake.</p>
<p>We also ask casinos to look at these cases as individual cases. You shouldn't just void the winnings because the max. bet rule was breached. It's necessary to look at other bets, the player's behaviour etc.</p>
