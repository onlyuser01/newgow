<p>Manchester City’s new partnership is exciting news for the team. However, it comes as Britain is eyeing a ban on gambling sponsorships in the Premier League. While this measure is yet to become a reality, it is sure to shake up British soccer. Ahead of the publishing of the long-overdue white paper, the EPL teams proposed removing gambling sponsorships from the front of their shirts.</p>
