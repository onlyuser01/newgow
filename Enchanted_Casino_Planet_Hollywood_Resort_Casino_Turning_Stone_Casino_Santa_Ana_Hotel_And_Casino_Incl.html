    <h1>Enchanted Casino Planet Hollywood Resort Casino Turning Stone Casino Santa Ana Hotel And Casino Incl</h1>

<p>They wanted my bank data to make a transfer after they gave it to me and they told me it was not possible to make a transfer to pay off the Hulk win and seeing me forced. Since they told me they couldn't even put them on my credit card with whom I paid the money to be able to play opted for the withdrawal by virtual credit card as the only means of payment for an amount of € 350 made this operation sent me an email telling me that I would find a link that would open the opening my credit card with all the data I had to take the screenshot and use it safely on the Internet Everything came on September 29th Today is October 14th and I still know nothing about that extra money yesterday I made another withdrawal for a another win of € 150 I can open the link Finally I get the credit card photo and behind opening another page the cvv the secret code proves it or on eBay and it doesn't work I try it on Groupon and it doesn't work I think I buy a plane ticket and it doesn't even go even and I try to pay money on their own casino and it doesn't work anyway in conclusion they are 20 days that I write in an interrupted way with chat but they make fun of me every day</p>
