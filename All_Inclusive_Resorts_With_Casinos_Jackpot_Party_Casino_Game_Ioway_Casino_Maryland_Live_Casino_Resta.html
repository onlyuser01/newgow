    <h1>All Inclusive Resorts With Casinos Jackpot Party Casino Game Ioway Casino Maryland Live Casino Resta</h1>

<p>I have also decided that for myself. I know it's hard to give a fair rating to any casino. But what has just happened on the part of Casinoguru is partly cheeky.</p>
<p>This complaint: https://casinoguru-de.com/spinpirate-casino-die-gewinnausnahmen-an-den-spieler has been unresolved for 3 weeks and the casino still has a 6.8 rating. In what way can one justify that?</p>
<p>There have been over 1,000 comments on this casino, most of which are negative, and the rating has not changed.</p>
<p>This is as much a stalling tactic as it is by the casino itself. Of course, I don't want to blame Casinoguru here. But as a user, you were not well advised here and are not protected, especially now.</p>
<p>There are certainly still players who go to Casinoguru, see the rating and deposit based on this rating. And something like that cannot be excused with the current knowledge.</p>
<p>You should at least issue a warning or point out that payments are currently pending etc. But unfortunately there is currently no action being taken.</p>
<p>So will no longer trust Casinoguru's advice.</p>
