    <h1>Four Winds Casino New Buffalo Hotel Gate City Casino The Cromwell Las Vegas Hotel Casino Largest Cas</h1>

<p>The World Series of Poker (WSOP) and GGPoker Network have announced that they are launching WSOP.ca, which is now available to Canadian players in Ontario, the first province to fully regulate private iGaming and sports betting. WSOP is entering Ontario as a legitimate entity that has an official permit to conduct iGaming business.</p>
<p>Ontario Now Has Brand New Place to Play Poker</p>
<p>This will considerably expand the reach of the WSOP platform as its localized Canadian domain will focus on providing players with the opportunity to play poker in various recreational and competitive formats. Players with existing GGPoker will have to make the move to WSOP.ca. They will be able to verify and transfer everything from one platform to the next.</p>
<p>Verification is mandatory, however, before the transfer can happen. WSOP will also be hosting events to celebrate the launch of the WSOP.ca website and platform. This will include the Ontario WSOP Online Circuit Series which will feature 12 WSOP Ring events, and which is already in progress. WSOP Rings are some of the most cherished rewards in the poker community, and they attest to achievement and often come with a good prize pot to take home as well.</p>
<p>WSOP bracelet winner and GGPoker Daniel Negreanu, who is a global ambassador for the brand, welcomed the opportunity to finally see the brand launch in Ontario, as he spent his childhood in Toronto. He said that he has always dreamt of playing in the World Series of Poker even when he was growing up in Toronto, something he achieved quickly over his vast poker career.</p>
<p>To pursue his dreams, though, Negreanu had to move to Las Vegas to pursue his dream and keep playing poker. However, Ontario fans need not do the same as they will now have the ability to participate in online WSOP events right from home and compete for actual WSOP bracelets and rings. “How cool is that,” Negreanu rhetorically said in a press release.</p>
<p>WSOP Happy to Offer Ontario Players This Chance</p>
<p>WSOP executive director Ty Stewart also said that the opportunity to bring WSOP events and online play to Canadian poker players is an amazing opportunity and one that he himself cherished. Stewart said that Ontario players (and Canadian players in general) will have the opportunity to compete for the right to gain entries into events that are taking place in the United States. GGPoker and WSOP are excited to be able to make this opportunity a reality, he added.</p>
