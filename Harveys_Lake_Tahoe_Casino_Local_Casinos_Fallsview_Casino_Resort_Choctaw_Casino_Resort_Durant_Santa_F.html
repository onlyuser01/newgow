    <h1>Harveys Lake Tahoe Casino Local Casinos Fallsview Casino Resort Choctaw Casino Resort Durant Santa F</h1>

<p>Hello dear gamblers</p>
<p>I never thought that I would have to write a casino review...</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I think I fell for Justbit.</p>
<p>At first I was convinced that I had landed at a reputable and good Crypto Casino.</p>
<p>This was also confirmed, since everything went smoothly, I won, I lost, I paid in and also out again without any problems. I was also amazed at the speed of withdrawals.</p>
<p>Then it happened, I was going towards zero with my money and I was left with â‚¬6.12... won free spins with 50 cents and got some rollovers. Overall, I won around 193 euros in the first case!</p>
<p>Then, when the displayed profit should have been credited to my account, an error message came up:</p>
<p>"204 Unfortunately, there was an error communicating with the casino server. Please try reloading the page. If the error persists, contact casino support"</p>
<p>My profit of approx. 193 euros was not credited to the account. Restarting the slot didn't help either. I started the chat and described the problem and sent all the requested game histories. I was assured that it would be resolved soon and not to worry. Okay, I was sort of mollified. I continued playing with newly deposited money.</p>
<p>I started the same slot this time as a Megaways variant and this time played with 1.05 euros.</p>
<p>This time I even won 866.60 euros, I thought yup...</p>
<p>then the same error message: This time I even took a screenshot of the win, where you can also see this error message, the stake and the win amount.</p>
<p>I had sent all the desired histories, including additional screenshots, to support again.</p>
<p>For over a month now, I've been put off and told that it's the department's turn to fix my problem as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>The answers then look something like this:</p>
<p>I want your issue to be processed faster, our guys doing their better to solve it as soon as possible. Your patience is highly appreciated.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>VIP Department JustBit Casino</p>
<p>After 3 weeks of chatting, I was referred to an email address by the Vip Manager.</p>
<p>The email address you entered was wrong. Asked for the correction again in the chat and received it. But I've been put off there for over a week now and I shouldn't worry... all the ramblings and blah blah... ðŸ˜¡</p>
<p>Then something like this happens:</p>
<p>I fully understand your feelings, as I am a person too, and I would also be frustrated if I did not get a reply on my case for a long time. However, you can count on me, I would be really trying to get the updates and inform you about them ASAP!</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>VIP Department JustBit Casino</p>
<p>Now I have no hope of ever seeing those wins. Maybe they really do have some problem, but it never takes more than a month to find the solution.</p>
<p>I hereby warn everyone to deposit money here as long as they are constantly kidding meâ€¦.</p>
<p>I will keep digging and persevering and will keep you posted.</p>
<p>A total profit of around 1008 euros is therefore missing.</p>
<p>As long as I don't have this won money in my account and it can also be paid out, I see this company as a criminal organization!</p>
<p>Take it as a warning about Justbit!</p>
