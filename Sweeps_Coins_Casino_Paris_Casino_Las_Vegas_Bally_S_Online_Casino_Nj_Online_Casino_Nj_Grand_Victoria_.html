<p>Jackpot Express review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Jackpot Express is set aboard a diesel punk gambling ship. Though the reels are coy as to the type, one can probably imagine the riverboat casinos of the old West, but with an art deco setting.</p>
<p>The characters are two flappers, a boater-wearing cad, and a cap-wearing boatman. The other symbols are poker chips with card suits on them.</p>
<p>The world is built well, as is the case for most Yggdrasil Gaming slots, though it is a little quiet and plain. It wouldn’t have taken much to liven up the theme a little.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>Jackpot Express has a lovely set of visuals. From the idyllic background that evokes a kind of The Great Gatsby-esque vision of New York state, to the characters you meet on the deck of the gambling boat, everything has been given a bit of flair and a style that works.</p>
<p>The animations help sell all this. When you win, each symbol is animated. The poker chips just grow, but the characters each have a little action that they go through along with the win and spin sound effects.</p>
<p>The music is a jazzy piano track with a little brass band accompaniment. It works nicely with the flappers and the dandies to set the scene and create a little world to get lost in.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Jackpot Express has a base game that uses five reels and three rows. There are twenty winlines. Where Jackpot Express’s gameplay really shines is in the bonuses though (fuller details in the section below).</p>
<p>The bonus games are varied, with one jackpot game and three different kinds of free spins.</p>
<p>This keeps things varied and interesting.</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Bonus symbol.</p>
<p>Landing three or more Bonus symbols anywhere on the reels triggers the Jackpot Bonus and one of three Free Spin Bonuses. Which Free Spin Bonus the player gets is randomised.</p>
<p>The Jackpot Bonus is made up of three Wheel-of-Fortune-style wheels inside each other. The player spins the outermost one first. The spins can award the player a multiple of the player's bet, the player can also receive an additional spin of the wheel with or without a x2 multiplier.</p>
<p>Each wheel has an arrow symbol on it. If the player’s spin lands on the arrow, they get a new spin on the next wheel out. The wheels have better prizes the further out they are. Each reel also has a Jackpot symbol that awards one of the progressive jackpots. The centre reel can award the Mini Jackpot, the middle reel awards the Side Jackpot, and the outermost reel awards the Major Jackpot.</p>
<p>The Free Spin Bonuses award either: Sticky Wilds, Multipliers, or a combination of both.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.20%, just above our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.20 up to a maximum of $/£/€100. per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is medium/low, which makes it a poor match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>With its fun world and pretty designs, this slot has makes an attractive first impression. This is backed up by fun gameplay and a variety of bonus games.</p>
<p>In fact, we like most aspects of this slot with the exception that it won’t work well with our slot strategies thanks to the low volatility of the game.</p>
<p>If volatility isn’t an area of concern for you though, this could be a fun place to play out your fantasies of dancing like, or with, a flapper.</p>
