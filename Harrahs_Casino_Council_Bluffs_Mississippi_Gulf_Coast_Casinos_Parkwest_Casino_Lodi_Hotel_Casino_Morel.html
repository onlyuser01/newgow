<p>Wolf Sistemas is a reliable provider of white-label sports betting platforms that recently expanded into iGaming</p>
<p>Salsa Technology, an expert in iGaming solutions, has signed another content provision agreement, this time with Wolf Sistemas, a Brazilian platform provider. As per the deal, the former company will leverage its Salsa Gator aggregation solution to level up its new partner’s online casino offering.</p>
<p>The agreement will see Salsa Technologies provide Wolf Sistemas with content that meets the expectations of its gaming partners. The Salsa Gator aggregation division sports a rich selection of gaming content from Salsa’s in-house dev team, Salsa Studio, and third-party providers.</p>
<p>Salsa Technologies has existing aggregation deals with over 80 providers of gaming content. The Salsa Gator content library encompasses games from many industry-leading studios, such as Spribe, High5Games, Spinomenal, RedRake, PG Soft, Hacksaw, Evolution and Pragmatic Play, among others.</p>
<p>All of this content is available to Salsa Technology’s partnering operators through a single integration.</p>
<p>Wolf Sistemas was founded 8 years ago and has cemented itself as a reliable provider of white-label sports betting platforms. At first, the company focused on sportsbooks but eventually expanded to include bingo, casino and lottery systems as well.</p>

<p>Eliane Nunes, Salsa Technology’s head of marketing &amp; sales, commented on the new content agreement with Wolf Sistemas, saying that she is happy to join forces with the platform provider. Nunes praised Wolf Sistemas’ extensive presence in the LATAM market and vowed to further level up its products.</p>
<p>Our Salsa Gator offering will slot perfectly on its platform and raise its casino experience to a new level. Eliane Nunes, head of marketing &amp; sales, Salsa Technology</p>
<p>Meanwhile, João Honorato de Morais Neto, director at Wolf Sistemas, said that his team prides itself on its visionary approach and successful trajectory. He noted that the positive feedback from his company’s multiple partnering sports betting operators attests to the quality of Wolf Sistemas’ products.</p>
<p>The director added that he is excited to expand the range of products it can offer to its partners.</p>
<p>This partnership with Salsa will enable us to offer our operators a vast content of casino games and meet the demand of clients and their players. João Honorato de Morais Neto, director, Wolf Sistemas</p>
<p>A few days ago, Salsa Technology also penned a content agreement with Darwin Gaming. Earlier this month, on the other hand, the supplier leveraged Salsa Gator to supply content to RSA, another gambling platform provider.</p>
