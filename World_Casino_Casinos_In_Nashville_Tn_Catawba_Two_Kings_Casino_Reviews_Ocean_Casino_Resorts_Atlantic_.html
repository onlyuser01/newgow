<p>Kambi Group has extended its partnership with AB Trav och Galopp (ATG), a Swedish horse racing and sports betting company. Under the agreement, the former party will continue to supply its Swedish client with cutting-edge solutions.</p>
<p>The two parties originally joined forces in 2018, allowing Kambi to roll out its products in Sweden. The partnership agreement helped ATG dominate the Swedish market, cementing itself as a leader in the local regulated sports betting sector.</p>
<p>Operating as a retail and online betting brand, ATG operates around 1,500 shops in the country. Kambi’s technology and sportsbook solutions will continue to power the gambling company’s business, supporting it with reliable AI-powered trading and a variety of differentiation capabilities.</p>
<p>The deal with ATG is the seventh agreement Kambi has signed this year. Earlier, the provider extended its arrangements with a selection of notable partners, including Corredor Empresarial, LeoVegas, Paf, Rank Group, Rush Street Interactive and Sun International.</p>
<p>ATG Trusts Kambi’s Solutions</p>
<p>ATG welcomed the continued collaboration with Kambi. The betting operator’s chief executive officer, Hans Lord Skarplöth, commented on the matter, praising the supplier’s unparalleled sports betting technology.</p>
<p>The CEO noted that Kambi’s solutions have played an important role in ATG’s continued growth and remarkable success. He added that his team is excited to continue working with the company.</p>
<p>We look forward to continuing this productive partnership as we strive to deliver exciting sports betting experiences to our customers. Hans Lord Skarplöth, CEO, ATG</p>
<p>Kambi’s co-founder and chief executive officer, Kristian Nylén, also shared his thoughts on the agreement. He said that his team’s strategy is to form strong relationships with market leaders. In ATG, Kambi sees a valued and reliable partner, Nylén noted.</p>
<p>A sportsbook which offers the flexibility for operators to differentiate is vital in such a highly competitive market, and this partnership exemplifies our ability to deliver long-term value to our network of partners, solidifying our position as the industry’s leading sports betting supplier. Kristian Nylén, co-founder &amp; CEO, Kambi Group</p>
<p>In other news, Kambi recently penned an expansion of its agreement with LeoVegas. Now owned by MGM Resorts, the latter company will be responsible for operating the BetMGM brand in the lucrative UK market. As a result, LeoVegas employed Kambi’s services, powering the brand with the supplier’s state-of-the-art solutions.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Kambi posted its Q2 results, reporting that it continues to go from strength to strength.</p>
