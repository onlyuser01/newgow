<p>On Tuesday, the Kentucky Council on Problem Gambling issued a statement, according to which Boulware Mission in Owensboro has started to offer residential treatment to people with gambling disorders.</p>
<p>First Gambling Disorders Center in Kentucky</p>
<p>The substance abuse center is the first in the state of Kentucky that offers both outpatient and residential treatment for gambling addiction. The treatment services will be provided to adult men between 18 and 75.</p>
<p>RonSonLyn Clark, who is the coordinator of the addiction recovery program at Boulware, commented that the issue of gambling addiction in Kentucky was getting bigger and bigger and this led to the decision to offer such a service.</p>
<p>Michael R. Stone, executive director of the Kentucky Council on Problem Gambling, also stated that this treatment is highly needed because of the increasing problem gambling and disorders.</p>
<p>Gambling in Kentucky Begins to Highlight Addiction Problem</p>
<p>According to statistics, 5 percent of the Kentucky population could suffer from gambling problems or addiction. A survey from IPSOS released in 2021 by the National Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG) reported that 78 percent of adult Kentuckians were engaged in gambling activities last year and over $2 billion was spent on legal gambling.</p>
<p>The government of Kentucky was to receive approximately $2 billion in revenue in 2022. Per the latest conducted study in the state, there were 64,000 addicted gamblers, 165,000 problem gamblers, and 15,000 Kentucky college students who experienced a gambling problem. 26 percent of high school seniors have been engaged in gambling activities at least once in their lifetimes.</p>
<p>The Kentucky Council on Problem Gambling, founded in 1995, is a non-profit organization, which is dedicated to increasing the awareness of gambling disorders, providing education and assistance, and advocating for treatment.</p>
<p>More Funds Needed for Adequate Treatment</p>
<p>In October 2022, advocates from Responsible Gambling met Kentucky lawmakers to discuss potential public funding for addiction and problem gambling treatments and campaigns for raising awareness.</p>
<p>Mike Stone, executive director for the Kentucky Council on Problem Gambling, met with members of the Interim Joint Committee on Licensing, Occupations, and Administrative Regulations and spoke about the growing numbers of gambling addicts and other people with problem gambling behaviors.</p>
<p>The council asked the state authorities to allocate resources from tax revenues gained from gaming operations for the payment of treatment services and awareness and prevention initiatives.</p>
<p>Boulware Mission Inc is an alcohol and drug detox rehabilitation center, which focuses on substance abuse treatment services. It provides substance abuse treatment as well as long-term, comprehensive services for homeless men.</p>
