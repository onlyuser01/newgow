    <h1>Casino Matrix 8 River Spirit Casino Concerts Planet Hollywood Resort And Casino Casino Resorts In Fl</h1>

<p>I was told that their turnaround times for withdrawals was 2 days and that would have my money on Monday. I submitted my documents and made my "verification deposit" so I could get my withdrawal within minutes of their request. I received a call from a guy that said all of my documents were approved and that I would be receiving my money on that next Monday. Well come Monday, I receive nothing, so I call in and they say that they are having issues with the bitcoin withdrawal process. Same Tuesday, but then they tell me I could get my withdrawal in the form of credit account that I would be able to use at their casinos only. Fishy... So I declined and on Wednesday their issue was resolved, except this time, my file had gone in for the final audit before I could receive my payout. Come Friday now, they tell me that my documents had been approved and that my payout would be processed with the next batch of payouts, which now is on the next Monday. Well its Monday at 10 PM and I still have not received my withdrawal, so I call in and now they tell me, once again, that my file is in for final audit and that my payout will be processed with the next batch of payments, which this time will be on Wedensday. They have continuously lied to me about where my file is at, everything matches up, there would be no reason to audit my ID against my proof of address for two weeks. They need to be blacklisted. I want my money, but now they are resorting to hanging up on me when I call or chat.</p>
