<p>The acquisition of Wundermachine is expected to play a key role in the future growth and expansion of Jelly Entertainment</p>
<p>Jelly Entertainment, the fast-growing UK-based iGaming developer, has announced the completion of the acquisition of Wundermachine, a leading provider of technology and social gaming content. The acquisition represents an important part of Jelly’s plan for growth and expansion on a global scale.</p>
<p>By acquiring Wundermachine, the company anticipates strengthening some of its strategic operations, including distribution, delivery, as well as engaging with fresh talent. Ultimately, the acquisition of the social gaming business-to-business (B2B) provider is expected to propel Jelly’s growth, allowing the company to solidify its position as a B2B supplier for the online gambling vertical.</p>
<p>Currently, Jelly’s content is renowned for its quality, engaging features and unique mechanics. An ongoing goal for the company is to deliver omnichannel entertainment with its creative and cutting-edge games. Thanks to the new acquisition, Jelly will boost its distribution capabilities, enabling it to reach customers across the globe via different channels.</p>
<p>Moreover, the takeover enables talent from Wundermachine to engage with Jelly’s dedicated and experienced employees. The acquisition will see Wundermachine’s employees retain their current office. With that in mind, the company’s real-money gambling and social gaming teams are going to actively collaborate with Jelly, helping it improve its growth strategies.</p>
<p>The latest announcement comes after this autumn, Jelly joined forces with Yggdrasil for the release of Beasty Blox GigaBlox, a new jungle adventure-themed slot with an RTP of 95% and 4,096 paylines. The engaging high-volatility slot, offering €250,000 max win invites the players on a thrilling adventure.</p>
<p>The Acquisition Brings Excitement to the Duo</p>
<p>Bjorn Kaufmann, Wundermachine’s CEO, explained that the company was created with the goal of developing unique products for the real-money gambling and social gaming vertical. Finally, he pointed out: “We’re passionate people, about what we do and how we deliver it. Together; we are certain that, as part of Jelly Entertainment, our teams will flourish.”</p>
<p>The acquisition of Wundermachine by Jelly comes at a time when the company continues to grow its portfolio of games. Jelly anticipates releasing Wicked Riches of Oz and Midas Riches, among other thrilling and engaging titles very soon.</p>
<p>“We are delighted to welcome the Wundermachine team into the Jelly Entertainment family.“ David Newstead, managing director for Jelly Entertainment</p>
<p>David Newstead, Jelly’s managing director, was excited about the latest acquisition. He predicted that Wundermachine would play a key role in Jelly’s growth across markets such as North and Latin America, as well as Europe. What’s more, Newstead said that the company is positioned well to grow exponentially in the next 12 months. Finally, he said that Jelly is looking forward to the benefits the new acquisition would bring.</p>
