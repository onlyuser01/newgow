<p>The leading US land-based gaming company, Bally’s Corporation, signed a multi-year contract with the NBA to become its authorized sports betting operator.</p>
<p>Bally’s Corp Signs Long-term Partnership Deal with NBA</p>
<p>Bally’s Corp. has inked a long-term partnership with NBA to become its authorized sports betting operator. Under the agreement, Bally’s will get rights to use official NBA logos, official league data, and the NBA marks on its online sports wagering products portfolio. The company will also work hand-in-hand with the NBA to help protect the integrity of the game.</p>
<p>This partnership is the gaming provider’s second sports betting deal with a professional league after it collaborated with the NHL. Bally’s Corp. stated that the idea behind the collaboration with the association is to transform the way fans engage with teams. With two of the biggest professional sports leagues, Bally’s goal is to become a leader in iGaming and sports wagering.</p>
<p>President and chief executive officer of Bally’s, George Papanier, said that this partnership is part of the company’s increasing momentum in collaborating with professional leagues. He stated that it is a very important deal that will allow the company to provide NBA’s fans with entertaining sports wagering products.</p>
<p>Bally’s Is Strategically Paving Its Way to the Top</p>
<p>Recently, Bally’s entered the world of daily fantasy as it acquired the 3rd largest DFS operator in the United States, Monkey Knife Fight (MKF). Under the deal, Bally’s acquired the platform and became one of the operators in the country to cover DFS selections. Its goal is to provide the best quality sports betting experience to its fans.</p>
<p>FanDuel, the largest sportsbook operator in the US, last year announced to open a temporary sportsbook at Bally’s Casino, Atlantic City. Bally’s will also host in-person sports betting lounge by FanDuel in the spring of 2021.</p>
<p>Bally’s also continues its land-based projects. Bally’s recently announced its project to build a world-class resort in Richmond, Virginia, that could open doors in 2024. The company submitted the proposal for the project with an estimated cost of approximately $650 million. It would include a 4-star hotel, a state-of-the-art casino, and a place for live entertainment conferences. The world-class resort would spread over 1.6 million sq. feet on the west side of Richmond, Virginia.</p>
<p>Last year, Bally’s announced a strategic partnership with Sinclair Broadcast Group, whose 19 regional sports networks account for more than half of the US NBA teams.</p>
