<p>Mark Cuban has vocalized his desire for state lawmakers in Texas to legalize casino play in the form of resort-style gambling</p>
<p>The owner of the Dallas Mavericks and ABC’s Shark Tank, Mark Cuban, has once again proven his unwavering support for the legalization of casino gambling by expressing his desire for lawmakers to consider legalizing resort-style gambling in the state.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, in May, the billionaire who is known for being one of the Lone Star State’s most prominent long-time casino proponents said the introduction of casinos would turn it into an excellent destination for tourists while significantly boosting its economic profile.</p>
<p>In December 2022, Cuban also expressed his ambitious plans to turn the Dallas Mavericks Arena into a Vegas-style destination by changing its current American Airlines Center headquarters to a much larger and more appealing venue.</p>
<p>“Resort Gaming Would Have a Huge Impact” on Tourism</p>
<p>Over the years, the Shark Tank investor who has committed to the 16th season of the iconic show, has been striving to bring some important changes to the way Texas is perceived by tourists.</p>
<p>Namely, Cuban argued that when someone is thinking of all the places they would like to save up for an upcoming vacation, “Texas isn’t one of them”.</p>
<p>He added that the state does not represent a genuine travel destination that someone would be willing to pay for, an issue that could find a quick fix with the help of resort gaming. In his opinion, this would draw in more people due to the fresh amenities and the potentially Vegas-style atmosphere.</p>
<p>In 2022, the businessman who is also a film producer and investor with a net worth estimated at over $5.1 billion, spoke about his vision to partner with Las Vegas Sands and build a new arena for the National Baseball Association team “in the middle of a resort and casino”.</p>
<p>Hope for a Brighter Future</p>
<p>In spite of the Texas House shutting down the legislation that would have given the green light for casino resorts as envisioned by him, Cuban has not lost all hope for the future.</p>
<p>This April, he invested $18.5 million into the American Airlines Center for the purchase of new seats and video boards. The center, which Cuban called “a great sports town” for sports aficionados, represents the Dallas area’s Premier Sports and Entertainment arena.</p>
<p>The center is also home to the National Hockey League’s Dallas Stars and NBA’s Dallas Mavericks.</p>
<p>For the time being, Cuban will remain focused on the growth of his company, Cost Plus Drugs, which focuses on disrupting big pharma. Earlier this week, he held a speech in front of hundreds of business owners at Chase’s Make Your Move Summit in Frisco, where he strongly encouraged entrepreneurship while he explained his path to success.</p>
