<p>Maymann is set to step into the office in January</p>
<p>Romania’s sports betting leader, Superbet Group, has reinforced its leadership with the appointment of a new chief executive officer. The one up to the task is Jimmy Maymann who is set to step into the office on January 15, 2024.</p>
<p>Maymann originally joined the company in May, first stepping into the position of deputy chair of the company’s board of directors. Boasting years of corporate experience at various senior and board-level positions, Maymann has an impressive track record as an innovator and entrepreneur.</p>
<p>Maymann specializes in the foundation and development of technology and media service, telecom and NGO companies. His track record includes the creation and development of more than 10 companies and a number of successful sales. This includes the video content platform GoViral, which was eventually acquired by the American company AOL.</p>
<p>Maymann’s prior experiences also include time as CEO of The Huffington Post.</p>
<p>On January 15, 2024, Maymann will replace the incumbent CEO, Johnny Hartnett. As a result of this corporate change, Hartnett will step down and will join the board as a non-executive director.</p>
<p>Maymann Is Looking Forward to Leading the Company</p>
<p>Superbet Group’s board chairman, Hans Hogler-Albrecht, praised Maymann’s impressive background and expertise, saying that he would be a perfect addition to the leadership team. Hogler-Albrecht said that Superbet is confident that Maymann will have a strong positive impact on the operator’s strategy and business model.</p>
<p>Maymann also commented on his new appointment, saying that he is delighted to assume the new role and offer his expertise to the company. He is looking forward to helping Superbet become a global leader in the technology and entertainment sector.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Hartnett commented on his departure, saying that his five years as CEO have been “the ride of a lifetime.” He thanked the colleagues who gave him their support and expressed he hopes Superbet will continue to grow.</p>
<p>Hartnett promised to ensure a seamless transition of responsibilities to Maymann and expressed his desire to continue to work with Superbet as a part of the company’s board of directors.</p>
<p>Superbet was founded in 2008 and is the biggest sports betting operator in Romania. The company boasts backing from a number of big shareholders, including Blackstone. Superbet operates in a number of markets outside of Romania, including Serbia, Belgium and Poland.</p>
