<p>The big news of the week is that soccer GOAT Lionel Messi has agreed to sign for Inter Miami, a team that’s currently sitting at the very bottom of the Eastern Conference. It’s gonna be a while before “The Messiah” makes his debut and his new teammates are determined to welcome him from a better position in the standings.</p>
<p>They want to get away from the bottom, which they could manage if they beat the New England Revolution on Saturday evening. So, can they pull it off? Oddsmakers aren’t so sure about that as the Javier Morales-led team is on a horrible run in the league.</p>
<p>Actually, neither team can be proud of its recent form, as both are without a win in the 2023 MLS in over a month. However, the New England Revolution did draw its last three games in the league. Meanwhile, Inter Miami is on a five-game skid.</p>

<p>Can New England Revolution Stay Undefeated at Home</p>
<p>In the 2023 MLS season, the New England Revolution is sitting in fourth place in the East with 27 points after 16 games. Bruce Arena’s team has a record of 7-6-3 and a score differential of 25-20.</p>
<p>What’s interesting is that none of New England’s losses happened in Foxborough. In fact, these guys are 4-3-0 at home in 2023, with a goals difference of 15-6. Further, the last time they played against Inter Miami at Gillette Stadium, they won 2-0.</p>

<p>As you’d expect from a team managed by Bruce Arena, New England is very good at the back. The reason why The Revs have an average of 1.25 goals conceded per game in 2023 is that they’ve played against some really attacking-minded teams so far.</p>
<p>For instance, they drew 3-3 with Chicago Fire the last time they played at Gillette Stadium. After that match, they went to Georgia and played 3-3 with Atlanta United. However, in their most recent game, the Revs played 0-0 with NYCFC in New York, proving once again that they know how to defend.</p>
<p>Inter Miami Players on Cloud Nine After Messi News</p>
<p>Who would’ve thought that Lionel Messi was going to pick Inter Miami as his next destination? By doing it, he broke the hearts of PSG fans, Barcelona fans, and everyone else who was dreaming about seeing the soccer GOAT wear their club’s jersey. But “The Messiah” has spoken – he’s decided to become a new member of the Inter Miami roster.</p>
<p>Of course, it will take time before we see him on the pitch. Nevertheless, the news has certainly made a huge impact on what’s going on in Inter Miami’s locker room. The spirits are high, there’s no doubt about it, and every single player will give their utmost on Saturday to help move the team away from the bottom.</p>
<p>The good news is that even without Messi, the David Beckham-owned club does have a pretty decent squad. In fact, some believe that the reason why they’re sitting at the bottom of the Eastern Conference is that their former manager Phil Neville did not do a very good job. But he’s gone now and the interim coach Javier Morales will lead “The Herons” on Saturday.</p>
<p>His boys are decent at the back, but their offense definitely needs to improve. Sure, Messi’s arrival will fix that, but in the meantime, Inter Miami’s attackers need to up their game.</p>
<p>“The Herons” haven’t scored more than one goal in the last five MLS games, which is surprising because they’ve got some really talented players in the final third – Josef Martinez, Leonardo Campana, Corentin Jean, and so on.</p>
<p>New England Revolution vs. Inter Miami Prediction</p>
<p>Inter Miami’s rise to stardom starts now, even before Lionel Messi’s joined the club officially. His new teammates are coming to Foxborough feeling pumped, and when the atmosphere in the locker room is great, great things usually happen on the pitch. It won’t be easy to find the net on Saturday, but we think “The Herons” will pull it off at least once.</p>
<p>Picks: Inter Miami to win &amp; under 2.5 goals</p>
