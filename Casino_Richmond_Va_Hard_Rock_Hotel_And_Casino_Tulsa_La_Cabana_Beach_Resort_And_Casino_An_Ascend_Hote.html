    <h1>Casino Richmond Va Hard Rock Hotel And Casino Tulsa La Cabana Beach Resort And Casino An Ascend Hote</h1>

<p>Good evening,</p>
<p>I registered with GamStop in May 2018 and again renewed my GamStop registration on the 5/11/19 due to gambling becoming a problem in my every day life. My self exclusion runs for 5 years.</p>
<p>This week I had a slip up and registered at sportsbetio.uk. I have deposited £1200 without ANY checks on ID and despite using the bank card (I’ve had the same account for 21 years), my home address (on GamStop) etc. I believe I’ve been considerably let down by sportsbetio and believe that had I won and tried to withdraw I would have had my account found to be against rules and winnings denied.</p>
<p>I wish to complain strongly to get my deposits back (as I said I think any winnings would’ve been held back) and help them for future problem gamblers.</p>
<p>Please can you advise.</p>
<p>thank you,</p>
<p>Marc R<strong><em>*</em></strong></p>
