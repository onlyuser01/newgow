    <h1>Bristol Casino Restaurants At Mohegan Sun Casino In Connecticut Casinos In North Carolina Circa Casi</h1>

<p>Greeting. I'm only interested in one thing, like probably most of the players. How and why do you give such a high rating to a casino that has so many complaints and complaints both on your site and on other sites. I don't understand how you can give such an obviously thieving and fraudulent casino the same rating as some really honest and good casinos. I really use your site every day as a kind of guide, i.e. an indicator of which casinos are correct and good and which ones I should avoid. I want to continue to rely on your site and your experience and knowledge, but if you give such ratings to such casinos, I am afraid that I will have to start avoiding using your site as well. I have read and I know what your criteria are for evaluating casinos, but I think that you and I and other players know that this is not correct in the case of this casino. This is the first casino I wrote a comment about two months ago, and I'm only writing this now because a similar situation happened to my friend, only that in his case it was about much more money. I'm sorry that he doesn't want to write a comment and complain, so I'm writing this on his behalf, but I think it's really not fair to other casinos as well as to other players that you rate obvious thieves as very good. I apologize for the comment, but this is the truth about this casino because I was convinced of it and saw it with my own eyes.</p>
