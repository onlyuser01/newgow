<p>A 69-year-old casino player — tailed by an alleged bandit while inside Rhode Island’s Twin River Casino — was later robbed at knifepoint Saturday night while in his car, according to police reports. A suspect was arrested a short time later and was being held without bail this weekend.</p>
<p>The suspect got hold of the wallet and scooped out an undisclosed amount of cash. He then tossed the wallet back at the man, who remained in the driver’s seat.</p>
<p>Cash, Cell Phone Robbed</p>
<p>The victim’s cell phone and glasses were also stolen. The suspect additionally searched the victim’s clothes before fleeing into the casino. He later drove away in a gray Toyota with Massachusetts license plates that had been parked in another lot, WJAR reported, based on police reports.</p>
<p>Lincoln Police Captain Philip Gould said police were notified about the hold-up shortly before 6:30 p.m.</p>
<p>Police said they were able to trace the suspect’s identity by photos and video, allegedly of the victim and the car, supplied by casino security.</p>
<p>Police identified the robber as Anthony McClain, 30. The car was registered to an address in Massachusetts. But when police checked, there was also a connection to a residence in Pawtucket, Rhode Island.</p>
<p>Pawtucket police located the car and said McClain was allegedly near the auto when they arrived. Police claim he was wearing the same clothing as the robbery suspect.</p>
<p>Police added McClain had a knife when he was apprehended. McClain allegedly had been following the 69-year-old through Twin River earlier on Saturday, the Providence Journal reported.</p>
<p>He was charged with first-degree robbery. He was arraigned in Rhode Island court and on Sunday was being held without bail at the Adult Correctional Institution in Cranston.</p>
<p>If convicted, he could face between 10 years and life in prison. He could also be ordered to pay up to $15,000 in fines.</p>
<p>Twin River Robber Sentenced in December</p>
<p>In December, a Boston man was sentenced to six years in prison after pleading guilty to robbing a woman in a parking lot at Twin River Casino. Anthony Harris, 27, pleaded guilty to a single count of first-degree robbery.</p>
<p>He allegedly stole a purse from the woman as she walked back to her car, according to the Providence Journal.</p>
<p>Superior Court Justice Luis M. Matos sentenced Harris to prison for just six of 12 years. For the other six years, he was given probation, The Journal said.</p>
<p>The judge also ordered Harris not to contact the victim. He must also pay $590 in restitution to the woman, The Journal added.</p>
<p>Last month, a former Twin River Casino executive was named in a Rhode Island grand jury indictment for his alleged involvement in a kickback scheme with a casino vendor.</p>
<p>Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha (D) alleged that Michael Barlow used his position as vice president of food and beverage at Twin River to orchestrate a kickback deal with casino vendor Yehuda Amar.</p>
<p>Barlow was charged with 12 counts, including accepting a bribe, obtaining property under false pretenses, and casino gaming crimes.</p>
<p>Amar was charged with 21 counts, including bribery, obtaining property under false pretenses, conspiracy to obtain property under false pretenses, and failures to file corporate and personal income tax returns.</p>
<p>Amar’s business associate, Jill Feldman, was additionally charged with six counts relating to tax crimes.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, last month a Pennsylvania man was arrested for allegedly abducting an 84-year-old woman from the Wind Creek Bethlehem casino garage and later robbing and repeatedly striking her.</p>
<p>Hykeem Rasmeen Sessoms, 38, of Bethlehem, was charged with kidnapping, robbery, threat of serious bodily injury, terroristic threats, theft, receiving stolen property and simple assault, the local prosecutor’s office confirmed.</p>
