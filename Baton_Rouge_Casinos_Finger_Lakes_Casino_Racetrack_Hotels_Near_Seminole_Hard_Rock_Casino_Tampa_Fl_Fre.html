    <h1>Baton Rouge Casinos Finger Lakes Casino Racetrack Hotels Near Seminole Hard Rock Casino Tampa Fl Fre</h1>

<p>Dear Pascal46,</p>
<p>Thank you for contacting us. Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. I checked the casino’s T&amp;Cs and I found this:</p>
<p>"8. CLOSING AND TERMINATION OF YOUR PLAYER ACCOUNT</p>
<p>8.1. You have the right to close Your Player Account at any time by contacting customer support or through Your Player Account. Upon closing Your Player Account We will refund You any balance in Your Player Account. Closure of Your Player Account will effectively end the relationship between You and SlotJoint as stipulated in these Terms and Conditions. When You close Your Player Account You must disclose the reason for closing Your Player Account. If You do not disclose the reason for closing Your Player Account then it will be assumed that Your reason is not related to a gambling problem."</p>
<p>There are two options when it comes to closing the account:</p>
<p>Close the account or self-exclusion</p>
<p>Closing an account is simple and has almost none impact - the player can reopen account anytime, and casino has no obligation to the player.</p>
<p>On the other hand, self-exclusion does. If the player successfully makes a self-exclusion the casino agree not to open this account or if yes only under particular circumstances. (After cooling off period and this cannot be done for players whos are addicted/with gambling problem).</p>
<p>Personally, I would recommend sending an email to support@slotjoint.com. Do not forget to state the reason for closing clearly, especially if you wish to self-exclude. If you ask only for closing the account, it can take a few days.</p>
<p>Regarding your pending withdrawal, I would like to know if your account has been verified, as this might cause the delay in processing your withdrawal.</p>
<p>Please, let me know if you need any assistance and keep me updated.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Kristina</p>
