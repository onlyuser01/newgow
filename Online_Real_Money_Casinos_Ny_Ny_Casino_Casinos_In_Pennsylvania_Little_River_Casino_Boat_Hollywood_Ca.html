<p>The British Columbia Lottery Corporation (BCLC) will expand its footprint in Western Canada through an agreement with the Saskatchewan Indian Gaming Authority (SIGA). The deal will see the former provide its proprietary PlayNow platform to the tribal operator.</p>
<p>BCLC Launches PlayNow through SIGA</p>
<p>The iGaming platform will launch in the Saskatchewan province at a later point in 2022. As per the agreement, it will be the one operating it will be the SIGA.</p>
<p>Thanks to the deal, Saskatchewan bettors will be able to access PlayNow’s varied offerings. The content will be fully localized and tailored to the local customers’ preferences. Therefore, players in the province will be able to play similar games to those they have grown to know and love. Additionally, punters will be able to engage in single-event sports betting – a betting format that became legal only a year ago.</p>
<p>The SIGA officially received the green light to provide online gaming options to the province last fall. Back then, the Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations inked an agreement with the province’s government that officially allowed it to offer iGaming in Saskatchewan.</p>
<p>The Deal Will Help Both Parties Grow Their Influence</p>
<p>Zane Hansen, the chief executive officer and president of the SIGA, shared that he is looking forward to bringing the full PlayNow online casino and sports betting experience to the province. He believes that PlayNow’s vision matches the SIGA’s and that its offerings will fit well with the tribal operator’s pre-existing retail operations. Hansen is sure that the deal will further enhance the entertainment options for customers of SIGA and SaskGaming.</p>
<p>Lynda Cavanaugh, the interim president and chief executive officer of the BCLC, also shared her thoughts on the matter. She said that the Corporation is proud to offer its industry-leading PlayNow platform to players in the province. Cavanaugh elaborated that this will allow local bettors to enjoy “the very best in online gambling entertainment.”</p>
<p>Cavanaugh lauded PlayNow’s safe and secure experience. She also asserted that it is one of the few websites in the world that offer dedicated player-health specialists.</p>
<p>The British Columbia Lottery Corporation is bullish on expanding beyond its native region. The company’s PlayNow platform is currently available in British Columbia and Manitoba. Notably, it is the only regulated online gambling option in both regions. Thanks to the deal, it will now cover an additional region as well.</p>
<p>One of the BCLC’s latest endeavors was a Super Bowl betting concept. The Corporation trialed it in British Columbia bars ahead of the Super Bowl LVI.</p>
