    <h1>Hard Rock Hotel Casino Hollywood Westgate Las Vegas Resort Casino Reno Casino Hotel Hampton Beach Ca</h1>

<p>it's a shame that a casino can do what it wants.</p>
<p>I deposited € 40 and got a 200% non sticky bonus.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I was quick to start with a few wins at around € 270.</p>
<p>So I made sure in the chat that it is non sticky and that I can cancel the bonuses.</p>
<p>After that, € 150 paid out and no reaction for 2 days (email or something)</p>
<p>I got the feeling, please don’t mess around and faxx, as I only recently had such a theater in another casino, which in the end paid me off, but blocked my account for no reason and without comment.</p>
<p>Today (day 3) I would like to log in again here: Account disabled by Administrator ''</p>
<p>Well, I thought .. it was clear ..</p>
<p>Important: I read through the ABG'S completely several times before playing and didn't break any rules.</p>
<p>So purely in customer support and what is the answer to the question of what about my account?</p>
<p>"You will receive an email soon, I cannot give you a reason beforehand and a reference (image attached screenshot) to point 3.11," We reserve the right to block accounts for no particular reason. "</p>
<p>I'm slowly losing my faith in casinos .. of course you know this clause that casinos create themselves to exclude any payout / any customer that could be expensive or without any reason, but that really goes too far.</p>
<p>The only thing missing is that they write me something and any related phrases by email and I don't even get my money.</p>
<p>Deposit: € 40</p>
<p>Open payout € 150</p>
<p>Real money credit at last login (09.10.2021) 160 €.</p>
