<p>Dak Prescott might return in Week 5, but oddsmakers don’t think it will matter much. They expect the Cowboys to lose to the Los Angeles Rams on Sunday. At the moment of writing the spread is set to 6.5 points, which may seem surprising knowing that the Rams beat the Cowboys by seven or more points only once in the last 13 years.</p>

<p>Who’s Going to Start at QB for Dallas in Week 5?</p>
<p>Dak Prescott could return from a thumb injury in Week 5, although Dallas coach Mike McCarthy might decide to leave him on the bench, not wanting to risk anything. The Cowboys have the luxury to do so as backup QB Cooper Rush has been really good in Prescott’s absence.</p>
<p>With him as the quarterback, the Cowboys won three games, the most recent of which was the game against the Washington Commanders in Week 4. Dallas won that game 25-10 with Rush throwing 15/27 for 233 yards and two touchdowns.</p>
<p>In Week 5, however, the Cowboys offense will be faced against one the toughest defensive teams in the NFL. That said, regardless of who plays in the QB role on Sunday, Dallas’ offense probably isn’t going to do much.</p>
<p>The Rams Offense Needs to Up Their Game</p>
<p>The Los Angeles Rams are coming off a disappointing loss to their NFC West rivals, the San Francisco 49ers. The Niners beat them 24-9, with the Rams’ offense scoring only three field goals.</p>
<p>Quarterback Matt Stafford had a bag game, throwing 32/48 for 254 yards and no touchdowns, while one of his passes was intercepted. Almost half of his throws were caught by WR Cooper Rush who had a decent game despite not scoring any TDs.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Rams defense did an okay job, especially in comparison to their offense. The Rams concede 24 points in total, but their defense allowed 17 of those – the Niners scored one touchdown after a turnover.</p>
