<p>The operator of the largest integrated resort (IR) in Cambodia, NagaWorld, announced the first 3 months of 2021 indicated recovery rate of the average daily volume of between 98.5% for electronic gaming machines (EGM) which generated $5.44 million, and 99.4% for table buy-ins which accounted for $3.74 million.</p>
