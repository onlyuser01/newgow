    <h1>Ip Casino Resort Spa Biloxi Ms Closest Casinos Near Me Choctaw Casino Resort Jackpot Party Casino Ga</h1>

<p>Frankfurt-listed operator Bet-at-home announced it has successfully migrated away from its in-house platform and adopted EveryMatrix’s comprehensive turnkey solution</p>
<p>Bet-at-home and EveryMatrix have solidified their existing partnership as the developer’s OddsMatrix solution goes live across all MGA-regulated markets, with a German launch soon to follow. EveryMatrix’s software suite offers various innovative features, promising to boost revenue and efficiency. The mutually beneficial agreement allows Bet-at-home to downsize its team, freeing up more resources to focus on future growth.</p>
<p>Bet-at-Home Is Still Recovering from Recent Misfortunes</p>
<p>The two companies announced their intent to extend their partnership in July 2022. Bet-at-home chose to gradually phase out its existing proprietary platform in favor of EveryMatrix’s comprehensive turnkey solution, powering the operator with a modern sportsbook, casino platform, player management, payments, and affiliate software. With the shift now complete, Bet-at-home faces some imminent changes.</p>
<p>The Tier-1 operator had a troubled 2022, withdrawing from the UK market after leaving Austria the previous year. The shock of these two events continues to impact the company’s bottom line, mostly offsetting any underlying growth. The shift to EveryMatrix’s technology stack is part of a broader consolidation effort, which will see up to 45 employees leave as their jobs get outsourced.</p>
<p>Adopting a new, more streamlined technology platform allows Bet-at-home to gather much-needed momentum, shake off its previous misfortunes and deal with looming macroeconomic challenges. The operator expects to acquire new licenses in Poland and the Netherlands, hoping its high brand recognition would net it a significant customer boost.</p>
<p>EveryMatrix Continues to Excel</p>
<p>Securing Bet-at-home as a core client maintains EveryMatrix’s streak of success. The developer enjoyed stellar 2022 financial results and began the new year with a bang, securing a partnership with Hungary’s national lottery operator. EveryMatrix CEO Ebbe Groes expressed excitement about the Bet-at-home deal, adding that the developer was quickly gaining popularity among global, tier-1 brands.</p>
<p>Going live with bet-at-home is a huge milestone for both our OddsMatrix sportsbook platform and for the business. Ebbe Groes, CEO of EveryMatrix</p>
<p>Bet-at-home was equally as positive regarding the deal. CEO Marco Falchetto lauded EveryMatrix’s positive results on the operator’s casino division, expressing hope that the success would translate equally to the sportsbook platform, which is responsible for most of the company’s profits. Bet-at-home plans a two-stage launch, beginning with the company’s Malta-licensed businesses, with Germany soon to follow.</p>
<p>The combination of (EveryMatrix’s) outstanding track record, best-in-class technology, and enormous expertise made this an easy choice. Marco Falchetto, CEO of Bet-at-home</p>
<p>Pursuing closer cooperation is immensely beneficial to both parties. Bet-at-home receives a superior technology solution, bolstering its operations while outsourcing a significant portion of the workload. EveryMatrix secures its ties with one of its most substantial and far-reaching customers to date, substantially improving its brand recognition and gaining access to new markets across Europe. With such a match made in heaven, the two companies can look forward to an outstanding 2023.</p>
