<p>Easter Island 2 review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Easter Island 2 is themed around the mysterious South Pacific island and its iconic statues.</p>
<p>Players will arrive in a holiday world where Easter Island’s statues have come to life to sing, dance, and wear stylish sunglasses.</p>
<p>The festive vibe of this game is alluring, however, some players might feel like the portrayal of the indigenous art of Easter Island is handled a little lightly.</p>
<p>Win in the Easter Island 2 slot</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The soundtrack is a leisurely whistle tune accented by the vocalizations of the iconic statues. Upon spins, an upbeat ukulele riff begins adding a festive tone.</p>
<p>On either side of the reels, players will see personified head statues wearing holiday attires and dancing. They seem to be cheerfully on holiday, and they enthusiastically cheer on the player’s wins.</p>
<p>On the reels, an array of animals can be found, including a smiling turtle and a stoic fox. This adds a sense of the natural world on Easter Island.</p>
<p>Beyond the reels is a sandy beach, palm trees, and a cruise ship in the distance. Players will be left in no doubt that this is a hot vacation spot.</p>
<p>Overall, the animation and soundtrack create a whimsical holiday atmosphere.</p>
<p>Super Big win in the Easter Island 2 slot machine</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Easter Island 2 is a six reel, four row slot with 25 win lines during the base game. During special features, this increases to 55 win lines.</p>
<p>Winning combinations are paid from left to right.</p>
<p>The gameplay moves swiftly and will hold players’ attention.</p>

<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all regular symbols.</p>
<p>When players land a 3-of-a-kind win during the base game, a Respin is triggered. A Respin awards the Symbol Swap feature.</p>
<p>If the winning symbols were low paying, the Symbol Swap triggers every other low paying symbol to be replaced by the winning symbols for the Respin.</p>
<p>If the winning symbols were high paying, the Symbol Swap transforms every other high paying symbol to match the winning symbols for the Respin.</p>
<p>Symbol Swap feature is transforming all high paying symbols into a single one</p>
<p>If players land a winning combination that is greater than 3-of-a-kind, they are awarded a Colossal Block to add to the reels. The greater the number of matching symbols in the triggering win, the larger the Colossal Block, up to a 4x4 Colossal Block. This also expands the reels and increases the win lines to 55.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96%, right on our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.25 up to a maximum of $/£/€300 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is medium, which makes it a less ideal match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We recommend this average RTP, medium volatility Easter Island-themed slot.</p>
<p>Though the subject matter may not be everyone’s jam, Easter Island 2 offers fun bonuses and a solid RTP.</p>
<p>Players with a mathematical mindset may prefer to hold out for more ferocious volatility slots, but Easter Island 2’s medium volatility is not tragically low.</p>
