<p>PA Betting Services is very happy that DAZN BET realizes the importance of having the right partners</p>
<p>PA Betting Services, a leading content and sports betting data supplier, has penned a multi-year deal to provide DAZN BET with racing data for horse and greyhound racing events. This will help DAZN BET expand its offering with premium content for racing enthusiasts.</p>
<p>As agreed, PA Betting Services will leverage its racing distribution platform to power DAZN BET with over 50,000 meetings a year. The supplier will provide data for events from the United States, Latin America, the United Kingdom, Ireland, France, South Africa and Australia, effectively covering five continents.</p>
<p>The multi-year agreement will help DAZN BET become a leading force in wagering on sports and racing. According to the company, its recent launch in the United Kingdom attests to the renewed vitality of the market and its openness to new entrants.</p>
<p>DAZN BET is certain that PA Betting services is a great partner that will help the betting operator make its name known among bettors while remaining compliant with local regulations.</p>
<p>DAZN BET Realizes the Importance of Having Reliable Partners</p>
<p>PA Betting Services’ head of business development and strategic partnerships, Richard Duncan, commented on the agreement. He said that his team is delighted by the opportunity to provide another major brand with sports data. Duncan added that he is happy that so many clients have chosen to trust PA Betting Services and adopt its 24/7 racing solutions.</p>
<p>According to Duncan, DAZN offers sports fans a premium first-class sports ecosystem. He praised its newly-launched sports betting brand, DAZN BET, for quickly understanding the importance of working with best-in-class suppliers.</p>
<p>Shane McLaughlin, DAZN BET UK’s managing director, also shared his thoughts on the matter. He explained that PA Betting Services’ appealing products were exactly the reason why DAZN picked them as its sports betting brand’s newest partner.</p>
<p>PA Betting Services’ consistent pre-race, race-day, and fixed odds racing coverage of over 50,000 events per year, paired with their close relationships to racing’s global rights owners made them a great choice for a partner – in a new multi-year agreement. Shane McLaughlin, MD, DAZN BET UK</p>
<p>DAZN BET’s Parent Company Has Been Struggling</p>
<p>While the new partnership is exciting, DAZN has faced some challenges in recent times. The sports media juggernaut, which hopes to one day go public, has been struggling with financial losses as it invested in key media rights.</p>
<p>DAZN’s ambition is to become a global media powerhouse like Amazon and Netflix and further improve the quality of its offering.</p>
<p>DAZN BET is the company’s sports betting subsidiary and was launched in 2022. While it has been faring well, its parent company hopes to keep it as a separate service and not rely on its proceeds.</p>
