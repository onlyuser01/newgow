    <h1>Casinos In Tulsa Perchanga Casino Joliet Casino Casino Niagara Canada Casinos In Santa Fe Kindred Si</h1>

<p>Kindred announced today its expansion across regulated US markets will continue as the sports wagering company entered into an agreement with Penn National Gaming to ensure market access to Illinois and Ohio.</p>
<p>The new agreement will provide access for Kindred’s brand, Unibet, to pursue licensing in Illinois, through Argosy Casino Alton, and in Ohio, through Hollywood Casino. Kindred is hoping to operate both online sports betting and online gaming, pending passing of applicable laws in the states and obtaining of all necessary gaming licenses by both the sports betting operator and its partner Penn National.</p>
<p>“Extending our footprint in the US by establishing our brand in two key states like Illinois and Ohio is very exciting for us. We continue our journey in what we believe will become the largest gambling market in the world.” Manuel Stan, Senior Vice President, Kindred US</p>
<p>Market Expansion Continues</p>
<p>Kindred is hoping for its operations in Illinois and Ohio to follow in the footsteps of its successful entries into New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Indiana. The sports betting and online gaming operator announced its intentions to continue to invest in growing its US operations where market conditions are supportive of a sustainable business model.</p>
<p>“Putting Illinois and Ohio on the list together with New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Iowa and Indiana, shows our commitment to establishing Unibet in the US. Illinois is one of the largest US states and it will be the next State that we are targeting to launch.” Manuel Stan, Senior Vice President, Kindred US</p>
<p>Ohio Entry Pending Sports Betting Legalization</p>
<p>Kindred’s entry into Ohio is pending the legalization of sports betting in the state, where the House of Representatives passed a bill to legalize both retail and mobile sports wagering. The bill that was approved by an 83-10 vote more than a year after it has been introduced, has still to progress further than the Senate floor.</p>
<p>Senate members introduced their own bill which would place regulatory responsibilities to the Ohio Casino Control Commission, instead of the Ohio Lottery in the bill the House proposed. Senate’s bill has yet to progress beyond the committee stage.</p>
<p>The agreement signed with Penn National Gaming will span over a 10-year period, and Kindred’s offering will continue to leverage the online gaming platform of Pala Interactive integrated with sports betting technology provided by Kambi.</p>
