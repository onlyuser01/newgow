<p>FuboTV subsidiary, Fubo Gaming, has gone ahead with the launch of its dedicated launch of Fubo Sportsbook in New Jersey earlier this week. The launch is billed as a "soft play phase" and follows the requirements set out by the Division of Gaming Enforcement in the Garden State via an agreement with Caesars Entertainment, Inc.</p>
<p>Sports fans who wish to access the sportsbook are able to do so. They need to meet the minimum gambling age requirement for New Jersey, which is set at 21, and have the opportunity to choose and pick from thousands of possible wagers. Fubo Sportsbook is also available as an Android and iOS app and can be accessed directly through the sportsbook’s website.</p>
<p>The launch of the sportsbook coincided with the rollout of the NFL season this week. This year’s NFL season is expected to attract a record number of sports gamblers according to the American Gaming Association, an industry trade body. Fubo Gaming will continue to seek and establish synergies between its multi-pronged branches, bringing the FuboTV platform closer to the sports betting experience and vice versa.</p>
<p>FuboTV has long been focused on reinventing the way sports fans approach sports entertainment. A core mission for the company has been to turn "passive viewers" into "active participants" in the sports experience, and the mass legalization of sports gambling has proven one of the ways to do this.</p>
<p>The company is happy with this rollout as it enables FuboTV to further deliver highly personalized onscreen experiences. Residents in New Jersey will benefit not only from a state-of-the-art betting platform but also have access to the "Watch &amp; Wager" feature, which imparts insights and leverages real-time data to help sports fans be in the know and make the best-informed decisions.</p>
<p>Fubo Gaming President Scott Butera welcomed this opportunity and praised the chance to be entering the Garden State. "Launching Fubo Sportsbook in New Jersey is an important early step in the development of our integrated platform, which includes a recently improved user experience and enhanced product capabilities," Butera added.</p>
<p>The executive remained confident that thanks to this launch, the company will be able to develop the most engaging product features that will drive TV audiences and transform them into active bettors further down the road. All of this will be done while delivering the most worthwhile products and features to sports fans in the state.</p>
<p>FuboTV CEO and co-founder David Gandler were equally pleased, agreeing with Butera, that the launch marked an important milestone for the company. The New Jersey rollout comes only ten months after the first Fubo Sportsbook was launched in Iowa in November.</p>
