<p>NeoGames’ subsidiary, Pariplay, has added fresh content from Live Solutions to its dedicated Fusion platform. As a result, one of the leading iGaming aggregators will be able to provide its partners with even more variety and new gaming options for their audiences.</p>
<p>Pariplay Continues to Build Up Its Fusion Platform</p>
<p>Live Solutions focuses on the development of Live Casino products. The company’s flagship product, Casino Floor Live, will offer players the opportunity to experience the “thrill of real-life casino tables.” This includes a sophisticated interaction with live presenters and fellow players thanks to state-of-the-art video streaming technology.</p>
<p>The games are based on Random Number Generator (RNG) algorithms, and they are server controlled to ensure transparency and fairness. Players can participate in the video chat and get to enjoy a gaming environment that is not unlike the setting at the best retail casinos.</p>
<p>Casino Floor Live is also available in 39 languages, making it a highly engaging and impactful product that definitely appeals to players. The solution is also highly customizable, making it easy for operators to integrate it successfully and tailor it to the needs of their particular audiences.</p>
<p>As a whole, the Pariplay Fusion platform is an outstanding product that features products from more than 80 suppliers along with 14,000 games. The platform features a wide variety of gaming products, including live games, fantasy sports, poker, and others. Pariplay Director of Partnerships Callum Harris welcomed the opportunity to add yet another established company and its solutions to the aggregation platform:</p>
<p>Casino Floor Live combines the essence of the land-based experience with everything players love about RNG-based games. It is a pleasure to welcome Live Solutions as a Fusion® partner and we look forward to entertaining players across the world together. Pariplay Director of Partnerships Callum Harris</p>
<p>Live Solutions Find a New Promising Home for Content</p>
<p>Live Solutions’ Jean-Pierre Houareau also welcomed the opportunity to roll out the Casino Floor Live product onto the Fusion aggregation platform. This integration offers new opportunities for the company, Houareau said.</p>
<p>He remained confident that his company’s innovative approach to developing mobile-first casino content will definitely help it continue to build its presence. Live Solutions also implements many social elements to its offering in order to make its products more appealing and intuitive.</p>
