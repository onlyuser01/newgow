    <h1>Wind Creek Casino Montgomery Wynn Las Vegas Casino In Vegas Valley View Casino Hotel Harrahs Casino</h1>

<p>I opened an account with CoinyWin on 27/05/2021, on the same day I made a mbc deposit (2.66 MBC) and took the Sports 75% bonus, I did wagering, and did withdraw the day after ( 12.00mbc)</p>
<p>5/31/2021 - receive a message that my withdraw is cancel, on live chat I received information that I need to add documents,</p>
<p>I did, sent the documents and added them on the website and did withdraw again.</p>
<p>6/8/2021 - I get an email again that my withdraw is rejected.</p>
<p>on live chat I can't find out anything because he is very unprofessional and rude, there is no reply to e-mail.</p>
<p>I added documents (id card, bill, selfie) I made withdraw again but still not processed</p>
<p>now on their site I can't place any bet and play at the casino, I don't know what's going on.</p>
