<p>theScore Bet Goes Live in Iowa to Expand Its US Presence</p>
<p>The sports betting brand of Score Digital Sports Ventures, theScore Bet, made its official launch in Iowa this week, to expand its availability to sports fans from 4 US states and offer bettors from the Hawkeye State experience first-hand the unique ecosystem the sportsbook creates when paired with theScore app.</p>
<p>Iowa Market Access Provided by Penn National</p>
<p>The launch in Iowa was part of the strategic multi-state market access agreement theScore signed with Penn National Gaming in July 2019, which allowed the sportsbook to obtain market access to offer online and mobile sports betting and iGaming in 11 states in which Penn operates casinos and racetracks.</p>
<p>“We have expanded theScore Bet to three new markets in the last six months, significantly increasing our footprint.” John Levy, Founder and CEO, theScore</p>
<p>In September 2020, theScore Bet went live in Colorado to make the state the second US jurisdiction to feature theScore app and mobile sportsbook. The brand offered its wagering product in the Centennial State via a previously announced agreement with Gilpin Casino, a subsidiary of Jacobs Entertainment.</p>
<p>Following its launch in Colorado, theScore Bet continued with its expansion and launched theScore app in Indiana to make the state the first in which it gained market access via the deal with Penn National.</p>
<p>“We’re thrilled to introduce our mobile sportsbook to Iowans as the college basketball season heats up ahead of the tournament in March. We have a large base of theScore app users in Iowa and now, with the launch of theScore Bet, fans will have easy access to our integrated and technology driven sports betting experience.” John Levy, Founder and CEO, theScore</p>
<p>The sports betting brand operated by a subsidiary of Canadian-based Score Media and Gaming Inc. made its debut on US soil in September 2019 after a market access deal with the operator of Monmouth Park Racetrack, Darby Development LLC.</p>
<p>Betting Technology Supplied by Bet.Works</p>
<p>The launch in Iowa extended the footprint of theScore app across the US, leveraging a single mobile app and multi-state wallet functionality to provide a seamless cross-state experience for sports bettors. It also extended the partnership the sportsbook has with its betting technology supplier, Bet.Works.</p>
<p>“We are delighted to yet again assist our valued partner, theScore, through its launch in another North American jurisdiction. We are confident that our platform technology and theScore’s fusion of sports media and gaming will prove a compelling and popular offering among Iowan sports bettors.” David Wang, CEO, Bet.Works</p>
<p>Built from the ground-up and powered by sports betting technology from Bet.Works, theScore app offers a wide range of pre-game and in-play wagering and multiple bet types on sporting events from all major leagues.</p>
<p>The relatively new Bet Section within the app allows users to personalize betting features such as prioritizing markets and tracking live bets, to facilitate the process of creating bet slips by allowing them to follow their actions, as well as receive cash out offers.</p>
