<p>The UK Gambling Commission has published new binding rules for its LCCP agreements to be enforced on October 31, 2019.</p>
<p>UK Gambling Commission Tightens License Standards Again</p>
<p>The UK Gambling Commission (UKGC) has introduced a number of changes to its current License Conditions and Codes of Practice (LCCP), binding agreements that determine what regulatory norms need to be met for an iGaming operator to be issued with a license.</p>
<p>New rules added to the licence conditions and codes of practice (LCCP) will raise standards for alternative dispute resolution (ADR), customer interaction, and how operators contribute to research, prevention and treatment.

<p>This is the latest move by the UKGC to introduce better player safety practices, following a call for proposals earlier in 2019, a separate assessment of the use of credit cards for the purposes of gambling, and a decision to hold casino staff members to the same standards as operators. With the latest changes, the UKGC will:</p>
<p>Raise standards for Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR)</p>
<p>Require a clear line of communication between customers and companies, particularly in the cases where an individual is at a higher risk of developing a gambling addiction</p>
<p>Improve transparency standards, allowing for better funding and addressing the needs of addictive players who would benefit from prevention and treatment</p>
<p>The Commission has been running multiple consultations in the pursuit of developing a safer gaming environment for all participating members.</p>
<p>As per the new agreement, the UKGC would demand from gaming &amp; betting operators to only work with ADR that have been approved by the Commission, thus raising standards across the board.</p>
<p>UKGC Executive Director Paul Hope had this to say;</p>
<p>“These changes have been designed to make gambling fairer and safer for consumers and we expect gambling firms to meet their responsibilities in these areas.”</p>
<p>All of these rules will be enforced on October 31, 2019, but it will not affect the entire market. Gaming machine technical and gambling software licenses will be waived from the new changes – for now.</p>
<p>Interaction Key to Preventing Gambling Harm</p>
<p>Moving forward, the Commission will expect all parties to interact better with customers, as per the latest requirements. Casino staff will have to put more effort into identifying individuals and successfully gauge whether a player is experiencing gambling harm or developing an addiction.</p>
<p>We have restated our firm commitment to reducing harm as research into suicidal behaviour is published. The reports are part of our research programme for the National Strategy to Reduce Gambling Harms and were commissioned by @BeGambleAware.

<p>The changes that will bind casinos to higher standards of customer care are also to be enacted come October 31, 2019. Plus, the UKGC expects operators to contribute more to a voluntary fund to boost research and prevention as well as sponsor the treatment of gambling-related conditions.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Commission is expected to publish a list of approved bodies to which all gambling operators in the United Kingdom can contribute money.</p>
