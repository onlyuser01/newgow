The game is presented by Red Hawk Resort and Casino and is part of a broader push to use the Pick’em game format to introduce sports fans to sports betting experiences.</p>

Through the new game integrated with the already existing app, fans get to place predictions on the outcome of player/team totals, shooting percentages, and over/unders.</p>
<p>There is also access to the team’s in-app Loyalty Program, Royalty Pass, and more. Commenting on this new fan engagement opportunity, Sacramento Kings president of business operations John Rinehart said:</p>
