<p>Australian-based sportsbook provider PointsBet entered into a multi-year partnership deal with Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise Detroit Tigers, becoming the first sports betting company to enter in a partnership with a team from the professional baseball league. The agreement enters into force at the beginning of the 2020 season of the Tigers.</p>
<p>Branding, Promotion, and Other Content</p>
<p>Earlier, PointsBet became an authorized gaming operator of the MLB which granted it access to official data as well as the right to use marks of the league with its products. The agreement with the league made it possible for the sportsbook provider to become an official partner of the Detroit Tigers and further enhance fan engagement, utilizing unique experiences, promotions and other content in and around the stadium the Tigers play, Comerica Park.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the deal, PointsBet will have its branding placed at the Tigers’ stadium in visible areas during television broadcasts and will feature on the Detroit Tigers Radio Network. Besides that, the sportsbook will sponsor its presence on the Tigers’ digital platforms and will regularly feature on the twice-a-week fan-favorite live streaming show, The Word on Woodward. Finally, PointsBet will be integrated into both the District Detroit and MLB Ballpark apps.</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to welcome PointsBet as a gaming partner of the Detroit Tigers. Our incredible fans will love the unique experiences and innovative offerings that PointsBet’s personalized platform provides. We look forward to the fan-friendly enhancements this will bring to the game-day experience in and around Comerica Park for years to come.” Chris Granger, Group President, Sports &amp; Entertainment, Ilitch Holdings, Inc.</p>
<p>Australian-based sports betting operator PointsBet entered the US market in January 2019 in New Jersey and became famous with its unique PointsBetting product, which allows player winnings to be increased the more correct the prediction is. The sportsbook utilizes its own proprietary technology to provide punters with access to most markets in the world wagering-wise.</p>
<p>“The PointsBet team is excited to announce our groundbreaking deal with the Detroit Tigers and Major League Baseball, becoming the first legal sports betting operator in U.S. history to partner with an MLB franchise… We offer the most betting options in the world on MLB games via our unique PointsBetting product, and we are excited to inject a unique and robust betting proposition into the great state of Michigan.” Johnny Aitken, CEO, PointsBet USA</p>
<p>PointsBet entered the Michigan sports betting market after the state legalized in it 2019, in a partnership deal with Lac Vieux Desert Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians, which allowed the sportsbook operator to launch mobile and desktop applications, as well as a branded product for the tribe. PointsBet and the tribe are currently negotiating over a possible retail sportsbook at the Northern Waters Casino Resort operated by the tribe.</p>
<p>In February, the sportsbook provider signed a deal with the National Basketball League (NBA) to integrate a league-first Win Probability Metric across certain NBA platforms.</p>
