<p>Leading British online gambling company bet365 has unveiled a new promotion for Ohio customers ahead of its launch in the state. Users who register in advance will be gifted $100 in free bets by the gaming company.</p>
<p>Bet365 Rolls Out the Red Carpet for Buckeyes</p>
<p>Bet365 is preparing for launch in Ohio. The company’s betting products will become available to citizens of the state starting January 1. However, bettors can register right now to benefit from the company’s special pre-launch promotion. Users who register on the operator’s platform will be able to claim $100 in free bets once its offerings go live in the state.</p>
<p>To be eligible for this exciting promotion, customers must sign up for bet365’s platform between November 2 and December 31. If they do so and deposit at least $10, they will be paid $100 in the form of Bet Credits on January 1, 2023. The credits will be credited to pre-registered customers once the platform goes live. To claim them, customers will need to go to the My Offers section of the Account Menu and claim the relevant offer.</p>
<p>The Bet Credits are non-withdrawable and any wager placed using Bet Credits is excluded from any returns. In addition, players will be unable to participate in certain promotions by using such credits. However, any winnings from bets placed with Bet Credits will be placed in players’ Withdrawable Balance.</p>
<p>Lastly, customers should keep in mind that their Bet Credits will disappear if their accounts are left inactive for more than 90 days in a row.</p>
<p>Bet365 Wants to Reward Loyalty</p>
<p>If players decide to stick with the operator, they will be awarded an additional $200 in Bet Credits. As announced by bet365, customers who deposit $10 and wager at least $1 will receive an additional $200 in Bet Credits.</p>
<p>Furthermore, bet365 promises that its new Ohio platform will engage customers with exciting features such as Same Game Parlay, Cash Out and Edit Bet.
