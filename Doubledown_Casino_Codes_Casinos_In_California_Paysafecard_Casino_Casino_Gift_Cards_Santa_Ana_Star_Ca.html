    <h1>Doubledown Casino Codes Casinos In California Paysafecard Casino Casino Gift Cards Santa Ana Star Ca</h1>

<p>The Centraal Register Uitsluiting Kansspelen (Cruks), which is the self-exclusion system of the Netherlands, will be overseen by three additional external advisors who were appointed by the country’s gambling regulator – Kansspelautoriteit (KSA).</p>
<p>Marcel Marijnissen, Bas Brons and Mieke Hoste Will Have Lot of Responsibility</p>
<p>Marcel Marijnissen is currently working as a chief medical officer at Hervitas, a Zeist addiction treatment center. He is an addiction specialist who has also spent time as an addiction doctor at Solutions-S Centre for Addiction Care and Triora Addiction Care.</p>
<p>Bas Brons is a mental health care professional and a senior counselor that specializes in the treatment of gambling addiction. His resume contains 11 years as a counselor, coach, and therapist at BBCoaching and in the past three years, Brons has been working at Solutions-S Centre for Addiction Care.</p>
<p>Finally, Mieke Hoste has years of working experience with both kids and adults. As a licensed clinical psychologist, she has worked at Katholieke Universiteit Leuven and Hart Hospital in Tienen, both of which are located in Belgium.</p>
<p>These appointments are the result of the new report by the Dutch government that was published this week in which it was stated that by ordering unlicensed operators not to accept bets from Dutch players, it has actually helped players to transfer to licensed gaming sites.</p>
<p>The report, which was presented by Sander Dekker, the minister for legal protection, also states that as of November 1, 3,500 people have registered at Cruks. Moreover, it included information on the number of gambling website visits in the country since the market opened, which is October 1.</p>
<p>Licensed operators in the country must integrate with Cruks to check whether their players are registered with the scheme.</p>
<p>As for the three new advisors, they will be able to “advise on the system.” This system allows operators to request players’ exclusions, but it also allows players to self-exclude.</p>
<p>The Dutch Government Is Very Strict About Accepting Passive Bets</p>
<p>With the latest changes in how the gambling industry is regulated, the Dutch government changed its stance on all operators who are passively accepting bets from its residents. That is why many reputable global brands were blocked, with some of the most popular being 888, Casumo, Betsson, Entain and Kindred Group. Not only that, but recently, the KSA helped shut down a Facebook bingo group that allegedly accepted bets from minors.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Betixon managed to receive a license from the KSA and as it stated, the company has already linked up with strategic partners and will begin offering its services very soon. The CEO of Betixon, Lior Coher, stated that the Netherlands is one of Europe’s most important and valuable markets and that Betixon believes that it will grow its presence there at a very fast rate.</p>
