<p>The fast-growing provider of games, powering online gambling operators across the globe, CT Interactive, announced a new deal, propelling further its European presence. The company confirmed it signed a new exclusive content agreement with Casino777. Under the terms of the freshly minted partnership, CT Interactive's games are now live and available exclusively for customers of the operator in Spain.</p>
<p>Thanks to the new collaboration, Casino777's clients will be able to access 40 Mega Slot, Chilli Fruits, as well as Dark Woods, among other hit games from CT Interactive. Moreover, the customers of the operator can benefit from thrilling fan-favorite titles like Lucky Clover, Fluf Tails, Monkey Sevens, HOT 7's X 2, Fire Dozen, Treasure Hill, Three Nymphs, Full of Luck, 40 Treasures and Big Joker, along with other engaging and unique games.</p>
<p>Daniel Rafael Mustatea, Casino777's Business Operations Specialist, was excited about the new deal. In a statement, he explained that the company is honored to join forces with CT Interactive, an operator that is renowned for the quality of its games across the globe. Finally, Mustatea said: "We are sure that this would be a mutually beneficial partnership."</p>
<p>Milena Tsankarska, CT Interactive's Head of Business Development, added: "This partnership is an important step for our brand, because through it, CT Interactive will establish its presence in the Spanish market." Finally, she explained: "For Casino777, offering exclusive games from CT Interactive will help the operator attract new players and retain existing ones."</p>
<p>Lachezar Petrov, CT Interactive's CEO, shared Tsankarska's excitement about the newest collaboration announced by the company for this important European gambling market. He revealed that CT Interactive is thrilled to see its content go live for customers in Spain. Last but not least, Petrov pointed out: "For us, it is a pleasure to work with Casino777 and to expand our reach and strengthen our stronghold in the regulated European markets."</p>
<p>The deal in Spain comes on the heels of another collaboration announced by CT Interactive. Earlier this month, the company strengthened its European footprint once again by agreeing to supply its games for Casino777.ch for the regulated gambling market in Switzerland. As a result, customers of the operator gained access to hit games and unique titles from the iGaming content provider.</p>
<p>While the latest deal with Casino777 in Spain will help the operator engage with new audiences, it also propels CT Interactive's presence in the iGaming sector. Thanks to that partnership, more customers are going to have a chance to experience the engaging mechanics and unique themes offered by the iGaming provider's titles.</p>
