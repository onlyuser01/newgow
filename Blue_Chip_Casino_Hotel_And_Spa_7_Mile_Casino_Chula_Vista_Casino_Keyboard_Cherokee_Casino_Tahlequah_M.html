    <h1>Blue Chip Casino Hotel And Spa 7 Mile Casino Chula Vista Casino Keyboard Cherokee Casino Tahlequah M</h1>

<p>You know it's not wise to compare withdrawals and deposits because both transactions are very different, especially regarding checks.</p>
<p>When you deposit at an online casino, there are no actual checks made on the casino's side. It is just a simple money transaction. Equal to when buying gasoline at the gas station and paying by card.</p>
<p>On the other side, when you submit a withdrawal request, the whole process of checking needs to be done because the casino must be perfectly sure you have never violated any casino terms, used only payment methods registered to you, and followed other policies.</p>
<p>So, unless you ask the caisno to perform the KYC (know your customer) right after the registration, there is a pretty high chance that a second account will go unnoticed.</p>
<p>I understand it feels like a gap to catch players, but I guess it is pretty common knowledge that creating a second account is prohibited in every casino performing KYC verification.</p>
<p>Did you read the article I sent you, please? It says:</p>
<p>"We accept that it is the responsibility of players to make sure that they don't create multiple accounts at the same casino. Not because we think it's the right way to do it, but because it's the industry standard, and we cannot penalize all casinos that don't enforce the 'one account per player' rule the way we consider best. However, we believe and hope that checking for duplicate accounts during account creation will become the industry standard in the future and players will be better protected."</p>
