<p>Yardbarker Media has teamed up with Oddschecker to work on a new sports betting project. The upcoming media portal will draw on the best of both worlds, providing fans with insight into sports while also offering them an opportunity to take this knowledge and leverage it through their own betting game.</p>
<p>This solution will be accessible through Yardbarker.com and will help both casual fans and hardcore sports bettors to find more information on the best possible wagering markets in real-time.</p>
<p>Oddschecker has a reputation for providing some of the most accurate betting odds and fixtures globally and it is powered by a strong underpinning technology and platform that makes the process straightforward for players.</p>
<p>Consumers have access to a head-to-head comparison of the odds of different events across numerous regulated sportsbooks. Playmaker, which is the parent company for Yardbarker, is confident that the alliance between the two companies will enable them to drive conversions and transform sports fans into active bettors.</p>
<p>Playmaker CEO Jordan Gnat spoke about Oddschecker’s extensive track record and he said that he was confident and trusting of the team behind the solution. Oddschecker is also happy to jump on this opportunity as it enables it to expand beyond its core markets and enter the North American market with renewed strength.</p>
<p>Commenting on this partnership, Oddschecker US SVP Matt Mirman said that he was happy to be teaming up with Yardbarker, speaking on behalf of the entire company. There is clear demand from sports fans for high-quality and engaging betting content and that is precisely what this partnership will help achieve.</p>
<p>Partnerships between media and sports betting brands are becoming increasingly popular as the two segments are continuously overlapping and coming closer together. FuboTV is a great example of how media and sports betting experiences can tie together.</p>
<p>The company has long wanted to turn its audiences into active and engaged viewers by offering them to participate in fantasy games and sports betting options. Playmaker’s Gnat is happy to see the new partnership take shape as he believes it is what the company needs to strengthen its balance sheet through the launch of dedicated media businesses.</p>
