    <h1>Poseidon Casino Vegas Northern Quest Resort And Casino Spokane Casino Monticello Casino Brango No De</h1>

<p>Dear Harsheet99,</p>
<p>We have been provided with the information that they cannot share any players-related information, nor players' activity details or internal processes details with 3rd party, so we cannot continue resolving this complaint and we are forced to close it as ‘unresolved’, which will influence the casino’s rating in a negative way. Unfortunately, we are not able to force the casino to cooperate in resolving the complaints, and they likely do not want or cannot provide us with the necessary data due to its strict internal policy and GDPR. There is not much that can be achieved without cooperation from the casino's side.</p>
<p>However, the decrease in the rating caused by unresolved complaints could help to change the casino's approach. If the casino decides to react, we will reopen the complaint and you will be notified by email.</p>
<p>If you feel you want to take this complaint further you can contact the Curacao Gaming Authority (info@gaming-curacao.com) and submit a complaint to them. It is rather a passive licensing authority but it may have more options and tools to help players.</p>
<p>In case of any questions or receive the results of the regulator's investigation, do not hesitate to contact me at tomas.k@casino.guru</p>
<p>I can only recommend you choose casinos by their reviews and ratings in the future to avoid situations like this.</p>
<p>I am sorry I could not be of more help on this occasion.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Tomas</p>
