<p>The retired basketball superstar Shaquille O’Neil will continue his collaboration with the iGaming and casino brand WynnBet and will support the operator’s new marketing campaign in Louisiana.</p>
<p>Shaquille O’Neil to Boost WynnBet’s Marketing Efforts</p>
<p>Shaq will promote WynnBet’s brand through various advertisements that will raise awareness of WynnBet’s arrival in Louisiana. The Bayou State holds a special place in the heart of the former National Basketball League star as it is where he started his career – the famous athlete was once but a humble college player for the Louisiana State University Tigers.</p>
<p>Shaq became WynnBet’s brand ambassador back in August 2021. Back then the basketball ex-star also joined the company as a strategic advisor and vowed to help the company with advertisement and participate in various activations.</p>
<p>Later that same month, the company featured Shaq alongside Ben Affleck in a TV commercial that aimed to propagate the operator’s offerings ahead of the NFL season.</p>
<p>WynnBet Prepares to Launch in Louisiana</p>
<p>This announcement comes ahead of the launch of the state’s own online betting market. With Wynn Resorts being one of the first companies to secure an online betting license, it is already setting things up for when the market goes live. Admittedly, WynnBet is yet to secure a license for accepting and processing wagers but all will come in due time.</p>
<p>Louisiana punters can already pre-register for WynnBet and make deposits in advance. Those who do so and place a $10 wager will benefit from the operator’s enticing offer that will see each bettor who has pre-registered receive $250 in free bets upon the official launch of online betting.</p>
<p>The Company Seeks to Conquer More Markets</p>
<p>Ian Williams, the president of Wynn Interactive, spoke on the upcoming launch of WynnBet in the Bayou State. He said that foraying into the state is but the start of the operator’s exciting operations. He teased that the company is planning on vastly boosting its influence before the end of Q1 of 2022.</p>
<p>Williams reminded that WynnBet is currently playing regulatory approval for launching its sports betting offerings in Iowa and New York. With its offerings available in three more states, the gambling operator will increase its total reach to 10 states.</p>
<p>Williams concluded that he is excited to welcome bettors from the new markets: “We look forward to welcoming new customers from across the country to WynnBet in the coming weeks.”</p>
<p>WynnBet currently operates in seven states, namely Michigan, Tennessee, Virginia, Indiana, Colorado, Arizona and New Jersey.</p>
