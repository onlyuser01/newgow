<p>The Culinary Workers and Bartenders unions, representing 53,000 workers, have demanded higher wages, increased protections against job-threatening technology, reduced housekeeping quotas, and improved worker safety</p>
<p>As contract negotiations between Las Vegas hospitality unions and major casino-resort operators continue to stagnate, concerns are mounting over potential strikes that could disrupt the city’s bustling hospitality industry.</p>
<p>Tensions Rise in Sin City as Vegas Unions Hit a Standstill in Talks</p>
<p>Despite ongoing talks, there has been little progress in addressing these demands. Union representatives expressed disappointment after meetings this week with industry giants MGM Resorts International and Caesars Entertainment yielded “no real movement.”</p>
<p>Secretary-Treasurer of Culinary Union Local 226, Ted Pappageorge, voiced the unions’ frustrations, emphasizing the urgency for fair agreements, especially considering the upcoming high-profile events such as the Formula 1 races.</p>
<p>As negotiations continue, the unions are also engaged in talks with Wynn Resorts Ltd. The potential for strikes looms large, with 53,000 members of the Culinary Workers Union having authorized a citywide strike that could affect at least 18 properties. These workers, including housekeepers, servers, cooks, and bartenders, recently voted to authorize a walkout, highlighting their dissatisfaction with current compensation and working conditions.</p>
<p>While specific wage demands remain undisclosed, the workers’ demands for fair treatment, job security, and improved conditions remain at the forefront, casting a shadow over Las Vegas’ hospitality landscape.</p>
<p>The Culinary Union is a powerful force in the state of Nevada. This move towards a strike reflects a broader national trend, where unions across various sectors demand higher wages, better work conditions, and job security, especially in the post-pandemic landscape.</p>
<p>As negotiations continue, Las Vegas braces for potential disruptions in iconic establishments like Bellagio, Mandalay Bay, Wynn Las Vegas, MGM Grand, and Caesars Palace, underscoring the pressing need for resolution in the ongoing labor dispute.</p>
<p>Las Vegas Hit by Financial Fallout from MGM Resorts Cyberattack</p>
<p>Adding to the city’s woes, MGM Resorts International recently faced a cybersecurity threat, leading to the shutdown of certain computer systems. The incident raised concerns about data security and operational disruptions within the affected casinos and hotels, underscoring the vulnerabilities within the hospitality sector.</p>
<p>MGM Resorts International has disclosed the far-reaching consequences of its recent cyberattack, which caused widespread disruptions and chaos among clients. The incident is expected to negatively impact the company’s financial results for the third quarter of 2023, particularly affecting its Las Vegas operations, with an estimated reduction of approximately $100 million in Adjusted EBITDAR for September 2023. While the company has mostly restored operations and resolved immediate issues, the incident incurred nearly $10 million in one-time expenses.</p>
<p>Despite the setback, MGM Resorts remains optimistic about a strong fourth quarter, driven by events like Formula 1. Moody’s Investors Service has classified the incident as “credit negative,” emphasizing the critical need for robust cybersecurity measures in the gaming and hospitality industry.</p>
