    <h1>Inclave Casino No Deposit Bonus Codes Grand Casino Hinckley Mn Mgm Grand Hotel Casino Hard Rock Casi</h1>

<p>Dear Casino Representative,</p>
<p>IF THE DEPOSIT HAD NOT BEEN VALID, YOU WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CREDIT ANY AMOUNT TO MY GAMING ACCOUNT AND ALLOW ME TO PLAY AND THEN INCORRECTLY CANCEL THE AMOUNT WON! IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE CONCEPT OF FAIR PLAY OR FAIRNESS IS NOW WELL KNOWN AND CLEAR ALMOST EVERYONE. FOR THIS REASON NO CASINO INCLUDING YOURS WOULD DREAM OF ADVANCE ANY DEPOSIT THAT HAS NOT BEEN VERIFIED IN ADVANCE! THIS IS THE GENERAL RULE OF ALL ONLINE CASINOS.</p>
<p>On the contrary, you want us to believe that you are the only casino in the world that advances money into its players' gaming account by taking the relative risk of non-payment, when on average cryptocurrency transactions take place in 10 minutes at most, except for rare congestions of the blockchain, therefore also here without a real and effective reason such as the one claimed to allow players to wait for unnecessary credit? What are you a charity like UNICEF? That statement says a lot about how you operate!! I didn't dwell on all the useless technical explanations and related screenshots, so many speeches to say nothing in the end! The substance is what matters. What you claim that you credit the sums deposited without any verification and confirmation, all this is absolutely false as I repeat, NO CASINO ADVANCES MONEY TO PLAYERS. I have been playing for over 20 years in many casinos like yours and the money is clearly transferred to the gaming account only after verifying that the money has arrived correctly in the dedicated wallet and then transferring it to the customer's gaming account! All the technical talk about how cryptocurrencies are handled goes beyond the fact that you are trying to get around the non-payment issue on a regular win! Here we are certainly not at a seminar and this justification is absurd since the undersigned has played and won with the money that the casino has regularly credited to the actual gaming account! What happens technically nobody cares but the substance counts or what actually happened: I deposited through Minting in BTC and the money arrived regularly in the dedicated gaming account (see the attached screenshot of the house where the payment was recorded with the relative bonuses). With this amount I was able to play and win regularly. Otherwise or in the case of non-payment by deposit I would not have been able to play and win nothing. Since this happened it is clear that the casino first verified this transaction and secondly confirmed the same by crediting the deposited amount plus the related bonus. I repeat, no casino dreams of advancing money to its customers, therefore yours is simply an excuse not to pay the winnings.</p>
<p>AFTER EIGHT DAYS OF WAITING AT THE TIME OF THE WITHDRAWAL, YOU HAVE COME UP WITH THE EXCUSE OF THE NON-PAYMENT AND SUBSEQUENTLY OF A SECOND DEPOSIT MADE WHEN IT IS SIMPLY AN ACCELERATION OF THE ORIGINAL DEPOSIT* MADE BY THE UNDERSIGNED THROUGH THE SPECIAL OPTION PRESENT IN MINT, ALL OF THIS FOR CONFISCATE A REGULAR WIN? AT MY HOUSE THIS IS CALLED SCAM.</p>
<p>*EXAMPLE OF A DEPOSIT MADE THROUGH MINT ON ANOTHER CASINO WITH THE SUBSEQUENT POSSIBILITY OF ACCELERATE THE SAME AS WHICH HAPPENED IN THE SPECIFIC CASE</p>
