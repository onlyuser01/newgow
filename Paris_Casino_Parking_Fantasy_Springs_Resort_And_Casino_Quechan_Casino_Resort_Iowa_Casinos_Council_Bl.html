    <h1>Paris Casino Parking Fantasy Springs Resort And Casino Quechan Casino Resort Iowa Casinos Council Bl</h1>

<p>The real fact is that I'm frustrated and feeling robbed. Because the platform avoids it in every way without contacting you by email and always justifying it with the same sentence. The feeling now is to want to alert as many users as possible that big winnings are not paid by Startbet. The site limits you to daily withdrawals which means your winnings stay there, so you bet and win more or lose normally.</p>
<p>But if you win, you are accused of fraud and they simply confiscate all your money as they don't pay more than 500 a day. It would take me years to get all my money and now they just took it all without justification or proof. I have several proofs that everything was ok. but the company doesn't care. and he won't even answer us here at casino guru.</p>
