<p>Money Train Origins: Dream Drop review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Money Train Origins: Dream Drop transports players into an iconic Western world.</p>
<p>After a number of creative iterations, this journey into the Money Train universe gets back to the basics with a ramshackled train and a cast of cowboys and bandits. As this train rumbles through the frontier, players will need to hang onto their hats.</p>
<p>Fans of the Money Train franchise may especially appreciate this slot.</p>
<p>Win in the base game</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The soundtrack of Money Train Origins: Dream Drop has a steady beat that brings to mind a galloping horse. Meanwhile, a whistled melody adds a mournful tone to the slot.</p>
<p>As with other Money Train slots, the reels of Money Train Origins: Dream Drop are built into a train car. This particular car is a patchwork of metal, wood, guns, and bullets.</p>
<p>On the reels, players will meet a savvy cowgirl, a ruthless bandit, and a wise sheriff. Each character is animated in a semi-realistic cartoon style with plenty of personality.</p>
<p>Each card suit can also be found on the reels, carved from wood, and decorated with western embellishments. Behind the reels, players will glimpse a blue sky and hints of a dusty desert. This helps reinforce the frontier setting.</p>
<p>Overall, the soundtrack and animation of Money Train Origins: Dream Drop create a comfortingly familiar Western atmosphere.</p>
<p>Big win in the Bonus round</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Money Train Origins: Dream Drop is a five-reel, four-row slot. However, players may unlock two additional reels during the Bonus.</p>
<p>In total, there are 40 win lines. Only the highest win is paid on a given spin.</p>
<p>The highest possible win for this slot is 10,000x the player’s total bet.</p>

<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all paying symbols.</p>
<p>If players land at least 3 Bonus symbols, the Money Cart Bonus begins. The feature begins with 3 free spins, and whenever a new symbol lands on the reels, the count is reset to 3.</p>
<p>During the Money Cart Bonus, several special symbols are active including:</p>

<p>Two of the Special symbols in the Bonus round</p>
<p>The Dream Drop Bonus is triggered when players land 20 Dream Drop symbols before any normal spin. During this feature, players can win a range of Jackpot prizes, including: Rapid, Midi, Maxi, Major, and Mega.</p>
<p>The Dream Drop Bonus begins when players are presented with 20 options from which they must choose. As players click their choices, the goal is to reveal 3 matching Jackpots. After players find three options that match, that Jackpot will be awarded to them.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of Money Train Origins: Dream Drop is 94.00%, well below our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.20 up to a maximum of $/£/€100 per spin.</p>
<p>Money Train Origins: Dream Drop offers high volatility which would have made this slot a good fit for our preferred slot machine strategies if the RTP was more favorable.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We do not recommend this low RTP, high volatility Western-themed slot.</p>
<p>Although Money Train Origins: Dream Drop offers ample volatility and a classic theme, the RTP is too low for a recommendation.</p>
<p>Some players might like to check out this slot to soak in the Money Train atmosphere or explore the bonus features, but they would be wise to move on to slots that can deliver a more favorable RTP.</p>
