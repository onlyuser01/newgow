<p>Amelco Partners up with NetEnt</p>
<p>Amelco, a leading sports betting provider, has partnered up with NetEnt, a premium casino content supplier, to expand its offering for the US market. Amelco continues its expansion towards uncharted territory with its land-based and online sportsbook solutions. Currently, its platform is live in six US states, including Pennsylvania, Michigan, Colorado. It will integrate further in new markets, which will be announced in the future.</p>
<p>Head of Amelco USA, Brandon Walker, commented on the deal stated: “We’re delighted to go live with one of the slot industry’s true leaders – with a hard-earned reputation as one of the world’s leading casino brands.”</p>
<p>Amelco recently entered the US iGaming market by partnering up with Pariplay Aspire Global. With this integration deal, Amelco integrated Pariplay’s premium Fusion platform into its products and services.</p>
<p>In April, Amelco and Golden Matrix announced their launch of a custom-build online sportsbook in India, right before the IPL cricket season.</p>
<p>Amelco Continues to Boost Its Premium Offerings</p>
<p>Founded in 2006 by experts in the financial sector, with its years of experience, the company has become known to provide the best sports betting and trading platforms to leaders in the industry worldwide. Amelco is the supplier of leaders in the industry like Entain, Flutter, William Hill, Sportradar, FOX BET, and The Stars Group.</p>
<p>Under the agreement with NetEnt, Amelco will receive the supplier’s entire collection of slot games, including its hits like Narcos, Gordon Ramsay Hell’s Kitchen, and the all-time favorites Divine Fortune, Starburst. NetEnt launched Gordon Ramsay’s Hell’s Kitchen Slot in March, and it became an instant hit.</p>
<p>The titles will go live with many of Amelco’s leading operator partners in the country, leading to growth for the supplier as it continues to launch its platform in more states.</p>
<p>Evolution North America commercial director Jeff Millar said that Amelco has a strong presence in the US.</p>
<p>Walker stated that this is the first of many announcements which will come in the upcoming months. The company intends to offer its US customers the best slots, table games, and live casino games on the market, along with sportsbook options.</p>
<p>Millar said: “With so much scope for growth across the country, it is an exciting time to be working together, and we’re eager to see what we can achieve.”</p>
