    <h1>Springbok Casino How To Play Casino Hard Rock Casino Biloxi Hotel Casino Hotels Council Bluffs Lotus</h1>

<p>End-to-end software factory developer Stakelogic has partnered with Hurricane Games to release Wild Moon Saloon, a high-volatility slot with a Wild West theme. The game is the result of the partnership between Stakelogic and Hurricane Games with the help of the developer’s Greenlogic Partner Program. This means the fresh slot is packed with Stakelogic’s proven proprietary game features appreciated by millions of players worldwide.</p>

<p>Step Right into the Wild Moon Saloon</p>
<p>Players start the game by spending some time outside the wildest saloon in the Wild West, on a golden-hued street in a tiny town in the Wild West. During the Free Spins round, the action switches to the inside of the saloon. The game was given a cartoonish design and a matching Western soundtrack. The most courageous players will get the chance to saddle up and start claiming the massive bounties.</p>
<p>The game is played on a 5×4 grid counting 40 paylines. The premium symbols in the game are four grim-looking characters that pay between 6x and 12.5x the original bet for matching a minimum of five identical symbols. The payouts drop to 3.5x-4x for five matching bottle symbols, and 2x-3x for a minimum of five matching card royal symbols. The wilds substitute any and all pay symbols and they are valued at 15x the original bet for five wilds on a payline. The explosive action during the base game is maintained by a Mystery Bonus that is also up for grabs randomly.</p>
<p>The game is also packed with Scatters. Landing at least three of them triggers the Spins bonus round. Wild symbols landing during the Free Spins round engage random Wilds, Exploding Wilds, Rising EIlds, or Wild Reels.</p>
<p>Prior to the Free Spins bonus round, players are invited to participate in a pick game. The number of picks depends on the number of Scatter symbols that were used to trigger the Free Spins bonus. The respective picks can make Wilds, Multipliers and extra Free Spins pop up.</p>
<p>Wild Moon Saloon Is Tied to the Super Stake Feature</p>
<p>This feature has been designed by Stakelogic and it enables players to double their bets and boost the odds of one of the bonus features being activated during gameplay. In other words, players can see the number of landing Scatter symbols during the Free Spins bonus round and the base game growing exponentially with this feature. For x80 the bet, players can jump right into the Free Spins bonus round using the bonus buy feature.</p>
<p>Stakelogic’s chief commercial officer Olga Bajela called the game “one of our most explosive slot launches to date” that has taken the beloved Wild West theme and wrapped it in more bonus action than ever. She also referred to the new slot as one not “for the faint-hearted but for those keen to ride towards the Free Spins bonus” and redeem one of the most generous bounties in the industry.</p>
<p>At the end of June, Stakelogic launched Runner Runner PopWins, a slot with a 10,000x max win. A few days earlier, the company obtained an iGaming license to operate in Michigan.</p>
