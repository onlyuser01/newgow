<p>The Tampa Bay Buccaneers are traveling to Michigan this coming weekend to take on the Detroit Lions at Ford Field on January 21 in an NFC Divisional Round game</p>
<p>The Tampa Bay Buccaneers defeated last season’s NFC champions, the Philadelphia Eagles, in the Wild Card Round. Now, they’re hoping they can do the same against the Detroit Lions. This time, however, they’re playing on the road against a team that suffered only two losses during the regular season.</p>
<p>Spread Odds Tampa Bay Buccaneers +6.0 -110 Detroit Lions -6.0 -110</p>
<p>Moneyline Odds Tampa Bay Buccaneers +220 Detroit Lions -260</p>
<p>Points Total Odds Over 48.5 -115 Under 48.5 -105</p>
<p>When, Where, and How to Watch?</p>
<p>Place : Ford Field in Detroit, Michigan</p>
<p>: Ford Field in Detroit, Michigan Date : Sunday, January 21, 2024</p>
<p>: Sunday, January 21, 2024 Time : 3:00 p.m. ET</p>
<p>: 3:00 p.m. ET How to Watch: NBC</p>
<p>Can the Bucs Pull Off Another Surprise?</p>
<p>The Tampa Bay Buccaneers demolished the Philadelphia Eagles who were three-point favorites ahead of the Wild Card Round duel. The final score was 32-9 for the Bucs, which was their biggest win in the 2023-24 campaign.</p>
<p>In fact, the last time they defeated someone by 23 points or more was back in January 2022 when they beat the Carolina Panthers 41-17.</p>
<p>So, how did they manage to beat the mighty Eagles? Tampa’s quarterback Baker Mayfield had a fantastic game, going 22-for-36 for 337 yards and three touchdowns, without suffering a single interception. The Bucs also did great defensively, keeping the Eagles offense to just one touchdown.</p>
<p>Detroit Lions Dreaming of the NFC Title Game</p>
<p>This is the first time the Detroit Lions reached the Divisional Round after 22 years. If they win on Sunday, they will get a shot at the conference title, which they last won back in the 1950s. Knowing all this, it’s clear that these guys will be super motivated against the Bucs.</p>
<p>They’ve got the motivation, but do they have the player power to pull it off? Well, their roster might be inexperienced, but that hasn’t bothered them this season. They finished the regular season with a 12-5 record, then went on to beat the in-form Los Angeles Rams in the Wild Card Round.</p>
<p>It was a close game, which they won by a single point. Their next game is almost certainly going to be difficult as well, but will they manage to grab another win?</p>
<p>Tampa Bay Buccaneers vs. Detroit Lions Prediction</p>
<p>Our prediction is that the Detroit Lions will win this game. They’ve looked much better than the Bucs throughout the 2023-24 campaign. Plus, they have huge motivation to win on Sunday and write the franchise’s history. They’re also going to have their fans at Ford Field to cheer them on.</p>
<p>Speaking of Ford Field, the weather forecast says the temperature around this venue is going to be 18°F at the kickoff. That’s the temperature the Lions are used to, but the Bucs prefer playing in sunny Florida. The temperature in Tampa is going to be around 60°F this weekend.</p>
<p>Pick: Detroit Lions -6.0</p>
