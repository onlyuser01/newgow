    <h1>South Point Hotel Casino Las Vegas Choctaw Casino Broken Bow North Carolina Casinos Century Casino H</h1>

<p>Dear RaeMRae84,</p>
<p>Thank you for contacting us. I have checked the casino’s website for options to close an account and unsubscribe from all correspondence with the casino and its services, and this is what I found https://www.allstarslots.com/responsible-gambling:</p>
<p>"Self-Exclusion and Deposit Limits</p>
<p>We have two major tools that players can use to help regulate their play. The first tool we have is that we will work with you on deposit limits for daily, weekly or monthly play. These limits can help to keep you playing within your budget and at stakes that you can afford. It’s best to decide on these limits ahead of time and to use them as a part of an overall strategy to manage your budget as a whole.</p>
<p>Second, we offer total self-exclusion from All Star Slots. If you decide that you would like to have your account permanently closed and to never receive emails or other communication from us, we will adhere to your request. We never want to send communications to people who aren’t interested in what we offer, but this is even more the case for players who feel a compulsion to gamble."</p>
<p>I would recommend sending an email including all the relevant information via form that can be found here: https://www.allstarslots.com/about-us/contact-us. Specify in the request for how long you wish your account to be closed and clearly state the reason why.</p>
<p>Please, let me know if you need any assistance and keep me updated. Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
