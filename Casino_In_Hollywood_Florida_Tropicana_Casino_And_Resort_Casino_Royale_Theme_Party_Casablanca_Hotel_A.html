    <h1>Casino In Hollywood Florida Tropicana Casino And Resort Casino Royale Theme Party Casablanca Hotel A</h1>

<p>Dear Mr. Orr,</p>
<p>Our team have reviewed your complaint and we wish to thank you for your patience and understanding whilst this review was being undertaken.</p>
<p>We confirm that you were offered £50 bonus credits on 30 March 2020, during this chat ,the Customer Support Representative confirmed "Please note that: We reserve the right to limit any winnings from an instant bonus or cash to 10 times the value of that instant bonus. For example, if you receive a £100 (or currency equivalent) instant bonus, a maximum of £1,000 (or currency equivalent) is eligible for withdrawal if we choose to enact this clause". Our records further reflect that you asked the Customer Support Representative whether the maximum sum you could withdraw was £500, this was confirmed as such.</p>
<p>Later that same day, you then contacted our Customer Support Team and queried what the maximum sum is that you can withdraw; to which the host responded "There is no withdrawal limit set, once you complete wagering the remaining funds in your bonus account will be moved over to your gaming account and you may then request a withdrawal ,should you wish to do so." The response relayed was based on withdrawal limits, rather than the maximum claimable winnings from the bonus you had received.</p>
<p>As a measure of clarity, we draw your attention to clause 7(ii) of our Promotional Terms which confirm https://www.slotnite.com/promoterms"(ii) Unless otherwise stated, winnings from bonus spins are credited in casino bonus and are capped to a maximum of £50. Winnings that exceed this amount will be removed from the account. Any play using bonus spins winnings will not unlock bonus funds and all winnings will return directly to your bonus account."</p>
<p>Further to this we also reference our Withdrawal Policy, as outlined in clause 7.3 of our Terms and Conditions https://www.slotnite.com/terms which states: "• No withdrawal will be processed and funds cannot be withdrawn from your account until: (i) Verification Checks have been satisfactorily completed; (ii) payments have been confirmed; and (iii) you have complied with any other withdrawal conditions, specific rules and promotional terms relating to your use of the Website and/or affecting your account (for example, any applicable bonus terms). Please note that Verification Checks include checks on your identity, age and place of residence."</p>
<p>In conclusion, we confirm that your winnings were rightfully capped to a maximum of £500, as was confirmed to and accepted by yourself at the point of acquiring the bonus and in accordance with our terms outlined above and also confirm that you have since successfully withdrawn the funds.</p>
<p>Should you have any further queries in this regard, please feel free to reach out to our Complaints Team on complaints@slotnite.com</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>Slotnite Team</p>
