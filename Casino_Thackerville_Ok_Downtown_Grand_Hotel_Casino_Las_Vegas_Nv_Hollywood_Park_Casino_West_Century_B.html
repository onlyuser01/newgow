<p>XB Net, a leading North American racing content supplier, has added harness racing from the Yonkers Raceway to its offerings. This move will enhance XB Net’s portfolio and help the company deliver more value to its partnering operators.</p>
<p>XB Net Adds Yonkers Raceway Harness Racing Content</p>
<p>Yonkers Raceway is a big venue that hosts three major harness events a year. These include the Yonker Trot, the Art Rooney Pace and the Messenger Stakes. Furthermore, the raceway is scheduled to host the $1 million International Trot event this weekend – a global event that will be attended by challengers from all over the world. The Yonkers International Trot will see participants run over a distance of 1 ¼ mile. It is scheduled to begin this Saturday, at 3 pm.</p>
<p>The time for the event isn’t randomly picked either and coincides with the peak leisure times in Europe, ensuring the maximum fan engagement possible. The event, which will welcome many European participants, complements European racing and will provide racing enthusiasts in the USA and Europe with great betting content.</p>
<p>International partners of XB Net are sure to benefit from the increased revenue streams that the Yorkers Raceway events will attract. It should be noted that trotting is an increasingly popular sport in Europe and the Nordics in particular, which makes XB Net’s content very appealing to European operators.</p>
<p>Delivering the Right Content at the Right Time Is Crucial</p>
<p>The Yonkers Raceway agreement is emblematic of the partnership between XB Net and NYRA Content Management Solutions, a NY Racing Associations subsidiary. The deal between the two parties includes content rights, data and odds.</p>
<p>XB Net’s SVP international, Simon Fraser, said that his team is delighted by the opportunity to offer more premium racing action to its international partners. He noted that his company has a robust track record of delivering engaging racing products and the new Yonkers Raceway agreement proves that.</p>
<p>For many global operators, this can represent a significant step towards being able to develop and educate around the popular sport of Harness Racing. It has a loyal and active following, and provides an exciting area into which some can broaden and diversify their content timetables. Simon Fraser, SVP international, XB Net</p>
<p>Fraser added that securing the right content at the right times is the key to successful racing offerings. He emphasized that his company offers a great range of low-latency racing solutions, racetracks and varied codes of racing that can provide operators with the flexibility they need.</p>
<p>XB Net’s end-to-end solution currently covers three-quarters of racing in the United States. The company has become synonymous with NA racing and betting content, which is why it enjoys a constant stream of new partners. XB Net has existing agreements with leading companies in the sector, including bet365, Entain, Flutter Entertainment, Playtech and William Hill, among others.</p>
