    <h1>Live Casino Maryland Asia Lotus Casino Harrah S Casino In Cherokee North Carolina Harrah S Casino No</h1>

<p>Hi, have you had a chance to see this information ? As far as maximum bets are concerned, we have this view: "The max bet rule is, in fact, an industry standard, just as the fact that a casino has the right to seize the player's winnings from bonus play after breaking this rule. We prefer not to go against industry standards by penalizing casinos that use the maximum bet rule against players from time to time.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we think that this rule should be enforced at software level, i.e., that the casino's software or website shouldn't let players place higher bets than the limit. This is one of our requirements for 'fair and safe casinos'.</p>
<p>If software enforcement is not possible, each case should be judged separately, so that only players who have broken the rule knowingly and systematically to gain an advantage are punished.</p>
<p>Additionally, the max bet sizes should be clearly displayed, ideally in the casino lobby or directly in the games (if possible) or on a prominent part of the page or advertisement informing them about the bonus, and not just "hidden" in the rules for bonus play."</p>
<p>So if you feel that you couldn't get to such information, I would recommend filing a complaint on this link and we'll see if our team will be able to do something about it.</p>
<p>Are you up for it ?</p>
