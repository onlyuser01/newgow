<p>Entain has strengthened its racing content for retail customers in the United Kingdom through a new collaboration with Sports Information Services</p>
<p>The new collaboration focuses on the Ladbrokes and Coral brands based in the country and will result in the delivery of more high-quality content from the world’s biggest and most prominent horse racing events.</p>
<p>Long-Term Collaboration to Benefit of Business and Fans</p>
<p>The partnership will run through December 2030, signifying both companies’ trust in each other’s products and the opportunities the collaboration is set to bring. During this time, the Coral and Ladbrokes retail stores in the United Kingdom and Ireland will be able to bring more worthwhile content to racing fans.</p>
<p>As part of the agreement, SIS and Entain have agreed to distribute live racing content across IPTV and satellite. This part of the agreement runs through December 2028. Entain’s retail operations will benefit from SIS’s portfolio of more than 30,000 horse races annually which are covered by 170 racecourses around the world.</p>
<p>Commenting on the new partnership opportunity, Entain managing director of retail in the UK and Ireland, Andy Hicks, said that he was very pleased to see the company team up with a proven expert in the sector that will bring even more best-in-class experiences to fans. Hicks explained:</p>
<p>We’re offering a best-in-class experience through a combination of advanced broadcast production technology and content that fully satisfies our customers’ demand for exciting, high-quality, and regular betting opportunities. Entain managing director of retail in the UK and Ireland, Andy Hicks</p>
<p>SIS CEO Richard Ames welcomed the news and said that SIS and Entain have been long-term partners. This expansion is just the latest step in their mutual path forward. Ames hailed Entain as an early adopter of SIS’ overall technological offer.</p>
<p>SIS has signed a range of prominent partnerships in recent weeks. The company helped MST enter the Romanian market and establish its local footprint. SIS also signed an important partnership with BetConstruct, allowing the latter company to distribute racing content across its network of partners.</p>
