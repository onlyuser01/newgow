<p>Arsenal vs Manchester City is a game that could decide the Premier League winner. The game is taking place on Wednesday, February 15, 2023, at Arsenal’s Emirates Stadium in London</p>
<p>Arsenal and Manchester City are the teams from the two top spots in the 2022-23 Premier League standings. The Gunners are table leaders with three points more than the Cityzens, while also having one game in hand.</p>
<p>If they win on Wednesday, they could create a point gap too large for the reigning champs to gap. On the other hand, if the visitors from Manchester win all three points, the Premier League title race is going to get much, much more interesting.</p>

<p>Should Arsenal’s Recent Dip in Form Worry Mikel Arteta?</p>
<p>The former assistant of Pep Guardiola has done a marvelous job at Arsenal. As the Gunners coach, Mikel Arteta has turned this relatively inexperienced bunch into world-beaters. They started the 2022-23 season in top gear, getting to the No. 1 spot straight away. They’re still standing there, but the question is for how long. Can they stay on top of the Prem until the end of the season?</p>
<p>A recent slip in their form has made their fans worry whether Man City can catch up with them. Right now, the point difference is just three points in Arsenal’s favor. The Gunners do have one game in hand, but their recent form isn’t giving their fans optimism that they won’t fail again.</p>
<p>They got one loss and one draw in their last two Premier League games, which is strange as they played against mediocre teams, Everton and Brentford. One possible explanation is that they have problems with injuries. One of their key men in the first half of the season, Gabriel Jesus, remains sidelined, but he was out before as well and they didn’t mind.</p>
<p>A Must-Win Scenario for Pep Guardiola’s Boys</p>
<p>Manchester City have dropped too many points this season and there’s no room for more if they want to stay in the race for the title. The reigning champions are sitting in second place, with a 15-3-4 record, which isn’t too bad, but it’s just not something they got us used to.</p>
<p>Their biggest problem this season has been their form on the road. In away matches, they’re 5-2-3, with two straight losses (to Tottenham and Manchester United). This time, however, they mustn’t let the same happen.</p>
<p>Luckily for Pep Guardiola, he’s got some elite players at his disposal. Not only do they have talent, but they also have plenty of experience playing important games such as the one scheduled for Wednesday.</p>
<p>Arsenal vs Manchester City Prediction</p>
<p>Guardiola’s boys are coming to London to grab all three points. It’s not going to be easy as Arsenal play a similar style of soccer to them, but we do think Man City is the better team. The sheer quality of Man City’s players should be the decisive factor in Wednesday’s game.</p>
<p>Picks: Manchester City to win and over 2.5 goals</p>
