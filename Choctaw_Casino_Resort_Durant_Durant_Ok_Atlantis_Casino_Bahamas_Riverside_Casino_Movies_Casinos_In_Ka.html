<p>Pragmatic Play has doubled down on its partnership with MrQ in the regulated iGaming market in the United Kingdom. The two companies previously signed a content partnership that involved the distribution of slot games, but are now expanding this tie-up with a fresh vertical – live casino games.</p>
<p>As a result, MrQ’s players in the United Kingdom will have access to even more of Pragmatic’s esteemed and player-favorite games, including live roulette and blackjack. Pragmatic Play will similarly provide some of its more original content and work, namely PowerUP Roulette and Sweet Bonanza CandyLand, among others.</p>
<p>MrQ already has access to many of Pragmatic’s outstanding slot games, including Sugar Rush and Gates of Olympus. Commenting on this fresh opportunity, the supplier’s Chief Operating Officer, Irina Cornides, said that the company was delighted to see the two partners step up their efforts and expand into a brand-new vertical. She said:</p>
<p>"Pragmatic Play has established a fruitful relationship with the UK operator to date, and we look forward to growing our partnership even further as we add Live Casino to our supply of premium slots."</p>
<p>MrQ Chief Executive Officer Savvas Fellas was similarly thankful for the opportunity and explained that the addition of yet another vertical by Pragmatic Play was a "natural progression." MrQ is always happy to strengthen its portfolio of titles with powerful and trusted brands and work on expanding existing ties.</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play has a very ambitious production pace, which involves up to eight new slot releases a month along with various games in the company’s portfolio, such as bingo, live casino, and virtual sports options. The alliance between the two companies should help them both strengthen their positions in the evolving regulated market in the United Kingdom with more developments already in the pipeline.</p>
<p>MrQ has been able to strengthen its content portfolio over the past months with more operators. In November, the operator expanded its library of games with slots by Push Gaming. Pragmatic Play is not solely focused on the United Kingdom, as the company has been broadening its reach in another important region – Latin America.</p>
<p>The company has struck a succession of partnerships in recent months, determined to continue expanding as it has landed deals with Jacare.bet in Brazil and Track and Trace in Venezuela.</p>
