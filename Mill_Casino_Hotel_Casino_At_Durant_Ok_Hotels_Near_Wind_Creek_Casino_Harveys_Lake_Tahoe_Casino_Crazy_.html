    <h1>Mill Casino Hotel Casino At Durant Ok Hotels Near Wind Creek Casino Harveys Lake Tahoe Casino Crazy</h1>

<p>The company's expansion in the region is expected to propel the reach of its popular live draw games</p>
<p>The leading provider of 24/7 live betting services and multi-content, Sports Information Services (SIS), announced a new partnership, enabling it to reach new customers in strategic African markets. The company has announced it joined forces with Aardvark Technologies, a leading provider of solutions, services and technology, powering iGaming and betting operators.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the recent deal, SIS agreed to deliver its market-leading live numbers draws content. As a result, more online and retail operators across Africa will be able to access the thrilling numbers draws games. Operators that tap into SIS’ games will benefit from more than 200,000 betting events annually via its 49’s live numbers draws. Those betting options include the popular 49’s Original Live Draw.</p>
<p>Currently, 49’s has proven its popularity across the globe and it is a product that is proven to boost engagement and retention in the retail and online sector. Operating for more than two decades, the popular game offers live draws twice every day from SIS’ studio based in Manchester, United Kingdom. On the other hand, 39’s and Fast 15’s draw games offer a more fast-paced form of entertainment.</p>
<p>Thanks to the latest collaboration, Aardvark Technologies will enable operators in South Africa as well as other African regions to gain access to SIS’ fan-favorite content. Additionally, operators would also benefit from the content provider’s leading betting and revenue-boosting features.</p>
<p>The deal with Aardvark comes on the heels of another important deal announced by SIS. Early last month, the company confirmed the integration of its complete portfolio of services, powering Altenar’s Sportsbook.</p>
<p>The Company Plans to Expand Further in Africa</p>
<p>Simas Denisovas, Aardvark’s founder and CEO, revealed that the company is thrilled to expand the offering for its clients with the addition of the leading products supplied by SIS. “Partnering with SIS and integrating its leading 49’s live numbers portfolio will ensure we continue to enjoy a commanding position across Africa, providing our operator clients with a regular stream of engaging, premium betting experiences,” said Denisovas in conclusion.</p>
<p>“49’s is already a big hit with bettors across South Africa, with the chance to win big from small stakes proving to be a highly attractive proposition.“ Joe Andrews, head of sales Africa for SIS</p>
<p>Joe Andrews, SIS’ head of sales Africa, spoke about the growing popularity of the company’s products in the country. According to him, the live numbers draws enable the players to secure big payouts with small wagers, making them incredibly attractive.</p>
<p>Andrews added that the company is dedicated to growing its content reach and expanding its visibility within different jurisdictions across Africa. Finally, he acknowledged that the partnership with Aardvark complements precisely this goal.</p>
