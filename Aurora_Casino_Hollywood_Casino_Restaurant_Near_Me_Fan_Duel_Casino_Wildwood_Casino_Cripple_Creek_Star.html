<p>The future of the gaming industry in the US is bright, at least according to the president of the American Gaming Association (AGA) Bill Miller who came up with his remarks today regarding the industry’s recovery, further policy developments in Washington DC, as well as the association’s 2021 priorities.</p>
<p>Optimistic Outlook for the Future</p>
<p>“There’s huge pent-up demand for gaming—and I’m upbeat about the second half of the year in particular.” Bill Miller, President and CEO, AGA</p>
<p>A research conducted by the association showed one out of every three adult Americans would be visiting a casino 2021, indicating the highest rate of interest since AGA introduced the tracking indicator in March 2020.</p>
<p>“As vaccines roll out, people will be excited to travel, hungry for entertainment, and desperate to get out and have fun again. That’s an environment where gaming will thrive.” Bill Miller, President and CEO, AGA</p>
<p>The AGA research also found out that 80% of those who intend to visit a casino in 2021 were satisfied with the level of safety casinos implemented at re-opening.</p>
<p>The recovery of the industry began in September and October, AGA’s Commercial Gaming Revenue Tracker showed, posting 6.3% increase in gaming revenue driven by interest in sports betting.</p>
<p>Residents of 17 states and the District of Columbia wagered $2.82 billion in October, making it the best month in the history of sports betting in the US, while gross gaming revenue from slot and table games accounted for $2.98 billion, a 3.4% increase on a sequential basis.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, as the daily rate of new coronavirus cases started climbing up in multiple states, authorities implemented further restrictions in an attempt to flatten the curve, including curfews, which shuttered the initial rebound for the industry.</p>
<p>2021 Priorities</p>
<p>AGA CEO Miller outlined the association’s main priority for 2021 would be to facilitate the acceleration of the industry recovery, focusing of 4 main areas: coordinated efforts for additional economic relief, developing of gaming champions in Congress and the Biden administration, counteraction against harmful policies and enhance reforms for industry competitiveness, and proprietary research and strategic communication efforts to ensure the voice of the industry is heard.</p>
<p>“We come into 2021 with a strong foundation, a clear focus, record levels of support among Americans, and a loyal customer base that wants the excitement only gaming can deliver.” Bill Miller, President and CEO, AGA</p>
<p>As part of the association’s effort to support the industry recovery, Bill Miller sent a letter to the 117th Congress, expressing the industry’s commitment to work in accord with both the House and the Senate during this challenging period for the nation.</p>
