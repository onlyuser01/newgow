<p>Soft2Bet, a company that specializes in white label solutions for the iGaming industry, has taken stock of 2023, deeming it a successful one for its operations. Soft2bet achieved much in the past 12 months, but it’s equally keen to harness present-day trends and channel them into the new year as well.</p>
<p>As part of its annual review, the company issued a detailed update about what has been achieved, noting that gamification will play a major role in the delivery of content and solutions to the gambling industry in 2024 as well. The company tersely outlined the most likely trends that will continue, with gamification at the very top.</p>
<p>Next, the company said that the industry is entering the era of mobile gaming, whose share is going to continue to grow. Artificial Intelligence rather than feared should be embraced by companies from the gambling industry as it will usher in new features and shift the development paradigm.</p>
<p>Some studios are already using AI to carry out the bulk of the development process. Soft2Bet is similarly aware of the importance of enhancing the UI and player analytics which will continue to make the difference between success and near-misses. Responsible gambling will be similarly a part of this growth equation.</p>
<p>For example, 75% of players interviewed by Soft2Bet in one form or another confirmed that seeing responsible gambling tools at an operator inherently increased their trust in the brand. Interestingly, 11% said that it decreased their trust, and another 14% said that they did not let these tools change their perception of a casino.</p>
<p>Then, 90% of gamblers confirmed that they are actively seeking to set limits to their gambling habits as they gamble. Commenting on the results in 2023, and outlining the future of the company, CEO and Fonder Uri Poliavich said that a big focus will be put on MEGA, or Motivational Engineering, which has already shown promise, noting:</p>
<p>"As we move into 2024, the key to succeeding in our industry lies in adapting to evolving player preferences, harnessing cutting-edge AI, advanced motivational engineering techniques, and ensuring a seamless user experience. […] With our innovative and hyper-localized MEGA solutions, advanced analytics, and a strong emphasis on responsible gaming, we're poised to not only adapt to the changing landscape but to lead and define it."</p>
<p>All of this is part of a larger effort that has allowed Soft2Bet to secure leadership positions in the industry, increasing its financial and operational results throughout 2023. Just recently, Soft2Bet delivered on its Romanian iGaming license and launched with Don.ro.</p>
