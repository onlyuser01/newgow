    <h1>Coushatta Casino Resort Ndb Casino Casinos Near Me With Hotel Planet Hollywood Las Vegas Resort Casi</h1>

<p>Good evening, I played 2 bets on the match Mallorca - Girona at stoiximan on 30/1/2021. At halftime one with 50 euros in the ace and a live 194 euros in 91 'for a match goal in a Mallorca counterattack. Do you claim that I played the bet after the goal was scored while in the company how long does it take to lock a bet before placing it? I played it in the last seconds of the 90's, and it took 3-4 seconds before it was placed. Then, after a few seconds (about 3 to 4) the goal came in and the betting option was blocked.</p>
<p>Why do I think I was wronged in the matter? I normally placed the bet of 194 euros, if the goal was lost or canceled (because I saw that the referee looked for offside, if you see the phase), that is, now that 1067 euros were won, he did not pay me but if he canceled the goal, I would I lost my money, right?</p>
<p>It is very bad what they do and use as an excuse the rule 1.14.1 (Live bet which we have reason to believe is played after the result of an event is already known, or the selected participant or team has gained a comparative advantage (e.g. x. a scoring, a dismissal for the other team, etc.), we reserve the right to cancel the bet, whether it is won or lost.)</p>
<p>I have pictures that the bet was played normally live at 91 ', the image that is won, the withdrawal that you asked to be made after the match since this money entered my account and that then the next day (!!!) they took it out as a canceled bet with so i want!</p>
<p>I asked them to return my bet since I played it normally and the company claims that it was canceled because I knew that the score had gone ahead (how to know something like that when the betting option is blocked when a goal is scored</p>
<p>I can send you the pictures I mentioned to you as well as the conversation with their department, saying the same thing as the answer. Rule 1.14.1</p>
<p>Please help me if you can since the profit is 1067 euros and I can not leave it like that obviously. What can I do since the company does not give me any proof that as their rule says "we have reason to believe" and it does not cover me? The bet was played normally, their system took it and they refuse to pay me! This is unthinkableâ€¦</p>
<p>Also later with their department there is the specific answer</p>
<p>Thank you for your email. We would like to inform you that your card has been extensively checked. Specifically, you placed your ticket when the timer showed 91:02 in the match and at that time, a second before the goal was scored. The market should not have been available at that time, it was inadvertent and therefore the goal was canceled. We apologize again for any inconvenience.</p>
<p>Beyond that, it is your decision how to move and you do not agree with what is valid.</p>
<p>At your disposal for any additional information and clarification.</p>
<p>However, I found the video of the match and the goal is scored at 91.05 !!!</p>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9XWYe8KyNg&amp;feature=emb_err_woyt (in the link is the moment of the goal that we see clearly that at 91.02 the ball is in the center where they accepted my bet.</p>
<p>That was their answer.</p>
<p>Thank you for your email. We would like to inform you that the cancellation was not made for a second, since there was a phase that went to the goals, the markets should not be open during those seconds. When an aggressive phase occurs, the markets close for a few seconds and inadvertently remain open. We can not answer regarding other hypothetical scenarios, since however the card was placed after the goal was scored, your card would have been canceled again as you would have bet it with the wrong score.</p>
<p>In essence, they tell me that the bet that came in at 91.02 should have been blocked, but what is my fault that 3 seconds later the goal came in and I played it normally.</p>
<p>My answer to them</p>
<p>Well, I saw that the goal came in at 91.05 in the video and as you claim the bet was placed at 91.02. I had pressed the button a few seconds before. So what you say is not true when I placed the bet was about 4 to 5 seconds before the goal. What's my fault you didn't block it? I placed the bet normally on the counterattack, normally raising 194 euros on the condition not only to win but also to lose. You are wrong in this case.</p>
<p>Since the bet was placed at 91.02, some phase has not yet taken place in the video if you watch it, but the ball is still in the center. How many more lies will you tell me not to pay the bet?</p>
<p>Unfortunately I do not see any edge and I have contacted the EEEP, Malta Gaming Commission and eCogra.</p>
<p>To see if a solution will be found to my problem ...</p>
