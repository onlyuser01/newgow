    <h1>Traverse City Casino Online Casino Usa Real Money Casino Riverboat Casino Extreme Login Sunset Casin</h1>

<p>I just wanted to protect you from that.</p>
<p>That was all I wanted and nothing else!</p>
<p>Do you think I enjoy trying to explain something to people that they don't want to understand?</p>
<p>I didn't mean it badly from the start.</p>
<p>The casino would have caused problems either way, regardless of whether people write here.</p>
<p>And they knew full well that people would mention it once they figured it out.</p>
<p>Their strategy will always be to open casinos by cheating players and then simply opening new ones.</p>
<p>I just wanted to warn players to save themselves a headache as I'm not one to befriend when others are suffering, quite the contrary.</p>
<p>It makes me angry, which is also why I write so much.</p>
<p>But from my side that was it :)</p>
<p>I think people now have a good overview and whoever still chooses to do so, unfortunately, has only themselves to blame.</p>
<p>They just wanted to prevent people from chasing their funds for 12 weeks.</p>
<p>After waiting so long I hope everyone gets paid out, that's really the least the casino can do.</p>
<p>Still, I wish you all the best.</p>
<p>And to the Scatterhall Casino It's really about time you took a stand on everything here and started paying out the players.</p>
<p>Mistakes are human, but making people wait 12 weeks is overkill.</p>
<p>Show your good will and show us all we were wrong and please pay the players off.</p>
<p>If you see things going uphill after a while, you can delete any negative comments so they're no longer visible!</p>
<p>The only thing they should do now is pay the players in full.</p>
<p>Negative comments can be deleted at any time.</p>
<p>Start thinking about your customers, who are the reason you are here in the first place.</p>
<p>Because without them you are nothing.</p>
<p>Best regards.</p>
