    <h1>Four Winds Casino South Bend Indiana Casino Bonus No Deposit Casino Cocktail Iowa Casinos Council Bl</h1>

<p>Hi I only have emails and there is no option to add them here.</p>
<p>My account is not closed.</p>
<p>They put the 3000 nett loss limit on my account, they asked for bank statements which I gave them.</p>
<p>I was chatting to Mila on the customer chat and she said that they just needed proof of ownership of my company.</p>
<p>As you can imagine I am very reluctant to share this private information with a casino as there has been cases of casinos selling information on to third parties...</p>
<p>As she said they just needed proof of ownership to lift or increase the limit I sent the documents through.</p>
<p>The next day they wanted a breakdown of my business deposits and my deposits from my business to my personal account which was the account I pay money into the casino from. I have many bank accounts and I only use one account to gamble from.</p>
<p>I feel this is very intrusive and when is it going to be enough?</p>
<p>The bank statements I gave was one from my painting company and one from my chem wash company.</p>
<p>These show from 23rd March to 25 May I had about $55 000 deposited in the accounts.</p>
<p>I feel that that should be plenty of proof that I can afford to gamble more than $3000 per month.</p>
<p>The next day they asked me to send them verification of my drivers licence which I replied to them (I'm already verified and sent that in a couple of days after I opened the account) as they were requesting it again I got really worried!!</p>
<p>They should have it already and if not where has my information gone!?</p>
<p>I replied that there is no way in hell I'm sending them any more personal data as they cannot be trusted to keep it secure!!!</p>
<p>I have every right to be concerned.</p>
<p>They later apologised and said they do have it on record....</p>
<p>I don't know what to believe!</p>
<p>I cannot trust them, they have lied to me. So I refuse to send anymore of my personal data.</p>
<p>I was told that the reason they put the 3000 limit on is because of the speeding fine I sent through from the court letter I received which was the only government document that I had to verify my address with.</p>
<p>NOT BECAUSE THEY FEEL I'M A PROBLEM GAMBLER.</p>
<p>That's my real issue and that's why I think I'm being treated unfairly.</p>
<p>I gave them what they asked for, more than I wanted to and they just want more.</p>
<p>It's unfair and borderline illegal.</p>
<p>They claim to have my best interests at heart but I'm not a fool, they are a casino they care about PROFIT NOT ME.</p>
<p>I'm a 45 year old successful business owner and a lot of my income is cash as well.</p>
<p>I can afford to loose 10k per month and that doesn't affect me.</p>
<p>It angers me that they give the impression they care when we all know the truth, they have laws to abide by fair enough but the whole reason for placing the limit on me is unfair.</p>
<p>It was all I had at the time.</p>
<p>I have paid my fine by the way.</p>
<p>I believe that I should be treated with respect and if I pay for a service I should receive that service.</p>
<p>That's what I do in business and I expect the same in return.</p>
<p>I don't have any of the chat, just emails, I'll try to attach them to the email you sent me.</p>
<p>This has just gone way over board on there part and I can't trust them to keep my data safe. Hence why I will not supply any more information.</p>
<p>They should have requested everything to start with and I would not have sent anything in.</p>
<p>Not long after I sent the bank statement and proof of ownership of my company I began to get strange spam emails from unknown sources!!</p>
<p>I'm really concerned that other people will be bullied by them like I have been.</p>
<p>I am still waiting for three withdraws I made 3 days ago to be sent to me as well.</p>
<p>A small amount of money but it's my money so I'm hoping that they give it to me.</p>
<p>I have requested my account be closed but I have not sent any more information to them and will not.</p>
<p>I want what is owed to me and a refund of my recent deposits on the day my limit was up because I had no warning I was close to any limit as I forgot about it because I didn't set the 3000, I was playing the slots and the message appeared that the limit was up, no warning nothing.</p>
<p>L</p>
<p>I set a 10 000 limit weekly and a 40 000 monthly loss.</p>
<p>Sorry about the book I have written but it's just NOT RIGHT!</p>
<p>They cover themselves in every way possible so they are blameless.</p>
<p>Discusting that they can get away with the terms and conditions they set.</p>
<p>We the customer's end up with no leg to stand on if something goes wrong with anything.</p>
<p>Thanks for getting back to me so quickly, I really appreciate it.</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>
<p>Mazen k.</p>
