The Commerce Casino &amp; Hotel in Commerce, California, is where LA-based flyweight fighter Cody Davis will try to win the vacant LFA Featherweight title against Brazilian fighter Igor Siguera in the LFA 161 main event. Will he succeed? Let’s find out!</p>

<p>Reasons Why Cody Davis’s LFA 161 Odds Are So Short</p>
<p>Cody Davis is a -500 favorite and there’s a reason for that. Actually, there are several reasons, starting with the fact that he’s got a pretty impressive professional MMA record. Now a 28-year-old, Davis has been fighting professionally for two and a half years, winning seven fights and losing just one so far.</p>
<p>The loss in question happened in his second LFA bout when Mark Climaco beat him by a unanimous decision after three rounds of intense fighting. Since then, however, Davis is 2-0, with both of his wins happening by submission.</p>
<p>Speaking of submissions, this is his favorite method of winning, which is no surprise as he’s a great wrestler, with amazing grappling skills. His LFA 161 opponent also excels in those things, but Siguera is going to have a really tough time trying to take Davis down.</p>
<p>Although the American is a few inches shorter than the Brazilian, Davis has a lower center of gravity which makes it very difficult to tip him over.</p>
<p>Can Igor Siguera Overcome His +350 LFA 161 Odds?</p>
<p>Igor Siguera is 9-1 overall, but he’s never fought such a strong opponent as Cody Davis. Instead, he got to the Legacy Fighting Alliance after doing okay in promotions like UGP, Azteca Fight League, and other regional organizations in South America.</p>
<p>He did okay in every fight he won, but two of his wins did happen by a split decision. This includes his most recent win, which happened over a year ago.</p>
<p>Siguera hasn’t fought in more than 12 months, but this doesn’t mean he’s out of shape. On the contrary, he’s training at Pitbull Brothers MMA gym, which is owned by Patricio and Patricky Freire, two brothers known as “Pitbulls.”</p>
<p>According to “The Golden Boy,” the whole team’s been helping him study his opponent as Pitbull Brothers would love to have another champ on the roster. The man he’s been sparring with during the preparation for the LFA 161 headliner is Felipe Bunes, the man who won the vacant LFA Flyweight title earlier this month.</p>
<p>Cody Davis vs. Igor Siguera PFL 161 Prediction</p>
<p>Suguera’s LFA 161 odds are wrong. He’s a great fighter with a great pedigree, and he definitely doesn’t deserve the role of such a huge underdog. But he should be an underdog. It’s just that he doesn’t have the experience fighting at such a high level as his rival for the interim LFA Flyweight title.</p>
<p>The pressure might get to him, especially knowing that the LFA 161 main event is held at The Commerce Casino &amp; Hotel in Davis’s hometown of LA.</p>
<p>Pick: Cody Davis to win</p>
