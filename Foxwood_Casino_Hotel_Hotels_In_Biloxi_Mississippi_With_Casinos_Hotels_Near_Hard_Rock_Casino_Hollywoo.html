<p>The current agreement as “another positive step” in securing the integrity of professional tennis</p>
<p>The International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) announced that it will work with the International Tennis Federation (ITF) to provide junior athletes with integrity education. The program will be a part of junior tennis players’ introduction to life on tour.</p>
<p>The new education will be mandatory for players with an active Juniors International Player Identification Number (IPIN). The IPIN is a registration number that allows junior players to compete in the ITF tour.</p>
<p>The education module is fully designed and delivered by the ITIA and will be available in English, French and Spanish languages. It will introduce young players to the integrity values and rules, getting them to know the Tennis Anti-Doping Programme (TADP) and the Tennis Anti-Corruption Program (TACP).</p>
<p>In addition, the program will teach players how to contact ITIA staff for support.</p>
<p>The deal will deepen the ties between the ITIA and the ITF, highlighting their desire to maintain the integrity of the sport.</p>
<p>The Two Bodies Seek to Protect Tennis from Fraud</p>
<p>ITIA’s chief executive officer, Karen Moorhouse, described the current agreement as “another positive step” in securing the integrity of professional tennis. She noted that the mandatory education will make sure that the pathway into the world of pro tennis “contains and important and robust integrity checkpoint” for aspiring pro athletes.</p>
<p>This is more than making sure that the players know the rules, though. By introducing ourselves to the players early in their careers, we offer our support and ensure that juniors’ first interaction with topics like anti-doping comes as education, rather than a test. Karen Moorhouse, CEO, ITIA</p>
<p>Moorhouse added that the modules will be provided through the ITF’s official education platform, ITF Academy. She added that the ITIA’s integrity introduction will join two other mandatory modules on pre-tournament and in-competition rules.</p>
<p>Kelly Fairweather, the chief executive officer of the ITF, also commented on the matter, saying that her team is fully committed to curbing fraud in tennis and protecting its integrity by preparing junior players for all aspects of life on the tour.</p>
<p>Fairweather pointed out that the mandatory modules are an integral part of that:</p>
<p>Every subject covered in these modules – from tournament entry systems to code of conduct to integrity – is designed to equip players with the skills and knowledge they need to move through the ITF pathway and beyond. Kelly Fairweather, CEO, ITF</p>
<p>In other news, the ITIA just sanctioned Mark Philippoussis over betting sponsorship violations.</p>
