<p>Kevin van Veen, a popular soccer player, has opened up about his struggles with gambling and gambling addiction. The Motherwell FC 31-year-old player said that he had had issues with gambling and games of chance since the age of 18. The Dutchman said that the addiction has gradually grown and led to mental health and anxiety at a fairly young age, spoiling his relationships and deprivinghim ofhappiness.</p>
<p>Playing as part of Motherwell, the player has found the strength to open up about the problem, which is often the first step toward recovery. In a report first published by MailSport, van Veen spoke about how he first got started. He was gambling at a casino with friends and he placed bets of $10, $50, $100, or $200 at first but as time went by, and he started receiving more sizable paychecks from his soccer career, the player turned to even bigger wagers.</p>
<p>His first $10 wager was a far cry from the $1,000 the player would place regularly on a single round of a game. The player added that he could feel the addiction seeping into his body, and he would eventually start prioritizing gambling in favor of playing at casinos.</p>
<p>He would miss training, the player confirmed, one of the biggest red flags for a soccer player and one of the most serious offenses. But after realization dawned that the man had a problem, van Veen sought help:</p>
<p>"I would wake up in the middle of the night and jump out of bed to go to a casino – because my body needed that kick. I even went for rehab in South Africa where I had to learn about the value of money."</p>
<p>However, he has been able to clean his act in 2020 when he worked with Tony Adams’ Sporting Chance facility to address his issue and ensure that he stays clean. The soccer player has been free from gambling for the past two years, marking his tremendous progress, but he cautions that the desire to gamble is always there, lurking.</p>
<p>He admitted that he had a lot of help from various professionals, teammates, and family members. Van Veen has been urged to speak up by his physiologist and become the latest inspiration story where a problem gambler turns their life around. Responsible gambling is crucial to enjoying the hobby and van Veen's story should serve as a warning.</p>
