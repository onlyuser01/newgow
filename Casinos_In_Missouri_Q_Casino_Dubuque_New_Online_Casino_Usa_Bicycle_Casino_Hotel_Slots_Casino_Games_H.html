    <h1>Casinos In Missouri Q Casino Dubuque New Online Casino Usa Bicycle Casino Hotel Slots Casino Games H</h1>

<p>Aurora citizens wanted to know more about what’s going to change when the casino moves to a new location</p>
<p>Hollywood Casino Resort just held a two-hour open house for local residents, allowing them to gain insights into its new project planned near Interstate 88. This follows Penn Entertainment’s decision to relocate the casino in Aurora, Illinois – an operation expected to cost $360 million.</p>
<p>Since the casino company seeks to keep fans in touch with the latest developments in the project, Hollywood Casino Resort invited the locals to hear more. City officials and developers attended the two-hour event, answering people’s questions about the relocation of the casino.</p>
<p>The open house event confirmed that construction works are expected to begin later in 2023 if Penn Entertainment successfully secures all necessary approvals. In addition to costing $360 million, the project will see the Aurora casino expanded.</p>
<p>The relocated venue will sport 50 live gaming tables and 900 slot machines. In addition, the adjacent hotel will have 200 rooms ready to accommodate customers. The new Hollywood Casino Resort will also include a bar, a restaurant, a spa and an event center.</p>
<p>However, some of the locals had concerns about the relocation.</p>
<p>Locals Wanted to Know What’s Changing</p>
<p>Pat Weiler is one of the locals who are concerned about the relocation of the Hollywood Casino Resort. He believes that the property was vital to downtown Aurora and noted that the relocation plans came out of nowhere.</p>
<p>While the relocation might have a positive effect on property values, which will be a good thing for the property owners in the area, Sean Morrissey, another local, had some concerns. Morrissey said that while the relocation might be a good thing, he is uncertain who will be paying for this – Aurora taxpayers or the casino owners.</p>
<p>Furthermore, customers posed questions about how traffic would change and what would happen to the former property.</p>
<p>Jeff Morris, Penn Entertainment’s vice president of public affairs, commented on the matter, saying that his team is happy that so many locals are interested in the development. He noted that most of the questions were to be expected and included traffic changes and what improvements are coming to the area, such as new jobs, etc.</p>
<p>Clayton Muhammad, Aurora’s chief communications and equity officer, promised that this open house event is but the first of a series of events. He said that, just as Penn Entertainment promised, consumers will be kept updated and their questions will be answered.</p>
