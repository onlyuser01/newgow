    <h1>Skyriver Casino Win River Resort Casino Parx Casino Shippensburg Pa Bitcoin Casino No Deposit Bonus</h1>

<p>I would be in favor of simplifying the legislation.</p>
<p>Which is difficult or almost impossible to enforce in its current form.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It contradicts international law.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is vaguely formulated which creates a lot of gaps and gray areas.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Schleswig-Hollstein's previous arrangement was much better.</p>
<p>The so-called :</p>
<p>"Law of the State of Schleswig-Holstein on the Taxation of Online Casino Games" of 9 March 2022</p>
<p>To date, the only licensing authority for internet casinos in Germany.</p>
<p>It is difficult to understand why a need for action was determined here.</p>
<p>Which ultimately led to the replacement of the law by the "New German Online Gambling Act".</p>
<p>The point of taxation, which is essential for state authorities, the transparency obligation and security are very well worked out here.</p>
<p>In addition, the starting point here was European companies.</p>
<p>Prerequisite for a permit for the operation of online casinos in Germany was a company based in Europe.</p>
<p>The free competition as well as the principle of equal rights for the purpose of the competitiveness of the companies was oriented here clearly more openly and in the sense of the European community.</p>
<p>Here the legislators are obliged to make corrections!</p>
