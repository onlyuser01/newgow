<p>In case of any questions or need of help, feel free to contact me at branislav.b@casino.guru.</p>
<p>If you are not satisfied with the complaint solution, I recommend you consult the gambling authority that the casino is regulated by and submit a complaint directly to it. The casino is regulated by GRA (Gibraltar Regulatory Authority). If you decide on this option, once you have a final decision from the regulator, please let us know about the results, and we can review the complaint again on our side.</p>
<p>Sorry, we were not able to help you with this one, but please, do not hesitate to contact us in the future, if you run into any issues with this or any other casino. We are here to help.</p>
<p>I was provided with sufficient evidence supporting the casino's decision. After gathering all the necessary information and data, we are rejecting this complaint as unjustified due to breaching the casino's terms and conditions - discovery and abuse of systemic deficiencies of the casino and/or its payment gateway and also multiple attempts to abuse the other system parts in your favour at the expense of the casino. You were able to play with twice the balance than you were eligible to, compared to the real deposit that you made to the casino. The casino acted correctly and within its Terms and Conditions.</p>
