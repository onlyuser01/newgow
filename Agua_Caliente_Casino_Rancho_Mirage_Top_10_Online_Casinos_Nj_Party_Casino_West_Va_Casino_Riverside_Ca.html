    <h1>Agua Caliente Casino Rancho Mirage Top 10 Online Casinos Nj Party Casino West Va Casino Riverside Ca</h1>

<p>I wanted to post this to show you guys that stake.com, sports radar (their sports odds provider) and darko from sports are nothing but scamming, incompetent scumbags.</p>
<p>I had a multi for about $1700.00. All my selections were live plays except for the last selection on the slip which was a tennis match. Tennis match was scheduled to start about 2 hours after my multi was placed.</p>
<p>Photo of my betslip below</p>
<p>https://ibb.co/zG8Dm8m</p>
<p>As you can see, the odds I received on the final selection were -345.</p>
<p>Now let’s move on to the fun part. Both tennis players came onto the court for warmups, odds went live on both stake and other platforms.</p>
<p>Here’s a photo of the odds BEFORE the match was set to begin.</p>
<p>https://ibb.co/KGHskFm</p>
<p>https://ibb.co/2kPwsQx</p>
<p>All of a sudden, my player is +425 as opposed to -345 lol</p>
<p>Anyways, as this is a clear line error and would affect my cashout price, I immediately contact support. I run into the luxury of speaking with a scumbag by the name of darko from the sports team. Now keep in mind, darko has always fucked me over as he has personal issues with me. I thought in this instant, he would use common sense as it’s almost a 800 point swing in a few minutes.</p>
<p>I kindly ask darko to void the bet (win or lose) or to honour the new price of +425 (which was clearly the correct price as every other book had it at this price)</p>
<p>Here are his responses.</p>

<p>https://ibb.co/n3TS1v9</p>
<p>https://ibb.co/tpyb9Ph</p>
<p>https://ibb.co/HpdfVMb</p>
<p>All correspondence is happening literally during the match. I expected a quick void so that there would be no discrepancy if my player somehow won.</p>
<p>Darko drags it out for the whole match and he even goes as far as to tell me "don’t cashout the bet" ok darko, I’ll listen to you and wait.</p>
<p>Let’s fast forward to the second set. My player is now -5000 live and they were offering $5300 of $6400 on a cashout. Darko continues to tell me not to cash out.</p>

<p>anyways, I don’t hear back from darko until it’s 5-1 in the second set for my player and he decides to tell me "let’s just leave it how it is" after trolling me the whole match for what clearly was a line error, he waited until the last second to decide on his own to just leave it as is.</p>

<p>As everything stands, I am requesting to be refunded the difference for the bet on the correct odds of +425 which would bring the total payout to +1528 odds and a total payout of 0.63381249 BTC. I was paid out 0.13734496 BTC which would leave a difference of 0.49646753 BTC. It’s quite clear that support was doing this on purpose and waiting to see who would win the match before deciding to void the bet or honor the correct odds.</p>
<p>I have been a customer on stake for almost two years with a net profit of almost -1.5 million dollars. I truly hope that in the future they do not do this to their customers because it does not look good. I play on many other books and they swiftly void selections or fix the odds immediately and not wait until the match is completed. In my personal opinion, this was a personal attack from Darko against me.</p>
<p>I have tried other avenues to come to a resolution but I have been ignored and stake also removes my posts on their forum. I have tried contacting both CEOs Mladen and Edward, as well as my VIP host, the first two do not respond and my host is unable to assist. I have also attached a conversation I had with another sports support member yesterday (Stefan) and he was totally in agreement with me.</p>
<p>Don’t trust this scam site. Especially if support dislikes you. They will play games with you and fuck you over like it’s normal. Darko is a piece of shit and I look forward to posting this on every single SPORTSBOOK forum in the world.</p>
<p>HERE IS AN UPDATE AFTER SPEAKING WITH STEFAN FROM SPORTS TEAM</p>
<p>Clearly he has some common sense unlike others.</p>

<p>https://ibb.co/8NgDL1S</p>
<p>https://ibb.co/rGtLqYc</p>
<p>https://ibb.co/kGY4vwT</p>
<p>as per stakes terms and conditions</p>
<p>"In the case of any obviously incorrectly displayed or calculated prices, we reserve the right to void betting. This includes a deviation of more than 100% in the pay-out compared to the market average."</p>
<p>I have also filed a complaint on askgamblers.com and stake has refused to respond for over 5 days now.</p>
<p>I have also filed a complaint through stake and they keep sending me the same robotic responses.</p>
<p>I have lost almost 2 million dollars on stake and they are legitimately scamming me for 0.5 BTC. It's laughable.</p>
<p>I will also be contacting their regulator/licensing body.</p>
