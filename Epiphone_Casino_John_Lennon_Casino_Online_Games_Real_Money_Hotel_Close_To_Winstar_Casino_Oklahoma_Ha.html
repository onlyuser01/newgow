    <h1>Epiphone Casino John Lennon Casino Online Games Real Money Hotel Close To Winstar Casino Oklahoma Ha</h1>

<p>Another illegal gambling site has been shut down in Oakland, CA. Police swooped in this past Wednesday, surprising the operation and uncovering a cache of weapons and illicit drugs. Oakland has seen several illegal casinos come to a grinding halt over the past year.</p>
<p>End of the Line for Illegal Casino</p>
<p>The Oakland Police Department (OPD) indicated in a press release that officers issued a search warrant on a property on East 16th Street this past Wednesday. In the process, they confiscated ten guns, including four assault weapons with extended magazines, 5.5 lbs. of crystal meth, and 15.5 pounds of marijuana.</p>
<p>The OPD added that the street value for the illegal meth was $70,000. Marijuana, on the other hand, is legal in the city, as well as across the state. Additionally, the officers seized 12 alleged illegal gaming machines and over $7,000 in cash.</p>
<p>Three Raids in Seven Months in Oakland</p>
<p>Two other illegal gambling enterprises were shut down by police in July and October of last year. The first was at a residence on 14th Avenue, while the second was on 17th Avenue.</p>
<p>In the first incident, police raided an East Oakland illegal casino and confiscated guns, narcotics, and gambling machines. Police said at the time that the bust was prompted in part by many complaints from the community.</p>
<p>Officers seized 18 illegal casinos gaming machines during the bust. Eight firearms were also seized, including two assault rifles and 30 high-capacity magazines, as well as a bulletproof vest.</p>
<p>The officers seized drugs with street values exceeding $76,000, including heroin, methamphetamines, and 60 bottles of promethazine. More than $21,000 worth of cash was also confiscated. Only one person was taken into custody.</p>
<p>In the second incident, four loaded firearms, a 50-round drum magazine, and a flamethrower were all seized during a search. Eight gambling machines, $17,500 in cash, and a quarter-pound each of suspected methamphetamines were among the other items that were seized. Police also seized a large amount of tar heroin.</p>
<p>Police said that at least 11 people were taken into custody during the search and that two others were held on outstanding warrants. A third suspect in the alleged gambling operation was also detained on suspicion of felony possession of a firearm.</p>
