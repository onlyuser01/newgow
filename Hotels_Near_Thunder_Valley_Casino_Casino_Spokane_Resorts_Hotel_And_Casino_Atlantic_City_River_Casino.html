<p>The Tipico sportsbook went into an exclusive partnership with the Rhinegeist Brewery in Cincinnati</p>
<p>It’s been a very strong start of the year for sports betting, and Tipico hasn’t shied away from expanding its US presence.</p>
<p>Tipico Getting Strong Traction in Ohio</p>
<p>The exclusive brand partnership will see the launch of the Tipico Sports Deck in the historical Over-the-Rhine district in the city. The Tipico Sports Deck will be completed early this year and will feature nine additional TVs, deck-styled seating, a variety of sports-themed activations, and more. The ceremonial launch was last Sunday, January 15.</p>
<p>The event was held during one of the brewery’s pregame watch parties – the First Round Showdown. The match was between the Cincinnati Bengals and the Baltimore Ravens, and attendees got to enjoy the first look at the new Tipico-sponsored Sports Deck. Additionally, they were also offered an exclusive promotion, along with special Rhinegeist merch.</p>
<p>The sportsbook operator was very excited about the new partnership and the prospects it brings.</p>
<p>This exhilarating new collaboration with Rhinegeist will allow our Ohio team to transform the gameday experience and harness the unwavering allegiance of the Cincinnati sports fan base. David Paschkes, chief commercial officer, Tipico</p>
<p>According to the press release, Tipico will be sponsoring a variety of gameday events this year, mentioning Super Bowl Sunday, MLB Opening Day, the Kentucky Derby, and NCAA March Madness. The partnership aims to improve the operator’s brand recognition within the local communities and attract people to the Tipico app.</p>
<p>Ohio Launched Sports Betting Recently</p>
<p>Tipico has been preparing for this for some time. As the state was slowly nearing the legalization of sports betting, the operator started working on getting mindshare and brand recognition. It launched a free-to-play (F2P) game back in November 2022, and it was named an exclusive sponsor of AEG Presents as part of a marketing deal.</p>
<p>Of course, all of the operator’s advancements were focused around the launch of sports betting in Ohio, which was officialized at 12:01 AM on New Year’s Day 2023. The event was accompanied by multiple launch parties, and the market’s response was very strong. GeoComply’s data showed that Ohio beat New York’s launch, scoring a total of 11.3 million geolocation transactions.</p>
<p>That was almost a full two million more geolocation transactions than New York, which scored around 9.3 million transactions, and leads New Jersey and Pennsylvania, which were recorded at 6.7 million and 8.2 million transactions respectively. This leads some to speculate that the Buckeye State has a very bright sports betting future ahead of it.</p>
<p>Tipico hasn’t been focused solely on Ohio, of course, and the year has seen it get busy right from the get-go. Just days after the Ohio launch, Tipico also set foot in Iowa. The operator’s sportsbook was approved by the Iowa Racing and Gaming Commission, marking its fourth entry into the US market. Now the operator is active in Iowa, Ohio, New Jersey, and Colorado.</p>
