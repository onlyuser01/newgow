<p>Simplebet and Hard Rock Sportsbook have forged an alliance that will see the former company roll out its micro-betting product on the latter’s platform, offering sports fans a new way to engage with sports and wager by exploring an entirely new vertical.</p>
<p>The product covers popular sports, such as baseball, basketball, American football, college football, and college basketball, and it will be available in states where Hard Rock and Simplebet have been licensed to offer sports betting to their audiences.</p>
<p>Commenting on this new opportunity, Hard Rock Digital President Matt Primeaux said that the company is committed to bringing players the best possible product and that the arrival of play-by-play bets on a variety of popular and loved sports will only contribute to that.</p>
<p>"Simplebet’s markets are perfect for sports fans that don’t have time for a full game and casino players that enjoy the thrill of quick-resolution games like slots, roulette, and blackjack," Primeaux said cited by SBC Americas.</p>
<p>Simplebet’s CEO, Chris Bevilacqua was similarly optimistic about what the future of this collaboration may bring for both parties. He hailed Hard Rock Digital’s standard as a global heavyweight in interactive content and immersive digital betting experiences.</p>
<p>"We’re confident that our product offering will elevate in-play sports wagering for their customers and look forward to working closely together," Bevilacqua concluded. Simplebet is hardly the only company focusing on micro-betting and making strides in the market in the United States.</p>
<p>Recently, Betr, a company owned by Jake Paul and Joey Levy, and not to be confused with the Australian homonymous entity by the same name, started offering micro-betting products in Ohio. Betr is also looking to expand in Massachusetts, another important state for the company.</p>
<p>Micro-betting has appealed to American consumers who have been discovering regulated sports betting fast since the activity was liberalized in 2018. Since then, many companies have thrown their hats in the ring, hoping to become the go-to option for the millions of consumers placing a bet on the outcome of the Super Bowl or NBA Playoffs.</p>
<p>Simplebet is now doing the same with the help of Hard Rock which is equally zealous about securing a prominent place in the evolving and dynamic sports betting market in North America and beyond.</p>
