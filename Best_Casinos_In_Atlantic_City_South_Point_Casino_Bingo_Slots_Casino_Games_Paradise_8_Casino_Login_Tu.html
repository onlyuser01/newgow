<p>Play’n GO has further strengthened its presence in the North American market, with the company expanding in Connecticut through a newly-granted supplier license. This means that thanks to this latest recognition, Play’n GO now adds Connecticut to a number of other prominent iGaming markets, such as Michigan, New Jersey and West Virginia, in all of which the supplier can provide its premium slot games.</p>
<p>This is a tremendous boost to the company’s presence in North America, after Play’n GO secured a supplier license in Ontario, Canada in 2022, and is determined to maintain its momentum in the region no matter what. Book of Dead is already performing as one of the top games in the entire region, Play’n GO said in a press statement.</p>
<p>The news was welcomed by Play’n GO Chief Commercial Officer Magnus Olsson who was very happy with these developments and remarked that expanding in the regulated iGaming market in the United States has been a priority for the company.</p>
<p>This sentiment was also confirmed last year when Casino Guru News spoke with Play’n Go Stuart Trigwell who said that the United States iGaming market was the next priority for the supplier. It’s fantastic to be able to add Connecticut as the latest market as the company expands into the United States.</p>
<p>"Online gaming operators in the US are increasingly looking at retention strategies to mitigate against costly acquisition – especially in expensive media markets like the New Jersey, New York and Connecticut tri-state area," Olsson added.</p>
<p>However, the United States is not the only place where Play’n GO intends to excel, says Olsson. The company wants to be the best supplier in every regulated market where it operates around the world. The company is now on track to release 50 new online slots this year and it is very happy to have been able to break ground in some of the most significant jurisdictions in North America, bringing the global number of such jurisdictions to 25.</p>
<p>Play’n GO has also been strengthening its position back in Europe. The company announced that it launched with SKS365, which operates the Planetwin365 brand. The supplier similarly rolled out its content product in the United Kingdom with 32Red in January.</p>
