<p>Dynamic game provider that converts gambling into gaming BGaming has launched the much-anticipated sequel to its beloved Lucky Lady Moon slot, Lucky Lady Moon Megaways.

<p>More Excellent Features in the New Slot</p>
<p>BGaming’s marketing product lead Kate Puteiko explained the new release through the company’s intention to cater to the needs of two categories of players: those who want more game versatility and added mechanics and those who enjoy sticking to original titles. The fresh slot is therefore a successful mix of old and new, prone to attract both newcomers and players who are already used to the exciting game. Pteiko believes this synergy can “increase players’ engagement and provide a new way of entertainment.”</p>
<p>Compared to the original game, the sequel comes with even more spectacular mechanics and features. It also carries the initial mystical theme while adding brighter elements to it, making the game more appealing and fun to play. The game’s main character is the same mesmerizing lady hidden behind the captivating moon image, luring players in and inviting them to try their luck next to her. The design is backed by a charming soundtrack.</p>
<p>Free Spins, Wheel of fortune &amp; Refill Features</p>
<p>The game is packed with Free Spins and thrilling multipliers ranging from x2 to x25 multipliers, determined by the Wheel of Fortune. The slot also has Scatters, a special Refilling feature, and Wilds featuring x2 multipliers. The Buy Chance and the Buy Bonus features bring players more chances to scoop up the big wins or land the bonus round on the spot.</p>
<p>To reach the Free Spins bonus round, players must land at least three scatters on the reels. It is also possible to win side prizes ranging from 5x to 50x the original bet, depending on the number of scatters hitting. At the start of the bonus round, players will watch a Wheel of Fortune spinning and bringing the 5 to 15 free spins along with a win multiplier between x2 and x25. The same feature can be retrigged when a minimum of three scatters reach the reels during a free spin.</p>
<p>At the beginning of June, BGaming announced it expanded its footprint in Europe through its launch via Platincasino. Next month, the company is expected to release a squeal to Wild Cash with an added x9990 max win.</p>
