    <h1>Downstream Hotel And Casino Everygame Casino Red Harrah S Las Vegas Hotel And Casino Bally S Lake Ta</h1>

<p>Announced Wednesday, the new deal will see DraftKings deliver Gamres’ Positive Play Scale for a number of its US customers. The Positive Play Scale is the first-of-its-kind standardized scale that can measure RG behaviors and beliefs among online customers. This collaboration further boosts DraftKings’ RG plan and efforts toward safer gambling.</p>
<p>The Scale itself was developed by Gamres’ experienced experts and researchers including Dr. Richard Wood, Dr. Michael Wohl, and Dr. Nassim Tabri. The unique tool encourages positive play while at the same time seeking to understand the players better.</p>
<p>The scale asks players questions related to beliefs such as gaming literacy, honesty and control, pre-commitment and personal responsibility. Ultimately, the Positive Play Scale seeks to measure the behavior and responsible gaming knowledge the players demonstrate and gain invaluable insight into their beliefs.</p>
<p>Through the collaboration with DraftKings, Gamres will produce and deliver an online survey for a sample of US-based DraftKings players using the Scale. Upon completion of the probe, the consulting and research organization will analyze the results and “provide a baseline measure of Positive Play at DraftKings.” At the same time, the process is expected to flag differences in player groups and provide insight into how DraftKings can improve its RG practices.</p>
<p>The Collaboration Expected to Benefit DraftKings’ RG Strategy</p>
<p>Dr Richard Wood said that Gamres is delighted to join forces with DraftKings and contribute toward positive play. “Most players just play for fun and to be entertained, but we have found that some players (generally) have misperceptions about gaming that can either diminish their enjoyment or in some cases lead to them spending more than they intended,” he added. Dr Wood added that the collaboration is expected to boost DraftKings’ RG efforts and help “identify those areas that would benefit from the most support.” Finally, he said that the survey and analysis are expected to help the operator create a proactive RG approach that allows players to engage with gaming activities positively.</p>
<p>“We’re grateful for this opportunity to team up with Gamres, which is renowned for its strategic consulting and research around the world, to bring the Positive Play Scale tool to DraftKings.“ Chrissy Thurmond, senior director of responsible gaming at DraftKings</p>
<p>Chrissy Thurmond, DraftKings’s senior director of responsible gaming, added that the company is excited to join forces with the leading research and consulting firm Gamres for the new tool. Finally, she explained that the collaboration is expected to significantly enhance DraftKings’ RG program and help the operator better understand its players.</p>
