<p>It‚Äôs a Messi Situation in Argentina</p>
<p>Remove Lionel Messi from the Argentina national soccer team and this becomes a mediocre squad. In 2022, La Albiceleste really are a one-man army. Without Messi, their World Cup journey would‚Äôve ended a long time ago.</p>
<p>However, with the soccer GOAT putting on superb performances over and over again in Qatar, Argentina got themselves into the final of the World Cup. Their captain really has been their crucial player. Not only is he their top scorer, but he‚Äôs also the man with the most assists, as well as the player who‚Äôs created the most goal chances. In fact, Messi was directly responsible for eight of the 12 goals they‚Äôve scored so far in Qatar.</p>

<p>But what happens if France manage to tame him? In that case, Argentina are in trouble. Apart from Saudi Arabia in Round 1, no one was able to stop him in this tournament. The explanation for this, however, might lie in the fact that Argentina were very lucky on their road to the Final.</p>
<p>The 2022 World Cup Final will be the first time they‚Äôre taking on a team that was among the Top 6 trophy favorites before the start of the tournament. In fact, the Netherlands is the only team from the pre-tournament top 10 list of favorites that Argentina have played so far. The Dutch came to Qatar with the odds of +1300. In comparison, France was priced at +550.</p>
<p>France are the Most Impressive Team of the 2022 World Cup</p>
<p>The French national soccer team came to Qatar without six of their key men. Among those are two midfielders ‚Äì Paul Pogba and N‚ÄôGolo Kante ‚Äì who were instrumental in their World Cup win four years ago. Plus, the best striker on the planet ‚Äì Karim Benzema ‚Äì picked up an injury just before the start of the 2022 tournament.</p>
<p>All of that made pundits doubt France‚Äôs chances in Qatar, but these guys proved everyone wrong. The French have been brilliant so far, defeating some real heavyweights so far, including Denmark (in the group) and England (in the quarterfinal).</p>
<p>Kylian Mbappe has been their top player with five goals and two assists, but his teammates aren‚Äôt trailing much behind. Antoine Griezmann, for example, hasn‚Äôt scored any goals but he‚Äôs recorded three assists so far. It‚Äôs a similar story when it comes to Ousmane Dembele who‚Äôs got two assists to his name.</p>
<p>Then, there‚Äôs Olivier Giroud, who‚Äôs France‚Äôs second-top scorer with four goals. The towering striker is fantastic in the air, which could prove crucial against Argentina. It‚Äôs just that their defenders are much, much shorter than him.</p>
<p>Argentina vs France Prediction</p>
<p>Even the greatest player in the history of the game cannot win every single match on his own. Especially not when playing against reigning World Cup champions. That said, we expect to see France win the 2022 Final relatively easily.</p>
<p>Pick: France to win in normal time</p>
