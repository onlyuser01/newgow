<p>Mayan Stackways review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Mayan Stackways is a Mayan-themed slot from Hacksaw Gaming.</p>
<p>The slot explores the darker side of Mayan culture, with Hacksaw Gaming putting a sinister spin on a well-worn genre.</p>

<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>Hacksaw Gaming is one of the most creative developers on the market, and even though the Mayan genre is extremely saturated, the developer has managed to make it feel fresh.</p>
<p>As it did with the Hands of Anubis slot, the game manages to take a theme that is quite bright and colourful and gives it a sinister twist. The reels themselves are built on a stone stand in the middle of the jungle, and the symbols feature typical Mayan imagery.</p>
<p>So far, so normal. The game’s eerie atmosphere is created by adding some sort of stone zombie/skeleton that stands on the side of the reels. His dark presence and glowing red eyes make the slot instantly stand out from other Mayan games.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>On the face of it, Mayan Stackways looks fairly basic. It has five reels, each with four symbols. The slot uses a pay-anyway system, though, and when combined with some of the bonus features, this can allow for up to 100,000 ways to win.</p>
<p>A control panel under the grid has everything you need to get the reels spinning. A bonus buy option is available in some territories.</p>

<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>As the slot's name might suggest, Stackways is the key feature here. This is an innovative feature from Hacksaw Gaming that can be triggered on any spin. When a Stackways symbol lands, it will display a number between two and ten. If it can create a winning combination, it will then stack that number of symbols on the reel.</p>
<p>Next up are the Stack Spins. These are triggered when you land three Skull Scatter symbols. Players are given 10 Stack Spins. During these, there is an increased chance of Stackway symbols hitting the reels. If you land a Reel Activator, it will guarantee a Stackways symbol will land on that reel for the rest of the round.</p>
<p>Main feature of the game, the Stackways feature</p>
<p>If you land four Skull Scatters, you will trigger the Mayan Gold Bonus. During this round, you will want to collect Coin symbols and store their value above the reels. When a reel gets stacked, it will lock. However, if you land the Collector symbol, it will collect the value of all coins on the reels and unlock the reels, continuing the round. The round ends when all of the reels are unlocked. Prizes and then added up and paid out.</p>
<p>Landing five Skull Scatters triggers the Mayan Gold feature with a value of 50 already above the reels. This is called the Golden Opportunity.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>In our slot strategy guide, we recommend looking for slots with an above-average RTP. Mayan Stackways falls into this category, with an RTP of 96.23%. The game is considered highly volatile by Hacksaw Gaming, which is another bonus.</p>
<p>The slot can serve up a maximum win of 10,000x your stake. The minimum wager is $0.10, and the maximum is $100.</p>
<p>Paytable for the Mayan Stackways slot machine</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Mayan Stackways is Hacksaw Gaming doing what it does best. It takes a popular genre and manages to find an entirely new twist to put on it. The Stackways feature feels fresh, and the game design is memorable. When you combine this with an above-average RTP and high volatility, you’ve got a winning combination.</p>
