<p>Live slot streaming company LiveSpins has recently unveiled Michael Pedersen as its chief commercial officer. Pedersen is the former director of acquisition at PokerStars and an ex-employee at NetEnt.</p>
<p>Pedersen’s main job at LiveSpins will be to supervise the company’s commercial strategy and help improve its marketing, sales, and account management approaches. He will also be the go-to spokesperson for the brand during press conferences and important media events.</p>
<p>Pedersen Has an Impressive Resume</p>
<p>LiveSpins’s new CCO also co-founded iGaming Next, a business that handles the organization of events, conferences, and content business, as well as LetsBet, a premium online casino operator focused on gamification live streaming, and special features.</p>
<p>Pedersen also worked at NetEnt for four lucrative years. He started as a marketing manager and eventually landed a position as a regional business manager representing the Nordic countries.

<p>During his time at Flutter’s PokerStars and NetEnt, Pedersen managed to put his excellent commercial leadership skills to good work, generating both brands’ continuous and global growth.</p>
<p>His Leicester University MBA and Stanford executive programs part of his resume, combined with his 14 years of experience working in the gambling industry, are all expected to add value to LiveSpins. Pedersen himself said the company is one of the most innovative online gaming brands, expressing his delight to receive the opportunity to bring his experience to the table.</p>
<p>Social Casino Experiences Are Important, Says Pedersen</p>
<p>Pedersen called himself an early supporter of the idea of social casino experiences. He believes LiveSpins has done an excellent job at learning the secret of social gaming and developing a brand-new casino alternative that can keep up with the trends.</p>
<p>LiveSpins was officially launched in early 2021 at the iGamingNext: Valletta conference. It is a platform that enables casino players to stream their slot gameplay for viewers interested in watching them and placing bets behind their play.</p>
<p>According to the company’s co-founder Robin Reed, LiveSpins’s main goal is to offer socially-charged options to the iGaming space while creating updated, relevant, and appealing products. Thanks to its one-of-a-kind mix of social engagement and live gaming, the company has already created a huge buzz among operators, providers, and live streamers. LiveSpins plans to expand its operations in 2022, and Pedersen is expected to help the company grow faster.</p>
