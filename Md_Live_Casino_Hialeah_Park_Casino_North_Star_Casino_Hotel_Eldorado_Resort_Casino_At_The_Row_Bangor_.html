<p>Sportradar, a company that offers leading sports technology, announced the release of an Athlete Wellbeing educational video.

<p>The new educational video that seeks to help raise awareness of the impact of sports betting.

What's more, the video reaffirms "Sportradar's commitment to providing solutions and supporting stakeholders within the growing sports betting ecosystem," the company explained in a statement.</p>
<p>The company acknowledged that sports betting can be a form of entertainment for many people. However, Sportradar said that the activity can have a significant impact on the mental health and well-being of professional athletes. This is one of the prime reasons why the company offers an education that includes data about the potential impact of sports betting on athletes.</p>

<p>The recently released educational video includes mental health and responsible gambling experts that are partners of the company's Athlete Wellbeing program. Additionally, the video features the professional basketball player Garrett Whitlock and Lindsay Tarpley Snow, a former professional soccer player and a two-time gold medalist. What's more, the video includes Connor McCaffery, currently a college basketball player. Each of the participants in the new educational video shares their story about the impact of wagering.</p>
<p>Besides the free educational video, Sportradar revealed that it offers additional services and products as a part of its Athlete Wellbeing program. Those include workshops, training via in-depth digital platforms as well as consultancy services.</p>
<p>Seeking to ensure the success of its program, Sportradar leverages engaging training elements and backs its educational materials with case studies. Ultimately, those services and solutions seek to help the athletes and ensure their well-being.</p>
<p>The news about the new educational video comes after earlier this month, Sportradar expanded its US-facing presence via a license in Ohio. Early in December, the company revealed it was awarded a license from the Ohio Casino Control Commission, the gambling regulator in the state.</p>
