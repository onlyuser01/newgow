<p>ATTENTION !! RIPPING BY UNIBET !!! 30 EUROS NOT RECEIVED FROM THE PROMOTION X WHICH I HAVE DEPOSITED !!!! I HAVE DEPOSED ON DAY 13 OF LAST MONTH WHEN THERE WERE THE PROMOTIONS INCLUDING THE ONE THAT IF I DEPOSITED I HAD TO RECEIVE 100% OF THE DEPOSIT !! I DEPOSITED AND DID NOT RECEIVE ANYTHING IN THAT DAY. I CHECKED SEVERAL TIMES IN THE SAME DAY AND STILL HAD NOT RECEIVED THEM. ON DAY 14 WHEN I LOOK ON THE SITE IT WAS WRITTEN THAT THE PROMOTIONS WERE NO LONGER VALID AND THEN AT THAT POINT I TRIED TO SPEAK WITH THE ASSISTANCE WHO TELLS ME THAT THEY RESERVE THE RIGHT TO WITHDRAW THE PROMOTION AND THINGS OF THE KIND. WHEN I DEPOSITED ON THE DAY 13 SEPTEMBER THE PROMOTIONS WERE VALID AND FROM THE DAY 14/9 THEY HAVE WRITTEN THAT THE PROMOTIONS WERE NOT VALID. IN OTHER WORDS AND AS IF THEY SELL ME A PRODUCT BUT AFTER I PAID I NEVER RECEIVED THAT PRODUCT X THE ONE I DEPOSITED (IN THIS CASE THE 30 EUROS IS THAT IS THE 100% OF THE DEPOSIT MADE BY ME) FRAGATURA !!! I ALSO HAD PROBLEMS WITH THE GAMES WHEN I PICKED THE BONUS ALWAYS BLOCKED AND MADE ME OUT OF THE GAME FOR ERRORS !! SORRY I DON'T HAVE MORE SCREENSHOTS TO LET YOU SEE EVERYTHING !!! I ALWAYS GET OUT THE WRITING OF AN ERROR EVERY TIME I TAKEN THE BONUS AND MADE ME OUT AND IT WAS WRITTEN TO RELOAD THE PAGE AND TRY AGAIN. AND I WAS NO LONGER TO ENTER THAT GAME IN MY CASE WHICH WAS BOOK OF RA DELUXE FOR ABOUT 5 MINUTES AND IN THE MEANWAY I WAS GOING TO PLAY OTHER GAMES AND TRYING IN THE BOOK OF RA AFTER A FEW MINUTES. YOU CAN CHECK WHY THERE SHOULD BE EVERYTHING ON MY ACCOUNT IF THEY DON'T START DELETING THEM!</p>
