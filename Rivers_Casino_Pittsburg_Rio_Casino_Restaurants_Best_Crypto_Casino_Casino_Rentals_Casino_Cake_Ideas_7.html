<p>The leading provider and developer of content for the growing online gambling industry, 7777 gaming, announced a major achievement for the regulated market in Romania. The company confirmed Monday that 50 of its casino games achieved certification in the country.</p>
<p>Thanks to the certification, the company expanded further its presence not only in Romania but in Europe as well. Upon announcing that its games are now certified, the company acknowledged this represents "another milestone for the entire team at 7777 gaming."</p>
<p>According to a statement released by 7777 gaming, the games that secured certification in Romania are some of its top-performing titles. At the same time, the company acknowledged that it plans to seize new growth opportunities with brands by delivering its online casino content which is engaging and can be personalized.</p>
<p>Elena Shaterova, 7777 gaming's CCO, shared her excitement about the recent announcement saying: "Having in mind the maturity of the Romanian market with its over 35 strong online gambling brands, it's exciting for the team to deliver our unique and innovative games on the market." Moreover, she pointed out that the company currently has active deals with some of the biggest brands within the vertical in the country.</p>
<p>"Besides, our certified games are already integrated with the leading casino aggregators in Romania, such as IGT PlayDigital and EveryMatrix, which provide content to the most popular Romanian online operators," explained Shaterova. In conclusion, 7777 gaming's CCO said that the company acknowledges the competitiveness of the market but at the same time wants to stand out by delivering engaging content that can be easily adapted for the needs of different operators.</p>
<p>The recent announcement comes after 7777 gaming unveiled a package of new games during one of the most-anticipated gambling industry events, ICE London. At the time, the company announced four online casino concepts that include instant win, exclusive, slots and contemporary games. The leading developer of iGaming content explained that each of the aforementioned concepts is expected to help attract and retain different audiences.</p>
<p>The announcement about the licensing in Romania comes after 7777 gaming expanded further its reach via a collaboration with the leading B2B iGaming software and platform provider, EveryMatrix. Late last month, content from the company was added to EveryMatrix's aggregation platform called CasinoEngine.</p>
<p>Before that, again in February, 7777 gaming inked a deal with IGT PlayDigital. The collaboration saw the provider of games expand further its global presence.</p>
