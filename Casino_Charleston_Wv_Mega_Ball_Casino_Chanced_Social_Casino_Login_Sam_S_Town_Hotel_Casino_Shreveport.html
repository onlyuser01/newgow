<p>PLANET 7 OZ CASINO ,</p>
<p>So on august 29th 2019 i won $2500.00 off of my daily 14 free spins (so no bonuses involved ) ..</p>
<p>So i selected to withdraw my winnings ..Did everything that was asked of me , sent my drivers licence , my bankcard i used on the acc , a utility bill in my name and also all my bankwire information ..</p>
<p>I waited the 10-14 business days like they said ... Then after this time was up , they said thatt its was all approved but now the finance department would hold for another 7-10 business days before they would release my funds to me .. So again i waited ..</p>
<p>Checked in a couple times to see how it was progressing , a few ppl i spoke to and ( i have screenshots of these conversations from PLANET 7 OZ ..Every time i asked they said have i sent my bankwire details. Yes i said on 29th august , 1st september , 3rd of september and 11th september ..</p>
<p>Ive gave it some more time and then i went to log on to my account only to notice my account had been blocked and they couldnt give me a reason why so ended my chat instantly ..</p>
<p>I just want my money i won fair and square , no bonuses invovled ..</p>
<p>About 31st september i'd had enough so emailed planet 7 oz and had ASH FROM FINANCE DEPARTMENT reply to me promptly within 24hrs , said a couple of things were wrong on my bankwire details so he underlined in red the ones to fix .. They had put a complete different bank acc no in but with my bsb no and said my swift code didnt match and my bank acc name was wrong !!</p>
<p>They put some other acc no in so course it didnt match my account name or swift code cause it belongs to another bank ..</p>
<p>Im so over this ..now im being ignored completely for nearly 3 weeks now .. Its coming up to 2 months since i withdrew my winnings .. I really need my money .. Please can someone help me to get them to pay me ..</p>
<p>Devastated</p>
