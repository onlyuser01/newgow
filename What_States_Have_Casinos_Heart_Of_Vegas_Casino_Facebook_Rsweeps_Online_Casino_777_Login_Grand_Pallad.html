    <h1>What States Have Casinos Heart Of Vegas Casino Facebook Rsweeps Online Casino 777 Login Grand Pallad</h1>

<p>Dear StonedTwat,</p>
<p>Although something was already mentioned in my previous posts, I would like to provide you with a detailed explanation of the whole situation and inform you about our final decision.</p>
<p>"Blockchain experts" - we are talking about third party blockchain forensics vendors (for example "Chainalysis"), we can consider it benefit provided by the casino. The casino's license does not require any automatically performed verifications and/or controls upon registration, nor upon a deposit or after it was made. The casino verifies the players when the first withdrawal request is made. This is really common and within the casino's Terms and Conditions and it also meets the licensor's requirements. Chainalysis's explanation also says the accounts/payments are reviewed for signs of fraud or suspicious behaviour. If there was nothing suspicious, the casino did not have any reason to perform further investigation. Although you claimed you did not hide your deposits and crypto wallet IDs, players can have as many wallets as they want.</p>
<p>The account "StonedTwat" was banned, not self-excluded. The account "dumbmotherf" was closed due to gambling addiction signs that were identified by the casino during your conversations with the casino's Customer Support (CS). I cannot see anywhere that you would inform the CS about your gambling addiction or asked the CS to be self-excluded. Moreover, you were aware of the absence of the UK option in the registration form and that it is strictly forbidden to play from this country - this was already breached by the "StonedTwat" account.</p>
<p>Information about the UK version of the casino - I saw a part of the conversation, where you (as "StonedTwat") asked them when the casino becomes available in the UK, and whether you would have access to this account then. So, it is clear you already knew about the restriction at that time.</p>
<p>Asking for "a loan" - is nothing special, it is a common situation and players ask for these things very often, especially after higher lost funds amounts. Players usually ask CS for giving free spins, bonuses, free money, or cashback, a loan is not an exception. Players try their luck and try to ask casinos about different things. There are many "highrollers" and in case of a higher lost amount, it is hard for the casino to identify a problem. It does not have to mean a problem automatically.</p>
<p>Responsible Gambling and tools - the casino is not obliged to inform each player separately about its RG policy and available tools. All information is freely available to all players in the relevant section on the casino website. All players can read about it and all players can turn to the casino's CS if anything is not clear, possibly activate any RG tool.</p>
<p>Reference to the conversation with "Ishaan" who allegedly should have advised you how you can continue playing in Stake Casino despite the ban - you have not provided us with any evidence of this conversation until now. Instead, you provided me with the video of the same conversation with CS, where the CS's representative recommends you contact a VIP host to see possible options. This does not mean at all that anyone recommended you breach the casino's Terms and Conditions.</p>
<p>You did not know that the use of a VPN is prohibited - it does not mean you can use it. Each player is obliged to read the Terms and Conditions before accepting them during registration. The importance of this rule is the same as filling in the registration form with your real and true personal data or using only 1 casino account per player. Those are strictly applied rules within the industry standard. All these rules were breached. You knew this before you register as "dumbmotherf", and you knowingly violated them.</p>
<p>By bypassing the casino's system controls and restrictions you were able to register a new account and play there, which gave you a certain unfair advantage. Not to mention that you had already violated the casino rules with the previous account in the same way. You lost your money legitimately, as any other player. It is not appropriate to flaunt the casino rules after you knowingly violated them so you can play in the casino and lost - that is not how it works at all. In addition, none of your accounts has been verified. It has been made impossible by you, so the casino does not know your identity.</p>
<p>As for the mentioned streamers - if you know about the players using VPN and/or you are sure about cases when the casino's Terms and Conditions were breached and the casino is not aware of it, I recommend you to contact the casino's CS as soon as possible and provide them with details. If anyone is breaching the casino rules and the casino has not discovered it yet, it does not mean you are entitled to do it, too. This is just an example - If I know a person who stole something in a store and no one noticed it, it does not mean it is alright. I sincerely hope this analogy is clear.</p>
