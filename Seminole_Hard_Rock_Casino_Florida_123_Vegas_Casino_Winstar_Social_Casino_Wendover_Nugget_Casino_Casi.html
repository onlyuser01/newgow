<p>A group of eight friends was pleasantly surprised that they secured the second-biggest prize in Western Australia since the start of the year</p>
<p>Oz Lotto, a popular lottery games provider, has seen its jackpot grow gradually. It was all going well, until a single winning ticket hit the jackpot, winning the entire AU$30 million ($20 million) grand prize in an instant. The jackpot dropped on Tuesday’s Oz Lotto draw.</p>
<p>The winning numbers of the draw were 9, 12, 15, 19, 21, 46 and 47, as well as supplementary numbers 16, 30 and 34. The unique combination of numbers and the jackpot represented the largest prize won by the game for the year. Yet, this wasn’t the biggest lottery win for 2023, considering that back in March, a lucky winner secured a staggering $40 million Powerball jackpot.</p>
<p>“We’re absolutely thrilled to welcome yet another big win for WA, only a few weeks after celebrating a Swan Valley family taking home $40 million in Powerball.“ Ralph Addis, CEO of Lotterywest</p>
<p>Ralph Addis, Lotterywest’s CEO, shared his excitement saying that the lottery is delighted to see another jackpot prize drop in West Australia. He acknowledged that the $20 million lottery win dropped after only recently, a family from Swan Valley took home $40 million from the Powerball. Last but not least, Addis pointed out: “The WA community is also a winner following tonight’s draw, with more than $1.27 million raised thanks to players over the five-week jackpot roll which will contribute to our grants program.”</p>
<p>Eight Friends to Share the Jackpot</p>
<p>Many wondered who was the lucky winner that hit the $20 million prize. Well, in some cases, that’s more than one person and this is precisely what happened during the recent Oz Lotto draw. According to a report by 7news, the winning ticket with the recent jackpot didn’t belong to a single person, but a whole group of friends.</p>
<p>The people, described as golf buddies, played the lottery together. Little did they know that Tuesday would change their lives, forever. Overall, eight people from the group would be subject to a part of the $20 million jackpot.</p>
<p>Reportedly, the group of friends are in their 40s and one of them realized he held the winning ticket while having dinner with his wife. He then quickly contacted the others to notify them, but some didn’t even believe it at first.</p>
<p>Given that it is a single ticket, it is unclear whether the group of friends has established rules for how the prize would be split. But keeping in mind the size of the price, that likely won’t be a problem.</p>
