    <h1>Four Queens Casino Fremont Street Las Vegas Nv Winning Casino Hertel Casino Casino Cincinnati Ohio C</h1>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I deleted my old account from mystake casino. The request was granted and the account was closed.</p>
<p>reason I closed was I didn’t want to gamble anymore. Decided to have another try and reopened.</p>
<p>I created a new account where I deposited £382 over 4 days but when I try to withdraw £400 won after the due verifications of the documents it tells me that I cannot because the account is a duplicate.</p>
<p>Its a new account and I just want to get my money back!</p>
<p>i closed the account so didn’t think it was classed as a duplicate.</p>
<p>I didn’t use any bonus activations</p>
<p>i used a different email but all other details where identical.</p>
<p>not bothered about the money I won. All I want is the money I deposited.</p>
<p>I'm new to casino gambling. I explained this is an honest mistake. Asked for all deposited money back but only been offered £100 which was my last deposit?</p>
<p>Can you help?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>
