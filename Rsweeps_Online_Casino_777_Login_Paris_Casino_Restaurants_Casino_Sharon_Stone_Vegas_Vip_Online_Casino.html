    <h1>Rsweeps Online Casino 777 Login Paris Casino Restaurants Casino Sharon Stone Vegas Vip Online Casino</h1>

<p>First off, I deposited with the bonus that was displayed there: 100%+50fs. I initally received nothing, then it turns out the bonus was a casino error and they only gave me the 50fs. This is quite outrageous, but I guess I have to accept it. After all, mistakes can happen. I then played the 50fs and won 73€ and a few cents with them, which was immediately added to my balance.</p>
<p>I then left the slot to open a new game and noticed that only my deposited amount of 2€ was still visible. My entire balance of 73.xx€, which I won in the 50 free spins, was simply gone. There was no sign of it under active bonuses or in the game history either. I contacted support again, now I'm supposed to play the 50fs again. But the odds of winning as much as 5€ is highly unlikely, let alone approximating a win of another 73€, which they are fully aware of.</p>
<p>So, you'll have to excuse me, but I would like my 73 euro back that have disappeared from my account or at least free spins equivalent to the value of 73€.</p>
<p>This is bordering on theft. I would have least expected something like this from a reputable German casino.</p>
