<p>Toronto Raptors Betting Favorites to Close Out Warriors in NBA Finals</p>

<p>The Toronto Raptors are heavy betting favorites for tonight’s Game 5 of the NBA Finals against the Golden State Warriors, as the team that’s up 3-1 is expected to close out the championship series.</p>

<p>After opening its Game 5 odds with the home team Raptors spotting the two-time defending champs 3.5 points, the line at the Westgate SuperBook has since shrunk. News of Kevin Durant practicing shortened the point spread to just 1.5 points as of Monday morning. The over/under for total points scored is at 214.5.</p>
<p>As for the series price, Toronto needs just one more win to clinch the franchise’s first NBA title. The Raptors are strong favorites to get the job done, with the SuperBook price at -550 (implied odds 84.62 percent). A $100 bet on those odds nets just $18.18.</p>
<p>We’ve won three games. It’s the first to four,” Raptors guard Kyle Lowry said. “We understand that they’re the defending champs and they’re not going to go out easy.”</p>
<p>Game 5 tipoff is scheduled for 9:00 pm ET.</p>
<p>Betting History</p>
<p>Last offseason shook up the NBA. LeBron James departed Cleveland for Los Angeles, and the Lakers naturally became a Finals frontrunner.</p>
<p>James had participated in the previous eight NBA Finals before moving to Los Angeles. Sportsbooks across Las Vegas said the Lakers had garnered the most title bets. They were all victories for the house, as LeBron and Co. failed to even reach the playoffs.</p>
<p>Last fall, the Warriors were at -325 to win their third consecutive NBA Finals. A $100 bet would net just $30.77 should Golden State find a way to win three straight games.</p>
<p>After LeBron, the biggest shakeup last offseason was the dismantling of the Toronto Raptors. Face of the franchise DeMar DeRozan was traded in favor of bringing in then-San Antonio Spurs disgruntled superstar Kawhi Leonard.</p>
<p>There wasn’t much optimism for the team up north. Las Vegas books had Toronto around 14/1 to win the Larry O’Brien Trophy prior to the regular season tipping off. A win tonight pays all those ticket slips $1,400 for every $100 wagered.</p>
<p>KD Update</p>
<p>The Warriors have of course been understaffed during this year’s Finals. Kevin Durant has missed all four games with a right calf injury, and sharpshooter Klay Thompson missed Game 3 due to a hamstring.</p>
<p>Durant will be a game-time decision tonight. He’s listed as questionable.</p>
<p>He’s going to practice with us today,” Warriors coach Steve Kerr explained. “And he’ll get some extra work in with some of our younger players. We’ll gauge it from there.”</p>
<p>“The hardest part about being an athlete is going through injuries,” Thompson added. “Especially when your team is playing for a championship. It sucks. I feel for Kevin.”</p>
<p>The Warriors fanbase does, too. They’re accustomed to seeing their team win – not lose. The dynasty could be dethroned tonight in Toronto at the Scotiabank Arena, where rapper Drake will certainly be courtside cheering on his home squad.</p>
