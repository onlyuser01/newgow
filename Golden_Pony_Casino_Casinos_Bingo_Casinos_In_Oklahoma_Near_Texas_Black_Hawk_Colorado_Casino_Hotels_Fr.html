<p>Bragg Gaming Group has deployed its full content library with BetMGM in New Jersey, strengthened by the company’s proprietary Remote Game Server to guarantee the best experiences to local players.</p>
<p>Apart from Bragg’s own content, the company is also rolling out content through its dedicated studio, Atomic Slab Lab, which will also add to BetMGM’s offer in New Jersey. Bragg is known for a dedicated and committed approach to the iGaming industry, creating worthwhile gaming experiences that stand out by virtue of their design, original theme, sound math, and captivating features.</p>
<p>More content will be rolling out, including solutions by the company’s proprietary game studios and partner studios through the Powered by Bragg platform, which will significantly strengthen BetMGM’s content library. The RGS technology will ensure that players in the Garden State can connect and access the content at their own leisure and without any traction.</p>
<p>Bragg has been steadily building upon its footprint in the North American market, with a particularly strong focus on New Jersey and the United States as a whole. BetMGM has been a reliable and trusted partner, too, as the companies have already collaborated in other iGaming states in the country, including Pennsylvania and Michigan.</p>
<p>Bragg Gaming Group COO, Americas, Kunal Mishra, has welcomed this opportunity and said that Bragg has been steadily building in the North American market as one of its priorities. These partnerships have involved the company’s own content products as well as third-party content provided by the company’s aggregation solution.</p>
<p>"The new launch with BetMGM extends our successful execution of this strategy, which we expect will help drive consistent, long-term growth. We are pleased to now provide their New Jersey players with our high-quality, engaging content," Mishra added.</p>
<p>Bragg Gaming has not limited its expansion efforts to just a single brand, however, as the company has been steadily pushing to expand well beyond that with similar alliances in New Jersey and Michigan with Caesars Palace Online Casino. The company launched its slot game, Lady Luck Casino Egyptian Magic, with Caesars in September.</p>
<p>At the same time, Bragg has also teamed up with Internet Vikings to strengthen its technical capabilities and ensure that it has access to dedicated hosting services that allow it to deploy its games without traction.</p>
