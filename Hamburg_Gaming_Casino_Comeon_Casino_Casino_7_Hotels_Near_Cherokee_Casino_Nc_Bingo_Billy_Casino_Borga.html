    <h1>Hamburg Gaming Casino Comeon Casino Casino 7 Hotels Near Cherokee Casino Nc Bingo Billy Casino Borga</h1>

<p>The Water Club Hotel, the hospitality venue adjacent to Borgata in Atlantic City, will be getting a new name</p>
<p>This is part of the renovation plan that MGM Resorts International has put forward, announcing a $55-million revamping of the property. The company is doubling down on its brand name by renaming the hotel to MGM Tower and focusing the limelight on the MGM image and likeness.</p>
<p>Borgata Rebrands Water Club Hotel to MGM Tower</p>
<p>All of this is happening on an expedited schedule, too, as the first rooms should be available to guests in April and coincide with Memorial Day weekend. MGM COO Corey Sanders welcomed the opportunity and said that it was a great opportunity to see the raise of the status of the property and continue to deliver on the sterling experience that the industry-leading team of employees has made possible. Sanders added:</p>
<p>Introducing the MGM Tower connects Borgata with the unparalleled entertainment and resort experiences MGM Resorts is recognized for worldwide. MGM COO Corey Sanders</p>
<p>The renovation will lead to the overhaul of 700 rooms and will add luxury suites at the towers. This investment coincides with Borgata’s 20th anniversary. The Water Club was originally launched in 2008 and it cost $400 million to build next door to the Borgata casino and hotel.</p>
<p>The property is a 43-story hospitality venue that offers additional accommodation for guests of Atlantic City and the casino. The property was launched to help Borgata’s dedicated hotel cope with interest in its facilities. Sanders is confident that the investment in the property would not just be tied to the company’s own good fortunes but also help drive visitation rates to Atlantic City in general.</p>
<p>Renovation Fever in Atlantic City</p>
<p>The same sentiment is shared by a number of other properties in Atlantic City. Other companies have also made their plans to renovate properties clear over the past months. Caesars, Tropicana Atlantic City and Harrah’s Resort are all investing heavily, with the total value of their renovation funds estimated at $400 million.</p>
<p>Bally’s Atlantic City in the meantime has completed its own renovation worth $100 million. Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino began renovation in 2021, and there are other properties which have been mulling, raising capital, or just finalizing their own freshening-up. In Atlantic City, maintaining a good front is important not just for your own business, but tourism in general.</p>
