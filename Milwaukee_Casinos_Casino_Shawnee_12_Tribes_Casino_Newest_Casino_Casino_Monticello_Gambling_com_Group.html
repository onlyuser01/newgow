    <h1>Milwaukee Casinos Casino Shawnee 12 Tribes Casino Newest Casino Casino Monticello Gambling com Group</h1>

<p>The world of gambling affiliates has been shaken up once again in so many months. After Gaming Innovation Group bought out the leading complaint resolution and affiliate website AskGamblers in December, a new consolidation is underway with Gambling.com Group confirming the acquisition of the highly-coveted domain Casinos.com.</p>
<p>The news was first reported during Gambling.com Group’s Q3 2022earnings call and has been collaborated by respected media in the iGaming space this week. Casinos.com, as its name suggests, is a domain that is fully focused on the delivery of casino-related content. The domain was previously owned by Caesars, but the company didn't do much with it, it seems.</p>
<p>Casinos.com will focus on several markets in the coming months under Gambling Group’s umbrella, which already features domains such as Bookmakers.com, Bookies.com, and Gambling.com. The markets covered by Casinos.com will normally include North America’s Canada and the United States, but the domain will also spread to Ireland, the United Kingdom, and as far as New Zealand.</p>
<p>This is just a start, with Casinos.com probably seeking to enter and cater to consumers in other markets, too. Gambling.com Group CEO Charles Gillespie hailed the success of the latest acquisition, cited by iGaming Next, and said that Casinos.com was indeed the best domain to communicate and share the extensive knowledge his company has cultivated over the years with online casino players.</p>
<p>Gillespie said that his company was always focused on acquiring the "right" domain names to be able to reach audiences and deliver what he describes as a "player-first experience." The acquisition was also welcomed by Gambling.com Group VP of Commercial and Casinos Lee Gwilliam who was similarly excited about the development.</p>
<p>He reiterated the words of hiscolleague, arguing that Casinos.com was an impactful domain name set to make a big impact on the industry. "We think there is no one market-leading really great resource just for casino players that focuses purely on casino," Gwilliam explained.</p>
<p>Gambling.com Group has not shied away from auspicious business deals over the past months. In February 2022, the company acquired BonusFinder to further strengthen its pivot in North America.</p>
