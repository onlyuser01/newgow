<p>The leading provider of games for the online gambling sector, Pragmatic Play, announced it expanded its existing partnership with bet365, the globally recognized betting and gaming company. Details regarding the newly extended agreement emerged earlier this week.</p>
<p>Under the expanded collaboration, Pragmatic Play has taken its portfolio of innovative slots live for the operator in Spain. As a result, bet365's customers in this important European gambling market will be able to access thrilling hits from the iGaming developer such as Big Bass Bonanza, Sweet Bonanza and Gates of Olympus, among others.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the expanded agreement also covers the duo's collaboration for the regulated gambling sector in Sweden. Consequently, bet365's Swedish players can now enjoy a wide range of slots from Pragmatic Play. Moreover, they can tap into Mega Wheel and Boom City, among other engaging live casino games from the leading iGaming content provider.</p>
<p>A statement released by Pragmatic Play reveals that bet365's clients in Sweden will soon be able to engage with its award-winning bingo solution. The latest collaboration underlines the success of the partnership between Pragmatic Play and bet365 and comes after similar agreements signed for Ontario, as well as the UK.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for bet365 commented on the topic saying: "We are proud to extend our partnership with Pragmatic Play into the Spanish market, and now Sweden." Finally, they explained: "Its portfolio of award-winning and innovative content perfectly fits bet365’s product offering and Pragmatic Play is a welcome addition for our customers in both Spain and Sweden."</p>
<p>Irina Cornides, Pragmatic Play's Chief Operating Officer, added: "Expanding our presence in Spain and Sweden not only speaks volumes about the strength of Pragmatic Play’s partnership with bet365, one of the world’s leading gaming brands, but it also highlights the increasing demand for our premium Slots and Live Casino content." Last but not least, she pointed out: "This is an exciting time for both companies as we continue to grow in key regulated markets."</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play is renowned as a provider of quality slots that releases up to eight new titles each month. Earlier in November, the company announced the launch of Timber Stacks, a new slot that features an outdoor theme, RTP of 96.00% and the fan-favorite tumble feature. Moreover, players of the new slot can also tap into its expanding grid feature that grows the reel up to 10x5, offering a staggering 100,000 different ways to win.</p>
