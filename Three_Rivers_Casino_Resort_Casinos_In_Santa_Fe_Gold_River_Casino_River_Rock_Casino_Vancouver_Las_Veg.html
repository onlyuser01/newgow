    <h1>Three Rivers Casino Resort Casinos In Santa Fe Gold River Casino River Rock Casino Vancouver Las Veg</h1>

<p>One of the world’s best established testing agencies for the gaming industry has expanded its professional lineup with a new Chief Business Officer</p>
<p>Richard Howarth is a well-seasoned veteran who will now assume the position of CBO for the APAC region and help strengthen the company’s position in its targeted markets. He will plan and execute growth strategies across several markets and from the company’s premises in Sydney, Melbourne, Macao, and Adelaide.</p>
<p>Picking a Highly-Trained and Experienced Person for the Job</p>
<p>As part of his day-to-day, Howarth will also work with suppliers, regulators, operators, and industry bodies to ensure that everyone involved meets gambling industry standards across the board and regardless of the jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Howarth is a well-seasoned veteran who has significant experience under his belt. He served as CBO – enterprise technology sales at IXUP Limited/BetShop and worked as executive general manager, of sales, marketing, and corporate affairs for Trippas White Group.</p>
<p>He held a similar position with The Star Entertainment Group and Sportingbet and will now be stepping into this new opportunity with a firm foothold. GLI APAC CEO Ian Hughes has welcomed the addition of Howarth to the team and hailed the man’s knowledge and understanding of the gaming, hospitality, technology, responsible gambling, and customer relation elements of the business.</p>
<p>GLI has previously hired several seasoned industry veterans, including Joseph Bunveith and Kelly Mayers who were introduced as VP of government relations and regulatory affairs, and director of government affairs respectively.</p>
<p>The testing agency has also been working hard to expand its reach. Earlier this year, GLI was named the approved auditing body for the International Betting Integrity Association’s Data Standards.</p>
<p>GLI’s Certification Enables Companies to Pursue Growth</p>
<p>This way, any partner that wants to receive the IBIA Data Standards will undergo a rigorous and ultimately reputation-enhancing testing process that is carried out in compliance with GLI and the industry’s latest and most robust standards.</p>
<p>GLI Standards have been seen as a well-established and broadly accepted benchmark in the gambling industry. Thanks to GLI Certification, many companies have been able to break ground in important markets all over the world.</p>
<p>GLI provides its services for both the online as well as the brick-and-mortar operators and is a respected and trusted authority by operators, suppliers, and not least, regulatory authorities which ultimately hold the keys to important market businesses striving to gain a purchase.</p>
