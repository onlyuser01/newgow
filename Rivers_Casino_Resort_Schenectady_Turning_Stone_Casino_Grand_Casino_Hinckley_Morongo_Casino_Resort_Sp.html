    <h1>Rivers Casino Resort Schenectady Turning Stone Casino Grand Casino Hinckley Morongo Casino Resort Sp</h1>

<p>Dear trik.</p>
<p>You are obviously deeply convinced you have not done anything wrong, thus, both the casino and Casino Guru harmed your rights, is that so?</p>
<p>On the contrary, you were proven wrong - by using your wife's payment option, you actually breached the terms and conditions significantly. Please be smart and learn from this mistake:</p>
<p>"Many casinos verify the players' identity documents only after they submit a withdrawal request. So you may have used a third-person payment card several times for depositing, but as soon as you requested a withdrawal, the casino asked you to pass KYC verification. When the casinos find out that you used funds that did not belong to you for depositing, they are eligible to close your account and forfeit all your winnings.</p>
<p>I regret that I am unable to offer further assistance. Although we can not resolve this case, please feel free to reach out to us if you encounter any problems with another casino in the future. Based on the reasons mentioned above, I must reject this complaint. Thank you for your understanding."</p>

<p>Accusing the whole world around you gets you nowhere, I'd say.</p>
