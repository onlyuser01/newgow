    <h1>Parx Casino Bensalem Treasure Island Resort Casino Sturgeon Lake Road Welch Mn Spirit Mountain Casin</h1>

<p>It is blatantly obvious that this casino is running fake PragmaticPlay slots. Therefore I do believe the current rating by casinoguru is in no way justifiable.</p>
<p>I played several hundred spins since I knew right away this casino will never refund anything and my deposit is lost. This did give me the chance to try many of my favorite games which all "behaved" differently than during regular gameplay on a respectable site.</p>
<p>During my session, I could see several clues that all point to fraud:</p>
<p>There is no game history available for download, only cashier transactions.</p>
<p>Selection of Pragmatic slots is limited to games that have been around for some time. The sound and feel of these is almost the same as the original, but in the end all appear to be very good fakes.</p>
<p>There is no normal distribution of symbols, their version makes sure to have lots of the high paying symbols appear on the reels more often (rarely connecting in any way of course).</p>
<p>Games like Gates of Olympus or Sweet Bonanza use scatter multipliers that do not exist in the regular versions (like 40x, 60x) in a frequency that would almost never happen there. In GoO for example several of these show up every few spins, but of course almost never connect. Bonus rounds seem to happen a lot, but the show then continues with very few hits and same suspect game behaviour.</p>
