<p>Dear Stefan,</p>
<p>We appreciate you giving us the chance to discuss our actions on the player’s account.</p>
<p>In our further investigation, it now comes to light that this user conducts a suspicious sports bet behavior, as a result of our substantial suspicions based on the player’s bet history, we decided to suspend all activities from the account and confiscate the withdrawal according to the following terms and conditions :</p>
<p>18.1. Without restricting our ability to rely on other remedies that may be available to us, we may suspend and/or terminate your account, cancel any outstanding bets and/or confiscate any or all funds in your account at our absolute discretion if:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>we determine that you are acting in a manner that is detrimental to the conduct of our business;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We determine that you are using TrustDice.win in a manner that gives you an unfair advantage, for example making bets on insight or professional knowledge about a sport gained via personal involvement or participation in the particular field of sport or using the late bets strategy;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>we suspect that you have registered, manage or direct your betting activity on multiple user accounts in an attempt to hide your betting activity, bypass our set trading limits or violate any promotion Terms and Conditions;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>13.1. If you breach any provision of these Terms and Conditions or we have a reasonable ground to suspect that you have breached them, we reserve the right to not open, to suspend, or to close your Member Account, or withhold payment of your winnings and apply such funds to any damages due by you.</p>
<p>Our Compliance team also sent an explanatory email to ivanweber explaining terms and conditions breach.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Compliance team</p>
