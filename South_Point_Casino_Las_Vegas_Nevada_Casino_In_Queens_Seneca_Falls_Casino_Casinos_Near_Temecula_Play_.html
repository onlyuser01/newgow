<p>Aviator review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>As its name might suggest, Aviator is an aviation-themed slot from the developer, Spribe. The game is no ordinary slot or casino game, though. The aim of the game is to attempt to cash out before a plane flies off into the distance.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>There is very little going on in the way of design for the Aviator game. The action is based around a plane flying along a screen, and it has more of a resemblance to a side-scrolling mobile game to a traditional casino or slot game.</p>
<p>There are some simple sound effects as you play, but there is very little going on in terms of the overall design or soundtrack.</p>
<p>Once you bet, you can cash out at any time you want, unless flight fails you</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Aviator is not a traditional slot or casino game. It was developed by Spribe, a smaller company that specialises in unique gaming experiences. Aviator is what is known as a crash game.</p>
<p>The concept is simple, a plane is flying across the screen, and as it progresses, it displays an increasing multiplier. Your job is to attempt to cash out before the plane randomly flies off. Cash-out successfully, and you win. If the plane flies off, you lose. Of course, the plane doesn’t always stop flying when you do cash out, and in some instances, you have to sit and watch as potential winnings play out right in front of you.</p>
<p>Before each round starts, you will need to choose how much you want to bet and whether you want to play for the round. Once the plane has taken off, you will not be able to bet. It is possible to have two bets running in one game.</p>
<p>The game is built on a provably fair system, which means that the game is 100% fair all of the time and that players are able to check this. They can do so by clicking on the green tick on the control panel.</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>There are no special features available in Aviator. However, the game does have a social element, which also adds to its unique gaming experience.</p>
<p>This allows you to chat with other players while a game takes place, and it also allows you to see who the biggest winners were from the last round. This adds an exciting element to the game and is part of what makes Aviator such an engrossing game to play.</p>
<p>If you are patient enough, payout can be really nice</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The Aviator slot has an unlimited multiplier, which is part of what makes the game so attractive. The RTP on the game is also high. It comes in at 97%, which means it is something we recommend trying in our slot strategy guide.</p>
<p>The smallest bet you can place on Aviator is $0.10, and the maximum is $100, which is a nice range which should accommodate most budgets.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Aviator describes itself as a new generation of iGaming entertainment, and we must admit, we found the game hugely enjoyable to play. The concept is simple but incredibly effective, and the ability to interact with players definitely provides a different experience. If you’re looking for something different, Aviator could be the game for you.</p>
