    <h1>Casino Louisiana Sunray Park And Casino Hard Rock Hotel Casino Atlantic City Photos Harlows Casino M</h1>

<p>In the last month I have successfully withdrawl thousands of dollars from jackpotcity to my muchbetter account.</p>
<p>Within the last 10 days i withdrawn $3500 and &amp;1000.</p>
<p>It was coming up on week and I contacted the Live Support on 2 different days, inquiring of the status of the funds as on my "transation History" it states only that is has been "successfully withdrawn".</p>
<p>Both times, 2 different agents advised me that they would find out and be in contact with me. As most of jackpotcity’s agents, are commonly pretty unhelpful,, and difficult to deal with.</p>
<p>A day ago I was in the "book of oz" bonus. Betting $2.5-$5. And sometimes spins or lines land can we well over a grand. Well out of no where I noticed my balance go up around $1000. After the bonus I thought I might have missed a connected line payout or something. But i also went to check my transaction status and under "successfully withdrawn" was still the 3500 &amp; 1000 on their applicable date. So I didn’t think much of it. Then like any degenerate, I start betting a lot more thinking the game is on fire and lose it all. But thought to myself, It is what it is. I have $5000 coming in so it’s not the end of the world.</p>
<p>A couple hours later I sign back in. There is a pop up for literally enough time to read it. In summary, it said the following "for security reasons your withdrawl has been returned to your balance". —-BOOM—- That would explain the $1000 coming into my account randomly. It was my withdrawl being put back into play. So I contact LIVE SUPPORT once again. To see what the hell is going on. I beat around the bush to get actually answers this time. I get a very helpful agent. And she ends up giving me information that yes, that $1000 was indeed reversed and put back into my account. So I ask about the status on the $3500. (As I’m certain i would have noticed my balance go from $300 to $3800, like that would be impossible not too notice). And she tells me that was returned to my play as well. So i thought I had $5000 coming in and now zero. I ask her what the problem was. What random "security reason" could be stopping the withdrawals from going through. She said it was a problem with my "much better account". (The same much better account previously used this last month without incident). I asked her why Jackpotcity has not once notified me about the issue with my "much better account" and why I didn’t get any messages, emails, notifications for the $3500 being reversed. Basically why ironically did they pick a time when I’m aggressively gambling to magically reverse my withdrawals back into my live play balance. And then blame it on my "much better" account whom I’ve never had issues with. And since then I have spoken with live support 2 times and both agenda never mentioned a thing about either issue. Seemed all very suspect. And shady. Those online casinos make it hard enough to "cash out". First you get a deposit bonus and you have a play threw amount of x70. Then once you hit the play through, the funds have to stay in the "pending wthdrawl" account. (Where you can take any/all of the funds from and return them to live play. But now this whole mess I’m in?!?</p>
<p>And the best part. After all this I most recently withdrew another $2250. It was taken out of my "pending withdrawal" and into their processing. To 24 hours later. That $2250 was successfully deposited into nub"much better" account. I didn’t contact muchbetter, or modify my account in any way. It just worked like it always had….which I found very suspect. Now they deleted my account.</p>
<p>Moral of the story. I went from being on cloud 9 to such</p>
<p>I contacted an agent again. Copy and pasted a summery quite like the one you just read. And added at the end that i heard that with the resent events I was to be sent the paperwork to fill out to have all my "data deleted" (as I have zero trust in this website anymore" and that I was going to delete my account.</p>
<p>He first off tried confirming / verifing myself with a security question. (In my novel I copy&amp;Pasted, I had answered 3 answers to typically questions asked for verification, to expedite this conversation). He rudely responded to never do that again and proceeded to ask me what the last game I played was. I was unsure, got it wrong. Then he tells me that I have to exit this chat and to re-enter then"live support" so an agent can ask me the verification question, before he can do anything to help me). (These are the same questions I’ve previously answered in my previous write up. )I was flabbergasted to say the least. I told him I didn’t have time or energy to do this all over again and would do it again the next day. Also lasked him for the Jackpotcity management contact email. He said nothing like this exists, and when i was writing a response and question, Abruptly ended our live chat with no warning. The next day I go to sign into my "Jackpotcity"! Accounts deleted.</p>
