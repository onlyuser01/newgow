    <h1>Harris Casino Casino In Wheeling West Virginia Casinos In Monaco French Riviera Casino Tunica Instan</h1>

<p>Hello there.</p>
<p>I moved your post to the thread called "Can Casino Guru be trusted?" not to question you about your opinion but to help others with making their own opinions as well. ðŸ™‚</p>
<p>Needless to say, Daniel has provided a few responses in the past, I'll try to summarize the subject:</p>
<p>We get offers from various casinos every week. They offer us money for increasing their rating or to start promoting them in TOP casinos for specific markets. We never accept such offers. All the ratings and standings are based on many tests and reviews done by real human-beings (not robots) and we do these tests couple times per year. I'd say that's the main reason why we deserve to be trusted ðŸ™‚</p>
<p>Fundings and income:</p>
<p>We created the biggest list of casino reviews in the world and we regularly update this list to make sure that the ratings are still valid.</p>
<p>We recommend different top casinos to players based on where they come from, because for example a casino that is great for German players doesn't need to be too good for players in Argentina etc. So we try to create a unique top casinos list for every country. When players go to play to these casinos and eventually lose, we get a commission from it.</p>
<p>We never tell the players to play in a casino, because you become rich, we actually say that you eventually lose, but we also know there are people who simply love casino games. We believe that it's better for those players to play in decent casinos who will pay the winnings in case the player is simply lucky instead of making stupid excuses and voiding the winnings. That's why CasinoGuru was created - to provide honest online casino reviews.</p>
<p>The income we have also enables us to do a lot of activities that we don't get paid for - for example we have the Complaints resolution centre where we help players to get their winnings from casinos. We don't take any commission for it so when the player gets paid, they get 100% of the amount. We also have an academy for people who'd like to start their carrier in online casinos and even for online casinos workers who'd like to improve in their job.</p>
<p>We also invest into Global Self Exclusion initiative. The goal is to create a tool that would allow players to self-exclude in all casinos in the world (we could use our large casino database for it).</p>
<p>It is really that simple - we get commissions, though I'm personally convinced the process is fair and serves the main principle we hold the most important - to be fair and square - with anyone .</p>
<p>According to the fact the whole company is about to meet at a regular Casino Guru Gathering by the end of September (fully funded by the company), we are not to be broken in a day. ðŸ™‚</p>
<p>Not sure who told you so, but to me, it sounds more like a daring wish...ðŸ¤”</p>
<p>Did I answer your questions?</p>
<p>In any case, let me know if you need anything else.</p>
