    <h1>Draftkings Casino Free 50 On Registration Funzpoints Casino Website Login Casino In Montgomery Al Da</h1>

<p>I have a gambling problem. But I took the step to setup a deposit limit BEFORE I started to play. The deposit limit was €25 daily and I could put the deposit limit myself without contacting support.</p>
<p>After I put the deposit limit, I wanted to make a deposit of €25. But it turned out that the minimum allowed deposit was €50 with creditcard (mastercard)!</p>
<p>I contacted support and asked them if they could raise the deposit limit to €50, but they told me I could do that myself!</p>
<p>I started to question the logic about having a deposit limit that I could manipulate how I wanted. The support seemed to agree with me and promised to investigate the matter and come back to me with an email.</p>
<p>I raised my own deposit limit to €50, played and lost. Then I raised it to €100... and finally €150 when the anxiety kicked in and I didnt want to play more.</p>
<p>Because they hadnt responded about the pointless deposit limit, I decided to close my account permanently instead. I felt I didnt like that I could set my own limits.</p>
<p>I visited the Responsible Gaming section and saw that I could exclude myself, but the longest possible exclusion was only ONE MONTH!</p>
<p>I contacted the support again and said I wanted to be exluded permanently because of gambling addiction, but they said they could not do that and I had to manually do it myself, and max 1 month. I objected about it but they told me again that they could not do anything about it.</p>
<p>I would like my money back because they had a bon functional deposit limit.</p>
<p>I would like to have my account closed permanently.</p>
<p>Please help me casino guru!</p>
<p>I have logs of all the conversations.</p>
