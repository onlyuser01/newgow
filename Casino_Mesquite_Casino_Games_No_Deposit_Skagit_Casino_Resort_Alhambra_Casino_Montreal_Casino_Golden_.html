    <h1>Casino Mesquite Casino Games No Deposit Skagit Casino Resort Alhambra Casino Montreal Casino Golden</h1>

<p>I just want to leave a review and say please do not play here. I'm so glad I stopped myself from making a deposit. It was very sketchy the chat person actually lied to me about terms and I caught him in the lie. I had started their multi-stage promotion where they give you $250 balance you have 10 minutes on rival only slots and have to wager at least $20 and keep your balance above $250 by the end of the 10 minutes. Seems straight forward once you navigate how they word it. I was very careful as always and asked all the questions to make sure this is what the promotion was. So I played the first stage completed it as such with terms mentioned. It even said in the promotions page I can claim the 2nd stage. I had won a total of $15 and apparently that's what would be added ontop of my deposit which I would then need to wager bonus winnings ($15) + deposit (25) 35x wagering to be able to cash out a max of $400. So i thought my balance would be $250 but no it gives you the winnings of whatever u won in those 10 minutes during first stage which it does not clearly state this in the terms either. It makes it seem like you will get $250 balance to play with your deposit on the 2nd stage but it's only the amount you win. So fine okay. Then the chat guy told me when I asked if everything is good he said no I have to win another $250 in order to be eligible for the 2nd stage. This was no where in the terms. He knew my wagering wouldn't be much because it was $15 (bonus winnings) + $25 deposit I would need to wager 35x which isnt bad. He told me I need to redo it and I argued that no where in terms it says I need to win $250 I just needed to MAINTAIN THE $250 BALANCE in the first stage and wager at least $20 during the first stage which I had done. So he kept saying I had to redo it so I redid it . He then told me I needed a balance of $500 total by the end of the 1st stage the $250 balance given will be deleted and I'll need to win $250. I had argued I did it right the first time. So I said fine . I redid the 1st stage and got my balance to $488 and the 10 minutes was up I didn't make it to the $500 balance. He said oh that's fine you can make a deposit and go to the 2nd stage now .. so here he lied once again . He wanted me to have a bigger wagering requirement . I did do everything correctly the 1sf time he just didn't want me to only have to wager the $15 bonus and my deposit . I have it all saved in screenshots oh and when I called him out on it he said he can give me back the $15 I won the first time and use that after all the arguing and him saying I did it wrong because he wanted me to have more wagering . So he blatantly lied to me . If you want screenshots of the conversations I'll send it gladly just please don't play here .</p>
