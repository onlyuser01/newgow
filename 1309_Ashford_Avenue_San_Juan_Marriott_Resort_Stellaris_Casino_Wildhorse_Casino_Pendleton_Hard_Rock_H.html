<p>The partnership provided Olimpbet with entry into esports betting while helping Oddin.gg expand its presence in Asia</p>
<p>Esports wagering solutions supplier Oddin.gg continued expanding its roster of global partnerships with the addition of a sports betting operator from Kazakhstan, Olimpbet.</p>
<p>Revolutionize Esports Wagering</p>
<p>The strategic partnership with Olimpbet will see Oddin.gg support the sports betting operator’s entry into the world of esports wagering, help it solidify its leading position in the local market and expand its footprint in Central Asia.</p>
<p>Oddin.gg’s co-founder and managing director for Partnerships, Marek Suchar, welcomed the agreement with the brand that is leading the way in the Kazakhstan market, thrilled at the collaboration between both teams.</p>
<p>“Olimpbet’s unwavering commitment to customer satisfaction and their visionary approach align perfectly with our engagement approach,” he said, adamant that the collaboration is capable of revolutionizing the esports betting landscape while “providing an immersive and thrilling experience for bettors” in the country.</p>
<p>The partnership with Oddin.gg saw Olimpbet integrate the esports betting provider’s iFrame solution, including trading and risk management capabilities, and go live with esports wagering at the beginning of June, expanding its product offering with the addition of new engaging experiences.</p>
<p>Entry into Esports Betting</p>
<p>On behalf of Olimpbet, the marketing director for CIS at the company, Elena Meleshina, outlined that “a passion for excellence,” as well as “a commitment to anticipating the needs of [the] customers” have been the two driving factors behind every step Olimpbet has undertaken so far.</p>
<p>“With the rapid growth of esports, it was only natural for us to embrace this exciting phenomenon and cater to the rising demand for esports betting,” Meleshina said, heaping praise on the esports betting solution Oddin.gg provided.</p>
<p>“The iFrame provided by Oddin.gg encompasses all the essential components required for a truly captivating user experience,” she added, outlining the solution’s capabilities to support “a swift go-to-market strategy” that is in perfect alignment with Olimpbet’s business objectives.</p>
<p>The partnership with Olimpbet is the latest for Oddin.gg as the esports wagering solutions provider has been quite busy since the start of the year. It comes less than a month after Oddin.gg agreed to supply Lion Gaming with extensive coverage of esports events and data and enable wagering on esports.</p>
<p>In February, Oddin.gg teamed with NSoft to benefit from the platform supplier’s extensive knowledge of the esports market and boost its product offering to current and future esports partners. Earlier in the month, Oddin.gg expanded its Asian footprint via an agreement with QTech Games.</p>
<p>At the start of the year, Oddin.gg entered the Balkans via an agreement to provide its iFrame solution to MaxBet and boost the brand’s offering in Monte Negro, Serbia, and one of the two entities of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Republika Srpska.</p>
