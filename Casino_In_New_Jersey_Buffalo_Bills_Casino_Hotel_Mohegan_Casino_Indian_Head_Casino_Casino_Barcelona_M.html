    <h1>Casino In New Jersey Buffalo Bills Casino Hotel Mohegan Casino Indian Head Casino Casino Barcelona M</h1>

<p>I subscribed to Mystake and won around €50.000 unfortunately I was unable to withdraw the amount because the casino has withdrawal limits to prevent players from withdrawing their winnings at once when they hit big. This offcourse in the hopes they will gamble it away again. Unfortunately winning that big and being unable to withdraw my winnings, I gambled my winnings away. As a result I tried to win back my the money I lost and deposited around €5000 more. trying to win back my losses had caused me to not be in control of my actions and my gambling.</p>
<p>After losing this amount a friend told me that it was illegal for Mystake to offer me services since i'm a dutch national and it is illegal for an online casino to offer services to a dutch national without a licence from the dutch authorities. I send an e-mail to mystake requesting a refund of the deposited amount since it was illegal for them to offer me their services and I mentioned that I was not in control of my gambling anymore which they could see by looking at my deposits which were getting more frequent and of higher amounts.</p>
<p>They told me that I would not get a refund and that the terms and conditions state that a player must determine whether or not they could use the site and that had used my deposit and would not get a refund.</p>
<p>I replied with the fact that the casino has a responsibility to protect their players if their gambling becomes out of control, which I told them it had. I got a reply that i would not get a refund and that the casino had acted responsibly and had closed my account. this was in august</p>
<p>Unfortunately I found out that I could still access my account and when I had saved some money I deposited several times again. from the moment my account should have been closed up until now I deposited and lost €1615,-</p>
<p>I emailed Mystake that with the request of a refund of this amount since it should not have been possible for me to deposit (and therefore lose) any money on their site. The response was that I never requested for my account to be closed and that the email telling me that mystake had acted respinsibly and had closed my account was meant for another player. (this offcourse is not true since that e-mail was a direct reply to my request for a refund.)</p>
<p>In summary I never should have been able to deposit after I got the e-mail telling me that my account would have been closed.</p>
<p>Can you help me get the money back that the casino took from me by taking advantage of me by not closing my acccount after I told them it was illegal to offer me services and that I was not in control of my gambling?</p>
