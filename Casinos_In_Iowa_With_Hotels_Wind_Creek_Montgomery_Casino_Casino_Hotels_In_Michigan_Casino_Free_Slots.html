<p>Globally-recognized gaming company International Game Technology (IGT) expanded further the reach of its leading technology. Earlier this week, the company revealed that its subsidiary IGT Global Services Limited, extended its contract with Westdeutsche Lotterie GmbH &amp; Co. OHG (WestLotto). Under the freshly-inked collaboration, IGT agreed to supply Aurora, its central lottery system. In addition, the extended contract included Aurora's related technologies, a statement reveals.</p>
<p>Aurora is famous as IGT's player-centric and omnichannel solution for lotteries which is a part of OMNIA. The unique solution is developed in an effort to boost profitability and innovation within the lottery vertical. Thanks to the new deal, the solution will help power WestLotto's operations, ensuring reliability for an increased volume of transactions.</p>
<p>At the same time, Aurora leverages tools that help lotteries continue to grow and manage successfully their businesses. "The platform will provide intuitive, user-friendly applications, tools and reporting capabilities which will handle all of WestLotto's transaction processing, game management and back-office operations," explained IGT.</p>
<p>Jay Gendron, IGT's Chief Operating Officer, Global Lottery, explained that as the largest lottery in Germany with €1.7bn ($1.82 billion) in sales, WesLotto needs the reliability, innovation and complexity that IGT's Aurora technology offers. He added: "Our high-performing Aurora platform and its components will enable the Lottery to manage its business more efficiently, while providing premier player experiences and maximizing funds to good causes."</p>
<p>The partnership marked an exciting moment for WestLotto too with its Co-CEO, Christiane Jansen, pointing out: "IGT's global expertise and our extensive knowledge of the local lottery market complement each other perfectly." She explained that the collaboration marks an important moment for the company as it delivers a secure, innovative and reliable platform.</p>
<p>Andreas Kötter, WestLotto's Co-CEO, added that IGT has provided the company with leading lottery solutions for the last two decades. Moreover, he explained that the IGT is one of WestLotto's most reliable and trusted partners and has helped elevate the player experience. Finally, Kötter said: "We look forward to modernizing our central system further through the implementation of Aurora and the many benefits its modules will present to our Lottery."</p>
<p>The extended contract with WestLotto comes on the heels of another important deal announced by IGT recently. Back in April, the company confirmed it extended its existing partnership with the Rhode Island Lottery. Thanks to that collaboration, the Lottery continued to use IGT's leading sports betting solutions, powering its operations.</p>
