<p>Rumors that the UK government will not clamp down on partnerships between gambling firms and soccer teams have stoked interest in those link-ups. While fans do not always like this, there is a good commercial reason why such partnerships are happening in the first place. As a result, Sunderland AFC has become the latest soccer team in the country to sign up with financial trading and sports betting operator Spreadex.</p>
<p>As a result, Sunderland AFC will be backed by Spreadex as its official partner ahead of the 2022/23 season with the partnership ending in 2025. Part of the partnership will include the betting company’s logo displayed on the team’s home and away t-shirts. Sunderland AFC COO Steve Davison welcomed the partnership without reservation and said that the club was pleased to welcome the company as its new sponsor.</p>
<p>Davison further confirmed that the club is looking forward to what should be a mutually-beneficial partnership. The next three years will be a period of marketing opportunities and collaborations designed to boost each other’s footprint and presence in the public consciousness. He further added:</p>
<p>"It is set to be an extremely exciting campaign for the club as we return to the Championship, and this partnership will also support communities within the City of Sunderland through a range of innovative initiatives."</p>
<p>Apart from the shirt sponsorship, which has been a hotly-debated topic in the upcoming review of the Gambling Act Review of 2005, the companies have agreed to a range of other branding and visibility opportunities.</p>
<p>This will include circumference signage which will run around SunderlandAFC’s home stadium along with LED screen branding. Further marketing will take place on both companies’ social media accounts in a bid to bolster each other’s profiles with their respective audiences and engage with new ones. Once again, this partnership comes with a commitment to various charity and community initiatives.</p>
<p>Spreadex CEODavid MacKenzie welcomed the partnership between the companies as well. He commended Sunderland AFC on the recent strong results and the club’s return to the Champions and the executive, as well as his company, are looking forward to working with the club. He added:</p>
<p>"One initiative we will be introducing immediately is a pledge to donate £100 to the club’s designated charity for every home goal scored by the Black Cats throughout the upcoming season. We will also be looking to launch other charity initiatives in the coming months."</p>
<p>Sunderland AFC is hardly the only soccer club to have turned to such partnerships. Everton FC and Bournemouth FC have both opted for similar partnerships, citing commercial reasons as well as an opportunity to achieve better synergies and engagement with their respective fans.</p>
<p>The White Paper that is due in several weeks was once feared as set to end such partnerships, but this is not likely to happen, The Times reported earlier this week. Rather, gambling sponsorships in sports will remain intact, albeit additional safeguards may be used.</p>
