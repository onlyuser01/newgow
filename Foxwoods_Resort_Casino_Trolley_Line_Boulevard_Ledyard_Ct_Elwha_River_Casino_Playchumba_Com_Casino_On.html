<p>The provider of video slot and video bingo games for the online and retail gambling sector, Zitro, confirmed a new partnership, allowing the company to expand further the reach of its engaging portfolio of games. On Tuesday, the company confirmed it joined forces with Casino de Mallorca, boosting its presence in Spain with the delivery of Mighty Hammer, its new and exciting multi-game.</p>
<p>The new and innovative title already enjoys strong popularity within different markets around the globe. Zitro explained that the new multi-game delivers three levels of excitement, bringing engaging experiences, "each connected to a different bonus link." According to the game developer, the multi-game offers thrilling and unmatched experiences, elevating the excitement for the players within different bonus levels.</p>
<p>Jaime Aníbal-Álvarez, Zitro’s Director of Casinos Spain, shared his excitement about the new collaboration with Casino de Mallorca which allows the company to expand the reach of its games and engage with new audiences. In a statement, he pointed out: "With the addition of Mighty Hammer, we have no doubt that players will surrender to the irresistible power of the hammer."</p>
<p>As noted, the collaboration helps elevate the experiences for Casino de Mallorca's customers. A representative for the venue was similarly delighted about the deal with Zitro and added: "We have decided to incorporate the most cutting-edge product in the market by trusting Zitro once again." Finally, Casino de Mallorca's representative noted: "The addition of Mighty Hammer to our casino has been well-received by players, thanks to its impeccable graphics and innovative game mechanics."</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Zitro announced another important deal earlier this week. The company revealed it teamed up with Grupo Solverde for the delivery of games for Hotel Casino Chaves. This partnership enabled Zitro to expand once again the reach of its leading games to new customers in Portugal.</p>
<p>Thanks to the new collaboration, Hotel Casino Chaves' customers will be able to benefit from fan-favorite and popular titles by Zitro, including 88 Link – Wild Duels, Boost Link King, 88 Link – Lucky Charms, Mighty Hammer and Boost Link Me, among others.</p>
<p>A highlight of the deal with Grupo Solverde is the delivery of Zitro's new concept, Mega Lounge. This innovative and cutting-edge system, the game developer said, connects all games and cabinets, enabling them to contribute toward a common jackpot. Elevating the experience further, Mega Lounge brings quality graphics and sound effects.</p>
