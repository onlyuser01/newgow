<p>Erin Blanchfield will be facing off Sarah Alpar in the women’s flyweight fight during UFC Vegas 37. The event is slated for Saturday, September 18, and offers fans an opportunity to see Blanchfield try to kickstart her career in the UFC.</p>
<p>Blanchfield has never fought in the UFC before and the promotion is generally a more challenging environment for newcomers. She will face a more experienced fighter in the face of Alpar, who has a loss and a win so far with two finishes.</p>
<p>Oddsmakers are confident Blanchfield has the upper hand here, going off her showing in her MMA career, but you ought to pay attention to what is happening.</p>

<p>Tale of the Tape Blanchfield vs Alpar</p>
<p>Blanchfield Stats Alpar 5’4″ Height 5′ 4″ 135 lbs Weight 135 lbs 66″ Reach 63″ Orthodox Stance Southpaw 6-1-0 Record 9-5-0</p>
<p>Blanchfield Looking to Make UFC Debut</p>
<p>Blanchfield is coming in as the favorite, although she is completely new to the UFC. Her overall MMA career puts her at 6-1-0, which are decent stats. Yet, to keep going up, she will need to overcome Alpar in Saturday’s bout. The oddsmakers post her at (-400) favorite in a bid to bring home a win and set herself up for a further career in the Ultimate Fighting Championship.</p>
<p>Given what we know about Blanchfield, she seems like a fighter who is comfortable in the MMA. She has fought a number of opponents and won by decision for the most part, but her fight against Victoria Leonardo finished with a head kick that put Leonardo out. Understandably, these fights took place outside the UFC, but they still apply insofar as reading Blanchfield goes.</p>
<p>Blanchfield would have fought on several occasions more were it not for canceled bouts all throughout 2020. She is now moving on to the UFC in the hopes to leave her mark on the promotion, and this is precisely what people seem to expect from her.</p>
<p>Alpar An Underdog with Some UFC Experience</p>
<p>Alpar’s track record is much patchier. She currently stands at 9-5-0 and has one loss and a win in the UFC. The odds don’t seem to favor her, with bookies mostly relying on what they know about her outside the promotion.</p>
<p>She has pulled off some great wins versus Shanna Young and Joselyne Edwards outside the UFC, but still keeps losing to fairly ill-established MMA fighters, which makes Alpar the underdog. One issue with her is that she doesn’t fight proactively, but reactively, meaning that she bides her time and often lets opponents build up too much momentum, which can be hard to cope with. We see this fight ending in the first two rounds, with Blanchfield sealing a win.</p>
