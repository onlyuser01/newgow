<p>The company released details regarding www.SportBet.com, its newest mobile and sports betting platform that focuses on providing services to customers in the United States</p>
<p>The leading interactive gaming, sports betting and technology company, Elys Game Technology, confirmed its plans to expand further within the regulated betting sector across North America. On Thursday, the company introduced www.SportBet.com, its new online and mobile sportsbook focused on the market in the United States.</p>
<p>Through its new Elys America platform, the company plans to deliver thrilling and engaging experiences for sports bettors across the United States. Backed by innovation, cutting-edge technology and unique features, the platform is expected to expand exponentially and become a favorite among American bettors and sports fans.</p>
<p>The recently announced platform comes at a time when the US betting landscape continues to mature, with more states legalizing the activity every year. Citing recent studies, Elys confirmed that the global sports betting vertical is expected to hit $180 billion by 2030.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the planned expansion for Elys doesn’t come as a surprise, considering the potential of the US market. According to data from the American Gaming Association (AGA), sportsbook revenue increased by 75% between 2021 through 2022, hitting a staggering $7.5 billion. At the same time, Elys estimates that the market in the country could surpass $25 billion by 2030, reaffirming its commitment to growing in the region.</p>
<p>Elys’ new online and mobile brand builds on its successful collaboration with regulated casinos and sportsbooks in the US. Recognizing this as an “evolution in its business,” the launch of the company’s platform remains subject to securing the relevant regulatory approvals. Ultimately, Elys anticipates launching www.SportBet.com in multiple US states. The launch would be facilitated via a market access partnership the company plans to sign in Q4 of this year.</p>
<p>The Company Remains Committed to Delivering Unique Betting Experiences</p>
<p>Michele Ciavarella, Elys’ executive chairman, spoke about the growth of the company within the North American landscape with the introduction of www.SportBet.com. He added: “SportBet.com is a clearly identifiable sports betting URL emphasizes our direction in the US and our goal to be recognized as a top-tier challenger in this expanding market.” Finally, Ciavarella said that Elys remains committed to delivering unique sports betting experiences via a responsible and innovative platform that also promotes customer loyalty.</p>
<p>“We remain dedicated to delivering an unrivaled sports betting experience, combining innovation, dependability, and responsible gaming practices to earn the loyalty of our players.“ Michele Ciavarella, executive chairman of Elys Game Technology</p>
<p>The newly introduced platform clearly signals Elys’ plans for expansion and growth across North America. At the same time, the collaboration strengthens the company’s global footprint, after it has already established a strong presence in Europe.</p>
