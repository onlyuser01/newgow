<p>SBC Summit Latinoamérica is set to reunite more than 3,000 delegates interested in the iGaming and sports gambling industries in the Latin American region. Now, the event’s hosts have revealed a new track, Affiliates &amp; Advertising, that may excite even more interest in the upcoming event which will be taking place on Wednesday, November 1 at the Seminole HardRock Hotel &amp; Casino in Miami, Florida.</p>
<p>This particular track will reunite affiliate and advertising experts who will be part of thought-provoking panels and discussions and help aspiring business and potential partners better understand what these particular segments look like in Latin America, where their true potential lies, and how affiliate sites can build brand loyalty and maximize conversions, drive new traffic, and first-time depositors.</p>
<p>Commenting on the latest track to be presented for the seminal event, SBC CEO &amp; Founder Rasmus Sojmark noted that the affiliate &amp; advertising conference vertical is a gateway for delegates to discover exciting strategies, connect with experts and better navigate the dynamic advertising environment in Latin America.</p>
<p>"By securing the region’s most prolific experts in the affiliate and advertising domain, we will equip attendees with an educational experience that will actively shape their trajectory towards success in this burgeoning region," Sojmark noted.</p>
<p>There will be a range of speakers and prominent delegates in attendance, including RobertKraft (CEO, Atlas World Sports), Thomas Carvalhaes (Managing Director, Vai de Bob) and Luis Sangiovanni (Chief Marketing Officer, Fast Track) who will all be joining the "Launching In LATAM – Fundamentals of Brand Identity" panel.</p>
<p>Another excellent opportunity will "The Untapped Opportunity in Affiliation," which will take a closer look at how affiliates are perceived in the region, and how they can build a stronger brand identity as well as drive financial and business successes. This panel will be joined by Adrian Tejeda, Logrand Entertainment’s Affiliate Leader, Noelia Groisman, Codere’s Affiliate Leader, and Laura Gago, BETANDEAL’s Head of Operations. All of these experts are intimately familiar with how operators can leverage affiliates to advance their business in Latin America.</p>
<p>Another prominent panel in the track will be "Tech at The Centre: Understanding Customers to Maximize Retention and Acquisition." This panel will reunite Shlomi Haffner (Industry Manager, Google), Lali Odosashvili (Head of Marketing, Hybrid Interaction), Nancy Ayala (Vice President of Legal, Rush Street Interactive) and Jean-Luc Ferriere (Managing Director Americas, Fast Track) who will talk about how marketing technology can have a significant impact on businesses’ advertising capabilities.</p>
<p>The panelists will have a deep dive into the available analytics and data, the application of artificial intelligence, and other established tools that can help drive stronger results for affiliates in the region. The entire track is set to bring immense value and insight to affiliates that are looking to expand their footprint in Latin America. SBC Summit Latinoamérica is one of the best ways to get started.</p>
