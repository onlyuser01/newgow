<p>Ohio is preparing to open the sluice gates of sports betting with the state nearing the launch date set for January 1, 2023. Many have suggested that the state could be one of the biggest in terms of sports bettingpotential, but a new study by BonusFinder now puts the Buckeye State ahead of some of the present top performers, such as New Jersey and Pennsylvania, even though there is not much data to work with.</p>
<p>The report shared with Casino Guru News via email focuses on how Ohio will dominate sports betting trends in 2023 and lead the way in overall interest in the vertical. The company has used the 2023 Sportsbook Bonus Index to reach this conclusion.</p>
<p>The index draws on a number of specific factors that the company has looked into to make these predictions. For example, BonusFinder takes into consideration the total number of pre-approved licensees in the state, a total of 25, which is the highest in the United States bar Colorado.</p>
<p>There are also other important movers. Jake Paul, a YouTuber-turned-pugilist is bringing his proprietary Betr platform to the state, and professional sports teams across all major leagues in the country have shown interest to boost the reach of sports betting as well, with local franchises in Ohio feeling particularly optimistic. BonusFinder is confident that this, and the interest at the college level in sports betting, could help the state overtake the competition right from the start.</p>
<p>A true test of this prediction will be the 57th Super Bowl which will happen in February after Ohio has launched sports betting officially. The Index interestingly pushes Maryland and Massachusetts ahead of top performers such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Michigan.</p>
<p>BonusFinder’s prediction is very ambitious, but it also makes for an interesting read of the overall sports betting landscape in the US with some of the potential top-performer not live yet. Meanwhile, results in the land-based casino and racino sector have remained robust, with gamblers spending more, said the report.</p>
<p>BonusFinder has also taken a look at the main teams that could drive interest in further sports betting operations for the state’s punters, including Cleveland Browns and Cincinnati Bengals in the NFL and the Cleveland Cavaliers in the NBA. There are also MLB teams, such as Cleveland Guardians and Cincinnati Reds that are expected to incentivize local gamblers.</p>
