<p>The leading global online gambling brand and one of the largest operators in the world, Kindred Group, announced that its Nomination Committee has taken a decision regarding proposals for the re-election and election of members for its Board ahead of its 2023 Annual General Meeting (AGM).</p>
<p>The company's Nomination Committee decided on a proposal that the Board of Directors for the period until the AGM 2024 should have nine members. For that period, the Committee proposed that there should be no deputy members.</p>
<p>According to a statement released by Kindred, the Nomination Committee Chairman, Keith Meister, said: "The Nomination Committee believes that its proposed Board, which replaces a majority of Directors, should be communicated to stakeholders in a timely manner."</p>
<p>Meister explained that the Nomination Committee "felt it was prudent to make this disclosure before the Notice of the AGM 2023 and our Motivated Opinion." Kindred's Nomination Committee revealed that the members of the current Board of Directors, Gunnel Duveblad, Fredrik Peyron, Peter Boggs and Erik Forsberg confirmed that they do not plan to participate in re-election at the AGM 2023.</p>
<p>In addition, the Committee proposed four current members of the Board of Directors be re-elected. Those members included Evert Carlsson, Carl-Magnus Månsson, James H. Gemmel and Heidi Skogster. The latest announcement of the Nomination Committee proposed the re-election of the aforementioned members until the AGM 2024. Similarly, the Nomination Committee has proposed to re-elect Evert Carlsson as a Chairman of the Board.</p>
<p>Another announcement by the Committee included the proposal to add new members to the Board of Directors. The new members should include Andy McCue, Cédric Boireau, Martin Randel, Jonas Jansson and Kenneth Shea, who should be a part of the Board through the AGM 2024.</p>
<p>Meister outlined that during the process of consideration, the Nomination Committee completed interviews with Kindred's CEO, qualified candidates, as well as all the current members of the Board of Directors. He added that the new proposals are the result of this complex process.</p>
<p>Focusing on the proposed members, Meister said that they "bring complimentary skill sets and will strengthen the Board in key areas." He said that Boireau and Gemmel make a fine addition to the Board and increase the ownership representation, considering that they represent nearly 20% of the ownership of Kindred.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Meister said that Jansson and McCue have significant experience within the gambling industry, while Shea and Randel have solid backgrounds in mergers and acquisitions and capital markets verticals. "The proposed new Board has the right mix of continuity: new directors representing large owners, proven industry leaders, and business leaders with capital markets, M&amp;A, and entrepreneurial expertise," said Meister in conclusion.</p>
