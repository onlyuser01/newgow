    <h1>Twin Arrow Casino Liberty Casino Login Casino In Cleveland Ohio Hotels Near Hollywood Casino Charlot</h1>

<p>Betway was one of the first mainstream sportsbooks to take up esports seriously. Years after, the Super Group-owned betting agency has not let up. The company has renewed its partnership with the South American organization Beastcoast and its Dota 2 team.</p>
<p>Building upon the Esports Community</p>
<p>This partnership allows the companies to enjoy a mutually beneficial relationship that has translated into an international success. Beastcoast CEO Brian Anderson commented on this partnership, arguing:</p>
<p>“Beastcoast is thrilled to continue our long-standing partnership with Betway as they have proven to be the clear leader in the very competitive sports betting industry.” Beastcoast CEO Brian Anderson</p>
<p>Moving forward, the pair will develop dedicated content, including the Illuminate talk show, along with the Betway Road to Beastcoast, which will allow Dota 2 fans to form teams and compete in the event that will culminate with show matches against Beastcoast themselves.</p>
<p>Betway esports director Adam Savinson commented on the partnership and praised the continuation of what has turned out to be a successful relationship between the companies:</p>
<p>“The South American esports community is growing year on and year, and it’s great that we can continue to showcase our product to esports fans through our epic partnership in Peru.” Betway esports director Adam Savinson</p>
<p>Savinson argued that Beastcoast had responded very well to the partnership, and he and Betway were eager to continue building upon their relationship throughout 2022. Betway and Beastcoast will team up for various prize raffles and awards to fans as well, including signed jerseys and more activations to be announced later into the year.</p>
<p>Esports Part of Betway’s Identity</p>
<p>Betway has been committed to the esports vertical for years now. The company has struck partnerships with established franchises such as Made in Brazil, G2, PSG.LGD, FURIA, and the company has sponsored events, as well as help, establish various campaigns centered around esports.</p>
<p>Anderson added that Betway had been actively expanding its footprint, and Beastcoast has been proud to be a part of that expansion. “Together, we’ve been able to collaborate on some really fun activations for our fans, and we can’t wait to share what’s in store for this next chapter,” he concluded.</p>
<p>Betway itself brings a variety of esports-focused markets both in pre-match and live settings. The sportsbook is habitually listing great odds boosters, promotions, and more to make the experience worthwhile. On average, Betway offers numerous opportunities to bet on esports, thanks to some excellent odds.</p>
