<p>Leading iGaming player retention and player reactivation company Enteractive has revealed the results of one of its latest surveys regarding American consumers’ preferences and expectations in connection to customer relationships. The online survey was conducted by international market research and consulting company The Harris Poll and it targeted more than 2,000 US adults.</p>
<p>Nine out of Ten Americans Would Rather Talk to a Real Person</p>
<p>One of the most important findings of the online survey refers to the fact that 90% of consumers would rather be greeted by and interact with a real person when getting in touch with a brand for an inquiry instead of receiving automated responses from chatbots. At the same time, a similar percentage of US consumers felt that a brand’s team of call agents should speak the same language as the customers they are planning to contact.</p>
<p>Seven out of ten Americans felt that automated calls from brands were frustrating, and more than half of respondents called them “very frustrating”. At the same time, 87% of consumers believed American brands should rely on Caller IDs when getting in touch with their customers.</p>
<p>Americans Say Robo-calls Are Frustrating</p>
<p>The same number of respondents expressed their willingness to stay loyal to a certain brand provided they would notice genuine interest and involvement from live call agents.</p>
<p>Twenty percent of consumers stated they would not mind receiving calls from brands for the purpose of checking in and improving their customer relationships.</p>
<p>Enteractive uses a one-of-a-kind (Re)Activation Cloud technology that allows its clients to be in full control while connecting their player databases to the company’s call agents. This way, Enteractive’s call agents are able to use a customized one-2-one conversations model that is fully aligned with the survey’s results.</p>
<p>Enteractive’s chief executive officer Mikael Hansson stated that the company has been using real people to engage in conversations with its clients’ customers in their native language for the past 13 years. He also expressed his desire to assist US companies with similar customer retention practices. Enteractive entered the US market with the help of a service license for New Jersey obtained last May. The company then announced its plans to launch a series of important conversion campaigns in the state that would target existing and fresh clients.</p>
