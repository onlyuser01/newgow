    <h1>Online Casino Real Money No Deposit Twin Arrows Navajo Casino Resort Tuscany Suites Casinos East Fla</h1>

<p>Hello 0xbet,</p>
<p>I have always been encouraged by your casino VIP representatives to play, be it in the casino or sports. All my play has consistently adhered to the limits set by your provider. When I inquired, I received approval to use multiple currencies for gameplay, as confirmed by my VIP manager, Lewis 0xbet, in the following exchange:</p>
<p>"I want to deposit some BTC closer to the weekend. Is that allowed as I have held ETH at your site up until now."</p>
<p>Lewis 0xbet responded: "I am writing to inform you that you can freely deposit in BTC. If there are any problems, contact me right away."</p>
<p>You explicitly encouraged the use of different cryptocurrencies, as evident from my conversations with Lewis 0xbet. Moreover, you were aware of my gaming activity for an extended period, during which I maintained high roller status for 4 months. If there were concerns about my play style, you had the option to limit or reject it during this period. Instead, you extended VIP perks and bonuses (which I did rejected). I consistently sought clarification on acceptable practices, and my playstyle remained unchanged. It took 19 weeks for 0xbet to express disapproval, not by rejecting my play, an option available from the start, but by forfeiting my entire balance, comprising of both deposits and winnings. 19 weeks. My gameplay remained consistent from my sign-up until 03.10.2023.</p>
<p>Contrary to 0xbet's claim that "His balance is empty, moreover his withdrawals are much more than deposits," I currently have a balance of 65,000+ euros due to a crypto price increase and winning pending bets, accepted by 0xbet, in my 0xbet account. You, 0xbet, initiated direct forfeiture, which is not stipulated in the terms you claim I violated.</p>
<p>At the time of the forfeiture on 03.10.2023, I deposited 29.829 ETH, 0.29734638 BTC, 78.0615 LTC, 18128.75 USDT, and 5622 Euros. I have withdrawn 34.657 ETH. Documentation of these transactions has been sent to casino.guru.</p>
<p>There is still 0.29734638 BTC, 78.0615 LTC, 18 128.75 USDT and 5622 Euros to be released to cover my deposit, minus the 4.828 ETH withdrawn. That is approximately 29 166.86 euros in today's exchange rate just to cover the deposits. I value honesty, even if it's not a currency you, 0xbet, value. I believe players reading this also value it. I cannot speak for casino.guru, but I imagine they do aswell.</p>
<p>My balance is now 0 due to 0xbet (Casbit Group) enticing and encourage me to deposit most of my crypto and pulling out the rug under my feet. Evidenced by encouragement to deposit with VIP promos and bonus offers up until the forfeiture.</p>
<p>I will provide my transaction history to casino.guru and request that 0xbet verifies the information they seem to base their claim on. The blockchain stores all transactions, making this verification straightforward.</p>
<p>As you, 0xbet, base your claim on provable falsehoods. Have you got the correct player? I do not recognize the allged violation of the terms you claim I breached. The assertion of using "different and new wallets" is unfounded, considering I had approval to use various wallets and cryptocurrencies from your casino representative. Your claim that "withdrawals are much more than deposits" is inaccurate, as 29 166.86 euros remain to cover the value of my deposits.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Orde0</p>
