<p>Jim McIngvale, the Founder of Gallery Furniture, an American businessman and sports bettor, collected the largest-ever payout from sports betting last week. McIngvale, who is also known as Mattress Mack, placed multiple wagers on the 2022 World Series, the famous championship series of Major League Baseball (MLB).</p>
<p>On Saturday night, The Houston Astros won the World Series title after recording a 4-2 win against the Philadelphia Phillies. Considering that McIngvale had previously placed multiple bets on the Astros, his team's win brought him a staggering $75 million in total as a payout. This was the largest payout so far from regulated sports betting.</p>
<p>On November 6, McIngvale posted a photo via Twitter with the text: "How tweet it is 75 million," holding a suitcase full of cash and clearly happy about the outcome of the tournament and the win of his team.</p>
<p>In a separate statement, Mattress Mack thanked H-Town, the Astros, his wife Linda and everyone else. He said: "This last week has been specially... beyond words. An incident that was just me trying to defend my city, and our team galvanized the city. It's beyond words my gratitude for all of you always having my back." McIngvale continued: "What can I say? I love y'all. I love this city. I would do anything for this city, and I would do anything for you."</p>
<p>In an interview for FOX on Saturday, McIngvale explained that he will use the $75 million prize to boost its promotions for customers at his Gallery Furniture stores. He said: "The Astros did all the work, all I did was bet the money."</p>
<p>Mattress Mack revealed a unique promotion for some of his furniture stores offering a refund for customers that purchase mattresses for $3,000 if the Astros win the World Series. Now that the win is a fact, McIngvale will bring even more excitement to his customers.</p>
<p>To achieve the $75 million payout, McIngvale wagered via multiple sportsbooks. Overall, he bet a whopping $10 million hoping that the Astros would win the World Series. He placed a $1 million wager with Wynn Bet, while another $3 million McIngvale wagered via Caesars.</p>
<p>Although it was risky, his wager paid off big time. From Caesars alone, Mattress Mack collected a $30 million payout. Caesars Digital's COO, Ken Fuchs, commented: "What can we say? We just wrote the biggest check in sports betting history to Mattress Mack for $30,000,000."</p>
<p>While this year it was a win, last year, Mattress Mack lost a million-dollar wager on the Astros. In 2021 he hoped the Astros would win the World Series and wagered $3.2 million but lost.</p>
