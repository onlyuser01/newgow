<p>Specialist in online casino player retention and re-activation Enteractive announced today it entered into a partnership deal with the sports betting operator based in the Netherlands Fortuna Entertainment Group.</p>
<p>Leverage Enteractive’s Expertise</p>
<p>The partnership between Fortuna Entertainment Group and Enteractive will focus on two of the group’s brands popular in Romania, Fortuna and Casa Pariurilor, looking to benefit from the retention specialist’s re-activation and NRC campaigns.</p>
<p>Impressed with Enteractive’s proprietary cloud-based (Re)Activation technology platform and its capabilities for seamless and easy integration of player databases, paired with the personalized approach to players adopted by the team of native speakers at Enteractive, the Fortuna brand is eager to see the retention specialist in action.</p>
<p>“We’re keen to see how Enteractive’s expertise can bring back players that are otherwise hard to reach and how this will affect our business in the long-term. We see loyalty and retention as key factors in improving bottom line revenues.” Alexandru Tarog, Head of Marketing, Fortuna</p>
<p>With a personalized and responsible approach, ease of integration and solid return on investment for its clients, Enteractive stands out from other conversion and re-activation offerings available on the market, and the brand is looking to leverage the retention specialist’s more than 12 years of experience to bring back into action the brand’s inactive players in Romania.</p>
<p>“Retention and reactivation are two essential terms for the iGaming industry, and many operators in this sector are seeing benefits in paying more attention to this. We’re excited to be working with such big brands in this emerging market and to bring back churned players for Fortuna and Casa Pariurilor.” Andrew Foster, CBO, Enteractive</p>
