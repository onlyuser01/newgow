<p>BF Games has been advancing in new markets a lot in recent weeks and months. The company has grown its footprint in Croatia in Europe, securing partnerships with Arena Casino and PSK. BF Games has now achieved another milestone – this time in Ontario, Canada, the supplier confirmed in an email press release.</p>
<p>The latest milestone is possible through the successful completion of a licensing process resulting in the issuance of a supplier permit by the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario (AGCO), the provincial regulator which oversees the regulated sports betting and iGaming markets the company is now a part of. BF Games is the author of a number of prominent games that will be offered to local and regulated operators, and their players.</p>
<p>The studio has developed a number of excellent games with close to 80 titles at the time of writing. BF Games’ covers multiple themes, from Goblin, Hit, Spooky, Undersea narratives to the Wild West, Winter, Asian, Ancient and Cash Mesh, mixing both thematic beauty and mechanical execution.</p>
<p>Among the company's titles are excellent games such as Cave of Xmas, Stunning Cash Ultra, Sweet Reward, Burning Slots Cash Mesh, Dragon’s Chance and others. Company Head of Legal Wiktor Grabarczyk welcomed the news and the opportunity to see BF Games expand its footprint in North America:</p>
<p>"We are thrilled to be awarded a license by the AGCO, as being able to enter this highly promising market is a great milestone for us."</p>
<p>Grabarczyk confirmed that the region will play an important role in BF Games’ further growth plans and ambitions. In December, BF Games teamed up with SCCG Management, with the consultancy agency confirming that it would assist the supplier to gain further traction in the North American market, and particularly in Canada and the United States.</p>
<p>BF Games’ entry in Ontario is a smart call, as the province is set to be the biggest regulated iGaming market in Canada.</p>
