<p>Dear ert65,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. Iâ€™m sorry to hear about your problem.</p>
<p>Please understand that KYC is a fundamental and essential process, during which the casino makes sure that the money is sent to the rightful owner. As they don't have the luxury of physically seeing all of the players and checking their identification and documents, this is the only way gambling establishments can complete the verification procedures. None of the serious and licensed casinos take KYC lightly.</p>
<p>Could you please list which documents you have already provided?</p>
<p>Have you uploaded your documents on the casino's website or have you sent the documents via email to the casino?</p>
<p>Which documents seem to be causing issues for you?</p>
<p>I hope we will be able to help you to resolve this issue as soon as possible. Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Tomas</p>
