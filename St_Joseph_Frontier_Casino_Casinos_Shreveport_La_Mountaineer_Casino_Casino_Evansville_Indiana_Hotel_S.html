<p>Poland’s leading sportsbook operator, STS, is launching a new esports campaign on time for STS Katowice, a big event on the esports calendar and professional CS: GO circuit.</p>
<p>STS’s Commitment to Esports Remains Strong with New Campaign</p>
<p>Leading Polish bookmaker STS is reaffirming its footprint in the esports space as Poland has shaped itself as a hot spot for competitive video gaming over the last years with significant operations in cities such as Katowice, Krakow and Warsaw.</p>
<p>To reach out to millions of gamers in the country, STS is rolling out the “Your World. Your Win” campaign, which is just on time for IEM Katowice 2021, a respected gaming festival held in the namesake city annually and attracting significant interest from Europe and the CIS regions.</p>
<p>IEM hosts one of the largest stops for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS: GO). Intel Extreme Masters, which gets underway on February 16 and will run through February 18 with 24 CS: GO teams vying for the lion’s share of $1 million allocated in prize money, is one of the main competitive stops for the game.</p>
<p>The event always attracts a strong audience turnout as well as top broadcasting talent. For this year’s edition of the tournament, Wiktor “TaZ” Wojtas, a CS: GO player himself will sit side-by-side with Cloud 9’s Henry “HenryG” Greer and deliver insights as the game action unfolds.</p>
<p>Esports Industry Unfolds in Poland with STS’ Support</p>
<p>STS will use the high-profile of the event – not just with international audiences but also the Polish esports community – to try and reach out to as many new players who may be interested in the product it offers.</p>
<p>More importantly, though, STS wants to position itself as a non-gambling company and to this end, the bookmaker has been the bedrock of esports in the country, sponsoring teams and leagues.</p>
<p>With esports exploding and showing resilience during the pandemic, STS is just one of many betting operators to appreciate the strength of the segment. According to the company’s chief marketing officer, Paweł Rabantek, STS’s leadership in the sports betting vertical makes it obligated to venture into esports, as recent investment has shown.</p>
<p>Launching on time for IEM Katowice demonstrate STS’ commitment to the segment, Rabantek has added concluding that the company is keen on making esports a more unifying experience for everyone.</p>
