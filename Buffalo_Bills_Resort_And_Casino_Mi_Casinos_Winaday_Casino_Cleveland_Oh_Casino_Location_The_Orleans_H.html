    <h1>Buffalo Bills Resort And Casino Mi Casinos Winaday Casino Cleveland Oh Casino Location The Orleans H</h1>

<p>That might be just a misunderstanding. I understood that you didn't contact us (the data team) regarding your insights about the casino while you expected to get a reply from us...</p>
<p>So to clarify further, if I were to post on a different casino forum like say IWild with what I said here that would be spamming? Um Ok</p>
<p>If you have an issue with one specific casino then discuss it in the relevant thread related to the casino. If you have an issue with the entire group, then just create a special thread dedicated to the group.</p>
<p>The problem is that when you discuss basically the same thing in various threads, then the context is completely lost and the readers are lost as well since the evidence, arguments or information are spread across multiple threads.</p>
<p>When it comes to your question why the iWild is recommended in Canada...See? We're just discussing iWild in a thread about the Dozenspins casino...that's just wrong, but I'll reply to it. The recommended casinos differ per country so players from different countries will probably see different lists of the TOP casinos.</p>
<p>First of all, user reviews have zero impact on the casino's safety index rating. In short, the safety index should reflect the probability of not being paid in case you fairly win. The casino doesn't only have the rating of 8.5, but they even earned the Casino Guru Fair Badge. Casinos get this badge if they agree to follow a certain set of rules given by the Casino Guru. Once again, the rules are focused on players protection.</p>
<p>When you look at their complaints section, you'll realize they don't have a single unresolved complaint. That means that whenever a player had and issue there and we agreed that the player would deserve to be treated better or the player is simply right, the casino was willing to discuss it and resolve it successfully with the player (in 100% of cases). That's a sign for us that players can feel safe there, because whenever they'll face any injustice there, the casino is willing to listen and resolve it.</p>
<p>Once again, I'd like to highlight the fact we're discussing iWild here, you posted the screenshot of iWild into the the discussion while the thread is about a different casino. That means anyone who'll be looking for more info about iWild won't probably find it here anyways ðŸ˜•</p>
