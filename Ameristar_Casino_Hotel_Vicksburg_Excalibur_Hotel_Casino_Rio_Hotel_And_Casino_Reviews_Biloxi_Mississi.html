    <h1>Ameristar Casino Hotel Vicksburg Excalibur Hotel Casino Rio Hotel And Casino Reviews Biloxi Mississi</h1>

<p>The Victorian Gambling and Casino Control Commission (VGCCC) has prepared a new set of restrictive regulations at Crown Melbourne. This comes after Crown Resorts announced its interest in better understanding what the newly imposed electronic gaming machines (EMG) tax levy would mean for its operations. The tax would generate up to AU$30 million ($21.3 million) on a yearly basis year. Both decisions are aimed at the EMGs found on the gaming floors at Crown Melbourne.</p>
<p>The New EGR Rules Want to Reduce Gambling Harm</p>
<p>One of the primary reasons why the VGCCC created the new regulations for these machines is the need to considerably reduce gambling harm. Accordingly, some of the most important changes that the new rules will bring to the table will be a series of bans imposed on players. For example, gamers who enjoy playing more than a single EMG at a time will be banned from the casino. The same will happen with players who will use the tactic of holding down several buttons on machines that are not restricted to benefit from continuous play. Altogether, the new legislation will help Crown Melbourne’s operations match the responsible gambling objectives part of the Gambling Regulation Act 2003 as well as the Casino Control Act 1991.</p>
<p>A Royal Commission report issued in 221 could be used as inspiration for new regulations that the VGCCC might decide to further embrace.</p>
<p>Why Are the New Regulations Necessary?</p>
<p>According to VGCCC’s acting director licensing Jason Cremona, gamers who choose to play several machines simultaneously do not comply with the responsible gambling objectives part of the current legislation. The same goes for playing non-stop, uninterrupted with the help of various objects used to physically block the buttons on these machines.</p>
<p>Even more, Crown Melbourne needs to make sure that all patrons fully comply with the current regulations in the industry. VGCCC will keep observing and assessing the casino’s compliance, while not hesitating to take the needed action against the operator, should it fail to comply with the rules.</p>
<p>Victoria’s state government also decided to dedicate AU$55.6 million (US$39.3 million) from its annual budget for 2022/23 to activities that will increase surveillance on Crown Melbourne. The money will be used to implement a number of important recommendations issued by the Royal Commission.</p>
