<p>Rainbow Riches review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Everyone knows if you catch one of the aos sí fairies they’ll lead you to the pot of gold at the rainbow. Which is where you’re hoping this slot is going to lead you.</p>
<p>Rainbow Riches is based around a Leprechaun (who appears as one of the Bonus symbols), and other light-hearted Irish myths of wishing wells and hidden treasures.</p>
<p>It's a fun theme that isn’t really capitalised on with the background being a sickly purple landscape of fields with a rainbow mostly obscured by the reels.</p>
<p>Reels have stacked symbols in Rainbow Riches slot</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>Like the background, the symbols chosen to illustrate the theme are a bit naff. The art is kitsch at best and tacky at worst and doesn’t do much to work with the fun idea of Leprechauns, rainbows and gold.</p>
<p>The sound design is perfectly fine but rather uninspiring. The slot is silent until the spin button is pushed when it makes a quick harp noise and a few desultory clunks.</p>
<p>It isn’t the worst designed slot we’ve ever seen, but it's not much fun to look at.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>The main gameplay is a 20 winline, five reel Barcrest slot. You can choose how many of the 20 lines you want to play which gives you some control over variance and bankroll considerations.</p>
<p>The main draw from a gameplay standpoint are the multiple bonus games (more on these below).</p>
<p>Beyond that, the gameplay is pretty bog-standard.</p>
<p>Rainbow Riches Wild symbols win</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The game comes with four special symbols a Wild symbol and three different bonus symbols. The Wild plays as any symbol except for the bonus symbols.</p>
<p>You can trigger any of the three bonuses by hitting three of the relevant symbol on one spin.</p>
<p>The first bonus is the Pots of Gold symbols. Hit three of these and you get to play a wheel of fortune style wheel spin game. Wherever the wheel stops you win the value written there.</p>
<p>With the Wishing Well feature, you are presented with a bunch of wells, you chose one to reveal how much that well is worth and your bet is multiplied by the value of the well.</p>
<p>The Road to Riches feature is slightly different. You roll an eight-sided dice to see how many steps you move. You can move between 1 and 6 steps or you have two chances of hitting "collect", which would end the feature and you would receive your total spin bet multiplied with number you reached. Multipliers can vary depending on your casino, they should be between 1 and 200.</p>
<p>Bonus features explanation</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The RTP of this game is 95%, which is a bit below average. It certainly doesn’t impress and counts as a minor black mark against the game.</p>
<p>The variance on the game is medium, there are opportunities for big wins, and of course, by playing fewer lines you can increase your variance considerably if that is your preference (you can find some high-variance game strategies in our strategy section).</p>
<p>Highest paying symbols paytable</p>
<p>The site we tested allowed a minimum bet of £/€/$0.01 which should cater for even the lowest of rollers. While the maximum bet was a whopping £/€/$500.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Overall Rainbow Riches has some nice bonus features but is on the whole not a very fun experience. The design looks shoddy, there’s very little sound to generate atmosphere and the RTP and variance are both middling.</p>
