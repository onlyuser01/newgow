    <h1>Paysbig Potawatomi Bingo Casino Cash Frenzy Casino Golden Nugget Casino Casino Richmond Bc Canada Be</h1>

<p>Good morning,</p>
<p>I regret to inform that I have a complaint about Lalabet. Initially, everything seemed quite fun and enjoyable with this casino. I won once €600 and another time €480, which was great since all of this was won without any verification process. I continued to engage and play more games since I'd say I'm quite an active gambler. Then, one evening, I struck it big - first, I won a few thousand, and this quickly turned into nearly €17,000 - at one point even exceeding €30,000. Thinking smartly, I decided to cash in my earnings right away. I was able to take out €7,500, and I did just that. There were still no requests for verification... a couple of days passed, and although they had previously deposited money into my well-known ABN account twice, they suddenly requested verification. It took me some time to comply with this request. After that, I wanted to make another deposit but they offered me the option to cash out my winnings. So I continued to play and in the meantime, I was assigned a VIP manager, Artur, who seemed quite amiable at the start.</p>
<p>However, things took a turn while I was in South Africa. Due to certain restrictions, I was unable to play all the games that I wanted to. Nevertheless, I managed to win a few slot games and received an attractive bonus offer. However, my issues with the sizable sum I was unable to claim left me frustrated. I then visited Lalabet's website on Guru and stumbled upon two negative reviews, one of which by a German reviewer whose circumstances seemed to mirror my own, especially in terms of the issue of slow payment in case of big winnings. The smaller winnings got transferred to my ABN account within days, but I faced real trouble when it came to the substantial amount.</p>
<p>I learned from their website that Dutch players aren't allowed to gamble there – a fact I wasn't aware of and I felt this was illegal. But even after I pointed out this illegality, instead of blocking me, they kept encouraging me to play. I had received cash back twice, €1500 and another €400 amongst other small amounts. So, in essence, almost the entire sum I wagered was my own money. This afternoon, I confronted them with these issues, but each of my inquiries to the VIP was sidestepped. Sometimes they even inexplicably blocked me.</p>
<p>I personally enjoy playing roulette and have had instances in the past where the ball landed on zero but my account showed zero - an issue I was taking up with them. Today, my VIP manager informed me unexpectedly that I have made a withdrawal; though, to my knowledge, I haven't. And now my account has been closed without my asking for any money. They wouldn't even disclose the withdrawal amount. However, luckily I have taken screenshots of all our conversations. I have given them until 13.00 tomorrow to disclose the amount. I would like you guys, Guru, to read the reviews here, especially the German one who had an almost identical experience and eventually never heard back from them. My verification is complete and on paper too, as they suddenly inquired tonight if I would like to proceed with it. I believe this to be sheer fraud and, given the amount of evidence I've collected, I would appreciate it if Guru could look into it.</p>
<p>Best regards, Dave</p>
