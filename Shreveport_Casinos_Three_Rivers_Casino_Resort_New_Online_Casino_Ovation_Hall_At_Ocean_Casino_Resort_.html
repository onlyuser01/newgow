    <h1>Shreveport Casinos Three Rivers Casino Resort New Online Casino Ovation Hall At Ocean Casino Resort</h1>

<p>Ignition Casino is continuing to build up its marketing team, adding relevant and prominent poker figures to its team of ambassadors, content creators, and casino aficionados. Landon Tice, a professional poker player, has become the latest streamer to join the Ignition Casino family and will now contribute.</p>
<p>Landon Tice, A Known Face at Poker Tables</p>
<p>Tice is an up-and-coming poker professional who has amassed $516,759 in live poker earnings with his first appearance at the WSOP $1,000 No-Limit Hold’em – 8-Handed Turbo DeepStack (Event #18) where he placed first for $29,817 in 2020.</p>
<p>His biggest live earning victory came at the $ 970 + 130 No-Limit Hold’em – MSPT (Event #29) during the DeepStack Extravaganza in Las Vegas. Tice won $201,529. He will now take his poker nous and channel it into diverse content, appearing on Ignition’s live streams and branded events. Tice will bolster the company’s marketing efforts through video content and more. Commenting on his appointment, Tice said:</p>
<p>“I’m thrilled to work with Ignition Casino to amplify the awareness of its already extensive online poker offering and to help build the brand’s exposure throughout the US.”</p>
<p>When not streaming poker under the Ignition brand, Tice will be attending live poker tournaments and promoting Ignition there. The 23-year-old poker ace has been able to quickly establish his reputation as a capable player who is composed and takes on new challenges with a mix of excitement and determination.</p>
<p>As part of the Solve for Why Academy coach, he already has the interpersonal skills to educate others when it comes to poker and he is happy to continue taking and sharing his knowledge online as he demonstrates his thought process and what goes into every decision he makes to achieve certain results in the games he plays.</p>
<p>Tice Ready to Take on Online Poker Challenges</p>
<p>While there are some details that are left blank at present time as to how Tice will promote Ignition Casino at online and in-person events, he will be attending a number of prominent ones. This includes The Monthly Milly with a $1 million guaranteed prize pool. The Milly is running, as the name aptly suggests, every month.</p>
<p>He will be also available for other high-profile events, including Super Millions Poker Open, Golden Spade Poker Open, black Diamond Poker Open, and more. Tice welcomed the opportunity to be trying his expert hand at all of these events as he looks to build on his online poker career.</p>
