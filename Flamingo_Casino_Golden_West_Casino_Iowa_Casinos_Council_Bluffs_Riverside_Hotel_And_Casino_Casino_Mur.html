<p>The Australian manufacturer of gaming products will now benefit from the new technology and incorporate it to offer a more robust and safer experience</p>
<p>This agreement comes at a pivotal time for Independent Gaming, as the company operates in a market that is increasingly talking about the incorporation of facial recognition technology to protect consumers and help tackle problem gambling and money laundering across Australia.</p>
<p>Facial Recognition Arrives at Australian Manufacturers</p>
<p>The solution was first introduced at the G2E Industry Expo back in 2019 and it’s a feature of the SYNKROS management system, which allows players to sign in with their dedicated accounts at Electronic Gaming Machines (EGMs), which have been the subject of serious debates in Australia recently.</p>
<p>The government and local politicians have urged for various new solutions in order to curb the rates of problem gambling in the country and also help fight what police authorities have called a billion-worth industry of money laundering that takes place across Australia’s social clubs and bars, venues that are authorized to offer EGMs legally. The idea of facial recognition has been picking up steam in New South Wales where the measure is seen as a good way to kill two birds with one stone.</p>
<p>However, Konami and Independent Gaming are not just focusing on the Australian market. In fact, the Wednesday morning statement released by Konami indicated that the alliance would allow the two companies to make the system available to properties all around the world. Independent Gaming managing director Lawrence Shepherd commented on this opportunity and said:</p>
<p>Our IP agreement for facial recognition use in all our NEXTNET gaming systems continues the advancement in our technology. Independent Gaming managing director Lawrence Shepherd</p>
<p>Global Demand for Biometrics Solutions in the Gaming Industry</p>
<p>He hailed the benefits of biometrics and said that they empowered both operators and players. Thanks to this new deal, Independent Gaming customers will now have access to facial recognition solutions of the highest calibre, the executive noted.</p>
<p>Konami EVP and COO Tom Jingoli was similarly pleased with the licensing agreement. Jingoli explained that Konami was determined to drive innovation across the board for the industry, and making its facial recognition intellectual property available to companies across the globe was an important part of this.</p>
<p>“We appreciate the shared collaboration with Independent Gaming on this agreement,” Jingoli concluded.</p>
