<p>XLMedia, a market-leading performance marketing company, has recently parted ways with Christopher Bell who resigned from his position as chairman. The company has now announced that Julie Markey will temporarily fill in the vacant seat as an interim chair.</p>
<p>Markey Takes Over for the Time Being</p>
<p>Until a suitable permanent substitute is found, Markey will remain in the position of an interim chair, taking over Bell’s role. The interim chair’s usual role in XLMedia is that of a non-executive director of the company and chair of the remuneration committee.</p>
<p>Markey was chosen for the position thanks to her long experience in roles of responsibility. Prior to joining XLMedia, she used to work for various other companies. One of them is the multinational beverage alcohol company Diageo where she stayed for five years, working as a business support manager. Markey has also served the British multinational grocery and general merchandise retailer Tesco for 13 years and has been the group people director of the British online supermarket Ocado for almost 10 years.</p>
<p>Bell Left XLMedia to Join Nueva Codere</p>
<p>Christopher Bell announced his decision to leave on January 19 this year and opted to join Nueva Codere as a non-executive chairman. Bell promised to stay behind in XLMedia until his responsibilities have been orderly transferred to another person.</p>
<p>Bell served XLMedia as a non-executive chairman for eight years, assisting the company with its initial public offering and helping it in various strategic deals. When he talked about what prompted his decision to leave, he explained that he felt it was the right time to vacate the spot and let XLMedia begin a new chapter:</p>
<p>“It feels like the right time to step aside and let someone new support the business through its next phase of growth.” XLMedia non-executive chairman Christopher Bell</p>
<p>He wished the XLMedia team all the best and said that he hopes the company will be successful and will continue to increase shareholder value.</p>
<p>Bell is now fully committed to his new position in Codere. To make sure he has time to focus on his responsibilities there, he left not only his non-exec chair position in XLMedia but also his role as a senior independent director of Rank Group.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Codere itself is also experiencing an inner restructuring as its chief executive officer, Vicente Di Loreto, announced he will be leaving the company. It was announced that the CEO position will be co-succeeded by a duo of industry veterans, namely Alberto González del Solar and Alejandro Rodino</p>
