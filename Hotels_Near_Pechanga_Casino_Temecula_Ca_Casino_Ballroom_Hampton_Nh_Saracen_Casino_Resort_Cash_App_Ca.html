<p>Hi Tomas, thanks for getting back to me. I will try and explain in the best way possible. I only played Baccarat and deposited £300, £500, £300 and £500 in the beginning and also made a few withdrawals which were credited to my account. My last deposit was £700 and soon after the deposit they stopped me from playing asking for proof of funds so I provided my 3 months bank statement and pay slip and they removed the block after a day but by then I didnt want to play any more and thought they were asking for too much of my personal information so I decided to withdraw my last deposit money of £700. I then got an email from their payments department as below:</p>
<p>Dear player,</p>
<p>We hope you’re enjoying your time with us.</p>
<p>We are contacting you from our Payments Team because recently you have requested for withdrawal without wagering your deposit. Please be informed that as part of our compliance procedure, your activities on our website had been reviewed. It is important for us to ensure that you enjoy the highest standards and that your gameplay is safe and fair.</p>
<p>After careful review of your account, please be advised that we have temporarily blocked transactions in your account. In order to proceed with your withdrawal please provide an explanation of why you did not wager you deposit prior to withdrawal according to point 2.2.6 of our Terms and Conditions?</p>
<p>If you have any questions you are always welcome to contact our customer service team.</p>
<p>I replied stating I no longer want to play with them due to bad experience of asking for various proofs and unsatisfactory service as their live chat is of no use and do not give a valid answer and they keep asking for more and more documents. I didn't get any reply from them for 2 days now and when I Login to my account it states withdrawala are not allowed due to anti money laundering. At this stage, I'm not sure if it's due to not wagering that £700 or other reasons to which I havent received any response. If I'm given assurance that when I will wager that £700 1 time as per their terms then I'm happy to play even though I dont want to. I believe I should have the right to withdraw my money if I'm dissatisfied with their service, hope that information helps. Thanks</p>
