<p>Woman Sentenced in Relation to an Attack from 2016 at Ho-Chunk Casino</p>
<p>A woman from Wauwatosa was found guilty over charges for felony and aggravated battery concerning an attack on a man that occurred at Ho-Chunk casino back in 2016. The 30-year-old Chia Chang entered a no-contest plea to the described charges. Initially, the charges included robbery as well, but the charge was dropped after an agreement of the Attorney’s Office at Sauk County District and Ms. Chang.</p>
<p>Ms. Chang was sentenced to three years of probation by Sauk County Circuit Court Judge Wendy J. N. Klicko. As a part of the sentence, the lady must pay $200 restitution and she is also prohibited to contact the man which she attacked and injured. Furthermore, Ms. Chang is banned from all gambling establishments and must also go through alcohol and drug treatments.</p>
<p>The Night of the Incident</p>
<p>The attack for which Ms. Chang was sentenced occurred in September 2016. Back then, the local authorities were contacted by a 61-year-old man from Minnesota. The man had injuries to his arm and left eye. Upon questioning, the male revealed that while he was sitting at a blackjack table at Ho-Chunk casino near Baraboo and Wisconsin Dells he was approached by a woman in her 20s.</p>
<p>The woman asked the man to borrow her some money so that she can go back home to Milwaukee. The male refused to give her any money but did notice that the woman was sleepy and offered the lady to stay in his hotel room for the night. Speaking to the police, the male said that he didn’t expect sex from the lady nor assumed that she was a sex worker.</p>
<p>In the middle of the night, the man woke up to see the lady ransack his personal belongings. After that, the man said that he was attacked by the lady with a coat hanger but during the brawl, she also scratched him and bit him. The man was able to force the lady out of his room and contact the police.</p>
<p>Upon the investigation of a detective from the Sauk County Sheriff’s Office, Ms. Chang was identified and related to the Ho-Chunk attack as well as another case involving a forgery attempt at a Wells Fargo bank branch. Speaking with the police, the lady admitted that she sometimes experiences blackouts and that she doesn’t remember.</p>
