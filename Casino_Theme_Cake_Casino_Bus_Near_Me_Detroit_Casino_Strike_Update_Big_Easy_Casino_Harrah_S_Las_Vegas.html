<p>The Illinois Gaming Board has given developers approval to build a temporary casino in Rockford. That’s according to a statement issued by the city’s mayor on Friday.</p>

<p>While more approvals will be necessary before the short-term venue opens, the news means the city 90 miles west of Chicago is that much closer to opening a Hard Rock Casino.</p>
<p>Of the 6 casinos that were approved in the casino expansion bill in 2019, we are the first to begin construction!” said Rockford Mayor Tom McNamara in a statement posted on the city’s Twitter feed. “This is a huge accomplishment!”</p>
<p>According to a statement from state Sen. Dave Syverson (R-Rockford), construction on the temporary casino could take place as early as this week.</p>
<p>Developers chose a location that formerly served as a restaurant and convention center for the initial casino. It’s owned by a family that was initially part of the 815 Entertainment LLC investment team.</p>
<p>That facility could operate for up to two years, the senator said.</p>
<p>“For more than 20 years, I have worked to bring this project to fruition, knowing that it will have such a positive economic impact locally,” Syverson said in his statement. “After so long, it is very rewarding to see this project gain real momentum.”</p>
<p>The Rockford Register Star reported construction on the first venue, expected to hold about 730 slot machines, is expected to take about three months.</p>
<p>According to documentation submitted to the IGB from 815 Entertainment, the temporary casino is less than a mile away from the location of the $310 million permanent venue on the east side of town.</p>
<p>Restaurant Owner’s License Denied</p>
<p>In April, the IGB denied a gaming license to Joseph Castrogiovanni, who owns the restaurant and convention center site where the temporary casino will be built.</p>
<p>The Register Star reported that Castrogiovanni failed to reveal to the board in a timely manner that he was charged with a misdemeanor reckless conduct charge in July 2020. At that time, Castrogiovanni approached a car that had driven onto his family’s property. He told police he meant to shoot a warning shot, but one of the bullets hit the car, which contained two people. That bullet landed in a pouch behind the front passenger seat.</p>
<p>Castrogiovanni was a part of 815 Entertainment, but the denial led to the company buying out the family and purchasing the building.</p>
<p>The IGB also has investigated another gaming business owned by Dan Fischer, the managing partner of 815 Entertainment.</p>
<p>Developers are expected to invest about $8 million into the facility once known as Giovanni’s.</p>
<p>Rockford Files: What the City Will Get from Hard Rock</p>
<p>Once the temporary casino opens, it will trigger the start of payments to the city of Rockford.</p>
<p>According to the information submitted to the IGB, the casino will pay the city at least $7 million each calendar year. It will also make payments based on the net income of the temporary and permanent establishments.</p>
<p>While the temporary casino is open, Rockford will get an amount equal to at least 15 percent of the net revenue, and no less than $1.82 million for the first 12 months it’s open. For subsequent years the temp venue remains open, the city gets 5 percent of net income, but no less than $1.07 million.</p>
<p>Once the permanent casino opens, the city gets funding equivalent to 1 percent of the adjusted casino and sports betting revenues during the first two years. After that, the year amount is equal to .5 percent of those annual totals.</p>
<p>The permanent casino is expected to have 2,000 gaming seats, an event and convention center, and six restaurants. It’s expected to create about 1,000 full-time jobs or the equivalent. Each full-time employee will make more than $37,000, according to the developer’s submission to the IGC.</p>
<p>Senator: Keeping It Simple Worked</p>
<p>Rockford was the first site approved by the IGB for one of the new casinos allowed under the 2019 expanded gaming law. The board granted preliminary approval in February.</p>
<p>Syverson said the decision to pick a single applicant to present to the state instead of a slate of candidates is paying off.</p>
<p>“While other applications are still pending, we are seeing real progress with the casino, and I am so grateful that we had the community support in this decision,” the senator said.</p>
<p>In late March, the IGB issued a solicitation seeking proposals for a consultant to help analyze bids for the Waukegan and Chicago South Suburbs casinos. On May 25, the board awarded a three-year contract with up to $750,000 to Christiansen Capital Advisors LLC. With renewals, the contract could last for 10 years, according to the state’s award form.</p>
<p>The New York firm was one of four bidders on the project.</p>
