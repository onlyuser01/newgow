<p>The Golden Inn Slot Review</p>
<p>Nucleus Gaming released The Golden Inn in February 2021, after its skilled designers spent their time coming up with the most appealing graphic elements and special features suitable for the popular Irish rainbow/pot of gold theme. The 5×4 video slot incorporates a Free Spins option, next wild, and multiple multipliers ready to carry players closer to the mythical pot of gold than ever.</p>
<p>If you are ready to pay a visit to the iconic Golden Inn and see for yourself if you have been blessed with Irish luck, this is your chance to do it. It’s easy to start rolling in massive riches at the small and charming inn, as long as you know just what to expect. This is where our expertise and personal testing experience come into the picture. We have compiled a comprehensive The Golden Inn online slot review that is ready to be explored. Without further ado, let’s get started.</p>
<p>Theme, Storyline, and Graphics: Take a Seat and Follow the Pot of Gold!</p>
<p>While definitely not a unique theme and storyline to be included in a game of slots, Nucleus’ release does come with a few unique elements that help it stand out. For starters, the action is set on the beautiful Emerald Isle, where the pot of gold is believed to hide right at the end of the rainbow. Of course, the four-leaf clovers add more to the gameplay and promote the charm that the Irish people are known for. The same goes for the leprechaun hats, horseshoes, leprechaun mugs of beer, and single, double, or triple bar icons that crayon the action taking place inside the</p>
<p>Cozy and traditional Irish. The latter is packed with green chairs and plenty of traditional decorations made of wood, alongside tables that are shaped like barrels, and the mugs and whiskey bottles seen scattered all around.</p>
<p>The amazing graphics are, without a doubt, one of the strongest points of the game, helping players get acquainted with the Irish inn atmosphere.</p>
<p>The Golden Inn: Game Symbols and Payouts</p>
<p>The game allows a minimum bet set at 0.10 per game. Players can also opt for the maximum bet of 20 per spin. At least three matching symbols are needed to create a win. The size of the win depends on the chosen stake as well as the exact number of matching symbols. According to the payments displayed in the paytable, five-of-a-kind with a 0.60 bet per spin will result in 6x payout for five pot of gold symbols, 3x for five leprechaun hats, 1.5x for five mugs of beer symbols, 0.90x for five sword hilts, 0.72x for five matching triple bars or five double bars, and 0.48x for five single bar symbols. The lowest-paying symbols are the diamonds, the hearts, and the spades with a payout of 0.30x for five matching symbols, and the clubs with only 0.24x for five symbols.</p>
<p>Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The Golden Inn slot comes with a cheerful Irish soundtrack and cool sound effects engaged once the reels are put in motion and the special symbols start popping up on the grid. The animations are also subtle. The emphasis is put on a series of golden accents including what appears to be golden dust specks that are constantly moving around in the air in the background, signaling the providential Irish luck. The grid also lights up once special symbols are seen making an appearance on the reels, adding more to the dynamics.</p>
<p>The Golden Inn Gameplay</p>
<p>The gameplay is simple, straightforward, and easy to learn and follow even by inexperienced players who are just getting used to the complex scene of online video slots. To get instant access to the paytable, players can click or tap the hamburger menu on the lower left side of the screen. The speaker icon enables fast music muting/unmuting while the “i” tab used by Nucleus Gaming on all of its slots opens a more complex page with additional game options, Autoplay mode, the rules of the game, and, again, the paytable. The sound effects and background music can both be enabled and disabled at any given moment in time. The same goes for Turbo mode which allows players to enjoy the game at a much faster pace. In Autoplay mode, players can select up to 1,000 automatic spins for a minimum cost of $100 up to a maximum of $20,000 for all 1,000 spins.</p>
<p>The game counts 80 fixed paylines and pays left to right. Contiguous pot of gold symbols on one reel stacks in one. To start playing, the left-sided arrow circle must be clicked or tapped. Once this is done, the symbol turns into a square. Players can click it to make the reels stop spinning.</p>
<p>The Golden Inn: Wilds, Scatters, Free Spins &amp; Multipliers</p>
<p>As the Wild symbol in the game, the four-leaf clover is able to substitute all the other symbols with the exception of horseshoe scatters during the base as well as the bonus game.</p>
<p>The scatters are marked through the golden horseshoes. Landing three to five of these will engage the free spins bonus. When engaged in the free spins round, players can benefit from eight, 12, or 20 free games, depending on the initial number of scatters that triggered the bonus round.</p>
<p>During the same free spins games, the clover wild symbols are capable of landing on the grid with the purpose of delivering either 2x or 3x multipliers. It is also possible to land several of these multipliers for a great boost to the potential prize up for grabs.</p>
<p>Final Thoughts</p>
<p>Who wouldn’t love to spend some time in a cozy and charming Irish pub without actually having to travel to Ireland for it? The Golden Inn is packed with overflowing beer, loads of Irish luck symbols, and the most inviting seats you will ever see in a traditional inn. While the theme is not in any way unique, the studio’s approach, excellent graphics, suitable soundtracks, and rewarding bonus features are enough to set the slot apart from its direct competitors.</p>
