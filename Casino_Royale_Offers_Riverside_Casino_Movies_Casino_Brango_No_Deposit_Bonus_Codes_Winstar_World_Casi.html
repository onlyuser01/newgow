<p>Clarion Gaming, the renowned organizer of international gaming events, has announced the addition of Karen Marcela Sierra-Hughes to its prestigious team of ICE Ambassadors.</p>
<p>ICE Ambassador Sierra-Hughes Shapes Latin American Gaming Regulations with Expertise</p>
<p>A highly respected Panamanian attorney with a Master’s degree in commercial law, Sierra-Hughes has been a driving force in the evolution of the Latin American and Caribbean gaming industry, advocating for a regulated sector aligned with international best practices. Her extensive background in gaming regulation has made her a valuable asset in guiding government agencies in Latin America, leading to the implementation of comprehensive and accountable laws and regulations.</p>
<p>Stuart Hunter, the Managing Director of Clarion Gaming, praised Sierra-Hughes’ inclusion in the ICE Ambassador team, stating, “The ICE Ambassador team comprises a corps of international thought leaders drawn from all sectors of the industry who give their time, insight and advice freely. Using her law degree and extensive gaming regulatory experience Karen has helped guide the government agencies in Latin America to improve the regulatory landscape providing advice that has led to comprehensive and responsible laws and regulations.”</p>
<p>Hunter further expressed the team’s delight in welcoming Karen Marcela Sierra-Hughes as an ICE Ambassador during this crucial period with preparations for ICE London 2024 and the inaugural edition of ICE Barcelona in January 2025.</p>
<p>Sierra-Hughes’ diverse perspective, including her previous role as the Legal Director of the Panama Gaming Control Board, positions her as a valuable addition to the ICE Ambassador team. Her insights will be crucial in enhancing the exhibitor experience and catering to the needs of the 45,000+ industry professionals from more than 150 nations expected to attend ICE London 2024.</p>
<p>Gaming Industry Gears Up for ICE London 2024’s Shift to Barcelona</p>
<p>ICE London 2024, the world’s largest gaming industry trade show, is set to host over 600 exhibitors and welcome an estimated 45,000 guests over three days. This event serves as a unique platform for international decision-makers, regulators, operators, and innovators across various gaming sectors and verticals to collaborate, network, and explore innovative opportunities.</p>
<p>In August, Clarion Gaming announced the relocation of ICE and iGB Affiliate conferences from London to Barcelona starting in 2025. The decision, made after considering bids from Madrid, Paris, and London, was based on Barcelona’s world-class facilities, hospitality infrastructure, logistics, and scalability.</p>
<p>The move, facilitated by event specialist Equimore, will establish a partnership between the international gaming industry, Fira de Barcelona, and stakeholders in Spain.</p>
<p>The 2025 edition of ICE is scheduled to take place from January 20 to 22 at the 240,000-square-meter Fira de Barcelona property. Meanwhile, iGB L!VE will move to ExCeL London in 2025 after being previously hosted in Amsterdam. Additionally, Clarion Gaming recently renewed its ICE agreement with the European Casino Association.</p>
