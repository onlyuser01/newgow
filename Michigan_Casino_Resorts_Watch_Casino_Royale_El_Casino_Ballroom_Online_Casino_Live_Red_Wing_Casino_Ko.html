<p>Koray Aldemir Is the Winner of the WSOP Main Event</p>
<p>Nothing says winner like collecting a million-dollar prize from a poker tournament. But how about $8 million? Thatâ€™s not even counting the prestigious WSOP bracelet that 31-year-old Koray Aldemir took home after winning the 2021 World Series of Poker Main Event.</p>
<p>The $10,000 buy-in Main Event generated a prize pool of just over $62 million. However, only the top 1,000 players would receive a piece of the prize pool. Not unexpectedly, a big gap stood between the players that take 10th and 11th place and the player that ranks ninth. The players that take 10th and 11th place would go home with some $585,000, while the ninth player would collect a round $1 million.</p>
<p>To win the tournament, Aldemir had to prove as the best player out of 6,650 entries. According to the WSOP, the German player has had 33 cashes from WSOP tournaments but never before had won a bracelet. Counting the grand $8 million prize that he recently collected, his WSOP earnings have so far surpassed $11 million.</p>
