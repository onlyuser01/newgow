<p>Dallas Mavericks vs Golden State Warriors Game 2 is on the program on Friday evening at Chase Center in San Francisco, California. That’s the place where they played the first game a few days ago, which saw the Warriors win 112-87.</p>
<p>Although they were seen as a huge favorite ahead of the game, not many actually expected them to beat the Mavs by 25 points. In fact, the point spread was set to five points.</p>
<p>This time, the Warriors are seen as 7-point favorites. Are they going to exceed the expectations once again?</p>

<p>Dallas Mavericks Need to Do Better</p>
<p>Luka Doncic did okay in the first game with the Warriors, scoring 20 points – just one fewer than the game’s top-scorer Steph Curry.</p>
<p>Doncic was good, but his teammates were not. Not only did they fail to do much in the offense, but they were also poor in the defense. Still, truth be told, they were expected to fail in Game 1.</p>
<p>After all, the Mavericks’ strength comes from their home performances. On the road, they’re not that great. In fact, the Mavericks are 2-5 on the road in their previous seven away games.</p>
<p>Golden State Warriors Prove They’re Not a One-Man Army</p>
<p>Steph Curry is their best player, but in the first game against the Mavericks, the Golden State Warriors success came from a superb team play. The proof of this is that seven of their players scored double-figures in Game 1.</p>

<p>They’re expected to do great in Game 2 as well. Not only do they seem like a better team than Dallas but they have another major advantage – the game is played at Chase Center.</p>
<p>That’s the place where the Warriors have all wins in the previous nine games, scoring over 100 points in each of those.</p>
<p>Dallas Mavericks vs Golden State Warriors Game 2 Prediction</p>
<p>The Warriors are on the roll. They’re playing fantastic basketball, and with the help of their fans, they should be able to get to 2-0 in the Western Conference Finals. The big question here is whether they’re going to cover the spread? Judging by what we saw from them in the first game, the answer is yes.</p>
<p>Picks: Golden State Warriors to win and cover the spread; over to hit</p>
