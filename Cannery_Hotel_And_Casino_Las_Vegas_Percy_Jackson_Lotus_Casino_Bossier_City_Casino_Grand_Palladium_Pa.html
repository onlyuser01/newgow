<p>Lake of the Torches will allow Passport Technology to set foot in Wisconsin and begin its Midwest journey</p>
<p>Provider of payment technology and customer engagement solutions Passport Technology announced that Lake of the Torches Resort Casino in Wisconsin has selected the combination of Passport’s rewards platform and player enrollment kiosks.</p>
<p>Ready to Spoil Their Partner</p>
<p>The selection of Passport’s Lush loyalty and rewards platform and Mira kiosks for the casino resort owned by the Lac Du Flambeau Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians represent another major development for the payment solutions provider.</p>
<p>Diallo Gordon, chief product and marketing officer for Passport Technology, highlighted Lake of the Torches as “a savvy operator with a high standard for player development and customer engagement.”</p>
<p>“Lake of the Torches has a tremendous product; amazing floor mix, a beautiful resort on the shore of Pokegama Lake, entertainment, food and beverage, and a flurry of new and exciting promotions,” Gordon said, eager to begin the partnership and “spoil them with outstanding service and unique features” that make the Lush platform so effective in driving player acquisition and retention.</p>
<p>As the industry’s first HTML5 cloud-based loyalty and rewards platform, Passport’s Lush provides casino operators with new ways to increase player enrollment, engagement and point of redemption, utilizing customization across branding, gamification, virtual drawings, multipliers, and dynamic offers through a secure web application.</p>
<p>“Passport’s Lush platform has the tools we were looking for to drive brand awareness and reward our players through custom games, promotions, drawings, and gifting,” said Bill Guelcher, chief executive officer of Lake of the Torches Resort Casino, looking forward to enhancing the experience of casino patrons and guests via Passport’s innovative technology.</p>
<p>Self-Service Features, Redemption Portal</p>
<p>Guests of the casino resort will be able to benefit from a number of self-service features provided by the kiosks, including player club enrollment, card reprints, dynamic games and offers, while the industry’s first Earn and Shop redemption portal will allow them to redeem their player points for e-gift cards, physical cards, merchandise or casino inventory.</p>
<p>Lake of the Torches became the first casino to bring Passport’s Lush loyalty and rewards solution to the market in Wisconsin, and Jason King, chief revenue officer of the tech supplier, outlined that the company would be aggressively pursuing to establish its presence in the Midwest, offering its cage automation, redemption, cash access, floor efficiency and cashless solutions.</p>
<p>The agreement with Lake of the Torches made Wisconsin the latest US state to feature Passport Technology’s casino solutions, following just over two months after the tech supplier had set foot in Washington via an agreement with The Point Casino.</p>
