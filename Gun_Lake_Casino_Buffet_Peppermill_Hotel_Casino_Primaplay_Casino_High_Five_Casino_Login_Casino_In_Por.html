    <h1>Gun Lake Casino Buffet Peppermill Hotel Casino Primaplay Casino High Five Casino Login Casino In Por</h1>

<p>Silver Oak casino is a scam and any site that would say otherwise is definitely bogus as well because you didn't do your homework. Since June 11th, when I joined S.O.C, got my bonus NEW75 approved, spun up their playthrough requirements and tried to redeem my $100 max cashout bonus. This is when the B.S.ing started.. i proceeded to withdrawal page. The requirements arent presented to you upfront through this page nor are the withdrawal methods, upfront that is. You have to try to withdrawal first. They claim you can win off no deposit codes and that withdrawaling is fast and easy. Upon trying to withdrawal they'll then give you your requirements. If you go to your transactions page it'll show you that you you claimed a bonus/ it was approved, now you've claimed your winnings of $100. Coupon reversal withdrawal requested -$82.46 and instantaneously Coupon reversal withdrawal approved -$82.46. Nothing could be further from the truth. They present only one method to use after player verification is approved, coindraw. Which they probably own as well. Player identification was one of the easiest to get through, I'll admit. That is comparing them to some of their sister casinos. I haven't had a bitcoin wallet in use so it took a day or so for me to find one I was comfortable with, turns out you can use your cashapp account. I didn't know. So i sent them the $10 btc account verification deposit, which they claim I can get back in full immediately upon redeeming my winnings. I received a confirmation email, 2 actually back to back, 1 saying deposit requested and instantaneously 1 saying approved. I'm like he'll yes, withdrawal balance is up to $111.00 now june 13th, I don't know where the extra dollar came from but alright. So I try redeeming my winnings a second time. Coindraw is the only method available to me, since that's how I deposited money to them thru the address they provided. Now that they have my address I figured it can't take more than the 2 hours it took them to receive and approve the deposit. Again nothing could be further from the truth. So 2 days later the 14th I send an email, besides the deposit approval, ive sent 2 by now and filled out their janky chat page. Which reminds me if you try to call them itll ask for your access code that you havent been given. Also their "live chat" you can fill out and wait for an email back, i guess they dont know what "live chat" actually means, that there tells me their scandalous or maybe just a lower form of intellectual beings, anyways filled that out 6xs now havent heard squat., Back to my email; "just a reminder I did your requirements, you deposited my $10 btc, it showed I had $110 withdrawal, I withdrawal the whole thing sent some emails and filled out your "live chat" 2xs, still haven't heard from anyone and nothing is showing up on my transactions page beyond you depositing my $10 btc wallet confirmation. Think I can get my money back and my winnings that's June 14. On June 16th 1:22am, exactly 72hrs after reclaiming my winnings they cancel my coindraw request instead of approving it and instantaneously in that same minute, it shows manager requested withdraw $100 requested, manager requested withdrawal approved, coindraw withdrawal requested $11.00 and coindraw withdrawal approved $11.00. So they next day I see the cashapp message $12.00 deposited in my account. Even I can figure out that due to bitcoins rising "stock", this is why my $10 turned into$12 through these processing times, but where's my $100 winnings. I've sent probably 6 emails and hit their "live chat" up about the same amount of times now being real cordial for most of those. Still haven't received not a single email since them approving my original $10 deposit, not one. Even though their live chat says guaranteed someone will be with you within 48 hrs or less. Guaranteed this casino doesn't honor their bonuses and guaranteed this casino is a fraud. I'm guessing all or most of their sister casinos are the same way. If I was a betting man which I'm not, I would have to say if you want real money back luckylands, chumba, or orion stars have been the only legit ones I've found, so far that is. Silver Oak Casino? Fraud</p>
