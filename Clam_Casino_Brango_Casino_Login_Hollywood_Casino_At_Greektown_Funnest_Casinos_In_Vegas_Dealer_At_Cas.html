<p>Cross-platform global game company Light &amp; Wonder announced that its OpenGaming platform has partnered with White Hat Studios to launch the game developer’s content live in Michigan and become its exclusive aggregation partner in the US.</p>
<p>Choice of Aggregation Partner ‘Crucial’</p>
<p>The launch of White Hat Studios’ content live in the state of Michigan via integration with Light &amp; Wonder’s OpenGaming platform has significantly increased the lure of Light &amp; Wonder as an aggregator, bringing top-performing UK titles to players in Michigan.</p>
<p>White Hat Studios chief executive officer Andy Whitworth outlined that for the game developer studio from the very moment of its inception, “the right choice of aggregation platform partner” was considered “crucial for speed to market in the US,” happy to bring the studios content to players in Michigan and continue with plans to go live in Pennsylvania and New Jersey shortly after.</p>
<p>“OpenGaming has an unrivaled distribution network and scalability, which will prove vital assets as we continue to roll out from state to state in the coming months,” Whitworth continued, hailing the Michigan launch as “the latest significant step on this exciting journey.”</p>
<p>Following the launch in the Great Lakes State, operator partners of Light &amp; Wonder’s OpenGaming aggregation platform can now offer their players a taste of iconic, feature-rich titles such as Ted, Deal or no Deal and Beavis and Butthead that already proved to be hugely successful across markets in Europe and the UK, as well as the quality land-based inspired content by Mercur Gaming and Reel Time Gaming.</p>
<p>Titles Bound for Success</p>
<p>For Steve Mayes, partnership director at Light &amp; Wonder, there is no doubt that the gaming content that “has long been among the top performing” across regulated markets in Europe and North America will “prove hugely popular” in the US.</p>
<p>Hailing the importance of the deal with White Hat Studios, Mayes outlined that it is expected to help Light &amp; Wonder further enhance its platform’s strong position in a market that is still to reach its full potential.</p>
<p>“The portfolio we have access to is incredible and it’s a great moment for us to be able to take this first step in a larger roll-out by putting it before players in Michigan,” he concluded.</p>
<p>The launch in Michigan is just the first of many as the goal is to take via the OpenGaming platform White Hat Studios titles live across all regulated states in the US within the next twelve months.</p>
<p>The content brought to OpenGaming partners under the deal includes the ground-breaking Jackpot Royale jackpot offering, as well as a catalog of games and RGS White Hat Studios acquired from Blueprint Gaming last year.</p>
<p>The addition of White Hat Studios titles to the OpenGaming platform would further boost the platform’s offering of more than 3,500 games developed by a global network of in-house and third-party studios, and will affirm Light &amp; Wonder’s position as the leading cross-platform game company.</p>
