Drop The Balls is a game that lottery players of all ages will enjoy, and we are excited to be launching it with the Washington DC Lottery.“ Ben Sutherland, CEO at Greentube USA</p>
<p>To propel its growth in the US market, Greentube USA continues to collaborate with EQL’s RGS aggregation platform.
