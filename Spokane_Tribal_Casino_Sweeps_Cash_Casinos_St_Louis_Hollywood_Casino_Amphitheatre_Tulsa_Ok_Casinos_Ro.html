    <h1>Spokane Tribal Casino Sweeps Cash Casinos St Louis Hollywood Casino Amphitheatre Tulsa Ok Casinos Ro</h1>

<p>My 1 win account I'd is 50449268 ,</p>
<p>I have created the account in October 2023 I don't remember the exact date ,</p>
<p>Hardly they allow me 10 day's to use their platform,</p>
<p>First time when I withdraw the amount of â‚¹5000 , they didn't proceed the withdrawal so i contacted to 1win security team on e-mail , they said I need to submit KYC documents , I agreed on that I submitted the KYC documents, so I continued the 1win platform , but after few Days again' they stopped the withdrawal and blocked my account now' I'm not able login to my account ,then again I asked to 1win team via email 1win security ,</p>
<p>They stated this reason ðŸ‘‡</p>
<p>The account was blocked in accordance with clause 9.7 of the rules:</p>
<p>In accordance with clause 9.7. Rules for using the site, section General Terms and Conditions (hereinafter referred to as the Rules), if a bettor commits fraudulent actions against a bookmaker company (multi-account, use of software to automate bets, playing in arbitrage situations, if the game account is not used to place bets, abuse of loyalty programs, etc.), then the bookmaker company reserves the right to stop such fraudulent actions by canceling bets and closing the bettorâ€™s gaming account.</p>
<p>This is absolutely 100% false accusations on Me, I did not use any multiple accounts, I have only one account at 1win platform , I had played evaluation live casino game's, you can check my game history , I asked 1win team 10 Times for the evidence on email but they didn't reply at all, i always play with loyalty sometimes I lose some Times I win game , but blocking my account with false reason I'm not going to accept this , I'm a youtuber ,if my account will not get unblock I will give the feedback of my experience with evidence, so other users will be aware</p>
<p>I request to Casino guru team please ask them for the evidence , and share me as well</p>
<p>Looking forward for your reply</p>
