<p>The Fanatics Sportsbook is officially live in Virginia as of Nov. 21, 2023. The entry is among the emerging sportsbook’s most critical states, as the commonwealth is home to about 8.7 million residents, many of whom live in some of the wealthiest counties in the entire U.S.</p>

<p>Fanatics told Casino.org on Tuesday that its sportsbook app is up and running on iOS and Android. Virginia marks the seventh state where the Fanatics Sportsbook platform has launched following Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Ohio, Tennessee, and West Virginia.</p>
<p>The Fanatics Sportsbook bills itself as “the most rewarding online sportsbook.” To commemorate its debut in Virginia, Fanatics bettors this week will receive a “Rewards Surge,” where they’ll receive up to 5% back in FanCash, the sportsbook’s loyalty program. FanCash can be used for bonus bets or for eligible merchandise on Fanatics.com.</p>
<p>Founded in 2011 by Michael Rubin, Fanatics is an American manufacturer and online retailer of licensed sportswear for the NFL, MLB, NBA, NHL, Formula 1, and NASCAR. In May, Fanatics agreed to acquire PointsBet’s struggling U.S. sports betting business for $225 million. The offer beat out DraftKings’ $195 million tender.</p>
<p>Account Migrations</p>
<p>Former PointsBet users in Virginia must download the Fanatics Sportsbook app to continue their online wagering. Once downloaded and installed, users can login into their Fanatics betting accounts with the same credentials they used on PointsBet.</p>
<p>The launch comes just in time for a busy sports calendar over the long Thanksgiving holiday weekend. The turkey day sports smorgasbord includes a full slate of college hoops and three NFL games — the Green Bay Packers vs. the Detroit Lions, the Washington Commanders vs. the Dallas Cowboys, and the San Francisco 49ers vs. the Seattle Seahawks.</p>
<p>The Fanatics Sportsbook launch in Virginia comes a week after Fanatics debuted its sportsbook and online casino products in West Virginia, which is one of only six states where iGaming with interactive slots and table games is permitted.</p>
<p>DraftKings and FanDuel are the biggest players in the legal U.S. sports betting industry, with respective market shares of about 45% and 32%. BetMGM is third at roughly 10%, and Caesars Sportsbook is fourth at 6%. That’s according to SportsPro Media, a London-based analytical firm focused on sports-specific industries.</p>
<p>Fanatics Sportsbook controls a smaller percentage of the market. But analysts believe the firm has room for growth because of the company’s extensive database of merchandise customers, many of whom could be converted into bettors.</p>
<p>Responsible Gaming Initiative</p>
<p>In addition to announcing its Virginia sports betting commencement, Fanatics Sportsbook told Casino.org that the sports betting firm is partaking in a new responsible gaming campaign. Fanatics, along with DraftKings, FanDuel, and ESPN Bet, debuted its responsible gaming campaign targeting the NBA, NHL, and NHL last night during TNT’s NBA coverage.</p>
<p>Called “Never Know What’s Next,” the first 30-second commercial encourages bettors to participate responsibly.</p>
<p>We love the game because anything can happen,” the spot begins with a narrated voiceover. “There’s no sure thing. Every play, every shot, every swing is a risk if you bet. There’s no easy money. There’s no lock. And no one wins all the time.”</p>
<p>“So, if you bet, bet responsibly, and always set a limit,” the PSA concludes.</p>
