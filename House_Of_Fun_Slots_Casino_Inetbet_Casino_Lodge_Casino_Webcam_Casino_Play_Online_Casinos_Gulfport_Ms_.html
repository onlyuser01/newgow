<p>Fantasma Games, a well-known slot developer, has shared its report for the second quarter of 2022. According to the report, the company’s YoY GGR has increased by a staggering 314% and its net sales surged by 396%.</p>
<p>The Developer Had Several Significant Events in Q2</p>
<p>The quarter was labeled by Fantasma as busy as it had tons of events. First, the founder of the company, Fredrik Johansson, took over as CEO. It also recorded record monthly revenue in May and the company expanded in Canada, Italy and the US.</p>
<p>In terms of numbers, Fantasma’s net sales reached SEK7.5 million ($755,000). Gaming revenue reached SEK6.3 million ($625,000) and EBITDA amounted to SEK1.1 million ($109,000).</p>
<p>Moreover, the organic turnover through Fantasma Games reached SEK5.4 million ($536,000). Acquired growth, through Weiner Games, was SEK2.1 million ($208,000). One of the significant milestones of the quarter was the fact that the total game turnover was SEK1.44 billion ($14.5 million), which is a 120% YoY increase.</p>
<p>In its official report, Fantasma noted that the second quarter of 2022 is “very successful and eventful” for both Fantasma and the group. Johansson noted that the growth rate is well above the company’s long-term financial goal of 30%.</p>
<p>He also added that Fantasma will most likely achieve its goal of connecting 250 qualitative operators with the company until the end of next year.</p>
<p>Fantasma Released a New Game in Collaboration With Flutter Entertainment</p>
<p>Just after the successful quarter was closed, Fantasma made sure that it remained busy. Recently the company launched a new game called Cloud Corsairs in collaboration with Flutter Entertainment. Cloud Corsairs was primarily released on the English market.</p>
<p>After it was rolled out on July 19 to operators such as Paddy Power, Sky Betting &amp; Gaming, Pokerstars and Betfair, the game was globally released on August 2. It was made available to all operators supplied by Light &amp; Wonders (ex: Scientific Games) which offered online casino products in regulated markets in Canada, the US and Europe.</p>
<p>Johansson noted that Fantasma is delighted to have the opportunity to work with Flutter, a leading gambling company in the UK market. He also added that the new game is a testament to the fact that Fantasma is dedicated to providing top-rated products and the launch across Europe will strengthen the company’s position and broaden its network.</p>
<p>The US has also been the focus of Fantasma as its games debuted on BetMGM’s casino platform in Michigan and West Virginia. The first games that players in these states will be able to enjoy are Wins of Nautilus Megaways and Bounty Showdown and the rest of the products will be made available via Fantasma’s US distributing partner, Light &amp; Wonders.</p>
