    <h1>Grand Falls Casino Iowa Best Casino In Biloxi Pennsylvania Online Casinos Paragon Casino Resort Mark</h1>

<p>Dear Max,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. Before we’ll contact the casino and ask for their standpoint, could you please forward emails or screenshots showing that you have sent requests for a self-exclusion? My email address is petronela.k@casino.guru. Did you specify in those requests for how long you wish your account to be closed and why?</p>
<p>I have checked terms and conditions, and this is what I found https://www.select.bet/en/pages/responsible-gaming:</p>
<p>„Select.bet allows its customers to self-exclude themselves from their accounts in the website for time periods of 6 months to 5 years.</p>
<p>The moment such modification is enforced on the account for a requested by the customer period, there will not be a possibility for that account to be reactivated under any circumstance unless the agreed upon period has expired.</p>
<p>An account is considered as simply closed if a customer did not specify the reason or the period, which they want for their account to be closed. In such cases, that account can be reopened at any point in time, upon a request from the customer in question.</p>
<p>Note:</p>
<p>• Such requests will only be considered if they are sent from the e-mail the customer in question used to register to the Select.bet site.</p>
<p>• A self–exclusion and account closure requests are considered to be fulfilled only after the receipt of a confirmation e-mail from Select.bet's customer support team.</p>
<p>• Select.bet is not to be held liable for any future accounts the self-excluded customer opens on the site. In those cases, where the self-excluded customer manages to bypass the Select.bet systems, no refunds will be processed.</p>
<p>Should you require more information on this, please feel free to contact our operators by live chat or e-mail, we would be happy to provide you with the answers you seek.</p>
<p>Select.bet does not fulfill requests for deposit limits on its customers’ accounts for any payment method, amounts or periods of time."</p>
<p>support@select.bet</p>
<p>Is this the email address that you have sent the emails to?</p>
<p>I hope we will be able to help you to resolve this issue as soon as possible. Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
