    <h1>Station Casinos Login Lake Tahoe Casinos Hotels Viejas Casino And Resort Online Casino Slots Casino</h1>

<p>Dear Ivonne,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about the issue and understand your frustration.</p>
<p>I carefully checked the Bonus Terms on the website, and this is what I found https://www.spinmillion13.com/en/terms-and-conditions:</p>
<p>„Players are allowed to place single bets lower than 20% of the total value of the Active Bonus credited and should not exceed 8 EUR, 8 USD, 8AUD, 8CAD, 80 SEK, 80 NOK, 580 RUB (as applicable). Therefore, placing a bet of 8 EUR while there’s an Active Bonus of 100 EUR in effect is considered acceptable practice."</p>
<p>We would like to see casinos implementing systems that would prevent players from placing higher than allowed bets, but, unfortunately, this is not a standard practice yet. You were not stopped or blocked when you decided to increase your bet, and, as a result, you breached the maximum bet rule.</p>
<p>If you are aware of placing higher bets than the allowed ones, sadly, there is not much we can do to support your case at this time. I would strongly recommend reading all the T&amp;Cs carefully before you start playing to avoid any misunderstandings in the future. Casinos try to design their bonuses to be as attractive as possible, but the rules must always be followed.</p>
<p>Please do not hesitate to forward your game history along with any relevant communication to petronela.k@casino.guru if you feel that you’ve been accused mistakenly, otherwise, I will be forced to reject your complaint. Thank you in advance for your reply and understanding.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
