    <h1>Sunscape Curacao Resort Spa Casino Fort Lauderdale Seminole Hard Rock Hotel Casino Nassau Casino Hot</h1>

<p>Dear Dami92,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. I have checked the Responsible Gaming section, and this is what I found https://www.n1casino.com/responsible-gaming:</p>
<p>"What is Self-exclusion?</p>
<p>Setting Self-exclusion lets us know that we need to take all measures to block your access to your account and make sure that you receive no promotional materials. You may also contact our support team at support@n1casino.com and inform us about your decision to stop gambling at the Website for a certain period of time or forever.</p>
<p>Please note that if you are self excluded from the casino for indefinite period of time, the funds remaining on balance will be paid according to the casino limits. If you are self excluded for a definite period of time, the funds remaining on balance will be paid according to the casino limits only when a period of self exclusion expires."</p>
<p>Could you please forward any relevant communication between you and the casino to petronela.k@casino.guru? Did you specify in your self-exclusion request for how long you wish your account to be closed and clearly stated the reason why? Please understand that if you self-exclude yourself from one casino it doesn’t necessarily means that you are protected on all the other associated websites.</p>
<p>Looking forward to hearing from you.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
