    <h1>Casino In Boston The Lodge At Cliff Castle Casino Catfish Bend Casino Burlington Iowa Bicycle Casino</h1>

<p>Pariplay, the leading iGaming content supplier and NeoGames S.A subsidiary, announced it clinched a new partnership, growing its footprint in New Jersey. On Monday, the company confirmed it joined forces with PlayStar, a leading online casino operator. Under the terms of the freshly minted agreement, Pariplay agreed to supply games for the operator.</p>
<p>Through the company's Fusion aggregation platform, a wide range of engaging and quality slots have become available for PlayStar customers in New Jersey. The latest partnership complements an ongoing goal for the operator to offer exceptional experiences to its growing number of clients. Moreover, the deal supports PlayStar's plans for further expansion in the sector.</p>
<p>While the partnership strengthens the operator's offering, it also complements Pariplay's expansion across North America. Thanks to the latest agreement, more customers in New Jersey will be able to tap into the thrilling experiences the company's leading titles offer.</p>
<p>Dan Alexander, PlayStar's CCO, shared his excitement about the new deal with Pariplay in a statement. "It is fantastic to be able to present our players with a wealth of new content thanks to this launch in New Jersey," he explained. Additionally, Alexander pointed out: "We have big ambitions across North America and look forward to seeing how our customers react to the engaging, entertaining experiences that are now available to them."</p>
<p>Shivan Patel, Pariplay's Vice President of North America, added: "Expanding our reach across North America remains a key priority, and this launch with PlayStar represents another major milestone in our commitment to delivering the very best content to players in the region." Finally, Patel said: "PlayStar has already made waves in New Jersey since its launch last year and we are thrilled to establish what Iâ€™m sure will be a very positive partnership."</p>
<p>Under the terms of the new collaboration, PlayStar's players will be able to access quality games from Pariplay's in-house studio, Wizard Games. As a result, top-performing titles such as Wolf Riches, Spirit of Mustang and Dragons of the North, among others have already gone live. Moreover, customers of the operator will also be able to tap into games delivered by developers via Pariplay's Ignite platform.</p>
<p>Earlier this month the company confirmed it expanded its Ignite roster after forging a partnership with 916 Gaming, a leading provider of online casino games. As a result of the new deal, 916 Gaming's titles are expected to reach new customers across the globe with the help of Pariplay's extensive network.</p>
