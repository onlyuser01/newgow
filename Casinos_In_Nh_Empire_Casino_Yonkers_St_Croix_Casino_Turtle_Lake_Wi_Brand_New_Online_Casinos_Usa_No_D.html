<p>The two executives will share the stage with American Gaming Association President and CEO Bill Miller on Oct. 12, according to a G2E release on Friday. Morgan, a former chair of the Nevada Gaming Control Board and once a Caesars Entertainment board member, will lead a discussion on the evolving relationship between sports and gaming.</p>
<p>Nardini, a former marketing executive at AOL, Yahoo, and Microsoft, will talk with Miller about Barstool’s relationship with Penn Entertainment. That company now owns 100% of the sports media outlet focused on Gen Z and Millennials, and how Barstool engages with fans.</p>
<p>The G2E main stage has a legacy of featuring dynamic leaders and thought-provoking conversations, and this year is no different,” Miller said in a statement. “I am eager to welcome the global gaming community to G2E 2022 with an energized expo hall, pre-pandemic attendee demand and compelling conference program.”</p>
<p>G2E runs from Oct. 10-13 at The Venetian Expo in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>Tribal Gaming Keynote Set for Oct. 10</p>
<p>Also announced on Friday, Indian Gaming Association Chairman Ernie Stevens will headline a tribal gaming discussion on the expo’s opening day, which also coincides with Indigenous Peoples’ Day.</p>
<p>Joining Stevens on the stage will be former Colorado US Sen. Ben Nighthorse Campbell, the last Native American elected to the Senate, Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians Chairman Reid D. Milanovich, and Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe Indians Melanie Benjamin.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, G2E announced its other keynote. On Oct. 12, six leading gaming executives will discuss with CNBC’s Contessa Brewer key topics within the industry.</p>
<p>Bally’s Corp. Chairman Soo Kim and Penn Entertainment President Jay Snowden will discuss regional gaming issues. Wynn Resorts CEO Craig Billings and Circa Resort and Casino Owner and CEO Derek Stevens will discuss gaming in Las Vegas and Nevada.</p>
<p>FanDuel CEO Amy Howe and DraftKings cofounder and CEO Jason Robins will give their insights on what they see as the future for sports betting and iGaming.</p>
<p>Leading into that packed keynote, Miller will give his state of the industry speech.</p>
<p>About G2E</p>
