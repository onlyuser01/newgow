<p>Macau casino workers may be dismissed without cause in the future if concessionaires are being suspended from operating for one month to one year due to non-compliance, according to the proposed amendments to the Gaming Law, revealed local news outlet Inside Asia Gaming.</p>
<p>Compensation for Concessionaires if Contract Suspended</p>
<p>The Macau Legislative Assembly continued to discuss the proposed amendments to the Gaming Law this week and its Second Standing Committee had its second meeting Tuesday, May 17. Following the meeting, the committee’s chairman Chan Chak Mo revealed details of the discussion at a press conference.</p>
<p>The members of the committee discussed the new provisions proposed by the government related to the right of the Chief Executive to unilaterally terminate a concessionaire’s contract in the public interest and how employee dismissal should be treated in such cases, Chan Chak revealed.</p>
<p>Currently, the Gaming Law provides for the Chief Executive to unilaterally terminate a concessionaire’s contract if the continuation of operation is deemed as a threat to the security of the state and the Macau Special Administrative Region (SAR).</p>
<p>In such cases, the government will thoroughly assess the seriousness and extent of a violation and the unlawful benefit obtained, as well as any other factor that may weigh on the decision to terminate the contract, and if a concessionaire is having its contract suspended, it is not entitled to any compensation.</p>
<p>According to the new amendment to the Gaming Law proposed by the government, if the Chief Executive unilaterally terminates a concessionaire’s contract, the concessionaire will be entitled to reasonable compensation calculated based on the remaining time of the contract and the investment made.</p>
<p>Cap Rule of Table Games and Slots Misunderstood</p>
<p>The chairman of the committee also provided reporters with additional explanations related to the information released after the committee’s Monday meeting, namely the cap on table games and slot machines for concessionaires.</p>
<p>Chan Chak cited government sources to showcase a previous misunderstanding according to which the Chief Executive will determine the maximum table games and slot machines for each concessionaire. Instead, it is the total for all concessionaires that the Chief Executive will determine.</p>
<p>During the second meeting of the committee since the government had submitted its amendment proposals for consideration, members of the committee discussed the proposal that will allow the government to alter, based on the economic conditions, the minimum gross gaming revenue required for each concessionaire.</p>
<p>Previously, the Second Standing Committee of the Legislative Assembly assessed the possibility of introducing tax breaks for concessionaires who attract foreign players to their venues.</p>
