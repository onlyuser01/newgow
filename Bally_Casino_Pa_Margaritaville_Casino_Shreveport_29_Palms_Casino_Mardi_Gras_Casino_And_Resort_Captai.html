<p>If you need a wide receiver for your fantasy football team, take a look at potential Week 2 waiver wire pickups, including Puka Nacua (Los Angeles Rams), Kendrick Bourne (New England Patriots), and Zay Jones (Jacksonville Jaguars).</p>

<p>There’s plenty of options to upgrade your team or bolster your bench. Approximately 40 wide receivers posted double-digits fantasy points in the opening week of the NFL season.</p>
<p>Jakobi Meyers (Las Vegas Raiders), Rashid Shaheed (New Orleans Saints), Romeo Doubs (Green Bay Packers), and Allen Robinson II (Pittsburgh Steelers) could be worthy additions to your fantasy football squad, especially if you play in a league that has 12 or more teams.</p>
<p>Puka Nacua (WR, Rams)</p>
<p>The Rams were a +5 road underdog in Week 1, and defeated the Seattle Seahawks by 17 points. Quarterback Matthew Stafford struggled with injuries last season, but he looked like the slick gunslinger who led the Rams to a Super Bowl in 2021. Stafford unleashed 38 pass attempts for 334 passing yards in the season opener.</p>
<p>All-Pro wide receiver Cooper Kupp is nursing a hamstring injury and he began the season on the IL. The outlook seemed grim entering Week 1 because the young Rams’ wideouts lacked experience. The vibes vastly improved when Puka Nacua and Tutu Atwell played liked seasoned veterans in a big divisional win over the Seahawks. Atwell caught six passes for 119 yards. Nacua, a rookie from BYU, was targeted 15 times by Stafford. He caught 10 passes for 119 yards in his NFL debut.</p>
<p>Oddsmakers thought the Rams would barely win six games this season. But they looked like they could be the second-best team in the NFC West after an impressive road win in Seattle. The Rams battle another divisional rival in Week 2 when they host the San Francisco 49ers.</p>
<p>Second-year running back Kyren Williams also had a strong performance for the Rams against the Seahawks. Williams and Nacua are popular waiver wire pickups heading into Week 2.</p>
<p>Kendrick Bourne (WR, Patriots)</p>
<p>The Patriots now have Bill O’Brien as their new offensive coordinator, and Bourne benefited the most from the coaching change. For an unknown reason, Bourne was in ex-OC’s Matt Patrica’s doghouse last season. After just one game in 2023, O’Brien figured out a way to utilize Bourne’s skills.</p>
<p>Quarterback Mac Jones connected on six passes to Bourne out of 11 potential targets in a loss against the Philadelphia Eagles. Bourne contributed 64 receiving yards and two touchdowns in Week 1. In 2022, Bourne caught just 35 passes and one touchdown with the Patriots.</p>
<p>The Patriots started the season with a loss. They were expected to finish in last place in the AFC East, but the New York Jets look like they’re in for a bumpy season after Aaron Rodgers tore his Achilles tendon. The Patriots are still a long shot to win the division at +900 odds, and the Jets slipped to +600.</p>
<p>Zay Jones (WR, Jaguars)</p>
<p>Quarterback Trevor Lawrence did not waste any time establishing a strong rapport with Calvin Ridley in Week 1’s victory for the Jaguars. Ridley earned a one-year suspension for violating the NFL’s gambling policy. But he looked sharp in his return, with eight catches for 101 yards and one touchdown.</p>
<p>Christian Kirk thought he’d be battling Ridley for the WR #1 spot. But Kirk might be the third option on the Jaguars right now. Kirk caught only one pass for nine yards.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Lawrence targeted Jones seven times in Week 1. Jones caught five passes for 55 yards and one touchdown.</p>
<p>The Jaguars meet the Kansas City Chiefs in Week 2, and oddsmakers expect a shootout. That matchup is one of two games in Week 2 with a betting total that exceeds 50 points.</p>
<p>The Jaguars were the consensus preseason favorite to win the AFC South at -155 odds. After a victory against the Indianapolis Colts in Week 1, the Jaguars saw an odds bump to -190 to win the division.</p>
<p>Meyers, Robinson, Shaheed, and Doubs</p>
<p>Jakobi Meyers from the Las Vegas Raiders emerged as a favorite target for quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo. Garoppolo targeted Meyers ten times against the Denver Broncos in Week 1. He snagged nine catches for 81 yards and two touchdowns. Davante Adams is listed as WR #1 on the roster, but he only caught six passes for 66 yards and no touchdowns.</p>
<p>Rashid Shaheed began this season as WR #3 with the New Orleans Saints. With opposing defenses trying to shut down Chris Olave and Michael Thomas, Rice has been able to get open. Quarterback Derek Carr targeted Rice six times in Week 1. Rice hauled in five catches for 89 yards and one touchdown.</p>
<p>Romeo Doubs from the Green Bay Packers earned the trust of Aaron Rodgers last year during his rookie season. The Packers have a new starting quarterback this season with Jordan Love, and Love hooked up with Doubs for two scores in Week 1. During an impressive victory against the Chicago Bears, Doubs caught four passes for 26 yards and two touchdowns.</p>
<p>Allen Robinson II from the Pittsburgh Steelers will also get a lot of attention because of an injury to teammate Diontae Johnson. Johnson exited Week 1 with a strained hamstring and could miss multiple games. Robinson was targeted eight times by Kenny Pickett, and he snagged five catches for 64 yards. If you drafted Johnson and have faith in Pickett as a quarterback, then Robinson could be a worthy short-term replacement.</p>
