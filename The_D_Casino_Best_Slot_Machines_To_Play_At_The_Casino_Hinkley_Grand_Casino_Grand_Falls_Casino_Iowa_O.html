    <h1>The D Casino Best Slot Machines To Play At The Casino Hinkley Grand Casino Grand Falls Casino Iowa O</h1>

<p>Hello.</p>
<p>This Casino has rejected my passport although It was a valide document in order to prove my Identity.</p>
<p>They rejected it twice. I called them over the phone and they were insisting to retrieve two documents proving my Identity as I quote them « the passport is not enough. We need your Id card too ».</p>
<p>With them delaying my verification, I lost all my balance. Then, suddenly, the next day, they told me that my account is verified and that the passport is good enough.</p>
<p>I am honestly feeling that they did all this on the sole purpose of jinxing me up. Also, they would have never paid me as long as I would not have provided an ID card additionally to my passport.</p>
<p>When I called them, they hanged up. When I contact them by email, they don’t answer.</p>
<p>Thing is that they said my ID Card (which was expired since a year ago) needed to be renew. But they were keeping paying me out like two months ago…</p>
<p>It’s a pure scam. There’s no other words.</p>
