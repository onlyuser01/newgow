    <h1>Hinckley Casino Yakama Legends Casino Havasu Landing Resort Casino Casino Near Yosemite Doubledown C</h1>

<p>Hi! I've been trying to withdraw my money at this casino for over 3 months now.</p>
<p>I had deposited €25, rolled it up to €100 and withdrawn.</p>
<p>However, since I was no longer sure whether I had given the correct Bitcoin address for the payout, I canceled the payout.</p>
<p>As a result, a bonus was credited to me FULLY AUTOMATICALLY after cancellation, which means that I suddenly had €200.</p>
<p>So I had the bonus of €100 deleted IMMEDIATELY in live support, because I ONLY wanted to pay out and was never interested in this bonus.</p>
<p>So far so good. The supporter then helped me to delete the unwanted €100 bonus because I ONLY wanted to pay out and was never interested in this bonus.</p>
<p>Now, however, I can no longer withdraw the €100 that was already in the withdrawal process, because the system has also added a new "wager" (wagering requirement) with the automatic bonus.</p>
<p>I've been writing back and forth with support for 3-4 months now. The live support always means that only my account manager can help me in this case, or that of course it shouldn't have happened like that.</p>
<p>When the account manager finally gets back to me after 10-14 business days, I always get more or less the same answer, no matter how many times I talk to live support beforehand.</p>
<p>" All deposits must have at least one (1X) wager on the sum of the amount deposited to be eligible for a withdrawal"</p>
<p>Since I deposited €25 in cash WITHOUT A BONUS and played it up to €100 without a bonus, my collar is slowly bursting...</p>
<p>Could you possibly help me with that? I'm starting to despair of this support/casino</p>
