<p>BetMGM adds Pittsburgh Steelers as its latest National Football League (NFL) partner and ahead of an anticipated launch in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh Steelers Secure BetMGM as First Gaming Partner</p>
<p>National Football League (NFL) franchise the Pittsburgh Steelers revealed an exciting new partnership on Tuesday with BetMGM, the namesake brand’s sports betting mobile app. Effectively, BetMGM will be the Pittsburgh Steelers’ first gaming partner, but far from the first partner for the league as a whole.</p>
<p>As part of the agreement, the Steelers and BetMGM will work on various fan-focused initiatives, including the Steelers Kickoff pregame show, team broadcast programing, in-stadium signage, and various digital marketing assets shared on social media and other available channels.</p>
<p>Commenting on this partnership, Pittsburgh Steelers Vice President of Sales and Marketing Ryan Huzjak had this to add:</p>
<p>“Not only will BetMGM be elevating some of our existing platforms, but they will be introducing new opportunities to Steelers fans.”</p>
<p>BetMGM also stands to benefit from the agreement. As the official partner for the franchise, BetMGM will be able to leverage the Pittsburg Steelers’ intellectual property in the form of logos and other graphic materials, and share it across social media as well as use it in marketing communications.</p>
<p>Ample Programming and Fan-Focused Initiatives</p>
<p>More interesting aspects of the deal include but aren’t limited to the gameday and weekly media, including “The Point After,” “Players Show,” “Preview Show” and “In the Locker Room Show with Tunch &amp; Wolf” programming designed to bring fans closet to their favorite team.</p>
<p>There will be various other initiatives, including a TV commercial spot during the weekly press conference by Mike Tomlin held on Tuesdays. Two other programming opportunities include the “Steelers Weekly” and “Mike Tomlin” shows.</p>
<p>An exciting fan initiative includes the “Decade of Black &amp; Gold” which will elect one winner who will then receive two club level season tickets and two special VIP Hospitality Tent Passes available for a period of 10 years, so the lucky winner may never miss out on a game should they choose not to.</p>
<p>BetMGM Chief Revenue Officer Matt Prevost was just as excited with the news, arguing that Steelers Nation was one of the most active and passionate fan bases in the NFL. Prevost said that he could not think of another great partner to team up with in the NFL at this point.</p>
<p>Speaking of partnerships, BetMGM already has many strategic agreements with a number of NFL franchises, to name the Denver Broncos, Detroit Lions, Tennessee Titans, and Las Vegas Raiders.</p>
<p>The company has been quite busy on all fronts, rolling the red carpet for BetMGM app in Tennessee, Colorado, Indiana, Mississippi, Nevada, New Jersey, and West Virginia. To continue consolidating its professional footprint, BetMGM secured the talent of Andrew Hagopian, former Chief Corporate Counsel of MGM Resorts, and the company introduced a special multi-state player protection solution just yesterday.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the company is pending launch in Pennsylvania after receiving approval from the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board (PGCB) earlier this month.</p>
