    <h1>Casino Phoenix Anonymous Casino Fortune Casino Login Remington Park Casino Monte Carlo Casino Monaco</h1>

<p>Along with saying hello I will explain my problem, I came to this casino because it was sponsored by a streamer, zero problems depositing and playing the available slots. My surprise was when I wanted to withdraw my earned money today, 01/17/2022, first they do not have the same way of withdrawing as depositing, I understand this, the problem is that I made a deposit of $10,000 clp with astropay (I made the deposit before wanting to withdraw the money), to be able to register this payment method and thus make my withdrawal, to my surprise they only let you withdraw the money that you have deposited with that payment method, no more.</p>
<p>A casino is a world of bets, in which you can have losses as profits, how is it possible that they do not let you withdraw "winnings"? If I deposit $100,000 can I only withdraw $100,000 and the rest what? I will never be able to withdraw more than I deposited unless I have losses and deposit again and thus generate a higher limit than I can withdraw, I really find it an abuse in their terms and conditions, they literally will never lose with no client who plays on your page.</p>
<p>I hope you can help me and if nothing can be done, leave this as a review for future clients and they don't feel cheated, which is how I'm feeling right now.</p>
<p>Have a nice day</p>
<p>bye.</p>
