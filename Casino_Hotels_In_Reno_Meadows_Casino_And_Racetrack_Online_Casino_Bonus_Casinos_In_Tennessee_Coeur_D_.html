<p>The 2022 SBC Summit Barcelona set a new attendance record and made a lasting impression on delegates of the industry event that took place over the three days last month.</p>
<p>Making Lasting Impression</p>
<p>The biggest-to-date SBC event which took place at Fira Barcelona Montjuic September 20-22 featured an exhibition comprising 200 booths, two days of high-level conferences with nearly 400 speakers and a busy evening networking party schedule for most of the nearly 6,000 delegates in attendance.</p>
<p>“I keep receiving overwhelmingly positive feedback and could not be happier with our performance,” commented Rasmus Sojmark, chief executive officer and founder of SBC, expressing his thanks to “exhibitors, sponsors, speakers and attendees for their support,” and thrilled “to hear that everyone got what they came for.”</p>
<p>“I would also like to take the time to commend my team for putting together the greatest SBC show ever. And it will only get better,” Sojmark added.</p>
<p>Post-Event Survey Findings</p>
<p>The Casino &amp; iGaming Zone of the exhibition was the most-visited among all five zones registering visitation of 34.6% according to the post-event survey among delegates, leaving the Sports Betting Zone second with 27.6%, while the newly-introduced Emerging tech, Blockchain and Metaverse Zone also featured prominently to signify the industry’s interest in innovation and emerging technologies.</p>
<p>Conference content from keynote speakers, including DAZN Group CEO Shay Segev, high-stakes VIP poker games organizer Molly Bloom, CEO and founder of Sportradar Carsten Koerl, and metaverse trailblazer Matthew Ball, received special attention from the event delegates according to the post-event survey conducted by the event organizers.</p>
<p>Other speakers that were mentioned by the 92.6% of the delegates who praised the event and stated that it has made a lasting impression on them and would likely recommend it to colleagues and friends included Melanie Hainzer, chief marketing officer at Rootz and David Flynn, CEO of Glitnor Group.</p>
<p>Event Highlights</p>
<p>The 2022 SBC Summit Barcelona crowned Kero Sports among the six start-ups competing for the grand prize of €50,000 ($49,000) during the SBC First Pitch competition. Paradox remained second.</p>
<p>The SBC Awards ceremony gathered over 800 guests to celebrate the winners across 45 categories and recognize the industry achievements of operators, affiliates and suppliers from all the major disciplines.</p>
<p>A selection of networking events brought extra flavor to this year’s edition of the event as former football star Gaizka Mendieta featured at the SBC Football Championship event and iconic Molly Bloom organized a charity poker tournament for the industry’s C-levels.</p>
<p>Official SBC evening networking parties at some of the most popular entertainment venues in Barcelona further contributed to the success of the event and paved the way for its return around the same time next year.</p>
