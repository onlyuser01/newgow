<p>Playtech’s Safety Measures for Responsible Gambling</p>
<p>Playtech has been at the center of multiple developments this year. The company broke ground in Switzerland, teaming up with Swiss Casino Group. In September 2020, Playtech teamed up with the Canadian non-profit organization called Responsible Gaming Council (RGC).</p>
<p>The company will help RGC boost research of the links between mental health and gambling. RGC is a worldwide influential organization that has been established 35 years ago and works with operators, regulators, treatment providers, and gamblers since 1983.</p>
<p>This cooperation is part of Playtech’s “Sustainable success” strategy which aims to create a more responsible gambling culture. The main goal is to provide a safe environment for players while also maintaining a high revenue and solid customer base.</p>
<p>In November, Playtech also announced their integration with Affordability UK, which is supplied by TruNarrative. This partnership aims to provide casinos with the means to detect customers who are over-spending and take the necessary measures to protect them.</p>
