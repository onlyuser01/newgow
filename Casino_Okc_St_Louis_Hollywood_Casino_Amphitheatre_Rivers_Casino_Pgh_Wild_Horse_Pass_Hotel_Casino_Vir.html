<p>Fairie Nights review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Fairie Nights is a twisted-wood themed fairy slot, with fairies of all types from creepy wood nymph’s and ancient gnomes all the way to Victorian-style butterfly-winged nymphets. There is also the Shakespearean allusion of Bottom’s head, but in this case upgraded from a donkey to the more magical feeling unicorn.</p>
<p>With its wooded backgrounds and cool, verdant green colour scheme, Fairie Nights does a good job of creating a world in which you can get lost beneath a mushroom or walk alongside giant ents in search of hidden treasures.</p>
<p>Win with the top paying symbol</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The design for the game is remarkably well thought, through. The symbols are detailed without loosing the iconic clarity that sometimes gets diluted by the more painterly designs out there.</p>
<p>This is coupled with a gorgeous background of the wood for the "day" part of the game (or rather the base game) and plenty of spooky shadows and magical lights in the "night" (or bonus) portion of the game.</p>
<p>The animations are clean, smooth and simple, and the music is the kind of atmospheric ambient noise that works much better than more melody based music which can easily become tiresome after the looped track has played a thousand times.</p>
<p>Overall it is an excellent piece of game design.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>The main gameplay is a straightforward 25 win line slot played on a five by three grid. There are a number of nice little features (described in the Wilds, Bonus and Free Spins section), that add a little variation to the game.</p>
<p>Gameplay is therefore pretty standard, but why fix what ain’t broken.</p>
<p>Special symbols from the base game - the Day Mode</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The bonus game, referred to as "night mode" by the game, is triggered when you hit three or more Bonus symbols. Three symbols award 7 free spins, while four or five will get you 9 and 11 respectively.</p>
<p>Bonus symbols only appear during the base "day" game, along with the Expanding Wilds. These wilds substitute for all symbols except the Bonus symbol and expand to fill the entire reel they are on. There is no non-expanding wild in the base game.</p>
<p>Expanding Wild symbol can occur on any reel in the base game</p>
<p>During the free spins the Expanding Wild and Bonus symbols are replaced by a Multiplier – that appears only on reels 1 and 5 – and a Sticky Wild.</p>
<p>The Multiplier multiplies all winnings by two, and the Sticky Wild will stick for multiple spins. In addition to sticking for multiple spins it will also sometimes transform random non-special symbols into Sticky Wilds too.</p>

<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>As a medium volatility slot, we are unlikely to recommend Fairie Nights overall as we prefer high volatility slots to pair with our preferred strategies. Medium is not too low, but its at the outside edge of what we like.</p>
<p>The return to player for this slot is a very middle of the road 96.0%.</p>
<p>The site we tested offered a range of bet sizes from a maximum of £/$/€100.00 down to a minimum of £/$/€0.25 per spin.</p>
<p>Fairie Nights - win in the free spins bonus game</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>While the volatility and return to player are pretty average, when coupled with the pleasant design and solid gameplay, this 1x2 Games'slot should probably deserve to be a bit more popular than it is.</p>
<p>We cannot make a strong recommendation, but we certainly would not chase you off from playing it, if it seems like your sort of thing.</p>
