<p>Under a new deal, DraftKings will become an official sports betting partner of the NHL franchise Boston Bruins. The new collaboration will bring exciting fan engagement opportunities, but the deal is contingent on sports betting legalization in Massachusetts.</p>
<p>DraftKings Strikes Another Deal with NHL Franchise</p>
<p>Leading digital sports and entertainment company DraftKings announced on Thursday a new partnership with the National Hockey League franchise Boston Bruins. Under the multi-year collaboration, the operator will become an exclusive Official Daily Fantasy Partner of the team. Moreover, the new deal will see DraftKings become an Official Sports Betting Partner of the team and the team’s TD Garden Arena and an exclusive presenting sponsor of the Boston Bruins Foundation 50/50 charitable raffle.</p>
<p>The deal complements existing collaborations which DraftKings has already inked with other NHL teams. Additionally, this partnership further solidifies the operator’s position as an official daily fantasy partner as well as an official sports betting partner of the NHL.</p>
<p>It is important to mention that the new deal is contingent on sports betting legalization in Massachusetts. Currently, the state has proposed a bill legalizing sports betting which is yet to receive the approval of the Senate. Only recently, DraftKings inked another deal with Boot Hill Casino in Kansas. By joining forces with Boot Hill, the company secured market access to the state, which is yet to adopt sports betting legislation and regulation.</p>
<p>The Collaboration Is Expected to Bring Unique Experiences for Sports Fans</p>
<p>Aiming at creating a unique viewer experience the collaboration between DraftKings and the Bruins will bring strategic digital and social media content. DraftKings will benefit from digital links to its suite of products. Moreover, the duo will collaborate on new content series which are going to be hosted at Bruins social media channels. Those series are going to be “inspired by daily fantasy engagement and exciting moments in the game,” explained DraftKings. Such content would include pre-game polls that ask fans to predict goals, high-point scorers and more. If Massachusetts legalizes sports betting, DraftKings and the Bruins will collaborate on creating additional content that will undoubtedly boost fan engagement.</p>
<p>A unique fan engagement activation that the deal will bring relates to the Boston Bruins Foundation 50/50 Raffle. Since DraftKings is going to be the exclusive presenting sponsor of the raffle, the operator will benefit from branding signage. The company’s branding and content are also going to be integrated throughout TD Garden. Besides in-arena branding, DraftKings will benefit by being featured on the supersized LED billboard that is facing the traffic toward the arena.</p>
<p>DraftKings Is Thrilled to Join Forces with Boston Bruins</p>
<p>Boston Bruins’ president, Cam Neely, said that the team is excited to announce this partnership. Additionally, he acknowledged that DraftKings has established itself as a prominent hub for daily fantasy sports. In conclusion, Neely said that the Bruins are looking forward to the collaboration which will bring the best sports entertainment experience to the fans at TD Garden.</p>
