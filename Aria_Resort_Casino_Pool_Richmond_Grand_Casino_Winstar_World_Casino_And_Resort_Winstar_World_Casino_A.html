<p>PlayLottoGlobal is preparing to launch in two of the biggest Latin American markets in the first quarter</p>
<p>The lottery will be going online on March 1 in both Brazil and Mexico, seeking to rapidly consolidate its presence in the region and reach the millions of lottery fans in both countries respectively.</p>
<p>PlayLottoGlobal Pursues Global Expansion in First Quarter</p>
<p>The company is aiming to be present in more than 180 countries by the end of the first quarter and will seek to offer consumers a mix of experiences that go way beyond the traditional lottery bastion.</p>
<p>PlayLottoGlobal also carries slots, live casino games, and scratch cards to regulated and licensed jurisdictions where its products are available. The brand focuses on an accessible and entertaining digital experience that is part of its success driver, company CEO and founder Todd Poindexter has explained in a press release.</p>
<p>Commenting on the new launches, Poindexter has hailed the efforts of the company’s teams which are preparing the brand for a launch in the two new markets, bringing tailored digital innovation along. He added:</p>
<p>Our platform also offers users and marketing professionals the opportunity to participate in the ambassador program. PlayLottoGlobal CEO and founder Todd Poindexter</p>
<p>To join and play, players will need a steady internet connection. The website will be accessible in both Mexico and Brazil on the launch date from desktop and mobile devices, and the platform will support a range of payment options, including bank cards, cryptocurrencies, and other digital payment solutions.</p>
<p>Latin America Piques Betting and Gaming Brands Interest</p>
<p>PlayLottoGlobal has been scaling its global offer rapidly, not least owing to a license issued by the Curaçao Gaming Commission, which allows the brand to pivot towards new markets that accept the license.</p>
<p>Latin America has been a particularly important market for not just lottery companies, but also suppliers of iGaming products, content providers, sports betting, and online gaming brands. Companies such as GAN, a provider of B2B online gaming technology and B2C online betting and gaming brands, have recently rolled out Coolbet in Mexico.</p>
