<p>Gambling and sports betting brand BluBet has been approved to operate virtual slot games in Germany. The company received the virtual slot machine license from the State Administrative Office of Saxony-Anhalt and will now be able to diversify its offer in the country.</p>
<p>BluBet Receives a Virtual Slots License</p>
<p>The license approval is welcome news for BluBet as its parent company, Novo Interactive, operates Novoline – an online platform with a rich selection of exciting and varied slot games. German bettors will now be able to access this strong portfolio of games through BluBet’s platform.</p>
<p>Novo Interactive is an influential local provider based in Hamburg. It already holds a license to offer sports betting in the European country. Now that it has secured a virtual slot games license as well, Novo Interactive will be able to double down on its efforts in both gambling and sports betting.</p>
<p>BluBet is, in fact, one of the first companies to receive a license for virtual slot games. Another company from the select few on the government’s white list is The Gauselmann Group, whose Merkur Spiel brand was allowed to operate virtual slot machines a few days ago. SlotMagie is another company that was greenlit to offer slot machine games in the country.</p>
<p>Oliver Bagus, managing director of Novo Interactive, spoke about the company’s responsibilities now that it has received a license. He noted that as a licensed provider, Novo Interactive will be responsible for appealing to bettors in the country and convincing them to select the legal alternative over the black market.</p>
<p>Bagus said that Novo Interactive takes this very seriously and will do everything in its power to produce attractive games. He hopes to bring as many people as possible back into the regulated German gaming market.</p>
<p>German Gambling Is Changing</p>
<p>The Saxony-Anhalt State Administration Office was replaced as Germany’s regulator by the Glücksspielbehörde on July 1. The latter will slowly assume responsibility for all of the gambling in the country. The responsibilities will be transitioned gradually and the GGL will get full control by the beginning of 2023.</p>
<p>Once it stepped into power, the GGL immediately began a crusade against the pervasive illegal gambling operators. The new regulator went as far as asking internet service providers to block access to such sites and warned that those who fail to do so may be fined.</p>
<p>Deutscher Sportwettenverband, a German association of sports betting providers, hopes that the GGL will be able to curb the black market.</p>
