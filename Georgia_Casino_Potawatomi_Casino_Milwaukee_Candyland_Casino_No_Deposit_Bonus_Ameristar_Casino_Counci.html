<p>Carli Lloyd and Tom Kim will work with other ambassadors to promote responsible gambling practices and educate the public about setting limits</p>
<p>FanDuel, a frontrunner in sports betting and daily fantasy sports, is taking a proactive approach to responsible gaming. The company has expanded its Responsible Gaming Ambassador program by welcoming two renowned athletes, Carli Lloyd and Tom Kim. FanDuel plans to feature these star athletes in several new advertisements, raising awareness of setting deposit and wager limits and managing screen time.</p>
<p>The Sporting Icons Were Eager to Get Started</p>
<p>FanDuel’s first new ambassador is Carli Lloyd, a household name for soccer fans. Her two FIFA Women’s World Cup championships and two Olympic gold medals have fostered a reputation for unparalleled success on the field. Lloyd was excited regarding her new appointment and eager to join her fellow ambassadors in helping spread the Play Well lifestyle.</p>
<p>As sports gambling continues to become more accessible, I think it is critical fans… remember that tools are available to them within the FanDuel Sportsbook app to stay in control of the way they play. Carli Lloyd</p>
<p>Joining Lloyd will be South Korean professional golfer Tom Kim, known in full as Kim Joo-hyung. Kim’s skill and consistency on the golf course have made him a formidable force in professional golf, clinching remarkable victories on the PGA Tour, Asian Tour, and Korean Tour. He expressed hope that his efforts as FanDuel ambassador would lead to meaningful change and improve the lives of bettors.</p>
<p>I am proud to join (FanDuel) as a Responsible Gaming Ambassador and raise awareness among my fans and the golf community on and off the course. Tom Kim</p>
<p>FanDuel’s Responsible Gaming Ambassador program brings together a diverse group of sports icons passionate about introducing the public to responsible gambling practices. The initiative will develop community-facing adverts featuring athletes like Kim and Lloyd to educate the public on setting screen time notifications and deposit and wager limits, fostering a safer gaming environment.</p>
<p>FanDuel Remains a Leader in Responsible Gaming</p>
<p>The Gaming Ambassador program is one of FanDuel’s many responsible gambling efforts. The company remains engaged with its players and eagerly participated in 2023’s Gambling Awareness Month. FanDuel regularly donates funds to the National Council on Problem Gambling and other organizations to help offset gambling’s societal burden.</p>
<p>By leveraging the influence and credibility of its Ambassadors, FanDuel hopes to encourage fans and enthusiasts to approach gaming with a sense of responsibility and self-awareness. The operator also improved its digital identity services, ensuring customers have a safe experience they trust. Such efforts should also improve player confidence, enhancing acquisition and retention rates.</p>
<p>FanDuel’s ongoing safe gambling efforts aim to make a meaningful difference in fostering responsible gaming within the sports community. With their exceptional achievements and dedication to their sports, Lloyd and Kim are well-positioned to raise awareness and educate the public about responsible gaming, benefiting fans and industry stakeholders.</p>
