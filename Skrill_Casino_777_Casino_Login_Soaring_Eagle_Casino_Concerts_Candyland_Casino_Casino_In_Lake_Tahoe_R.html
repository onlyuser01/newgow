    <h1>Skrill Casino 777 Casino Login Soaring Eagle Casino Concerts Candyland Casino Casino In Lake Tahoe R</h1>

<p>Hello, the situation is this, I have been playing at this casino for a long time, there were no special problems. In general, I played in the game Viking go berserk, my bet was 3000 rubles for 1 free spin, a bonus dropped out and during the bonus, when the accrual for a spin took place, I noticed that there was an error in the game, the accrual of funds did not correspond to my bet, and it was significant, I I began to play further, knowing perfectly well that without photos and videos, there would be no sense from my complaint. When I got another bonus, I turned on video recording and recorded everything on video. The game again did the same, after the bonus game I wrote down a few more minutes for comparison, where you can see what wins the game gives on a given bet. Then I contacted the customer support chat and provided a video recording and explained the essence of the problem. So, the employees, or rather the scammers of this casino, laughed at me and said that the win was accrued correctly and there was no error, during my take off the dialogue, I realized that they did not even watch the video, they responded with templates and phrases the same. These are obvious tyrants and bandits. The exact amount that the game did not give me, if desired, can be calculated based on the video recording. The amount is quite large, I play at different casinos and at higher stakes and I know exactly what I'm talking about, at the casino, Spin City, I played this game a lot, you can check it. Also on this rogue casino Rox, I also saw here that this casino is connected with the Djet casino, I had the same case in the game with a fruit cocktail, the bet was less than 350 rubles and there was also a game error in the bonus game, only I didn’t record a video, they simply didn’t get the winnings during the bonus, and that’s all, but I caught the biggest symbol of the fruit cocktail 2 times and at this rate for 2 cocktails they had to give out 70 thousand rubles, and there were others, in general this is one gang of scammers, I urge everyone not to play in these casinos. Well, if in life one of them comes across to me on the way, I answer I will soak him whoever it is a man or a woman. I don't give a fuck, I'll make the tie a little higher than usual for the forensic expert to appreciate. I can provide video recording</p>
