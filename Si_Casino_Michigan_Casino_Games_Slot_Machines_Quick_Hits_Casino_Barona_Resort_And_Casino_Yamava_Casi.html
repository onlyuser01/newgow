<p>Eintracht Frankfurt Going for a Win on Tuesday</p>
<p>Eintracht Frankfurt have been great at home this entire season. With roughly 50,000 fans at Deutsche Bank Park rooting for them on Tuesday, the Germans are likely to be on the front foot. And they should be as they got a really good roster this season.</p>
<p>They don’t have a major superstar on their squad, but their strength comes from team play. Still, there are a couple of players who do stand out from the crowd, starting with Randal Kolo Muani, who’s their top scorer with 14 goals in 28 games in all competitions.</p>
<p>Playmaker Daichi Kamada is second on that list with 13 goals, followed by his colleague from the midfield, Jesper Lindstrom with nine goals to his name.</p>
<p>Although all of them are still in their mid-twenties, these guys play as if they’re much more experienced than that. They don’t seem to have any fear in big games, as evident from the fact that this season, Eintracht Frankfurt has done great against teams like Bayern Munich (1-1 on the road), Freiburg (1-1 on the road), Tottenham (0-0 at home), and so on.</p>
<p>Napoli Haven’t Been This Good in Decades</p>
<p>It looks very likely Napoli will win their first title since the days of Diego Armando Maradona. They’re sitting top of the Italian Serie A with a double-figure point gap between them and teams that could challenge the title.</p>
<p>Apart from going for the domestic trophy, the Sky Blues from Naples also have high hopes for the Champions League. They want to advance to the next stage, but for that, they need to do well in Germany. Luckily for them, the rematch is played in Italy, where they’ve been nothing short of brilliant this season.</p>
<p>At home, Napoli look capable of beating any opponent, Eintracht Frankfurt included. That said, not losing by a big margin in Germany is on their agenda. Anything other than that would keep them in the game for the UCL quarterfinals.</p>
<p>Eintracht Frankfurt vs Napoli Prediction</p>
<p>The hosts need to go for a win on Tuesday. Everyone knows this, including Napoli players. However, the visitors from Italy just don’t know how to defend, which is why this isn’t going to be a one-sided affair. Instead, we’re going to witness a real spectacle in Frankfurt, probably with plenty of goals on each end. Nevertheless, we do think the home side will be the one to score more.</p>
<p>Picks: Eintracht Frankfurt to win and over 2.5 goals</p>
