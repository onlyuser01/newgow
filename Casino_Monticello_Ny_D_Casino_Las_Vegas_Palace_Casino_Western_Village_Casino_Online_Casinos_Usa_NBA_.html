    <h1>Casino Monticello Ny D Casino Las Vegas Palace Casino Western Village Casino Online Casinos Usa NBA</h1>

<p>The NBA is definitely not backing down on its bid to capitalize on the rapidly growing sports betting market in the United States. Last Wednesday, the professional basketball league’s officials announced that they have recently entered into yet another lucrative multiyear partnership with PointsBet, one of the world’s leading sports betting operators. This marks the 11th sports betting deal that the NBA is signing since the United States Supreme Court lifted the federal ban on sports betting.</p>
<p>What to Expect</p>
<p>PointsBet has a pretty great reputation in its home market which makes its entry into the United States quite exciting. As per the terms of the partnership deal, PointsBet will be integrating a league-first Win Probability Metric across certain NBA platforms. Some of the areas where this will be immediately noticeable will be the league’s social media accounts and NBA.com, its official website.</p>
<p>This real-time insight uses the same analytics and statistics that power the operator’s sportsbook – it will, therefore, go a long way in illustrating outcomes. Using these analytics, the probabilities will be adjusted in real-time.</p>
<p>In addition to that, the sports betting operator will also be integrating the NBA’s data and branding across all of its digital platforms. This will, of course, be a great way of promoting the league’s brand in other parts of the world.</p>
<p>“As a tech company at heart, the PointsBet team is excited to work with a league as savvy and forward-thinking as the NBA. We’re certainly aligned in looking to present fans with the best experience possible, and we look forward to enhancing the sports betting aspect via the win probability metric powered by PointsBet,” Johnny Aitken, chief executive of PointsBet US commented on the partnership.</p>
<p>The NBA’s interest in PointsBet is primarily based on the latter’s unique offering, something that they did find with some of its other 10 partners. Besides working hard to ensure that NBA and sports betting fans get the very best experiences, both of them will also be collaborating in order to protect the integrity of the league’s games.</p>
<p>Rapid Growth for PointsBet</p>
<p>Unlike the other companies that the NBA has partnered with in the recent past, PointsBet is perhaps the youngest one. The company launched just a little over a year ago in Australia and shortly after that, it ventured into the US sports betting market. Despite being a new player in the sector, it is without a doubt one of the fastest growing online sports betting operations in the US. No wonder it caught the attention of the NBA.</p>
<p>As it stands, PointsBet already offers sports betting services and products in New Jersey and Iowa. It operates an online sportsbook in New Jersey and both retail and online sports betting in Iowa. It has recently received approval to launch mobile sports betting in Indiana as well as sportsbooks in Colorado Michigan and Illinois. Moreover, it has also partnered with Penn National Gaming. Still, there is more to come.</p>
