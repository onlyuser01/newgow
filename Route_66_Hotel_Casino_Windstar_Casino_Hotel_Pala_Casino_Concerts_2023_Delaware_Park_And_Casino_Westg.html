<p>The popular provider of iGaming content, Pragmatic Play, expanded further its portfolio of offering by releasing a new pirate-themed slot game. The company confirmed the launch of Pirates Pub slot, a game that invites the players on a pirate adventure, granting a chance for big prizes.</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play constantly grows its portfolio of offering by delivering new and engaging casino games. Every month, the company develops up to eight new online slot games, while at the same time continuing to build its Bingo, Virtual Sports and Live casino offering. Now, Pirates Pub grows further Pragmatic Play's portfolio and comes after the recent release of other hits such as Sticky Bees, Jewel Rush, as well as Zeus vs Hades - Gods of War.</p>
<p>True to the company's unique style of offering engaging entertainment, Pirates Pub features a colorful pirate theme that is backed by quality sound effects. The 5x3 slot game displays the reel in the center of the screen. Pirates Pub features different symbols including pirate hats, holden coins, swords, potions and beers.</p>
<p>Additionally, the game uses standard playing card suits, clubs, diamonds, hearts and spades, portrayed in a way to match the pirate theme of the new slot game. To further elevate the experience for the players, the new slot game offers Scatter Wild symbols that can substitute all other symbols in the game. This symbol, according to Pragmatic Play, makes it easier for players to win different combinations.</p>
<p>The game developer explained in a statement: "The positions of the Scatter Wilds that triggered the bonus are marked by a frame, and any additional wilds landed on the gameboard during the bonus will also be marked. If a Wild lands on an existing frame, its multiplier is increased by 1x up to a maximum of 5x."</p>
<p>Once the free spins round ends, another bonus round stage is triggered, reveals Pragmatic Play. During this bonus round, players can have up to five additional spins that can bring even more exciting prizes. This is achieved thanks to transforming the previously created frames into sticky multiplier Wilds or sticky Wilds. "If numerous multiplier Wilds help form a win, the value of the multipliers are added together before being applied," confirmed the game developer.</p>
<p>The release of the new slot comes after only recently, Pragmatic Play signed a deal with ComeOn Group. Under the terms of the new partnership, the company agreed to deliver its Slots, Virtual Sports and Live Casino games for ComeOn.nl in the Netherlands, powering the operator's presence in the country.</p>
