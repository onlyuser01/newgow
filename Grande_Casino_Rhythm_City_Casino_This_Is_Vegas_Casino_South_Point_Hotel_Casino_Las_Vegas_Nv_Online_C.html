<p>Football Index: UKGC Warned of ‘Dangerous Pyramid Scheme,’ Failed to Act</p>

<p>Football Index was a disaster waiting to happen, according to a document that described the soccer trading platform as an “exceptionally dangerous pyramid scheme under the guise of a football stock market.”</p>

<p>The document, seen by The Guardian, was authored by an unnamed person “with extensive experience in the [gambling] sector.” It was passed to UK Gambling Commission staff in January 2020, who forwarded it to the regulatory body’s senior executives, according to The Guardian.</p>
<p>But questions will be asked about why the regulator apparently ignored the document or failed to take it seriously. The author analyzed the Football Index business model in-depth and highlighted fundamental flaws that made it allegedly unsustainable. The document recommended that immediate action be taken by the UKGC to protect consumers.</p>
<p>Market Crash</p>
<p>Launched in 2015, Football Index became a visible brand around English soccer by advertising heavily on TV and radio, and on player’s jerseys.</p>
<p>Mimicking a stock market, Football Index allowed users to buy and trade “shares” in professional soccer players. The value would fluctuate depending on metrics like a player’s on-pitch performances, or real-world value in the soccer transfer market. Players were then paid “dividends” based on the performance of their shares.</p>
<p>But early this month, the company announced it would slash dividends by 80 percent to ensure the platform’s “long-term sustainability.”</p>
<p>This caused the market to crash and the value of shares to nosedive overnight, forcing the site offline and leaving users unable to withdraw what was left of their balances.</p>
<p>The UKGC suspended the license of Football Index’s parent company, Bet Index, on March 11, the same day it went into receivership.</p>
<p>Dangerous Liabilities</p>
<p>But 14 months earlier, the UKGC was warned that the only way Football Index could afford to meet its liabilities — the dividends it had to pay to users 00 in the long term was “through the constant sale of yet more new shares to new users alongside a constant churn in positions.”</p>
<p>“Should user growth stop or decline, the company would quickly find itself unable to pay these liabilities to users,” continued the report.</p>
<p>This left Football Index “vulnerable [to] and destined for a bank run in which the first ‘X’ percent of users manage to get some money out before the system collapses and the remainder lose everything,” it concluded.</p>
<p>Lawmakers including Labour MP Carolyn Harris have vowed to ask questions in Parliament about Football Index and whether the UKGC was derelict in its duty to oversee the company.</p>
<p>The UKGC has countered that while it is its duty to look at suitability, including financial circumstances, when licensing an operator, it does not “oversee their businesses on a day-to-day basis or monitor the financial health of operators directly in real-time.”</p>
<p>“People using gambling operators do so at their own risk,” it added.</p>
