<p>The leading provider of gaming solutions for iGaming operators, Yggdrasil, announced a new partnership extension with Reflex Gaming, a leading omnichannel supplier of gambling games and machines. Details of the deal emerged Monday and see Yggdrasil introduce its leading Game Engagement Mechanics (GEMs) for the company's retail operations.</p>
<p>The collaboration marks the first time GEMs are available for land-based casinos. Under the terms of the recent collaboration, Reflex Gaming agreed to implement Yggdrasil's GEMs for its retail venues in the UK. As a result, the leading mechanics will be added to terminals within arcades, betting shops, as well as pubs and other gambling venues.</p>
<p>The new partnership builds upon a previous deal inked between Yggdrasil and Reflex Gaming. Back in 2020, Reflex Gaming became a YG Masters Partner. Through the collaboration, the company gained access to 11 online titles that offered Yggdrasil's leading GEMs technology. Such titles included the highly popular Desperate Dawgs 2 Gigablox and Dublin Up DoubleMax.</p>
<p>Thanks to the new deal, the duo further extend their collaboration and Yggdrasil's GEMs will debut for Relax Gaming's land-based venues. The popular mechanics deliver new and engaging experiences for the customers of the supplier. At the same time, the new deal expands the reach of Yggdrasil's offering and boosts its position as a leading supplier of content for the gambling industry.</p>
<p>In a statement released on December 19, 2022, Reflex Gaming's CPO, Mat Ingram, said: "We are extremely pleased with what we have achieved as a YG Masters partner in the last few years, and we have been very impressed with how the GEMs have performed on our online titles."</p>
<p>Finally, he added: "Bringing the mechanics to UK players of our retail content is extremely exciting for us and we believe they offer great potential also in this space and look forward to further expanding our successful collaboration."</p>
<p>Stuart McCarthy, Yggdrasil's Head of Product and Programs, added: "Strengthening our partnership with Reflex Gaming to bring our GEMs to the land-based space is a great milestone for us." He said that the company's collaboration with Reflex Gaming already proved to be a success and helped bring new and engaging titles for its players.</p>
<p>McCarthy added that Yggdrasil is now delighted to further extend its collaboration with the gambling supplier. "This deal is a testament to the strength of our GEMs and the potential it has to take the player experience to a new level," said Yggdrasil's Head of Product and Programs in conclusion.</p>
