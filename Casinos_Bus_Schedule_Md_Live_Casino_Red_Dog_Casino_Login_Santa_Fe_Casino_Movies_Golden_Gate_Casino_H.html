<p>Online slots developer Booongo reached an agreement to roll-out its portfolio of slot games with German social casino games provider, Ously Games.</p>
<p>Real-money Games up Ahead for Germany</p>
<p>Global online slots developer Booongo is rolling out its portfolio of free-to-play games with German operator Ously Games’ own social casino, Spinarena. Booongo’s developer’s content is already available worldwide across Europe, South America, and Asia. Yet, the partnership is a first for the company in Germany, ahead of a planned re-regulation of the gambling industry that is taking place in 2021.</p>
<p>All of Booongo’s free-to-play games will be available on Spinarena, along with games from the Hold and Win collection such as 15 Dragon Pearls, Beast Saga, and Super Marble. The company is planning to present exciting real-money gaming content for a one-of-a-kind immersive experience, which is Booongo’s strategy for success.</p>
<p>Booongo’s Commercial Director, Sebastian Damian, has clarified on Booongo’s strategy and social casino-first approach, arguing that the company would garner a deeper understanding of player behavior in the newly-regulated market as it prepares to scale up its presence.</p>
<p>Global Expansion on the Rise for Booongo</p>
<p>Booongo is ‘keeping up the momentum’ announcing another deal with EvenBet, a leading gaming software developer, four weeks ago. EvenBet’s CEO, Dmitry Starostenkov, welcome the partnership with Booongo, describing it as the best way to grow EvenBet’s presence and expand its clout with other operators.</p>
<p>Booongo recently also took to the emerging operator PlaylogiQ its complete portfolio including its latest releases Scarab Temple, Dragon Pearls, and Aztec Sun. With its wide-range comprehensive games that have driven customer retention for operators, Booongo is definitely on a roll when it comes to partnerships this year.</p>
<p>Ously Games is also keeping busy</p>
<p>Ously Games has recently extended a hand to other partners as well. Around the same time as Booongo’s new expansion deals, the operator also partnered up with leading online casino games supplier, Red Rake which has been a household name in social gaming for over 10 years. Ously Games will have access to Red Rake’s top-performing games.</p>
<p>Commenting on the partnership with Booongo, Jochen Martinez, Chief Marketing Officer of Ously Games, stated: “Spinarena continues to attract the industry’s biggest slot developers and we’re delighted to be adding Booongo’s thrilling slot content to our library.“</p>
<p>Ously Games’ Spinarena latest agreements demonstrate that the company definitely wants to bring the best to the table. The operator is currently focused on the Dutch and German markets with the ambition to offer exceptional player experience. Clearly, Booongo and Ously Game will continue to expand and we can’t wait to see what the future holds and if there are other partnerships for the companies up ahead.</p>
