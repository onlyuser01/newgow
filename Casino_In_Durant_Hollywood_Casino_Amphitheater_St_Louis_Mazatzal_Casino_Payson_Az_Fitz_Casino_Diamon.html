<p>According to the Swedish regulator, the ban was a result of SG International N.V. offering services to Swedish customers without holding the necessary license. Following measures taken by the company in order to become compliant with Swedish regulations the ban was eventually lifted on February 13, 2023.</p>
<p>SG International N.V. Became Compliant with Swedish Regulations</p>
<p>In November 2022, SG International N.V. came under the scrutiny of the Swedish Gambling Authority for offering gambling services to Swedish customers without the required license. The company was found to have information in Swedish on its website and directed marketing toward Swedish consumers. As a result, the regulator prohibited the company from providing gaming services in Sweden.</p>
<p>However, SG International N.V. engaged in correspondence with the authority between November 2022 and January 2023, where the company stated its intention to comply with Swedish legislation. The company explained that it only had Swedish text on its website for informational purposes for Swedish players who play from countries other than Sweden.</p>
<p>The company also clarified that it had never marketed directly to Swedish customers, did not allow deposits or withdrawals in Swedish currency, and did not offer Swedish-speaking customer support.</p>
<p>In response to the regulator’s concerns, SG International N.V. removed all Swedish language information and disabled registration with a Swedish address. The company took these measures to ensure that it did not target the Swedish market.</p>
<p>In January 2023, the Swedish Gambling Authority conducted further checks to ensure that the company’s games were not provided in Sweden. The regulator’s findings were in line with the company’s statements in the letters exchanged, which led to the lifting of the ban.</p>
<p>Swedish Regulator Adopts Stringent Approach Toward Non-Compliant Gambling Operators</p>
<p>Sweden has taken strict measures to ensure that the gambling market is safe and secure for players. To achieve this, all gambling operators in Sweden must obtain a gambling license from the Swedish authorities. It doesn’t matter if the company is registered outside of Sweden. If it offers its services in Swedish, accepts Swedish currency or deposits, or allows Swedish players to register an account, it is subject to the Swedish Gaming Act and must obtain the necessary license.</p>
<p>The Swedish Gaming Authority takes a zero-tolerance approach to unlicensed gambling operators in the market, and companies that fail to comply with the regulations will be excluded. Other examples besides SG International N.V. include Ease Gaming N.V., which was banned from the Swedish market in September</p>
<p>By enforcing these strict regulations, Sweden is ensuring that all gambling in the country is conducted by reliable and responsible operators. This not only creates a safer market for players but also ensures that companies that follow the rules can operate in a fair and competitive environment.</p>
