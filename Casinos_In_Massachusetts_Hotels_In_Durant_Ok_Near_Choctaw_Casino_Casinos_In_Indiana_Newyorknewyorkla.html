<p>This well-planned move comes just in time for the company to capitalize on the state’s freshly-launched online sports betting market.</p>
<p>Paysafe Enters Ohio</p>
<p>As mentioned, Ohio just launched its online sports betting market, which is expected to be very profitable considering that the Buckeye State is the seventh most populous state in the US. Experts predict annual GGR of up to $900 million from online bets when the market matures.</p>
<p>Ohio is the 25th US jurisdiction where Paysafe will have a presence. The payments specialist last launched in Maryland, entering the state’s iGaming market in the final quarter of 2022. Just like in Maryland, Paysafe will provide Ohio betting companies with its suite of payment solutions.</p>
<p>The Provider Will Supply Ohioan Sportsbooks with Payment Solutions</p>
<p>Paysafe will offer local companies a vast variety of payment options, including credit and debit card deposits, the Skrill digital wallet for deposits and payouts, as well as other solutions.</p>
<p>The Skrill digital wallet is one of Paysafe’s flagship solutions. The payments company recently upgraded Skrill, greatly improving user experience and allowing Betway customers to instantly make online deposits from their bank accounts. Furthermore, these customers can enjoy lightning-fast payouts and never have to worry about waiting times.</p>
<p>Some of the companies Paysafe will work with in Ohio include a few of its long-term partners, such as Betfred, Betway, Hard Rock and SuperBook Sports. Some of the separate integrations will allow Ohio punters to make secure deposits by using their credit or debit cards. Paysafe noted that it will process all transactions in a seamless manner.</p>
<p>Leveraging Paysafe’s capabilities, a select few companies such as Betway, PointsBet and SuperBook Sports will also provide customers with a variety of alternative payment methods from third-party providers.</p>
<p>Zak Cutler, Paysafe’s president of global gaming, commented on the launch in the Buckeye State’s sports betting market. He noted that his team is delighted to open 2023 with such a major launch, expanding its iGaming payments footprint into Ohio.</p>
<p>Cutler noted that Ohio is the most important American sports betting market to launch since New York, making it very important to Paysafe. He concluded that Paysafe is looking forward to working with local operators:</p>
<p>Through our best-in-class payments platform and our Skrill wallet, we look forward to supporting the growth of our operator partners in Ohio. Zak Cutler, president of global gaming, Paysafe</p>
<p>In 2022, Paysafe tapped into Kansas online sports betting and launched its digital Skrill wallet in Arkansas.</p>
