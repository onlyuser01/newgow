<p>In December 2020, Kalamba Games launched Goblins and Gemstones Treasure Hunter.

The new game released in May 2022 is called Goblins &amp; Gemstones: Hit ‘n’ Roll and brings a series of fresh features and mechanics to the table.</p>

<p>Meet the Cunning Goblins in Kalamba’s New Slot</p>
<p>The provider’s portfolio has been enriched with a new top-quality game with a nice new twist and a special Hit ‘n’ Roll feature. The Goblins &amp; Gemstones: Hit ‘n’ Roll slot continues Kalamba’s list of over 50 hit games including titles like Super Size Atlas, Joker Max: Hit ‘n’ Roll, and 9 Blazing Cashpots. Fans of the original game are getting ready to start chasing treasures, collect their favorite gems, and participate in one of the three available bonus games parts of the new release.</p>
<p>Game Features</p>
<p>The game addresses players who appreciate both traditional and modern-day game elements with innovative twists to them. The base game has been designed in such a way that it continues to be appealing to players even when no other features are activated. When the wild and scatter symbols start popping, joined by other special symbols and features, the game instantly goes to the next level.</p>
<p>Hit ‘n’ Roll Feature</p>
<p>Players who manage to land three Hit ‘n’ Roll symbols will get to trigger a wheel. The wheel will either reward them with an instant cash prize, one of the three available free spins variants (Scatter Split, Expand ‘n’ Lock, Paired Reels), or one of the six Cashpots.</p>
<p>Extra Free Spins</p>
<p>This feature will trigger three different types of free spins games to enjoy. Players can also grab an additional Free Spin by hitting the Gold ‘+1’ symbol on any location on the reels while playing the Free Spins game.</p>
<p>Hyper Bonus Feature</p>
<p>This special feature will allow players to reach the Free Spins or the Hit ‘n’ Roll feature straight away, without worrying about landing the right symbols.</p>
<p>Paired Reels Feature</p>
<p>This feature will automatically and randomly group the reels into several possible combinations that could generate massive wins on each new spin.</p>
<p>Expand ‘n Lock Feature</p>
<p>This will trigger the reels to expand and lock a randomly chosen symbol. The symbol will be stacked on top, allowing players to enjoy even more ways to win.</p>
<p>Scatter Split Feature</p>
<p>This will allow for a randomly chosen symbol on the reels to instantly split in two or three and generate a payment no matter what its position might be. The new symbols will be counted as two or three matches.</p>
<p>The company’s co-founder and chief operating officer Alex Cohen believes the upgraded maximum win and added gameplay improvements will add global appeal to the new slot that already has a well-grounded database of players. At the beginning of May, the company announced it would affiliate with Betsson Embark for a content partnership. Just a few days earlier, Kalamba announced that it had turned into Big Time Gaming’s licensed partner, gaining access to the popular Megaways mechanic.</p>
