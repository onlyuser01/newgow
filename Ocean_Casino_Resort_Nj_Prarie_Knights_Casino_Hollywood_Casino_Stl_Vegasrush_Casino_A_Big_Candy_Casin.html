<p>Betsson Group, a global online casino and sports betting operator running multiple gaming brands, including Betsafe, and Paysafe, announced today an expanded partnership that will see the specialized payments provider deliver a range of traditional and alternative payment solutions to the new Betsafe online sportsbook in Colorado.</p>
<p>Supporting the Group’s US Journey</p>
<p>The new partnership builds on the long-standing payment support provided by Paysafe for Betsson’s global brands that dates back to 2007 and expands it into the US market starting from Colorado.</p>
<p>“We’re delighted to support our longstanding partner Betsson Group’s expansion into the U.S. sports-betting and iGaming space with their Betsafe brand.” Zak Cutler, CEO, North America iGaming, Paysafe</p>
<p>Paysafe has been providing its eCash solution to facilitate payments for Betsson’s brands across some of the major European gaming markets, including Sweden, Germany, Italy, Spain, Denmark, and Greece for 15 years, while Paysafe’s digital wallets Skrill and NETELLER take care of payments for Betsson iGaming brands in more than 60 global markets.</p>
<p>‘We have a proven track record facilitating payments for Betsson brands and their players in multiple European and global markets, and we’re confident that we’ll play an equally important customer acquisition and retention role for the operator in Colorado and beyond,” concluded Cutler.</p>
<p>Colorado is Just the Beginning</p>
<p>Following the recent launch of the Betsafe mobile sportsbook in Colorado, Paysafe will be taking care of online credit and debit card deposits for players in the Centennial State, utilizing the services of its core banking provider to seamlessly process funding for Betsafe player accounts via its payment gateway.</p>
<p>Outlining that “at Betsson, the customer is at the core of everything,” US managing director for Betsson Group Marina Bogard expressed Betsson’s confidence in the capabilities of Paysafe to navigate the payments journey for their customers.</p>
<p>“We aim to make the entire journey on our brands as smooth and convenient as possible, including their deposit and payout experiences. As they have done in other markets, we are confident that Paysafe’s payment solutions will be able to support us with all our needs to achieve our goals.” Marina Bogard, Managing Director US, Betsson Group</p>
<p>Betsafe’s integration with Paysafe will also power a range of alternative payment methods for Colorado players, including the provider’s upgraded Skrill USA digital wallet, capable of making instant deposits and receiving payouts.</p>
<p>Sports bettors with a distinct preference for cash can utilize Paysafe’s eCash, paysafecard and Paysafecash solutions available at thousands of in-store retailers in the state and nationwide to fund their Betsafe player accounts.</p>
