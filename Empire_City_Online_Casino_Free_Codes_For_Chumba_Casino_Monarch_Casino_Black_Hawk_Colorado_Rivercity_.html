<p>The acquisition of the based in Manchester, UK, Degree 53 will further enhance technical capabilities for NYSE-listed Bally’s Corporation as it continues to establish a leading position as an omni-channel gaming and entertainment operator in the US.</p>
<p>We are delighted to welcome Degree 53 to the Bally’s family. As we prepare to launch our Bally Bet 2.0 mobile sportsbook app early next year, we look forward to leveraging the Degree 53 team to develop our mobile sportsbook products and enhance our customers’ overall betting experience.” Adi Dhandhania, Chief Operating Officer – North America, Bally Interactive</p>
<p>Specialized in software, UX and app development, Degree 53’s team of 54 design and technical experts will continue to operate out of its Manchester studio after the transaction close, catering to the needs of a portfolio of prominent gaming partners. The game studio has worked with names from the betting and gaming industry like Betfred, Scientific Games, FDJ Gaming Solutions and Penn National.</p>
<p>We are pleased that Bally’s has recognized the differentiated approach that we bring to the market and to join with them during such an exciting period of the Company’s evolution. This is an exciting time for online gaming and the sports betting industry, and we look forward to immersing ourselves in the diversified projects that Bally’s provides.” Richard Wagstaff, Managing Director, Degree 53</p>
<p>The acquisition of the game studio, which was founded in 2013, will further support Bally’s complex system integration, featuring daily fantasy sports operator Monkey Knife Fight (MKF), free-to-play games studio SportCaller and online gaming operator Gamesys Group. The new acquisition will also be in line with Bally’s media partnership with Sinclair Broadcast Group.</p>

<p>Raja B-Sheikh, senior vice president of Sports Products for Bally Interactive, said that the addition of Degree 53 to Bally’s technology stack “arms us with a unique perspective and skills set” to help Bally’s further advance the company’s products, alongside its plans to offer “innovative and connected experiences” to its audiences.</p>
<p>“I am excited to work closely with the team as they contribute to our quest of making Bally’s the number one destination for gaming entertainment,” Raja B-Sheikh concluded.</p>
