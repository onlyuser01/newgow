    <h1>Casino Stardew Valley Zia Park Casino Hotel Racetrack Casino Hinckley Mn Meadows Casino Bellagio Hot</h1>

<p>I won this in late may and have been on live chat many times since then asking why my pending withdrawal is still pending after I've been verified and they kept saying they'd send and email which they never did. I abruptly got an email today saying my account was being closed and only my deposit being returned</p>
<p>"Hello,</p>
<p>I am writing to inform you that after an internal investigation, management has decided to close your account.</p>
<p>As per our bonus terms and condition:</p>
<p>1.23. We reserve the right to audit your gameplay/transaction logs. You hereby consent in advance for us to do so.

In such circumstances, we shall be under no obligation to refund any funds that may be in your account other than your original deposit amounts.</p>

<p>I havent used any sort of manipulative game strategy i've just played the same slot over and over again as It's my favourite.</p>
<p>I don't feel like the above term applies to me and feel its unfair this win has been confiscated.</p>
