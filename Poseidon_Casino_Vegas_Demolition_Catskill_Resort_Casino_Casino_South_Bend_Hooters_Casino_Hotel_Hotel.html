<p>Play’n GO probably has a soft spot for pandas, or at least this is the impression one gets from having a quick look through Pandastic Adventure, a loosely Kung-Fu-Panda-themed game about, well – pandas.</p>
<p>The new game released today follows the character of Join Bao Yun who quests to retrieve ancestral treasures across the dynamic five-by-three slot grid. He uses a magical talisman heirloom to find his way to a magic temple where riches await. Commenting on the launch of the studio’s latest game, Play’n GO Games Ambassador Magnus Wallentin has said that the studio was excited to kick off the year with this adventure:</p>
<p>"With plenty of dynamic features, upgrades, and a Bonus Round – Pandastic Adventure is set to be a Play’n GO classic."</p>
<p>The game has borrowed generously from Asian tropes, using visible design elements, and cladding the Panda-warrior character in traditional warrior gear typical of the region. The game itself is not just about its great design and thematic value, but it also goes a step further providing players with the opportunity to pursue some significant winnings.</p>
<p>Pandastic Adventure comes with a Max Win Multiplier capped at 6,500x, and there are Free Spins as a dedicated Bonus Round, and also – an Upgrades feature. The goal is to get to the Temple Treasure Bonus Round, which could happen as you collect the relevant symbols during a free spin round. There is also a Hold and Spin feature, which is triggered with eight wilds.</p>
<p>The game offers a very straightforward base game, with most of the fun secreted away in the bonus level. In the meantime, there are only 20 paylines you will need to keep an eye out for here. The grid’s backdrop is a lush wintery scene decorated by traditional Japanese-style buildings in the backdrop with the grid itself framed by bamboo weavings.</p>
<p>There is a jackpot feature that will let you win a MiniMinor, Major and Grand Jackpot as well. The biggest one here is the Grand bonus prize, which is a 5,000x multiplier based on the player bet.</p>
<p>To activate the Journey to the Temple Free Spins, players need to get 3,4 or 5 scatter symbols, which will not only add 8 free spins, but also offer respective multipliers of 3x, 5x or 15x, depending on how many symbols you got when activating the price.</p>
