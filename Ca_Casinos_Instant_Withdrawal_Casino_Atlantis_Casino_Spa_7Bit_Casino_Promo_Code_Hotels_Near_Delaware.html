    <h1>Ca Casinos Instant Withdrawal Casino Atlantis Casino Spa 7Bit Casino Promo Code Hotels Near Delaware</h1>

<p>So basically, i have 200 CAD dollars in my wallet, but when i tried to withdraw, it says that i need to play 2005$ dollars before i can withdraw, wich is 10x times my wallet. I did use 2 bonus : one was the full bet refund if lost (that i lost) and the other was the 100% bonus money with the casino (i lost the wagering too).</p>
<p>So now, i'm stuck with 200$ in my wallet that i can't withdraw, and i need to play 10 times my wallet before i'm able to do so. So even if i win a bet, i won't even be able to withdraw it and cash it out. I won nothing over bonus, since i lost both. So why is it that high ? I'm really about to just give up on Cbet and say goodbye to my money, cause i didn't plan on betting for that much, i was only doing it for fun at the beginning, but now i feel kinda scammed not gonna lie.. My verification was all good, everything is verified and approved, i'm not trying to fraud anyone or anything, that's my money, and i want to be able to get it back. I deposit 340$ in total and for now, i won't ever be able to see that money again, wich is not really nice. If i knew that before deposit my money, i wouldn't have done it.</p>
<p>Thanks for your time !</p>
