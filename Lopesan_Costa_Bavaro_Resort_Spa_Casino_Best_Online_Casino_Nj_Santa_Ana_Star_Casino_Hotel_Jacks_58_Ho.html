    <h1>Lopesan Costa Bavaro Resort Spa Casino Best Online Casino Nj Santa Ana Star Casino Hotel Jacks 58 Ho</h1>

<p>I had made a winning and asked to be excluded from the account for 7 days, as I wanted to lock-in my winnings and be sure to not gamble during an especially stressful period of my time, shortly after loosing a loved one. It was devastating, as you can imagine, and I knew I might have used gambling as a way to distract myself.</p>
<p>One day I found the account shortly re-opened, and in a short period of intense gambling went from roughly +$20,000 to a loss of roughly -$50,000.</p>
<p>I was a previously self-excluded player for life from one of their sister companies, goldenbet, where I made it clear this was because of a serious addiction, but for some reason this self-exclusion wasn't applied to velobet. In addition to this, the fact that I expressly stated to have my account closed for 7 days THROUGH VELOBET, and during that period of time it was still open, makes me believe that the comapny did not follow procedures in line with the Curacao gambling policy on responsible gambling.</p>
<p>See the screenshot attached, where I make it abundantly clear to a live agent that under no circumstance I want to risk having to gamble my money again for at least one week, during which ALL THE TRAGEDY INSTEAD ENDED UP HAPPENING. If the word of the company would have been followed, I would still have roughly 21,000EUR in my account and would have not been able to make further deposits. Hence, I want a refund of all the money lost if the account would have instead stayed closed from the 18 December to the 25 December, as I had asked.</p>
<p>I know that the company is keen to remain fully compliant with gambling standards and protect its players. A mistake has been made by an operator in re-opening my account and, while this is understandable, the amount of money is large and I really need for the situation to be settled and for a recognition of an inconsistency in implementing player protection standards has been made.</p>
