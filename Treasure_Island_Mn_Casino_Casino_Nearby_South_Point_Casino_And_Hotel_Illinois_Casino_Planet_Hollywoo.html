    <h1>Treasure Island Mn Casino Casino Nearby South Point Casino And Hotel Illinois Casino Planet Hollywoo</h1>

<p>The IBIA praised the operator for recognizing the association’s operator-run integrity monitoring network</p>
<p>Galera.bet, a Brazilian sports betting brand, has joined the International Betting Integrity Association (IBIA). The move highlights the company’s desire to promote legal gambling and oppose gambling-related fraud.</p>
<p>Galera’s admission into the IBIA fulfills a legal obligation outlined in Brazil’s Provisional Measure that requires local operators to join an international sports integrity body. As a result, the Brazilian company will join a family encompassing around 50 companies and 125 betting brands, united against the manipulation of sports and sports betting.</p>
<p>IBIA members represent around 60% of the Brazilian iGaming and online sports betting market. The IBIA forayed into Brazil earlier this year, as the LATAM country started to prepare for the eventual launch of regulated sports betting in the country.</p>
<p>Galera.bet is a brand with a strong desire to support sports, as proven by its sponsorship agreement with the Campeonato Brasileiro Série A.</p>
<p>The IBIA, meanwhile, is a non-profit organization that seeks to shield the sports and sports betting sectors from the manipulation of match outcomes and betting markets. The international body leverages various monitoring tools to identify and report suspicious activity.</p>
<p>Galera.bet Wants to Protect Sports Betting from Fraud</p>
<p>Galera.bet’s chief executive officer, Marcos Sabiá, expressed his company’s excitement about the partnership with the IBIA. He said that joining the organization is an honor for his team, which is looking forward to doubling down on integrity.</p>
<p>Sabiá added that the collaboration between IBIA partners would be instrumental in cracking down on fraud in sports and sports betting.</p>
<p>We believe that collaboration between partners is extremely important to protecting the integrity of sport and betting markets from corruption. We hope this is the beginning of a long and successful partnership. Marcos Sabiá, CEO, galera.bet</p>
<p>Meanwhile, IBIA’s chief executive officer, Khalid Ali, welcomed galera.bet as a member of the IBIA. He said that the move will solidify IBIA’s position in Brazil ahead of its launch of regulated sports betting.</p>
<p>Ali praised Brazil and galera.bet for their recognition of the importance of IBIA’s work.</p>
<p>[Galera.bet] recognizes the unique benefits of IBIA’s operator-run integrity monitoring network and its ability to track members’ individual consumer transactional activity, rather than just analyzing simple odds movements. Khalid Ali, CEO, IBIA</p>
<p>Ali concluded that the IBIA covers over $137 billion in annual betting turnover, making it the most reliable integrity network in the world.</p>
