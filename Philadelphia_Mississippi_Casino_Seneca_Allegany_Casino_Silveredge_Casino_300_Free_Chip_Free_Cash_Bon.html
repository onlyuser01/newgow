<p>A 31-year-old woman allegedly urinated on the wall of the Starbucks at the Wendover Nugget Hotel &amp; Casino in West Wendover, Nev. on Sunday. She also shoved an employee inside the gaming property, and later assaulted two police officers in separate incidents, authorities reveal.</p>

<p>Rashelle Brown, 31, of Salt Lake City was reported to police as an “unwanted guest” by casino staff at 2 pm after causing a disturbance at the casino. She pulled down her pants before allegedly urinating, according to the Elko Daily Free Press, a local newspaper.</p>
<p>Brown struggled with police as officers attempted to take her to the patrol car, according to police reports. A male and a female officer forced her to the ground. She then scratched the male officer’s hand with her fingernails.</p>
<p>Eventually, three officers were able to place Brown in a patrol car.</p>
<p>Brown Faces Battery, Other Charges</p>
<p>Eventually, Brown was driven to police headquarters. However, while at the local police station, Brown allegedly kicked a fourth officer.</p>
<p>By the time she was placed in a holding cell, she was charged with battery, urinating in public, three counts of resisting a public officer, and two counts of battery by a prisoner, the Free Press reported.</p>
<p>If convicted, she could face years in prison. She was being held earlier this week in Nevada’s Elko County Jail. Her bail was set at $43,275. She was expected to appear in local court sometime this week.</p>
<p>West Wendover is located at the Utah-Nevada border. It is located 123 miles west of Salt Lake City.</p>
<p>Guests Gone Wild</p>
<p>Unfortunately, casinos are no stranger to sometimes strange and vulgar acts.</p>
<p>In Pennsylvania, this July, Henry Ellis, 46, of Camden, N.J., was arrested after he allegedly exposed himself near the Mohegan Sun Pocono casino.</p>
<p>Ellis was charged with aggravated assault, recklessly endangering another person, fleeing or attempting to elude a police officer, and resisting arrest. He allegedly punched another man, and also allegedly exposed his genitalia.</p>
<p>In September, a 49-year-old Fitchburg, Mass. man was arrested for indecent exposure and public drunkenness. That’s after a Pennsylvania state trooper spotted him defecating in a flowerbed outside of the Hollywood Casino York.</p>
<p>The unnamed man was seen squatting outside of the Springettsbury Township, Pa. gaming property. He was half-naked and heavily intoxicated, the York Dispatch, a Pennsylvania newspaper reported. Police claim the man was unclothed below the waist, exposing his buttocks and genitals.</p>
