<p>Ho Ho Cash Slot Review</p>
<p>‘Tis the season to be jolly and scoop up some nice rewards prone to inject the holiday spirit into you with Nucleus Gaming’s 2020 Ho Go Cash release. The classic winter holiday-inspired 5×3 video slot welcomes plays into a cozy scenery, in a living room decorated with everything Christmasy in sight. As players take their time and grab the festive gifts given to them as prizes and bonuses, they are joined by the Magical Snowman and Father Christmas, the undisputable leaders of the majestic Winter Celebrations.</p>
<p>Players who love a good seasonal theme executed flawlessly should keep exploring our Ho Ho Cash online slot review and learn all about the graphics design, animations, storyline, soundtrack, gameplay, paytable, symbols, and special features.</p>
<p>Theme, Storyline, and Graphics: It’s Time for Hot Cocoa, Glitter &amp; Snow</p>
<p>Get ready to sip on your hot cocoa, chew on the tasty gingerbread house, spin the dreidel, or sit beneath the Christmas trees and wait for gift-bearing Santa while listening to cheerful holiday music. This is basically what Ho Ho Cash is all about. The game nicely captures the holiday spirit with the help of the chosen theme, excellent graphics that Nucleus Gaming is best known for, and carefully chosen game symbols.</p>
<p>Players are invited to watch out for Santa’s elves and cross their fingers for the Magical Snowman and Santa Claus to make an appearance on the grid. The warm background showcases a living room with its Christmas decorations, with special emphasis on the wooden staircase visible to the left and the massive Christmas tree packed with cool ornaments to the right.</p>
<p>The action is cleverly set in the middle of the night, as shown by the night sky visible behind the reels. As the reels start to move, a fireplace is noticed in the background of the magic-filled living room. The action unfolds as the reels keep spinning, revealing more of the symbols that can attract free spins and larger payouts. Just what slot players want to find under the tree on Christmas morning!</p>
<p>Ho Ho Cash: Game Symbols and Payouts</p>
<p>Players can opt for bets ranging from 0.10 to 10 coins on the 10 fixed paylines that are available. The lowest-paying symbols in the paytable are the playing cards. Matching five identical card symbols will reward players with 15x the stake. While they might seem like they are interrupting the festive mood, the card symbols which are pretty standard for the great majority of video slots on the market were given a special wooden-like design This makes them perfectly blend in with the rest of the symbols and keep the wintery design flowing.</p>
<p>Next in line, Santa’s helpers are the mid-paying symbols triggering between wins worth 25x the stake for blue and green elves and 50x the stake for pink elves that look like fairy symbols for five matching symbols across a single payline.</p>
<p>The purple elf holding a purple collection toy car pays 2x for three matching symbols and 50x the stake for five-of-a-kind. The highest-paying symbol is Santa Claus. The symbol pays off 2.5x or three symbols, 15x for four symbols, and 75x for five in a row. The game also hosts a Wild symbol represented by the cool gingerbread house symbols. The Wild pays off 5x, 20x, or 100x the stake for three, four, or five matching symbols.</p>
<p>Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>No Christmas would be fun without the right jolly, seasonal music to accompany the festive meals and snacks and wintery activities. As expected, Ho Ho Cash features an excellent soundtrack with excellent sound effects that manage to complement the mood. While there aren’t many animations to catch your eye, the easily recognizable festive sounds and top-notch, colorful graphics make up for it.</p>
<p>Ho Ho Cash Gameplay</p>
<p>Like all of Nucleus’ games, the slot comes with simple game controls, rules, and settings that are in a dedicated Information section (“i” tab). Players can instantly select their desired bet amounts using the available +/- signs, toggle between Turbo and regular play mode, mute or unmute the background music and special sound effects as desired, and even activate Autospin mode before they jump into the action. The game pays left to right. The highest win per line is paid out. At the same time, any coinciding wins on different paylines will be added together.</p>
<p>Ho Ho Cash: Free Spins, Wilds, Buy Feature &amp; Double Up Game</p>
<p>The game comes with plenty of special features and symbols that make the gameplay even more appealing. The Magical Snowman should be paid close attention to, as matching three, four, or five of these symbols anywhere on the reels will bring players five, seven, or nine free spins. While the free spins feature is enabled, all spins are guaranteed to come with a win.</p>
<p>Even more, for each fresh Snowman Scatter that is seen landing during the same active feature, players receive two additional spins.</p>
<p>To engage the Bonus Buy feature and immediately access the Free Spins feature, players who are willing to pay an extra cost can do that and cross their fingers to land the Bonus Buy Coin Symbols. This will lead to a massive cost reduction of up to 100% for the Bonus Buy option.</p>
<p>At the end of each base game, players are given a choice: gamble all or 50% of their winnings and either double the wins or lose everything in a split second. This is called the Double Up Game and it requires players to choose Heads or Tails to learn the outcome of the bet game.</p>
<p>Final Thoughts</p>
<p>Ho Ho Cash by Nucleus Gaming brings the winter season and the spirit of the festive holidays straight to players’ computer, tablet, or smartphone screens. Whether it’s December or July and you feel like watching Santa, its elves, and some glittery decorations spinning on the reels while listening to jolly Christmas music, chances are you are going to appreciate Nucleus Gaming’s release. The excellent visuals and soundtrack are complemented by the cool features that are ready to trigger generous wins.</p>
