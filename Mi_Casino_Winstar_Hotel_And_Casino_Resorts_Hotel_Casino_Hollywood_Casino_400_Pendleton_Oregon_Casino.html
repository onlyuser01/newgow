    <h1>Mi Casino Winstar Hotel And Casino Resorts Hotel Casino Hollywood Casino 400 Pendleton Oregon Casino</h1>

<p>Ok so we are now on day 9 from the date of the request to withdraw. I received a email yesterday to say my withdrawal was approved, no details of when it will be paid other than now it will be processed, but if you would like any more help or information please contact live chat, which I did and spoke to 3 member of staff so far by far the worse is Harry who shouldn’t even bother answering the chat log log as you are very bluntly told you will receive it soon! The rest of the members of staff are questionable however I have found Jack the most helpful. Here is my most recent chat log.</p>
<p>Please wait for a site operator to respond...</p>
<p>Operator Sebastian has joined the chat.</p>
<p>Hi there, how may I help you?</p>
<p>14:12</p>
<p>Hello</p>
<p>14:13</p>
<p>Hi Sebastian I am looking to find out where my withdrawal is and a time scale to how long it will be before I receive it. I would like it noted I have contacted Casino Guru for there help in this matter.</p>
<p>username: <strong><em>*</em></strong>*</p>
<p>14:13</p>
<p>May I have your email address please?</p>
<p>14:14</p>
<p><strong><em>*</em></strong><strong>*</strong>@hotmail.co.uk</p>
<p>14:15</p>
<p>I see that your withdraw is already approved and in the list of payout</p>
<p>14:15</p>
<p>it should be paid shortly</p>
<p>14:16</p>
<p>But all I’m ever told is soon is that today? Tomorrow next week is there no time scale with your withdrawal processes?</p>
<p>14:17</p>
<p>I see that you have sent an complain also and they are doing their best to process asap.</p>
<p>chat ended.</p>
<p>Again very evasive no real information just same old you will receive it soon. For a small casino they seem to have no order or processing time scales to pass back to the client/ customer to reassure them.</p>
<p>so we shall again wait and see.</p>
<p>kind regards</p>
