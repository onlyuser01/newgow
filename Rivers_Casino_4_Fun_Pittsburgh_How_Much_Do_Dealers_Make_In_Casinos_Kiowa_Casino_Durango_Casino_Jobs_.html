<p>EggOMatic review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>EggOMatic opens with an animated chicken explaining with a lot of clucking and a few graphs suggesting that egg output is down and only the EggOMatic machine can save it. We are then whisked to a retro-futurist world in which the style of the 1950s lives on in a robot chicken coop where the EggOMatic churns out all the riveted eggs you could want.</p>
<p>It is a strange and amusing setup but one which is so beautifully realised you barely question it after the initial confusion wears off.</p>
<p>High quality visuals in EggOMatic slot machine</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The graphics are gorgeous. Proper 3D animation brings each of the strange chicken robots to life, and every little detail is given a bit of spice with small animations and excellent sound effects.</p>
<p>There is original music playing in the background along with industrial noises. The spins then add a whole new range of sound effects.</p>
<p>The entire design has been very carefully created by NetEnt to keep you interested and avoid boredom.</p>
<p>When Wild symbol meets the egg you'll get a nice extra win</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Similarly, the gameplay has plenty of little twists that help keep things fun by introducing variety.</p>
<p>Although at first EggOMatic appears to be a twenty win line slot on five reels, it has an additional twist in which the EggOMatic feeds bonus eggs along the top of the reels. Each spin moves the bonus eggs to the left by one reel until they fall off the end and leave the game.</p>
<p>If you hit a wild on a reel the bonus egg is activated (full details of the bonus eggs can be found below).</p>
<p>These bonus eggs are the key gameplay element and add a lot to the enjoyment of each spin as you watch to see what the EggOMatic will feed out next.</p>
<p>Gameplay video featuring 25 free spins and big wins</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>While all other symbols act as basic symbols, the Wild symbol does a whole range of things based on whether there is a bonus egg above the reel it lands on.</p>
<p>The Wild symbol always subs for any other symbol on a win line. But it also has the following features based on the type of bonus egg is activated:</p>
<p>No egg : Most of the time the machine produces no bonus egg. In this case the Wild acts as a regular Wild .</p>
<p>Coin : These eggs are numbered. When activated by the Wild they give the player the number of coins written on the egg . The numbers are always between 50 and 2500 multiplied by the bet level.</p>
<p>Spreading Wild: This egg turns every symbol around the Wild symbol into Wild symbols too. The wins are then calculated.</p>
<p>Hitting an egg and Wild awards free spins bonus</p>
<p>Free Spins: These eggs also have a number written on them. When activated they provide that number of free spins . The number of free spins is always between seven and fifty. During the free spins EggOMatic produces a bonus egg every spin.</p>
<p>Surprise Egg: Contains a random bonus egg.</p>
<p>The free spins can be retriggered.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player is a satisfactory 96.48%, every bit higher than 96% is considered an average in our books.</p>
<p>The bet size ranged from £/$/€0.20 per spin right up to £/$/€200.00 per spin.</p>
<p>Top symbols paytable</p>
<p>Low symbols paytable</p>
<p>The variance in this game is medium. Unfortunately, many of our preferred strategies work best with, or require, high volatility in a slot.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>EggOMatic is a great slot. It combines a fun and original theme and style with a wide range of bonuses and features, good pacing, and lovely animations.</p>
<p>It has a reasonable RTP of 96.48%, but only medium volatility.</p>
<p>It is an all rounder and a light recommendation from us.</p>
