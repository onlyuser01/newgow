<p>Collin Morikawa’s Disastrous Tournament of Champions Finish a Wild Ride for Bettors</p>

<p>Collin Morikawa and the golf gods weren’t on good terms Sunday afternoon in Kapalua at the Sentry Tournament of Champions.</p>

<p>The 2020 PGA champion and 2021 Open winner was on cruise control in Hawaii. Morikawa stood atop the tournament leaderboard from round one through late Sunday.</p>
<p>Morikawa fired rounds of 64-66-65 to take a commanding six-shot lead into Sunday’s final round. His lead lengthened to seven shots after making the turn at -3 thru the outward nine.</p>
<p>Morikawa’s odds on the back nine Sunday were at -20000 (1/200). On those odds, a $100 bet would have won just 50 cents. The line implies a likelihood of 99.5%.</p>
<p>Morikawa didn’t have a blemish on his scorecard through 67 bogey-less holes. With only five holes standing between him and the 25-year-old’s sixth PGA Tour title, oddsmakers and bettors had Morikawa as a done deal.</p>
<p>Late Collapse</p>
<p>Morikawa has shown he’s more than capable of handling the big-time pressure that comes with leading a PGA Tour event. With a swing envied by many, and a seemingly cool head and mental calmness to accompany it, Morikawa was expected to cruise to the Sentry win.</p>
<p>Instead, the nearly unthinkable happened.</p>
<p>After 67 holes, Morikawa made his first bogey on the par-4 14th. He made his second bogey on the very next hole — a bad bogey on the par-5 15th that included a chunked pitch from a closely mowed area around the green. Morikawa then bogeyed the par-4 16th for his third consecutive bogey.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Jon Rahm was on a tear. The Spaniard birdied 12, 13, 14, and eagled the par-5 15th to pull ahead of Morikawa.</p>
<p>Live betting odds swung quickly during Morikawa’s breakdown. For bettors who put a few bucks on Rahm during the back nine, the gamble paid off.</p>
<p>Rahm was as long as 80/1 on the back nine to win on Sunday. Just a $10 bet on that line returned $800.</p>
<p>Morikawa Mishap</p>
<p>Morikawa’s relatively young career is off to a Hall of Fame start. With two majors already under his belt, Morikawa also played on the victorious 2021 US Ryder Cup team, where he went 3-0-1.</p>
<p>Morikawa, assuming he stays healthy, will almost certainly win more PGA Tour events and add to his already distinguished resume. But on Sunday, he added his name to a record no golfer seeks — the list of the largest blown 54-hole leads in PGA Tour history.</p>
<p>Morikawa joins seven other golfers who have blown six-shot leads on the PGA Tour. The others are Bobby Cruickshank (1929 Florida Open), Gay Brewer (1969 Danny Thomas-Diplomat Classic), Hal Sutton (1983 Anheuser-Busch Golf Classic), Greg Norman (1996 Masters), Sergio Garcia (2005 Wachovia Championship), Spencer Levin (2012 Waste Management Open), and Dustin Johnson (2017 World Golf Championships-HSBC Champions).</p>
<p>Norman’s is certainly the most infamous six-shot meltdown. It marked the third time the Australian golfer finished second or tied for second at the Masters. Norman never won at August National.</p>
<p>Perhaps the best-known golf collapse came in 1999 at The Open Championship, when Frenchman Jean Van de Velde lost a three-shot lead on the 72nd hole at Carnoustie. He then lost in a three-hole aggregate playoff to winner Paul Lawrie.</p>
