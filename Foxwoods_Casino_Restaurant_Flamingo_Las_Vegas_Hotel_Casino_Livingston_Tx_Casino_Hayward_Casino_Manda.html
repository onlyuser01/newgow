<p>A new player on the online casino field, PlayStar, is getting ready to launch its services on the New Jersey market sometime this year. The company will put its faith in long-time industry expert Per Hellberg to lead the brand to success.</p>
<p>PlayStar Appoints Hellberg as Chief Executive Officer</p>
<p>PlayStar is bringing a long-time gaming industry veteran Per Hellberg as CEO as the company prepares to break ground in New Jersey, United States, later this year. Before joining PlayStar, he was chief executive of affiliate market veteran Catena Media. Hellberg similarly served as NordicBet’s former chief executive.</p>
<p>Hellberg is joining PlayStar, confident in the upcoming launch in the United States and in the company’s potential to become a serious challenger brand. Similarly, Hellberg is convinced that PlayStar constitutes a brilliant opportunity for investors who are interested in exploring the potential of the US gaming market.</p>
<p>NordicBet was Hellberg’s making as an iGaming and gaming industry veteran. He was promoted to CEO only five months after originally stepping in as chief marketing officer in 2009. While at NordicBet, the business grew substantially under his guidance and was then bought by Betsson Group in 2012.</p>
<p>Hellberg will now use his expertise and experience to lead PlayStar in the US’s regulated market, beginning with New Jersey. The company has plans to launch in more states through 2022.</p>
<p>PlayStar puts an emphasis on extending an immersive and engaging experience to consumers, making its online casino product a worthwhile market product. This is achieved through excellent customer support, personalization, and engagement that makes visitors feel like throughout the whole experience.</p>
<p>Both Parties Expressed Confidence in PlayStar’s Future on the US Market</p>
<p>Hellberg said he was glad to join PlayStar at a time when the company is preparing to launch its service on the New Jersey market. He is confident the brand has the potential to become a significant player in the US. His belief is that PlayStar would attract investors looking to make use of the US market’s enormous potential.</p>
<p>PlayStar’s executive vice president, Adam Noble, expressed a similar sentiment, outlining a great future ahead:</p>
<p>“With Per’s expertise and experience in online gambling, his intimate knowledge of the affiliate space, and of course, corporate leadership, it’s the perfect time for Per to join and set the company up for success.” PlayStar’s executive vice president, Adam Noble</p>
<p>Last month, PlayStar also announced it had teamed up with Gaming Innovation Group (GiG) to provide the technology for the company’s online casino in New Jersey and secured a multi-year partnership with Ocean Casino Resort.</p>
