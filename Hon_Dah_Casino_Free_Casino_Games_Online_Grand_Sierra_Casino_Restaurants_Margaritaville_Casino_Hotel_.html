<p>Hi</p>
<p>i opened an account with this casino last month. I have deposited and lost 6100$. But suddenly my account closed. I asked the chat support they said I informed my addiction to their group Winz casino that’s why they closed my account. But i was self excluded in their same license casino CASINONIC in last March 2020 because of gambling addiction. I already told my addiction to the same license casino. I will attach the chat history with casino.</p>
