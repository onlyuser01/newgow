<p>OPTX, a technology and data firm based in Las Vegas, has penned a new agreement with Rush Street Gaming, one of the fastest-growing gaming companies in North America. As per the deal, OPTX will provide its new partner with player development AI and connect modules.</p>
<p>OPTX to Power Rush Street with Player Development Tech</p>
<p>Under the agreement between the two parties, OPTX will leverage its casino data and real-time insights capabilities to power Rush Street Gaming with player development AI and connect modules.</p>
<p>The agreement covers all five of Rush Street Gaming’s land-based casinos. As agreed, the tech and data specialist will supply its solutions to the venues for the next three years.</p>
<p>OPTX is a tech company that offers a strong suite of products. Many companies have opted to use OPTX solutions as they have proven to boost player acquisition and retention and facilitate communications between casinos’ staff members and guests.</p>
<p>OPTX’s solutions are employed by various major gaming companies, with one of the most recent ones to ink a deal with the tech company being the Viejas Casino &amp; Resort in San Diego. Under that agreement, OPTX powered the gaming and hospitality venue with a selection of solutions.</p>
<p>The Epitome of OPTX’s Mission</p>
<p>OPTX is beyond delighted to join forces with Rush Street Gaming, as attested by the enthusiasm of Brooke Fiumara, co-chief executive officer of the tech company. She called the agreement with the leading operator “the epitome of OPTX’s mission – revolutionizing what data can do with teams that are leaders in their fields.”</p>
<p>According to Fuimara, Rush Street’s decision to pick OPTX’s platform for player development shows that her company has cemented its position as a cutting-edge solution for casino companies. She noted that her team is very proud of the growth of its products and their effectiveness in increasing productivity and profitability for both small properties and casino chain owners.</p>
<p>Rush Street Gaming’s chief executive officer, Tim Drehkoff, also commented on the new agreement. He noted that his company was looking for a player development solution that has built-in operational functionality for hosts and managers. The operator’s ideal solution was one that is simple to install and intuitive to use. According to Drehkoff, OPTX’s platform is just that and perfectly aligns with what Rush Street was seeking.</p>
<p>In other news, two weeks ago, Rush Street Gaming expanded its team with the appointment of a new senior vice president of human resources. The one who joined the company was Dawn Reynolds Pettit, a professional with years of experience in the field.</p>
