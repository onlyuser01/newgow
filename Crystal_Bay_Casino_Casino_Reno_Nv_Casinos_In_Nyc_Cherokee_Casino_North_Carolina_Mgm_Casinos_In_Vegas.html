<p>The World Series of Poker has planned in-person and online event formats for Europe and the United States players.</p>
<p>Players in US and Europe to Return to WSOP</p>
<p>WSOP is officially back and, after a rather difficult 2020 and a few faux pas on the part of the organizers in the previous edition, the world’s largest poker tournament is finally returning in its in-person live format.</p>
<p>Scheduled for September 30 through November 23, this is good two months of play with the Rio All-Suite Hotel and Casino playing host to the leading poker championship series. WSOP has not yet released full details, but the organization is planning to make the event worthwhile.</p>
<p>A special charity event will kick off in the first week of play along with the $25,000 HORSE and $5 million GTD No-Limit Hold ’em event making sure that the series is off to a strong start. The Main Event, which holds a $10,000 buy-in, should arrive on November 4, and it will continue through November 17.</p>
<p>This year, WSOP is feeling generous and introducing four starting dates meaning that players will have the option to join the race when they feel the time is right. WSOP executive director Ty Stewart argued that the theme of this year’s event is “get vaccinated, get back to Vegas.”</p>
<p>In the press release, WSOP outlines its commitment to upholding COVID-19 safety protocols, although the organization hopes that President Joe Biden’s vaccination plan will come on time and vaccines will prove to have lasting effects. Still, the organization commits to following health instructions and ensures safe few gaming months for everyone:</p>
<p>“The World Series of Poker will be compliant with all directives from the state of Nevada regarding social distancing and capacity limits on the tournament dates.”</p>
<p>More details about the event’s schedule will be revealed over the summer, presenting players with a good idea of what to expect in terms of qualifying events and the chance to win free entry into the main event.</p>
<p>Building on Last Year’s Success</p>
<p>Building on last year’s WSOP Online success, though, the organizers will continue to run the online series and sprinkle the offer with numerous gold bracelet events all throughout the summer.</p>
<p>To make sure that the event marks another record-high participation, WSOP is working with both GGPoker and its own WSOP.com platform through the All-American Poker Network. While the physical event will take some tinkering through, WSOP hopes to have a full schedule for WSOP Online at some point in mid-April.</p>
<p>WSOP Europe is also slated for a return in 2021, with the King’s Casino in Rozvadov, the Czech Republic, playing host. “It’s important to us that we have an excellent tournament schedule available to our European players,” Stewart said.</p>
<p>If there is one main takeaway here that is live poker is back, and WSOP has no intention of going back.</p>
