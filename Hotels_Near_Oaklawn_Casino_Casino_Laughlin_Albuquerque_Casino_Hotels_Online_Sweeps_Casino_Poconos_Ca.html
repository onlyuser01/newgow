<p>The Green Bay Packers ended their embarrassing 5-loss streak last Sunday by beating the favored Dallas Cowboys in overtime. Fast-forward to Week 11 and Matt LaFleur’s men are expected to continue winning. Bookies see them as 3-point favorites against the Tennessee Titans.</p>
<p>There’s one thing that needs to worry them ahead of the Thursday Night Game against Tennessee – the Titans have been fantastic lately with six wins and one overtime loss in the past seven games.</p>

<p>No One Knows What to Expect from the Packers</p>
<p>Last weekend, the Packers defeated the Cowboys 31-28 (28-28) despite being 5-point underdogs. It was the first time they were underdogs in a game played at Lambeau Field this season. Nevertheless, they managed to upset the odds.</p>
<p>What’s interesting is that before the win, they lost five straight games, one of the worst streaks the Packers have experienced in the 21st century. As a result, they’re now 4-6, and their chances of making the postseason don’t look that great.</p>
<p>The team that was seen as a dark horse for winning the Super Bowl before the start of the season might end up without a playoff berth. Of course, they can still turn the tide, but for that to happen, the Packers need to continue winning. Unfortunately for them, beating the in-form Titans won’t be easy.</p>
<p>The Titans are Looking Good Right Now</p>
<p>Tennessee is 6-3 this season with six wins in the previous seven games. Their only loss in that period happened after overtime – the Kansas City Chiefs beat them 20-17 at Arrowhead. Losing by just three points to the mighty Chiefs in Kansas City is something that’s actually worth praise.</p>
<p>Plus, among the teams they defeated are some pretty strong opponents, including the Indianapolis Colts (two times), Denver Broncos, and so on.</p>
<p>The reason behind Tennessee’s fantastic run is their amazing defense. With 18.7 points per game, their defense is eighth in the league. However, when it comes to the last three games, they’re the no.1 team in the league.</p>
<p>Admittedly, their offense hasn’t been as impressive. Their passing game has been abysmal in 2022, with neither Ryan Tannehill nor Malik Willis doing a great job in the quarterback position. Together, the two QBs have passed for 1,493 yards this season and eight TDs, along with 4 interceptions.</p>
<p>Tennessee’s rushing game, however, has been superb. No surprise there when they got Derrick Henry on the roster. One of the best running backs of his generation is having a fantastic season with nine TDs to his name and 923 rushing yards.</p>
<p>Tennessee Titans vs Green Bay Packers Prediction</p>
<p>It’s very likely that Derrick Henry is going to have a good night on TNF. Not only is he a fantastic RB, but the Packers defense hasn’t been great in rushing defense in 2022. In fact, with 140.6 rushing yards allowed per game, they’re the seventh-worst team in the league.</p>
<p>Henry will do a great job in the offense, while we expect the Titans defense to do great as usual. That said, this team isn’t going to embarrass itself on the trip to Wisconsin. In fact, we even think the Titans could grab themselves a win on Thursday night.</p>
<p>Picks: Tennessee Titans +2.5</p>
