<p>Bally’s Interactive and Cleveland Browns have struck a new partnership that puts the gaming giant in the position of an official sports betting collaborator. The tie-up between Bally’s and the NFL franchise will focus on a number of operations, including a new mobile sportsbook as well as a dedicated VIP lounge.</p>
<p>On-site and Mobile Betting by Bally’s in Ohio</p>
<p>While regulatory approval is still needed to clear the partnership, Bally’s already has plans to create a dedicated VIP lounge geared towards the club’s fans at the FirstEnergy Stadium. There will be a number of fan-focused events on-site once all regulators have cleared the lounge for launch.</p>
<p>The lounge will offer various engagement opportunities on game days and generally ensure a state-of-the-art experience for all sports betting fans. Commenting on this opportunity, Haslam Sports Group EVP COO Dave Jenkins said that Bally’s focus on fans is consistent with what the Cleveland Browns strive to achieve. He added:</p>
<p>We look forward to supporting Bally’s efforts to provide these innovative opportunities to Browns fans and all sports fans in Ohio in the near future. Haslam Sports Group EVP COO Dave Jenkins</p>
<p>The company is currently working closely with regulators, Jenkins assured, to make sure that the launch of the lounge can happen no later than January 1, 2023, while Bally’s also works on a mobile sports betting offer that will enable fans from all across the state to engage with the experience.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Bally’s Interactive COO for North America Adi Dhandhania welcomed the opportunity and said that the team at the company was happy to be teaming up with one of the historic franchises in football in Ohio.</p>
<p>Securing sports betting market access is another important milestone for the company as it seeks to expand its gambling products, with Ohio being the 18th state in which Bally’s now planning to launch.</p>
<p>Everything about FirstEnergy Stadium is indicative of what great opportunity Bally’s is offered in setting up the namesake Bally Bet Sportsbook along with its dedicated app. Bally’s been very active in the sports betting industry. The company introduced a free-to-play on time for the last March Madness season and even discussed plans for an integrated resort project in Japan recently.</p>
