<p>Continent 8 Technologies, a provider of managed hosting, connectivity, cloud and security solutions, has launched in Kentucky ahead of the launch of sports betting in the state. This is in line with the company’s first-to-market strategy.</p>
<p>Kentucky continues to move closer to the legalization of online sports betting. The bill that would make wagering legal in the Bluegrass State is currently sitting on Governor Andy Beshear’s desk, waiting to be signed into law.</p>
<p>However, Continent 8, true to its strategy to always be first, forayed into the state even before the market was officially regulated. Kentucky has thus been added to the list of the 25+ states where the supplier’s best-in-class managed hosting, connectivity, cloud and security solutions are available.</p>
<p>As a result, once sports betting officially launches in Kentucky, operators will have access to Continent 8’s full portfolio of solutions. These will be provided by a dedicated Kentucky data center and will support hybrid cloud deployments with hyperscale partners like AWS, GCP and Azure.</p>
<p>Continent 8 Was Once Again First</p>
<p>Continent 8 Technologies’ chief revenue officer, Nick Nally, commented on the development, praising the rapid launch into Kentucky and saying that it was only possible thanks to the company’s profound experience and planning. Nally said that Continent 8 is always working ahead of operator service requirements in order to provide fast to its clients.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Dany Chapdelaine, Continent 8 Technologies’ director of planning and delivery, said:</p>
<p>Our vast regulatory knowledge and experience, coupled with strong relationships with customers, suppliers and vendors has enabled us to deploy our services in Kentucky at a rapid pace. A huge well done to the team involved in this significant project. Dany Chapdelaine, director of planning and delivery, Continent 8 Technologies</p>
<p>Chapdelaine added that Continent 8’s NA-centric approach has seen it become the most trusted infrastructure partner for many operators in the region. The launch in Kentucky is another step toward growing the company’s network.</p>
<p>True to Chapdelaine’s words, Continent 8’s solutions are currently used by the majority of NA operators. Thanks to its first-to-market approach, experience in regulation and hi-tech solutions, Continent 8 is the infrastructure provider of choice for roughly 85% of operators on the operators on the 2023 EGR US Power Ranking.</p>
<p>The expansion in Kentucky will further reinforce the company’s presence in the US scene. The state is expected to be a fairly big sports betting market that will generate $23 million in tax revenue a year.</p>
