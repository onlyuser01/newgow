<p>The Herons Ready to Win their Second Trophy in the Messi Era</p>
<p>Inter Miami has been brilliant since Lionel Messiâ€™s arrival. The Herons have already won the Leagues Cup and came close to breaking into the Top 9 in the MLS. In fact, with Messi on the field, they havenâ€™t lost a single game.</p>
<p>Upcoming matches for #Intermiamicf Lionel Messi, Alba and Busquets might well and truly be back on Wednesday for the Final against Houston ðŸ”¥ #Messi #MLS #Intermiamicf #ORLvMIA pic.twitter.com/onpEMG43ep â€” Inter Miami FC Hub (@Intermiamifchub) September 25, 2023</p>
<p>They did, however, get hammered by Atlanta United some two weeks ago while Messi was away in Argentina on international duty. Further, the soccer GOAT missed Inter Miamiâ€™s most recent MLS game, and his teammates failed to beat Orlando City. Instead, the Florida Derby finished in a 1-1 draw, which isnâ€™t too bad, especially knowing that they played on the road.</p>
<p>This Wednesday, the Herons are playing on their turf. At home, theyâ€™ve always been great, even before Messi joined the club. Thatâ€™s another reason why Inter Miamiâ€™s odds are as short as -145 ahead of the US Open Cup Final.</p>
<p>Can Houston Dynamo Upset the Odds?</p>
<p>Houston Dynamo is 2-1 against Inter Miami in head-to-head matches, but this team has never played against Lionel Messi. The guys from Texas just arenâ€™t as good as Messi &amp; Co., but they do seem to love playing against big favorites.</p>
<p>The evidence of this is that in the last two months, we saw them beat such good teams as Columbus Crew, Real Salt Lake, and Vancouver Whitecaps. We also saw the Texans play a tie with Los Angeles Galaxy and St. Louis City.</p>
<p>Inter Miami vs. Houston Dynamo Prediction</p>
<p>In September 2023, Inter Miami is way, way better than Houston Dynamo. Itâ€™s not just about Messi whoâ€™s the best player in America, but about his teammates as well. The Herons now have a fine roster, which is strong in all areas. On top of everything, they also have a fantastic coach in Gerardo Martino whoâ€™s going to lead them to another trophy this Wednesday.</p>
<p>Pick: Inter Miami to win</p>
