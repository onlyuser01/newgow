<p>The technology distributor and analytics software provider are expanding their reach in Oceania with the addition of five new sites</p>
<p>The expansion is part of a deepening partnership between Gaming Dynamics and Quick Custom Intelligence (QCI). The companies have been operating together for three years in Australia and they are looking to further strengthen their offer at a time when there is surging demand for advanced gaming analytics solutions not just in Oceania, but in all regulated markets around the globe.</p>
<p>Responding to the Demand for Quality Solutions Globally</p>
<p>QCI and Gaming Dynamics are looking to complement each other offers and continue to work closely together as they strive to cater to this demand and realize further business opportunities down the road. Commenting on the opportunity in a press statement, Gaming Dynamics director Tony Toohey focused on what the tie-up has brought to the Australian market first:</p>
<p>The collaboration between QCI and Gaming Dynamics aims to further revolutionize the gaming industry in Australia by offering state-of-the-art gaming analytics tools and insights to casinos and gaming establishments. Gaming Dynamics director Tony Toohey</p>
<p>According to Toohey, there have been significant improvements in the company’s software, including new features that have to do with linked jackpot data and customer gaming preferences, helping businesses calibrate their operations to deliver a personalized experience that will undoubtedly translate into better gains for the end-customer.</p>
<p>Toohey further said that the fact felt confident enough to roll out five new sites in the country was a categorical way for QCI to demonstrate that it remains committed to local market needs but is also poised to continue delivering its cutting-edge product to a global audience.</p>
<p>The partnership with Gaming Dynamics is definitely not to be underestimated either as it allows QCI to not just deploy powerful software but do it in a way that properly assesses what the market needs are and what specific regions need. QCI is further benefiting from working with Gaming Dynamics as it also improves on its own outlook as a market leader when it comes to gaming analytics, Toohey said.</p>
<p>QCI Continues to Evolve and Expand Its Reach Globally</p>
<p>The news was also welcomed by QCI co-founder and CTO Andrew Cardno who was similarly excited about this possibility. QCI presently services more than 110 casino resorts in a number of regions, including North America, Latin America, The Bahamas, New Zealand, and of course, Australia.</p>
<p>Cardno hailed the opportunity to extend and deepen the partnership with Gaming Dynamics first and explained that QCI’s products are constantly in demand.</p>
<p>This has motivated the company to pursue a constant drive towards innovation. QCI is constantly expanding and evolving with local market needs – well beyond Australia, allowing it to service some of the world’s leading gaming establishments.</p>
<p>“As the industry evolves, so do we, ensuring that our clients have access to the most advanced analytics tools and insights available,“ Cardno concluded.</p>
