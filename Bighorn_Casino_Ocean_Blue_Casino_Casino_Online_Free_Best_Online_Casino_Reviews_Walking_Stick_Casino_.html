<p>First Chargers Game with Fans in the Stands of SoFi Stadium</p>
<p>The Chargers (and their local rivals, the Rams) started using the world’s most expensive stadium in 2020. However, COVID-19 got involved last season, making both teams play their home games in front of empty stands of SoFi Stadium.</p>
<p>The good news is that fans are back! The first time the Chargers will host a SoFi game with fans in attendance is the one scheduled for Sunday, when the Cowboys come to LA.</p>
<p>They will have the fan support, but will that be enough for the Chargers to grab a win? Not necessarily. Even though they did win in Week 1, the fact is that they don’t belong in the NFL elite.</p>
<p>As a reminder, in their first game of the 2021 season, the Chargers beat the WFT 20-16. A possible explanation for this is that Washington’s starting quarterback, Ryan Fitzpatrick, injured his hip in the second quarter.</p>
<p>Even though replacement Taylor Heinicke did a fine job, the fact is that the WFT weren’t as dangerous as they could’ve been.</p>
<p>Dak Prescott Ready to Destroy the Chargers Defense</p>
<p>The Chargers defense managed to outsmart the WFT offense. Can they do the same against the Cowboys? Probably not, as Dallas’ starting quarterback has made a comeback. After missing most of the 2020 season, Prescott made a return in the NFL Kick-Off Game. The Bucs beat them, but the Cowboys had a lead through that game.</p>
<p>Led by Prescott, the Cowboys offense was superb, scoring a total of 29 points. Their defense, however, wasn’t that good – they conceded 31 points.</p>
<p>Prescott was nothing of amazing in that game, completing 42 of 58 passes for 403 yards. He made three touchdown passes, with one interception. That’s a heck of an achievement knowing that he and his buddies were playing against one of the league’s best defenses.</p>
<p>In Week 2, Prescott and Co. are playing squaring off against mediocre defense. Sure, it’s been a while since the Chargers last conceded over 30 points (December 6, 2020), but that might change soon. In fact, we could see them getting hammered by the Cowboys on Sunday evening.</p>
<p>Pick: Dallas Cowboys to win and cover the spread; the game goes over 55 points.</p>
