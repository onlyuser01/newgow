<p>Once again, Play‚Äôn GO has approached the title with quite a bit of originality, predicating the gameplay on the bull‚Äôs mood, with Happy, Proud, and Angry mode altering the gaming conditions. Depending on what you get, your gameplay may change with extra Wilds appearing on the reels.</p>
<p>There is a Freedom Round which is triggered once you get the Locked Gate Scatter Symbol and the Bull Scatter on the same spin. If this happens, Benny will smash the Gate and Wilds will fill the reels, making for rich pickings indeed!</p>
<p>The Bull features in the Freedom Spins round will be an exact match to the Base Game, but each feature will bring you three additional Rodeo Bull Wilds for an extra boost to your winnings.</p>
<p>Developing and Evolving Storylines and Characters</p>
<p>Play‚Äôn GO has picked Benny not by chance, but as a continuation of the company‚Äôs efforts to create strong characters that imprint themselves on players‚Äô minds and are recognizable and sought-after experiences.</p>
<p>Play‚Äôn GO head of games Charlotte Miliziano welcomed the addition and said that this is a worthy addition to the studio‚Äôs growing network of titles. She said:</p>
<p>We‚Äôve been looking to give Benny the Bull a new adventure since he caused mayhem in Bull in a China Shop. Play‚Äôn GO head of games Charlotte Miliziano</p>
<p>Miliziano said that the company was particularly proud of the way it has been developing characters and then helping with that character development across new games. In wrapping up his comment, he teased that new adventures may be in store for Benny and his friends, and escaping the rodeo opens new opportunities.</p>
