    <h1>Las Vegas Hotels And Casinos On The Strip Casino Montgomery Alabama Casino Wild Horse Pass Az Casino</h1>

<p>Hello thank you for picking up my case. My account was fully verified on August 7th, it was a back and forth from June 6th to August 7th to get verified, as I had to keep resubmitting documents to them. As for bonus I have a correspondence with them explaining that I did not want the bonus when I deposited but it was automatically added to my account. With that being said that conversation essentially entailed my confusion on how I was given the bonus when I did not apply any code to my deposit. I go on to try and understand the bonus they gave me because no matter what I tried to place I had a max bet of $25 when the rollover requirement was $147,958.65 and that had to be completed in 26 days from the time of me emailing them my confusion on the matter. After the 26 days they removed $8,500 from my account. In that moment I started the KYC process so I could remove any money I had in there after the took that amount I was fed up as you could expect. Anyhow since then I have only used real money wagers in there and the account is back up to $6,074.96. Why I continued to make wagers in there one may ask? Quite frankly I assumed the money was lost so why not, then I found this outlet and it gave me a flash of hope that I can get it out of there. The last time I was able to get in contact with them was the day my account got verified, August 7th, it was just about getting the KYC done. Since then I have not been able to get in live chat and have not had any emails receive a response. But, I have gotten three separate emails talking about more deposit bonuses so they have the time to send me marketing emails just not reply to me about anything that matters.</p>
