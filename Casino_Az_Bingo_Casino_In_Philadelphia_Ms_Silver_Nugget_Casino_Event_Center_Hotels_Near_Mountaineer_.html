<p>Existing Wild Card members needn’t worry as they will be automatically onboarded to the new program</p>
<p>Hard Rock Atlantic City is set to introduce its Unity loyal program today, allowing regular customers to benefit from a variety of promotions. The new program will replace the existing Wild Card program.</p>
<p>Unity is a loyalty scheme that is available across Hard Rock’s properties in North America. The unified scheme allows customers to enjoy the same benefits no matter which Unity-enabled venue in the region they visit.</p>
<p>While rates will vary depending on which Hard Rock property customers visit, they will be able to earn tier credits, comps and free play in all of the company’s properties. Hard Rock AC guests will now be able to download the mobile application and see what the fuss is all about.</p>
<p>Existing Wild Card members needn’t worry as they will be automatically onboarded to the new program. This seamless process will allow them to keep their existing tier points, balances and offers. While Wild Card members can change their card, they won’t be required to.</p>
<p>The transition from Wild Card to Unity was a gradual process in Atlantic City. The property onboarded some of its high-tier members last year and is now rolling out the program for all customers.</p>
<p>Players Can Earn Points in a Variety of Ways</p>
<p>The Unity program boasts four tiers, as follows:</p>
<p>Star</p>
<p>Legend</p>
<p>Icon</p>
<p>X</p>
<p>The four tiers mirror the four Wild Card tiers (Premier, Elite, Royalty and X) and allow for an easy transition of existing consumers.</p>
<p>Hard Rock’s Unity program is available across 13 Hard Rock venues in North America, as well as at the Hard Rock Casino Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic.</p>
<p>The launch of Unity in Atlantic City comes in the wake of Hard Rock’s acquisition of WGames, which enabled the launch of Hard Rock Games. The latter is a social gaming platform that features a variety of free-to-play casino games. For reference, Hard Rock Games will also be integrated with the Unity program, allowing players to earn points they can later redeem at one of the company’s properties.</p>
<p>While players can play the Hard Rock Games at no cost, they can also enjoy a variety of paid offerings that allow them to earn points.</p>
<p>In other news, Hard Rock recently secured approval for its Kenosha property. A few days earlier, the company held a groundbreaking ceremony for its Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino Tejon.</p>
