<p>Pragmatic Play, the innovative multi-vertical iGaming studio, has taken a new spin on its traditional and player-favorite mythology-themed game, Gates of Olympus. The studio has introduced a revamped version of Gates of Olympus 1000, which focuses on bringing the familiar gameplay with an updated look, feel, and even a handful of features.</p>
<p>Much like in the original title, slot players set out to collect crowns, gems, and goblets, trying to score a big win, which has gotten even bigger. In the new game, the action takes place across a6x5 grid and comes with the popular tumbling wins mechanic.</p>
<p>Zeus, ever mighty and all-seeing, will throw thunderbolts that correspond with his crotchety nature, and each of these could introduce multipliers ranging from 2x to 1,000x, for the heroic experience that you have ever wanted to try!</p>
<p>The multipliers will work in both the base game, but also in the free spins level which is triggered with 3 Scatter Symbols for a total of 15 free rounds. There is the chance to win 15,000x the size of the player, which makes the latest instalment in the established franchise a desired and much-enjoyable feature through and through.</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play Chief Operating Officer Irina Cornides welcomed the introduction of the new game and said that the entire team was very excited to offer a new opportunity for players who love the original game to experience it in a slightly more rewarding and refreshed setting.</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play has definitely been enjoying the Ancient Mythology theme, judging by its latest track record, featuring games such as Wisdom of Athena and Zeus vs Hades â€“ Gods of War. All in all, Gates of Olympus is a worthwhile addition to the pantheon of outstanding titles developed by the studio.</p>
<p>Speaking of thematic experiences, Pragmatic Play has spared no effort in developing original concepts that are known to stick with players. The studio has recently introduced its 96.05% RTP game, Viking Forge, for a touch of Nordic mythology. The studio also rolled out its Timber Stacks 5x5-grid game.</p>
