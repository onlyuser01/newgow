<p>In March, Manchester City and crypto exchange platform OKX signed an important multi-million partnership deal. As a result, OKX became the first official crypto exchange partner of the Premier League team. The two parties have now agreed to expand their partnership, turning OKX into the club’s new training kit sponsor for the 2022-23 season. What does this mean for the football club and the crypto exchange platform? Let’s find out.</p>
<p>OKX Has Paid a Seven-Figure Sum</p>
<p>While the actual terms of the agreement have not been revealed yet, the expanded partnership is expected to bring Man City more than $20 million throughout the season. The club is ranked as the sixth most-valuable soccer club on the planet, with an estimated worth of $4.25 billion. The new partnership expansion will also engage Man City players in a series of OKX educational videos teaching sports aficionados about the world of cryptocurrency exchanges.</p>
<p>OKX will be replacing Expo 2020 Dubai as the front sponsor for the club’s training kit, which previously replaced ex-sponsor MarathonBet.</p>
<p>As part of the new partnership expansion, OKX will have murals of Jack Grealish, Joao Cancelo, John Stones, and Erling Haaland displayed in four different locations across Manchester. Each location will host a dedicated QR code that will allow the club’s fans to potentially win a season ticket to OKX’s hospitality box.</p>
<p>City Football Group’s chief operating officer Roel de Vries expressed the group’s pleasure to expand their relationship with OKX. De Vries added the two partners were “aligned on values such as innovation and success” while reinforcing that “everything starts with training and education” for both of them.</p>
<p>Supercharging the Fan experience Since March 2022</p>
<p>The two parties have been working together in an effort to “supercharge” fans’ experiences using appealing content activations. At the moment, both Man City and OKX are looking forward to keeping up with the same string of developments and taking advantage of the upcoming opportunities in 2023. In spite of the crypto market slowdown, OKX continues to push ahead with its plans to extend its business. One of its main goals is to grow its workforce by 30%, aiming at a staff consisting of 5,000 employees.</p>
<p>OKX’s chief marketing officer Haider Rafique said the company will continue to choose partners who reflect their beliefs and focus. Both Man City and OKX remain open to additional partnership expansions provided they are happy with their current deal. OKX was established in 2017 by crypto entrepreneur Star Xu and has turned into the second-biggest cryptocurrency exchange platform by trading volume and derivates, with more than 20 million users. The company operates in over 180 global markets. Last year, OKX processed over 25 billion trades. At the beginning of the month, Manchester City signed 8Xbet as their official sportsbook partner in Asia.</p>
