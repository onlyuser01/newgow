    <h1>Intertops Red Casino Senior Bus Trips To Casinos Ignitiom Casino Casinos In Lake Charles Louisiana W</h1>

<p>Major League Soccer /MLS/ has announced its decision to suspend all scheduled for the next 30 days games due to the growing concerns from the outbreak of coronavirus, the same reason the United States Soccer Federation has called off matches for the national teams, both men’s and women’s, scheduled to take place in March and April.</p>
<p>No Professional Soccer In The Next 30 Days</p>
<p>The season of the professional soccer league of the USA and Canada that has started less than a month ago will be halted in an attempt from the clubs to join forces with all governmental efforts to limit events that gather a lot of people, with the hope to reduce the spread of the Covid-19 virus which has already turned into a global pandemic. Suspension is with immediate effect as the league officials continue to monitor and assess the situation.</p>
<p>“Our clubs were united today in the decision to temporarily suspend our season — based on the advice and guidance of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Public Health Agency of Canada and other public health authorities, and in the best interest of our fans, players, officials and employees.” Don Garber, Commissioner, MLS</p>
<p>The Generation adidas Cup, the premier youth tournament in the country, scheduled to run from April 4-11 in Frisco, Texas, fell victim of the virus outbreak, as MLS cancelled the 2020 tournament, where 40 academies from 11 countries were set to compete.</p>
<p>No International Friendlies Until The End Of April</p>
<p>Professional soccer in the US has been affected on a national level, too, as all games that have been scheduled to take place in March and April, men’s, friendlies against the Netherlands and Wales in Europe, and women’s, friendlies hosting Australia and Brazil have been cancelled.</p>
<p>Medical officials decided that with regards to the health of players, coaches, staff and fans being the priority, it was in the best interest of all to cancel the majority of both domestic and international camps at all professional levels, as the coronavirus pandemic spread continued.</p>
<p>“We have been in communication with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as well as state and local departments of public health, and after those conversations and continuously monitoring the situation, we strongly believe this is the best decision considering the ongoing worldwide health situation.” George Chiampas, US Soccer Federation, Chief Medical Officer.</p>
<p>Professional Sports Fall Victim To The Virus</p>
<p>MLS is not the first professional soccer league around the world to suspend games, with Serie A in Italy cancelling all matches until April 3, Spanish LaLiga also off for the next two weeks, and in France games until April 15 scheduled to play behind closed doors.</p>
<p>MLS becomes the next sports professional league to be suspended after earlier in the week the NBA 2019-2020 season was suspended due to a player testing positive for Covid-19.</p>
