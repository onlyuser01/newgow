<p>Chris Kambourov, Sesame's Casino Manager, shared his excitement about the new collaboration in a statement released on January 16, 2023, saying that the company is delighted to expand its list of partners by adding 7777 gaming.</p>
<p>"Sesame strives to bring the best in online gambling entertainment in Bulgaria, and we feel that by teaming up with 7777 gaming, we will be able to provide our players with top-notch games and excellent iGaming solutions," said Kambourov in conclusion.</p>

A team of leading experts at 7777 gaming is in charge of the development of those games that are designed in-house.</p>
<p>The collaboration with Sesame comes after only recently, 7777 gaming inked a content deal with Hub88, a leading supplier aggregator.
