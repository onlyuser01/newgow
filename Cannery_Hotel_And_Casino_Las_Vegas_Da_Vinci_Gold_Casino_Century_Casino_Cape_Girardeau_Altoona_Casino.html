<p>The operation took place earlier this week and saw five people arrested over their involvement in the operation of an illegal gambling den</p>
<p>Countries across the globe continuously fight against illegal gambling activities. The black market is often tied to criminal activities, including money laundering and terrorism financing but also increases violent crimes. India is one of the countries in Asia that has an ongoing dedication to fight illegal gambling.</p>
<p>Recently, a massive raid resulted in the arrest of five people, allegedly involved in illegal gambling activities in Port Blair, a capital city of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in India. The police operation was conducted on Tuesday. A report released by bnn confirms that the operation was organized by the Deputy Superintendent of Police (CID) in collaboration with Rajeev Ranjan, senior superintendent with the IPS who supervised the process.</p>
<p>The five individuals arrested during the raid were reportedly hiding in Dollygunj Basti. Busting the illegal gambling operation, law enforcement seized some RS 15,260 ($184), described as “stake money.”</p>
<p>The special operation underlined the commitment of law enforcement to continue the fight against illegal gambling. Moreover, the police sent a message with the latest raid that it is prepared to investigate and punish people involved in illegal gambling.</p>
<p>Public Encouraged to Report Illegal Gambling and Other Crimes</p>
<p>The five people who allegedly participated in the illegal gambling operation were arrested under Section 5/7 of the Andaman and Nicobar Gambling Regulation 1951, a law that was designed specifically to combat gambling-related crimes in the country. It is yet to be confirmed what punishment the five people who were allegedly involved in the operation of the illegal gambling den can expect.</p>
<p>Besides information regarding the recent raid, local law enforcement confirmed they remain on high alert for similar crimes. Police also encouraged the public to report illegal gambling or other unlawful activities via hotlines for tips. It’s no surprise that individuals who report such crimes will remain anonymous and their details will not be disclosed.</p>
<p>Recently, in an effort against illegal online gambling, India blocked 22 betting apps and websites. Announced back in November, the initiative sought to prevent people from accessing illegal gambling applications and websites. This was achieved via blocking orders issued by the country’s Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, prohibiting access to the aforementioned betting outlets.</p>
<p>Before that, in October, India confirmed its intention to increase the gambling tax applicable for online gambling activities. At the time, the country greenlighted a proposal that raises the tax to 28% for iGaming, an effort that may shake the market.</p>
