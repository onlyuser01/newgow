<p>MGM Resorts and BetMGM will work with the National Council on Problem Gambling to educate workers and customers on responsible gambling and gambling addiction.</p>
<p>MGM Resorts and BetMGM Join Forces With NCPG</p>
<p>US-based casino and hospitality company MGM Resorts and its online sports betting venture BetMGM have joined forces with the National Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG) to raise awareness of gambling addiction.</p>
<p>As part of their engagement with the campaign to promote Problem Gambling Awareness Month, MGM Resorts and BetMGM have committed to weekly employee education on the matter. The ultimate intention of the education series, which will be provided by EPIC Risk Management, is to help protect consumers.</p>
<p>NCPG’s entire awareness campaign is designed with consumer protection in mind. According to the organization, the initiative has two primary goals: to increase public awareness of problem gambling and to encourage healthcare workers to screen clients for gambling addiction.</p>
<p>Problem gambling is an often overlooked or underestimated form of addiction. The illness has received increased visibility in recent years, but certainly not to the level that it merits. The NCPG warns that with the rapid legalization of online sports betting across the US, addiction rates will likely spike up.</p>
<p>MGM Resorts and BetMGM Will Also Take On Individual Responsibilities</p>
<p>In addition to their joint effort to raise awareness, MGM Resorts and BetMGM will also work individually to further aid the cause.</p>
<p>MGM Resorts will be actively engaged with the GameSense program. GameSense is an initiative designed to inform players and help them gamble responsibly. The program has been running since 2017 and also educates casino and racing entertainment staff in addition to the players themselves.</p>
<p>BetMGM will promote Gambling Disorder Screening Day, an annual one-day event that aims to educate and support healthcare providers in screening for problem gambling. The event launched in 2014 and is hosted by the Cambridge Health Alliance.</p>
<p>BetMGM Responsible Gambling Program Manager Richard Taylor affirmed the brand’s commitment to the cause, which he said was of critical importance. According to him, the company will provide its employees with the responsible gambling tools, information, and empowerment they need.</p>
<p>Taylor also elaborated on the weekly education seminar for the brand’s employees. He explained that employees will hear from experts about the nature of problem gambling, the importance of research and policy, and the roles they can play in combating gambling addiction.</p>
<p>MGM Resorts Senior Vice President and Chief Compliance Officer Stephen Martino said that MGM is proud to support the NCPG’s efforts in addressing problem gambling. He also added that the casino operator has a long history of supporting responsible wagering efforts.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Martino stressed that MGM’s team members stand ready to assist guests in understanding the risks of problem gambling and where to get help. He added that the gambling should ultimately remain fun.</p>
