<p>Cyprus-based esports betting solutions provider and distributor Betbazar has signed a content deal with the sportsbook services provider Altenar.</p>
<p>Betbazar Will Provide Altenar With Next-Gen Products</p>
<p>The deal will see Betbazar provide Altenar with betting solutions, developed by its exclusive partner, the fast sports and esports content and data provider BETER. The content deal will cover Altenar’s offerings in Europe and Latin America.</p>
<p>With this agreement in place, Altenar will join the ranks of operators using Betbazar’s solutions, which currently include the sports data and technology companies Genius Sports and Sportradar.</p>
<p>As per the deal, Altenar will receive access to BETER’s esports solutions, the EsportsBattle Football and the Table Tennis Setka Cup Tournaments. According to Betbazar, these products will be implemented on Altenar’s platform in less than a month. Betbazar’s ambition is to “overhaul the services delivered to Altenar with a wealth of next-gen products.”</p>
<p>Betbazar’s chief executive officer, Alex Iaroshenko, elaborated on that, naming this deal as an “incredibly exciting” one. He revealed that everything started with an online correspondence which grew into a strong partnership. Iaroshenko added that working with Altenar also benefits Betbazar as it provides new opportunities for expansion in the Latin American region.</p>
<p>A Strong Partnership in the Making</p>
<p>Betbazar’s chief commercial officer, Max Sevostianov, said that while managing the deal with Altenar, he was left “extremely impressed” by the skill of the latter company’s technical officers. Sevostianov added that launching a product of this scale is a “tremendous achievement” and attests to that Betbazar and Altenar “clearly work well as a team.” Sevostianov is excited to see where this synergy will take the two companies.</p>
<p>Altenar’s chief executive officer, Stanislav Silin, also spoke on the content deal. He explained that Betbazar’s products have helped Altenar increase its current sportsbook coverage and provide its clients with “new fast and engaging content.” In Silin’s words, this very content “challenges the current mainstream providers by offering a degree of disruption, coupled with excellent business sense.”</p>
<p>Silin added that he’s especially happy that Altenar didn’t have to negotiate streaming or data add-ons as everything needed by the recreational player was included in the deal. This included data, odds and visuals with nothing requiring an extra charge.</p>
<p>“Our partnership is based on trust and devoted work from both sides so I’m sure it will continue for a long time,” Silin concluded.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Altenar signed another content deal with an esports betting company, that time with Oddin. The agreement saw Oddin provide Altenar with its high-quality in-play esports odds.</p>
