    <h1>Morongo Casino Resort Spa Cabazon Casino Yaamava Mount Airy Casino Resort Photos Online Casino Free</h1>

<p>I joined Casino Friday via an affiliate link on Casino Ring assuming that they would have only trustworthy casinos on offer.</p>
<p>I joined 25th May after reading their Welcome bonus page which encourages players to know that the bonus is treated as para and the player can do anything they like - in fact the text actively encourages the player to use high stakes or play roulette etc. It also is very clear that any winnings in real cash can be withdrawn any time as long as the deposit turned over x1 and the bonus hasn't been used.</p>
<p>I played a slot (Jammin Jars) on €10 stake and turned my deposit over a few times and decised to cash out after winning a few hundred euros</p>
<p>Later on the same day I receive an email stating that I have abused the bonus in relation to terms :</p>
<p>16.10 You must not engage in any activity which is intended to take unfair advantage of a Bonus. CasinoFriday reserves the right to withdraw the availability of any Promotion and void any wager funded by the Bonus and remove any winnings from such wager at any time and at CasinoFriday’s sole and absolute discretion.</p>
<p>§16.11 If we have reasonable grounds to suspect that a Bonus is being claimed by or for the benefit of the same person more than once or by a group of people acting in concert then it may withdraw the availability of any Bonus or all Bonuses to that customer or group of customers and/or void any wager funded by the Bonus and remove any winnings from such wager.</p>
<p>§11.4 The Casino has zero tolerance to advantage play. Any player who will try to gain advantage of casino welcome offers or other promotions agrees that Company reserves the right to void bonuses and any winnings from such bonuses, for the reasons of:</p>
<p>§11.4.5 any other actions which may damage the Casino.</p>
<p>I believe the terms 16 do not apply as I never used the bonus, I have never made an account with them before and I am a just a regular player.</p>
<p>I believe terms 11.4.5 is unfair because it allows the casino to say they can take any winnings at will at any time, which is unfair without any transparency.</p>
