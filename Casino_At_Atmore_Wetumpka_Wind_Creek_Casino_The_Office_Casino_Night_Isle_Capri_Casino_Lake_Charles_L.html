    <h1>Casino At Atmore Wetumpka Wind Creek Casino The Office Casino Night Isle Capri Casino Lake Charles L</h1>

<p>I found power play casino and was so impressed with it withdrawals were fast ,they're designed is great and customer service is wonderful. So I told my wife about it and she made an account. Both of us played along, not having any problems making deposits until we both tried to withdraw funds. When we tried to do our withdrawals this is the message that we received</p>
<p>12.3.PowerPlay does not allow two or more Account Holders to place bets from one IP-address (from the same computer or the same local area network). In such cases PowerPlay has the right to block the account of such a User and ask them to send the documents verifying their registered identity.</p>
<p>We verified everything and I already made 2 withdrawals.</p>
<p>So they blocked us and froze our accounts.</p>
<p>I received an email after 2 weeks and was able to withdraw my 900.00.</p>
<p>My wife was told they confiscated her winnings for breaking rules.</p>
<p>How can I get my withdrawal but she can't get hers of 1980.00.</p>
<p>She has sent 5 emails asking them to clarify the rules she broke and they can't come up with an answer so they have ignored her. Now tonight she gets this.</p>
<p>PowerPlay reserves the general right at any time, and in our sole discretion, to suspend or terminate your account (or exclude you from any of our services) without further explanation if we consider it necessary to do so.</p>
<p>BUT THEY FORGOT THE LAST SENTENCE THAT IS THE FOLLOWING...</p>
<p>In such circumstances, where deemed appropriate by us, PowerPlay reserves the right to remove any bonus monies in your account.</p>
<p>SHE HAS 25.00 IN SPORTS BONUS AND 10.00 IN SLOTS.</p>
<p>So are they basically saying that somebody has a bad day because they found out their wife was cheating on them, or they don't like the way your name looks, or they got shot down at the bar the night before they can give you the boot and keep your winnings?</p>
<p>If that is the case AVOID POWER PLAY CASINO AT ALL COSTS. She should get her money fair and square it wasn't won on bonus funds.</p>
<p>If they do the right thing and let her withdraw her funds I will update this but it's sneaky especially leaving out the last line in the rule. Ignoring her 4 emails while they dream something up shows their character. It is pointless to get a lawyer but my daughter works for global news and is finishing her internship this would make for a good story. It happens too often and people should be made aware this casino closes accounts because they are 3 and are throwing a temper tantrum.Rules are rules not for one player and not the other.</p>
