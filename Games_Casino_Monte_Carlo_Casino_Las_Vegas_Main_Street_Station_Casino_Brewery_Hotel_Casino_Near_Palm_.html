<p>Casino jackpots always bring excitement, although they are quite hard to hit. The pure thought of securing a big win makes gamblers bet even more but only a lucky few get to take home a hefty jackpot payout.</p>

<p>More Jackpots Bring Big Wins to Lucky Players</p>
<p>Besides the win at the Flamingo, another Caesars’ property made one of its guests rich. Caesars Palace confirmed Tuesday that one of its Caesars Rewards guests hit a $127,228 jackpot. The jackpot dropped while the lucky player was playing slots. But one bet, which was only $25, resulted in the six-digit jackpot that undoubtedly brought excitement for the lucky guest.</p>
<p>Additionally, only recently, another Caesars’ rewards guest secured another big payout in Las Vegas. The LINQ confirmed on April 14, that a lucky visitor identified as Daniel S. secured a $154,916 jackpot while playing Three Card Poker. The venue congratulated the winner on the big prize.</p>
<p>But while six or seven-digit prizes are exciting, jackpots of five figures also make people happy. This is precisely the case of a Las Vegas local resident, that recently secured a $32,541 win on a penny slot, KTNV has announced. The big prize was dropped last week at Rampart Casino and was collected by a local player that has been visiting the casino since 2006.</p>
