<p>The two companies will play a key role in the future marketing communications and campaigns for the National Lottery following the start of the Fourth License in February 2024</p>
<p>The incoming operator of the National Lottery in the UK, Allwyn, confirmed the strategic appointment of two agencies that will support the growth of the lottery in light of the upcoming Fourth License. On Monday, the company confirmed it appointed VCCP and Leo Burnett as joint creative advertising agencies that will support the National Lottery within the first two years of its license which is set to roll out in February next year.</p>
<p>The new collaboration will see VCCP, the leading integrated communications agency, oversee strategic processes related to marketing communications for the Lottery’s Lotto and Set For Life games. Additionally, the company will oversee jackpot-specific campaigns for different draw-based games.</p>
<p>VCCP’s team of experts is led by Hannah Fitz-Gerald, the company’s managing director. The company has a proven track record within the UK with many campaigns, including the recent success of Cadbury and Compare the Market.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Leo Burnett will play a key role in developing different campaigns for the National Lottery brand. The company will seek to oversee and improve the position of different lottery games which is ultimately expected to boost the proceeds to Good Causes.</p>
<p>Leo Burnett’s team is led by its CEO, Charlie Rudd, and also has strategic experience within the market in the UK. In fact, the company is well known for its successful campaign regarding the repositioning of McDonald’s, among other large-scale campaigns.</p>
<p>The Company Is Delighted to Join Forces with VCCP, Leo Burnett</p>
<p>A spokesperson for Allwyn explained that the company is delighted to join forces with the two companies that will be able to play a vital role in the growth of the National Lottery. “The competitiveness of the pitch process demonstrates the appeal The National Lottery holds to many people,” explained the spokesperson. Additionally, they pointed out that Allwyn anticipates seeing the two companies develop “effective, compelling campaigns to further broaden that appeal, making The National Lottery even more relevant to more people in a safe and sustainable way.”</p>
<p>“We’re delighted to appoint these two leading agencies to support our vision for The National Lottery,“ explains a spokesperson for Allwyn</p>
<p>Ultimately, the efforts of the two companies are expected to help the National Lottery under the Fourth License continue to grow in a sustainable way that is both responsible and safe for the consumers. This, in turn, is expected to help the Lottery introduce new games and raise more money for Good Causes, providing much-needed support for different organizations. In light of the recent appointment, Leo Burnett and VCCP are expected to leverage their extensive experience and contribute toward those processes.</p>
