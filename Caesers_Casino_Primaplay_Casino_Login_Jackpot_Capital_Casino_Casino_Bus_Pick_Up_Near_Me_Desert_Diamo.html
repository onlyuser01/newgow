<p>BETCOIN.AG closing my account and keeping my funds</p>
<p>February 26, 2023, 07:13:51 PM</p>
<p>+Merit #1</p>
<p>Betcoin.AG has closed my account without my permission, and it has been over a week since my withdrawal request and I have received nothing.</p>
<p>I loaded 4kusd via crypto and ran it up to over 8k in the sports book, i did their KYC, and since then my account has been inaccessible, when i login it says "user is disabled Launch error 401" - this error pops up even when im trying to do something as simple as making a support ticket</p>
<p>I talked to their live chat on their websit which thankfully worked, and they provided me contact@betcoin.ag to reach "management"</p>
<p>here is the email thread below:</p>
<p>Initial emial:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>My account has been disabled and i am waiting on a pending withdrawal</p>
<p>still and also have an active account balance</p>
<p>this came after i did the verification that my support ticket</p>
<p>provided.</p>
<p>i did everything that was asked except when they said i have to use</p>
<p>the device that i played on i couldnt because i played from a computer</p>
<p>that doesnt have a web camera, desktops dont have that</p>
<p>let me know if i can be of further assistance i would like to play on</p>
<p>your site again and get my withdrawal.</p>
<p>thanks</p>
</blockquote>
<p>reply:</p>
<p>Hello, your new account was suspended, as you asked for a 60 day</p>
<p>exclusion 3 days prior on your original account. We take responsible</p>
<p>gaming very seriously. Please do not create any additional accounts</p>
<p>during the exclusion period. Once the 60 days has passed, we can reopen</p>
<p>the original account, only. We will return the deposit on this account,</p>
<p>as a courtesy. If any other accounts are found, they will have the full</p>
<p>balance withheld, including deposit, per our terms of service. Please</p>
<p>provide a BTC address to return the deposit.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Security</p>
<p>reply from me:</p>
<p>What original account i never had another account with you guys? I never excluded myself i honestly an unaware what youre talking about do you have more details? I would not self exclude. Something very wrong is going on here i want all my funds returned not just the deposit</p>
<p>Please provide further details</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>that's it, since this email i have not been provided any information, i have not been sent ANY money despite already putting a withdrawa request in weeks ago, and they've completely locked me out of my account with over 8k usd in there."</p>
<p>To date, there has been communication from the site OP on bitcoin talk per the aforementioned thread in the link i provided:</p>
<p>on the thread you will see the site has agreed to send me my deposit back and they have, however, they have witheld my winnings and continued to lock me out of my account saying that i've excluded myself prior to playing on there which is untrue.</p>
<p>thanks</p>
