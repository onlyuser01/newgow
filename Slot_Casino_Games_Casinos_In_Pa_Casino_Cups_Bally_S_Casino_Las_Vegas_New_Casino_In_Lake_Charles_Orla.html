<p>Dear Kristina,</p>
<p>I apreciatte the quick reply.</p>
<p>Sorry in advance for any english misspelling.</p>
<p>I will firstly copy-paste something I posted on a forum related to this subject:</p>
<p>"Im not op, but my complaint is similar. I deposited 20 euros 3 days ago. Deposited with debit card, easiest thing ever, super fast.</p>
<p>I made quite a lot of money with those 20 euros, but now withdrawing the winnings is impossible. The website allows me to withdraw the money choosing from 3 methods. Card, crypto or "Perfect Money".</p>
<p>Every card attempt is rejected shortly after, no justification whatsoever. Crypto wallets don't seem to work as well, so I am now trying to use perfect money. I read a complaint about 1win on here referring the perfect money bank, he ended up paying like 120 euros in commission.</p>
<p>Talked to support multiple times, they are useless, if there is actually any support and not some automatic bot responses. Their say on this whole thing was "keep trying, change method". Withdraws take up to 48 hours bla bla bla. Awful support really.</p>
<p>I have submited a complaint already, just leaving this post here so people know what they are getting themselves into.</p>
<p>If i ever get to withdraw my winnings, will come back to this post and give an update on my situation, but doesn't change the shady experience I had with this casino."</p>
<p>I have completed verification and have done no past withdrawals.</p>
<p>At the moment I am actually quite surprised. I requested a withdrawal using perfect money and it hasnt been canceled in over 8 hours, unlike the previous say 15 attempts.</p>
<p>I will wait the 48 hours the so called "support" advised me to wait.</p>
<p>If nothing happens, I will come back to this thread and continue the complaint.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Mainizel</p>
