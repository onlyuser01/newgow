    <h1>Las Vegas And Casino California Hotel Casino Las Vegas Nevada Star Casino Online Palms Casino Buffet</h1>

<p>Dear William,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. I have checked general terms and conditions, and this is what I found https://www.vegasrushcasino.com/bonus-conditions/:</p>
<p>"No Deposit Bonuses (also known as Free Chip|, Processor, Free Spins, Free Roll/Spin, Slot Tournaments) and "No Play No Max" Bonus Rules.</p>
<ul>
<li>Back to back free chip between deposits may limit or void your chance of cashing-out. The Player is entitled to only one free chip in between deposits; any winnings resulting from multiple free chips will be void. For example, if a Player wants to redeem two free chips in a row, players will not be able to withdraw any winnings generated by playing on said chips. The casino reserve the right to make exceptions on the Withdrawals approvals. For further questions please contact Customer Service"</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, if I understood correctly and all your winnings have been accumulated from a Free Chip solely, there would be maximum cash out of $300. Therefore, I have adjusted the disputed amount.</p>
<p>"Unless otherwise stated, the max cash-out for all no-deposit bonuses can’t surpass 1 times the sum value of the bonus redeemed. All free chips valued at or below $100 will have a cash-out limitation of no longer than, nor less than, $100."</p>
<p>Could you please advise if you have redeemed any free promotional offer from this casino previously? Ideally, forward your cashier and bonus histories to petronela.k@casino.guru?</p>
<p>I hope we will be able to help you to resolve this issue as soon as possible. Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
