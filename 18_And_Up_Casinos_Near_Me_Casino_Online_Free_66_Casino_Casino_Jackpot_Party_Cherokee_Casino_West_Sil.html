<p>Secret Symbol Slot Review</p>
<p>With a beautifully executed Ancient Aztec theme in place, progressive jackpots, a wild symbol, 20x multipliers engaged during the free spins feature, and a fearless Mayan warrior queen to lead the way to big wins in the Amazon jungle, Secret Symbol is an interesting Realtime Gaming release from March 2017.</p>
<p>The five-reel game with 25 pay lines can give payouts even as high as $50,000. If you wish to learn more about the theme, symbols, paytable, special bonus features, animations, and gameplay of the game, read what our online slot review experts have to say.</p>
<p>Theme, Storyline, and Graphics: Step into the South American Jungles</p>
<p>While the theme is eye-catching and captivating on its own, it is not a unique one that has never been embraced before by other studios. The Aztec civilization has been a good source of inspiration for many other slot games in the last few years. What sets RTG’s title apart is an excellent choice for graphic elements, starting with the symbols of the Aztec Chiefs and the ancient Pyramids, followed by the images of the snakes, black panthers, parrots, idols, priests, pottery, bracelets, necklaces, pottery, spears, and wooden tubes.</p>
<p>The main storyline is based on the strong Aztec culture, introducing players to a Pre-Columbian Mesoamerican dweller of Central Mexico who used to live there between the 14th and the 16th centuries.</p>
<p>Also named Mexica, a name that helped derive the Republic of Mexico’s name, the inhabitants of the ancient lands will help players gradually discover Montezuma’s legendary treasure. The backdrop features an excellent design showcasing the luxuriant vegetation with beautiful green shades and a gorgeous cascade seen watering the land.</p>
<p>Secret Symbol: Game Symbols and Payouts</p>
<p>Players score their wins by landing five identical symbols on an active line. Five drum or necklace symbols payout 150x while five spear or jar symbols reward players with 200x. Parrots/diadem and venomous snake symbols bring players rewards consisting of 250x. Landing across five identical jaguar symbols triggers a 500x win while five-of-a-kind idols generate a payout of 1,000x. Potion maker symbols are even more valuable, bringing players 2,000x.</p>
<p>The scatter symbol in the game is represented by the Pyramid. Landing five matching scatters brings players a 500x win. The Wild Aztec Chief has been selected as the wild symbol, rewarding players with a massive 10,000x win. The Aztec Chief symbol replaces all the other symbols except for the scatter pyramid symbols and the Secret Symbol Feature.</p>
<p>Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>Players can experience even more of the mystery-packed game through the mood nurtured by the drum beat soundtrack chosen by the studio and the charming whispers of some of the animations. This includes the glowing wisps or the butterflies seen flitting their wings in the jungle.</p>
<p>Secret Symbol Gameplay</p>
<p>The 25 available pay lines are adjustable, which means players need to decide upon a certain number of lines they would like to play prior to getting started. Bets also range from $0.01 to $1, resulting in wagers between $0.25 and $25 on a single spin provided all pay lines are engaged. After players have finished selecting the active number of lines and their bets, they can click or tap the “Spin” button and see the reels spin. They can also opt for the auto-play feature that is also available in the same menu where they can control the volume of the soundtrack or completely mute all sounds.</p>
<p>Additional rules are found in the dedicated vertical Help &amp; Rules tab to the right of the grid. There, players will learn that all wins on different lines are added together. Also, scatter wins are added to line wins and they are also multiplied by the total bet. All line wins are multiplied by the bet per line. The game only pays the highest win on each of the selected lines.</p>
<p>Secret Symbol: Free Games with 20x Prizes, 3+ Scatter Features &amp; Progressive Jackpots</p>
<p>Players looking to come out of the mysterious Aztec jungle richer can aim for the big prize that consists of 10,000x. To grab it, they must keep a close eye on the Aztec Chief symbol which needs to be involved in forming a winning combination on its own with five symbols of a kind.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, even just one Aztec Chief symbol has the potential to generate some nice rewards, when used as a wild feature that can be mixed together with the rest of the standard symbols. In return, this will help them create the winning combinations, as long as all requirements are well met. The same symbols cannot be used as replacements for the scatters represented by the pyramids.</p>
<p>On the other hand, seeing more than three scatter pyramid symbols on the reels will trigger the free spins feature that will reward players with 10 free spins. The Aztec Chief symbol will be used as an expanding wild on reels two and four, with each new free spin featuring its own secret symbol multiplier that ranges between 2x and 20x. The secret symbol multiplier will be applied to all winnings that players may score during the respective spin. The respective feature can be retriggered again while still engaged in the initial free spins.</p>
<p>The game can also randomly pay progressive jackpots at the end of each game. The contribution of the random jackpot cannot go over 1.5% of the total return to player rate established by the studio.</p>
<p>Final Thoughts</p>
<p>Secret Symbol by RTG is an excellent Aztec-themed slot with progressive jackpots paid randomly and a good selection of bonus features that can considerably round up players’ wins. The thrilling gameplay complements the profitable bonuses. While players are given the freedom to select their preferred number of active pay lines, it is best to keep all lines active to land bigger wins with the help of the Aztec Chief wild and the rest of the important symbols incorporated in the nicely designed 5x 3 grid.</p>
