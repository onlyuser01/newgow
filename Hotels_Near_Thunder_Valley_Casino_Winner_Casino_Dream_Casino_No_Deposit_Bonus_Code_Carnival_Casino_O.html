    <h1>Hotels Near Thunder Valley Casino Winner Casino Dream Casino No Deposit Bonus Code Carnival Casino O</h1>

<p>Was previously blocked from withdrawal back in July. I was detected with 2 accounts with 1xbet. I submitted the documents, the issue was resolved in July and was able to procced with withdrawal.</p>
<p>Then I went on to continue to bet with 1xbet with the account. There was no trouble with a lot of deposits, bets and withdrawals.</p>
<p>On 12 sept, my account was blocked from withdrawal. I email the security department and was asked to submit my identification card with selfie to prove my identity, bank statements to prove ownership of bank accounts. I have submitted those documents.</p>
<p>However then, the security department asked me to submit a document, a proof of no gambling addiction.</p>
<p>The document must be verified by medical specialist's signature and stamp of the medical facility.</p>
<p>There is no way to get such a document in my country. you can easily get yes to gambling addiction by just admitting it but there's no way to diagnose no to gambling addiction. and the fact that I was gambling with 1xbet disqualifies me from having 0 gambling addiction.</p>
<p>I have emailed the security and the marketing department to ask for the purpose for this document. I keep getting this reply,</p>
<p>"Dear customer, all consulting on the matter of your request was provided earlier in this mail thread.</p>
<p>Without providing the requested files, any further actions are impossible. All further messages from you will be ignored."</p>
<p>i have sent repeated emails to them seeking for answer to my questions</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>please state me the exact terms/conditions that the casino requires this document, "proof of no gambling addiction", for every customers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>is there any way that i do not require such a document, "proof of no gambling addiction", for me to withdraw?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>what other documents do the casino need from me?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>lets just say, what if a winning customer with money in 1xbet, has mental health problem or gambling addiction. what is 1xbet going to do to the customer according to your terms and conditions?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>they have been avoiding to answer any of these questions and ignoring me. (attached the email)</p>
<p>do i have to adhered to the casino demand and spend money to try to go to a specialist doctor for this cert, "proof of no gambling addiction"?</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>it cost alot of money in my country, $200 or even more. it is not guaranteed to get it in 1 session or even getting it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>it is not guarantee that the casino will stop asking for additional demands that i would have to again spend more money to fulfill.</p>
</li>
</ol>
