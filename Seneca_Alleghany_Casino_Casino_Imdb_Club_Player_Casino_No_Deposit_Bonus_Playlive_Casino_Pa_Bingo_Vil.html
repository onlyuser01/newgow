    <h1>Seneca Alleghany Casino Casino Imdb Club Player Casino No Deposit Bonus Playlive Casino Pa Bingo Vil</h1>

<p>Congratulations, Alexander!</p>
<p>We have read your arguments in this complaint and the screenshots you provided as evidence of our "illegal" activity</p>
<p>As for the legislation, what does it say about what is considered winning and what is done with the amount of deposits during taxation?</p>
<p>The Law of Ukraine "On State Regulation of Activities Regarding the Organization and Conduct of Gambling", Art. 1, clause 1, paragraph 8 - the answer to the question, what is "winning". Please pay attention to the wording - "amounts to be paid". It may be surprising, but there is no question that this is an exclusively "pure" gain Tax Code of Ukraine as amended from 06.30.2023, Art. 170, item 6 - Taxation of winnings and prizes</p>
<p>Here is a screenshot with full information on the taxation of winnings and prizes. In para. 3 of this paragraph is about the size of the tax rate for payouts from the casino. According to Art. 167, item 1 is 18 + 1.5% = 19.5% - here is a screen with the size of the tax rate</p>
<p>As you can see, neither in the PKU nor in the Law "On State Regulation of Activities Regarding the Organization and Conduct of Gambling Games" there is no mention of the fact that interest is deducted from the amount of "net" winnings, but on the contrary, the Law says that winnings are funds, which are payable. That is, literally all funds that are subject to payment. Also, in subsection 4, clause 6, Article 170 of the Tax Code, it is said that when paying the winnings, the player's expenses for obtaining income are not taken into account. They are not excluded from taxation, that is, they are not taken into account, it does not matter how much you lost, it is the money withdrawn when receiving such winnings that is income. If we say that another casino records on its website information about the deposit upon payment, allegedly part of it is the deposit, and the other part is the winnings and the tax from it, then neither these legal regulations nor any others have any language about how the funds that were allegedly "returned" together with a part of the winnings should be taxed, and what's more, such funds come to your account FOR ONE PAYMENT, together, where no one separates them in any way during enrollment. The fact that it is written in the casino account that part for this and part for that means absolutely nothing at the tax level. The bank will not ask you for information about the taxes paid from your personal account - they will ask you for an official certificate with the amount you paid as your income (income is everything that is credited to your card) and will deal with it further. whether you paid taxes on all of your income or evaded some</p>
<p>Now let's analyze the practical situation. You regularly receive money from some organization on your bank card. In fact, your enrollments for the year amounted to 500,000 hryvnias. You made deposits in the amount of 250,000 hryvnias during the same period. That is, according to the interpretation of the legislation by the support specialists of another casino - you must pay tax in the amount of 250,000 hryvnias (net winnings). OK, but you had deposits for the bank in the amount of 500,000 hryvnias. You are blocked from the card with an offer to provide a certificate of income to make sure that all income is legal and has been taxed. You come to the casino for a certificate, they give it to you (in the amount of 250,000 hryvnias). You return to the bank, and the bank tells you - okay, and other income, what is it? And here already begins a long and complicated bureaucratic process with evidence that you should not have paid tax for the return of deposits. The legal side will provide the same arguments, the wording specified in the law - that there is no mention of the fact that only "net" winnings are taxed, and you will only have screenshots of correspondence with chat support specialists of a casino and a screenshot of a news article. approximately the same specialists. I don't think that such a situation will be pleasant and generally win-win for you</p>
<p>Summing up the conclusion under this topic, we would like to note that our position that we act within the framework of legal norms is well-founded and aimed at not creating difficulties for our clients in the future with taxation. If someone does otherwise - it does not make us illegal or violators of the law. You can ask a question in the same casino, but how exactly do they determine that the return of the deposit is a return and according to which legal norms such a "return" is taxed. We tried to do this in order to clarify such a moment for ourselves, but, unfortunately, we did not receive a constructive answer, from which we can also draw our conclusions</p>
<p>If you have any doubts about the taxation of your winnings - please, you can consult a tax lawyer at any time and if the lawyer provides full, legally supported, reasoned information regarding the taxation of such winnings, which is contrary to ours and confirms the taxation format that you describe, we will definitely take it into account and consider your situation individually</p>
<p>We hope you haven't missed any of the moments you mentioned above. If there is anything else we can discuss about this situation - let's discuss)</p>
