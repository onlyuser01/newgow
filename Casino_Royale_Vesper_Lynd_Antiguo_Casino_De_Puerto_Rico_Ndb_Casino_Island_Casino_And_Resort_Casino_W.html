    <h1>Casino Royale Vesper Lynd Antiguo Casino De Puerto Rico Ndb Casino Island Casino And Resort Casino W</h1>

<p>CEO Matt Wilson is looking forward to helping SciPlay build on its considerable momentum</p>
<p>Leading gambling products and services provider Light &amp; Wonder has finalized the acquisition of SciPlay Corporation, a developer and publisher of digital games on mobile and web platforms. Announced earlier this year, the M&amp;A deal was signed in early August.</p>
<p>Under the deal, Light &amp; Wonder acquired the remaining 17% equity interest in SciPlay for the price of $22.95 per share. The money was paid in all-cash transactions, in accordance with the agreement.</p>
<p>Approved by the two companies’ boards, the move has now cemented SciPlay as a subsidiary of Light &amp; Wonder. As a result, SciPlay’s common stock will no longer be available on the Nasdaq Global Select Market.</p>
<p>At the time of the announcement of the final deal, Matt Wilson, Light &amp; Wonder’s president and chief executive officer, said that the move will provide the two companies’ teams with flexibility to make further investments in the development and launch of cross-platform game. As a result, both parties will be able to generate more shareholder value.</p>
<p>Light &amp; Wonder Will Support SciPlay’s Momentum</p>
<p>Wilson also spoke about the finalization of the deal, confirming that the deal will cement Light &amp; Wonder as a more streamlined and financially-strong organization. He praised SciPlay as a consistent performer, praising it for its record-setting results and market performance. Wilson is looking forward to helping SciPlay build on its “considerable momentum.”</p>
<p>As one company, we will drive improved collaboration between our talented teams to build and deploy the most engaging games across our digital and land-based platforms and create a more seamless, best-in-class player experience. Matt Wilson, president &amp; CEO, Light &amp; Wonder</p>
<p>Light &amp; Wonder is a company with a strong corporate culture and values, encouraging teamwork and creativity. Thanks to its OPENGAMING platform, the provider supplies content to multiple operator partners, enhancing their gaming offerings.</p>
<p>Light &amp; Wonder also aggregates content from multiple leading developers. Some of its latest deals saw it expand its long-term partnership with ReelPlay and help Spribe penetrate the American gaming market.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the company presented some of its new products at G2E, unveiling a new slot based on the famous Korean series Squid Game.</p>
