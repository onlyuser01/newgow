<p>Once again, Toronto needed a rally, but once again the Raptors got it. After beating Milwaukee 100-94 Saturday, they earned the franchise’s first trip to the NBA Finals.</p>

<p>After falling 0-2 to start the Eastern Conference finals, Toronto had odds of +650 from DraftKings to win it. They reeled off four straight wins against Milwaukee to do that. In Saturday’s Game 6, they used a 26-3 second-half run to take control of the game.</p>
<p>The Raptors will face Golden State in the Finals and hold home-court advantage in the series. Currently, some oddsmakers have them as a slight favorite over the Warriors for Game 1.</p>
<p>The initial lines Saturday night put the Warriors as a 1-point favorite. However, throughout Sunday morning and afternoon, some of the books transitioned from Golden State being a slight favorite to the Raptors giving a point.</p>
<p>Atlantis, MGM, and FanDuel listed the hosts as the one-point favorite. Caesars, CG Technology, Golden Nugget, SouthPoint, Stations, Treasure Island, Westgate SuperBook, William Hill, and Wyn Resorts listed the game as even.</p>
<p>The game will tip off Thursday night at 9 pm ET. ABC will broadcast the game.</p>
<p>Warriors Favored in Series</p>
<p>While there’s uncertainty about the first game, the books still consider the upstart Raptors a series underdog against a Warriors team seeking their third straight NBA title and fourth in five seasons.</p>
<p>FanDuel lists the Warriors as -350 favorites to win the best-of-seven series, giving the Raptors +220 odds. PointsBet offers the Warriors at -304 and the Raptors at +220. DraftKings, meanwhile, gives the Warriors -315 odds to the Raptors +250. As of Sunday, the SuperBook offers the Warriors at -300, while the Raptors are at +240.</p>
<p>According to Caesars Palace, oddsmakers there expect the Warriors to win in six games, as they offer +250 odds on that series prop bet. The Warriors in five gets +350 odds, while a Golden State sweep and a seven-game victory both get +450.</p>
<p>Caesars offers the Raptors in seven at +550, while a Raptors sweep would garner +2500.</p>
<p>Finals matchup: Raptors vs. Warriors</p>
<p>This year’s NBA Finals appears to be a matchup of offense versus defense. The Warriors enter the finals averaging a playoff-best 117.3 points per game. The Raptors defense, though, has allowed just 99.6 a game. That ranks second behind only the Indiana Pacers, who were eliminated in the first round.</p>
<p>The Raptors are led by Kawhi Leonard, who was traded to Toronto in the offseason from San Antonio. Some say Leonard, who won a ring with the Spurs five years ago, is becoming the league’s best player. His playoff stats seem to make a compelling argument.</p>
<p>In 18 postseason games this year, he’s averaging 31.2 points and 8.8 rebounds a game. In the clincher against Milwaukee, Leonard posted 27 points and a career-high 17 rebounds. That included a key offensive rebound off a missed free throw with 4.5 seconds to secure the Raptors first finals berth.</p>
<p>I just want to win,” Leonard said after Saturday’s win. “I don’t care about being the best player. I want to be the best team. I’ve always said that.”</p>
<p>The Warriors still are missing both DeMarcus Cousins and Kevin Durant, although it’s possible both might return at some point in the series. However, ever since Durant went down with a strained calf late in Game 5 of the Houston series, the Warriors have reeled off five straight wins.</p>
<p>In those five games, all wins, Steph Curry has averaged 35.8 points a game for the Warriors and shot nearly 42 percent from the 3-point arc.</p>
