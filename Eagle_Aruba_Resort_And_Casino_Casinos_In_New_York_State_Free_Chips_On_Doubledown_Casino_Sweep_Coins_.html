<p>Nashville SC is undefeated against Inter Miami in games played at GEODIS Park. However, all of those were played in Miami’s pre-Messi era. Now that the soccer GOAT is one of The Herons, things seem likely to change.</p>
<p>The 2023 Leagues Cup Final odds suggest Inter Miami is going to win, but you should keep in mind that in this tournament, Nashville SC has been a real giant slayer.</p>

<p>“The Boys in Gold” Hoping for Another Upset</p>
<p>So far, Nashville has won three Leagues Cup games in the regular 90 minutes. In two of those, “The Boys in Gold” had plus-money odds, while in the semifinal game against Monterrey, they were seen as +163 underdogs. In the two games, they won after a penalty shootout – vs. FC Cincinnati and Club America – they were also pre-game underdogs.</p>
<p>So, what’s Nashville SC been doing right in the 2023 Leagues Cup? Well, these guys have been defending ferociously, while looking for their chances from counterattacks. The best example is the game with Monterrey in which they had the ball in their possession for only about one-third of the time but still managed to score two goals while keeping their net intact.</p>
<p>With such lethal players as Hany Mukhtar and Sam Surridge, the boys from Tennessee definitely look capable of scoring against Inter Miami. But can they do well enough defensively to stop Messi &amp; Co.?</p>
<p>Lionel Messi’s Inter Miami Looking Unstoppable</p>
<p>Inter Miami is without a single win over Nashville SC at GEODIS Park, but “The Herons” did not have Lionel Messi in any of those games. Now they do, and with the soccer Messiah, they’ve been fantastic. They’ve won five of the six Leagues Cup games in regulation, scoring 21 goals along the way. Their new captain Lionel Messi scored nine of those.</p>

<p>Even the coach of the Philadelphia Union – which they defeated 4-1 in the semifinal – admitted in the post-game conference that Messi’s Inter Miami is practically unbeatable.</p>
<p>But the best thing is that this team isn’t just about Messi. Under the guidance of coach Gerardo “Tata” Martino, many of Messi’s new teammates have started to flourish – Josef Martinez, Robert Taylor, Sergiy Kryvtsov, and others.</p>
<p>Plus, Messi’s and Martino’s former colleagues from Barcelona FC, Jordi Alba and Sergio Busquets, have also started making a big impact on their new team.</p>
<p>Nashville SC vs. Inter Miami Prediction</p>
<p>Inter Miami looks set to win the 2023 Leagues Cup. With Messi on the team, these guys look capable of beating any team in North America, let alone Nashville SC, which isn’t considered one of America’s soccer powerhouses.</p>
<p>Pick: Inter Miami to win</p>
