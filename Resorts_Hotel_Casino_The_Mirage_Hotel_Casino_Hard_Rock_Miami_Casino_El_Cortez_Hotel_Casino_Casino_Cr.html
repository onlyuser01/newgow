<p>The company's new casino is expected to open in 2027 at Business Park Ter Borch considering the selected site is approved for construction</p>
<p>The leading Dutch gambling operator, Holland Casino, announced it has selected land for its new casino location in Groningen. The company confirmed that it identified Business Park Ter Borch near municipality Tynaarlo for its new venue which is expected to open for visitors at some point in 2027.</p>
<p>The location was picked considering its ease of access and construction opportunities. Those two factors are expected to provide the best option for Holland Casino to build its new casino, meet sustainability requirements and deliver thrilling entertainment for its guests. The selected location is strategic, considering the easy access next to the gateway to Groningen for the guests and parking options.</p>
<p>Jurryt Vellinga, Tynaarlo’s municipality spatial planning councilor, spoke about the excellent location Holland Casino selected for their new casino branch. “The location makes sense because of the good accessibility and the space that the business park offers,” he added. Vellinga added that Holland Casino’s choice confirms that the region remains a popular location for businesses. Finally, he predicted that the new casino location would boost tourism and unlock new job opportunities for residents.</p>
<p>“This location offers employment opportunities and is a great boost for tourism in our municipality.“ Jurryt Vellinga, spatial planning councilor with the municipality of Tynaarlo</p>
<p>The Company’s Boss Is Happy with the Selected Site</p>
<p>On the other hand, Holland Casino’s CEO, Petra de Ruiter, added that the company is happy to select a site for its Groningen casino. She added that if the municipality shares the excitement of Holland Casino, the project may soon enter into the planning and construction phase. “I’m looking forward to that and especially to the moment when the new Holland Casino Groningen is open,” explained Ruiter, adding that the opening of the new casino location is good news for the company’s employees and guests alike.</p>
<p>“We are happy that the decision has now been made. If the Tynaarlo municipal council is as enthusiastic as the board of Holland Casino, we can enter the period of planning and construction.“ Petra de Ruiter, CEO of Holland Casino</p>
<p>Back in 2017, the company’s venue on Gedempte Kattendiep in Groningen was destroyed by a fire. Since 2018, Holland has been operating via a temporary casino location. On that point, Ruiter thanked for the cooperation of the Tynaarlo and Groningen municipalities and their support for the company to find a new location.</p>
