<p>The Estonian Government has signed a new directive to help combat and alleviate problem gambling among the country’s population.</p>
<p>Government to Aid in Recovery</p>
<p>Estonian Minister of Social Affairs Tanel Kiik has signed a directive that will secure €200,000 to MTÜ Gambling Addiction Counseling Center – a non-government organization that aims to monitor problem gambling and provide a center to help addicts and their families deal with the problems stemming from the addiction.</p>
<p>The strategic partnership application was launched this October and extends the government’s ability to cooperate with and empower problem-gambling-orientated NGOs in their development, growth and maintenance.</p>
<p>Currently, the center provides free psychological counseling to over 200 problem gamblers and plans on offering debt counseling as well.</p>
<p>Problem Gambling on the Rise</p>
<p>The Estonian Ministry of Social Affairs has recently revealed that around 7% of Estonia’s population is at risk of developing a pathological gambling addiction. The Ministry has stressed that it is paramount to offer comprehensive psychological and financial counseling to affected individuals.</p>
<p>The Ministry is particularly interested in understanding and monitoring the development of gambling addiction in minors. In order to do this, it plans on conducting a long-term study on the matter, accompanied by support program for addicts and their families.</p>
<p>MTÜ Gambling Addiction Counseling Centre Head Pille-Riin Indermitte believes that the global Covid-19 pandemic has helped catalyze the growth of gambling addiction among young people and adults. According to Ms. Indermitte, gambling behavior spiked initially when the pandemic struck as a means of spending time. However, as the addiction deepens it bleeds into the person’s private life, replacing all other interests and interfering with other obligations, the MTÜ head believes.</p>
<p>Ms. Indermitte continued: “On the other hand, the increase in gambling is due to the hope to improve our financial situation when employment opportunities have decreased. We are pleased to pilot a support group service and, for the first time, to carry out a study on the spread of gambling and digital addiction problems among minors in Estonia.”</p>
<p>A Global Problem</p>
<p>Estonia is not the only jurisdiction that has set its eye on problem gambling, nor is it alone in the dramatic increase of gambling addiction. The Covid-19 pandemic has triggered similar developments across the world.</p>
<p>Notable examples include the UK, which has recently halted gambling treatment during a lockdown or the US State of Texas, which is experiencing a surge in gambling addiction. Problem gambling has been a particularly noteworthy problem among athletes as well. In fact, Premier League side Southampton recently launched a mobile app that aims to provide discrete support for addicts and people at risk of developing an addiction.</p>
