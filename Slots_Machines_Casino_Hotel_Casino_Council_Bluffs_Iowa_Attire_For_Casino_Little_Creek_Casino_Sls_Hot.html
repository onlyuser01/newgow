    <h1>Slots Machines Casino Hotel Casino Council Bluffs Iowa Attire For Casino Little Creek Casino Sls Hot</h1>

<p>Things have been going well at one of the leading providers of slot cabinets with Zitro expanding its sales team to meet demand</p>
<p>The company is now adding more members to its experienced sales force in Europe as it faces increased demand for its products across the continent. The team will now feature Andreas Leitinger, appointed as sales manager, and operating out of Slovenia.</p>
<p>Zitro Hires on a Hiring Spree as It Strengthens Sales Team</p>
<p>Leitinger will oversee markets in Germany, Luxembourg, and Slovenia, as well as other jurisdictions that the company may be pushing or expanding into. His industry experience makes him a great fit for the company’s team, which is determined to continue improving its reach in the aforementioned regions and has already been seeing a significant uptick in demand there.</p>
<p>Leitinger is not joining alone as he will also be backed by Krystian Konopka who will also work as sales manager and oversee Poland, Ireland, Sweden, and Egypt. Konopka is also an experienced Zitro employee having worked with the company for several years and distinguished himself as a dependable and successful team member.</p>
<p>The third appointment is that of John Morris, who is a trusted and dependable product specialist, who will now support the international sales team and help with product strategies and positioning. Morris will be tasked with ensuring that Zitro’s products offer a competitive game performance in specific markets as well as help the teams spot and realize new business opportunities.</p>
<p>A Sales Team to Be Proud Of</p>
<p>Zitro EMEA sales director Nadège Teyssedre has welcomed the new changes and appointments and said that she was confident in the success of the growing sales team. “With their experience and expertise, we see tremendous potential for further growth and expansion in the European gaming market,” Teyssedre concluded.</p>
<p>Zitro has been growing its global footprint with a number of important partnerships across various regions, including in Colombia and Brazil. The company opened a new office in Buenos Aires in April to help it with its overall pivot in the Latin American region.</p>
<p>Zitro has similarly been building up in Colombia with VICCA Group which the company joined efforts with just last week. Zitro has continued with its European expansion as well, breaking ground on the Swedish market with Casino Cosmopol.</p>
