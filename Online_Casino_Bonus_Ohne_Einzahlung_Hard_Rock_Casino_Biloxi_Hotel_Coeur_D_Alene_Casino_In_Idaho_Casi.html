    <h1>Online Casino Bonus Ohne Einzahlung Hard Rock Casino Biloxi Hotel Coeur D Alene Casino In Idaho Casi</h1>

<p>Hello good afternoon, explained quickly.</p>
<p>The coolbet casino says that I have made a third party deposit by the bank deposit method, which is false and I have the proof.</p>
<p>Step to detail step by step.</p>
<p>In Peru, for many payments (including payment in various casinos) there is a "payment cash" company in which you can pay in cash at any store, warehouse, pharmacy or market and you also have the option to pay via transfer from your bank. mobile.</p>
<p>It turns out that coolbet in its deposit statements has always called this operation a cash deposit.</p>
<p>Also at the time of deposit they tell you that if you make a cash deposit you keep the receipt.</p>
<p>It turns out that I won a prize of 50 thousand soles, and after verifying my account by various methods they paid me 30 thousand soles.</p>
<p>After this payment of 30 thousand soles, they asked me to prove that a payment made through the "cash payment" method had been from my account.</p>
<p>They stopped calling the method cash deposit and started calling bank deposit.</p>
<p>I made the payment of the "cash payment" method with my girlfriend's account, because all the time in her statements it says that it is a cash deposit but when paying they changed their mind.</p>
<p>They closed my account saying it's fraud and they withheld my 20 thousand soles.</p>
