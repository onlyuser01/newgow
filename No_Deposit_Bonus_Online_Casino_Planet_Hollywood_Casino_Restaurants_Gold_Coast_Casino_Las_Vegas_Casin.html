    <h1>No Deposit Bonus Online Casino Planet Hollywood Casino Restaurants Gold Coast Casino Las Vegas Casin</h1>

<p>They screwed me pretty good recently with trying to cash out and them capping me because they said I was useing bonus money. I deposited 25$ and was given 20 free spins. I was about half way thru my deposit when I used the free spins. The free spins paid me 50 cents or 0.00001600 btc. I deposited 0.0072000 btc. Pretty big gap for a bonus. After the free spins I continued to play for a few hours and even took a little break. When I came back I checked my bonus screen to see if I had received anything. My bonus screen said not useing any bonuses which I thought meant I’m not useing any bonuses that there is no bonus tied to my account at that time. But maybe I just misunderstood what currently not useing any bonuses meant. Seemed pretty cut and dry to me. But they insist that the 50 cents was still somehow being used hours later hundreds of dollars wagered and that there is a max win when useing bonus money. I have been gambling there for the last year n a half and have spent well over a few thousand dollars and have cashed out maybe 400 all together. So they are definitely way up on me. I would have thought the fact that I spend a couple hundred dollars a month there that they would have done the right thing. If I was awarded a bonus of a few dollars then I could understand where there coming from. But I won 50 cents offf of a 25$ deposit. 50 cents. Who in there right mind would say that it’s fair that you get capped on your winnings because we gave you 50 cents for a bonus when you deposited 25$. There was no match bonus no X Amt guaranteed from the 20 spins just whatever ya win if anything that’s what ya get. 50 cents they wanna screw me out of 600$. They did pay me the 315 max cash out that comes with that bonus but won’t answer any of my emails now and are just telling me to go F myself. All the money I’ve pissed away there dosent matter.</p>
