<p>The fast-growing business-to-business (B2B) aggregation platform, REEVO, announced a new deal with the global B2B provider of live lottery, live casino games and retail solutions for gambling operators, Ezugi. Details regarding the new partnership emerged Thursday and see REEVO significantly expand its aggregation platform with content provided by Ezugi.</p>
<p>Per the terms of the new deal, REEVO will benefit from Ezugi's current content which will expand its platform. Besides the existing portfolio of games, the new collaboration encompasses future releases, allowing REEVO to continue to expand its aggregation platform with upcoming games from the popular provider.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the partnership serves a dual purpose as it will help solidify the position of REEVO as a leading aggregator on a global scale. This deal will help the company bring new games to its growing portfolio of partners. On the other hand, the partnership will enable Ezugi's content to reach new audiences around the globe, expanding the reach of its innovative and engaging games.</p>
<p>Pang Goh, Ezugi's Commercial Director, shared his excitement about the new collaboration in a statement saying: "We're thrilled to partner with REEVO and to see our wide-ranging live casino offering go live with them." Finally, Goh noted: "We're sure that players will enjoy access to our specialty live casino tables, such as our localized offering."</p>
<p>Recently, REEVO forged a new deal with the popular iGaming developer Big Time Gaming. Similarly to the most recent collaboration, that deal expanded further REEVO's platform, by delivering titles from Big Time Gaming.</p>
<p>Petra Maria Poola, REEVO's Head of Sales, shared her excitement about the fresh partnership with Ezugi. She said: "We're rapidly onboarding a first-class range of best-in-class suppliers such as Ezugi across all areas of casino." Last but not least, Poola pointed out: "From live games to instants and crash style titles to best-performing slots, we're providing our operator partners with a vast array of high-quality content."</p>
<p>The two latest deals follow the company's ongoing plan for expansion of its portfolio and growth on a global scale. Previously, REEVO announced that it plans to keep expanding its portfolio of partners and add more content to its aggregation platform.</p>
<p>While currently, the company offers games from more than 70 leading iGaming providers, it plans to grow this number with an additional 60 providers by the end of this year. Besides forging deals and expanding its aggregation platform, REEVO grows its proprietary portfolio by introducing new games every month.</p>
