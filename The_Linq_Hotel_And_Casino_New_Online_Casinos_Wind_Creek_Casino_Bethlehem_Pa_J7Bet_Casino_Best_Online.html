    <h1>The Linq Hotel And Casino New Online Casinos Wind Creek Casino Bethlehem Pa J7Bet Casino Best Online</h1>

<p>This seems too odd behaviour of a site I would get booted out of a game that was about to hit a bonus round as I would go back in to get that dang bonus which was usually a large one.</p>
<p>It is them the site booting you out of stuff making it say reload or error etc not a the game provider as they reject you automatically if your not using your own deposit which I knew after multiple tries checking what I had money to play. But they stated that over support chat the removed me from a game but for this instance I was not using the bonus money at the time and it would continuously remove me like how you would not able to play as if you were out of your money from what I was playing as I was going to win big. And the next spin the bonus would activate when I returned to game immediately</p>
<p>I think it was to discourage not to play it anymore even though it was about to drop And it did everytime that happened many times It happened multiple times on a hold and win game I ended up loosing my winnings either way trying to get the bonus wagering cash in time but the fact is it was too messed up to do that. And knowing that they can try alter your play thinking it’s a glitch so they can gaslight you or say it’s the provider software. Sorry this sounds complicated I’m so annoyed I would not like too even know what if any withdrawl process would be like like the same as below is like spincity I don’t expect any of these sites to be accountable but it would be nice especially if they label themselves as a "fair play" casino</p>
