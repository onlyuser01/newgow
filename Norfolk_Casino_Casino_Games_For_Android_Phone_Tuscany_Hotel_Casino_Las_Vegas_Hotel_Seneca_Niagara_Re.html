<p>AC Milan will capitalize on a new gambling partnership with Yabo Sports and tap into its large fan base in places like China and all across Asia.</p>
<p>Yabo Sports to Spearhead AC Milan’s Digital Expansion in Asia</p>
<p>AC Milan has teamed up with Yabo Sports as part of the team’s efforts to continue pivoting towards Asia. The new partnership applies to both the casino and sportsbook branded and operated by Yabo and the agreement will extend throughout the 2020/21 season and two more years after until end of the season in 2023.</p>
<p>The multi-year partnership will allow Yabo to operate as AC Milan’s regional partner in whitelisted markets in Asia. The sportsbook’s goal is to transform itself as a second home for AC Milan fans in the region, who also share interest in sports betting.</p>

<p>AC Milan is interestingly the second most popular soccer team in China in terms of pure following. Yabo Sports’ first order of business will be to find ways and engage more fans and create a “virtual fan village,” offering exclusive opportunities for Chinese fans to feel more involved with the team.</p>
<p>Commenting on the recent developments, Casper Stylsvig, AC Milan’s chief revenue officer had this to say:</p>
<p>“We are delighted to partner with Yabo Sports, who will undoubtedly help us to grow our brand and connect with our millions of Rossoneri fans across the Asian region. Delivering high performance, localized partnerships that focus on shared business objectives is a fundamental aspect of our partnership strategy”</p>
<p>Yabo Sports chief marketing officer David Lee confirmed the platform’s excitement to be part of AC Milan’s efforts to reach more fans in China and Asia leveraging the power of digital innovation.</p>
<p>Lee confirmed that Yabo Sports was committed for the entire period of the deal and it would seek to launch activations and fan contests that would allow AC Milan’s popularity to continue growing in Asia and beyond.</p>
<p>While Italian anti-gambling laws have made it difficult for Italian soccer clubs to secure a partnership with a gambling partner at home, sports organizations have adapted shifting their focus to their largest foreign fan groups.</p>
