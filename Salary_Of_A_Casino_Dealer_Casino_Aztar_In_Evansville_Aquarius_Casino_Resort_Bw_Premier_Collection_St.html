    <h1>Salary Of A Casino Dealer Casino Aztar In Evansville Aquarius Casino Resort Bw Premier Collection St</h1>

<p>you guys wont believe my case with this casino, I was their loyalty customers for couple of years. I was deposited and lose a lot of money and they treat me very well. But then one day when I hit the jackpot and won over 40k Euro then they made me waiting 3 days said they are processing it, then they ask me to submitted Proof of Address which is very ridiculos, because within 2 years playing I have made a lot of cash out without any KYC required because I was fully verify my ID and etc when I open the account and they have approved it already. Now when I won 40k Euro they asked me to provide proof of Address. So I went to my file I sent them an electric bill but turned out I was misclick and sent them the wrong document so I told them to ignore it and let me resend the right documents. They immediately closed my account saying there was fraud on my account and all the winning will be removed ? I was like wtf? is this really a reason to steal my winning like that? I have sent them many email again and again explaining that I sent wrong document and please let me fix the problem but they keep ignoring and saying I was send them a fake document and for that they believe it is fraud and close my account and removed all the winning! What a scamming casino</p>
