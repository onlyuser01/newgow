    <h1>Palm Casino Las Vegas Gran Casino Chumba Casino Download Harrahs Casino Cherokee Nc Casinos In Colum</h1>

<p>Hi.</p>
<p>It is only a difference of 60 euros, but I am simply concerned with the principle.</p>
<p>I deposited 100 euros at Vulkan Vegas about 2 weeks ago. Including a bonus of 100 euros. At Vulkan Vegas you first play with your real money. Here I received free spins at 90 euros and won about 300 euros. I released 200 of them for payment. After that I was able to make a profit again in the further course and was able to release another 100 euros for payment. After that I kept the money in my account because my KYC has not yet been carried out. Now at the end of the evening I had exactly € 600 including the € 100 bonus in my account. I can't get it 100% on the chain like the exact game and credit history was. However, it is certain that I never used the bonus amount. Now I was able to successfully complete the KYC yesterday.</p>
<p>Since my bonus has expired in the meantime, I had EUR 500 real money in my account until yesterday. Now came the mail that my KYC was successful. So my payout in the amount of 200 and 100 have been carried out. After that, however, I only had 140 euros today instead of 200 euros. I have already paid out 140 again. However, 60 euros are still missing here. The Live Chat is of no use because it only works with a translator.</p>
<p>What can I do now?</p>
