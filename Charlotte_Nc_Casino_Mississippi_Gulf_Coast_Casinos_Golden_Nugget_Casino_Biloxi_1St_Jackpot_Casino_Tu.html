<p>Amelco has delivered on its promise to launch its sports betting and platform products in South Africa, with the company debuting in the country through a partnership with LulaBet, a new operator. Amelco is deploying its tier-one solution and provides LulaBet with a full end-to-end sports betting platform that will be entering the market for the first time.</p>
<p>Amelco Makes Its Debut in South Africa with LulaBet</p>
<p>LulaBet will effectively be benefiting from a technological solution that has been leveraged successfully with some of the biggest names in the industry, including Flutter Entertainment, FuboTV, Entain, Hard Rock Digital, and Wynn Interactive.</p>
<p>The launch has been carefully planned between LulaBet and Amelco for the past year and players will now have access iGaming options as well. There will be games from the likes of NetEnt, Red Tiger, BetGames, and others. LulaBet wants to be the premier sports betting and entertainment website and will seek to achieve this through a partnership with Amelco.</p>
<p>Amelco head of business development Brandon Walker welcome the launch and said that it marked an important milestone for the company. He expressed confidence that the company’s entry into the South African market would be a “game-changer.” Walker explained further:</p>
<p>“Amelco has been servicing the industry’s best for 15 years and, having prepared to enter South Africa for 12 months, we have finally found the right partner in LulaBet to bring local players the best of breed. Together, we genuinely believe we can transform this market and we can’t wait to get started.”</p>
<p>Level of Entertainment Never Experienced and Seen</p>
<p>LulaBet managing director Ian Gutteridge has welcomed the opportunity to be launched backed by one of the best suppliers of technological solutions, focusing on the sports betting experience at first.</p>
<p>Gutteridge was confident that the partnership with Amelco will help the company achieve all of its strategic goals in the short and long term and said that consumers should get ready to experience online gaming “like never before.”</p>
<p>Amelco remains a leading provider of sports betting and trading platforms for a number of global gaming behemoths.</p>
