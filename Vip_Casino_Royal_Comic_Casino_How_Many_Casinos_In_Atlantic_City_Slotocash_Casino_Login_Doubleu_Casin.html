    <h1>Vip Casino Royal Comic Casino How Many Casinos In Atlantic City Slotocash Casino Login Doubleu Casin</h1>

<p>Hello, Hygeboy,</p>
<p>I am sorry to hear about your experience. I will contact the casino and try my best to resolve the issue as soon as possible. However, I can see several discrepancies between your claims and the details provided to Petronela, or at least those screenshots/documents do not prove completely everything you claim.</p>
<p>Although you allegedly contacted the casino via live chat regarding your first self-excluded account, on the screenshot of the live chat conversation, there are only a few last messages, where you mentioned your email address stated in your email with the self-exclusion request in 2020, but only in the very last message, while it is not clear what were you talking about with the casino before</p>
<p>You took a screenshot of the casino's message about the impossibility of providing you with the live chat transcript, but although it would have been enough if you had scrolled up in the conversation and made more screenshots, you have or you provided us only with the one with only the last few messages, which does not make sense at all; it could also mean that the casino was not aware of your gambling addiction/self-exclusion, as you claimed</p>
<p>It is a bit strange you did not ask about possible solutions, but you rather referred to the casino's responsible gambling policy and directly requested a refund of your lost deposits</p>
<p>You submitted the complaint with a specific email address, but it is not clear from which account or how you contacted the casino via live chat, and it is not clear which email address was registered with your first self-excluded account; you asked the casino to send you the transcript to a different email address</p>
<p>Now I would like to invite PokerStars Casino's representative to join this conversation and participate in the resolution of this complaint.</p>
<p>Dear PokerStars Casino team,</p>
<p>Could you please provide us with an explanation of the player's situation in more detail? How it was? How was the player able to register with a new account at the casino despite being permanently self-excluded?</p>
<p>If we are talking about a breach of the casino's Terms and Conditions, is the casino able to substantiate its claims and decision with relevant evidence? Should the player expect a refund of his deposit(s)?</p>
<p>Can you share with me the complete live chat conversation with the player? (Please, see the last messages from the live chat session in the screenshot above posted by my colleague Petronela)</p>
<p>It is possible to share the data directly here, with your reply, or by sending them to my email address (branislav.b@casino.guru).</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for providing the information.</p>
