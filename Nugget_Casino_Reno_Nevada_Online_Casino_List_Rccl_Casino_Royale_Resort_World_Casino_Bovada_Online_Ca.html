Podcasts, live video, and more exclusive content are also planned for sports fans in Colorado.</p>
<p>In a statement, Walker Monfort, Rockies’ Vice President of Corporate Partnerships shared his excitement of the recent deal. He wrote: “All of us at the Colorado Rockies are thrilled to take this exciting next step in our longstanding relationship with DraftKings.“</p>
<p>Monfort outlined that the expansion of the deal with DraftKings will only add up to the relationship which they built so far. In conclusion, he outlined that the tie-up with an industry leader such as DraftKings in the growing Colorado sports betting market will undoubtedly prove to be beneficial for both sides.</p>
<p>DraftKings’ Retail Sports Betting Venue at Mardi Gras Casino Opens Today</p>
<p>Today DraftKings officially opened its newest retail sports betting venue at Mardi Gras Casino and Resort in Black Hawk, Colorado. The retail, located within the resort is going to provide sports fans with supreme viewing and hospitality experience. The retail features more than 40 TVs as well as large video boards dedicated to displaying odds. Furthermore, DraftKings’ new venue offers self-serving betting kiosks, a full-service American sports bar, and a restaurant. According to the company’s statement, the entire venue is “designed with the modern fan in mind“.</p>
<p>Matt Kalish, Co-Founder and President of DraftKings North America said that the company is proud to grow its presence in Colorado. He added: “In the short span since launching our top-rated mobile sportsbook app in Colorado this past May, Coloradans have proven to be among our most engaged customers, which makes our deepened connection to the state through these collaborations all the more exciting.“</p>
<p>Back in July, DraftKings opened a temporary facility in the Mardi Gras Casino. But with the recent news, now the venue has a permanent spot within the resort. The Mardi Gras Casino in Black Hawk is owned by Twin River Worldwide Holdings. According to George Papanier, President and Chief Executive Officer of Twin River Worldwide Holdings, the new retail sports betting location by DraftKings is “the perfect addition”. “There is nothing like it in Black Hawk and we are excited to become Colorado’s new home for all sports,” added Papanier.</p>
