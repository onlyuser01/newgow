<p>GSW win two games against the Raptors</p>
<p>Harden still recovering from eye poke</p>
<p>Raptors need to win Game 3 or their fate will be sealed</p>
<p>After two intense games, the Golden State Warriors have claimed a two-game advantage over their rivals from the Houston Rockets. The third game is starting in less than 24 hours and the rivalry between these two teams can be felt. Played on the Oracle Arena, Oakland, California, the Rockets now have a tough challenge ahead of them.</p>
<p>Game 3: 2019 NBA Playoffs: Warriors vs Rockets</p>
<p>The semifinals between Golden State Warriors and the Rockets have been an intense affair. In Game 1, James Harden was close to catching up to the GSW in a split-second offensive which ended up with James Harden missing a shot and falling down, crying foul. Unimpressed NBA officials let the GSW counter-attack and seal the game.</p>
<p>Game 2 consolidated the Warriors lead with the game finishing 115-109 and Harden suffering a trauma to his eyes, leaving the game with eyes red and bleeding. It seems that Harden has had a bit of a tough spell. Some have said argued that Stephen Curry has been allowed too much contact in the first game.</p>
<p>Harden got injured during a fight for a loose rebound against Draymond Green, but returned to the game nevertheless, although his vision was clearly impacted. His vision is still impacted.</p>
<p>Regardless of the bad turns of events, the GSW played an exceptional game. The Hampton Five line-up did a really good job and there is no indication that the players would relent in Game 3. Andre Iguodala continued to pull of one successful shot after another.</p>
<p>Bar Draymond’s incident with Harden, the player reminded of his form back in 2016-17. Conversely, Stephen Curry’s performance was a little subpar in Game 2</p>

<p>The rockets didn’t play half bad themselves. They fielded Chris Paul and Clint Capela who continuously shot well time and again. The slight 6-point advantage that marked the end of the game could have been overcome.</p>
<p>Analysts have said that Game 2 has truly revealed the Warriors’ depth, but let’s face it – the Rockets are dealing with far too many issues on per game basis to give GSW all the credit. It’s true that Curry himself has been complaining of a leg injury, but his team hasn’t been incapacitated across the board.</p>
<p>One thing the Raptors can consider to tilt the scales in their favor is to make a more pronounced use of their bench. Austin Rivers was given a chance, though, and he didn’t do half bad. The Raptors are still behind the GSW and to even have a chance to turn this around, they will have to play with depth and determination that the Warriors don’t expect.</p>
