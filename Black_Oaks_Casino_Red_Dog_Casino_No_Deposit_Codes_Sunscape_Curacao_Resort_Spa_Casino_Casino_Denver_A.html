    <h1>Black Oaks Casino Red Dog Casino No Deposit Codes Sunscape Curacao Resort Spa Casino Casino Denver A</h1>

<p>For those of you who have got accustomed to European and North American golf terrains, there is a big change of scenery coming this Wednesday, October 20. The ZOZO Championship is playing out of Inzai, Japan and it will feature a number of strong contenders as per DraftKings’ latest odds.</p>
<p>Xander Schauffele is naturally in the lead of a pack of 78 players who are all eager to secure the 2021 ZOZO Championship title. There are others, and not least Collin Morikawa who is posted second in the overall fixtures, and for a good reason.</p>
<p>Morikawa finished second in the CJ Cup and he will be facing many talented golfers, the top 60 FedEx players based on last season’s rankings, in fact. Hideki Matsuyama seems to be fourth in the overall placement for this event with (+1600) and he is a golfer you should be on the lookout for. Let’s take a look.</p>
<p>Odds to Win 2021 ZOZO Championship</p>
<p>Golfer Odds Xander Schauffele +600 Collin Morikawa +750 Paul Casey +1400 Hideki Matsuyama +1600 Will Zalatoris +1800 Tommy Fleetwood +2200 Rickie Fowler +2500 Joaquin Niemann +2800 Jhonattan Vegas +2800 Cameron Tringale +2800 Odds as per DraftKings on October 20.</p>
<p>There are two clear leaders in the odds so far with Collin Morikawa and Xander Schauffele posted at (+600) and (+750). The rest of the pack is posted at long odds, which in golf means a great added value if you get the right pick.</p>

<p>Predictions for 2021 ZOZO Championship</p>
<p>The upcoming ZOZO Championship will immediately tempt you to back up the likes of Schauffele and Morikawa and we understand that. With both golfers performing outstandingly well in the past several tournaments, there is a very good chance they will once again make a top finish, even if they miss the first place by a sliver.</p>
<p>Looking further down the fixtures, and outside, the top 10 golfers listed to win, we have many excellent choices. Perhaps best of them all is C.T. Pan who is listed at (+4500) and who did well in both the Fortinet Championship and Sanderson Farms Championship finishing T-6 and T-11 respectively.</p>
<p>Then we have AT&amp;T Byron Nelson’s champion K.H. Lee who has been able to stick with the first 20-or-so golfers in virtually every event he has participated. At long odds of (+5000), you can see why he adds tremendous value here.</p>
<p>However, since we want to make sure we balance between risk and return, we would say go with C.T. Pan to finish in the top 10 for the ZOZO Championship. You may even have a small wager on him winning because of the high return rate.</p>
<p>However, Morikawa is another is quite strong in terms of strokes gained and we do believe he can even surpass the leader in the current odds standings.</p>
