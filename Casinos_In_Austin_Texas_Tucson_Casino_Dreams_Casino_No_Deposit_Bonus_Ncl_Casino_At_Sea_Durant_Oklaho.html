<p>Kaizen Gaming, the iGaming subsidiary of OPAP (Greek Organization of Football Prognostics) S.A, has taken in the knowledgeable Pablo Puertas as its new group marketing director. Puertas’ industry experience will help drive the iGaming company’s business forward.</p>
<p>Kaizen Appoints Pablo Puertas as Marketing Director</p>
<p>The newly appointed marketing director will bring expertise to the Kaizen Gaming team. His good understanding of marketing, supported by his field experience will be a valuable asset for Kaizen Gaming’s future operations.</p>
<p>Before joining the OPAP subsidiary, Puertas has worked for the online and betting company William Hill. During his time there, he worked as a head of digital marketing for international brands and as a digital marketing manager for Spain.</p>
<p>In Kaizen Gaming, Puertas will join the company’s new marketing leadership team. There, he will work under the company’s chief marketing officer, Panos Konstantopoulos, who is responsible for Kaizen’s betting brands: Stoiximan for Greece and Cyprus and Betano for international iGaming.</p>
<p>Puertas’ responsibilities as a marketing director will be overseeing team management and strategic planning. His work will cover all of the markets where Kaizen Gaming’s brands are operational.</p>
<p>Puertas Will Have an Important Role in The Company’s Expansion</p>
<p>The leader of the marketing leadership team, Konstantopoulos welcomed the new marketing director. He spoke that he is glad to have Puertas on board as Kaizen Gaming’s strong international growth demands capable human resources with actual experience and knowledge of the global iGaming market.</p>
<p>As one with “solid international exposure”, Puertas is a perfect fit for the company. Konstantopoulos believes that Puertas will bring the experience and skills needed for Kaizen to reinforce its brands throughout all of the regions it operates in.</p>
<p>Kaizen Gaming has recently been focused on distinguishing and affirming itself on its markets. The Greek betting company is one of the fastest-growing betting-oriented companies in all of Europe. It currently has access to its local Greek market plus Cyprus where it operates under the brand Stoiximan, as well as Brazil, Chile, Germany, Portugal, and Romania where it’s available as Betano.</p>
<p>The Betano brand in particular has been driving strong growth globally. Thanks to its reputation, it was chosen by Scout Gaming as a partner for the latter company’s LATAM expansion. Betano itself has also been working hard to establish a visible presence on the South American market. A little over a week ago Betano inked a sponsorship agreement with the Chilean football team Deportes La Serena. Back in June, the Greek iGaming operator reinforced its standings in Brazil through a second football partnership by striking a deal with Fluminense FC.</p>
