<p>The Matt Stafford Era Begins in LA</p>
<p>Over the last couple of seasons, Jared Goff was seen as the Rams’ weakest link. The management decided to act in 2021, trading Goff to the Detroit Lions in exchange for Matthew Stafford. Now a 33-year-old, Stafford is considered one of the best passers in the history of the NFL.</p>
<p>His first game as the starting quarterback for the Rams is the one in Week 1 against the Chicago Bears. The guy already has an impressive record against this team. As the Lions’ signal-caller, Stafford went 11-9 against Chicago, with a 63.6% passing completion for 5,440 yards and 32 touchdowns.</p>
<p>Impressive stats on their own, but what’s even more impressive is that Stafford didn’t have too much of support in those games. The thing is that the Lions’ offense is not among the league’s elite. However, the Rams’ offense probably is.</p>
<p>Still, their strongest weapon is their defense, where they got such superstars as Aaron Donald and Jalen Ramsey. Both of them are among the top candidates for the Defensive Player of the Year Award in 2021. In fact, Donald is the main favorite at +450.</p>
<p>Andy Dalton to the Rescue?</p>
<p>It looks like the Bears offense is going to have serious problems in Week 1. Not only are they facing one of the NFL’s best defenses, but their offensive players also don’t seem very good. Last season, they scored only 372 points in 16 regular-season games.</p>
<p>The reason behind this is that the Bears haven’t had an elite-class quarterback for ages. In fact, this team is without an All-Pro QB since 1950!</p>
<p>The man whom they’re hoping can become their savior is Andy Dalton, who arrived from the Dallas Cowboys in the offseason. His job is to replace Mitchell Trubisky who’s gone to the Buffalo Bills.</p>
<p>Dalton surely has a good pedigree, having played Pro Bowl on three occasions. Unfortunately, the most recent of those happened five years ago.</p>
<p>Further, he’s coming off a not-too-impressive season with the Cowboys, which saw him taking over the starting quarterback role after Dak Prescott got injured in Week 5. In the 12 games he played last year, Dalton went 265-for-420 for 2,808 yards and 14 passing TDs.</p>
