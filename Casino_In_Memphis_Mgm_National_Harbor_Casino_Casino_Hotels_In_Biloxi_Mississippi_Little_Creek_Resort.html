<p>The best B2B and B2C companies in North America secured prestigious EGR awards across various categories</p>
<p>EGR has just announced the winners of its 2023 EGR North America Awards, an annual initiative that celebrates excellence in the NA iGaming sector. This year’s format saw EGR award Gold, Silver and Bronze awards to the top three companies across its headline categories.</p>
<p>Headline Categories</p>
<p>The sports betting specialist Sportradar was awarded Gold recognition in the Acquisition and retention partner category. It is not hard to see why, considering all of the company’s recent activity and robust expansion strategy. Next up in this category is Optimove, followed by Betting Hero in third place.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, NeoGames secured the Gold award in the Best new game category. The developer has been developing a variety of new titles, always keeping its customers engaged with new content. It won the award thanks to its Desert Fantasy release. NeoGames was followed by Evolution, which secured the Silver award thanks to its Live Caps slot and Greentube which grabbed the Bronze thanks to its Thunder Cash: Voodoo Magic title.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Best product innovation Gold award went to PointsBet. OneComply was able to grab the Silver, with Kambi getting the Bronze.</p>
<p>White Hat Studios was crowned as the US Rising star, followed by Odds on Compliance, which took the Silver award. Finally, Betr took the Bronze recognition in this category.</p>
<p>Affiliate Category</p>
<p>This category saw EGR elect but a single winner, which is Better Collective, a leading developer of educational platforms within iGaming. The group, which has been in business for almost two decades, continues with its mission to make sports entertainment more fun and engaging for the end customers.</p>
<p>General Categories</p>
<p>In addition to some of the Headline categories, EGR’s General Categories include the Diversity &amp; inclusion model award and the Employer of the year award. For reference, the former of these went to the geolocation specialist GeoComply, while the latter was grabbed by Betting Hero.</p>
