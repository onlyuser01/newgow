<p>Smarkets begins strong U.S. Push with Full House Resorts Deal</p>
<p>The SBK online sportsbook to launch in Indiana and expand to Colorado</p>
<p>Vote in Colorado’s November referendum needed</p>
<p>Smarkets, an innovative provider of gaming and sports betting solutions, have struck a deal with Colorado and Indiana’s Full House Resorts. As a result, Smarkets will launch the SBK online sportsbook in Indiana and follow through in Colorado once legislation clears mobile betting in the state.`</p>
<p>Smarkets Sports Betting Solution Hits the U.S. Market</p>
<p>Smarkets has just inked a sports betting deal with Full House Resorts allowing the company to introduce sports betting options on the premises of the operator across two states. As per official information, the pair have agreed to a multimillion-dollar arrangement that is signed for an unspecified long-term period.</p>
<p>While financial data wasn’t disclosed, the official statement explained that the companies had invested a substantial chunk of money. As a result, Smarkets will now launch its SBK online sportsbook in Indiana, one of the latest states in the U.S. to legalize wagering on the outcome of athletic competitions.</p>
<p>Today we're extremely happy to announce our first partnership to take the Smarkets platform to the USA.</p>
<p>First, we will launch with our new sportsbook @SBK_app. Get ready, America! https://t.co/RduWHdp4QU — Smarkets (@smarkets) September 4, 2019</p>
<p>In the meantime, Smartkets will be focusing on another state – Colorado – which may also see its sports betting industry legalized before 2019. Colorado residents will go to the ballot boxes in November and decide with a referendum vote whether sportsbooks can launch.</p>
<p>Smarkets’ sportsbook is exclusively designed for mobile and it’s accessible from Android and iOS handheld devices. According to Jason Trost, CEO &amp; Founder at Smarkets, the deal marks an important achievement for the company.</p>
<p>This is a landmark day for the company. As an American myself, I’m thrilled to bring our world-leading technology to Indiana and Colorado, as well as more states across the country.</p>
<p>Mr. Trost expressed hopes that his company can compete against much of the established sports betting agencies out there, owing to ‘superior technology’ as well as ‘ focus on providing the best prices.’</p>
<p>Smarkets’ U.S. Push to Continue</p>
<p>Smarkets is not an entirely new player in sports betting. The company has run out of London, the United Kingdom, for 11 years now and it has offices in Malta and Los Angeles, the U.S. However, this is the first time the company has tried to actively enter the market. The arrival of the company is not exactly unexpected, as Mr. Trost spoke to Bloomberg in February 2018, outlining the future action plan of the company.</p>
<p>The SBK betting solution is just the first in a line of many to come, Smarkets has specified. Similarly, the company is hoping to push ahead with a first-of-its-kind gambling exchange and offer more mobile gaming solutions in North America.</p>
<p>The gambling exchange Smarkets already operates is said to have a total handle of $15.6 billion, putting it in a unique position to completely change how we think of gaming in the first place.</p>
<p>Full House Resorts SVP and Chief Development Officer Alex Stolyar also welcomed the news on a positive note:</p>
<p>‘This is a very exciting time for sports betting in Indiana and Colorado, and we are delighted to partner with Smarkets.’</p>
<p>Mr. Stolyar expressed his high hopes for the innovative platform that Smarkets have built, citing the SBK sportsbook platform, and said that it would ultimately ‘heighten the customer experience’</p>
