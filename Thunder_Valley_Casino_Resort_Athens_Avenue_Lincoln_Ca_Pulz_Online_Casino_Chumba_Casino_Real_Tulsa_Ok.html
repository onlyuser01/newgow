    <h1>Thunder Valley Casino Resort Athens Avenue Lincoln Ca Pulz Online Casino Chumba Casino Real Tulsa Ok</h1>

<p>I am currently in a rehab facility so we only get our phones every other day for an hour on tuesdays and Thursdays. And 4 hrs on Saturdays and sundays. And this was on a Saturday.</p>
<p>Like most of my deposits I did not redeem a bonus on this $50 deposit which was the last of my available $ on my cashapp. Well shortly after playing I end up having something come up that puts me in the need of $35 and my balance is at $84 at this point so I figure I will withdraw the $35 and will leave me with the $50 I started with. I start the withdraw progress of $35 through bitcoin using my cashapp so will have the money available to use asap. It gets approved through the 1st 2 steps and an email is sent out for me to confirm everything. I respond to the email confirming the withdraw and wait hoping the withdraw will happen in time for me to have access to the $35 in time for me to use before have to turn my phone in. The funds don't hit my cashapp in time and have my girlfriend just send $35 to a person for me so don't have to wait for the withdraw. Not waiting on the 35 anymore I start playing the remaining $49 and lose it shortly before turning our phones in for the night. So the next day I log into my profile and go to see about depositing the $35 and come to find out the withdraw was denied by casino telling me to withdraw full amount of balance and that the 35 had been refunded. Which was bs. At no time while playing the remaining $49 the day before did my balance go up $35 from refund.</p>
<p>I have asked that they show me when they had refunded the money and they say I can see a history of the games I played in account history, and claim they refunded the money but they never did.</p>
<p>Besides what casino denies someone withdrawing a portion of their money and telling them to withdraw it all. Casinos want you to play as much money as possible.</p>
