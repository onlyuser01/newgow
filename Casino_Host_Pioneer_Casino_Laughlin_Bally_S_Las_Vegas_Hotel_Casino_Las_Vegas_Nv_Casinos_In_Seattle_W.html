<p>One of the alleged victims of the famous actor from “Dances with Wolves,” Nathan Chasing Horse, recently spoke out, accusing him of sexual assault and sharing her heartbreaking story. Corena Chasing Horse, now known as Corena Leone, is one of the two alleged victims of the famous actor.</p>
<p>Nathan Chasing Horse was arrested on January 31, 2023, after authorities executed a search warrant at his home in North Las Vegas where he resided with his wives. After he was taken into custody, in mid-February, the actor was indicted in Clark County by a grand jury for a total of 19 counts.</p>
<p>The indictment included 10 counts of sexual assault against a minor under the age of 16. Additionally, Chasing Horse was charged with first-degree kidnapping of a minor, as well as six counts of sexual assault with open and gross lewdness and controlled substance trafficking.</p>
<p>Last week, the drug charge against the actor was dropped, but the other 18 counts remained in place. Chasing Horse remains in custody at the Clark County Detention Center located in downtown Las Vegas, while his bail is set at $300,000.</p>
<p>A Sexual Predator</p>
<p>In a recent interview for KLAS, Leone, one of the alleged victims of Chasing Horse spoke about the physical and mental abuse, as well as the sexual assaults she endured. Although the first sexual assault happened back when she was 14 and she is now 25, Leone said she wanted to speak out and encourage others to also share if they were victims of Chasing Horse. “I just want to encourage them to not be afraid because this is bigger and this is more than just what happened to us and that this could be helping other little girls,” said Leone during her recent interview.</p>
<p>Leone claimed that her first encounter with Chasing Horse happened back when she was 14. At the time, she claimed, he took her to a closet and asked her to take off her dress. Then, after Chasing Horse allegedly raped her, Leone was given a birth control pill by him.</p>
<p>The victim claimed that Chasing Horse had other sexual encounters with her when she was 16. This is when he reportedly also asked the young girl to become his wife, Leone claimed. Given that her mother was allegedly part of Chasing Horse’s cult popular as “The Circle,” she deemed that request as an honor at the time.</p>
<p>At the age of 18, Leone moved in with Chasing Horse and the sexual assaults exacerbated. Additionally, she claimed she was physically and mentally abused and the actor even made her have sex with other men while blindfolded. After escaping from Chasing Horse in 2021, Leone shared her allegations on social media in 2022.</p>
