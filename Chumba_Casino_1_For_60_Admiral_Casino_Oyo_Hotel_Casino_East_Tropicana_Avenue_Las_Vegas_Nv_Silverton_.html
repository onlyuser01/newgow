    <h1>Chumba Casino 1 For 60 Admiral Casino Oyo Hotel Casino East Tropicana Avenue Las Vegas Nv Silverton</h1>

<p>Dear bperk9642,</p>
<p>After gathering all the necessary information and details, we are closing this complaint as unjustified due to breaching the casino's terms and conditions in several ways - multiple accounts use (at least 3 other linked accounts) and bonus abuse.</p>
<p>The provided evidence supports the casino representative's claims above. There is more than one casino account registered and used by one person, while no-deposit bonuses were already used on the accounts registered earlier, which means the casino's rules were seriously breached, and you were not allowed to use a no-deposit bonus on your disputed account. In addition, on the linked accounts, the no-deposit bonuses were previously used consecutively without making deposits between them, which means another rule was breached. As for one of your claims that the casino CS representative could have checked for it and closed other accounts - they are not obliged to check your activity and perform KYC earlier than upon a withdrawal or a withdrawal of a higher amount. It depends on a particular casino. Anyway, you were not allowed to create a new account.</p>
<p>We are talking about no-deposit bonuses, free money given by the casino, and online casinos can limit them by rules as they see fit unless it is not against our Fair Gambling Codex. Each player is obliged to read the terms and conditions, and you accepted them upon registration. It makes sense that casinos do not offer free money without limitations, and do not let their players only win and withdraw the winnings.</p>
<p>You are not entitled to the winnings obtained in this way. Your initial deposit was reimbursed, and you lost it. The casino acted correctly and in accordance with its terms and conditions (HERE), and we accept its decision.</p>
<p>I am sorry we were not able to help you with this one, but please, do not hesitate to contact us in the future, if you run into any issues with this or any other casino. We are here to help.</p>
<p>In case of any questions, feel free to write to me at branislav.b@casino.guru.</p>
<p>Thank you very much, Lucky Legends Casino Team, for providing information and for your cooperation.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Branislav, Casino.Guru</p>
