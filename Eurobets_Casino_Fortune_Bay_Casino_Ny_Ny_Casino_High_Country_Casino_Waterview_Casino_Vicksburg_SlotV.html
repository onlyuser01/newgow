    <h1>Eurobets Casino Fortune Bay Casino Ny Ny Casino High Country Casino Waterview Casino Vicksburg SlotV</h1>

<p>My name is Omer , im 32 years old from Israel.</p>
<p>at Augost 2020, during the high corona lockdowns, i was surfing the internet and search for an online casino to play, something that i never did, and happened due to an mentally attack i suffer.</p>
<p>I tried to enter several casinos, and all of them were forbidden to players from Israel, and they certainley knew im from Israel because of my IP Adress.</p>
<p>Than i entered a site name cslotv.com, which was the only site i can join without any problems.</p>
<p>I will first to to acknowledge that since other sites didnt allow players from Israel to join - at this site i choose Bulgaria is my native country. However, my IP Address was clearly shows that im from Israel.</p>
<p>After i joined the site, i despoited money without any problem with my credit card.</p>
<p>I would like to notify that Im mentally ill, suffering from a syndrome called OCD, and im being treated with medications and visiting Psychiatrist each 3 months.</p>
<p>During that time i was under my mentall syndrome attack, under pills treatment. i didnt really understood what im doing and i was probably unaware of this.</p>
<p>After few days and after i earn some money, i decided to stop, since the fact i can risk my hard-working money which im using for Food and Basic things.</p>
<p>Than, the same day i stop playing, a girl from abroad has phoned me. she presented herself as cslotv employee, and manipulated me to return playing in their site.</p>
<p>My phone number ared code is +972 which shows clearly that im from Israel.</p>
<p>After she pushed me to keep play, i was very mentally weak and i returned again to the casino.</p>
<p>Again, all this time no one has prevented me to play despite the fact im from Israel. a thing the casino has obviously knew.</p>
<p>Anyway, i lost all my money - over 30,000$ in few weeks. i wasnt very aware of this since i was under medicinal treatment.</p>
<p>The thing im going to say now is this: the site should have PREVENT me from playing because a critical reason: online gambling is ILLEGAL in Israel!</p>
<p>Thats the reason all the site prevented me to play and didnt even let me join as a member!</p>
<p>The site has manipulated me and phoned me dozens of times pushing me to play, while they knowing they shouldnt do so because it is forbbiden to join from Israel</p>
<p>Now i lost all my money, i have been since than in miseriable, and huge debts and loans. i even considered suicide.</p>
<p>The site shouldve NOT allowing me to play while knowing it is prohibited! they did everything to push me into playing and invest more and more money, each despot 2,000$, and i reached more than 30,000$ losts without anyone limiting me.</p>
<p>All this happens while im under medicinal treatment, which i can provide all the necessary documents to prove this!</p>
<p>Now, after my mental situation has become stable, i realized i lost all my money to a casino which pressure me to play and lose all my saving while the staff knew im from Israel and it is forbbien and illegal!</p>
<p>Ive checked the law in Israel several times and all the Israeli Supreme Court verdicts on this issue says clearly that online gaming from Israel is absolutely prohibited.</p>
<p>Now, i left with huge debts, mentally ill and unaware of every that happen.</p>
<p>If i would knew in the first place that it is illegal than i wouldnt do so. the casino should have told me about this and prevent me from losing all my money.</p>
<p>Now, over one year since all this happen, i decided that im sending this official complaint to you.</p>
<p>I want all my money back, up to the last cent!</p>
<p>I lost over 30,000$ because of cslotv behaviour and misconduct that made to me while im on mental disorder!</p>
<p>Im not going to give up. if i will be asked - i will provide all the necessary documents to prove my case. i can also give my lawyer phone number for legal inquiries about this issue.</p>
<p>Im sending you this mail in hope that you will do everything you can in order to make cslotv take responsibility of their misconduct.</p>
<p>As a casino licenser you must acknowledge that casino under your supervision must act according to the laws within each country.</p>
<p>As a regulator you have responsibility to prevent other cases like i had.</p>
<p>Now, i asking you to do everything you can do in order to get my money back. i wont rest until i will receive all my hard-working money that taken from me illegally.</p>
<p>I can show you all the Supreme Court verdict on this issue that shows clearly that the law in israel prohibiting online gambling.</p>
<p>I expecting you to do all the necessary action against cslotv casino.</p>
<p>Please do what you can to get my money back. im sure you have the tools to act against cslotv.</p>
<p>Regards, Omer.</p>
