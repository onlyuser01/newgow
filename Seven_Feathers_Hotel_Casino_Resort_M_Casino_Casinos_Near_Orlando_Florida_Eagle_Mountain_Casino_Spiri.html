    <h1>Seven Feathers Hotel Casino Resort M Casino Casinos Near Orlando Florida Eagle Mountain Casino Spiri</h1>

<p>Spinomenal has launched its content with a leading operator in the Italian market, StarCasino, making a foray into the country. This collaboration is facilitated through an integration through the Light &amp; Wonder OpenGaming platform which facilitates the onboarding of new games and ensures their smooth arrival at new operators.</p>
<p>Spinomenal’s games are now available at the Betsson Group brand and they are designated as exclusive products and will remain such through October. This means that StarCasino will be amongst the first players to try the company’s content for the very first time and have the chance to experience player-favorite titles such as Majestic King, Demi Gods II, Poseidon Rising, and more over the coming weeks and months.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Spinomenal is also rolling out with its Spinomenal Universe concept which brings even stronger gamification opportunities for players at StarCasino and will soon be available to other operators as well.</p>
<p>StarCasino Managing Director Stefano Tino has welcomed the opportunity to integrate Spinomenal’s established library of games with the operator and introduce Italian players to unique content that is sourced from a leading tier-one supplier.</p>
<p>"Our aim is to enrich our offerings, enhance customer loyalty, and solidify our position as the ultimate destination for gaming enthusiasts. We are certain that this new addition will be welcomed with enthusiasm and curiosity," Tino said.</p>
<p>Spinomenal CEO Lior Shvartz was similarly excited about his company’s new opportunity and the chance to go live in the Italian market. Doing so with Betsson Group’s StarCasino was a great strategic move forward and expansion throughout regulated markets in Europe, Shvartz added.</p>
<p>Spinomenal has been significantly strengthening its presence in various regulated markets across the world. The company recently teamed up with Palms Bet in Bulgaria and rolled out its content portfolio in Portugal through a partnership with Luckia, another well-established local brand.</p>
