<p>The leading global sports betting operator, Tipico, expanded its US reach by announcing a new launch. The company said Wednesday that it expanded its presence to Iowa. The announcement comes after Tipico secured approval for launch from the gambling regulator in the state, the Iowa Racing and Gaming Commission.</p>
<p>Thanks to the latest approval, the operator revealed it launched its services for customers in the Hawkeye State. The recent launch marks the fourth US state where the leading operator offers its services after launching in key markets such as New Jersey, Ohio and Colorado.</p>
<p>In a statement released on January 11, 2023, Tipico USA's CEO, Adrian Vella, shared his excitement saying: "We are thrilled to grow our footprint and give Iowa customers access to our propriety product and competitive offering." What's more, he added that the launch enables bettors in the state to use a product that offers fast withdrawals and deposits and it is easy to use.</p>
<p>Vella outlined that Tipico's product features live betting options as well as SGP+ which offers "wide coverage on player props, and can cash out anytime â€” including partial cash out capabilities." Finally, the company's CEO said: "To top it off, Tipico's functionality is run from within the US with customer service based in New Jersey."</p>
<p>Celebrating its expansion in the US, Tipico announced special promotions for Iowa bettors. The company introduced sign-up promotions, as well as cash offers for eligible players in the state. Tipico Sportsbook mobile app is currently available for download via Google Play and Apple for customers in Iowa. Bettors can benefit from the company's leading app that offers a "unique single, unified log-in experience." The mobile betting app features a variety of sports and betting markets.</p>
<p>As a globally recognized sports betting company, Tipico offers revolutionary mobile wagering entertainment and serves many fans and bettors around the globe. Currently, the company has active partnerships with iGaming industry providers and sports leagues.</p>
<p>The launch by Tipico in Iowa isn't unexpected, considering that the state has a well-established regulated betting market. Besides online sports betting, the state currently offers wagering on sports events via retail locations as well.</p>
<p>After the US Supreme Court ruled PASPA unconstitutional back in 2018, Iowa was among the states that legalized sports wagering in 2019. Lawmakers legalized the activity in May 2019, while the market was launched shortly after, in August 2019. Besides commercial operators, tribal operators also offer legal sports wagering in Iowa. The minimum age for participating in sports betting activities in the state is 21.</p>
