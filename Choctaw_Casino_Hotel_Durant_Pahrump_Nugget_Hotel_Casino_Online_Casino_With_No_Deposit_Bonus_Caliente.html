<p>The premium gaming venue located in Jamul, California, the Jamul Casino, confirmed that together with the Jamul Indian Village of California (JIV) Tribe it has made donations to philanthropic initiatives for approximately a quarter of a million dollars. The announcement comes near the end of the year and underlines the Casino and the Tribe's commitment to support communities around San Diego and provide vital funds for organizations that help change the lives of many people.</p>
<p>Mary Cheeks, Jamul Casino's President and General Manager, helped initiate Jamul Casino's Community Champions program, an initiative that enabled the company's members to contribute to different community organizations. Throughout 2023, the Tribe and the Casino helped nearly four dozen organizations, providing vital funding and support.</p>
<p>This year, Jamul Casino supported Many Shades of Pink, an organization that offers resources and support for African American breast cancer patients. The casino donated $10,000 to the organization and also hosted a luncheon that took place during Black History Month, recognizing Dr. Suzanne Afflalo and Wendy Shurelds, two local heroic women of color.</p>
<p>Moreover, in 2023, Jamul Casino supported the LGBTQ+ community by donating 56 turkeys to the San Diego LGBT Community Center and the Imperial Court de San Diego. The donation helped support the two organizations' Annual Scott Carlson &amp; Dan Ferbal Thanksgiving Community Dinner.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Jamul Casino showed its support for the Wounded Warrior Project, an initiative that seeks to better the lives of millions of military veterans and their families. Back in August, the operator supported the Project's Carry Forward 5K event.</p>
<p>The National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), an organization that is focused on improving the lives of Americans affected by different mental illnesses, was among the organizations that were supported by the Tribe and Casino. Earlier this year, Jamul Casino helped sponsor NAMI's NAMIWalks event this year which seeks to raise awareness about mental illness and reduce stigma.</p>
<p>Erica M. Pinto, the Chairwoman of the Jamul Indian Village, commented on the topic in a statement. "It has been an honor to partner with so many organizations serving our community, and be a part of their efforts to make a difference," she explained. Additionally, Pinto pointed out: "We look forward to continuing to support our region's underserved communities."</p>
<p>Mary Cheeks, Jamul Casino's President and General Manager, shared her excitement about the Community Champions program. She explained: "Community Champions is a great way for the Casino to come alongside our team members, encourage their participation in community service, and invest in the causes important to them." Finally, Cheeks said: "It's been a thrill to see this initiative really take off and become such a force for good in the community."</p>
