    <h1>West Virginia Casino Station Casino Bingo St Ignace Casino Boulder Casino Las Vegas Century Casinos</h1>

<p>Loto Quebec will be the first provincial lottery in Canada that will add Red Tiger slots and other games to its portfolio as the country’s iGaming, lottery, and betting market all make a shift towards the private market. With this in mind, it’s evident that provincial operators would need to become more competitive and seek to compete with the mainstream options out there.</p>
<p>Welcome to a Variety of Games</p>
<p>This way, Loto Quebec will have access to numerous titles, including some of the best iGaming blockbusters such as Gonzo’s Quest Megaways, Piggy Riches Megaways, Primate King, and not least, Cash Volt. The company is part of NetEnt, which was acquired by Evolution, and has its distinct footprint in the vertical.</p>
<p>Players are welcome to explore a number of excellent gameplay features, and importantly – a series of hourly, daily and progressive jackpots. Commenting on the partnership, North American commercial director for Evolution, Jeff Millar, welcomed the partnership and said that the company was thrilled to be launching its products on Loto Quebec.</p>
<p>“We’re excited to build on this relationship and hope that this is just the beginning of a long and fruitful partnership and that Loto Quebec will be able to benefit from our innovative new titles as we continue to grow.” Evolution NA commercial director Jeff Millar</p>
<p>Red Tiger has been actively looking to expand its footprint this year and it has already launched several new successful ventures. One is with AB Trav och Galopp or ATG and another is in the UK where the company teamed up with MrQ.</p>
<p>A Series of Successful Partnerships</p>
<p>The company also released a new Narcos Mexico slot based on the award-winning Netflix series. Before that, Red Tiger established a partnership with Gamingtec. Overall, Red Tiger has been one of the most successful independent studios working under the NetEnt and Evolution’s umbrella and it has produced a series of excellent games.</p>
<p>Lotto Quebec will benefit from an improved portfolio of games that it can now share out with its consumers and compete with any private company in the future.</p>
