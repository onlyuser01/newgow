<p>ReelPlay has shifted CCO David Johnson to the position of chief executive, as the company shakes up its internal structure preparing for a busy 2021.</p>
<p>Former Chief Commercial Officer Becomes ReelPlay’s New CEO</p>
<p>Stepping in as CEO, David Johnson previously served as the company’s chief commercial officer and joined in 2018 together with former CEO Scott Smith. Johnson’s previous experience includes successful roles in commercial operations at Cryptologic, NextGen Gaming and NYX Gaming Group. SG Digital acquired NYX in 2018.</p>
<p>On the occasion of the appointment, Johnson gave his thanks to his colleagues and company. “I’m delighted to be given the opportunity to continue to drive the business forward as CEO. With great credit to Scott, the founders and the team at ReelPlay HQ, the business is perfectly positioned to capitalize on the solid foundations we’ve placed over the last couple of years.”</p>
<p>Johnson added that he would oversee ReelPlay’s further expansion into new markets and verticals. Expansion would depend on the company’s efforts to strike new partnerships with some of the leading licensed iGaming operators.</p>
<p>As part of Johnson’s appointment, Smith will step back to a board and advisory position in order to oversee the studio’s further development. Previously, Smith and Johnson oversaw the transition and re-branding of the business from Chance Interactive to ReelPlay in 2019. The company has grown significantly since then with many new partnerships of late.</p>
<p>The Studio’s Slots Content Is Available in Different Markets</p>
<p>ReelPlay games are available in the European market through distribution partners SG Digital, Relax Gaming, Yggdrasil and Playzido.</p>
<p>Thanks to the company’s most recent partnership with SG Digital, ReelPlay games are now available in Michigan and New Jersey. The latest studio slots to launch in the New Jersey market is exclusively available at Golden Nugget Online Casino.</p>
<p>ReelPlay continues to offer its market expertise, game building experience, math development, marketing and integration to partner studios who wish to take their own content to the online scene.</p>
<p>ReelPlay is a Sydney-based iGaming studio and supplier that designs and creates its own in-house slot games. From the initial sketch all the way through to the implementation process with partners.</p>
<p>Perhaps studio’s most famous feature is Infinity Reels™, where each spin makes it possible to add a new reel. Each new reel increases the multiplier for all wins. The higher the number of reels, the bigger the chance a player gets to land a jackpot.</p>
