<p>The American gambling operator FanDuel is seeking to expand its business with a new land-based sportsbook in Chicago. The company envisions opening the new venue at the United Center stadium.</p>
<p>FanDuel’s Plans for the Sportsbook</p>
<p>The United Center is owned by two notable sports franchises – the Chicago Bulls team from the National Basketball Association and the Chicago Blackhawks from the National Hockey League. Picking such an appealing location is FanDuel’s key strategy for success.</p>
<p>According to the operator’s plans, the sports betting venue will have two floors and will be equipped with all the necessary tech to provide for a great wagering experience. Visitors will be able to watch games on numerous screens and pick among various sports and tournaments.</p>
<p>The retail sportsbook is yet to be approved by the Illinois Gaming Board. In the meantime, FanDuel and United Center will collaborate on creating a non-wagering space in the main atrium. It will be a place where fans can go to watch live sports events and will also serve to promote FanDuel’s upcoming sportsbook.</p>
<p>FanDuel’s Wants to Provide Fans With Top Betting Experience</p>
<p>Amy Howe, the chief executive of FanDuel, praised the Chicago sports fans as some of the most loyal and passionate in the world. Because of this, she is delighted to announce the operator’s plans for a retail sportsbook and is looking forward to delivering something that surpasses fans’ expectations. Howe added that FanDuel wants to make the new sportsbook the to-go venue for sports betting in Chicago:</p>
<p>“Our team has a track record of delivering incredible retail locations for fans, and we can’t wait to make this sportsbook lounge the premier destination for Chicago sports fans and a place where they can fully experience the FanDuel brand.” FanDuel chief executive Amy Howe</p>
<p>Howard Pizer, the chief executive officer and executive vice president of the United Center, trusts in FanDuel’s experience and believes it will be a great partner of the Chicago stadium. He pointed to the operator’s proven track record of innovation and excellence and said he is excited to see them make an immersive sportsbook lounge that offers unparalleled sports betting experiences.</p>
<p>If FanDuel gets approved for building the sportsbook, this will signify an expansion with its pre-existing relationship with the Chicago Bulls and Chicago Blackhawks. The operator is already partnering with the two franchises on various media and advertisement activations.</p>
<p>FanDuel’s announcement comes a day after BetMGM announced it will also be opening a new retail location. The latter operator has picked the Nationals Park stadium in Washington DC as the home of its new lounge.</p>
