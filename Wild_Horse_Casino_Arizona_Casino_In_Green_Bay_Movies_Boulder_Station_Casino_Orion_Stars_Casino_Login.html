    <h1>Wild Horse Casino Arizona Casino In Green Bay Movies Boulder Station Casino Orion Stars Casino Login</h1>

<p>If you are not satisfied with the complaint solution, I recommend you consult the gambling authority that regulates the casino. In case of any questions, feel free to write to me at branislav.b@casino.guru.</p>
<p>I am sorry we were not able to help you with this one, but please, do not hesitate to contact us in the future, if you run into any issues with this or any other casino. We are here to help.</p>
<p>I would just like to add that if both accounts were active and the casino paid you some withdrawals in the past, it does not mean that it is allowed or that the casino knew about it. Some casinos pay the players if there is no reason to perform a deep investigation, or if there are only withdrawals of lower amounts. Until a deep investigation is made, they do not have to know about any breach or connections between the accounts.</p>
<p>As for the winnings, your disputed funds were obtained from the bonus (no-deposit spins, and free spins from another deposit bonus). Although you deposited real money into your account, the mentioned account balance of $314,720 CLP was in the bonus balance, and your real money balance was lost by playing some time ago. It means that if no rules were breached, you would be able to withdraw only €50 from this bonus anyway. However, the mentioned bonus funds were won from bonus(es) that you were not eligible for.</p>
<p>You can read about the terms and conditions I am referring to on the casino website (available HERE ), sections 2, 3, 7, and 9. We are talking about industry-standard rules, and you accepted them upon registration.</p>
<p>These are the main things that influenced our decision regarding your issue, and play against you:</p>
<p>After gathering all the necessary information, and having an internal discussion with my team, we decided to close this complaint as unjustified. Now I will explain why.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are many factors indicating a breach of the casino's terms and conditions, and it would be very hard or even impossible to prove the opposite.</p>
<p>Dear monik1980,</p>
<p>Thank you for your email and the additional information.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are many factors indicating a breach of the casino's terms and conditions, and it would be very hard or even impossible to prove the opposite.</p>
<p>After gathering all the necessary information, and having an internal discussion with my team, we decided to close this complaint as unjustified. Now I will explain why.</p>
<p>These are the main things that influenced our decision regarding your issue, and play against you:</p>
<p>It does not matter if the other connected accounts are real or fictitious - using more than 1 account per person is strictly prohibited in online casinos, and using them in the way you mentioned is against the casino's terms and conditions</p>
<p>Each player has to use only the casino account that belongs to him/her, and it is forbidden to disclose (knowingly or not) the credentials to any 3rd party and/or to allow anyone to use his/her account</p>
<p>Each player is obliged to use only payment methods in their name - this was breached at the point you used your boyfriend's payment method, or when he used your payment method for the deposit; in addition, full verification is a must to be able to withdraw the significant winnings from the casino account - this likely would not be possible after you used your boyfriend's payment method</p>
<p>In short, all bonus offers are limited to one per user - based on the fact both accounts used exactly the same bonuses in the past, this rule was also breached, and from this moment, you were not eligible for any of the further bonuses that you claimed in the casino</p>
<p>Matches of the used devices and IP addresses just confirm the above-mentioned, thus it would be almost impossible to prove that you or your boyfriend did not play with both accounts, especially after you confessed it was like that</p>
