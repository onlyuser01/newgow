<p>Stakelogic Live, a provider of live casino games and a subsidiary of the namesake Stakelogic, has launched its first game show title with BetCity in the Dutch gaming market. The game is exclusively available to BetCity in the Netherlands in the next 30 days before hitting the global market.</p>
<p>New Live Game Comes as BetCity Exclusive</p>
<p>“Super Stake Roulette 5,000X” marks the latest collaboration between the two companies that have been working hard to establish a reliable and mutually-beneficial partnership. The latest launch attests to that.</p>
<p>In the new game, Stakelogic Live uses the proprietary Super Stake feature that allows players to double their bet for a chance to trigger some of the bonus features available in the game. The game allows you to increase your straight-up wagers by 50%, Stakelogic explains in a press release.</p>
<p>The roulette wheel in the game has thirty-seven numbers, from 1-36, and a single 0. Super Stake Roulette will pay you 29:1 on a straight-up bet and will include 1-5 Silver Numbers, which can be multiplied by 750X if the feature is triggered. The Super Stake feature will increase the bets by 50%, Stakelogic explains, and a 1,000X Multiplier applies on the so-called Gold Numbers.</p>
<p>There is an additional Money Wheel feature that could result in a sizeable win of 5,000X Multiplier which is where the game takes its name from. Commenting on this new release, Stakelogic Live said that the company was thrilled to welcome this product and opportunity with BetCity.nl.</p>
<p>Partnership Welcomed by BetCity and Stakelogic</p>
<p>Company CEO Stephan van den Oetelaar praised the relationship the two companies have been able to establish over the years:</p>
<p>We are thrilled to be launching Super Stake Roulette 5,000X with BetCity.nl. This is a testament to the strength of our partnership and also our position as the leading supplier of live dealer content in the Netherlands and beyond. Company CEO Stephan van den Oetelaar</p>
<p>BetCity.nl CEO Melvin Bostelaar was similarly pleased with the partnership opportunity and said that Super Stake Roulette 5,000X is an engaging piece of content. He added:</p>
<p>Stakelogic Live is responsible for truly thrilling and engaging live casino content, so it made total sense for us to launch Super Stake Roulette 5,000X exclusively for our players. Company CEO Stephan van den Oetelaar</p>
<p>Stakelogic Live already has a content distribution plan with Relax Gaming, which enables it to reach audiences quickly and efficiently.</p>
