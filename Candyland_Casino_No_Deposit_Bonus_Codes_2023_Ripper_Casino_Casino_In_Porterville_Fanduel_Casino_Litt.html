<p>A new report suggests that the slot machine developer may close its Las Vegas headquarters last month and lay off approximately 100 employees</p>
<p>Aruze Gaming is a Las Vegas-headquartered developer of slot machines, famous for delivering thrilling games such as Go Go Claw, Shoot to Win Craps and Dazzling Muso Dragon, among others. While the company’s products are renowned in multiple important gambling markets, earlier this year, it filed for bankruptcy in Nevada court in what was described as a plan for financial restructuring.</p>
<p>However, now a new report suggests that Aruze Gaming is expected to soon close the doors of its Las Vegas headquarters. As announced by the Las Vegas Review-Journal, citing a required notice to the Nevada Department of Employment, Training and Rehabilitation, the company expects to close its headquarters effective from August 18, 2023.</p>
<p>This closure is expected to affect approximately 100 workers that may ultimately be laid off. Under the current regulations in Nevada, closures of businesses require notice with the aforementioned agency. Aruze Gaming is yet to unveil official details regarding the possible closure and how it can affect its employees.</p>
<p>Filing for Bankruptcy Was a Part of a Restructuring Strategy</p>
<p>The announcement about the closure comes after earlier this year, the company confirmed it has filed bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code with the US Bankruptcy Court for the State of Nevada. At the time, Aruze Gaming’s global chief executive officer, Yugo Kinoshita, explained that the filing was “due to external factors” and explained it was a part of “a critical business strategy.”</p>
<p>“We fully understand the implications associated with this action, but we believe this is the best way for Aruze to maintain the overall health of our business.“ Yugo Kinoshita, global chief executive officer of Aruze Gaming</p>
<p>He explained that the company is aware of the implications that are associated with the filing but said that Aruze identified this as the best way to maintain a healthy business. Additionally, Kinoshita said that the strategic restructuring of the business isn’t expected to impact “the health of Aruze.” Upon announcing the bankruptcy filing, the company explained that it was related to a garnishment judgment against it which was the result of a separate judgment against a shareholder.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Aruze Gaming confirmed it secured a license in Pennsylvania. Back in February, the company confirmed it was awarded a license, allowing it to deliver its leading services to operators in the state.</p>
