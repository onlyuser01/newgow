<p>As we predicted, the Dallas Mavericks were able to take the NBA Western Conference finals to the fifth game. On Tuesday evening, they defeated the Golden State Warriors 119-109 at American Airlines Center in Dallas, TX.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for the Mavs, the Western Conference finals Game 5 is not played on their turf. Instead, the series is moving back to California. Golden State’s home arena, Chase Center in San Francisco, is the place where the fifth game of the finals will take place on Thursday, May 26.</p>
<p>Knowing that the Warriors have all wins in the previous 10 games, it’s no surprise that bookmakers see them as the betting favorite in Game 5.</p>

<p>Dallas Mavericks Need a Miracle on Wednesday Evening</p>
<p>In the 2022 NBA Playoffs, the Mavericks owe everything to one player – Luka Doncic. The 23-year-old Slovenian forward has been nothing short of fabulous, scoring over 20 points in every single game in the postseason.</p>
<p>Actually, in a couple of games, he was even better than that. In fact, in the previous three duels with the Warriors, Doncic scored a total of 112 points.</p>
<p>Even though he was superb on the court, most of his teammates haven’t been too great. At least that was the case in the first three games of the series. However, in Tuesday’s game, a couple of them stepped up, taking their performances to the next level.</p>
<p>In addition to Doncic, who scored 30 points that evening, five other Dallas players recorded double figures.</p>
<p>Golden State Warriors Going for Another Home Win</p>
<p>Only one team in the entire NBA had a better home record in the regular season than the Golden State Warriors. The team in question is the Phoenix Suns, who had one win more than the Warriors. Speaking of the Suns, they got knocked out of the NBA Playoffs by Dallas.</p>
<p>Not only were the Warriors superb at Staple Center during the regular season, but they’ve been even better in home games during the playoffs. In fact, they got all wins in the 2022 postseason.</p>
<p>Two of those wins happened in the opening two games of the Western Conference finals. In Game 1, they destroyed the Mavs 112-87; in Game 2, the score was 126-117 for the team from San Francisco.</p>
<p>Dallas Mavericks vs Golden State Warriors Game 5</p>
<p>It’s likely that the Western Conference finals will end with Game 5. The Warriors need only one win to win the division, which seems like a very probable scenario. The main reason is that they have some incredible players on the roster. Another reason why they’re likely to win on Thursday is that Game 5 is played on their turf.</p>
<p>Picks: Golden State Warriors to win and cover the spread; over to hit</p>
