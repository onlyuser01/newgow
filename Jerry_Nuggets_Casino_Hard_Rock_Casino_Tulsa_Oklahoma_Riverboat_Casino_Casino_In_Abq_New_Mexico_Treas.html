    <h1>Jerry Nuggets Casino Hard Rock Casino Tulsa Oklahoma Riverboat Casino Casino In Abq New Mexico Treas</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am having an issue with iWildCasino. After losing thousands of Euros over time, I managed to convert accumulated points into 150€ cash.</p>
<p>This 150€ then became subject to a 50x wager. Meaning, I had to bet 7500€ to turn this bonus money into real cash.</p>
<p>After two long days, I succeeded and had approximately 1400€ in my account, which was designated as real money. I continued to play the following day and turned that into 2400€.</p>
<p>Now, here lies the problem.</p>
<p>The maximum one can withdraw per day is 1200€ in 400€ increments. So, I requested three withdrawals of 400€. The next day, I received an email from iWildCasino stating that according to §1.4, one can only payout 5x the bonus, regardless of the actual winnings. Thus, I could only withdraw 750€ (150€x5).</p>
<p>The rest of the money was just erased from my account...!!! So, 1650€ of winnings were simply deleted from my account, even though it was previously designated as real money. Now, when I inquire, they keep referencing the aforementioned $1.4 from the bonus, which restricts payout to only x5. In my opinion, this is a clear scam!! 1. It was advertised as real money 2. They allowed me to continue playing 3. I had to put in a wager of 7500€... 4. The bonus period had ended.</p>
<p>Can someone please help me recoup this money?</p>
