<p>MGM Resorts International, the leading gaming and hospitality company, announced the opening of its new poker room located at Beau Rivage Resort &amp; Casino, the premier casino resort located in Biloxi, Mississippi. The opening of the new poker room on December 21, 2023, came ahead of the Beau Rivage Heater Poker Tournament, one of the most anticipated and largest poker events for the year at the casino.</p>
<p>The revamped poker room is located between the recently refurbished Buffet and the Buffalo Zone. The poker room is close to the convention-level escalators and promises poker fans exceptional experiences. Visitors to the new poker room can use four cashier windows and view dozens of 65-inch, as well as bigger screens to keep track of their favorite sports events.</p>
<p>The new poker room at Beau Rivage Resort &amp; Casino stands out with functional furnishing and offers an environment that is comfortable for poker players. Offering exceptional conveniences, the poker room features 12 tables.</p>
<p>A statement released by MGM Resorts reveals that the new poker room was designed by Dietz &amp; Co. Architects, one of the largest architectural firms in Western Massachusetts. The construction company which is based in Springfield, Massachusetts, specializes in engineering and design. Dietz &amp; Co. Architects helped design the new poker room with "Southern hospitality in mind," perfectly fusing convenient amenities and quality designs. According to MGM Resorts, the poker room is open daily between 10 AM and 4 AM, offering different daily promotions, as well as tournaments.</p>
<p>Adam Nash, Beau Rivage Poker Room Manager, said on the topic: "We are thrilled to open our latest gaming amenity specifically for our poker players. Poker now has a permanent home that is closer to the casino entrance and the base of the conventional level escalators where our major poker tournaments take place, including our upcoming Beau Rivage Heater."</p>
<p>Additionally, he pointed out: "Our poker players have called our temporary poker room home for a number of years. Our new state-of-the-art poker room is part of a larger-scale multi-million dollar project, and was definitely worth the wait." Nash predicted that the Beau Rivage Heater may be the largest poker event for the casino so far. Finally, he said Beau Rivage Resort &amp; Casino is looking forward to the thrilling entertainment the new poker room will deliver for guests of the venue.</p>
