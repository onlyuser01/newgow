<p>The MoU aligns the MGA and AGCC’s common values and allows them to perform their tasks more effectively</p>
<p>The Malta Gaming Authority (MGA) confirmed that it has renewed its Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Alderney Gambling Control Commission (AGCC). As a result, the two authorities will continue working together into 2024 and beyond, supporting one another when needed.</p>
<p>The MoU aligns the MGA and AGCC’s common values and allows them to perform their tasks more effectively. By working together, the two regulatory bodies can bolster their crime prevention efforts, improve consumer protection and shield vulnerable demographics from gambling addiction.</p>
<p>Both parties recognize the benefits of collaboration, echoing the UKGC’s earlier calls for international cooperation between regulatory bodies. Cross-border partnerships between regulators are one of the hot topics of the industry today and reflect the need for joint action in tackling addiction, illegal gambling and gambling-related crime.</p>
<p>For reference, the AGCC is the regulatory body of Alderney and was established in 2000. Alderney is one of the Bailiwick of Guernsey’s three jurisdictions and is a British Crown dependency serving as an offshore licensing jurisdiction.</p>
<p>While still significantly smaller than Malta and Curacao, Alderney is ambitious to grow its overall presence in gaming.</p>
<p>The MGA and AGCC Value Their Partnership</p>
<p>The original MoU between the MGA and the AGCC was signed in 2013. Commenting on its renewal, MGA’s chief executive officer, Carl Brincat, said:</p>
<p>The renewal of the MoU with the AGCC continues to reaffirm our shared commitment towards supervising a safe and responsible gaming ecosystem across the board. Carl Brincat, CEO, MGA</p>
<p>Andrew Gellatly, the AGCC’s executive director, also commented on the matter, saying that his team is excited by the opportunity to continue working with the MGA. He believes that the MoU benefits both the regulators and the industry as a whole.</p>
<p>With this MOU, we look forward to continuing and strengthening our valued collaboration with the MGA, to the benefit of both players and stakeholders. Andrew Gellatly, executive director, AGCC</p>
<p>Speaking of Gellatly, the executive director just confirmed that Alderney’s money laundering and terrorism financing risk profile has been raised. He justified the increase with the European Commission’s most recent concerns.</p>
