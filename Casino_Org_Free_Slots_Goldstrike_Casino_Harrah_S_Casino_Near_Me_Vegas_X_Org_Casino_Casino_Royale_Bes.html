<p>Global leader in geolocation security GeoComply announced its chairman and co-founder Anna Sainsbury stepped in as the company’s chief executive officer effective January 1, 2022.</p>
<p>Change at the Helm</p>
<p>Sainsbury, who had served as GeoComply CEO for seven years since she co-founded the company in 2011, succeeded fellow co-founder David Briggs who had spent four years at the helm from 2018 to 2021 and spearheaded the business during its expansion phase. During Brigg’s tenure, revenues at GeoComply jumped by more than 1500%.</p>

Anna is a natural-born leader and visionary and I have every confidence that her passion and dedication will take GeoComply to new heights.” David Briggs, Director and Co-Founder, GeoComply</p>
<p>Briggs will continue to be “an essential part of the company,” serving as director with a focus on “special projects” to provide “core leadership on GeoComply’s future in fintech,” Sainsbury outlined commenting on her new role.</p>
<p>“He will also focus on managing and delivering innovation on the product front and will take a central role in consolidating our internship and graduate recruitment programs to secure a bright future for our team’s growth.” Anna Sainsbury, CEO and Co-Founder, GeoComply</p>
<p>Sainsbury concluded by underlying the company’s achievements during Briggs’ four-year tenure, a period of transformation that saw the expansion into “exciting verticals” and investments from institutional investors.</p>
<p>An entrepreneur, leader and philanthropist, Sainsbury also sits on the boards of the American Gaming Association (AGA) and NASDAQ-listed MVB Bank, has been awarded numerous accolades, including the RBC Momentum Award, and has been selected among The Most Influential Women in gaming and business.</p>
