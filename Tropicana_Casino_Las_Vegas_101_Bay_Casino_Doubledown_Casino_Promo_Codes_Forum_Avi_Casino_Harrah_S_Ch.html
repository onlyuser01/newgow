<p>Sports Information Services has bid goodbye to its greyhound simulcast operations in the US at the end of 2023</p>
<p>The leading provider of nonstop betting services to global retail and online operators, Sports Information Services (SIS), finished off last year by subtly stepping back from its greyhound simulcast operations on the US market.</p>
<p>“A Simple Economic Decision”</p>
<p>The company, which supplies betting operators with “desirable and profitable content” featuring end-to-end solutions and versatile markets and pricing for driving betting revenue, had provided thousands of races from Mexican, Irish, and English tracks to US-based operators.</p>
<p>SIS is jointly owned by some of the most reputable players in the UK’s betting industry, with names like 888, William Hill, Entain, and Betfred on top of the list.</p>
<p>Via its joint venture with Arena Racing, Entain, which is SIS’ largest shareholder with a 23% stake, owns nine out of the 20 licensed British greyhound tracks. The same joint venture has brought Entain the media rights for five independent greyhound tracks.</p>
<p>According to an email sent to Casino.org earlier in the week by SIS Content Services’ vice president, Michele Fischer, the move was “a simple economic decision.” Fischer further explained that, in the context of a growing number of US states banning bets on greyhound products, “there are not enough parimutuel operators able to sell the content to produce a profitable product.”</p>
<p>She also took the opportunity to further reassure the US market of their ongoing commitment to them while emphasizing that greyhound racing no longer represents one of their areas of interest.</p>
<p>The News, Celebrated by Grey2K USA Worldwide</p>
<p>The “very unfortunate situation,” however, received the opposite reaction from Grey2K USA Worldwide, which is a campaign group with a clear goal of putting an end to greyhound racing once and for all.</p>
<p>The organization expressed its excitement regarding the news using the voice of its executive director, Carey Thiel. Thield described the decision of one of the world’s largest companies that own dog tracks to end all greyhound simulcasting operations in the US as something “huge.”</p>
<p>The organization took the opportunity to once again convey its clear message “that the US market will not be used to prop up the cruelty of greyhound racing.”</p>
<p>Last October, SIS announced its plans to extend on the African land via an agreement inked with Aardvark Technologies.</p>
<p>The news followed the January 2023 partnership signed with local African operator Jolibet, known as a reputable powerhouse in the market.</p>
<p>A month before that, the company said it would integrate its premium product portfolio with Altenar’s sportsbook.</p>
