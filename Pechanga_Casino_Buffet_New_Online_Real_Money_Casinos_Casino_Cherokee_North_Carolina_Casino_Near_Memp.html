<p>German Sports Betting Group Decries Call For Advertising Ban</p>

<p>If Germany doesn’t want to keep falling back down the rabbit hole of unprotected consumer gambling, it’s not going about it the right way. At least that’s the assertions of one sports betting organization in the country.</p>

<p>The German Sports Betting Association (DSWV) is criticizing new rules proposed by the government that would prohibit all sports betting advertising.</p>
<p>The trade body stated it “emphatically rejected” the proposed rules. If there is no advertising, there’s no way for Germans to know how to separate the licensed and regulated operators from the unlicensed ones, they claim.</p>
<p>The proposal comes from Ulrich Mäurer, the senator for the German state of Bremen (in Northwest Germany).</p>
<p>The Social Democratic Party member and Bremen’s Senator for the Interior of the State believes that this would be the best method to combat problem gambling. He voiced his opinion during a meeting of Interior Ministers.</p>
<p>Banning Advertising Bad For Consumers</p>
<p>The DSWV believes the ban would only make problem gambling worse, however.</p>
<p>Since there are still many illegal providers active on the German market, the possibility of advertising for permitted providers is of central importance. How else should citizens differentiate between safe and unsafe offers?” said DSWV President Mathias Dahms.</p>
<p>In addition to the consumer protection advertising can offer, the DSWV accuses the senator of violating the law with his proposal.</p>
<p>When Bremen and the other 15 German states approved the latest version of the country’s gambling treaty, known locally as GlüNeuRStv, they specifically addressed marketing and advertising. The activities were approved and included in that latest interstate agreement, the Fourth Interstate Gambling Treaty.</p>
<p>More Questions Than Answers</p>
<p>The GlüNeuRStv treaty was meant to bring solidarity across gambling regulations in the country. The treaty specifically outlines taxes, deposit limits, product restrictions and, now, advertising bans.</p>
<p>Ideally, this unification would make laws less confusing for users and organizations. However, it has not been smooth sailing. Some organizations, like the European Gaming and Betting Association, have spoken out against the treaty and are calling a double standard in the regulations. Specifically, questions and controversy remain over tax rates and who will be able to provide what services.</p>
<p>Previously, in accordance with the provisions of the GlüNeuRStv, advertising was approved, but only between the hours of 9 PM and 6 AM. Ads are not allowed to target minors and cannot hint at being able to solve financial problems.</p>
