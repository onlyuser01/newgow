    <h1>Casino Royale Vesper Lynd Las Vegas Hotels Casinos Free Casino Game Sunscape Curacao Resort Spa And</h1>

<p>I made a deposit from the bonus and tried to withdraw because I had accumulated a certain amount.</p>
<p>Other certifications have been completed, but there was a passport, idCard or driver's license column, but regarding the driver's license, if it is not a Ukrainian driver's license, it says to contact support, so contact me and apply I was told that the person and the document do not match. I was asked to send a name in English and a photo to verify my identity, so I sent it. After that, I was asked to send a screenshot of the front and back of my passport or id passport, with it in my hand. The passport or id must be in English. Are you Japanese? Do I have to add English to the idCard? Where do you write it? I wonder if they are dealing with that because they are Japanese. English It's called English, but it's strange that Japanese people can use this site. It took me a long time to withdraw money. My driver's license isn't good, even though I'm exposing my real face and photos. Not everyone has a passport. Moreover, at this time of corona. I can't really feel the kindness when I say that I have to speak English in the first place. I made a complaint because it was unpleasant. I want you to return the deposit amount. Do I have to bother to make a passport by paying for it?</p>
