<p>Ohio is getting ahead in the responsible gambling game. The tautology aside, the state is the first jurisdiction in the United States to actually take the threat of online wagering seriously, and to approach it with understanding.</p>
<p>Online wagering has long been associated with higher risks of developing problem gambling, something that is now fully reflected in Ohio Lottery’s "Time Out Ohio" program, which is designed to help people who struggle to control their gambling habits to get the help they need - this help is now extending to online gambling.</p>
<p>To this end, the lottery is allowing consumers to exclude themselves through the Gamban app, an advanced software that can be installed across devices and that restricts digital wagering. The app is made available for free by the state and it will allow players to keep their nose clean in theory, restricting their access to digital wagering.</p>
<p>Time Out Ohio is already available for land-based venues with consumers who have enrolled into the program not allowed to gamble physically.</p>
<p>Gamban’s software offer will however further strengthen the safeguards as it allows the state to further enhance player protection and equip local players with the means to stay safe, gamble responsibly, and more importantly – address the rising tide of problem gambling caused by the accessibility of digital products.</p>
<p>Even though sports gambling has a lower risk profile leading to gambling addiction than slots, for example, it’s important to address this issue seriously, the lottery believes.</p>
<p>Ohio Lottery Commission Responsible Gaming Director Amanda Blackford has welcomed this opportunity. She hailed Gamban as an essential tool designed to further enhance player protection in the state and set a very high example and standard for other jurisdictions in the country.</p>
<p>"Time Out is a tool for legally based blocking, but Gamban protects individuals from the illegal market as well and those beyond the Commissions’ authority," Blackford added. The news is naturally welcomed by consumer protection bodies as the United States is currently in the flux of rapid legalization of its sports gambling industry.</p>
<p>Online casino gambling could be the next big-ticket item to be discussed not just in Ohio, but well beyond, and having adequate player protection tools installed early could be the difference between high levels of gambling harm and a robust framework that protects those consumers who are the most at risk.</p>
<p>Gamban Co-founder Matt Zarb-Cousin has welcomed the opportunity to work with Ohio and praised the state for its forward-thinking attitude towards gambling harm and how to address the issue. The state has already been seeing an increase in the number of people seeking help to control their gambling. Gamban can offer them this and more.</p>
