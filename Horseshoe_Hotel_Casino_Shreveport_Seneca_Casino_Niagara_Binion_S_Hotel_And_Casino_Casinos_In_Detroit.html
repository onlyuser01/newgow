    <h1>Horseshoe Hotel Casino Shreveport Seneca Casino Niagara Binion S Hotel And Casino Casinos In Detroit</h1>

<p>My documents have been verified at Goldwin casino. I emailed in my ID, selfie with passport, POA and skrill.</p>
<p>Goldwin confirmed on email all documents were verified.</p>
<p>They then stated they wanted a selfie with me holding my POA? By this point I had recycled my utility bill so sent in my pdfs of bank statement. They confirmed these were verified. They stated they wanted the selfie with the utility bill that does not exist anymore. This would now be impossible as Im moving in September and won't be getting anymore utilities at my current address.</p>
<p>Goldwin stated they needed another selfie for verification and to prevent fraud. I offered the following as an alternative:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Another selfie with ID and hand written note</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A selfie with the local paper.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I need casinoguru to mediate as Im not sure if there is an issue with competence or something is being lost in translation with the casino.</p>
<p>I understand verification is important, but the chain events would suggest I was verfiied and then Goldwin began to request something that doesnt exist anymore to complete the process?</p>
<p>I should also note a chat agent told me to print out a bill and take a picture of that and finance would accept that? This raise a lot of red flags as this could be easily faked.</p>
<p>I would appreciate help here.</p>
