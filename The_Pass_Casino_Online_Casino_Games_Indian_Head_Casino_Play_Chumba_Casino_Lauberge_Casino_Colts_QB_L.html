<p>Luck, the NFL’s 2018 Comeback Player of the Year and a Pro Bowler, officially announced his retirement in a press conference following the Colts third preseason game, a 27-17 loss to the Chicago Bears. But the news hit the internet and social media before the end of the game, prompting a cascade of boos from Colts fan as Luck left the field. Nursing an ankle injury, Luck didn’t play in the game.</p>
<p>I’ve been stuck in this process. I haven’t been able to live the life I want to live. It’s taken the joy out of this game … the only way forward for me is to remove myself from football,” said the Stanford product in the presser.</p>
<p>Sportsbooks immediately reacted to the news. The Westgate SuperBook in Las Vegas lengthened the Colts Super Bowl odds to 30-1 from 12-1, meaning a $100 a bet on the team today to win the NFL’s biggest game would return $3,000. FanDuel sportsbook slashed the Colts season win total to 6.5 from 9.5.</p>
<p>Prescient Bets, Good Timing</p>
<p>By one account, the Borgata in Atlantic City, N.J. was slow to react to a tweet from NFL reporter Adam Schefter revealing Luck’s retirement prior to the end of the exhibition game. That casino kept the Colts’ season win total at 9.5 for 15 minutes after Schefter’s post, prompting one bettor to lay down $1,300 across four bets on the under, according to the Action Network.</p>
<p>Some books moved more swiftly. The Circa Sportsbook at the Golden Gate in Las Vegas immediately pulled the Indianapolis/Los Angeles Chargers Week 1 game that had the Charges favored by four. Circa later reopened that game to bettors at Los Angeles -6, and as of late Saturday night, had Los Angles at -7, with an over/under of 45.5. Circa listed the money line for the favorite in that game at -320, meaning a bettor need to lay $320 on the Chargers to win $100.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, some books pulled that game because of Luck’s uncertain injury status. Circa also lengthened the Colts’ odds of winning the AFC South to +260 from -120, meaning a $100 bettor would take home $260 if Indianapolis can win the division without Luck. Despite a potentially major injury to running back Lamar Miller, the Houston Texans saw their odds to win the division shortened to +240 from +360 following Luck’s retirement.</p>
<p>On Thursday, a gambler at the Circa made the largest wagers allowed by the sportsbook on Colts season totals of under 9.5 and under 8.5, according to The Action Network.</p>
<p>Other Long Odds</p>
<p>In the wake of the Luck retirement news, PointsBet extended the odds of the Colts winning the Super Bowl to 50/1 from 12/1, while moving the team’s odds on winning its division to +600. PointsBet also shaved the Colts win total to six from 10.</p>
<p>When the NFL released its 2019 regular season slate earlier this year, the Colts were tied with the Atlanta Falcons for seventh in terms of strength of schedule. The Colts’ 2019 foes had a combined 2018 winning percentage of .518.</p>
