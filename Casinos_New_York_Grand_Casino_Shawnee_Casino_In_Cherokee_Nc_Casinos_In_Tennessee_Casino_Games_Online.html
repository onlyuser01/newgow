<p>Hi</p>
<p>I found a deposit bonus of 50 percent at fantasino when I wanted to deposit and accepted it and deposited 100 euros.</p>
<p>before that i looked at the general bonus conditions.</p>
<p>there is a max withdrawal limit of 5000 euros for deposit bonuses.</p>
<p>for the 50 percent bonus I found on the deposit page I couldn't find any other specific bonus terms.</p>
<p>So I had to assume that there was a winnings limit of 5000 euros</p>
<p>are.</p>
<p>after successful implementation i was able to win 2900 euros.</p>
<p>these were limited to 1600 euros.</p>
<p>1300 euros were canceled.</p>
<p>I then contacted the live chat why the profit was limited to 1600 euros and not to 5000 euros as stated in the general bonus conditions.</p>
<p>I got the answer that there are specific bonus conditions for the bonus and that there is a win limit of 1600 euros, but I could not find any information on this before I deposited.</p>
<p>later i received an email for this 50 percent bonus which i had previously accepted, also with the reference to a max win limit of 1600 euros.</p>
<p>but why can't you find this information on fantasino the other bonus conditions apply to this 50 percent bonus.</p>
<p>I couldn't find that reference there.</p>
<p>so i had to assume that there is a win limit of 5000 euros as written in the general bonus conditions</p>
<p>i check my emails about every 24 hours when i found the email from fantasino for the 50 percent bonus it was too late i had already deposited and played before and my winnings were reduced by 1300 euros.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the casino should also point out on the website (under promotions and/or the deposit page where the bonus can be found) that other specific bonus conditions apply to this bonus, which the casino unfortunately did not do.</p>
<p>since i could not find any references to other bonus conditions on fantasino, i feel cheated of my winnings and open this case.</p>
<p>i have never had any problems with withdrawals at fantasino before, i am fully verified and it is not my first withdrawal there.</p>
