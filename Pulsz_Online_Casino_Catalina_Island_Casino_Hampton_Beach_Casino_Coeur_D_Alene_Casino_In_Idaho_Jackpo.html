    <h1>Pulsz Online Casino Catalina Island Casino Hampton Beach Casino Coeur D Alene Casino In Idaho Jackpo</h1>

<p>They asked me to add certain documents to verify that I am who I say I am which is fine and I expect that, but to be told over and over that I need to add then re-add the same documents over and over again each time they are fully approved and show approved in the documents screen is VERY VERY frustrating. All the customer service does is tell me to add the documents AGAIN ! Then today they show that I am completely approved to do a withdrawal so I attempt to withdraw my winnings only for it to read incorrect bitcoin address which is bs because I followed all the instructions and even triple checked that my bitcoin address was valid and worked in my wallet and it still gave me an error message. So I contacted customer service and they told me that they needed to verify my transactions and wanted me to send them my bank statements to show that I had made the transactions. I was like WHAAAT ?!?! How in the hell could I be playing their lame ass slots if I didn't have any funds in my account ?!?! Someone riddle me that ??Sounds to me like they were accusing me of some kind of stealing. Which I have no idea how that can be done and frankly I'm a little insulted and a lot pissed. I would not bother with this casino they have piss poor customer service, make you jump through hoops in order to receive your winnings ( even after you've provided everything that they have asked for ) ( just for them to make you do the whole uploading of doc over and over again ), then insult you and ask to see very personal information ie. bank statements, and you still walk away empty handed. Not to mention I blew through 1100 bucks of the original winnings that I had and wasn't winning crap ! Thank God, I only started with 80 bucks and didn't bet the farm with this crappy casino ! Do yourself a huge favor and spend your money elsewhere, maybe take your dog or cat for a walk instead of gambling here because you're just in for a major headache when you attempt to withdraw any money. I'll stick to my local casinos they have better games and far far less hoops to jump through !</p>
