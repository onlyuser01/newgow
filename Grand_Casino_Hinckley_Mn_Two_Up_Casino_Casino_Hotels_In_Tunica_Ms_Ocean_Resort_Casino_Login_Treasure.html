    <h1>Grand Casino Hinckley Mn Two Up Casino Casino Hotels In Tunica Ms Ocean Resort Casino Login Treasure</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>my account was frozen yesterday when the wager counter of the bonus got stuck 50 cents from conversion.</p>
<p>Of course, I contacted support, as this is clearly disadvantaging me. They suggested solutions such as clearing cache + cookies, etc. Having done that, it didn't help.</p>
<p>I continued to play to somehow convert the remaining approximately 0.50€ through many different games.</p>
<p>I already had about 12,000€ in bonus credits on my account and subsequently won another 19,000€, which were then added to my real money balance. That made a total of about 31,000€. However, the bonus money was stuck on the last ~0.50€ wager. Naturally, I didn't want to merely cancel it. I wrote to the support team again and was told that it would be forwarded. Apparently, it has been now, and my account has been frozen for 24 hours. When I follow up, I kept getting fobbed off.</p>
<p>I have an uneasy feeling that I could lose all the money I've won.</p>
<p>As I said, it was not a mistake in playing; the problem was solely with the casino's bonus wager counter. Now I worry that the casino might take advantage of this issue to favor them and even cancel the real money balance that I've won.</p>
<p>The bonus would have been wagered far away; it was just "stuck" at about 99.99999%.</p>
<p>Has anyone here had similar experiences at this casino?! Do I need to be concerned or not?</p>
<p>As I said, this is not about a few euros but about approximately 31,000€.</p>
<p>Many thanks!</p>
