    <h1>Casino Harrah S San Diego Casino In Chandler Casino Quest Free Vegas Casino Slots Sunland Racetrack</h1>

<p>Hello…</p>
<p>I have played a total of maybe four times. The third time, I had a small win of about 150€ on a 50€ stake. At that time, they held me up with various verifications, such as proof of residence through third-party bills like energy or GEMA, even though I had to scan my ID beforehand. In the end, I played along and eventually received my payout of around 130€.</p>
<p>Last Friday, I played again and won 350€. I thought after successfully navigating the previous verification process, I would get my winnings without any issues,</p>
<p>alas, no,</p>
<p>I now have 355€ in credit, but only a maximum of 0.18€</p>
<p>can be paid out.</p>
<p>I contacted the support chat, but they couldn't provide a satisfactory answer. Instead, they gave me a kind of comparison where I would only get nearly a third of my winnings at a 1:3.5 ratio to my disadvantage. Unfortunately, I didn't take any screenshots of this chat. To make matters worse, my winning history has now been tampered with so that the winning game is no longer visible.</p>
<p>Instead, in my history, there is a different game that I once played, albeit with negligible success. Now it shows a whopping win of over 36000€.</p>
<p>I have no idea what the strategic motive behind this is.</p>
<p>I am very upset and want to leave this site…but I want to take my winnings with me….</p>
<p>What can I do?</p>
<p>Thank you for your time</p>
