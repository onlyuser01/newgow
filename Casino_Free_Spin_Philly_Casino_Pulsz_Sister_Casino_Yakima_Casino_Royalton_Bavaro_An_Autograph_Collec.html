    <h1>Casino Free Spin Philly Casino Pulsz Sister Casino Yakima Casino Royalton Bavaro An Autograph Collec</h1>

<p>I was playing zodiac casino on Jan 12th. I was playing gold blitz at $5 bet. I was at $1590 in winnings. The game started glitching and then took $100 when I so called won. Then in 5 seconds it took another $100 from my account amd booted me out of the gold blitz game. It took me to the main zodiac page. I them screen shot bc I couldn't believe what was happening. It then logged me out of my game and locked me out of my account by itsself. I tried to log right back in and thought I got hacked or something. I spoke to a live agent and told them exactly what happened and they told Me to email risk management. I did and the response I got was to change my email and security questions and that it was my fault someone got into my account and that I knew who it was. That I wasn't going to get a refund on my winnings (it went to .36 cents by the time the live agent verified it was Me). Noone has access to my cell phone and I was in the middle of the game while it started glitching. I took a screen shot of when I got to the home page before it locked Me out and told them of the time and told them to look at the game history. They made it seem like it was my fault my money disappeared and no longer want to help me look further into this investigation. They emailed me again and said investigation is now closed. Please do not trust Zodiac casino as they made it seem like I was lying about the glitches etc.</p>
