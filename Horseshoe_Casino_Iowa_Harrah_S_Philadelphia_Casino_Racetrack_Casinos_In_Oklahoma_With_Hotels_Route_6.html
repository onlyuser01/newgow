<p>Rivers Casino Pittsburgh has struck an official partnership with local NHL franchise Pittsburgh Penguins. As per the partnership, Rivers is now the official sports betting sponsor for the Penguins.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh Penguins and Rivers Casino Team Up</p>
<p>The Pittsburgh Penguins, an NHL franchise, has signed a ground-breaking partnership with Rush Street-owned Rivers Casino Pittsburgh. As per the agreement, Rivers Casino will become the official casino and sportsbook partner for the team as well as build a dedicated betting lounge at the Penguins’ home stadium, the PPG Paints Arena.</p>
<p>Naturally, the partnership involves exchange and free access to each company’s IP, with Rivers Casino and BetRivers working on special branding and advertisement opportunities. The dedicated sports betting lounge will be reminiscent of the sportsbook currently operating at Rivers Casino Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>Rivers will deck out the lounge with state-of-the-art screens, a bar and rows of seating while ensuring social distance as long as such is necessary. The Penguins and Rivers Casino go a long while back as Rivers Casino is working with the Lemieux Foundation, which is the Penguins’ charitable partner set up by Mario Lemieux, a former NHL player.</p>
<p>Commenting on the partnership, Penguins chief executive and president David Morehouse said that the deal was a propitious opportunity to expand on the existing relationship between the teams. Here is what he had to add:</p>
<p>“The BetRivers Lounge is one of a number of projects we are undertaking at PPG Paints Arena to provide an enhanced and safe fan experience in a post-Covid environment.”</p>
<p>Rush Street Interactive’s COO, Mattias Stetz, added that it was a pleasure to see the company team up with a reputable sports franchise with a strong support from fans. Stetz had this to add:</p>
<p>“Pittsburgh is a hockey town and the Penguins have a rich history of success, winning the Stanley Cup on five occasions, most recently with their back-to-back Cups in 2016 and 2017.”</p>
