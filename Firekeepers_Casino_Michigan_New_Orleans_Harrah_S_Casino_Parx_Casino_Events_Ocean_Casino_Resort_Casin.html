<p>Spinomenal, an acclaimed and leading iGaming studio and developer, has established a new partnership with Solverde.pt in Portugal, strengthening both companies' local footprint and ensuring that local players have access to a variety of worthwhile gaming opportunities.</p>
<p>Moving forward, Solverde.pt will benefit from Spinomenal’s range of games that will be integrated directly and allow players to enjoy such established blockbusters by the company as Demi Gods IV, Egyptian Rebirth II, Book of Demi Gods II, Poseidon’s Rising, and a number of other similarly exciting and worthwhile options.</p>
<p>Spinomenal has fast-tracked a new generation of highly thematic, original, and mechanically advanced games in 2023, enabling players to access and enjoy a variety of brand-new and established slot experiences.</p>
<p>Both companies are confident that this new alliance will allow them to boost their brand recognition and ensure that local players get access to the products that they have come to expect on the local market.</p>
<p>Commenting on this opportunity, Spinomenal CEO Lior Shvartz said that the company was indeed very pleased to be able to integrate its content library directly with Solverde.pt. This partnership serves to highlight the commitment that Spinomenal has shown not just to the iGaming market in general, but to specific highly-promising jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Solverde.pt Head of R&amp;D Sérgio Pascoal was similarly pleased with the opportunity and argued that the operator is constantly trying to be one step ahead of the competition, and market trends in general.</p>
<p>Adding the Book of Demi Gods to the casino’s library is definitely a great way to continue moving in the right direction, Pascoal explained. Spinomenal has been on a tear of late, making sure that the supplier has a very strong footprint in multiple markets.</p>
<p>The company deployed more than 300 HTML5 games in Bulgaria with ELITE.bg in November, and before that, with WINBET in September, establishing itself locally. The supplier has not just relied on direct integrations either, however, as Spinomenal has seen the value of partnering up with aggregation solutions and platforms.</p>
<p>In October, the company teamed up with Bragg Gaming Group to help boost its distribution channels and establish a strong footprint across existing and new markets.</p>
