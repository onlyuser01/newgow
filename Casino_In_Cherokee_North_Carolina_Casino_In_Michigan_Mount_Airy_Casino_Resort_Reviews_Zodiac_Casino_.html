<p>NFL and MLB in High Rankings</p>
<p>Just like the case of other US states that embraced sports betting this year, Kansas also recorded a few spikes in certain sports, leagues, and teams in terms of betting. Among them, we can mention the National Football league with Kansas City Chiefs, Major League basketball with Kansas City Royals, the National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I with the Kansas State Wildcats, and the National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I basketball with the Kansas Jayhawks.</p>
<p>One particular event that caught the attention of a large number of bettors was the Chiefs’ match against the Arizona Cardinals held on September 11, when the Cardinals were blasted by the Chiefs 44-21 during the season opener. The Los Angeles Rams versus the Buffalo Bills was played on September 9 and recorded similarly large numbers of bets. The Buffalo Bills defeated the Super Bowl champions by 31 to 10. The NASCAR races held at the Kansas Speedway also attracted plenty of bets.</p>
<p>Hollywood Casino &amp; Barstool Sports Broke</p>
<p>The 2022 Hollywood Casino 400 Presented by Barstool Sport on September 11 also broke Penn Gaming’s record for a fresh property opening event according to data from the Kansas Lottery. NASAR fans also rejoiced during the much-anticipated 2022 Hollywood Casino 400 presented by Barstool Sportsbook at Kansas Speedway – NASCAR Cup Series event that provided them with even more options for betting. The partnership between Hollywood Casino and Barstool Sports was meant to provide mobile and in-person sportsbook betting experiences to all interested bettors.</p>
<p>Without a doubt, Kansas started off on the right foot and the future is looking brighter than ever. With plenty of upcoming events in line for the following months, the number of sports bets is only expected to keep growing and surpass the record figures in the first ten days of the month. The Kansas Lottery congratulated all winners and expressed its plans to keep promoting the “growth and development of the sports betting platforms” for all players in Kansas.</p>
<p>According to Senate Bill 84, every state-operated casino in the Sunflower State will benefit from in-person sportsbook options and a maximum of three sports betting apps. At the moment, Kansas has four functional casinos.</p>
