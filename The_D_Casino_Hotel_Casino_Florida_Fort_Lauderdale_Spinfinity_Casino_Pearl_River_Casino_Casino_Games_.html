<p>Imagine Dragons’ charitable organization the Tyler Robinson Foundation and the Charity Series of Poker are hosting an event to support families affected by childhood cancer.</p>
<p>Poker Tournament Raises Money for Families Dealing With Pediatric Cancer</p>
<p>2020’s first Charity Series of Poker (CSOP) has been set to take place in Las Vegas on Saturday, January 18. The organization has partnered with the Tyler Robinson Foundation, which was founded by members of the Grammy-award to winning band Imagine Dragons, to host the “Slay Cancer with Poker” event.</p>
<p>Before the Slay Cancer with Poker tournament begins, there will be an open bar reception at 3:30pm. The actual competition will start at 5pm, with a buy-in of $300. Players will be able to purchase $100 re-buys and add-ons – with $1000 in bonuses awarded to the players with the most re-buys and the chip leader by the time registration for the event has ended.</p>
<p>The overall winning over the event will receive a $10,000 entry into the World Series of Poker Main Event in June 2020. All net proceeds from Slay Cancer with Poker will benefit the Tyler Robinson Foundation, which supports of families who are dealing with childhood cancer.</p>
<p>“The mission of the Tyler Robinson Foundation is to strengthen families financially and emotionally as they cope with the tragedy of a pediatric cancer diagnosis by offsetting out-of-pocket expenses” – a statement from the CSOP.</p>
<p>While it has yet to be confirmed whether or not Imagine Dragons themselves will be attending the event, a number of high-profile guests have stated that they are likely to take part. Actors Mekhi Phifer and Kane Hodder are expected to attend, along with WSOP bracelet winner Chris Wallace. Joe Stapleton will be the emcee for the event and CSOP founder Matt Stout will also be attendance.</p>
<p>About the Charity Series of Poker and the Tyler Robinson Foundation</p>
<p>The Charity Series of Poker was established in 2014 and is a non-profit organization that promotes charity poker tournaments that raise money for worthwhile causes. Over the years, the CSOP has raised funds for organizations like Habitat for Humanity, the Folded Flag Foundation, St Jude Children’s Research Hospital, Joe DiMaggio Children’s Hospital, and the Community Food Bank of New Jersey.</p>
<p>The Tyler Robinson Foundation was founded in honor of Tyler Robinson, who was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer called Rhabdomyosarcoma at the age of 16. He had grown close to the members of Imagine Dragons throughout his battle with cancer, and the band established the organization in his memory. Over the years, the charity has raised over $10 million to assist families that have been affected by childhood cancer.</p>
