<p>Merkur Group’s UK subsidiary affirmed the business’ commitment to safer gambling by offering support to the next phase of the Mindful Resilience Programme launched by the Young Gamers and Gamblers Education Trust (YGAM).</p>
<p>Access to Safer Gambling Training</p>
<p>Merkur Group UK announced its support to the program developed by the YGAM in partnership with Bournemouth University and Betknowmore UK during the Mental Health Awareness Week to demonstrate the importance of gambling harm education for health care experts.</p>
<p>“We are delighted to be able to play a small part in helping to fund an initiative that directs resources into helping to address such an important part of the safer gambling narrative.” Sascha Blodau, General Manager, Merkur Group UK</p>
<p>Sascha Blodau continued by outlining the company’s strong belief that “safer gambling goes beyond” its connection with customers and into a broad “commitment” with society as a whole.</p>
<p>A pilot initiative launched in September 2020 and designed to enable health care professionals with access to training related to gambling harm impact on people under the age of 25, the program is a product of the efforts of psychologists, academics, health professionals, and people who have suffered from gambling harm.</p>
<p>“This training connects with the hearts and minds of health professionals, who have a powerful role to play in protecting young people and the vulnerable. We are delighted to play a small part in helping deliver this pilot program.” Sascha Blodau, General Manager, Merkur Group UK</p>
<p>Promoting the National Treatment Network and the NHS for patients who need support, the Mindful Resilience Programme received formal accreditation from the Royal Society for Public Health (RSPH) and was endorsed by the Shadow Minister for Mental Health, Dr. Rosena Alin-Khan MP.</p>
<p>Increase Program’s ‘Reach, Profile, and Impact’</p>
<p>Also commenting on the announcement, YGAM’s director of business development and fundraising Ian Shanahan outlined the importance of the support and commitment expressed by Merkur Group for the program that plays a crucial role in YGAM’s portfolio and is attracting significant interest from the health sector.</p>
<p>“This support will help us continue to grow the initiative to increase its reach, profile and impact,” Shanahan concluded.</p>
<p>Outside of safer gambling, Merkur announced the opening of six new entertainment centers earlier in the month, in Aberdeen, Blackpool, Crawley, Kidderminster, Rayners Lane, and Taunton, in its latest series of entertainment center openings around the country under the Merkur Slots brand.</p>
<p>Focusing on the latest bingo and digital slot machines as part of the emphasis on low stake gaming, the new centers feature an extensive library of new and classic games and offer players unlimited refreshments.</p>
