<p>The leading multimedia content and technology company, offering digital innovative solutions that bring together gaming, sports content and technology, SportsGrid, announced an important senior-level appointment. The company confirmed Tuesday it appointed Greg Topalian, an expert with more than two decades of experience, to its Board of Directors. Joining the C-suite at SportsGrid, he brings a wealth of knowledge along with more than 25 years of experience within business-to-business and fan-based events.</p>
<p>Strengthening its Board of Directors, the company anticipates elevating the experiences it brings for sports fans. Moreover, the appointment complements SportsGrid's plan to deliver unrivaled and engaging experiences for sports fans across the globe.</p>
<p>With Topalian as a part of the company's Board of Directors, the company anticipates growth within the entertainment and sports media vertical. His strategic advice and knowledge are expected to play an important role in the development of new experiences SportsGrid's customers across the globe can benefit from.</p>
<p>Jeremy Stein, SportsGrid's CEO, was excited to see Topalian join the company's Board of Directors. "Greg's impressive career and innovative thinking make him an exceptional addition to our board," he explained in a statement. Finally, Stein said: "His expertise in event creation and passion for delivering exceptional fan experiences align perfectly with our vision for the future of sports content and engagement."</p>
<p>Topalian was similarly thrilled, saying that he was delighted to join the company's Board at such an important moment. "I believe that the convergence of sports, media, and technology is an incredible opportunity, and I look forward to working with the SportsGrid team to shape the future of sports entertainment and lead the way in delivering unforgettable fan experiences," he added.</p>
<p>Back in 2014, Topalian founded the leading company that promises fan-based event experiences, LeftField Media. The company is behind recognizable events such as Awesome Con, Anime NYC and Rose City Comic Con. Back in 2017, the company was acquired by Clarion Events which resulted in Topalian taking on the role of CEO of Clarion Events North America, a company owned by Blackstone, the globally-recognizable asset management company. While Topalian joined SportsGrid's Board of Directors, he continues to hold his role as CEO of Clarion Events North America.</p>
<p>Before LeftField Media, Topalian was a part of Reed Exhibitions. For nearly two decades he played an important role in the company's development.</p>
