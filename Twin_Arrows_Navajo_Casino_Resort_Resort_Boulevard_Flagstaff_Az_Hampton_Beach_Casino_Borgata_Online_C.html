<p>SkillOnNet has expanded its portfolio of games by adding RAW iGaming Group’s product to its offer. As a result, players of partner brands, including PlayUZU, SpinGenie, MegaCasino, PlayOJO, and Slotsstars, among others, will have the opportunity to access the distinct products made available by the company.</p>
<p>SkillOnNet Grows Portfolio with RAW iGaming</p>
<p>This means that SkillOnNet partners can now bring titles such as Ways of the Labyrinth, Ave Caesar, Pearls of Poseidon, Fortune Teller’s Charm, Ali Baba, and the 40 Thieves, and more to their customers by simply tapping into the available titles distributed by the SkillOnNet game lobby.</p>
<p>RAW iGaming focuses on creating innovative, design-driven games that come with the appropriate underpinning technology to make for truly worthwhile iGaming experiences, in the end, featuring balanced payouts and intuitive gameplay. Commenting on this launch, SkillOnNet head of games Jani Kontturi said:</p>
<p>This made the addition of its games an absolute must for us, and we look forward to seeing players across the SkillOnNet network of brands enjoy the thrills its slots have to offer. It is partnerships such as this that ensure we remain a leading operator of award-winning casino brands. SkillOnNet head of games Jani Kontturi</p>
<p>RAW iGaming CEO Tom Wood welcomed the news as well and said that the company was delighted to launch its offer with SkillOnNet. Thanks to this partnership, the company has a chance to launch in multiple markets and access new customers, while benefiting from a simple and highly-efficient distribution model.</p>
<p>Continuing to Grow Across the Globe</p>
<p>SkillOnNet has been seeking to rapidly expand its portfolio of viable choices. In June, the company added Nolimit City, yet another distinguished supplier, and developer of iGaming products, featuring games such as San Quentin, Tombstone R.I.P., xWays, and more.</p>
<p>Last month, SkillOnNet was also cleared to launch in Ontario, Canada, giving all of its partner brands an opportunity to access what is said to be the most important iGaming market in North America.</p>
