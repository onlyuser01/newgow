<p>B2B gaming supplier Push Gaming will be breaking ground in Colombia, teaming up with one of Latin America’s leading iGaming operators, Rivalo. The partnership will be of significance to both entities involved as it would enable Rivalo to expand on its already impressive content that the operator brings to its customers. For Push Gaming, this tie-up is an opportunity to continue connecting with new audiences in new jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Rivalo Helps Push Gaming Launch on Colombian Market</p>
<p>Push Gaming is already supplying some of Europe’s leading brands with industry-leading content, including brands such as Entain, 888, Betsson, Svenska Spel, LeoVegas, and many others.</p>
<p>Push Gaming made the company’s interest in Latin America known a long way ago, but the most recent link-up is another step in consolidating the B2B’s supplier in the region. Besides teaming up with Rivalo, Push Gaming will deliver an amazing variety of games. Big Bamboo and Bison Battle, along with Jammin Jars and Razor Shark are already player-favorite.</p>
<p>Push Gaming is teaming the arrivals of Mad Cars and Deadly5 which are getting final touches before hitting the market as well. Push Gaming is focused on building products that are “player-first,” and as such it will get valuable feedback from its releases and see what the local players enjoy.</p>
<p>Commenting on the partnership, Push Gaming head of sales Fiona Hickey welcomed the opportunity to be working with Rivalo, an established iGaming brand that will help make the Colombian market a more familiar place for Push Gaming. Hickey added:</p>
<p>“This agreement marks the beginning of our expansion in the regulated Colombian market and serves as a precursor to our exciting plans for growth across the Latin American region.” Push Gaming head of sales Fiona Hickey</p>
<p>Thrilled to Be Working with Push Gaming</p>
<p>Rivalo country manager Felipe Agüero said that the company was thrilled to be Push Gaming’s first partner in the market and assured that the Colombian iGaming industry demonstrates a significant potential.</p>
<p>“Our customers appreciate entertainment and engaging features, integrating Push Gaming’s innovative and expansive portfolio of titles into our already existing offering seems like a perfect partnership.” Rivalo country manager Felipe Agüero</p>
<p>Push Gaming has been in the news recently. The company teamed up with Sky Betting and Gaming and it also launched its products with another iGaming brand, Coolbet. The Latin American market remains important for Push Gaming, but the B2B developer and supplier in iGaming content seems confident and committed to its global pivot.</p>
