<p>Sportsbook operator betJACK has donated $20,000 to celebrate the arrival of the regulated gambling market in Ohio and raise brand awareness</p>
<p>The company donated the amount to Special Olympics Ohio as a token of appreciation for local communities and sports, which is part of what operators want to demonstrate when launching betting products in the Buckeye State.</p>
<p>betJACK Commits to Supporting Local Communities in Ohio</p>
<p>betJACK has another advantage as well, as it is the only sportsbook that is headquartered in the state, making its connection to the state more intimate and long-term commitment, more impactful. The local community, says betJACK, is a priority for it.</p>
<p>There is another reason behind the sum allocated to Special Olympics Ohio sitting at $20,000, as betJACK informed that this was the amount placed within two hours of the sports betting launch in the state at midnight on January 1.</p>
<p>Special Olympics Ohio president and CEO Jessica Stewart welcomed the opportunity to work with betJACK and expressed gratitude for the donation. betJACK’s status as the company’s first philanthropic partner is equally important for the organization noted Stewart and added:</p>
<p>These funds will allow our athletes to develop physical fitness, demonstrate courage, experience joy, and share gifts, skills, and friendships. Special Olympics Ohio president and CEO Jessica Stewart</p>
<p>BetJACK is confident in the organization’s long-term mission, which is to provide athletes with the training they deserve. The local branch is part of a global network in which 20,000 athletes from across 88 countries receive the attention and conditions necessary to continue excelling.</p>
<p>Brian Eby, president of JACK Entertainment which owns the betting brand, said that his company believed that its own success depends on doing well by others and the communities it operates in. The betJACK brand operates two sportsbooks in Northeast Ohio and now has state-wide exposure through the dedicated mobile betting brand.</p>
<p>“We will continue to move forward with supporting this mission through the many diverse organizations within our state and look forward to having a positive impact throughout Ohio,” Eby added.</p>
