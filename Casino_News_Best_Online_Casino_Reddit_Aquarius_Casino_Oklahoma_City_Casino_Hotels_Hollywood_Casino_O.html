<p>The global entertainment company, MGM Resorts International, announced that its wholly-owned subsidiary and leading international iGaming company, LeoVegas, entered into an agreement to acquire Push Gaming Holding Limited, a popular game developer. Details about the new acquisition emerged Monday and will see LeoVegas acquire the game developer along with its subsidiaries.</p>
<p>It was last year when MGM Resorts acquired LeoVegas. Now, the leading iGaming company seeks to grow further and the acquisition represents its first major investment.

<p>Becoming a part of LeoVegas, Push Gaming will keep its existing management team. The employees at the leading iGaming provider surpass 100 in headcount and will continue to develop unique and quality titles that are distributed via its remote gaming server and platform, a statement reveals.</p>
<p>Famous for its entertaining and quality games, Push Gaming delivers content for the growing iGaming industry. The company offers a portfolio of content surpassing 30 unique titles. Such games include Big Bamboo, Wild Swarm, Razor Shark and Jammin' Jars, among others. The games are currently available for more than 200 online gambling operators around the world. Now, the acquisition will help further expand the reach of Push Gaming's content.</p>
<p>Gustaf Hagman, LeoVegas' CEO, shared his excitement about the latest acquisition saying that he is thrilled to see Push Gaming join the company's growing family. He added: "The management team at Push Gaming has had a phenomenal journey, quickly growing the company from a small start-up to a player with outstanding proprietary content and a strong customer base." Finally, Hagman said: "We look forward to contributing to their continued success moving forward."</p>
<p>Gary Fritz, MGM Resorts International's Interactive President, was similarly excited about the announced acquisition. He explained: "The acquisition of Push Gaming by LeoVegas is consistent with our vision to expand MGM Resorts' digital gaming presence internationally to grow our capabilities and products over the next several years."</p>
<p>Last but not least, Fritz noted: "We are pleased to bring Push Gaming into our business as it brings a track record of developing games that are popular and have staying power in the industry as well as an exceptional management and operating team."</p>
