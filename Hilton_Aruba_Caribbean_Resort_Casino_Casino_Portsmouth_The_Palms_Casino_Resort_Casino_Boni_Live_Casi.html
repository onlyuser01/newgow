<p>Svenska Spel Sport &amp; Casino has expanded its content offering with products from Slotmill, a respected iGaming and slot developer. The operator is looking to consolidate its footprint in the online casino space by adding more worthwhile titles developed by prominent studios, the latest being Slotmill.</p>
<p>Svenska Spel Doubles Down on Online Casino</p>
<p>Svenska Spel has been pivoting towards the iCasino segment over the past two years, citing the need to make up for land-based closures which strained business. The adoption of more digital gaming products has been fairly well, although Svenska Spel admitted that the year-over-year revenue from the vertical was down.</p>
<p>Despite the recovering land-based sector, Svenska Spel has decided to double down on more iCasino solutions, hoping to keep both segments competitive. If anything, online casinos should be able to come very close to casino results. Meanwhile, Svenska Spel head of online casino Niklas Örtbrant has welcomed the opportunity to be expanding the iCasino portfolio.</p>
<p>He noted that any new supplier that is added to the platform had to meet Svenska Spel’s robust fairness and player protection criteria, which is what Slotmill did.</p>
<p>Slotmill has been on our radar screens for a while and their game portfolio offer both variation and superb player excitement. Svenska Spel head of online casino Niklas Örtbrant</p>
<p>Slotmill CCO Andreas Ternström has welcomed this partnership and said that his company was committed to providing content of the highest quality and that the tie-up with Svenska Spel was an important step forward for the company.</p>
<p>Svenska Spel offers a number of other products that go beyond online gaming as well, including land-based casino products and sports betting.</p>
<p>Svenska Spel Is a Known Name in Sweden</p>
<p>The company has been focusing on developing retail points of sale and presently owns the Casino Cosmopol brand. All the profits from the gaming operations go to the Swedish treasury. Svenska Spel has been a permanent member of the gambling industry in Sweden, and it has doubled down on all sorts of initiatives.</p>
<p>In August, the company confirmed that it will contribute around $3.95 million to help with research into problem gambling. The company also revealed its Elite Sports Scholarship program allocating 50 scholarships to young athletes.</p>
