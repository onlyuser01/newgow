<p>Known for its next-gen crypto sportsbook and casino, Maverick Games is now taking on a new segment, hoping to introduce a groundbreaking poker software</p>
<p>The company has confirmed the arrival of its newest solution that will focus on the vertical and dubbing it a “game-changer” right out the door. According to Maverick Games, this client will offer a 70% rakeback promotion upon signing up and depositing for the first time.</p>
<p>Bringing One of the Biggest Rake in Crypto Poker History</p>
<p>Maverick has argued that this is aligned with its pro-player policy which has established the company as focused on creating value for its players. The company is similarly confident that this new client will offer players excellent social experiences, not only because of the competitive rake opportunities but also owing to the way the platform is built to promote transparency and integrity.</p>
<p>Licensed by the Isle of Man Gambling Supervision Commission, Maverick Games holds this as a hallmark of the care it takes to ensure that consumers can play in a safe and reliable online gaming environment while offering them the added benefit of depositing, playing, and withdrawing in a number of digital currencies.</p>
<p>Commenting on the launch of this new product, Maverick Games director of poker Dan Kent said that he was excited to reveal the latest vertical for the company and offer players a chance to enjoy their favorite game as they have never before. He added:</p>
<p>I have been in the industry for a long time and have always listened to player feedback and taken it on board. All of these learnings have been applied to the Maverick poker product, making it the best in the business. Maverick Games director of poker Dan Kent</p>
<p>A Long Journey to Making the Final Product</p>
<p>Kent reiterated that Maverick Games is fully committed to protecting consumers and offering the highest quality of online gaming products.</p>
<p>He was joined by Maverick Games managing director Kendra Ross who said that the process of building the new poker solution was long but worthwhile. Ross said she was confident that the new poker client would strike home with players right from day one.</p>
<p>“As a crypto gambling brand, it’s also important for us to assure players that we are secure, safe and reputable, and our Isle of Man license allows us to do just that,” she added.</p>
