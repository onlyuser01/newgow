    <h1>The Palms Resort Casino Las Vegas Best Real Money Online Casino Border Inn Casino Jamul Casino Hotel</h1>

<p>IGT will see a number of its player-favorite games now become a part of Ruby Seven’s suite of social casino solutions and apps</p>
<p>Ruby Seven Studios and IGT have reached the agreement on Thursday and the former will now add a number of IGT’s flagship titles to its social casino library, including games such as Wolf Run Eclipse, Wheel of Fortune, and Top Dollar Premium, to name a few.</p>
<p>IGT’s Acclaimed Products Now Power Ruby Seven’s Social Experiences</p>
<p>Ruby Seven allow players to access a variety of products that are branded as “social casino” games, and which are available through a web browser or the company’s dedicated iOS and android apps. All games are played with a mock-up currency which is purchased by players from Ruby Seven and allows them to participate in the games.</p>
<p>No actual profit is realized by the player in real terms outside of the platform’s achievements and distinctions that are limited to the ecosystem. Commenting on this opportunity, Ruby Seven Studios founder and CEO Michael Carpenter said that he was excited to see the company’s product offer increase yet again through the addition of some of the best games by IGT. He added:</p>
<p>This IGT content includes some of the biggest and most popular names in slots, and now our partners will be able to offer it to players in their favorite social casinos. Ruby Seven Studios founder and CEO Michael Carpenter</p>
<p>IGT VP of global licensing and social casino gaming Jennifer Fales was similarly happy to see the partnership take place. Fales noted that the land-based alternatives of the games that will be joining Ruby Seven have enjoyed a strong reception from fans in the vertical. The same should pretty much follow on the social casino platform established by Ruby Seven Studios, Fales added.</p>
<p>Both IGT and Ruby Seven Studios Are Stoked about the Opportunity</p>
<p>She noted that the company was excited to take its experience in the online and land-based verticals and now debut it in the social casino space as well. Ruby Seven also provides its casino platform to a number of land-based properties, including Delaware North Gaming, Fantasy Springs Resort Casino, Mystic Lake Casino Hotel, Pechanga Resort Casino, Eldorado Resort Casino &amp; Tropicana Entertainment, and others.</p>
<p>Ruby Seven Studios remains committed to bridging the gap between land-based, online, and social casino products. The company presently employs 150 professionals and is constantly on the lookout to strike new meaningful content opportunities.</p>
