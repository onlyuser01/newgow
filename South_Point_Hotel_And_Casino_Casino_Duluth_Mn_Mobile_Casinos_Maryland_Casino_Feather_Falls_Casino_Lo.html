<p>3 Oaks Gaming, one of the biggest distributors of iGaming content, has announced a new partnership with Slots City. As a result, the latter partner will now have access to 3 Oaks Gaming’s extensive portfolio of content. Slots City, which is based in Ukraine, will tap into a library of online slots that are readily available to 3 Oaks Gaming clients as part of the company’s powerful distribution solution.</p>
<p>3 Oaks Gaming Teams up with Slots City</p>
<p>Some of the games to be available to Slots City moving forward include Big Heist, The King of Heroes, and Eggs of Gola. All of this and more player-favourite content will be gradually rolled out with Slots City over the coming months. It’s also the latest commercial partnership for 3 Oaks Gaming which is determined to continue reaching out to new operators with its high-quality product portfolio.</p>
<p>Commenting on this new opportunity, 3 Oaks Gaming managing director Sebastian Damian welcomed the opportunity to be teaming up with Slots City, an emerging European operator in his words. He was thrilled to have the opportunity to increase the supplier’s expansion and continue to reach new audiences.</p>
<p>“Our offering of immersive, innovative slots is constantly expanding, and we relish the opportunity to offer them to an increasing number of players,” Damian noted. 3 Oaks Gaming has been keen to grow its European footprint as recent events have shown. The company received an official go-ahead from the Bulgarian National Revenue Agency and obtained the necessary license to supply its iGaming content on the market.</p>
<p>3 Oaks Gaming also launched its new jackpot product just earlier this month. The supplier remains a force to reckon with in the European iGaming market and is committed to expanding its footprint a notch further.</p>
