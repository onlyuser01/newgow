<p>Sundayâ€™s NFL action wraps up with the Baltimore Ravens vs Cincinnati Bengals Wild Card game. Check out our Ravens at Bengals prediction below</p>
<p>The two AFC North foes have met twice this season, with each team winning once. Their first duel saw Lamar Jackson leading the Ravens to a 19-17 win. However, he missed the second duel due to injury â€“ and his team lost 27-16 in Week 18.</p>
<p>Itâ€™s a big question mark on whether heâ€™ll return on Sunday. If he does, his teamâ€™s chances are bound to improve, but will it be enough for the Ravens to beat the last yearâ€™s AFC champions?</p>

<p>All Eyes on Lamar</p>
<p>It was December 4 when Lamar Jackson suffered a knee injury. He hasnâ€™t practiced in six weeks, so even if he returns on Sunday, he probably wonâ€™t be at his best. However, many believe that even unfit, Jackson is a much better option than backup Anthony Brown.</p>
<p>Brown had a game to forget the last time his team took on the Bengals. In Week 18, we saw him for 19/44 for 286 yards, no touchdowns, and two interceptions. Meanwhile, in the first Ravens vs Bengals game of the season (Week 5), we saw Jackson go 19/32 for 174 yards, one touchdown, and one interception, while also making 12 carries for 58 yards.</p>
<p>look at this</p>
<p>2021:</p>
<p>start season 8-3 with healthy Lamar</p>
<h1>3 seed in AFC</h1>
<p>ðŸ¤•Lamar injuredðŸ¤•</p>
<p>Ravens lose out</p>
<p>fall to 8-9</p>
<p>2022:</p>
<p>start season 8-4 with healthy Lamar</p>
<h1>3 seed in AFC</h1>
<p>ðŸ¤•Lamar injuredðŸ¤•</p>
<p>Ravens lose half their games</p>
<p>fall to 10-6</p>

<p>Lamarâ€™s return would almost certainly give a boost to the Ravens, but in order to win, his teammates would need to step up as well. Baltimoreâ€™s defense conceded 27 points in the final game of the regular season â€“ their worse performance since Week 12.</p>
<p>Truth be told, they werenâ€™t too bad in that game. Itâ€™s just that the Bengalsâ€™ offense was brilliant. A week later, the two meet again, but will Joe Burro &amp; Co. do the same again?</p>
<p>Bengals Eying Their 9th Straight Win</p>
<p>After a rocky start to the season, the Cincinnati Bengals entered a fantastic run that saw them win nine games in a row. They ended the regular season with a 12-4 record after their duel with the Buffalo Bills was scraped due to the Damar Hamlin situation. If that game had gone as planned and they won, theyâ€™d finish the season as the no.3 seed.</p>
<p>This way, they finished third, which isnâ€™t that bad. Otherwise, theyâ€™d have to play against the Miami Dolphins in the Wild Card game. And the Dolphins look stronger than the Ravens at the moment.</p>
<p>Still, regardless of the opponent, the Bengals have high hopes for the 2023 Playoffs. Theyâ€™re playing top football right now, especially in the offense. Their quarterback Joe Burrow has been nothing short of sensational over the last couple of weeks, completing 68.2% of his passes in the past five games, while recording 12 TD passes along the way.</p>
<p>Baltimore Ravens vs Cincinnati Bengals Prediction</p>
<p>With or without Lamar Jackson on the field, the Ravens offense isnâ€™t great. Their defense is much better, but still not good enough to stop in-form Joe Burrow. That said, we can see no other scenario but another blowout win for the Bengals.</p>
<p>Picks: Cincinnati Bengals to win and cover the spread; under to hit</p>
