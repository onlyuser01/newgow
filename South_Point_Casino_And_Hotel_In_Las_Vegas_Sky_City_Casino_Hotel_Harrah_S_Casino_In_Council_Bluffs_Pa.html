<p>The man claimed his prize a few days later, which is when he disclosed that he was a regular lottery player who would often buy tickets in bulk</p>
<p>Against all reason, a Chinese man put all of his eggs in the same basket, buying over 50,000 lottery tickets and entering the same numbers on all of them. Fortunately for him, his combination turned out to be a winning one, netting him millions of dollars.</p>
<p>The player, who preferred to remain anonymous, is a resident of Nanchang. The man described himself as a regular lottery player who would often invest thousands of Yuan in lottery tickets. Believed to have spent as much as a million throughout his five years of playing, the man has finally struck gold.</p>
<p>According to reports, the player visited many shops across Nanchang, buying out all available Happy 8 tickets and putting the same numbers on all of them. In total, the man bought over 50,000 tickets, entering the following combination on each single one: 40, 41, 42, 44, 63, 64 and 65.</p>
<p>When this combination secured a prize of CNY 4,475 (roughly $628), all of the tickets became winners. As a result, he scooped a grand total of around $30 million.</p>
<p>The man claimed his prize a few days later, which is when he disclosed that he was a regular lottery player who would often buy tickets in bulk.</p>
<p>Skeptical Social Media Users Suggested a Conspiracy</p>
<p>The news quickly became viral on Chinese social media. While some were happy about the man, many thought that something must be going on. The confidence with which the man spent thousands of Yuan on lottery tickets caused many to be suspicious of his win.</p>
<p>Many people were skeptical and questioned the legitimacy of the win, thinking that it might have been a part of some fix. Some suggested that the player might have had insider information that helped him enter the correct combination and take hundreds of millions of Yuan home.</p>
<p>Certain people went as far as suggesting that the situation might have been set up by the Chinese government as a way to channel people toward the lottery. However, the Chinese Welfare Lottery did not report the case officially, which may be proof that the win was genuine.</p>
