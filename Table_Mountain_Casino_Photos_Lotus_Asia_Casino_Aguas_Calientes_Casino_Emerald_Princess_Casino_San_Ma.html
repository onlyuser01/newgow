<p>International Game Technology PLC has revealed that it has won a tender with the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation and that, moving forward, the company’s IGT Global Solutions Corporation will become the primary provider of self-serve lottery terminals for the organization.</p>
<p>Self-Serve Lottery Terminals Coming to Ontario</p>
<p>This agreement is in fact the first self-serve technology that will be delivered to players in Ontario and the OLG, making it an important milestone in the history of gaming in the province. It will considerably increase the opportunities for players.</p>
<p>The contract is signed for a period of five years and will run through June 2027, with the option to sign up for a ten-year extension. Each extension will be revisited on annual basis and be negotiated for a term of one year, providing that all parties are satisfied with the results and achievements.</p>
<p>Once a final government approval is granted, IGT is expected to begin installing these self-serve kiosks in the first half of 2023. OLG President and CEO Duncan Hannay has welcomed this opportunity and assured us that it’s the right step for the company.</p>
<p>Hannay explained that this partnership was the next step for lottery play in the province and that IGT is fully capable of delivering responsible, convenient, and secure solutions that favor players interested in lottery games. He continued:</p>
<p>The introduction of self-serve lottery technology throughout Ontario would allow us to continue to drive sales and maximize revenue for provincial priorities for the benefit of the people of Ontario. OLG President and CEO Duncan Hannay</p>
<p>The news was similarly welcomed by IGT COO for global lottery Jay Gendron who said that the company was thrilled to be teaming up with the OLG and have the opportunity to bring its advanced self-serve lottery terminals to this jurisdiction for the first time.</p>
<p>Further Additions Coming Down the Road</p>
<p>OLG remains the biggest lottery in Canada and as such, it’s an important commercial success for the supplier as well. For its part, OLG is determined to continue innovating the experience and create new experiences and opportunities for players. Under the terms of the deal, OLG is preparing to provide IGT with 1400 GameTouch 28 self-serve lottery terminals, that will be delivered to retailers across the province.</p>
<p>More self-serve terminals may be delivered as the deal continues to unfold, and are subject to review. The GameTouch Draw terminal could also be added at a letter stage, along with more solutions. In the meantime, IGT will help OLG facilitate the management of the new tech by using the dedicated OpenRetail terminal software to manage the new additions.</p>
