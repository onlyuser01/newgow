<p>Floyd Mayweather Agrees to Unretire Again, But Only for $600M Guarantee</p>

<p>Since finishing his career for a third time in 2017 by defeating Conor McGregor in a cross-over boxing match, the undefeated 50-0 GOAT has been the subject of many rumors regarding another potential fight. Rematches with Manny Pacquiao and McGregor were both floated. But the latest – and seemingly likeliest matchup – is fighting UFC superstar Khabib Nurmagomedov.</p>
<p>Nurmagomedov is a perfect 28-0 in mixed martial arts, with eight knockouts, 10 submissions, and 10 decisions. Like the 2017 spectacle against McGregor, Nurmagomedov has never boxed professionally.</p>
<p>The hypothetical matchup would presumably generate hundreds of millions of dollars in pay-per-view buys, gate revenue, and sports betting handle. But the only way Mayweather agrees to participate is if he receives the bulk of the money.</p>
<p>Big Demands</p>
<p>Mayweather says he’s now first and foremost a businessman. And anything he does, well, he better get paid.</p>
<p>“For myself, the number is $600 million,” Mayweather told The Mirror. “If I’m going to go out there and risk it, it’d have to be worth it.”</p>
<p>He added, “I’m a businessman. If it makes money, it makes sense.”</p>
<p>Khabib revealed recently that he’s been offered $100 million to fight in Saudi Arabia. And he would be willing to take on Mayweather, but with one specific condition.</p>
<p>Mayweather is a very big name. And right now, I have a big name, too. We can fight but we need 11 rounds of boxing and one round of MMA. Let’s go,” Nurmagomedov declared.</p>
<p>Odds have not yet been released on the potential fight.</p>
<p>Mayweather Fortune</p>
<p>Forbes says Floyd Mayweather was the highest-paid athlete of the 2010-2019 decade, with his earnings totaling $915 million. That eclipses such superstars as Lionel Messi ($750 million), LeBron James ($680 million), and Roger Federer ($640 million).</p>
<p>However, Mayweather’s estimated net worth is said to be around $550 million. Rapper 50 Cent, no friend of Floyd’s after a falling out with the boxer, claims Mayweather is actually broke.</p>
<p>“It’s fight, get the money, spend the money, fight,” 50 Cent told New York City radio station Hot 97. “With the lifestyle, that money’s gone. Trust me. It’s like if you call him, he’ll be at your local nightclub because he needs that action right now.”</p>
<p>Mayweather has long been a notorious gambler. While he shows off his winning bets on social media, many question the losses he doesn’t flaunt. A new report from online website Sportscasting this week alleges the boxer’s gambling habits have put a serious dent in his overall net worth.</p>
<p>Floyd claimed in 2014 to have put $13 million on the Denver Broncos winning Super Bowl XLVIII. The team lost to the Seattle Seahawks.</p>
<p>In 2017, Mayweather asked the US Internal Revenue Service for a temporary reprieve from an unpaid tax bill stemming from 2015. The IRS said he owed $29 million in back taxes. Mayweather asked the government to give him time to collect on his McGregor payout. The IRS obliged, and was later reportedly paid.</p>
