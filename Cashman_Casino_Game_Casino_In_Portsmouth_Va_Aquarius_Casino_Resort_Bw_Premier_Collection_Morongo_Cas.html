<p>The leading mobile-first games provider, Hacksaw Gaming, entered the United States for the first time after being awarded a license in West Virginia.</p>
<p>Hacksaw Awarded Provisional License in West Virginia</p>
<p>The company revealed on Monday it was granted a provisional license in West Virginia. This marks the first major step for Hacksaw Gaming on its way to expanding into the growing US regulated gambling market. In fact, the company revealed its plans to go live in the US in the first quarter of next year. The launch is expected to be facilitated via the company’s deal with Light &amp; Wonder.</p>
<p>“We have an exciting strategy for the US and our team is focused on delivering yet more excellent and memorable products to delight that market.“ Christine Bordeaux, SVP of compliance North America at Hacksaw Gaming</p>
<p>Christine Bordeaux, the SVP of compliance North America at Hacksaw, said that expanding in the US is a part of the company’s ambitious growth strategy. At the same time, she explained that Hacksaw’s dedicated team of professionals remains focused on offering unique experiences via the company’s leading products.</p>
<p>“Being granted this license is testimony to the quality of our games portfolio and shows just how robust and engaging our content is.“ Marcus Cordes, CEO at Hacksaw Gaming</p>
<p>Marcus Cordes, Hacksaw’s CEO, deemed the recent provisional license as the first step toward the company’s major expansion in the country. He pointed out that the license reaffirms the quality of Hacksaw’s content and the engaging experiences it offers. Cordes added that the recent license in West Virginia comes on the heels of the company’s licensing in Romania, as well as the Isle of Man from earlier this year. Finally, he explained that this year was stellar for the company.</p>
<p>“This latest expansion comes after our license approvals in Romania and the Isle of Man earlier in 2022, so we’re finishing the year just as strongly as we started it,“ added Cordes</p>
<p>The Company Continues Its North American Expansion</p>
<p>With more states legalizing sports betting and casino gambling, the latest move doesn’t come as a surprise. What’s more, Hacksaw’s license comes after regulated gambling operators in West Virginia reported 60% growth last month when compared to October last year.</p>
<p>While this is Hacksaw’s first license in the US, it isn’t the first one for the company in North America. Back in May 2022, Hacksaw was granted a license in Ontario, Canada’s most populous province. Consequently, in October Hacksaw inked a deal with Loto-Québec. Under the terms of the deal, the company agreed to provide the state-run corporation with iGaming content. For Loto-Québec, the collaboration meant expanding its online casino offering. On the other hand, for Hacksaw, the deal marked an important step in the company’s expansion plans for North America.</p>
