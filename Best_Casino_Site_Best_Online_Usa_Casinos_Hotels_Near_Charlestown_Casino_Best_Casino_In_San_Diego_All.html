    <h1>Best Casino Site Best Online Usa Casinos Hotels Near Charlestown Casino Best Casino In San Diego All</h1>

<p>Greetings all,</p>
<p>I am sorry for the delayed reply (vacation).</p>
<p>Dear Rocketpot Casino Team,</p>
<p>The previous post was just an automatically added response by our system while I was out of the office. Please, take it as irrelevant.</p>
<p>Not all information was provided at all. There were a few questions that were asked several times, and we have not received relevant answers to them so far.</p>
<p>Although you claim that these questions are irrelevant, I dare to disagree. The situation and our attitude were explained outside this thread. According to our Fair Gambling Codex (available HERE), it is not alright to use a rule against multiple accounts without further explanation and reasoning. It is not enough for confiscation of the player's winnings/balance. So, can you please answer these unanswered questions?</p>
<p>"Did the player breach any other of the casino's Terms and Conditions? Was any bonus used to obtain the disputed (frozen) winnings? If yes, what bonus was used? What (unfair) advantage did the player gain by playing in this way? What type of games did the player play in the casino most often? Were the players in question able to verify themselves?</p>
<p>Could you please also substantiate your claims with the relevant data/evidence?"</p>
<p>The provided data showed us that at least 2 accounts were used on the same device. However, now we need to know the circumstances and details to sufficiently evaluate the legitimacy of the confiscated winnings as well as the casino's decision.</p>
<p>In case the casino is not willing and able to provide us with the requested information, I am afraid we will be forced to close the complaint as unresolved.</p>
