<p>Paris Saint-Germain Dreaming of the UCL Trophy</p>
<p>Last season, PSG reached the Round of 16 of the Champions League, where they got stopped by Real Madrid, who then went on to win the trophy. This time, the Parisians have much higher ambitions. They want to win the 2022-23 Champions League, which is why you can be 100% certain theyâ€™re going to go all-in against Bayern Munich on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Thereâ€™s one thing that should worry them ahead of the PSG vs Bayern Munich game. Several of their key men are struggling with fitness ahead of the UCL game. Among those are Kylian Mbappe, Neymar, Renato Sanchez, and several others.</p>
<p>On the bright side for PSG, Lionel Messi is 100% fit and ready to give his utmost. The Argentine GOAT is in top form right now and everyone is expecting to see even more from him in the near future.</p>
<p>In-Form Bayern Munich Ready to Conquer Paris</p>
<p>Bayern Munich are playing amazing soccer since the end of the World Cup break. Theyâ€™re great in all aspects of the game, including defense. The reason why this is kind of surprising is that goalkeeper Manuel Neuer suffered a season-ending injury on a skiing trip after the Qatar tournament.</p>
<p>To solve the problem between the posts, Bayern Munich signed former Borussia Monchengladbach goalie Yann Sommer. Although he did concede five goals in his first five games with Bayern, he does have a safe pair of hands. Still, we canâ€™t say that heâ€™s as good as Neuer.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Bayern also have problems with injuries among their defenders. Dayot Upamecano, Noussair Mazraoui, and Lucas Hernandez are struggling with fitness and will probably miss Tuesdayâ€™s game.</p>
<p>PSG vs Bayern Munich Prediction</p>
<p>Our prediction for the PSG vs Bayern UCL game is that weâ€™re going to witness a goal galore. Both teams are way better in the offense than at the back, so anything but three or four goals on Tuesday would be a major surprise.</p>
<p>But whoâ€™s going to win this game? With Messi in top shape, we think PSG can beat anyone, Bayern included.</p>
<p>Picks: PSG to win &amp; over 2.5 goals</p>
