    <h1>Casino Mobile Margaritaville Casino Hotel Bossier Casino In Monte Carlo Dress Code 2023 Pala Casino</h1>

<p>I deposit ETransfer $50 and another $90 and this money went directly into their account.</p>
<p>So I waited to be credited usually u get credit right away but I wait for 1 hour nothing then I waited more and nothing so I looked on my bank and it said it was sent so I contact their support line and wow they don't know where my money went.</p>
<p>They ask for the reference number which I gave and they still can't find my money. Then they wrote to me that I will get it back within 5-7 days! Hmmm it's been more than 5-7 days the money was sent on the 9th of march it's now 21st of march so I asked could u give me a date when I will receive it!</p>
<p>They didnt even answer my question but to say they want my bank statement ???? Mm why? I am not borrowing money!! What is going on here? Now this is getting too much where is my money???</p>
<p>With the reference number they should be able to track my money so I provided them with my bank statement but I blacked out everything that is not related and I only left where it said they took $50 and $90 and I didn't black out money going I to my account so they can see that I did not get it back.</p>
<p>Then they wrote no u have to unblack the statement.</p>
<p>I contacted my bank telling them this and they said not to do that and it sounds like I got scammed. And they said they got the money DIRECT I to their account meaning they could easily look me up by reference number, name, or even email.</p>
<p>So it's really odd that they are asking me of this; only when you borrow money u must show this; but I AM NOT borrowing money. So I said no my bank said I should not do this and where is my money. Then they said there is nothing we can do to investigate more.</p>
<p>So where is my money this is not okay to take someone hard working money and ask for personal info when a reference number is all u need. Super odd. I GOT SCAMMED. But I will not stop fighting for what is mine. I will not just let this go. This is such a headache but I will be fighting for what is mine.</p>
<p>like my transaction are personal i will not show anyone what i buy and do thats my business my bank said its a scam and i am freaking out as i never been scammed before.</p>
<p>could someone tell me what to do i send them this</p>
