    <h1>Coral Casino Hard Rock Online Casino Rivers Casino 4 Fun Pittsburgh Hilton Ponce Golf And Casino Res</h1>

<p>Thank you very much for submitting a complaint through our website.</p>
<p>Based on the T&amp;C, the casino has the right to change or withhold any game whenever they decide to do so. If I understand it correctly you were able to open this game and play it while winning nice money. Then you attempted to request withdrawal in casino cashier but your withdrawal was from some reason rejected. After that you continued to play and lost. If this is how it happened then from our perspective these losses are legitimate. The fact that game was accessible even if it shouldn't be (due to an error in casino software) doesn't make your losses illegitimate and thus you are not eligible for any refund. Please correct me if I understood something wrong.</p>
<p>Regards, Matej</p>
