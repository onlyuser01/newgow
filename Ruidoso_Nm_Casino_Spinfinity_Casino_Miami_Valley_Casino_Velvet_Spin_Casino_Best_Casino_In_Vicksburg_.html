    <h1>Ruidoso Nm Casino Spinfinity Casino Miami Valley Casino Velvet Spin Casino Best Casino In Vicksburg</h1>

<p>I signed up to cafe casino in October. Made a couple of deposits lost money everything is ok you loose at casinos about three deposits all losses it's ok I still like the game veriety, so let me keep it short and simple there's a 100$ bonus for every referral to new depositing customer your refer , on the next family even on October 19th my grand daughter stayed over so she was interested in joining so I got this referral bonus she signed up and I got the 100$ bonus with 50Ã— wager requirements I thought there no way I can wager this but who cares let me have fun with it turns out I hit big on a few games and my balance was now 5,900 finished the wager now after a night of sleepless gambling I finally wager the correct amount I have 3,800. I take a nap I woke up and try to sign in only to see thaty account disabled and removed a email that my account was disabled and going into investigation, I contact them no info to why this happen just needs to bw verified and evrthing is ok . I went thru 30 days of contacting them I sent in my documents I was verified correctly now so what's the problem , on November 10 I get and email that I have been a bonus abuser and all my winnings were took from me but I can still have my account back , like everything was done by properly oh aand get this my grandkids account got shut down and she didn't even receive her deposit back now she's over hear giving me crap for inviting her to a scam casino , ira ridiculous how they can be licensed and be stealing people's money, at this point I lost it sent them a few rude messages I mean who wouldn't, so then after their decision I can no longer make calls to them like they blocked me , I send messeges just to get automated messages saying their have a high volume of people ahead to reach at a different time this casino to s it's coatomers but leaves your account open , i made thos complaint just so people are aware nor to use that bonus at all they are ok if you deposite and loose tour cash just dont ever win cauae thats. When there is a problem</p>
