<p>The new office location complements BETBY's growth and represents an important part of its expansion strategy</p>
<p>The innovative sportsbook supplier, BETBY, expanded its global footprint by opening a new office located in Barcelona, Spain. The new office location comes at a time when the company anticipates increasing its workforce exponentially and growing further on a global scale. On Thursday, BETBY confirmed that opened its new Barcelona office, complementing its European footprint.</p>
<p>The new office marks a milestone moment in the company’s ambitious expansion strategy. So far, BETBY has seen a successful year, expanding its presence and increasing its headcount. By now, the company has more than 100 employees and it will continue increasing its headcount throughout 2023 and beyond.</p>
<p>Leonid Pertsovskiy, BETBY’s CEO, highlighted the importance of the new Barcelona office. He said that the company is delighted to expand further its global footprint and explained that the new office location is a part of its growth plan.</p>
<p>Moreover, Pertsovskiy praised Barcelona, saying that the beautiful city is home to passionate sports fans and bettors. Finally, BETBY’s CEO pointed out: “The site will strongly focus on artificial intelligence, machine learning, and innovative technologies in sports technology and betting, and we are excited for our latest location to become our brand’s research and development hub.”</p>
<p>“The new office is the latest step in our ambitious growth plans, and we couldn’t be happier to have a hub in such a beautiful city that is full of passionate sports betting fans.“ Leonid Pertsovskiy, CEO at BETBY</p>
<p>The Company Continues to Expand</p>
<p>The news about BETBY’s new office comes on the heels of an important partnership announced by the company. Early last month, the company confirmed it joined forces with NuxGame, the leading gambling platform provider that offers a plethora of casino-style games.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the partnership, BETBY agreed to provide NuxGame with its leading proprietary solutions. While this partnership helped strengthen NuxGame’s operations, it also helped expand the reach of the innovative sportsbook supplier.</p>
<p>Barcelona has established itself as a leading hub for the gaming sector, thanks to the SBC Summit Barcelona, one of the most-anticipated events for the sector. This year’s SBC Summit Barcelona is scheduled to take place between September 19 and September 21, 2023, attracting some of the most recognized gaming, sports and entertainment providers, as well as industry stakeholders.</p>
<p>It’s no surprise that BETBY won’t miss the prestigious event for the gambling industry. The company confirmed that it will showcase its products at stand SB712.</p>
