    <h1>Excalibur Hotel Casino Resort Horseshoe Casino Bossier City Doubledown Casino Free Coins Heart Of Ve</h1>

<p>US casino giant Caesars Entertainment announced plans this week to expand its operations at Indiana Grand Racing &amp; Casino in a $32.5 million investment to affirm its commitment to the Hawkeye State.</p>
<p>“This investment at Indiana Grand is a testament to our continued commitment to Indiana.” Anthony Carano, President and COO, Caesars Entertainment</p>
<p>WSOP Room and More Casino Floor Space</p>
<p>The new investment is set to enhance the current casino gaming floor by adding approximately 25,000 square feet to the north end of the casino to make room for additional 100 slot machines and 25 table games.</p>
<p>“Since the implementation of table games in early 2020, we have looked forward to expanding our gaming operations.” Mike Rich, SVP and General Manager, Indiana Grand</p>
<p>Around 5,000 of the total square feet at the casino facility located in Shelbyville, Indiana will be allocated to a World Series of Poker (WSOP) room, featuring 20 poker tables and offering players exciting pathways to qualify for WSOP land-based tournaments including the Main Event in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>“This growth will allow us to accommodate more guests and add more talented Team Members to the Indiana Grand family, and with the addition of a state-of-the-art Poker Room, we will expand our casino offerings to include some of the most notable programs in the United States, including World Series of Poker.” Mike Rich, SVP and General Manager, Indiana Grand</p>
<p>Video Poker Bar</p>
<p>The expansion which is set to create around 100 new jobs and generate millions to the local and state budgets will also include a 20-seat video poker bar with 65” LCD overhead screens and new design elements throughout the gaming floor. The property will also build a new surface parking, Caesars’ preliminary plans outlined.</p>
<p>“We are dedicated to enhancing and upgrading our operations at all of our locations, and we’re excited to start on several new phases of renovation and expansion in Shelbyville.” Anthony Carano, President and COO, Caesars Entertainment</p>
<p>Work on the expansion is planned to begin April 1, 2021 by Wilhelm Construction of Indianapolis, while the whole renovation should complete by the end of the year.</p>
<p>Caesars Entertainment indicated in the press release that the company is preparing new hospitality, entertainment and culinary offering for its patrons, subject to gaining approvals from city authorities and the Indiana Gaming Commission (IGC).</p>
<p>In December last year, Caesars Entertainment entered into a definitive agreement with its tribal partner from North Carolina, the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians (EBCI), for the sale of operations at Caesars Southern Indiana for $250 million as part of its consolidation efforts in the state and nationwide.</p>
