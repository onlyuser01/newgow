    <h1>Lakeside Hotel Casino Caesars Casino Boomtown Casino Bossier City Lucky Red Casino Login World Casin</h1>

<p>This is completely wrong. I never been able to complete the first step which was to accept the self exlude request of September 15 for a 24h period since the link was only sending error codes/not doing anything. I also never received a second email to confirm my request for a permanent self-exclude because I believe I never been able to complete the first Step.</p>
<ol>
<li>To initiate the Self-Exclusion procedure the player must login into his account and request the Self-Exclusion on "Preferences" under the "Settings" menu;</li>
</ol>
<p><em>YES I DID EXACTLY THAT.</em></p>
<ol>
<li>After requesting the Self-Exclusion, the player will receive an e-mail requesting to confirm the Self- Exclusion request;</li>
</ol>
<p><em>YES I RECEIVED</em></p>
<ol>
<li>After confirming the Self-Exclusion request, the player account will be placed under a 24-hour ban;</li>
</ol>
<p><em>I NEVER BEEN ABLE TO COMFIRM AND I NEVER GOT A 24HOURS BAN</em></p>
<ol>
<li>During the 24 hours ban, the player will receive a 2nd email from Stake.com requesting to identify the time of the Self-Exclusion or if the player wants to self-exclude permanently.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>NEVER GOT THE 24H BAN + I NEVER EVER RECEIVED SO SECOND EMAIL FROM YOU</em></p>
<ol>
<li>After confirming the temporary or permanent Self-Exclusion request, Stake.com will proceed accordingly and block the account immediately.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>COULD NOT HAPPEN SINCE I COULDNT COMPLETE STEP 3</em></p>
<p>It happens that in this case, the player did not comply with the procedure described above. RIGHT IT DIDNT WORK.</p>
<p>The player requested the Self-Exclusion on 15th Sempember 2022 and confirmed the same through e-mail. WRONG I NEVER COMFIRMED??</p>
<p>However, the player never answered the 2nd e-mail sent by Stake.com requesting to identify if he wanted a temporary or permanent Self-Exclusion. WRONG I NEVER RECEIVED A SECOND EMAIL.</p>
<p>The fact that the player never replied to Stake.com second e-mail, did not made it possible to finish the Self-Exclusion procedure and originated the unblocking of the player's account after the 24 hours ban. I CANT REPLY IF I NEVER RECEIVED THE SECOND EMAIL AND FIRST OF ALL NEVER GOT THE 24HOURS BAN.</p>
<p>Ive tried alot of time to do you STEP #1. For the 24hours request. As the two screenshots says. If I was trying to accept the link in my email it was saying <em>error your token expired</em>. So then I was trying to ask for a new link/email and it was saying <em>self exclude already been asked</em>.</p>
<p>I dont know how you can say it’s my fault since I’m 100% sure you can check your informations on your side and realize that first, I never got banned for any 24hours. And second, you can for sure see that you guys has never ever sent me the second email to confirm the permanent self exlcude.</p>
<p>I knew really well the steps I had to complete from 1 to 5 that you just said earlier. But sadly I never been able to complete the #3 since your website gives only error codes.</p>
<p>You know what? Just proove me that you that you guys has sent me the second email that you said earlier and I close the case, just proove me that. If you said it and was so sure about it it should be easy to send us a proof? Otherwise if you cant proove it you might realise you guys are the one missing few steps.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
