<p>The engaging new feature is expected to elevate the thrill and experiences for bettors and basketball fans</p>
<p>The leading sports-tech entertainment company, FanDuel Group, announced the launch of two new features, strengthening significantly its basketball offerings. The company said Thursday that it introduced its new product innovation called “The Pulse” along with a new feature called NBA League Pass.</p>
<p>The new NBA League Pass feature builds upon FanDuel’s successful partnership with the National Basketball Association (NBA). Previously, the sportsbook was named the official sports betting partner of the Association. Ultimately, the new features seek to elevate the experiences for basketball fans and bettors alike, offering options for wagering on out-of-market games as well as betting on key moments in real-time.</p>
<p>Between October 19 and October 26, new users will be able to access three complimentary months of NBA League Pass as well as $200 in Bonus Bets as long as they register and place a $5 wager. NBA League Pass can also be accessed by existing customers of the sportsbook that wager $5 on the NBA. Basketball fans who are currently a part of the NBA’s global membership program, NBA ID, can tap into exciting unique benefits, FanDuel explained. The latest announcement designated FanDuel as the only US betting operator that offers NBA League Pass.</p>
<p>The Sportsbook Is Committed to Offering Unrivaled Experiences</p>
<p>In addition to NBA League Pass, the betting operator uncovered details regarding its new curated experience, The Pulse. According to FanDuel, the new feature is available via its homepage icon Live Now for some of the most popular basketball games. “As the action unfolds, new bets will be added to the feed in a narrative-driven format, offering fans a simple and streamlined path to discover what is happening in a game in real-time,” reveals FanDuel. This innovative feature is expected to further propel the experiences for basketball fans and bettors alike, granting them more betting options.</p>
<p>“FanDuel is committed to offering the top sportsbook product on the market and elevating the entertainment experience for fans this NBA season.“ Mike Raffensperger, chief commercial officer at FanDuel</p>
<p>Mike Raffensperger, FanDuel’s chief commercial officer, explained that the company remains committed to offering unrivaled experiences thanks to its new products for fans of basketball. He explained that FanDuel is thrilled to leverage its successful partnership with the NBA and deliver unique moments and entertaining experiences for basketball fans.</p>
