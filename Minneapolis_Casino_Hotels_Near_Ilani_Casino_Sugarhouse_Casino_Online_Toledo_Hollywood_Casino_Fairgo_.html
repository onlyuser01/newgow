<p>Genius Sports has officially expanded its live-streaming partnership with the Czech-based sportsbook Tipsport. With this development, the latter will gain access to Genius Sports’ LiveTrading, PreMatch, Streaming and LiveTrading solutions across thousands of events that are taking place each year.</p>
<p>The Two Parties Began Working Together in 2016</p>
<p>Tipsport and Genius Sports began working together in 2016, which is something that Jack Davison, the CCO at Genius Sports, acknowledged. He stated that both parties have been working closely ever since and during their time together, Genius Sports supplied Tipsport with a growing suite of betting products.</p>
<p>Davison concluded by saying that Genius Sports is excited to have such a crucial role in powering Tipsport’s first-class sportsbook.</p>
<p>Apart from the LiveTrading, PreMatch, Streaming and LiveTrading solutions, Genius Sports agreed to deliver low latency streams and boost Tipsport’s betting markets. Some of the competitions which will be supplied by Genius Sports’ real-time feeds and pricing include NCAA Basketball, NFL, Euroleague and the EPL.</p>
<p>Tipsport will have access to the proprietary Next Gen Stats, real-time statistics and sports betting data feed. Finally, Tipsport bettors will be provided with an enhanced live betting experience thanks to live streams of top-tier soccer leagues in Iceland, China, Argentina and Colombia. FIBA basketball and FIVB volleyball competitions will also be included.</p>
<p>Petr Komarek, Tipsport’s head of data &amp; streaming, shared his thoughts on the contract extension. He stated that constant innovation is part of Tipsport’s DNA and that is why the company is more than happy to expand its partnership with Genius Sports.</p>
<p>He added that both parties share a “strong bond” and that is why everyone at Tipsport is excited to have the necessary tools through which the engagement with bettors will increase. Komarek ended by saying that Tipsports looks forward to creating unique and compelling projects with Genius Sports.</p>
<p>Genius Sports Had a Strong Q1 and Looks to Expand Its Influence</p>
<p>So far, 2022 proved to be quite strong for Genius Sports and the claim is proven by the company’s Q1 report. In the first quarter of 2022, Genius Sports managed to generate almost $86 million in revenue, which is an increase of around 60% compared to the first quarter of 2021.</p>
<p>Additionally, the first quarter of 2021 had an adjusted negative EBITDA of $2.9 million. That is also an improvement compared to Q1 2022 when its EBITDA was positive and it reached $9.3 million.</p>
<p>Most recently, Genius Sports partnered with Clue, an intelligence provider, to combat corruption and match-fixing. This partnership will result in the creation of a new system that will help official investigations and it will cover over 150 leagues, including the likes of the PGA Tour, NFL, BWF, EPL and DFB.</p>
