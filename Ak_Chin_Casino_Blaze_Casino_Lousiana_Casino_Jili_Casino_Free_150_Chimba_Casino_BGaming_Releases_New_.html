<p>A New Dice-Themed Slot from BGaming</p>
<p>Yulia Aliakseeva, BGaming’s co-CPO, shared her excitement about the recently released slot game. She explained that Dice Million represents another successful game developed by the company that complements its goal to transform gambling into gaming. Finally, Aliakseeva pointed out: “Our Skin Change feature ensures players don’t get bored – as with the click of a button they experience entirely new visuals and a fresh gaming experience.”</p>
<p>“Transforming gambling into gaming is one of the achievements we have strived for since we first launched as a slots studio and Dice Million helps us meet that goal.“ Yulia Aliakseeva, co-CPO at BGaming</p>
<p>Players of BGaming’s new slot can expect an alternative take on the classic dice game, fused with features like Wilds, Expanded wilds, Stacked symbols and Scatters. Without any doubt, no one will be able to mistake the game’s unique gold Expanded Wild dice that can substitute symbols a part of a Scatter, granting a chance for significant payouts.</p>
<p>Additionally, Dice Million brings two Scatter symbols, one purple and one blue, presented as encrusted jewel dice. Those Scatters can further elevate the excitement for the players and contribute toward big prizes.</p>
<p>The new game also brings a feature called Gamble Round. Activated after any win, this feature grants the players a chance to increase their winnings by guessing the correct color or suit.</p>
<p>Last but not least, as explained by Aliakseeva, BGaming’s new slot game offers the popular Skin Change feature. This gamification feature enables players to change the skin of the game and benefit from new experiences without reloading it.</p>
