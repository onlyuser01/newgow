<p>BetRivers, a subsidiary of Rush Street Interactive (RSI), announced that it is the first gambling operator in West Virginia to offer Live Dealer Casino. The new content is provided by Evolution Gaming and is available on the BetRivers Android app and website.</p>
<p>Live Dealer Casinos Are Quickly Gaining Popularity with Operators and Players Alike</p>
<p>Live Dealer games are a new but increasingly popular sector of the online gambling industry and aim to emulate the feeling of being in a land-based casino. Real dealers on physical casino tables interact with online players using specialized software. Live games usually feature higher minimum wagers to compensate for increased costs and can suffer from other disadvantages, but the sector has already attracted a diehard player base.</p>
<p>Evolution Gaming, the company which provides these games, specializes in B2B Online Casino solutions for gaming operators. It services more than 500 online operators as well as several land-based casinos. The company recently made deals to provide its live dealer offerings to Soaring Eagle Gaming, a venture of Michigan’s Saginaw Chippewa Indian Tribe.</p>
<p>BetRivers Will Use This Partnership to Expand Its Foothold in West Virginia</p>
<p>Clients of BetRivers can now participate in live roulette, baccarat, high stakes blackjack, ultimate Texas hold ’em, and three-card poker.</p>
<p>“We are confident that the Evolution-hosted Live Dealer Casino will prove very popular with our players here,” said Richard Schwartz, RSI Chief Executive Officer. He added that the company was excited to offer its players new games through its Live Dealer Casino, which is as close as possible to a land-based establishment. “We’re excited to now offer BetRivers players the chance to virtually sit and play on Evolution’s world-renowned live tables,” he continued. In his words, many players preferred this form of gambling, as watching games live increased player trust in the outcome.</p>
<p>RSI only recently launched in West Virginia. The BetRivers brand was a latecomer to the Mountain State but quickly managed to capture a good share of the local online casino market. The move to partner with Evolution Gaming will likely further increase RSI’s presence as the company expects a positive response to its live dealer content. The operator has been redoubling its expansion efforts and now offers its services within 13 US states in addition to Canada and Colombia. RSI also plans to launch its online casino and sports betting services in Mexico during Q2 2022.</p>
