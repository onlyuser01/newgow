<p>PENN Entertainment said that the rebranding reflects the company’s intention to align the brands under the PENN umbrella</p>
<p>PENN Entertainment, an American entertainment company, has launched a new loyalty program, allowing its customers to win a variety of prizes. The so-called PENN Play program will replace PENN Entertainment’s mychoice program.</p>
<p>As announced by the operator, PENN Play will expand the ways its 26 million loyalty members can earn and redeem rewards across its many brands. The new initiative will most notably connect the company’s subsidiaries under one loyalty program.</p>
<p>PENN Play will make it easier for subscribers to earn, track and redeem PENN Cash. The company’s special loyalty currency can be earned when playing with the brand or when dining, shopping or staying at PENN venues. Players can collect PENN Cash and redeem it for a variety of promotions, experiences and prizes.</p>
<p>Jay Snowden, PENN Entertainment’s president and CEO, commented on the launch of PENN Play, saying that the enhanced loyalty program reflects PENN’s overall transformation. The rebranding, according to him, is the next step in aligning the brands in the PENN family:</p>
<p>With the rebranding of our loyalty program to PENN Play, we are taking steps to better align all of our brands under the PENN umbrella and create a more seamless omnichannel experience for our customers, which we believe will have a meaningful impact on both our retail and online gaming performance. Jay Snowden, president &amp; CEO, PENN Entertainment</p>
<p>About the New Program</p>
<p>PENN Entertainment will celebrate the launch of its new loyalty program with a new promotional campaign. During the campaign, the entertainment company will give away $1.5 million in PENN Cash and prizes to its loyal clients. All players need to do to participate is download the PENN Play app and follow the instructions.</p>
<p>The new PENN Play program will include more meaningful rewards that are easily accessible to customers. There will be various benefits to customers at each of the five Play tiers. In addition, players will be able to access new perks and entertainment experiences with PENN’s partner brands, some of which include Live Nation and Choice Hotels.</p>
<p>PENN Play will allow customers to access a new marketplace that features popular retailers. There, customers will be able to redeem gifts and tier points on everyday items. In addition, there will be a new rewards website and app where players will be able to participate in exclusive promotions.</p>
<p>The new loyalty program is supported by PENN Entertainment’s leading cashless tech. The company will now offer Mastercard credit card sign-up incentives.</p>
<p>Finally, the enhanced loyalty program will also improve the PENN Heroes program (formerly myheroes), through which PENN Entertainment honors American veterans and first responders.</p>
