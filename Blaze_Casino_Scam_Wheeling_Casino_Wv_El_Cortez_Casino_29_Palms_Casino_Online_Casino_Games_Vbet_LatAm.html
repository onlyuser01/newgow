    <h1>Blaze Casino Scam Wheeling Casino Wv El Cortez Casino 29 Palms Casino Online Casino Games Vbet LatAm</h1>

<p>Good afternoon,</p>
<p>I am encountering issues with the Vbet LatAm platform. My account has been unjustly blocked and they refuse to unblock it.</p>
<p>I began playing on the platform due to the FTN freeroll series, which I was unfamiliar with. I only participated in the FTN freeroll series tournaments.</p>
<p>I set up a standard account and played the FTN freerolls, managed to achieve some winnings but couldn't find the balance on the poker platform, thus I created an FTN account in an attempt to locate the balance and play using the FTN credit from the freerolls. I was unaware that this was a violation as I didn't know the platform well, even now I don't know if this is an infringement because the platform offers the option to open this second FTN account.</p>
<p>I continued playing the freerolls, however, I sometimes logged in under the standard account and at other times under the FTN account. I kept getting confused when logging in between the two accounts. Also, I had no knowledge that I wasn't supposed to use the FTN account to play the freerolls. Even today I'm not certain whether this was a wrongdoing as I am still unfamiliar with the platform. However, I didn't play from both accounts simultaneously even once. I only played on one device at a time.</p>
<p>In doubt when I was logging in to play the freerolls, I didn't know whether to use the standard or FTN account. Occasionally, I inadvertently logged in under the FTN account. I was previously unaware of the platform and didn't understand about these two distinct accounts.</p>
<p>Let me reiterate, I didn’t play on both accounts at the same time, ever. But I got confused while logging in to either the standard or FTN account to play freerolls. I only played on one device.</p>
<p>When I was partaking in the last freeroll tournament, I logged in with the FTN account, when I lost the match, the re-buy option appeared, so I opted for the re-buy using the FTN freeroll credit.</p>
<p>The platform then blocked my account. I've sent numerous emails explaining the situation but to no avail. Their emails are of no help.</p>
<p>I have a balance of over 300 Euros that I won in the freerolls but I know they’ll go to great lengths to hinder any withdrawals. Their emails are unhelpful and resolve nothing.</p>
<p>I would like my account to be unblocked, but given their level of support, I doubt they'll even hear me out. The support is terrible.</p>
<p>I at least wish to be able to withdraw the funds I've won honestly.</p>
<p>Can you assist me?</p>
