<p>Rivalry has made another step forward in its business model by becoming a publicly-traded company on the TSX Venture Exchange. The company’s public listing will allow Rivalry to add more capital to its operations and launch new products and verticals.</p>
<p>Rivalry experienced significant growth in recent years and secured a number of funding rounds throughout 2021, taking its offer from an esports-first approach to a broader interactive gaming and betting experience.</p>
<p>The company is also following in the footsteps of Luckbox, another competitor with a focus on esports that has been expanding in traditional sports and iGaming products. Luckbox was listed on the TSX Venture Exchange back in January.</p>
<p>Building on Company’s Momentum in Esports and Beyond</p>
<p>Commenting on the development, Rivalry CEO and co-founder Steven Salz said that the move would allow the company to continue building on its momentum. Moving forward, Rivalry is committed to securing and developing its presence in Australia and Canada by leveraging a variety of social media and video content products.</p>
<p>Rivalry continues to bill its offer as the “most engaged esports betting brand,” and the company has been consistently delivering on great esports betting experiences. However, Rivalry’s interest now goes beyond the competitive video gaming vertical, with Canada’s legalization of single-event sports betting opening up new opportunities.</p>
<p>“Listing publicly on the TSXV marks the next major step in Rivalry’s journey. We are building the most comprehensive betting and entertainment experience for the next generation globally, and feel we are just getting started,” Salz said.</p>
<p>He thanked early-day investors for believing in the company and assured them that new and exciting things were ahead. Rivalry was valued at $150 million during its most recent funding round in June, and the company manages to generate the eye-watering 85% of its total traffic from esports, Forbes reported.</p>
<p>Rivalry’s Story and Current Operations</p>
<p>Rivalry’s success story begins in 2018 with the company headquartered in Toronto but holding a license in the Isle of Man. The company managed to introduce its sports betting offer in Australia earlier this year and said that it would seek to continue its growth elsewhere.</p>
<p>Reporting by Dot Esports brought up the fact that Rivalry co-founder Steven Isenberg is also on the board of the TSX Venture Exchange.</p>
<p>The publication reached out to Rivalry for comment, to which the company responded: “Steve sits on the advisory board for the TSXV. He is more of a stakeholder with absolutely zero governance role. During the process of listing, all members of Rivalry were vetted for conflicts of interest by the Stock Exchange, and Steve’s advisory position was not an issue.”</p>
<p>Rivalry, along with Luckbox, Betway, and Pinnacle, is the de-facto defining esports betting websites millions of fans trust worldwide.</p>
