<p>Information about Paysafecard casinos</p>
<p>Paysafe has been at the forefront of the European prepaid card industry since the year 2000, and its popularity means there are many Paysafecard casinos in our database. Part of the reason for its success is its ease-of-use, with players able to simply use a Paysafecard voucher to directly deposit funds into an online casino account.</p>
<p>We want to help you find safe Paysafe casino sites to play on, which is why all of the options on this list have been rated and reviewed by our Casino Guru experts. In this piece, we're also going to look in-depth at Paysafe as a company, and what benefits and drawbacks you need to be aware of if you decide to deposit with Paysafecard.</p>
<p>Table of contents:</p>
<p>About Paysafe and Paysafecard</p>
<p>Paysafecard itself traces its roots back to Vienna, Austria, where it was set up by a small group of entrepreneurs. It still has its headquarters there, but has since expanded to over 50 countries in the world, spanning five continents.</p>
<p>In that time, it has been subject to a pair of acquisitions. First, Skrill, which can also be used in Skrill casinos, took them over in 2013, and then UK-based Optimal Payments Group absorbed the Skrill empire two years later. Optimal Payments liked the name of the card so much that they later rebranded the company to Paysafe Group, as it's known today.</p>
<p>The company, including Paysafecard, is regulated by the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and boasts a fruitful partnership with the world-famous Mastercard. In March 2020, the companies announced an expanded relationship, integrating Apple Pay and Google Pay into the Paysafe payment system.</p>
<p>What is Paysafecard?</p>
<p>Paysafecard is a payment method based on vouchers that range in value and contain a 16-digit code, which can be used to pay for products and services online.</p>
<p>The vouchers can be purchased at a wide variety of physical locations, such as grocery stores, gas stations, newsstands, etc. The company has a network of partners in individual countries, so the exact stores you can purchase Paysafecard vouchers will depend on your country. Use the Paysafecard store finder to find the one closest to you.</p>
<p>Paysafecard Mastercard and account</p>
<p>In general, you do not need to create a Paysafecard account to pay for goods and services online – the only thing you need is the 16-digit PIN from the purchased voucher. However, there is an option to create a My Paysafecard account, which allows you to make larger transactions, keep track of your vouchers, and also make casino withdrawals using this method. Without this account, you cannot withdraw funds using Paysafecard.</p>
<p>Also, there is an option to request a Paysafecard Mastercard, which is linked to your My Paysafecard account. You can use this card just as you would use any other Mastercard debit card. Just be aware of the associated fees, which are charged for ATM cash withdrawals, adding money to your Mastercard, etc.</p>
<p>The pros and cons of Paysafecard</p>
<p>If you are considering Paysafecard and other payment options, it is good to explore the advantages and disadvantages of using Paysafecard overall, as well as specifically for online gambling transactions.</p>
<p>Widespread availability of Paysafecard vouchers</p>
<p>We've mentioned how easy it is to use Paysafecard. Paysafe's multinational presence means you can buy one of their cards from more than 650,000 sales outlets worldwide, including supermarkets and gas stations; all of which can be found on the official website thanks to their store finder.</p>
<p>Each card, ranging from $10 to $100 (or similar values in other currencies) at a time, gives you a unique 16-digit PIN, which you enter into the payment section of your chosen online store.</p>
<p>The card can be used on a variety of major platforms, including the likes of Apple and Amazon, and you can track all of your spending via a specially-designed app.</p>
<p>Customer support</p>
<p>If you experience a problem with your Paysafecard transaction, then the company offers a range of support services. Firstly, freephone numbers are available for most countries, and you can email their support team via their official website.</p>
<p>Paysafecard also has a significant social media presence, and responds to queries via Twitter and Facebook, as well as having extra information on LinkedIn and Instagram.</p>
<p>Anonymity of some transactions</p>
<p>As you can purchase Paysafecard vouchers with cash and use the 16-digit code to pay online, this allows for anonymous online transactions.</p>
<p>However, this is limited to smaller values, and you might need to create a My Paysafecard account to make larger transactions. This option requires you to submit your personal information, so the advantage of anonymity only applies to some transactions.</p>
<p>Casino withdrawals to Paysafecard</p>
<p>For online casino players, it's important to know whether they can withdraw their winnings using their preferred deposit option. So, can you withdraw funds using Paysafecard? It's a bit complicated.</p>
<p>If you only plan to use Paysafecard anonymously – purchase vouchers at one of the retailers and use them to make a casino deposit – you will not be able to withdraw funds back using Paysafecard. In this case, you will need to use another withdrawal option, such as VISA, Mastercard, or bank transfer.</p>
<p>To withdraw funds using Paysafecard, you will need a My Paysafecard account. With this account, you can keep track of your purchased vouchers and withdraw funds back to your account if you win.</p>
<p>Paysafecard fees</p>
<p>While the Paysafecard is marketed as not needing a bank account or credit card to set it up, it does come attached with certain fees for some users that are maybe not obvious at first glance.</p>
<p>These are as follows:</p>
<p>A monthly maintenance fee of $2 (which is deducted from your balance) if your voucher remains inactive for 24 months, however this can change according to your country.</p>
<p>of $2 (which is deducted from your balance) if your voucher remains inactive for 24 months, however this can change according to your country. A currency conversion fee , the amount of which varies depending on the type of currency you need.</p>
<p>, the amount of which varies depending on the type of currency you need. A redemption fee of $7.50 for any refund you receive - so if, for example, you buy a $100 card, spend all of it on a purchase and then ask for a refund, you'll only receive $92.50 back.</p>
<p>Although the first two expenses are pretty standard, the redemption fee seems expensive, especially when refunds are a fairly common occurrence and it's hard to imagine them costing the company that much to process them.</p>
<p>It's worth pointing out, however, that these fees are the exception rather than the rule: they only apply in certain cases and most Paysafecard customers won't experience them.</p>
<p>Pros Cons Run by an established payment provider Withdrawals to Paysafecard only available with My Paysafecard account Allows for payments without entering bank or card information Fees for some operations Vouchers can be purchased at hundreds of thousands of retail locations around the world Option of Mastercard connected to My Paysafecard account Range of customer support options Pros and cons of Paysafecard</p>
<p>How to use Paysafecard in casinos</p>
<p>As you can see from this list, there are a large number of online casinos that accept Paysafe, so it's good to know how to make a deposit.</p>
<p>How to deposit using Paysafecard</p>
<p>When you find a suitable Paysafe casino (more on that later), you need to sign up or log in, depending on if you have an account. From there, you just enter your Paysafecard details and make a deposit. The minimum amount can vary depending on the casino: some of them require as little as $10 to get started and these $10 Paysafe casinos are quite common, which is handy as you can buy a Paysafecard voucher for that amount.</p>
<p>Paysafecard casino withdrawals</p>
<p>You can now also use Paysafe services to withdraw money from online casinos, although it will need more than the voucher you used to deposit the money in the first place - more specifically, your My Paysafecard account details.</p>
<p>Simply log in to your account page at the casino and select Paysafecard as the withdrawal method: you'll then have to enter the amount you want to take out and your email address. The funds should then be instantly credited to your My Paysafecard account balance and you can use them to make another purchase.</p>
<p>Additionally, having a My Paysafecard Mastercard can broaden your options, as you'll be able to withdraw this money from an ATM or spend it in other Mastercard-friendly sites.</p>
<p>So, while it's possible for withdrawals to be done like this , it's worth noting that Paysafecard is more commonly used as a deposit method.</p>
<p>Choosing the best Paysafecard casino for you</p>
<p>Now we have a better idea of what Paysafe is all about, it's helpful to find the best casinos that use Paysafe vouchers.</p>
<p>This is what our Paysafecard casino list is here for. Our team has spent many hours reviewing and rating each casino, the criteria of which can be explained in our How we review online casinos article.</p>
<p>You can also use the filters on this page to finetune your search. The list is already optimized for your country (using your IP) but, if you want, you can also check the 'For Players from' box and then your country to see the relevant casinos for where you are. So, Australian users, for example, can see Australian casinos that accept Paysafe by checking the relevant box.</p>
<p>From there, it's worth clicking the 'Recommended' tab to get the best ones out there, according to our team. If you want the latest Paysafe casinos, just hit 'Newly opened', and then, to go back to the full list, check the 'All' tab.</p>
<p>New Paysafecard casinos</p>
<p>If you are specifically looking for newest online casinos with Paysafecard payments, there are some things you should keep in mind before you choose.</p>
<p>New casinos can be a bit of a mixed bag. While many players actively look for them because of their modern websites and often also quite tempting bonus offers, the fact they are new to the market comes with some disadvantages.</p>
<p>Unless a new casino is operated by an established company that also runs other casinos, which are known to be reliable, we just cannot be 100% sure about its trustworthiness. Of course, this does not mean that all new casinos are bad or unsafe. They just come with a certain degree of uncertainty, which is much higher than it is with established, well-known casinos.</p>
<p>Now, if you are OK with that and want to find new Paysafecard casinos, you can do that on this page by selecting the 'Newly opened' tab near the top of this page. Just make sure to pay attention to the Safety Index of the listed casinos and keep in mind the potential downsides of newly opened casino sites.</p>
<p>Paysafecard casino bonuses</p>
<p>As an online casino player, you probably want to know which Paysafe casinos give you the chance to get bonuses. To start, you can see some bonuses directly in this list, but if you're searching for a specific bonus, you can look in our linked lists.</p>
<p>These can be found out via our list of casino bonuses. Simply go there and select the Paysafecard box on the payment provider filter, which will give you all the bonuses offered by casinos that support Paysafe payments. For those of you interested in free bonuses, then our list of no deposit bonuses will have all of those, and the same filter can be applied there.</p>
