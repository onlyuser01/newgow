    <h1>Casino Wilkes Barre Pennsylvania Casino Night Dress Suncoast Hotel And Casino Sands Casino Juegos De</h1>

<p>Hi everyone. I have a complaint against betflip that is hard for me to believe even after experiencing it.</p>
<p>I was looking for a bitcoin Sportsbook because I didn’t want my btc converted to dollars. On my search I found a couple decent reviews on betflip so decided to give them a try. I deposited 0.2 btc on 11/29. I was automatically given a 110% bonus and my balance showed 0.42 btc. Keep in mind I did not ACCEPT any bonus and was never even given the option to accept or decline it. I tend not to bother with deposit bonus’s after some horror stories I’ve seen online but I wasn’t given a choice here.</p>
<p>I played for around a month, and whenever I accounted for my balance I simply subtracted the 0.22 bonus as I figured there was no way I’d meet the rollover and they would simply remove the 0.22 once the bonus period was over. By 12/27 I had 0.6495 in my account, 0.4295 by removing the bonus. (I have screenshots of everything I can provide if needed) On the morning of 12/27 I log into my account and I see 0.0973 btc. I check my account history and there was a withdraw for 0.5522 btc. I immediately went on live chat as I assumed someone hacked into my account. They told me I received an email about this so I checked and got the following:</p>
<hr />
<p>Our sport fraud team have checked your sport tickets history. They have detected that you have violated bonus rules. You have an active 111% bonus on your first deposit(0.2BTC). In detail, you have made dozens of bets on less than 3 positions in ticket and won. Total net wins(12524.63Euro equivalent 0.5522BTC) accumulated by these tickets are forfeited. All bets made by violating of rules are not counted in wager requirement.</p>
<p>Please consider bonus rules(minimum 3 positions in ticket, minimum odd 1.3 for each position, minimum total odd 2.5 of ticket.) in your future play. We reserve a right to act more strictly in case of repeated violation.</p>
<hr />
<p>So essentially they are saying whenever you have a bonus (which they FORCE you into taking) you are only allowed to bet 3 team parlays?!? This is one of the most ridiculous things I’ve ever heard of. I try to understand their math of how I somehow have half the money of my original deposit, and I’m told on live chat they voided ONLY THE WINNING TICKETS. The losing tickets stand. To everything I say I basically get the same generic answer: "It’s in the rules." I was also told every new user has no choice but to accept the bonus and play by these "rules."</p>
<p>I am posting this to warn everyone to never touch this site. Can someone from casinoguru help me work this out with them? Thanks in advance.</p>
