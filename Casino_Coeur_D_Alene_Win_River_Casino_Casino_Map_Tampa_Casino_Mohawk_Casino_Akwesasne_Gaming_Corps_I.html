    <h1>Casino Coeur D Alene Win River Casino Casino Map Tampa Casino Mohawk Casino Akwesasne Gaming Corps I</h1>

<p>The prominent studio and developer of gaming content has expanded its reach and clout with a new operator that will allow it to broaden its reach with wider audiences</p>
<p>To this end, Gaming Corps has signed its new partnership with Coolbet, allowing the company to scale its operational reach. The companies are expanding in the Estonian market and charting a way forward as Coolbet is also licensed to operate in Sweden, among other territories.</p>
<p>Coolbet Taps into Gaming Corps’ Product</p>
<p>As part of this partnership, Coolbet will benefit from a range of acclaimed Gaming Corps titles, such as Jet Lucky 2, Aztec Bonus Pot &amp; Raging Zeus, Coin Miner, Penalty Champion, and many others. Gaming Corps director of sales Mats Lundin said that he was very happy to see this partnership take shape with Coolbet, a brand that prioritizes innovation and engagement of all things.</p>
<p>Coolbet is all about momentum and innovation, with management bringing more than 90 years of online gambling experience to the table. Coolbet has demonstrated success across its 10 active territories, and this partnership is more positive news for us following our launch in Estonia. We are delighted to be working with Coolbet and look forward to bringing our premium games to more players. Gaming Corps director of sales Mats Lundin</p>
<p>Coolbet president Endre Nesset was similarly excited to see his brand host yet another prominent player in the iGaming market. Gaming Corps, Nesset argued, was one of the most significant studios and providers of content for the vertical.</p>
<p>“We look forward to working with Gaming Corps and I’m sure our players will enjoy making the most of their games,” he concluded.</p>
<p>Coolbet Expands Globally, Folds in Some Locations</p>
<p>Coolbet has also been growing geographically. The company recently added its tenth regulated market brand with a launch in Mexico. Coolbet has recently had to fold its operations in Ontario, however, citing stiff competition in the iGaming and sports betting landscape in the province.</p>
<p>The company has also been scaling up its content offering. Besides teaming up with Gaming Corps, it previously signed a partnership with Highlight Games’ Ice Hockey product.</p>
