<p>Light &amp; Wonder has signed an exclusive aggregation agreement with 1X2 Network, debuting the latter’s content on the US market starting with Michigan</p>
<p>NASDAQ and ASX-listed Light &amp; Wonder, Inc. has announced an important exclusive aggregation deal with 1X2 Network to help the latter roll its content for the US public.</p>
<p>According to the terms of the agreement, 1X2 Network’s games will debut for gamers in Michigan.</p>
<p>The deal also signals an important entry for 1X2 Network into the vibrant market in the US while leveraging Light &amp; Wonder’s premium aggregation platform.</p>
<p>The newly inked agreement is just one of the freshest on a long list of similar studio deals signed by Light &amp; Wonder, further proving the strength of its leading platform and distribution network on the American market where it continues to deliver content that is both dynamic and immersive to the greatest names in the industry.</p>
<p>1X2 Network, Ready for Launch in the US</p>
<p>1X2 Network, which is well-known for its versatile content featuring crash games, slots, instant win games, and virtual sports, is getting ready to launch on the gaming scene in the US in the near future.</p>
<p>Its content is a result of the hard work of its four internal studios, 1X2gaming, Iron Dog Studio, Prospect Gaming, and Ad Lunam.</p>
<p>The decision to enter the US market will build on a successful European alliance, proving the strength and potential of the collaboration.</p>
<p>1X2 Network’s chief executive officer, Kevin Reid, commented on the content expansion decision, expressing excitement for having Light &amp; Wonder as their exclusive aggregation partner which is expected to help them extend their lucrative ties and leverage their strong platform for wider distribution.</p>
<p>Reid explained that while their work will be initiated in The Great Lake State, work was already “well underway in other states.”</p>
<p>Light &amp; Wonder Expects to Repeat Success in Europe</p>
<p>Also commenting on the new exclusive aggregation agreement, Light &amp; Wonder’s digital partnerships director, Steve Mayes, praised 1X2 Network’s long history spanning across two decades “of producing slick, innovative content that is very popular with players.”</p>
<p>Mayes also called it “great” to be able to start introducing 1×2 Network’s games to players in the US who are expected to be “every bit as receptive as players have been in the European markets.”</p>
<p>Light &amp; Wonder focuses on creating content, hardware, and systems that bring together iconic titles across all places and channels while turning games into expansive entertainment and thrilling players with “characters and stories they can’t get enough of.”</p>
<p>In January, the company appointed Michael Marchetti to the board of directors. Last October, ReelPlay and Light &amp; Wonder announced a four-year expansion of their current deal.</p>
