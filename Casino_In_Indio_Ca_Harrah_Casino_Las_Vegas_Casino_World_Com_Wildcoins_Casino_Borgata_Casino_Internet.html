<p>The leading B2B technology and solutions provider for the online gambling vertical, EveryMatrix, announced a new collaboration in West Virginia with the award-winning global iGaming hosting provider, Internet Vikings.</p>
<p>EveryMatrix Teams up with Internet Vikings</p>
<p>The newly announced deal saw EveryMatrix select Internet Vikings as its operational hosting services provider for West Virginia. The company acknowledged that this collaboration seeks to build a foundation for ongoing deals and further expansion with Internet Vikings in other US jurisdictions.</p>
<p>EveryMatrix is a leading B2B software, solution, content and services provider for the iGaming industry. The company currently has offices in 10 countries around the world and caters to a growing portfolio of more than 150 clients. With that in mind, the expansion in West Virginia complements EveryMatrix’s US expansion plan.</p>
<p>The company is currently a member of a non-profit association that seeks to create jobs within the entertainment sector in the US called iDEA Growth. Besides the latest collaboration with Internet Vikings, EveryMatrix recently celebrated its launch into the regulated US online gambling market in New Jersey via a deal with BetMGM.</p>
<p>“EveryMatrix has chosen Internet Vikings as a partner for operational hosting services in West Virginia as of summer 2022,“ reads a statement released by Internet Vikings</p>
<p>The Collaboration Will Benefit the Duo</p>
<p>It was back in August last year when Internet Vikings first launched its West Virginia operations. By now, the company has a growing portfolio of clients within the jurisdiction. Additionally, Internet Vikings has a strong presence in multiple US jurisdictions that have legalized sports betting and/or online gambling.</p>
<p>Focusing on the global picture, Internet Vikings was established back in 2008. In less than two decades, the company significantly expanded its presence and won awards for global iGaming Hosting Provider. Besides hosting services, the company offers VMware hosting, hosting colocation, cloud hosting, SEO hosting, replication servers and managed hosting.</p>
<p>“This partnership will benefit us both in multiple ways. It does not just support our client in establishing a reliable foundation in the US.“ Rickard Vikström, founder and CEO of Internet Vikings</p>
<p>Rickard Vikström, Internet Vikings’ founder and CEO, revealed that expansion within the competitive US market can be achieved via a strong strategy in combination with valuable B2B relations. Moreover, he added that the growing US market is complex but remains a popular location for European iGaming companies. Vikström explained that the new deal with EveryMatrix will serve as the first step in a long-term collaboration that is expected to bring success for the duo. Finally, he said that the new deal will bring benefits for both EveryMatrix and Internet Vikings.</p>
