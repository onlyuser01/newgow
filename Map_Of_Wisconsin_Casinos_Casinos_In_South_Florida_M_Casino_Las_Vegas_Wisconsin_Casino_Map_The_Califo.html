<p>Serengeti King review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Serengeti King takes you to the African savanna where great cats rule. When the sun is up it is the lion’s turn. Majestic with his great mane he rules the day, but at night a black leopard takes the throne.</p>
<p>The conflict between these two rulers is cleverly integrated into the game's bonus system (see below). And their subjects – various animals including giraffe and meerkats – live on the reels.</p>
<p>Their realm of rolling grasslands make up the backdrop to the game.</p>
<p>It’s a great twist on the classic African wildlife theme.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>One of the selling points of Serengeti King is it’s excellent range of visuals. The reels are full of delightful animals that are both realistic and convey more personality than mere photorealism can.</p>
<p>The background is deep and beautiful. Grasslands rolling away for miles. The three settings for this are: day for the lion spins, night for panther spins, and dawn for the bonus spins are all gorgeous. And together they add up to a pleasing variety of visuals.</p>
<p>The animations are bright and clean. With a little more flare than most slots, but nothing too distracting.</p>
<p>The music feels like something off the Lion King soundtrack and the spin and win sounds are excellent. There is even a throaty growl every time a lion lands on the reels.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Serengeti King is played on five reels with four rows. It has a fixed 26 win lines.</p>
<p>The game starts with Lion Spins, then after twelve Lion Spins it switches over to Panther spins. It switches back after another twelve spins.</p>
<p>All Lion symbols are added to the reels after the full cycle of Panther and Lion spins are finished</p>
<p>During each spin, if a Lion or Panther symbol lands on the reels, it is collected. At the end of the Lion spins, all the collected Lion spins are added to the reels. At the end of the Panther spins, the same thing happens to the Panther symbols. You collect both symbols during all spins.</p>
<p>After the Lion spins and then Panther spins are finished, collected Panther symbols are added to the reels for a payout</p>
<p>There is an excellent bonus (details below) and overall the gameplay matches the quality of the visuals and style.</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter symbol.</p>
<p>Three or more Scatter symbols trigger the Free Spin bonus with 12 spins.</p>
<p>If triggered by three Scatter symbols, the Free Spins start with zero on both counters. With four Scatters the player keeps their current count on both counters. With five Scatters +5 is added to each counter.</p>
<p>All collected symbols are added to the reels for the final Free Spins payout</p>
<p>During the Free Spins, all the Panther and Lion symbols are added to the counters. At the end of the free spins, all of the symbols are added to the reels. Where a Lion lands on a Panther or vice versa, the symbol is transformed into a Wild and gains plus one to its multiplier.</p>
<p>Super Big win in the Free Spins feature</p>
<p>You can buy directly into the Free Spins.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.20%, a little over our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.10 up to a maximum of $/£/€100. per spin.</p>
<p>Full paytable for the Serengeti King slot, set to €1 bet</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is medium, which makes it a poor match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Serengeti King is a brilliant slot. From first impressions it gets across wonderful visuals in a rich and changing game world.</p>
<p>The basics of the gameplay are thematically strong, unique, and give the game a feeling of progress.</p>
<p>The RTP is a little above average, and we would normally like higher volatility to go with our strategies. But if you don’t mind taking a hit on the volatility, this is a truly excellent game that we highly recommend.</p>
