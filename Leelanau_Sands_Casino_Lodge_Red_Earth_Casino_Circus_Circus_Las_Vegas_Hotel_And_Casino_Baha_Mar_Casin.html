<p>The American daily fantasy sports contest and sports betting company DraftKings has bolstered its media team with two media industry heavyweights.</p>
<p>DraftKings Adds Two Veterans to Its Media Team</p>
<p>The two new members who will be responsible for the gambling operator’s media endeavors are Stacie McCollum who will be DraftKings’ new head of programming and Todd Dubester who joins as a vice president of media strategy and business operations. This acquisition continues DraftKings’ strategy of building a strong core team.</p>
<p>The two new hires will be responsible for managing the company’s media operations and content growth. McCollum will collaborate with DraftKings’ executive team in owned content and distribution development. At the same time, Dubester will search for new distribution channels, will evaluate business models, and will seek the best long-term approach for DraftKings’ media and content.</p>
<p>Both of the appointees boast years of experience in their respective fields. Prior to joining DraftKings, McCollum worked for sports coverage company ESPN. As a member of ESPN, she was first a director of programming and acquisition for six years. In 2015, McCollum began a tenure as a senior director of programming and acquisitions that lasted for four years and eventually rose to the position of vice president of programming and acquisitions which she maintained for two additional years.</p>
<p>Dubester, on the other hand, has over two decades of experience in senior media roles for some of the most popular media companies. He has held positions in Universal Studios and Walt Disney and has vast experience with programming and media distribution. Dubester is also the founder and chief executive of Academy Sports Media.</p>
<p>DraftKings Continues to Invest in Quality</p>
<p>Brian Angiolet, the chief media officer of DraftKings welcomed the two specialists to the company. He said that acquiring such talented staff is a key to DraftKing’s strategy to differentiate itself on the market. Angiolet is sure that the acquisitions of the two media veterans is a giant leap for the company as it continues to invest in the buildout of its assets.</p>
<p>Angiolet seeks to benefit from the fast growth of the sports betting market and is sure that McCollum and Dubester will assist in DraftKing’s expansion efforts by bringing different outlooks to the brand and revolutionizing its content vision.</p>
<p>DraftKings is already celebrated as the most visible sportsbook in the United States. Even so, the company is still seeking to boost the quality of its content and reach new audiences. The acquisition of the two seasoned media veterans is a power move that will push the operator forward.</p>
