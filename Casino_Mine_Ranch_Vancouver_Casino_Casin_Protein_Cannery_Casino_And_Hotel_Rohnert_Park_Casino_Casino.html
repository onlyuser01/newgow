    <h1>Casino Mine Ranch Vancouver Casino Casin Protein Cannery Casino And Hotel Rohnert Park Casino Casino</h1>

<p>Good morning,</p>
<p>The casino in question of accepting deposits might be one of the best I've ever seen but the problem is when we want to receive what we've won, they make a whole problem that doesn't fit in anyone's head.</p>
<p>First, that my withdrawals were approved was a problem because whenever I tried to withdraw them they said that I had not met the requirements that would be to bet the 10 euros I deposited -&gt; x3 if they were in a casino and x1 if it were in sports betting. When I won the 70 euros I had already bet more than 30 euros to be aware (in sports) and they wouldn't let me get up. Only after making a complaint in their support emails was it approved there. However I managed to withdraw +30 the next day, which makes a total of 100euros.</p>
<p>Since then it has been hell, this was done on the 18th (70euros) and the 19th (30euros), the problem is that the money does not reach the account.</p>
<p>I already told them that the money did not arrive and they tell me that I need a statement from the bank that the money was not received, the problem is that I already went to the bank and the banks do not issue this type of statement and they said that I could send the statement bank where you literally have ALL my transactions and where you can see that the money was not actually received. Well, I sent the bank statement and dear support always responds with the same type of response that looks like we are talking to a bot... the answer below:</p>
<p>"Dear Player,</p>
<p>Please note that all payment details can be found in the proof of payment provided earlier. We recommend that you refer to the documentation provided for payment details.</p>
<p>Thank you for your understanding."</p>
<p>Yes, they sent a proof of shipment, where there is not even a company/bank logo, which leaves me thinking that most likely the proof is false or the transfer was canceled after sending.</p>
<p>I have attached proof of receipt, what is certain is that it is the 31st and the money has not arrived.</p>
<p>The worst thing about this is that it must be a legit casino, since I only entered it because it was a GodMota lookalike.</p>
<p>Oh and I almost forgot, on the 26th I raised another 250 euros from there and I bet it goes the same way....</p>
<p>I await help...</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
