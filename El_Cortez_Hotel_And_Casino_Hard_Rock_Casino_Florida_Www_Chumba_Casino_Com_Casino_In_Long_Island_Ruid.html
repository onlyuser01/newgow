<p>A Wisconsin man was named as a suspect in the recent robbery of the Waukesha State Bank and another holdup. He had been sentenced to several years in prison for a prior holdup of a credit union — and possibly spent that loot at a casino.</p>

<p>This Wednesday, Kaia Mueller, 44, of Elkhorn was named by Lake Delton, Wisc. authorities as the suspect in a robbery, the holdup of the Waukesha State Bank branch, and car thefts.</p>
<p>The holdups took place in Oconomowoc, Wisc. on Tuesday. As of late this week, he was apprehended but not charged with the offenses.</p>
<p>Following this week’s robberies, Mueller allegedly got into an accident in a car he was driving on Interstate 94. He then fled into nearby woods.</p>
<p>Police searched for him for hours. The highway was shut down.</p>
<p>Later, he apparently stole a second car, police said. It was involved in another accident and then driven away. This collision was near State Highway 67.</p>
<p>Eventually, he was apprehended Wednesday by police while in the second car. As of late this week, Mueller was in custody in the Sauk County jail.</p>
<p>Whitewater Heist</p>
<p>In 2016, Mueller was sentenced to four years in prison for the credit union robbery. He also was given four years of extended supervision.</p>
<p>He pleaded guilty to the 2015 robbery of Whitewater, Wisc.’s Fort Community Credit Union, WITI, a local TV station, reported. Police claim he walked into the credit union, went up to a teller, and put a bag on the counter. Mueller claimed he had a gun. He ordered the teller to place money in the bag.</p>
<p>Mueller spent the money from the credit union robbery at a casino, his wife told police. He also is said to have a gambling problem, WITI said.</p>
<p>In 2006, Mueller was sentenced to five years in prison for a drug conviction in Hawaii, WITI said.</p>
<p>Prior Wisconsin Gambling-Related Crimes</p>
<p>Last month, in an unrelated incident, an escaped, convicted sex offender from Wisconsin was apprehended in a Las Vegas gaming property. It marked the second time in recent years the man escaped from custody and wound up being arrested in Nevada.</p>
<p>Lloyd Pitzen, 71, allegedly escaped from a transitional living facility in Oshkosh, Wisc. in 2019. He allegedly cut off his GPS monitoring bracelet during the escape.</p>
<p>He was on the loose for over a year. It was not until the US Marshals Fugitive Task Force spotted him in Nevada at the unidentified gaming property that he was apprehended.</p>
<p>He is charged with tampering with a GPS tracking device and a sex offender registry violation, according to WBAY, a Wisconsin TV station.</p>
<p>Also, in still another incident, the man accused of murdering three people, two at Oregon’s Mill Casino RV lot, and leaving a fourth victim critically injured in June remains in Wisconsin. He is not waiving extradition back to Oregon.</p>
<p>Oen Evan Nicholson, 30, turned himself in to Milwaukee police in connection with the North Bend, Ore. multiple homicides.</p>
<p>Nicholson allegedly killed his father, Charles Simms Nicholson, 83. He left the body in a trailer at the RV park.</p>
<p>He also allegedly ran over an elderly Florida couple at the RV lot. Anthony Oyster, 74, died at the crime scene. Linda Oyster, 73, was critically injured.</p>
<p>Following the hit and run, Nicholson drove to the Herbal Choice Marijuana Dispensary, also in North Bend. He allegedly fatally shot a woman in the dispensary. She was identified as Jennifer L. Davidson, 47, of Coos Bay.</p>
<p>Nicholson also allegedly forced Laura Johnson of Oregon to drive him more than 2,000 miles to Wisconsin. The two were believed to be acquaintances.</p>
