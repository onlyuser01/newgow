<p>Dear Joelene and Casino Guru team,</p>
<p>We sincerely regret about the issue that the player Joelene experienced, however, we would like to shed the light on the situation that occurred.</p>
<p>To start with, the player has contacted us regarding the withdrawal of funds. We would like to assure that the cashout was successful by our side and the player was informed about this. After a few days, the player contacted us about the fact that she did not receive funds. We immediately clarified the information on this matter, and since there were no difficulties with withdrawing funds from our side, we asked the player for a bank statement. It is needed in order to check that the funds had not been credited to the account. The player has kindly provided us with this document.</p>
<p>We contacted the provider again to report this issue. The payment provider gave us all the data that can help to find the transaction in the player's bank. In turn, we immediately provided the player with this information.</p>
<p>Later the player again gave us information that can prove that she didn't receive the funds from us. We are very grateful for the player's help and assistance in this situation.</p>
<p>Now we have contacted the payment provider with the requirement to carefully check all the data and documents provided by you. We asked to clarify the issue with the funds that have not been credited to your bank account.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the problem is still being considered by the provider. We cannot influence the time of the response from the provider, but we constantly ask for an update and about an opportunity to speed up this process.</p>
<p>We also contacted the player with an explanation regarding this situation. Our team is deeply sorry that this situation occurred and that we keep the player waiting. We would like to point out that we don't want to cause any inconvenience and our team does our best to resolve this situation.</p>
<p>Dear Joelene, we sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused, but believe us, we are doing everything we can to resolve this situation so that you can receive funds.</p>
<p>Hope for your understanding!</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>7Bit Casino</p>
