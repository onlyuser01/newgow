    <h1>No Deposit Online Casino Real Money Rhode Island Casinos Casino Movie Casinos Cerca De M World S Lar</h1>

<p>Hi Nitin and CasinoGuru,</p>
<p>This bad review comes as a surprise. Why don't you share the facts with Casino Guru instead of writing false facts?</p>
<p>This player registered under someone else's identity (different name and surname) and when we started verification, we noticed that the credentials on the account did not match the person who had deposited or claimed to play on the account.</p>
<p>Upon further investigation and chats with support the player claimed his real name is Nitin but likes the name Riddhi, so used it upon registration. So we immediately blocked his account for review, due to a suspected breach of our terms for 3rd party deposits and use on an account. Later this was confirmed with proof of documentation and player acknowledging that Riddhi is a different person.</p>
<p>After this we have been receiving messages through Riddhi's email asking about his "friend's" pending withdrawal and to answer him (Nitin) on his personal email which is not associated with the account.</p>
<p>The player broke the rules, and there are consequences to these actions. The player should explain to us in the first place why he used a friend's name and not his own. Temporary freezing of an account is going to happen when we ask for a bank statement and ID and see it doesn't match. These are standard KYC checks and procedures.</p>
