<p>Sports Information Services, a major supplier of 24/7 live sports betting services, has decided to sponsor the handicap race on the El Derby Day</p>
<p>The meeting is set to take place at the Valparaíso Sporting Club track in Viña del Mar, Chile. This agreement builds on the provider’s existing agreement with the track.</p>
<p>The event in question is scheduled for February 5. As per the deal, the undercard handicap race before the main Clásico El Derby will bear SIS’ name, thus attesting to the company’s commitment to LATAM sports.</p>
<p>The Valparaisío Sporting Club is the oldest track in the region and was founded in 1882. It has long partnered with SIS, which has supported the club with its betting services.</p>
<p>The El Derby day festival itself is a huge event with 30 races, inspired by the English Derby. It represents Chile’s main Group One classic race and is the third and final race of the National Triple Crown. Each year, the major sporting event is attended by no fewer than 150,000 people.</p>
<p>The agreement, SIS noted, follows on its other recent LATAM-oriented sponsorships. Before agreeing to sponsor the handicap race ahead of the Clásico El Derby, SIS also penned similar agreements with the Hipódromo Maroñas in Uruguay and Hipódromo Palermo in Argentina.</p>
<p>The supplier reaffirmed its commitment to local sports and its intentions to continue nurturing the LATAM racing sector in particular.</p>
<p>An Important Day for Chilean Racing</p>
<p>Michele Fischer, vice president of SIS Content Services, commented on the sponsorship agreement. She noted that the El Derby Day is something truly special for people in Chile, which is why SIS is happy to be a part of it.</p>
<p>Fischer noted that her company has a flourishing relationship with Valparaiso Sporting Club and promised that it will continue to support sports in the LATAM region.</p>
<p>We have a well-established partnership with Valparaiso Sporting Club. Our commitment to racing in Latin America is well-documented and it is a region that continues to be of strategic importance for our business. Michele Fischer, vice president, SIS Content Services</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Valparaiso Sporting Club’s commercial manager, Hernán Robles said that the El Derby is an event that brings the Chilean racing community together. It is also a good occasion for the club to find new partners and make the racing event even better.</p>
<p>SIS is a highly valued partner and we are delighted to have their support to make the day special for all our stakeholders. Hernán Robles, commercial manager, Valparaiso Sporting Club</p>
<p>SIS continues to expand its LATAM presence with strategic deals. Currently, the company delivers more than 35,000 live horse racing events each year, including some of the best races in Argentina, Chile, Mexico and Uruguay.</p>
