    <h1>Hard Rock Hotel Casino Las Vegas Restaurants At Hollywood Casino Casino Massachusetts Durango Casino</h1>

<p>I click on an email yesterday, rather late afternoon . Lucky Legends sends me an email saying" It's Appreciation Day, everything is on us" or on the house. This is June 5th 2023 around 7:00 to 7:30 pm.</p>
<p>So I clicked on it started playing, was winning, switch to different games on the website, slots only, with the same balance that was free to play.Now keep in mind it's "Appreciation Day".!! I'm so excited. Everything is on us. So I continue to play, and I continued to play and play only on the link of the email of appreciation day that they sent me. I played for a solid 6 to 8 hours. Ok after this point I'm ready to withdraw. I go to the homepage,I click the withdraw button. I put the amount of 3180.00 my winnings were 3,187.74 if I'm correct. So that would leave me 7.74 to continue to play on later. Ok after clicking the withdraw portion I'm only see Bitcoin withdrawal nothing US Currency. So continue to the bottom of the page to the chat portion of their website. I start chatting with Nancy, I ask Miss Nancy how do I make a withdrawal in US Currency, I told her that I only see bitcoin. She said" no that's always their, that I could withdraw in cash money" and she showed it text me what to do. Now I'm still having problems with this. I go back to the chat service they offer. It's Alex this time. This is where the fun starts, that being sarcastic. The bullshit starts. I'm sorry you can't do a withdrawal at this time, you haven't made any deposits. I shouldn't have had to made a deposit remember it's Appreciation Day!! And it goes from Alex to Sean Snow, yes I rude, yes I was mad as hell. And I'm sorry I'm right, my sign is Libra, I like to keep it right and legal. But they offer the email to me I play, I win and they owe me that money in the amount of 3187.74....do you know how excited I was to get that. My car just quit on me I had to junk it because it wasn't worth fixing. So everyone knows if you have no car, you what? You have no job. And after that you have no job, you have to move. Listen it was my lucky day the lord was looking out for me, and then you have these no good owners of this damn website that don't wanna pay. It's pathetic. Please whomever you are, help me get my money. I have saved everything I know to save with screenshots. So if you need anything, I more and happy to offer.</p>
<p>Thank you very much</p>

<p>P.S I've only literally played in that website 4 or 5 times. And that's it that I can see. I'm more of a Pulsz and Chumba girl</p>
<p>They are fair and the pay.</p>
