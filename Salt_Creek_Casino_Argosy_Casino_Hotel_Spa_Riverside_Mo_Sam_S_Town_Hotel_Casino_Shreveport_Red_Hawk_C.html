    <h1>Salt Creek Casino Argosy Casino Hotel Spa Riverside Mo Sam S Town Hotel Casino Shreveport Red Hawk C</h1>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>My card was having visa issues and wouldn't let me deposit funds so I used my friend's card to deposit, fully unaware that I was supposed to do this. I have multiple casino accounts and have never at any point committed any wrong doings.</p>
<p>The first deposit was excepted by betfred following that 5x deposits totalling around 6 thousand.</p>
<p>I ended up winning 7500 which I requested a withdrawal as I normally would, withdrawal was exsepted and received funds the next day.</p>
<p>Still unaware of any problems as why would 5 x deposits and a security checked withdrawal all be excepted.</p>
<p>The next day using the funds I'd won and been paid out I deposited around 21000 in approximately 8xdeposits and ended up banking 28000.</p>
<p>It wasn't until I withdrew that I was informed that my account had to have security before withdrawal could be processed ( still unaware of any issue)</p>
<p>Am i right in saying after reading through terms that betfred do allow 3rd party card transactions if pre approved.</p>
<p>My depositing multiple times and withdrawing isn't that excepting a 3rd partys card.</p>
<p>I wouldn't of deposited any further funds if I wasn't led to believe that there wasn't an issue.</p>
<p>Making over 20000 worth of deposits over multiple transactions and nothing was flagged up as fraudulent</p>
<p>If my deposits and withdrawal weren't exsepted in the first instance I would of never gone on to redeposit multiple times the following day.</p>
<p>After a week of providing the information they required they closed my account stealing the 28000 I had in my account.</p>
<p>Not at any point have they tried to contact the card holder or contact the bank regarding any thing fraudulent.</p>
<p>I submitted 2 complaints with no response as they have stated they will not talk to me .</p>
<p>I really don't know what to do next as I must have a case to get my deposits back they can't just take all my money which is all they are interested in and not bothered regarding fraud.</p>
<p>Really would like some advice please as feel like I've been wrongly treated.</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>
<p>Simon mc<strong>*</strong></p>
