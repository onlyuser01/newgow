    <h1>Casino Rockford Il Bonusblitz Casino Hilton Ponce Golf Casino Resort Casino In Dallas Hinkley Grand</h1>

<p>Playmaker is two for two as the company previously announced the acquisition of TNN, a Canadian-focused hockey media group. Playmaker’s next king-making move is down in Latin America with the company focusing on Grupo SuperPoker, a Brazilian media group that runs online poker websites, streaming services, and various other assets.</p>
<p>The deal is estimated at $4.3 million of which $1.8 million will be paid in cash and some $1.5 million will come in the form of newly-issued Playmaker common shares. Another $1 million worth is contingent on SuperPoker achieving pre-agreed results.</p>
<p>There is also the opportunity to add further bonuses on sales that are worth more than $800,000. SuperPoker is a leading media providing an extensive library of high-quality video and editorial content for poker players and fans in Brazil.</p>
<p>The country, which is one of the largest poker markets in the world, has allowed SuperPoker to establish its footprint. The team consists of 15 experienced gaming-related context experts who operate out of São Paulo, Brazil.</p>
<p>Obtaining Strong Poker Assets in LatAm</p>
<p>SuperPoker is also the official streaming partner for a number of prominent poker events, name PokerStars Players Championship, World Series of Poker – Brazil Circuit, European Poker Tour, and others. Playmaker has Futbol Sites, its subsidiary in the region, in charge of operations in Latin America, including the newly-acquired assets from SuperPoker.</p>
<p>SuperPoker has been able to generate 15 million annual visits and engages with 1.25 million unique visitors across its portfolio of sites. Moving forward, Playmaker will rely on its namesake monetization platform, Playmaker Bench, to drive revenue through the SuperPoker portfolio. Playmaker CEO Jordan Gnat commented on this partnership and said:</p>
<p>“Playmaker is building an ecosystem of engaged fans and this overlap provides our fans with additional content to enjoy, and provides our betting and advertising clients with another avenue to reach their target audiences. Brazil is a key market for us and we will continue to focus on it.” Playmaker CEO Jordan Gnat</p>
<p>SuperPoker owner Igor Trafane is a known face in the Brazilian gaming landscape. He owns numerous assets, including H2 Club, BSOP, PAPT, and Flush Tour to name a few. He is confident that the tie-up with Playmaker is the right move forward for the company, Trafane explained and pointed out to his relationship with the company chief executive:</p>
<p>“I have known Jordan for many years from his days at Stars Group and we have strong mutual respect and admiration for each other, and now this opportunity allows us to work together again as partners. .” SuperPoker owner Igor Trafane</p>
<p>Trafane argued that for his business group to progress, it would need a strategic relationship for the future, the type that Playmaker can deliver.</p>
