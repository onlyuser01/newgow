    <h1>Coeur D Alene Casino Resort Hard Rock Hotel Casino Paradise Road Las Vegas Nv Isle Of Capri Casino H</h1>

<p>Paid with Ethereum to top-up my in-game balance in ACR however I didn't get the Funds,I've provided 2 screenshots.</p>
<p>Screenshot 1-Both Sender Ethereum address and the Receiver Address.</p>
<p>Screenshot 2-Shows the Hash transcation and how much money was sent.</p>
<p>I want to add that I also marked in the Transaction information the time and date that the money was delivered to ACR wallet and which is identical to the time I've made the deposit request through ACR software.</p>
<p>also I was able to see that the funds are sitting in that address that was generated by ACR software,want to mention that I've never had this issues with BTC deposit/withdraw through ACR,always went smooth and fast.</p>
<p>as the Support asked me I've provided both screenshots that prove my payment and transfer of the money to the address of ACR.</p>
<p>not sure where the Team and if they really handling and taking care of it,hope they sort it out and making sure that the Ethereum payment option is really safe and secure.</p>
