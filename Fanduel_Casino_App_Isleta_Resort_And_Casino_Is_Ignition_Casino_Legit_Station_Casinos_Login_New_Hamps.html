    <h1>Fanduel Casino App Isleta Resort And Casino Is Ignition Casino Legit Station Casinos Login New Hamps</h1>

<p>I've made 10 BTC deposits with this casino and have a 'gold' membership level with them. I have made one withdrawal of $50. They have a section where you can claim a promotion out of a list and occasionally they will have a free spin promotion among them.</p>
<p>I claimed a free spin promotion of 50 spins. After the spins, I had a small amount of winnings. I can't recall exactly, but the playthrough was only about $350 so it was likely $7 to $10...somewhere in that range. I got lucky and cleared the playthrough and had $100.04 and their max cash out on the free spins was $100, so I stopped spinning since I was already at the maximum I could possibly withdraw with the playthrough completed.</p>
<p>I requested the payout on 08/25/2022. They say the turn around is 2 to 4 business days. I waited that amount of time, then began attempting to contact support when it remained in pending status.</p>
<p>The support number goes to voicemail, so I tried chat support. I soon found that the majority of the time, no one would ever respond in chat. Sometimes if I waited in the chat for several hours, I would eventually have someone respond to me. One such time, I was told that it would be paid the following day which was a Wednesday. On Friday, I attempted contact again with no luck so I emailed them. No response.</p>
<p>Monday I tried again and someone jumped right in and the moment I stated my issue in a polite manner, they were spitting out specifics of my case, so I am assuming they knew of my situation and were prepared to tell me why I wasn't being paid.</p>
<p>They said that I had only wagered the required minimum to complete the playthrough, and that was against the rules and that I should have wagered more than the playthrough that they listed and automatically removed from the promotion once the playthrough had been wagered. I tried to explain to them that if what they listed as the minimum required wagering was lower than what they actually required, then that would by definition mean that what they have listed is not in fact the minimum required wagering. This appeared to be lost on them.</p>
<p>Then they proceeded to tell me that Jack thinks I am a 'bonus hunter' and that Jack would not tolerate that kind of rule violation. Jack was very upset with me because he only offered me those free spins in my 'claim promotion' area for entertainment purposes, and it was against the rules for me to have the audacity to use those free spins to win money, and then attempt to withdraw any of it.</p>
<p>I am not making any of this up. That's what they told me. They then said to wait, again, until Friday and then contact them in support chat to see what had been decided about this payout. I did so. The person in the chat this time said they didn't have any info about payouts and that kind of thing and couldnt help me with it.</p>
<p>They gave me an email address for someone and told me to contact them. I did so. No response. My payout is still pending.</p>
