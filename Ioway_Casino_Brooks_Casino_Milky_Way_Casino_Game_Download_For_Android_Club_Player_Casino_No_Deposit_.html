<p>Gemhalla review</p>
<p>Theme and Style</p>
<p>Gemhalla is a Norse-themed online slot game from BGaming. The slot combines elements of Norse Mythology, the Vikings, and popular mobile gaming mechanics.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>BGaming has opted for a really fun design with the Gemhalla slot games. Norse mythology can lend itself to more intense designs like the ones seen in Hacksaw Gaming’s Stormforged or slightly more playful ones like Vikings Go Berzerk from Yggdrasil. Gemhalla falls into the latter category.</p>
<p>Win with a Multiplier symbol</p>
<p>The game’s action takes place on a set of reels positioned in front of a mystical, glowing forest, with the symbols all being block-shaped. The symbols are made up of various pieces of imagery from Norse and Viking mythology, including a long boat, a Viking helmet, an axe, and more.</p>
<p>Gemhalla is also brought to life with the presence of Thor at the side of the reels. This isn’t the Thor you would encounter in Marvel movies, though, with the game opting for a more cartoonish and traditional take on God. Having 3D characters at the side of the reels is a popular feature in modern slots and has been utilized well by Hacksaw Gaming in games like Gronk’s Gems and Hand of Anubis.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>The action in the Gemhalla slot game takes place on six reels, each displaying five symbols. There are no paylines, with the slot using the popular pay anywhere mechanic. To land a winning combination, players need to land eight or more matching symbols anywhere across the grid.</p>
<p>Everything you need to control the game, including stake and autoplay options, are found on the control panel beneath the reels.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>Gemhalla makes use of the popular Cascading Wins mechanic. Whenever players land a winning combination, the symbols are removed from the grid, and more fall into their place. This continues until no new wins are formed.</p>
<p>A lot of the action in the Gemhalla slot game is based around the Multiplier symbols. These can land on the reels on any spin in the base game and the bonus round.</p>
<p>There are four types of symbols - Wooden display between x2 and x5, green display between x6 and x30, violet between x31 and x100, and striped display between x101 and x500.</p>
<p>Multipliers are added as randomized feature</p>
<p>If there is more than one multiplier, they are added together and added to the total win in the round during the base game.</p>
<p>Players can trigger the Gemhalla Free Spins round by landing four or more Scatter symbols. During the round, multipliers are accumulated together, which can lead to some of the biggest wins in the game.</p>
<p>15 Free spins are awarded for 4 Scatters</p>
<p>Depending on your location, the option to buy your way into the bonus rounds may be available.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>Gemhalla really grabbed our attention with its impressive maths model. The game has an RTP of 97.17%, which is comfortably above average.</p>
<p>This, combined with its high volatility, means it comes highly recommended by our slot strategy guide.</p>
<p>The maximum win in the game is 5,000x your stake.</p>
<p>Full paytable for the Gemhalla slot</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Gemhalla is a really fun online slot from BGaming. The slot is nicely designed and the presence of multipliers ensures that the base game is good to play. The fun really starts with the Free Spins bonus, with multipliers accumulating to offer big payouts. A big selling point for the slot is its exceptional RTP, which comes in at 97.17%.</p>
