<p>Under the terms of the new deal, announced Thursday, the company will operate a sportsbook location that has the potential to grow and become a sportsbook within a hotel. The new venue is located at 2700 New York Avenue NE in Washington, DC and according to Elys, will be managed along with M. Jones and Company, an organization described as a “DC Certified Business Enterprise.”</p>
<p>Michele Ciavarella, Elys’ executive chairman, said that the company is excited to join forces with T &amp; L Hospitality in Washington for the operation of this new location. He explained that the new venue has a strategic location considering it is at the border of DC and Maryland and can be accessed by customers from the two states.</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to partner with T &amp; L Hospitality to operate this exciting new venue in Washington, DC, and being situated along the border of DC and MD, makes this venue accessible to players from both states.“ Michele Ciavarella, executive chairman at Elys Game Technology</p>
<p>The New Outlet Is Expected to Offer Plenty of Amenities</p>
<p>The new retail sports betting location is planned to have what Elys described as an “express betting area” where visitors can use the company’s Build-Your-Bet mobile tool that enables them to walk in and scan a QR code that finalizes their wager. At the same time, the location would have a 4,9000-square-foot lounge as well.</p>
<p>Besides the sportsbook lounge, the retail betting location is planned to have an additional restaurant area of 6,990 square feet that would offer a bar, as well as a VIP area. According to Elys, the new retail sportsbook would offer plenty of convenient options for bettors that want to place a fast wager, as well as sports fans that may be interested in sticking around and socializing. Visitors that prefer to go by car would be able to use parking that can fit up to 200 vehicles.</p>
<p>Initially, the agreement between the two companies is for a term of two years from the start of the sports betting activities. However, this agreement can be extended two times for two years at a time. It is important to mention that prior to commencing the activity licensing is needed.</p>
<p>“We look forward to continuing our sportsbook expansion within restaurants and bars in DC and neighboring states over the coming months.“ added Ciavarella</p>
<p>Elys’ chairman explained that the new location further complements the company’s growth. Ciavarella pointed out that Elys has already gained positive momentum in DC and plans to keep it. Finally, he predicted that Elys will continue to expand by offering such convenient locations that help boost local businesses.</p>
