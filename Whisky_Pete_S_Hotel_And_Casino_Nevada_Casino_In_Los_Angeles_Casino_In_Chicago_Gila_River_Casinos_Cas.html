<p>Gaming Realms has extended its licensing partnership with Inspired Entertainment, a provider of retail, virtual sports, and iGaming products</p>
<p>Gaming Realms is known as a content developer of mobile-focused online casino content, which will now continue to work with Inspired Entertainment to create unique experiences across the board.</p>
<p>Third Slingo Title to Arrive as Result of Inspired Partnership</p>
<p>Thanks to this extended partnership, Gaming Realms will be able to add a new Slingo title to its ranks, after the success of Slingo Centurion and Slingo Reel King, with both games enjoying a strong reception and uptake by gaming audiences.</p>
<p>Moving forward, Gaming Realms will take the Gold Cash Freespins title and transform it into its proprietary Slingo game with both companies’ blessing. Inspired’s game is also deemed to be one of the most successful slots by the company, pulling strong engagement and retention with audiences in global markets.</p>
<p>Now, the game will get a revamped version that casts it in Gaming Realms’ Slingo likeness to create even more ways for fans of the game to engage. Gaming Realms CCO Gareth Scott welcome the opportunity to see his company continue adding to the acclaimed Slingo series:</p>
<p>Our partnership with Inspired has been hugely successful, with Slingo Centurion and Slingo Reel King being leading performers in both Europe and North America. Gaming Realms CCO Gareth Scott</p>
<p>Scott confirmed that the company was very much excited to have the opportunity to embark on a third title with Inspired and bring fresh experiences to the fore. Gaming Realms expects the upcoming to be just as well received as its predecessors.</p>
<p>Great Things Expected from New Slingo Title</p>
<p>Inspired Entertainment VP of interactive Claire Osborne was of a similar mind and welcomed the opportunity to strengthen its partnership with Gaming Realms. “We look forward to seeing the concept that the Gaming Realms team will put forward,” Osborne said.</p>
<p>Gaming Realms has been advancing its Slingo format at a good pace in the meantime. The company launched Slingo Cleopatra and Slingo SPACE INVADERS with TAITO Corporation, considerably extending the visibility of the unique game series.</p>
<p>As testimony to the company’s success in producing outstanding content, Gaming Realms rolled out its games with Sports Illustrated Casino in Michigan at the beginning of the month.</p>
