<p>BetMGM and the PGA TOUR signed a multi-year partnership yesterday.</p>
<p>BetMGM Now an Official Partner of The PGA TOUR</p>
<p>Yesterday, August 3, the PGA TOUR and BetMGM entered into a multi-year partnership. Under the deal BetMGM became an Official Betting Operator of the PGA TOUR. Under the partnership in the United States, BetMGM will have the right to use PGA TOUR marks, rights to advertise within TOUR media and TOUR partner platforms. By joining the TOUR’s Official Betting Operator program, BetMGM will also have access to video content and video rights, which will enable BetMGM Sportsbook platforms to create programs for betting before and after games. In addition, BetMGM will be able to distribute highlights to users who placed bets.</p>
<p>Currently, BetMGM is licensed for sports betting in seven U.S. states. Those are: Nevada, New Jersey, Mississippi, Colorado, Indiana, West Virginia and Michigan. But BetMGM’s plan is to expand to eleven states by the end of 2020. With that in mind, the PGA TOUR is highly popular on BetMGM’s platform. The mobile app by BetMGM is available for both iOS and Android. The mobile app features sports betting as well as the latest betting odds for the most popular sports around the globe.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the PGA TOUR features the best golf players around the world. The company headquartered in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida co-hosts more than 130 tournaments. Among those we find PGA TOUR, PGA TOUR Latinoamérica, PGA TOUR Champions, Korn Ferry Tour and more. All tournaments are organized as non-profit, which ensures the maximizing of charity fundraising. The PGA TOUR features the best golf players from 29 countries across the globe and is broadcasted in 212 countries. By now, the TOUR has raised more than $3 billion for charitable organizations.</p>
<p>BetMGM Chief Marketing Officer, Matt Prevost commented on the subject by saying: “We look forward to working with the PGA TOUR to integrate great experiences for BetMGM customers.” Prevost added that with the advanced betting technology by BetMGM and word-class competitions and iconic players by the PGA TOUR, the TOUR will advance on the stage of professional sports betting. However, this will also be beneficial for the entire betting industry, Prevost concluded.</p>
<p>PGA TOUR SVP of Media and Gaming, Norb Gambuzza commented on the topic by saying: “BetMGM is part of a premium brand that is deeply connected to golf through sponsorship of various PGA TOUR players and tournaments.” He added that with the power and resources by the BetMGM brand, the TOUR’s sports betting strategy will be accelerated. As a result of the partnership, the TOUR is going to reach new fans and engage current fans who like betting on golf.</p>
<p>Looking at last week, the PGA TOUR announced the deal with its first official partner DraftKings. Although the two companies had content and marketing deal from 2019, last week the deal expanded their partnership into a multi-year exclusive agreement.</p>
