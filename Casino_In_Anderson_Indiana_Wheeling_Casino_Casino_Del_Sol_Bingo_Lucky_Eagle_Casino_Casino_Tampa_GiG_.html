    <h1>Casino In Anderson Indiana Wheeling Casino Casino Del Sol Bingo Lucky Eagle Casino Casino Tampa GiG</h1>

<p>Gaming Innovation Group Inc. has announced a partnership extension with the prominent operator, focusing on the affiliate marketing compliance tool</p>
<p>Moving forward, bet365 will benefit from GiG Comply in helping with automated marketing messages and tracking. The tool is built to help scan the web for content, pages, and links, as well as “iGaming code red words” referring to advertising practices that can land operators in trouble with regulators.</p>
<p>GiG Comply to Help Strengthen Bet365’s Marketing Messaging</p>
<p>In most jurisdictions, gaming regulators hold companies accountable for the advertising and marketing practices employed by their affiliate partners. GiG Comply analyzes real snapshots from affiliate campaigns to ensure that operators are in control of promotional content and they can steer and protect the way their brands are being promoted.</p>
<p>The tool is both flexible and powerful, allowing operators to further customize the specific markers they are interested learning about and what they consider important. Bet365 is particularly well-poised to benefit from this partnership as the group is represented in more than one hundred countries worldwide and has a customer base of 90 million people.</p>
<p>This means that bet365 must be on top of what affiliate marketing campaigns there are about it and how it remains compliant with local regulatory expectations.</p>
<p>Commenting on this opportunity GiG Media chief marketing officer Jonas Warrer welcomed the opportunity to see the two companies strengthen their relationship and deliver on better synergies:</p>
<p>Extending our partnership with bet365, one of the leading names in the industry, is a worthwhile indication of the confidence it provides our partners in the affiliate market and the strength of the team we have in GiG Media. GiG Media chief marketing officer Jonas Warrer</p>
<p>Bet365 also welcomed this partnership extension and spoke highly of the significance of GiG Comply. “Their automated compliance solution is a valuable tool in helping to maintain a compliant affiliate program globally,” the spokesperson said.</p>
<p>Besides its GiG Comply tool, the company has been expanding rapidly across Europe, with a strong presence in the Baltics. The company successfully completed a trio of sportsbook platform integrations with William Hill, Mr Green, and Fenibet in Latvia. GiG has also obtained a license from the Swedish Gaming Authority, as it also seeks to remain a leading provider of solutions for the iGaming and sports betting sectors in the Nordics.</p>
