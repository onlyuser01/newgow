<p>Ohio is readying up to fire its sports gambling industry and things are already looking up, says the American Gaming Association</p>
<p>The state has done well in setting up its core infrastructure, argues Casey Clark, SVP of AGA. Ohio is on track to be the 32nd state to launch legal sports betting, too, and there are many local franchises that sports bettors would love to back.</p>
<p>Ohio’s Sports Gambling Industry Will Be Big</p>
<p>The state has issued licenses to around 1,000 restaurants, bowling alleys, and other facilities. Starting on January 1, any resident and visitor of Ohio who is at least 21 years of age will be able to bet up to $700 per week, part of the state’s broader ambitions to protect customers at all costs.</p>
<p>This is a measure spearheaded by Senator Niraj Antani who argues that the state is keen to make sure that people do not end up spending profligate amounts from the very start of betting operations, nor run into bad habits that could cost them dearly later down the road.</p>
<p>Kiosk betting will be limited to spreads, totals, moneylines, and parlays, which are pretty much the standard types of betting that other states support. According to AGA, Ohio will definitely drive a serious interest, with $9 billion wagered every year and another $63 million contributed as state and local taxes.</p>
<p>Some Forms of Gambling Still Blocked</p>
<p>Clark though emphasized that the problem of illegal gambling remains, with Americans spending half a trillion dollars on unlicensed and offshore operations. These operators hardly care for the well-being of consumers and pay no tax, Clark assured.</p>
<p>While Ohio is looking to set up its industry properly, not all events will be allowed to wager on. For example, the state has blocked high school sports from the viable gambling markets, making Ohio a bit of an outlier.</p>
<p>Another prohibited form of gambling is pre-recorded events, which usually include virtual sports. Events sponsored by primary or secondary schools where more than 50% of the athletes are under the age of 18 also are not viable betting markets.</p>
