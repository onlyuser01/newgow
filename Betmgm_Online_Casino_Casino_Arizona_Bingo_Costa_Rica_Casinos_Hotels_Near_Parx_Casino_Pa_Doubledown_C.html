<p>Katie Taylor will be walking out on the ring this weekend to defend her undisputed title against the latest contender, Jennifer Han. The pair will fight as the undercard of the Mauricio Lara and Josh Warrington Fight on Saturday, September 14.</p>
<p>Taylor is arguably the most famous female fighter. She has clocked in 18 fights and left each one unscathed with a perfect record. Her recent defeat of Natasha Jonas proved another reason to equate Taylor to some of the best female boxers of all time.</p>
<p>She is also going to take on even more ambitious opponents with a bout between here and seven-weight world champion Amanda Serrano already booked for 2022 if everything goes according to plan.</p>
<p>For that to happen, Taylor will have to overcome Han, who the latest contender is looking to secure a win against her. The Headingley Stadium will be hosting the fight before long and here are the odds and predictions about the upcoming fight.</p>

<p>Will Katie Tylor Bring It Home Again?</p>
<p>Katie Tylor is an undisputed boxer. While most female boxers don’t usually captivate the attention of fans, Tylor has been a great role model not just for female fighters, but for the world of boxing as a whole. She has gone undefeated in 18 bouts, an impressive feat that any athlete may once hope to achieve.</p>
<p>The odds post her at a tremendous (-4000) sure winner out of the Saturday bout and there are good reasons to believe that this is going to be indeed the case. Tylor doesn’t have the punching power, but she surely has grace and a fantastic overall fighting style.</p>
<p>She has a mix of victories that include six TKOs and numerous wins by decision. One of her most notable fights is against Delfine Persoon who is another titan in female boxing. Persoon was undefeated for 35 fights before walking against Tylor in 2019 and lost.</p>
<p>Of course, she won’t be able to underestimate Han who is also sporting a good track record, even though she has suffered a few more defeats on the whole.</p>
<p>Don’t Underestimate Jennifer Han in the Fight</p>
<p>Jennifer Han is given long, long odds at (+1600), although not so bad overall. She is an accomplished overall fighter with 18 wins to her name and three losses. Han started her career playing against not too many great opponents.</p>
<p>In fact, even in her late-career now, she hasn’t taken on any significant challenge on the face of it. She has certainly fought many experienced fighters, including Fatuma Zarika, and Liliana Martinez, but ultimately those fighters were never the best out there.</p>
<p>So, can Han make a splash against Tylor? The odds say definitely no and we are inclined to side with this. You may find the mode of victory bet to be a better market here, but whether Tylor can bring Han down via TKO is another matter altogether.</p>
