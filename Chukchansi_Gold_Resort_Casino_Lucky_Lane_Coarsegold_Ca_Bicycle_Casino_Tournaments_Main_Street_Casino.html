<p>The gambling regulator in the UK, the Gambling Commission (GC), announced an enforcement action against one operator earlier this week. On Thursday, the GC announced it suspended LEBOM Limited, trading as Lebom.app over a failure to integrate GAMSTOP, the safer gambling self-exclusion scheme.</p>
<p>Upon probing into Lebom's operations, the GC uncovered that it hasn't fully integrated GAMSTOP. Consequently, it decided to suspend it immediately as failure to integrate GAMSTOP represented a breach of licensing conditions. In addition, the gambling watchdog unveiled the launch of a review into Lebom's license under section 116 of the Gambling Act 2005.</p>
<p>"As of today LEBOM Limited, trading from lebom.app, has been immediately suspended from operating until the Commission is satisfied that the operator has fully integrated GAMSTOP," reads a statement released by the Gambling Commission on November 3, 2022.</p>
<p>The regulator's Executive Director of Operations, Kay Roberts, added: "GAMSTOP provides a crucial service for people who feel they are suffering gambling harm. It is simply unacceptable for any online operator to fail to integrate with the scheme."</p>
<p>The Commission urged Lebom to treat its customers fairly during the suspension and at the same time ensure that they are informed about any changes that may impact them. According to the GC, the suspension "does not prevent the operator from allowing consumers to access accounts and withdrawing funds."</p>
<p>The latest enforcement doesn't come as a surprise, considering that the self-exclusion scheme GAMSTOP is mandatory for all online gambling operators. This requirement was implemented by the Commission back in 2020 in an effort to protect consumers who may suffer from problem gambling and would like to self-exclude from the activity.</p>
<p>GAMSTOP is a self-exclusion solution that helps individuals control their online gambling. People that sign up with the program are restricted from accessing gambling apps or websites that are run by licensed gambling operators in Great Britain.</p>
<p>The service is free for the users and enables them to select a period for which they want to self-exclude. Unlike other gambling blockers, GAMSTOP is available for residents of within the UK only. Still, the program is effective and helps users restrict their access to gambling activities.</p>
<p>The latest enforcement action comes after in October, the GC issued a £672,829 fine against NSUS Limited over anti-money laundering (AML) and social responsibility breaches. Before that, late in August, the watchdog hit Spreadex with a £1.36m fine. Similar to the previous penalty, the sanction came after the GC uncovered social responsibility and AML failures. Again over AML and social responsibility breaches, earlier in August, the GC issued a staggering £17m ($19.3m) fine against Entain Group.</p>
