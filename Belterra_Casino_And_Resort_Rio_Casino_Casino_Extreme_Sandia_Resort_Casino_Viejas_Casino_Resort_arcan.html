    <h1>Belterra Casino And Resort Rio Casino Casino Extreme Sandia Resort Casino Viejas Casino Resort arcan</h1>

<p>Dear Alprince2001,</p>
<p>Thank you for your patience throughout the resolution process. I have been in direct contact with the casino representative and have received a thorough explanation of the situation.</p>
<p>Firstly, I want to emphasize the seriousness of gambling addiction and the need to address it appropriately. When a player informs the casino about their gambling problem, the casino should promptly close their account without the possibility of reopening. However, if the closure was for a different reason, it is common practice to reopen the account and welcome the customer back, as many closure requests, even permanent ones, are often due to temporary dissatisfaction or bad luck that can change over time.</p>
<p>In your case, account closure was questionable, as your conversation and requests for closure seemed to stem from a desire to receive a bonus rather than genuine gambling difficulties. Please refer to the screenshots below for reference.</p>
<p>While you did bring up a "gambling issue" in your discussion, taking into account the broader context of the conversation and your past communication history, I can comprehend why the casino team opted to reopen your account. They also recommended utilizing the deposit limit tool and asked you numerous questions in the process, which seems reasonable in this situation.</p>
<p>Concluding the information above, I am very sorry, but I believe you are not entitled to receive the refund, and I am forced to close your case.</p>
<p>You have every right not to agree with my opinion. An alternative option is to file an official complaint with the licensing authority of the casino. I may assist you with this process, and you can reach me at the email address provided below. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or require further assistance.</p>
<p>Best regards, Jozef</p>
