    <h1>Four Winds Casino Hartford Osage Casino Hotel Ponca City Hyatt Regency Lake Tahoe Resort Spa Casino</h1>

<p>The developer of classic slots, powering the growing online gambling sector, Stakelogic, announced the launch of a new thrilling and exclusive slot for Unibet, Kindred Group’s flagship brand. Earlier this week, the developer of iGaming content revealed details regarding Super8Wild, a new slot with a retro vibe and rewarding features. Stakelogic confirmed that the new exclusive slot game is expected to appeal to casual players and seasoned slots fans with its "thrilling gameplay and big win potential."</p>
<p>Players of Super8Wild can expect gameplay with three rows and four reels. However, the engaging fruit machine-themed slot grants players an option to expand the reels from four to 11 reels. Expanding the reels can also increase the game's paylines from 10 up to 45 active paylines, granting a chance for bigger wins. Super8Wild comes packed with additional features that further elevate the excitement and create an unforgettable experience.</p>
<p>Pierluigi Rinaldi, Kindred Group's Head of Gaming Business Development, explained in a statement that Stakelogic is already a trusted and valuable partner for the company within the market in the Netherlands. "Their content consistently resonates with our players, helping us solidify our status as the go-to destination for online casino enthusiasts," he added. Last but not least, Rinaldi pointed out: "Super8Wild is yet another exciting addition to our portfolio, and we can’t wait to see our players enjoy this exclusive title."</p>
<p>Jose Simon Kadala, Stakelogic's Head Account Manager, was similarly thrilled about the latest announcement. He explained: "Our suite of classic slots is hugely popular with players in core markets across the world and Super8Wild is a strong addition to our line-up." In conclusion, Kadala said: "It has been designed to deliver the nostalgia that draws in purist players with its traditional fruit machine set-up combined with the fruit symbols that land on the reels, but also to casual players seeking thrilling gameplay and plenty of big win potential."</p>
<p>Online players of Super8Wild that land three Crown symbols anywhere on adjacent reels can secure a Crown prize. The same functionality is available during the game's Super Stake feature but presented as a Mystery Prize.</p>
<p>As noted, the new game offers the iGaming provider's flagship bonus feature, Super Stake. The rewarding functionality enables the players to double their bet, increasing their chances of securing a bonus and hitting big wins.</p>
<p>Elevating the thrill and excitement further, Super8Wild brings a Star symbol which serves as a Wild. This symbol can substitute all other symbols while the base game is active. Players that land three Star symbols on a win line have a chance of securing a Star Prize.</p>
