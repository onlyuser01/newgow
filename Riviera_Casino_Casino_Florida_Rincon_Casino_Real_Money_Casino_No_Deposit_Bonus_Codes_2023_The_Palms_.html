<p>Fox Corporation has announced the promotion of Jeff Taylor to General Counsel alongside the appointment of Nicholas Trutanich, who will provide ethics advice and will deal with legal issues.</p>
<p>Jeff Taylor to Oversee Fox Corporation’s Legal Function</p>
<p>Yesterday, Fox Corporation announced the appointment of Jeff A. Taylor as General Counsel in charge of the company’s legal function. Taylor started his career at Fox in 2019 at the position of Executive Vice President and Chief Litigation Counsel.</p>
<p>Claudia Teran will serve as Executive Vice President and Corporate General Counsel, as well as General Counsel of FOX Sports. Both Taylor and Teran will be under the management of Chief Legal and Policy Officer Viet D Dinh. Taylor said:</p>
<p>“I look forward to contributing more broadly and deeply across the company while continuing to work with trusted colleagues and sharp legal minds like Claudia Teran and our business unit general counsels.”</p>
<p>On the other hand, Dinh expressed his confidence that Taylor’s legal matters and corporate governance expertise will help him lead successfully the company’s legal function.</p>
<p>Before becoming part of FOX, Taylor occupied the position of Deputy General Counsel and Chief Compliance Officer for General Motors Co. for more than three years. He was also General Counsel of Raytheon Integrated Defense Systems between 2010 and 2015. Taylor served as the United States Attorney for the District of Columbia from 2006 to 2009 as part of his 15 years of service in the federal government.</p>
<p>Other positions include Counselor to the Attorney General, Counsel to the United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary, and Assistant United States Attorney for the Southern District of California. Taylor has obtained a B.A. degree in history from Stanford University and a J.D. from Harvard Law School.</p>
<p>Former Nevada Attorney Nicholas Trutanich to Join Taylor’s Team</p>
<p>FOX also announced the appointment of Nicholas Trutanich as Executive Vice President and Chief Ethics &amp; Compliance Officer, part of Taylor’s team. Nicholas Trutanich was a top federal prosecutor in the state of Nevada under the administration of former President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Fox General Counsel Jeff Taylor said in a statement that Trutanich is a perfect addition to the team due to his gambling regulation expertise, while FOX continues its push into sports betting.</p>
<p>Trutanich will be the point of contact for law enforcement and regulators. In recent years, the broadcaster faced several high-profile lawsuits, including Smartmatic accusations of a false narrative about the 2020 elections. Other legal challenges include the alleged involvement of two Fox Sports executives in a bribery scheme of soccer officials in exchange for broadcasting rights.</p>
