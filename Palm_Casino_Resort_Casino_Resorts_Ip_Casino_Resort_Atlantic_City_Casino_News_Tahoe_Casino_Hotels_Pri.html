<p>Daily fantasy sports (DFS) operator PrizePicks announced an expansion of its portfolio of esports game titles today in a major step to becoming the premier fantasy esports operator in North America.</p>
<p>FPS Market Leader Position</p>
<p>PrizePicks added to its marketplace premier titles Call of Duty (CoD), Rocket League and Valorant to boost its offering of AAA titles Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) and League of Legends (LoL) already present on its platform and solidify its market position in the first-person shooter (FPS) gaming genre.</p>
<p>The addition of the 3 new game titles provides players at PrizePicks a range of play options unmatched by another DFS operator in North America, allowing them to use combinations between the five titles and execute player props, on one hand, while giving them access to multiple leagues in each sport, as for the regular season, so for secondary competitions, on the other.</p>
<p>“The more opportunities that esports fans have to engage with their favorite titles and franchises, the better it is for the industry. We were attracted to a partnership with PrizePicks in the first place because they have a vision not just to expand their platform but to create a better fan experience overall.” Stewart Tanner, Head of Partnerships, Ghost Gaming</p>
<p>Expansion of Partnership with Ghost Gaming</p>
<p>PrizePicks and Ghost Gaming initially entered into a strategic partnership in November 2020, following the growth of esports on PrizePicks’ platform in the early months of the year with titles such as iRacing and NBA2K League due to the disruption to regular sports from the coronavirus outbreak.</p>
<p>“Esports was an important offering for us in early 2020 when the pandemic shut everything down, but not only did our monthly esports handle stay strong when the NBA, NFL and college sports returned, it actually grew in unison with our traditional sports over those last six months of the year.” Adam Wexler, CEO, PrizePicks</p>
<p>PrizePicks, which entered esports in 2019 via a partnership with SMITE Pro League, and the cutting edge franchise which fields teams in Rocket League and Valorant, are planning on collaborating on a number of initiatives scheduled to debut later in 2021.</p>
<p>“These are franchises with fan bases that span decades in some cases and they’ve historically been underserved by sportsbooks and fantasy platforms. We’re thrilled to offer this variety of playable options.” Adam Wexler, CEO, PrizePicks</p>
<p>The latest expansion of esports game titles on PrizePicks’ platform rounded March as a significant month for the largest independently-owned DFS operator. By the middle of the month, PrizePicks announced it entered Alabama to establish presence across 31 US jurisdictions, while later on signed an agreement with Prizeout to boost withdrawal options for its players by adding digital currencies.</p>
