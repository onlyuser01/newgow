<p>Join the Colorful Slime Party Gooeyness</p>
<p>Fans of colorful slots will appreciate the gooeyness of Angel, Devil. And Wizard, the three special slime party guests inviting you to join them for the sweet, colorful madness of the grid.</p>
<p>With symbols that pay anywhere on the reels, wilds, free spins, and a volatility of 98.10%, the game that aims to put a new spin on a sugary theme has plenty to offer.</p>
<p>The Candy Cane wild symbols are not only helpful at generating matching combinations, but they can also occasionally feature multipliers. In case multiple wilds are seen landing on the grid, the value of each of these symbols will be added together.</p>
<p>When a player lands a minimum of three slime King Scatters, they receive up to 30 Free Spins. During the Free Spins rounds, all wilds with attached multiplier values are accumulated, leading to a massive maximum win capped at 48,900x.</p>
<p>Players can also opt for the Buy Feature and jump straight into the free spins action by purchasing the round.</p>
<p>Mixing Proprietary Mathematics with a Vibrant Theme</p>
<p>Habanero’s head of corporate communications, Toni Karapetrov, spoke about their freshet launch, calling it a “sugary adventure filled with multipliers, Free Spins, and a highly lucrative maximum win” which should cater to the needs of anyone with a sweet tooth.</p>
<p>He also mentioned the vibrant theme of the game, emphasized by their proprietary mathematics, anticipating the game to record resounding success across their regular player base as well as throughout their expanded network of operator partners.</p>
<p>Slime Party, which is expected to quickly become a player-favorite, helps Habanero continue an impressively lucrative year with numerous partnerships inked with important operators in Europe, with names like Betway, Betsson, and Snaitech on the list.</p>
