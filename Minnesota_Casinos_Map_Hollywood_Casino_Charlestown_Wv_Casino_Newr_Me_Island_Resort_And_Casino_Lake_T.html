<p>The world's fastest-growing, fully licensed crypto casino, Roobet, has announced that it was recognized by the prestigious Malta iGaming Excellence Awards (MIGEA). The company confirmed on Monday that the event recognized it with awards in two categories, a statement reveals.</p>
<p>A representative for Roobet commented on the achievement saying: "None of this would be possible without our Kangaroos who work tirelessly to ensure that Roobet remains a leader in online entertainment." Additionally, the representative explained that the awards recognize the creativity, passion and dedication of the company's team of experts that played a key role in securing the latest achievements.</p>
<p>Highlighting that Roobet anticipates further growth and expansion via new projects, the representative said in conclusion: "We are immensely grateful to our incredible community for their ongoing support, trust, and loyalty."</p>
<p>At MIGEA the company was recognized with the awards: Best Start-up Company of the Year and Best Online Casino Operator of the Year. The first award highlights Roobet's forward-thinking, and the company said that it is delighted to secure the recognition that is a testament to its team's dedication to improving the online gambling vertical.</p>
<p>What's more, Roobet revealed that it was also proud to secure the Best Online Casino Operator of the Year award, which reaffirms its commitment to the highest standards for the gambling sector. The prestigious recognition, the company said, highlights its dedication to delivering fun, engaging and safe entertainment to its players.</p>
<p>The announcement comes after in April, Roobet unveiled a new content partnership with the supplier of innovative iGaming products and content, Endorphina. Under the terms of the collaboration, the cryptocurrency-focused online casino gained access to cutting-edge games from Endorphina.</p>
<p>At the time of the announcement, Robert Harutyunayn, Endorphina's Business Development Manager, shared his excitement. "I am beyond excited about our latest collaboration with such an important brand within the iGaming business. We at Endorphina are proud to be partnering up with Roobet, an industry-leading crypto casino," he said.</p>

<p>Before that, earlier this year, Roobet confirmed it signed a partnership with Snoop Dogg, the famous rapper and music icon. That deal saw the musician become a Chief Ganjaroo for the fast-growing crypto-focused online casino.</p>
