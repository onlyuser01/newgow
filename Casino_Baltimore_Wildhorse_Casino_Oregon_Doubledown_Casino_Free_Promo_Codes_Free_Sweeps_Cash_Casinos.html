    <h1>Casino Baltimore Wildhorse Casino Oregon Doubledown Casino Free Promo Codes Free Sweeps Cash Casinos</h1>

<p>After some deposits i got lucky and won up to around 11 000 euro. Without bonus and not using VPN (as i read others get accused for)</p>
<p>At 27 apr my docs docs were approved. Drivers licens, proof of adress, creditcard and bank account. Then the process started (as i read many others been through too).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Withdrawl on 1000 euro made 27april (denied 28 april)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New withdrawl on 500 euro made 28 april (denied 29 april)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2 New withdrawl on 500 euro each made 29 april (denied 29 april)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>29 april, gets an email that i need to send them a selfie when i hold my drivers licence</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>o 29 april, sends them the selfie. Gets it approved.</p>
<ul>
<li>2 of may, makes a new withdrawl 1000 euro</li>
</ul>
<p>o Withdrawl denied</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Between 1 may-5 may i made 5 or 6 withdrawls on 1000 euro that gets cancelled</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2 may, asks for mobile registration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2-4 may i sends some emails regarding that we have a family subscprition and that the phonenr is in my wifes name.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>4 may- uploads a phonebill from the operator were the nr is registrated. Approved.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>5 may gets an email that my withdrawl is cancelled and that the account is closed for withdrawls. The account is temporarily suspended and the account will be reviewed by the relevant department for security reasons. They inform that they canÂ´t give me an exactly time frame.</p>
<p>11 may they say they have to make further investigations.</p>
<p>Now its been 2 weeks and after reading others having the same problem i really need help with this. Know MGA or ADR Madre is another way but hope not having to go that way.</p>
<p>Played at many casinos but havent had this problems before. Verification normally goes with one day. I know KYC is important but this feel like something else. Read so many that seems to have problem with the verification process at the casinos in the same group.</p>
<p>Can provide screenshots/docs if needed.</p>
