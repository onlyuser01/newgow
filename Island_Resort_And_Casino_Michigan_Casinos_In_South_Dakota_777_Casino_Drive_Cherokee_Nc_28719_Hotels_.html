<p>The new collaboration is expected to elevate the experiences for the Dutch customers of the popular brand</p>
<p>The award-winning digital business-to-business (B2B) platform and service provider, catering to the online gambling sector, Shape Games, announced a new partnership with the Dutch online sportsbook, casino and Entain Group-owned operator, BetCity. The duo joined forces earlier this week in an effort to deliver thrilling experiences for BetCity’s customers in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the new collaboration, Shape Games agreed to power the development and launch of BetCity’s new native mobile applications. Those applications are going to be available for Android, as well as iOS, and are expected to elevate the experience for sports betting and online casino customers.</p>
<p>Per the new agreement, BetCity’s new applications will leverage the innovative and engaging technology provided by Shape Games. Ultimately, the new partnership is expected to deliver thrilling and engaging options not only for sports bettors but for users that like online casino gambling.</p>
<p>BetCity Is Delighted to Join Forces with Shape Games</p>
<p>Léon Voogt, BetCity’s product director, shared his excitement about the new collaboration. He pointed out that it is thrilling to see the brand’s application unite iGaming and sports betting options. “This made the development process a challenge, but with Shape Games, we found an excellent partner who helped us bring this vision to life,” added Voogt. Finally, he praised Shape Games for their innovative technology and predicted that the collaboration will bring benefits to BetCity and the company’s clients.</p>
<p>“We are excited to finally launch our app into the wider world. An app has been on our wish list at BetCity right from the start, and we’re thrilled that it’s now complete! It was important for us to be able to offer our entire product portfolio in one app, including a sportsbook, casino, and live casino – all in one place.“ Léon Voogt, product director at BetCity</p>
<p>In October 2021, Entain Group-owned BetCity was among the first brands to launch its services within the Dutch iGaming market. Earlier this month, powered by Shape Games, the brand launched its online sportsbook and iGaming app, an achievement that marked an important milestone.</p>
<p>The recent launch came after last month, the Netherlands implemented changes to the online gambling sector, requiring iGaming software and content providers to hold a license and restricting advertising. Despite the changes to the sector and the challenges they may bring, BetCity and Shape Games remain optimistic about their growth in the Dutch gambling market and confirmed plans to deliver thrilling, safe and responsible experiences for players in the country.</p>
