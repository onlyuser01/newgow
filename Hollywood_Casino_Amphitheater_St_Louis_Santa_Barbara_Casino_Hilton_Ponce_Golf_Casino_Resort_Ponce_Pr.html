    <h1>Hollywood Casino Amphitheater St Louis Santa Barbara Casino Hilton Ponce Golf Casino Resort Ponce Pr</h1>

<p>I even understand you very dear Radka 🕊🌿</p>
<p>Please feel hugged &amp; my sincere condolences 😔 it's always very difficult for the bereaved, unfortunately I really understand that too well..</p>
<p>It's always bad to lose a person you love because I think this pain never gets less and you think about it every day and get calmer and calmer with age because life really makes you tired..</p>
<p>For my 23rd birthday I really wanted my parents to come visit me (I was living in Austria/Salzburg at the time) and wish I had never asked for this as they were in a car accident that day and both passed away....each night and to this day it torments me so much inside I can't describe it.. 😔</p>
<p>If I hadn't asked for anything, they would still be alive today... that eats me up so much that sometimes you really despair..</p>
<p>I even believe that I am ill with this disease because my soul has become ill over the years and thus my body.. That many people think and all that makes you really ill.</p>
<p>I digress again, sorry. 🙂</p>
<p>What I want to say is simply that life is so short that you should really enjoy the little moments, especially if you have a family and children of your own 🌿🕊</p>
<p>And I bet even if I don't know you personally that your grandpa is incredibly proud of his little grown-up Radka ❤️🍀🕊</p>
<p>I think the digital age is for young people. 🙂</p>
<p>I was recently in Austria/Vienna in a restaurant where we were literally served by a robot s: the kids liked it but to be honest I didn't like it that much. 🙂</p>
<p>The world seems to be evolving faster than heart &amp; mind can understand 😛</p>
<p>I don't want to seem pushy but I really love you and I'm glad you exist ❤️</p>
<p>In today's time to get help without consideration is so rare that I appreciate the unbelievable fact that you help so many people with their problems every day.</p>
<p>Thanks for that 🕊</p>
<p>I wish you all the best ❤️</p>
