    <h1>Boomtown Casino Hotel New Orleans Andromeda Casino Slots Casino Rhythm Casino Davenport Casino Yonke</h1>

<p>The Casino GG.Bet does not pay out because allegedly documents are not complete. But I have sent everything and also checked that it is legible. They always send me the same announcement. I've never had such bad problems verifying myself.</p>
<p>I have a VIVID app where I have a virtual credit card and IBAN, which I have to clearly understand.</p>
<p>I contacted the support and they don't really help.</p>
<p>I get that all the time even though I sent everything.</p>
<p>Dear Customer,</p>
<p>To complete your identification process, please re-create the following photos according to our comments:</p>
<p>1) Photo or scanned images of the bank card you are using 434970 <strong>*</strong>* 9744. On the front of the card you can hide some numbers so that only the first 6 and the last 4 numbers are visible. The CVV2 code must be hidden on the back of the card (it is the three-digit number that is printed in the signature field). First and last name, if shown on your card, must not be obscured. You have to take this picture. Please take photos of the front (front) and back (back).</p>
<p>2) Photo or scanned image of your ID and the front of the bank card you are using 434970 <strong>*</strong>* 9744. You have to take this picture. Please take a screenshot of the map if it is virtual.</p>
<p>3) Photo of your document (the document must be opened) and your bank card 434970 <strong>*</strong>* 9744 in your hands near your face. Please note that all elements listed must be completely in the picture and all data must be legible. Please take a screenshot of the map if it is virtual.</p>
<p>Please do not change the subject of this e-mail and send the photos as an attachment in the reply to this e-mail. You will receive a response by email within three days. We thank you for your patience and cooperation.</p>
