<p>The Future iGaming Industry Will Look Much Different than That of Today</p>
<p>When the freezer first appeared, everyone questioned how they survived without it. When the microwave oven first appeared, everyone asked how they survived without it. When smartphones and tablets first arrived on the scene, the same question was asked. In all of these instances, and more, the technology is now taken for granted. The next generation of iGaming is going to follow the same pattern, and now is the time that the transition is taking place. Tech companies like BOTS, and even gaming operators like Entain, are getting in on the Metaverse concept.</p>
<p>BOTS Plans Metaverse Launch</p>
<p>Global technology company BOTS is planning to launch a Metaverse based in Vegas. The blockchain solutions company announced the rollout after making a strategic investment into XR Casino. This technology company specializes in Extended Reality cross-technology casino games, XR gaming development solutions, and non-fungible tokens (NFT) within the iGaming and sports betting ecosystems.</p>
<p>XR Casino is currently developing a patent-pending platform, according to the company. It plans to use AI and Blockchain, Mixed Reality (MR), and Augmented Reality (AR) technologies to provide players with new gaming experiences as well as value-added services.</p>
<p>BOTS was the first corporate investor in XR Casino. It will use its technology to launch AR and MR casinos and casino GaaS (games as a service) in its upcoming metaverse based out of Vegas.</p>
<p>XR Casino completed its MVP versions of its first games, roulette and blackjack, in 2021. It is now ready to launch its social casino games in 2022 and NFT store in 2022.</p>
<p>Metaverse No Longer Just a Concept</p>
<p>Simon Rubin, CEO of BOTS, stated that XR Casino’s proprietary technology allows anyone to enjoy the immersive casino gaming experience of the Metaverse using an AR-enabled smartphone or AR/MR glasses. AR is a key technology in connecting people to the Metaverse. BOTS is investing in XR Casino to be able to bring players together using AR, MR and VR in its upcoming Vegas.mv Metaverse.</p>
<p>Brandessence Market Research published a report in April 2021 estimating that the global VR market will reach $52.7 billion by 2025. Mordor Intelligence’s recent research also revealed that the extended reality market will see a healthy CAGR exceeding 62.67% over the 2021-2026 forecast period.</p>
<p>Extended reality refers to immersive technologies such as AR, VR and MR, or other future realities that technology advancement may bring. Accenture’s survey found that 80% of business executives think it is important to use XR solutions to bridge physical distances during employee engagement. It is becoming increasingly important to reduce the distance between people.</p>
