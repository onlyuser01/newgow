    <h1>Best Casino In Lake Tahoe Coconut Creek Seminole Casino Prima Play Casino Southpoint Casino Las Vega</h1>

<p>I won $70 from my first time visit ever at the casino from a 25 no deposit free spin ..won $68( which has been listed on my transactions as bonus deposits - not free spin)the $321 that I won was requested for a $300 withdraw.. I was told to verify account before withdraw request. I have been trying to get verified for over 2 weeks. I have emailed the casino multiple times. I have money from a no deposit bonus I would like to withdrawal. I would gladly make a deposit if necessary and would like to continue to play with this casino. I have sent in all documents they said we're required. Checked status of verification a week later to be told all bonus winnings were removed from account and the reason for this was stated-"that I had 5 other accounts using multiple bonuses - all accounts sharing same name- address-IP address -&amp;ID please help.— I wrote them several times stating that if you are going to take All my bonus winning that would be only the $68 from the free spins)-I need help - I asked for the proof of these 5 other accounts since I am the only one who owns my id — I only have one account — I have only used one bonus - &amp; that it would be only fair— my response from yabby banking was one sentence that says " we are very sorry but we must follow the rules there is nothing we can do"</p>
<p>please please get this resolved</p>
