<p>Power of Thor review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>This slot is themed around Norse mythology, especially the iconic god Thor.</p>
<p>Set in a breathtaking Scandinavian mountain scene, this game is full of memorable Norse characters. Ornate armour and thick braids adorn the friendly heroes as they look out from their reels.</p>
<p>With a little luck, these gods will be in a giving mood as the reels spin. Players will enjoy losing themselves in the chilly air and whimsical magic of this ancient world.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The soundtrack has an epic mood with plenty of bells and drama. It will resemble the climactic moment of a fantasy story when the hero is tested. A series of bird songs remind players of the open air natural setting.</p>
<p>From a capable viking goddess to a bearded viking warrior, the reels are filled with friendly characters that look like they are fresh out of a Pixar film.</p>
<p>The most intimidating character is, of course, Thor himself. wWith his golden beard and hand clutching a bolt of lightning. Players will be left with no doubt that he is the god to impress.</p>
<p>The backdrop behind the reels is a fairytale Scandinavian countryside. With evergreen trees and engraved stones, players will get a sense of the chilly and magical location.</p>
<p>Overall, the colourful animation and dramatic music of this game reinforce theadd a great mythical mood.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Power of Thor uses the Megaways system, which randomises the number of symbols in each reel with every spin.</p>
<p>Wins are awarded for matching symbols in adjacent reels from left to right.</p>
<p>This game uses a cascade feature, meaning that symbols that are part of winning combinations vanish after paying out. This leaves their positions open for new symbols to fall into. These cascades continue until there are no more winning combinations.</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter and Hammer symbols. The Wild symbol only lands on reels 2, 3, and 5 and only on the top row.</p>
<p>The Hammer symbol will only appear on the top row of reels 2, 3, and 5 and it will always take two horizontal positions.</p>
<p>The Hammer feature is triggered when the Hammer symbol fully lands on the top row. This initiates all the symbols on the reels below to transform into Wild symbols. The Hammer symbols continues to have this transformative effect if it is moved by cascades.</p>
<p>The Scatter symbol appears on all the reels. Landing 4 or more Scatter symbols triggers the Free Spins feature with 10 free spins. Players are awarded more free spins for landing more Scatters of up to 30 free spins for landing 9 Scatters.</p>
<p>If players are awarded between 10 and 18 free spins, they’ll have the option to gamble to win even more free spins.</p>
<p>If players land 3 Scatters during the free spins feature, they’ll be awarded 4 more free spins.</p>
