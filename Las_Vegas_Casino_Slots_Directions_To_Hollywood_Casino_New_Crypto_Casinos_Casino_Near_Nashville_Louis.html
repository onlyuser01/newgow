<p>A week after PointsBet announced its plans to launch iGaming in New Jersey, the Australian-based gaming company has found a partner for live table gaming.</p>

<p>On Thursday, Evolution Gaming announced PointsBet tabbed the Swedish-based developer to provide table games for when it launches its online casino product in the US.</p>
<p>Sebastian Johannisson, Evolution Gaming’s chief commercial officer, said in a statement the company will be able to offer PointsBet a mix of classic games, online poker, and “game show” games.</p>
<p>PointsBet will have the option of exclusively branded dedicated tables and environments, should they require these,” he said.</p>
<p>PointsBet has been in the US for two years as a mobile sports betting provider in Indiana, Iowa, and New Jersey. PointsBet also has a retail sportsbook in Iowa. However, it has plans for a massive expansion, as it has agreements in place to roll out in Colorado, Illinois, and Michigan.</p>
<p>Evolution Expanding</p>
<p>Like PointsBet, Evolution is in the middle of a growth spurt in the US.</p>
<p>It opened its first live gaming studio in New Jersey two years ago. Another studio is under construction in Pennsylvania. It’s slated to start offering games later this year. In addition, there are plans for a studio in Michigan to open next year.</p>
<p>Michigan is where PointsBet plans to launch its first iGaming product through its 20-year partnership with the Lac Vieux Desert Public Enterprise and Finance Commission. Last week, PointsBet announced it will serve as an iGaming skin for Twin River Management Group once it completes the purchase for Bally’s Atlantic City Hotel and Casino.</p>
<p>PointsBet said it plans to be live in New Jersey with iGaming during the first half of 2021.</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to partner with Evolution Gaming to launch Live Casino technology in US jurisdictions, where we plan to offer our proprietary online casino platform. The addition of Evolution Live Casino extends the appeal of PointsBet’s premium product in the rapidly growing US market.”</p>
<p>Evolution Through Acquisition</p>
<p>Evolution Gaming was created 14 years ago, and the company has eight live gaming studios for its clients that offer online gaming across the globe.</p>
<p>Its list of clients includes DraftKings, Rush Street Interactive, Paddy Power, PokerStars, 888, and William Hill.</p>
<p>Two months ago, publicly traded Evolution Gaming, which is listed on the Nasdaq Stockholm exchange, announced a deal to buy another online casino gaming company. It plans to buy another Swedish casino game developer, NetEnt, in a deal valued at $2.1 billion.</p>
<p>NetEnt, also listed on the Nasdaq Stockholm exchange, focuses on slot games. Last year, it won Casino.org’s 2019 Best New Slot Game, for its Narcos.</p>
<p>Last month, CEO Martin Carlesund said in Evolution Gaming’s mid-year interim report that the purpose behind the deal was to expand its offerings and become the leading supplier around the world.</p>
<p>“To add NetEnt’s leading slots to Evolution’s strong Live Casino offering will create a very strong market position significantly faster, especially in the USA, and together, with clear synergies, we believe this to be a strategic and highly attractive acquisition,” he said.</p>
