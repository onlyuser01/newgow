<p>Playtech Content Live on bet365 in New Jersey</p>
<p>Thursday, August 6, the leading gambling technology provider Playtech said that it launched casino content in New Jersey with its long term partner bet365. Following the launch, award-winning casino content by Playtech is now live on bet365.</p>
<p>Among the titles we find the best-performing Playtech classics like Great Blue, White King and Frankie Dettori’s Magic Seven. Although this is the first entry of Playtech on the U.S. gambling market, the company vowed to sign with more partners in New Jersey in the months to come.</p>
<p>Looking back in June, Playtech received approval from the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement (NJDGE) to launch casino products with bet365. The launch was facilitated with the help of a transactional waiver, which allowed Playtech content to be launched by bet365. Back in June, Playtech CEO, Mor Weizer deemed the regulator’s approval as a “major milestone” and said that the U.S. market is a strategic location for the company.</p>
<p>The New Jersey gaming market has seen a rapid growth with quite a few new entries in the past months. Back in May, the giant Scientific Games (SG) teamed up with ReelPlay in order to enter the Garden State’s gaming market.</p>
<p>The Market Launch Is a Significant Moment for Playtech</p>
<p>Playtech Chief Operating Officer, Shimon Akad said that the entry in the New Jersey market is a significant moment for the company and its development in the U.S.</p>
<p>“Launching Playtech’s software in the US is a landmark, and we are very pleased to be taking this step with one of our most trusted partners in bet365,” added Akad</p>
<p>He continued by saying that more titles and content is expected to launch in the upcoming weeks and months. Akad did not miss to say that the launch represents a prime example of the company’s commitment to partnering with leading operators in order to bring high-quality products and services to new growing markets.</p>
<p>“We’re excited to partner with Playtech in order to expand our content offering to the US market,” said a spokesperson for bet365. Furthermore, the spokesperson added that bet365 is the first to launch content of Playtech, which offers distinctive gaming features on its platform. In conclusion, the spokesperson said that bet365 is looking forward towards developing the solid partnership and growing on the gaming market.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in Colorado, bet365 signed another strategic partnership with Century Casinos. The two companies teamed up in May this year. But prior to launching in the Centennial State’s market, bet365 will need to apply for a license from the state regulator.</p>
