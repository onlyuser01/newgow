<p>Zeus vs Hades: Gods of War review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Zeus vs Hades: Gods of War is a slot themed around Ancient Greek Mythology.</p>
<p>Its central story is a battle between Zeus and Hades, with the slot allowing players to flick between two separate gameplay modes.</p>
<p>Choose between Zeus and Hades at the beginning; you can swap sides anytime</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play has a history of delivering good Ancient Greek-themed slots, with Gates of Olympus being one of the developerâ€™s most popular titles.</p>
<p>The slot does not do a huge deal with the theme, though the ability to switch between two game modes and settings does help. In the Zeus version of the game, you will play atop Mount Olympus, with the bright blue sky of Athens bringing the action to life. When you change to the Hades mode, you will be greeted with the red-hot flames of the Underworld.</p>
<p>It all looks very polished and tidy, and while it may not be too original, it is still very well designed.</p>
<p>Nice win in the Zeus vs Hades: Gods of War</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>When you load up Zeus vs Hades: Gods of War, you will be presented with the choice of which game mode to play. This will only impact the volatility of the game, with the base game remaining the same regardless of which route you take.</p>
<p>The slot uses a 5x5 grid with 15 paylines that are active on each spin. Winning combinations are formed across paylines on consecutive reels starting from the leftmost reel.</p>
<p>Sensational win in the Zeus vs Hades: Gods of War slot machine</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>Like the base game, the bonus features are not impacted by which game mode you choose to play in.</p>
<p>The first feature you will probably encounter is the Expanding Wilds. Whenever a Wild lands, it will expand to fill the entire reel. A quick battle between Zeus and Hades is played out, but the outcome is irrelevant. It will then add a multiplier of between x2 and x100 to the Wild. This will then be applied to any wins it is a part of.</p>

<p>The other bonus is the Zeus vs Hades: Gods of War Free Spins round. You will need to land three Scatters to trigger 10 spins. During the round, any Expanding Wilds that land will become sticky and stay in place till the end of the bonus.</p>
<p>Depending on your location, you may also have access to a Bonus Buy feature that allows you to buy your way into the Free Spins.</p>

<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play has used a strong maths model for Zeus vs Hades: Gods of War. The RTP for the game is 96.05%. There are some different versions available, though. As per our slot strategy guide, we recommend looking for slots with the best RTP. The slot is considered highly volatile. Both game modes are highly volatile, with the Hades version being described as extremely volatile by Pragmatic Play.</p>
<p>The maximum win in the slot is a generous 15,000x your stake, which will please most players. The minimum bet is $0.10, and the maximum is $100.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>The Zeus vs Hades: Gods of War slot may not be the most original title in terms of its theme, but it has a nice design and provides some engaging periods of gameplay. The combination of Expanding Wild Multipliers and Free Spins is nothing new, but it is always one that generates good results. Finally, a 15,000x maximum win also helps the game stand out. This is a Greek-themed title worth paying some attention to.</p>
