<p>The leading in-demand provider of innovative live casino content, Stakelogic Live, announced it secured a new license, paving the way for its further expansion in Europe. On Friday, the company revealed it received a license from the gambling regulator in Greece, the Hellenic Gaming Commission. The green light from the gambling regulator effectively enabled Stakelogic Live to offer its innovative live casino content to operators licensed in the country.</p>
<p>Securing the license confirms that the company complies with the established regulations in Greece, enabling it to start forging agreements with iGaming providers in the region. Thanks to this milestone achievement, players in the country will soon be able to experience Stakelogic Live's thrilling live casino games.</p>
<p>The newly secured license in Greece complements the company's ongoing growth on the Old Continent. Previously, Stakelogic Live joined forces with some of the best gambling operators across Europe, delivering its exceptional live casino games and services. Now, Greek customers will be able to tap into the unique experience offered by Stakelogic Live's recently launched bonus feature, Super Wheel.</p>
<p>Stephan van den Oetelaar, Stakelogic's CEO, was excited about the company's latest achievement. "Securing this license from the Hellenic Gaming Commission is a huge step forward for Stakelogic Live," he explained in a statement.</p>
<p>The CEO outlined that Stakelogic gained popularity among Greek customers in the last few years. Moreover, van den Oetelaar said that the company's products were well received by customers in the European country. Finally, he said: "Stakelogic Live offers premium, industry-leading live casino content, and we canâ€™t wait for Greek players to be able to enjoy it for the first time."</p>
<p>Currently, Stakelogic Live offers content that is streamed live from its state-of-the-art studios that are located in the Netherlands as well as Malta. The company's wide range of live casino products include European Roulette, Auto Roulette and American Blackjack. Moreover, Stakelogic Live offers thrilling game shows like Super Stake Roulette 500x, Speed Baccarat and Super Stake Blackjack. All of those titles will soon become available to operators in Greece, promising exceptional experiences for the players.</p>
<p>The license in Greece comes after Stakelogic Live announced the launch of its Chroma Key solution back in October with Starcasino in Belgium. That deal helped expand the company's European footprint. The recently secured license from the Hellenic Gaming Commission comes after Stakelogic Live already holds a license from the gambling regulator in Malta, the Malta Gaming Authority.</p>
