<p>Banged-Up LA Rams Coming Off a Surprising Win</p>
<p>Last weekend, the Rams were without a number of key men, including QB Matt Stafford and their best defensive player, Aaron Donald. Nevertheless, they still managed to grab a win. They defeated the Las Vegas Raiders 17-16, thus ending their six-game losing streak.</p>
<p>The same players will miss out on the action in Week 15, can the Rams surprise the odds again? Probably not, because on Monday night, they’re taking on a much stronger opponent than last weekend.</p>
<p>The Rams have had a bad experience with the Packers, losing both of their previous games. Further, they’re 0-5 in the Rams vs Packers games played at Lambeau Field in more than 16 years. In fact, the last time they defeated the Packers on the road was in October 2006.</p>
<p>Green Bay Packers Need a Win to Keep Their Playoff Dreams Alive</p>
<p>The Packers need to win all of their remaining games in order to stay in the race for a Wild Card berth. Unfortunately for them, even that wouldn’t mean booking the playoff spot for certain. Nevertheless, there’s still hope and they’re clinging to it.</p>
<p>In the previous game week, the Packers destroyed their archrivals Chicago Bears 28-19 on the road. As a result, they’re now 5-8 on the season. The game saw their defense finally get back on track, keeping the rivals to under 20 points for the first time since early November. Their offense did an okay job, with two rushing TDs and a passing one.</p>
<p>Los Angeles Rams vs Green Bay Packers Prediction</p>
<p>Right now, the Packers are a way better team than the Rams. They also have the motivation on their side, not to mention that in the MNF game, they’ll have their fans cheer them on. All of this means that the only logical outcome of this game should be a big win for the hosts.</p>
