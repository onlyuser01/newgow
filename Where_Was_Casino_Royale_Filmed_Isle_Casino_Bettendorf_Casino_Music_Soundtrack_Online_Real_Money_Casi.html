<p>Maze Escape Megaways review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>This slot is themed around a mythical Greek labyrinth.</p>
<p>Players will find themselves wandering through a stone maze facing strange creatures and helpful characters. They’ll need to collect all the enchanted artifacts and make deals with the gods if they want to escape the labyrinth alive.</p>
<p>Fans of Greek mythology will love this ancient world, but all players will enjoy the magical vibe.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The soundtrack has a classical epic mood and creates the feeling that players are at the climax of a grand adventure. A gentle clatter as the reels fall into place makes it seem that players are playing with magical stones.</p>
<p>The reels themselves seem to suggest the structure of a maze with stoney walls. The format of the reels cleverly suggests pathways of escape and curious characters the players might meet on their way.</p>
<p>Symbols within the reels include a wise-looking bearded man, a golden laurel crown, a young hero, and an emblematic minotaur. These conjure a firm sense that we are in a world of ancient Greek mythology.</p>
<p>The game is set against a backdrop of an ancient city with pale stone buildings looming over the reels. This adds to the feeling that players are an underdog hero about to beat the odds.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Maze Escape Megaways uses the Megaways system. This is a system that publishers can license, which uses Any Ways Wins system for payouts and randomises the number of symbols on each reel every spin.</p>
<p>This game includes 6 Blocker symbols, which are not part of any winning combinations. These symbols can be unlocked during the Shifting Maze Avalanche feature (see details below).</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Shifting Maze Avalanche is triggered when the symbol lands on a special middle position on the reels. The reels take on a new format and the Minotaur Wild symbols become locked into position. Blocker symbols are chosen at random to be locked into place, while new symbols fall down to fill empty positions on the reels.</p>
<p>The Minotaur Wild Feature begins when the Minotaur Blocker symbol is unlocked. The Minotaur Wild symbol expands to cover the whole reel and receives a multiplier between x1 and x7.</p>
<p>The Scatter symbols appear on reels 1-6 and, when players land 3, this triggers the Labyrinth Free Spins feature. While in the Free Spins feature, any win can trigger the Shifting Maze Avalanche.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.15%, just about our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.20 up to a maximum of $/£/€40.00 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is high, which makes it a good match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We recommend this average RTP, high volatility Greek myth-themed slot.</p>
<p>The animation and theme make this game aesthetically-pleasing and the high volatility makes it a good choice for higher chances for bigger wins.</p>
<p>The varied gameplay and bonuses keep this slot engaging and players will enjoy the sense of variety.</p>
