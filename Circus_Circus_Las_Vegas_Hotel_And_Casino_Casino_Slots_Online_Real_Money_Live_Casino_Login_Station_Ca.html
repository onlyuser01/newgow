<p>Donald Trump, his campaign and the Republican National Committee (RNC) will seek between $60m and $100m to challenge electoral results.</p>
<p>Trump Campaign Readies to Challenge Election Results</p>
<p>Donald Trump’s campaign and the Republican Party are trying to raise at least $60 million in funds to challenge the outcome of 2020 US Presidential election which ended with the Democratic hopeful, Joe Biden, riding to victory on 290 electoral votes.</p>
<p>Clocking a convincing win at the ballot victory, Biden is now the President-elect and he is expected to take over as chief executive at the White House at an inaugural ceremony in January.</p>
<p>Yet, the Trump’s campaign is not happy with the outcome, nor is the President who has hurriedly proclaimed himself a winner on November 4 with the ballots quickly fact-checking him only days after in key battleground states.</p>
<p>Donald Trump, who has enjoyed support from prominent donors, and fellow casino moguls, may reach out to Sheldon Adelson or Steve Wynn once again, but the likelihood of him securing the necessary amount to contest the electoral results is slim.</p>
<p>Sources who spoke to Reuters said that the campaign and the Republican National Committee (RNC) were looking to rise between $60 million and $100 million in funds to challenge the outcome of the elections, a notion that some Republicans have already rebuked publicly.</p>
<p>Not Ready to Challenge the Results</p>
<p>According to Reuters, who interviewed a Trump campaign adviser, the current election bid had been launched in a manner that they believed was a disservice to the President.</p>
<p>So much, in fact, that none of the campaign members had considered the possibility that President Trump might lose, let alone need to mount a legal fight.</p>
<p>Now, both Biden and Trump may need to gird for a lengthy court battle, challenging the outcome of elections not an easy matter. Vice President Mike Pence’s chief of staff, Marc Short, commented that the campaign would make sure that every legal vote has been counted.</p>
<p>This came to a fulminating President who went to Twitter to question the legitimacy of the elections, suggesting ballot fraud and targeting mail vote, which analysts always said would be in favor of Biden.</p>
<p>Another source told Reuters that even if there were discrepancies, the “math is what it is,” alluding to the fact that the President has lost in all battleground states bar North Carolina, but securing other key jurisdictions instead with a split-hair lead.</p>
<p>The President-elect has already launched his own initiative called the “Biden Fight Fund,” which will be channeled to stave off any claim challenging the legitimacy of the elections.</p>
<p>The country has had four Presidential elections so far in which electoral results were challenged. The most recent vote result challenge was in 2000 when Palm Beach County in Florida, confused the ballots and effectively and inadvertently made people either vote for the wrong candidate or vote for two candidates at the same time.</p>
<p>In fairness, though, while Al Gore, then running against George Bush, wanted to have votes counted, the US Supreme Court set a deadline for December 12 for an electoral result to be produced. Gore conceded victory the next day:</p>
<p>“I accept the finality of the outcome, which will be ratified next Monday in the Electoral College” –Al Gore</p>
<p>Gore had lost with 266 Electoral College votes to Bush’s 271. While Al Gore called for unity, Trump’s team is going to challenge results not down to a single county, but across multiple states.</p>
<p>This would require a substantial financial investment. He reportedly had a call with Sheldon Adelson late into his campaign to secure additional funding. With the results of the race being so convincingly in Biden’s favor, Adelson and others may think twice before donating to what a good businessman would know is probably a lost cause.</p>
