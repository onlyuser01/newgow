<p>The leading online gambling operator, NetBet Italy, announced it forged a new partnership with the provider of premium games for the iGaming sector, CT Interactive. Under the terms of the freshly minted partnership, the iGaming content developer agreed to supply NetBet Italy with a portfolio of games. As a result, players of the operator will be able to experience the thrill and excitement CT Interactive's titles bring.</p>
<p>Per the new partnership, NetBet Italy's players can now access popular and fan-favorite games from the iGaming studio. Such titles will include 20 Star Party, 40 Treasures, as well as 40 Mega Slot, among others. Currently, CT Interactive's titles stand out with quality graphics and sound effects. Additionally, the iGaming developer's games are backed by cutting-edge technology and engaging features.</p>
<p>Since it was founded in 2012, CT Interactive has been constantly growing its portfolio of games, while at the same time, securing different awards recognizing the potential and quality of its content. Thanks to the latest agreement with NetBet Italy, the company expands further the reach of its games to new audiences, delivering unrivaled experiences. Currently, CT Interactive offers more than 200 games but its portfolio continues to grow.</p>
<p>Claudia Georgevici, NetBet Italy's PR manager, shared her excitement about the collaboration with CT Interactive in a statement. She said: "We are delighted to partner with CT Interactive and bring their outstanding games to our players in Italy." Finally, Georgevici pointed out: "Their expertise and commitment to delivering exceptional gaming experiences align perfectly with our own values. We are confident that our players will be thrilled with the addition of CT Interactive's titles and that this partnership will be a tremendous success."</p>
<p>Earlier this month, NetBet Italy forged another important deal by signing an agreement with Inspired Entertainment, the leading provider of content, technology and solutions, powering the gambling industry. That deal saw Inspired deliver top-performing and popular games for the operator's clients in Italy. While this collaboration helped strengthen the leadership position of NetBet Italy, it also helped Inspired Entertainment reaffirm its footprint in the country. As a result, some of the most popular and engaging games from the iGaming content supplier have gone live for NetBet's clients.</p>
<p>Before that, in July, NetBet Italy signed a content deal with Wazdan, a provider of premium games for the iGaming industry. This collaboration helped propel Wazdan's content while at the same time delivering unique experiences for NetBet's customers.</p>
