<p>Caesars Entertainment is teaming up with the company that produces Las Vegas’ “Absinthe” on a project that costs $75 million and includes theaters and dining rooms in three cities. The company, which recently announced a multi-million-dollar makeup project on Caesars Palace, shared the news via the Associated Press on Thursday.</p>
<p>It stated that it teamed up with Spiegelworld to develop theater projects in three cities that are well-known for their gambling culture – New Orleans, Las Vegas and Atlantic City.</p>
<p>Caesars Welcomes Spiegelworld</p>
<p>The three casinos that are set to be a part of the massive renovation process are Caesars Atlantic City, Harrah’s Resort Atlantic City and The Tropicana. The renovation’s first phase will start with Caesars and Harrah’s Resort, and is said to cost approximately $170 million.</p>
<p>Finally, the third project is planned for New Orleans. Caesars Palace New Orleans is set to have a new show and a theater in 2024, and this new development is part of the casino’s renovation, which costs $325 million.</p>
<p>The LINQ Hotel + Experience, which is located in Las Vegas, will be the starter of the project. A new permanent production called DiscoShow will take place in Spiegelworld Glitterloft, which is set to open its doors in Q4 of 2022.</p>
<p>A new theater and a resident show also await Caesars Atlantic City, and it is set to open in the first quarter of 2023. This project is said to incorporate Warner Theater’s 1929 facade. At the moment, the facade is part of the Boardwalk-facing part of the casino and it is included in the $400-million makeover that Caesars promised to complete in the three casinos that it owns in Atlantic City.</p>
<p>Caesars Boss Excited About the Upgrades</p>
<p>Caesars Entertainment’s CEO and president, Anthony Carano, shared a few words on the new project. He said that the three cities are the entertainment and sports capitals in the US, and as Caesars goes forth with the property reinventions in Atlantic City and New Orleans, it is delighted to have Spiegelworld involvement and add creativity to its plans.</p>
<p>Atlantic City is of major importance to Caesars, and Carano stated that the company is more than excited to introduce the “new Caesars Entertainment” to the city. As he pointed out, the plans will revitalize Caesars’ brand of hospitality and ensure long-term success and growth.</p>
<p>Spiegelworld is a reputable production company that is known for far more shows than just Absinthe. Its resume contains the likes of OPIUM and Superfrico (live entertainment party) at Las Vegas’ very own The Cosmopolitan, as well as the Atomic Saloon Show, which takes place at The Venetian Las Vegas’ Grand Canal Shoppes.</p>
