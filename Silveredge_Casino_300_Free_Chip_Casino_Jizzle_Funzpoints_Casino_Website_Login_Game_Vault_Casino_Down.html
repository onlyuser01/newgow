<p>Supplier of betting solutions for the horse racing industry BetMakers has entered into a partnership with Supreme Ventures-owned subsidiary to explore new opportunities on the Jamaican market.</p>
<p>BetMakers Enters Jamaican Horse Racing Market</p>
<p>BetMakers Technology Group is opening up to the world in a new partnership opportunity with Prime Sports Jamaica (PSJ) and Supreme Ventures Racing and Entertainment (SVREL), both owned by Supreme Ventures.</p>
<p>The Australia-based provider of fixtures and odds for the horse racing betting industry will leverage its proprietor Managed Training Services and BetMakers DNA to supply PSJ and SVREL with real-time fixed-odds data for all bets that cover international and Jamaican horse meetings.</p>
<p>With its entry in Jamaica, BetMakers will be able to collect information on the ground and distribute accurate, reliable, and real-time betting data back to online operators worldwide, making the Jamaican horse racing industry a worthwhile choice for punters.</p>
<p>SVEL and BetMakers have signed a branding sponsorship as a result of which BetMakers signage and intellectual properties will be displayed at the Caymanas Park leading to better brand awareness among local punters.</p>
<p>To provide partners in distant countries with the necessary data, BetMakers will use its unifying Global Racing Network solution. Commenting on this partnership, Supreme ventures Chairman Gary Peart spoke highly of the opportunity to team up with BetMakers and benefit from its fixed-odds product.</p>
<p>Building a Stronger Horse Racing Betting Industry Worldwide</p>
<p>He cited North America as a market in which the company had been successful and added that the racing betting industry can benefit globally from BetMakers’ product in what is an increasingly competitive segment in light of the upsurge in traditional sports betting.</p>
<p>“We are very proud to be one of the first tracks that will implement the sophisticated fixed odds system that BetMakers provides, and we see this new deal as a major transformational change for the Jamaican horse racing industry,” said Peart.</p>
<p>For his part, BetMakers Technology Group Managing Director Todd Buckingham expressed his excitement to be spearheading his company’s alliance with both Caymanas Park and Supreme Ventures and deliver fixed odds betting for horse racing in the country, as well as export Caymanas Park races to a global audience eager to bet on high-quality events.</p>
<p>A Clear Focus on Regulated Markets</p>
<p>This partnership, added Buckingham, exemplifies BetMakers’ commitment to regulated and licensed markets. With the help of BetMakers, punters from any region can enjoy quality betting opportunities from all over the world, powered by BetMakers’ data and technology platforms, he concluded.</p>
<p>Previously, BetMakers made headlines at the beginning of the month with the acquisition of Sportech, a competitor and developer of horse betting solutions.</p>
