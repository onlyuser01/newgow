<p>DAZN BET, DAZN Group’s newest challenger sports betting brand, is ready to conquer the market. The new subsidiary is poised for success thanks to its strong team, which has been further reinforced with the addition of Mark Kemp as chief executive officer.</p>
<p>DAZN BET Welcomes Kemp as CEO</p>
<p>Mark Kemp is an industry heavyweight and has worked in various management positions for several influential companies in the sector. In 2011, Kemp joined the British gambling company Coral and served as the gaming director of its digital, retail, and omni operations. Gala Coral Group was acquired by Ladbrokes in 2016 and rebranded to Ladbrokes &amp; Coral where Kemp served as a product director before getting promoted to managing director.</p>

<p>As chief executive of DAZN BET, Kemp will help the company realize its dream to disrupt the betting market by developing state-of-the-art products that engage the casual sports bettor. The company seeks to cater to the needs of those who play for fun and wants to enhance their experiences with premium sports content.</p>
