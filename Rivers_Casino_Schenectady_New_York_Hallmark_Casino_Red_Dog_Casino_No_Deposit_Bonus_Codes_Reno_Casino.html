<p>As Pragmatic Play looks forward into the future and seeks to become one of the top suppliers in the industry’s regulated markets, it has appointed Bhotesh Maheshwari as VP of Commercial Strategy and Operations.</p>
<p>Maheshwari will be the head of Pragmatic Play’s office in Gibraltar, working with 3 executives to provide exceptional quality and innovation to UK, Spanish, Portuguese, and German operators.

<p>Bhotesh Maheshwari Has an Outstanding Career in the Gaming Industry</p>
<p>After starting as a retail manager for William Hill in 2006, in his professional career of 15 years working for top operators and suppliers in the industry, Maheshwari customized products according to local markets in Europe, the UK, Asia, and Latin America and held different jobs within the industry.</p>
<p>Bhotesh worked for William Hill and Inspired Gaming before entering the iGaming space when he started working for Betfair. There he built a new original jackpot offering and in-house gaming proposition.</p>
<p>In 2016 he joined the Rank Group in Gibraltar, becoming the head of product development and casino revenue for the UK’s biggest casino brand, Grosvenor Casinos, and the UK-based Mecca Bingo, an operator with 86 bingo clubs.</p>
