    <h1>Warhorse Casino Turningstone Casino Foxplay Casino Casino Pizza Catalonia Bavaro Beach Golf Casino R</h1>

<p>Hi Nick, thank you for your quick response.</p>
<p>1- My account was created and verified with a level 1 kyc on October 21 (level 1 kyc verification is required to use the platform, Full name, address, zip code, city, country).</p>
<p>2- I played with cryptocurrencies (playing with cryptos is only accepted in this casino)</p>
<p>3- I never used VPN to alter my IP address, they have proof of this.</p>
<p>4- The last time I spoke with them was on October 29, I asked support if it was an error that I could only play 6 casino games and not the other games, their response was that I had violated their rules and that my account was going to be closed)</p>
<p>Searching their website at https://shuffle.com/es/info/aml I found that they have a geographic block by IP but it is not true, at least in my country, so I wonder if they should take responsibility for letting me play and not having blocked my access as it should have happened. Thank you</p>
<p>Edit: There is something else to comment on, like me, many people entered shuffle because they offered an airdrop (compensation with cryptocurrencies for people who enter the project in an early phase and the more volume you generate and the more deposits you make, the airdrop is greater) In projects like this, they usually give thousands of dollars in compensation, I knew I would get my money back with this airdrop that's why I bet so much money, now I find myself with lost money and no possibility of opting for that airdrop</p>
