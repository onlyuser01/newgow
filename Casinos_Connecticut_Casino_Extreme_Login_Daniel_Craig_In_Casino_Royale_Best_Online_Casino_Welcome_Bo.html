<p>Caesars Brand Leased</p>
<p>The luxury brand hotel will be built by HCW, a real estate developer company with offices in Arizona and Missouri that has developed more than $2 billion in real estate in the last 23 years, and after it becomes operational, HCW Hospitality, a division in the Arizona-based HCW and the Texas-based Aimbridge Hospitality will undertake the management function, and Caesars will lease its brand and include the new property into its Caesars Rewards loyalty programme.</p>
<p>“Our partnership with HCW to create a world-class hotel and dining experience in one of the nation’s most desirable communities is very exciting”. . Chris Holdren, Chief Marketing Officer, Caesars Entertainment</p>
<p>Sunset Views &amp; Italian Cuisine</p>
<p>One of the attractions of the hotel will be a rooftop pool deck, located on the seventh floor and opening up picturesque views over the Camelback mountain sunsets for its guests. Housed on the same floor, there will be a unique dining experience restaurant, Seven /SVN/, offering a variety of food and cocktails.</p>
<p>Food and dining will feature additionally with two other restaurants by celebrity chef, author, philanthropist and TV personality, Giada De Laurentiis, Luna by Giada will present fine Italian cuisine with California and Mediterranean influences, and Pronto by Giada, a more casual all-day café that will present Italian fare and a unique blend of coffee offerings, with cuisine for the guests on the go.</p>
<p>Modern Concepts &amp; Materials</p>

<p>Spread Scottsdale Culture</p>
<p>The Caesars Republic Scottsdale project will create new jobs in Scottsdale and become an additional point of interest for international tourism, helping the unique culture of Scottsdale become even more famous around the world.</p>
