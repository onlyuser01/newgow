<p>Fortune Diamond review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Fortune Diamond is an "oriental" themed slot from iSoftBet. Though with the exception of a few of the symbols, the feel of Fortune Diamond is far more generic.</p>
<p>While there are Chinese coins and hats, the majority of the thematic elements are lost in a sea of Ace to Ten symbols and the abstract purple background.</p>
<p>Fortune Diamond goes very low key on its theme.</p>
<p>Win with x10 multiplier Wild symbol</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>That low key attitude applies to Fortune Diamond’s other aspects too. The symbols are well drawn but fairly characterless, and the animations are similarly functional and unostentatious.</p>
<p>Subtlety is no bad thing though and what Fortune Diamond lacks in scale and pizazz it makes up for in solidity.</p>
<p>The music is an excellent example of this as well as being one of the few aspects that feel genuinely Chinese. The music is simple and works well as background noise, never getting too much in the player’s face.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>The gameplay in the base game is fairly straightforward: a fifty win line slot with five reels and three rows.</p>
<p>The key features that mix things up are the multiplier Wilds and the free spin bonus (see below for full details on both of these aspects). Neither of these go very far in their role as seasoning for the game’s otherwise dull gameplay.</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbols substitute for all other symbols with the exception of the bonus symbol.</p>
<p>There is also a Wild multiplier that comes in a number of sizes: x2, x3, x5 or x10. This Wild Multiplier symbol only appears on reel five and it seems to be present in each spin of the base game. It multiplies all winnings of the spin (free spins included).</p>
<p>The Bonus symbol triggers a free spin round when you land two or more consecutive symbols starting on reel one. Two Bonus symbols will get you from ten to fifteen free spins while five will net you thirty-six to fifty spins. However, you cannot exceed the maximum of one-hundred Free Spins over the course of one bonus round.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 95.22%, somewhat disappointing as it comes under our yardstick for average of around 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum of $/£/€0.50 to a maximum bet per spin of $/£/€500.00. The lower end of this might still be too high for very low rollers, but most other players will be covered by this range.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is medium-high, which would just about meet the requirements for our preferred strategies if the return to player was high enough. Which it is not.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Overall Fortune Diamond is an example of how you can do all the little things pretty well but have them fail to add up to something good overall. Instead, the game feels tired and dull very quickly with every feature seeming to remind the player of other slots.</p>
<p>On top of this lack of individuality, Fortune Diamond also suffers from an under-par return to player.</p>
<p>We do not recommend this game to our readers.</p>
