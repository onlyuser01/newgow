<p>The leading developer of casino gaming content for the gambling industry, Bluberi, expanded its presence in the United States. The company announced on Monday it received approval for a gaming license in Minnesota.</p>
<p>Bluberi to Debut in Minnesota Next Year</p>
<p>This license enabled Bluberi to deliver its leading content and technology for the state’s 19 casinos. Thanks to the gaming license, the company now taps into a leading market that has developed for more than three decades. In fact, currently, Minnesota is a leader in Class III gaming in the US. The state is also the home of the first-ever tribal casino in the US which opened its doors back in 1988.</p>
<p>By securing a license in the state, Bluberi will now be able to deliver leading content to Minnesota casinos as early as next year. The content will include themes such as Fu Bamboo, Treasure Hunter, Devil’s Lock, as well as the soon-to-be-released Xing Fu 888. According to Bluberi, the launch of its leading content can be expected in early 2023 via the Novus b49 portrait hardware.</p>
<p>“I’m so excited to begin placing Bluberi games at Minnesota casinos.“ Christian Smith, senior director of product and marketing at Bluberi</p>
<p>Bluberi’s senior director of product and marketing, Christian Smith, said that he is excited to see the company’s content reach brick-and-mortar casinos in Minnesota. He added that one of the company’s key priorities is to create engaging and fun products featuring themes that cannot be found anywhere else on the market. “We’ve long viewed Minnesota as having some of the savviest players in North America and will be pursuing opportunities to test new games with key casino partners,” said Smith in conclusion.</p>
<p>The Company Is Excited to Enter a New State</p>
<p>Casey Whalen, Bluberi’s chief commercial officer, added that the company is delighted to enter the casino market in Minnesota which offers more than 21,000 slots. He thanked the Minnesota DPS Alcohol and Gambling Enforcement’s Special Agent Jill Ahart for the help and assistance provided to Bluberi to achieve the recent licensing.</p>
