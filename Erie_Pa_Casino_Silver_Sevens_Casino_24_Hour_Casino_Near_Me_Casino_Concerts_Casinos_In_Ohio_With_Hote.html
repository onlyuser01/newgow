<p>The leading global gaming operator that has a strong presence in Mexico, CIRSA, announced a new partnership with the leading provider of video slots, video bingo games and online products for the growing gambling industry, Zitro.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the new deal announced Tuesday, CIRSA introduced Zitro's leading Mega King games for its Mexican casinos. As a result of the new collaboration, the operator's customers in Mexico can now enjoy games that are proven to be popular around the globe.</p>
<p>Mega King is one of Zitro's most popular games offering four exclusive base games. The game stands out with four levels of jackpot and a unique functionality that enables the players to bet more and get a chance of winning a bigger jackpot.</p>
<p>Players of the Mega King games can benefit from quality graphics and sounds that create an immersive experience. What's more, the games offer ENERGY BOOST, a feature which according to Zitro "transforms into a higher frequency of prizes and gives access to the bonus jackpot," among other features.</p>
<p>Johnny Ortiz Viveiros, Zitro's Founder, shared his excitement in a statement released on January 3, 2023. He said: "CIRSA has emblematic casino venues all over the world, and the fact that it has made this important bet on our successful Mega King in Mexico fills us with pride."</p>
<p>Juan David Baracaldo, Cirsa Mexico's Product Director, added that Zitro's games combine quality graphics and sound with scalable progressiveness and unique game mechanics. This, according to him, helps deliver unrivaled gaming experiences for the customers. Finally, Baracaldo said: "Zitro, as always, brings together all the aspects to ensure a profitable operation and maximum entertainment."</p>
<p>The new collaboration further expands the reach of Zitro's games. In fact, back in December, the company joined forces with Grupo Boldt in Argentina. As a result, Zitro deployed its GLARE cabinet games for the leading operator.</p>
<p>Focusing on Mexico, CIRSA isn't the only operator that offers Zitro's leading Mega King games. Late last month, the company agreed to deliver its popular game cabinets for Big Bola players in the country.</p>
<p>On the other hand, CIRSA entered the regulated market in Mexico following the acquisition of Pringsa back in 2005. The company currently has 10 casinos in the country primarily located within the most popular cities of each state.</p>
<p>One of CIRSA's main goals is to deliver entertaining and quality services to its clients. Now, the new collaboration further boosts those efforts. At the same time, CIRSA's venues offer engaging experiences by providing the latest slot games, table games and sports betting services.</p>
