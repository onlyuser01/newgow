<p>Nuvei Corporation, the leading payment platform, announced last week that it joined forces with Betsson Group, the Swedish-based online gaming operator. The new collaboration will see Nuvei provide its payment services for Betsson's sportsbook brand in Colorado called Betsafe.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the collaboration, Betsafe online sportsbook customers will benefit from using Nuvei's Instant Bank Transfer product. The innovative product allows consumers to instantly deposit funds into their gaming accounts from their bank accounts.</p>
<p>Moreover, Nuvei's product enables instant withdrawals, which brings the online player's winnings directly to their bank accounts. The seamless service is available for consumers 24/7. Nuvei explained that its leading Instant Bank Transfer product "tokenizes players' financial details when a first transaction is completed, meaning players are able to deposit or request a payout via a "single-click" payment method."</p>
<p>The recent deal reaffirms Nuvei's expansion in the US. As the company's portfolio continues to grow, Betsson joins leading online gambling operators that have already joined forces with Nuvei. FanDuel, DraftKings and BetMGM are only a few of the operators that already selected Nuvei's leading payment services.</p>
<p>Without any doubt, Nuvei's Instant Bank Transfer continues to bring success for the company with more US operators benefiting from the technology. Besides its innovative product, the company enables its partners to accept more than 550 alternative and local payment methods. Thanks to this, operators offer flexible payment methods, while at the same time Nuvei remains a global leader in the payments within the gambling industry.</p>
<p>In a statement released Thursday, Nuvei's chair and CEO, Philip Fayer, said: "Betsson has a global reputation as a leader in the gaming industry, which is why we are excited to be supporting them as they grow their presence following a successful launch in the US market."</p>
<p>He explained that offering instant deposits, real-time payouts and convenient payment methods is an absolute must for the sports betting platforms operating in the US. In conclusion, Fayer pointed out: "Already in 2022 we have partnered with some of the most significant operators in the exciting US gaming landscape as it develops at pace, and Betsson certainly falls into that category."</p>
<p>Marina Bogard, Betsson's managing director for the US, added: "We're committed to offering our players the best gaming experience in the market and payments plays a critical role in delivering that vision."</p>
<p>She outlined that thanks to Nuvei's Instant Bank Transfer product, Betsson customers can now enjoy more options for depositing. Bogard stressed that at the same time, the consumers can request payouts in real-time, which is a highly-demanded functionality.</p>
