<p>Games may also be rolled out on Betfair Casino’s platform in other markers in the future</p>
<p>Gaming Corps, a global developer of gaming content, has formed a major new partnership with Betfair Casino. Under the agreement, the former company will inject content into the operator’s portfolio, allowing it to engage more customers.</p>
<p>According to the announcement, the partnership between the two companies will have an initial focus on the Latin American market. However, Gaming Corps’ games may also be rolled out on Betfair Casino’s platform in other markers, depending on their performance.</p>
<p>As agreed, Gaming Corps will inject a suite of crash games, table games, slots and Plinko into Betfair Casino. As a result, the casino operator’s players will get to enjoy some of Gaming Corps’ best new releases, including games like Raging Zeus Mines, 9 Jokers Stick and Spin, and Wild Woof. In addition, gamblers will be able to try out some of the provider’s all-time classics, such as the Coin Miner and Jet Lucky series.</p>
<p>As a highlight of the partnership, Gaming Corps also agreed to provide Betfair Casino with bespoke branded versions of its Penalty Champion and other Mine games.</p>
<p>Betfair Casino is the iGaming division of the famous betting exchange Betfair. Launched in 2006, Betfair is a part of the Flutter family and is one of the powerhouses in Latin America.</p>
<p>Betfair Is Glad to Secure Access to Gaming Corps’ Titles</p>
<p>Stefano Buse, Betfair International’s commercial director of gaming, commented on the partnership, praising Gaming Corps as a “flagship provider” in the LATAM region. He said that its games will be a “fantastic addition” to Betfair’s local offering.</p>
<p>Our operations in LatAm are very important to Betfair Casino, and we are very happy to offer our players Gaming Corps’ full games suite, including in some cases our own branded versions of games. We look forward to working with Gaming Corps and the development of this partnership. Stefano Buse, commercial director of gaming, Betfair International</p>
<p>Mats Lundin, Gaming Corps’ director of sales, also commented on the matter, praising the deal as a “hugely significant moment” for his team. He praised Betfair as a well-established brand in Latin America and said that he is looking forward to supplying it with first-class games.</p>
<p>What makes this partnership so exciting for us is that it has the potential to grow and develop by moving into more markets, and I really look forward to the opportunities this presents to both parties. Mats Lundin, director of sales, Gaming Corps</p>
<p>In September, Gaming Corps further diversified its portfolio, launching Super Hot Stacks, an action-packed new slot.</p>
