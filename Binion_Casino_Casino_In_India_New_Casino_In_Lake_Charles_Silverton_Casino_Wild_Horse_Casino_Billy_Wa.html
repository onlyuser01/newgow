<p>On the penultimate day of arguments in the Billy Walters trial, Walters’ lawyers positioned their client as a man who displays the kind of acumen investing In the stock market that he has throughout his sports betting career.</p>

<p>Walters, one of the most famous and successful sports bettors in the world, stands accused of making $43 million from illegal stock market trades using insider tips, allegedly provided by Tom Davis, the former chairman of Dean Foods Co.</p>
<p>The message this week was clear: Walters is so smart at stock market investment that he doesn’t need to cheat.</p>
<p>The defense called a parade of stock market brokers to testify in confirmation of that assertion.</p>
<p>Prosecution Star Witness Embezzled Money</p>
<p>The only problem for Walters is the star witness for the prosecution, Tom Davis himself, who has testified in court that he became a “virtual conduit of information” on Dean Foods for his former friend Walters.</p>
<p>Davis is testifying against Walters as part of a plea bargain with federal prosecutors after admitting charges including securities fraud and wire fraud.</p>
<p>Barry Berke, Walters’ attorney, has argued that Davis is an unreliable witness and “a liar” who “wrongfully implicated Walters only after he got caught stealing from a charity and cheating on his taxes.”</p>
<p>Davis himself has admitted in court that he embezzled money from a charity for battered women in order to help fund his love of gambling and hookers.</p>
<p>He has also admitted he borrowed over $1 million from Walters, part of which he told Walters was to refinance a Dallas bank, but in reality it was for himself, and he blew it gambling. He lost $200,000 alone on one hand of blackjack, in 2011 at the Cosmopolitan in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>The Babe Ruth of Risk</p>
<p>Appearing for the defense, stockbroker Rob Miller, of Stifel Nicolaus &amp; Co., told the jury that Walters was a “very, very aggressive investor” who would make trades in amounts anywhere from $5 million to $100 million and would study the markets assiduously.</p>
<p>“He really, I would say, combined a professional style of gathering research and information with a gambler’s trading instinct,” said Miller. “He was far and away my most aggressive investor.</p>
<p>“Sometimes he’d talk to me in gambling parlance,” he added. “Oftentimes, he would refer to his investments as ‘bets.’ ”</p>
<p>Another broker referred to him as the “Babe Ruth of Risk.”</p>
<p>Closing arguments are expected on Wednesday.</p>
