<p>Resorts Digital has struck a new multi-year partnership with Scientific Games to bolster the company’s iGaming product in the Garden State. New Jersey is experiencing a growth of its online gaming segment.</p>
<p>Resorts Digital and Scientific Games Continue to Expand in NJ</p>
<p>Scientific Games has struck a new multi-year partnership with Resorts Digital, a New Jersey betting and gaming firm. With the new partnership, Scientific Games will extend its support for Resorts Casino and Mohegan Sun Casino, both operated by Resorts Digital, with the dedicated OpenGaming platform.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Resorts holds other licenses with the likes of PokerStars and DraftKings in New Jersey, giving the brand a versatile portfolio of products and covering distinct verticals in the legalized iGaming and sports betting markets.</p>
<p>Resorts CEO Ed Andrewes commented on the deal, expressing his thanks to Scientific Games for continually supporting Resorts’ iGaming operations. Andrewes argued that with Scientific’s help, much of the online operations of the company have become far more engaging and immersive for customers:</p>
<p>“The content provided seamlessly via OpenGaming plays a big part in making ResortsCasino.com one of New Jersey’s go-to online casinos.”</p>
<p>Scientific Games Digital Chief Executive Jordan Levin also pitched in and shared his enthusiasm with the partnership. Extending existing ties between SG and Resorts Digital was a rubber stamp of the relationship between the companies and their ability to deliver results, Levin added.</p>
<p>“We look forward to driving the partnership forward to ever higher levels and increased gains for both parties.”</p>
<p>With Resorts Digital cementing its position in the New Jersey market, the Garden State has reported some great results. Online gaming revenue reached $87.5 million in July or up 122.5% year-over-year (YOY).</p>
<p>Golden Nugget landed the biggest share of the revenue, amassing $31.5 million. Resorts Digital came second with $18 million in overall iGaming turnover. The sum included contributions from PokerStars and DraftKings which are still two of the largest brand names in New Jersey.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, SG Digital has strengthened its ties with Wynn Resorts in New Jersey and decided to extend the existing partnership to Colorado and Indiana. Scientific Games is deploying its dedicated OpenSports platform on the market and using Wynn’s power brokering to enter new markets under a tested skin and a trusted partner.</p>
<p>Wynn will operate with the help of a partnership with Full House Resorts in both Colorado and Indiana. The new partnership between Wynn and SG Digital is not the first time the companies have teamed up either.</p>
<p>Scientific Games joined Wynn in 2018 to support the brand’s transition towards digital and has been a trusted partner ever since.</p>
