<p>Provider of esports products and services Oddin.gg announced the appointment of Richard Kidd as the new Senior Executive Advisor to the business that is looking for further vertical expansion.</p>
<p>Business Monetization and Development Knowledge</p>
<p>The appointment of Kidd as Senior Executive Officer at Oddin.gg is the latest step of the B2B esports supplier, seeking to leverage his sales experience and introduce new products and services to its partners.</p>
<p>Highlighting Kidd’s “wide commercial and go-to market experience,” Oddin.gg’s managing director Marek Suchar was pleased to welcome the new Senior Executive Advisor to the company, certain that “his knowledge of business monetization and development” will be invaluable to the business.</p>
<p>“We have been intensively looking into some new avenues where we can bring additional value to both existing clients as well as prospects,” Suchar continued, convinced that with Kidd on board, the business “will be able to address these market opportunities with the right proposition and execution in place.”</p>
<p>Provider of esports odds feed, risk management, iFrame solution, widgets, content, and marketing services, Oddin.gg is continuously seeking new ways to enable growth for its partners and expand the products and services on offer within its end-to-end esports betting ecosystem and Kidd is considered to be the sales veteran capable of executing on these opportunities.</p>
<p>Coming from the digital marketing sector, where he served in sales roles at Google/DoubleClick and OpenX, as well as an executive at Bayes Esports, Kidd also has experience in planning business strategy on digitization with start-ups in digital media and technology, and has supported implementation and application of new solutions.</p>
<p>Data-Driven Product Company Profile</p>
<p>Considering the perspectives in his new role, Kidd outlined that Oddin.gg matches exactly his vision of a technically driven data product company, boasting an extremely experienced team in both esports and esports betting that his international commercial knowledge will complement to “provide the necessary support to the further development of the company.”</p>
<p>“It is a pleasure to work with this team focused not only on best-in-class products but also on venturing into new markets and new product developments,” added Kidd.</p>
<p>Esports titles like Counter Strike, League of Legends and Dota 2 require complex odds feed despite the esports industry still being in its nascent years as esports bettors and fans look beyond what occupies their time and interests and into the esports-centric UI/UX, esports stream and widgets space.</p>
<p>Having established itself as a trusted provider of esports risk management, Oddin.gg is the preferred choice for bookmakers looking to expand operations in the esports vertical. As part of the firm’s efforts to expand its role, Oddin.gg hired another former executive at Bayes Esports, Juana Bischoff.</p>
<p>With the appointment of Kidd, the company affirmed its strong belief that there would be multiple other verticals within esports to explore in the future.</p>
