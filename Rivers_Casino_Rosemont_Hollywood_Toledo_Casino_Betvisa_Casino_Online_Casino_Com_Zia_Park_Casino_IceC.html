    <h1>Rivers Casino Rosemont Hollywood Toledo Casino Betvisa Casino Online Casino Com Zia Park Casino IceC</h1>

<p>Please help me! I was playing Ice casino and won 3000 eur on 21/11. I requested withdrawall and got the email from casino that my withdrawall regust has been accepted. After few days of waiting I wanted to log into my players profile to check is there any payment status updates and recognized that my account is blocked. When I contacted customer service they told me that it has ben blocked becouse i was loging in from Germany or using vpn on 07/11 but I definettly wasnt since Im playing from Latvia witch is allowed and there is no point for me to use any vpn's or other devices to play. I had conversations with several assistants and all they can say to me that this is administrations decision to block my acount because I was wiolating some of their rule witch i 100% wasnt, only thing that all of them keep telling me is rhat they will unblock my account if I will accept woiding my last winnings of 3000 eur with I would no do! I havent violated anything, I was asking them to profe that I was doing something wrong but they just say that this is confidentional information and they will not deliver any proofs. On 07/11 i was playing as well and was using public wifi that I allready told to them, that could be the only issue why it could show why im playing from other country witch i told them but they are not even listening, just keeps telling the same thing. I have sent them my location, my bank account deals on that day to proofe that im wasnt on germany or wasnt using vpn ( there is not even vpn configured on my phone). I think that they just dont want to pay... i have read a lot of player feedbacks that ice casino wount pay and allways there are problems with them. I have all the chat screenshots and other information that I will share with you if needed and that could help! Please help me, I dont want to lose this big amount of money just because of unfair casino. Help me please. I can deliver you more screenshots if needed. Please help me somehow</p>
