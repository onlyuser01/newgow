    <h1>Big Fish Casino Free Chips Casinos In Tunica Casino Hotel In Las Vegas Stardust Casino Las Vegas Bou</h1>

<p>I made multiple deposits to the value of 3100 pounds. when depositing I was given free spins. I contacted support and said I didn't want the free spins as they were low value and annoyed me and they removed these.</p>
<p>They automatically added on a small bonus amount to each deposit which I wasn't even aware of as my deposits were converted from Pounds to Euros and I didn't click to accept it or ask for it. I had deposited more than 30 times and did not agree that they add on these automatic bonuses to every single deposit to minimise winnings.</p>
<p>I won 7k euro and withdrew 5k as this is the maximum at their site in a 30 day period.</p>
<p>A week and a half later after doing all my checks I get the following.</p>
<p>Dear Andrew,</p>
<p>Thank you for playing at Casino Crazyno.</p>
<p>This mail is to notify you about the status of your pending withdrawal request, code 588616, for the total amount of 5000 EUR.</p>
<p>Please note that according to the Terms and Conditions of the bonus that was credited to your account, there is a max-winning restriction that you should comply with when requesting a withdrawal.</p>
<p>Therefore, we have processed the amount of 1146.39 EUR and the rest was voided.</p>
<p>We apologize for any misunderstanding and thank you for respecting the mutual interests of fair gaming at Casino Crazyno</p>
<p>If you would like this explained to you further, please do not hesitate to contact the Casino Crazyno Support Team.</p>
<p>I proceed to try get them to change their mind but they have said it is their final decision and that it is my responsibility to read the terms.</p>
<p>They deliberately add this small bonus to limit payouts.</p>
