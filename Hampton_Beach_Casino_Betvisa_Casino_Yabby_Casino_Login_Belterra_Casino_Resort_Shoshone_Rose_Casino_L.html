<p>Yolo Group, a company behind prominent iGaming brands such as Bitcasino.io, sportsbet.io, and livecasino.io, is now expanding its content reach through a new partnership with Livespins</p>
<p>Livespins is a known social gaming platform that is elevating the way people experience iGaming products across the board, allowing audiences to watch, bet, and game along with their favorite streamers or brand ambassadors.</p>
<p>Bringing Livespins’ Product Offer to Yolo Group’s Fleet of Casinos</p>
<p>The advanced live stream gaming platform will allow Yolo Group to introduce the Livespins solution across its own distinct fleet of websites.</p>
<p>Livespins has already teamed up with a number of prominent gaming brands such as Relax Gaming, iSoftBet, and Yggdrasil to name a few, which means that the company’s own portfolio of products is pretty solid, offering Yolo Group’s operators hundreds of games that can be streamed and lead to better, more involved and socially-charged experience.</p>
<p>The entire product portfolio is developed in such a way as to take the iGaming gameplay and experience “to the next level,” enabling spectators to become an active part of the gameplay and participate in online gaming in any way that they see fit or enjoy.</p>
<p>Livespins is easy to integrate into the casino lobby and it is a product that neatly dovetails and overlays with a company’s existing offer, meaning that operators do not lose out on already existing content and product offerings by superseding them with Livespins.</p>
<p>Livespins CCO Michael Pedersen welcomed the opportunity and hailed Yolo Group and its fleet of player-favorite and well-known brands that will now benefit further from his company’s offer.</p>
<p>Product Built to Appeal to the “Next Generation”</p>
<p>Pedersen paid compliments to both Yolo Group and outlined the immediate priorities the company enjoys:</p>
<p>Livespins has been developed to allow online casino brands to unlock the huge potential that slot streaming provides but in a way that is responsible and compliant. It’s great to see Yolo Group embrace this and provide its players with an entirely new way to experience and enjoy online casino. Livespins CCO Michael Pedersen</p>
<p>Yolo Group Director of Gaming Joe McCallum said that the organization was prepared to embrace the innovation that comes from a hard-hitting partner such as Livespins. Livespins is appealing to the next generation of players.</p>
<p>“There is no denying the popularity of slot streaming, and through Livespins we can leverage this in a way that is responsible and compliant,” McCallum explained. He is confident that players across Yolo Group’s brands will welcome the new feature and embrace it. Livespins previously teamed with EveryMatrix, becoming available to all of the content aggregator’s partners and operators. A similar partnership was negotiated with Hub88.</p>
