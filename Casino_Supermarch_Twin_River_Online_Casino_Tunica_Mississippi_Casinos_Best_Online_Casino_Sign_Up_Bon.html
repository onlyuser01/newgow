<p>Sportradar and NASCAR have agreed to an extension of their ongoing partnership that now adds new rights and will see Sportradar process official betting data. This new partnership will allow the motorsport organization to significantly boost its profile with sports and betting fans, who have been showing more interest in NASCAR as a direct result of numerous betting markets that are now available.</p>
<p>NASCAR has recently also signed FanDuel as its Authorized Gaming Operator, and Sportradar will help leverage live timing and scoring data for the organization to further strengthen its betting appeal, and drive engagement with audiences.</p>
<p>Sportradar has an immaculate reputation for injecting reliable data to partner operators and media, monetizing NASCAR’s most valuable asset in the process, and offering direct and accurate insight into events such as NASCAR CRAFTSMAN Truck Series, NASCAR Cup Series, and NASCAR Xfinity Series.</p>
<p>All in all, there are 97 events that fans can look forward to and now have the opportunity to bet on if they choose to. Sportradar EVP, Strategic Partnership &amp; Content Eric Conrad has welcomed this opportunity:</p>
<p>"As the sports industry’s leading technology company and a trusted partner of sportsbooks and media companies, Sportradar is uniquely positioned to support NASCAR in capturing commercial opportunities."</p>
<p>He spoke confidently about the future of this renewed partnership and how it would allow Sportradar to deliver more worthwhile experiences for NASCAR fans and establish better opportunities to engage between the organization and its supporters. This sentiment was shared by Joe Solosky, the Managing Director of Sports Betting for NASCAR.</p>
<p>Solosky said that Sportradar is a crucial partner to the organization’s sports betting efforts and strategy which will ultimately translate into better engagement with fans. NASCAR is committed to following fans to the sports betting space and further engaging with them, he added.</p>
<p>As mentioned, FanDuel recently became an Authorized Gaming Operator for NASCAR further strengthening the organization’s pull with sports betting crowds. FanDuel has been seeing a significant uptake in the overall sports betting volume on NASCAR races, prompting the operator to focus more efforts and promote the organization’s events to its consumer base.</p>
<p>This is not the first time Sportradar and NASCARA have put in place. The two organizations have been working together since 2015 and have renegotiated their partnership over the years, further committing to embracing innovation along the way and ensuring that fans have access to the best possible experiences.</p>
