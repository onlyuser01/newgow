    <h1>Excalibur Casino Las Vegas Eurobets Casino M Casino Golden Eagle Casino Online Casino No Deposit Bon</h1>

<p>The leading online casino operator in Italy and a subsidiary of the global iGaming operator NetBet, NetBet Italy, expanded further its offering in the country after announcing a new partnership. On Wednesday, the company confirmed it joined forces with the leading provider of content for the iGaming sector, Greentube.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the new deal, NetBet Italy will significantly expand its already diverse portfolio of content by adding new games from the leading developer. As a result, players in Italy will have access to Greentube's popular titles such as Lucky Lady's Charm Delux, Book of Ra Deluxe and Dolphins Pearl Deluxe, among other engaging games.</p>
<p>As noted, the collaboration will expand NetBet Italy's offering, but it will also benefit Greentube. Thanks to the deal, the iGaming developer expands further the reach of its content, delivering its immersive and beautifully designed games to new audiences.</p>
<p>Since it was founded back in 2008, NetBet Italy has been continuously growing. Currently holding a license from the Italian gambling regulator, ADM, the operator is famous for its premium content and industry-leading services. In fact, NetBet Italy was one of the first companies that focused on the online gaming vertical and has continuously updated and improved its offering.</p>
<p>In a statement released on March 15, 2023, Claudia Georgevici, NetBet Italy’s PR manager, shared her excitement about the deal with Greentube. "At NetBet we are always looking to build new relationships with the most experienced and talented providers in the online casino industry, and we look forward to hosting Greentube’s impressive collection on our site," she said.</p>
<p>Finally, Georgevici pointed out: "Their portfolio of cutting-edge games includes plenty of unique themes and some truly innovative features that we have no doubt our players at NetBet Italy will enjoy."</p>
<p>The deal with Greentube comes on the heels of another partnership announced by NetBet Italy. Last month, the company confirmed it expanded its offering by adding content from Amusnet Interactive, a popular provider of online gambling content and solutions. That deal saw NetBet Italy introduce a selection of 20 popular games from the iGaming provider, expanding further the content available for its clients.</p>
<p>Before that, early in February, the company forged a partnership with the live dealer casino content provider Ezugi. Per the terms of that collaboration, a leading suite of Live Dealer games from Ezugi became available for NetBet Italy.</p>
<p>Many of the successful iGaming operators, such as NetBet Italy, continue to improve and expand their offerings. Now, thanks to the latest deal, the company boosts further its variety of games, bringing new titles for its players.</p>
