    <h1>Casino Hotel Near Me Casino Hotels In Shreveport La Seminole Casino Classic Hollywood Casino San Pab</h1>

<p>Thank you for your patience while waiting for our response.</p>
<p>We have accepted Ukrainian players in the past. However, at the time when the client had registered on our website, we had already been in the midst of closing our services to the Ukrainian Market. Since technically it takes involvement of our platform provider, we could not predict the exact date of having this particular website skin down.</p>
<p>On the evening of July 11th, 2023 Ukraine was taken down from the registration form on our website and no new registrations were allowed from that market. We had reimbursed each client from that market in terms of any financial obligations they qualified for at that time.</p>
<p>As for this particular case – our client fell not only under this group of players, but also his account was reviewed and marked by the Risk Management Team (see the details below). He was notified about both reasons each time one of them occurred accordingly, meaning that Support Representatives let the client know upon both Risk Management overview final decision and upon suspending the market once it took place technically.</p>
<p>Details of BETSSEN interaction and steps in regards to this case:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The client registered on July 10th, 2023 and on the same date reached out to the Live Chat for the very first time asking about gaming limits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The next day, July 11th, 2023 after a proper review by RM team, the client got notified about services termination in regards to his gaming account. As stated in point 12.1 of our Terms and Conditions "a bookmaker reserves the right to void bets or withhold the balance generated amount, regardless of deposit history, if a user violates any of our terms or based on a decision made by our Risk Management team."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The same date July 11, 2023 late evening our platform provider updated the status of the Ukrainian market suspension and, due this fact as well, we had to reimburse and close all the existing Ukrainian clients’ accounts. Since the same client also fell under this action, as the service provider we were obligated to inform players about such global changes directly. We understand the confusion which this overlapping sequence of events may have caused to the client, though partly it did not depend on us.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As the client kept coming to the Live chat about refusing to withdraw the deposited amount, our Support Representatives had to clarify the reason behind the reference to point 12.1 of GTC (which the client had been informed about earlier) – which was also linked to 2.1.3 (o) of current GTC stating that "An individual applying to become an Account Holder furthermore warrants and represents - o. not to be the person who works in the gambling industry." The client is currently working as an SEO Team Lead at a gambling company and he had never notified us about any relations to the industry.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As the client’s gaming profile had a few reasons to be suspended, BETSSEN could not continue further service provision to him. Please also note that BETSSEN has exceptionally refunded his deposited amount fully, regardless of passing any KYC standard procedure. The client had continuously refused withdrawing the deposited amount, so the delay was caused by him only. Nonetheless, the refund took place on 19-07-23. In addition, his funds have been paid and his account has been closed for the aforementioned reasons.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As for a final clarification, the client did not register through the Casino Guru Affiliate Link. We can provide evidence to Casino Guru management privately, as to not to post any internal tools visibility in public, or Casino Guru affiliate Team can check through the affiliate system logs themselves.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We cannot understand what is the point of this claim, since the client has not lost any of his own funds and we kept all the rules of GTC, which the same client has accepted upon registration.</p>
<p>We have already refunded the deposited amount and find this case irrelevant at this time.</p>
<p>Please let us know if you have any further questions or need anything else to be clarified.</p>
<p>BETSSEN Team.</p>
