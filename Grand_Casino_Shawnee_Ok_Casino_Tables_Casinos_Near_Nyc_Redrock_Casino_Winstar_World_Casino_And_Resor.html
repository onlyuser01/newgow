<p>Print Studios has become the Winner of Most Watched &amp; Streamed Slot in GamblingNews Awards Tier 3 category</p>
<p>The supplier has entered and won the monthly silverware with two of its titles, Cash Defense, which became the Most Watched Slot and Holy Hand Grenade, which became the Most Streamed Slot in June in the Tier 3 category. The Tier 3 category applies to studios that release one new slot per month, or less.</p>
<p>Both games provide engaging gameplay and captivating mechanics designed to elevate engagement and player satisfaction. Developed by Print Studios’ in-house team of specialists, the games have emerged as some of the hottest titles the month had to offer.</p>
<p>Cash Defense is an innovative slot inspired by the Tower Defense genre and employing traditional slot mechanics. The game comes with 26 paylines and features unique game features, such as Super Spinners, Jumbo Symbol, and Tower Defense Bonus second-screen game to add spice to the gameplay.</p>
<p>Holy Hand Grenade sends you back to Medieval Europe, which is, as Print Studios puts it, “an explosive slot,” a clever play of words on the historical meaning of the artefact and the modern use of the word. Once again, the game is beautifully designed and visually compelling, featuring the Super Spinners mechanic, a bunch of free spins, and the Holy Hand Grenade Feature for even bigger wins.</p>
<p>Commenting on receiving the award, Print Studios’ CCO and Co-Founder Filip Wargeus welcomed the opportunity to see his company and the hard work that has gone into developing both slot games distinguished in the monthly Slot Awards by GamblingNews:</p>
<p>We´re honored to not only have one game but two games winning – a testament to our great team. The awards show that players appreciate the games we put out which means a lot to us. Print Studios’ CCO and Co-Founder Filip Wargeus</p>
