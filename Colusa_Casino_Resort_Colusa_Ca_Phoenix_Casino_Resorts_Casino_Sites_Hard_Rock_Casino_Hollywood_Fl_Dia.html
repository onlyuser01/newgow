<p>The DSWV refuted claims that the high number of excluded people means more harm, saying that it instead highlights the program’s efficiency</p>
<p>Germany’s OASIS self-exclusion scheme is a lifeline for more and more problem gamblers, as attested by the growing number of registrants. The growing number of excluded customers highlights the visibility and availability of the program, Germany’s Sports Betting Association (DSWV) argued, in spite of claims that the numbers mean more harm.</p>
<p>For reference, at the end of 2020, only 47,000 people had used OASIS to exclude themselves from gambling. This number steadily grew over the years, reaching 107,000 by the end of 2021 and 153,500 by the end of 2022. At the beginning of May 2023, meanwhile, over 192,600 people had entered the register.</p>
<p>Some consider the growing number of excluded people to be a concerning development that marks an increase in gambling harm. Burkhard Blienert, Germany’s Federal Addiction and Drug Commissioner, said that gambling must really cause a lot of suffering if so many people are willing to exclude themselves from gambling.</p>
<p>The Numbers Mean More Players Are Protected</p>
<p>The DSWV argued that, in reality, the high numbers are a result of the increased visibility of the problem and the adoption of OASIS by more and more gambling operators.</p>
<p>As recently as June 2021, only 464 gaming operators with 1,529 operating sites were connected to OASIS. Today, there are more than 6,400 operators with over 29,500 premises. DSWV statement</p>
<p>Prior to the new State Gambling Treaty, gambling venues were not allowed to be connected to OASIS. The DSWV noted that an increase in registrants is to be expected considering that the program is now incorporated into the offerings of many more operators.</p>
<p>Mathias Dahms, president of the DSWV, noted that it is not the number of problem players that has increased but the number of players that can use the OASIS player protection program. The figures, Dahms claimed, mean that the system is functioning properly.</p>
<p>To derive a general attack against the State Treaty on Gaming or the licensed gaming providers from the increased figures does not do justice to the history of the blocking file, nor to the improved player protection situation on the German gaming market. Mathias Dahms, president, DSWV</p>
<p>Dahms concluded that many operators support the cross-platform self-exclusion program, which is a “major step forward for player protection in Germany.”</p>
<p>OASIS is an all-encompassing exclusion scheme that bars players from gambling. Players can either exclude themselves or be signed into the program by partners or family members. Gambling companies can also initiate blocks if they identify problem players.</p>
