<p>Provider of customer relationship management (CRM) solutions to the online gaming industry Fast Track announced its platform has been integrated with Greco’s player risk management engine to improve operational marketing efficiencies for its clients.</p>
<p>Providing Clients with New Capabilities</p>
<p>The integration of Fast Track with the gameplay risk management platform provides partners of the CRM services provider with additional capabilities for segmentation based on behavioral risk and automation for player communications so that players do not deter at the first sign of dubious behavior.</p>
<p>Commenting on the announcement, Greco co-founder and chief executive officer, Ozric Vondervelden, hailed the integration as “an important milestone” of Greco’s “long-term strategic partnership with Fast Track” as the integration would address an issue where “operators make suboptimal decisions all the time … due to poor financial and behavioral analytics.”</p>
<p>“Greco’s goal is to determine the behavioral risk and theoretical value of every player, under every circumstance,” Vondervelden continued, outlining that the metrics used by the gameplay risk management platform “have the power to reshape everything: player segmentation, bonus abuse management, player rewards, affiliate payout calculations, and player lifetime modeling.”</p>
<p>“This integration provides our joint partners with a seamless process for acting on our insights,” he concluded.</p>
<p>Simon Lidzén, chief executive officer and co-founder of Fast Track, outlined that the company has been following the developments around Greco’s gameplay risk management platform before finally deciding to integrate Greco’s Gameplay Risk Engine with its platforms and offer the engine’s functionalities to its clients and allow them to “put gameplay analysis and player risk management on autopilot.”</p>
<p>Deep Insights into Player Behavior</p>
<p>The integration of Greco’s gameplay risk management platform with Fast Track’s platform will allow Fast Track operator clients to benefit from the solution without the need to divert resources for development or further integration as Greco’s Gameplay risk engine powers them with deep insights into player-associated risk and value and enables them to make more informed decisions about their bonus offerings.</p>
<p>Fast Track’s real-time data platform offers business users a comprehensive suite of tools to help them grow their businesses by creating automated one-on-one experiences at scale. Last year, the CRM services provider received Great Place to Work for 2022/23 certification as the company’s employees ranked it as a world-class place to work with an astonishing 93% score on the Trust Index.</p>
<p>Around the same time, London-based Greco registered as a vendor in New Jersey in partnership with Resorts Digital Gaming, the digital gaming arm of Resorts Casino &amp; Hotel, to offer its Gameplay Risk Engine to licensed online operators in the Garden State.</p>
