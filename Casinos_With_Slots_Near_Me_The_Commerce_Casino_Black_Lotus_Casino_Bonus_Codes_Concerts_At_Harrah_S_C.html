    <h1>Casinos With Slots Near Me The Commerce Casino Black Lotus Casino Bonus Codes Concerts At Harrah S C</h1>

<p>Dear Joe,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint through our website. I’m very sorry to hear that you didn’t succeed to withdraw any of the winnings that you have accumulated during the bonus play. I checked the General Bonus T&amp;Cs, and this is what I found:</p>
<p>„ClassySlots reserves the right to withhold any withdrawals and/or confiscate all winnings and Bonuses for irregular play. "Irregular play" may include, inter alia:</p>
<p>· Placing single bets equal to or greater than 30% from the value of the Bonus credited to the player account, prior to the wager requirement for that Bonus having been met.</p>
<p>· Using the double-up feature to increase bet values.</p>
<p>· Placing bets equal, zero, low margin bets or hedge betting, shall all be considered irregular gaming for Bonus play-through requirement purposes.</p>
<p>· All Cashback carries a wagering requirement of 1X.</p>
<p>· Players cannot withdraw winnings derived from a Cashback until the sum of the cashback is wagered in full.</p>
<p>· All Cashback is restricted to a maximum withdrawal limit of 10X the cashback amount.</p>
<p>· All Cashback is non-withdraw-able, and the casino reserves the right to deduct issued Cashback money from pending withdrawals."</p>
<p>I understand that you would prefer if the casino capped your winnings after first withdrawal request or didn’t allow you to bet more than the maximum allowed bet during the bonus play, but, unfortunately, this is not a common practice. The system that accompanies every withdrawal and verification is not automated, and it might take few days. This is what happened in your case. You were not stopped or blocked when you have decided to increase your bet or when you have reached the maximum cash out amount.</p>
<p>Sadly, there is not much I can do to support your case at this time. I would strongly recommend reading all the T&amp;Cs carefully before you start playing to avoid any misunderstandings in the future. Casinos try to design their bonuses to be as attractive as possible, but the rules must always be followed. The part that I don’t understand is why your initial deposit has been cancelled, too. Please could you forward to me any relevant communication with the casino regarding the 150 EUR and the reason why it is impossible to withdraw it? Thank you very much in advance.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
