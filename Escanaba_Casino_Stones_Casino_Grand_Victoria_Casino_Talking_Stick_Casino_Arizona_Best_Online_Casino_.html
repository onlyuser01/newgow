<p>The gaming studio’s commercial manager Kristian Hassal described the game as a “fresh take on a well-loved slot theme.” Hassal added that the classic horror story with mummies at the center has been ramped with “truly cinematic visuals” and a soundtrack that will send players at the edge of their seats.</p>
<p>Relax Gaming’s chief product officer Simon Hammon recognized Blue Guru’s potential in spite of its young age. He also called Curse of the Mummies more than another slot with an Ancient Egypt theme, describing it as an “audio-visual delight and work of art.” Hammon expressed his thrill to be able to introduce the game to its Network firsthand.</p>
