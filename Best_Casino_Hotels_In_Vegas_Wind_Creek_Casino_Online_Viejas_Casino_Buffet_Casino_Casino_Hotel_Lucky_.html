    <h1>Best Casino Hotels In Vegas Wind Creek Casino Online Viejas Casino Buffet Casino Casino Hotel Lucky</h1>

<p>Sports betting and iGaming operator Cola.bet is expanding its Zero Margin solution to new players in several markets across Africa. The campaign will now be available to players in Kenya, Ethiopia, and Zambia.</p>
<p>The initiative is designed to enhance betting odds as well as improve the potential cash outs. Cola.bet sets an example by becoming the first sportsbook in the region to offer a Zero Margin campaign, which has been used by several other sportsbooks in markets across Asia and Europe.</p>
<p>New Players Get a Boost with Cola.bet</p>
<p>Cola.bet CMO Dana Varnytska has welcomed the opportunity to be launching another groundbreaking product on the market and said:</p>
<p>“Cola.bet’s mission is providing the best sports betting experiences on the market, and our Zero Margin campaign is another example of our commitment to Africa’s bettors. Our localized expertise has enabled us to hit the ground running and make fantastic progress on Cola.bet’s expansion ambitions.” Cola.bet CMO Dana Varnytska</p>
<p>The Zero Margin will cover numerous popular soccer games and focus on pre-game selections specifically. Cola.bet will also feature a 150% deposit bonus for new customers in all the markets now covered by the Zero Margin offer. The operator claims that this is “the largest bonus” available on the market.</p>
<p>Africa Continues to Draw iGaming and Betting Investment</p>
<p>Cola.bet has detailed that more bonuses will be coming to players in the targeted markets with a solid increase of its African consumer base. According to the company, there has been a 320% growth in its player base from the continent after it launched.</p>
<p>However, this is just a start. The company is investing $14.5 million to develop its iGaming platform further and launch online casino solutions across ten markets in Africa by mid-2022. As one of the youngest continents on Earth, Africa has quickly become a focal point of investor appetites and aspirations.</p>
<p>Numerous iGaming companies have made a play for the African market, among them iGaming operators, suppliers and B2B providers. Cola.bet has decided not to be left behind.</p>
