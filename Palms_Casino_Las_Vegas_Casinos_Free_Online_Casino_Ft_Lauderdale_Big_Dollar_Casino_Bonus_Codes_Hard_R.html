<p>AGTech GOT Won Five Tenders in China</p>
<p>The integrated technology and services company AGTech Holdings’ Beijing subsidiary AGTech GOT Technology has won five tenders. With that move, the company clearly continues to expand its presence in China. With the tenders who AGTech GOT won, it will be allowed to supply sports lottery terminals to the following provinces:</p>
<p>Hebei</p>
<p>Fujian</p>
<p>Sichuan</p>
<p>Zhejiang</p>
<p>The fifth tender which the company won is for the municipality of Tianjin. The company will supply Android terminals for Hebei, Fujian, and Zhejiang. On the other hand, AGTech GOT will supply sports lottery terminals for Tianjin. In Sichuan, the company will offer both Android and sports lottery terminals.</p>
<p>On that subject, AGTech GOT said that the company has so far won many tenders in different provinces, autonomous regions, and municipality across China. According to the company, winning the tenders only affirms the company’s dedication towards becoming a leader in the sports lottery terminal offering in China. In conclusion, AGTech GOT noted that the company will continue to focus on product innovation which ensures product development and compliance but it also contributes to the overall healthy lottery market in China.</p>
