<p>Witches' Charm review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Witches’ Charm is a punny title, playing both on the idea of witches magical powers – which include charms along with hexes, curses and spells – and on how charmingly sexy the witches in this slot are.</p>
<p>EGT are leaning heavily on the sexy witch motif here and use it to create a magical world of cauldrons and crystal balls. They appear on the reels as symbols along with the classic familiars: an owl and a black cat.</p>
<p>The setting is a woodland where anything could happen and the glimmer in the trees is as likely to be fairies as glow worms.</p>
<p>Base game win</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The game’s setting is beautifully rendered with detailed artwork in the style of a fantasy novel’s cover illustrations. Each symbol has its own illustration which kicks into gear when it becomes part of a winning combo.</p>
<p>The game does not have much in the way of music, relying for its sound almost entirely on spin and win sounds. Though these sound effects do work and lend the game a much-needed atmosphere, and the win sound is almost a musical soundtrack all by itself.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>The gameplay is that of a five reel, three row slot, with fifteen win lines.</p>
<p>Any winnings a player makes on a spin can be gambled in a double or nothing game of Red or Black.</p>
<p>There are also a free spin bonus and a jackpot feature, both of which are explained in full below. Sufficed to say, this covers the key things one might hope for from a standard 21st century slot.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter symbol. Wins including a Wild are doubled. If it lands two or more on a winline running left to right from reel one, it also pays out as the highest value symbol, far more valuable than any regular symbol.</p>
<p>Two Scatter symbols anywhere on the reels pays out double the player’s bet per spin. Three or more increases the payout and also awards the player fifteen free spins. During the free spins, any winning combinations receive a x3 multiplier. The free spins can be retriggered.</p>
<p>There are also four progressive jackpots. The Jackpot Feature is triggered at random at the end of a spin. When triggered, the Jackpot Feature begins with a picking game.</p>
<p>Twelve cards are dealt out face down, with each card having the name of one of the four progressive jackpots on it. The player picks cards until they have three matching cards, and the jackpot whose symbol appears on the three matching cards is then awarded to the player.</p>

<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 95.97%. This is more or less what we consider average. We use a rough yardstick of around 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.15 up to a maximum of $/£/€90.00 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is in the murky grey area between medium and high, which makes it a decent match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Paytable for Witches' Charm slot</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>The charms of Witches’ Charm are bewitching enough to keep people playing it. The slot enjoys a moderate, but consistent popularity with the punters. And one can see why.</p>
<p>Everything about the game is competently designed and executed. The gameplay is well paced and various enough to keep players interested, while the visuals and sounds project a unified sense of atmosphere.</p>
<p>The medium-high volatility makes this a good slot to use with our preferred strategies and the average RTP should work for most players.</p>
<p>We give this one a strong recommendation.</p>
