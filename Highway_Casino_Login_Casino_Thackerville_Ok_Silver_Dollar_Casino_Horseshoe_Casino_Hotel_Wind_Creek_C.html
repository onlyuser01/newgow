<p>Miami Dolphins vs Baltimore Ravens is one of the most interesting matchups of Week 2 of the 2022 NFL season. The two meet on Sunday, September 18 at M&amp;T Bank Stadium in Baltimore, which is where the Ravens are 4-0 against the Dolphins in the 21st century, with the most recent Dolphins at Ravens game finishing 40-0 in the favor of the hosts.</p>
<p>Oddsmakers think Baltimore will triumph again, but this time, it’s almost certain we’re not going to see a blowout win. The thing is that both teams started the 2022 NFL season in top gear. The Ravens defeated the New York Jets 24-9 on the road. The Dolphins were even more impressive in Week 1 – they outplayed the New England Patriots 20-7.</p>

<p>Miami Dolphins Look Great in 2022</p>
<p>It’s been a while since the Miami Dolphins have been this strong. They seem to have a good player for literally every single position. They might not (yet) be good enough to challenge for the Super Bowl, but they definitely have the quality to get to the postseason.</p>
<p>Their offense did relatively okay in Week 1, with quarterback Tua Tagovailoa going 23 of 33 for 270 yards and one touchdown. Sure, he could’ve made more TD passes, but then again, he and his teammates were facing very tough opposition in their first game of the season. That said, we expect to see much more from Miami’s passing game in the near future, with Tyreek Hill being the receiver who we should see explode.</p>
<p>Defense-wise, the Dolphins were terrific in Week 1. In fact, one of their two touchdowns was scored by their defense. After safety Brandon Jones knocked the ball out of Pats’ QB Mac Jones’ hands, defensive lineman Melvin Ingram scoped it up and scored a TD. You can be certain that these guys are planning to do something similar to the Ravens’ QB as well. But will they be able to?</p>
<p>It’s All About Lamar Jackson in Baltimore</p>
<p>Knowing that the New York Jets are one of the worst teams offense-wise, it’s no surprise that the Ravens’ defense held them to just nine points in Week 1. The Ravens offense also did a marvelous job, although most of it was the work of their quarterback, Lamar Jackson.</p>
<p>He threw for 17/30 for 213 yards and three touchdowns, with one of his passes getting intercepted. Third-year WR Devin Duvernay was the one who caught two of Lamar’s passes in Week 1, while the third passing TD was scored by Rashod Bateman, a second-year receiver.</p>
<p>Three passing TDs in a game is not bad, but keep in mind that the Ravens did it against the Jets. The question is whether they can do the same against the Dolphins.</p>
<p>Dolphins vs Ravens Prediction</p>
<p>Even though the Ravens did great in the first week, we think they’re not going to be great in 2022. They do have Lamar Jackson as their signal-caller, but this guy doesn’t have as great targets for his passes as he did last year – his favorite receiver Marquise Brown was traded away earlier this year.</p>
<p>Further, they also don’t look great in the rushing game, which isn’t surprising as they’ve lost Devonta Freeman and Latavius Murray to free agency. The running backs who were supposed to replace them – Gus Edwards and J.K. Dobbins – are out injured.</p>
<p>Is this something the Dolphins can take advantage of? We sure think so!</p>
<p>Picks: Miami Dolphins to win; under 43.5 points</p>
