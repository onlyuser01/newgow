<p>Dear germanenriquealcaraz,</p>
<p>We have received evidence from Vulkan Vegas Casino that you and some other players are engaging in the same or very similar gameplay and player behavior that shows signs of money laundering. Your above replies are still leaving quite a lot of questions which makes us believe the Vulkan Vegas Casino decision of canceling your withdrawal and blocking your account is not unfair and is acting according to its terms and conditions as mentioned here:</p>
<p>"11. COLLUSION, CHEATING, FRAUD AND CRIMINAL ACTIVITY</p>
<p>11.5. If the Company has a suspicion that you may be engaging in or have engaged in fraudulent, unlawful or improper activity, including, without limitation, money laundering activities, or conduct otherwise in violation of the Terms, your access to the services may be terminated immediately and/or your account blocked. If your account is terminated or blocked in such circumstances, the Company is under no obligation to refund to you any funds that may be in Your Account. The Company shall be entitled to inform relevant authorities, other online service providers and banks, credit card companies, electronic payment providers or other financial institutions of your identity and of any suspected unlawful, fraudulent or improper activity and you will cooperate fully with the Company to investigate any such activity."</p>
<p>Unfortunately, after gathering all the necessary information we are forced to reject this complaint.</p>
<p>If you feel you want to take this complaint further you can contact Curacao Gaming authority here (complaints@gaminglicences.com, certria@gaminglicences.com) and submit a complaint to them. The Gaming Authority has more options and tools to help players.</p>
<p>We are sorry We could not be of more help on this occasion.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Kristina</p>
