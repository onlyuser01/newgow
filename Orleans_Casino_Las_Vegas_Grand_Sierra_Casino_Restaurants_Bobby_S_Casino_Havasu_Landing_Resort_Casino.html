<p>Greentube has launched a new technology stack that will provide iGaming companies with all the tools they need to produce and distribute games</p>
<p>Greentube, NOVOMATIC’s digital gaming and entertainment division, has launched Greentube Mynt, a new technology stack for producing and supplying games. According to the company, the revolutionary tech stack will “open a new chapter” in the history of iGaming.</p>
<p>Greentube Launched Greentube Mynt</p>
<p>Greentube Mynt is comprised of several modules and founded upon a cutting-edge remote gaming server (RGS). According to Greentube, Mynt is “the foundation for a future-proofed games entertainment solution. The new tech stack also comes equipped with all the engagement tools companies need to retain customers.</p>
<p>For example, player retention tools are presented as pre-installed in-game widgets with overlay functionality. This would help operators quickly grab the attention of players. Furthermore, Mynt’s back-end solutions would help operators create exciting promotional campaigns.</p>
<p>Another perk of using Greentube Mynt are the multiple jackpots, both timed and random, and the comprehensive Free Spins tool offered by the stack. Other community features, such as Prize Drops and Tournaments, will also be added. Lastly, Greentube promised to include a selection of white-label options in the near future.</p>
<p>Other Perks to Using Mynt</p>
<p>Thanks to Greentube Mynt Create, a refreshed version of the Games Development Kit, Greentube’s existing studio partners will be able to improve their pipeline and roll out quality games at a faster pace.</p>
<p>In addition, all of Greentube’s partners will be able to access the company’s network of business-to-business clients and business-to-customer brands.</p>
<p>Greentube added that the tech stack is supported by a robust microservices platform that provides a secure, reliable, robust and scalable framework. The platform also comes equipped with masterfully-designed tool support.</p>
<p>Mynt Can Revolutionize iGaming</p>
<p>Greentube is certain that Mynt has the potential to revolutionize the gaming market and usher in a new era of gamification. The company now plans to double down on its growth efforts and target more regulated markets.</p>
<p>Greentube’s chief games officer and chief financial officer, Michael Bauer, spoke about the launch of Greentube Mynt. He promised that the innovative tech stack will be “a true game-changer” for gaming companies all over the world.</p>
<p>This is only the start for the platform and we will be constantly improving it with fresh features that will further enhance the offering and improve returns for all stakeholders. We are working closely with our partners to offer the platform’s best-of-class services to as many of them as soon as it is possible. Michael Bauer, CFO and CGO, Greentube</p>
<p>In other news, Greentube just inked a LATAM-facing agreement with LatamWin, a local gambling operator.</p>
