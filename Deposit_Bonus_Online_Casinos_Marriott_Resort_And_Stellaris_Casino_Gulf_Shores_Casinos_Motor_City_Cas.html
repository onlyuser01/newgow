<p>The deployment of Zitro's slots with Casino Zagreb marked the first steps of the casino games developer in Croatia</p>
<p>Developer of gambling content Zitro announced today it has expanded its European footprint by entering the market in Croatia with Luckia Casino Zagreb.</p>
<p>Expanding Slot Offering at Casino Zagreb</p>
<p>The agreement with Spanish-based Luckia Gaming Group will allow Zitro to deliver its suite of video slots and enhance the product offering at Luckia Casino Zagreb, helping the casino lure players with gaming entertainment paired with attractive prizes.</p>
<p>Commenting on the development, Pedro Rodríguez, country manager at Luckia, pointed to two of the games that position Zitro among the industry’s leading developers of gaming content.</p>
<p>“Link King and Link Me are truly amazing products, both for players and for us as operators,” Rodríguez said, convinced that these products present “a very attractive option to diversify the full range of games” that Luckia is making available to its customers at Casino Zagreb.</p>
<p>Featuring two of Zitro’s finest, these first-class slot games operated on the Fusion Glare cabinet will bring to Luckia Casino Zagreb all the exciting features that have earned them popularity among casino players around the world and proved to be a safe bet for casino operators. Zitro’s Fusion Glare cabinets, the shortest model in the range, come with two 27-inch screens each and a new Smartdeck console.</p>
<p>At the end of last year, Zitro delivered 160 Glare Cabinets to Grupo Boldt in Argentina and continued to grow its Latin American footprint. Installed at the group’s Santa Fe, Trilenium, Tandil, del Mar, and Melincué casinos, the cabinets featured Zitro’s popular games Link Me, Link King, 88 Link, and Mega King.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Spanish land-based casino operator, Cirsa Casinos, introduced Zitro’s Mega King in Mexico to entice players with its engaging mechanics, scalable progressives, eye-catching graphics and premium sound.</p>
<p>Zitro’s First Steps in Croatia</p>
<p>On behalf of Zitro, the director of Casinos Spain, Jaime Anibal, commented on the announcement, “delighted to be able to offer” some of the [company’s] greatest hits in Croatia,” in partnership with Luckia, and grateful to its partner for the trust shown in Zitro’s products.</p>
<p>We are fully confident that Link King and Link Me will succeed in Croatia just as they are succeeding worldwide. Jaime Anibal, director of Casinos Spain</p>
<p>Operating out of Spain, Luckia Gaming Group manages several casinos globally, among which Luckia Casino Zagreb. It is located in Hotel Antunović Zagreb and first opened doors to the public in 2007 as Golden Sun Casino, and rebranded to Luckia Casino Zagreb in 2017 when the company officially launched its international brand.</p>
