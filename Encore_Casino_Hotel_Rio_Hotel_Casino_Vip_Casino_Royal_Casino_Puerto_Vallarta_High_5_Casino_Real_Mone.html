<p>GGPoker was named Live Nation Canada's official online poker partner as part of the collaboration</p>
<p>The biggest online poker room in the world, GGPoker, announced today it has teamed with Canada’s leading live event producer, Live Nation Canada, to bring unmatched experiences for both fans of poker and live music events.</p>
<p>Live Events Hand-in-Hand with Poker Games</p>
<p>The exciting new partnership between GGPoker and Live Nation Canada designates the online poker operator as the official online poker partner of the live entertainment company that connects fans across the country with their favorite music artists.</p>
<p>GGPoker’s managing director Sarne Lightman commented on the development, thrilled to see the business “join forces with Live Nation Canada” and become the company’s “official online poker partner.”</p>
<p>“This collaboration allows us to enhance the overall experience for our players by providing them with access to incredible live events alongside their favorite poker games,” Lightman said, explaining the rationale behind the agreement.</p>
<p>To celebrate the collaboration with Live Nation Canada, GGPoker announced a series of weekly freeroll tournaments, GG x Ticketmaster Gift Cards Freeroll, starting from July 2 in which players can compete to win $5,000 in Ticketmaster Gift Cards.</p>
<p>The free-to-play online poker tournaments will run at 7pm ET and will award 10 Ticketmaster Gift Cards worth $500 each, while both new and existing players will be eligible to participate.</p>
<p>For new players, the Ticketmaster Gift Cards Freeroll series will be in addition to the poker room’s Welcome Bonus, the Honeymoon for Newcomers promotion, as well as its Fish Buffet loyalty program which offers cash prizes on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Player Boycott, Road to London</p>
<p>The poker room was at the center of a controversy earlier this year when high stakes cash players decided to boycott the games, protesting against the new changes GGPoker implemented to its rake structure.</p>
<p>The group of over 90 players argued that the poker room’s rakes that have been historically high have now been pushed even higher to an extent that the rake system would not allow the players to win.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, GGPoker announced a series of online satellites, Road to London, offering players a path to the £3,300 WSOP Super Circuit Series London Main Event and the £21,200 Triton Super High Roller GGMillion$ Live, as well as the thrill of live poker action.</p>
<p>Also in June, GGPoker announced a new collaboration with Brian ‘True Geordie’ Davis under which the poker pro will represent the poker room at WSOP and participate in an exclusive tournament.</p>
<p>For Live Nation Canada, the collaboration with GGPoker is the second major development in the month, following right in the footsteps of the agreement with Great Canadian Entertainment.</p>
