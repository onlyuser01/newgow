    <h1>Shelbyville Indiana Casino Casinos Near Branson Mo Free Bonus No Deposit Casino Hotels Near Oxford C</h1>

<p>So, Richard, I wish you a merry Christmas, but I am rejecting your complaint from obvious reasons which I am repeating over and over.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in some cases, we are just wasting our time.</p>
<p>Not mentioning that we do this service for free because we have a responsibility and trying to make this industry better and safer.</p>
<p>Where we spent lots of time to analyse the situation and eventually help the player.</p>
<p>If you believe that we are not helping the players, then you should see, for example, this complaint:</p>
<p>We already contacted the casino regarding the terms and condition and suggested them to eighter change the restriction rules or let the player chose the nationality during a registration. If they fail to do so, it will have a negative effect on the rating, of course, but it has no impact on your case.</p>
<p>Why they have a good rating from us? Because the casino is managed by the same people as Play Fortuna Casino, which has a perfect rating from us. And if you spend some time on our website and not only for complaining you could find information about how we calculate the rating https://casino.guru/our-casino-reviews or how long it takes till you get a response https://casino.guru/complaint-resolution-instructions</p>
<p>If you decide to make a small pub in your garden and some except your neighbours some noisy unfriendly German tourist start coming to your pub, you can ban them from doing so, and it's your decision, and the same is for the online casinos. They can ban you, or chose not to accept players based on which criteria they want, or ban the players as far as they always pay out the remaining balance.</p>
<p>I already explain to you why the casino has a right to close your account. And it is up to them how they set up the rules for the players' registration.</p>
<p>You refused to do a verification call. With the casino (in the second case) and with me when I confronted you about the IPs issue, and I asked your "son" to make a Skype call with me. All this indicates that you have something to hide + you completely ignored my questions about if the casino returned your deposit. So I assume your motivation is not to solve your complaint. Which reminds me a group of Ireland fraudsters we recently banned from our website, father and son and one couple. At least the style of writing and the way how this group work is the same.</p>
<p>You left a very negative review on Trustpilot before the complaint was even processed and assigned to me, and soon another two negative reviews were following. (Of course, we reported these reviews)</p>
<p>From all this complaint and another one, which you submitted, I don't have a feeling that you want to solve something, more likely you are only wasting our time.</p>
<p>Based on the information from the casino we believe they can close your account because they don't owe you any money and they have more legal ways how to do so, and they can do it anytime.</p>
<p>We investigated the case, and casino gave us information that they sent you the last deposit and indeed closed your account. By doing this, you gained a €3 profit.</p>
<p>Richard, you submitted a complaint where our role is to determine who have right in the case, you or the casino.</p>

<p>You stated that the casino banned you and didn't return your deposit.</p>

<p>I don't remember you confirming any of my questions regarding your refund.</p>
