<p>The fast-growing iGaming provider known to develop up to eight new online slot games every month, Pragmatic Play, announced the release of a new title. The online gambling industry provider confirmed Monday it released Wild Bison Charge, a new adventure-themed slot that takes online players on a trip through the prairies.</p>
<p>The new game delivers engaging experiences and grants the players a chance to benefit from a buildable bonus round. This popular functionality can be found in other Pragmatic Play recent hits such as Jane Hunter and The Mask Of Montezuma, Kingdom Of The Dead as well as Excalibur Unleashed.</p>
<p>Yet, Wild Bison Charge features a different theme, depicting symbols of eagles, coyotes, bison, bears and other creatures that roam the desert landscape. Besides symbols with wild animals, the recent slot game uses standard card symbols too. The new 5x5 reel slot has an RTP of 96.03% and grants players a chance to win different prizes.</p>
<p>Irina Cornides, Pragmatic Play's Chief Operating Officer, shared her excitement in a statement released by the company on May 1, 2023. She said: "Wild Bison Charge focuses on the multipliers available in both the base game and free spins round to transform pay anywhere wins into huge hits."</p>
<p>Finally, Cornides explained: "The ability for these wilds to combine their values and hold throughout the free spins builds big win anticipation during play to create even more excitement for players."</p>
<p>To trigger a win, players of the new game need to have at least eight corresponding symbols anywhere on the reels. Different combinations enable the players to win prizes that vary in size. "Wilds are also present on the reels, substituting for all other symbols except the free spin awarding scatters and can land with a potential random multiplier up to 5x," explains Pragmatic Play. In case a player secures multiple wild multipliers, they can benefit from increasing the potential of their total payout.</p>
<p>On the other hand, three or more scatters help activate a special bonus round that delivers up to 15 free spins when five scatters are hit. For the duration of such rounds, wilds stay on the reel which increases the potential for a big payout, reveals the game developer.</p>
<p>The recently released slot comes on the heels of an important deal announced by Pragmatic Play. Last week, the company confirmed it joined forces with VÃ­velo24, a trusted and popular gambling operator in Mexico. The deal helped boost the offering of the operator while at the same time strengthening Pragmatic Play's presence in the Latin American region.</p>
