    <h1>Kwataqnuk Resort Casino Polson Washington State Casinos Sandia Casino Albuquerque Walker Mn Casino C</h1>

<p>Big Time Gaming has given the popular Pirate Pays video slot a quick do-over and the game will now enjoy the company’s proprietary Megaways mechanic for even more booty and nautical exploits. This high-seas and high-volatility slot makes good use of the pirate theme, creating captivating gameplay that has launched exclusively with Kindred Group’s online operator Unibet on Wednesday and will proceed to a full-scale launch on October 27 through Relax Platform.</p>
<p>For those of you who enjoy swashbuckling adventures, Pirate Pays Megaways will prove just the game you have been looking for. The game is rich in stacked wilds and mega-triggers, a special interactive bonus round that puts you in the captain seat, and a multiplier worth facing off the Kraken for.</p>
<p>Pirate Pays Megaways Features and Gameplay</p>
<p>True to the Megaways lineage, the game provides you with 117,649 winning combinations to explore on your own time. Thanks to the unique nature of the Megaways mechanic, you will notice that the layout grid will rejuggle after every spin and provide you with a different number of rows to create, usually between two and seven, the most entertaining experience for you.</p>
<p>In your adventures at sea, you will run into the feared Kraken who will take the role of the bonus round where you will get to enjoy 20 free spins and multipliers that will further boost your experience. You need not fear the Kraken but take on it to earn more notoriety and booty for your flag and ship.</p>
<p>Bring the Kraken to its metaphorical knees and you will be greatly rewarded. To make things even better, there is a dedicated Enhanced Bonus Round which is triggered through the scatter symbol to provide you with even more winning opportunities.</p>
<p>Turning the Pirate Cliché on Its Head</p>
<p>Commenting on this release, BTG chief executive Nick Robinson said that the company was happy to be breathing life into the pirate-themed format, “turning the cliché on its head.”</p>
<p>“Pirate Pays is a slot that’s filled with some really interesting new elements, but it never compromises on entertainment value. That’s why this is a game that will appeal to all types of players from scurvy seadogs to regular, everyday landlubbers.” BTG chief executive Nick Robinson</p>
<p>Kindred Group head of exclusive content Pierluigi Rinaldi also welcomed the opportunity for Unibet to be hosting this unique and improved BTG title. The innovative mechanics featured in Pirates Pays, Rinaldi said, would be a worthwhile addition to the brand’s strong portfolio of games and commitment to a player-first approach.</p>
<p>BTG’s signature style in delivering an elevated Megaways experience is written all over the game offers you strong payout potential with the base game hosting a 15,500x multiplier on your bet and the Kraken Bonus Round taking this all the way up to 104,400x maximum payout calculated on your bet amount.</p>
