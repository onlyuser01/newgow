<p>Dear Marcel,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. First, I would like to point out that creating multiple accounts is prohibited by most casinos, I checked the casino’s general T&amp;Cs (https://trueflip.com/terms-of-use) and I found this:</p>
<p>"You are allowed to have only one account and register this personally. If you attempt to open more than one account, all accounts you try to open may be blocked or closed and any bets and bonuses may be voided. At True Flip’s sole discretion and in the event that We consider that multiple Accounts have been opened in genuine error, We may agree to credit the first Account which You would have opened with Us with any of balance remaining on Your additional Account(s). Should We have reasonable grounds to believe that fraud has been committed or attempted, We reserve the right to suspend, revoke, or cancel any related transaction, any bonus or any other promotion without prejudice to any other action or redress In these Terms and Conditions, a reference to ‘fraud’ shall be deemed to include ‘bonus abuse’. Bonus abuse includes, but is not limited to, opening more than one Account in order to claim an additional bonus or benefit."</p>
<p>When exactly did you block your first account? Did you claim any bonuses with both accounts? Have you tried discussing this issue with the casino? Please forward any relevant communication between you and the casino to kristina.s@casino.guru.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Kristina</p>
