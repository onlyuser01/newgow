<p>Slotmill is launching its product portfolio with SuprNation, an operator of several iGaming brands, including Duelz, VoodooDreams, and NYspins. SuprNation and Slotmill will turn to Relax Gaming to deliver the product across the brands.</p>
<p>Commenting on this opportunity, both Slotmill and SuprNation welcomed it as a positive development for the companies. Slotmill founder Johan Ohman welcomed the opportunity to end the year on a strong note for the company by teaming up with SuprNation and boosting the supplier’s footprint:</p>
<p>“We believe our games will be a great complement to their existing offering and look forward to seeing how ‘Fast Track’ and “Burst Mode” will be received by the players.” Slotmill founder Johan Ohman</p>
<p>SuprNation casino manager Rasmus Hammar spoke highly of Slotmill, and the company’s distinct portfolio of games which bring on smooth gameplay and remarkable gameplay to the experience players can now receive at SuprNation’s established brands.</p>
<p>Strong Game Variety and Projects in Pipeline</p>
<p>“Particularly excited to see how our players respond to the new innovative game features,” Hammar added. Slotmill has a selection of outstanding products that have been developed for the modern market.</p>
<p>Presently, the studio has several titles on the market, including Lucky Lucifer, Vegas Gold, Three Samurai, Outlaws, Vikings Creed, Star Spell, and others. The studio’s latest game, Fruit Smash, is due in February, and the one after it, Drunken Sailors, is yet to have a release date. More are in the pipeline. The company released Sands of Eternity as its last game for the year on December 7.</p>
<p>Slotmill has been quickly looking to expand its reach by teaming up with various leading aggregators in the iGaming space. The company signed individual partnerships with BetConstruct and Slotegrator in December.</p>
