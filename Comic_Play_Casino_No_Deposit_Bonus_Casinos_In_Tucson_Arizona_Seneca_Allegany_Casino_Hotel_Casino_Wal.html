<p>Leading US sportsbook BetMGM is about to debut in a seventh state in the United States with the company launching its mobile betting app in Tennessee on Sunday, November 1.</p>
<p>BetMGM’s App Launches in Tennessee in Days</p>
<p>GVC and MGM Resorts International sportsbook subsidiary BetMGM revealed plans today to make its dedicated mobile sports betting experience available in Tennessee starting November 1.</p>
<p>BetMGM CEO Adam Greenblatt commented on the upcoming release, reassuring the public that the company has been working hard to bring an engaging and cutting-edge sports betting experience, which is BetMGM’s signature style.</p>
<p>“Our relationship with MGM Resorts enables BetMGM users in the Volunteer State to earn rewards, from hotel suites to dinners at award-winning restaurants,” he said.</p>
<p>BetMGM has been working with regulators in Tennessee to make it possible to be among the first entries into the state and cater to passionate fan bases who appreciate sports.</p>
<p>Naturally, BetMGM is part of the MGM Resorts’ M life Rewards program, which means that Tennessee sports fans will be able to have a world-class experience at all of the company’s flagship casinos, including the Bellagio and MGM Grand in Las Vegas, Beau Rivage in Mississippi and MGM National Harbor in Maryland, to name a few.</p>
<p>BetMGM brings a powerful betting app solution that allows sports fans to have a quick access to various markets, odds, and statistics. Bettors will benefit from an assortment of betting options and teams and players to pick from.</p>
<p>Sportsbook’s Partnerships with Sports Teams Expand</p>
<p>BetMGM has already made forays into the state, striking a partnership with NFL franchise Tennessee Titans and making an example of collaboration between a sportsbook and a sports franchise.</p>
<p>With Tennessee now added to the list, BetMGM has broken ground in no fewer than seven states, along with Colorado, Indiana, Mississippi, Nevada, New Jersey, and finally West Virginia.</p>
<p>The app is going live in Tennessee for both Android and iOS on November 1, when the true sports betting bonanza may start. In the meantime, BetMGM has just expanded on its existing partnership with the Detroit Red Wings, a National Hockey League (NHL) team.</p>
<p>The sportsbook previously endorsed another NFL team, the Las Vegas Raiders, and before that, the company teamed up with the Detroit Lions.</p>
