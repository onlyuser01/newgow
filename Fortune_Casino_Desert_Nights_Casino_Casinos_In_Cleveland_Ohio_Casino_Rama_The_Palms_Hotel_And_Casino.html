    <h1>Fortune Casino Desert Nights Casino Casinos In Cleveland Ohio Casino Rama The Palms Hotel And Casino</h1>

<p>BetMGM has entered into a partnership with Madison Square Garden Sports Corp and Madison Square Garden Entertainment. The companies will work on boosting brand awareness for BetMGM’s sports betting operations at the time that New York is forging ahead with a new plan to open up the sluice gates of mobile betting in the state.</p>
<p>Hopes are that the Empire State could have online betting by next year’s Super Bowl. BetMGM, which is one of the licensed entities in the state, is now entering as an official sports betting partner of the New York Knicks, New York Rangers, and the Madison Square Garden Arena, home of the aforementioned teams.</p>
<p>Boosting BetMGM’s Brand Profile Ahead of Mobile Betting</p>
<p>BetMGM will benefit from the partnership by having the opportunity to build up its brand recognition across New York with MSG featuring courtside and ribbon LED signage. This comes along with the GardenVision features that will be added during Knicks games and Zamboni branding and dashboard signage during Rangers games the press release specifies.</p>
<p>The betting giant will benefit from a number of activations that will take place on social media, including through Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook exposure on the Knicks and Rangers’ official channels. BetMGM users will also have access to a number of special contests and premium experiences that will be developed in collaboration between the company and the sports franchises.</p>
<p>Madison Square Garden as the World’s Premier Sports Arena</p>
<p>MGS Entertainment VP of marketing partnerships, Ron Skotarczak, welcomed the opportunity to be teaming up with BetMGM, a leader in the sports betting and gaming industry:</p>
<p>“MSG Sports and MSG Entertainment are made up of world-renowned brands that set industry standards for excellence, exposure, and engagement– making us ideal partners to help drive sports betting’s continued growth.” MGS Entertainment VP of marketing partnerships, Ron Skotarczak</p>
<p>The Rangers and Knicks coverage will not be all BetMGM gets. In fact, the brand’s IP will be pushed during live games of the New Jersey Devils and New York Islanders, making for a powerful media activation that will come to define the brand visibility of the betting giant in the Empire State.</p>
<p>BetMGM CRO Matt Prevost was thrilled to see the brand connect with some of the most prominent sports franchises in New York and not least through Madison Square Garden, an iconic facility in the beating heart of the state. Prevost did not hesitate to call Madison Square Garden the world’s most famous arena, home to legendary franchises.</p>
