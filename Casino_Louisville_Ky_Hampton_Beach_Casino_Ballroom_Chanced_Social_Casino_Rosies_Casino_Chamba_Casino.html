    <h1>Casino Louisville Ky Hampton Beach Casino Ballroom Chanced Social Casino Rosies Casino Chamba Casino</h1>

<p>Hello. Thank you for your question. Let me try to explain it a bit to you if you don't mind.</p>
<p>License of a casino is only one of many aspects we take into consideration, when making a review and in this particular case, the casino's license status was updated just last week, and as of today you can see the safety index slightly decreased (9,6 -&gt; 8,9).</p>
<p>I can understand your doubts though, that casinos who operate without any license are usually not very good, but this does not necessarily mean, that there can't be a casino without license that is actually good. As long as casinos treat players fairly, pay out their winnings and do not have complaints from players, we can get behind the fact that they do not have any license, although of course we'd prefer if they would have one.</p>
<p>I'd like to quote a small part of our article on how do we review casinos, which you are welcomed to take a look at here.</p>
<p>"Also, it's important to note that each case is considered separately. Sometimes, the casino has a valid reason for doing something we usually find unfair (e.g. having win limits because of regulations, operating without a license because of running anonymously, etc.). In these cases, we communicate with the casino to make sure we are being fair not only to players, but also to casinos."</p>
<p>The fact that CSGOPolygon Casino operates without any license is actually reflected in its safety index, however there are other factors which counterweight this situation.</p>
<p>In this case, we have not found any unfair rules in T&amp;Cs of this casino and there are no unresolved complaints, which would decrease the safety index, nor any other unfair factors. Considering the fact that the casino seems to be operating for quite a long time now and there aren't any hints that would hinder its reputation in general, we may assume the high safety index is on point.</p>
<p>Have you tried this casino personally, if yes what games did you play and what is your experience overall?</p>
