<p>The second round of March Madness saw the odds-on favorites run the table, as all 16 teams took care of business and advanced to the Sweet 16.</p>

<p>That isn’t to say there weren’t some very close calls, none more notable than No. 1 overall seed Duke. The Blue Devils were nearly upset by No. 9 UCF in the second round, but freshmen duo Zion Williamson and RJ Barrett saved the season with two last-second scores. Duke prevailed 77-76.</p>
<p>The will to win of Zion and RJ, you can’t measure it. It’s just there,” Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski said. “Look, we’re a young group, but what they did at the end of the game, willing us to win, was sensational.”</p>
<p>Bettors who took points on the Knights still won, as Duke was spotting UCF 13.5 points in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>All four No. 1 seeds remain. UVA beat No. 9 Oklahoma 63-51, UNC made easy work of No. 9 Washington 81-59, and Gonzaga got by No. 9 Baylor 83-71.</p>
<p>How Sweet It Is</p>
<p>ESPN Stats &amp; Info reports that the March Madness sports betting favorites all winning in the second round was the first time that has occurred since the NCAA expanded the tournament to 64 teams in 1985.</p>
<p>The 16 remaining teams will battle Thursday and Friday in hopes of securing a spot in the Elite Eight. Here are the early odds for this week’s contests.</p>
<p>No. 2 Tennessee is spotting No. 3 Purdue one point No. 1 Virginia is favored by 7.5 over No. 12 Oregon No. 1 Gonzaga is giving No. 4 Florida State seven points No. 2 Michigan is favored by just two over No. 3 Texas Tech No. 1 Duke is spotting No. 4 Virginia Tech eight points No. 2 Kentucky is a 2.5-point favorite on No. 3 Houston No. 1 UNC is spotting No. 5 Auburn a handful of points</p>
<p>Unlike the second round of the men’s basketball tournament, the first round did see some upsets. As Casino.org thought might happen, No. 5 Wisconsin fell victim to No. 12 Oregon, No. 11 Ohio State was able to edge out No. 6 Iowa State, and No. 12 Murray State beat No. 5 Marquette.</p>
<p>Title Odds</p>
<p>Despite their close call, Duke remains the odds-on favorite to win the title. The Westgate SuperBook has the Blue Devils at 5/2, or implied odds of 28.57 percent. A $100 bet would net $250 on those odds.</p>
<p>Gonzaga and Virginia are next at 9/2. Bettors will be rewarded $450 for every $100 wagered on that line. North Carolina (8/1) and Michigan State (10/1) round out the top five.</p>
<p>For bettors in search of a Sweet 16 team with long odds that would pay out handsomely should they somehow find a way to cut down the nets in Minneapolis, Oregon has the longest Las Vegas line at 80/1.</p>
<p>If the Ducks continue their Cinderella run and go all the way, bettors who take the unlikely scenario will net $8,000 for every $100 bet.</p>
