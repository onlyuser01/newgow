    <h1>Miccosukee Resort Casino Northern California Casinos Maryland Live Casino Hotel Buffalo Bills Casino</h1>

<p>I have an account at Galaxyno and after I fulfilled the withdrawal requirements, which was more than 8000 R$ in bets. When I tried to make a withdrawal of 100 R$, I received an email saying that my request was canceled and they canceled the ENTIRE BALANCE of my account, this does not exist, I have seen other complaints here about this.</p>
<p>They don't clearly state which games cannot be played with bonuses, only a few appear and alert.</p>
<p>And even so I played a lot and in games that had no restriction, the correct thing is to cancel only the games that could not. And they warn you that such a game cannot be played, they let you play just when you go to cash out, they show up with a bunch of bureaucracy. Completely unfair to the customer.</p>
