    <h1>The Big Easy Casino Muckleshoot Casino Resort Auburn Way South Auburn Wa Newcastle Casino Pendleton</h1>

<p>On Dec 21, 2021 I called and requested dispute on 6 unauthorize transactions. Received the dispute form Case2112210653C on Dec 22, 2021. On Jan 17, 2021 I called and requested dispute on 1 unauthorize transaction Case22011800445C, still waiting on the form from BitPay. Ranging from Dec 13, 2021 thru Dec 22, 2021 all totaling 359.39. They have used my Virtual card ending in 1553. At this time both my physical card and virtual card was cancelled. I never given anyone my physical card or given both cards information to make any type purchases. I am a very stingy person when it comes to my money and will protect it with my life if I need too. Ten days later I called my bank about the provisional credit. They said still doing the investigation which I thought that is what provisional credit is for. Consumers gets a credit while the investigation still on going. If the dispute doesn't get qualify, the credit gets recalled back. As of today I never did received the provisional credit. I started to look into these merchants that charged my debit card and these names didn't make any sense to me. I had a good friend of mine who is a retired police officer looked at these charges and right away he recognizes the merchant names and said that these charges actually came from a online casino named sportsandcasino.com. I asked him how you know that and he said because he plays at that same casino and showed me his bank statement. Sure enough it shows the same merchant name. Couldn't find a phone number but sent an email to that casino. Got an email from that casino on 01/18/2022 asking for a statement from my bank showing the charges. I've sent them the bank statement and the dispute form from my bank to that casino along with a name Jean Jordon, his email address and his username for that casino. I wanted them to check to see if he has an account with them and if he does, to see if my card was used in his account. I have not heard from them. Heard from a friend of mine that his roommate when he starts drinking or comes home drunk he loves to brag on how much money he wins with so many online casino and poker sites he has. Thats how I got that information on him for that one casino. My friend got that out of him. He has been to my house in the past when I throw a poker party. The last poker party I threw, come to think of he was very quite. Unusual cuz everyone thought he was sick or have the covid. Plus he left early. At that time in the middle of December had no ideal of those charges to my debit card and just recently I was getting the information on Jean Jordon. And get this my friend roommate can't be found anywhere. My friend told me when he came home after work he was gone. He just grab a few things and left. Right now he is looking thru all his crap to see if any signs of using my debit card. He's 100% sure he did and I believe him.I have emailed all the information on Jean Jordon but they have not emailed me back. I do believe with the information I emailed to them qualifies me for the provisional credit which I really need badly.</p>
