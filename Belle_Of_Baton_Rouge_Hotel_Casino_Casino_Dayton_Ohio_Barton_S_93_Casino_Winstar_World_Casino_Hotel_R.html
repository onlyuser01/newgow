    <h1>Belle Of Baton Rouge Hotel Casino Casino Dayton Ohio Barton S 93 Casino Winstar World Casino Hotel R</h1>

<p>The leading provider of online casino entertainment, Videoslots, secured one of the most wanted awards within the iGaming industry. At a glamorous ceremony on Monday night, the company was named Online Casino Operator of the Year at the famous International Gaming Awards (IGAs) 2023.</p>
<p>The prestigious event took place at Savoy Hotel in London, UK. The latest award further boosted Videoslots' continuously growing popularity. In fact, the recognition complemented a double win secured by the company at IGAs in 2022.</p>
<p>Famous for recognizing iGaming suppliers and operators that deliver unique experiences and constantly strive to improve, the IGAs is one of the most-anticipated ceremonies within the gambling sector. The award resonates with Videoslots already well-established global reputation.</p>
<p>What's more, the company has been constantly growing its portfolio of online content. By now, Videoslots delivers more online slots than any other operator, enabling its online customers to engage in unique experiences and find the game that best fits their taste.</p>
<p>Ulle Skottling, Videoslots' Deputy CEO, shared his excitement in a statement saying: "We are absolutely thrilled to win yet another IGA award and I want to thank the whole team for all their hard work."</p>
<p>He explained that the company's expert team remains dedicated to delivering supreme slot experiences for its customers. At the same time, Skottling said that it is delightful to see Videoslots secure the recent award in competition with excellent operators. Finally, he said: "However, the hard work continues as we want to give players a unique and thrilling casino experience."</p>
<p>Videoslots has been continuously growing for the last decade. The company currently takes pride in offering more than 9,000 games from nearly 200 game providers. It was back in August when Videoslots celebrated its 8,000th title. Further expanding its content, back in January, the company celebrated the addition of its 9,000th title.</p>
<p>The 9,000th Videoslots title was delivered by Pragmatic Play and its name was Mammoth Gold Megaways. Surpassing this milestone moment, now the company remains focused on expanding further its offering by delivering its 10,000th title soon.</p>
<p>Besides expanding its content offering, again in January, Videoslots expanded its senior-level team. At the time, the company revealed it hired Matthew Muscat as its Chief Financial Officer. This strategic hire sought to help the Videoslots expand further and propel itself on a path to growth.</p>
