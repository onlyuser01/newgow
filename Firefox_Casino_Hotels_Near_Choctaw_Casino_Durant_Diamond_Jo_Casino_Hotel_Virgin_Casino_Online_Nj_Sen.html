<p>Racing content supplier XB Net announced today it has signed a distribution rights deal with India’s operator Betindiaraces to strengthen its position in the country’s nascent racing market.</p>
<p>India Audiences to Prove a Boon for Racing</p>
<p>The agreement between XB Net and Betindiaraces, a platform powered by Sportswin Software, will see the premium horse racing content supplier deliver live pictures and local pool-wagering services from a network of racetracks in North America and Australia.</p>
<p>Commenting on the agreement, Simon Fraser, XB Net’s senior vice president of International, expressed his excitement that XB Net’s content has widened its geographic influence in India, where “underserved audiences” will soon become a “boon for racing” with regards to the anticipated wider regulation.</p>
<p>“It’s an exciting time to be continuing to grow our global audience and products, with our core North American racing service now ably abetted by some cracking racing from Australia.” Simon Fraser, SVP, International, XB Net</p>
<p>Licensed via the revered Royal Calcutta Turf Club, the deal will bring to the operator’s programming schedule a steady stream of wagering opportunities that have already proved their efficiency in increasing digital dwell-time for both new and existing customers.</p>
<p>“XB Net’s one-stop Australian and North American racing services have really turned our customers on to the merits of international racing, both during and after the pandemic, generating and retaining new revenue streams in the process.” Sharath Narayana, Co-Founder, Sportswin Software</p>
<p>Encouraging Start to the Partnership</p>
<p>Narayana was convinced that Australian racing will “fit effortlessly into” the operator’s offering due to its time zone “naturally preceding India’s domestic action” and sports programming.</p>
<p>He was also eager to see how the newly added US racing rights will perform over the summer which will be packed with racing highlights but judging by the significant spikes around the Triple Crown events of the Preakness and the Belmont Stake, he believes that the partnership will be exciting and rewarding.</p>
<p>The deal will allow Betindiaraces to leverage XB Net’s partnership with a number of Australian racecourses under the Melbourne Racing Club to draw from a portfolio of content from over 700 Australian meetings, including from venues such as Caulfield, Moonee Valley and Flemington.</p>
<p>Betindiaraces will also benefit from XB Net’s new US racing rights which include access to highlights from a larger pool of global events, including the Pegasus World Cup, two legs of the Triple Crown – the Preakness and the Belmont Stakes – as well as the Breeders’ Cup World Championship at Keeneland.</p>
<p>“XB Net shares our vision and focus on enabling digital enterprise by leveraging technology as a valuable asset, helping streamline and optimize our partners’ operations so that we can increase revenues, improve the customer experience and return value to the underlying sport and its stakeholders,” Narayana concluded.</p>
<p>The agreement with Betindiaraces further strengthens XB Net’s presence in India after a previous digital distribution rights deal with NorthAlley. The racing supplier and the established platform teamed in March in a similar agreement as the one XB Net has signed with Betindiaraces.</p>
