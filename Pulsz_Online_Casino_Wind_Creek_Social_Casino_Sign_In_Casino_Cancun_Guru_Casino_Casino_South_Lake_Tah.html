    <h1>Pulsz Online Casino Wind Creek Social Casino Sign In Casino Cancun Guru Casino Casino South Lake Tah</h1>

<p>They actually told me that they were going to process it two days after October 9th which was you know the Monday following and it never happened so I messaged them again and they told me again that they're going to check the process and that's when they hit me with the it seems like we had some trouble with your identification it seems like it doesn't make any sense my your identification we want to make sure it's your name then then they asked me my full name. It was really getting me angry I was like are you kidding me anyways yeah so they wanted me to go through some verification process again like the same time like last time and I said no I'm not going to do it because I did it last time and I emailed them and I their support and I emailed their their complaints department they emailed me back twice first time saying that they're sorry for the inconveniences and in order for them to continue with the process they need my full name my address my username and my phone number and my date of birth I sent it to them by email and they sent me another email back saying thank you for your response and your security check and then they told me that I have to go through another validation process with hooyu I said no. I sent them an email back and I'll copy paste it and show you what I wrote to them</p>
<p>Hi this is Melanie Beland.</p>
<p>As I previously mentioned August 11th 2021 I won 1061$ . You guys asked me for my identification cards and I was verified it took over a month and a complaint to GC gaming Curacao complaints, Curacao gaming control board as well as going to casino Guru to file a complaint. I surprised you don't remember 2 months ago I received that payment September 11th.</p>
<p>Now your asking for verification documents again . I've been verified less than 2 months ago and 50 times over . I won't go through this process again . I gave you my identification already. I spoke to hooyus head office and they understand that I dont have a driver's license and a passport only my identification card which is used worldwide for every casino I play with. These casino have treated me with respect and value my loyalty as a customer. This is the reason why I played again on your casino . Your words and I quote " next time it will be much faster to process your withdrawal" so I believed you and here we are again not even 2 months ago and you forgot what I went through with you guys. I won 840$ Oct 9th 2021. It was to be processed on the 11th I asked about it and I got the same old song and dance I'm not doing this again. That's why I made 3 complaints already once again with GC gaming Curacao and Curacao gaming control board and casino Guru. They are even shocked that your asking for verification documents again. Makes no sense. I want my money processed. I'm fed up with games . Your license is invalid and and is against the law what you are doing. I would like my money please and thank you. Regards Melanie Beland.</p>
<p>The email that I sent to them so they haven't respond back to me I am at my wits end I have screenshots of them saying it will be sent I have screenshots of saying don't make a complaint I have screenshots of them even saying that my identification was wrong that my name was wrong if I'm sure that's my name they were rude just like last time I'm fed up with this I just want my money like I don't know why they always have to play these games like it's it's not fun you know and it's not fair to me it's not fair. You know I think I'm entitled to the money that I won fairly over there you know I know the rules and regulations I play with a lot of casinos and I never had any issues with my verification process never but with them as soon as I win it's always an issue and I see that with everybody else with all the reviews they get crap so you know like if you would like some screenshots I will give them to you let me know I have no problems doing that but yeah they they said unless I do the verification process that you know they have to make sure that the money belongs to me or I'm the person that the money belongs to that they're sending it to the right person it doesn't make any sense that I said you know you've done this before you guys don't remember 2 months ago not even a month ago it doesn't make any sense anyways it's stressing me out you know at a time like this there's no need for that. Thank you.</p>
