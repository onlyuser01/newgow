<p>Cyber Monday, the online shopping bonanza that follows Thanksgiving Thursday and Black Friday, is once again offering up a smorgasbord of internet deals. And that extends to deep discounts on Las Vegas casino hotel rooms, shows, and dining.</p>

<p>Though Cyber Monday doesn’t officially begin until 12:01 a.m., online booking discounts are available now at numerous Las Vegas Strip casino resorts, as Black Friday and Cyber Monday continue to morph together.</p>
<p>What’s better than a Thanksgiving dinner? Discounts. Freebies. Any chance to stretch your travel dollars,” Los Angeles Times travel editor Catharine Hamm explains.</p>
<p>Las Vegas has become increasingly more expensive to visit of late due to the elimination of free parking at certain casinos, elevated resort fees, and even add-on service charges on food and beverage. But today, deals can be found right from your living room.</p>
<p>Hotel Deals</p>
<p>Numerous Strip casino resorts are advertising substantially reduced rates on their hotel rooms for bookings made today.</p>
<p>MGM Resorts, the largest casino operator in Nevada, is advertising room discounts at all of its Las Vegas casinos.</p>
<p>Bellagio, Aria, Vdara, MGM Grand, Mandalay Bay, Delano, Park MGM, NoMad, Mirage, New York-New York, Luxor, and Excalibur rooms are all currently being offered at 30 percent off. Rooms at Circus Circus are even more discounted at 49 percent.</p>
<p>MGM claims the offers are “our best deals of the year.” The casino operator is additionally discounting rooms by 20 percent at Beau Rivage and Gold Strike (Mississippi), MGM Grand Detroit, MGM National Harbor (Maryland), and MGM Springfield (Massachusetts). A classic king at the Borgata is $69 Sun-Thurs, and king suite $99 – both deep discounts compared to typical rates for the Atlantic City casino.</p>
<p>Caesars Entertainment is offering up to 40 percent off nightly rates for its 10 properties in Las Vegas. They include Caesars Palace, Paris, Planet Hollywood, Flamingo, Linq, and Cromwell.</p>
<p>Sahara is discounting rooms by 25 percent, Station Casinos 40 percent, and Venetian and Palazzo 33 percent. Treasure Island and The Cosmopolitan are offering buy-one-get-one (BOGO) deals – book one night, get another free.</p>
<p>Golden Nugget is offering resort fee-free bookings for reservations through January 2, 2021. Dining credits or free buffets are included in bookings at Treasure Island and Station Casinos properties.</p>
<p>Entertainment Discounts</p>
<p>The Cosmopolitan is selling $79 Reserve A tickets for its Opium show for dates December 8 through September 6. Tickets are normally $109 – a 28 percent discount.</p>
<p>Blue Man Group shows at Luxor are offering a two-ticket package for $99 for shows between December 1-22, and January 5 through June 30, 2020. Standard tickets are usually $72 each.</p>
<p>Absinthe at Caesars Palace is offering $20 off any ticket, and the Atomic Saloon at The Venetian is offering $48 off each ticket with no added fees. The Cirque du Soleil show Mystere at Treasure Island is selling tickets 50 percent off for shows through April 2020.</p>
