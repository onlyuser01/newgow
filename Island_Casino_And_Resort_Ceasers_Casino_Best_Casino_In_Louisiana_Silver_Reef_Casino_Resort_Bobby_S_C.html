    <h1>Island Casino And Resort Ceasers Casino Best Casino In Louisiana Silver Reef Casino Resort Bobby S C</h1>

<p>Gibraltar is a British Overseas Territory located to the south of Spain on the Iberian Peninsula. With an area of just 26 square miles, Gibraltar enjoys low taxes and zero VAT, making it an attractive place for online gambling companies to put down roots. Online gambling is major contributing factor to Gibraltar's economy, alongside tourism and financial services.</p>
<p>The Gibraltar Licensing Authority operates in partnership with the Gambling Commissioner under the Ministry of Finance, and is regulated in accordance with the Gibraltar Gambling Act of 2005.</p>
<p>Quality, not quantity</p>
<p>The GLA is considered one of the more difficult regulators for operators to obtain a license from, and even states on its website that it "traditionally only considers blue chip companies" that already have a reputable history of gambling activities in other jurisdictions. Nevertheless, it doesn't adhere to this religiously, and the jurisdiction will still consider start-ups as long as they have appropriate funding and meet the necessary requirements.</p>
<p>Note: At the time of writing, only 46 companies can boast a license from Gibraltar, including online casinos and game providers. The authority prefers to keep the list deliberately small to maintain high standards and a competitive market.</p>
<p>The GLA states that its mission is to provide properly regulated and licensed facilities which are fair, secure and transparent while also taking into account the need for player protection and social responsibilities.</p>
<p>The authority outlines many guidelines for operators pertaining to procedures regarding advertising, the payment of prize money/winnings, Anti-Money Laundering and Responsible Gambling to mention but a few. Companies wishing to obtain a license need to prepare themselves to provide a clear business plan, effective policies and be completely transparent about the source of their funding. Licensees must also display how they plan to contribute to the economy of Gibraltar, and as one of the main aims of the regulator is to prevent crime within gambling, those with any criminal history or associations need not apply. Remote gambling operators and their products must also be tested and certified as compliant with the regulatory standards by a number of approved independent test houses.</p>
