<p>The extended and new partnerships come just in time for the upcoming 2023 motorsports season</p>
<p>The speedway that hosts races and is currently the only stop for NASCAR and INDYCAR in Texas, the Texas Motor Speedway (TMS), confirmed Wednesday it has renewed multiple existing commercial deals. At the same time, TMS acknowledged it inked two new collaborations with companies based in Texas.</p>

The latest announcement confirms that the aforementioned businesses, under multi-year deals, will continue to hold their roles with TMS.</p>
<p>The Speedway’s collaboration with The Dallas Morning News dates back to 2005. Over the years, the duo’s partnership has been growing from strength to strength. Per the terms of the collaboration, the media will remain an Official Partner of the TMS.</p>
<p>On the other hand, TMS also continues its collaboration with the WinStar World Casino and Resort.
