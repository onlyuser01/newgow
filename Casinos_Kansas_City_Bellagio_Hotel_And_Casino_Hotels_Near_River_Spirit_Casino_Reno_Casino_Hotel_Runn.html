<p>In belated news from last week, the European Casino Association (ECA) has confirmed that it is admitting the United Kingdom and casino operators back as members. During the ECA General Assembly held at Casino Baden in Austria on September 28 and September 29, the organization confirmed that eight casino operators from the United Kingdom have been approved to rejoin. These include Hippodrome Casino, Les Ambassadeurs, Crown Aspinalls, Genting Casinos UK, Metropolitan Gaming, Rank Group, Aspers Group, and others.</p>
<p>The Return of the Eight</p>
<p>ECA chairman Per Jaldung welcomed the opportunity to be bringing back these operators following their departure due to Brexit back in 2020. Jaldung was excited about the opportunity to have these members rejoin and participate in the strengthening of the European brick-and-mortar gaming sector once again:</p>
<p>The UK has a thriving land-based gaming industry, and we are extremely proud that our joint efforts have led to the successful re-entry of the UK as a full member of the ECA. ECA chairman Per Jaldung</p>
<p>He assured that UK operators have plenty to offer when it comes to the broader European network of operators and establishments. Hippodrome Casino chief executive Simon Thomas welcomed the opportunity for the companies to be once again members of the ECA. Thomas worked closely with ECA’s Board in order to make this a reality.</p>
<p>All eight casinos are returning through the strong advocacy of Thomas who is committed to realizing the long-term potential of the industry as part of the European brick-and-mortar family. Thomas assured that casinos in the United Kingdom stand to benefit through this partnership as they will b able to capitalize on the knowledge base that is shared across the European brick-and-mortar sector through ECA.</p>
<p>Steering the Pandemic and Teaching Europe Lessons</p>
<p>The brick-and-mortar sector in the United Kingdom is about to face serious challenges ahead. The sector is likely to come under heavier regulation under an expected Gambling Act 2005 Review which has been postponed numerous times but is most likely going to take place in the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>The brick-and-mortar sector was hit by the pandemic and Brexit both, but the UK’s track record in running physical casinos has proven enough to steer through the crisis. Casinos remained fairly profitable, and they have been able to absorb the shocks well enough so far. The lessons learned in the UK could serve as the basis of a more resilient European brick-and-mortar network of operators as well.</p>
