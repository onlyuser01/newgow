    <h1>Black Bear Casino Resort Carlton Mn Hollywood Casino Dayton Ohio Belterra Casino And Resort Double D</h1>

<p>The casino will tell you what they will tell you. They will tell you that they want me to send them the transaction that the bank did with the return of the money to them, which the bank branch located in my area cannot give me for quite simply they didn't do it, they did it from the transaction security department located in Athens which I can't access and from what I was told at the bank neither did they. And they want this paper they say to find the money they told me. Who are they kidding me you say? As I sent them my account statements and they saw that I have never received the money, let them also see the casino account statement and they will see the money that was returned to them by the bank just fine .Exactly what I'm sending you now they will tell you, I know because that's all they tell me. If you don't bring this paper they told me keep emailing us so we just don't care. worst casino thieves</p>
