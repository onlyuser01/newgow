<p>The 56the edition of the 2021 CONCACAF Champions League comes to an end on Thursday with the final match in which Monterrey and Club America battle for the trophy. Who will become the new champion of the Americas?</p>
<p>Bookmakers think it’s going to be a very, very close game. No surprise there, as the two Mexican sides have been really great in this competition in recent times. Monterrey won the CONCACAF Champions League four times in the 2010s; Club America did it on two occasions.</p>

<p>Poor Form Causing Concern to Monterrey Fans</p>
<p>Monterrey has been on a very poor run, with four straight losses. The team is without a single goal scored in the past three games.</p>
<p>All of those games were played as a part of Liga MX, the Mexican top flight. As a result, Monterrey is somewhere in the middle of the table 15 rounds into the new season. They are 14 points behind the table leader, Club America.</p>
<p>Knowing all that, it’s not crazy to assume that the race for the Mexican title is already lost for Monterrey. However, this team still has a decent chance to add one trophy to the collection. The trophy in question is the one awarded to the winner of the CONCACAF Champions League, a competition this team seems to love.</p>
<p>Monterrey won the CONCACAF Champions League more than any other team in the past decade. Plus, they’ve been pretty dominant in the 2021 campaign, with five wins and just one draw. The most recent game they played was against Cruz Azul in the semi-final.</p>
<p>The score was 4-1 for Monterrey, with Argentine playmaker Maximiliano Meza absolutely dominating the game. Monterrey’s #11 scored one goal, while also making two assists. He is the man Club America need to stop if they want to get anything out of the game on Thursday.</p>
<p>Club America’s Defense Looks Unbreakable</p>
<p>Club America has been playing amazing soccer lately, with no losses in competitive games in more than a month. It’s mostly thanks to their defense, which has been doing a really good job over the last couple of weeks. In the previous seven games, Club America conceded only three goals.</p>
<p>Further, this team has allowed only eight goals in the 15 games of the Mexican top league. In comparison, Monterrey already has 15 goals against them. When it comes to Club America’s performances in the CONCACAF Champions League, they’ve conceded four goals in six games.</p>
<p>There’s one thing that has to worry them ahead of the CONCACAF Champions League Final. It’s the fact that their record against Monterrey is not very good. In fact, Club America lost each of their previous three meetings.</p>
<p>Is the fourth straight loss on the way? It does seem like it, although we’ll probably see a real battle on the pitch. That said, a 1-0 win for Monterrey looks like the most likely outcome.</p>
<p>Pick: Monterrey to win; under 2.5 goals should hit</p>
