    <h1>Quick Hit Casino Free Coins Royal River Casino Hotel Golden Nugget Casino Best Casino In St Louis Ca</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Yesterday, 28th July, I made my first deposit (80 PLN) with 100% welcome bonus on fezbet casino.</p>
<p>Luckily, I won 1250 PLN. I asked casino support if everything is okay and I can withdraw the money and the answer was YES (so I requested a withdrawal).</p>
<p>Today I tried to log to my account but it is blocked.</p>
<p>I wrote an email to fezbet. I received answer that my account is blocked and my winnings are cancelled (they offered me 80 PLN deposit back...)</p>
<p>They told me that :</p>
<p>"According to our Welcome bonus rules (11.1) all your winnings have been canceled:</p>
<p>11.1. Delaying any game round in any game, including free spins features and bonus features, to a later time when you have no more wagering requirement is prohibited. If fraud, manipulation or violation of the Terms and Conditions is detected, the Administration has a right to cancel all winnings and bonuses on a game account."</p>
<p>That is no true because:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Funds from the winning round was taken from the real balance,not the bonus one (bet on Rise of Merlin was made before reaching 80 PLN balance - I made 80 PLN deposit so the first 80 PLN was the real one, not the bonus one)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The first deposit bonus was still active while the withdrawal request was made - so the wagering requirements were still active (but the winnings were not the wagerable one and were instantly added to the real balance!!!!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I even asked support if the money is withdrawable and if everything is good and the answer was YES.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I think I have been scammed.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Szymon</p>
