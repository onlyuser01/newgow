    <h1>Agua Caliente Casino Hotel Caesars Southern Indiana Casino Center Drive Southeast Elizabeth In Blue</h1>

<p>Hello and welcome back!</p>
<p>It has been quite some time, and I'm happy to see you around again although under such circumstances.</p>
<p>I remember those cases and I would like to point out that things were presented differently back then:</p>
<p>Quoting from the complaint:</p>
<p>"Dear Abdulrahaman,</p>
<p>we've noticed that another person has used exactly the same email address as you to register their account at 1win. This is their complaint on our website: https://casino.guru/1win-casino-player-s-concerned-about-account-verification. They also provided us with information received from the licensing authority, that their account was tagged to your account. Unfortunately, this forces us to reject your complaint since creating multiple accounts is a breach of the terms.</p>
<p>Please, keep in touch with the licensing authority, I hope that they will be able to provide you with more clarification regarding your issue.</p>
<p>I'm sorry we couldn't help you with this case."</p>
<p>Though I'm not sure what took you so long to come back here with your statement, it's good you made it.</p>
<p>So, how would you like to "confirm your genuineness aswell" Is this your primary concern?</p>
<p>Do you have new, undisclosed clues to your case, perhaps? Because if you do, you should preset those and ask your complaint to be reopened.</p>
<p>As goes for Hafsat, her complaint was also closed as unjustified. I'd say it makes it pretty clear we were fair and also we have never been in any relation with the refunds or payouts made by the casino in the past. üôè</p>
<p>I'm sorry.</p>
<p>Feel free to share more details.</p>
