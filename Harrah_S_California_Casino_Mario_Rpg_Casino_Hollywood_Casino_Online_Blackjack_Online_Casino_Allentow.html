<p>Liverpool Dreaming Big</p>
<p>Liverpool continues its quest for the quadruple. As a reminder, this team has already won the EFL Cup this year and is still in the competition for three more titles – the Premier League, FA Cup, and Champions League.</p>
<p>After beating Manchester City in the FA Cup semifinal last Saturday, the Merseyside Reds are now one step closer to winning that competition. They’ve also set their eyes on the Champions League, where they play against Villarreal in the semifinal.</p>
<p>What about the Premier League? Liverpool is currently second with just one point fewer than Manchester City. With just seven matches left to play, the Reds need to win as many points as possible.</p>
<p>The good news is that, excluding the Manchester United game, they have a seemingly easy schedule in the Prem. That said, beating the Red Devils would mean making a serious claim on the EPL title.</p>
<p>They do have the motivation but do Jurgen Klopp’s boys have the quality to beat Manchester United? They sure do, evidence beating that they won three of their previous four EPL duels. In fact, the last time these two met, Liverpool beat Manchester United 5-0. Can something similar happen on Tuesday as well?</p>
<p>Struggling Man Utd Hoping for a Top 4 Finish</p>
<p>Manchester United is sitting in the #5 position in the Premier League but the goal of the Red Devils is to finish at least one spot higher. The reason is that it would grant them a direct entry to the group stage of the Champions League.</p>
<p>Although they’re just three points behind the EPL no.4 Tottenham, the Red Devils probably don’t feel too optimistic about their chances. The reason is that this team hasn’t been playing great soccer lately.</p>
<p>Manchester United is 2-1-2 in the Prem in the past five rounds, which is far from great. They did win against Tottenham, with Cristiano Ronaldo scoring a hat-trick. He did the same against Norwich last weekend, helping his team get a much-needed win.</p>
