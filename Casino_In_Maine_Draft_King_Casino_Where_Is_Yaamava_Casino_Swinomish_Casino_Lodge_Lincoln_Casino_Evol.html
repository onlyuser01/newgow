<p>Golden Nugget, the casino company that pioneered in New Jersey the category Live Dealer games has been broadcasting from its own Live Studio in Atlantic City since 2016, in partnership with Ezugi, a supplier the casino operator acquired 2 years later.

<p>Players will get the new games as part of an extended Golden Nugget live games offering, alongside its Live Roulette, Blackjack and Unlimited Blackjack, Baccarat, as well as Casino Hold’em and Three Card Poker, all powered by Ezugi. The agreement allows for further expansion in other US states of Evolution’s games, besides the enhancement of existing New Jersey Golden Nugget online portfolio, as both parties stated that they will together explore opportunities where online gaming legislation is introduced.</p>
<p>“We are honoured to be working in partnership with Golden Nugget in what we believe is a key agreement that paves the way for further exciting growth in the US Live Casino market.
