<p>McIlroy entered the staggered final event of the FedEx Cup Playoffs at -5, five shots behind points leader Justin Thomas. But following four stellar rounds of 66-67-68-66, the Irishman was three clear of his nearest competitor to put his name on the Cup trophy for a second time.</p>
<p>Really cool to put my name on this trophy for a second time,” McIlroy said. “Any time you can do something that only Tiger [Woods] has done, you’re doing something right.”</p>
<p>For the victory, McIlroy won $15 million. It came a year after McIlroy watched Woods win the Tour Championship in a Sunday spectacle with enormous crowds.</p>
<p>Bettors who put $100 on McIlroy winning in Atlanta prior to Thursday’s first round were rewarded $800. That line was actually longer than it was before the first of the three FedEx Cup tournaments. McIlroy began at the Northern Trust at 13/2 to win the Cup.</p>
<p>Lightning Strikes</p>
<p>The Tour Championship made non-golf headlines after six people were injured by a lightning strike during a Saturday afternoon storm.</p>
<p>A 60-foot pine tree was struck by a bolt, which showered debris below and hurt the six individuals. Play had been suspended for 30 minutes prior, with the patrons seeking shelter from the rain underneath the towering pine.</p>
<p>“There was just a big explosion and then an aftershock so strong you could feel the wind from it,” Brad Uhl, a patron, told reporters. “It was just a flash out of the corner of the eye. It was raining and everyone was huddled near the tree.”</p>
<p>Atlanta Police said five men and one woman were injured, but none of their injuries were life-threatening.</p>
<p>PGA Tour spokesperson Mark Russell said when play is suspended, “We encourage everybody to leave and take shelter anywhere they can. We opened up hospitality areas that are grounded, a lot of other places like that. You’ve got a lot of people, and you have to do that quickly, and sometimes people don’t take shelter.”</p>
<p>The odds of being struck by lightning – the six injured weren’t actually hit – are incredibly long.</p>
<p>The National Weather Service says you have a 1/15,300 chance of being struck in your lifetime. Lightning accounts for an average of 27 deaths per year, and 243 injuries.</p>
<p>Looking Ahead</p>
<p>The PGA Tour season is off for a couple weeks before the wraparound schedule tees up the 2019-20 season in September at The Greenbrier. The game’s best players, however, will play a limited schedule over the next few months leading up to the Presidents Cup.</p>
<p>Las Vegas oddsmakers are looking ahead to the 2020 Masters. World No. 1 Brooks Koepka is the odds-on favorite at 8/1. McIlroy is second at 10/1, and Woods and Dustin Johnson next at 16/1. Jordan Spieth, Justin Thomas, Jon Rahm, Justin Rose, and Patrick Cantlay round out the favorites at 20/1.</p>
