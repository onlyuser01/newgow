<p>On November 6th, I put 600$ in the blaze, bonus 100% multiplied to 1200, playing I lost 600, I was left with 600, with those 600 that I had I needed to make a 21,000 rollover to withdraw, I made 40,000 with the 600, so my balance went to 40k I went to Blaze's chat and asked if I would ask for a withdrawal if it was real money. The attendant said I could withdraw normally, because it was a real balance. my money and asked me to confirm my endentidaee first to drop the money, I took it and sent all the documents 24hrs passed the documents were approved and I got in touch with the chat again and asked if everything was ok if I could withdraw my money normally the same said yes, I made the normal withdrawal, 24 hours after the withdrawal an email arrived saying that my withdrawal had not been completed. to the transfers and there was nothing there, I saw that my money had not been refunded I contacted blaze he said that this was their mistake that the money would arrive in my account I said ok, about 15 minutes passed I went to enter again , when logging in, I couldn't get in until today and they send me several promotional emails so it's because the account is still active but for me it's blocked and I can't log in and they didn't make my payment.........
