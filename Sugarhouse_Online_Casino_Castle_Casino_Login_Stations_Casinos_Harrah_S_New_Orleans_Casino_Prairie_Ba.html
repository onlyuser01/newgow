<p>The only notable change, the Spelinspektionen said, is that Per Håkansson will now chair the regulator’s board</p>
<p>The Swedish gambling regulator, the Spelinspektionen, announced that its board will continue to be comprised of seven members. The authority’s decision was greenlit by the current government, led by the Centre-Right Alliance coalition.</p>
<p>The Spelinspektionen provided a peek into its new board, showing that it will remain more or less the same as it has been until now. As announced by the regulator, from April 1, 2023, to March 31, 2024, its board will encompass the following members:</p>
<p>• Per Håkansson – senior advisor</p>
<p>• Håkan Wall – psychologist</p>
<p>• Madelaine Tunudd – councilor</p>
<p>• Andreas Prochazka – lawyer</p>
<p>• Fredrik Holmberg – advisor</p>
<p>• Doris Högne Rydheim – advisor and ex-chancellor</p>
<p>• Camilla Rosenberg – general director of the Swedish Gaming Authority</p>
<p>Wall will continue serving as the board’s lead psychologist. Meanwhile, Tunudd will be the Spelinspektionen’s councilor. Prochazka will continue serving as the authority’s lawyer, while Holmberg and Rydheim help the regulator as advisors.</p>
<p>The Spelinspektionen also noted that Håkansson will be chairing the board. This is notably the only change to the regulator’s board.</p>
<p>The authority also noted that Rosenberg will maintain her seat and will continue to lead the body for another year. She has headed the Spelinspektionen since 2017 when gambling was still illegal and the regulatory body was known as Lotteriinspektionen.</p>
<p>The seven members will report to Niklas Wykman, Sweden’s minister of financial markets.</p>
<p>The Legal Swedish Market Grows</p>
<p>Sweden continues to be an attractive market for gambling providers. A few days ago, two new B2B companies secured licenses in the Nordic country. First, Relax Gaming secured a business-to-business license, making a foray into the Northern country. As a result, the company can now legally offer its products in the local market.</p>
<p>A few days later, Play’n GO managed to successfully renew its supplier license in the country. The company has been operating in the local market for a while and will be able to continue doing business there. This was furthermore a very important development for Play’n GO, which was originally founded in Sweden.</p>
<p>Last year, the Spelinspektionen announced that only a few gamblers prefer to play with offshore companies. According to a study, only 8% of Swedes pick unlicensed companies. Six percent, the Spelinspektionen said, did so voluntarily while two percent failed to identify an illegal operator as such. Meanwhile, 55% of respondents said that they would always prefer playing with legal companies because of the safer gambling tools they provide to players.</p>
