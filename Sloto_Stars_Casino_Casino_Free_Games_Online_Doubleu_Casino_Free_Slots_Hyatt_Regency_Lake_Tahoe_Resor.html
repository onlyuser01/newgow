<p>Jdigital and Spanish problem-gambling therapist Fejar have teamed up to launch a freephone gambling support helpline.</p>
<p>24/7 Freephone Helpline Available to Problem Gamblers Throughout the Year</p>
<p>Spain’s digital gambling association Jdigital and the Spanish Federation of Rehabilitated Gamblers (Fejar) have signed a collaborative agreement to help problem gamblers. The project will see the association’s members activate a free phone number for assistance and therapy on their platforms, managed by Fejar.</p>
<p>Within the first phase of the agreement, eight members of Jdigital will incorporate the freephone gambling support line on their websites. The phone number must be put on a clearly visible place on their websites. The first operators to join the initiative are Codere, Ebingo, Entain, Flutter Entertainment, Sisal, Sportium, Wanabet and Winamax.</p>
<p>The agreement was signed on the International Responsible Gambling Day (20 February). It is an example of the efforts and coordination between two of the most relevant organizations in the gaming industry to prevent risky behavior, Jdigital said in a press release.</p>
<p>“We are pleased to have signed this agreement with Jdigital and some of the main online gambling companies in the country, because it highlights the importance of joining efforts on the fight against problematic gambling, a task that has been Fejar’s main goal since its foundation in 1991.” Maxi Gutiérrez, president of Fejar</p>
<p>The service will provide first point of contact and support for callers on behalf of trained specialists in the treatment of gambling disorders. The specialists will either give information or will refer callers to the nearest association to evaluate their behaviour or receive specific treatment.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Fejar will prepare semi-annual reports that will provide information about the number of calls answered through the helpline. The document will also analyze any relevant information that allows studying player behavior in order to prevent and reduce gambling-related harm.</p>
<p>Jdigital’s Criticism Towards Gambling Restrictions</p>
<p>Fejar’s new helpline is in line with the safer gambling requirements enforced by the Royal Decree on Responsible Gambling. The decree says that licensed operators must offer ‘direct links to information services on safer gambling’.</p>
<p>Jdigital has often criticized the Spanish government for applying disproportionate gambling restrictions. The organization insists that the limits are not supported by empirical data and only work in favor of the unlicensed gambling market.</p>
<p>Recently, Spain’s gambling regulator itself said the official data shows that gambling behavior does not represent a public health problem in Spain. The statement provoked further disapproval on behalf of Jdigital. The association said the statement was proof of the conscious arbitrariness and disproportionality behind the Royal Decree.</p>
