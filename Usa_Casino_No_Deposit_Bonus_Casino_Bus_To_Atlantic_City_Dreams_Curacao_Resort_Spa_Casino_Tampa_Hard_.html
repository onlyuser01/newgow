<p>Following the departure of Hofbauer, Erik Strand, Svenska Spel’s board chair, will serve as interim CEO until Johnson takes office</p>
<p>Svenska Spel, a Swedish state-owned gambling operator, has named Anna Johnson as the successor of its current chief executive officer, Patrik Hofbauer. The latter announced his exit earlier this year, opting to explore other opportunities instead.</p>
<p>Johnson will serve as Svenska Spel’s new president and CEO and is set to step into the office by June 2024, the former Swedish monopoly announced.</p>
<p>According to Svenska Spel, its new CEO boasts a master’s degree in economics from Mitthögskolan in Östersund. She is also an authorized accountant with an impressive track record behind her back.</p>
<p>Aged 50, Johnson currently serves as a partner and CEO of Grant Thornton, a global accounting and consulting firm. She boasts decades of experience in accounting and has held a number of leading corporate positions at Grant Thornton. She was appointed as the agency’s CEO seven years ago and has leveraged her experience to bolster the firm.</p>
<p>Hofbauer, meanwhile, is set to leave Svenska Spel very soon. Starting on February 1, 2024, the incumbent CEO will join the Swedish telecommunications juggernaut Telia Company. Following the departure of Hofbauer, Erik Strand, Svenska Spel’s board chair, will serve as interim CEO until Johnson takes office.</p>
<p>Johnson Is Honored to Have Svenska Spel’s Trust</p>
<p>Strand commented on the new appointment, praising Johnson’s track record of successful leadership positions. He lauded her ability to build strong teams, create more customer value and deliver profitable growth. According to the chairman, Johnson’s drive and curiosity made her a perfect fit for Svenska Spel.</p>
<p>The board and I are very much looking forward to working together with Anna and her management team. Erik Strand, chairman, Svenska Spel</p>
<p>Strand added that Sweden’s former gambling monopoly has implemented many changes in recent years. He believes that the company is now poised to offer engaging and safe gaming experiences to its customers in the country.</p>
<p>Johnson also commented on his new position, saying that it represents a “fantastic opportunity.” The new CEO added that she is honored to have the trust of one of Sweden’s strongest gambling brands. She also praised the company’s commitment to sustainable entertainment, saying that this philosophy provides benefits both to the Swedish people and Swedish sports.</p>
<p>I am really looking forward to leading Svenska Spel’s journey of change together with the employees and continuing to create results. Anna Johnson, CEO appointee, Svenska Spel</p>
<p>Speaking of Sweden, BOS’ general secretary, Gustaf Hoffstedt, just weighed on the country’s newly-proposed gambling tax, saying that it would be a “gift to the black market.”</p>
