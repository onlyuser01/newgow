<p>After spending nearly three decades with Betfred, Stebbings announced his plans to step down from his group chief operating officer role</p>
<p>The leading gaming and sports betting company that has a rich history of more than 50 years and operates more than 1,350 betting shops, Betfred, would soon have to start looking for a new group chief operating officer (COO), after Mark Stebbings, who currently holds the role, announced his plans to leave the company.</p>
<p>The announcement came on Sunday via a post released on LinkedIn by Stebbings, who confirmed that his last day with the company will be Friday, September 29, 2023. So far Betfred is yet to announce if it has already selected a person to fill in the role after Stebbings’ departure.</p>
<p>The outgoing COO has been a part of the company for nearly three decades. Throughout his extensive career, Stebbings raised through the ranks from a trainee betting shop manager to his most recent role. In his recent post, he thanked Betfred’s founder, Fred Done, for his relentless efforts and guidance. According to Stebbings, Done’s supervision and faith helped him grow to the position of group COO.</p>
<p>“After nearly 30 years I have decided that it is the right time for me to leave Betfred, I am immensely proud to have been part of an incredible growth story. I must give special thanks to Fred Done who has been an unbelievable mentor to me and for the belief and faith he put in me as I made my way through the ranks from a trainee betting shop manager to group chief operating officer,“ reads a statement released by Mark Stebbings</p>
<p>Outgoing COO Was Delighted to Collaborate with Experts at Betfred</p>
<p>Betfred’s outgoing group COO revealed that it was exciting to work with “so many great people” over the last decades. Stebbings wished the company’s teams and founder success and predicted that Betfred would continue growing. He explained that he plans to have a break and enjoy time with his family before engaging in a new endeavor.</p>
<p>“I am looking forward to taking a short break spending some quality time with my family before I decide what the future has in store for me,“ added Stebbings</p>
<p>The announced upcoming departure comes after earlier this month, Betfred confirmed a new senior-level appointment. At the time, the company revealed it selected Kresimir Spajic for the role of CEO of Betfred USA. With the strategic appointment, Betfred anticipates further expansion across the United States. Upon announcing the senior-level appointment, Joanne Whittaker, Betfred Group’s chief executive, welcomed Spajic to the company’s C-suite and explained that he is the right person for the role.</p>
