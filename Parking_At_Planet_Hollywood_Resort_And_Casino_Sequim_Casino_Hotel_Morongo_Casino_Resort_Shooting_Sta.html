<p>The Pittsburgh Steelers vs. Cincinnati Bengals is a Week 12 game of the 2023 NFL, which is on the program on Sunday, November 26, at Paycor Stadium in Cincinnati, Ohio</p>
<p>In the 2023 NFL Week 12, the Cincinnati Bengals (5-5) welcome their AFC North rivals the Pittsburgh Steelers (6-4) at Paycor Stadium. These two are in the bottom half of the division, with the Cleveland Cavaliers having a 7-3 record and the Baltimore Ravens sitting at the top of the AFC North standings with an 8-3 record.</p>
<p>The game on Sunday is, therefore, crucial for both the Bengals and the Steelers in their effort to make the playoffs. But both teams are having some serious problems right now. Cincinnati’s superstar quarterback Joe Burrow is out for the season with a wrist injury.</p>
<p>When it comes to the Steelers, they also have some problems with their offensive team. They just haven’t been scoring much, which is why they decided to fire offensive coordinator Matt Canada on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Pittsburgh Steelers Need to Up Their Offensive Game</p>
<p>The Steelers are awesome when it comes to defense, conceding just 16.6 points per game. This makes their defense seventh in the league.</p>
<p>As if that wasn’t enough, Pittsburgh’s defensive players have also scored two touchdowns this season. Both of those happened in the first game against their AFC North rivals, the Steelers, with linebackers Alex Highsmith and T.J. Watt being the ones to take the ball over the TD line.</p>
<p>Overall, the Steelers have scored 166 points this season. However, when you take out the 14 points (2 TDs + 2 field goals) that came as a result of their defensive team’s work, you get to a very disappointing number.</p>
<p>Tomlin says he fired Matt Canada. You buying it? pic.twitter.com/QXnRd8y36D — Andrew Fillipponi (@ThePoniExpress) November 21, 2023</p>
<p>This explains why head coach Mike Tomlin decided to fire the offensive coordinator Matt Canada just a couple of days before the Steelers vs. Bengals game. The news came as a big surprise to everyone, including quarterback Kenny Pickett who learned about this on social media.</p>
<p>The Steelers’ offensive coordinator in the game with the Bengals on November 26 will be running back coach Eddie Faulkner, while the role of calling the plays is given to QB coach Mike Sullivan.</p>
<p>Can the Cincinnati Bengals Cope Without Burrow</p>
<p>The Bengals are 5-5 in the 2023 NFL, which is bad on its own, but they’ve also lost their last two games. The worst thing is that one of Cincinnati’s opponents in those two matchups was its AFC North rival Baltimore.</p>
<p>The result is that the Bengals are now two wins behind the Ravens, so finishing the regular season at the top of the divisional standings doesn’t seem very likely. In fact, there’s a big question mark over whether they can book a wild card ticket to the postseason.</p>
<p>They’re 5-5 at the moment, which isn’t too bad, but the trouble is that they’ve got some really hard games coming their way in the remainder of the season. They’ve got to play against the Steelers twice, as well as against the Jaguars, Browns, and Chiefs.</p>
<p>All this wouldn’t be too much of a problem if the highest-paid player in the NFL was fit. But quarterback Joe Burrow suffered a season-ending wrist injury last week. As a result, backup QB Jake Browning will take his place.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh Steelers vs. Cincinnati Bengals Prediction</p>
<p>There’s no way the Steelers’ offense can produce much in Week 12. In fact, our prediction is that the Bengals are going to keep them to around 20 points. But can Jake Browning &amp; Co. score 20+ points against one of the best defenses in the 2023 NFL?</p>
<p>Pittsburgh’s defensive team is amazing, so they should have no problems stopping Browning, who’s making his first-ever start in the NFL on November 26.</p>
<p>Picks: Pittsburgh Steelers -1.0 (-130) &amp; under 35.5 points (-110)</p>
