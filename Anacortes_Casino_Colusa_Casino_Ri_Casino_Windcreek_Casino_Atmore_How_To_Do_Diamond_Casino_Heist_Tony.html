    <h1>Anacortes Casino Colusa Casino Ri Casino Windcreek Casino Atmore How To Do Diamond Casino Heist Tony</h1>

<p>They cancelled a withdrawal of $302.08 without notifying me. At the time it was cancelled, I was active in a game and the funds were added when I got my next win. I continued to play using what I thought were "winnings". Upon checking my transaction status, I saw that my withdrawal was cancelled. I checked my emails to see if they notified me. They did not. When I asked online chat about it, they did not provide me with a reason for the failure or why they didn’t communicate with me. And was told basically "failures happen, and you won’t get your money back."</p>
<p>I asked many times why it failed and why I was not given any communication. Each time I was stonewalled and not given an answer. Below is the transcript- I have removed my personal details.</p>
