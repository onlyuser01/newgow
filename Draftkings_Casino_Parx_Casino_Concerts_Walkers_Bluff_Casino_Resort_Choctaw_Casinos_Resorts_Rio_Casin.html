<p>Chris Matthews, chief executive officer of UK bingo operator Buzz Bingo, announced he would be stepping down from the position at the end of the year.</p>
<p>Really Difficult Decision</p>
<p>Matthews made the announcement that he would be handing over the reins of Buzz Bingo to a new CEO via his LinkedIn profile, stating that making that decision was extremely difficult for him, having spent over 5 years at the helm of the Nottingham-based bingo operator.</p>
<p>“Quite simply, it’s been the most incredible of journeys,” he stated, outlining key business developments such as the rebranding to Buzz Bingo, the launch of Buzzbingo.com, navigating the shutdown during the pandemic, and the subsequent re-launch of operations.</p>
<p>Matthews joined Buzz Bingo in September 2017 having spent over four years as CEO of GO Outdoors. From June 2019, he also serves as Chairman of The Bingo Association and Chairman of the National Bingo Game Association, a role he held until March 2021.</p>
<p>Further commenting on his experience with Buzz Bingo, Matthews paid tribute to the hugely talented individuals he had a chance to work with during his years, feeling that “the biggest privilege of all though has been the opportunity to serve as their chief executive.”</p>
<p>Welcoming His Successor</p>
<p>He then turned to his successor as Buzz Bingo CEO, Dominic Mansour, wishing him “the very best of luck in his new role,” convinced that “he is the right person to be picking up the baton.”</p>
<p>Following Matthews’ decision to step down from the role, Buzz Bingo chose current chief operating officer Mansour to replace Matthews and take the wheel of the business.</p>
<p>Mansour returned the compliments, outlining what “an absolute pleasure to work alongside” Matthews has been since the moment he joined the company in January 2021, paying tribute to what he has learnt from Matthews “as to what it takes to grow and protect” the brand.</p>
<p>Finally, Mansour assured everyone that “the business is in good shape for the future” and he is excited to take the reins and work “alongside the very talented management team and … and hard-working and committed colleagues.”</p>
<p>On behalf of Buzz Bingo, Chairman John Kelly OBE outlined Matthews’ contributions helped the brand navigate “a change of ownership, two ears of pandemic disruption, and a reorganization of the company’s property portfolio.”</p>
<p>“Under his excellent stewardship, the Buzz brand was born, as was buzzbingo.com, both of which have grown from strength to strength,” he added, thanking Matthews for his leadership and wishing him “the best of good fortune for the future.”</p>
