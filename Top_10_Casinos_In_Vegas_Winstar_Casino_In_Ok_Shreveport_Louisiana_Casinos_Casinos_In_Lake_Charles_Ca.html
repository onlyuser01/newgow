<p>Encore Boston Harbor Dominating Massachusetts Gaming Industry, MGM Springfield $144M Short of Expectations</p>

<p>Encore Boston Harbor has taken a commanding lead in the Massachusetts three-casino gaming industry, as the $2.6 billion integrated resort controlled more than 60 percent of the market in August.</p>

<p>Figures from the Massachusetts Gaming Commission reveal the Wynn Resorts casino reported gross gaming revenue (GGR) of more than $52.48 million last month. The gaming regulator said, along with the two other casinos – MGM Springfield and the slots-only Plainridge Park – statewide GGR came in at $86 million.</p>
<p>Encore Boston Harbor’s August win represents an eight percent gain on July, which was the casino’s first full month in operation following its June 23 opening.</p>
<p>MGM Springfield reported gaming revenue of $20.96 million – a three percent premium on July. September will mark the $960 million property’s first year-over-year comparable, as the casino opened its doors on August 23, 2018.</p>
<p>Plainridge Park August slot win was just $12 million, a three percent loss from July and a 21 percent decline compared to August 2018. Coin-in, as well as hold, were both down considerably.</p>
<p>MGM Struggles</p>
<p>There are two ways to look at MGM Springfield’s August casino win.</p>
<p>The pessimist will say it was the venue’s third-worst operating month in its 12-month history. The optimist will highlight a bounce back, as June and July were respectively the casino’s No. 2 and No. 1 worst months in business.</p>
<p>Regardless of one’s outlook on the future for the MGM Resorts casino, the financial filings show the property is failing to live up to pre-market expectations.</p>
<p>During the casino operator’s bidding for the license, MGM told state regulators its casino in Springfield would report GGR of $418 million in its first year. With just 22 days remaining before it hits 365 days in operation, MGM Springfield has won $273.78 million – more than $144.2 million short of its forecast.</p>
<p>During the resort’s one-year anniversary celebration, MGM brass rolled out a new social casino space that aims to attract younger gamblers. A total of 24 positions allow gamblers to play blackjack, roulette, and two variations of baccarat simultaneously, with live dealers facilitating the games.</p>
<p>“Anything you can do from a live table you can do here,” MGM Springfield VP of Gaming Operations Robert Westerfield explained. “You get more action in.”</p>
<p>Encore Playing Catchup</p>
<p>Wynn Resorts also made some rather lofty first-year GGR projections while trying to woo over the MGC into awarding its company licensure in Massachusetts. The casino company said it would win $800 million on its floor in its first 365 days.</p>
<p>The casino is averaging GGR of $976,064 per day – which puts it on track for $356.26 million. State lawmakers gave a more realistic $500 million in GGR in year one for the Wynn property.</p>
<p>Encore Boston Harbor President Bob DeSalvio said recently that the company is exploring how to improve its slot win. The casino saw coin-in increase from $262.4 million to $359.2 million in July to August. But slot hold fell considerably from eight percent to 5.6 percent.</p>
<p>We’re actually adding a few more tables on the casino floor as we speak, but I will tell you the slots business has been soft,” DeSalvio told the MGC.</p>
<p>GGR on tables increased from $27.4 million to $32.2 million during the two months.</p>
