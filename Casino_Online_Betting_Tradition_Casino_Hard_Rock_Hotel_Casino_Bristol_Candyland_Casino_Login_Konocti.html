<p>There often comes a time when you find a casino that is just right. With almost 20 years on the market, BetOnline Casino may just be the one, courtesy of a vast selection of 300+ games, a great start-up bonus, two live dealer sections, and many banking options. Yet, you still may wonder why is BetOnline any worthier than any other brand? We have you covered with this BetOnline Casino review.</p>
<p>Established in 2001, the online casino has been very quick to move onto different verticals, but iGaming has remained one of its bastions. Today, BetOnline has a lot to offer. You will be welcome with a $3,000 sign-up bonus and enjoy flexible banking options that include Visa, MasterCard, Bitcoin, Litecoin, and others. BetOnline even has added a sportsbook and racebook, and a special section dedicated to esports. However, today we will only focus on the casino product.</p>
<p>BetOnline.ag Casino Platform: Pros and Cons</p>
<p>It is quite natural that casinos will have their strong and weak points. In our BetOnline Casino review, we were able to find more strengths than weaknesses, though, and here is what we found.</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<p>A large selection of contests, promotions, and bonuses</p>
<p>Weekly and monthly reloads and rebate bonuses</p>
<p>Decent selection of banking options including Bitcoin</p>
<p>Available on multiple platforms and operating systems</p>
<p>Offers two separate live casino studios with flexible betting limits</p>
<p>Cons:</p>
<p>Could allow better withdrawal limits per transactions</p>
<p>Doesn’t mention maximum monthly cash out in T&amp;C’s</p>
<p>BetOnline Casino Welcome Bonus</p>
<p>From all the casinos you can pick from, BetOnline Casino has one of the largest selections of promotional offers. To avoid confusing you, though, we will start at the top, and explain how the BetOnline Casino welcome bonus works. The promotion is a $3,000 sign-up bonus spread across three separate deposits. Each deposit will be matched at 100% for a total of $1,000 activated with the BOLCASINO promo code.</p>
<p>You can claim a total of $3,000 in additional bonus funds to top off your own bankroll, which will stand at $6,000 assuming you deposit the full amount. To qualify for the welcome bonus, all you need to do is use the bonus code and deposit at least $25. Once you have the funds credited to your account, it’s time to take a look at the wagering requirements.</p>
<p>You will have 30 days to rollover the deposit and bonus amount 30x times. Keep in mind that the bonus only applies to the bonus section. Almost every game in the casino will count towards the wagering requirement, but some are better picks than others. For example, all slots, except for the progressive jackpots, will attribute 100% to your playthrough requirement.</p>
<p>Other Casino Promotions by BetOnline</p>
<p>BetOnline has an impressive portfolio of bonuses that covers every section of the website. Yet, it is the casino selection of bonuses we will pay particular attention to today.

The bonus applies to all games but the live dealer studios, but it’s still a great offer to have. Just play from Monday through Thursday, and should you end up the week down.</p>
