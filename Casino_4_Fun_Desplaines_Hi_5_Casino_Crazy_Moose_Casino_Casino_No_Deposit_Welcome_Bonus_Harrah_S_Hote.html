<p>The leading payments platform, Paysafe, announced Monday it joined forces with the micro-betting app from the American professional boxer and social media star Jake Paul, Betr. The new collaboration further expands Paysafe’s presence in the US, while at the same time, supercharging Betr’s operations in two states.</p>
<p>Per the new agreement, clients of the micro-betting app in Massachusetts and Ohio will benefit from seamless funding of wagers via a debit card. Thanks to the new collaboration, Paysafe’s technology will provide a safe and secure method for depositing via debit cards, improving the experiences for bettors. The two companies confirmed that their partnership is expected to expand to other US states in the near future, further solidifying their positions in the respective verticals.</p>
<p>In addition to Paysafe’s best-in-class payment gateway, Betr will benefit from the payment provider’s extensive range of alternative payment methods (APMs). Such will include eCash features, a digital wallet and other innovative solutions from Paysafe.</p>
<p>Joey Levy, Betr’s CEO and founder, was excited about the new deal and said that the company is delighted to forge an alliance with such a trusted and recognized payment solutions provider. He said that Betr seeks to grow further and upscale its business along with Paysafe. “They are reliable, experienced, and share our perspective that we are just scratching the surface of product innovation in the regulated real-money gaming industry,” said Levy in conclusion.</p>
<p>“We are excited to announce our partnership with Paysafe and are looking forward to working with them as we continue scaling the Betr business.“ Joey Levy, founder and CEO at Betr</p>
<p>Paysafe Continues US-Facing Expansion</p>
<p>Zak Cutler, Paysafe’s president of global gaming, said that the company is proud of this agreement with Betr. He spoke about common goals that the two companies share, including revolutionizing the growing betting industry in the US.</p>
<p>In conclusion, Cutler added: “We look forward to supporting the growth of Betr in Ohio and Massachusetts as well as future states by providing the operator and its customers on-the-go with an unparalleled payment experience that befits the impressive UX of the Betr app.”</p>
<p>Besides improving the experience for Betr’s customers in Ohio and Massachusetts, the collaboration expands Paysafe’s presence in the country. The payment provider already supports other operators in the aforementioned states. In addition to Ohio and Massachusetts, Paysafe has established its presence in more than two dozen US states and jurisdictions.</p>
