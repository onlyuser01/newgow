    <h1>Indian Head Casino Planet 7 Casino Login Niagara Falls Casinos Ruleta Casino Prairies Edge Casino Tu</h1>

<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>and thank you in advance for letting me use your complaint service.</p>
<p>On 13/03/2021 I deposited 50 EUR with Turbico Casino and thereby triggered their 50% deposit bonus as well as 100 Free Spins (20 per day).</p>
<p>You only get those 100 Free Spins if you deposit 50 EUR or more, otherwise you will just receive a 50% deposit bonus.</p>
<p>( https://www.turbico.com/en/offers )</p>
<p>I lost my deposit and the deposit.</p>
<p>Afterwards I used 40 (2x 20) Free Spins originating from my 1st deposit. These were free spins credited on 14/03/2021 and 15/03/2021, respectively. I won 17,30 EUR from these free spins. Turn over is 45x free spins winnings.</p>
<p>I wagered the required amount. When wagering was complete I was on 150+ EUR balance. Then, 103 EUR got deducted from my balance, leaving it at 47,xx EUR.</p>
<p>I contacted Live Chat (Sofia) which was unable to help. She told me that winnings from free spins are always cut short to 50 EUR and that the free spins from the 1st deposit offer are considered "no-deposit free spins" which obviously is wrong as they can only be received by depositing 50 EUR or more.</p>
<p>Quote from Turbicos Terms:</p>
<p>"3. Maximum withdrawal limit for no-deposit free spins is 50 EURO/USD, 500 NOK, 75 CAD, 750 ZAR, 200 PLN, 75 NZD. To submit a withdrawal request, the account must be fully verified and a minimum deposit must be made."</p>
<p>( https://www.turbico.com/en/bonus-terms )</p>
<p>There are no restrictions on free spins originating from a deposit whatsoever. ONLY NO-DEPOSIT free spins are restricted to 50 EUR.</p>
<p>Therefore, I kindly ask Turbico Casino to reinstall my balance of 150+ EUR immediately as according to their Terms and Conditions as well as their Bonus Terms.</p>
<p>P.S. I am a frequent user of other N1-group casinos as well. Never had any trouble whatsoever with them.</p>
