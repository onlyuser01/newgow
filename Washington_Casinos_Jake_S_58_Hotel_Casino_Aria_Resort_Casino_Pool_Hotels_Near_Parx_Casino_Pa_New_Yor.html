<p>Evolution, the world’s foremost content developer and supplier of live casino products, has established a new partnership with Caesars Digital in Pennsylvania. As a result, the supplier’s innovative and player-favorite live casino content will launch with the Tropicana Online Casino and Caesars Sportsbook &amp; Casino in the state.</p>
<p>The partnership also covers Evolution’s slot arms, Red Tiger and NetEnt, which will bring an array of excellent and industry-leading slots that will significantly strengthen the two casino brands’ portfolios and offers over the coming months, bringing players brand-new and fresh experiences to enjoy.</p>
<p>Focusing on the live content offer, the casino is bringing some of its most prominent games broadcast from its state-of-the-art studios, including European and American Roulette, InfiniteBlackjack, Craps, Ultimate Texas Hold’em, Baccarat, and Three Card Poker, among others. Evolution also recently launched LiveCraps in Michigan.</p>
<p>Evolution is happy to also offer local players some of its signature First Person games which are played without a live dealer but are still part of the live casino portfolio and streamed in real-time from a dedicated studio.</p>
<p>The First Person solution is a series of 3D animated Random Number Generator games that are based on the studio’s live casino content and is just as engaging and popular with players.</p>
<p>Commenting on this fresh and significant expansion opportunity, company CCO Jeff Millar said that Evolution was simply delighted to be helping out Caesars Digital with the brand’s content expansion and strategy in the Keystone State.</p>
<p>"We have been working closely with Caesars for some time and we’re proud to be their live casino provider and to ensure they have the best games at their disposal for their players. We look forward to continuing this relationship and to seeing what new exciting developments come out of this latest expansion," Millar added.</p>
<p>Caesars Digital SVP of iGaming Matthew Sunderland was of a similar mind, welcoming the opportunity to add Evolution’s cutting-edge games to its platform and bring more innovative content to players. Sunderland said that he was confident in the success of the live dealer content by Evolution, including the company’s signature First Person offerings, among other brilliant titles, to try.</p>
<p>Evolution recently launched a brand-new live casino experience by the name of Funky Time. The game features a 3D animated mascot and all sorts of ways to win and it’s crafted in Evolution’s distinct and entertaining style.</p>
