    <h1>Sunland Park Racetrack Casino Sunland Park Nm The River Casino Online Casino Games Free Cherokee Cas</h1>

<p>On February 24th, i won $2,600 CAD on the VegasHero Casino site. I even received an email from Dean, the account manager, offering promotional money to increase my earnings – money that I have refused as I never play with Casinos’ money (we all know it is often a trap for them not to pay, saying that we won with their money).</p>
<p>On March 2nd, after several requests of documentation, I have received an email stating that all my file was approved.</p>
<p>All together, in about 2 months we have exchanged no less than 60 emails and despite my repeated requests, I still have not been paid. I have kept all email exchanges with them – not counting the messages that have bounced undelivered.</p>
<p>Most emails, at least 20 came from Dean, the AM, asking me for proofs of revenue, bank statements form the last 3 months, statements from credit cards, if I had inherited any money, etc. After answering all their questions, and depositing documents on their server or forwarding them by mail, I still have received no foreseen date of payment. They say they care about the players playing responsibly. If it is the case, why don’t they do their credit check before we play, not after we have won some money. Hypocrisy – just to avoid pay outs.</p>
<p>My reference with VegasHero: Case # 05593344</p>
<p>I have had enough with this nonsense – I want to be paid.</p>
