<p>The deal with the association will augment the consultancy’s industry-leading compliance-related portfolio</p>
<p>SG:certified, a company that helps operators with their safer gambling and sustainability needs, has announced a new partnership with the Association of Certified Gaming Compliance Specialists (ACGCS). Under the agreement, the association will provide SG:certified’s employees with the training needed to improve its clients’ practices.</p>
<p>ACGCS Will Provide the Consultancy with Training</p>
<p>As agreed, ACGCS’ training courses will be integrated into the sustainability specialist’s platform. Thanks to this, the organization’s experience will reach more operators, ensuring a safer gambling ecosystem.</p>
<p>The agreement also covers ACGCS’ Certified Gaming Compliance Specialist (CGCS) certification. The latter provides casino workers with training and tools across 60 topics, helping them minimize risks and prevent fraud such as money laundering. The deal will reinforce SG:certified’s offer, further bolstering its compliance-related portfolio.</p>
<p>The consultancy fields a team of experienced compliance veterans that are committed to helping gaming companies earn and maintain licenses and certifications. The company’s mission is to make the gambling industry more sustainable by providing a tried and tested platform to operators, regulators and providers.</p>
<p>By accessing SG:certified’s platform, companies within the industry can have their businesses assessed. In addition, the consultancy offers a wealth of resources for training compliance staff.</p>
<p>The Two Parties Share a Vision</p>
<p>The founder of the Association of Certified Gaming Compliance Specialists, Dr Ian Messenger, commented on the agreement, calling it “an ideal partnership” for both organizations. He noted that both parties’ teams are focused on social responsibility and helping others with compliance matters.</p>
<p>I hope that this partnership helps increase discussions around social responsibility and compliance in the industry. Dr Ian Messenger, founder, ACGCS</p>
<p>Svend Aage Kirk, an SG:certified partner who joined the company in November 2022, also shared his thoughts on the occasion. He noted that the ACGCS has made impressive strides with its certification. Kirk believes that the two companies share the same mindset and goals, which is why he is happy about this partnership.</p>
<p>This shared desire to bring a positive impact to the gambling industry made them [ACGCS] the ideal partner. I look forward to seeing what we can achieve together. Svend Aage Kirk, partner, SG:certified</p>
<p>SG:certified believes that sustainability isn’t a destination but a journey. The company’s motto is that there is no need for each company to reinvent the wheel, which is why it helps its partners make their journeys as impactful as possible.</p>
<p>A few days ago, the consultancy welcomed the experienced Maris Catania as its new safer gambling senior consultant. She joined the company with an immediate effect and is already helping to keep SG:certified’s content relevant and effective.</p>
