<p>GAN Procures Needed Refinancing, Slashing Interest Expenses</p>

<p>Gaming technology provider GAN Ltd. (NASDAQ: GAN) landed much-needed refinancing with some creditors — moves that will enable the battered firm to realize significant savings on annual interest expenses.</p>

<p>GAN creditor Beach Point Capital is waiving certain defaults and covenants under its current agreement with the tech company. The lender is replacing an interest coverage ratio with a $10 million liquidity agreement, which will be tested on a quarterly basis.</p>
<p>Sega Sammy Holdings will enter an assignment and acceptance agreement with Beach Point, making it the new creditor on the term loan, in addition to lending to GAN an additional $12m to pay certain fees to Beach Point and for general corporate purposes,” wrote Macquarie analyst Chad Beynon in a note to clients on Thursday.</p>
<p>Beynon also pointed out that Sega Sammy will pare the interest rate on GAN’s term loans to 8% from 14%, creating $2 million in annual savings on interest expenses.</p>
<p>Why it Matters</p>
<p>Formerly GameAccount Network, the company provides software-as-a-service (SaaS) solutions for iGaming and sportsbook operators.</p>
<p>GAN went public in the US nearly three years ago, and while there was initial enthusiasm for the stock, that’s long since evaporated as the shares are down 64.68% over the past year. In early 2021, the stock flirted with $32. Today, it labors around $1.60. Following that run, investors will welcome any good news, and the credit agreements could help.</p>
<p>“More importantly, we view this new agreement positively, as it removes liquidity and covenant concerns, which we believe were an overhang on the stock recently, and potentially indicates a new strategic partner in Sega Sammy going forward,” added Beynon.</p>
<p>Beynon has an “outperform” rating on GAN with a 12-month price target of $5, meaning the shares would need to more than triple from current levels to get there.</p>
<p>GAN Credit Moves Could Help Strategic Review</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Ireland-based GAN announced it is initiating a strategic review “to evaluate options available to hasten our path to better profitability metrics and a more attractive return profile.”</p>
<p>It remains to be seen if that results in asset divestments or an outright sale of the company. Still, GAN’s market capitalization of $73.18 million makes it easily digestible for any number of prospective suitors. Beynon observed the aforementioned refinancing moves could spur the company’s strategic review process, and the stock is deeply discounted.</p>
<p>“Moreover, we view the deal as a key first step towards a potential asset sale. As a reminder, GAN announced the initiation of a strategic review process during 4Q earnings,” concluded the analyst. “At ~$70m market cap, we believe there is value in recent contracts, embedded tech, the B2C business (following recent write-downs) and iGaming exposure. However, ongoing delays/reductions to the company’s revenue and EBITDA goals have caused shares to languish at well under 1x EV/sales.”</p>
