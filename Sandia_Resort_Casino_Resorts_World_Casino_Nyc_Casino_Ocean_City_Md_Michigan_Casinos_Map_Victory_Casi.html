<p>Checkd Group is looking to make amazing progress in the US after it launched its FlashPicks brand and thus, finally marked its debut in a region where sports betting is growing at a rapid rate. So far, 30 US states – and Washington, D.C. – have legalized sports betting and several other states are making efforts to reap all the benefits of this industry, with the most recent push being in South Carolina.</p>
<p>FlashPicks Helps Punters Find Free Picks</p>
<p>FlashPicks is considered a great tool that helps punters find free sports picks. An expert team is constantly looking over the betting lines and is dedicated to providing bettors with the best deals across multiple sports in the US.</p>
<p>The markets that are covered in FlashPicks include the NFL, college basketball, the NBA, college football, and soccer. All of the picks are tailored for the US market and the platform currently features sign-up deals with top-rated operators such as FanDuel Sportsbook, PointsBet, Caesars Sportsbook, and BetMGM. The company has announced more partnerships in the next few months.</p>
<p>This launch comes shortly after Checkd Group received a license from the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement (DGE) and this marks Checkd’s first mission outside of the UK, where its community counts around 2 million members. FlashPicks is live across the US and bettors can utilize the operator links in Indiana, New Jersey, Washington D.C., Iowa, New York, and Wyoming.</p>
<p>Several US States Might Be Provided with the FlashPicks Tool in the Near Future</p>
<p>At the moment, Checkd is working to get affiliate licenses in other US states as it looks to build on vibrant communities. Callum Broxton at Checkd Group stated that the company planned the entrance to the US market for quite a while and is delighted to be able to deliver the FlashPicks tool to US bettors and provide them with the chance to wager through its operator partners.</p>
<p>Broxton also added that many bettors will likely place their first bet and FlashPicks can be the port through which they will receive all the necessary information to get the best possible betting experience.</p>
<p>A Goldman Sachs report predicted that the US online sports betting market has the potential to be worth over $39 billion in annual revenue by 2033. One additional analysis states the online sports betting revenue will reach almost $20 billion by 2025. Checkd is well-aware of this fact which is why it is using all tools to expand its influence and one of those tools is social media.</p>
<p>In its opening month, FlashPicks gained massive traction as it generated 1.8 million organic impressions on Twitter and 28,000 unique users across 75,000 web sessions on its website. Partnerships with micro-influencers and tipsters on social media will also contribute to the expansion.</p>
<p>While commenting on the early numbers, Broxton stated that Checkd is extremely pleased with the progress so far and said that as sports betting is being legalized in the US, the company is convinced that it can become influential and thus, be an important voice in the industry.</p>
