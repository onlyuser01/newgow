<p>BGaming is a renowned supplier which has been building up its portfolio across Europe, with the company now entering the market in Romania through a partnership with Player.ro. This will allow the supplier to deploy 41 of its games in the market locally.</p>
<p>These games will include some of its most innovative and worthwhile experiences, including Wild Cash, Space XY, and Aztec Magic Bonanza. The company is happy to be building for the first time in the thriving Romanian market which has attracted prominent suppliers and operator brands over the past months and has quickly become a focal point of many gaming companies’ efforts for further expansion and establishing themselves locally.</p>
<p>BGaming has also been happy to expand in Romania, as it has demonstrated its ability to grow organically across regulated markets, as attested by the company’s obtaining of a Class II license from the national regulator. BGaming CCO Olga Levshina with whom we recently spoke at SBC Summit Barcelona 2023, was particularly happy with the opportunity to see the company expand in the Balkans, following the supplier’s recent entry in Serbia. Levshina said:</p>
<p>"We are delighted to enter Romania with such a well-established partner. As part of our content agreement, we will provide 41 of our top-performing games to Player.ro, all of which are certified for the Romanian market."</p>
<p>Player.ro CEO Daniela Lupica was similarly happy with the opportunity to work closely with BGaming and help the studio find a firm purchase in the Romanian market as well as bring some innovative and award-winning games that will resonate with the operator’s own audiences.</p>
<p>"Our players have already manifested great interest in BGaming offers and their new releases will definitely generate the same impact," Lupica added. BGaming has been steadily building up its offer, with the company also recently launching with NetBet in Italy, one of the biggest European iGaming markets and one of the biggest gaming brands in the country.</p>
<p>The supplier has had a very firm grasp on how to break ground in new markets and ensure that it delivers worthwhile and meaningful content through the power of customization. Levshina herself has spoken extensively about the benefits of tailored content and how it helps casinos stand out.</p>
<p>BGaming continues to devise and deliver outstanding games that will now be available to Player.ro with the studio making its mark on the dynamic Romanian iGaming market.</p>
