    <h1>Big Candy Casino Turningstone Casino Best Casino Sites Casino Murphy Nc Treasure Island Casino Red W</h1>

<p>Good Morning ma’am. Yes I do have a copy of the email I can forward you. Also, yes the deposit method is bitcoin. I will forward the email now that shows the promotional info on it. Unfortunately I have used all of the funds. I began playing with the bonus and within a few spins was lucky and won somewhere around $230. I played until my balance was at $200 even and I decided to try and withdraw the $200. That’s when I saw that my play through requires me to wager $5280. I was confused and decided to chat into customer service and ask why. That’s when they told me that it has a 40x playthrough. I asked them if I could surrender the bonus funds and surrender the funds that I won which would only leave me with the $40 I used as the initial deposit but they refused. I ended up speaking with 3 different reps and they all were very defensive and not very helpful. Once I realised that they were not going to help me in anyway, I decided to raise my bet to $6.80 and spin until all of the money was gone. Because a 40x WR is unrealistic and almost completely impossible to ever achieve. These online casinos make it so difficult to even win any money at all and with a 40x wagering requirement it’s absolutely impossible. Had that email said that I had a 40x WR I would of NEVER used it and I would of went to a different casino. I feel like they purposely do that to people and it’s not right at all</p>
