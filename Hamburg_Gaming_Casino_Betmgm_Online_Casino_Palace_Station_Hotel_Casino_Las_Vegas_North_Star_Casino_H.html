<p>Police have arrested a 23-year-old accused pimp whose rap song references “prostitutes,” including one who worked for him at the Cosmopolitan Casino on the Las Vegas Strip, authorities said.</p>

<p>Letorian Hunt was arrested Oct. 7. He was charged Oct. 29 with two counts of pandering and two counts of living from the earnings of a prostitute, according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal.</p>
<p>Hunt has been released on bail. He is due in court on Jan. 12.</p>
<p>Before arresting him, Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department officers heard a rap song supposedly composed by Hunt. The song references two successful “prostitutes” working for him, according to the newspaper.</p>
<p>One woman worked at the Cosmopolitan, the police report states.</p>
<p>“She was arrested for soliciting prostitution in the Cosmopolitan, which tied to the song,” according to the police report.</p>
<p>Police had been monitoring Hunt’s social media accounts for at least a year before arresting him. He made numerous posts that tagged photos of a Las Vegas gated community and implied he was a pimp, according to the newspaper.</p>
<p>One post reads, “Roses are red, violets are blue, if you come be my hoe you can be this fly to.” (sic)</p>
<p>In-House Security</p>
<p>During the summer and early fall, violence on the Strip left several people hospitalized in separate incidents.</p>
<p>Police told county officials “a good portion” of the violence is coming from out-of-state gangs and visitors. In response, the combined city-county police department, known locally as Metro, stepped up its presence in tourist areas. Metro calls this program Operation Persistent Pressure.</p>
<p>The Cosmopolitan is among resorts that beefed up their in-house security last month in response to the wave of violence on the Strip. The Cosmopolitan towers over the older Jockey Club on the west side of the famous resort corridor.</p>
<p>The Cosmopolitan now limits entry to customers who have hotel or restaurant reservations, or are rewards members. These restrictions take place on Fridays and Saturdays from 6 pm to 6 am. Guests also are scanned with a metal detector and have their bags checked.</p>
<p>In addition, Metro officers are stationed at doors designated for patrons to enter and leave the Cosmopolitan.</p>
<p>Legal Prostitution</p>
<p>Prostitution is illegal in Las Vegas and Reno, but legal at licensed brothels in some rural Nevada counties.</p>
<p>Nevada is the only state with legalized prostitution.</p>
<p>The Reno Gazette-Journal in August reported that the World Famous Mustang Ranch Brothel in Northern Nevada began offering off-property escort services. This occurred after brothels, and most other businesses, were closed under state-mandated COVID-19 restrictions.</p>
<p>Storey County Sheriff Gerald Antinoro told the newspaper that nothing in the restrictions prohibits escort services.</p>
<p>It’s an escort. There are no sex services,” the sheriff said.</p>
<p>Jeff Page, county manager in nearby Lyon County, said the state’s COVID-19 restrictions apparently do not allow for escort services. Legal brothels also operate in Lyon County.</p>
<p>“I’m not sure how you perform the duties of a prostitute with a mask and social distancing requirements,” he told the newspaper.</p>
<p>Lyon County sex worker Alice Little recently sued Gov. Steve Sisolak (D) for ordering brothels closed during the coronavirus pandemic. She called the closures “arbitrary,” the Reno Gazette-Journal reported. The lawsuit is in Lyon County District Court.</p>
