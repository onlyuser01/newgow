    <h1>Casino Game Online Linq Casino Wonder Casino Plainridge Casino Gulfport Mississippi Casinos Casino D</h1>

<p>will sent proves to you ..</p>
<p>I will keep on complaining until this service is proscribed from our Region, I know where to write complaining letter.</p>
<p>They block my account and canceled my withdrawal of 70k INR , reason is I placed bet of above 500 from free bet bonus they offered after I download casinoday app,</p>
<p>Yes I did place bet of Above 500 but that happended after I clearing wagers which is 35 times of the bonus offered , by that time i was already cleared of Bonus play and free to place bet any amount i want as per they allowed</p>
<p>As per my perspective this Website and its service is not honest and are scammers.</p>
<p>And also My accounts is terminated because I won money without any previous deposits(as I wanted to use free bonus first otherwise I would have deposited some) and i have zero experience.(there app was recommended by a friend of mine to me and wanted to try my luck)</p>
<p>A beginner Won 70k from 500 so they put false allegations that I cheated which not possible, as they are the cheaters themselves.</p>
<p>Listen all : If they offer bonus play and some one win they will not pay them this act shows how dishonest they are.. this can happen to any one.</p>
<p>And also they have details terms and conditions to used them against you in case needed it show they will scam you if you win big amount ,because when you sign up to their website they never mentions you to read their terms and conditions , they know that user will obviously skip reading part and</p>
<p>Tell me who reads Terms and conditions actually? People come to gamble not to read your detailed terms and conditions.</p>
<p>So my Dear brother and sister don't let them fool you , they are bunch scammers operated by few people , may be from their home as they don't seems to have any office or have never exposed themselves openly.</p>
<p>You neither have any information about the owners nor any photo identity (why??)</p>
<p>they never show themselves openly in any social media platform(why??) it shows they are not honest and hiding their identity. You tell me why?</p>
<p>Please vote up my review so that this message can seen to all.</p>
<p>If you don't trust me here is my mail ID I will sent to proves I have screenshots</p>
