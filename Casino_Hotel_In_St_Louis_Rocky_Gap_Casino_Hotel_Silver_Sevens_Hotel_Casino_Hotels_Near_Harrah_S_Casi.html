<p>Allegiant Stadium, the new home of the Las Vegas Raiders, announced Thursday it will go cashless when it opens and will essentially become the first pro sports venue across the US to be cashless from the moment it opens. The announcement is coming ahead of the first sports event that is to be hosted at the stadium, against the New Orleans Saints on September 21, which will take place without fans inside the stadium.</p>
<p>Allegiance Stadium Adopts Cashless Payments</p>
<p>The 65,000-seater will go cashless due to a survey of Raiders personal seat license (PSL) holders and is in line with recent guidance from the Center for Disease Control (CDC), and Nevada Governor Steve Sisolak’s leadership in response to mitigating the risk of further transmission of the COVID-19 disease, through both his Medical Advisory Team and emergency directive urging businesses to adopt contactless payment systems.</p>
<p>“We are thrilled about the impact on the fan experience, as cashless transactions are expected to significantly increase our speed of service, meaning shorter lines, getting fans back to their seats faster. A survey of our PSL Holders also showed that our fans overwhelmingly agree, as a huge majority prefer cashless payment options.” Official Statement</p>
<p>The survey also showed that holders prefer cashless payment options, as they promote overall health, security and public safety for fans and holders alike. Stadium visitors will have to use credit or debit cards or mobile wallets such as Google Pay, Apple Pay and Samsung Pay.</p>
<p>Cash Will Not Be Accepted Anywhere</p>
<p>All areas inside the stadium including the parking lots will not accept cash payments and if football fans happen to arrive at the stadium with cash only, they will have at their disposal several cash-to-card kiosks located inside and outside of the stadium, where they can exchange cash for a prepaid card and use the card for payments inside and outside of the venue.</p>
<p>Fans will not be allowed to attend the first game to take place at the stadium due to ongoing health and safety concerns regarding the second wave of the coronavirus.</p>
<p>In June, the NFL announced one of its most significant post-season events, the NFL Pro Bowl week, will take place at the Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas, scheduled for January 2021, with the Pro Bowl game final set for the end of the month.</p>
