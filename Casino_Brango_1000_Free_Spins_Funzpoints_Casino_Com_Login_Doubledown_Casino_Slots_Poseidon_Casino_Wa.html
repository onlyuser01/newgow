<p>Innovative gaming solution provider Play Synergy will take ownership of Aruze Gaming’s extensive portfolio, solidifying its position as a leading player in the gaming industry. The Empire Technological Group brand aims to fully utilize Aruze’s worldwide assets and brand recognition to bolster its market share, relying on existing synergies to deliver exceptional and innovative products.</p>
<p>This Deal Represents Significant Opportunities</p>
<p>A purchase approval by the United States Bankruptcy Court cleared a significant legal hurdle, meaning the transaction should finalize by September 2023. While the deal still requires additional regulatory approval, it should face no significant hurdles. The acquisition represents a substantial milestone for Play Synergy and Aruze Gaming as they join forces to create a more robust and diversified gaming solutions provider.</p>
<p>This upcoming takeover encompasses significant assets, including Aruze’s land-based game library, lease and participation machines, and other business resources, including valuable intellectual property. This strategic move will bolster Play Synergy’s impressive offerings, empowering the company to refine its exceptional gaming experiences.</p>
<p>Crucially, Play Synergy has committed to continue providing products under the Aruze brand, ensuring a seamless transition for existing customers and preserving the legacy of the iconic gaming supplier. Play Synerg has also announced plans for the pending acquisition of Aruze Gaming’s overseas operations, signaling its intent to expand its reach and establish a global presence in the gaming market.</p>
<p>Aruze May Have Reached the End of the Road</p>
<p>Recent developments may signal the end of Aruze as an independent entity. July saw Interblock purchase the company’s electronic table games division, broadening its range of high-quality, innovative gaming solutions. The acquisition will significantly expand Interblock’s workforce to over 700 employees worldwide, representing a significant opportunity for Aruze’s beleaguered staff.</p>
<p>The shutdown of Aruze’s Las Vegas headquarters will reportedly cause 100 employees to lose their jobs despite Play Synergy’s efforts to onboard as much of the staff as possible. The sale of its overseas properties places even more workers at risk and likely signifies the complete collapse of Aruze.</p>
<p>Play Synergy will remain responsible for honoring Aruze’s legacy and delivering uninterrupted service to the brand’s remaining clients. The gaming industry eagerly awaits all new possibilities and innovations from this dynamic partnership. This deal marks an exciting chapter in Play Synergy’s evolution, creating significant opportunities for innovation and growth.</p>
