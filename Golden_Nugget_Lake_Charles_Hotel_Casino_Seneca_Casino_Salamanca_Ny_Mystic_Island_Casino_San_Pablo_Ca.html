    <h1>Golden Nugget Lake Charles Hotel Casino Seneca Casino Salamanca Ny Mystic Island Casino San Pablo Ca</h1>

<p>I deposited roughly 11,000 in the space of a couple weeks. Kept losing them 1 day I started winning. Got free games on $10 a hit and had roughly $1400 . Then the site crashes and says closed for maintenance. Logged back on then each time I tried to get back on that game it said server error. And I lost everything after that as well as the free spins. I spoke to them for ages and I got no where. To shut me up they gave me a few little shitty bonuses.</p>
<p>after that happened I cracked it and requested to delete my account. They tried to talk me out of it but then offered m another $100 bonus. I refused at first and left the casino. 20 minutes later I ask to log back on and I collect the $100 Vip bonus. Long story from that I withdrew 2 lots of $5000 and still had roughy 28000 in my account which I was waiting for my dad.</p>
<p>everything was ok it was pending and I spoke to the hosts about. 3 times. All the hosts have m no sign they weren't going to pay me. Then I get an e mail saying that I can't win that money. But they were willing to pay me 2500 out of the 38,000taken it but I had no re</p>
<p>i got them to 5000 , I really shouldn't of</p>
<p>Taken it but they kept saying they were doing me a favour and that I should take it, and I had lost a bit of money at that point so I took it. It arrived in my account a day later.</p>
<p>in reality there was some change in my account when they gave me the bonus so some of my money was there. I never asked for the bonus they just credited it in my account when I returned.</p>
<p>should of fought.</p>
