<p>Intema Solutions Inc. will continue working with Lazarus Growth to boost its presence in the iGaming and eSports market.</p>
<p>Focus on iGaming and eSports</p>
<p>Canadian software and marketing solutions provider Intema Solutions Inc. announced on 31 December that it would continue working with Lazarus Growth in 2021.</p>
<p>Lazarus Growth is a division of innovative law firm Lazarus Charbonneau. The division provides companies and start-ups with general counseling and strategic advice on improving growth and scope.</p>
<p>Intema Solutions is looking to boost its growth and market strength in the iGaming and eSports sectors, CEO and President Laurent Benezra has said. He noted that these particular sectors have enjoyed robust growth this past year.</p>
<p>Mr. Benezra lauded Lazarus Growth’s market expertise and their experience working with big-name operators, providers and regulators. He explained that the cooperation would mostly entail assistance with research and negotiations.</p>
<p>“Their mandate will mainly consist of assisting us in our research and negotiations with the companies that will be targeted” -Intema Solutions President and CEO Laurent Benezra</p>
<p>A Booming Market</p>
<p>The online gambling (iGaming) sector has seen substantial growth in both scope and importance in 2020. Jurisdictions across the globe have gradually turned to the booming market, especially in 2020.</p>
<p>According to a forecast by Global Markets Insights, the global online gambling sector is expected to grow by around 16.5% between 2020 and 2026. The reasons for this are multifaceted.</p>
<p>In short, one of the primary drivers is technological innovation. The evolution and introduction of AI technology, VR and machine learning are expected to drive profits and innovation in the fledgeling gambling sector.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the market has proven its substantial revenue-generating potential. This has already attracted the attention of multiple big market jurisdictions. This process will likely only speed up with time.</p>
<p>The increased availability of smartphones is another driving factor. Online gambling is simply more accessible and flexible compared to traditional land-based gambling. However, this depends on regulations. Nevada’s stricter regulations of online gambling are what allowed it to be surpassed by New Jersey.</p>
<p>The iGaming sector’s growth in 2020 was also boosted by the global pandemic. Casino attendance restrictions and increased leisure time, among other things, are important catalysts in this development.</p>
<p>Finally, the sector is already facing some difficult challenges, which will likely only grow with time. This includes the increased prevalence of cybercrime and targeted hacker attacks, as well as difficult relationships with regulators and jurisdictions. An extreme example of this is Iran’s recent proposal to make online gambling punishable by death.</p>
