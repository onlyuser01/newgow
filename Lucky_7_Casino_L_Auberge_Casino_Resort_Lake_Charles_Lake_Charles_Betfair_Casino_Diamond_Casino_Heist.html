<p>BrewDog, the Scottish brewer known for its bold beer and bolder claims, is opening its first Las Vegas brewery in typical style. It will be “the first ever carbon-negative bar in Las Vegas,” according to the company’s marketing materials.</p>
<p>The rooftop bar opens Friday, Dec. 2 above the Showcase Mall. The shopping center, known for its 100 foot-tall Coca-Cola bottle, will now also be known for its 4,000 square-foot LED BrewDog cube sign.</p>
<p>“This is going to be one of our most epic locations that we’ve ever created, and we can’t wait to be opening our doors,” the company’s website promises.</p>

<p>The 30,000 square-foot Las Vegas BrewDog will feature an onsite brewery with 10-barrel brewing system, an event space, a retro game zone, and full-size shuffleboard tables. According to vegas.eater.com, BrewDog incurred $2.65 million in construction costs alone.</p>
<p>Among the bar’s 96 beers on tap will be a special edition of BrewDog’s Elvis Juice beer, a citrus-infused American IPA with a caramel malt base and notes of pine, orange, and grapefruit. Its menu will offer not only bar food, but pizza, tacos, lobster, and Wagyu beef burgers.</p>
<p>On opening night, according to the company, a raffle will be held to award a $1 million bar tab.</p>
<p>Low-Carbon Beer?</p>
<p>Though the company announced the inclusion of “an urban forest” in its Las Vegas bar, achieving carbon negativity through a smattering of rooftop trees is a dubious claim. Most likely, the company means that the new bar’s carbon emissions will be offset by other company-wide activities. In 2020, BrewDog announced it officially had become carbon-negative – removing twice as much carbon from the atmosphere than it adds – thanks to its green investments. These include purchasing 2,000 Scottish acres on which it announced plans to plant 1 million trees.</p>
<p>“Huge change is needed right now, and we want to be a catalyst for that change in our industry and beyond,” BrewDog cofounder James Watt said at the time. “We fully acknowledge that we are a long way from perfect. However, we are determined to rapidly and fundamentally change everything as we work hard to ensure we have a positive impact on the planet.”</p>
<p>BrewDog – which has opened more than 100 bars in the past five years – is known for its provocative claims and business moves. In 2010, it produced 12 bottles of a beer called “The End of History.” Consisting of 55% alcohol by volume, it was the world’s strongest beer at the time – a title that has since been usurped. In 2018, BrewDog introduced Pink IPA, a limited edition bottling of its Punk IPA coinciding with International Women’s Day. The bottle’s label featured the slogan “Beer for Girls,” igniting a backlash which, two years later, Watt called “justified.”</p>
<p>Last June, more than 100 former BrewDog employees published an open letter criticizing the firm’s business practices and treatment of its employees. The letter cited a “culture of fear,” and claimed the company was “built on a cult of personality” under Watt. Watt later apologized on Twitter, stating that his business was focused “not on contradicting or contesting the details of [the] letter, but to listen, learn, and act.”</p>
