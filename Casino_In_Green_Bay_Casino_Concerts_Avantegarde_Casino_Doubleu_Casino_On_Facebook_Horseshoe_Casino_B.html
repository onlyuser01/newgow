<p>Design Works Gaming (DWG) has launched its full portfolio of games in Michigan through a link-up with DraftKings. DraftKings is a prominent sportsbook and casino in the United States, which has been expanding its reach in the iGaming sector. This marks the latest iGaming partner the supplier has secured in the Great Lakes State after a partnership with BetMGM earlier this month.</p>
<p>Design Works Gaming Committed to NA Growth</p>
<p>Thanks to Design Works Gaming, the operator will have the opportunity to further secure its position in this vertical and improve on its existing offer. Design Works Gaming has been up and running since October 2021 and has driven several forays into the US market already. Commenting on the latest opportunity, company CEO Troy Zurawski said:</p>
<p>We’re serious about transforming online casino content in the US, and that means taking our games into all regulated jurisdictions across the country. DWG CEO Troy Zurawski</p>
<p>The partnership will be facilitated through the OpenGaming platform by Light &amp; Wonder, with Design Works Gaming featuring many specials such as Double Fancy 7s and 10X Fortune among others. Zurawski noted that following the launch in Ontario, the company has been determined to drive forays into the regulated US market.</p>
<p>DraftKings makes a perfect choice for the company to expand into the iGaming market in the United States, the executive noted, arguing that the company has built a highly competitive and exciting ecosystem for its users.</p>
<p>He further added that DraftKings has so far helped push Design Works Gaming in every market the two companies have worked together, noting that there was a clear interest in the company’s titles from players. Design Works Gaming has been steadily increasing its presence with leading operators not just in North America, but also in Europe.</p>
<p>The company launched with Mr Green in the United Kingdom introducing its products to more players still. However, this is not the only UK operator the company has teamed up with over recent months. In July, the company also signed a content partnership with 888casino also for the United Kingdom.</p>
