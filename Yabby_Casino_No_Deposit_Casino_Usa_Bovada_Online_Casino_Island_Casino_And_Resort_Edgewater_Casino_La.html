    <h1>Yabby Casino No Deposit Casino Usa Bovada Online Casino Island Casino And Resort Edgewater Casino La</h1>

<p>The actual amount is 2.6btc, but I cannot find BTC in the dropdown / the CAD price is changing rapidly with everything going on in the market.</p>
<p>Over the last month or so, I had been playing, and very lucky, at Bitcoin Games Casino. It seemed like the perfect casino - it was fun, it was BTC based, and there were no withdrawal or deposit limits. I was loving it.</p>
<p>I was aggressively playing - typically the max or close to it - exclusively on slots (and only a couple of slots that I really liked).</p>
<p>I had several wins that were large, and eventually paid out; usually after 48hrs. I was a little anxious with each payout, and a little aggravated when it took longer than 48hrs, but generally, I couldn't have been happier.</p>
<p>Over the past week however, I had several more wins - totalling 2.6btc and this time the payments weren't coming. I continue to ask for updates, asked to speak with a manager, etc -- and then, out of no where, the casino wrote, claimed I was playing fraudulently and said they had closed my account, confiscated my winnings and even dared to say I owe them money for the withdrawals I had received.</p>
<p>I genuinely cannot even begin to understand what they believe happened; other than just not wanting to pay me out. Yes, I won, but as you'll see from the logs, I also was depositing a huge amount. Typically, I withdrew so I could keep tabs on my overall number (and out of fear that something like this would happen) and then immediately deposited again. I even deposited additional money when a withdrawal was requested because I assumed that meant it was all good...</p>
<p>Though the casino gave me a 'form letter' explination, they haven't actually said exactly what they believe happened. I really wish they would be I litterally did nothing other than deposit, spin, win/lose, repeat. Any investigation would show that, so my hope is that it's a misunderstanding (maybe people don't play as much as me?) and not them trying to scam/fraud me out of a winning. I've said it before, but I'll say it again - I was on top of the world and honestly expected the email from the casino to be one asking if they could use my name/story on their website to celebrate a winner -- not that they weren't going to pay me out.</p>
<p>Along the way, my "VIP" manager was apologetic, said it was with the payment team and offered me cash back bonuses on my deposits while I waited. I kept depositing right up until they closed me account üôÅ</p>
