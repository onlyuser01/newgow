    <h1>Casinos In Shreveport Slot Machine Jackpot Casino L Auberge Casino In Louisiana Bay Mills Casino Hot</h1>

<p>I told them to quit doing that because it would be detrimental if only my points were removed.</p>
<p>I also asked if it was a glitch.</p>
<p>Support accepted it and decided not to delete the points and not to change them.</p>
<p>You will notice that I have stated that this allows me to continue to play with peace of mind.</p>
<p>The casino did not deny any of this statement (i.e., affirmed it).</p>
<p>If the casino was going to remove my points or fix the glitch, they would have said, in response to my query, 'I will contact the relevant team and ask them to response.</p>
<p>Since he did not even do that, I assumed that this chat partner was a great person in the casino and could have made policy decisions on his own.</p>
<p>Also, this chat took place early in the tournament, which gave the casino plenty of time to give me additional information, but none.</p>
<p>The chat ends here.</p>
<p>Support has not sent me any additional information since.</p>
<p>The fact that I have not been contacted at all about whether I may continue to play or fix the glitch is what I would consider evidence that I am allowed to continue playing.</p>
<p>If they had changed their policy and decided to remove the points or fix the glitches they would have sent me a message at least within a week., but the casino did not do so.</p>
<p>Even if this chat partner had no idea to contact the relevant team at the time of the chat,</p>
<p>Naturally, this chat content should have been sent to the technical staff for review.</p>
<p>They knew that my points were unreasonably high at the time and that there was a glitch. But they never contacted me. Not even a word to ask me to wait a little while while they investigate.</p>
<p>Also, this defect has not been fixed until the end of the project. Of course, the points that were unfairly earned due to this glitch have not been reduced, including all users. The fact that this problem was reported at an early stage and could have easily been corrected, but was not, makes it natural to assume that the company's policy is not to correct problems once they have occurred.</p>
<p>Of course, I did not receive the following message.</p>
<p>'We won't fix this glitch because there are so many targets, but when another glitch occurs, we'll think about fixing it and reducing the points.'</p>
<p>As to why the casino did not fix this glitch, I do not know the reason. Ask the casino if you are concerned.</p>
<p>I therefore decided that I could play to my advantage and continued to play.</p>
<p>(At this point, I only knew about the minimum wager glitch, but given the example of how they responded by 'not fixing the glitch and not reducing the points,' it is natural to assume that they would respond the same way if there were other glitches that I didn't know about.)</p>
