    <h1>Robert De Niro Movie Casino Green Bay Wi Oneida Casino Hard Rock Hotel And Casino Casinos In Vicksbu</h1>

<p>POSTED ON APRIL 19, 2023</p>
<p>I created my account on February 22nd and made a deposit of 250 euro, claimed the welcome bonus, and began making 7 euro bets on slots. I was able to clear the bonus and win 108740 euro. After sending in my verification documents, my account was fully verified on February 27th.</p>
<p>I then made a withdrawal request for 5000 euro, but was informed that the payment would be split up into 1000 euro increments. I have recived in total 4000â‚¬ in 6 months. The rest of my money is pending. And one payment is stuck or missing at the payment provider? They come up with random excuses, saying they are investigating and blame payment provider etc etc but nothing ever happens.</p>
<p>How is this ok for an MGA casino? It will take a lifetime to recive my money in this rate.</p>
<p>This is completely unacceptable. I urge you to resolve this matter immediately and to send me the remaining payments owed to me as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Thanks in Advance</p>
