    <h1>Atlantic City Casino Map Wild Vegas Casino Mill Bay Casino Primaplay Casino Login Golden Nugget Las</h1>

<p>Hey,</p>
<p>The casino closed my account and declined the winnings and has not provided further details as to why. About 2 weeks later I downloaded the first 3 documents for them and they were approved. It took 3 days and they asked for more documents, I sent them too.</p>
<p>It went on again for several days and then came up with a message, "Unfortunately, we can't verify your account yet.</p>
<p>Since you have many matches with other accounts, we are waiting for the rest of the accounts to send us their documents. In case we can't identify all the accounts you have matches with, your account will be blocked and your deposits will be returned. "</p>
<p>I knew right away that there would be no payment from them. And what do they mean "wait for the rest of the documents from other accounts ??? !! I don't understand this.</p>
<p>Well of course I asked for refinement but it didn't come. Went week and then came a call where were asking what and how I've been playing them and everything else aj, for example, what the game brought the biggest profit ?? couldn't remember when there were quite a few big wins.</p>
<p>Then came the final message:</p>
<p>"Our security department has made a final decision and your account will stay blocked and winning funds voided.</p>
<p>Based on your provided answers in verification call and different factors we have reasonable suspicions that your account is applicable with fraudulent activity's.</p>
<p>We will return your deposits to your Skrill account (25.00 EUR / 70.00 EUR)</p>
<p>Our managementâ€™s decision is final.</p>
<p>So, I realized that not all of my answers pleased me and take away the victory.</p>
<p>The casino in question recently committed the same offense to a few other players as well!</p>
