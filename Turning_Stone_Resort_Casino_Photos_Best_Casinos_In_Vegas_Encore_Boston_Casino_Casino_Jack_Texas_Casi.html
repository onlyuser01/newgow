<p>Provider of lottery casino and sportsbook gambling products Kings Entertainment Group announced today a marketing partnership with one of the largest telecommunications tower real estate owners in Latin America, Balesia.</p>
<p>Targeting Cell Phone Markets</p>
<p>The agreement between Kings Entertainment, the parent company of the LottoKings and WinTrillions lottery and gaming brands, and Mexican telecommunications tower owner Balesia is opening up a potential market of more than six million mobile phone users in Mexico alone, with opportunities for expansion into other Latin American countries.</p>
<p>“Cell phones are increasingly the dominant platform for entertainment and iGaming. We were seeking a marketing partner that could provide instant access to a significant base of users within our most profitable market. Balesia fits the bill perfectly.” Steve Budin, CEO, Kings Entertainment Group</p>
<p>Following the marketing agreement with Canadian Securities Exchange (CSE)-listed Kings Entertainment, Balesia customers in Mexico can experience the unparalleled gaming excitement from the lottery and online casino games offered by WinTrillions as late as April this year, while other Balesia markets across Latin America are meant to follow suit by the end of 2022.</p>
<p>“In a world where telecommunications technology and entertainment are merging and morphing into one experience, we see WinTrillions as the ideal platform to offer our users a complete gaming experience that is safe, fair, affordable, and fun. Our user bases are very complementary, and we see significant potential to expand this even further.” George Alvarez, CEO, Balesia</p>
<p>Working on Many Fronts</p>
<p>The marketing agreement with Balesia is the latest initiative of the innovative lottery and gambling group as it embarked on a busy 2022 so far, introducing new products and moving early to establish a presence in the metaverse.</p>
<p>In January, Kings Entertainment launched the LottoHub lottery results app to offer lottery players around the world access to instant lottery results from numerous popular lotteries worldwide. The app has an in-built capability of setting alarms based on personal preferences, as well as instant viewing options for up to ten lotteries.</p>
<p>Last month, Kings Entertainment showed significant interest in establishing a presence for itself in the metaverse by looking to acquire land in the Vegas City area in Decetraland and take gambling into the virtual space.</p>
<p>The company secured an URL, contracted a global digital asset investment and capital markets advisory firm to receive advice on its next move and created an internal division tasked with operations in the metaverse.</p>
