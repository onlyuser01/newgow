<p>One of the victims suffered a wound on his hand and torso, the Buffalo News reported. He was able to walk into the nearby casino and report the incident.</p>
<p>Buffalo police were notified at 3:30 am. When officers arrived, a second victim was found on a ramp in the garage. The victims were described as a woman and two men. Each was in their 20s. All three reside in the Buffalo area.</p>
<p>They each were taken to Erie County Medical Center. Their conditions as of early Sunday were not immediately available. Police did not release their names to the public.</p>
<p>Two Men in Custody</p>
<p>The two men were in police custody. Both were charged with criminal possession of a loaded handgun, the News reported. Police also discovered dozens of shell casings near the crime scene, the report said.</p>
<p>Police searched for evidence and witnesses on Saturday. They are likely also to review video from surveillance cameras at the casino.</p>
<p>Prior Crimes</p>
<p>Earlier this month, in an unrelated incident, a former blackjack dealer at the Seneca Buffalo Creek Casino was facing fresh charges of colluding with players.</p>
<p>Initially, the former dealer, Emily M. Torres, 21, of Lackawanna, N.Y., appeared in Buffalo court last month for alleged fraud at a gaming table. A player, Mark M. Watson, Jr., 28, of Buffalo, also appeared before a judge last month.</p>
<p>Watson, Torres and a third suspect, Rahat Hossain, 34, were each charged with first-degree gaming fraud.</p>
<p>On Aug. 14 and 15, Torres allegedly helped Watson win $5,300. She also allegedly helped Hossain win about $2,200. She flashed cards at her table they weren’t supposed to see, authorities said.</p>
<p>The incidents were recorded on surveillance cameras at the casino.</p>
<p>More recently, new charges arose that Torres helped still another player, Jordan Mack, 44, of Friendship, N.Y., win about $5,700.</p>
<p>Torres allegedly flashed cards to Mack on 62 separate occasions. As a result, Mack was also charged with gaming fraud.</p>
<p>All four suspects pleaded not guilty in court. They could face a year in jail if found guilty of the gaming fraud counts.</p>
<p>Following their arrests, Watson and Hossain repaid their winnings to the casino. Watson repaid $5,287.50, and Hossain repaid $2,210.</p>
<p>Banned from Casino</p>
<p>Both were ordered to stay away from the Seneca Buffalo Creek and other Seneca Nation gaming properties. They were released on their own recognizance.</p>
<p>Seneca Buffalo Creek Casino is located in Buffalo’s inner harbor area. The casino is operated by Seneca Gaming Corporation (SGC). SGC is a tribally-chartered corporation of the Seneca Nation of Indians.</p>
