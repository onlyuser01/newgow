<p>SoftSwiss’ affiliate marketing platform, Affilka, announced it has seen an increase in monthly player acquisitions.</p>
<p>Affilka Reports 20% Increase in Monthly Player Acquisitions</p>
<p>The company released a statement on Wednesday outlining that it has seen strong growth with a 20% increase in monthly player acquisitions. The recent result reaffirms the growth of the affiliate marketing platform that offers convenient solutions for its clients. Citing results from its latest migration cases, Affilka revealed that there are multiple reasons why operators chose to switch their affiliate management platform.</p>
<p>One of the prime reasons why operators select different affiliate platforms is breaches related to compliance with anti-money laundering regulations. Additionally, some operators come across insufficient reporting for players or a “lack of detailed and customizable affiliate” and according to Affilka, this pushes them to change the affiliate platform. Judging by its latest migration cases, the platform acknowledged that such insufficiencies in combination with poor reporting can negatively impact the growth of affiliates.</p>
<p>“Affilka by SOFTSWISS, an innovative and award-winning partner tracking platform, offers complete platform transition support which includes assistance from accounts managers and technical staff to address all client concerns, whether past or present,“ reads a statement released by SoftSwiss</p>
<p>The Platform Offers Multiple Benefits for Operators and Affiliates</p>
<p>Anastasiya Borovaya, SoftSwiss’ head of Affilka, commented that switching affiliate platforms brings challenges. At the same time, she outlined that such a decision can be pushed by multiple factors such as unclear results or complicated processes. Borovaya pointed out that Affilka has a strong team of industry experts that ensures a smooth transition and makes the process as seamless as possible. In conclusion, she added: “Whatever our clients decide, Affilka’s account managers will be there to walk them through the transition.”</p>
<p>“At Affilka, we have built the necessary software platform migration expertise to take the lead. The process may be as simple as moving affiliate IDs and contact details or rather as complex as transitioning player historical data and affiliate payment history to meet the new platform’s requirements.“ Anastasiya Borovaya, head of Affilka at SoftSwiss</p>
<p>Affilka pointed out that there are multiple benefits available for clients migrated to its platform. Such benefits include full technical support boosted by automation, as well as a multi-level reporting system offering constant updates for partners and operators. Additionally, the company is crypto-friendly and offers different payment solutions. Last but not least, migrated clients have access to “flexible commission plans and traffic budget optimization,” according to Affilka.</p>
