    <h1>Chicago Casino Instant Payout Casino Casino Hotels Near Me Casino Metropolis Real Cash Casino Games</h1>

<p>Hi petronella, of course my partner as well as my father is the only legitimate owner of the card, but the problem is not here, I explained this to the casino and he told me to send the card holder's documents to KYC and that there is no would have been problems, the problem is that they ask for a photo of the card where the name and surname of the holder is written, unfortunately this card did not print it and I was asked to send a bank statement containing the name, surname and the last 4 digits of the card, but since the account statement does not contain the last 4 digits I was asked to send an account statement of the last 3 months that contains the deposits on the site, the problem is that the bank only provides account statements for the whole year so this is where I don't know how to do it, I tried to request the bank statement for the last 3 months and I'm still waiting for an answer. So it is probable that if the bank provides me with this account statement, the card will be verified, but despite this, if possible, I would like to be able to eliminate this card not in my name and be enabled for withdrawal procedures using the card in my name and already verified, hoping to speed up times since the bank will provide me with the account statement for the last 3 months probably in 2/3 working days if it is able to provide it.</p>
<p>however, I sent the 2022 card statement to the KYC where the name and surname match those of my father's document, in addition to this, even if the statement does not have the last 4 digits, it also has the IBAN obviously the same as that on the back of the physical card, isn't this enough for verification?</p>
<p>thanks in advance and for the help</p>
<p>Best regards</p>
