<p>Earlier this year, the global sports betting, gaming and entertainment group, Entain, announced a new strategic partnership with the only regulated racing and sports betting operator in New Zealand, TAB NZ. The monumental 25-year strategic partnership sought approval from the government before it comes into effect on June 1, 2023.</p>
<p>Now, Entain confirmed that it has secured approval for the strategic collaboration from the New Zealand Minister for Racing, effectively paving the way for new growth opportunities for the company as well as TAB NZ. Coinciding with the approval from the government, TAB NZ’s chief executive officer (CEO), Mike Tod, confirmed he will step down from his role.</p>
<p>Tod joined TAB NZ as CEO back in 2022. The strategic appointment came during a transformational period for the company that sought to team up with a globally-recognizable operator to supercharge its operations and the delivery of innovative products and solutions for its clients. At the same time, such a deal was expected to help reduce problem gambling.</p>
<p>Now, less than two years after Tod’s appointment, TAB NZ’s plan is a reality and he confirmed that he will step down from the role. It’s not surprising that his resignation will be effective as of June 1, which coincides with the start of the contract between TAB NZ and Entain.</p>
<p>The CEO, Excited to Pass the Baton</p>
<p>The outgoing CEO of TAB NZ shared his excitement in a statement and explained that he will pass on the responsibilities to Nick Roberts, who holds the role of chief transition officer. On the other hand, Tod explained that Entain New Zealand will be led by TAB NZ’s current chief commercial officer, Cameron Rodger.</p>
<p>“I will be stepping away as Chief Executive Officer on June 1 with an immense level of pride and passing the baton to my colleague chief transition officer Nick Roberts.“ Mike Tod, outgoing CEO of TAB NZ</p>
<p>Tod thanked his colleagues and the senior-level team and added: “I am beyond proud of them both for securing these key leadership roles and their appointments are a reflection of the commitment that the TAB NZ Board, under the outstanding leadership of Chair Mark Stewart and Deputy Chair Anna Stove, has made to supporting the development of our 460 people, who have been guaranteed jobs by Entain for at least the next two years.”</p>
<p>Dean Shannon, Entain Australia’s CEO, shared his excitement about the government approval for the deal with TAB NZ. He said that the company is delighted to see the green light for this strategic collaboration. Finally, Shannon predicted that the collaboration will deliver significant benefits for sports fans and bettors in New Zealand.</p>
