    <h1>Best Casinos In The World Wingate By Wyndham Lake Charles Casino Area Ho Chunk Casino Wisconsin Dell</h1>

<p>I often play on the Lucky Creek online casino. I played the night of 4/17/22, and went to claim a $50 loyalty bonus. When it did not come into my account, I made a $25.00 deposit and played for many hours until I totaled winnings over $1600.00. I cashed out $1500.00, applied the funds transfer info and it was completed. When I got to the 'done' page, there was a link in green "FORFEIT CLAIM' TO CLICK ON. I went to the chat to verify that if I forfeited that bonus would I lose my winnings. They said NO. I asked again another way to be sure, and they said NO. So I clicked it and went on about my business. I checked two days later, today, to see if it had been processed, and though it had been, right above it, $1400.00 of it had been canceled.</p>
<p>I went back on chat and they said it was because I played on a bonus when I won that and the rules say that a $100 win max is on a bobus win! BUT I DID NOT PLAY ON A BONUS!</p>
