    <h1>Candyland Casino Login Oldest Vegas Casino Four Winds South Bend Casino Remington Park Casino Oklaho</h1>

<p>Leading gambling technology company Playtech signed an agreement to further strengthen its long-term relationship with Mansion by providing the online gambling firm with its digital sports book, available under the Casino.com brand of the gaming company.</p>
<p>Sports Book and Virtual Sports Additions</p>
<p>Playtech and Mansion extended their partnership deal for another 5 years in January and the new agreement will see not only the addition of the technology provider’s sports book to the gambling portfolio of the gaming operator, but also Playtech’s innovative Virtual Sports popular ball and racing sports offerings that feature 3D animation.</p>
<p>Earlier in the year, Playtech extended its collaboration with Mansion in two of Europe’s leading regulated markets, UK and Italy, the country where Playtech also operates retail betting outlets. The deal both parties signed included a dedicated Casino tab on Mansion’s flagship brand Casino.com, following Mansion’s recent commitment to a bespoke Live Casino studio space in Playtech’s Eurolive facility, featuring both Live Roulette and Live Blackjack.</p>
<p>MansionCasino Will Also Feature Playtech’s Sports Book</p>
<p>Under the new agreement, Playtech’s sports book product will initially go live at the Casino.com and during the second phase of the launch, planned for later this year, will extend to the MansionCasino brand.</p>
<p>“We are delighted to continue to support Mansion in their position as market leaders. This is a further step in the evolution of our strong long-term partnership, and we are excited to be part of their growth. Together, we can support them in delivering an even more personalised, responsible player experience, and look forward to seeing continued success across markets in the coming years.” Shimon Akad, Chief Operating Officer, Playtech</p>
<p>Mansion is an online gambling company with more than 10 years of experience in online betting and heritage of supporting sports teams, mainly in the English Premier League. Despite offering a huge variety of betting choice and style across its portfolio of brands, strengthening the relationship with Playtech, with its proven track record of innovation and engaging content, is an opportunity Mansion is excited to explore.</p>
<p>“We are very excited to grow our long-standing partnership with Playtech, their proven expertise enables us to offer the ultimate experience for our players. The addition of their digital sportsbook will provide our customers with a seamless, multi-gaming platform; the very best in online gaming, all under one roof.” Karel Manasco, Chief Executive Officer, Mansion</p>
