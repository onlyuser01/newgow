    <h1>Ultra Panda Casino Casino Close To Me Lake Charles Casinos Hotels Casinos In Philadelphia Ms Free Ch</h1>

<p>I contacted this site with my concerns and complaints 4/3/23 when I first opened this account and deposit £50 via bank transfer</p>
<p>My reasons was because this was not deposited and also on my transactions history page it was showing 12 other deposits of £50 all with different reference numbers and different types of deposits methods. Also was all done within seconds of each other … this would have been £600 they was going to take from my accounts</p>
<p>I requested to have all 12 of these deposits cancelled as they was all pending and also cancel my original deposit and return to my account as per their cancellation policy</p>
<p>I eventually got a very rude reply from support at usoft stating I have multiple accounts and that they have pre warned me of this in the past</p>
<p>THIS IS ABSOLUTELY NOT TRUE .. I asked for this evidenced but they have since cancelled my access to the site and banned me. I have still not had any response as to why there was 12 deposits pending, all from the 4/3/23 all with in seconds of each other, with different deposits methods and different reference numbers (see attached for this evidence)</p>
<p>Usoft also stated that due to this my original deposit was not successful</p>
<p>However since 4/3/23 when I was blocked from this account my original deposit of £50 has been cleared (see attached for evidence of this</p>
<p>I reported this to my bank account to have all 12 cancelled. I was advised by my bank to report this to fraud action</p>
<p>Apart from one very rude email from Usoft I have not had any response to any of my emails I have sent to</p>
