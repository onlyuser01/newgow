<p>Trump Calls on Senate Judiciary Committee to Investigate Obama, Political Bettors Dismiss Possibility</p>

<p>Trump has launched an aggressive attack on his predecessor via Twitter, accusing the former president of illegally targeting his associates before departing the White House. Specifically, Trump believes Obama played a role in the FBI’s handling of his former National Security Adviser, Michael Flynn.</p>
<p>“If I were a Senator or Congressman, the first person I would call to testify about the biggest political crime and scandal in the history of the USA, by FAR, is former President Obama. He knew EVERYTHING. Do it @LindseyGrahamSC, just do it. No more Mr. Nice Guy. No more talk!” Trump tweeted today.</p>
<p>Political bettors say there’s little chance charges will be brought against the former President. The PredictIt market asking, “Will a federal charge against Barack Obama be confirmed before November 3?” has “Yes” shares trading at just 10 cents.</p>
<p>PredictIt opened the market on Wednesday, and nearly 24,000 shares have already been traded.</p>
<p>Graham Denies Trump</p>
<p>Flynn pleaded guilty in December of 2017 to “willfully and knowingly” making false statements to the FBI regarding his conversations with a Russian ambassador. However, the Justice Department dropped all charges against Flynn earlier this month, saying the FBI had insufficient basis to probe Flynn in the first place, and charges should have never been brought against him.</p>
<p>Trump believes Obama was part of a treasonous conspiracy to undermine his presidency. Graham says there are no plans to call on the former commander-in-chief to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee.</p>
<p>I don’t think now’s the time for me to do that,” Graham said Thursday. “I am greatly concerned about the precedent that would be set by calling a former president for oversight.”</p>
<p>“No president is above the law. However, the presidency has executive privilege claims against other branches of government,” Graham concluded.</p>
<p>Obama Spotlight</p>
<p>Trump, trying to get the national economy back up and running in time for the November election, is hitting the campaign trail to rile up supporters. He’s in Pennsylvania today, a state he managed to flip in 2016 after Keystone State voters backed the Democratic presidential nominee in each general election since 1988.</p>
<p>PredictIt bettors feel Trump will have a difficult time winning Pennsylvania again. Democratic shares for winning Pennsylvania in November are at 62 cents.</p>
<p>Obama has ended his political quarantine since leaving the White House to publicly help his former Vice President Joe Biden evict Trump from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Obama endorsed Biden in April, and since then has gone on the offensive against Trump.</p>
<p>“In moments of crisis, we look out for one other. And we need leaders with empathy who will bring people together rather than drive them apart,” Obama tweeted regarding Trump’s handling of the pandemic.</p>
<p>The PredictIt market asking which party wins in November has Democratic shares in the lead at 53 cents.</p>
