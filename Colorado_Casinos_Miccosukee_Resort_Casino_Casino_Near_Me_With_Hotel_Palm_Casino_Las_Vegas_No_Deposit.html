<p>Tottenham are 1-0 down on aggregate in the Champions League doubleheader with AC Milan. The good news for the Spurs is that the second leg is played on their turf</p>
<p>With the support of their fans at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, Antonio Conte and his men are confident they can beat AC Milan and advance to the next phase of the 2022-23 Champions League. The bad news, however, is that they’ll be without a couple of key players on Wednesday, March 8.</p>

<p>Winning is the Only Option for the Spurs</p>
<p>They lost the first game of the UCL Round of 16 doubleheaders, but the good thing is that they lost it by just one goal. What this means is that they do have a good chance to advance to the next phase of the competition. For that, winning on Wednesday is a must.</p>
<p>They surely got the motivation to win, not to mention that their fans will push them forward if something goes astray. There are some worries, however. First of all, they’re coming off two straight losses to teams that are much worse than them – Sheffield United (FA Cup) and Wolves (Premier League).</p>
<p>Secondly, they have some injury worries, with at least five first-team players set to miss Wednesday’s game. Eric Dier, who’s been their defensive pillar this season, is suspended, while their first-choice goalie Huge Lloris is out with an injury. Full-back Ryan Sessegnon is also out because of an injury, the same as midfielders Yves Bissouma and Rodrigo Bentancur.</p>
<p>AC Milan Need to Improve Their Performances on the Road</p>
<p>The Italian champions need to be worried ahead of their trip to London. It’s because these guys tend to do badly on the road. In fact, their away record in 2023 is 2-1-3, with their wins happening against Salernitana and Monza, two teams that played in the Italian second tier (Serie B) not too long ago.</p>
<p>Further, in the group stage of the 2022-23 Champions League, AC Milan went 1-1-1 on the road. The only team they beat away from home is Dinamo Zagreb, which finished bottom of the table.</p>
<p>On the bright side for AC Milan, most of their players are fit and ready to give their absolute best on the pitch. But will their best be good enough to avoid losing to Tottenham in London?</p>
<p>Tottenham vs AC Milan Prediction</p>
<p>It’s not going to be easy but we think Tottenham are going to pull it off. They’re going to beat AC Milan on Wednesday and book themselves the ticket to the quarterfinal of the Champions League.</p>
<p>Pick: Tottenham to win; over 2.5 goals</p>
