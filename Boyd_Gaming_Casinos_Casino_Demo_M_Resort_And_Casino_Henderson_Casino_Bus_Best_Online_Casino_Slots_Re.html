    <h1>Boyd Gaming Casinos Casino Demo M Resort And Casino Henderson Casino Bus Best Online Casino Slots Re</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Signed up on RedDog casino approximately 3 weeks ago. I’ve won and lost but now I’m up $7,500. I have submitted my withdrawal documents 3 times.</p>
<p>The first time I was denied withdrawal was my fault, I admit. I deposited with other cards and didn’t send them the pics of those cards. Oooops my bad. Thought nothing more of it. Sent the pics and didn’t get a response back for 3 days. The pictures I sent were too blurry and I needed to send higher resolution copies. Ok fine, not a problem. Sent those new higher resolution documents and now I haven’t heard anything back from them AT ALL in 7 days.</p>
<p>I was able to get a hold of customer support by phone earlier today and she told me that I had to send higher resolution documents/pictures per a note made by the verification department. I asked her when that note was made by the verification department and she gave the date that I sent the newer documents which obviously showed this was not updated. She then basically told me to be more patient and provided no assurance that this will be resolved.</p>
<p>I have become highly skeptical on this site. At the very least this is a poorly ran verification department and this needs to be rectified.</p>
