    <h1>Paysbig Potawatomi Bingo Casino Calder Casino Juegos De Casinos Gratis Pala Casino Resort Nj Online</h1>

<p>They have now said that they tried to process the money into my bank based on information id given. And stated that my financial institution had blocked the transaction. I then went straight to my bank and they have the info and state that they have not done this and that the casino is lying. Now the funds had been put back into the casino account and I was asked to re submit info for another bank account to try. And now all the whole amount has been played through.. this casino is dodgy. And my bank states that its not a very good situation and they are escalating as they are lying about my bank. They have the evidence and now all the funds have been played through on games which is very actually not the case. Why would I go and play the whole amount through straight up if I had escalated with you guys. And also my bank. They have every piece of evidence and also the email etc they state down in writing that my bank is blocking etc and they are actually lying. Its disgusting. They also blocked my email address from even contacting them. I put my money into this casino fair and square and I won. They are legitimately dodgy and not actually running a good casino. They lie and also clearly doing the wrong by consumers. It shows the money being played through straight after they emailed me and said please re advise etc. Why would I go so far into this and pursue and then play the money onto games. They are actually liars and doing dodgies. Now I have 0 dollars in the account. This is not fair. What do I do now</p>
