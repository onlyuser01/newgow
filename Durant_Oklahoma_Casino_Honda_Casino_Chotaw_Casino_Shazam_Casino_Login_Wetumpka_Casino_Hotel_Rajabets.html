    <h1>Durant Oklahoma Casino Honda Casino Chotaw Casino Shazam Casino Login Wetumpka Casino Hotel Rajabets</h1>

<p>Thank you both for your replies and additional information.</p>
<p>Dear Rakeshpwr,</p>
<p>Before I ask the casino for further details/evidence, allow me to please repeat the unanswered questions and ask you a few more to clarify the situation.</p>
<p>"Can you provide us with an update? Will you create a new account with the correct personal details in accordance with the casino's instructions? If yes, can you confirm that your deposit of 4,000 INR was consequently credited to the account?</p>
<p>What was the reason you filled out a different date of birth there?</p>
<p>Are you please aware of the fact that a different date of birth makes the KYC/verification of your identity impossible, while it breaches the casino's Terms and Conditions? In addition, in such cases, players could be happy that the casino is able and willing to return their last deposit(s). "</p>
<p>Since you do not remember what exact date of birth you filled out in your disputed account (and it is one of the main personal details that identify an individual - it is not as you claimed, that only name, surname, and photos are important to complete the KYC) but you are sure about the fact that only DOB does not match with your documents, it looks that you did it on purpose, and it would be good to know the reason, which you have not provided until now.</p>
<p>So, what was the reason? And if the only way you can get your last deposit back is to register a new account with your true and genuine personal information, why you just did not do it?</p>
<p>Why is it a problem for you to register a new account with your real personal information? If you filled out only the DOB incorrectly in your disputed closed account, and you are able to verify your identity, it should not be a problem to follow the casino's instructions and gain the confiscated funds back.</p>
<p>Please note that your cooperation in resolving the issue is necessary so we are able to help you, and avoiding answering my questions will be considered dragging the process out and non-cooperation on your side. If you are not able and willing to answer my questions sufficiently and truthfully, I am afraid there is nothing we can further help you with, and it will lead to complaint closure/rejection.</p>
<p>Thank you for understanding. Looking forward to hearing the answers from you.</p>
