<p>Rivalry, an international sports betting and media company will receive $7.34 million (converted to USD) in funding through a new financing round. To that end, the company will issue up to 6,666,666 subordinate voting shares at a price of $1.10 each.</p>
<p>The funding round will be led by Pinnacle and will feature a variety of tech and payment shareholders. Rivalry will use the proceeds to speed up its operational objectives and pursue further strategic growth opportunities.</p>

The company targets mainly Millennial and Gen Z customers, who make up 97% of its users. The company’s appeal among younger audiences can be attributed to its cutting-edge esports betting products.</p>

<p>We are growing rapidly with a successful strategy in place and talented team behind us, and with this funding we anticipate both continuing our pace of growth and our trend toward profitability. Steven Salz, co-founder &amp; CEO, Rivalry</p>
<p>Speaking of Rivalry’s relationship with Pinnacle, Salz said that the latter company’s esports and risk management solutions have proven integral to the Rivalry experience. He thanked Pinnacle for its commitment to supporting the financing round, saying that it will add a layer of credibility to Rivalry’s approach.</p>
<p>Pinnacle’s chief executive officer, Paris Smith, also spoke on the matter, saying that his company is always on the lookout for partners that share its values. He said that this is exactly what led him and his team to Rivalry.</p>
<p>The company’s long-time focus on product innovation, brand equity, and next-generation consumers is disrupting traditional ways of thinking in the industry and blazing a trail for industry economics that were previously not thought possible. Paris Smith, CEO, Pinnacle</p>
