    <h1>Casino In Oklahoma Near Texas Tahoe Casino Aquarius Casino Laughlin Nevada Green Valley Ranch Resort</h1>

<p>Hi Radka,</p>
<p>Thanks for your answer! Yes I also read some threads that is why I'm trying to stay optimistic. I tried using Mastercard payment (same as my deposit) and yes I am in contact with the support. They said that there are some technical issues from the provider's side (Mastercard) and they had to lower their payment limit to 450€/transaction so the casino cancelled my withdrawal. So currently I have 3 ongoing withdrawals with ~360€ each. The frustrating thing is I started my withdrawal on 16th May, ofc there was the verification process which was accepted only on 7th July, but my withdrawal was cancelled the next day.. So I've been waiting for almost a month to receive my money which has been cancelled and re-submitted 2 days ago and it bugs my mind that I might have to wait weeks again..but as far as I know (based on their terms and cond.) after the verification of the account the finance team picks up every request within 3 business days (tho I'm scared a bit because everytime I contact the support team they are saying that there are some technical errors and a lot of requests so the process might take longer) ..</p>
<p>anyway that's the long story short, I've already written several emails and contacted them via live chat, we'll see I guess..</p>
