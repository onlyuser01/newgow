<p>Nashville SC welcomes DC United at Geodis Park on Saturday, July 1. This is going to be the third time these two meet in Nashville, with both of their previous duels being won by the hosts</p>
<p>After two straight losses, Nashville SC is looking for a win on its turf against DC United. Oddsmakers see the hosts as odds-on favorites, but we call for caution. The reason is that Wayne Rooneyâ€™s team is a real giant slayer in 2023.</p>

<p>Nashville Ready to Get Back to the Winning Track</p>
<p>Nashville SC lost its previous two MLS games â€“ to CF Montreal (1-0) and Columbus Crew (2-0) â€“ but this doesnâ€™t actually mean theyâ€™re in horrible form. The thing is that they were the away side in both of those games. Further, their opponents are playing fantastic soccer lately.</p>
<p>Still, the main reason why they lost those games is that a couple of their first-team players were out due to international duties â€“ Jacob Shaffelburg, Fafa Picault, and Anibal Godoy.</p>
<p>Nashville SCâ€™s Jacob Shaffelburg has been called up by Canada ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ to their Gold Cup roster. Nashville will be without he and FafÃ  Picault ðŸ‡­ðŸ‡¹, who have been absolutely crucial pieces of their attack this season. #EveryoneN pic.twitter.com/S71eJ4vRKX â€” Ben Wright (@benwright) June 19, 2023</p>
<p>These three will miss Saturdayâ€™s game as well, but thereâ€™s some good news for Nashville SC fans ahead of the DC United duel. For example, the game is played at Geodis Park in Nashville, which is where these guys have been sensational in 2023. Theyâ€™re 7-2-1 at home this season, with a score differential of 19-6.</p>
<p>The most impressive fact, however, is that theyâ€™re without a loss on home tour since March and have a 5-0-0 record in their last five MLS games played in Tennessee.</p>
<p>DC Unitedâ€™s Players Love Being Underdogs</p>
<p>DC United is 7-5-8 this season, which puts Wayne Rooneyâ€™s men in the No. 9 position in the Eastern Conference. Thatâ€™s not too bad, but it couldâ€™ve been better if they didnâ€™t drop too many points against teams fairly weaker than them.</p>
<p>They havenâ€™t been great against underdogs, but theyâ€™ve been brilliant against favorites. In their most recent game, the men from the capital defeated FC Cincinnati, the team with the most points in the 2023 MLS. DC United won the game 3-0. This season, Rooneyâ€™s boys also defeated LA Galaxy, Orlando City, Charlotte, and CF Montreal (twice).</p>
<p>Nashville SC vs. DC United Prediction</p>
<p>These two have already met once in 2023, and the game finished in a 1-1 draw. We think itâ€™s very likely something similar is going to happen on July 1. Our Nashville vs. DC United prediction is that the game will finish in a tie, probably with not too many goals.</p>
<p>Picks: Nashville vs. DC United â€“ draw; under 2.5 goals</p>
