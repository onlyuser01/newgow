    <h1>Casino Online Pa Red Dog Casino Login Fandango Casino Avi Resort Casino Laughlin Nv Wind River Casin</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Here's my problem:</p>
<p>I have been playing on spinsbro off and on for quite some time now.</p>
<p>I recently won a substantial amount of money for the first time and successfully verified my account.</p>
<p>I requested my first three withdrawals a few days ago.</p>
<p>I continued to play with the remaining funds in my account, focusing on Slots and Live Casino.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I decided to try a small bonus hunt. I played down from the leftover 2800€</p>
<p>to 2300€ and was able to secure free spins on four PlayNGo games. My plan was to open all the games and play the free spins.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there was a problem: the previous gaming session that was supposed to kick off the free spins was missing. Meaning, the free spins and the betting money were gone.</p>
<p>Understanding that technical errors can happen, I contacted their support asking for a check so that the game session I was in would be restored.</p>
<p>Email support promptly responded by temporarily deactivating my account to check into the issue.</p>
<p>I requested that they inform me once the issue was resolved.</p>
<p>About an hour ago, I asked for a brief update. What came next was the shocker and the reason I am lodging this complaint:</p>
<hr />
<p>Dear player!</p>
<p>Your account was closed by decision of the administration without the right to recovery for violations of our casino rules.</p>
<p>According to our Terms and Conditions:</p>
<p>13.4.1. Fraudulent practice includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>fraudulent activities related to charge-backs and rake-back;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the usage of a stolen, cloned or otherwise unauthorized credit or debit card, as a resource of funds;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the Account Holder`s collusion with other users for getting an unfair advantage (including through bonus schemes or similar incentives offered by us);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>trying to use false or misleading information in registration of account;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>any illegal in any applicable jurisdiction act, which you have done or tried to do. Fraudulent practice also includes unfaith acts or those, which were made in order to defraud us and to circumvent any contractual or legal restrictions (whether such act actually causes us any damage/harm or not).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>13.5. In case a bonus has been claimed, it is forbidden to practice the "Bonus Hunt" (open all the free spins accumulated on the different games at the same time) after the balance has fallen below €0.50 (or equivalent in other currencies )</p>
<p>Best regards</p>
<p>Support Team SpinsBro Casino</p>
<hr />
<p>I am certain I did not violate any of these terms; I didn't even have an active bonus. All the money I played with was real cash!</p>
<p>I merely wanted to report the problem and get my lost free spins back.</p>
<p>Now, they have simply closed my gaming account with around 4000€ in it, citing some terms and conditions that do not apply to me whatsoever.</p>
<p>I ask for your help. I have already informed my lawyer, but I hope we can find a solution together.</p>
<p>Best regards</p>
