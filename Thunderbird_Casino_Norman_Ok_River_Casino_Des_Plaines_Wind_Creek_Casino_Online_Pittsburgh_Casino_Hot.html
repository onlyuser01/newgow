<p>Yggdrasil and Bang Bang Games continue their lucrative partnership for the launch of Pharaoh’s Gaze DoubleMax, a new slot with free spins and wilds</p>
<p>The leading publisher with a goal to speed up innovation in the iGaming world has once again reunited with the London-based boutique slots studio for the release of a fresh slot expected to be well received by fans of the genre.</p>
<p>Last year, the two companies joined hands for the launch of a series of additional slots, including Retro Slot Jokrz Wild ULTRANUDGE in May, Jekyllz Wild Ultranudge in October, or Rainbow Power Potz Ultranudge in December, to name just a few.</p>

<p>Bang Bang Games, “Absolutely Delighted” About the Release</p>
<p>Pharaoh’s Gaze DoubleMax is an Egyptian-themed slot that counts five reels and 20 paylines. It is packed with mystery and it encompasses several interesting game features that considerably boost its winning potential. Among them, DoubleMax, which is Yggdrasil’s exciting Game Engagement Mechanic (GEM).</p>
<p>Speaking about the new release, Bang Bang Games’ managing director Frank McPolin first commented on the undeniable popularity of the Egyptian-themed slot genre that continues to attract large numbers of players worldwide. McPolin then went on to express their delight at being able to cater to the needs of these very fans with the new game that incorporates “one of Yggdrasil’s best-performing GEMs.”</p>
<p>The game with a maximum win of up to 15,000x the stake allows players to take advantage of the Scarab Free Spins feature, the Pharaoh’s Gaze Wild symbols, or the DoubleMax feature to make sure they collect as many coins as possible.</p>
<p>Scarab Free Spins, Bonus Boost &amp; DoubleMax Features</p>
<p>When players land a minimum of three scatters on any position on the reels, they automatically engage the Scarab Free Spins feature. The latter awards players seven Free Spins along with an initial gem boost that will not cause the DoubleMax multiplier to reset.</p>
<p>The Bonus Boost feature can add 25% extra to players’ total bets, thus doubling the odds of activating the Scarab Free Spins. Players who are in a hurry to start enjoying the free spins can opt for the Bonus Buy as long as they are willing to pay 100x the bet. The Bonus Buy option is only available in certain jurisdictions.</p>
<p>The DoubleMax feature works by doubling the value of a win multiplier after each new winning spin. The winning symbols are then seen disappearing from the reels, with a wild symbol replacing them to trigger fresh wins.</p>
<p>To engage the Pharaoh’s Gaze Wilds feature, players need to wait for the landing symbols on the reels to also reveal a gem shortly after. When players collect a minimum of three gems, the special feature is triggered. Next, they are rewarded with one up to three extra Wild symbols for the upcoming three spins or cascades.</p>
<p>Also commenting on the new release, Yggdrasil’s head of product and programs Stuart McCarthy expressed their pride regarding the use of the DoubleMax feature in the new “crowd-pleasing title developed by the team at Bang Bang Games.”</p>
