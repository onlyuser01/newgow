    <h1>Real Money Online Casinos No Deposit Bonus Codes Coeur D Alene Resort Casino Casino Gift Cards Twin</h1>

<p>Dear Klausscrf and Casino Guru team,</p>
<p>We would like to shed light on the situation that has occurred.</p>
<p>The player contacted us with a request to return the money he spent in the casino. He provided us with information that he had an account in our casino with the other email address earlier. The player informed that he forgot about the creation of the first account because he has no more access to that email address and has accounts in more than 500 casinos. We understand him but based on this we can not hold the responsibility for the creation of the new account with the new email address by the player.</p>
<p>Upon registration process the player agreed and should have read all the rules of the casino, it is stated in paragraph 1.General https://prnt.sc/zbp7uf: "By registering a Player Account with the website you confirm your consent with the Terms and Conditions.". The rules had to be read before registration.</p>
<p>By creating a new account the player did not follow the rule: "Each player can create only one (1) personal account". This rule also can be checked in the Terms and Conditions of our site.</p>
<p>Considering all of the above, we believe that the complaint that we allowed the player to create a new account is unfounded since it was only his decision - to create a new account using the new registration data no matter why.</p>
<p>Continuing the conversation about the first player's profile, we would like to inform you that the first account was closed long before the player created the second account.</p>
<p>The player's request to close the first account permanently was successfully fulfilled, but the player did not mention gambling addiction when requesting to close it. We asked the player to provide any proof that he informed us about the gambling addiction while the closure of the first account but he couldn't because he has no more access to the old email address. As the player claims - he has no access to the email address of the first account and he absolutely forgot about the account creation but then he still tries to use it in order to enter the account in the casino.</p>
<p>The first time the player provided information regarding problems with gambling was the letter he sent us with the request to return the funds he spent in the casino. Our reaction is always fast in such situations so the player's account was closed immediately. Moreover, due to the fact that the player informed us about the second account - it was also marked in order to protect the player.</p>
<p>Also, we want to add that by registering on the site the player has agreed with the information from paragraph 8. Disclaimer of Liabilities: "By accepting these Terms and Conditions you confirm your awareness of the fact that gambling may lead to losing money. The Casino is not liable for any possible financial damage arising from your use of the Website."</p>
<p>The player had to be acquainted with the terms of the casino and due to the fact that he is an experienced player, he knows the risks of online gambling. Now the player wants to use the impossibility to prevent the creation of the new account using the new information in order to return the funds he lost in the casino.</p>
<p>Taking into account all the information above, we consider the player's complaint and demands to return the money lost in the casino to him unreasonable. The proper departments were involved in the detailed investigation. In the course of the investigation, all of the above facts were considered and it was decided that there are no grounds for making a refund since the decisions to create the account, make deposits, and play were made by the player himself.</p>
<p>Kind Regards,</p>
<p>KatsuBet Casino Team</p>
