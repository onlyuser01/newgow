    <h1>Crystal Bay Casino Salary For Casino Dealer Casino Newburgh Ny Casino West Memphis Arkansas Borgata</h1>

<p>Dear Lars,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. Before we’ll contact the casino and ask for their standpoint, could you please forward emails or screenshots showing that you have sent requests for your account’s closure. My email address is petronela.k@casino.guru. Did you specify in those requests for how long you wish your account to be closed and why?</p>
<p>I have checked Responsible Gaming section on the website, and this is what I found https://www.interwetten.com/en/content/common/responsiblegaming:</p>
<p>„Self-exclusion as a Preventive Tool</p>
<p>Customers who opt for definite or indefinite self-exclusion are no longer able to access real money games for the term of their exclusion.</p>
<p>If you opt for a definite self-exclusion, you will exclude yourself from all gaming activities for a definite term that you may define individually (e.g. a day, a week or a month). Your account will be blocked until the deadline is reached. Once the term has expired, your account will be automatically available again.</p>
<p>If you opt for indefinite self-exclusion, your account will remain blocked until further notice and any balances on your gaming account will be paid out.</p>
<p>In both cases, you may apply for a re-activation of your account at any time, but re-opening will always be subject to a "cooling-off" period. The delay for the re-opening of a definite self-exclusion amounts to 24 hours as from request. An indefinite self-exclusion will only be reversed 7 days after the player’s request. Any application for account re-opening will also be subject to our internal assessment of the player’s gaming behavior and may be refused."</p>
<p>Is this the email address that you have sent your email to?</p>
<p>service.de@interwetten.com</p>
<p>I hope we will be able to help you to resolve this issue as soon as possible. Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
