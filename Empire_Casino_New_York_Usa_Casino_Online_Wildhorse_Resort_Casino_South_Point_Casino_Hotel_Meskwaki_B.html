<p>Information about Zimpler casinos</p>
<p>Zimpler is a Swedish payment provider that acts as a mobile intermediary between customers and merchants. Users simply enter their mobile number to receive a code that allows them to quickly create an account: Zimpler then acts as the link between their bank account and a range of websites.</p>
<p>Many online casinos support Zimpler as a payment method and players can quickly make deposits this way. Given its focus on mobile payments, it’s also very easy to use Zimpler in mobile casinos that support it.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for safe Zimpler online casinos, then this page is designed to help you. You can also learn about Zimpler as a company here, along with the positives and negatives of their service, and also which Zimpler casinos offer bonuses.</p>

<p>Zimpler: A fast-growing fintech startup with an emphasis on fairness</p>
<p>Zimpler was formed in Stockholm by two entrepreneurs in 2012. Originally marketed as a mobile invoice solution called 'PugglePay', the startup honed its service into an instant payment provider by 2016 and rebranded itself as 'Zimpler'.</p>
<p>Starting out in a small office, it quickly gained a reputation as a fast-growing fintech company, expanding into multiple markets across Europe with their Bank Payments product and Zimpler Go — a Know-Your-Customer payment solution for merchants.</p>
<p>The company bases its philosophy around the Swedish word 'schysstare', roughly translated as 'fairer', and their service has been very well-received: they won awards from the Deloitte Fast 50 two years in a row as a result.</p>
<p>Zimpler are currently supervised by Finansinspektionen, Sweden's financial supervisory authority, and enjoy a Licensed Payment Institution Status because of this.</p>
<p>The pros and cons of Zimpler</p>
<p>The great thing about Zimpler is its super-simple setup. You give them your mobile number, they give you a verification code and, hey presto, you have an account with them.</p>
<p>Note: The whole process takes a few minutes and requires no download whatsoever, you simply access it via your browser. It is also compatible with a wide range of major card providers, like Visa and Mastercard.</p>
<p>The company bases its service on speed, a big thing in today's world where users tend to want things done in seconds. Transfer times are super low, if not instant, and if there are any delays then you can contact Zimpler's highly-rated customer service team via several social media platforms, phone or email. You can also email them to set a spending limit on your account, which is useful if you have trouble keeping track of your outgoings.</p>
<p>On the downside, some people may not like the fact that Zimpler doesn't have an app. Apps are an important part of fintech banking these days, as they allow users to track their spending easily, so not having one puts the startup at a disadvantage.</p>
<p>Also, Zimpler might not be free of charge. Depending on where you are, you may be charged a small fee for each deposit or withdrawal, the amount of which may vary according to the amount involved.</p>
<p>Note: Zimpler is not available on the USA market, which rules out a huge number of potential users. In Europe, the participating countries are the UK, France, Germany, Finland, and the firm's native Sweden.</p>

<p>Casino withdrawals via Zimpler, while possible, aren't supported by all casinos. It's possible that you'll have to use another method to get your money.</p>
