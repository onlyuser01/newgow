<p>Mighty Hammer is one of Zitro's most popular games. The game promises exceptional experiences thanks to 4-levels of Jackpots and three different bonus link: Bonus link, Bonus Jewels and Bonus Thunder.

Finally, Aníbal-Álvarez said that Zitro is expecting the "ongoing collaboration between both companies to always deliver maximum innovation."</p>
