<p>Hi I open account in Gama Casino because I saw the positive ratings on Guru!! So let me begin: I deposit 2-3 times via Jeton , I win a little bit and I wanted to withdraw my money ! I successfully verify my account and I made a withdrawal request! First my withdrawal was denied no reason given!! I contact the support and they told me to make a new withdrawal request and I did strange second time my withdrawal was processed but the money were back to my account!! I contact the support and they told me that they send my money to my Jeton wallet but Jeton have some technical issues and Jeton send the money back to casino! I immediately contact the Jeton wallet support and they told me that that’s not true!! They don’t have any technical issues and nobody send a money to my wallet account! So the casino lie to me! I will send you a print screen from my conversation with Jeton! Then I contacted the support again and i told them what the Jeton told me and i send the print screen from our conversation!! So I didn’t get any response about why the lie to me and I was told to make a new request a will be processed as fast a possible .. just to mention that casino therms and conditions is : all withdrawals will be processed within 24 hours but they aim in 2 hours!! Never mind i waited the 24 hours time frame and nothing happens my withdrawal request is still not processed!! I contact the support again and it was the same support agent how lie to me about Jeton having technical issues and the respond to me like this ( this is a copy paste for conversation) :Eric09:05:16 am Blazhe, Your withdrawal request, is now under approval, as you have been spotted fraudulent activity.</p>
