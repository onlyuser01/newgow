<p>Developer of casino content, technology and services Spinomenal announced today it has re-launched the Grand Holidays Tournament and will offer players a chance of winning not only cash but NFT collectible prizes.</p>
<p>Reinvigorated Grand Holidays Tournament</p>
<p>The re-launch of Spinomenal’s hugely popular Grand Holidays Tournament will feature several NFT mini rounds that will be activated at different tournament stages to enable players to win an NFT character, on top of the stab at the mammoth €500,000 ($510,000) tournament prize pool.</p>
<p>“Grand Holidays Tournament is back with a bang,” commented Nir Rohen, chief operating officer at Spinomenal, outlining that the content developer has expanded the prize pool and “the sheer number of extra winning elements.”</p>
<p>The availability of NFT prizes is not new to Spinomenal following the developer’s collaboration with NFT specialist Aplica Media which saw the launch of the first-ever NFT slot tournament, Royal Sharx, in June.</p>
<p>Players of the tournament will be pleasantly surprised with the improved tournament tools and the full activities package of the tournament that is available in over 150 games and offers multiple gamification elements each of which serves to elevate the player experience.</p>
<p>Retention Power Is Key</p>
<p>Rohen was also convinced that the Grand Holiday Tournament would be well embraced by the players, emphasizing the tournament’s power to keep players engaged from the very beginning until the end.</p>
<p>“Its retention power is second-to-none as players are fully engaged from the off and we cannot wait for it all to begin today,” he concluded.</p>
<p>Spinomenal made sure to bring a fresh look to the play by introducing a unique theme for each of the 19 rounds of the tournament. Players can claim credit points during each round and convert them into score points for the final round while keeping track of their progress. Task completions and point boosts made during Rush Hours will greatly contribute to enhancing their leaderboard position.</p>
<p>Also in June, Spinomenal further strengthened the presence of its online gaming content by signing a content distribution deal with Groove, an iGaming aggregation platform featuring over 5,000 titles from more than 60 suppliers worldwide.</p>
<p>Last month, Spinomenal joined the growing portfolio of online casino content providers of Belgian casino site betFIRST to enhance the betFIRST Casino product offering with popular Spinomenal titles such as Joker Madness, Beer n’ Dice and Wildfire Fruits Dice.</p>
