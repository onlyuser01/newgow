    <h1>Casino In Santa Rosa Aquarius Casino Resort Laughlin Nv Gambling Casino Doubledown Casino On Faceboo</h1>

<p>Dear denilson781,</p>
<p>After a careful review of the evidence provided by the casino, I am afraid I am no longer able to pursue this case. There is sufficient evidence of multiple accounts created by you within the company's casino network where in some accounts you have just amended some information in an attempt to trick the system that's why you have failed the KYC process.</p>
<p>As mentioned in the casinos T&amp;Cs under Withdrawal policy:</p>
<ol>
<li>WITHDRAWAL POLICY</li>
</ol>
<p>12.2 The Casino reserves the right to check your identity prior to processing payouts and to hold any refund or withdrawals for the time needed to check your identity. In case you provide false or incomplete Personal Data, the withdrawal can be refused and the Player Account terminated, of which you will be informed by email.</p>
<p>And 10. ANTI-FRAUD POLICY</p>
<p>10.2 The Casino has zero tolerance to advantage play. Any player who will try to gain advantage of casino welcome offers or other promotions agrees that Company reserves the right to void bonuses and any winnings from such bonuses, for the reasons of:</p>
<p>creating more than one account in order to get advantage from casino promotions;</p>
<p>providing incorrect registration data;</p>
<p>providing of forged documents;</p>
<p>any other actions which may damage the Casino;</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, I will not be able to help you with this and this complaint will now be rejected. Casinos have a very strict policy regarding multiple account cases that have been used in this way.</p>
<p>I can only advise you to create only one account and use only your own valid personal details.</p>
<p>I wish I could have been of more help. Please do not hesitate to contact us if you run into any issues with this or any other casino in the future.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Michal</p>
