    <h1>Online Sweepstakes Casino Fun Club Casino 300 No Deposit Bonus Hard Rock Casino Orlando Las Vegas Ca</h1>

<p>When I tried to view my results of the "Reward Machine," it shows only 2 trophies instead of 3. The casino did not state that there was an error, instead I was given the following information:</p>
<p>Chat Transferred From: FanDuel Coach To: Monique at FanDuel Group</p>
<p>(19m 56s) Monique at FanDuel Group: Hi, Thank you for contacting FanDuel Support. Please give me a moment to review your request.</p>
<p>(20m 12s) Kristen: Hi</p>
<p>(20m 12s) Monique at FanDuel Group: Thank you for your patience, Kristen. I hope you are doing well! May I have more details on why you contacted us today?</p>
<p>(21m 2s) Kristen: On the Reward Machie daily game, I got 3 Trophies but no bonus up to $2000.</p>
<p>(22m 19s) Monique at FanDuel Group: Thank you for that information. May I have a few moments to review your account?</p>
<p>(22m 33s) Kristen: Yes</p>
<p>(24m 49s) Monique at FanDuel Group: Thank you for your patience. Upon checking, I see there were two bonuses applied to the account in the amount of 0.75 cents.</p>
<p>(25m 28s) Kristen: I thought that was for the cherries. It said if you get 3 Trophies you could get a bonus up to $2000. This is BS, that if you do get 3 trophies in the same week you could win a bigger prize NOT smaller.</p>
<p>(28m 19s) Kristen: R U still there?</p>
<p>(29m 18s) Monique at FanDuel Group: Hey there, Iâ€™m still here working on this for you. I just want to keep you updated.</p>
<p>(29m 34s) Kristen: Ok</p>
<p>(32m 19s) Monique at FanDuel Group: Thank you for your patience. Ultimately, the reward machine payout is based off a random number generator. Multiple users are using their spins throughout the day, and we have no control over who gets what payoffs. When receiving 3 trophies weekly or instantly, it can be up to $2000.00, but not guaranteed $2000. Unfortunately, we do not have a way to alter any user's payouts for any reward machine bonuses. The terms and conditions can be found in the banner of the Reward Machine for more information or on this link: https://casino.fanduel.com/reward-machine-info</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>
