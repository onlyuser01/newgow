<p>The leading provider of games powering operators within the online gambling industry, CT Interactive, announced its plans to present its engaging portfolio at SiGMA Europe Summit 2023, one of the most-anticipated events for the gaming industry that gathers representatives of the betting, iGaming and esports sectors. The upcoming event is scheduled to take place between November 14 and November 16, 2023. A statement released by CT Interactive reveals that it will showcase its products at Stand 1126.</p>
<p>The company's team of experts, consisting of its CEO, Lachezar Petrov, as well as its Head of Business Development EMEA, Milena Tsankarska, will participate in the upcoming exhibition. CT Interactive's Head of CRM, Kiril Kirilov, Business Development Manager EMEA, Antonio Donov, and Smilena Ilieva, CRM, will also participate in the SiGMA Europe Summit.</p>
<p>During the leading event for the iGaming and betting industry, the company will showcase two of its thrilling jackpots, Hot Luck, as well as Mystery Jackpot. The aforementioned jackpots, CT Interactive explains, are developed in a way to ensure engaging experiences. Renowned as one of the company's strong features, Hot Luck offers additional prizes and features three Mystery Interactive Jackpot levels.</p>
<p>Besides the two jackpots, CT Interactive confirmed that it will present some of its recent slot hits. Such will include TransilWinia, 5 Fruitata Wins, The Big Chili, as well as 20 Fruitata Wins, along with a range of cascading games.</p>
<p>Lachezar Petrov, CT Interactive's CEO, shared his excitement about the latest announcement. He explained: "We want to welcome all the attendees at our stand to see last-generation content that has won dozens of awards from prestigious ceremonies."</p>
<p>As a leading provider of games for the iGaming vertical, CT Interactive continues to grow the reach of its renowned titles. Only recently, the company boosted its reach in Latin America after signing a partnership with the leading betting and gaming operator, Wplay.</p>
<p>Under the terms of that partnership, the company agreed to supply its portfolio of games, strengthening the offering of the operator in the region. While this deal helped propel the reach of CT Interactive's thrilling games, it also provided unique titles for Wplay's growing customer base.</p>
<p>Before that, earlier this month, CT Interactive agreed to supply its games to BRAZINO 777, a popular operator within the online gambling sector in Belarus. Per that deal, the company strengthened its European footprint and reached new customers.</p>
