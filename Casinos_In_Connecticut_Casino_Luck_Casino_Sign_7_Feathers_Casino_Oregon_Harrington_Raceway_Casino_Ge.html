<p>Grupo Caliente has extended its partnership with Genius Sports to include live streaming options and live data.</p>
<p>Genius Sports and Grupo Caliente</p>
<p>Mexican betting operator Grupo Caliente has expanded its existing ties with Genius Sports, tapping into the latter’s official live data feed and streaming content to enhance the in-play and pre-match betting experience.</p>
<p>Genius is teaming up with Caliente.mx and will provide the operator with streaming products as well as its LiveData and LiveTrading solutions. To make the offer worthwhile, Genius is bringing live data from over 400 different competitions, giving spectators an insight into sporting contests.</p>
<p>Overall, Caliente will gain access to more than 170,000 fixtures every year and offer consumers some 20,000 live streams, covering global games and events. Specifically, Caliente will focus on the domestic market with Liga MX, but also cover some of the strongest soccer competitions in the world including the rebranded Premier League, Serie A in Italy, and other competitive events, beyond soccer.</p>
<p>Commenting on this partnership, Caliente Interactive CEO Emilio Hank expressed his confidence in the strengthened partnership, arguing that Caliente has long been a market leader and committed to providing customers and spectators with the best possible product available. He had this to add:</p>
<p>“We are excited to keep growing our content offering and to extend our long-term partnership with Genius Sports, as we continue to expand into other markets.” -Caliente Interactive CEO Emilio Hank</p>
<p>Latin America has been an important market for Genius Sports as well. Group head of commercial for LatAm, Fernando Martinez, said that Groupe Caliente was an established brand name and a logical partner for Genius.</p>
<p>Long-Term Benefits Evident</p>
<p>There is a value in teaming up with Caliente in the long-term, Martinez noted, and the partnership can benefit both players as well as bolster Caliente’s “future profitability.” He also had this to say about live betting:</p>
<p>“With in-game betting in Mexico rapidly rising, expanding its content will ensure they can stay ahead of the game.” -Genius Sports head of commercial for LatAm, Fernando Martinez</p>
<p>Group Caliente is part of a thriving market that is only set to develop further. Mexico’s sports betting ecosystem has not reached its full potential and interest from US and international brands is only going to intensify in the coming years.</p>
<p>The country recently broached the debate about the casino licensing process and changes to the regulatory framework continue.</p>
