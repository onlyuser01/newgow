    <h1>Hard Rock Hotel Casino Lake Tahoe Downtown Grand Hotel And Casino Angel Of The Wind Casino New Mexic</h1>

<p>Dear Michal,</p>
<p>We have reviewed in detail the complaint of the player evasilva4461.</p>
<p>We provide details about the player's account</p>
<p>1)Player deposited game account from astropay (10000ARS) and once from USDT wallet(4713ARS).</p>
<p>2) Player evasilva4461 2023-05-09 has applied for the withdrawal of funds to USDT wallet 11383 ARS.</p>
<p>On 2023-05-10, an additional verification was initiated on player evasilva4461 account based on suspicious activity on the player's account.</p>
<p>The additional check was initiated according to the rule item:</p>
<p>2.4.1 The finance department may postpone processing a withdrawal request due to additional verification.</p>
<p>2023-05-10 having studied the entire history of the client Risk Department found the following:</p>
<p>According to the regulations of our casino for the withdrawal of funds, the client must make x3 of the deposit amount to be able to withdraw funds.</p>
<p>1) All deposits of player evasilva4461 were won in games Roulette Matrix Games with the maximum possibility of the return of bets. (all betting actions were made intentionally to make the deposit turnover x3 according to the rules of our casino), the difference in bets and losses or winnings did not exceed 10-15% of the balance of the client, and more than 95% of customer bets were made in this way.</p>
<p>2) The player evasilva4461 made a deposit with a prepaid card, but he requested the withdrawal of funds to a crypto-purse.</p>
<p>We have every reason to claim a violation of AML policy, in flagrant violation of project rules.</p>
<p>Based on these findings, the Casino Risk Department ruled that the player purposefully carried out all the actions to launder funds.</p>
<p>According to the rules of our casino:</p>
<ol>
<li>Casino reserves the right to monitor all transactions with a view to prevent money laundering. Furthermore, Casino reserves the right to examine with special attention, and to the extent possible, the background and purpose of any complex or large transactions and any transactions which are particularly likely, by their nature, to be related to money laundering.</li>
</ol>
<p>Betting activity will be monitored for irregular patterns.</p>
<p>On 2023-05-10, player evasilva4461 account was closed without the right of the opening and the balance was canceled, due to violations of our casino rules:</p>
<p>14.6. In that case, if we should close your account because of collusion, cheating, fraud, money laundering, other criminal activities, or breaching of the Terms of Use, which damaged us or any other third party, the balance of Your Account will be non-refundable and deemed to be forfeited.</p>
<p>2023-05-10 An email with detailed information about the reason for account closing was sent to the player's e-mail evasilva4461@gmail.com</p>
<p>As you can see all actions in relation to the player's account were performed strictly within the rules of our casino, which are publicly available and are not hidden from anyone.</p>
<p>Best regards.</p>
<p>Smokace Casino Risk Department.</p>
