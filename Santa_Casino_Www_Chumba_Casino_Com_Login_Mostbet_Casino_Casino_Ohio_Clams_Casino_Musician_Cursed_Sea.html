<p>Cursed Seas review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Cursed Seas is a pirate-themed slot game from the team at Hacksaw Gaming. The slot takes you out onto treacherous waters, where you will join a doomed captain as he battles the Kraken and attempts to get his hands on some of its treasures.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>Other than perhaps Nolimit City, nobody does dark and brooding slot games quite like Hacksaw Gaming. The slot takes place out on the high seas, with water bashing against the reels. The design here is really nice, with the background almost looking like an old painting. A pirate ship just off to the right of the reels looks fantastic, and the character design on the reels follows that trend.</p>
<p>It has a similar vibe to other Hacksaw Gaming slots like Hand of Anubis and Wanted Dead or a Wild, but it arguably looks better than both of them. This is one of Hacksaw’s most visually stunning titles.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Cursed Seas looks terrifying, but the gameplay is actually nice and simple. The game uses a 5x4 grid, with 26 paylines active on every spin.</p>
<p>You will find the spin button, alongside the option to change your stake and set the game to autospin, on the control panel under the reels. There is also a turbo-play feature, though this may not be available in all locations.</p>

<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>Hacksaw Gaming has taken a look inside its box of tricks to provide a good selection of Cursed Seas bonus features.</p>
<p>The first bonus is the Cursed Chests. These can land on any spin, and when they land, they create a Cursed Area from their position all the way to the top of the reels. This occurs if there is a winning combination in the Cursed Area. The box will also reveal a multiplier of between x2 and x200. All winning paylines that include a symbol in the Cursed Area will have that multiplier applied.</p>
<p>The next symbol you will want to look out for is the Lantern Scatters. Landing three of these will trigger the bonus round with 10 free spins. During the bonus, any Cursed Chests that land will open and create a Cursed Area that then persists on the reels. The area will grow if another Cursed Chest lands. A total multiplier is displayed above the reels, with all multipliers from Cursed Chests being added. During the round, two, three, or four Scatters add an extra two, four, or six spins.</p>
<p>If you land four of the Lantern Scatters, you will go to the Dead Men Tell No Tales bonus game. For this, players get just three spins, though these will refill every time a symbol lands. There are only Skull and Kraken symbols available on the reels. There are two types of Skulls – Cursed and Tormented.</p>
<p>Above each reel, there is a multiplier that starts at x1. Cursed Skulls will add their multiplier value to this and then create a Cursed Area on their respective reels, which persists until the end of the round. The Tormented Skull reveals a multiplier of between x2 and x25, and it multiplies the multiplier above the reel by this.</p>
<p>The Kraken can have a multiplier between x1 and x500, and when it lands, it will be added to each reel. At the end of the round, all cursed positions have the multiplier from their reels added and paid out.</p>
<p>Depending on your location, you may be able to buy your way into each of the bonus rounds for a predetermined amount.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>Cursed Seas has a similar maths model to ones seen in other Hacksaw Gaming slots like Stormforged. It has an RTP of 96.21%, putting it above average, and has a maximum win of 12,500x your stake. The slot is considered highly volatile, which means it is recommended by our slot strategy guide.</p>
<p>The game allows for minimum bets of $0.10 and a maximum of $100. This should accommodate players on most budgets.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Hacksaw Gaming is a master when it comes to delivering slots with intense themes and highly volatile and fun gameplay. Once you get the bonus rounds rolling, there is plenty of fun to be had with Cursed Seas, and a 12,500x maximum win sweetens the deal. With a good RTP, great bonuses, and an excellent design, we are more than happy to recommend Cursed Seas.</p>
