    <h1>Bicycle Casino Fairgo Casino Login Prism Casino Login Casino In Eagle Pass Cherokee Casino Oklahoma</h1>

<p>We've thoroughly reviewed InstantBingo Casino and gave it a Very low Safety Index, which means we don't consider it a safe casino to play at. In our review, we've considered the casino's player complaints, estimated revenues, license, games genuineness, customer support quality, fairness of terms and conditions, withdrawal and win limits, and other factors. Because InstantBingo Casino is related to other online casinos listed below, its rating is also influenced by them. So, if you were ever wondering whether this casino is safe and legit or a scam, read the full review below to learn more.</p>
<p>According to our research and estimates, InstantBingo Casino is a smaller online casino revenue-wise. It's part of a group of related casinos. However, this group is still quite small even when evaluated as a whole. The revenue of a casino is an important factor, as bigger casinos shouldn't have any issues paying out big wins, while smaller casinos could potentially struggle if you manage to win really big.</p>
<p>We currently have 0 complaints directly about this casino in our database, as well as 24 complaints about other casinos related to it. Because of these complaints, we've given this casino 239 black points in total, out of which 239 come from related casinos. You can find more information about all of the complaints and black points in the 'Safety Index explained' part of this review.</p>
<p>InstantBingo Casino appears on only one blacklist, which hasn't influenced our rating of this casino. We've chosen to ignore it either because it's related to the casino's previous owner, or because of some other applicable reason.</p>
<p>InstantBingo Casino has an extremely low withdrawal limit of $500 per month. If you manage to win a bigger amount, you will struggle to withdraw your money all at once and it might take you several months or years to actually get all of it. If you plan to play medium to high stakes, we strongly advise you to look for a casino with a higher withdrawal limit or ideally without a limit altogether.</p>
<p>Based on the information we've collected and assessed in our InstantBingo Casino review, it has a Very low Safety Index. We don't recommend playing at it and strongly advise you to stay away from it.</p>
