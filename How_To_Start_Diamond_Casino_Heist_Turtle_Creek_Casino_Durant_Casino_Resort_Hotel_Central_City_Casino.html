    <h1>How To Start Diamond Casino Heist Turtle Creek Casino Durant Casino Resort Hotel Central City Casino</h1>

<p>Thank you for the response and evidence, Nick / Captain Jack Casino,</p>
<p>Dear jesseraecuster,</p>
<p>I can agree with you that ideally the casino system should automatically not let you claim multiple no-deposit bonuses when there was no real money deposit between them, but we know from experience that not all casinos are able to set their own system like this yet. It is strongly advisable to read and understand all the casino rules before any bonus is claimed.</p>
<p>Captain Jack Casino has this mentioned in its T&amp;Cs</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Players cannot redeem multiple free bonuses consecutively. If you have redeemed one No Deposit Bonus and are subsequently offered another one, a real-money deposit needs to have been made in the interim for you to be eligible to withdrawal the second No Deposit Bonus.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the event that a Player redeems a no-deposit promotional offer that he/she is not entitled to, any winnings generated from that promotion will be voided.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Furthermore, it's worth mentioning that the casino's live chat support may not consistently have access to your entire bonus history. Checks related to claimed bonuses and other verifications are only triggered following a withdrawal request. Therefore, it is only at that point that the relevant casino team determines whether any breaches of the terms have occurred.</p>
<p>I understand that from a user experience point of view, your situation is not ideal, however, the casino team has acted within its established rules, so we can't disagree with their actions.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, after gathering all the necessary information and evidence, we are forced to reject this complaint. I can only recommend that you read the bonus T&amp;Cs thoroughly before you activate any bonuses and make sure to follow all the rules to avoid disappointments like this. Sorry, we were not able to help you with this one, but please do not hesitate to contact us in the future if you run into any issues with this or any other casino, and we will try our best to help.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Michal</p>
