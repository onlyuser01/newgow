    <h1>Tulalip Resort And Casino Red Rocks Casino Las Vegas Casino Outfit Cast From Casino Hard Rock Casino</h1>

<p>The famous gambling and hospitality giant is dipping a toe in Canada through its upcoming project in Ottawa, slated to become a new tourist hub</p>
<p>Construction of the Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino has already begun and the property is due to open doors for guests early in 2025, taking over the Rideau Carleton Casino.</p>
<p>Hard Rock Casino Begins to Work on Its Hotel and Casino in Ottawa</p>
<p>The project marks the ambitious if somewhat tentative expansion of the company in Canada, with the hotel featuring a 150-room hotel with 22 suites, a dedicated gaming floor, and a sportsbook.</p>
<p>Guests will discover 1,500 slot machines and 40 live-action tables waiting with a high stakes gambling available on the property, including at a dedicated Baccarat room. The resort will also host the Hard Rock Live theater, which has room for 1,800 seated or 2,200 standing people.</p>
<p>The property will also feature bars, lounges, restaurants, and more, along with the Hard Rock Café and Council Oak Steakhouse, Rock Shop, and Unity Store. In a sense, Hard Rock is pulling all the stops, making sure that it brings the full company experience to Ottawa which may serve as the basis for further expansions to follow.</p>
<p>Commenting on this opportunity, Hard Rock International Chief Operating Officer Jon Lucas said:</p>
<p>We are excited to be one step closer to bringing our iconic brand and rich music history to the people of Ottawa and the surrounding region. Hard Rock International Chief Operating Officer Jon Lucas</p>
<p>Lucas similarly thanked the local partners for the company, as well as the regulators who have made it possible for Hard Rock to consider and now bring its project closer to realization.</p>
<p>The Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation and the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario have offered invaluable support and help to make sure that construction may begin in a compliant and prompt manner.</p>
<p>Big Expectations for the Upcoming Project’s Economic Potential</p>
<p>This project is already touted as one of the biggest private investment developments and it will have an impact on the city’s economy, including 1,900 direct and indirect construction jobs.</p>
<p>This sentiment was reflected by Mark Sutcliffe, the city’s mayor, who said: “The new Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino represents a significant investment in the south end of our city. It will create new jobs and build on the existing attraction at Rideau Carleton Casino.”</p>
<p>The company is also committed to supporting local and Indigenous organizations through every means possible, including partnerships, sponsorships, and donations.</p>
