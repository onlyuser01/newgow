    <h1>Aquarius Casino Resort Ballys Casino Ac Best Sweepstakes Casinos Ellis Island Casino Las Vegas Casin</h1>

<p>Is there a team who could end Bayern Munichâ€™s dominance in the German Bundesliga? Right now, there seem to be (at least) six suitable candidates, one of which is Eintracht Frankfurt. The two met in Round 1 of the 2022-23 season and we saw an absolute annihilation of the boys from Frankfurt â€“ the Bavarians blew them out 6-1 on the road.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to January 28, and itâ€™s time for the second Bayern Munich vs Eintracht Frankfurt duel of the season. Knowing that Bayern arenâ€™t in such great form as at the start of the season, Eintracht have the right to hope for a good result.</p>

<p>Banged-Up Bayern Munich Looking for Their First Win in 2023</p>
<p>Bayern Munich is by far the most successful German club, with 32 domestic titles in the collection. In comparison, the second-most successful team has won just 9 league titles (1. FC Nurnberg). Whatâ€™s interesting is that Bayern won more than one-third of its titles in the 21st century. In fact, this teamâ€™s been the Bundesliga champion non-stop since 2012.</p>
<p>In seven of the last 10 Bundesliga-winning seasons, Bayernâ€™s scoring leader was Robert Lewandowski. Unfortunately for them, heâ€™s no longer in the club starting this season. To fill in the gap left by the Polish scoring maestro, Bayern decided to sign Sadio Mane. The former Liverpool forward started the new chapter of his career in top gear, but then got injured in November.</p>

<p>Mane is still sidelined and the same goes for a few other important Bayern Munich players, most notably, their captain Manuel Neuer. The German goalkeeper picked up an injury while on a skiing holiday in December, for which he wonâ€™t play any soccer until the end of the season.</p>
<p>To deal with the issue, Bayern signed Yann Sommer from Borussia Monchengladbach, but the Swiss hasnâ€™t played great soccer since moving to Allianz Arena. The result of all this is that Bayern Munich arenâ€™t as impressive as everyone thought theyâ€™d be in the 2022-23 season.</p>
<p>The reigning champs are still sitting top of the table, but there are several teams that could leapfrog them as early as February.</p>
<p>Eintracht Frankfurt Plotting Revenge for Months</p>
<p>The reigning Europa League champions have huge ambitions for the remainder of the 2022-23 season, especially in domestic soccer. Theyâ€™re currently fourth in the Bundesliga, with only five points fewer than table leaders, Bayern Munich.</p>
<p>The most impressive fact about this team is that Eintracht is without a single loss in competitive matches since October. Thatâ€™s when the Frankfurters lost to Borussia Dortmund 2-1 at home. Since then, theyâ€™ve been brilliant in practically all aspects of the game.</p>
<p>No one has been directly involved in more Bundesliga goals this season than Randal Kolo Muani ðŸ‘€#UCL pic.twitter.com/SpST9Eo4oS â€” UEFA Champions League (@ChampionsLeague) January 23, 2023</p>
<p>Their standout player has been French international Randal Kolo Muani whoâ€™s already scored 7 Bundesliga goals this season. Heâ€™s also recorded 10 assists in the German top flight, which is more than any other player in this competition.</p>
<p>This guy tends to show up in big games â€“ just think of his goal for France in the semifinal against Morocco â€“ which is why we think he might score/assist on Saturday. The big question, however, is whether his output is going to be enough to win points against Bayern Munich.</p>
<p>Bayern Munich vs Eintracht Frankfurt Prediction</p>
<p>Anything can happen in this game, but we think one thing is certain â€“ Bayern Munich vs Eintracht Frankfurt is going to be a high-scoring affair.</p>
