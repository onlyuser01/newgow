    <h1>Casinos For Real Money Wilkes Barre Casino Twin Arrows Navajo Casino Resort Resort Boulevard Flagsta</h1>

<p>Dear vincvinc1980,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. I have checked the general bonus terms and conditions, and this is what I found (unfortunately, nothing about Birthday bonus) https://www.ilucki.com/en-CA/bonus-terms-and-conditions:</p>
<p>"The maximum winnings that will be paid out resulting from a free bonus or free spins without deposit will be 50 EUR or an equivalent (*50) (even if the amount of winnings accrued by you utilizing this bonus is in excess of this amount)."</p>
<p>"20 free spins for phone verification are available for players who have made at least 1 deposit. The Wagering Requirements for winnings from 20 free spins are fifty (50). The maximum winnings that will be paid out are 20 EUR/AUD/CAD/USD/NZD or an equivalent in other currencies (*20) (even if the amount of winnings accrued by you utilizing this bonus is in excess of this amount).</p>
<p>The maximum winnings that will be paid out resulting from a Loyalty free spins will be 50 EUR or an equivalent (*50) (even if the amount of winnings accrued by you utilizing this bonus is in excess of this amount).</p>
<p>The maximum winnings that will be paid out resulting from a VIP free spins will be 100 EUR or an equivalent (*100) (even if the amount of winnings accrued by you utilizing this bonus is in excess of this amount) if not stated otherwise.</p>
<p>The maximum winnings that will be paid out resulting from the SMS promotions free spins will be 50 EUR or an equivalent (*50)(even if the amount of winnings accrued by you utilizing this bonus is in excess of this amount)."</p>
<p>I would like to emphasize, that according to our Fair Gambling Codex https://casino.guru/fair-gambling-codex-for-casinos#win-limits, we consider imposed win limit to be unfair and predator, only when it’s applied to a real money game, however, we accept bonus T&amp;Cs that restrict the maximum cash out from a bonus play, especially when it comes to No Deposit bonuses.</p>
<p>Could you please forward any relevant communication to petronela.k@casino.guru? I hope we will be able to help you to resolve this issue as soon as possible. Looking forward to hearing from you.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
