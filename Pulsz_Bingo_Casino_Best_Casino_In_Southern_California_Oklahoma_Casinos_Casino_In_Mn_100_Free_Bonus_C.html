    <h1>Pulsz Bingo Casino Best Casino In Southern California Oklahoma Casinos Casino In Mn 100 Free Bonus C</h1>

<p>In July I played and won a huge win. My win was 10000 Euros (10082). Then the casino closes my account and says they will not pay! I asked them what the problem is and they say I broke some terms and give me some generic text. I keep asking them and they don't answer or anything.</p>
<p>All they gave me was this below.</p>
<p>As we wrote to you in our previous email our Casino Administration has concluded that You have violated some of our Terms and Conditions.</p>
<p>As a result of this, your account was closed without any right to be reopened.</p>
<p>6.15: You agree that the Casino reserves the right to cancel any payments in the event of you being suspected of fraud, collusion or illegal activity or if the Casino is monitoring the account balance or the received withdrawal request. In these cases, the Casino may start and/or take part in and/or help in the investigation of the circumstances and you agree to support and aid any such investigation, your winnings and active balance have been canceled and written off.</p>
