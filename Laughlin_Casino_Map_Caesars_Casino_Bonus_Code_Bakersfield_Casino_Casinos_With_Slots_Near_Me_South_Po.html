<p>Betsafe, a B2C betting and iGaming brand owned by Betsson Group, has launched in the regulated market in Ontario, Canada. Betsson received operator and supplier licenses making the rollout of Betsafe a reality in the provincial market and ensuring that the brand can now operate in one of the most promising North American markets. Ontario is home to 40% of Canada’s population, making it one of the most populated regulated iGaming markets in North America.</p>
<p>Betsafe is the latest dedicated effort by Betsson Group to expand its presence in Ontario, something that the group has insisted on recently. Betsafe brings a variety of products that can be locally enjoyed moving forward, including both online casino and sports betting options.</p>
<p>Betsafe is powered by Strive Gaming’s platform, which is 40% owned by Betsson, the company shared in a press statement. Ontario customers may access the Betsafe brand through the dedicated brand available in the Apple Store and Google Play Store, or directly through the website at ot.betsafe.com which is the Ontario-facing domain for the operator.</p>
<p>Commenting on this opportunity, Betsson AB President and CEO Pontus Lindwall hailed the success of the recent launch and said that the group had been able to obtain the important B2C and B2B licenses in the regulated online gambling market in Ontario.</p>
<p>"We are convinced that there are great opportunities for Betsson in Ontario in both the B2C and B2B channels as we bring a highly competitive offering to the market," Lindwall added. Meanwhile, Betsson has been enjoying a number of important business developments.</p>
<p>The company formed a new content alliance with Pariplay, helping boost its own access to tier-one games. Betsson also saw a strong growth of results in the last quarter, with the World Cup helping achieve record performance, albeit with a small caveat as regular football championships were suppressed.</p>
<p>Not least, Betsson has been expanding beyond North America, with the company confirming a third license in Argentina.</p>
