<p>In light of the ongoing pandemic, JC Hospitality, owner of Virgin Hotels Las Vegas pushed the opening date of the resort to next year. The operator stressed that the health and safety of customers and employees remains a top priority.</p>
<p>JC Hospitality, owner of Virgin Hotels Las Vegas, announced that the opening date of the reimagined resort will be pushed to January 15, 2021. In a statement released on Friday, Richard “Boz” Bosworth, President and CEO of JC Hospitality, revealed that due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in Nevada and nationwide, the company decided to delay the opening date of Virgin Hotels Las Vegas.</p>
<p>He acknowledged that the construction works are going according to schedule, however, the decision was “predicated on the current conditions in the market as it pertains to the pandemic.“</p>
<p>Bosworth stressed that although the entire team of JC Hospitality is excited to introduce the reimagined resort, the safety and health of the guests, partners, and team members remains a top priority.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Bosworth encouraged everyone to follow the government-established health and safety guidelines. In conclusion, he revealed that the date is yet to be finalized and an announcement is “forthcoming”.</p>
<p>The Reimagined and Re-Conceptualized Resort</p>
<p>Virgin Hotels Las Vegas is taking the space of former Hard Rock Casino. Although the resort was initially planned to open this autumn, the opening was delayed mainly due to the pandemic.</p>
<p>Back in August, Bosworth revealed that the resort construction is going according to schedule and it is expected for the keys to be received early in November. However, even back then, he acknowledged that due to the pandemic, some delay may be expected as the ownership group needed to “re-evaluate” the opening date.</p>
<p>The re-conceptualized resort will be offering more than 1,500 hotel chambers. The 24-hour integrated casino resort will also offer plenty of food and beverage options as well as live music, events spaces, a huge pool area, and more.</p>
<p>Once open, Virgin Hotels Las Vegas will be able to accommodate some 4,500 guests. Furthermore, the new resort will be a part of Curio Collection by Hilton. In October, JC Hospitality revealed further details of the one-of-a-kind oasis pool and entertainment complex.</p>
