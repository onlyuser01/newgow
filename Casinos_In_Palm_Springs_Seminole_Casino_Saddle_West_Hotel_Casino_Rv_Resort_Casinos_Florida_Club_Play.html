<p>Dear Jorge,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m very sorry to hear about your negative experience. I have checked promotional terms, and this is what I found:</p>
<p>"The maximum bet allowed when playing with any type of bonus should be less than 20% of the value of the bonus credited and should not exceed 8 EUR, 8 USD, 8 CAD, 80 NOK (as applicable) per single bet (For example: placing a bet of 8 EUR after claiming an initial bonus of 100 EUR is allowed). Please be advised that even if a small percentage of the amount will exceed the above threshold, regardless of the outcome of that bet; or number of times; more so, one bet exceeding the maximum threshold, will be treated as a breach and will result in all winnings being voided, while any type of bonus is still active in your account."</p>
<p>If you’ve received a bonus of €2,50, then your maximum allowed bet shouldn’t be greater than €0,50.</p>
<p>We would like to see casinos implementing systems that would prevent players from placing higher than allowed bets, but, unfortunately, this is not a standard practice yet. You were not stopped or blocked when you decided to increase your bet, and, as a result, you breached the maximum bet rule.</p>
<p>Sadly, there is not much I can do to support your case at this time. I would strongly recommend reading all the T&amp;Cs carefully before you start playing to avoid any misunderstandings in the future. Casinos try to design their bonuses to be as attractive as possible, but the rules must always be followed. Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is anything else, I could do for you in this matter otherwise, I will be forced to reject your complaint. Thank you for your understanding.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
