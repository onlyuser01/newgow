<p>In the meantime, players can enjoy gaming in Caesars’ temporary gaming facility in Danville</p>
<p>American casino and hospitality giant Caesars Entertainment continues its work on its upcoming property in Danville, Virginia. Danville Register &amp; Bee, a local news outlet, inquired about the state of the project and learned that everything seems to be on track for a 2024 opening.</p>
<p>The outlet contacted Caesars Virginia’s general manager, Chris Albrecht, who provided an update on the progress his team has made. According to him, the hotel tower is under construction, with the workers currently building the third floor. In the meantime, progress is being made on the casino basement, including back-of-house areas and the loading dock. Albrecht added that several customer surface parking lots are also nearing completion.</p>
<p>The Virginia property cost Caesars $650 million and is expected to contribute $38 million in tax revenue to Danville once it launches. The property is being constructed by Whiting-Turner, which has also worked on Horseshoe Baltimore, Caesars Palace Las Vegas, and a number of other venues.</p>
<p>The new casino will sport some 1,400 slots, 85 live table games, 24 electronic table games, a WSOP room and a Caesars Sportsbook. In addition, the property will have a 500-room hotel, a 2,500-seat theater and a 40,000-square-foot convention area.</p>
<p>Albrecht said that Caesars expects to meet the 2024 deadline when it comes to opening the new casino resort. In the meantime, players can enjoy gaming in Caesars’ temporary gaming facility in Danville.</p>
<p>Danville Players Can Play at Caesars’ Temporary Casino</p>
<p>Caesars’ temporary property in the city is currently open to local customers and boasts a team of over 400 employees. It opened on May 15 and has almost 800 slot machines, 33 table games, 36 electronic table games and 12 sports betting kiosks.</p>
<p>The temporary casino team will move over to the full resort, according to Albrecht. In addition, Caesars will start posting for positions at the full resort in mid-2024, according to the manager.</p>
<p>Albrecht couldn’t confirm whether Caesars Virginia will sport the 1,300-employee team it had anticipated. In any case, the company will need a much larger team than the one managing the temporary casino.</p>
<p>Albrecht also refrained from commenting on which restaurants will be available to visitors and promised that the company will share more specifics at a later date.</p>
<p>In other news, Caesars just offered two years of IDX services to its loyalty program customers whose data got compromised during the recent cybersecurity incident.</p>
