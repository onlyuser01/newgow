<p>ESPN’s Mike Greenberg said on air Thursday morning, “You knew this match was most likely coming. It is now officially set for Thanksgiving weekend.”</p>
<p>The one-on-one showdown between the two golfing greats was first floated by Lefty himself at The Players Championship where he said he’d prefer to “bypass all the ancillary stuff of a tournament and just go head-to-head” in a “high-stakes, winner-take-all match” against Woods.</p>
<p>The specific date and the purse the two will be playing for hasn’t been confirmed. Earlier reports suggest the two will compete for a winner-take-all $10 million.</p>
<p>The Westgate SuperBook has set the odds with Woods a slight favorite at -130, and Mickelson +110. A $100 wager on Tiger nets $76.92, while the same bet on Phil returns $110.</p>
<p>Shadow Creek was built in 1989 and originally owned by Steve Wynn’s Mirage Resorts. Today, the course is owned by MGM Resorts and access is exclusive to Bellagio guests who can play the track for roughly $500.</p>
<p>Cold November Heats Up</p>
<p>November isn’t thought as a particularly exciting month for sports. Yes, NFL and college football are into the later parts of their seasons, but there are no playoffs. The MLB and World Series ended the month prior, and the NBA regular season is just getting underway.</p>
<p>In terms of golf, the FedEx Cup Playoffs concluded in September, as did the 42nd Ryder Cup.</p>
<p>With Tiger vs. Phil, sportsbooks will have the pleasure of taking bets on another golf event that could generate a sizeable handle. Woods and Mickelson have combined won 19 majors (14 Woods, five Mickelson), and 122 PGA Tour events (79 Woods, 43 Mickelson).</p>
<p>Anytime either golfing Hall of Fame member is in the field, handle and interest surges.</p>
<p>Mickelson and Gambling</p>
<p>It’s long been known that Mickelson has a strong penchant for gambling and sports betting. Stories of playing fellow PGA Tour colleagues for substantial sums of money during practice rounds (and perhaps actual tournament rounds) have circulated for many years.</p>
<p>Television commentators have even made lighthearted comments when Mickelson seems to take extra time on an otherwise seemingly unimportant putt on a Sunday despite being far out of contention.</p>
<p>Lefty’s high-stakes gambling landed him in hot water in 2014 when the US Securities and Exchange Commission began investigating his long-time Las Vegas pal Billy Walters on insider trading allegations.</p>
<p>Walters, said to be one of the most successful sports bettors in Las Vegas history, was later found guilty of using inside information provided by in indebted bettor to make millions of dollars on a stock. Mickelson also made nearly $1 million on the company after Walters provided him the tip, which Phil said he was unaware was insider information.</p>
<p>Mickelson was never charged with any wrongdoing, but forfeited his stock profits.</p>
