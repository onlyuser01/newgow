<p>Dear Darryl,</p>
<p>Thank you for contacting us. I have checked the casino’s website for options to close an account and unsubscribe from all correspondence with the casino and its services, and this is what I found https://www.betterdicecasino.com/self-exclusion-policy:</p>
<p>"Self-Exclusion</p>
<p>If you are finding that your gameplay is having a negative effect on you personally, your situation or those around you, you are able to close your account under our ‘Self-Exclusion’. this feature can be activated by contacting our customer support services directly.</p>
<p>If you choose to self-exclude, you will not be allowed access to your account before your chosen, set time period has passed and you will no longer receive any marketing material from us at BetterDice. Should you wish to re-open your account after the time period has passed, you will be required to contact our customer support services and go through a considerable period before the account will be re-opened to use again.</p>
<p>We offer the following self-exclusion time frames:</p>
<p>6 months</p>
<p>1 year</p>
<p>3 years</p>
<p>5 years</p>
<p>Should you contact our customer support services in order to self-exclude your account, we will also provide you with recommended companies that may help, should you wish to talk through your gameplay behaviours and habits.</p>
<p>If you would like to prolong your self-exclusion period or require any further information on our self-exclusion feature, we kindly ask you to reach out to our customer support services team with your request.</p>
<p>Kindly send us an email at support@betterdicecasino.com with Subject ‘Self-exclusion’ and please state the time you want to be self-excluded."</p>
<p>I would recommend sending an email including all the relevant information to support@betterdicecasino.com. In this way, you’ll have proof of such an action. Specify in the request for how long you wish your account to be closed and clearly state the reason why. Additionally, email "Subject" should be clearly marked and easily recognizable as casino support receives many requests per day hence, if it’s visibly marked you stand a better chance to have your request granted as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Please, let me know if you need any assistance and keep me updated. Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
