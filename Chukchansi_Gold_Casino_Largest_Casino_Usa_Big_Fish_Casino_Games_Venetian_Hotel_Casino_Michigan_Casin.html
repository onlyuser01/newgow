<p>Kindred’s Unibet is arriving on the NJ bet with Hard Rock partnership</p>
<p>The company is hopeful to begin expanding across the US and adding verticals</p>
<p>Open Platform System to be used in NJ for player account management</p>
<p>Unibet, a popular overseas brand, is finally arriving in the U.S. It’s NJ casino entry is a first, with a Pennsylvanian launch also on the cards.</p>
<p>Kindred Group Rolls Unibet on the NJ Market</p>
<p>Kindred Group has officially rolled out Unibet, a brand it owns, with the help of land-based gaming operator Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino Atlantic City. The deal marks a water-shed moment in Kindred’s growing ambitions in the United States.</p>
<p>Kindred previously partnered with Mohegan Sun Pocono in Pennsylvania in January, with the Keystone State planning to officially roll out online gaming on July 15.</p>
<p>Back in NJ, Unibet will introduce players to a variety of casino games thanks to the Casino Service Industry Enterprise License the company secured in 2018. It is however the decisive role of Hard Rock’s bick-and-mortar facilities that have allowed Unibet to launch in earnest.</p>
<p>An Excellent Partner in the Face of SG</p>
<p>Kindred’s offshoot is going to team up with Scientific Games Digital for Unibet’s Open Platform System player account management platform. The Open Gaming System is a joint solution developed with the help of Kindred and SG Digital and negotiated in 2018.</p>
<p>As Unibet prepares to gain momentum in the US market, Kindred is already eyeing opportunities for expansion, particularly with the addition of a sports betting vertical. The sports betting solution will be powered by another long-standing partner in the face of Kambi.</p>
<p>“This announcement is the first one in a line of hopefully many more, since we believe in the importance of the US market," says Manuel Stan, SVP Kindred US. https://t.co/CCIhqq0YBP — Kindred Group (@KindredGroup) June 4, 2019</p>
<p>The official press release cited Kindred U.S. SVP Manuel Stan who had the following to say on the occasion of the deal:</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to announce that Kindred can now offer New Jersey customers a truly great gambling experience on a top technology platform in a sustainable, safe and secure environment. We have been preparing for this first and important step very thoroughly for a long time and we are excited to take another step into what will most likely become the largest betting market in the world”</p>
<p>Kindred is also planning to expand into Pennsylvania where the company already has ties with the aforementioned Mohegan. The venue got the official go-ahead from the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board (PGCB) in May.</p>
<p>Mr. Stan confirmed the company’s ambitions to continue expanding across the United States: “This announcement is the first one in a line of hopefully many more, since we believe in the importance of the US market.”</p>
<p>The legal hurdles have been crumbling one after another, giving overseas brands hopes to continue investing in the U.S. sports betting climate, which has been paying off.</p>
