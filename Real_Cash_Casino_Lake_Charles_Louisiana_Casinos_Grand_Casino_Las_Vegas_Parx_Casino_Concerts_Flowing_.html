<p>Beast Below review</p>
<p>Theme and Style</p>
<p>Beast Below is a sea monster-themed slot designed and developed by Hacksaw Gaming.</p>
<p>The slot takes players on a trip deep beneath the ocean, where all sorts of hideous-looking fish lie in wait for an unsuspecting boatman.</p>
<p>Win in the Beast Below slot machine</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>Hacksaw Gaming has a history of excellent sea-themed titles.</p>
<p>Cursed Seas is one of the developer’s most visually impressive slots, and it continues that run of form with Beast Below. The game looks fantastic, with a haunting atmosphere created by a muted color palette. The slot’s symbols consist of a collection of twisted-looking sea creatures with a menacing shark, a multi-eyed pufferfish, and a giant angry eel all being brought to life.</p>
<p>All of this is complemented by a suitably intense and atmospheric soundtrack.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Beast Below may look terrifying, but the base game keeps things nice and easy for players. The slot uses a 5x4 grid with 14 active paylines on each spin. Winning combinations are landed by hitting matching symbols across a payline starting on the leftmost reel.</p>
<p>The slot sticks with the same layout as other Hacksaw Gaming titles, with the control panel beneath the reels. The stake is found to the left of the spin button, and the autospin feature is on the other side.</p>

<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>Hacksaw Gaming has an excellent toolbox of bonus features, and it has dipped into this for the Beast Below bonus features.</p>
<p>One of the first bonuses is the Expanding Siren Wilds. Whenever this Wild lands, it can expand up the reel. As well as substituting to help other wins, it will also have a multiplier attached of between x2 and x200, which is applied to the win. If there are multiple Siren Wilds, their values are added.</p>
<p>The Siren’s Call Free Spins are triggered when players land three or more Scatters. Ten spins are given out. There is an increased chance of Siren Wilds landing during the round. During the round, there is also a Pink Siren Wild. This will stay on the reels and be nudged up a position on each spin until it disappears.</p>
<p>If you land four Scatter symbols, you will trigger the Down Below Free Spins. You will also get ten spins for this. During the round, the Diver Wild might appear. Like the Siren, this is an expanding symbol. However, when it lands, it will have three Oxygen Charges. On each spin, it can move to another reel, using up one Oxygen Charge. These remain on the reels until they have no Charges left.</p>
<p>Depending on your location, the slot may also feature a selection of Buy Bonus options. The Buy Bonus button is on the control panel beneath the reels.</p>
<p>Moving &amp; expanding symbol - the Diver symbol</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>Like most Hacksaw Gaming slots, Beast Below provides some good winning potential. The maximum win in the slot is a strong 10,000x your stake.</p>
<p>The game’s RTP is 96.29%, which is above the industry average, making it ideal for our slot strategy.</p>
<p>Hacksaw Gaming has rated the game as highly volatile.</p>
<p>Full paytable for the Beast Below slot</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Beast Below is another fun sea-themed slot from Hacksaw Gaming. The slot features the developer’s trademark highly volatile gameplay, as well as a selection of great bonus features. The Siren and Diver Expanding Wilds can lead to some big wins, and the game’s design is also excellent. Overall, another quality offering from Hacksaw Gaming.</p>
