<p>This photo was taken a year ago today at the exact moment @dksportsbook became the 1st mobile sportsbook operator in NJ. The passion &amp; dedication of our team is incredible and I could not be more proud of them. The best part is, we are just getting started.

<p>A Good Year to Grow</p>
<p>The American daily fantasy and sports betting giant, DraftKings, stepped into collaboration with software developer and sports betting solutions provider Kambi Group PLC back in June 2018, when the former was seeking support for launching a sports betting service in New Jersey. Shortly after the conclusion of the first year of working together, results point towards mutual appreciation and just as of recently DraftKings have publicly announced their intentions on providing support for the further expansion of their partner in growth across eight states.</p>
<p>The new deal grants Kambi access to operating in New York, Pennsylvania, Colorado, Iowa, Maine, Indiana, Tennessee and West Virginia. In the meanwhile, current revenue results in New Jersey show for a steady grip and a good degree of security for the near future.</p>
<p>“Over the course of the past 12 months, Kambi and DraftKings have developed a symbiotic relationship, working closely together to deliver a high-quality sportsbook, which has only improved over time” said Kambi CEO Kristian Nylén.</p>
<p>Kambi’s 2019</p>
<p>Following the announcement, shares for the Kambi Group plc spiked a 19.21% on Thursday. The solutions developer pointed out that the opportunity to generate incremental revenue, once the partnership commences its new jurisdictions, is a very welcome one.</p>
<p>Last month, Kambi reported a 25.3% year-on-year revenue growth for the first half of 2019.</p>
