<p>Pariplay announced Thursday it will enter the Spanish regulated market through 888casino’s brand MGA Games, providing the gaming developer with its Fusion platform and Ignite program.</p>
<p>Milestone Entry for Pariplay</p>
<p>iGaming aggregator Pariplay announced on November 26 it has partnered up with casino game provider MGA Games to enter the Spanish market via 888casino. Pariplay supplies operators with its innovative Fusion aggregation platform and the Ignite Studio development program.</p>
<p>Pariplay will go live in Spain with 888casino’s local gaming developer MGA Games to provide content to players in the country through Fusion. The top gaming technology company plans to expand its offer to more Spanish operators in the future.</p>
<p>The online gambling aggregation platform Fusion and the development program Ignite Studio launched in 2016 and have reinforced Pariplay in the global market.</p>
<p>The Fusion platform offers global solutions to provide operators with its large portfolio of localized gaming content and development tools to enter regulated markets and grow steadily.</p>
<p>Important Online Gaming Market Growth</p>
<p>According to the Dirección General de Ordenación del Juego (DGOJ), the Spanish gaming authority, the iGaming market is experiencing significant growth with a 17.6% increase in revenue from the fourth quarter of 2019 to the first quarter of 2020, totaling €218 million in Q1.</p>
<p>Pariplay and its innovative products entered Portugal and Switzerland earlier this year and this new milestone entry in Spain’s regulated market confirms the company’s leading position in Europe.</p>
<p>The deal is “a win” for 888, which will allow them to further develop their business in the Spanish market and reinforces the company’s commitment to offering a safe and enjoyable gaming experience to players.</p>
<p>“Act Local, Think Global”, MGA Games’ Strategy</p>
<p>Barcelona-based MGA Games joins many other operators using Pariplay’s products. The leading company was founded in 2001 and specializes in the development and distribution of online gambling products for operators across the world. MGA’s commitment to offering news games on a regular basis sets the company as one of the best content providers in Spain.</p>
<p>At its MGA Games Day event, the company shared its plans for 2021 and beyond, which include 15 new games for the Spanish market with 7 slots and 8 Spanish Celebrities Casino Slots games to be launched next year. The developer announced that all games will feature better audio, an improved system, and surprising mini-games. MGA Games’ 100th release will be a sequel to its Chiquito slots celebrating Spanish comedian Chiquito de la Calzada.</p>
<p>The new partnership is in line with MGA Games’ international strategy “Act Local, Think Global” and gives the company “a very unique opportunity to expand the reach of our offering to even more operators” CEO Joan Sanahuja said. “Kicking things off with 888casino.com puts us in an excellent position to leverage our game content,” he added.</p>
<p>The company will first expand in Portugal and has plans to enter Italy, Bulgaria, Holland, Sweden, and Denmark.</p>
