<p>You are in safe hands We guarantee that all sites listed on GamblingNews.com are safe, legitimate, and secure operators that will help bring out the best possible iGaming experience. We will never knowingly promote unlicensed or blacklisted websites that operate against jurisdictional laws. Each brand we review is always manually co-verified by an online gambling expert. Legal and regulated</p>

<p>Secure and licensed</p>
<p>Intertops Casino (now rebranded as Everygame Casino) is tied at the very top with other established brands as one of the best online casinos available to US players today. The brand has over 8 years in the US market, making it one of the most trusted names when it comes to iGaming.</p>
<p>They do offer other faces of the gaming experience as well, including a poker room and a sportsbook, but I will only talk about the casino as there is a lot of ground to cover, and I am sure you will appreciate the detailed put I will bring.</p>
<p>With this said, Intertops feels and plays great from mobile. There are two skins to the casino, Classic, and Red to make the experience more diverse and definitely a great deal more unique. The company is headquartered in Antigua and it was actually established all the way back in 1996!</p>
<p>Unlike other companies, Intertops has dedicated multi-lingual support available via live chat and email. Oh, and did I mention that you will get a $5,555 welcome package if you are a new player? Let’s talk Intertops and see what this casino brings to your gaming comfort.</p>
<p>Intertops Casino Classic and Casino Red Overview</p>
<p>Alright, for those of you who are new to Intertops Casino, you may find the duality here a little confusing, but I assure you the casino is quite awesome. You can choose between Intertops Casino Classic and Intertops Casino Red.</p>
<p>You know how some casinos decide to do an overhaul and scratch most of their older products? Well, Intertops has decided to be a little more proactive and I have reviewed both facets of the casino for your pleasure.</p>
<p>Basically, the Classic Casino is powered by WGS Technology and it offers an awesome gold and black user interface. The layout has actually been updated to be mobile responsive and it’s a real pleasure playing in what should at least on paper be the classic look.</p>
<p>To me, it feels like a great updated version of the website. The default version now is Casino Red, which is powered by none other than Realtime Gaming. Now, you are wondering, isn’t that a little tricky to navigate?</p>
<p>Yes and no. You should just take it at face value. I actually welcome this decision as it allows me to play in two distinctive and dedicated settings. Both skins of the casino are available as part of the downloadable software, directly in the instant browser solution, or from any Android or iOS handheld device.</p>
<p>Restricted Countries and States</p>
<p>Players from Bulgaria, France, and the United Kingdom will have to take the back seat on this one. Conversely, though, if you are based in Australia, Canada, or New Zealand, you will have no trouble connecting.</p>
<p>To abide by US laws, however, Intertops Casino has had to make some amendments and unfortunately, players in the following states won’t be able to register and play:</p>
<p>Washington State</p>
<p>Louisiana</p>
<p>Kentucky</p>
<p>Maryland</p>
<p>New Jersey</p>
<p>New York</p>
<p>Missouri</p>
<p>This list may change over time, so it’s best to always keep an eye on the Terms and Conditions of the website. Intertops should mostly block states and countries that are not permitted to play, but it never hurts to double-check.</p>
<p>Intertops Casino Welcome Bonus &amp; Promotions</p>
<p>I want to begin by saying that I have truly appreciated the different approaches to bonuses that were used in Intertops Casino Classic and Casino Red. Having a bit of diversity definitely makes things more exciting. There are quite a few promos you can pick here, including the $5,555 welcome package or just the individual 125% up to $1,000 match bonus.</p>
<p>Casino Red Bonuses</p>
<p>Casino Red arguably has more promotions than the Classic version of the website. Here you will find a dedicated welcome package, various contests worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, and a very tempting $1,000 sign-up bonus.</p>
<p>You can pick any you feel would feel advantageous to your gameplay. Either way, we recommend not ignoring the Terms and Conditions as they will provide a useful source of information for your gameplay and how to claim the bonus funds specifically.</p>
<p>Welcome Package $5,555</p>
<p>The welcome package is available across multiple deposits, five to be precise. Players can claim up to $5,555. The match bonus and maximum amount will vary from one deposit to the next:</p>
<p>125% up to $1,000 – SIGNUP1000 150% up to $,1500 – MATCHUP2 125% up to $1,000 – MATCHUP3 150% up to $2,000 – MATCHUP4 $55 Free Bonus – FREEBIE55</p>
<p>To activate the bonus, you need to use the promo code listed next to the bonus and deposit at least $20. Terms and Conditions apply, which means you will have to meet the wagering requirement which is 30 times both your deposit and withdrawal.</p>
<p>125% Welcome Bonus up to $1,000</p>
<p>Another decent bonus is the 125% Welcome Bonus up to $1,000. This way you don’t have to participate in the welcome package if you feel that it’s too much. To be fair, I didn’t claim the welcome package myself but opted for this bonus, as I didn’t have enough time to play.</p>
<p>The good news is the 125% Welcome Bonus is awesome and you will find reasons to enjoy it. There is $1,000 in bonus funds and you can activate it by depositing at least $20 and entering the SIGNUP1000 promo code. Actually, it’s pretty much the same offer as the bonus in the welcome package, only you don’t have to follow up with any of the other deposits if you don’t want to.</p>
<p>Mobile Award</p>
<p>Playing on mobile devices will pay off if you are gaming at Intertops. Players are eligible for up to $100 in free money every week if they deposit $50 from a mobile device and manage to wager at least $500 during the week. A total of 20 players will be handed out rewards ranging from $20 – $100.</p>
<p>Loyalty Pays Off</p>
<p>The loyalty program at Casino Red is a great way to develop your bankroll further. For each $10 you wager, you will receive 1 COMP POINT. You can then turn 100 COMP POINTS into $1 which is a nice way to keep your money circulating.</p>
<p>More Red Promotions</p>
<p>Apart from the promos listed above, there are other bargains and bonuses available at Intertops Casino. Here are three of the currently active ones:</p>
<p>$270,000 Summer Dreams – The casino awards 300 leaderboard cash prizes every Monday. In other words, you will probably want to be among the more active players at the casino.</p>
<p>– The casino awards 300 leaderboard cash prizes every Monday. In other words, you will probably want to be among the more active players at the casino. $120,000 Time Travel – Players will be winning $30,000 a week with 300 leaderboard players receiving various awards ranging from $30 to $500.</p>
<p>– Players will be winning $30,000 a week with 300 leaderboard players receiving various awards ranging from $30 to $500. $30,000 Wheel of Fortune – The Wheel of Fortune promotion will give 20 lucky players $50 each every week while the promotion is still active.</p>
<p>Now, these are limited offers that are available to me and other US players today. However, I suspect by the time you read these new promotions will have to appear.</p>
<p>While I can’t be 100% sure what the new promos would be like, I can almost guarantee you that you would need to deposit and play at least $75 to qualify for a draw. Make sure to read the T&amp;Cs of each contest.</p>
<p>These events usually don’t have Intertops Casino bonus codes attached to them, but you never know. Why not double-check, just to be on the safe side?</p>
<p>Intertops Casino Classic Bonuses</p>
<p>Alright, so the classic version of the casino has less eye-popping sums of money listed as bonuses, but I don’t think this is a bad thing at all. In fact, the Classic Casino has slightly more diverse you have various deposit bonuses that will vary depending on the day of the week, including:</p>
<p>75% up to $150 – Bonus code: CCSAT available on Saturday</p>
<p>50% up to $100 – Bonus code: CCSUN available on Sunday</p>
<p>50% up to $100 – Bonus code: CCMON available on Monday</p>
<p>50% up to $100 – Bonus code: CCTUE available on Tuesday</p>
<p>50% up to $100 – Bonus code: CCWED available on Wednesday</p>
<p>50% up to $100 – Bonus code: CCTHU available on Thursday</p>
<p>75% up to $150 – Bonus code: CCFRI available on Friday</p>
<p>Free Spins</p>
<p>Another big advantage in my opinion is the fact that Intertops Casino Classic runs free spins promos, which are some of my favorites, and probably yours too! Once again, you can get exciting free spins that will be tailored to an individual slot experience based on the day of the week.</p>
<p>Bonus Intertops Bonus Codes Available On 100 spins on Dolphin Reef SPINSAT Saturday 100 spins on Cool Bananas SPINSUN Sunday 100 spins on City of Gold SPINMON Monday 100 spins on Fat Cat SPINTUE Tuesday 100 spins on King Tiger SPINWED Wednesday 100 spins on Dynasty SPINTHU Thursday 100 spins on Funky Chicken SPINFRI Friday</p>
<p>Tournaments</p>
<p>Another awesome addition to the Intertops Casino Classic experience is the tournaments. Intertops Casino has been able to create quite a little nirvana for people who love competing in various games, not only slots! You will be able to pick from several main categories, including:</p>
<p>Featured</p>
<p>Free Rolls</p>
<p>Slots</p>
<p>Table Games</p>
<p>Video Poker</p>
<p>Each tournament will have a prize pool that contestants will vie for and a buy-in. The events have a start and end date, making it very easy to follow through and know all there is to know about the games and competitions.</p>
<p>Comp Points in Classic</p>
<p>Interestingly, the comp points at the Classic Casino follow a different logic as well. Players will need a lot more points to cash them in for various bonuses and other cash prizes. The good news is that the games will also generate a whole lot more points, as in:</p>
<p>Slot/Keno – 16 points for $10</p>
<p>– 16 points for $10 Blackjack – 3 points for $10</p>
<p>– 3 points for $10 Video poker – 5 points for $10</p>
<p>– 5 points for $10 Roulette – 3 points for $10</p>
<p>– 3 points for $10 Table games – 6 points for $10</p>
<p>Intertops Casino Payment Methods</p>
<p>If you want to really appreciate how great Intertops Casino is, I recommend that you try the available banking methods. Intertops is one of the few casinos located “offshore” that will allow you to pick from an outstanding variety of payment options.</p>
<p>All of the listed methods they provide will give you the freedom to transact in the way you prefer and have zero trouble doing it. Deposits and withdrawals feel quick, intuitive, and more importantly, safe. Here are the banking methods for both Casino Red and Casino Classic.</p>

<p>: Minimum $20, instant EU SEPA bank transfer: $10 – $5,000, 2-4 business days</p>
<p>Most of the withdrawal methods are free and won’t charge any additional costs. However, a few will so I recommend that you check if any fees apply when you cash out. The casino has a dedicated Payment History box where you can monitor all your transactions to and from the casino.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that you will be asked to submit documents proving your identity and address as KYC and AML checks to ensure that you are playing responsibly and aren’t trying to use stolen funds.</p>
<p>What Games to Try at Intertops Casino</p>
<p>As I said earlier, you will have a slightly different choice of games depending on whether you pick Casino Red or Casino Classic. The first is powered by Realtime Gaming titles whereas Classic is powered by WGS Technology. All in all, that gives you up to 500 excellent games to try and what is certainly a substantial portfolio of games.</p>
<p>Regardless of the casino you pick, you will have access to some outstanding picks, including slots, video poker games, and progressive jackpots. All games will work neatly with a mobile device and you will have a good time picking from slots, video poker, table games, and even progressive jackpots. Let’s see what games are available.</p>
<p>Slots</p>
<p>Intertops Casino Red has some good picks to offer. Realtime Gaming has kept very quiet over the last few years, but they are back and in style. Today, you can try exciting slots such as:</p>
<p>Achilles Deluxe</p>
<p>Cash Bandits 3</p>
<p>Wild Hog</p>
<p>Vegas Lux</p>
<p>Diamond Fiesta</p>
<p>5 Wishes</p>
<p>Dr. Winmore</p>
<p>Magic Mushrooms</p>
<p>WGS has a lot of excellent vintage-looking slots that I would also recommend. Of course, you can’t expect the same quality as NetEnt or Microgaming games, but I actually find WGS to be a very worthwhile developer.</p>
<p>They offer something fresh that has been on the market for over a decade and is still played. Intertops Casino Classic makes the experience even better by offering an awesome user interface to make browsing through the portfolio of games easy enough.</p>
<p>You can play for real money or a demo version. The featured games here include Cleopatra’s Pyramid II, Magic Monkey II, Mystic Gems, Signing Fan, Down the Drain, California Gold, and other featured slots.</p>
<p>Progressive Jackpots</p>
<p>Another specialty at Intertops Casino is the progressive jackpot games. The WGS games will offer smaller overall prize pools, but you will have a few more jackpots from that developer. The numbers will change in real-time to reflect the current interest and when the last jackpot was won, but you can expect to win anything between $200 and $210,000 on games such as Stocking Stuff and Red White &amp; Win.</p>
<p>Realtime Gaming jackpots tend to be a little more impressive and you will easily find games that run in the hundreds of thousands. I recommend trying Aztec’s Millions, Caribbean Draw Poker, Cleopatra’s Gold, Jackpot Pinatas, Megasaur, and others.</p>
<p>Video Poker</p>
<p>Another specialty to consider is video poker. Video poker is one of the top games in the iGaming world, as I have said before. It offers a return-to-player (RTP) rate that can exceed 100%, although you shouldn’t count on that. Still, even the base RTP which is 99.56% in most cases and more is very much worth it. You will find some excellent video poker titles here, including:</p>
<p>Aces &amp; Eights</p>
<p>All American Poker</p>
<p>Double Bonus Poker</p>
<p>Bonus Poker</p>
<p>Deuces Wild</p>
<p>Mystery Bonus Poker</p>
<p>Jacks or Better</p>
<p>Table Games</p>
<p>I would not miss playing Intertops Casino’s table games if I were you. Other than the fact that there are actual progressive jackpot games in this section, you will have a decent variety of games to play around with.</p>
<p>Baccarat and 21 Blackjack are excellent titles you can try and Caribbean Hold’em and Caribbean Stud Poker share a prize pool together that is continually growing until it’s won and the countdown starts once again.</p>
<p>In addition, you can enjoy titles such as 21 Face Up, Let ‘Em Ride, Match Play 21, and others. For a full list of the games, I do recommend opening your own account today. Or, alternatively, you can take a look at the list of Casino Classic table games:</p>
<p>10 High Hold’em 10 High Hold’em 10 High Hold’em American Roulette American Roulette American Roulette Atlantic City Blackjack Atlantic City Blackjack Atlantic City Blackjack Baccarat Baccarat Baccarat Casino Hold’em Casino Hold’em Casino Hold’em</p>
<p>Safety, Security, and Fairness</p>
<p>To ensure the safety of players, Intertops Casino does have quite a few tricks up its sleeve. First, the casino is affiliated with the Central Dispute System to guarantee that any conflict between you and the casino would be handled by an independent third party. However, even more importantly than that, Intertops is vetted by iTech Labs.</p>
<p>The company runs extensive checks on Random Number Generators (RNGs) to ensure that everything is fair. This sort of transparency definitely puts the casino up there with the industry’s best and most established companies.</p>
<p>Intertops Customer Support</p>
<p>Intertops Casino will be there for you 24/7, and you will be able to reach the service via email and live chat. The customer service operates in both English and German and you can open a live chat window at any time of the day and night. If you have a specific query you want to address in written form, we recommend turning to the following emails:</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Intertops Casino is definitely a good pick. Don’t get me wrong. I won’t tell you that the casino doesn’t have its faults or that every little foible is negligible. However, Intertops Casino Red and Classic are household names in the industry.</p>
<p>I personally think they should add more to their gaming libraries and possibly expand with a live dealer studio, which would be awesome. In compiling this Intertops Casino review, I also referenced many other professional reviewing services as I don’t hold myself as the ultimate authority on iGaming.</p>
<p>I was pleased to find out that all of the best services out there have given Intertops their seal of approval in one form or another. Sure, some things can be done differently or better altogether. However, you will definitely appreciate the mobile compatibility and flexible banking opportunities at Intertops Casino.</p>
