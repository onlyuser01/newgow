<p>PokerStars, a Flutter-owned operator describing itself as “the world’s best online poker room,” has penned a sponsorship agreement with the Detroit Red Wings, a franchise from the National Hockey League.</p>
<p>PokerStars Joined Forces with the Detroit Red Wings</p>
<p>As per the agreement, PokerStars will join the team as a sponsor and promote online poker while supporting professional sports.</p>
<p>The multi-year deal will see the poker brand capitalize on the rapid growth of online poker to offer exciting experiences to fans across the United States. To that end, PokerStars will roll out special rewards for players, which will include merchandise signed by the Detroit Red Wings, event tickets and various other opportunities.</p>
<p>PokerStars will also be allowed to use Detroit Red Wings imagery to promote its products, including the team’s famous Winged Wheel. Fans can expect to see the NHL franchise’s logo in various promotional materials. Meanwhile, PokerStars’ logo will make an appearance at the Little Caesars Arena during the team’s home games.</p>
<p>Lastly, PokerStars and the Red Wings vowed to promote responsible gambling.</p>
<p>The Two Parties Are Happy to Be Working Together</p>
<p>PokerStars and the Detroit Red Wings spoke about their agreement. According to Chris McGowan, president and chief executive officer of Ilitch Sports and Entertainment, this new partnership is to be enjoyed by all fans of the National Hockey League. He added that it is great to see PokerStars’ branding adorn the Little Caesars Arena and thanked the operator for its support.</p>
<p>Severin Rasset, PokerStars US’s managing director, also spoke on the agreement. He said that his team is very proud to build a long-term relationship with an iconic NHL team such as the Red Wings. Rasset added that PokerStars will leverage this agreement to deliver “epic experiences” to the PokerStars community, expanding its offering for Michigan players and players across the United States as a whole.</p>
<p>PokerStars Has Been Very Active</p>
<p>In other news, PokerStars recently joined forces with Push Gaming, a leading supplier of online casino games for the iGaming industry. Under that agreement, the former company will power Push Gaming’s offerings with its proprietary suite of iGaming titles and solutions.</p>
<p>In early November, PokerStars and Poker Power teamed up to deliver a new “boot camp” program targeted at female soccer players. Through this initiative, the parties seek to increase women’s participation in pro sports.</p>
<p>Not everything has been smooth for the operator, though, as it was recently forced to reimburse a player in Germany. The gambler in question spent thousands on online poker long before it was legal in the country.</p>
