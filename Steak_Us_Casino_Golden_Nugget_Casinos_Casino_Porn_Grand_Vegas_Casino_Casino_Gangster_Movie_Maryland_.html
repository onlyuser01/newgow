    <h1>Steak Us Casino Golden Nugget Casinos Casino Porn Grand Vegas Casino Casino Gangster Movie Maryland</h1>

<p>Maryland’s pool bar Top Hat Sports Bar &amp; Grill is introducing its very own sportsbook with the help of sports wagering and online gambling technology provider Elys Game Technology.</p>
<p>Top Hat Sports Bar &amp; Grill Will Use Elys’ Technology and Services for New Sportsbook</p>
<p>Elys has partnered with the Top Hat Sports Bar &amp; Grill’s owner Bookmakers and will be providing its tailored sports betting retail services to the bar’s brand-new sportsbook.</p>
<p>Top Hat Sports Bar &amp; Grill is located in Parkville, Baltimore, and has been in business for over 30 years. The bar offers a wide variety of games such as pool, table tennis, darts, and various arcade machines. The space also houses a sports bar and a lounge area with numerous big TV screens where guests can watch their favorite sports.</p>
<p>The bar’s newest addition is going to be an in-house sportsbook. In order to launch it, however, Bookmakers had to find a suitable partner.</p>
<p>Bookmakers’ owner Karen Senac has elaborated why her company chose Elys as a partner: “Elys’ experience in the market, ease of use for players, and reporting for regulatory compliance is what drove Bookmakers to select and sign with Elys. We expect that their “Build-A-Bet” feature will be especially attractive to our customers. We are excited about the prospect of offering yet another layer of entertainment to the customers of this already busy establishment.”</p>
<p>As per the new partnership, Elys will provide the necessary technology to launch and run the new sportsbook in exchange for a percentage of the revenue the Top Hat Sports Bar &amp; Grill’s sportsbook generates.</p>
<p>The agreement is still subject to the approval of the Maryland Lottery and Gaming Control Commission.</p>
<p>A Change in the Rules has Allowed Top Hat Sports Bar &amp; Grill to Introduce a Sportsbook</p>
<p>The Maryland Lottery and Gaming Control Agency introduced new regulations for the introduction of sports betting. It has allowed local establishments to add retail sportsbooks as a supplement to other services they are offering.</p>
<p>The sportsbook launch at the Top Hat Sports Bar &amp; Grill follows a similar development at the integrated casino resort Rod ‘N’ Reel located at the waterfront in Western Shore, Maryland.</p>
<p>The Top Hat Sports Bar &amp; Grill and the Rod ‘N’ Reel Resort are among five other local businesses, which have been approved as ‘class B’ entities, which means that they will be granted a retail sports betting license.</p>
<p>Adding a sportsbook option to a local establishment is going to improve revenue streams and draw in a new customer base, which is interested in the sports wagering product, to the benefit of the local establishment and, consequently, the state of Maryland.</p>
