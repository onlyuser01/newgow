<p>After the number of positive COVID-19 cases in Pennsylvania has decreased in the last 3 weeks, the temporary restrictions introduced by Governor Tom Wolf in early December will expire. As a result, Hollywood Casino and Meadows Casino and Racetrack will reopen for visitors next week Monday.</p>
<p>Temporary COVID-19 Shutdown Ends on Monday</p>
<p>Pennsylvania residents will be able to enjoy once again casino gambling in Dauphin County and Washington County starting from next week Monday. The three-week temporary COVID-19 shutdown which Governor Tom Wolf introduced on December 12 for casinos, gyms, bars, and other entertainment businesses will expire. Earlier this week, the Governor revealed that in light of the recent trend of decreasing the number of positive COVID-19 cases, the temporary closure which was enforced will be lifted.</p>
<p>Consequently, on Wednesday, Penn National Gaming revealed that at least two of its casinos will reopen on January 4, 8 A.M. Those are Hollywood Casino at Penn National Race Course in Dauphin County as well as Meadows Casino and Racetrack in Washington County.</p>
<p>In a statement, the Senior Vice President of Public Affairs and Government Relations, Eric Schippers, said that following some of the “most rigorous COVID mitigation measures”, the venues will be pleased to welcome both guests and team members back. Furthermore, Schippers said that it will be safer for Pennsylvanians who enjoy casino gaming to visit their venues instead of going to “out-of-state casinos or patronize illegal skill slot machine locations where there is no regulatory or COVID safety monitoring“.</p>
<p>Not All Businesses Are Ready to Reopen</p>
<p>Besides the social distancing and sanitation protocols, the indoor entertainment places that can reopen on January 4 will need to operate under a 50% capacity limit. Although Penn’s Dauphin County and Washington County venues are ready to reopen, this may not be the case for other entertainment venues.</p>
<p>One such venue is Susquehanna Art Museum in Harrisburg. Speaking for Penn Live, the Executive Director of the museum, Alice Anne Schwab, revealed that the venue has not decided when it will reopen for visitors.</p>
<p>According to her, although the museum can offer “natural social distancing” with its 18,500 square feet, the venue is “not jumping at reopening on January 4”. Mrs. Schwab added that the museum may consider a reopening later in January but if it is done it will be carefully planned and considered with the museum’s essential employees and volunteers.</p>
