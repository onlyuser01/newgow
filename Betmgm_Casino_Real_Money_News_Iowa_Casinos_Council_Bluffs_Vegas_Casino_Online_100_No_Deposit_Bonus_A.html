    <h1>Betmgm Casino Real Money News Iowa Casinos Council Bluffs Vegas Casino Online 100 No Deposit Bonus A</h1>

<p>Hi Peter. Thank you for trying to help me. You’re a good person. Just wanted to update you.</p>
<p>I made a different account last night at an attempt to get in touch with someone in support at roobet. The Traditional email method hadn’t seemed to be getting through to this point. I went to the live support and asked to speak to a manager or whoever was in charge. They said there wasn’t one there at the time but asked what it was regarding.</p>
<p>I explained to them the situation and sent them my screenshots. Another rep or maybe he was the manager (I believe his name was Oliver) Jumps in the chat and in not as many words, basically told me that I was delusional. That I didn’t send them an email back in September, that I didn’t send a follow up in October and that they did NOT finally respond to me at the end of October saying they would close the account by granting my request with an apology for my unpleasant experience. He claimed to have looked over my account and "DID NOT see any record of those emails." — Talk about convenience. Interesting how I have the emails in my inbox time stamped, dated and confirmed, yet they conveniently and mysteriously had NO record of them. I guess having proof is meaningless and irrelevant to Roobet casino.</p>
<p>As it stands I would tell any potentially new player trying to decide on which casino to play at NOT to play at Roobet. I repeat do not give Roobet your money. If you stumbled across my experience with Roobet and still decide to give them your hard earned money, or not hard earned money, its on you. Give it to charity. Buy your mom or yourself a gift but don’t play here. They have proven to be anything but honest, and far from "FAIR" a term that is used freely in this world, to describe gameplay and casino reputation.</p>
<p>In a perfect world they would have honored and respected my plea to close my account back in September when I asked. I realized that I had a problem and it wasn’t something I’ve been dealing with or ever dealt with before. I have been to casinos in the past not once did I go off the rails. Playing in person just doesn’t feel like it felt playing online. I couldn’t figure out why... Until I figured out why. Which is when I realized this online casino play is way different then actually physically playing in a casino...</p>
<p>I realized that I had nothing to win and everything to lose. I saw the danger Of gambling online and tried to save myself from losing any more money. I trusted a company that claimed to be fully aware of the potential danger of their site, combined with the mind of a sick person that suffered from a disease called addiction. They claimed/claim that if a player believes that him/her have a problem with gambling and self control or lack thereof, that they will honor any and all requests to "SELF EXCLUDE" yourself from the site. No questions asked, and with no option to undo this decision once it is made. Even if you changed your mind down the road. It’s for life. Your account will be closed immediately upon request.</p>
<p>Welp that never happened. Until 3 months later and it was too late. They failed at being an honest and ethical business.</p>
