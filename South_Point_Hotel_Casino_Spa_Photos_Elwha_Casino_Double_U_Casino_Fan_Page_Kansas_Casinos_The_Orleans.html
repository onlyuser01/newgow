    <h1>South Point Hotel Casino Spa Photos Elwha Casino Double U Casino Fan Page Kansas Casinos The Orleans</h1>

<p>Dear CasinoGuru team,</p>
<p>This complaint is directed against the casino "Sapphirebet" and unfortunately also to you or your report on the above casino.</p>
<p>I deposited 100 euros with a token because you gave this casino a good reputation. No particularly negative conditions or anything like that could be found in your review. I successfully managed to beat the wager worth 3500 euros. At the end of the wager there was 100 euros in my main account and around 640 euros in my bonus account. This results in a payout amount of 740 euros - normally.</p>
<p>However, the maximum (!) Profit from the bonus is the bonus amount received (!). In my case that means 100 euros.</p>
<p>I wonder why such important information does not appear in your review. Although you can press extra on "bonus conditions". Only this information appears there:</p>
<p>"1st deposit bonus</p>
<p>Minimum deposit: € 10</p>
<p>Sales criteria: 35x bonus</p>
<p>Deposit NOT BLOCKED</p>
<p>Maximum bet: € 5</p>
<p>For new players only</p>
<p>Full terms and conditions apply</p>
<p>Free spins will not be awarded to users with accounts in OMR, BHD, QTUM, KWD, MBT, ZEC, XMR, LTC, DASH, ETH, XAU. "</p>
<p>How a casino with such a bonus policy can get a good reputation is very, very questionable in my opinion. I am disappointed and, of course, have already finished with the missing 540 euros. Since I don't think there is any way to get it. I still think it's an absolute cheek from the above casino - maybe you can make a difference there.</p>
<p>Screenshots etc. take place in the next step.</p>
<p>Of course, I also used your bonus code (CASINOGURU). Because of this, by using your code, I assumed that there are NO such conditions that are absolutely unfair for the player. I feel fooled.</p>
<p>Warm greetings!</p>
<p>Investments:</p>
<p>On the screenshots you can see on the one hand the balance before the wager was made, then a picture which shows both accounts (after implementation of the bonus), a picture which shows the fulfilled wager, a picture which shows the main account after the bonus money transfer and the support Conversation.</p>
