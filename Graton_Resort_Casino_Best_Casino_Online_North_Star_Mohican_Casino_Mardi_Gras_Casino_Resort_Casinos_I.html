<p>MGA Games, a developer of slots and online casino games, has agreed to power Fair Play Casino’s offer in the Netherlands with its suite of iGaming titles. The agreement will help MGA Games expand its presence in the European region.</p>
<p>MGA Games Enters the Netherlands with Fair Play</p>
<p>This will be the first time MGA Games makes a foray into the Netherlands. Ever since its re-regulation last year, the Dutch betting market has been one of the most appealing jurisdictions for many gambling companies.</p>
<p>As per the agreement, MGA Games will provide its new partner with 10 games with more to be added at a later date. This will boost Fair Play Casino’s online offer and will help it attract more players to its platform.</p>
<p>To celebrate the new agreement, MGA Games’ leadership confirmed that the company is working on a new title made especially for the Dutch Market. The game will be called Dutch Celebritie and will celebrate the Netherlands and its rich culture.</p>
<p>The Agreement Will Benefit Both Companies</p>
<p>Fair Play Casino’s business development manager, Pascal Janshen, commented on the new agreement and said that his company is glad to be able to expand its portfolio. He said that his team is looking forward to enhancing the company’s offer with MGA Games’ cutting-edge titles and engaging players like never before.</p>
<p>Jashen noted that MGA Games’ strength lies in its Megaways titles. He believes that such games will thrive in the Netherlands and said that he is certain that the partnership will become a great success for both companies.</p>
<p>Jorge Javier Lanfranchi, the sales director of MGA Games, also shared his thoughts. He shared that his company is excited by the opportunity to join the flourishing Dutch market and emphasized that this deal is an important part of his company’s growth strategy.</p>
<p>We are sure that with our localized product and our plan for launching high-performance games, Dutch casino operators will benefit enormously. Jorge Javier Lanfranchi, sales director, MGA Games</p>
<p>In other news, MGA Games inked a Spain-facing partnership with StarVegas earlier this year. In June, the two companies agreed to work together and engage Spanish customers with new titles. As a result, MGA Games brought 30 of its critically-acclaimed titles to the Dutch market.</p>
<p>Speaking of the Netherlands, LiveScore Bet, one of the licensed operators in the country, just joined the NOGA, a Dutch association for online gaming companies. Members of the NOGA work together to make gambling safer and healthier for all customers.</p>
