    <h1>Casinos In Laughlin Mohegan Sun Casino Events St Croix Casino Turtle Lake Wi Running Aces Casino Min</h1>

<p>GLI has hired a duo of executives to help the company keep up with its day-to-day operations. Gaming Laboratories International is one of the most prominent testing companies in the iGaming space and it provides an impartial audit of gambling companies’ slot, table, poker machines, sports, and racing among other audits and overall integrity services.</p>
<p>Bringing Steve May into the Fold</p>
<p>To help continue to do so, the company is bringing Steve May as client solutions executive and Samuel Grunther as an account executive. May is a well-seasoned veteran who is experienced with pari-mutuel, racing, and compliance matters, and who will be able to ensure that GLI’s clients get the best possible service.</p>
<p>He has worked extensively in various companies and organizations with a similar focus, including the Minnesota Racing Commission, where he served as executive director. He also helped as director of pari-mutuel wagering and compliance for the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission. His expertise continues as he was the VP and business manager for the Association of Racing Commissioners International.</p>
<p>Welcoming May, SVP of government affairs and general counsel Kevin Mullally said that May comes forward as a problem-solver and a well-seasoned veteran whom the GLI team is only happy to have:</p>
<p>His technical acumen and knowledge of developing and implementing compliance programs will greatly benefit a wide array of our clients. He has earned the trust of both regulators and the industry, and we are grateful to have him on the team. GLI SVP of government affairs and general counsel Kevin Mullally</p>
<p>Relying on Sam Grunther’s Deep iGaming and Sports Background</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Grunther is familiar with both the iGaming and sports betting industry. He will assist clients, including suppliers and operators, by helping them obtain the information and expertise they need quickly. His experience spans several important roles, including as guest relations operator at Madison Square Garden and customer operations agent at FanDuel.</p>
<p>VP of client services Salim L. Adatia said that Grunther brought a deep understanding of the sports media landscape, which, along with his understanding of sports betting and iGaming, would once again prove invaluable assets for GLI.</p>
<p>The news about Grunther and May’s appointments comes only a month and a half after the company tapped two other executives, to name Kelly Myers and Malvina Mikaelian. They stepped in as manager of solutions and director of engineering respectively.</p>
