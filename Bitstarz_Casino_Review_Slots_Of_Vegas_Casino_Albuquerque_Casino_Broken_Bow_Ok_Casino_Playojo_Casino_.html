    <h1>Bitstarz Casino Review Slots Of Vegas Casino Albuquerque Casino Broken Bow Ok Casino Playojo Casino</h1>

<p>The English Premier League (EPL) newly-installed boss, Richard Masters, has argued against any government attempts to restrict clubs’ freedom of striking up partnerships with whomever they see fit, and betting companies in particular.</p>
<p>EPL New Chief Executive Richard Masters Fights Government on Gambling Regulations</p>
<p>Premier League’s new boss, Richard Masters, will challenge the government on a blanket ban that targets t-shirt sports betting partnership. The EPL has so far resisted attempts to have the government limit advertising space or the League’s teams’ right to sell advertising spots to the highest bidder, including sports betting companies known as bookmakers.</p>
<p>Even though soccer teams have not been openly embracing gambling culture, teams in the EPL have been carrying the logos of numerous betting companies, with 21 teams now in a gambling deal with a gambling company.</p>
<h1>ligajudi #EPL Klik https://t.co/7KTgE1FwD0 : The Premier League is delighted to confirm Richard Masters as Chief Executive with immediate effect. His appointment was approved at a special meeting of Shareholders held today: https://t.co/kNHp5CyDoG pic.twitter.com/tC1wkZ3Sti pic.twitter.com/KkM5Ub67yU — Klasemen EPL (@klasemenEPL) December 13, 2019</h1>
<p>Speaking to The Guardian, a respected daily newspaper in the UK, Masters explained that the Premier League stance didn’t come from a position of hubris: “We are not sniffy or judgmental about gambling at all.” Sports and gambling, he explained, had a long history of association.</p>
<p>Every Soccer Team Can Decide for Itself</p>
<p>Elaborating on his motivation, Masters explained that it was up to individual clubs to decide for themselves what partnerships they considered necessary or financially justified.</p>
<p>Masters explained that while the EPL itself didn’t have partnerships with gambling, and didn’t offer things such as watching bet rights, for example, it was entirely up to each individual club to sign up partnerships with whomever they felt was justified. However, the EPL signed a global betting data deal in May, 2019.</p>
<p>However, this is at odds with the Conservative Party’s current plans, with the Tories planning to take a closer look at the 2005 Gambling Act and revisit a number of issues, including advertising. The Act will undergo a thorough review to better reflect the rapidly-changing gambling industry and the shift towards online channels of gambling and advertisement.</p>
<p>Soccer, though, as the single most watched sport in the United Kingdom, will come under tight scrutiny and specifically insofar any existing betting partnerships go. Betting companies in the country already agreed upon a pre-watershed ban on TV adverts containing gambling messages during live sport events in 2018.</p>
<p>Masters Ready to Support Gambling Act Overhaul</p>
<p>Despite his opposition towards the betting t-shirt sponsorship ban, Masters is quite willing to throw EPL’s weight behind the overhaul of the Gambling Act.</p>
<p>The 10th annual review of Premier League shirt deals, by @alexmiller73, shows the collective value for 2019-20 has risen to £349.1m. Man Utd well ahead of the pack. See small print for details. pic.twitter.com/6exHYAeMfS — Nick Harris (@sportingintel) July 17, 2019</p>
<p>“We’ll be welcome participants in that,” he noted. However, he cautioned that the result of the Gambling Act revision shouldn’t be that clubs can no longer sign agreements with betting companies.</p>
<p>Nearly every big name in English soccer presently has signed a partnership with a betting companies, to name Manchester City, Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Tottenham, and many others.</p>
