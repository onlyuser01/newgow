    <h1>Treasure Island Ti Hotel Casino A Radisson Hotel Casino Free Slot Games Stratosphere Casino Hotel To</h1>

<p>Dear Vanessa10,</p>
<p>But it was done with a bonus in the past, by both linked accounts and in the same way in March playing Pragmatic games. As for your question - it is not unusual for a player to play in the same way on different devices. To be more exact, the same time was meant like the same day or the same period when both accounts were fully active. In addition, it is possible only by registering and using multiple accounts.</p>
<p>"Can't you play the same games and try the same play strategies, seeing that it was working for one, who knows, it might not work for the other? This was the way we played, so only one device per IP can own the casino? If there are more people in the household, can only one download the 7 slots app?"</p>
<p>Yes, you can if such a play does not breach the casino's terms and conditions. No, you cannot play the same games and try the same strategies if it means bonus or casino system abuse, especially, if it was done by 2 accounts from 1 household. However, we are talking about the activity that was made in March 2023, which caused a violation of the casino's rules/bonus abuse.</p>
<p>As was mentioned, we are able to accept more than one account in the same household and the same IP in specific circumstances, but not if there are too many matches in play patterns, as well as the way both accounts abused the bonuses. If only one account used a bonus, it would be a different story. The applied rules were created exactly against such situations and possible multiple accounts/bonus abuse. Furthermore, the main issue there are matches that indicate that both accounts were used by 1 person, therefore, it falls under the rule about using only 1 bonus per player/IP/household/device/etc.</p>
<p>If there were 2 individuals playing separately with the linked accounts, can you please explain how is it possible your CPF number was used in both accounts?</p>
