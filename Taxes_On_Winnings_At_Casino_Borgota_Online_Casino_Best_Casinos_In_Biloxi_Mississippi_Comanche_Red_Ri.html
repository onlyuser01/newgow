<p>The Cityzens Have a Busy Schedule Ahead</p>
<p>Manchester City is the reigning champion of the Premier League, but retaining the title won’t be easy. It’s because Arsenal is currently topping the table, showing no signs of slowing down. Manchester City also competes in the FA Cup, where they’ve reached the semifinal.</p>

<p>Still, their No. 1 focus is the Champions League, which is a competition the Sky Blues are yet to win. With Pep Guardiola in charge, they’ve won pretty much everything apart from the UCL. Oddsmakers, however, think they might do it this season.</p>
<p>It’s because their roster looks stronger than ever. They have at least two great players for every position on the pitch. Still, their brightest star in the 2022-23 season is their scoring machine, Erling Haaland. This guy is the scoring leader in the Premier League, as well as in the Champions League.</p>
<p>German Champions Putting Their Hopes in Thomas Tuchel</p>
<p>Thomas Tuchel is the new coach of Bayern Munich. He made his debut in the dugout of the German champion on the first day of April when we saw his boys beat Dortmund 4-2 in Der Klassiker. The win has given a massive boost of confidence to Bayern’s fans who now believe their boys can with the Champions League.</p>
<p>Another reason behind their optimism is that Tuchel is a manager who’s already led one team to the title. It happened two years ago when he was in charge of Chelsea. The Tuchel-led Blues won the trophy after defeating Manchester City in the final.</p>
<p>Manchester City vs. Bayern Munich Prediction</p>
<p>You can be sure that Manchester City players and management will take this game very seriously. They need to win on Tuesday, preferably by a decent margin so that they wouldn’t have to fear their trip to Munich in a week’s time.</p>
<p>Pick: Manchester City to win &amp; over 2.5 goals</p>
