<p>Gaming Corps will continue to reach new audiences and operators with the help of Alea, a dedicated aggregation platform that pulls select third-party content and distributes it among its partners. The partnership proves a significant boost to Gaming Corps’ ability to leverage its product with new players and operators who may be interested in strengthening their libraries with innovative content.</p>
<p>Gaming Crops runs a long selection of possible games that players may choose from, including Crash, Mine, Table, Slot, Plinko, and more. Among the more notable releases the company has produced over the past months and years are Raging Zeus Mines, Jet Lucky, Coin Miner, and others, all of which are marked by the company’s signature style, attention to detail, and faithfulness to building an effortless gameplay experience.</p>
<p>Gaming Corps has also been going it alone in the meantime, ensuring a string of partnerships designed to expand its reach in numerous markets. The company teamed up with Brazino777 in Belarus and with Betway in Africa. A similar partnership was established with Lottoland late last year.</p>
<p>Commenting on this fresh opportunity with Alea, Gaming Corps Director of Sales Mats Lundin said that he was very happy with the opportunity to bring the company’s selection of games to what is considered one of the leading aggregators in the world.</p>
<p>"Alea’s team has taken a perfect step towards the future of iGaming by adding our diverse and growing portfolio," Lundin noted.</p>
<p>Alea Game Manager Eduard Verdaguer was similarly happy with the arrangement and said that hosting Gaming Corps’ products will be beneficial to partners and their players who are keen to explore more innovative and engaging content. Alea similarly added Thunderkick as one of the supported studios several months back.</p>
<p>Gaming Corps has built a name for itself by borrowing heavily from the video gaming industry in terms of the technology and visualizations it uses to make sure that its games stand out by virtue of their features and graphics. The company has released dozens of innovative games across multiple categories designed to further add to the level of fun that players can get.</p>
