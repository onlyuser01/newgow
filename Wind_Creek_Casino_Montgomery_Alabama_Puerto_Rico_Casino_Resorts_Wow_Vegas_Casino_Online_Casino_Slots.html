<p>Joining forces with Consumers Energy, the premier casino and entertainment location agreed to source 100% of its electricity from renewable sources</p>
<p>Using renewable energy and growing sustainably while decreasing carbon emissions is an ongoing goal for businesses across the United States and around the world. Amid concerns about the negative impact of human activities on environmental processes, many businesses shift their focus to sustainable development and growth. This is exactly what Michigan’s premier gaming and entertaining venue, FireKeepers Casino Hotel, committed to by announcing a new partnership with the public utility that offers natural gas and electricity to nearly 7 million residents in Michigan, Consumers Energy.</p>
<p>As announced by the Battle Creek Enquirer, the duo forged a new partnership, allowing the premier entertainment and gaming location to source 100% of its electricity from power sources that are renewable. The collaboration sees FireKeepers Casino join Consumers’ Renewable Energy Program. As the latest member of the program, the casino and entertainment location join a growing list of more than two dozen businesses that have already teamed up with Consumers.</p>
<p>The innovative and forward-looking program enables companies and businesses to match the energy they use to renewable sources such as ones from solar and wind energy. Currently, FireKeepers Casino uses approximately 31,527 megawatt-hours annually, all of which will be matched with renewable energy sources, reaffirming the venue’s commitment to sustainable growth and environmental responsibility.</p>
<p>The Premier Entertainment and Casino Location Leads by Example</p>
<p>Eric Clinton, Consumers’ director of renewable products, praised the latest collaboration with FireKeepers Casino. He explained: “This commitment is meaningful in many ways. It accelerates our clean energy journey, allowing us to retire our coal facilities within the next two years and run a carbon-neutral power grid by 2040.”</p>
<p>Frank Tecumseh, FireKeepers Casino’s CEO, was similarly delighted. He outlined that the collaboration reaffirms the venue’s commitment to a better future.</p>
<p>Tecumseh added that FireKeepers is the first tribal casino operator in Michigan to commit to such a program. Finally, he said they hope that this action will help push other tribal and commercial operators to commit to renewable energy programs.</p>
<p>Ultimately, FireKeepers Casino’s commitment to the program will help decrease greenhouse gas emissions in Michigan. Their efforts are the equivalent of recycling some 13,500 garbage trucks or the removal of a staggering 61,000 gas-powered transportation vehicles from the roads.</p>
