    <h1>Charlestown Racetrack And Casino Choctaw Casino Durant Oklahoma Hollywood Casino Stl World S Biggest</h1>

<p>Rank Group, operator of Grosvenor Casinos and Mecca Bingo venues in the UK, as well as Enracha bingo clubs in Spain, announced today a new addition to its Board of Directors with the appointment of Katie McAlister as a non-executive director.</p>
<p>Appointment with Immediate Effect</p>
<p>Appointed with immediate effect, non-executive director Katie McAlister will also serve on the nominations, safer gambling and remuneration committees of the board at Rank Group.</p>
<p>“We are delighted to welcome Katie to the Rank board. Her extensive background in digital marketing, together with her customer-focussed strategic experience, will be a real asset. The board and I are very much looking forward to working with her over the coming years.” Alex Thursby, Chairman, Board of Directors, Rank Group</p>
<p>Currently, McAlister serves as the chief marketing officer at TUI Northern Region, being responsible for sales and marketing efforts in the UK, Ireland and the Nordic markets – Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Finland – while also sitting on the board of directors at the tour operator’s northern division.</p>
<p>Experience in Digital Transformation</p>
<p>Katie McAlister has 13 years of digital and marketing experience under her belt and expertise from leading programs for digital transformations and business change, Rank Group noted in the regulatory announcement for directorate change.</p>
<p>Rank confirmed that, under the requirements of Listing Rule 9.6.13R in relation to the appointment of the new member of the board, there is no information to be disclosed.</p>
<p>Katie McAlister’s appointment to the Board of Directors of the London Stock Exchange-listed company followed in the footsteps of Chew Seong Aun, who was appointed as a non-executive director in December last year to succeed Tang Hong Cheong who spent 2 years at the board.</p>
<p>Severely Impacted First Quarter</p>
<p>The operator of 52 Grosvenor Casinos and 77 licensed Mecca bingo venues in the UK was significantly impacted by nationwide property closures in the past few months.</p>
<p>Last month, Rank Group released a trading update for the first quarter ended March 31, 2021 – a three-month period during which all UK venues of the group were closed. Consequently, Venue revenue sank by 97%, leading to a 76% decrease in total net gaming revenue compared to the first three months in 2020. Revenue from Digital was only 3% down.</p>
