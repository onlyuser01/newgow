<p>Razor Returns review</p>
<p>Razor Returns is a shark-themed online slot game from Push Gaming. The game is a sequel to the hugely popular Razor Shark slot.</p>
<p>Players dive deep beneath the ocean and spend some time with a menacing pack of sharks as they bid to land some big prizes.</p>
<p>Win in the base game of the Razor Reveal slot</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The original Razor Shark slot was a huge hit for the studio, and Push has largely stuck with the same design. The reels are set deep beneath the water, with a group of menacing-looking sharps making up the higher-paying symbols on the grid.</p>
<p>The sharks have a cartoonish design, invoking memories of the popular Finding Nemo movies. There is nothing friendly about these creatures though, with the bite of the sharks being matched by the game’s biting gameplay.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Razor Returns looks scary, but the base game keeps things nice and simple.</p>
<p>The slot is played on a five-by-five grid, with the slot having 40 active paylines on each spin. Winning combinations are formed when players land matching combinations of three or more symbols across a payline, starting on the leftmost reel.</p>

<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Razor Returns slot game really comes to life with its bonus features.</p>
<p>The first you are likely to encounter is the Mystery Symbol bonus. On any spin, Mystery Symbols, which are displayed as ocean plants, can land and reveal a matching symbol. These Mystery Symbols appear stacked and are then nudged down the reels in one position on each subsequent spin. To make this more exciting, the Mystery Symbols will change on each spin. It is possible to have more than one stack of Mystery Symbols active.</p>
<p>One of the highest possible multipliers in the Razor Reveal bonus round</p>
<p>If the Mystery Symbols reveal a Golden Shark symbol, then the Razor Reveal bonus is activated. For this, each position will turn into a mini-reel set and will display a selection of symbols. The symbols are as follows:</p>
<p>Instant prize symbols : These display prizes between x1 and x5,000.</p>
<p>: These display prizes between x1 and x5,000. Multipliers : These can multiply the Instant Prize symbols by x2, x3, x5, or x10.</p>
<p>: These can multiply the Instant Prize symbols by x2, x3, x5, or x10. Collectors : These collect the value of all Instant Prizes. Instant Prizes are then removed once collected.</p>
<p>: These collect the value of all Instant Prizes. Instant Prizes are then removed once collected. Converter : This spins and chooses a symbol on the reels, it will then change all instances of that to a Golden Shark.</p>
<p>: This spins and chooses a symbol on the reels, it will then change all instances of that to a Golden Shark. Nudge Up: This can only land during the Free Spins bonus and will nudge Mystery Stacks back up one position.</p>
<p>Players can trigger the Free Spins round by landing three or more Tornado Scatters. Three starts the round with x1 multiplier, while four and five start with x5 and x25, respectively. Before the round starts, a Gamble Feature is presented where players can spin to start the round with higher prizes. During the round, reels two and four are filled with Mystery Symbols. Each time these nudge down, they will boost the win multiplier by one. The spins continue until there are no Mystery Stacks left on the grid.</p>
<p>Depending on your location, you may be able to buy your way into the bonus rounds for predetermined amounts.</p>
<p>Huge win with the Razor Reveal feature</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>Razor Shark has an absolutely amazing maths model. The maximum win in the game is a mouthwatering 100,000x your stake. The RTP sits at 96.55%, which is comfortably above the industry average. The slot is considered highly volatile. The max win, high RTP, and high volatility make it the perfect fit, according to our slot strategy guide.</p>
<p>Full paytable for the Razor Returns slot machine</p>
<p>Players can et between $0.10 and $100. The stake is adjusted by clicking the stack of coins icon above the spin button.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Razor Returns is one of the greatest slot games on the market. The maximum win of 100,000x your stake is incredible, and the high RTP of 96.55% and the high volatility only add to this. The slot’s bonus features complement the base game perfectly, and this manages the feat of surpassing everything that players loved about the original. We can not recommend Razor Returns enough.</p>
