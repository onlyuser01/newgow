<p>The wire transfer will inevitably come back as they have been using the wrong banking information I just realized in the meantime this all could have been avoided and over 30 calendar days now past could have all been dealt with properly if they would just do as they had agreed they would do the first time it bounced back which was send me any tracking transfer just as every other legitimate and regulated Casino does so but again more lies and more unfulfilled empty promises by this organization and of course I have been banned by them now Andree phoney responsible gaming measures my funds probably will arrive back in my account tomorrow or the day after at which time I would hope this time they could be true to their word and authorize an interact E transfer even to my girlfriends account as I have given them the option priority if they are unable to use my bank to facilitate their E Cashout method which is preposterous as again every other regulated casino he’s happily able to use interact E transfer that gets into my account within 24 hours work almost instantly PokerStars for example gets your money instantly this is a Albion over 30 calendar days no matter what they say it’s been a disaster and it is not for a small amount of money either it is causing me plenty of grief and I hope that the public is well aware of how unfairly I have been treated by this organization for simply being vocal and being persistent with the not wanting to be taken for my money and not wanting it to take any longer because unfortunately no matter what we all have commitments in this world and whether they called responsible gaming measures or not the fact that when I win money sizeable amount I committed towards certain matters even if I wish to burn it that is my business the fact that it was committed for certain matters again is stressful is problematic and it’s unfair they have been very less than facilitating in their ease is speed of transaction enclosing the alcohol and gaming commission of Ontario‘s mandate states that they are there to facilitate the prompt and accurate payment of payments via regulated casino I also have reported this case to them and as of recent they have not been able to assist me and you Casino girl have always been the gold standard in helping the players get justice and we all owe you a great duty of respect for being there on the side of the players being the voice of reason so I thank you and I hope that we will be able to facilitate an E transfer in order to get me my money when it comes back in the very near future thank you for my your time in reading my lengthy communicae.</p>
