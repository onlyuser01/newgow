<p>Neccton’s “Safe Mate” tool will assist PlayOJO to help players stay healthy and away from erratic gambling behavior.</p>
<p>PlayOJO and Neccton Continue to Build on Responsible Gambling</p>
<p>PlayOJO continues to delve deeper into responsible gambling in the United Kingdom and beyond. The SkillOnNet-powered website is rolling out the “Safe Mate” tool by Neccton, allowing players to assume more control over their gambling behavior.</p>
<p>Safe Mate is about enabling customers to easily track their total spent as well as deposits, wagers, and how much time an individual has spent playing, going as far back as six months. The tool is developed with behavioral scientists and psychologists’ assistance so that it raises red flags and resonates with consumers.</p>
<p>PlayOJO head of brand Peter Bennett spoke on behalf of the brand sharing its enthusiasm to be teaming up with a trusted tool that aims to protect consumers: “We are delighted to partner with Neccton to offer our players this state-of-the-art new Safer Gambling tool. We pride ourselves on being the fair online Casino and Bingo site and will continue to find new innovative methods and tools to help promote safe play for our customers.”</p>
<p>Safe Mate Engages Players and Offers Tracking in Real-Time</p>
<p>Safe Mate tracks player data and alarms for risk patterns as well as changes in normal gambling behavior. Neccton’s tool is also used to flag the early symptoms of problem gambling, allowing consumers to address the issue and seek professional help.</p>
<p>Neccton’s tool uses a health score and positive reinforcement to help consumers maintain a good balance. The tool is not a passive stats-board, but rather it engages consumers by asking them to guess how much they think they have spent and then reveals the actual amount spent.</p>
<p>Personalized feedback is delivered to players to try and curb problem gambling early on and flag potential issues down the road. PlayOJO is actively seeking to protect consumers, and Neccton’s addition is just one step towards achieving this end.</p>
<p>The casino, which runs both casino gaming and bingo products, has 24/7 support, self-assessments, and affordability checks as well as time limits to create a gaming environment that ultimately protects consumers and allows them to stay healthy.</p>
