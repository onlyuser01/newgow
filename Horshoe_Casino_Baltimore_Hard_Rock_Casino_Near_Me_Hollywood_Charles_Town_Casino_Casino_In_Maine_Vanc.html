<p>SBC Summit Barcelona 2023 is coming back at the Fira de Barcelona Montju√Øc with the event all intent on celebrating in style. The industry gathering, which will be taking place from September 19 through September 21, will feature five dedicated zones, with the Sports Betting Zone the first one to be highlighted by the hosts of SBC Events.</p>
<p>Barcelona will see 10,000 delegates converge on the glitzy venue to attend one of the most important events of the year and learn about the ins and outs of the industry over the past months and since the last edition of SBC Summit Barcelona. Apart from the five stages and the Sports Betting Zone, there are also seven conference stages, with delegates able to engage with that part of the industry that they enjoy the most.</p>
<p>The Sports Betting Zone will feature numerous prominent speakers and industry heavyweights, including but not limited to Sportradar, Stats Perform, BetConstruct, Delasport, EveryMatrix, LSports, Playlogiq, SIS, Soft2Bet, Altenar, and so many others.</p>
<p>SBC Founder and CEO Rasmus Sojmark was pleased with the organization so far, and expressed big expectations from the upcoming gathering:</p>
<p>"In an environment where new technologies are changing the game, things such as product selection, personalization, and smart investment, are vital. Having a dedicated zone ensures that delegates can familiarize themselves with the latest trends and strategic approaches shaping the sports betting industry."</p>
