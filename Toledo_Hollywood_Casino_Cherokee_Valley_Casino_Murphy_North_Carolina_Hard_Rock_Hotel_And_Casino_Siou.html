    <h1>Toledo Hollywood Casino Cherokee Valley Casino Murphy North Carolina Hard Rock Hotel And Casino Siou</h1>

<p>The leading global lottery operator, Allwyn, announced a groundbreaking acquisition Thursday. The company revealed it agreed to acquire Camelot Lottery Solutions group of companies (Camelot LS Group) from its current owner, Ontario Teachers.</p>
<p>This marks a significant achievement for the leading lottery operator that earlier this year was awarded the fourth UK National Lottery license. As a result of the deal, Allwyn effectively can enter the lottery market in the United States.</p>
<p>Currently, Camelot LS Group is operating the Illinois Lottery via a "private management agreement through its operating company" called Camelot Illinois LLC in collaboration with the Arkansas Scholarship Lottery.</p>
<p>In other words, the acquisition will enable Allwyn to tap into an already established market and at the same time leverage its extensive experience gained from Europe. According to the company, there are no changes planned for Camelot LS Group in light of the acquisition.</p>
<p>Once the acquisition is completed, Camelot LS Group will become one of Allwyn's wholly-owned subsidiaries. The price tag for the takeover wasn't revealed, but the acquisition is expected to be closed in Q1 of next year. As with any major acquisition, the deal is subject to necessary regulatory approvals.</p>
<p>Robert Chvátal, Allwyn's CEO, shared his excitement in a statement released on December 22, 2022, saying: "We have always viewed the US market as an important part of Allwyn's future growth story, and the acquisition of Camelot LS Group, is the right step."</p>
<p>He explained that ultimately, the company seeks to help lotteries grow and continue to raise money for good causes by taking advantage of innovative technology. At the same time, Chvátal said that those innovative technologies can help lotteries deliver safe and efficient entertainment. Finally, Allwyn's CEO pointed out: "Both Allwyn and Camelot share a passion about the lottery business, delivering value to our customers, and growing lottery returns to communities."</p>
<p>Without any doubt, Allyn is a global lottery leader. The company currently operates lotteries in different European jurisdictions including Italy, Greece and Austria, to name a few.</p>
<p>What's more, as noted, Allwyn was the operator that was awarded the fourth National Lottery license in the UK. The company competed against Camelot UK, which license is set to expire on January 31, 2024. Further strengthening its presence in the UK, Allwyn agreed to acquire Camelot UK from Ontario Teachers only recently.</p>
<p>Wayne Pickup, Camelot LS Group's Chief Executive, added: "We remain committed to serving our customers, engaging players and growing lottery revenue to benefit the communities they serve." In conclusion, the Chief Executive said: "Combining the resources, expertise, and talent of Allwyn and Camelot LS Group will only strengthen the results we help the State of Illinois and all our customers achieve."</p>
