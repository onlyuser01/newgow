<p>More industry-leading gambling operators joined an industry-led responsible gaming standards coalition formed by giants within the sector. Entain Foundation, the charity arm of Entain and one of the members of the Responsible Gambling Coalition, announced Thursday that it welcomed three new members: PointsBet, Hard Rock Digital and Fanatics Betting and Gaming.</p>
<p>The three new entrants take the number of members to a total of nine. As a result, the responsible gaming standards coalition now includes Bally's, BetMGM, DraftKings, Entain, FanDuel, MGM Resorts International, and the newest members, PointsBet, Hard Rock Digital and Fanatics Betting and Gaming, a statement reveals.</p>
<p>The coalition was formed in September in an effort to establish industry-led responsible gaming standards. Overall, members vowed support for a total of 12 principles. At the same time, coalition members submit reports on their activities and their commitment is reviewed by an external expert panel. The monitoring of the experts also helps with the development of the companies' responsible gaming strategies and provides strategic guidance.</p>
<p>The launch of different responsible gaming tools, information via websites, as well as the appointments of Responsible Gaming Ambassadors, are only a few of the principles. Members of the coalition also vow commitment to a "unified, nationwide responsible gaming toll-free helpline, and continue to advocate for its adoption."</p>
<p>Per the initiative, the Responsible Gambling Coalition members contribute toward research by establishing partnerships with leading experts within the vertical. Additionally, members join forces with the National Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG), among other requirements.</p>
<p>Danny Crook, Hard Rock Digital's SVP of Operations, commented on the topic in a statement saying: "Hard Rock Digital is pleased to have this opportunity to collaborate with our fellow operators to promote and maintain an industry-wide atmosphere of responsible gambling." Finally, he noted: "We're committed to serving our players with educational tools, resources, and support to ensure a safe and enjoyable online gaming experience."</p>
<p>Anthony D'Angelo, Fanatics Betting &amp; Gaming's Sr. Manager, Responsible Gaming, added: "We are proud to collaborate and partner with our industry colleagues." Last but not least, he pointed out that the company is committed to adhering to the 12 responsible gaming principles and delivering fun and safe entertainment for its users.</p>
<p>Rachel Kasper, PointsBet US' SVP of Legal and Compliance, added that the company is delighted to reaffirm its commitment to responsible gaming by joining the Responsible Gambling Coalition. "Responsible gambling is a core priority for our business and requires meaningful collaboration with all stakeholders, inclusive of operators competing within the same markets, to promote this aspect of our industry and ensure safe practices are followed," she said in conclusion.</p>
