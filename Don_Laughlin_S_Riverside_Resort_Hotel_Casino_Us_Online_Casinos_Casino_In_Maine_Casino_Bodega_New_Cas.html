<p>Strafe Esports, the self-described leading destination for all things esports, has forayed into the Netherlands after receiving the necessary approvals. The launch will help the affiliate brand expand its overall presence in Europe as it seeks to enter more markets.</p>
<p>Strafe Esports Launches in the Netherlands</p>
<p>Strafe is a sports betting affiliate that offers various esports-related content, including esports news, reviews data and analytics. Thanks to the Netherlands launch, Dutch esports enthusiasts will be able to access the company’s premium esports offerings and take their esports engagement further.</p>
<p>Strafe noted that it has been very eager to join the Netherlands, which it considers a top European market. While the company used to target primarily English-speaking countries, it has now opted to expand its business with localized content in other countries with a lot of esports fans and legal esports betting markets.</p>
<p>For example, the company, which was strictly oriented toward an English-speaking audience, now supplies the German, Swedish and Japanese markets with its premium esports and esports betting content.</p>
<p>The launch in the Netherlands is in line with the company’s expansion strategy and will allow Strafe to expand its global footprint. Strafe is currently expanding its offer as well by adding more traditional sports content, as well as casino and sports betting tips.</p>
<p>The Dutch Market Attracts Many Companies</p>
<p>Ever since its re-regulation in October 2021, the Netherlands has been one of the most appealing iGaming markets in Europe. When the new gambling laws kicked in, the Dutch regulator kicked out many non-compliant operators.</p>
<p>Upon the market’s launch, only ten operators and a handful of suppliers were allowed in the country. Since then, the Kansspelautoriteit, the Netherlands’ gambling authority, issued online gambling licenses to a dozen other companies.</p>
<p>The latest company to join the list of approved operators is Holland Gaming, which received a license two days ago. Just before that, Smart Gaming also received its license to offer iGaming in the Netherlands. A week prior to that, the Kansspelautoriteit licensed Tulipa Ent, a subsidiary of the influential ComeOn Group. Some of the companies are yet to announce the official domains under which they will operate in the Netherlands. The Kansspelautoriteit will write the official domains down in the Kansspelwijzer as soon as the operators announce them.</p>
<p>In other news, the regulator just launched a new Prevention of Gambling Addiction program as it aims to curb problem gaming rates in the country.</p>
