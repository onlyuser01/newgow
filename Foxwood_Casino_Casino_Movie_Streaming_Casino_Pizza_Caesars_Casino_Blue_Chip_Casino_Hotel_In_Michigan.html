<p>If you need more details, keep reading our fresh review to know all about the theme, graphics, animations, sounds, gameplay, and features of this Irish-themed slot with a cheerful vibe to it.</p>
<p>Theme, Storyline, and Graphics: Welcome to the Land of Leprechauns</p>
<p>The suggestive title gives away the general theme of this slot. Players who are passionate about Irish-themed slots that follow the cheerful leprechauns on their quests to look for gold are going to appreciate Genesis Gaming’s release.</p>
<p>The cute creatures that wear a lot of green are known to be cheerful and rich. One of their greatest passions is to constantly collect new pots of gold that are usually hidden at the end of the rainbows, hence the attraction for these games. Genesis Gaming has done an excellent job of capturing this theme in the action of the game in a way that makes it stand out from the rest of the games of its kind that are currently out on the market.</p>
<p>Right off the bat, new players are going to notice the particularly appealing design of the game and the premium quality of the graphic elements which are superior compared to the graphics embedded in other games. The game looks fresh and modern despite being launched in 2016.</p>
<p>As expected, different types of leprechauns are at the core of the design and storyline, together with pots of gold, jewelry, lucky clovers, rainbows, and playing cards with a special Celtic twist added to their design.</p>
<p>The background is represented by a beautiful forest inhabited by leprechauns, with the sun trying to sneak a peek through the rich foliage and the fog about to make an appearance as extra touches of design.</p>
<p>Leprechaun Legends: Game Symbols and Payouts</p>
<p>In terms of symbols, the grid is packed with the standard set of icons designed with the previously mentioned Celtic ornaments where the lowest-paying symbols are the royal cards from 9 through A.</p>
<p>The highest-paying symbols are represented by four leprechauns, each playing a different musical instrument: a drum, an accordion, a guitar, and a violin.</p>
<p>The game has the four-leaf golden clover as a wild symbol that can also prove to be the most lucrative symbol in the game when at least five matching icons are seen landing on the reels. When this occurs, the game’s logo will pop on the screen while rewarding players with a win of 50x the initial bet.</p>
<p>Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>Thanks to the transparent reels, all symbols are made to appear as they are floating up in the air, letting players catch a glimpse at the gorgeous scenery in the background that is constantly evolving. The animations are also visible when the spinning symbols on the reels finally land and they create sarking effects when wins are created. The slot features fun, upbeat Irish folk music to keep the fun going during the simple gameplay.</p>
<p>Leprechaun Legends Gameplay</p>
<p>The game is easy to play as all commands are found in a separate menu when clicking the question mark below the main screen that is dedicated to the actual reels There, players will have a chance to read the detailed rules of the game and also open the additional settings that will allow them to select their wager and betting lines with the available switches.</p>
<p>The game counts five reels encompassing three symbols and a 50 payline display, giving players numerous win possibilities all across the screen. All wins pay left to right on adjacent reels and all wins are paid on lines paid, except for scatters which are added to win lines.</p>

<p>Leprechaun Legends: Pot of Gold, Luck o’the Irish &amp; Legendary Songs</p>
<p>The slot has a series of excellent special features that can be gradually activated during gameplay for some spectacular wins.</p>
<p>Pot of Gold Feature</p>
<p>To activate this feature, players must land at least one pot of gold symbol on reels from two to five while the rainbow symbols are popping on the first reel. At the start of the Pot of Gold feature, each of the pots of gold symbols will display various cash prizes which can be multiplied up to 10x. The feature can only be activated before the Luck O’ the Irish feature is engaged. The feature can be activated during the base game as well as while engaged in the bonus game free spins.</p>
<p>Luck O’ the Irish Feature</p>
<p>This feature is initiated when a minimum of two scatters are seen showing on the reels simultaneously. During the feature, all the reels with scatter symbols on them will preserve their position during the re-spins. The remaining reels will keep re-spinning for the chance to add extra free spins on the reels and trigger a bonus.</p>
<p>Legendary Songs Free Spins Feature</p>
<p>This side game can be triggered when the player lands at least three scatters at the same time. If the Legendary Songs Free Spins bonus feature is activated with three scatters, the player is rewarded with seven bonus spins. Coming across four scatters will trigger 10 free spins while landing four scatters will generate 15 bonus free spins.</p>
<p>While the leprechaun symbol can show up randomly on any reel except for the first one, turning into a sticky wild that will not change its position throughout the duration of this feature. When a minimum of two leprechauns are still visible on all four reels at the end of one of the free bonus rounds, the player receives two additional bonus rounds. When this occurs, the respective symbols will no longer keep their initial position and they will also deactivate their wild symbol properties. While engaged in the free spins, the leprechaun symbol is able to lock or unlock its position more than a single time.</p>
<p>Final Thoughts</p>
<p>With an eye-catching leprechaun theme with mesmerizing symbols and graphic elements, cool features with free spins and other bounties, and simple and pleasant gameplay, Leprechaun Legends is a Genesis Gaming slot worth a try.</p>
