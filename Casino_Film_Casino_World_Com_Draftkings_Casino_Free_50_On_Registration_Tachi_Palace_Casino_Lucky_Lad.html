<p>International betting and gaming giant Entain has published interesting soccer statistics, probing into the passions of fans ahead of the World Cup tournament in Qatar. The operator checked which fans are the most likely to bet on their national team to win the event.</p>
<p>Entain Checked Fans’ Patriotism</p>
<p>As it turns out, Brazilian soccer enthusiasts are the most patriotic, with 50% of them betting on Brazil to become the World Champion. The LATAM country is already famous for its soccer traditions and has previously won the World Cup five times.</p>
<p>Next up is Portugal, where 41% of bettors have wagered money on their national team. Canadians come in third with 30% of bettors betting on their national team. This is an exciting moment for the North American country, which hasn’t had the chance to play in the World Cup for the last 36 years.</p>
<p>Fans of the United Kingdom are somewhat likely to support the English team. As reported by Entain, 18% of British punters rely on England to grab the cup. Meanwhile, 2% of British bettors put their hopes on the Welsh team. While Brits are rather reserved about the Welsh team, they are much more optimistic about Argentina and Brazil, with 15% betting on the first country to become the champion and another 15% betting on the latter.</p>
<p>Lastly, Entain noted that Spanish bettors are quite pessimistic about their team’s performance and more likely to “opt for head over heart.” According to the operator, only 9% of bettors in the country have so far wagered on the Spanish team.</p>
<p>The Operator Is Preparing for the World Cup</p>
<p>Entain’s chief commercial officer, Dominic Grounsell, spoke about the results. He noted that it’s great to see so many fans excited about the start of the biggest event in professional soccer. He added that he is glad Entain’s scale and influence have allowed it to explore the moods of punters around the world and provide them with exciting betting opportunities.</p>
<p>We’re looking forward to the excitement that a World Cup brings for our customers. Dominic Grounsell, CCO, Entain</p>
<p>Ahead of the World Cup’s start, Entain and its brands are preparing to provide fans with innovative and engaging soccer experiences. In the United Kingdom, the company’s Ladbrokes brand unveiled a new Half Time Quiz, which is an unprecedented free-to-play game. Half Time Quiz players will, during the halftime interval of a match, answer a few questions concerning the first half of the game. The game will make sure that the most attentive players are awarded.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Eurobet is running its own virtual World Cup where the Italian team, which failed to qualify for the real World Cup, will have a presence. Thanks to this, patriotic bettors in Italy will also get to support their team in a way.</p>
<p>Lastly, Entain launched a new content hub where soccer fans can find everything they need to know about the World Cup. The site will include match previews, reviews, news and insights and will be accessible from Entain’s sportsbook apps in Portugal, Belgium, Brazil, the US, Canada and Australia.</p>
