<p>Welcome to our DraftKings Sportsbook review where we take a full good look at the leading sports betting platform in the United States. DraftKings is, without a doubt, a household name in the sports betting ecosystem. It started as a purveyor of daily fantasy sports, but the company had evolved into mainstream sports betting offers as of August 2018 when the first DraftKings Sportsbook opened doors in New Jersey as part of the re-regulated market.</p>
<p>Today we will talk about what the operator has to offer, starting with the DraftKings Sportsbook app, variety of sports, bonuses, and other features that give sports bettors a fantastic overall online wagering experience. Available in over 11 sports betting states today, DraftKings is quickly adding to its clout, bringing some exciting offers in professional, college, and daily fantasy sports!</p>
<p>We made sure to review DraftKings Sportsbook in its entirety and bring you a full and detailed breakdown of everything it has to offer – from the first deposit to the mobile experience. Let’s get started.</p>
<p>DraftKings Sportsbook Offers</p>
<p>DraftKings is a bit cut-and-dry when it comes to promotions, and this is definitely not a bad thing. For the most part, you will have access to the first deposit bonus, which is quite neat. In some states, the sportsbook will offer a $50 risk-free bet, and you will often run into various odds boosts that add a bit of excitement to your gameplay through and through!</p>
<p>We made sure to collaborate with our team across the United States for our DraftKings review and visited all existing online sportsbook geolocations to pull up a full list of the available DraftKings offers. Here is what we found.</p>
<p>DraftKings Welcome Bonus: $500 and $1,000</p>
<p>With a massive footprint in the online sports betting landscape in the United States, DraftKings has a lot to offer. The sportsbook’s sign-up bonus is a mighty tempting affair. You will get either $500 or $1,000 in welcome funds and be able to spend it on your favorite mainstream sports. Let’s talk about the $500 bonus first.</p>
<p>DraftKings First Time Depositors: $500</p>
<p>To qualify, you need to place only place $5 on your first deposit to trigger the bonus and no, there is no promo code you need to use to activate the bonus. Instead, you just deposit, and your deposit is matched at a rate of 20% up to $500.</p>
<p>In other words, to receive the full sign-up bonus amount, you need to place $2,500 on your first deposit. It’s a bit steep at first glance, but definitely, nothing to worry about. DraftKings has over 5 million customers across the United States, making it one of the most trusted sportsbooks out there, and its deposit bonus is just as much!</p>
<p>Another interesting aspect of the deposit bonus is that you release the bonus in a slightly different fashion than at most sportsbooks. DraftKings will let you have $1 worth of bonus money for every $25 you bet across daily fantasy sports and professional sports.</p>
<p>It’s a neat way to roll through the bonus. The added benefit is that you don’t have to worry about meeting specific fixed odds like with most other online sportsbooks. Instead, all you need to do is clear the wagering requirement within 90 days, which is the deadline stated in DraftKings Sportsbook’s terms and conditions.</p>
<p>DraftKings Sportsbook $1,000 Bonus</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that the welcome bonus offer was reduced from $1,000 to $500 in some states in 2021. This is entirely for DraftKings to decide, but if you do happen to own multiple accounts across states and bet from different places in the United States, don’t be surprised to see that the bonus tends to shift across state lines!</p>
<p>The $1,000 deposit is actually pretty straightforward. The terms and conditions overlap in full with the existing $500 deposit match. New users will always find it easy to navigate the bonus offer as the terms and conditions make sure to explain everything in detail.</p>
<p>Get a Free Bet up to $100</p>
<p>A great addition to DraftKings Sportsbook is the $100 free bet that will make sure you are having a proper start of your betting experience with the operator. The bonus is actually a Refer a Friend offer and to benefit from it, your friend must follow your referral link, register, and deposit at least $25!</p>
<p>There are only five referral options per bonus period, but the bonus is refreshed regularly, so you can keep bringing your friends so long as they don’t already have a DraftKings Sportsbook account.</p>
<p>More DraftKings Offers to Benefit From</p>
<p>There are tons of excellent DraftKings offers to take advantage of. Sports bettors will find numerous opportunities to enjoy odds boosts a first bet that is often risk-free, adding to the ability to enjoy a safer overall sports betting experience. Naturally, you always have to read the fine script in DraftKings Sportsbook, not least because some bonuses expire.</p>
<p>The bonus conditions will also change from one state to the next, so make sure that you pore over that sign-up bonus before you redeem it. Whether it’s a $1,000 deposit bonus or $500, you can rest assured that DraftKings always makes it easy for sports fans, risk-free bet or no risk-free bet.</p>
<p>One promotion you may be interested in exploring is the Daily Free to Play Pools, which require no financial commitment on your end and run every 24 hours for a shot at winning something extra. You can study these as well on top of any fantasy, deposit, or free bet DraftKings has ready for you. Just pick the contest you enjoy and enter for free daily!</p>
<p>Where Can You Bet on Sports with DraftKings?</p>
<p>DraftKings Sportsbook is gathering momentum in the United States, and there seems no way of stopping it. As one of the main competitors in the market, the company does want to be first in securing positions in every state that has legalized its online sports betting industry at the very least.</p>
<p>First, that was New Jersey in 2018, but things have changed, and DraftKing’s footprint has grown exponentially ever since. The operator’s stated goal is clear, and it wants to have a presence in every state that has legalized retail and mobile sports betting. While the offer will overlap from one state to the next, DraftKings has found ways to customize the experience a little further.</p>
<p>DraftKings Colorado</p>
<p>DraftKings Colorado is one of the latest sportsbooks to open doors with the Centennial State giving an official go-ahead in 2020 and DraftKings opening doors on May 1, 2020. The operator brought a traditional experience to the state, launching the $1,000 deposit bonus and offering a fully-fledged sportsbook app that works on both iOS and Android devices.</p>
<p>DraftKings Michigan</p>
<p>DraftKings Michigan is the most likely first move for the company in 2021. With Michigan on the cusp of launching online sports betting at the time of writing, DraftKings Sportsbook has wasted no effort. The sports betting app is already hovering on the MI welcome screen, and you can get a preliminary deposit bonus worth $100.</p>
<p>Now, the best part is that you can also get $100 in free bets, which is pretty excellent, and a different strategy DraftKings is deploying with regards to its offers. Interestingly, the bonus comes with a 1x rollover requirement, making for a rather different approach to the bonus system in the Great Lakes State.</p>
<p>Once DraftKings opens doors officially, though, this offer will most likely be replaced with the type of offers you can find in all other states instead.</p>
<p>DraftKings Iowa</p>
<p>DraftKings is also up and running in Iowa, bringing a quality sports betting product and daily fantasy platform in the Hawkeye State. Sports bettors are quite welcome to a whole host of bet types, extra promotions and can take advantage of competitive odds calculated in real-time to provide you with an edge over all other sportsbooks in the state.</p>
<p>Iowa just suspended its mandatory in-person registration rule at the beginning of 2021, making mobile sports betting in the state a little easier! You can now claim $1,000 free in bonus cash by signing up remotely.</p>
<p>DraftKings Illinois</p>
<p>Illinois was a bit of a crossroad for DraftKings, which had to put in some additional effort to make it in the legal sports betting ecosystem of the state. Not too many states have gone after DraftKings and its main competitor, FanDuel, alleging they were bad actors.</p>
<p>Yet, Illinois is one of those states that decided to go after sportsbooks that had offered daily fantasy sports prior to the legalization of the state’s sports betting framework, and DraftKings was one of those.</p>
<p>As a result, DraftKings had to wait 18 months before it became available. During that time the state passed a mandatory in-person amendment, reinforced in-person registration again, and then finally decided to scrap it altogether!</p>
<p>The long and short of it is that Illinois sports fans can register remotely and claim DraftKings Sportsbook sign-up bonus as the operator is now fully up and running!</p>
<p>DraftKings Indiana</p>
<p>Indiana was one of the early entries for DraftKings Sportsbook. The company found an early window of opportunity, joining the market in October 2019 and roaring ahead at full blast ever since. The state’s sportsbook is a quintessential example of what DraftKings is all about.</p>
<p>The mobile app is always there and handy, and the overall rating is definitely good. You have plenty of real money sports wagering options and bet types to benefit from in Indiana, too.</p>
<p>DraftKings New Jersey</p>
<p>New Jersey is the original state. When sports betting went legal in the United States, New Jersey was the first to welcome sportsbooks, and not surprisingly, DraftKings was among the first to join the rush.</p>
<p>The sportsbook teamed up with the Lago Resort &amp; Casino in Waterloo in the Garden State and has been running an online sportsbook as well as a retail offer. DraftKings has been continuously growing its footprint in the state, allowing sports fans to take advantage of some excellent betting markets, including electronic sports, daily fantasy, professional competitions, and NCAA.</p>
<p>DraftKings New Hampshire</p>
<p>New Hampshire is the sweet spot for DraftKings. The Granite State and DraftKings Sports negotiated early on in the legalization granting the full sportsbook monopoly on sports in the jurisdiction. While this would have been outraged in places such as Pennsylvania or New Jersey, New Hampshire has made it work.</p>
<p>The market is not too big per se, but it still has 1.3 million people, and costs around $5 million in sports wagering handle monthly. Of course, it’s located close to Massachusetts and Maine, which don’t have their own sportsbooks, so New Hampshire has been able to attract some cross-state revenue, which has benefited the DraftKings Sportsbook.</p>
<p>This is changing, though, as both mentioned states are in the process of establishing their own sportsbook.</p>
<p>DraftKings New York</p>
<p>The Empire State is in serious talk to legalize mobile sports wagering, and this is great news for everyone, including DraftKings. The sportsbook has a brick-and-mortar partnership with the del Lago Resort and Casino but should Gov. Cuomo decides to back multiple skin-holders, an online sportsbook is a possibility!</p>
<p>DraftKings Pennsylvania</p>
<p>DraftKings Sportsbook made it just on time for the NFL Season in 2019 entering the Keystone State on time to bank on the sports betting action and doing so successfully. Online sports betting took a while to launch in Pennsylvania, but when it finally did, there were dozens of license holders waiting, with DraftKings clearly one of them.</p>
<p>DraftKings’ offer saw strong interest from fans with the state playing host to numerous high-profile franchises, including the Pittsburgh Steelers. You can claim $500 in sign-up bonus in Pennsylvania and bet on various college basketball, football and professional sports events.</p>
<p>DraftKings Tennessee</p>
<p>Tennessee is one of the latest launches for DraftKings Sportsbook with the website going live on November 1, 2020. Admittedly, DraftKings took its time as the Tennessee Lottery Board was establishing the ground rules for participating in online betting contests and mobile apps. DraftKings is going up against hefty competition from numerous other operators, including Action 247, FanDuel, and quite naturally, BetMGM.</p>
<p>DraftKings West Virginia</p>
<p>West Virginia is another excellent jurisdiction in which DraftKings has set up shop. You get access to the dedicated DraftKings app and naturally the $1,000 bonus to bet on sports. WV had a law to legalize sports betting earlier than New Jersey defeated PASPA in 2018, but mobile sports betting only began launching on August 28, 2019, when DraftKings Sportsbook launched its own product in the state.</p>
<p>How to Register and Play at DraftKings Sports?</p>
<p>Registering at DraftKings is very simple. While most other sportsbooks use “skins,” DraftKings is pretty much unique across state borders, and a single account will be sufficient to play from anywhere in the United States where it’s legal to bet on sports.</p>

<p>DraftKings Sportsbook App</p>
<p>As part of our DraftKings review, we took the necessary time to review the sportsbook app. A neat little piece of technology, the mobile app works just fine on iOS and Android allowing new users and sports fans to benefit from the company’s powerful solutions.</p>

<p>Bet Types and Options</p>
<p>DraftKings Sportsbook offers all sorts of excellent bet types. The main ones include moneyline, total points, and point spread. Yet, there is more, including prop bets, halves, quarters, game and team props, as well as team futures and fantasy points.

<p>For example, hockey lists correct score, 60 min props, player futures, and awards. DraftKings Sportsbook is free to customize the selection of the betting market in any way it sees fit, and this adds flexibility to the overall offer.</p>

DraftKings specifically keeps its support centers separate for all three of its main verticals, including family fantasy and professional sports and casinos.</p>
<p>You can get in touch by sending your questions directly to [email protected] or starting a live chat with the customer care service.</p>
<p>DraftKings Sportsbook: Why Register Here?</p>
<p>There are many inherent upsides of picking this operator, and our sportsbook review of DraftKings has hopefully highlighted most. The sportsbook is one of the first to actually bring legitimate sports betting options to the United States. With an expansive offer that crosses state borders, DraftKings is available in the majority of states today, if not through its mainstream betting product, then with daily fantasy contests.</p>
<p>The operator has been able to pad its focus on fantasy sports with many great live betting options, excellent apps that make it easy to access the website, and unique payment methods that are authorized by state and federal authorities to use, leading to a higher speed of transactions and safer deposits.</p>
<p>The DraftKings Sportsbook app is a great improvement of the sports wagering experience allowing you to place various real money bets quickly and enabling new users to choose from mainstream sports and contests. Players are always welcome to study what options are available and do so through a mobile app, not least.</p>
<p>Did You Know? Michael Jordan Owns (Part of) DraftKings</p>
<p>DraftKings is a massive cultural phenomenon, not only for its role in fantasy sports. The company has attracted interested for its entire product portfolio and not least from legends such as NBA Finals MVP and Chairman of Hornets Sports &amp; Entertainment Michael Jordan.</p>
<p>In September 2020, Jordan accepted equity interest in DraftKings in exchange for his insight into sports and offering strategic guidance. While the sportsbook is definitely in a good position in the United States, the country is preparing to legalize every state, and this would require expertise to stay competitive.</p>
<p>DraftKings co-founder Jason Robins had no doubt that the addition of Jordan would give DraftKings the competitive edge the company needs to thrive in a highly-competitive market such as the USA. Jordan now helps DraftKings with product development decisions, equity, and other important verticals.</p>
<p>DraftKings and Responsible Gambling</p>
<p>DraftKings is an early-adopter and often a trend-setter. The company has not waited to be told by state authorities to protect consumers. Rather, sportsbook DraftKings has made it so that consumers are always protected from the moment they choose to register.</p>
<p>To achieve this, DraftKings allows players to limit the size of their deposits, bets, and even losses. The sportsbook offers self-exclusion tools and cool-off periods to give consumers the tools necessary to stay away from harm’s way.</p>
<p>Even more importantly, DraftKings Sportsbook will scrutinize individual player sessions and make sure that nobody is playing above their means. Additional affordability checks are initiated at the behest of DraftKings and help guarantee a safer betting environment for everyone.</p>
<p>DraftKings works together with local regulators to ensure that consumers in each state are offered adequate protection against gambling harm.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>DraftKings is a fantastic option if you are looking for a proper sportsbook in the US. The company has been able to achieve a lot and even before PASPA was struck down, DraftKings had all the workings of a top-notch sportsbook. Post-legalization, the sportsbook has been pushing determinedly in all legal states and delivering a top-notch pre-match and live betting product to ensure a well-rounded experience across the board.</p>
<p>This and the added benefit of the powerful DraftKings Sportsbook app make the operator one of the finest in the United States. Much of the company’s strength lies with its competitive odds, great market positioning, and seamless transition between verticals and products. DraftKings sports bettors can rightly call the sportsbook home.</p>
