<p>Martin Truex Jr. and Kyle Larson Coming to LA as Top Favorites</p>
<p>Martin Truex Jr. and Kyle Larson are the top two favorites to win the 2024 Busch Light Clash at the Coliseum, each with betting odds of +900.</p>
<p>This is no surprise because both of these guys were brilliant in the regular season of last year’s NASCAR campaign. Martin Truex Jr., for example, finished in the top 10 in 15 races of the regular season. Kyle Larson did it 12 times in the regular season, as well as finished in the Top 10 in six races of the NASCAR Playoffs.</p>
<p>These guys also seem to love racing at Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. Martin Truex Jr. won last season’s race, while Kyle Larson finished fifth.</p>
<p>Other Contenders for the 2024 Busch Light Clash at the Coliseum</p>
<p>Truex Jr. and Larson are the only two drivers with odds in the form of a three-figure number. There are another four with +1000 odds, namely, Kyle Busch, William Byron, Denny Hamlin, and the defending NASCAR Cup Series champion, Ryan Blaney.</p>
<p>All of these guys are elite drivers, so no one should be surprised if one of them ends up winning on February 4, 2024. The same goes for Christopher Bell and Joey Logano, each with +1200 odds. Then, there are Chase Elliott and Brad Keselowski with +1400 odds each.</p>
<p>Who Can Stage an Upset at LA Memorial Coliseum?</p>
<p>Since 2022, the Busch Light Clash has been run at Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, an oval 0.25-mile track. This is the kind of course that certain drivers love.</p>
<p>Among those are Martin Truex Jr., Chase Elliott, Denny Hamlin, and other big-name drivers. However, there are some underdogs that also tend to do well on short tracks.</p>
<p>Aric Almirola and Alex Bowman, for example, usually finish very high in short tracks, with Bowman even winning two such races.</p>
<p>2024 Busch Light Clash at the Coliseum Prediction</p>
<p>You should keep in mind that the 2024 Busch Light Clash at the Coliseum is a non-championship race, meaning that the drivers won’t go all-in on Sunday. As a result, we could see some underdogs do better than big favorites.</p>
<p>That said, we think that backing Alex Bowman would be a very good choice. He’s priced at +2450 right now, which we think is great value given that this guy does well in races like these.</p>
<p>Pick: Alex Bowman</p>
