<p>White Hat Gaming has made headlines recently. The company most recently teamed up and agreed to provide products for DraftKings through its content arm, White Hat Studios. Now, the company has agreed to allow Aspire Global’s Pariplay igaming content to reach partner operators and their audiences.</p>
<p>Many Operators Waiting for Excellent Games</p>
<p>The interconnectivity of gaming companies has led to a new mutually-beneficial chapter in the igaming landscape which brings rival companies and pools their efforts when it comes to the distribution of products, leaving it down to players to pick which games they enjoy best. Pariplay will deploy its signature Fusion platform with 12,000 games that will now be able to reach White Hat Gaming’s own partners.</p>
<p>Fusion is an important addition as well as it will be deployed along with a number of tools that are built around retention and conversion of new players, and that offers a data-driven breakdown of what makes players stick with brands and what their preferred form of entertainment is.</p>
<p>White Hat Gaming in turn can provide a great casino and sportsbook experience that is based on modular and fully-customizable technology. The iGaming platform already has 3,000 games from across 120 providers. The deal is focused on the non-US operator partnerships with further expansion planned and Ontario is also part of the partnership. Pariplay VP sales Andrew Maclean welcomed the opportunity and congratulated White Hat Gaming’s expertise:</p>
<p>“White Hat Gaming has a similar business style to Pariplay. It is agile, fast-moving and expanding at a rapid rate in similar markets to us, with a strong core business in Europe and with similarly strong ambitions across regulated North America.” Pariplay VP sales Andrew Maclean</p>
<p>Pariplay Remains a Recognized Content Partner</p>
<p>Maclean revealed that the partnership has been negotiated during ICE London, one of the most prominent industry meetings. The partnership was welcomed by White Hat Gaming VP of commercial Michael Waterfield who added that Pariplay’s distinguished product portfolio and engagement tools were a “welcome boost” to the company’s existing offer.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Pariplay has grabbed headlines on several occasions this year. The company confirmed that it would be powering the PlayStar NJ offering earlier this month and agreed to provide content to Winpot.mx, a Wiztech’s subsidiary.</p>
