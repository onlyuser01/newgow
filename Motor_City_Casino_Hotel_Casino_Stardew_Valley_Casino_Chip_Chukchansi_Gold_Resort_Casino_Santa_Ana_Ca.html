<p>Wazdan continues to expand its footprint rapidly in the Balkan and Eastern European markets. The company announced on Friday morning that it has expanded its positions in the Serbian and Montenegrin markets through a deal with ExeFeed, an aggregator with reach in both countries. Thanks to integrating with ExeFeed, Wazdan will now be able to provide brands such BetOle and Lobbet with a number of its own excellent games, featuring 19 of the companies’ excellent titles.</p>
<p>Wazdan Makes Another Stride in the Balkans and Eastern European Market</p>
<p>These titles include some of its top performers, such as 9 Coins, Power of Gods: Hades, and Magic Spins. Lobbet players will similarly have access to a number of excellent gamification elements such as Hold the Jackpot, Cash Infinity, and Collect to Infinity features that are designed to boost engagement and reward players.</p>
<p>Wazdan has been decisively strengthening its position in the global gaming market, leaving nothing to chance, and doubling down on expansion in regions where it has been able to identify growth opportunities. The company has gone live with Betsson’s StarCasinò in Italy, marking a decisive entry into the region, and doubling down on its commitment as a leading top-tier supplier of games.</p>
<p>Wazdan head of sales and business development Balkans &amp; CIS Radka Bacheva said that the company remains focused on growing its regional pull and the integration with ExeFeed was a delightful opportunity to pile onto that strategy. She added:</p>
<p>BetOle and Lobbet have historically taken a similar approach to innovation and pushing the gaming experience as we do at Wazdan, so we look forward to a strong partnership together. Balkans &amp; CIS Radka Bacheva</p>
<p>Strong Regional Growth and Undeniable Leadership</p>
<p>ExeFeed casino manager Milica Popovic welcomed the opportunity and said that Wazdan’s titles are becoming increasingly important to iGaming operators in the region. She argued that this integration will help benefit all companies involved in the partnerships, from the supplier itself to the operators who will be delivering excellent tier-one games to their customers.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Wazdan announced that it had obtained a license to launch with local operators in the neighboring Bulgarian market. Elsewhere, the company has been able to launch with SkillOnNet in the Ontario iGaming market.</p>
<p>The company has also been present in the United States for more than a year and it has been enjoying solid results in the market. GamblingNews will publish a piece next week outlining some of the company’s achievements in that market.</p>
