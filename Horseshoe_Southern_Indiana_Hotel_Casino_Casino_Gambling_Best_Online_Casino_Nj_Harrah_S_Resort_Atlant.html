<p>Wazdan, an innovative iGaming supplier, has rolled out its full content portfolio in Bulgaria, marking the 20th jurisdiction in which the company has made its products available. The rollout features 14 of the company’s most popular games that have been certified in the country and will now be available on the market, including 9 Lions, Magic Fruits Deluxe, Larry the Leprechaun, Sizzling 777 Deluxe, and more.</p>
<p>Wazdan Introduces 14 Titles to iGaming Market in Bulgaria</p>
<p>Partner operators will have the opportunity to negotiate individual deals and partner with Wazdan to integrate the approved titles and future releases as they see fit. Wazdan will also deploy the Freedom of Choice suite which is another opportunity for players and operators to feel closer to the action.</p>
<p>The suite comes with an authentic “Volatility Levels” feature which allows players to choose the volatility of the game they are playing, giving them further control over the experience. Wazdan has been making a strong commitment in new and emerging markets, with the supplier moving to a number of important jurisdictions, such as Ontario in Canada, Michigan in the United States, and the Netherlands.</p>
<p>The Bulgarian market is now another important entry for Wazdan which seeks to rapidly expand its global reach and clout. Commenting on this partnership, Wazdan CCO Andrzej Hyla welcomed this launch and said:</p>
<p>“We’ve experienced a great deal of growth and momentum this year, but we are far from resting on our laurels. This entry into Bulgaria just marks the latest in some very exciting growth plans for Wazdan.” Wazdan CCO Andrzej Hyla</p>
<p>In Ontario, Wazdan launched through a partnership with SkillOnNet brands, making its product accessible to a number of brands, including PlayOJO, which is an award-winning operator with a global reach.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Bulgaria has remained an important focus of the eastward expansion of many companies. Earlier this week, Pragmatic Play, another iGaming supplier, announced that it will open a new state-of-the-art live casino studio in Bulgaria and vowed to create more than 2,000 workplaces by the end of 2023. Recently, Wazdan released its “Sizzling Kingdom: Bison” slot. Last month, the company launched with StarCasinò in Italy.</p>
