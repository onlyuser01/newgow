<p>Marina Rodriguez vs Amanda Lemos is the headliner fight of the UFC Fight Night 214 a.k.a. UFC Vegas 64. The fight in question is a UFC Women’s Strawweight bout, which could serve as a title eliminator. The winner of Saturday’s main event might get a shot at the title, which is currently held by Carla Esparza.</p>
<p>This goes especially if Marina Rodriguez triumphs in Vegas, as she’s currently ranked third in the division. Meanwhile, Amanda Lemos is three places lower in the UFC Women’s Strawweight Rankings.</p>

<p>Marina Rodriguez is the Betting Favorite</p>
<p>Rodriguez is 16-1-2 in her professional career, coming to Vegas after four straight wins. During her winning streak, we saw her destroy Amanda Ribas by TKO, as well as beat Michelle Waterson and Mackenzie Dern by unanimous decision in two five-round fights. Rodriguez’s last fight saw her win against Yan Xiaonan by a split decision.</p>
<p>Those fights showed that she’s got fantastic stamina, as well as incredible punching power. No surprise there, as she’s a big strawweight, who has experience fighting in the flyweight division as well.</p>
<p>Rodriguez might not be ideal on the ground, but the fact that she’s a purple belt in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu means that she knows how to defend. Her takedown defense stands at 65%, meaning that she’s probably safe against Lemos’ submission attempts. In fact, the biggest danger for Rodriguez is that she might get knocked out by her hard-hitting opponent.</p>
<p>Amanda Lemos Going for a KO/TKO Win</p>
<p>Lemos is a tough fighter who started out as a bantamweight before moving to the strawweight division after a two-year hiatus caused by a doping suspension. Since coming back, she’s 6-1 in the UFC, with four finishes. Her only loss happened to Jessica Andrade by submission.</p>
<p>She’s a well-rounded fighter with an incredible force in her punches and kicks. Her strikes are also very precise, with her striking accuracy currently standing at 57% (10% more than Rodriguez’s). Lemos also absorbs a lot of strikes, with her average being 4.40 per minute.</p>
<p>That’s a high number, especially knowing that she’s supposed to fight a five-round bout on Saturday. If she gets kicked around by Rodriguez throughout all 25 minutes, she’s definitely going to lose on points. That’s why her best path to victory is to try and get an early KO/TKO win.</p>
<p>Marina Rodriguez vs Amanda Lemos Prediction</p>
<p>Amanda Lemos mustn’t be underestimated. She’s a fine fighter who can take a beating and still come out on top. Unfortunately for her, she probably won’t be able to do too much if the fight drags on. And we think it will drag on until the final bell. By then, Rodrigues will have accumulated enough points (from significant strikes) that she’s going to get a win.</p>
