<p>The significant disruption should pay off in the long term, providing the PENN-owned operator with improved strategic flexibility and reducing its reliance on third-party solutions</p>
<p>Customers received notices of the planned downtime on 7 July, warning them that the process could take several days. Switching from Kambi to a proprietary platform has significant implications for the operator, hopefully helping offset its recent troubles across the USA. The move should also benefit customers, providing a more responsive and reliable experience.</p>
<p>Users Will Enjoy Significant Improvements</p>
<p>Acquiring Toronto-based media and sports betting company theScore was a pivotal step for PENN Entertainment, granting it access to valuable technology and expertise in the sports betting market. theScore’s proprietary platform provided the foundations for the new Barstool solution, allowing the operator to leverage its vast user base and expand its offerings with a more tailored and customizable platform.</p>
<p>Bringing platform development in-house allows Barstool Sportsbook to enhance the user experience, improve operational efficiency, and strengthen its position in the highly competitive sports betting industry. The overhaul should deliver a more intuitive and personalized betting experience, with enhanced user interfaces, improved navigation, and expanded betting options.</p>
<p>The temporary shutdown of Barstool’s sportsbook platform may cause some inconvenience for users during the transition period. The operator reassured its customers that their balances remained secure, with pending wagers seamlessly carrying over. Users should receive an email notification when the migration is complete, prompting them to log in and try out Barstool’s new features.</p>
<p>Barstool Positions Itself for Enduring Growth</p>
<p>A platform refresh may be just what Barstool needs to escape its recent streak of setbacks and capture new audiences across regulated markets. Direct control over the platform’s features and capabilities allows the sportsbook to better respond to market trends and adapt to user preferences. This agility provides a competitive advantage in an industry centered around innovation and customer-centricity.</p>
<p>Having full control of our product roadmap will enable us to connect with our customers on a more personal level and quickly add new features and betting markets to the Barstool Sportsbook. Jay Snowden, PENN Entertainment CEO</p>
<p>PENN hopes an enhanced platform will allow Barstool to better compete with industry heavyweights like FanDuel, BetMGM, and DraftKings. The operator consistently trails behind in betting volumes, at least partially due to its previous lack of operational flexibility. The new solution should enable more tailored and innovative offerings, opening up opportunities for cross-promotion and synergies to fuel Barstool’s growth trajectory.</p>
<p>Despite the short-term negative impact of a 72-hour shutdown, switching to an in-house platform should ultimately solidify Barstool’s position in the sports betting market, providing the necessary technological capabilities to develop offerings aligned with Barstool’s unique brand identity. The switch positions the operator for future growth and sets the stage for continued success in the highly competitive sports betting industry.</p>
