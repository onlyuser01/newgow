<p>In May this year, Nassau County legislators voted 17-1 in favor of a 99-year lease for the Coliseum to the leading gaming and entertainment company, Las Vegas Sands (LVS). The company joined the race for one of three downstate casino licenses and the lease marked the start of its plan for a project with a billion-dollar price tag. Despite the lease, LVS’ ambitious project may be delayed further as it was tangled in a legal battle, a new report released by Newsday suggests.</p>
<p>Yvonne Hennessey, a leading environmental litigation attorney based in Albany, New York, who is unrelated to the legal case, revealed that ongoing legal battles may take years before a second department. “A lengthy delay is often discouraging for people wanting to invest,” she suggested considering her extensive experience in representing investors and developers.</p>
<p>The legal battle emerged from a lawsuit filed by Hofstra University which is located next to the site planned for the massive casino project. The institution argued that proper environmental reviews were not conducted prior to the approval of the 99-year lease by the County. Moreover, Hofstra University’s legal challenge claimed that county officials did not engage in sufficient public discussions regarding the LVS’ casino project.</p>
<p>The legal hurdle prompted LVS to act quickly and earlier this month, the casino project was temporarily given a green light following an Appellate Court decision that issued a stay on a ruling that annulled the approval of the project given by Nassau County. Considering this decision, Hofstra was asked to describe why the initial court ruling should remain in place. A hearing on the topic is scheduled for Tuesday, November 21, 2023.</p>
<p>Appeals May Delay the Casino Project Further</p>
<p>Adam Schuman, Hofstra’s attorney, who was cited by Newsday, spoke against the hold of the Appellate Court. Defending the university, he said that the county can simply return to the planning phase, conducting an environmental review and public meetings for the project. Schuman suggested that this process may take less time than engaging in appeals.</p>
<p>The decision of the State Supreme Court that was put on temporary hold ruled that Nassau County did not follow the Open Meetings Law and the State Environmental Quality Review Act. The ruling effectively annulled the lease agreement between LVS and the county. Speaking about the aforementioned decision, Schuman said that it “reaffirms that government entities will be held accountable if they act in violation of the public’s right under state law to be heard and participate in decisions of public importance.”</p>
<p>It is currently unclear what will be the outcome of the upcoming hearing. Still, if the legal saga continues, LVS’ project may face further delays.</p>
