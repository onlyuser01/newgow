<p>The developer of leading games for the online gambling vertical strengthened its gaming team with the latest appointment as it prepares for further growth and expansion</p>
<p>The developer of engaging games for the iGaming industry, Yggdrasil, announced a new senior-level appointment Tuesday. The company unveiled it hired the gaming industry veteran with decades of experience, Mark McGinley, to the role of chief gaming officer. With the recent appointment, Yggdrasil strengthens its recently consolidated gaming team, which in turn is expected to allow it to expand within new and existing gambling markets.</p>
<p>McGinley brings extensive experience within the business-to-business and business-to-customer gaming verticals. He has a track record in the industry and has helped gambling companies of different sizes to grow their product portfolio and develop further. Overall, McGinley leverages more than 25 years of experience, making him an important asset for the future growth of Yggdrasil.</p>
<p>In line with McGinley’s appointment, the company confirmed that it consolidated its studio and product and program verticals under a unified gaming team. The game developer explained that this action will help with “transparency, streamline processes and offer numerous operational benefits.” Ultimately, the gaming team is expected to impact positively the development of products and focus on the needs of operators and players.</p>
<p>The new appointment comes after late last month, Yggdrasil released Ragnawolves WildEnergy, a new mythological-themed slot that offers a new Game Engagement Mechanic (GEM) and the potential for huge payouts. Before that, earlier in May, the popular developer confirmed the launch of a new fish-themed slot called Nice Catch DoubleMax, offering the popular DoubleMax mechanic and multipliers, among other engaging functions.</p>
<p>The Appointment Comes at the Perfect Time</p>
<p>McGinley was excited to join Yggdrasil’s growing team. He explained that he recognizes the potential for further growth and expansion of the business to a leadership position in the global online gambling vertical. Finally, McGinley pointed out: “I’m truly excited about my new position and to be part of the exciting growth journey Yggdrasil embarked on 10 years ago.”</p>

<p>Björn Krantz, Yggdrasil’s CEO, was similarly delighted to see McGinley join the company’s C-suite. He acknowledged that the new chief gaming officer delivers valuable experience and insight and predicted that this will play a key role in the future expansion of Yggdrasil. Finally, Krantz welcomed McGinley to the senior management team and said that he is looking forward to collaborating further with him.</p>
<p>“It is perfect timing for Mark to join and head up our new Gaming unit at Yggdrasil, which will further strengthen our existing innovative and premium Global Roadmap Developments, as well as expand on the strategic product differentiation in tight collaboration with major industry operator partners.“ Björn Krantz, CEO of Yggdrasil</p>
<p>Before joining Yggdrasil, McGinley was a part of global gaming and entertainment companies. He most recently served as CEO of FunFair Games, while before that, he was Entain’s director of game studios.
