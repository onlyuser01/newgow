<p>Jackpocket, the first licensed third-party lottery courier app in the United States, confirmed that two of its users recently secured million-dollar prizes. The company revealed that Joseph W., a 76-year-old grandfather from New Jersey, used the lottery app to buy $10 in Powerball tickets. Little did he know that this purchase would grant him a mouth-watering second-tier prize of $1 million.</p>
<p>Using his phone, Joseph ordered lottery tickets via the Jackpocket app. From one of the tickets, the lucky winner had five numbers that matched the white balls drawn on December 13. At the time, Joseph guessed correctly white balls 3, 8, 41, 56 and 64.</p>
<p>The 76-year-old missed Powerball's whopping $500 million jackpot considering that his red Powerball number was 17, while drawing saw the number 18. Still, that was a pretty close call, and the winning numbers got the grandfather a staggering $1 million prize.</p>
<p>According to a statement released by Jackpocket, Joseph used the app's Quick Pick to select the winning numbers. The lucky winner admitted that he first used the Jackpocket app back in 2020. At that time, during the pandemic, Joseph started using the app to purchase lottery tickets and has been using it since.</p>
<p>When asked about the recent million-dollar win, the lucky lottery player said the win "hasnâ€™t really set in yet." Joseph confirmed that he and his wife plan to share the $1 million win with their grandchildren and children.</p>
<p>Besides the winner from New Jersey, the company confirmed that another person using the Jackpocket app secured a million-dollar prize. From the same drawing earlier this month, a person from Texas who was using the app won $2 million from Powerball. Earlier this year, another Jackpocket customer in New York also took home a $2 million Powerball prize.</p>
<p>Pete Sullivan, Jackpocket's Founder and CEO, was excited about the recent announcement. "We're so proud to celebrate this New Jersey Powerball winner," he explained. Finally, Sullivan noted: "Jackpocket was founded on the idea that the lottery should be accessible and convenient, and we are thrilled when we get to celebrate a major win like this one."</p>
<p>Using Jackpocket, lottery players across the United States have won more than $390 million in prizes. Using the app, a New Jersey resident secured the largest legal and regulated win on a mobile device for the US, a staggering $9.4 million Pick-6 prize.</p>
