<p>Reasons Why Barcelona is Favored to Win on Saturday</p>
<p>Barcelona is the only undefeated team in the 2023-24 Spanish La Liga with a 7-3-0 record. However, this doesn’t mean Xavi’s team is sitting at the top of the table. Instead, this team is third. The good news for Barca’s fans is that could change this weekend.</p>
<p>Barcelona is trailing behind Real Madrid and Girona by just one point, meaning that with a win on Saturday, the boys from Catalonia could get to the summit of La Liga.</p>
<p>So, can they beat Real Madrid? Well, they’ve done it many times over the last couple of seasons. Plus, Saturday’s game is played in Barcelona. Sure, they’re not playing at Camp Nou, which is being reconstructed at the moment, but at least they’ll have their fans to support them from the stands of Estadio Olimpico.</p>
<p>This venue is the place where they’ve got a 100% win record this season, with five wins in La Liga which saw them concede only two goals in total.</p>
<p>Los Blancos Confident of a Good Result</p>
<p>Real Madrid is doing great this season, even though Los Blancos had some problems with injuries last month. They’re sitting top of the table with an 8-1-1 record, coming off a 1-1 draw with Sevilla in their most recent La Liga game.</p>
<p>Their best player in the 2023-24 season is Jude Bellingham who’s also the top scorer in La Liga with eight goals to his name. This is kind of surprising as the Englishman plays in the center of the pitch.</p>
<p>When it comes to Real Madrid’s forwards, veteran Joselu has been doing very well, scoring five goals in 10 games. Rodrygo and Vinicius Junior have just three goals between them, which isn’t great knowing how good these guys are. But it’s safe to say they’re going to up their game soon.</p>
<p>Barcelona vs. Real Madrid Prediction</p>
<p>Our El Clasico prediction is that this is going to be a real thriller. These two are great defensively, but we do think this is going to be a high-scoring affair. Over 3 goals seem certain, but when it comes to who’s going to win the Barcelona vs. Real Madrid game, we’d say no one. Instead, a draw looks like the most probable outcome.</p>
<p>Pick: Barcelona and Real Madrid to draw &amp; over 3 goals</p>
