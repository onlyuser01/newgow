<p>As iGaming has become more popular, SoftSwiss has the ambition to fulfill the demand of yet another continent with its most recent expansion in India, South Korea, and Japan.</p>
<p>SofSwiss Is Adapting to Asian Markets</p>
<p>SoftSwiss is launching new adapted sportsbook solutions created for the individual markets in India, Japan, and South Korea.</p>
<p>SoftSwiss has created an Online Casino Platform with top-notch content of various live casino games, which are going to be available in Japanese and Korean languages. The solution will also allow local payment systems such as Arubex, InPay, VenusPoint, and others for a maximum user-friendly experience.</p>
<p>This new platform presents casino gaming solutions that are completely integrated into the local markets and also enabling other local online casinos to use platform solutions to reach their own potential.</p>
<p>Max Trafimovich, SoftSwiss CCO said that despite the current situation, 2020 has been a dynamic year for SoftSwiss, as the company has expanded globally and he is definitely looking forward to keeping the momentum and continue to expand in 2021.</p>
<p>As of 2020, iGaming has become one of the leading forms of entertainment, prompting a lot of cyber-attacks against the industry. Nevertheless, this new-found popularity opens the door for the creation and expansion of new, innovative solutions. Japan and Korea are ready to embrace the SoftSwiss Online Casino platform which is a huge opportunity for growth.</p>
<p>SoftSwiss Sportsbook Solution in India</p>
<p>While Japan and Korea launch the adapted SoftSwiss Online Casino Platform, India is integrating the SoftSwiss Sportsbook sports betting platform to fulfill another growing demand on the Indian market.</p>
<p>The solution will be fully adapted to over 1200 markets and will include 60 different sports. India will be able to enjoy sports such as cricket and horse racing. Bonus schemes such as Bet Builder, System, Maxbet, and Cashout are also included. The solution comes with SoftSwissâ€™ very own fraud prevention, customer support, and full risk management.</p>
<p>SoftSwiss is Building the Momentum</p>
<p>With its extensive experience in the iGaming industry, SoftSwiss has a reputation of providing unique quality solutions, quickly adaptable to the local markets as well as providing advanced gaming solutions to players along with security, stability, and growth for the operators.</p>
<p>Recently JooSports was the first to integrate the SoftSwiss Sportsbook platform to provide a unique experience for players. The integration included a seamless transition between all featured verticals, only to confirm how user-friendly and easy it is for businesses to integrate and benefit from the SoftSwiss solution.</p>
