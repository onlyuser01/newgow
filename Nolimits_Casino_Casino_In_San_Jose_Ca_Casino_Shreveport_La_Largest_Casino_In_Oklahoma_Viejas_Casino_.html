<p>Aristocrat Leisure Limited, an Australian gaming and entertainment firm, has appointed Sally Denby as its new CFO. The appointment is immediately effective but subject to the receipt of all necessary regulatory clearances.</p>
<p>Denby Brings Vast Wealth of Experience</p>
<p>Denby first stepped in a similar position back in February when she was promoted as a deputy CFO, following seven years in various similar financial positions across other companies. She worked at both GE Capital and Nine MSN where she held senior finance leadership positions and cultivate the necessary experience to step into one of her most important positions to date.</p>
<p>Aristocrat was well-aware of Denby’s past track record and was very happy with the appointment. Trevor Croker, Aristocrat CEO &amp; managing director was pleased with the arrival of Denby in her new position and he had this to add on the occasion:</p>
<p>Over her successful career at Aristocrat, Sally has proven to be an outstanding enterprise leader and a trusted finance partner. Trevor Croker, Aristocrat CEO &amp; managing director</p>
<p>Croker spoke of Denby’s “cultural impact” and “deep engagement” with Aristocrat’s business operations and stated goals. He noted that Denby perfectly understood Aristocrat’s obligations as an ASX-listed company. Croker noted that he already had observed Denby as a deputy CFO and was pleased with her performance, execution and overall motivation to help Aristocrat perform better across the board.</p>
<p>“A comprehensive global search identified Sally as the best candidate to step into the role, at this exciting time in Aristocrat’s growth journey,” he concluded. Aristocrat has been actively hiring and adding to its ranks, reflecting on the company’s quick global expansion.</p>
<p>In October, the company appointed Joe Kaminkow as its chief innovation officer. The company similarly introduced Bill G. Lance Jnr as its non-executive director of the Board. Aristocrat has been making a series of executive and non-executive hires to consolidate its team across the board and help the company steer towards better results.</p>
