<p>iGaming software solutions provider Delasport is ready to foray into the Netherlands, one of Europe’s most appealing markets. The company successfully received certification from Gaming Laboratories International and will can now offer its products in the country.</p>
<p>Delasport to Launch in the Netherlands</p>
<p>Now that Delasport has been cleared for launch, operators in the Netherlands will be able to benefit from its critically-acclaimed sports, casino and PAM solutions. The provider’s goals are to deliver those solutions to companies in the Dutch iGaming market. Delasport will supply its partners with a rich portfolio of games, cutting-edge gamification tools and tested personalization features.</p>
<p>Oren Cohen Shwartz, Delasport’s chief executive officer, commented on the launch. He noted that the market has the potential to become one of the most competitive markets in Europe. Because of that, his team is looking forward to being a “part of the pioneering wave of sports, casino and PAM suppliers.”</p>
<p>Shwartz is excited about the future and hopes that Delasport will become a major player in Dutch iGaming.</p>
<p>We are keen to play a major role in the shaping of the Dutch iGaming landscape and look forward to partnering with new operators, and helping our existing partners grow. Oren Cohen Shwartz, CEO, Delasport</p>
<p>The Provider Continues to Grow</p>
<p>Delasport has cemented itself as one of the fastest-growing iGaming brands in the regulated market. The past few months saw the iGaming company launch its offerings in some of the key gambling markets. Notably, Delasport secured licenses for Romania, Sweden, the United States and Denmark. In February, the company also secured a license for the Maltese market.</p>
<p>The iGaming provider has been bullish on expanding and has done everything to maintain its momentum. Last month, the company unveiled a huge overhaul of its native app, bringing new features and polishing older ones. The company’s aim was to integrate its sportsbook, casino and associated player account management platform into a single mobile app.</p>
<p>The Netherlands: a Highly Competitive Gaming Market</p>
<p>Just like Shwartz said, the Netherlands is a highly competitive market and is poised to be one of the most lucrative in Europe. The watchful Kansspelautoriteit maintains the market’s standards by constantly keeping an eye on its licensees.</p>
<p>The Dutch gambling industry has been bullish on curbing unlicensed gambling. To that end, the regulator has been working hard to keep offshore activity at a bare minimum. As a result, the market has become very appealing to operators that follow the rules.</p>
<p>One of the latest developments in the Netherlands saw politicians take up arms to fight against microtransactions in video gaming.</p>
