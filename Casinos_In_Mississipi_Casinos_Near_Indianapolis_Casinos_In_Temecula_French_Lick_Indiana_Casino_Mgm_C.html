<p>Octoplay is thrilled to launch in the United Kingdom and power its roster of local partners with disruptive gaming titles</p>
<p>Octoplay, a provider of online casino gaming, has announced that it has successfully secured a license to distribute its content in the United Kingdom. This is a major milestone for the company and will allow it to expand its footprint in one of Europe’s most mature markets.</p>
<p>The new accomplishment, Octoplay noted, comes in addition to the company’s recent recognition by the Malta Gaming Authority. In December last year, the company received a license from the MGA, allowing it to further expand its European footprint. This, on the other hand, followed the operator’s licensing in Romania.</p>
<p>Octoplay said that its remote gambling software license was “rapidly approved within an impressive three-month period.” The provider said that this is a testament to its diligence and the UKGC’s efficiency.</p>
<p>The UKGC license will allow Octoplay to distribute its content in Britain, providing local brands with gambling content and engaging local customers with games.</p>
<p>Octoplay Called the Development a “Monumental Milestone”</p>
<p>Octoplay’s director of legal and compliance, Martina Borg Stevens, commented on the new license. She said that she is very happy that the supplier was able to expand its market reach in such a short time. Stevens called the new license a “monumental milestone” for the company and said that her team cannot wait to present UK players with its new games.</p>
<p>We are thrilled to bring our exciting new games to the UK market and thank the U.K. Gambling Commission for its diligent work in assessing Octoplay’s suitability. Martina Borg Stevens, director of legal and compliance, Octoplay</p>
<p>Carl Ejlertsson, Octoplay’s chief executive officer, also shared his thoughts on the matter. He noted that he is glad that his team will finally be able to work with its British partners. Octoplay already has a roster of local allies that are committed to working with the company. Now, they will finally be able to integrate the supplier’s games into their platforms.</p>
<p>Ejlertsson confirmed Stevens’ words, emphasizing that this is a major development for the company:</p>
<p>This is a significant achievement for the company and an exciting time for the industry as we move forward with our disruptive plans. Carl Ejlertsson, CEO, Octoplay</p>
<p>Octoplay was founded in October 2022. Its main objective is to disrupt the iGaming market with “the most exciting and enjoyable slots in the world.”</p>
<p>Last month, Octoplay penned a new agreement with Soft2Bet, integrating five of its titles into the latter company’s offering. In January, Octoplay launched a second studio called Penguin King to improve its pipeline.</p>
