<p>The leading online gambling operator in Italy that is a part of Flutter Entertainment, Sisal, expanded further its global footprint by securing a sports betting concession license in Morocco</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the company revealed it has secured the license for the La Marocaine des Jeux et des Sports (MDJS) following a competitive tender process. Ultimately, Sisal was selected as the victor of the tender process and signed an eight-year agreement for the MDJS in Morocco. With that in mind, the deal itself can be extended for a further term of 2 years. The operational launch, according to Sisal, is expected to be completed on January 1, 2024.</p>
<p>“We are extremely pleased to announce the consolidation of our offering in Morocco.“ Marco Caccavale, international managing director at Sisal and the CEO of Sisal Jeux Maroc</p>
<p>Marco Caccavale, Sisal’s international managing director and the CEO of Sisal Jeux Maroc, the local subsidiary that will be in charge of the exclusive distribution in Morocco, explained that the company is delighted to further expand its presence and enter a new market. He explained that the license is a testament to the quality of Sisal’s offering and complements its growth from the last few years.</p>
<p>“This is our fourth successful international tender, all of which have been highly competitive, recognizing the commitment, investment and know-how that make us unique in the market,“ added Caccavale</p>
<p>At the same time, Caccavale said that the entry into the market in Morocco holds significant potential for further growth. Caccavale pointed out that the latest license marks the fourth competitive international tender for Sisal. This, according to him reaffirms the company’s commitment to growth and ambition to capture emerging new opportunities. Finally, Caccavale said that Sisal benefits from being a part of the entertainment giant Flutter and this delivers unique experiences by developing joint products for different markets.</p>
<p>The Company Continues to Expand Its Presence in North Africa</p>
<p>Sisal’s latest tender in Morocco represents a major achievement for the company, considering that it will be the sole retail and online sports betting operator in the country. As noted, the company will offer exclusive services via a local entity called Sisal Jeux Maroc. Sisal Jeux Maroc will leverage a growing network of online and retail outlets to deliver Sisal’s leading services.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in North Africa, Sisal secured another major contract. Last year, the leading gaming, betting and lottery company, was awarded a concession contract for gaming services by the Tunisian gambling regulator, Promosport. In Tunisia, Sisal was awarded an exclusive 10-year license for the delivery of online games, instant lotteries, number games and sports betting.</p>
