    <h1>Caesars Casino Online Real Money Casinos In Boston Hard Rock Hotel Casino Atlantic City Newest No De</h1>

<p>The leading supplier of games for the iGaming industry, Pragmatic Play, announced the launch of its new sportsbook product. The company confirmed it rolled out its sportsbook product via DAZN BET for the regulated gambling market in Spain. The recent launch comes after an important partnership announced between DAZN BET and Pragmatic Play.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the deal, the iGaming content and games provider agreed to deliver its full-service iGaming solution. This means that the operator would not only benefit from Pragmatic Play’s sports betting solution but gain access to its portfolio of games, including live casino, virtual sports and slot titles.</p>
<p>The integration into DAZN BET was completed via Pragmatic Play’s Player Account Management platform technology delivered by Pragmatic Solutions. This innovative solution served as the core technology for DAZN BET since its official launch. The integration of Pragmatic Play Sportsbook enables the company to significantly expand its footprint within the vertical and makes it available for all Pragmatic Solutions’ platform partners.</p>
<p>Recently, Pragmatic Play announced an important deal with bet365. Under the terms of that collaboration, the company expanded the reach of its games for customers of the operator in two important European markets – Sweden and Spain. Per that agreement, bet365’s customers in the two markets gained access to player-favorite games from Pragmatic Play.</p>
<p>The Launch Marks an Important Milestone for Pragmatic</p>
<p>Simon Gatenby, DAZN BET’s CMO, highlighted the strong reputation Pragmatic Play holds within the online gambling sector. He explained that the company is excited to be the first operator to use Pragmatic’s sportsbook solution. “Working in tandem with Pragmatic Solutions, we’re confident that our customers in Spain will love the new platform, and that we’ll give them an unforgettable sports betting experience,” explained Gatenby in conclusion.</p>
<p>“Pragmatic Play’s collaboration with DAZN BET is something we’ve been incredibly excited about since we announced our intention to power its disruptive sports betting market entry.“ Gareth Crook, VP of Sports at Pragmatic Play</p>
<p>Gareth Crook, Pragmatic’s VP of Sports, revealed that delivering its sports betting product for DAZN BET has been an important goal for the company. “We’re now seeing the fruits of our labor come to life for the first time,” he added. Finally, Crook predicted that DAZN BET will solidify its presence in Spain, powered by Pragmatic’s leading technology.</p>
<p>The entry of Pragmatic into the sports vertical reaffirms its growing presence in the gambling sector. It complements its growth and expands the company’s offering which currently consists of virtual sports, bingo, live casino, as well as slots products.</p>
