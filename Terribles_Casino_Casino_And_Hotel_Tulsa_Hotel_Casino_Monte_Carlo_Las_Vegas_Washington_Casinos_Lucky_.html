    <h1>Terribles Casino Casino And Hotel Tulsa Hotel Casino Monte Carlo Las Vegas Washington Casinos Lucky</h1>

<p>The international resort and entertainment company has decided that the addition of the producer and director is the best move for its structure at the top</p>
<p>Ben Winston is now the 12th member of the board and he is also a founding partner of Fulwell 73, a production company, and a prominent name in the industry. Professionally, Winston is the youngest show producer of a late-night program in the United States.</p>
<p>He worked on The Late Late Show with James Corden in 2015 and has been a prominent fixture in the production industry ever since. His addition to the board has interesting timing, too. MGM Resorts International is looking to leverage the expertise of people who are well-versed in what the company considers to be the more transformative aspects of the entertainment industry.</p>
<p>Commenting on his appointment as part of the team, Winston hailed the company as a premier entertainment and gaming destination and said he was honored to be joining the MGM family. “I’m looking forward to working with my fellow board members to drive growth, building the best experiences possible for our guests,” Winston said.</p>
<p>Winston Demonstrates Clear Creative Leadership</p>
<p>MGM Resorts Board of Directors chair Paul Salem was similarly pleased with the appointment of Winston. He explained that the new addition was a person who had a significant experience in entertainment and was beyond any doubt a tremendous asset to the company as it continues to explore new venues and facets of the industry.</p>
<p>MGM Resorts CEO &amp; president Bill Hornbuckle was of a similar mind. He praised Winston and his addition to the team and said that the man demonstrated clear dynamic and creative leadership in his career. This is an exciting opportunity for the company to explore new profitable streams and move in lockstep with the evolution of the entertainment industry as it continues to introduce fresh talent in its ranks.</p>
<p>“We know Ben will provide great insight and creative counsel to our management team as we evolve and execute our strategy,” Hornbuckle concluded. As to Winston, the man has done quite a few excellent productions. He produced the Carpool Karaoke for Apple TV+, The Grammy Awards for CBS, and more. He also directed Friends: The Reunion, which became the most-watched show in HBO Max’s history.</p>
