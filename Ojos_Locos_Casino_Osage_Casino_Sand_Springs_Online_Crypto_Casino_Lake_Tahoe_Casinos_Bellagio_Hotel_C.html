<p>Sen. Kamala Harris VP Odds Shorten, Joe Biden to Announce Candidate</p>

<p>Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) is the betting favorite to be named Joe Biden’s running mate for the 2020 presidential election.</p>

<p>Online political betting exchange PredictIt gives Harris a 59 percent chance of being tapped by the 77-year-old presumptive Democratic nominee. Susan Rice, the former United States ambassador to the United Nations and United States national security advisor, is a distant second at 23 cents.</p>
<p>Harris’ odds of being the Democratic Party’s vice presidential candidate have been shortening recently. A week ago, her PredictIt shares were at 36 cents. Rice was at 24 cents.</p>
<p>UK bookmakers agree Harris will be Biden’s right-hand woman. William Hill has the senator at -175 (implied odds of 63.64 percent). A $100 bet on those odds wins $57.14.</p>
<p>This week, Biden was photographed holding handwritten notes with Harris’ name at the top. The notepad had numerous talking points regarding the senator, including “Campaigned with me and Jill,” “Do not hold grudges,” “Great help to campaign,” and “Great respect for her.”</p>
<p>Third Time’s a Charm?</p>
<p>While Harris is the odds-on favorite, Biden says he still has yet to officially decide on who will be his running mate.</p>
<p>I’m going to have a choice in the first week in August, and I promise I’ll let you know when I do,” Biden said this week.</p>
<p>One thing is likely: it will be a woman. In March, Biden committed to selecting a woman to be vice president. “There are a number of women qualified to be president tomorrow,” he said at the time.</p>
<p>Should he do so, she would become just the third woman to be a vice presidential candidate selected by a major American political party. The two others are former US Rep. Geraldine Ferraro, who unsuccessfully ran with Democratic candidate Walter Mondale in 1984, and former Arkansas Gov. Sarah Palin, who unsuccessfully ran with Republican Sen. John McCain in 2008.</p>
<p>This time is different, as Biden’s VP pick has a strong chance of becoming the first female vice president of the United States. Biden’s shares of winning on November 3 are at 61 cents, President Donald Trump a long second at 40 cents.</p>
<p>Another candidate Biden’s considering is Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D). Biden will hold a campaign fundraiser with Warren tomorrow.</p>
<p>Trump Threatens Election</p>
<p>Trump caused controversy today by floating the idea of delaying the presidential election because of alleged voting fraud stemming from mail-in ballots.</p>
<p>With Universal Mail-In Voting (not Absentee Voting, which is good), 2020 will be the most INACCURATE &amp; FRAUDULENT Election in history. It will be a great embarrassment to the USA. Delay the Election until people can properly, securely and safely vote???” Trump tweeted.</p>
<p>William Hill’s odds of the United States not having an election in 2020 are at 6/1.</p>
<p>“Glad I was able to get the very dishonest LameStream Media to finally start talking about the RISKS to our Democracy from dangerous Universal Mail-In-Voting (not Absentee Voting, which I totally support!),” the president later tweeted.</p>
