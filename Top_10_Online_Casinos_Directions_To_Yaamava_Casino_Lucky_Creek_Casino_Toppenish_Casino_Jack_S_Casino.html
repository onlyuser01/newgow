    <h1>Top 10 Online Casinos Directions To Yaamava Casino Lucky Creek Casino Toppenish Casino Jack S Casino</h1>

<p>Lightning Box, an Australia-based iGaming game supplier, has expanded its presence in the United States by launching its Lightning Horseman slot game in Connecticut. The title is already enjoying success in the United States, making this launch an exciting development for Connecticut punters.</p>
<p>Lightning Box Goes Live in Connecticut</p>
<p>The Connecticut launch of Lightning Horseman is made possible by the OpenGaming platform, thanks to Lightning Box’s partnership with Scientific Games.</p>
<p>The Constitution State is the fifth US jurisdiction where Lightning Box has a presence. According to the company, this growth across the United States attests to Lightning Box’s qualities as a leading multi-channel supplier of video slot games and affirms its place among the best.</p>
<p>Prior to its foray into Connecticut, Lightning Box had launched its offerings in Michigan, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia.</p>
<p>Scientific Games is Delighted to Support the Launch</p>
<p>Peter Causley, the chief executive officer of Lightning Box, commented on the new deal, sharing his excitement to launch the company’s offerings in Connecticut. He described the state as “yet another piece to the jigsaw puzzle,” and is looking forward to the opportunities presented by the state.</p>
<p>Causley will continue seeking to expand Lightning Box across the US jurisdictions as the country’s iGaming industry continues to develop. He noted that thousands of US bettors are fans of Lightning Box’s land-based offerings and are also excited to offer them the company’s online games.</p>
<p>“US players in land-based and social casino are fans of our content and I’ve no doubt that popularity will continue to spread as more and more states regulate online.”</p>
<p>Rob Procter, the vice president of game development at Scientific Games, said that his company is just as glad to assist Lightning Box with its entry into Connecticut’s online gaming market. Procter called the latest developments “an exciting time for Lightning Box” and added that he is looking forward to working with the game supplier.</p>
<p>Procter concluded that the Scientific Games team is absolutely convinced Lightning Box’s critically-acclaimed titles, such as Lightning Horseman and Chicken Fox, will be a hit among Connecticut’s iGaming community.</p>
<p>Scientific Games is one of the most popular names in gambling. The company boasts numerous partners among the most influential companies in the industry. At the beginning of January, Scientific Games penned a deal with Wazdan, which provided it with the latter’s state-of-the-art suite of iGaming titles. In February, the company launched its offerings in Azerbaijan thanks to a partnership with the country’s national lottery.</p>
