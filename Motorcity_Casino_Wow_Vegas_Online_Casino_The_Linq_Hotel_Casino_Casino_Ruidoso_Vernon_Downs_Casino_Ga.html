<p>UK responsible gambling charity GambleAware announced a new initiative, a pilot project for a new residential rehabilitation program for gambling disorders, issuing an invitation to tender.</p>
<p>Targeting Mental Health Problems and Complexities</p>
<p>The pilot project is set to extend the National Gambling Treatment Service, placing the focus on complex and co-morbid presentation among users of the GambleAware service.</p>
<p>“Based on the existing treatment landscape we know that there are gaps in the provision of residential care to address co-occurring health needs, including mental health problems and complexities.” Tender Statement, GambleAware</p>
<p>The need to address gaps in the provision of treatment for co-occurring mental health issues was supported by the findings of the Treatment Needs and Gap Analysis, as well as GambleAware’s Annual Statistics for the National Gambling Treatment Service, the charity outlined in the tender statement.</p>
<p>GambleAware will require candidates to develop a specialized program to address treatment gaps, and the winning project which is expected “to fill the gaps in the provision of treatment and explore potential uptake of services among those currently underrepresented”, will receive £1 million in funding over a period of 3 years.</p>
<p>Gambling Disorder just the Starting Point</p>
<p>The charity is looking for bids from organizations qualified to provide residential rehabilitation for people suffering from gambling disorders and complexities like co-morbid alcohol as well as substance abuse.</p>
<p>Bidders interested in the tender process should be able to demonstrate a certain level of competency related to the treatment of gambling disorder, which is considered to be the primary diagnosis and the subsequent clinical management of co-occurring mental health needs and misuse of substances.</p>
<p>GambleAware is inviting those willing to apply at an engagement event scheduled for Friday, June 18, as it will offer the opportunity to receive further clarifications regarding the brief and asking questions. Following the event, the charity will publish FAQs on its website. GambleAware will continue to accept applications for the tender until the deadline date of Friday, July 16.</p>
