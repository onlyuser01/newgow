<p>The Monday Night Football game of Week 9 of the 2023 NFL is the duel taking place at MetLife Stadium on November 6 – Los Angeles Chargers vs. New York Jets. Keep reading our MNF prediction piece to see who we think will win</p>
<p>The 2023 NFL season was supposed to be one of the best in the recent history of the New York Jets, but their new quarterback Aaron Rodgers got injured on his debut. Nevertheless, even without him leading the offense, the Jets have been doing alright. They’re 4-3 overall, with three wins in a row, one of which happened against last season’s NFC winners, the Philadelphia Eagles.</p>
<p>In the Week 9 MNF game, they’re playing against the Chargers who are 3-4 on the season, with each of those wins happening against teams with a negative record. Is it time for them to strike down an in-form opponent? Judging by the Chargers vs. Jets odds, the answer is yes. But if the 2023 NFL season has thought us something, it’s that the odds can be misleading.</p>

<p>Bookies Have Faith in Los Angeles Chargers</p>
<p>The Chargers are coming to East Rutherford following their fourth win of the season. Last weekend, they defeated the Chicago Bears at home with 30-13 on the scoreboard. It was their best performance of the 2023 NFL season, which explains why their Week 9 MNF odds for the moneyline market are as short as -154.</p>
<p>They’re seen as three-point favorites in the Monday Night Football game, which is going to be the fourth time this season that they’re given the role of the favorite. In each of the previous three cases, they justified it. They defeated the Minnesota Vikings, Las Vegas Raiders, and Chicago Bears.</p>
<p>However, none of those teams is as good as Charger’s next opponent. In fact, each of those teams currently has a negative record. The NY Jets, on the other hand, are .571.</p>
<p>Confidence is High in New York Jets Locker Room</p>
<p>The Jets started the 2023 NFL season with a win over the Buffalo Bills, which was unexpected, but they weren’t too happy about the triumph because their new QB got injured in that game. Zach Wilson took Aaron Rodgers’ place as the Jets signal-caller and has been alright so far.</p>

<p>Still, the reason why the Jets went on to win the last three games is that their defense was brilliant. In 2023, they’re allowing just 18.4 points per game, which puts them in the No. 8 spot on the list of the NFL’s best defenses.</p>
<p>That number is even more impressive if you look just at the last three games. In that case, the Jets’ average is 15.0. There are only two teams in the NFL that have done better defensively in the last three game weeks.</p>
<p>Los Angeles Chargers vs. New York Jets Prediction</p>
<p>The Week 9 Monday Night Football odds suggest the Chargers are going to win, but we feel as if the Jets can stage an upset. These guys are fantastic defensively, meaning that they should be able to keep the opposition to a relatively low number of points. If they pull it off, all that’s needed for a win is that Zach Wilson &amp; Co. don’t make any huge mistakes.</p>
<p>Pick: New York Jets to win</p>
