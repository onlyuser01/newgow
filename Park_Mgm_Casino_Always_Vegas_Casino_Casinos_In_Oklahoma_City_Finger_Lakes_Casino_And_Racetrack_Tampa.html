<p>About 2 years ago, I found out on the night of October 22/23</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don't have access to my account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The last deposit was from my card on October 22 at 4</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>last number 2820 for the amount of PLN 40 without bonus, I am attaching the screenshot,</p>
<p>I played slot machines and in the endorphina - royal x-mass slot I won about PLN 1,600. When I wanted to make a withdrawal, I received information that I had to enter a confirmation code sent to my phone number, which was not my phone number, I went to my profile to update my phone number, no I could update it, so I asked for an update in the chat support, and that's why my suspicions fall on someone from Mostbet casino support. I provided my current phone number and then the agent wrote to me that he couldn't help me and gave me a Gmail address for customer service. I sent them an @ to ask them to change the phone number in accordance with the instructions from the chat agent. because someone from the staff was supposed to contact me. After some time, I received a message on Whatsapp from Mostbet support, (I am attaching a photo of my profile from before the theft of my money and after the theft until now. The message started with the sentence Hello, dear customer, you requested a change of phone number, during the further conversation I was asked for personal documents to verify my identity, it did not arouse my suspicions because it is a normal procedure in casinos and the agent informed me that during verification there may be problems with logging in to the account and it may take a while.</p>
<p>I wanted to check the verification progress and realized that I couldn't restore the mostbet website and other websites were opening and after a few hours I logged in from another device and it turned out that I couldn't log in, my password had been changed, when I tried to recover my password I didn't receive the verification code in my Gmail. , and no information about an attempt to change the password. Finally, after a few hours, I managed to log in using my Google account and then I noticed the account balance was PLN 0.40 and there were two withdrawals in my transaction history:</p>
<p>22/10/23 at 20;50 for the amount of PLN 649 and 20;50 for the amount of PLN 961 to a credit card with initial numbers 532154 and ending numbers 9036</p>
<p>Panicked, I was sure that the thief had stolen my money and also my personal data, I asked for help on all customer support channels, asking for help because I realized that apart from the money, the thief had stolen all my data, the staff ignored me and blocked my account. Therefore, please check the details of the card to whom it is issued because I am afraid that someone has my details.</p>
<p>I am waiting for quick information and thank you very much for your willingness to help.</p>
<p>I held off on sending any attachments with this message because I want to make sure you don't share them publicly</p>
