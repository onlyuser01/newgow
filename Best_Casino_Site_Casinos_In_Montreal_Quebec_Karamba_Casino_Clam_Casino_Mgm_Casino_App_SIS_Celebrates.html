    <h1>Best Casino Site Casinos In Montreal Quebec Karamba Casino Clam Casino Mgm Casino App SIS Celebrates</h1>

<p>Sports Information Services has been able to deliver on some of the most exciting products in iGaming, with one such product being the 49’s Live Draws which celebrates its 25th anniversary. The game was originally launched in 1996 and was purchased by SIS in 2020.</p>
<p>The company immediately decided to refresh the game and benefit from its legacy and deeply rooted status in the gaming community, and with no small number of respected brands that have shown a taste for the format.</p>
<p>Through the deployment of innovative graphics and mechanics, SIS has been able to rapidly increase the appeal of the product and ensure that it’s well-received among modern players.</p>
<p>As part of that rebranding push, the company established a twice-daily live draw by the name of “The Original Live Draw.” SIS expanded that offer with a 39’s draw, to add to the possible experiences. The 39’s draws take place every 15 minutes and seek to create more betting opportunities for players who are keen on exploring all the details.</p>
<p>And if this isn’t enough, SIS was able to establish the 15’s draw, which is conducted every two minutes and offers an even more action-packed experience for those who are interested in having them. The 49’s brand has been doing particularly well, offering a buffet of numbers betting and virtual racing products.</p>
<p>Appealing to Big Brands and Their Customers</p>
<p>SIS’s live draws have been a particularly successful part of its offer, helping various retail and digital outlets benefit from them. Brands such as Coral, Ladbrokes, William Hill, Betfred, and Boyle Sports have all benefited from the offer.</p>
<p>SIS has also invested in the 49s.co.uk brand making sure that it would be mobile-ready so that it can meet the current consumer preferences and establish a distinct visual identity that helps with further marketing efforts. SIS head of product proposition Jess Mills said:</p>
<p>“We’re delighted to be able to mark the 25th anniversary of 49’s with the news that our revamped numbers brand and range extension has successfully been driving profitability for our online and retail operators.”</p>
<p>The news was welcomed by Entain consumer PR director Simon Clare who added that the 49’s draw had gone a long way. However, 25 years later, the draw is still here and guided by SIS to a new level of success, and able to reach new audiences.</p>
<p>“49’s continues to be a very popular product with our Ladbrokes and Coral customers, and they continue to follow their favorite presenters closely and have a real affinity with the daily lunch and teatime draws,” Clare added.</p>
