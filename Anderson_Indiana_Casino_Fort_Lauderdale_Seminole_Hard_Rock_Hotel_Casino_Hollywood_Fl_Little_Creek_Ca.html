<p>Bragg Gaming Group has introduced its Player Account Management with Merkur in the Czech Republic. As a result of this partnership, Merkur will have access to what is billed as an “all-in-one platform” that offers real-time data and marketing tools to help casino operators bolster their day-to-day activities.</p>
<p>Merkur to Benefit from Bragg’s Unique PAM Solution</p>

Merkur players will get access to excellent gameplay experiences that are injected into the gaming lobby and make for a strong variety of options.</p>
<p>Merkur stands to benefit from a single wallet, omnichannel and cross-platform product. The company will further benefit from the FUZE player engagement offering which is designed to help partner operators boost their reach, conversions, and retentions. This solution features popular options, such as free rounds, missions, quests, and tournaments, which makes for a wholesome experience across the board.</p>

Bragg Gaming Group CCO Chris Looney commented on this partnership and said:</p>
<p>Providing such a prominent operator as Merkur with our PAM solution is a fantastic achievement for us and we are excited to now be up and running, powering their operation in the Czech Republic. This deal also sees us strengthening our presence in the country and we look forward to further building on this partnership and providing local players with first-class entertainment.
