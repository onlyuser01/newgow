<p>EveryMatrix’s B2B sportsbook division, OddsMatrix, has reported its best year to date, posting outstanding results in 2023. The company, which specializes in providing tier-one operators with data feeds, has been happy to see its results consistently increase over the past 12 months, and the supplier signed a string of prominent partnerships with some of the leading companies in Europe and beyond.</p>
<p>In Europe alone, there was a jump of 75% of the total bets, tallying up the number of placed wagers with the help of OddsMatrix’s solutions to 183m. This is a significant increase from the 109m placed in 2022. It’s not just a matter of volume, however, as profitability has also been on an upright trajectory and coincidentally hit a 90% margin, with the company reporting €191.1m in 2023 in profits compared to €100.2m in 2022.</p>
<p>OddsMatrix CEO Tor Skeie has welcomed the immense work that has been done in the past 12 months and said that the results underlined those efforts and proved that hard work pays off. The executive added:</p>
<p>"This is now paying off with a record set of numbers that we fully intend to continue to build on in 2024 and beyond."</p>
<p>Through a series of strategic commercial partnerships, OddsMatrix has become an invaluable partner to some of the world’s largest betting brands, and the company is going to carry this responsibility into the new year as well.</p>
<p>The uptake has been notable in the live events segment as well, where OddsMatrix has been striving to provide partners with an unmatched experience and guarantee a variety of options for consumers.</p>
<p>EveryMatrix has touted the milestones and their significance, noting that OddsMatrix carried out some complicated yet highly profitable integrations with the Hungarian National Lottery and bet-at-home, a betting and gaming brand.</p>
<p>Both were celebrated at the time, but the results of these strategic moves are now beginning to show on the company’s bottom line. EveryMatrix’s products had to be integrated with bet-at-home.de through a custom-built platform, which was both challenging and required significant investment and consideration in its execution.</p>
<p>Another noteworthy milestone that the company wanted to emphasize as important and leading to its profitability was the launch of the TippMixPro sportsbook, which utilizes OddsMatrix solutions and feeds.</p>
<p>OddsMatrix also secured prominent partnerships with established companies such as Kindred Group during the period doubly reaffirming the company’s technological prowess and acumen.</p>
