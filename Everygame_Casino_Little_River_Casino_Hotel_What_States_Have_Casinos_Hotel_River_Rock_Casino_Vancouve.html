<p>Amid rampant cheating, Infinity Wards has issued a final warning to players who use third-party software to gain fraudulent or unfair advantage in Call of Duty Modern Warfare and Warzone.</p>
<p>Infinity Wards Confirms It Will Address Cheating in CoD Franchise</p>
<p>For a long while, Call of Duty Warzone and Modern Warfare players have been bothered by unabashed hackers and cheaters. Infinity Ward, the company behind the games, is finally stepping up its efforts.</p>
<p>After it first introduced a ranked system that matched suspected cheaters against one another, the company has released a new statement outlining its plan to clamp down on perpetrators.</p>
<p>Infinity Ward released an official statement on Twitter cautioning that more players will be banned in a bid to clamp down on wallhacks, aimbots, stat hacks, and more unauthorized third-party software.</p>
<p>“Cheating will not be tolerated,” the tweet warned. “More banwaves are coming. If you receive a ban it is for unauthorized manipulation of game data,” the message explained. Infinity cautioned players to not “fall” for third-party services offering to boost player gameplay via fraudulent modifications.</p>
<p>Since Infinity Ward has been struggling to tell well-intended modifications of the game from fraudulent attempts, the company is urging players to default to game software only or face the consequences.</p>
<p>Using a third-party software or mod, and especially a hack, is now a bannable offense, the company warned. The statement went further to encourage players to play by the rules:</p>
<p>“Avoid tutorials and services that offer ways to modify your camo. Anything that suggests altering the memory on your console or PC in order to acquire new gear, items or loadouts beyond what is offered in-game is a hack, and is considering cheating.”</p>
<p>Addressing Mass Cheating Not a Piece of Cake</p>
<p>While cheaters have had some leeway, Infinity Ward is stepping up efforts to curb hacking. Yet, the company may have on its hands a problem that is threatening to spiral out of control despite Infinity Ward’s best intentions.</p>
<p>Warzone and Modern Warfare have been plagued by unchecked cheating for months now, so much that high-profile streamers had to step in and highlight the issue. Many Twitch personalities have been posting excerpts from their game with commentary, explaining in-depth why and how a person had cheated.</p>
<p>According to Jack “CouRage” Dunlop and NICKMERCS, Call of Duty’s latest games now face an existential crisis that might force many people to migrate to another shooter. With Hyper Scape and Valorant readily available, and arguably better moderated and protected, this is not too difficult to imagine.</p>
<p>With a new instalment in the game just around the corner, Infinity Ward has to first ensure the integrity of the current games, especially if they want to see Call of Duty progress as a fully-fledged esports title.</p>
<p>According to ESPN, a single slot in the Call of Duty esports league costs $25 million. If interest in the game dies down because of cheating, investors may feel displeased to say the least.</p>
