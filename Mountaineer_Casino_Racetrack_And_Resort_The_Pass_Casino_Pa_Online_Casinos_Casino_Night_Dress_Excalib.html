<p>The data and tech security specialist for the iGaming and gambling industries has launched successfully in North Carolina</p>
<p>The company that has more than 25 years of experience operating and handling sensitive information for the industry is now all systems go in the state with an array of solutions, including its managed hosting, connectivity, cloud, and security products.</p>
<p>North Carolina Becomes Latest Frontier for Continent 8 in USA</p>
<p>This comes at a time when North Carolina has gone ahead with the regulation of its sports gambling industry which will feature 12 dedicated sportsbooks, providing both online and mobile services to their customers, as well as retail offering.</p>
<p>The official launch date has been set for early 2024 with the state gearing up and suppliers and operators already looking to set up shop. This is where Continent 8 Technologies comes in with its established track record for delivering a full suite of 360-degree solutions needed by sportsbooks to establish a robust footprint in new markets and provide customers with a reliable experience across the board.</p>
<p>Continent 8 Technologies CRO Nick Nally welcomed the opportunity to see his company establish a footprint in yet another market. He said that Continent 8 has a robust knowledge of regulation and can help new companies deploy their products into new markets without any traction.</p>
<p>North Carolina will be a significant online sports betting market and is one that we know our customers have set their sights on. We can now offer our suite of iGaming hosting, connectivity, cloud, and security solutions to these operators who can be confident they are fully compliant with the requirements set by the regulator,” Nally continued.</p>
<p>Building Robust Infrastructure to Deliver the Necessary Products</p>
<p>Continent 8 Technologies CPO Justin Cosnett was similarly excited about the company’s new rollout in the United States. He said that this new entry was aligned with the company’s aggressive strategy to continue strengthening its regional presence. The company delivers infrastructure solutions and has even made multiple investments in different sites to ensure the smooth operation of the supported products.</p>
<p>Continent 8 recently secured a license to operate as a supplier in Michigan, with the Gaming Control Board clearing the company for launch.</p>
