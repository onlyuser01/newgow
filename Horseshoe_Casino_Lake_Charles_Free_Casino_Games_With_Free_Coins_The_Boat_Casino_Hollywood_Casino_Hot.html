<p>The next Super Bingo tournament will take place on April 3-5 and will provide players with the opportunity to play bingo and socialize</p>
<p>The Plaza Hotel &amp; Casino, a gambling property in Las Vegas, has unveiled the dates of its 2023 Super Bingo tournaments. The first such competition has been scheduled for April 3-5, after which the casino will continue hosting tournaments almost every month.</p>
<p>The upcoming tournament will feature a $160,000 prize pool. The casino announced that both days of the tournament will have 19 $1,199 games. Players will also have a shot at a $50,000 super coverall on both days of the event. In addition to the two coveralls, there will be a $5,000 second chance coverall and a $3,000 third chance coverall each day.</p>
<p>The April tournament will take place in Plaza Hotel &amp; Casinoâ€™s recently-renovated ballroom. As usual, hundreds of bingo enthusiasts from all over the US are expected to participate.</p>
<p>Locals will have the privilege to benefit from a special promotion that allows them to bring a friend for free. Otherwise, players must pay $160 to sign up for the tournament. Alternatively, they can pay $300 for a room-and-bingo package that covers the tournament entry and a four-night stay from Sunday to Wednesday.</p>
<p>Plaza Hotel &amp; Casino who choose to participate in the Super Bingo event will be provided with two daubers and a six-on paper pack. In addition, the casino will give players boxed launches and free drinks. After the first day of the tournament, Plaza Hotel &amp; Casino will gift $10 in free slot spins to all tournament participants.</p>
<p>Super Bingo Attracts Players from the US and Beyond</p>
<p>Super Bingo attracts hundreds of players to Downtown Las Vegas each year. According to Plaza Hotel &amp; Casino, its tournaments are visited even by players from Hawaii and Canada.</p>
<p>Some of the appeals that make these events so attractive are definitely the tempting prizes and opportunities to socialize with other bingo players from all over the US and beyond.</p>
<p>Because of the popularity of these events, Plaza Hotel &amp; Casino will be hosting one each month after April, with the exception of July and December. If players, by chance, miss out on the opportunity to participate in the April tournament, they can come back to Downtown Vegas on May 1-3 for the next one.</p>
<p>Other tournaments are scheduled for June 5-7, August 7-9, September 11-13, October 9-11 and November 27-29.</p>
