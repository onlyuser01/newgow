    <h1>The Mirage Casino Beau Rivage Casino Mississippi Netent Casino Casino Near By Casino Laughlin Nevada</h1>

<p>Dear geutasis,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting this complaint. I am sorry to hear about your issue. Please allow me to ask you a few questions to make sure I understand your situation completely.</p>
<p>Do you see the internal server error message every time you open the game, or has it happened only once?</p>
<p>Do you have the same problem with other games as well?</p>
<p>I checked the casino's Terms and Conditions and this is what I found:</p>
<p>6.19 In case of software malfunctions, erroneous financial transactions, etc., the Company has the right to write off incorrectly accrued funds from the customer's accounts, and also undertakes to refund all amounts incorrectly written off or not accrued due to technical problems to customers' accounts during 30 (thirty) days from the time such failure has been detected.</p>
<p>6.20 In case the Company has mistakenly (due to a technical error in the winnings table, an error caused by a human factor or a different kind of error) replenished the customer’s account with funds that do not belong to him, then this amount will be considered the property of the Company and will be deducted from the customer’s account. If a customer withdraws funds that do not belong to him before the error was noticed, then the mistakenly paid amount (without prejudice to the legal means and actions of the customer) will be considered as a customer's debt to the Company. In the event of an inaccurate replenishment of the balance, the customer must immediately notify the Company via e-mail.</p>
<p>Do you see the transactions from this game in your betting history?</p>
<p>When was the last time you were in contact with customer support regarding this issue?</p>
<p>I hope we will be able to help you resolve this problem as soon as possible. Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards</p>
<p>Veronika</p>
