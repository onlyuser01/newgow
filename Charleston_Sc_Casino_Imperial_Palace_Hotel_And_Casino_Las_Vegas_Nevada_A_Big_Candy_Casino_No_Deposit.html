<p>PandaScore, an esports data professional, has launched a new esports-specific product, BetBuilder. This release follows on the introduction of another similar solution, the Widget 2.0 product. Thanks to the BetBuilder solution, PandaScore will be capable of deploying customized betting options to operators and their customers, and for individual competitive gaming contests.</p>
<p>Designed to Cater to Esports Fan Preferences</p>
<p>Presently, PandaScore’s product supports Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, League of Legends, and Dota 2. Players who have access to an operator with the BetBuilder product will be able to bet on markets from the same match, the company details, on odds that are built uniquely for the BetBuilder solutions.</p>
<p>This contrasts with simple “combinations or multiplication” the company informs in a press release. Operators who leverage PandaScore technology and esports solutions have already been known to achieve much better results when it comes to delivering margin performance, which notches up double-digit growth.</p>
<p>The company also says that Player Props markets also benefit from the BetBuilder solution. PandaScore explains that esports players prefer to place smaller amounts of bets across numerous markets and events, or players and teams. Moving forward, players will be able to benefit from PandaScore’s BetBuilder feature to create an enriching and fulfilling experience.</p>
<p>BetBuilder Exceeds Operator Expectations</p>
<p>One of the operators to have launched with the PandaScore BetBuilder solutions already is CSGO500. The company’s sportsbook manager offered positive feedback for the new solution introduced by PandaScore and what it has been able to already achieve for the operator:</p>
<p>As soon as we integrated PandaScore’s BetBuilder, it exceeded our expectations. Ever since launching the product we’ve noticed a vast increase in the betting volume, and the margins have been hitting double digits, which is all we’ve ever wanted. CSGO500</p>
<p>Panda Score CEO Flavien Guillocheau was similarly pleased with the launch, and he said that the BetBuilder product was designed to give esports fans an improved esports betting experience, which the chief executive believes has happened. “Our partners will unlock new means of engaging with their customers through more vibrant connections and greater choices on the events they bet on – something we should always strive for as an industry,” Guillocheau added.</p>
