    <h1>Nd Casinos Big Fish Casino Wizard Of Oz Casino Slots The Casino At Dania Beach Pittsburgh Rivers Cas</h1>

<p>Dear Jeffro888,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. I have checked general terms and conditions, and this is what I found (here):</p>
<p>"8.9.1 In order to qualify for subsequent bonuses, the player needs to make a minimum deposit of $20 between the last bonus credited to their casino account and the date of the next Promotion offer."</p>
<p>Could you please advise if you have redeemed any free promotional offer from this casino previously? Ideally, forward your cashier and bonus histories to petronela.k@casino.guru.</p>
<p>I hope we will be able to help you to resolve this issue as soon as possible. Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
<p>PS: I have adjusted the disputed amount from $1,416 to $100 as the winnings were accumulated from a free bonus entirely.</p>
<p>"8.5.4 For free spins offers that are additional to a match deposit offer (ie. offered as part of a match deposit package as an added bonus), the maximum withdrawal allowed is $100 on those particular free spins.</p>
<p>All free spins bonuses carry a cash out multiplier which means that the maximum value that can be converted to cash is 5 times the value of the free spin bonus. A maximum cash-in amount applies to standard Free Money/Free Spins/Loyalty Points Redeemed/Competition or Tournament Prizes where there is no deposit required.</p>
<p>In order to withdraw cash prizes won from tournaments, leaderboards or any other competitions, a deposit must have been made prior to the events’ commencement.</p>
<p>10.6 Players who have previously made deposits and have won using a free money offer/no deposit bonus (i.e. no deposit was made), a maximum withdrawal amount of $100 applies."</p>
