<p>The Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation, the province’s government-owned operator, has inked a multi-year agreement with Major League Baseball, a professional baseball organization. The agreement will see OLG as the league’s official betting partner.</p>
<p>OLG Teamed Up with the MLB</p>
<p>This deal is notably MLB’s first sports betting partnership in Ontario. Thanks to it, OLG’s Proline sportsbook will be able to distribute MLB content. Furthermore, the agreement will help the operator promote its content thanks to various promotions and social media activations with the baseball league.</p>
<p>The MLB will also power the partnership with its own comprehensive responsible gambling measures. The sports league has vowed to protect the integrity of the game both on and off the field. Meanwhile, OLG will use its PlaySmart platform to provide bettors with everything they need to make informed decisions.</p>
<p>The Proline sportsbook allows Canadian punters to bet on sports through one of its 10,000 shops in the province. In addition, bettors can take their sports betting experience on the web thanks to the PROLINE+ platform.</p>
<p>Proline was launched in August last year and was Ontario’s first legal sportsbook. It allows sports fans to place wagers on some of the most popular leagues in the world, including European championships, American sports and college football. Thanks to the agreement with the MLB, PROLINE+ users will now be able to access promotional new content, including engaging free-to-play games.</p>
<p>The Two Partners Hope to Engage Baseball Fans</p>
<p>Kenny Gersh, the executive vice president of business development for MLB, commented on the partnership with OLG. Gersh emphasized that the league wants to expand the sport’s influence and that there is no better way to do that than to partner with knowledgeable companies in their respective regions. The MLB trusts OLG’s expertise in its home region and is sure that the Canadian operator will help the league grow.</p>
<p>Dave Pridmore, the chief digital and strategy officer for OLG, also shared his thoughts. According to him, the opportunity to team up with a world-class organization will help OLG evolve. Thanks to the new partnership, the operator will be able to offer exciting one-of-a-kind interactive experiences. Therefore, it will engage PROLINE+ customers with supreme sports content.</p>
<p>In other news, OLG recently expanded its partnership deal with PaySafe. Ontario, on the other hand, continues to be an attractive destination for gambling companies. A few days ago, SkillOnNet launched three of its brands in the province.</p>
