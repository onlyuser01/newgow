    <h1>Hard Rock Hotel Casino Atlantic City Casino Online Bonus Kickapoo Lucky Casino Tiverton Casino Hotel</h1>

<p>Spain is about to become the focal point of another poker tournament this year with the Casino Barcelona hosting the namesake Golden Poker Championship Barcelona Experience, which will attract players from all over the world to come and sit at the tables and square up against talented opponents.</p>
<p>Poker Tournaments Make Return to Spain and Europe</p>
<p>As COVID-19 restrictions are easing up, the opportunities for more live poker are on the table and the upcoming event will run from April 25 through May 3. The exact number of the attendees has not been discussed yet, but there will be something for everyone, with Pot Limit, Omaha, and Texas Hold’em all featured as some of the viable gaming options.</p>
<p>The casino is happy to deliver on yet another excellent event in the country following the success of the previous edition which saw people converge in Casino Barcelona in October 2021 and try their hand at various games and tournaments. Speaking of, the new edition will feature a total of 13 events that will range and cover various buy-ins to make the experience more accessible for anyone interested.</p>
<p>Players are welcome to join the Main Event which will be accessible for $430 + $48 or try their hand at the Super High Roller Bounty which starts at roughly $1,110 buy-in. All buy-ins will be listed in euros, so keep this in mind. In the meantime, there are already satellite events that may qualify you for some of the big tournaments.</p>
<p>To make the meet-up even more exciting, the organizers have been contacting players from different countries and trying to form teams for the Golden Cup Nations, which will pit players from across the world and group them together in teams based on their nationality. This is an interesting approach given that poker players are usually a solitary lot who prefer to play on their own. Casino Barcelona wants to upend expectations and introduce a new dynamic.</p>
<p>More Events to Look Forward To</p>
<p>The hosts are also creating special packages to be claimed through the satellite events. The two prize packages guarantee accommodation and an entry into the Main Event, which is usually what other big events, such as the World Series of Poker do. Casino Barcelona is quickly turning itself into a focal point of poker in Europe.</p>
<p>The venue will be hosting the European Poker Tour or EPT from August 8 through August 21 which will feature some interesting faces. Before this, though, the facility will play host to the Spanish Poker Championship. All in all, for a well-rounded live poker experience, you may want to keep Casino Barcelona bookmarked and check in regularly with the venue’s upcoming events and plans.</p>
