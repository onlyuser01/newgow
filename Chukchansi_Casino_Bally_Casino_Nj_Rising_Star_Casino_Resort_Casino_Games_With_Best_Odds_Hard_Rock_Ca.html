<p>23XI Racing has teamed up with DraftKings as an official betting, gaming, and fantasy sports partner ahead of the EchoPark Automotive Texas Grand Prix this weekend.</p>
<p>Bubba Wallace’s Team Adds DraftKings as Partner</p>
<p>DraftKings has teamed up with Bubba Wallace’s team becoming the first official DFS, iGaming, and sports betting partner for 23XI Racing. The move is subject to regulatory approval as per the press release but is expected to clear fully and allow the sportsbook to continue building upon its momentum in motorsports.</p>
<p>The partnership is launched in preparation for this weekend’s race at the EchoPark Automotive Texas Grand Prix at Circuit of the Americas. With the event around the corner, scheduled for Sunday, May 23, DraftKings will use this opportunity to extend its clout with professional motorsports and racing, as the sportsbook is already an official fantasy partner for NASCAR. NASCAR has secured a number of authorized gaming partners in recent months, including partnerships with WynnBET and BetMGM.</p>
<p>DraftKings CBO Ezra Kucharz said that joining forces with 23XI Racing marked a new beginning for the company and pursuit of further growth opportunities. Apart from the clear synergies achieved between the companies, Kucharz said that his company admired Wallace’s advocacy for social justice and inclusion, equity, and belonging.</p>
<p>On this count, Kucharz explained, DraftKings aligned perfectly with the esteemed driver’s values. DraftKings and 23XI Racing will explore new social media and app opportunities to engage with racing fans and create cross-channel content through video series featuring race previews and data presented by DraftKings.</p>
<p>DraftKings will definitely rub off on NASCAR fans as the company is also the primary partner of the No. 23 Camry at the NASCAR CUP Series Race at Pocono Raceway on Sunday, June 27. DraftKings will also launch a free-to-play pool ahead of the upcoming event this weekend with the rewards, including Bubba Wallace-branded merchandise.</p>
<p>An Alignment of Values and Long-Term Objectives</p>
<p>23XI Racing president Steve Lauletta argued that DraftKings is a leader in sports and entertainment, and as such, it made for a great fit for the racing team. “Adding DraftKings allows us to bring unique experiences to our fans as we continue to grow our reach showcasing our team to fans outside the NASCAR platform, as well as work together in support for social justice and other Inclusion, Equality, and Belonging efforts” Lauletta explained.</p>
<p>Wallace commented on the partnership himself and said that he was excited to see what DraftKings and 23XI Racing can achieve working together. The partnership is a landmark for NASCAR and motorsports as more teams seek out closer ties with betting companies. DraftKings previously launched eNASCAR daily fantasy contests when most races were brought to a halt in 2020.</p>
