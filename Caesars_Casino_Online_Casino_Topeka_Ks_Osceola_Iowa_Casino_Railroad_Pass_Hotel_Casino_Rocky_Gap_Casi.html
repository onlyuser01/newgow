    <h1>Caesars Casino Online Casino Topeka Ks Osceola Iowa Casino Railroad Pass Hotel Casino Rocky Gap Casi</h1>

<p>Hey Fellow Spinners!</p>
<p>I would like to know if everyone from everywhere is OK w/ Relax Gaming Slots being featured as the software for most Gurus' Tournament Competitions on site? I only ask because I am not able to play in them due to being from the USA, which Relax Gaming has suddenly deemed as ineligible to play their games!</p>
<p>I feel this to be a discriminating act of Relax Gaming, but w/ Guru choosing to continue to use their games for the slot tournaments doesn't fit w/ the non-discriminate ways Casino Guru handles all their other business!!! I do realize they have just now learned of the new exclusion by Relax Gaming, but was quite shocked to find that the new Tournaments, just beginning, were featuring Relax Gamings Slot machines!</p>
<p>"SUGAR RUSH" not included! I did get to play in that one, for it is a PRAGMATIC PLAY Slot!</p>
<p>So does anyone else out there have an opinion on this matter, regardless of your nationality! I'm very anxious to hear!</p>
<p>Thank You For Reading!</p>
<p>Please Share Your Thoughts!</p>
