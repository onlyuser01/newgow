    <h1>Richmond Grand Resort And Casino Seminole Casino Gambling Casino Near Me Hard Rock Casino Biloxi San</h1>

<p>Quick update!</p>
<p>This Casino is a real joke!</p>
<p>they reverted back the amount to my account for the second time after 6 days form the second withdrawal date!</p>
<p>new chat with the support</p>
<p>me: yes i have a huge problem can you check my account?</p>
<p>Support: How can I help you?</p>
<p>me: can you look into my account and please check what is wrong?</p>
<p>Support: I do not see anything wrong</p>
<p>me: its a huge problem with the withdrawal process, its been 2 times i request a withdrawal , wait a week and see the money reverted back into my account</p>
<p>the first time the support told me that it was an error with your payment gateway</p>
<p>that sent me the money and for some reason reverted back to my account</p>
<p>then the financial department decided to ignore my request and putted back the amount into my account</p>
<p>i requested for a second time and again!</p>
<p>Support: As far as I can see withdrawal was cancelled. I advise you to use a bank transfer the payment method. This one usually works</p>
<p>me: yes indeed this is what i requested both times!</p>
<p>support: The payment method where you need to put IBAN?</p>
<p>me: yes twice.... where is the financial department ? why don't they send an email?</p>
<p>what is the problem please? can you transfer me to the financial department?</p>
<p>support: I advise to try it once again, if will not works kindly contact us back and we will check it.</p>
<p>me: no, this advise will not help, i need real help. as you have absolutely no idea what is happening, you are unable even to see what payment method i requested my transfer to be sent to</p>
<p>support: Thanks for waiting, your request has been sent to the financial department, once is checked you will be informed via email</p>
<p>me: can you please put me in contact with someone that can tell me exactly what is happening with my withdrawals?</p>
<p>me: can they reinitate the withdrawal ? i am tiered of doing this and waiting 5 days to see the money back into my account without any email from your financial department?â€¦</p>
<p>my iban is correct ! where is the problem please?</p>
<p>support: Can I help you with anything else?</p>
<p>me: yes my questions if you can answer them</p>
<p>support: As I mentioned above, your request has been sent, once is checked you will be informed via emal</p>
<p>me: and then i asked the following: can they reinitate the withdrawal ? i am tiered of doing this and waiting 5 days to see the money back into my account without any email from your financial department?</p>
<p>and you did not reply to this</p>
<p>me: can you please also send to my email a copy of this request please? that you sent to the financial department?</p>
