<p>G2E Asia Expo to Reunite the World’s Leading iGaming Experts in May</p>
<p>The Global Gaming Expo Asia (G2E) Asia is taking place on May 21-23, 2019. With a focus on the Asian gaming market, G2E offers international companies an opportunity to network, share know-how and expand their expertise.</p>
<p>Global Gaming Expo Asia Is Bringing Innovation to the Region</p>
<p>Held on May 21-23, 2019 in Macau, G2E Asia is one of the most prominent expos focusing on the gaming and entertainment industries in Asia, but also operating and evolving well beyond the region. Hosted by the American Gaming Association (AGA) and Reed Exhibitions, G2E Asia has a very clear global footprint.</p>
<p>G2E Asia is part of a broader initiative under the namesake exhibition series called G2E which was first launched back in June 2007 in Las Vegas, Nevada, the United States. The gathering focuses on several key verticals, offering unique networking opportunities for attendees.</p>
<p>Owing to the interest in the event, G2E Asia will not only be attended by regional businesses, but also by expanding and established companies. The expo provides attendees with brilliant opportunities to showcase innovative gaming products, find partners, appraise themselves of upcoming industry trends, and create new connections.</p>
<p>Some of the highlight of this year’s edition of G2E Asia will include:</p>
<p>Gaming Regulators Networking Luncheon</p>
<p>Tech Talk</p>
<p>New Products</p>
<p>Networking Events</p>
<p>G2E Asia After Party</p>
<p>G2E Asia Awards</p>
<p>There will be a number of on-site events that have been planed during the three-day expo starting at the Venetian Macao on Tuesday, May 21, 2019.</p>
<p>The Event’s Schedule of Keynotes and Discussions</p>
<p>Every day of the expo promises to bring up interesting discussions that broach important topics applicable across the industry worldwide. The keynote address will be delivered by Melco Resorts &amp; Entertainment Limited Chairman and CEO Lawrence Ho between 9:30 and 10:20 local time.</p>
<p>At 13:30, an Inside Asian Gaming-backed forum will feature discussion about Asian markets attended by several important personalities in the industry, including:</p>
<p>Grant Govertsen, Managing Director, Head of Asia Equity Research, Union Gaming Securities Asia</p>
<p>Eric Landheer, Executive Director, Summit Ascent Holdings</p>
<p>William Shen, Senior Vice President &amp; Managing Director, Korea &amp; Japan, Caesars Entertainment Corp</p>
<p>lidad Tash, Senior Vice President Gaming &amp; Strategy, 2NT8 Limited</p>
<p>Another interesting panel will deal with “Mitigating Risks from Organized Crime &amp; Dealing with Junket”.</p>
<p>Day 2 – China’s Super Data and Macau’s Importance in the Region</p>
<p>Day 2 will focus on how China’s big data can be leveraged to track customer habits and leverage that information to the benefit of gaming businesses. The discussion will be headed by Bloomberg China Economist Fielding Chen and Bloomberg Intelligence Senior Analyst Vey-Sern Ling.</p>
<p>Another interesting topic will discuss the emerging Integrated Resort model during the “Business Trends for the Integrated Resort (IR) Model in Asia Pacific”</p>
<p>Day 3 – Regulation Is Back in Focus</p>
<p>Back on Day 3, guests will have an opportunity to hear from executives from various regulatory bodies around the world, discussing diverse trends insofar as regulating the industry is concerned.</p>
<p>Illinois Gaming Control Board former administrator Mark Ostrowski will be attending alongside his colleague from Nevada Gaming Control Board Enforcement Chief Karl Bennison and Alderny Gambling Control Commission (AGCC) Jorn Starck.</p>
<p>Day 3 will also focus on discussing how to better ensure responsible gambling practices on the casino level.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Each day of the event will come along with an opportunity to meet and talk to people which is the very essence of G2E. The Asia editions focuses on the region and gravitates closer to important hubs in Asia. However, the G2E expos have a clearly international footprint, allowing businesses from both hemispheres to continue exchanging and sharing know-how.</p>
