<p>Kiron Interactive, an award-winning software developer, has released iGoal, a highly anticipated soccer game that is set to redefine virtual sports. iGoal is created with modern 3D technology, its matches are available 24/7 and players will have a few betting options at their disposal.</p>
<p>iGoal will Support a Variety of Languages and it Will Be Easy to Set Up</p>
<p>The new game by Kiron is set to provide players with a unique soccer betting experience as it is powered by market-leading wagering algorithms and its matches are on-demand. Players can bet on single or multiple games and the potential winnings will be visible instantly.</p>
<p>Jason Pretorius, Kiron’s CEO, commented on the release by saying that iGoal is “an innovative game” and that the company is excited to launch it on a global scale. Pretorius added that iGoal is inspired by all of the previous releases by Kiron and it provides flexibility and engagement for both operators and players. It also takes “virtual betting to the next level.”</p>
<p>He concluded by saying that all leaders at Kiron are lucky to have such experienced team members that are able to develop and deliver cutting-edge products such as iGoal and in doing so, allow bettors to have the highest form of entertainment.</p>
<p>iGoal’s user interface (UI) aligns with the bet market selections perfectly and has numerous options for players. One of the most impressive features of this game is the fact that it includes live commentary, which contributes massively to the overall gameplay.</p>
<p>In terms of betting, cashouts in this game are instant and players can decide whether they want to bet on a single or multiple games. They can wager on up to 10 matches and some additional betting options include quick betting and repeat betting.</p>
<p>Kiron Inked A Distribution Deal With Playson in March</p>
<p>The last couple of months have been quite productive for Kiron in terms of increasing its global presence. In March, the provider linked up with Playson, a reputable iGaming content creator, through which both companies increased their presence in Africa.</p>
<p>Steven Spartinos, Kiron’s co-CEO, stated that the partnership with Playson allows the company to expand its service and product portfolio and that everyone at Kiron is looking forward “to a strong and prosperous relationship.”</p>
<p>Spartinos went on to say that even though slots, which is Playson’s specialty, are not the core business at Kiron. However, this partnership allows the company to take its offering to the next level.</p>
<p>Thanks to this partnership, some of the top-rated games by Playson will be available at Kiron’s operators. That includes the likes of Wolf Power Megaways, Lion Gems: Hold and Win, Solar Queen Megaways, 5 Fortunator, etc.</p>
