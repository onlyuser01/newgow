    <h1>Magic City Casino Bitplay Casino Punt Casino No Deposit Bonus Empire Casino Tropical Breeze Casino G</h1>

<p>Gaming technology provider GAN announced today it entered into a 10-year agreement with casino and hospitality operator Wynn Resorts, to provide iGaming and internet sports betting in Michigan. The business-to-business supplier of gambling software-as-a-service (SaaS) solutions expects to launch Wynn’s software platform in the state in November, alongside the first gambling operators, subject to acquiring all regulatory approvals.</p>
<p>The launch of Wynn Resorts’ online product offering will be part of an agreement signed between GAN and the Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians in March. The tribe operates 5 state casinos under the brand Kewadin Casinos.</p>
<p>Partnership with Kewadin Casinos</p>
<p>Under the terms of the deal with the Native tribe, GAN agreed to supply its technology platform for all casino properties operated by the brand, together with certain operational services. By that time, the tribe announced GAN requested to provide under the deal its platform and services to an unnamed major casino operator, which requested anonymity pending regulatory approval.</p>
<p>“We look forward to powering the Wynn brand in Michigan with our highly optimized technology platform and enabling Wynn to efficiently invest their marketing capital to attract loyal sports betting and iGaming players.” Jeffrey B. Berman, Chief Commercial Officer, GAN</p>
<p>GAN’s optimized enterprise software and proven get-to market capability will position Wynn Resorts in Michigan as an early mover, as soon as online gaming activities are launched by the casino operator. The gaming regulator in the Great Lakes State began accepting applications for online gambling in May.</p>
<p>Cross-Market Opportunity for Wynn</p>
<p>With 15 years of experience as a pure-play B2B supplier for the iGaming sector, GAN’s ability to tailor solutions to individual partner’s needs make them an appealing proposition for a national casino operator like Wynn Resorts, which will be able to cross sell its online casino product offering to a substantial database of residents within the Michigan region.</p>
<p>“We are pleased to onboard Wynn, with its national casino brand and substantial Michigan-region patron base, as a major operator client and are excited at the opportunity presented by potential roll-outs in multiple additional states in the future.” Jeffrey B. Berman, Chief Commercial Officer, GAN</p>
<p>In addition to the in-house developed casino games and third-parties aggregations, GAN will publish sports betting content procured by a third-party sports book content provider, which will be augmented by the strategic partner of Wynn Resorts, Betbull Limited.</p>
<p>After the announcement of the long-term sports betting and iGaming deal with Wynn Resorts, shares of GAN jumped 19% in early morning trade, reaching $19.35.</p>
