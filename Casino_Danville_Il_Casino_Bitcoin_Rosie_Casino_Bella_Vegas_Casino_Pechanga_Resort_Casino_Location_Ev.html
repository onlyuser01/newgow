    <h1>Casino Danville Il Casino Bitcoin Rosie Casino Bella Vegas Casino Pechanga Resort Casino Location Ev</h1>

<p>The new tables, VIP Blackjack and VIP Baccarat, are now available for online players in British Columbia, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan</p>
<p>Evolution, a leading provider of live casino games, has announced the launch of two new high-limit live casino tables in partnership with the British Columbia Lottery Corporation (BCLC) in Canada.</p>
<p>Evolution’s VIP Games Bring Exclusive Gambling Experience to BCLC’s PlayNow.com</p>
<p>Streaming live from Evolution’s Vancouver studio, these VIP games offer an opulent and immersive gaming experience. With higher minimum bets, they cater to high rollers and VIP players looking for an exclusive online gambling experience. These tables join the existing lineup of Evolution-powered live casino games and live game shows on BCLC’s PlayNow.com platform, which includes lottery, casino, sports betting, poker, bingo, and instant games.</p>
<p>Jeff Millar, chief commercial officer of North America at Evolution, expressed his satisfaction with the partnership’s progress. He stated: “Our initial agreement with BCLC, over five years ago now, was instrumental in Evolution creating its Canadian live casino studio. Since then, our relationship with BCLC has gone from strength to strength. We are proud to launch these new VIP tables and confident that VIP players will be attracted by this premium online gaming experience.”</p>
<p>The Evolution Vancouver studio, spanning an impressive 16,000 square feet, was purpose-built to provide live casino services for BCLC. Initially offering Live Roulette, Blackjack, and Baccarat games, the studio has grown over the years, expanding its game offerings and staff. Monica Bohm, VP of eGaming at BCLC, previously highlighted the significance of Evolution’s live casino portfolio for the corporation, stating that it helps keep BCLC at the forefront of gambling entertainment while creating local employment opportunities and generating revenue to support provincial initiatives in British Columbia.</p>
<p>BCLC Welcomes VIP Roulette by Evolution</p>
<p>In addition to VIP Blackjack and VIP Baccarat, Evolution also offers VIP versions of European and French Roulette. These VIP games follow the same live casino format but feature higher wagering limits to accommodate the preferences of VIP customers.</p>
<p>One of the other recent additions to BCLC’s game portfolio was an instant ticket game based on the popular board game Ticket to Ride, offering players a chance to experience the Canadian railway network and win prizes up to $50,000. Developed in collaboration with Pollard Banknote, the game features artwork that captures the essence of the tabletop experience.</p>
<p>In April, Light &amp; Wonder entered into a distribution agreement with ReelPlay, allowing the latter to supply its games to the BCLC. Hypernova Megaways was the first game to be featured in the BCLC’s content portfolio, with more games expected to be added in the future, showcasing Light &amp; Wonder’s commitment to supporting independent studios.</p>
