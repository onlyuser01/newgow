<p>CT Interactive, a Bulgarian company focused on developing and supplying games for online casinos, has expanded its presence in Europe through a deal with PepperMill Casino.</p>
<p>CT Interactive Pens Deal with peppermillcasino.be</p>
<p>Under the deal, the latter company will receive the provider’s suite of Dice slot games. As a result, PepperMill will be able to engage its players in Belgium with new engaging titles.</p>
<p>Some of the games that will become available to PepperMill’s Belgian players include well-known hits such as 50 Dice Treasures, 40 Mega Dice, 20 Dice Party, and 20 Dice Roosters, among others.</p>
<p>The deal will expand CT Interactive’s presence in Belgium and Europe as a whole, helping the ambitious company cement itself as a leading supplier of iGaming content. The deal will be just as beneficial for PepperMill, which will be able to provide its customers with best-in-class content that will keep them glued to their seats.</p>
<p>The Deal Will Benefit Both Companies</p>
<p>Spokespeople from the two companies addressed the new deal. Martin Ivanov, the director of business development for the Americas at CT Interactive said that his team is happy to launch its Dice slots portfolio with PepperMill.</p>
<p>We are delighted to announce that we launched 23 Dice Slots with the prominent casino brand with operations in Belgium. Martin Ivanov, director of business development Americas, CT Interactive</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Anthony Rus, peppermillcasino.be’s general director, said that the current agreement will bolster his company’s portfolio thanks to the popularity of the Dice slots line. He said that his team is looking forward to this partnership and the increased visibility it will bring to his company.</p>
<p>CT Interactive Has Been on a Roll</p>
<p>In other news, CT Interactive recently inked another similar deal with AdmiralBet in Montenegro. Thanks to that, the company was able to further consolidate its European footprint, reinforcing its presence in yet another market.</p>
<p>On that deal, Milena Tsankarska, CT Interactive’s head of business development for the EMEA region, said:</p>
<p>AdmiralBet has a multi-layered platform that offers a diverse portfolio of intriguing content. We see a lot of potential in the company, and we are excited to have our games positioned on such a fast-growing website. Milena Tsankarska, head of business development EMEA, CT Interactive</p>
<p>In December last year, the company also penned an agreement with Betmarket, one of the leading iGaming companies in Bulgaria. This deal bolstered CT Interactive’s presence in its home market and helped Betmarket jumpstart its business.</p>
<p>A week prior to that, CT Interactive also agreed to supply gaming content to the online casino platform Timeless Tech. Earlier than that, the provider signed an Italy-facing deal with MondoGaming.</p>
