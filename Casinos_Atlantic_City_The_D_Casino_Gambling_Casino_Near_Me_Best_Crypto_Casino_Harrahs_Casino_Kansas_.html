<p>Gaming software developer SoftSwiss has partnered with payment solutions provider Praxis Tech in a bid to expand its payment service provider portfolio and reach new customers.</p>
<p>A Wider Range of Payment Options Will Give SoftSwiss Access to New Markets</p>
<p>SoftSwiss’ new partnership with Praxis will help the company expand to new markets on a global scale, giving the gaming software developer access to a wide range of payment service providers across the whole world.</p>
<p>SoftSwiss will now be able to offer its huge array of clients many different payment options and services, streamlining its processes within a single payment hub, which will eventually bring in more revenue.</p>
<p>Praxis’ great technical support brought its completely tailor-made cashier system to SoftSwiss in just three hours. After the quick onboarding process, SoftSwiss’ over 300 clients had immediate access to over 500 payment service providers and more than 1000 alternative payment methods.</p>
<p>Excitement About the New Partnership from Both Companies</p>
<p>Natalie Agopian, who is Chief Security Officer at Praxis, elaborated that Praxis strives to be a reliable partner in all respects. She commented that the company prides itself on its customizable and personalized payment solution services. She added: “We make every effort to ensure we’re a reliable partner in every way. We’re able to cater to SoftSwiss’ need for a fast turnaround time – especially when it comes to enabling PSPs at short notice and during off-peak hours.”</p>
<p>SoftSwiss’ chief payment service provider officer Vadim Drozd also expressed his excitement about the new fruitful partnership. He was very pleased with Praxis’ around the clock technical support and their expertise. Drozd was very happy with the transparency and convenience of the services that Praxis provided and their ongoing assistance in each step of the onboarding process. Drozd went on to praise the company and its team: “The Praxis team goes above and beyond when it comes to technical support. They are truly experienced advisers in the field of payment processing and that is very valuable for SoftSwiss.“</p>
<p>Drozd also noted that Praxis particularly catered to the specific requests and needs of SoftSwiss, which makes the customizability and personalization of their services their most prominent and distinguishing feature.</p>
<p>SoftSwiss offers gambling companies an all-around service solution with its White Label, Turn Key and Crypto Casino products, catering to the needs of more than 300 online casinos in many countries around the world. SoftSwiss works constantly to expand its wide-ranging iGaming services with the addition of new jurisdictions, the latest being Greece, or the expansion of its cryptocurrency offering, with the latest addition being NEO.</p>
