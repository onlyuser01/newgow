    <h1>Real Cash Online Casino Yuma Casino Cherokee Casino Siloam Springs Casino Quest Promo Code Pala Casi</h1>

<p>Dear The GURU,</p>
<p>I have trouble with OddsRing casino, formerly known as Twin casino. The casino deliberately doesn't accept submitted documents that meet the stated requirements.</p>
<p>After the request for verification, various documents were sent to the casino.</p>
<p>On March 25, I completed and submitted the "Source of Wealth - Questionnaire"</p>
<p>On March 28, I sent documents confirming funds received as winnings from another casino to make a deposit at Twin Casino:</p>
<p>screenshot of my casino account with my personal details,</p>
<p>screenshot of casino winnings,</p>
<p>the transaction history of my Skrill payment wallet, which shows the receipt of winnings from the casino.</p>
<p>On May 08, I sent the following documents to the casino:</p>
<p>Skrill statement for the last 3 months (02/07/2023 - 05/08/2023). The preamble of the statement contains my personal data: Customer ID, email.</p>
<p>The Skrill payment system statement does not contain my personal data, such as first and last name, address and phone number. In this regard, I provide you - A screenshot of my personal Skrill profile with my personal data: last name and first name, address, phone number, Customer ID, email.</p>
<p>Screenshot of my casino account with my personal information: first and last name, phone number, email, date of my birth</p>
<p>Screenshot of my casino deposits for the last 90 days.</p>
<p>Screenshot of my withdrawals for the last 90 days.</p>
<p>The casino did not accept these documents, asking them to provide them in the best quality, but an extract from the Skrill payment wallet indicating the name and surname. to do this, I contacted Skrill directly with a request to send a statement in accordance with the requirements of Twin Casino.</p>
<p>On May 12, I sent the previously sent documents in good quality to Twin Casino, as well as a Skrill statement indicating the name and surname.</p>
<p>On June 12, I sent a Skrill statement for the last 3 months, indicating the counterparties and my personal data.</p>
<p>But, the documents were not accepted again!!!</p>
<p>Now the casino is asking me for a tax return for 2022 (even though I registered an account in March 2023) and despite the fact that I constantly indicated that I only used funds from winnings at another casino to play at the casino.</p>
<p>None of the casinos had such problems when passing verification! Moreover, having studied the information about the casino license, I hoped to receive high-quality services, but instead, for 3 months I send various documents for verification.</p>
<p>I can't solve the problem on my own, please help me.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance.</p>
