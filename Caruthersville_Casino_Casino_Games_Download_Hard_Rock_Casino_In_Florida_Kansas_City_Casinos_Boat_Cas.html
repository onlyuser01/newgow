<p>Ontario’s iGaming market is once again on the rise, following several quarters of stability. According to iGaming Ontario’s most recent performance report, the market’s metrics have increased across the board.</p>
<p>The report covers the third quarter of the 2023-24 fiscal year, which ran from October 1, 2023, to December 31, 2023.</p>
<p>The period saw Ontarian sports betting enthusiasts wager a total of $17.2 million ($12.75 in USD). This figure does not include promotional wagers and notably represents a 21% quarter-on-quarter increase. This handle resulted in total gaming revenue of $658 million ($487 million), reflecting a 22% increase over Q2.</p>
<p>Casino games, including slots, live and digital table games and peer-to-peer bingo accounted for almost $13.7 billion ($10.15 billion), or 79% of all the wagers. The vertical also accounted for $471 million ($349 million) of gaming revenue, or 71% of the total revenue.</p>
<p>Betting on sports, esports, props and novelty bets, as well as exchange betting, meanwhile, accounted for nearly $3.1 billion ($2.3 billion/18%) of total wagers. Betting also accounted for $171 million ($126.7 million/25%) of the total gaming revenue.</p>
<p>Finally, peer-to-peer poker accounted for $431 million ($319.3 million/2.5%) of all wagers and $17 million ($12.6 million/2.5%) of gaming revenue.</p>
<p>The aforementioned metrics account for Ontario’s 49 legal operators and 72 gaming websites.</p>
<p>There Were 1.2 Million Active Accounts in Ontario</p>
<p>In addition, iGaming Ontario reported that there were about 1.2 million active player accounts in Q3. The body explained that active player accounts are all accounts with cash and/or promotional wagering activity during the time period. This figure does not accurately represent the total number of player accounts since many have accounts with multiple operators.</p>
<p>iGaming Ontario also added that the average monthly spend per active player account stood at $186 ($138).</p>
<p>iGaming Ontario reaffirmed its commitment to continue monitoring the market and sharing a report on a quarterly basis.</p>
