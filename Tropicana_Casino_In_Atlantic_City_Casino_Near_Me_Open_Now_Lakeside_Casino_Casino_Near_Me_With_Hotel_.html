    <h1>Tropicana Casino In Atlantic City Casino Near Me Open Now Lakeside Casino Casino Near Me With Hotel</h1>

<p>I made a deposit of $50 USD via credit card through their payment provider "Paydo" This was deducted from my credit card instantly but never applied to my casino account.</p>
<p>The casino then wrote to me on 27.4 to advise they had located the "successful deposit" at that stage I'd already closed my account and asked for this to be refunded.</p>
<p>They asked me provide documents for verification to process the refund. I provided all ID docs, screenshots and bank.statement showing the fully processed transaction. They keep stalling the process and keep asking me for a copy of the transaction which I have given them time and time again! The most recent was the credit card statement showing the fully processed transaction.</p>
