    <h1>Casino Extream Vernon Downs Casino Horseshu Hotel Casino Choctaw Casino Pocola Palace Station Hotel</h1>

<p>Gamomat’s reputation for delivering some of the best slot game experiences for the iGaming industry precedes it. Now, the company is tapping new talent to ensure that its games can reach even more people. This is where Andreas Kaufmann comes in his new role as Managing Director for Gamoat Distribution GmbH.</p>
<p>The entire team at Gamomat is thankful to have Kaufmann as he is an experienced casino and industry specialist who has focused on cultivating a deep and relevant understanding of the online casino experience over the years. His background as both an entrepreneur and iGaming heavyweight puts him in an ideal position to give Gamomat that additional nudge along the way the company needs to thrive and succeed.</p>
<p>Kaufmann was pleased with his appointment, and he thanked the opportunity to help boost the reach of the company’s titles and explore new gaming landscapes. His exact words were:</p>
<p>"It’s a proud moment to join GAMOMAT Distribution’s outstanding team to help accelerate the company’s growth in key regulated markets. My responsibility will be expanding the reach of GAMOMAT’s exceptional games portfolio across the gaming landscape."</p>
<p>Kaufmann will seek to further extend the company’s active partnerships, allowing it to build fresh opportunities. He was welcomed by Gamomat Development GmbH’s Founder Dietmar Hermjohannes who said that Kaufmann’s appointment was very important to the company. Through him, the business will continue to build and deliver strong impressive growth, the executive explained.</p>
<p>Kaufmann’s significant supplier-side experience will be a contributing factor to the future success of the company. Gamomat has been busy of late with the company enhancing its portfolio. In September, the company expanded its Fire Respins series by adding the Alexandria Fire game. Before that, Gamomat introduced 50 Flaring Fruits to its portfolio.</p>
<p>Gamomat is a prolific developer which has more than 150 excellent online slots that have been part of the online gaming space for a very long while now. Gamomat continues to maintain an ambitious development schedule. The firm operates out of Berlin, Germany and caters to international and local markets.</p>
