    <h1>Free No Deposit Casino Bonus Iowa Casino Map Jack Casino Cincinnati Casino Korean Drama Casino Onlin</h1>

<p>We have thoroughly investigated the player's complaint regarding the deducted transactions and his VIP rewards. Here is a summary of our findings:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Deducted Transactions: After investigation, we reviewed the transactions of the player towards our casino and noticed that the player has a few failed deposits. None of these failed transactions reached our casino's account. Therefore the customer support and the payments team requested proof of payment in order to thoroughly and in-depth investigate the state of his failed deposits and the transactions he was referring to specifically.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Proof of Payment: The player's provided documents did not accurately reflect the transactions made at the casino; instead, they pertained to a different legal entity. Nonetheless, we promptly informed the player about the discrepancy and kindly requested the submission of the correct documents. Despite our notification, the player did not furnish the required documents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Discrepancy in Amounts: The screenshots provided by the player did not reflect amounts close to his failed deposits, even after considering exchange rates. The amounts in USD shown in the screenshots were significantly different from his claims, a difference of at least 3290 HUF.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Discrepancy in Time: Calculating the time in the country of residence of the player and UTC timing, a difference of at least 89 minutes between the time shown in his proof of payment and the times of the failed deposits on the casino.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>VIP Rewards: The player claimed not to have received his VIP rewards. Our records show that he was compensated once for his VIP rewards, with a 40 EUR cash bonus and 30 Free Spins. Additionally, during a previous chat with our support team, the player confirmed that he had received the VIP rewards as redeemable bonuses via email.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We take player concerns seriously and ensure transparency and fairness in all our dealings. We regret any inconvenience this may have caused and are committed to providing the best gaming experience to all our valued players.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
