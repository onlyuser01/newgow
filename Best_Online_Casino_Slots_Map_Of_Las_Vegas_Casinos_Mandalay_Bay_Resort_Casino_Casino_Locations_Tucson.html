    <h1>Best Online Casino Slots Map Of Las Vegas Casinos Mandalay Bay Resort Casino Casino Locations Tucson</h1>

<p>Oddschecker, a leading odds comparison site and a beloved betting destination, has reinforced its leadership team with a temporary addition. The one joining the company is the experienced Judith Turner who will serve as interim chief people officer.</p>
<p>Turner Brings in 10 Years of Experience</p>
<p>Turner boasts years of experience in the gambling and sports betting industry. Her career in gambling began in July 2011 when she joined the Austrian online betting brand bwin. Turner’s tenure at bwin saw her serve the company until 2017. She experienced Entain’s acquisition of bwin in 2016 first-hand and played an important role where she oversaw the employees until the transition.</p>
<p>After that, Turner joined Rank Group. At first, she was placed in an interim role but was eventually promoted to the company’s human resources director for digital – a position she maintained for almost two years.</p>
<p>Prior to joining Oddschecker, Turner served the social betting company Betbull. There, she occupied the position of global people director for almost a year. At the same time, Turner also served as global people director of WynnBET, a premier online sportsbook and casino company.</p>
<p>Turner Is Excited to Join Oddschecker</p>
<p>Turner now has over a decade of experience in the sector and will bring valuable expertise to Oddschecker’s team. As the company’s interim chief people officer, she will have to manage the odds company’s whole human resources division. Turner will join Oddschecker’s Hammersmith-based office and will work to maintain the company’s human resources.</p>
<p>Turner commented on her new position at the company. She shared that she is glad to join Oddschecker Global Media’s team and is looking forward to working for the company.</p>
<p>In October 2021, Oddschecker expanded its team with the addition of a new chief marketing officer. The one who stepped into the position was Rob Painter, another highly-experienced worker with years of experience.</p>
<p>Last Year Oddschecker Changed Ownership</p>
<p>Last year, Oddschecker changed ownership as Flutter, its former ownership company, sold the odds comparison site for $215.2 million. The buyer was the Bruin Capital, a private equity group. This move was carefully planned several months ahead of the deal and came in the wake of Entain’s withdrawal from Flutter Entertainment. Back then, Flutter hired the investment bank Moelis &amp; Company as an advisor. A few months after the sale closed, Oddschecker struck a deal with Entain that allowed the latter to return the flagship Ladbrokes and Coral brands to its website.</p>
