    <h1>Casino Mania Real Money Fort Hall Casino Casino Cake Ideas Soaring Eagle Casino Photos Lodge Casino</h1>

<p>I made a deposit of 25 Euro. Won extremely much it felt like When I decided to make the first withdrawal I had 2000 EUR. When I requested the withdrawal the problems started. I was already verified. But they were supposed to have documents and after their 72 hour verification code, the documents were rejected. New ones were sent in. Approved, and I made another attempt to withdraw money. New documents were then required. Again 72 hour handling. After quite intensive emailing and chatting, the handling time was shortened by one. In the meantime, I continued to play, but stopped when I had 1000Eur in my gaming account. In the end, after pure lies on the chat, and a clear anger from me, I got an email where they denied my withdrawal and referred to lots of paragraphs about money laundering and everything. They took everything back except my 25 Euro, which is still there. But I can't take them out. Tried for fun to start a game. But even though my account is active, they have blocked me from the games.</p>
<p>The money was never really mine, but I don't understand that they can keep their license. This must be a real scam.</p>
