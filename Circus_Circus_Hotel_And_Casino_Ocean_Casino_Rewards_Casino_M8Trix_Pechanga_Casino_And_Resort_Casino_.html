<p>Atmosphere is Great in Columbus Crewâ€™s Locker Room</p>
<p>Columbus Crew is 9-4-6 this season, which accounts for 31 points. This puts the boys from Ohio in the No. 5 position in the Eastern Conference, with a pretty decent chance of moving up in the near future. For that to happen, they just need to continue playing well.</p>
<p>After the games yesterday, the @ColumbusCrew are only 5 points behind second place New England.</p>
<p>Tons of soccer to play, plus a mid-season tourney to tune things even further.</p>

<p>This is the highest-scoring team in the entire MLS, which is averaging 2.0 goals per game. Their scoring average is even higher in the last five MLS rounds (2.4), in which we saw them win four times. In their most recent game, they beat Nashville SC 2-0 in one of their most impressive outings of the season.</p>
<p>Truth be told, Nashville was without its best player in that game, but nevertheless, Columbusâ€™ players played very well that day.</p>
<p>New York Red Bulls Coming Off a Big Win</p>
<p>In the previous round of the 2023 MLS, the New York Red Bulls demolished the leagueâ€™s most valuable team, Atlanta United. The final score was 4-0, which is something thatâ€™s certainly giving them confidence that they can do something similar once again.</p>
<p>The win in question happened in New York, while on the road, these guys arenâ€™t that great. In fact, theyâ€™re 1-4-4 this season, but the good news is that their first away win of the season happened the last time they played away from home. The bad news, however, is that the win happened against Inter Miami, a team that everyone seems capable of beating in 2023.</p>
<p>Columbus Crew vs. New York Red Bulls Prediction</p>
<p>Our prediction is that this is going to be a very exciting game. We should see goals on both ends, with the hosts probably being the ones to score at least one goal more.</p>
<p>Picks: Columbus Crew to win &amp; over 2.5 goals</p>
