<p>The New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement is a division of the Attorney General and was originally established in 1977 to oversee the casino gaming industry. The DGE's primary responsibility is to enforce the laws outlined in the Casino Control Act and the regulations set by the Casino Control Commission (CCC).</p>
<p>Integrity is key</p>
<p>The DGE works closely with the Casino Control Commission to license, regulate and monitor all gambling activity in the state of New Jersey, including all online gambling since it was legalized in February 2013. The division is dedicated to cultivating an industry that is legitimate and crime-free while promoting honesty, integrity and good character among casino operators, owners and employees.</p>
<p>License applicants must meet strict criteria, and the DGE thoroughly investigates each applicant's suitability. Additionally, the division is responsible for monitoring and supervising licensees to ensure compliance with all regulations and best practices regarding Know Your Customer (KYC), Advertising, and Responsible Gaming.</p>
<p>Currently, online gambling licenses can only be obtained by licensed Atlantic City casinos or their internet gaming affiliates, and online sportsbook operators must establish a partnership with a licensed casino or racetrack before offering their services. Authorized gambling websites can also only be accessed by players who are located in New Jersey.</p>
<p>How to check a license</p>
<p>Despite the measures taken by the division to ensure that the industry is free of crime, it is always advisable to check the license status of an operator and verify that they are offering their services legally. A list of current Gaming Permit Holders is available on the DGE website, as well as a list of Internet Gaming Authorized Sites, so it is easy to check if a site and its operator are legitimate.</p>
