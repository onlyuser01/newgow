<p>Oleksandr Usyk vs. Daniel Dubois is a boxing heavyweight fight for the WBA (Super), IBF and WBO titles that are currently in possession of Usyk</p>
<p>Legendary boxing promoter Frank Warren and former world champ Carl Frampton are among those who believe Dubois will stop Usyk on Saturday. If the British pugilist pulls it off, it’s going to be one of the biggest upsets in the history of the sport as the Ukrainian champ is a huge -1450 favorite to win.</p>

<p>Unbeaten Ukrainian Ready for Another Win</p>
<p>Oleksandr Usyk is 20-0 with 13 wins by KO/TKO. He’s arguably the most technical heavyweight boxer on the planet, who moves fast and has a real tank engine in him. The Ukrainian tends to fight once a year so that he has plenty of time to prepare for each bout.</p>
<p>Last year, he fought Anthony Joshua in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, and won by a split decision. A year earlier, he defeated AJ by unanimous decision in London. In both of those fights, he simply outsmarted his opponent, landing more strikes overall.</p>

<p>Before that, he beat another British boxer Derek Chisora in London, and before that, he beat American Chazz Witherspoon in Chicago. He also beat Englishman Tony Bellew in Manchester, Russian Murat Gassiev in Moscow, Latvian Mairis Briedis in Riga, and German Marco Huck in Berlin.</p>
<p>In fact, the last time he fought in front of his crowd was in 2015 when he fought in Kyiv. It wouldn’t be possible to fight in Ukraine due to Russia’s ongoing aggression, but he’s going to fight in front of a partisan crowd on Saturday. The bout is taking place in Warshaw where he’s insanely popular, with both Poles and Ukrainian refugees rooting for the champ.</p>
<p>Can Daniel Dubois Pull Off an Upset?</p>
<p>Daniel Dubois is 11 years younger than Usyk, two inches taller, and is arguably more powerful than the champ. The proof of this is that he’s got a 95% knockout-to-win percentage. However, he just hasn’t locked horns with such a great boxer as Usyk.</p>
<p>Dubois is 19-1, with his most notable wins being over Nathan Gorman, Trevor Bryan, and Kevin Lerena. However, none of these guys are anywhere near Usyk in terms of striking and the ability to dodge opponents’ strikes.</p>
<p>The only loss in his career happened against Joe Joyce who KO-ed Dubois in 2020. Dubois got close to being KO-ed a few more times after that bout, most notably, against Lerena who knocked him down three times.</p>
<p>Oleksandr Usyk vs. Daniel Dubois Prediction</p>
<p>Oleksandr Usyk is fighting Daniel Dubois only because he has to. Dubois is a mandatory challenger whom Usyk wouldn’t have to fight if Tyson Fury didn’t pull out of negotiations. Knowing this, it’s clear that Usyk is way, way better than Dubois. Sure, the Briton does have the nuclear option in his skills, but so do many of Usyk’s previous opponents, all of whom he managed to beat.</p>
<p>Pick: Oleksandr Usyk to win by decision</p>
