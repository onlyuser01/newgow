    <h1>Casino Hotel News Bay Mills Resort Casino Brimley Mi Casinos Near Dallas Tx Casino The Film Coconut</h1>

<p>Both companies have much to gain from establishing a stronger commercial presence in the region, and bet365 and XLMedia are happy to expand on their current partnership and include this new hybrid revenue agreement. This partnership expansion comes at a time when more than $220 billion worth of sports wagers have been made in the regulated sports gambling market in the United States over the past five years.</p>
<p>Bet365 and XLMedia Focus on Responsible Gambling</p>
<p>The agreement will focus on a number of performance markers, including customer acquisition and long-term retention. Both companies have made a clear commitment to the North American market and their further expansion in it, with responsible gambling being one of the main tenets of any customer acquisition or conversion.</p>
<p>Education and engagement are also a significant part of the collaborative content the two companies are outlining together, with the partners interested to ensure that any adults who access gambling products as a result of their alliance would do so in a safe and responsible manner.</p>
<p>XLMedia President North America Kevin Duffey welcomed the opportunity to build upon the two companies’ success in the region and said:</p>
<p>We are thrilled to sign a deal with bet365 that moves our business towards a strategic direction and extends our relationship with one of the most prominent Sports Betting operators. This hybrid agreement marks the start of XLMedia building a new, sustainable revenue stream in North America. XLMedia President North America Kevin Duffey</p>
<p>XLMedia Is a Proven Partner in Activating and Retaining Customers</p>
<p>Bet365 has similarly welcomed the opportunity to extend its commercial partnership with XLMedia. The company, a spokesperson said, has proven its ability to activate audiences in key markets and drive important results for the operator.</p>
<p>“From sign-up to first bet and beyond, our commitment to providing customers with the best user experience will only be enhanced through this relationship,” the spokesperson noted. XLMedia grabbed headlines last year when the company announced a deal with Newsweek, a popular media magazine read by more than 50 million people in the United States daily.</p>
<p>At the time, XLMedia and its sports betting publishing arm, Sports Betting Dime, agreed to push sports betting coverage with Newsweek and its audiences.</p>
