<p>Entain has formed a new strategic, innovative alliance with Verizon Media to leverage ground-breaking technology across multiple markets.</p>
<p>Verizon Media and Entain Look to Leverage Innovation Globally</p>
<p>Entain is stepping up its efforts to bring world-class entertainment products with the help of Verizon Media, as part of a new deal which will see the companies collaborate on a virtual reality (VR) experience for live sports, and beyond.</p>
<p>Verizon Media, which is a leading media and technology company, is partnering up with the entertainment giant which owns some of the most iconic gaming and betting brands, among which, Ladbrokes, bwin, partypoker, and BetMGM to deliver next-generation engagement and entertainment tools.</p>
<p>This comes at a time when a YouGov research has revealed that technology can shape consumer behaviors in gaming and specifically in the United States and Australia, and that is something Entain wants to deliver on.</p>
<p>From virtual reality solutions to 5G, growth in gaming and esports is quite evident and Entain now wants to be part of the success stories of the future.</p>
<p>Moving forward, Verizon Media and Entain will work closely to establish a proof of concept virtual reality experience with interactive layers of sports data and gaming solutions, the company said in a press release.</p>
<p>Entain will empower consumers and grant them direct access to sports events, compare data, and socialize with fellow sports and gaming fans.</p>
<p>At the same time, the company will continue to leverage its technological superiority and tap into augmented reality, VR, and 5G solutions to create more immersive content that leads to further satisfactory engagement with sports betting and gambling products.</p>
<p>Predicting the Future and Staying Competitive</p>
<p>Commenting on this development, Entain CEO Shay Segev said that the company’s mark is on the future and to win that future, Entain must move quickly and understand where consumers are going in five or ten years and then shift business in that direction.</p>
<p>Segev stepped at the helm of Entain recently, following the company’s rebranding from GVC Holdings, and has set high objectives for the company.</p>
<p>“We envisage consumers meeting at a game with friends, who could in fact be elsewhere, using virtual reality headsets to watch, interact and share the experience together and, potentially, complete between themselves at half time or feel like they’re on the pitch with the players,” Segev said commenting on the latest opportunity with Verizon Media.</p>
<p>At the same time, Verizon Media CEO Guru Gowrappan has expressed confidence that the collaboration between the two companies would lead to new opportunities across sports betting, content, and entertainment.</p>
<p>Gowrappan is betting big on the company’s first 5G-enabled production studios in Los Angeles and London, expecting the company’s expertise to create an enhanced consumer experience across the board and particularly for consumers who engage with sports betting and gaming products.</p>
<p>Verizon has already collaborated with Entain through BetMGM, a joint venture it operates with MGM Resorts, and the companies continue to work closely to enhance the user experience.</p>
<p>Based on the YouGov study Entain intends to use as a reference for the future, men aged 25 to 39 are the most open to such innovative tech and gaming experiences and this is precisely where Entain is going to focus, along with rapid global expansion, withdrawal from unregulated markets, breaking-ground into new ones and expanding its business several-fold.</p>
