<p>Miami Dolphins are Incredible Offensively in 2023</p>
<p>The Dolphins are 5-1 mainly thanks to their incredible offensive team. These guys are averaging 37.16 points per game on average. Sure, it’s mostly thanks to the fact that they obliterated the Denver Broncos in the third week when we saw them score 70 points.</p>
<p>That, however, wasn’t the only time they blew out the opposition this season. In their most recent game, for example, they destroyed the Carolina Panthers 42-21. Before that, they beat the New York Giants 31-16.</p>
<p>What’s interesting is that all the aforementioned games took place in Miami. On the road, the Dolphins haven’t been as impressive in 2023. They’re 2-1 away from home this season with a negative score differential. In their most recent game on the road, they lost 48-20 to the Buffalo Bills.</p>
<p>The Eagles Ready to Get Back to Their Winning Ways</p>
<p>After winning the first five games of the 2023 NFL season, the Philadelphia Eagles suffered their first defeat last weekend. It happened on the road against the New York Jets. The final score was 20-14 for the home team, even though Philly had a lead until the 14th minute of the final quarter.</p>
<p>The Eagles’ offense is to blame for that loss. They made four fumbles that day, with quarterback Jalen Hurts throwing one interception. Two of Philly’s receivers fumbled the ball, as well as one of their tight ends. To make things even worse, Philadelphia’s running game wasn’t impressive either.</p>

<p>This was their worst offensive performance of 2023, but they weren’t great in the game before that either. Against the Los Angeles Rams, they won 23-14. Actually, they scored over 30 points in only two games of the 2023 NFL.</p>
<p>Can they improve their scoring yield in Week 7? Well, they did score over 30 in the last two Dolphins vs. Eagles duels.</p>
<p>Miami Dolphins vs. Philadelphia Eagles Prediction</p>
<p>The Eagles need to up their offensive game ASAP, which shouldn’t be that hard against the Dolphins. What’s going to be hard is to keep Miami’s offense to a low number of points. QB Tua Tagovailoa &amp; Co. have been fantastic on the offense, so it’s only logical to assume they’re going to score over 30 points in Week 7.</p>
<p>Picks: Miami Dolphins to win and over 51.5 points</p>
