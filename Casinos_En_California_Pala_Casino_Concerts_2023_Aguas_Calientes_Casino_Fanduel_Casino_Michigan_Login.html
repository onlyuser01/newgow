<p>Kero Gaming has announced that it reached yet another milestone this week following the closing of an oversubscribed $2m Seed 2 funding round led by Happyhour.io, an incubator for iGaming innovation.</p>
<p>The news was shared via email press release with Kero Gaming Founder and CEO Tomash Devenishek welcoming the latest developments and once again outlining his company’s groundbreaking concept for innovating the sportsbook experience.</p>
<p>"Modern-day consumers don’t want to think too much and endlessly browse or calculate odds in massive spreadsheets, Devenishek explained. Rather, Kero Gaming is focusing on a building a new platform focused on micro bets that take place every 15-45 seconds, he said. This allows to achieve better engagement with consumers who are seeking to bet, reminding them of a "TikTok style" experience.</p>
<p>Devenishek praised the funding round and said that the company was well ahead of its fundraising ambitions. Post-money valuation has gone up by 60% in only 10 months, the chief executive added. HappyHour.io CEO Robin Reed was similarly pleased with the news.</p>
<p>Reed said that HappyHour.io was looking forward to working with Devenishek and his team to make the Kero Gaming technology available to casual bettors all over the world. Other investors in the latest round included Yolo Investments represented by Tim Heath who said that funding genuine innovation in the sports betting space has become harder, but thanks to Kero Gaming, there were still tangents well worth exploring.</p>
<p>Acies Investments Co-Founder Edward King was also among the people to praise Kero Gaming, its product offering, and show confidence in the future of the startup. "Kero has the vision and capability to radically transform how fans engage and participate in sports entertainment," King said flatly.</p>
<p>Kero Gaming is building a product that eliminates complexity from the sports betting experience and uses tropes from traditional social media platforms, such as TikTok, hoping to empower consumers to make informed decisions in the matter of seconds or minutes, rather than strategizing too long about markets and odds.</p>
<p>Kero Gaming confirmed that it will remain laser-focused on its free-to-play sports product, but it will also continue to channel funding into its real money product offering which can be launched with gaming operators that are interested in bringing this technology to their audiences. Kero Gaming has Europe, Asia, North America, and Latin America as potential markets for its future growth.</p>
