    <h1>My Choice Casino Com Turningstone Casino Casino In Laughlin Nevada Suncoast Hotel And Casino Slots C</h1>

<p>Okay, here’s my issue:</p>
<p>I previously had an issue withdrawing my money from another casino because I didn’t do my homework. After searching about them, casino.guru came up and I learned about my issue. I called my holdings a loss, and decided to choose another site to go play at from the list you guys provide.</p>
<p>Based on a list you have I kind of randomly selected raging bull slots, I mean my country is not restricted and you noted in the pro’s "bitcoin and neteller withdrawals are faster". I liked the idea of a fast withdraw and they had a pretty fair rating among those in recommended list.</p>
<p>Using my mobile phone I signed up at their site, deposited $250 off my credit card and started gambling. I had used the 350% Bonus + 40.. or 50 free 30 cent spins. There’s no limit to how much you can win on the bonus cash, but there was a 30x wagering requirement. I hit a 2k win about halfway through my money, I started max betting at that point and eventually hit a 5k, then another 5k, 4k, 1k, 2.5k etc. needless to say, I blew passed the wagering requirement in about 8 hours. I was sitting on about 7.5k and thought I would begin the withdraw process. For identity verification I was redirected to Hooyu and needed to upload a selfie, a photo of my ID, and an identity document like a utility bill or insurance document with my name and mailing address. I uploaded the first two but had to wait until I was at home to retrieve the last.</p>
<p>So I continued to gamble. I won another 5k at which point I took a screen shot of the screen showing my</p>
<p>real balance: 11.5k</p>
<p>bonus balance: 0</p>
<p>withdrawable balance: 11.5k</p>
<p>I showed a buddy at which point they told me they will believe it when they see it, then they proceeded to google the casino and linked me to another site giving the place terrible reviews citing many who had issues with withdrawing funds. I took it in stride and hoped that would not be the case for myself.</p>
<p>Another few hours passed, I was up to over $13,000 and I decided to call it a night. When I got up the next morning and tried to log in I simply got an error screen saying "oops, something bad happened" mind you, the original signup redirected me to a third party identity management provider called "inclave", I used my e-mail address and chose a password to access it and when I logged into the sites I selected "inclave login" as opposed to logging in with my raging bull user-id and password, which I never signed up for. Because the error screen was from the inclave login, I decided to try the other login but didn’t know the autogenerated userid, which so eventually found in my spam folder in one of the initial welcome emails. I then tried to use it with the inclave password and it was invalid, I had chosen no other password, but I proceeded to attempt to reset my password using the id found in my mail. After words in confirms that it sent an email for password reset to my email which is the accurate one since it has the same first and last letter of my name@domain. I waited, nothing came, I requested another and still nothing, so I went to bed for that day and woke up the next (12-28-2021) nothing. The login issue persisted. Not only did I not receive an email for password reset but I received no further emails notifying me of anything. I did e-mail customer support since I was not an upgraded player deserving of phone call privileges. Only been about 8 hours, no reply, we will see. My concerns have been growing more and more now, I tried clearing my cookies and using a different browser/cpu/ip same issue every time. Knowing you aren’t allowed to use multiple accounts I asked a friend to signup and let me know if they have any issues, I thought maybe it was happening to everyone due to some server error or something. My friend was able to successfully register and login to their account, at which point I asked if I could use their phone to attempt to login to mine, of course he was happy to do so and the same problem occurred, even after I cleared cookies it happened. So then I returned to my pc, cleared cookies and cache and tried again. I hope I am paranoid and this is a fluke but I am starting to think this may be some underhanded practice unfolding.</p>
<p>FYI, my IP Address reflects my local home (los angeles) ip as well as a ip located in Canada (my work is headquartered in bit California, and Canada.) Therefore I can be seen alternating between the two places, though both are unrestricted by the site.</p>
<p>I feel like I checked all the boxes necessary to ensure a legit withdraw yet my account access is limited and I have been given no reason, I ask that you might assist me in this and/or remove this gambling provider from your recommendation if I do indeed lost out on my big winnings. Thanks.</p>
