    <h1>Diamond Sky Casino Bet Mgm Casino Hotel Casino Las Vegas Wind Creek Casino Casino Stardew Slot Madne</h1>

<p>Hey there.</p>
<p>I read the complaint, and I think the main point is that you played your balance away. In such a case, there isn't much we can do. It also seems like you failed to verify yourself, which is a necessary step for getting the money.</p>
<p>Additionally, the disputed amount was $236 and you stated: "I'm sorry I was wrong on amount it is 236 dollars"</p>
<p>The casino rep explained:</p>
<p>"I had the chance to review the situation and couldn't find any submitted documentation, the simplest way to complete documentation is within the documents module in the cashier of the casino. However I believe the real question here relates to the withdrawal which is mentioned. There has not ever been a requested withdrawal in this account, the only thing I see is the coupon reversal where the non-cashable funds on a chip are removed. In this case the amount was $236 removed leaving the cashable balance on the free chip of $100. This cashable amount was then played to $0, there are currently no requested withdrawals or withdrawable funds within the casino.</p>
<p>Supporting documentation has been forwarded to the casino.guru team for review."</p>
<p>Well, I would not say we didn't care. I'd say we were following the process based on the information given on both sides.</p>
<p>If you are convinced you've found something new that changes the situation, you are more than welcome to ask for the complaint to be reopened. Just follow this link , scroll down, and make the choice, please.</p>
