    <h1>Louisiana Hotels And Casinos Bally S Casino Las Vegas Nevada Ignition Casino Login Presque Isle Down</h1>

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>Ive been having issues with Biamobet for a while now and they have blocked my email for months and I can’t even contact them.</p>
<p>I deposited at first 500$ and withdrew a couple of dollars and then I started to use the site everyday because I liked it. I was at 4546,82$ and tried to withdrew only 1500$ because I had to pay my rent, I’ve been travelling a lot lately and the owner wanted the money before my stay so I needed cash asap..</p>
<p>they cancelled my withdraw and removed 4106$ from my account and saying that i could only withdraw 440$?! The only explanation I got was I have a lot of Ip adresses.. I have 1 iPad, 1 iPhone, 2 computer and I change cities quite often. I don’t understand what I did wrong but for some reason they let me withdraw 440$ and blocked my account and my emails, and I would to know what I did wrong if I did something wrong.. or if you can help me get paid because this is a lot of money..</p>
<p>I do not know what to do to get help but I would appreciate some help or communication from their side please. I will attach pictures if needed.</p>
<p>I understand the different IP adresse situation because I move a lot and have a lot of devices( I don’t even know if this impacts IP adresses ) but if they are saying that my ip has been used with other accounts is it possible to ask if we used to them bets? I don’t know anybody using this site and I find it easy to say that my ip was connected to other accounts, since I travel often and I think asking for proof would be fair since I don’t know what is happening with my money? Please help me.</p>
