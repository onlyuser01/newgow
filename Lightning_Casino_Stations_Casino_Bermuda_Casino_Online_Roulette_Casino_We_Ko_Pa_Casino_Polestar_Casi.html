    <h1>Lightning Casino Stations Casino Bermuda Casino Online Roulette Casino We Ko Pa Casino Polestar Casi</h1>

<p>From July 1, I had self-excluded from all casinos under the Rabidi group.</p>
<p>Yet, I was still allowed to open a gambling account at this casino. After losing a few thousand euros, I reached the gold VIP level and was entitled to a 5% cashback.</p>
<p>This cashback was denied to me by the administration without reason.</p>
<p>I then brought to the casino's attention that I had self-excluded and therefore should be entitled to a refund of my deposits.</p>
<p>No response was received from the casino.</p>
<p>Four days later, I deposit and lose an additional €2600.</p>
<p>I continue to reiterate that I had self-excluded but they still do not respond.</p>
<p>On the same day, I deposit another €400 and manage to win approximately €12800 over three days.</p>
<p>I am unable to withdraw all of it due to their ridiculous withdrawal limits (one withdrawal per day, maximum €800!).</p>
<p>In total, I managed to withdraw €2800.</p>
<p>Yesterday, despite the casino knowing I had self-excluded, I continued to play and quickly depleted my account from a balance of approximately €10000.</p>
<p>I also believe that the casino alerted the game provider Evolution to make me lose everything, knowing that I primarily played live roulette, because I have never seen such a losing streak.</p>
<p>The fact remains that despite sending two emails on different days, explicitly stating my self-exclusion, the casino did nothing to block my account and protect my earnings.</p>
<p>Only this morning was my account blocked, after, of course, losing everything.</p>
<p>At this point, I should be entitled to compensation for the loss of earnings occurred following my self-exclusion emails as at that time the casino was aware they should have immediately blocked my gambling account, according to their T&amp;C.</p>
<p>I'd appreciate your help and thank you in advance.</p>
