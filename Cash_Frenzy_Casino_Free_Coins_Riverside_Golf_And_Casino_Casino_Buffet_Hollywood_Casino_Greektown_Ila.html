<p>BetMGM Launches Famed Buffalo Slots on New Jersey Internet Casino</p>

<p>Buffalo slots are available for play by BetMGM customers in New Jersey. The operator noted it plans to soon add those games to its iGaming platforms in Michigan and Pennsylvania. Bet MGM is one of the largest online casino firms in the US by market share.</p>
<p>For over a decade at brick-and-mortar casinos, the Buffalo slot machine by Aristocrat has gained immense popularity,” according to a statement. “Anaxi, Aristocrat’s online Real Money Gaming business, has reimagined the fan favorite for online play. Buffalo is a 20-line 5×4 slot game where players aim to win by filling the screen with Buffalo symbols.”</p>
<p>BetMGM is a 50/50 joint venture of MGM Resorts International and Entain Plc.</p>
<p>Why BetMGM Buffalo Debut Matters</p>
<p>Under a previously announced agreement, Aristocrat’s newly formed Anaxi business will deliver gaming content to BetMGM. Formed last year as part of Aristocrat’s move to bolster its iGaming footprint, Anaxi is the parent company’s real money, online gaming entity.</p>
<p>The launch of Buffalo in New Jersey, and later Michigan and Pennsylvania, is relevant because iGaming is a content-centric industry. Regarding slots, which are high-margin offerings in the internet gaming space, bettors want access to the titles they’ve come to love through visits to land-based casinos. Buffalo checks that box for BetMGM.</p>
<p>Indeed, Buffalo is an undisputed hit at many brick-and-mortar casinos across the US. The series is popular with bettors because typical machines feature an almost 95% return to player, low variance and multiple avenues for winning beyond hitting the largest jackpots.</p>
<p>While US casinos are in the midst of an ongoing slot upgrade cycle — a positive for companies like Aristocrat — the iGaming boom is proving there’s carryover value for makers of popular slots titles. Put simply, plenty of slots fans enjoy playing these games online, and therefore, some internet casino operators offer hundreds of titles.</p>
<p>iGaming Outlook Remains Attractive</p>
<p>Currently, just six states — Connecticut, Delaware, Michigan, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia — permit online casinos. However, that figure is forecast to grow in the years ahead as states explore new revenue-generating opportunities.</p>
<p>One factor that’s impossible for gaming companies and states to ignore is that iGaming generates more revenue (and profits) than sports wagering. Online casinos attract customers because they can indulge from home while tapping the potential for lucrative jackpots.</p>
<p>“BetMGM’s award-winning online casino is home to over 1,500 games and one of the largest state-by-state exclusive jackpot networks. During the first half of 2023, the company awarded nearly $75 million in jackpots and is on pace to shatter the $100 million jackpot milestone set in 2022,” added the operator.</p>
