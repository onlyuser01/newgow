<p>Travel to the Inner Depths of Mystical China</p>
<p>The 5×4 slot with 25 pay lines invites players to start exploring the Far East and reach China and its mystical Golden Dragons with supernatural powers.</p>
<p>3 Oaks Gaming’s managing director Sebastian Damian spoke about the new game that incorporates their already successful Hold &amp; Win game mechanic used to attract “massive multipliers” that can generate huge wins. Damian also explained that the provider has made it a habit to add fresh and innovative elements to each new slot release, adding that Dragon Wealth makes no exception.</p>
<p>The slot comes with quality high-definition graphics, excellent animations, and a mesmerizing Asian-themed soundtrack. Together, all these elements offer an original oriental atmosphere that creates the illusion of good fortune and wealth.</p>
<p>The game is also filled with a plethora of excellent features ranging from the golden dragons that also represent the wilds in the game and the scatters that can trigger free spins.</p>
<p>Without a doubt, the new slot that joins other popular 3 Oaks Gaming titles like Green Chilli, Sticky Piggy, and Sunlight Princess has everything it needs to bring lucrative payouts to players.</p>
<p>5,000x Grand Jackpot and Respins Bonus with Multipliers</p>
<p>When landing a minimum of six bonus symbols represented by the glowing pearls, the Hold &amp; Win game comes into play. During the game, only bonus symbols will be displayed on the grid.</p>
<p>Each of these symbols landing on the grid will either introduce a cash value or a mini (20x), minor (50x), or major (100x) jackpot prize. The 5,000x grand jackpot is triggered when all 20 reel spots are filled with these symbols.</p>
<p>Players receive three respins. Every time a new bonus symbol is locked in place, the meter will be seen resetting to three additional respins.</p>
<p>The respins bonus introduces a flaming blue multiplier symbol. When these icons are seen showing on the reels, their values are added to the multiplier meter above their corresponding reels.</p>
<p>At the end of the round, all symbols shown below a multiplier are increased by the respective value, for a potentially huge win.</p>
<p>3 Oaks Gaming appointed Victoria Vashukevich as its new head of account management at the start of March.</p>
