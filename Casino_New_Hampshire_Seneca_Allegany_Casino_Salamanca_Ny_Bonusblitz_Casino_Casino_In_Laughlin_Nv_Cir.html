<p>PressEnter Group has expanded its C-suite with the addition of Philip Bell, a well-seasoned industry veteran, who is now stepping in as the company’s new Chief Commercial Officer. Bell is joining the Group behind prominent iGaming brands such as XLBet, JustSpin, NitroCasino, 21.com, and not least, UltraCasino, the newly-appointed executive shared on his LinkedIn profile.</p>
<p>In his new position, he will be responsible for both creating and executing strategies that strive to achieve better commercial and business development. Bell will focus on both short and long-term targets, as he pursues a robust performance, and he will be instrumental in Group CEO Lahcene Merzoug’s growth-driven strategy.</p>
<p>PressEnter has been laser-focused on optimizing operations across the board under Merzoug’s stewardship and is backed by other experienced industry veterans. Bell has indeed held various stints with companies such as Labdrokes, Esports Entertainment Group, and not least, Argyll Entertainment.</p>
<p>Bell has welcomed the opportunity to now be a part of one of the most illustrious gambling groups in the industry and help steer it towards success, fully adopting its forward-thinking model and ethos.</p>
<p>"I look forward to helping drive innovation, and faster growth, and ensure that PressEnter Group continues to be a trailblazer in the industry," Bell noted, also hailing the talented and capable individuals that work as part of PressEnter.</p>
<p>Merzoug was similarly pleased with the appointment of the new CCO, arguing that Bell brought in a wealth of experience and knew what it takes to drive business growth. "We have an incredibly strong senior management team in place, and Philip is a great addition to this," Merzoug added.</p>
<p>Bell will have the opportunity to shine in his new position following similar commercial stints in other big companies from the sector. PressEnter Group has continued in the meantime to launch new forays into the B2C space, with the company most recently introducing its CasinoFest brand.</p>
