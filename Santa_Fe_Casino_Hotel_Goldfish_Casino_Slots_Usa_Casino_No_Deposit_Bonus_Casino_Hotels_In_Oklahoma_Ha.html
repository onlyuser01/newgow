<p>The arrest happened after a woman attempted to steal $3,000 from a Las Vegas undercover vice officer posing as a customer, according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal.</p>
<p>Brent Keith Rodgers was booked into the Clark County Detention Center on Sunday. He is due in court Dec. 30 on charges of facilitating sex trafficking of a victim over 18, conspiracy to commit theft and more, according to the newspaper.</p>
<p>Rodgers was arrested after a woman agreed late Saturday to have sex for $500 with the undercover officer pretending to be a customer, the newspaper reported.</p>
<p>The woman went to the officer’s hotel room on the Strip. The officer placed cash in a dresser drawer and left the room momentarily. Surveillance video shows the woman taking the money while on a phone call. After she left the room, police waiting outside arrested her. The money was recovered from her purse, the Review-Journal reported.</p>
<p>Police located Rodgers in the hotel by examining the woman’s phone. The suspect said the woman was a model who had gone to the room to pose for photos. He denied being her pimp, according to the newspaper.</p>
<p>The woman also was arrested. Her name was redacted in the police report.</p>
<p>Sex Crimes</p>
<p>The incident Sunday was the latest in recent sex crime arrests in the Las Vegas area.</p>
<p>Christopher Mark Damron, 46, of Oxnard, California, was booked into jail last week, facing charges of soliciting a child for prostitution and luring a child for sexual acts, according to news reports.</p>
<p>The man replied to an online prostitution ad, saying he was grumpy because he had lost money, so was “trying to get happy,” according to the Review-Journal. He agreed to pay $200 for sex, police said.</p>
<p>Damron’s reply to the ad went to a Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department officer posing as a 15-year-old girl, the newspaper reported.</p>
<p>Damron went the next day to an agreed-upon location, where he was arrested. He told officers he was not planning on having sex with the 15-year-old girl. He said he only wanted to take her ice skating at a rink at the Cosmopolitan Las Vegas on the Strip, according to the Review-Journal.</p>
<p>Damron’s arrest was one of 11 in a law enforcement crackdown on internet crimes against children in the area. Police also arrested an elementary school assistant principal.</p>
<p>Off-Strip Arrest</p>
<p>In November, police arrested 49-year-old Trevor Carter at an off-Strip hotel-casino on suspicion of sex-trafficking a juvenile under the age of 18, according to news reports.</p>
<p>The man told the juvenile female to charge $500 for each sexual encounter. She also was told to look for men wearing “cowboy buckles and boots” as potential good customers, according to published accounts.</p>
<p>The juvenile was told to make her customers drink a shot of liquor to be sure the person was not an undercover officer, police said.</p>
