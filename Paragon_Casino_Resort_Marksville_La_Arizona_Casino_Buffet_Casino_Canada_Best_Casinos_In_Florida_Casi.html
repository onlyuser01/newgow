<p>Gaming and betting brand Casumo has received an official go-ahead from the Spanish gaming authority, DGOJ, to launch its gambling products in the country on April 1, 2021.</p>
<p>Casumo Prepares to Break Ground in Spain</p>
<p>Leading gaming group and casino operator Casumo has received official approval from the Spanish gambling regulator, Dirección General de Ordenación del Juego (DGOJ), to launch in the country this April.</p>
<p>The company’s flagship Casumo brand will bring its full iGaming portfolio under a .es domain name, offering mobile-first solutions as Spain’s iGaming results continue to soar amid stronger pushback from authorities to clamp down on public advertisement and gambling sponsorships. None of this has dissuaded Casumo from pursuing growth in one of the most promising markets in Europe.</p>
<p>Despite the country posting 50% weaker gambling revenue in 2020, iGaming and sports betting have been holding steady in the country.</p>
<p>The launch is set for Thursday, April 1, with Casumo featuring numerous social gaming opportunities, tournaments, slot races, and other bonafide aspects of the casino gaming experience. Casumo will rely on what it calls “simplicity in design and excellence in execution” to provide consumers on the Spanish market with the quality iGaming products they deserve.</p>
<p>The website will provide players with access to both iGaming and sports wagering products. Players will get a chance to benefit from a state-of-the-art Bet Builder and create customized wagers that better reflect their knowledge of each individual competition.</p>
<p>Focusing on Regulated Markets</p>
<p>Casumo’s European market expansion strategy seems to focus on regulated markets, despite regulatory headwinds in the country. Owning several licenses in arguably some of the most challenging jurisdictions already, Casumo continues to push forward.</p>
<p>The company already has a permit to run gambling products in Denmark, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the company similarly holds a license from the Malta Gaming Authority (MGA). Speaking on the occasion of this announcement, Casumo CEO Shelly Suter-Hadad argued that the group was excited to be adding the brand to the Spanish gaming landscape.</p>
<p>“Our innovative product, unique marketing approach, and player-first operations and support will deliver a fresh experience for players, which we expect to have a strong business impact over the long-term, as the online casino vertical continues to grow in the market,” Suter-Hadad added.</p>
<p>Casumo has stayed on the radar with a number of high-profile deals over the years. In December, the company teamed up with Pragmatic Play to expand the reach of its suppliers and net portfolio products.</p>
