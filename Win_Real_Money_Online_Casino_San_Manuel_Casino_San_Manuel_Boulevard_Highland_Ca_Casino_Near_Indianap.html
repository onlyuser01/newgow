<p>The changes to the two venues' policies enable table game players to use vapes or smoke cigarettes and cigars</p>
<p>Smoking in casinos across the United States has been a controversial topic for decades. On one side, non-smokers’ rights associations have long supported a smoking ban that would protect the health of non-smokers along with non-smoking employees of different casinos. On the other hand, casinos have long feared a smoking ban might result in a decrease in revenues.</p>
<p>Now, a recent report reveals that two casinos in Las Vegas have implemented changes to their smoking policies. Citing a memo released on Wednesday, the Las Vegas Review-Journal revealed that the Palazzo and The Venetian in Sin City implemented changes to their policies, allowing table game players to smoke. While the two venues allowed smoking for table game players, visitors can also request a non-smoking table, allowing them to enjoy a smoke-free experience.</p>
<p>The recently released memo explains that the new policies are effective as of Monday, November 6, 2023. The change effectively enables players of table games to smoke cigarettes, vapes and cigars on the casino floors at the Palazzo and The Venetian. The two venues explained that despite the change, the visibility or use of marijuana or marijuana products remains prohibited.</p>
<p>“Beginning Monday, Nov. 6, the company will reinstate the smoking policy on the casino floor which will permit the smoking of cigarettes, cigars and vapes at all table games on the casino floors at The Venetian and the Palazzo. As a reminder, the use or visibility of marijuana products continues to be strictly prohibited,“ reads a memo released by the Palazzo and The Venetian</p>
<p>Smoke-Free Tables upon Request</p>
<p>The recently implemented changes to the smoking policies at The Venetian and the Palazzo designate smoke-free tables upon request from the visitors. Non-smokers at the two venues can request a non-smoking table, allowing them to enjoy a smoke-free experience. Upon entering the casino floor, non-smokers who want a smoke-free table should submit a request to a table games supervisor or a higher-ranking official at The Venetian and the Palazzo.</p>
<p>“The notion of a partial smoking policy in casinos is a failed attempt to address the serious health concerns of casino workers.“ Cynthia Hallett, president and CEO Americans for Nonsmokers’ Rights</p>
<p>Cynthia Hallett, the president and CEO of Americans for Nonsmokers’ Rights, a nonprofit organization that advocates for smoke bans and the protection of non-smokers, criticized the changes in the policies of the two casinos in Sin City. She explained that those policies are insufficient when it comes to the protection of casino employees, as well as visitors who are non-smokers. Finally, Hallett warned that secondhand smoke poses a risk for both casino employees and non-smokers alike.</p>
