<p>The company strengthens its C-suite with the appointment of the former bwin and Entain executive with nearly two decades of experience</p>
<p>The leading international iGaming company that focuses on delivering exceptional gaming experiences, LeoVegas Group, strengthened its C-suite with a recent appointment. The company has announced it hired the services of James Elliot, an experienced online gambling, e-commerce and legal compliance expert. Becoming a part of LeoVegas’ senior-level team, he was appointed to the role of director of legal.</p>
<p>In his new role with the company Elliot is expected to oversee specific compliance and legal processes. Undoubtedly, his skills and a wide range of experience are going to prove invaluable for his new position with LeoVegas.</p>
<p>With the latest hire, the company continues to expand its team of experts. Currently, LeoVegas has more than 1,000 employees across Europe, including at its Malta-based operations hub and headquarters located in Stockholm.</p>
<p>As an innovator in the online gambling sector, LeoVegas remains committed to investing in iGaming companies, including LeoVentures, its investment arm. Back in 2022, LeoVegas was designated as one of the subsidiaries of MGM Resorts International, the global gaming and entertainment giant.</p>
<p>Elliot, who is a former NetEnt and Entain executive, shared his excitement about the latest appointment. “I’m happy to share that I’m starting a new position as Director of Legal at LeoVegas Group,” he revealed in a statement released via LinkedIn.</p>
<p>LeoVegas Will Benefit from the Services of an Experienced Executive</p>
<p>Overall, Elliot brings nearly two decades of experience within the gambling sector. His career within the vertical started back in 2005 when he joined bwin, a global gaming company that is currently a part of Entain, the globally-recognized gaming and entertainment leader. Throughout his tenure at bwin, Elliot held the role of director of legal affairs for nearly 10 years until October 2014.</p>
<p>Starting in November 2014, he joined the provider of premier gaming solutions and content, powering iGaming operators across the globe, NetEnt. At the time, he was appointed to the role of general counsel and managing director for Gibraltar, a position he held for five years and eight months.</p>
<p>More recently, Elliot was a part of Entain where he served as director of global safer gambling policy for nine months until October 2023. Before that, again with Entain, he held the role of customer ombudsman director for two and a half years until January 2023.</p>
<p>While Elliot left Entain in October last year, he currently serves as a board member for Gibraltar International Bank.</p>
