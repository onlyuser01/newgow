<p>Finally, Karapetrov pointed out: "We have amplified this game in Meow Janken, with a huge boost in prizes should a player manage to beat Janken or even tie. At Habanero, we want to keep producing classic content but give it our own unique twist and players around the world will undoubtedly enjoy our latest offering."</p>
<p>Players who tune in to Meow Janken will benefit from a thrilling experience with a goal to beat Janken at Rock-Paper-Scissors. Players who are lucky to beat the character in the game can benefit from multipliers, granting a chance for significant payouts. For wins, a multiplier of x9 is applied, while ties result in an x2 multiplier.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Meow Janken slot comes packed with Wilds that can provide further engaging and rewarding experiences for online players. In case players land a Wild symbol on the center reel, they trigger a special respin feature that has a growing multiplier after each spin. A maximum of three spins are awarded while the respin round continues until there are no more wins to be collected.</p>
