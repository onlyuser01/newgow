<p>The DiamondRS and the Peak65 cabinets were presented by IGT during the annual G2E earlier this week. Each of the machines offers a unique and immersive experience, making them appealing to both slots fans and gambling operators.</p>
<p>IGT Shows off the DiamondRS and the Peak65 Cabinets</p>
<p>International Game Technology (IGT), the global supplier of gaming solutions presented its two new cabinets during the Global Gaming Expo (G2E). During the annual event which was held at The Venetian Expo in Las Vegas, Nevada, IGT debuted its two new cabinets: the DiamondRS and the Peak65 cabinet. The company showcased its products at booth #3659.</p>
<p>The DiamondRS cabinet features a mechanical reel and options for the denomination and multi-game configuration. Players can choose between single-line, five-line or nine-line games and even change the denomination. Moreover, DiamondRS offers players a library of performance-tested games but also new spins on all-time-favorite games such as Double Top Dollar and Fortune Coin Extra. While the new product was presented during the G2E, IGT is expected to release it in 2022.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Peak65 is IGT’s new super-sized cabinet. Besides a 65-inch progressively curved display, the cabinet features a 13.3-inch dynamic player panel that has dual bash buttons. Additionally, Peak65 features advanced graphics, sound as well as ergonomic technology. Along with the vibrant electronic wheel topper, the new cabinet is more than 10 ft tall. The new cabinet features the Wheel of Fortune High Roller and more games. Peak65 also offers the Price Is Right Come On Down, which is a game featuring bonus-round games similar to the popular TV game show.</p>
<p>The Two Cabinets Offer Unique Capabilities</p>
<p>IGT’s vice president of innovation of mechanical reels, Anthony Baerlocher, was recently interviewed by CDC Gaming Reports about the new DiamondRS cabinet. He outlined that the process of getting the five-line and the nine-line to work with a one-line game was difficult and required an innovative method to achieve. Baerlocher added that DiamondRS offers a ton of flexibility for gaming operators. He stressed that the new cabinet can be incredibly appealing to different player types with the help of different game mechanics, reel spins, as well as light and sounds effects.</p>
<p>IGT’s director core product, Roger Pettersson added that despite the size of the new Peak65 cabinet, it is still “manageable enough” to be positioned within different configurations. He stressed that the huge screen offers a unique and immersive experience.</p>
