<p>In a fresh partnership with Neccton, Greentube will launch the company’s Mentor Responsible Gambling (RG) system to bolster security across its own brands.</p>
<p>Greentube Rolls out New Consumer Protection Tool</p>
<p>Novomatic’s interactive division, Greentube, has rolled out Neccton’s Responsible Gambling (RG) solution, Mentor, designed to bolster consumer protection. The first brand to benefit from the solution is Admiral Casino UK, owned and operated by Greentube, with more real-money brands lined up to benefit from the powerful tracking and monitoring solution.</p>
<p>Long-touted as a groundbreaking innovation insofar as consumer protection goes, Greentube can now use Mentor to identify erratic gambling behavior in real-time and interact with players who may be at risk of gambling harm.</p>
<p>Mentor allows brands to track specific metrics about individual consumers, including but not limited to spending habits, in-session deposits, failed deposits, cancelled withdrawals, overall affordability, and more.</p>
<p>Aberrant behavior is immediately reported to operators who decide how to proceed next. Empowering companies with the tools to track such data is important at a time when the online gaming industry is becoming stricter and expecting brands to act quickly in response to suspected gambling threats.</p>
<p>Mentor also connects directly with players sending them text messages notifying them about their behavior, such as overspending and even allows individuals to compare their behavior to others members of the same casino.</p>
<p>Providing Advanced and Holistic Protection for All</p>
<p>Greentube UK B2C Director Richard Poole said that the integration of a specialist responsible gambling system was an important milestone for the company and its brands. Neccton’s Mentor provides advanced layer of protection for all UK players, Poole explained.</p>
<p>More importantly, players are allowed to complete self-assessment and decide on their individual gameplay fits with the larger player base at Admiral, or any specific brand. Poole assured that he and Greentube were looking forward to leveraging the statistical data scoured by Mentor to strengthen their offer and safer gambling tools.</p>
<p>Neccton’s Director, Dr. Michael Auer, has argued the case for introducing more tools that help with customers remaining within the limits of reasonable gameplay. Dr. Auer argued that players who play responsibly tend to be more loyal and have a longer life on the casino.</p>
<p>He said that Neccton was pleased to complete this high-profile integration with Greentube. With every integration that Neccton completes, Dr. Auer explained, helped the company to build on its existing database and provide a “holistic view of games and player behavior to operators.”</p>
<p>Greentube previously continued with its expansion in Spain, securing a deal with Golden Park Games. In September, Greentube followed up on that deal with another landmark partnership in Spain, this time with Casino Madrid.</p>
<p>Greentube ventured into Latin America with software firm Technails at the end of last month and it extended its relationship with 888 in the Italian market in August. The company’s growth, however, has not distracted it from seeking responsible gambling solutions for its consumers.</p>
<p>Both Spain and Italy operate to strict new gambling regulations.</p>
