    <h1>Magic City Casino Oxford Casino Casinos Near Memphis Longhorn Casino Mohegan Sun Casino Wilkes Barre</h1>

<p>Extremely INCORRECT! I DON'T RECOMMEND THEM For more than 2 months I have been forced to submit documents for bank transfer, 100 times they returned my documents because they were not ok. Finally, after 2 months, they tell me that they do not know how to work with bank transfers, but only with Bitcoin site. They want me to register there.Only in the stupid Bitcoin site my documents are not approved. There are also separate fees, which I don't think I should but pay. However, I can't work with bank transfers.This casino is the biggest mistake that exists !!!!!!!</p>
<p>They make fun of people and their money! I still don't get my money! I want to ask the casino: If you can't use bank transfers, why do you offer them as an option.</p>
<p>To summarize the problem briefly, they do not want to transfer my money from 31.12.20.</p>
<p>I ASKED 100 times why I was bothered to go to banks for 3 months because they could not send me the money in the account. They lie that they would get lost along the way. Do they think I'm stupid? Shouldn't the money come from there on foot, so that it gets lost?</p>
<p>I went to the bank in Bulgaria 100 times, I also talked to its director. He said that they make it up, there is no option not to receive my money if they send it to me via Ibana, which I gave them.When I transferred $ 30 to them, also a $ 5 fee, it happened in 10 seconds. Now I can't get my money for 3 months!They force me to create an account on a bitcoin site. There are money transfer fees, also a monthly fee of 2 percent. I don't think that because they can't work with bank transfers, I have to pay extra for my money.</p>
<p>I am extremely disappointed with this casino. They made me doubt all the casinos in their country.</p>
<p>I hope you can help me get my money in my bank account.</p>
<p>Greetings!</p>
