<p>Online sports betting and gaming brand Betway secured today another high-profile sponsorship deal by becoming the official betting partner of the Mercedes Cup.</p>
<p>Official Betting Partner</p>
<p>The Mercedes Cup tennis tournament this year is scheduled to take place at prestige Club Weissenhof in Stuttgart, Germany, from June 8 till June 13 and is regarded as one of the ATP Tour’s key grass tournaments preceding the Grand Slam event in Wimbledon.</p>
<p>“In challenging times like these, we are very happy to have agreed on a sponsoring deal for the MercedesCup with a worldwide successful company like Betway. As a global player, Betway strategically focuses on tennis. This goes to show that the sport of tennis works very well as a communication platform.” Edwin Weindorfer, Tournament Director, MercedesCup</p>
<p>Denis Shapovalov, Stan Wawrinka and Nick Kyrgios are among the high-profile players that will participate in this year’s tournament that was traditionally known as the Stuttgart Open, but was renamed as part of a sponsorship deal with automaker Mercedes-Benz. Historically, the Mercedes Cup was won by prominent names in professional tennis like Rafael Nadal, Dominic Thiem and Roger Federer.</p>
<p>The 3-year deal the Mercedes Cup signed with Betway placed the sports betting operator in the company of other tournament sponsors such as Liqui Moly, Gazi, CG Elementum, Lavazza, Wir machen Druck, Emirates and others.</p>
<p>“We are overjoyed to become the Official Betting Partner of the Mercedes Cup tournament. We continue to showcase our support of Tennis around the world and we look forward to being part of such a historic event.” Anthony Werkman, CEO, Betway</p>
<p>The sponsorship agreement would not have been possible had not the ATP Tour partially lifted its ban on sports betting partnerships, following a revision of its commercial agreements by the Tennis Integrity Unit (TUI), to open the door for ATP250/500 tournaments to team with licensed bookmakers.</p>
<p>The ATP Masters series and the Grand Slam tennis events of the Australian Open, Wimbledon, French Open and the US Open are still prohibited from partnering with sports betting companies.</p>
<p>“The MercedesCup takes centre stage in Betway’s international orientation – not least due to the comprehensive live TV broadcast offering, digital presence &amp; innovation as well as the social media and fan engagement initiatives of the grass court highlight at the TC Weissenhof.” Edwin Weindorfer, Tournament Director, MercedesCup</p>
<p>Former sponsor of the Davis Cup Betway already secured deals with the ATP Tour events in Mutua Madrid, the Estoril Portugal Open and Miami Open to affirm its commitment in support of professional tennis globally.</p>
