    <h1>Casinos En New York Fair Go Casino No Deposit Bonus Turtle Lake Casino Ameristar Casino St Charles M</h1>

<p>Hello Branislav and ggbet,</p>
<p>I would like to emphasize to you once again that I played and by chance came with my real money, but it was a deposit on a bonus, only I then had it separately in the cash register. I only emphasized all of this to draw everyone's attention to the fact that I actually did I'm mainly a bonus player, the mention of the IP address was simply a copy of the bonus conditions and the casino's terms and conditions,</p>
<p>I would like to repeat myself again and really try to remember what happened about 7 months ago, I surf privately from home with VPN, unfortunately it can and has happened to me where possible that I registered with ggbet and after or When registering, I noticed that I still had my VPN on, from forums and at Casinoguru and in most casino terms and conditions you can see that you are only allowed to register with an IP address and you are not allowed to play with a VPN disguise, In this case, as was the case with me, I accidentally registered with an active VPN connection when logging in and noticed the error immediately afterwards or during registration and immediately did everything possible to reveal my real IP address so that it didn't happen Should problems arise, yes it is correct, I provided my real data when registering and carried out my KYC with real data, a confirmation link that I am verified or I did not receive an email from ggbet, this is displayed in the profile automatically or that check is still ongoing or whether you still have to submit documents later, this is a technical aid organization or a program in the profile, unfortunately I can't get into my profile so I can't send you screenshots with what data and whether I'm verified, but as you can see A few days ago I sent you a confirmation email from GGbet where several sums were successfully paid out.</p>
<p>Before each registration, I first check whether the country (DE)-Germany-Germany is allowed and you are allowed to register at the casinos, I also did that at GGbet casino, I always check the country in question to see whether it is allowed at all .</p>
<p>Could 1 minute be the time elapsed from registration to confirmation of your email?</p>
<p>It's possible yes, but according to my emails I didn't receive any verification link from GGbet,</p>
<p>I emphasize once again that it is correct that at some casinos you will receive a confirmation email and you then have to click on this link to continue your registration, but this is not the case with all casinos.</p>
<p>I don't know if that's the case with GGbet, I registered 7 months ago, I haven't found anything in my existing emails, not even under the deleted category in my emails from a verification link, it's possible or not possible there is a link,</p>
<p>Do you have any questions Mr. Branislav or GGbet?</p>
<p>I hope I was able to answer your questions. If I forgot to answer any questions, please ask them again or point them out to me</p>
<p>I wish you a good day to everyone involved</p>
<p>Best regards</p>
<p>(DD) - Jonamiah</p>
