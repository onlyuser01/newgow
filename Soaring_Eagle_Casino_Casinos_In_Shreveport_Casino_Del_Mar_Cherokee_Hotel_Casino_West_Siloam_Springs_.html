    <h1>Soaring Eagle Casino Casinos In Shreveport Casino Del Mar Cherokee Hotel Casino West Siloam Springs</h1>

<p>Online sportsbook operator Betway announced it agreed to partner with Brazilian eSports organization FURIA to continue to expand its presence as a leading eSports betting company.</p>
<p>“We are very proud to announce Betway as our new partner.” André Akkari, Co-CEO, FURIA</p>
<p>Another High-Profile eSports Team in Betway’s Portfolio</p>
<p>The agreement will see international cross collaborations between Betway and FURIA, including content and activations across the sports betting operator’s streaming platform BetwayTV, while the eSports team will gain access to Betway’s partners in the country and around the globe.</p>
<p>“They are a global leader in esports betting who promote safe and responsible gambling. It’s a very exciting time for both brands and we’re looking forward to working with them on some creative content campaigns for our loyal fan bases.” André Akkari, Co-CEO, FURIA</p>
<p>The newly agreed sponsorship deal means Betway will replace FURIA’s previous partner, Ontario-based sports betting operator Rivalry, with which the Brazilian eSports organization initially entered into a partnership deal in January 2020 when the bookmaker company was looking to establish its presence in the Latin American markets.</p>
<p>Speaking on behalf of Betway about the new arrangement, Adam Savinson, head of eSports at the UK bookmaker, said people at Betway were excited to team up with FURIA and continue to grow the business in the Brazilian eSports market by offering dedicated fans in the country the best content and partnerships.</p>
<p>The agreement with FURIA is the latest in a series of deals Betway agreed in the eSports space to affirm its leading role as an eSports betting operator, which now boasts several active eSports partnerships, including with “Made in Brazil” (MIBR), PSG.LGD’s Dota 2, BIG Clan and Ninjas in Pyjamas.</p>
<p>In January 2020, Betway agreed with Brazilian eSports team MIBR to extend their partnership deal with another year and mark the 4th successive year the sportsbook operator will be the title sponsor of the country’s most successful Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) professional team.</p>
<p>In March, Malta-licensed Betway agreed to extend the partnership deal with another eSports squad, the high-performing Dota 2 team of PSG.LGD as the bookmaker also became PSG.LGD’s official betting partner.</p>
<p>Currently, Betway is in the process of merging with the special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) Sports Entertainment Acquisition Corp (SEAC), after Super Group, the parent company behind Betway, agreed to the $4.75 billion merger last month to go live and expand its market offering in the US.</p>
<p>The new business entity will retain the Super Group name and is expected to deliver $450 million of cash when the transaction closes in the second half of 2021, subject to the SEAC shareholders’ approval and other customary closing conditions.</p>
