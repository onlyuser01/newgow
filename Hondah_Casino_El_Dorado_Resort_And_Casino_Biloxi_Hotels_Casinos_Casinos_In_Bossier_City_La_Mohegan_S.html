<p>Daily fantasy sports contest and sports betting leader, DraftKings, unveiled its plans to launch its online sportsbook in Maryland. On Friday, the company revealed it anticipates launching its sportsbook on November 23, 2022. The company expects to receive regulatory approval and undergo a mandatory test period between November 21 and November 23. If all goes as planned, DraftKings' online sportsbook will be available for customers in Maryland just before the NFL action planned for Thanksgiving Day.</p>
<p>As with other states, the company plans to introduce its supreme sports betting services providing sports fans with a plethora of betting options. Such bets include player props, special odds boost selections and same-game parlays, among other options. Once DraftKings secures the relevant regulatory approvals, the company plans to offer eligible customers in Maryland options for betting on top-tier sports leagues such as the NBA, NHL and NFL.</p>
<p>The launch will mark a major step for DraftKings in the state, considering that last year, the company joined forces with the Baltimore Ravens. As a result, the leading operator was designated as the team's Official Sports Betting Sponsor.</p>
<p>Under the collaboration, the company vowed to engage with Ravens fans via exciting activations such as autographed merchandise, VIP events and exclusive game day experiences, among other activations throughout the NFL season.</p>
<p>Cal Ripken, Jr., DraftKings' Special Advisor to the Board of Directors, shared his excitement in a statement released on November 18, 2022. He said: "As sports gaming continues to grow across the nation, it was important to me that if I entered this space I would partner with a company that placed an emphasis on responsible gaming."</p>
<p>Moreover, Ripken added it is exciting to see the company lead the way in responsible gambling in Maryland. Finally, he pointed out: "Now, sports fans in our state will have access to the DraftKings Sportsbook, a safe and regulated betting option and a respected corporate leader."</p>
<p>DraftKings supports responsible gambling via its S.E.R.V.E.S. program, short for Service, Equity, Responsible Gaming, Vitality, Entrepreneurship, and Sports. The innovative program focuses on protecting customers, while at the same time leveraging technologies to improve the training for the company's employees.</p>
<p>Matt Kalish, DraftKings' Co-Founder and President of DraftKings North America, added that the company is thrilled to expand the reach of its app to Maryland just in time for the busy sports season. Last but not least, he said: "Our product delivers fans an exciting sports betting experience, and we would like to thank the Maryland Lottery and Gaming Control Agency, the Sports Wagering Application Review Commission, Governor Hogan and the General Assembly for bringing online sports wagering to Maryland."</p>
