    <h1>Big Casino Casinos South Carolina South Point Casino And Hotel In Las Vegas Casino South Dakota Trop</h1>

<p>G Gaming Ltd, trading as G Games, has been added to Light &amp; Wonder’s OpenGaming platform for a period of four years as part of a new collaboration between the two companies. Light &amp; Wonder has decided to add G Games to its list of innovative content ecosystems responding to the quality products G Games has been able to deliver for the iGaming sector.</p>
<p>Light &amp; Wonder Optimistic about G Games’ Addition to OpenGaming</p>
<p>Thanks to OpenGaming, G Games will have access to a number of operators who need innovative, distinguishable, and player-focused content. G Games offers a number of slot titles, ranging from classic to video, to modern games. The company further develops table games and offers a range of lottery titles.</p>
<p>G Games’ unique signature style makes it a preferred choice among players. The studio focuses on video game-inspired mechanics, cinematic effects, and gameplay features to ensure that its titles cut high in the industry and manage to stand out.</p>
<p>The company focuses on real money game development, and it has been an absolute hit with a number of titles such as Cheeky Fruits, Clover Rainbow, Elite of Evil, and Psycho Candies. The company’s lottery products are popular with members of the World Lottery Association and G Games itself is an increasingly important name in the iGaming industry.</p>
<p>Its addition to the OpenGaming ecosystem is the result of the company’s own merit and platform. Light &amp; Wonder digital partnerships director Steve Mayes welcomed this opportunity and said:</p>
<p>G Games has built a deserved reputation for building games that are highly polished and packed with features, performing strongly on our OpenGaming platform. Light &amp; Wonder digital partnerships director Steve Mayes</p>
<p>This partnership extension, he said, is excellent for Light &amp; Wonder clients who are keen to explore more worthwhile games by proven studios. G Games CCO Helen Walton was similarly positive about the opportunity to strengthen the company’s relationship with OpenGaming and Light &amp; Wonder itself. She added:</p>
<p>The new long-term agreement provides us with a strong footing to continue rolling out a wide range of innovative, engaging content to multiple markets through the world’s biggest gaming brands. G Games CCO Helen Walton</p>
<p>Light &amp; Wonder continues to play an important role in content aggregation, and it does so with surety and commitment. It has been one of the most prolific companies in terms of iGaming content, able to put together powerful content portfolios for customers from all over the world to choose from. G Games fits well into OpenGaming’s commitment to excellence.</p>
