<p>The partnership is raising expectations of the 15th edition of the live poker event in Dublin City</p>
<p>The world’s largest online poker room operator, GGPoker, announced an agreement with the Dublin Poker Festival today to become the title sponsor of the live poker event.</p>

<p>Head of Marketing in the UK and Ireland at GGPoker Angela Martin was delighted to announce the new partnership with the Dublin Poker Festival and give “all GGPoker players the opportunity to win their seats in some of Ireland’s best-loved poker events.”</p>
<p>“With hundreds of thousands in guaranteed prizes to be won and satellites starting from just €1, Dublin will be the place to be in February, and we want as many GGPoker players there as possible,” Martin added.</p>
<p>The Amateur Championship of Poker, a €300 Buy-in tournament with €100,000 ($106,000) guaranteed, will get the action underway with on February 16 at The Bonnington Hotel, setting the tone for ten days of live poker.</p>

<p>The festival will also feature dozens of low-stakes side events, cash games, and the Irish Senior Championship for players aged 50 and over with €25,000 ($26,500) guaranteed, besides the festival’s flagship event, the European Deepstack Poker Championship.</p>
<p>Hailing the “fantastic partnership” with GGPoker, Brian Lannon of Dublin Poker Festival outlined the 10-day event as an excellent opportunity for a wider player base to play live poker, looking forward to “building a close partnership with GGPoker” and continuing to grow the poker festival in the future.</p>
<p>Created in 2012 by merging the Amateur Championship of Poker and the European Deepstack Poker Championship, the poker festival spanning over two weekends added the Irish Senior Poker Championship later on and has been continuously growing throughout the years.</p>
<p>The Dublin Poker Festival is set to return to its original dates in February 2023 after its schedule has been disrupted the year before and is eager to welcome poker players from around the world who are willing to experience what it is like to play poker in the capital of Ireland.</p>
