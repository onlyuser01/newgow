    <h1>Hard Rock Hotel And Casino Atlantic City Pennsylvania Casinos Danville Virginia Casino Brighton Semi</h1>

<p>I have been playing here for a while now and they always make sure that it’s hard for me to make a withdrawal after winning a decent amount even after losing so much money already. I won $2500 jackpot on elvies game. I wanted to withdraw my winnings at that time but I couldn’t due to wagering conditions so I played through and apparently i wasn’t supposed to play golden express on a $10 bet.</p>
<p>Usually, the site won’t let me play a game when bonus is restricted to certain games only but this time I was allowed to play and didn’t even really want to spend any more money as I wanted to withdraw already what I have won but then again, i have no choice but finish wagering.</p>
<p>I bet $370 in total ($10 per bet) and only got $7 in return.</p>
<p>When i went to check my balance it says my bonus balance is $0 and my winnings is $3500 and I was so excited to withdraw the money and so I did. Couple of days later, I’m being told that it’s going to be forfeited. How on earth? I played FAIR AND SQUARE! My anxiety has been through the roof and I’m not getting any solutions.</p>
