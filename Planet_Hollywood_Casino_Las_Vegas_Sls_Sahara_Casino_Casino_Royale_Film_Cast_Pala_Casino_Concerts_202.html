<p>One lucky British player got all seven EuroMillions numbers correctly to win one of the biggest prizes in the National Lottery’s history.</p>
<p>A Lucky Ticket-Holder Will Get $224M</p>
<p>The winner put a claim for the reward this Tuesday, which will earn them a whopping $224 million. The victor guessed all of the numbers correctly. For reference, the winning combination was 3, 25, 27, 28 and 29 with 4 and 9 as Lucky Star numbers.</p>
<p>As of now, the winner preferred to maintain their anonymity. The National Lottery operator said that it will disclose neither the victor’s identity nor where they purchased the winning ticket. However, the lucky player is free to reveal who they are, if they wish.</p>
<p>This is by far the biggest prize a single National Lottery ticket has ever won. For example, the previous record was held by an anonymous player who won $207 million back in October 2019. Additionally, this is not the first person to win a EuroMillions jackpot in 2022. We are not even past the year’s midpoint and there are already two people who have gotten their lives changed thanks to the lottery. The first prize was drawn on February 4 and claimed a few days later by an anonymous ticket holder.</p>
<p>Camelot Will Evaluate the Claim Before Paying Out the Prize</p>
<p>Camelot, the current Nation Lottery operator, will now review the person’s claim and will pass them through a validation process. If everything is indeed clean, the victor will receive their prize from one of Camelot’s winners’ advisers.</p>
<p>Andy Carter, senior winners’ adviser at Camelot, spoke about the historical moment. He praised the victor and said that the operator is excited to receive a claim for the biggest EuroMillions prize yet.</p>
<p>This is absolutely incredible news! Last night saw history made with the biggest ever National Lottery prize won by a single UK ticket-holder, and we’re ecstatic that we’ve now received a claim. Andy Carter, senior winner’s adviser, Camelot</p>
<p>Carter added that Camelot’s mission now is to support the lucky ticket-holder, help them redeem the prize and advise them what to do now that they are rich. Once the winner receives their prize, they can decide to go public and announce their victory to the whole of Britain.</p>
<p>On a separate note, Camelot continues its trial against the UKGC. The British regulator recently selected Allwyn as the next National Lottery operator. This is a choice that doesn’t sit well with Camelot as the latter fears going out of business.</p>
