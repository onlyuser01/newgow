<p>Mourinho’s Boys are Great in Rome</p>
<p>AS Roma won 50% of their points at home. That might not seem too impressive given the fact that many other Italian teams have done even better at home. However, there’s one impressive thing about AS Roma’s performance in the Italian capital – they’re undefeated at Olimpico in Serie A since the start of 2023.</p>
<p>Jose Mourinho’s boys won each of their last four league games, scoring a total of six goals and keeping a clean sheet each time. Actually, these guys have conceded only five goals at home, the fewest of all teams in the league. What’s got to worry them is that the last time they welcomed Juventus at Olimpico, they lost 4-3.</p>
<p>Juventus are Playing Top Soccer in 2023</p>
<p>If it weren’t for the point deduction, Juventus would be sitting in the No. 2 position in Serie A. Unfortunately for them, the league docked 15 points from them, so they’re now in the No. 7 place. Nevertheless, their main goal for the 2022-23 season is to finish in the Top 4, thus booking the ticket to the Champions League.</p>
<p>At the moment, they’re 10 points behind the closest team from the UCL spots (Lazio). The season is still long, so they got plenty of time to get there. Of course, that can only happen if they continue playing well.</p>
<p>They’ve been great so far in 2023, winning their last four games. They kept a clean sheet in three of those, but in their most recent game, we saw them concede two goals. It happened in the Turin Derby in which they defeated their city rivals 4-2. The game saw a brilliant performance of pretty much all Juve players, including Paul Pogba, who made his return to competitive soccer after nearly 11 months.</p>
<p>AS Roma vs Juventus Prediction</p>
<p>Despite all the problems, Juventus remains one of the best teams in Serie A. The boys in black and white are coming to the Italian capital with the intention of winning all three points. Sure, Mourinho’s men will defend with all they got, but we think Juve will find their way to the net.</p>
<p>Pick: Juventus to win &amp; under 2.5 goals</p>
