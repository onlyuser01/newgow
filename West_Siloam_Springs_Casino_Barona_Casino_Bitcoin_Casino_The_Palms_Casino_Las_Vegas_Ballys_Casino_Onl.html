<p>In this conversation with Push Gaming game producer Ihor Lozinskiy, we talk about the company’s latest slot game, Mad Cars. Set in a post-apocalyptic world, the game is a continuation of Push’s overall strategy to build titles that are distinct and original and bring entertainment value to players. Inspired by different cultural nodes, such as the Mad Max franchise and Rock N’ Roll Racing, Mad Cars brings a unique product that will lead to adrenaline-filled gameplay.</p>
<p>Mad Cars’ theme and symbols depict a post-apocalyptic wasteland, a whole new genre for Push Gaming, what was some of the inspiration behind this?</p>
<p>As with most of our games, the theme was led by the game’s primary mechanic, which for Mad Cars is focused on our starting grid of battle vehicles racing to the finish line at the top of the game board, and all the excitement and tension that comes along with this!</p>
<p>This led to us building a post-apocalyptic theme which has proven to be popular across mass media. For Mad Cars the obvious inspiration was, of course, the Mad Max movie series, however, we also drew from some of the creativity seen in Rock N’ Roll Racing a classic Nintendo game, that follows a similar theme.</p>
<p>How does the game stack up against previous Push titles? Is the volatility or pace of play any different?</p>
<p>We have drawn on our ability to innovate and change what players have come to expect from a slot game across all of our portfolio. Our game developers and art team relish the freedom of expression they have whilst creating titles unlike any others on the market. In terms of volatility, Mad Cars is a high volatile game as this has become an expectation of many Push Gaming players around the world with many of our titles being home to enormous max wins in both the base game and free spins round.</p>
<p>In terms of game pace, the title is an incredibly fast-paced game, especially in the Bonus round. The Base game, albeit slower, can be even more exciting with instant prizes awarded for each car reaching the end of the race. Typically, they are not finishing as frequently as in the Bonus Game meaning the prizes can build up higher wins before finishing.</p>
<p>Are there any regions or specific player demographics you think this game will particularly speak to?</p>
<p>The theme itself will appeal to people that typically like this post-apocalyptic setting as it has proven to be incredibly popular across mass media. We also suspect any Mad Max fans or car enthusiasts, in general, will be initially drawn to this title. However, in my opinion, the main focus of the game is entertainment and fun and this is loved universally. The title is filled with numerous features and mechanics that every single player can find something to like in this game.</p>
<p>Can we expect similar new themes from Push for the rest of the year? What’s in the pipeline?</p>
<p>We are always working with new themes and different art styles, Push Gaming is famed for having never created two titles that are similar in their aesthetics or gameplay. I can confirm we are creating what we feel will be some of the biggest releases of the year across the industry. Additionally, we are also working on entering new and existing markets and welcoming new operators and partners in advance of these exciting future game releases.</p>
