If they beat the Panthers on Saturday afternoon, their chance is going to get much better.</p>
<p>Oddsmakers think they’re going to pull it off, but history teaches us to be careful when it comes to Lions at Panthers games. The thing is that the Panthers have won every single duel against the Lions in the 21st century that took place at Bank of America Stadium.</p>

<p>Confidence is Sky High in the Lions Locker Room</p>
<p>After a slow start to the season, the Detroit Lions are now in the race for a playoff spot. Before November, their record was 1-6, but then, they entered a superb run with 6-1. They’re 3-0 since the start of December, beating the Jacksonville Jaguars, Minnesota Vikings, and New York Jets.</p>
<p>Winning these three games is actually a fantastic achievement as all of them have been playing fantastic football in 2022.</p>
<p>The Lions have been amazing in the offense – they score 26.4 PPG (#5 in the NFL). Their defense hasn’t been that great. With 26.0 points conceded per game, they’re the second-worst defense in the league. Still, they seem to be improving – their defensive average over the last three games is 18.0 (9th in the league).</p>
<p>Carolina’s Offense Might Not be Good Enough for Detroit</p>
<p>The Achilles heel of the Detroit Lions is their defense, but they might do well in Week 16. The thing is that the Carolina Panthers just aren’t good in the offense in 2022. They were okay when RB Christian McCaffrey was on the roster, but with him departing for California, their running game doesn’t seem as sharp.</p>
<p>Their offensive game too has been disappointing with QB Sam Darnold putting on mediocre performances at best. Further, the signal-caller just hasn’t been getting enough protection from his teammates, who routinely let him get sacked by the opposition.</p>
<p>All of this has resulted in Carolina’s bleak offensive display throughout the 2022 season. With 19.7 points per game, they have the 24th offense in the NFL.</p>
<p>Detroit Lions vs Carolina Panthers Prediction</p>
<p>Beating the Panthers in Charlotte looks like a mission impossible considering that the Lions haven’t done it since the 1990s. But maybe we’ll see a miracle this weekend. After all, it’s Christmas time.</p>
<p>Picks: Detroit Lions to win and cover the spread; under to hit</p>
