<p>40-Year-Old Big Ben Looking for Another KO Win</p>
<p>Rothwell has won 28 of his fights by knockout/technical knockout. The most recent of those was a win over Dutch 7-feet giant Stefan Struve, which marked the end of Big Ben’s losing streak. Before the KO win, we saw him losing four straight UFC bouts.</p>
<p>Since beating Struve, Rothwell went on to win another two fights, while losing one in-between. The defeat in question happened against Marcin Tybura. The Polish fighter got the win via unanimous decision after three rounds.</p>
<p>It was Rothwell’s seventh loss through this method; the other losses happened by knockout (4) and submission (2). Despite being already 40, Rothwell looks durable enough to take the fight to distance. The guy is famous for a very strong chin, meaning that he should be able to remain on his feet regardless of how many punches his opponent throws on Saturday.</p>
<p>De Lima Determined to Prove His Worth</p>
<p>The Brazilian fighter has been fighting for the UFC since 2014, but he still hasn’t locked horns with such a successful fighter as Rothwell. Does this mean that he has no chance against him? Of course not. De Lima just needs to fight wisely.</p>
<p>The guy is famously a fantastic puncher, as evident from the fact that 13 of his 18 wins happened by knockout. However, de Lima is also famous for his impatience. Rather than taking a tactical approach to the fight, he usually tries to finish it ASAP.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for him, such a strategy proved wrong on several occasions. In fact, all of his four losses in the UFC happened when the opponent tricked him into a grappling battle – de Lima lost each time by submission.</p>
<p>Rothwell vs De Lima Prediction</p>
<p>Bookies see Big Ben as the favorite in the co-main event of UFC Vegas 42. However, we might be in for a surprise in this bout. De Lima might not have as impressive a portfolio as Rothwell, but he definitely has the motivation to do his very best on Sunday.</p>
<p>Pick: Marcos Rogerio de Lima to win by points.</p>
