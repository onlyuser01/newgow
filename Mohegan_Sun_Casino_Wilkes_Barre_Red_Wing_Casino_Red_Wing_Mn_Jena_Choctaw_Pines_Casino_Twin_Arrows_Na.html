<p>Technology supplier SportsIQ and International Game Technology (IGT) have teamed up to bring SportsIQ’s odds and automated trading products to IGT’s Playsports platform.</p>
<p>Sports IQ to Offer Products Across NFL, NBA, MLB, and NHL</p>
<p>Under the multi-year partnership, Sports IQ will offer a wide coverage of pre-game and live products across the NFL, NBA, MLB, and NHL. The operator’s proprietary models and automated technology will provide various odds options to players. Some of them will include in-game proposition bets, such as what the next-at-bat result will be.</p>
<p>Omer Dor, CEO at Sports IQ, described the partnership as ‘transformative’ for Sports IQ and said the company is proud to collaborate with a company at the level of IGT. Dor added that wagering is becoming a bigger part of the sports entertainment experience of the sports betting audience.</p>
<p>“They fundamentally deserve incredible products to engage with. And those products cannot be suspended for prolonged times throughout the game or it takes away from the overall experience of those users. We’re delighted to partner with IGT, who shares in our vision of delivering the highest level of excellence to operators.” Omer Dor, CEO at Sports IQ</p>
<p>Enrico Drago, IGT PlayDigital Senior Vice President, highlighted that IGT’s partnership with Sports IQ will provide PlaySports customers with a more valuable entertainment experience. This will be achieved by compelling pre-game and in-play bet options across the top US professional sports leagues.</p>
<p>IGT’s Financial results in 4Q2020 and Full Year 2020</p>
<p>In the last quarter of 2020, IGT achieved $885 million in revenue and $96 million in operating income from continuing operations. Total revenue reported a 15% decrease compared to the $1.044 billion for the same period in 2019.</p>
<p>The reason for the decline was Global Gaming’s decline as the division brought in only $255 million in the quarter. This is nearly half as much as the $476 million achieved in the same quarter of 2019. The division was impacted by pandemic-related casino closures and operating restrictions.</p>
<p>The Global Lottery division Delivered posted the highest quarterly revenue and Adjusted EBITDA in two years in 4Q2020. Full year same-store sales increased by 7% in North America, while instant tickets and draw games reported the strongest annual growth in seven years.</p>
<p>Total revenue for the full year 2020 stood at $3.115 billion, a 23% decrease from the 2019 full-year result of $4.032 billion. Global Lottery posted $2.164 billion, 6% lower than the $2.293 billion in the previous year.</p>
