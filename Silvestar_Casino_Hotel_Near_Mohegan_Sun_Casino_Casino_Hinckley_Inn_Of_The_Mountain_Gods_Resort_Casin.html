    <h1>Silvestar Casino Hotel Near Mohegan Sun Casino Casino Hinckley Inn Of The Mountain Gods Resort Casin</h1>

<p>The National Lottery in the United Kingdom will not go through a tumultuous change of operator after all. There was a fear for a while there that the incumbent, Camelot, may actually seek to block the transfer of the license to Allwyn, the most recent winner, but this is unlikely to happen now that The High Court has decided to lift a suspension on Allwyn’s ascension as the new lottery operator.</p>
<p>This means that the National Lottery will not end up losing revenue nor will the UK Gambling Commission end up taking the blame for what could have been a major headache. Not all is over though, as Camelot may still seek to challenge the decision. Camelot argues that the tender was not conducted in good faith, something that the UKGC has vehemently denied.</p>
<p>Thanks to the High Court decision, the UKGC can finally begin the preparation work to make sure that Allwyn is indeed the one that steps into the position as license holder and operator come 2024. Allwyn won the bid back in 2024, but it was immediately challenged by Camelot.</p>
<p>The UKGC has stressed that its main priority remained to ensure that the transition of license holders goes smoothly and without impacting the money that has gone to good causes. Camelot blamed the UKGC for taking some good cause money to conduct the tender. But there’s too much at stake. The UKGC’s statement stressed how good causes may be impacted if a prolonged legal battle ensues:</p>
<p>"We made clear that disrupting the implementation of Allwyn’s plans would present potentially severe consequences for the National Lottery and good causes."</p>
<p>The watchdog assured that its ultimate priority was to make sure that the transition happens without any major disruptions so that participants and good causes can benefit in equal measure. The case will resume in October 2022, though. The UKGC responded by saying that it has run a fair and robust competition and it’s prepared to prove that before the relevant authorities and mediators.</p>
<p>With this in mind, the watchdog reaffirmed its commitment to defend its point of view and prove in a court of law that the entire process had been run in favor of customers. "We have taken every step possible to ensure a level playing field for all interested parties, to enable us to appoint a licensee who will engage and protect players, and run the National Lottery with integrity," the UKGC said in an official statement.</p>
<p>It's the UKGC determination to ensure that the new license holder will continue to contribute to societal good and drive innovation as well as investment.</p>
