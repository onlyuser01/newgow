<p>I have checked Responsible Gambling section, and this is what I found https://www.machancecasino.com/en/:</p>
<p>„RESPONSIBLE GAMBLING</p>
<p>Playing Limits</p>
<p>Gambling should be fun and entertaining, but it should also be approached with responsibility and limits. At MaChance we want your playing experience to always be positive, and we therefore encourage you to keep it under control by using the following limitation options:</p>
<p>Deposit Limit: We give you the option to limit your deposit in a time frame of a day/week/month. Please contact us and we will put in the limit you request.</p>
<p>Freeze Account: If you want a break from playing, you can put your account on hold whenever you like. Contact us and we will freeze your account for you."</p>
<p>Additionally, please see below FAQ:</p>
<p>I would recommend contacting the casino and requesting explicitly your account to be closed permanently (or frozen for a specific period). Here’s the email address support@machance.com. If you wish you can CC me on the email. Please let me know if this advice was helpful. I will be waiting for your reply patiently.</p>
