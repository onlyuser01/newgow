    <h1>Casinos Tunica Ms Hollywood Casino Hotel Maryland Heights Missouri Silver Slipper Casino Mississippi</h1>

<p>Sum Up:</p>
<p>My deposit bonus got canceled without any apparent reason, which led to winnings being voided because of the "you are not allowed to delay any bonus to a point were you don't have any wager requirements left"- rule.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>After I got a huge hit on King of Cats by Big Time Gaming, I noticed that the win and the win before weren't added to my balance. I noticed that my bonus got canceled ("lost") and figured that's probably the reason why. After I reached out to the casino they told me they will look into the matter (and they have to check up with the slot provider). It took them over a month to come up with any explanation. In the end, after I asked again, they suddenly told me my winnings got voided because of the "don't delay games to a point were you don't have wager requirements left"-rule. Which of course wasn't solving anything, because the problem was that the bonus got canceled.</p>
<p>I tried to get an explanation, but they ended up ignoring my email. If there's a legitimate reason why the bonus was canceled, the rule would certainly apply but, as to my knowledge, there is non. I still had money and time left to wager the bonus and as far as I know I didn't play any prohibited games. I read the bonus terms carefully and can't see why the bonus should have been canceled.</p>
<p>I just noticed they reset my account, so I can't look up any history anymore (no transactions, no bets, no bonus) too. I've got a screenshot of the bonus history and, if needed, screenshots of the terms and bonus terms from back then.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help!</p>
