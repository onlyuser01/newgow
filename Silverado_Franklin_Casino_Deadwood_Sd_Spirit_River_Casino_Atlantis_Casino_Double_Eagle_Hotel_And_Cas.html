<p>Real Madrid lost 2-0 to Real Sociedad on Tuesday, the result of which is that Los Blancos are now 14 points behind La Liga leaders Barcelona. Their dream of winning the league is practically over, but they do stand a great chance to win the Spanish Cup. For that, they just need to beat the +850 underdog Osasuna this coming Saturday.</p>

<p>Real Madrid Going All-In on in Copa del Rey</p>
<p>Real Madrid is King’s Club, so it would be more than appropriate for them to win King’s Cup. Even though this is the most successful Spanish club overall, Real Madrid is only third in the list of Copa del Rey winners, with Barcelona and Atletico Madrid having significantly more trophies.</p>
<p>Further, it’s been a while since Los Blancos won it the last time (2014), which is another incentive for these guys to give their utmost on Saturday. Still, the No. 1 reason why we expect Carlo Ancelotti’s boys to go all-in in Copa del Rey Final is that one trophy has already slipped from their hands.</p>
<p>They’ve got 14 points fewer than Barcelona in La Liga, and with just five more rounds left to play, Barca just need one point to seal the deal.</p>
<p>On the bright side for Los Blancos, they still have a good chance to retain the Champions League title – they’ve reached the semi-finals of that competition. The first leg of the Man City doubleheader is played three days after the Copa del Rey Final, but you can be certain that this fact doesn’t impact the players’ focus. These guys are coming to Seville determined to get ahold of the trophy.</p>
<p>Can Osasuna Cause the Biggest Upset in Spanish Soccer in 2023?</p>
<p>The short answer is – no. The longer answer is that the boys from the Basque Region just don’t have the quality needed to beat the Madrid powerhouse. So, how did they manage to get all the way to the final game of the Spanish Cup?</p>
<p>Well, they got lucky. In the semifinal, they were better than Athletic Bilbao, winning 2-1 on aggregate. They did okay in both of those games, but it’s the Athletic player who should feel bad about not putting in more effort.</p>
<p>Before that, Osasuna defeated out-of-shape Sevilla, as well as Real Betis. And in the early stages of the competition, these guys routinely beat a couple of teams from the lower tiers of the Spanish league system. Knowing all this, it’s clear that Osasuna’s toughest challenge is on the program on Saturday.</p>
<p>Real Madrid vs Osasuna Prediction</p>
<p>Real Madrid is the team that’s going to win the 2023 Copa del Rey on Saturday. Los Blancos do have some problems with injuries, but even if Ancelotti let only reserves on the pitch, they’d still do better than Osasuna.</p>
<p>Pick: Real Madrid to win</p>
