<p>KSI vs. Tommy Fury a.k.a. Judgement Day is the main card of MF &amp; DAZN: X Series 10 ‚Äì The Prime Card, an event which will take place at Manchester Arena on Saturday, October 14, 2023</p>
<p>YouTuber KSI has been working hard to show the world he‚Äôs good at boxing, something he started in 2018. So far, he‚Äôs had decent success, but the thing is that he‚Äôs never fought against such a good opponent as Tommy Fury. Tyson‚Äôs little brother is a real boxer whose professional record is 9-0 with his most recent win happening last February against another YouTube sensation, Jake Paul.</p>
<p>KSI vs. Tommy Fury Odds</p>

<p>KSI to Prove He‚Äôs Not Just Another YouTuber</p>
<p>Olajide Olayinka Williams ‚ÄúJJ‚Äù Olatunji better known as KSI is one of Britain‚Äôs most successful social media personalities and the man who practically started YouTube boxing. It all started five years ago, when he and another YouTuber, Joe Weller, had an amateur fight. Weller, who‚Äôs three inches shorter and significantly lighter than KSI, lost the fight by TKO.</p>
<p>The fight made other YouTubers interested in boxing, including those from America. The result is that only a few months after his first fight, KSI fought Logan Paul. That fight ended in a draw.</p>

<p>The two met again a year later, this time in a professional boxing bout, and this time, KSI won by a split decision. From there, he went on to beat Swarmz (rapper), Luis Alcaraz Pineda (boxer with a 2-7 record), and FaZe Temperrr (esports player).</p>
<p>In his most recent fight, KSI fought 40-year-old English businessman Joe Fournier. KSI KO-ed him, but the fight was declared no contest due to illegal elbow strikes.</p>
<p>Tommy Fury to Show He‚Äôs a Real Boxer</p>
<p>People have been accusing Tommy Fury of taking advantage of his brother Tyson‚Äôs fame. However, his professional boxing record tells a whole different story. The 24-year-old Englishman is 9-0 overall with four of his wins happening by a KO/TKO.</p>
<p>Sure, he hasn‚Äôt fought too many elite boxers, but we did see him derail the Jake Paul hype train in February. If you‚Äôre not familiar with his work inside the ring, Logan‚Äôs brother is thought to be the best YouTube boxer in the world. Actually, some pundits ‚Äì including Joe Rogan ‚Äì think of him as a proper pugilist with a bright future in this sport.</p>
<p>However, ‚ÄúProblem Child‚Äù ended up losing to Tommy Fury. It wasn‚Äôt an embarrassing loss for Paul (split decision), but he did suffer his first-ever win. Paul threw powerful punches in that bout, but Fury looked faster and way more tactical that evening. He outboxed his rival and is probably planning to do the same to KSI.</p>
<p>KSI vs. Tommy Fury Prediction</p>
<p>Eight months ago, Tommy Fury defeated the best YouTube boxer on the planet. KSI is nowhere near as good as Jake Paul, meaning that Fury should have a relatively easy job on his hands. He‚Äôs better than Olatunji in all aspects of boxing, so anything but a knockout win for ‚ÄúTNT‚Äù would be a massive surprise.</p>
<p>Pick: Tommy Fury to win by knockout/technical knockout</p>
