    <h1>Standish Casino Hollywood Casino Hotel Bangor Maine Casinos In Massachusetts Boomtown Casino Bossier</h1>

<p>So at the very beginning it was fascinating. Don't get me wrong, I've never played big stakes. So from time to time I staked 100 euros, stakes were 20 cents - just to play for a long time. Just for fun - if I was lucky, I had a + and if not, it wasn't tragic.</p>
<p>I have been gambling for about 11 years. , everything was actually always okay, or maybe I'm just telling myself it - only in the last 2.5 years, I've definitely exaggerated. It came covid-19-then quarantine was imposed, again a lot of time to play. Then it became more and more direction-playing to win back the losses. And since covid 19 came along, nothing worked in the casinos anymore.. Always just annoyed, cursed-terrible.</p>
<p>Recently I said to myself - out of the question, I want, I can't and mustn't anymore - I can't go on like this, otherwise I'll destroy livelihoods at some point, and that's not possible.</p>
<p>My first days without online casinos.</p>
<p>I'm on night duty at work. unfortunately too much time - my first thought - buy a Paysafecard. Bad. That was about 2-3 hours so buy yourself a paysafecard, come 25, is not much. Crazy what goes through your head. But then I realized I had to do more. So the next step was to block my Paysafe account. With an explicit emphasis, no matter what I write again, not to release it anymore.</p>
<p>And it was good - the next day, night shift again, and the first thing I did was write paysafecard.com, please activate my account. It's so extreme.</p>
<p>Went to the casino again today, what did I do, just tested games, without paying-that is, only with play money. Just try these game features where you can buy free spins. Brought me down a bit again.</p>
<p>My next step will be sometime in the next few days - to exchange the email address, it's amazing what emails I get from casinos, about bonuses and so on.</p>
<p>So those were my first days without a casino - it's not easy at all, but I want to make it, and I will make it.</p>
<p>I thank you all, wish you a nice week-because I'll be on vacation anyway until Holy Saturday! happy holidays to you all"</p>
