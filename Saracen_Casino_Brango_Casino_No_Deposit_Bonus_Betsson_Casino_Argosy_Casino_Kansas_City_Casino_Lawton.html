<p>Sports betting operator Parimatch has found a powerful ally – Oleksandr Usyk. Ukraine’s undefeated boxing champion will be joining as Parimatch’s ambassador for responsible gambling.</p>
<p>Success in Sports and Betting</p>
<p>With 18 victories behind his back, Usyk knows what is needed for success, citing “willpower, intrinsic motivation and self-control” as some of the character traits that allow people to enjoy both sports and gambling. Usyk emphasized that gambling should be a way for people to have fun, and they should always be able to put it on hold if needed. This mindset is what constitutes “responsible gambling,” according to the boxing champion.</p>
<p>“Therefore, I join the initiative of Parimatch, which will raise the awareness of players about the principles of fair, responsible, and transparent gambling,” Usyk announced.</p>
<p>Maksym Liashko, Co-CEO of Parimatch’s development company, Parimatch Tech, spoke about the importance of responsible gambling for the industry and Parimatch’s commitment to it. Liashko said that the operator would spare no effort to advance the responsible gambling project. It will use analysts and client feedback in order to better the gambling experience for its clients.</p>
<p>“We are confident that the partnership with Oleksandr will take our initiatives to a new level and help Parimatch spread knowledge about responsible gambling among players worldwide,” Liashko stated.</p>
<p>Parimatch’s Commitment to Responsible Gambling</p>
<p>Responsible gambling has been one of the hot topics on the global wagering market, especially since various bodies have critiqued the industry for not offering assistance to gambling addicts or creating such. Therefore it is in the operators’ best interest to help establish a healthy and user-friendly betting experience for clients and make it as safe as it is exciting. This is done through education campaigns that teach people to make informed decisions, preventing addiction, and setting deposit limits.</p>
<p>As one of the leaders on the European market, Parimatch realizes the importance of committing to responsible gambling. The operator has been working to provide its clients with the tools and educational materials that help them make informed decisions.</p>
<p>The partnership with the Ukrainian boxing star will help raise awareness for responsible gambling among fans. Parimatch always plays big when it comes to partnerships with sports stars. The operator has partnered with other big names such as the UFC professionals Petr Yan, Antonina Shevchenko, and Valentina Shevchenko, as well as the MMA elite Conor McGregor.</p>
<p>Parimatch has strong ties with some of the best European sports and esports clubs. The operator recently celebrated the first year of its partnership with Juventus, hoping that is only the first of many to come. Earlier this month, Parimatch inked agreements with three other European clubs.</p>
