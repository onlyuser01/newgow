    <h1>Desert Diamond Casino West Valley Photos Gulfstream Park Casino Casinos Us Isle Casino Hotel Bettend</h1>

<p>Registered iWild casino on 22.08.2022 and did total 3 deposits by cryptocurrency 1000 USDT each having my casino account in EUR go 2999.48 EUR to my account</p>
<p>I had only 2 gaming sessions on 22.08.2022 and 23.08.2022 later when tried to login to casino same day on 23.08.2022 I got a message that my account is blocked due to 'gambling addiction'. I clarified via online chat support what kinf problem I have and they redirected me to email support. On 24.08.2022 got a responce stating my account blocked and all funds and winnings seized and they only return my my lasy deposit of 1000 EUR minus fee of 15% so I got only 848 usdt to my cryptowallet out of 4254 EUR left on my account (see scrennshot).</p>
<p>Here is the only casino answer on the matter:</p>
<p>=====</p>
<p>Risk Department of the IWildCasino has conducted a detailed review of your CHARLIE login. Your account CHARLIE - did not pass the casino security check.</p>
<p>When checking your game session, a violation of the project rules was detected, namely: 13.1. Regarding to the company and during the usage of services, provided by , users are prohibited from: - using unfair advantages (the usage of analysis systems aimed at forecasting of game results or influencing on it);</p>
<p>According to the detected violation of the project rules, your balance has been canceled and your account has been closed.</p>
<p>In accordance with paragraph 7.6 of the rules: (7.6. In case of violation of the rules of the project, the casino administration can return the deposits to the player with the deduction of administrative commission up to 15%, depending on the player's payment method).</p>
<p>It was decided to return the amount of your last deposit (minus the administrative fee of 15%).</p>
<p>According to the rules of the project, you are prohibited from playing on this site. The Casino is not responsible for the opening of a new account by you and any losses that you may incur after opening a new account. We reserve the right to close an account created in violation of these rules at any time.</p>
<p>This decision is final and not subject to revision.</p>
<p>=======</p>
<p>I didn't used any kind of "unfair advantage" during the game. This is the old story but only card counting was used and it's quite clear is 100% LEGAL and FAIR. So this is the act of robbery from iWild casino. I claim to be paid in full including all my deposits and winnings in the total amount of 4254 EUR (partialy paid in the amount of 848 usdt ONLY).</p>
<p>PS. This is really a frustrating thing about your project that you put such kind of garbage and croocked casinos on the top of the list. How can casinos like this be of 'perfect reputation'. Is this a joke? This is your site's responsibility - I registered this casino because of your advice. Please read carefully real players reviews - they are not happy at all.</p>
