    <h1>Resorts World Casino Ojibwa Casino Baraga Laberge Casino Perchanga Casino Angel Winds Casino Sightli</h1>

<p>US sports betting and casino gaming market’s leading digital payments provider and mobile app developer Sightline has entered a partnership with multinational gambling company International Game Technology.</p>
<p>Sightline and IGT Team Up</p>
<p>As per the deal, Sightline and IGT will team up to provide cashless gaming solutions using Play+, Sightline’s digital commerce platform, as well as through several IGT’s brands – the IGTPay full-service funding solution, the PlaySports betting platform, and the Resort Wallet cashless solution.</p>
<p>With the agreement in place, IGTPay and Resort Wallet have already added Sightline’s Play+ as a payment method. Thanks to this, bettors can now use Play+ to add funds to their Resort Wallet account and use them for various online gambling offerings.</p>
<p>The deal will also provide gamblers with state-of-the-art tools that allow them to gamble more responsibly. Those will include statistics of their betting behavior and self-monitoring tools, as well as ways to set a spending limit. Spending limits can be said for daily and hourly play.</p>
<p>This, combined with the fact that most casinos already have self-monitoring tools of their own, helps bettors to gamble responsively and cleverly and mitigate gambling harm.</p>
<p>Meeting the Market’s Demands</p>
<p>Sightline’s co-chief executive officer, Joe Pappano, spoke on the partnership. He pointed out that the company’s tech is designed to better the gambling experience for both customers and betting operators. Pappano believes that teaming up with IGT’s complementary suite of products will allow even more traditional casino floors to adopt a fully cashless model.</p>
<p>Pappano is sure that the deal with IGT will provide players with “the greatest variety of funding and withdrawal options,” which, in turn, will increase customer engagement and retention.</p>
<p>Ryan Reddy, IGT’s senior vice president VLT, system, and payments, also spoke on the matter. Reddy is looking forward to partnering with Sightline and ushering in a new age of cashless gambling. He confirmed Pappano’s words by saying that the partnership’s end goal is to have entire cashless floors. In Reddy’s vision, these floors will be powered by the IGT Advantage system with the IGTPay and Resort Wallet solutions and will provide an “unparalleled, cashless gaming experience by offering Play+ as a funding method for players.”</p>
<p>“The demand for cashless gaming solutions is at an all-time high and increasing rapidly, so this partnership will help operators give their patrons the convenience they’re looking for in a safe, secure and seamless manner,” Ruddy concluded.</p>
<p>IGT continues its focus on expansion and innovation. The company recently appointed the passionate industry veteran Joe Asher as its new president of sports betting. Earlier, IGT secured a 10-year lottery management contract in Connecticut.</p>
