<p>British public health charity GambleAware is enjoying success in its endeavor of mitigating gambling harm among high-risk groups. GambleAware remains bullish on spreading the word of the National Gambling Treatment Service and urging people with harmful gambling tendencies to seek help.</p>
<p>GambleAware’s Engagement Has Grown</p>
<p>The initiative has been focused on the broad Public Gambling Severity Index 8+ group, or rather the young men at high risk of developing unhealthy wagering tendencies. The recent RET charity headline campaign managed to engage about 74% of the people within that group.</p>
<p>The record engagement led to numerous people agreeing to call NGTS should they start expressing signs of irresponsible wagering and gambling harm. The number of people who are likely to contact help has seen a year-to-year increase by 13% (from 47% in 2020 to 60% in 2021).</p>
<p>The increase in engagement has improved the overall likelihood of people seeking professional advice when their gambling habits spiral out of control. According to the NGTS, calls to the National Gambling Helpline have increased by 41% between 2019 and 2021.</p>
<p>GambleAware Will Continue Combating Problem Gambling</p>
<p>GambleAware’s campaign increased its efforts in London and the Midlands where more problem gamblers have been recorded. The charity’s chief executive officer, Zoë Osmond, spoke about the NGTS and its effectiveness.</p>
<p>“The National Gambling Treatment Service brings together a network of organizations across Great Britain that provides free confidential treatment and support for anyone experiencing gambling harms,” she explained.</p>
<p>Osmond added that it’s really “heartening” to see that the campaign is making a change and helping to convince people in risk groups to seek help when they experience any harm. She is glad that more and more gamblers become aware of the availability of treatment services.</p>
<p>GambleAware’s initiatives have been supported by some of the biggest names in the United Kingdom’s betting sector. A few days ago, the charity announced that it has received $14.6 million in donations from various gambling operators. Bet365, Entain, and William Hill remained as top donators and provided $5.8 million, $2.7 million, and $1.4 million respectively.</p>
<p>The three aforementioned operators, alongside Flutter, have promised to donate as much as $137 million by the end of 2023. This money will be used to boost GambleAware’s efforts and help to mitigate gambling harm across the country.</p>
<p>In September, GambleAware invested $3.4 million to help to gamble education and research across England and Wales. This initiative also has a strong focus on young people at high risk of developing addictive behaviors.</p>
