<p>Betway has recently revealed its plans to become a member of Branschföreningen för Onlinespel (BOS), the Swedish trade association for online gambling operators. BOS is primarily responsible for ensuring that online gaming companies are not subject to any unfair policies. As such it was only natural for Betway which is a recent entrant into the Swedish online gaming scene to join the party. It officially kicked off operations in that market earlier this year. The company currently holds an online casino license and a sports betting license in Sweden.</p>
<p>Where Does BOS Come In?</p>
<p>The Swedish gambling market was restructured in a number of ways in late 2018 and early 2019. This move has put several gaming companies under pressure since they have to adjust to the new laws. To make things even worse, there is still a lot of uncertainty since the regulations change quite often.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, Branschföreningen för Onlinespel (BOS) mainly caters to protecting the rights of online gaming companies. Betway seems to be in need of some protecting tight now. Even though the company is barely a year old in the Swedish market, it has been in the crosshairs of the Spelinspektionen, the country’s gambling regulator. In fact, just a few months ago the company had to part with SEK 5 million in fines after the regulator accused it of breaching some of the gaming laws.</p>
<p>By being a member of BOS, Betway will now be able to stay aligned with all the updated gaming regulations. According to Gustaf Hoffstedt, the secretary-general of BOS, the association is exactly what Betway needs and it fits right into their membership profile. That is, they have similar interests in terms of their consumer protection efforts, long-term visions as well as their dedication to staying in line with gaming regulations.</p>
<p>More About Branschföreningen för Onlinespel</p>
<p>Some of the members of the trade association include popular gambling companies like Scientific Games, bet365, Mr. Green, Kindred, GVC Holdings and LeoVegas. Together, they have been working hard to ensure that the market policies are fair for both the consumers and themselves.</p>
<p>In the past week, the association has even weighed in on a report on the state of gambling in Sweden. This report was published by the country’s gambling regulator. According to the report between 85 and 87 percent of gambling in the country is regulated. BOS disputed these figures since they believe that they are much lower than the actual target which is 90 percent.</p>
