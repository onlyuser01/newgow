<p>Arizona Became the First State to Reach $1B in Three Months</p>
<p>Sports betting operators in Arizona generated in November wagers less than the previous month but enough to make the state the first to reach the $1 billion mark in just three months of operation, the monthly event wagering report released by the Arizona Department of Gaming (ADG) revealed.</p>
<p>One, Two, Three – One Billion</p>
<p>Arizona sportsbooks gobbled $466.7 million in November, down 2.6% on the previous month’s total of $479.3 million in wagers. Adding the September total of $291.2 million, Arizona sports betting generated nearly $1.23 billion for the first three months of operation since the state officially launched to become the quickest state to reach the significant mark.</p>
<p>Accounting for winnings paid to players in November, $415.3 million, Arizona sportsbooks ended the month with adjusted gross event wagering receipts of $50.27 million, up more than 38% on the previous month reading of $38.33 million due to the better margin, 10.77% as compared to 8% for October.</p>
<p>Adjusting the net gross receipts with the number of promotional credits and free bets, $18.37 million, sports betting operators accounted for $31.9 million in adjusted receipts subject to privilege fees, to generate $3.18 million in fees. For comparison, October accounted for a higher promotional spend, $25.97 million, to end with lower taxable revenue, $10.35 million, and lower privilege fees, $1.02 million.</p>
<p>Online Bets Lead the Way</p>
<p>Online wagering entirely dominated the month contributing to 98.4% of the state’s total leaving the remaining 1.6% to retail sports betting.</p>
<p>Among operators, DraftKings/Crown Gaming partnership accounted for $148.7 million of online generated wagers to affirm its first position despite the decrease of 1.8% compared to the previous month. The pair ended the month with $12.5 million in adjusted receipts prior to paying taxes.</p>
<p>Second place was for FanDuel, accounting for $4.67 million in retail and $113.3 million in online wagering, down from $4.85 million and $115.9 million in retail and online wagers in October. The Flutter-owned brand generated $15.4 million in adjusted receipts, more than DraftKings due to significantly lower winnings paid.</p>
<p>Third was BetMGM with $93.16 million of online wagers which generated $9.52 million in adjusted receipts prior taxes. The remaining places in the ranking were for Caesars, Penn Sports, WynnBET, Rush Street Interactive, and TwinSpires, while Kindred’s Unibet ranked last.</p>
