    <h1>Casinos In Baton Rouge Louisiana Cherokee Casinos Casinos In Cali Casinos In San Diego Akwesasne Cas</h1>

<p>I am writing to express my disappointment and frustration with the online casino, Playfina. Despite winning a significant amount of money at their casino, they have repeatedly refused to pay me and have caused me great inconvenience through their KYC process.</p>
<p>I understand that they have an automatic KYC system, and I have already provided all the necessary documents to prove my identity and address. However, their customer service representatives have continued to make unreasonable demands, at least four times now.</p>
<p>The first time, they asked for proof of my ID and address, which I promptly provided. The second time, they asked for a photo of me holding a paper with their name and my ID, which I also provided. While these requests were already tedious, I complied with them.</p>
<p>However, the third time, they asked for the paper to have a pattern and to rewrite everything, which was completely absurd. Nonetheless, I did it to get my KYC approved and get my money. Unfortunately, this was still not enough for them, and they asked for a fourth time. This time, they wanted me to take a photo of myself with the patterned paper in front of a sign that shows my home address. This request was entirely illogical and made no sense as I had already provided proof of my address. Furthermore, I do not have any sign in front of my house.</p>
<p>It is clear that Playfina is doing everything possible to avoid paying me my winnings. I cannot understand why you would recommend such a dishonest and unreliable online casino to your users. As an information source, I believe you also have a responsibility to ensure that the casinos you recommend are reputable and treat their customers fairly</p>
