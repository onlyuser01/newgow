<p>Relax Gaming has signed a new partner for its Powered By Relax program, which will now include Air Dice, an innovative development of online casino games. Air Dice was founded all the way back in 2002 and has been one of the most prominent and out-of-the-box companies in the industry.</p>
<p>Relax Welcomes a New Partner to the Program</p>
<p>Air Dice has had the opportunity to provide its games to a number of industry-leading brands, such as Napoleon Games, Ladbrokes, and Unibet, and it has been delivering a consistently good product.</p>
<p>Air Dice’s speciality lies in Dice Placement and Shifter Games, both of which are designed to break away from conventional gameplay and offer alternative iGaming stories and features. Air Dice will certainly be able to benefit from Relax Gaming’s own platform which will empower it to quickly strike home with new operators in the industry.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Air Dice already has the title in mind it would want to share with operators through Relax Gaming, including Light in the Dark, Goddess of Justice and Alice in the Rose Maze. Relax Gaming director of casino products Shelley Hannah has welcomed the partnership and said:</p>
<p>Intuitive new products like this are exactly what we look out for as we strive to ensure our operator partners stand out from the crowd. Relax Gaming Director of Casino Products Shelley Hannah</p>
<p>This partnership will help Air Dice reach new distribution channels and companies and Powered By will definitely play a crucial role in the company’s further success. Air Dice partner and CBDO Erkki Nikunen was similarly pleased with the partnership and said that the deal was a very important milestone for his company.</p>
<p>The (Air) Die Is Cast</p>
<p>Nikunen welcomed the opportunity and added that everyone was excited to see how the partnership panned out.</p>
<p>“We’re looking forward to getting our new games like Hero of Dragonland, Goddess of Justice and Fruit Shifter to several new markets with Relax and accelerate our growth,” Nikunen explained.</p>
<p>Octopus Global recently joined Relax Gaming, as another innovative studio looking to expand its own reach and clout in the industry through the powerful partner program. Relax Gaming has been keeping busy, signing up a number of prominent studios to consolidate its own product variety and available options for operators.</p>
<p>In September, the company signed partnerships with Jade Rabbit Studio and Thunderkick, as the company grows its portfolio of partners monthly.</p>
