    <h1>Free Signup Bonus No Deposit Casino Playstar Casino Game Casino Online Free Limitless Casino Login M</h1>

<p>Betplays is a company that does not accept ALL documents for address verification, I sent a Physical Electricity Bill for verification, they rejected it for no reason and asked for another PDF version of the bill (utility bill or bank statement)</p>
<p>I have generated an original bank statement from my bank account but this too is rejected for no reason, documents are 100% original and accepted in all other casinos, services and expert vetting sites, e.g. Onifido etc.</p>
<p>Casino.Guru, I will gladly provide you with the documents so that you can check their authenticity and find one reason why betplays rejects it.</p>
<p>my withdraw is stuck and it is not possible to withdraw because Betplays has found a new way in the industry to reject all documents without giving a reason, even though the documents meet the conditions and are accepted in professional companies for KYC.</p>
<p>I agree to check the documents with professional KYC companies Sumsub, Onifido or similar, because I am sure that the KYC employee at betplays is not a professional person by rejecting the original document.</p>
<p>The funds in my account come from real money, I have never used the bonuses on the Betplays website.</p>
