<p>Dear Dorothy,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. I have checked terms and conditions, and this is what I found:</p>
<p>"A customer can withdraw money from his account only after he has rolled each of his deposits at least 5 times. Wagers with minimum/no risk are not counted towards the rollover. If the player doesn’t meet this requirement, Slot10 reserves the right to charge the withdrawal request with up to 8% administrative fee."</p>
<p>It means that if you have deposited $40 you need to place bets in amount of $200 before you’ll be able to withdraw your winnings. It is not unusual for a casino to have this rule. Some casinos require deposit wagering 1x, some 3x or 5x, but you can find casinos with even higher wagering requirements for real money. Your active balance should be available to you once you complete wagering requirements. Could you please confirm that your account is still accessible and your balance active?</p>
<p>Additionally, this is what I found in the FAQ section:</p>
<p>"How can I reach you if I need help with completing my registration?</p>
<p>You can always contact us via email: support@slot10.com or chat via any Live Chat banner on our website, and our team will do its best to provide any assistance needed."</p>
<p>Please let us know if this information was helpful. Looking forward to hearing from you.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
