<p>The renowned betting and gaming brand with a strong presence within the gambling sector in the UK and Ireland, QuinnBet, announced a new multi-year agreement. Details regarding the latest collaboration emerged Thursday and saw the company become an official partner of the Northampton Town Football Club, the professional association soccer club competing for the EFL League One, based in Northampton, England.</p>
<p>Thanks to the new collaboration, QuinnBet will benefit from brand exposure via boards placed on the northeast and southeast corners of the Sixfields stadium. Moreover, the operator will benefit from exposure via boards placed in the TV arc at the stadium, helping increase brand awareness even further.</p>
<p>The collaboration with Northampton marks an important milestone for QuinnBet as it complements its ongoing growth. The company initially launched its services nearly a decade ago, back in August 2017. Since then, QuinnBet has been rapidly growing within the regulated gambling sector in Ireland, as well as the UK.</p>
<p>The company is currently licensed and regulated by the Government of Gibraltar, as well as the Gibraltar Gambling Commissioner. Moreover, as noted, it has established its presence in Great Britain via licensing from the Gambling Commission. In Ireland, QuinnBet has established its operations under the Betting Amendment Act 2015.</p>
<p>Constantly growing its operations, QuinnBet remains dedicated to delivering unique gambling experiences for its customer base. The company offers an online casino platform as well as a sportsbook that are available for desktop and mobile devices. Now, thanks to the multi-year deal with Northampton, QuinnBet is expected to grow further its presence in the UK and Ireland, reaching new customers.</p>

He spoke about the club’s extensive history in soccer, highlighting iconic wins for the team. “Like the Cobblers, QuinnBet operates in an industry dominated by large competitors, but that doesn’t detract from our ambitions to strive for the top,” added McPartland.</p>
<p>“We are delighted to commence this 3-year advertising partnership with Northampton Town FC, it has been a pleasure working with their commercial team.“ Niall McPartland, head of commercial and sponsorship at QuinnBet</p>
