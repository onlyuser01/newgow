    <h1>Raging Bull Casino 100 Free Chip Rooms At Mgm Casino Diamond Casino Heist Digits 7 Casino New York C</h1>

<p>My first couple withdrawals from them were within a couple days. Now this last one it's over a month and still waiting. They expect their players to follow the Terms and Conditions to a T, but when it comes to them it's like they are just a suggestion. Rediculous. It's just unacceptable the way they are making people wait this long. I made a complaint, but from what I've gathered from these forums all they do is stall by asking you to verify your Bitcoin address, etc...and they have it. They are just trying to buy time and hope you get your money during the back and forth of emails. They all know they can't escalate $&amp;i@, but it sounds good so thats what they tell us.</p>
<p>Why have an online casino if you can't payout?</p>
<p>I was playing this morning at a different casino and when I cashed out I had my money literally within minutes...no problem. I don't see how the same process can differ that much.</p>
