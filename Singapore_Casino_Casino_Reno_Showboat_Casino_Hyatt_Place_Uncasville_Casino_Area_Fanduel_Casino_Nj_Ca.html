<p>Caesars Entertainment, the US largest casino-entertainment company and operator of Caesars Sportsbook, announced it signed a multi-year partnership with the Buffalo Bills to make Caesars Sportsbook an Official Mobile Betting Partner of the NFL franchise.</p>
<p>Fan Experiences and Sportsbook-Style Club Lounge</p>
<p>The multi-faceted sports partnership deal between Caesars and the Bills will deliver custom fan experiences ‘fit for a Caesar’ and sponsorships, and will also grant the casino operator with the naming rights for a new sportsbook-style club lounge in the northwest corner tower of the existing Business Class Club at the home of the Bills, Highmark Stadium.</p>
<p>“This partnership gives us the opportunity to connect with one of the most passionate fan bases in all of sports. We’re ready to welcome Bills fans into the Caesars Empire and offer them access to best-in-class hospitality experiences through our Caesars Sportsbook app as we continue to expand our footprint across the state of New York and beyond.” Chris Holdren, Co-President, Caesars Digital</p>
<p>Caesars Sportsbook was one of the first four sportsbooks to launch mobile and online sports wagering operations in New York with the official launch on Saturday, January 8, 2022, and start benefiting from the huge potential from the very beginning.</p>
<p>New York sportsbooks reportedly registered 5.8 million transactions in the first 12 hours of operation, while some websites estimated nearly $200 million in wagers were handled during the first weekend of mobile sports betting, as compared to $3.7 million in retail bets over two fiscal years.</p>
<p>Digital Content, In-Stadium Signage and Caesars Rewards</p>
<p>Through the new deal, Caesars is looking to extend its sportsbook brand’s reach to Bills’ fans not only in Western New York but also in Southern Ohio, utilizing broadcast and digital content across the franchise’s properties and in-game TV-visible signage at Highmark Stadium. A co-branded beanie giveaway will be offered to Bills’ fans who attend the Wild Card playoff game against the New England Patriots.</p>
<p>“The Caesars Sportsbook app is a premier sports betting app that connects sports fans and delivers best-in-class experiences. We’re very excited to work together with Caesars to engage Bills fans throughout Western New York and Southern Ontario, bringing these unique experiences right to their fingertips.” Dan Misko, SVP, Business Development, Pegula Sports &amp; Entertainment</p>
<p>“We look forward to the new attraction Caesars will bring to Highmark Stadium next season, and to working with Caesars Sportsbook for many years to come,” Misko added.</p>
<p>The partnership also will see Caesars gain access to official logos and marks of the Bills, while Caesars Sportsbook bettors will get to enjoy the perks of the operator’s industry-leading loyalty program, Caesars Rewards, offering them a wide range of VIP experiences and hospitalities.</p>
