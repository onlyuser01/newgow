<p>NOC*NSF CEO Gerard Dielessen said that this is an essential project for understanding betting exposure that is afforded to Dutch sport.</p>

<p>Sportradar Integrity Services Managing Director Andreas Krannich said that with this pilot agreement, NOC*NSF shows that they are ready to protect domestic sports competitions from match manipulation and integrity risk.</p>
<p>Krannich said that NOC*NSF would receive ongoing support with analysis of betting market trends, risk factors, developments, and any other threats discussed during the regular reviews. According to him, as this agreement is the first of its kind, it should serve as an example of a national multisport monitoring agreement to other nations.</p>
