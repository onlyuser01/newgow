    <h1>Cafe Casino 100 No Deposit Bonus Casinos In Oklahoma Durant Yamava Casino New Pa Online Casino Real</h1>

<p>I made a request for withdrawal, requested documents, sent them, in a day they ask me again for the same documents. I checked it out, sent it again. The next day, it's the same story. The amount is ridiculous at 80 euros + 110 on the totalizator account, which during the open withdrawal request I can only put in the totalizator and can not transfer between accounts. On the third day I signed up for a chat with the question why they are stalling and ignore my letters, replied that this time they have sent my documents to the legal department for inspection. I never understood why they had kept silent before. One more strange thing. Yesterday all the records were missing from the transaction history, as if I hadn't had any deposits, but I can easily confirm this because I paid both times from Neteller. Today they also refused to verify me, asking me to wait again. I'm 100% sure they just squeezed 80 Euros) they seem to be hoping that I'll pour in and throw them more, but after that I'll be bypassing this institution and advising others to do the same.</p>
