    <h1>Ip Casino In Biloxi Cosmo Casino Casino Free Online Casino Nj Casino French Lick Suprabets Casino Th</h1>

<p>Hi.</p>
<p>I registered an account at Suprabets 07.05.22. I deposited about 1200 euros. Can't remember the exact amount since it was done in crypto and I do not have access to my account anymore. I wagered all on Brighton to beat Man United.</p>
<p>After this I had about 3900 euros in the account. I sent in the requested documents for KYC, got it approved and asked for a withdrawal of 2500 euros.</p>
<p>After a couple days and not having received my withdrawal I try to login to my account again. "Client locked" it says. I ask live chat what is going on, and they tell me to wait for response on email.</p>
<p>This is the response I received on 13.05:</p>
<p>"Dear player,</p>
<p>Your account has been flagged in our database by the Department of Risk and Fraud Prevention due to suspicious activity.</p>
<p>It violeated our terms and conditions, Section 11.4.1 of our general terms and conditions.</p>
<p>We invite all players to gamble in a recreational environment with fair conduct so that all customers can enjoy our services.</p>
<p>According to our terms We are entitled to void your winnings and retain your balance and close your account."</p>
<p>I responded imediately asking what thats supposed to mean, since I haven't actually done anything wrong. I have wagered at a lot of companies, and never have I experienced anything like this. Since than I have not received a response, proof of anything or even a slight explanation on what I have done wrong.</p>
<p>Absolutely unbelievable business model if they are allowed to just block winning players and not paying out their money due to suspicious acitivity, without even explaining what has been done wrong. They can tell this to anybody without showing any evidence and steal their money.</p>
<p>Also it is almost impossible to communicate with them when they are using 2 weeks to respond on my emails.</p>
<p>Best regards</p>
<p>Torgeir</p>
