<p>Penn National Thanks Mr. Williams for His Hard Work and Dedication</p>
<p>Ensuring a smooth transition, Mr. Williams has agreed to stay with the company and provide a temporary advisory role. He deemed his experience at Penn National as exciting. While he was a part of the company, a key partnership was inked with Barstool Sports, but the pandemic has also brought a temporary shutdown of all operations.</p>
<p>“To say my relatively brief tenure at Penn National was a roller coaster ride would be an understatement,” wrote David Williams in a statement</p>
<p>Mr. Williams added that he is very proud of the way Penn National has responded to the “unprecedented challenges the pandemic presented”. Outlining that this was a planned departure, he revealed that the challenges related to the remote work and the “potential strain of a relocation” of his family are among the reasons that led him to this difficult decision.</p>
<p>Mr. Snowden thanked Mr. Williams for his dedication and support over the last year. Furthermore, he outlined that Mr. Williams was “quickly thrown into the fire“, but stepped up and helped navigate Penn National through the unprecedented challenges brought by the pandemic.</p>
