<p>The idea of social sports betting is relatively new in the US, but is catching on. From the outside looking in, sports betting has been viewed by many as an activity that only dedicated gamblers can participate in, but social sports betting looks to alter that perception. The newest operator to launch in the US and offer free-to-play games tied to sports and sports betting is Low6, which just signed a deal with the NFL’s Jacksonville Jaguars.</p>
<p>Low6 Makes US Debut</p>
<p>Low6, a recipient of “Innovation of the Year” at the 2021 EGR iGaming Awards, has stepped into the US sports betting market through a new partnership with the Jacksonville Jaguars. The agreement will lead to the release of a free-to-play mobile game, UltimateJags, that combines “pack openings with fantasy sports,” according to the operator’s announcement. UltimateJags is currently available for iOS devices in the App Store or through the official Jaguars app. No information on when it will be available for Android devices has been provided.</p>
<p>Low6 Chief Strategy Officer, North America Josh Turk adds, “We are excited to introduce UltimateJags to avid DUUUVAL fans across North America. Our experienced gaming team has developed a creative twist on fantasy sports, simplifying gameplay and introducing high value collection of your favorite Jags players. We’re taking card collection digitally with the added bonus of using your card collection to earn fantasy points each week that ultimately awards top users with unique Jacksonville Jaguars experiences and prizes!”</p>
<p>Social Gaming Finds a Market</p>
<p>Social sports gaming has started to draw interest for its usual free-to-play model. This gives individuals who aren’t yet ready to embrace real-money sports betting a chance to see if they want to join the crowd without any risk. It also gives non-bettors an opportunity to see what all the hype is about. It’s a steppingstone that operators hope will lead to more active involvement in sports betting.</p>
<p>Low6’s new relationship with the Jaguars will see two people each week of the regular season win tickets to attend the team’s last regular season game against the Indianapolis Colts at home on January 9. Low6 is also partnered with the LA Chargers and the Cincinnati Bengals of the NFL, as well as the UFC. It also introduced UltimateFan, a similar social gaming product, for Euro2020.</p>
<p>Adds Jamie Mitchell, Low6 co-founder and Global CEO, “We’re delighted to catapult Low6’s expansion into the states launching our proprietary gaming platform with the Jacksonville Jaguars. We anticipate avid fans sharing their exciting pack openings online, trading with friends and scoring fantasy points to win incredible money-can’t-buy experiences, all for free. The ever-so growing of GenZ/Milennial (sic) Jaguars fans investing in ticket sales, year-over-year, demonstrates the demand to create new digital inventory that speaks to this audience. Low6 is well positioned to capture this passionate fandom group through digital community-led mobile gamification that provides Jaguars with new opportunities to drive engagement among their young fans and ultimately drive revenue back to the team.”</p>
