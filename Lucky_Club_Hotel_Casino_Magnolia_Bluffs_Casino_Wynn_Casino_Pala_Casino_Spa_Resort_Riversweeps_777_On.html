    <h1>Lucky Club Hotel Casino Magnolia Bluffs Casino Wynn Casino Pala Casino Spa Resort Riversweeps 777 On</h1>

<p>One of the longest-standing chief executives for the charity has announced her decision to fold her position after a five-year tenure</p>
<p>Anna Hemmings was at the helm of the organization, helping guide its strategy in transforming the gambling industry in the United Kingdom over the past five years which proved some of the most interesting for the industry.</p>
<p>Hemmings Tenure Was Marked by Challenges and Successes</p>
<p>Gambling witnessed a significant shift towards the improvement of regulation centered around consumer protection, and the country passed seminal pieces of legislation, including a bill that limits the betting size of individual wagers on FOBTs.</p>
<p>Hemmings guided GamCare through the COVID-19 pandemic and collaborated with the government as part of the UK White Paper that was published earlier this year. Under Hemmings’ guidance, GamCare shifted towards digital channels in a bid to assist more consumers who are turning to online gambling products.</p>
<p>GamCare launched its dedicated MyGamCare platform to provide consumers with more protection. The organization stated that Hemmings’ decision comes at “the right time” for her to “move on. The outgoing chief executive herself had this to say:</p>
<p>It has been an enormous privilege to work in this fantastic charity over the last few years. In that time, GamCare has changed in so many positive ways that mean that tens of thousands more people who need support are reached than five years ago. GamCare’s ex-CEO Anna Hemmings</p>
<p>She said it was a proud moment in her life to be the chief executive of GamCare and thanked all colleagues and the phenomenal network of stakeholders for the dedication and support of her stint at the helm.</p>
<p>Her stint will be remembered as a time when the organization took a very hard look at the industry and began addressing some of its most glaring problems, including the lack of support for problem gambling in prison for one, and the expansion of existing treatment, support, and educational groups and materials.</p>
<p>Leaving the Organizaiton in a Much Better Place</p>
<p>In her absence, the temporary post of chief executive will be taken by Margot Daly, GamCare’s Chair of Trustees. Daly hailed Hemmings’ successes in the industry and said that she was a true leader and champion of GamCare, leaving the organization in a much stronger position after her wake.</p>
<p>“Anna has led the charity with great thought ​and has been a true champion of those with gambling issues,” Hemmings added. The Betting and Gaming Council also pitched in with BGC Chair Brigid Simmonds congratulating Hemmings for her excellent work.</p>
