<p>Sports betting entertainment solutions provider OpenBet announced it has secured a deal with Multi Builder Limited to acquire its proprietary sports technology and quantitative trading models.</p>
<p>Key Development to Pricing &amp; Trading Services</p>
<p>The agreement for the acquisition of Multi Builder’s assets trading as ‘Sportsbook Models’ will further enhance OpenBet’s sportsbook trading and content portfolio to help the solutions provider grow its position in the sports betting scene. OpenBet will also acquire the talent of Sportsbook Training Services as part of the deal.</p>
<p>Commenting on the announcement, OpenBet’s chief product officer Nikos Konstakis outlined the deal that “marks another significant milestone” as key to the development of OpenBet’s Pricing &amp; Trading Services strategy, driving value to the business “through deeper market offerings alongside higher flexibility.”</p>
<p>Konstakis then continued by going back to previous acquisitions of DonBest and SportCast, which, together with OpenBet’s internal roadmap, led to content and pricing revenue growth of over 100% in 2021.</p>
<p>“The addition of Multi Builder Limited allows us to accelerate this growth trajectory, drive innovation and offer next-level betting entertainment for our operators’ players,” Konstakis concluded.</p>
<p>Developed by industry experts Oliver Preston and Jonathan Smith, Multi Builder’s proprietary trading models leverage their decades-long industry experience to deliver the best-in-class algorithmic sports betting solution alongside content depth and improved margins.</p>
<p>Happy to Support OpenBet’s Expansion Strategy</p>
<p>Managing director of Multi Builder Oliver Preston also commented on the deal, expressing his excitement to become “part of OpenBet’s latest expansion strategy” and support the further development of the portfolio of “the stand-out sports technology, services and content business.”</p>
<p>“Their relentless focus on customer and player experience is second to none,” Preston continued, picturing how Multi Builder’s offering will complement OpenBet’s products and enable it “to continue providing quality, scale and depth of systems” globally.</p>
<p>“We’ve found a trusted partner in OpenBet and we can’t wait to get started,” Preston concluded.</p>
<p>For OpenBet, the acquisition would mean ownership of Multi Builder’s proprietary intellectual property and technology for several key pricing models utilized across numerous sports betting markets, including pre-match and in-play.</p>
<p>These models have already proved their effectiveness with sports betting operators and will significantly increase OpenBet’s ability to improve pricing and trading performance and its lure to future partners. Among the latest to partner with OpenBet was Czech-based Sazka Group.</p>
<p>Finally, OpenBet will have the leading sportsbook trading trainer Jonathan Smith provide training services exclusively on behalf of OpenBet as part of the acquisition of Sportsbook Training Services.</p>
