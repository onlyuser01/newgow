<p>No, not yet, though I did do some experiments today and it looks like the problem only happens when you're logged in and playing for real money. I ran the experiments on Silveredge Casino, since I had a small balance there to play with, but as we just established, but the issues are the same across Hallmark Casino, Vegas Rush, and Fun Club.</p>
<p>I imagine it has something to do with the fact that if you're playing for real money, it has to check your account, make sure the money is there, deduct it from your balance, save your balance, then to communicate with the game server, get the result of the spin, and (if necessary) add the winnings to your balance and save your balance again?</p>
<p>When playing for monopoly money, that isn't an issue and is probably all done in the game software itself.</p>
<p>For instance, when playing Saucify's blackjack, I always know when I've busted or hit 21 before I even see the result of my request to hit, because it takes a long time, which means my turn is over and now it's time for the dealer to play their hand.</p>
<p>Another, unrelated casino (This is Vegas Casino, demo mode only because I don't have a balance there.)</p>
<p>Silveredge Casino - Not Logged In (Demo Mode):</p>
<p>Silveredge Casino - Logged in/Playing for Real Money:</p>
<p>It was even worse the other night when I was playing on a weekend evening, which I suppose would be peak hours.</p>
<p>And I don't even know what's happening with the Rival slot here, this wasn't happening the other night, it just took forever to get through the spin, similar to the Saucify immediate above this video, but even longer.)</p>
