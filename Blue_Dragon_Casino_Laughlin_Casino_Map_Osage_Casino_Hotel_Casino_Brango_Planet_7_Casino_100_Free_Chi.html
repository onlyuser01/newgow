    <h1>Blue Dragon Casino Laughlin Casino Map Osage Casino Hotel Casino Brango Planet 7 Casino 100 Free Chi</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Two days ago (03-11-2020) I tried to login to Speedybet.com. I used my new bank account and I tried to add my phone number as requested. It did not work so i contacted the Live chat for further assistance. They asked me for my personal information and eventually also my phone number. As requested I gave it and the employee told me it was connected to another account. This seems right because in the past i created an account using my Rabobank card. The employee told me she would remove it from the Rabobank account and link it to my new account.</p>
<p>Once it was done I received a green light that I could sign in. I tried to sign into my ING account and everything seems to be working fine. I made a deposit of</p>
<p>€100,00 and made profit €450,00 in total. I requested a withdrawal and it was sent for approval. Yesterday I made a new deposit of €35,00 and made around €750,00. I just tried to sign in again and I was greeted with the following message: errors.locked.other.</p>
<p>I contacted Live chat again as seen below and asked what was wrong. It seems like my new account has been closed because of a self exclusion that was requested on my Rabobank account. I asked till when the request was made and she replied that the self exclusion already was created on 2019-11-05 and has already expired.</p>
<p>Since I changed banks a long time ago I did not remember the self exclusion at all. I couldn't sign in at all because i don't have access to that account anymore. So there was no way for me to regain access again.</p>
<p>So i signed in with my ING account (Keep in mind that my self exclusion was already expired at that time).</p>
<p>Now i receive a message that my withdrawals are cancelled and i will get my deposits refunded, because there was an self exclusion (That already has expired + an account that i do not have access to in any way). I honestly feel left out. The employee that changed my number from the previous account could also tell me about the self exclusion or give me more information. But now when i made a nice profit i kinda get backstabbed even though Speedybet did not communicate the current situation with me. I would like to have transparancy.</p>
<p>So since i had no way to know or regain access again i would like to have my winnings + my new account restored, The old account can stay closed because i don't have the ability to sign into that one.. I also expected it to be shutdown already. So i can continue enjoying Speedybet as i'm used to.</p>
<p>I also find it strange that they only cancel my winnings once I try to make a withdrawal. If i lost my previous bets they would probably never notice or refund the money back. (Side note: I used the same personal information etc.)</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>R</p>
