    <h1>Hamburg Gaming Casino Mohegan Sun Casino Events Springfield Casino Detroit Casino Hotels Diamond Cas</h1>

<p>These are all from the person who runs the online casino - Ray Overlay.</p>
<p>1) if you are not a Platinum level player don't count on fast withdrawals. Platinum gets priority especially if you have a casino cage withdrawal. Their system does not have a built in secure document upload feature. They use an add on which does not allow them to see the emails asking for IDs, credit cards and bank statements after they send them. If you are an out of state person that makes a deposit in error, they make you go through a difficult process just to get your money back. Customer support is not allowed to use the word refund to any player at any time. Ask for a refund and see what they say. If you get lucky and win a big jackpot, they hold your money as long as they can because they want you to cancel the withdrawal and potentially lose back what you won (this is right from Ray Overlay's mouth).</p>
<p>2) Promotions are basically a scam. Most have a 25x play through which most players can't clear. Many games that you play do not count toward clearing the bonus. If you make a deposit and opt in to a deposit bonus you don't get the bonus if your deposit is made using Paynearme or in person at the casino.</p>
<p>If you want to opt out of the 1st deposit bonus, you can't do it yourself. You have to contact them and they have to do it for you. But if you ask them how much money you get back when you opt out, they can't tell you. If you don't finish playing a bonus in 7 days, they cancel it and take your money.</p>
<p>The Fortune Wheel is possible the worst promo ever. If you win something (unusual to win anything more that 10 cents) and don't use in 24 hours, they take it back without telling you. Let's say you spin and win $1000 (highest amount you can win) in site credit, it does not get used until you lose all other money in your account. So if your balance stays above $0, they take back the $1000 site credit 24 hours later. To make sure you don't get screwed and have the money taken back, just clear an other bonuses and withdraw any and all of your cash so that the site credit is in play.</p>
<p>3) No one there can figure out any self imposed limits you may put on your account. If you have any deposit, wager, or time limits and want to know anything about them, they can't figure it out and give you some BS answer.</p>
<p>4) If you want to close your account, they don't actually close it. They just "Suspend it Pending Closure).</p>
<p>5) If you are in a slot game free spin or bonus round and it gets stuck, they can't fix it and tell you that their technical team is working on fixing it. First of all, they do not have a technical team (another BS answer). They have to contact the company that manufactures the game, then wait for them to figure out what happened. The company eventually tells them how to fix it and then they have to send it off to another company that manages their database. This incompetent database company then must fix the problem. There are times when it took over a month for them to fix my stuck game and give me the money I won. Sometimes they don't even give you all the money you should have won if the game didn't get stuck.</p>
<p>6) If you see that your account shows an "In Play" amount, they are not able to see it on their database. They have no idea how much shows as In Play on your account. I have asked them how much In Play money shows on my account and they told me $0 when I had a substantial amount listed.</p>
