<p>Sam Allardyce’s debut as the Leeds United manager couldn’t be harder – his team is taking on raging Manchester City at Etihad Stadium this coming Saturday</p>
<p>Manchester City vs Leeds is interesting for a number of reasons. First of all, the Cityzens need to keep their focus on this game even though they play in the UCL semifinal just three days later. Secondly, Sam Allardyce and his boys are bound to throw everything on defense as they’re desperate for points in order to stay in the Prem.</p>
<p>All this is guaranteed to make Man City’s job more difficult than what the EPL betting odds would suggest. Will Pep Guardiola’s team get the job done in the end?</p>

<p>Manchester City Mustn’t Stop Winning</p>
<p>Pep Guardiola’s team is without a single loss in more than three months. In fact, the Cityzens are 16-3-0 in all competitions since losing 1-0 to Tottenham on February 5. They’re also on an 8-win run in the Premier League, which has moved them all the way to the top of the table.</p>
<p>Even though only a few weeks ago they had a 15-point deficit behind Arsenal, they’re now above the Gunners. They got one point more than Arsenal, as well as one game fewer. What this means is that if they beat Leeds United on Saturday, they’re going to increase the point advantage to four points.</p>
<p>In simple terms, it would mean making one giant leap toward securing the EPL title, which in turn, would give them the freedom to focus on the holy grail of club soccer – the Champions League.</p>

<p>Their first game of the UCL semifinal doubleheader with Real Madrid is on the program on Tuesday, which is why coach Guardiola might decide to give some of his key men a break on Saturday. Erling Haaland – Premier League’s scoring leader – might not play all 90 minutes against Leeds.</p>
<p>Jack Grealish could also get some rest over the weekend, the same as Bernardo Silva. We probably also won’t see Kevin De Bruyne on the pitch as he’s still struggling with an injury. Nevertheless, even with backups, Man City looks more than capable of beating Leeds. But will it be a big win? This is something that depends not only on the Cityzens, but also on the tactic used by Leeds United’s new coach.</p>
<p>Sam Allardyce’s to “Park the Bus” on His Debut</p>
<p>Some say Sam Allardyce is the epitome of an English soccer manager. In the past, his teams were always decent at the back, with all 11 players on the pitch working hard to protect the net. Knowing this, it seems that he’s the right man for the Leeds United job.</p>
<p>"Not Pep, not Klopp, not Arteta…" ❌</p>

<p>The thing is that this team is sitting just above the relegation zone, with the same number of points as Nottingham Forest which is just below. Further, Everton – the second-from-the-bottom team – has only one point fewer than Leeds.</p>
<p>The worst thing is that Leeds United’s EPL schedule looks horrible. These guys have to play four incredibly difficult matches until the end of the season. This is why even a single point on Saturday would mean the world to them.</p>
<p>Manchester City vs Leeds Prediction</p>
<p>It took 49 minutes for Man City to break the deadlock in the game with West Ham last Wednesday. We could see something similar this time as well, especially knowing that Leeds United are guaranteed to defend with all they’ve got.</p>
<p>Half-time/Full-time Draw/Manchester City looks like an interesting proposal, but our top bet for Saturday’s game is Manchester City moneyline. This is the banker of the entire weekend in our eyes.</p>
<p>Pick: Manchester City to win</p>
