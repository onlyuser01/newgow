    <h1>Warhorse Casino Palms Casino Resort Reviews Portsmouth Casino Durant Casino Choctaw Hotel Casino Con</h1>

<p>According to Brooklyn’s Community Board 13, a gambling establishment would conflict with the area’s reputation for family-friendly entertainment and exacerbate its existing challenges. The consortium behind the project attempted to alleviate concerns, calling the Board’s actions premature. However, limited New York licenses mean the project may never get off the ground regardless of locals’ opinions.</p>
<p>The Boardwalk May Receive a Shiny New Casino</p>
<p>The $3 billion casino project is the brainchild of a consortium of several gambling holdings, including Global Gaming Solutions (GGS), Legends Global Planning, and Saratoga Casino Holdings. Real estate investment company Thor Equities is the driving force behind the venture. All members have in-depth industry knowledge and are willing to compete with other market leaders for the limited New York licenses.</p>
<p>“The Coney Island Casino Resort &amp; Resort Entertainment District Brooklyn” project envisions a new Las Vegas-style entertainment and hotel establishment with all the amenities expected of a project on such a scale. The consortium has already released renderings of the planned buildings, hoping to win over the local community with promises of job opportunities, economic growth, and lasting prosperity.</p>
<p>Local Leaders Urged Officials to Reject the Project</p>
<p>Despite the developers’ best efforts, the Coney Islanders’ response has been far from positive. Community Board 13, the main body representing the area’s residents, overwhelmingly voted against the project, with 23 to eight opposing the construction. Although the Board’s decision does not carry any legislative weight, their opinions usually hold sway with the local officials who will have the final word.</p>
<p>Brooklyn Councilman Ari Kagan supported the decision to oppose the casino project. He agreed that a high-profile gambling establishment would cause a spike in crime and mental health problems while exacerbating the area’s growing traffic congestion. According to the Board, the casino threatened to turn Coney Island into another Atlantic City, bringing all the gambling industry’s negatives to a struggling neighborhood.</p>
<p>Our community cannot endure the substantial burden and problems that this venue will generate. Community Board 13 resolution</p>
<p>Consortium representatives quickly replied, criticizing the Board for their hasty decision. Officials claim to have gathered over 3,300 signatures supporting the project, noting that any criticisms were meaningless before its full reveal. Officials also added that a high-profile casino would bolster employment, revitalize the local economy and help the surrounding small businesses.</p>
<p>Any judgments about this project … before the full details are realized… leaves the community struggling with the very same issues… it currently bemoans. Consortium statement regarding the Community Board 13 vote</p>
<p>Despite the Coney Island community’s growing concerns, the consortium’s project may never get off the ground. New York will grant only three full casino licenses, with high-profile operators like Bally’s, MGM Resorts, the Seminole tribe, Wynn Resorts, and Caesars Entertainment struggling to offer the best project. Since two spots will likely go to developed properties, the Coney Islanders’ gambling woes may resolve themselves.</p>
