    <h1>Rivers Casino Restaurants 888 Casino Nj Hollywood Casino And Hotel St Louis Casinos In West Virginia</h1>

<p>The software is set to take everything from the player... i deposited a few times and tried a system that i always play regarding roulette and small series.i have watched roulette and the numbers a few days to see how it plays and how much it gives small series of course. But once i start playing its tottally different, as i lose straight from the first entry. Today i lost 100e in 10 min as it gave me on the first number and then didnt give at all until i lost the money. I mean we all know casinos are set to make money but 100% for the casino and 0% for the player is not how its supposed to be. I will try one more time to see if this happens again, but i think it will.</p>
