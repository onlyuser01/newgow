    <h1>Grand Casino Shawnee Sloto Stars Casino Top Rated Online Casinos Arizona Charlie S Casino In Las Veg</h1>

<p>I verified my account and withdrew last week. This week I have requested to withdraw. First I am asked to send verification for a different card to that verified already - I explain that the card was a digitless card. They told me to send a bank statement which I did. The then rejected this and said that it needs to have the card digits on the statement somewhere - I contacted my bank and they said they do not do this, they advised showing the individual transaction to the company on my banking app showing which card was used. I sent this &amp; a screen shot from my bank saying this. In the bank statement sent you can see payment made to rolletto. They then ask me to re-verify the old payment method again. Which I do. Again. Then I’m told it has to be februarys bank statement, that januarys is not acceptable - we are all aware that you can not receive a bank statement for a month that hasn’t ended. It all is just very unreasonable. Also, every time I await a response my emails are either ignored or not responded to for a long period of time. Each time I contact live chat I am told something different.</p>
