    <h1>Monte Carlo Resort And Casino Best Usa Bitcoin Casino No Deposit Bonus Movenpick Hotel Casino Cairo</h1>

<p>The verification process has been going since December 24th. I can't really tell you what documents have been approved and what ones have not because I keep getting mixed and confusing answers about what they have and what they don't have or what I should do and what I haven't done that is why I feel like I'm being given the runaround. But what I can tell you is what you need to do is pretty lengthy and the steps are for using a no deposit bonus: 1- obviously satisfy the playthrough requirement, 2- deposit $25, 3- Wager $25 x1, 4- complete phone call verification with support staff member, 5- send your documents such as identification card or driver's license front and back, a proof of address such as utility bill or other bill, and also a withdrawal application form with your basic information and any credit card information you may have used to deposit. (I used crypto deposit and told them this numerous times as well as inform them I don't own or have a credit card). I can tell you that I satisfied the playthrough requirements, I deposited the $25, I wagered the $25, and I completed the phone call verification with the support staff member and at the end of the call she said my account was fully verified. Before during and after these steps I was sending emails back and forth (some of which I have sent to you) also in closing pictures of my identification card front and back as well as my utility bill and the withdrawal application form. I also have stated in these emails that I do not own or have a credit card and that I used krypto to deposit and I would like to process a crypto withdrawal. I specified the amount of the withdrawal as well as gave them my Bitcoin address. Other than that all I can say is that it's been very confusing extremely frustrating and drawn out process with multiple different answers from multiple different people. I have gotten replies saying that now I need to do this or now I need to do that which I then in turn did. Then I have some emails where they say I didn't send certain documents which I did. It's all just been crazy and frustrating but I have done everything and sent everything 100% completely on my end.</p>
