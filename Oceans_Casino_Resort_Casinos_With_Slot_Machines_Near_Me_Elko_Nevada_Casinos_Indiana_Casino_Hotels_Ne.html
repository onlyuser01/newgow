<p>Dear Stefan,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m very sorry to hear about your negative experience. I checked the Responsible Gambling section and I found this:</p>
<p>"One of the most effective ways to deal with gambling abuse is self-exclusion. This process allows you to completely manage your gambling process at Dogsfortune. Every player can use the self-exclusion function, however, it is most helpful for the players that might damage their finances by engaging in gambling activities.</p>
<p>Self-exclusion gives you an opportunity to completely manage your casino account for:</p>
<p>A specific amount of time is dictated by the player.</p>
<p>Restrict access to specific casino content.</p>
<p>Restrict access to the whole casino.</p>
<p>Requesting self-exclusion is quite easy and fast. You just simply go to the live chat and request self-exclusion with the operator and he or she will assist you.</p>
<p>After requesting the self-exclusion, the account of the player will be suspended and the player won’t be able to access the account with his or her original password.</p>
<p>After requesting the self-exclusion, it is vital that the player does not do any of the following:</p>
<p>Creating a new account</p>
<p>Requesting to reopen already excluded account</p>
<p>Requesting the removal of any restrictions on account</p>
<p>Providing fake and untrue information in order to bypass the self-exclusion process</p>
<p>Dogsfortune will not be liable in case a player uses fake information to bypass the self-exclusion process."</p>
<p>Could you please forward me your self-exclusion request together with any other relevant communication between you and the casino? My email address is kristina.s@casino.guru.</p>
<p>Also, do I understand correctly that you deposited kr30,000 (dispute value) since you sent the first self-exclusion request?</p>
<p>I will be waiting for your reply patiently.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Kristina</p>
