<p>Gamingtec spokesperson noted that diverse content is what helps the platform provider stand ahead of its many competitors</p>
<p>Apollo Games, a leading slot provider of premium gaming solutions, has agreed to power Gamingtec’s market-leading lineup of games with new titles. The partnership is expected to take the turnkey online casino and sportsbook platform provider’s portfolio “into the stratosphere.”</p>
<p>As per the deal, Apollo Games will supply Gamingtec with a selection of critically-acclaimed games, including hits like Midnight Fruits 81, Bonus Joker II and Rich Kittens. These titles are now available to operators powered by Gamingtec’s famous GT Casino platform.</p>
<p>What makes this integration so special is the quality of Apollo Games’ titles. The studio is known for producing games with unparalleled graphics, animations and sound design. The gameplay of Apollo’s slots is just as exciting as the graphics are beautiful, ensuring that players are always at the edge of their seats when playing.</p>
<p>Apollo is also renowned for its innovative jackpot slots. Each title comes hooked up to the Apollo Jackpot system, providing lucky players with a shot at life-changing wins. The jackpot win is completely random and is not impacted by bet size or winning bets.</p>
<p>The new integration will help Gamingtec cement itself as the go-to platform for gambling companies looking for a rich selection of flexible and localizable titles.</p>
<p>Content Is the Key to Differentiation</p>
<p>Andrei Beu, Gamingtec’s commercial director, commented on the agreement, saying that varied content is really important to operators that want to have an edge over their competitors. Because of that, Gamingtec seeks to offer a plethora of games to its partners, helping them in terms of differentiation.</p>
<p>Because of that, Gamingtec’s content hub now boasts over 10,000 slots from industry-leading providers. Beu noted that he is happy to add Apollo Games content to Gamingtec.</p>
<p>Apollo Games is a great addition to our offering. Its games stand out in any operator lobby and its innovative jackpot feature means high levels of anticipation and excitement with each spin – who knows when the jackpot will trigger and a life-changing win will land? Andrei Beu, commercial director, Gamingtec</p>
<p>Beu concluded that integrations like this one help Gamingtec remain one step ahead of other platform providers.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Robert Mikudik, Apollo Games’ head of commercial for iGaming, praised Gamingtec for working with many of the biggest iGaming brands in Europe, Africa, LATAM and elsewhere.</p>
<p>This partnership really does open the door to more quality operators than ever before we can’t wait to see their players experience the thrills our slots provide Robert Mikudik, head of commercial for iGaming, Apollo Games</p>
<p>Last month, Gamingtec also signed a similar content agreement with Fugaso.</p>
