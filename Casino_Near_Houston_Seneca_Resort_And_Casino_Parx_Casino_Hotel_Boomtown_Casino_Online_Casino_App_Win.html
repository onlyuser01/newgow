    <h1>Casino Near Houston Seneca Resort And Casino Parx Casino Hotel Boomtown Casino Online Casino App Win</h1>

<p>Wind Creek Hospitality has agreed to acquire Magic City Casino in Miami and strengthen its footprint in the US land-based gaming market</p>
<p>The announcement has come after the Florida Gaming Control Commission has given the green light for the transfer of all assets and gaming licenses held by the casino’s current owners to the authority of the Poarch Band of Creek Indians. The latter is the only Indian Tribe in Alabama recognized by the federal authorities.</p>
<p>More Expansion Opportunities</p>
<p>According to the newly inked agreement, Wind Creek Hospitality’s wholly-owned subsidiary Gretna Racing, LLC will be extending its presence in another big metropolitan area in the US by penetrating the Miami, Florida market with its land-based games.</p>
<p>Wind Creek parent Poarch Band of Creek Indians’ chief executive officer and tribal Stephanie Bryan called their expansion in Illinois, Pennsylvania, and Florida in recent news will bring the tribe more growth chances. Bryan also spoke about their excitement to become a “valued partner in the Miami community.”</p>
<p>Thanks to the fresh brick-and-mortar facility in Miami, Wind Creek Hospitality will enjoy the perks of joining a “new and vibrant market”.</p>
<p>What the Future Holds</p>
<p>The organization that manages the tribe’s gaming facilities has announced that it will not disrupt operations at Magic City Casino in the near future. At the same time, they announced they would make a few changes to the venue. Among them, is the inclusion of Magic City players in the Wind Creek Rewards and Express Offers loyalty programs by the end of the current year.</p>
<p>As stated by Wind Creek’s chief executive officer and president Jay Dorris, Southern Florida is naturally connected to their properties in the Florida Panhandle, Aruba &amp; Curacao, and Alabama. Dorris added that the casino’s location next to the International Airport in Miami turns it into an excellent place for players at all Wind Creek properties.</p>
<p>At the moment, Wind Creek Hospitality is responsible for managing Wind Creek Chicago Southland, a 70,000-square-foot casino hosting 1,350 slot machines and 56 table games expected to attract 800 jobs in the south suburban area.</p>
<p>The organization also manages the Aruba, Bethlehem, Atmore, Curacao, Montgomery, and Wetumpka venues, along with Nevada’s Wa She Shu Casino location, the racetracks in Florida, Alabama and Casinoverse, which is Wind Creek’s new fantasy gaming app.</p>
<p>The group that tries to turn guests’ mundane lives into a fantasy universe packed with games and engaging entertainment inked a multi-year partnership with the Chicago Bulls, agreeing to give the teams’ fans an enhanced experience at the new East Hazel Crest &amp; Homewood casino.</p>
