    <h1>Nyny Casino Ultra Panda Online Casino Casinos In Georgia Ozwin Casino Login Parking At Treasure Isla</h1>

<p>The Ohio Casino Control Commission has announced a massive drop to $639 million in sports betting wagers recorded in the state</p>
<p>Last month, we announced that Ohio reached $1.1 billion in total sports gambling wagers in January, an impressive figure for the first month when the Buckeye State officially embraced sports betting.</p>
<p>The second report from the Ohio Casino Control Commission issued at the end of last week has revealed that the earnings recorded by brick-and-mortar sportsbooks and mobile betting apps in February faced a dramatic dip compared to the previous month.</p>
<p>Ohioans who are allowed to bet on online or mobile platforms in land casinos, racinos, and kiosks with smaller retailers wagered $639 million on sports. This sent a total net tax revenue of $8.3 million to the state’s coffers, compared to January’s $21 million.</p>
<p>While bets on mobile betting apps and land-based sportsbooks dropped, kiosks located in bars recorded a larger number of users. Let’s take a closer look at the Ohio Casino Control Commission’s freshest report to learn more.</p>
<p>$562 Million in Real Cash Bets Via Mobile Apps</p>
<p>In February, the people of Ohio placed approximately $621 million in bets on the state’s 17 apps that accept mobile bets on sports. The number shows a significant decrease from the $1.09 billion recorded in January, despite the release of the brand new BetParx app in February.</p>
<p>In January, promotional credit deals attracted around $320 million in promotional bets and betting credits. This led to sports betting apps only taking $770 million in real cash bets. By comparison, Ohioans relied on 82% fewer promotion credits ($59 million) compared to January, which means the available mobile apps accepted around $562 million in real cash bets.</p>
<p>Betting apps generated $82 million in taxable revenue for February, also marking a drop from the $205 million figure recorded in January. In terms of winning payouts, the mobile apps paid out $536 million, compared to $864 million in the previous month.</p>
<p>According to data from the casino and Lottery commission, brick-and-mortar sportsbooks and gaming kiosks did not hand out any promotional credits in February.</p>
<p>Brick-and-Mortar Bets Also Dropped in February</p>
<p>Drops in bets placed were also noticed for land sportsbooks located inside casinos, racinos, and various other locations. Ohio’s 14 brick-and-mortar sportsbooks including JACK Cleveland Casino and MGM Northfield Park generated $17.7 million in bets, signaling a $23 million drop from the January figures.</p>
<p>Together, these venues reported a little over $1 million in taxable revenue, down $2.2 million from January’s number.</p>
<p>Land facilities paid out $16.6 million in winnings, again reporting a $19.5 million drop compared to the first month when sports betting became officially available in the Buckeye State.</p>
<p>Betting kiosks’ paid out $910,000 in winnings in February, marking a 34% increase compared to the $722,000 figure reported in January, thus signaling a revenue drop of 46% in revenue from $116,000 in January to $62,000 in February.</p>
<p>At the same time, the kiosks reported $973,000 in total bets, up 14% from January, despite an increased number of businesses that hosted these kiosks in February compared to January, from 772 to 866.</p>
<p>By mid-March, Ohio’s gambling regulator had issued $1 million in penalties since the opening of the sports betting market, including a $150,000 fine issued to BetMGM by the state’s watchdog.</p>
