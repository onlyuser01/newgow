    <h1>Airway Heights Casino Seminole Hard Rock Casino Tampa Florida Viejas Casino Buffet Lucky Lands Casin</h1>

<p>Good day</p>
<p>Thank you for your message. Either my messages have not been carefully read and studied, or I have expressed myself unclearly.</p>
<p>I know that I am not entitled to a refund of my deposits as it is my responsibility whether I am allowed to play in my country or not. That is not the problem. But I have said that clearly.</p>
<p>My complaint was (I repeat it again): I am complaining about paragraph 8.6 of the Fresh-Casino T&amp;C and I believe that this paragraph violates the license terms of the licensor. I do not accept that my complaint will be rejected on the grounds that I am not allowed to file a complaint.</p>
<p>I also sent a screenshot where Fresh-Casino confirms that they are not allowed to claim back already deposited funds under any circumstances. Not even when it comes to complaints other than mine. 1. The player has no right to claim back any money. Under no circumstances.</p>
<ol>
<li>If he is still right and gets money back, then this money must be returned to the casino.</li>
</ol>
<p>I repeat my questions and requests again.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>How does Casino Guru view Article 8.6 of the T&amp;C? Casino Guru has given the casino a perfect reputation and declared the T&amp;C to be flawless.Unfortunately you did not respond to this question.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Violates the terms of the licensor?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I kindly asked if you could send me the Antillephone license agreement. Unfortunately, you did not respond to this request either.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I believe that every player should have the right to file a complaint and get money back if the casino has done something wrong (e.g. breaching RG policy) and not have to return the money if the ADR/licensor agrees with the player are.</p>
<p>Once again my complaint: I am of the opinion that the casino has violated the license terms with paragraph 8.6 and this paragraph is not only unfair, but also illegal. I therefore demand the invalidity of my contract with the Casion and the deposits back.</p>
<p>I really ask you to read my messages and screenshots more carefully, even though I know you have very little time per complaint.</p>
<p>I really hoped that Casino Guru would be glad that I drew attention to this paragraph 8.6. If you don't have time, I ask you to give the complaint to a colleague.</p>
<p>Best regards</p>
<p>Dario</p>
