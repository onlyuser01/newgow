<p>BeyondPlay and Casumo have partnered for the launch of Casumo Jackpots, a multiplayer-oriented casino product</p>
<p>After appointing David VanEgmond as its new board director earlier in May, the business-to-business start-up that creates next-gen software for iGaming operators has now announced the launch of a multiplayer-oriented product together with Casumo.</p>
<p>The Partnership, “The Beginning of a Promising Journey”</p>
<p>The product is just the first in a line of much-anticipated products created alongside the popular online casino and sportsbook operator.</p>
<p>The provider that aims to redesign the future of online gaming “by redefining how people play” has made its Jackpot Management Software live in all of Casumo’s main markets, displaying an exclusive progressive jackpot with four levels on top of selected casino games.</p>
<p>BeyondPlay’s chief operating officer Jacqui Gatt expressed their thrill to be able to announce the pioneering launch of their Jackpot product along with the leading operator.</p>
<p>Gatt further spoke about the tireless work put in by their team to create the product and put it on the market, as well as to make sure that it will add more value “to the business and players alike.”</p>
<p>The COO also called the partnership one that “marks the beginning of a promising journey,” while expressing their excitement about delivering even more similarly exciting projects in the upcoming years.</p>
<p>Finally, Gatt took the opportunity to express gratitude to Casumo for the “unwavering support” and also for believing in them from the start.</p>
<p>Casumo, Delighted to Launch the New-Look Casumo Jackpot Product</p>
<p>Casumo’s chief product officer, Mark Busuttil, also expressed delight to collaborate with BeyondPlay for the launch of the “new-look Casumo Jackpots”, mentioning the seamless integration that has been successfully used during the complex process.</p>
<p>Casumo used BeyondPlay’s jackpot software to create the exclusive in-house jackpots, customizing the new Casumo Jackpots product according to its exact vision and requirements.</p>
<p>Busuttil also expressed Casumo’s intention to keep a strong focus on constantly innovating and offering players the best possible jackpot products out there.</p>
<p>Finally, the CPO thanked BeyondPlay for all the hard work invested in creating and launching the new product while expressing excitement regarding the future of their partnership in the long run.</p>
<p>More operators are expected to use BeyondPlay’s Jackpot Management Software as a robust and highly flexible solution that will help them stick their heads out of the sea of competitors by offering unparalleled and elevating experiences to players.</p>
<p>In April, BeyondPlay announced that it secured $5.5 million in its latest funding round. A few months earlier, in December 2022, the provider was granted a business-to-business supply license from the Malta Gaming Authority.</p>
