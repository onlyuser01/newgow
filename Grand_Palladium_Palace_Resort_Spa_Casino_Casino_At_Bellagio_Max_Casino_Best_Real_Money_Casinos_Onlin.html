    <h1>Grand Palladium Palace Resort Spa Casino Casino At Bellagio Max Casino Best Real Money Casinos Onlin</h1>

<p>Dear Ana90,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. I’m sure that you are aware of the geolocation of DGOJ operation:</p>
<p>"What is self-prohibition?</p>
<p>If you have a problem with gambling, you can register in the Register of Gambling Access Bans (RGIAJ) of the Directorate-General for Gambling’s Regulation (DGOJ). It is registration with self-prohibition in gambling halls that require a prior registration to play, which includes the different operators that act legally in Spain. Anyone can request their inclusion in the RGIAJ, which will prevent them from browsing online gambling operators’ pages."</p>
<p>Since you have chosen a casino with Curaçao license, it will be very difficult to resolve this case to your satisfaction. However, before we’ll contact the casino and ask for their standpoint, could you please forward emails or screenshots showing that you have sent requests for your account’s closure. My email address is petronela.k@casino.guru. Did you specify in those requests for how long you wish your account to be closed and clearly stated the reason why?</p>
<p>I have checked general terms and conditions on the website, and this is what I found https://www.uniquecasino.com/en/:</p>
<p>„We respect and encourage self-control and self-imposed avoidance of gambling. To this end we give you the option of taking a break from gambling on the Website for your chosen time frame of day/week/month, per your request. During this period, you will not be able to access games or deposit/bet/wager in any way.</p>
<p>You can choose to close your Account for an indefinite period of time, in which case we will remove you from our mailing lists. Once closed, you may contact us and request to re-open your Account in the future. We may treat any such request as a request to open a new Account, and we may request that you once again provide any information you have already provided to us.</p>
<p>We will encourage you and assist you in your efforts of self-exclusion or imposing of limits and stop sending you marketing materials. However, we cannot prevent gambling/receiving marketing material being delivered to you from other parties, casinos or websites, therefore extending your self-exclusion/limitation action to all other gambling services is solely your responsibility."</p>
<p>Is this the email address that you have sent your email to? support@uniquecasino.com</p>
<p>I hope we will be able to help you to resolve this issue as soon as possible. Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
