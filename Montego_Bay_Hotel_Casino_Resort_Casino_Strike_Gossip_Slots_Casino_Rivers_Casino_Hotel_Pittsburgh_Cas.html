    <h1>Montego Bay Hotel Casino Resort Casino Strike Gossip Slots Casino Rivers Casino Hotel Pittsburgh Cas</h1>

<p>hi, I joined the Vegas Wild Casino, taking advantage of the no deposit bonus by winning 210 euros, requesting a withdrawal, sending all the verification documents and depositing as per the rules, all approved and ok, but today I can't find my deposit of 25 since I don't have it still played, and I receive an approved withdrawal email for 75 euros, I ask for clarification in live chat but they don't explain the reason for the removal, only that the 25 have been returned, I am quite an expert in casinos and I ask for clarification what time is the no deposit bonus was maximum withdrawal 50, if yes we agree but it doesn't seem to me that it was in the terms of the bonus but what time it was, what does it have to do with returning the deposit not played to date? can't play after 3 4 days etc pending withdrawal of a bonus? if so, it's a bit strange as a method, however if so, where is it written in the terms and conditions that it doesn't exist? then I press and I will lengthen it not by 160 less if the rule is that God forbid but other platforms subtract directly from the release. I say what they leave him to make a withdrawable fund up even all withdrawals? can't they make sure that only the withdrawable one can be cashed in and maybe it's enough to subtract it from the withdrawal operation without leaving higher funds imprinted, I repeat until the last operation? I would like a clarification to these 160 euros less winnings, and the return of my deposit together with the withdrawal with your help, thanks in advance.</p>
