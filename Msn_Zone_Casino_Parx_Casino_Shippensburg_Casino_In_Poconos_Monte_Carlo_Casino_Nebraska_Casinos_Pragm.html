<p>Pragmatic Play said that players can be looking forward to the “largest prize pool in the industry“ and better gaming experiences</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play, a leading iGaming content supplier, has announced that it will be doubling the annual prize pool of its popular Drops &amp; Wins event. This year, the total prize pool will be a whopping €30,000,000 (around $33,000,000), the company said.</p>
<p>Drops &amp; Wins is an annual promotion that takes entertainment in mind and channels Pragmatic Play’s energy and resources into an initiative where players can win extra prizes when playing their favorite slots or participating in tournaments. The company has been running Drops &amp; Wins since 2020, with the initiative proving to be a resounding success.</p>
<p>In addition to doubling the total budget, Pragmatic Play announced that players will have the chance to win bigger than ever before when playing one of the game’s slots or live casino games.</p>
<p>Players can be looking forward to the largest prize pool in the industry and an enhanced gaming experience with our new promotional mechanics. Pragmatic Play statement</p>
<p>The impressive prize pool means that a staggering €2,000,000 can now be won every month. Meanwhile, a monthly prize pool of €500,000 will be available across the company’s best live casino titles.</p>
<p>Drops &amp; Wins Will Engage Players at No Added Cost</p>
<p>In addition to winning Daily Prize Drops, players will be able to compete against their peers. The top players in Pragmatic Play’s daily and weekly tournaments will earn extra prizes depending on their position on the leaderboard.</p>
<p>Drops &amp; Wins will run from April 5, 2023, to March 6, 2024, providing players with a full year of exciting prizes. The company is excited to renew the initiative as attested by Irina Cornides, Pragmatic Play’s chief operating officer.</p>
<p>Cornides pointed out that the prize pool of €30,000,000 is entirely funded by the provider and is the largest of its kind. The best thing for operators is that there are no added integration costs to take part in Drops &amp; Wins. The initiative, Cornides added, will help Pragmatic Play’s partners inspire loyalty among their players.</p>
<p>And with no extra cost or additional integration required to take part, we couldn’t have made it easier for our partners to boost player acquisition, engagement, and retention through Drops &amp; Wins. Irina Cornides, COO, Pragmatic Play</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play continues to boast a robust pipeline, producing several new slots each month. The company’s products are growing more and more popular among operators, as proven by the recent agreements the provider has been signing.</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play just expanded its presence in Brazil via a deal with Win Prêmios. Previously, the company launched some of its games with Swiss Casinos.</p>
