<p>The Las Vegas boulevard is receiving an upgrade as a golf attraction named ‘Atomic Range’ will open up right beside the STRAT casino resort. This attraction costs $70 million, has four stories and will occupy a space of seven acres.</p>
<p>STRAT Hotel, Casino &amp; SkyPod owner, Golden Entertainment, announced the news Monday and stated that the attraction will occupy an area of 92,000 square feet. Additionally, it will feature 103 hitting bays on several levels and thus, it will bring something unique to downtown’s edge. This venue is expected to attract more visitors to the STRAT.</p>
<p>Atomic Range Designed for All Golfers</p>
<p>This new golf attraction will suit the needs of all golfers, regardless of their skill. Construction is set to begin at the start of 2022, most likely spring, and early projections state that the project will be finished by the end of 2023. The total number of jobs expected to be available once complete is 500.</p>
<p>Charles Protell, Golden Entertainment’s CEO and president, shared a few words on the ground-breaking project. He stated that the company is excited to be able to provide a new golf experience at not just the STRAT, but also to downtown visitors, North Strip guests, convention attendees, and locals from Las Vegas.</p>
<p>Atomic Range marks a partnership between Golden Entertainment and Flite Golf &amp; Entertainment. It will be built north of the STRAT. As stated in a news release, Flite Golf has teamed up with Century Golf, a company that has managed over 500 golf facilities around the world.</p>
<p>Las Vegas is On the Road to Recovery</p>
<p>The pandemic forced many facilities in Las Vegas to close shop and the consequences were almost devastating. As a city that is known as the gambling center in North America, the number of tourists declined rapidly due to the fact that the biggest attractions – its casinos, were shut down.</p>
<p>However, the city is on the road to recovery, as shown by the numbers. July was the most successful month since COVID-19 hit Sin City. Over 3.3 million visitors were registered and the total state revenue was $1.35 billion. Just to compare, June resulted in a $1.19 billion revenue and May had $1.23 billion revenue.</p>
<p>What’s even more impressive is the fact that the Las Vegas Strip reported a total of $625 million in revenue. Nevada recorded its sixth consecutive month where the state revenue exceeds $1 billion, which is a very good sign for the gambling operators in this region. Visitors have quickly welcomed casino re-openings, which is why numerous records that were over a decade old were easily shattered.</p>
