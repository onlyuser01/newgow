<p>The Casino Association of New Jersey (CANJ) has named Ocean Casino Resort CEO Terry Glebocki, its new president.</p>
<p>Terry Glebocki Is the New President of CANJ</p>
<p>The Casino Association of New Jersey (CANJ) has named its new president, Terry Glebocki, a veteran in the industry and CEO of Ocean Casino Resort. The news of her succession of Steve Callender follows his retiring announcement back in March. CANJ represents Atlantic City’s 9 casinos. Its members have now appointed Glebocki to become the president of the group. She is also the first female head of the organization.</p>
<p>Glebocki said that she is honored to take over the position after Steve Callender, who successfully led the organization through the pandemic.</p>
<p>Glebocki has more than 3 decades of experience in Atlantic City, dating back to 1987 when she was an assistant controller of the Bally’s Grand, which later became Atlantic City Hilton, and after that Atlantic Club. In 1991 she joined former president Donald Trump’s Entertainment Resorts and became the VP of finance of the casino operator.</p>
<p>In 2007, she joined the Revel Entertainment Group, which closed in 2014 due to bankruptcy. After that, Glebocki worked as executive vise president of Tropicana Entertainment. In 2018 Revel reopened again as Ocean, and in 2019 Glebocki became its CFO. Owned by Luxor Capital, Ocean named her CEO a year after.</p>

<p>In March, he commented on his retirement and stated that he had just graduated from college back then, and 10,000 people were applying for 500 jobs at that time.</p>
<p>Callender said: “I was lucky enough to be selected, and they taught me how to deal. It was the first craps game I had ever seen, and I was dealing it.”</p>
<p>During the 43 years of his spectacular career, he worked his way up to oversee the biggest casino resorts emerge and evolve in Atlantic City. Callender has been in the business for decades, and his retirement is big news for the industry in New Jersey.</p>
<p>His most recent position was that of a regional president of the new Ceasers Entertainment, which operates Harrah’s, Tropicana, and Ceasers in Atlantic City. Caesars Entertainment recently announced it would invest in Atlantic City, intending to make gambling popular in the city once again. The company will upgrade its Ceasers Atlantic City and Harrah’s Resort Atlantic City, as some of the</p>
