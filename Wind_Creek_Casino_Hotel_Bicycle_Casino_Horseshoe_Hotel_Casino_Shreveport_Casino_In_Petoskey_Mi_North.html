<p>Global sportsbook operator Tipico announced the launch of a marketing partnership with AEG Presents to become the exclusive sponsor of owned and operated by the live entertainment company music venues in Ohio and the surrounding area.</p>
<p>Massive Concert Tickets Giveaway</p>
<p>Brokered by AEG Global Partnerships, the first-of-its-kind strategic partnership between Tipico and AEG Presents begins with a massive giveaway program, offering $10,000 worth of tickets for upcoming concerts in December at the participating venues, including KEMBA Live!, Newport Music Hall, A&amp;R Music Bar, The Basement and the Agora Theatre &amp; Ballroom.</p>
<p>Commenting on the partnership, Adrian Vela, chief executive officer of Tipico North America, explained why the sportsbook operator decided to team with AEG Presents.</p>
<p>“Our research revealed that our customers are almost as passionate about attending concerts and music festivals as they are about watching and betting on their favorite sports,” he said, announcing that new Tipico customers will be offered “exclusive benefits” at the participating venues.</p>
<p>To attract Ohioans, Tipico is offering every customer who makes a qualifying first deposit a chance to win two tickets to a concert of their choice next year, on top of the standard first-deposit bonus.</p>
<p>Andrew Klein, managing director at AEG Global Partnerships, welcomed Tipico as the exclusive sponsor in the sportsbook category at the company’s music venues in Ohio, convinced that the new partnership will prove successful and to the benefit of all parties.</p>
<p>“Together, we look forward to continuing to bring unparalleled live music and entertainment experiences as well as unique on-site perks to the local residents we both serve across the Ohio region,” Klein concluded.</p>
<p>Presenting Partner of ‘Best Bet Concert Series’</p>
<p>Also under the partnership, Tipico will become a presenting partner of a series of 32 select concerts across the venues annually, titled “Best Bet Concert Series,” to gain the opportunity to engage with the concert guests via custom on-site activations and special promotions.</p>
<p>In collaboration with AEG Presents, Tipico will engage with its customers at each venue by offering them unique benefits and special offers, including sweepstakes, VIP concert ticket giveaways, food and beverage items giveaways and others.</p>
<p>The strategic partnership, which made Tipico the first-ever AEG Presents partner in the sportsbook space at its music venues is expected to help the sportsbook operator increase its brand awareness among new fan bases in Ohio and reward existing customers with exclusive access to live music and entertainment events.</p>
<p>The partnership with AEG Presents is the latest Tipico initiative in Ohio ahead of the official sports betting market launch on New Year’s Day, following the launch of its free-to-play game last month.</p>
