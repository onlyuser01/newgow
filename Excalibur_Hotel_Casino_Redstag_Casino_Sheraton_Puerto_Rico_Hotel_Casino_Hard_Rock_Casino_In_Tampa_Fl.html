<p>HungryBear Gaming has released an exclusive sports betting format of its iconic Slot Masters game for Entain’s Ladbrokes</p>
<p>HungryBear Gaming, the UK-based game design and development company with expertise in producing casino games that use HTML5, has announced the release of a custom variant of its iconic Slot Masters game for the Ladbrokes brand.</p>
<p>In August, the latter announced it would offer British fans free tickets to comedy shows and music festivals via Ladbrokes LIVE.</p>
<p>The bespoke multiplayer game that is promoted under the name “Clash of the Day” was given a sports betting outlook by the studio that has found its inspiration in traditional video games including Minecraft and Fortnite.</p>
<p>The new release uses the same type of free-to-play tournament mechanics that turned the Slot Masters, the pioneer multiplayer slot sensation worldwide, into a mesmerizing game for the company’s “colossal player base of over one million”.</p>
<p>Fresh Tactics to Climb the Leaderboard</p>
<p>Fully adapted to attract soccer fans from the UK, Clash of the Day will allow Entain’s customers to engage in head-to-head competitions with other players in an attempt to grab a rich selection of prizes, free spins and free bets included.</p>
<p>Users are given the opportunity to pick their preferred Premier League club or rely on the operator’s dedicated Fanzone FC and start collecting sufficient points to go higher on the leaderboard during promotional periods.</p>
<p>One thing that makes the fresh sportsbook version of the game stand out from the original is the way players are allowed to use various tactics to beat their competitors. The list features the VAR option that enables players to freeze their opponents’ reels for a limited time and the Tackle tactic that lets players cut off half of their opponents’ balance.</p>
<p>Other options include Red Card, where players can grab all of their opponents’ funds and Wall, the tactic that helps players defend against all attacks initiated by fellow players for a predefined period of time.</p>
<p>The Release, “A Key Milestone” for HungryBear Gaming and Slots Masters</p>
<p>According to HungryBear Gaming’s chief executive officer, Justin Chamberlain, the fresh release of Clash of the Day via Entain and Ladbrokes represents “an important moment” that proves the potential of the game’s model.</p>
<p>The CEO expressed their pride in carrying their partnership with Ladbrokes to the next level. The operator, which is a market leader in retail bookmaking in a number of markets including the UK, Ireland, Belgium, and Spain, was one of the first to show support for the initial concept behind the multiplayer game.</p>
<p>Chamberlain also spoke about the way the new game will offer online casinos and sportsbooks “an efficient and fun way to further engage players” by fulfilling operators’ demands and directly interacting with player bases beyond the slots-focused public.</p>
<p>Upon its release, the original Slot Masters game attracted a massive 38,000 players, instantly turning into a fan-favorite.</p>
<p>In July, HungryBear Gaming announced it would design and develop Slot Masters experiences inspired by Blueprint Gaming’s IPs. Last month, the studio said it would design a branded Slots Masters product for Novibet.</p>
