<p>The fourth-largest jackpot survived the latest drawing and is expected to be some $835 million for the draw scheduled for Wednesday</p>
<p>The jackpot from Powerball, Americaâ€™s favorite lottery, survived its 29th consecutive drawing on Monday night. The last time the grand prize dropped was back in July when a lucky ticket holder hit the staggering $1.08 billion jackpot. Now, nearly 30 drawings later, the grand prize continues to grow, surpassing $800 million.</p>
<p>Currently, the Powerball jackpot is expected to be approximately $835 million for the upcoming drawing set for Wednesday. This is an option with annual installments, while its cash sum value is expected to be $390.4 million, which is undoubtedly a life-changing grand prize.</p>
<p>The growing jackpot now represents the second-largest for the year and the fourth-largest overall. Notably, multiple mouth-watering jackpots dropped over the last year alone. In addition to the billion-dollar grand prize from July, back in February, a lucky ticket holder hit a $754.6 million jackpot.</p>
<p>On the other hand, last year in November, the largest-ever jackpot from Powerball dropped, a staggering $2.04 billion. The largest prize was hit by a single ticket of a lucky winner from California.</p>
<p>Drawings of Powerball are broadcast live on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays from its Florida Lottery Draw Studio located in Tallahassee. The tickets for the lottery game are $2, while an extra $1 per play allows the players to benefit from a Power Play multiplier.</p>
<p>Powerball is available to players in Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands, the District of Columbia, as well as 45 US states. With hours to go left for the upcoming drawing on Wednesday, September 27, 2023, millions of people have already purchased their tickets in hopes of securing a big prize.</p>
<p>Lucky Players Hit Prizes from the Latest Drawing</p>
<p>As noted, there was no ticket on Monday night to match all white five balls drawn, 10, 12, 22, 36, 50, as well as the red Powerball 4. Still, more than 1.2 million lucky players secured prizes within the lower tiers.</p>
<p>Notably, four lucky players guessed correctly all five white balls. This granted them a second-tier prize of $1 million each. From the drawing on Monday, there was no winning ticket that secured a $2 million Power Play prize.</p>
<p>Still, 32 people guessed correctly all four white balls along with the red Powerball. This granted them a prize of $50,000 each, while six were able to scoop up a $100,000 Power Play prize each.</p>
