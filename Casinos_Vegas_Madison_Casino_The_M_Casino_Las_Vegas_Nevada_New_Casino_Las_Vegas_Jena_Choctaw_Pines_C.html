    <h1>Casinos Vegas Madison Casino The M Casino Las Vegas Nevada New Casino Las Vegas Jena Choctaw Pines C</h1>

<p>Hello Jake and Peter,</p>
<p>If there are videos showing the issue in question we would love to see those as well, since this issue has never been reported previously and we have no other complaints regarding anything like this, so we would love to investigate closer if there is evidence of this happening.</p>
<p>As for the $16 bet in question, there is no history of that bet amount ever occurring on the customer's account. The account balance had hit $63.74 once, however this was after a $1.50 win on a round of crash (pictured below).</p>
<p>The round the customer provided showing his win does not seem relevant to this case (the photo with the bet ID showing a win of $4.80 on a $2.40 bet). The photos of various crash bets also do not seem relevant as none are the amount the customer is claiming to have made - if we could get some clarity on why those photos were provided we would love to address any associated questions.</p>
<p>As for our support saying this would have been a "visual glitch" - if the customer's connection was having issues, this could happen. If the customer can provide the bet ID for the $16 bet that 3x'd on crash that would be a big help in investigating this.</p>
<p>We can also confirm on our back end that the customer never has any "disappearing" funds - all transactions are accounted for by onsite actions (wins, losses, deposits, withdrawals) - we are happy to provide full transaction history of the customer's account for Guru to look through if they would like to check themselves.</p>
