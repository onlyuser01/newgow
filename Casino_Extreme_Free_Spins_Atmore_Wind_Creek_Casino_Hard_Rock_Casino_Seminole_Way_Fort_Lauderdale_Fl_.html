<p>Fulham vs Manchester City is the game after which we could see a big change in the Premier League standings. If the Cityzens win, they’re going to get to the No. 1 spot. So, will they?</p>

<p>Fulham Hoping for the 2nd Win Over Man City in Sheikh Mansour Era</p>
<p>It was 2008 when Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan a.k.a. Sheikh Mansour and his consortium took over Manchester City. It took them a couple of years to turn the club into a world-beater, which explains why the Sky Blues from Manchester lost one Premier League game to Fulham in 2009.</p>
<p>The same year, they drew with the Cottagers on another two occasions (one in the EPL and one in the EFL Cup). However, since then, Man City are 13-0-0 against this opponent.</p>
<p>Pep Guardiola-led Man City have never lost to Fulham, but maybe it’s time for that to change this weekend? The Cottagers will surely try, but other than the fact that the game is played on their turf, not much other is going in their favor.</p>
<p>For instance, they’re not in great form – they lost six of their last eight games. Further, they’re still without their arguable best striker, Aleksandar Mitrovic who’s suspended. On top of that, Willian and Layvin Kurzawa are sidelined due to injuries.</p>
<p>Manchester City Going to the Top of the Premier League</p>
<p>The Cityzens are coming off a big 4-1 win over the current EPL table leaders Arsenal. As a result, they’re now just two points behind the Gunners. However, considering that Pep Guardiola’s boys have played two games fewer than them, it means that with a win over Fulham on Saturday, they would leapfrog Arsenal and overtake the No. 1 spot.</p>
<p>That seems like good enough of a reason to consider Manchester City a huge favorite, but there are a few more. For example, these guys are in fantastic shape in the Prem with seven straight wins. They also have an almost completely clean bill of health, with Nathan Ake being the only player struggling with fitness at the moment.</p>
<p>There are, however, a couple of things that could cause trouble for Man City ahead of the clash with Fulham. First of all, their schedule is very ugly, considering that they’ve made it to the final of the FA Cup, as well as to the Champions League semis.</p>
<p>That said, coach Guardiola might decide to give some of his best players a day off on Sunday. Still, even without his crucial players on the pitch, the Cityzens are way superior to the Cottagers. Actually, Man City is probably the team with the best bench in the whole wide world.</p>
<p>Fulham vs Manchester City Prediction</p>
<p>On paper, this looks like an easy job for Manchester City, but you can be 100% certain that Pep Guardiola isn’t coming to London with the intention to relax. On the contrary, the manager is taking this game super-seriously, which is why we’re likely to witness another Man City masterclass.</p>
<p>They might not blow Fulham out, but they’re almost certainly going to control this game. In fact, we think we could see them have ball possession of over 80% in Sunday’s match. With the ball in their feet, they’ll want to control the game, rather than charging towards Fulham’s goal.</p>
<p>The result of all this is that we’ll probably see Man City win to nil, but without scoring too many times. They shouldn’t go over three this time.</p>
<p>Pick: Manchester City to win &amp; under 3.5 goals</p>
