    <h1>Tonopah Station Hotel And Casino Social Casino Games Casino Shreveport Horseshoe Casinos Oregon Casi</h1>

<p>Fezbet approved my identity, digital wallet and transaction history, but refused my proof of address. I sent the invoice for my internet bill, a document that is on the permitted list, but they refused saying it was for mobile internet (like, what?). Anyway, I sent the contract for the house where I live which shows my full name and address and I hope it will be accepted, as they are the only proof of address I have in my name. I have a credit card bill, but they say they don't accept digital banks. I also sent the water bill which is in my mother's name (as she lives with me) as an alternative and I will wait for a response.</p>
<p>On the Sportaza side, although they asked for exactly the same KYC, they still haven't given me an update.</p>
<p>To give a better explanation about my anxiety, here in Brazil we have a website "similar" to CasinoGuru but it covers practically all companies and not just betting houses... And it contains SEVERAL reports from users who had this problem with verification and who explained that they had accounts in more than one Rabidi casino and the vast majority (at least of the reports contained there, both from Sportaza and Fezbet -- which are not answered by them there --, ended up having the account closed and the lost funds.</p>
<p>I really hope that I'm just suffering "inadvertently" about this, because it's a huge anguish.</p>
