<p>Malta-based online sports betting company Esports Entertainment Group (EEG) announced today its Vie.bet brand agreed to become the official sponsor of the upcoming Beyond the Summit (BTS) CS:GO tournament.</p>
<p>Live Odds and Specials</p>
<p>The BTS CS:GO online tournament scheduled to take place from May 14 to May 30, 2021, will feature Vie.bet as its exclusive betting partner and will see the brand offer live odds and specials throughout the event.</p>
<p>“The Summit, produced by BTS, has always been an event that is exciting and entertaining across all esports communities. Whether its CS:GO, Dota 2, or Smash Bros., the uniqueness of this event catches viewers from all over the world. My team and I are very excited to partner with BTS for this event.” Bux Syed, Director, Vie.bet</p>
<p>BTS is among the largest esports networks on a global scale, boasting over 20 billion lifetime minutes watched and being the 5th most-viewed Twitch channel of all time. Its broadcasts are distributed via linear and digital channels to more than 110 countries, while its social media reach expands to over 5 million followers.</p>
<p>Targeting North and South American Audiences</p>
<p>As the partnership between EEG and BTS is targeting specifically CS:GO audiences in North and South America, the esports event will be broadcasted live in Portuguese and English.</p>
<p>The previous edition of BTS’s CS:GO tournament, CS_Summit007, attracted 6.4 million unique viewers on the Twitch platform and accounted for 19.3 million total live event views. The number of concurrent viewers on Twitch during peak times is 236,000, while the average number of viewers is around 47,000.</p>
<p>EEG, the only esports company currently listed on the NASDAQ, has its focus on the growing world of professional video gaming and allows bettors to place wagers against each other and on their favorite teams via its proprietary Player-to-Player (P2P) wagering system.</p>
<p>Partnerships with Professional Sport Franchises</p>
<p>The esports online betting operator is also active on the partnership front, teaming with professional sports franchises to organize esports tournaments for them on its Esports Gaming League (EGL) platform.</p>
<p>In December 2020, EEG partnered with the Philadelphia Eagles to bring new experiences to the fans of the NFL franchise by organizing bi-annual NFL Madden tournaments via the popular game emulating the NFL.</p>
<p>In February this year, EEG entered into a partnership with another franchise from the NFL, Baltimore Ravens, in a multi-year agreement to become the franchise’s tournament provider twice a year on the EGL platform, as well as create custom videos with Raven players for digital marketing campaigns.</p>
