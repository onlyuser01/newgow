<p>€ 100</p>
<p>DANIELBOR</p>
<p>POSTED ON AUGUST 15, 2023</p>
<p>I have uploaded 100€ to lala.bet on the 8th of Aug using my bank app and bancontact method which they offer on their site and it is still not credited to my account. It's been more than a week if waiting time.</p>
<p>The process is that you choose you payment method, than they direct you to a provider (Lunu - crypto transactions) than you have to transfer the money to a specific bank or provider (zen.com) through your bank app. The whole process takes a verification from Lunu than 2-3 clicks and the money is transferred.</p>
<p>After waiting few hours, I contacted lala.bet support who told me that they are working on it, I will get it soon. They are giving me the same answer, even today. No other details, no additional informationhas been provided to me.</p>
<p>After 4-5 days have contacted Lunu support and Zen.com. Lunu Support was really responsive and told me that the transaction was successful.</p>
<p>Zen.com still trying to figure out where is the issue, but no additional detail or information so far.</p>
<p>Lala.bet is still telling me that the transaction is pending..</p>
<p>I have provided all the info and pdf that I have from my bank that my money was sent successfully, it was instantly taken off my bank account.</p>
<p>It is a painful case because to be completely honest, I am almost broke and I still have to be in a situation like this.</p>
<p>I do not recommend this casino to anyone until I don't see my case resolved.</p>
