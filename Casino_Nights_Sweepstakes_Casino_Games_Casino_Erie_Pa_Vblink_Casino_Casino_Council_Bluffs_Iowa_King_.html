<p>Hi Jozef,</p>
<p>Client came through on the 30 March 2021 and advised of her winnings of 25k and wanted to withdraw all funds. Player was then advised that the pending period is 24 hours and that she will only be able to withdraw 10k per week and it should reflect in her account within 3-5 working days. Our agent then advise the client that she can have her account locked until funds has been processed. Whereby the client then agreed to do so. This was then soft locked and not a gambling problem lock account request as stated by the client.</p>
<p>The client came back on the 31 March 2021 querying the withdrawal status and client was informed that the status has not changed as it is still under review. Client then requested for the account to be unlocked and stated that she only wants to reverse 5k, at this time client was cautioned twice by the agent that the account was locked until all has been finalized. At this stage the client was also advised that should the account be unlocked that it would be done on her request and that she takes full responsibility if any withdrawals are reverse, of which she then stated that she takes full responsibility. Client now only stated gambling problem as this was not the case in the initial account closure. Our terms are clear on responsible gaming and we follow them through to the end, but in this case no mention on her side that she has a gambling problem. What we believe has happened is that the client was chasing another big win and then lost control and only afterwards when all was lost came up with such a claim. We have all chat transcripts should you wish to review.</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>Levi</p>
