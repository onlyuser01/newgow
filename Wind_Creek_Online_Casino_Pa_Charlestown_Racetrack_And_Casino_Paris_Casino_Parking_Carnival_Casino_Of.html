<p>Pariplay, a leading provider of Internet Gaming Systems and casino games, has agreed to power the online operator PlayStar with games. The deal celebrates PlayStar’s launch in the state of New Jersey.</p>
<p>PlayStar Gets More Games</p>
<p>As per the agreement, the supplier will provide PlayStar with some of the best titles developed by its proprietary studio Wizard Games. PlayStar players will be able to try out critically-acclaimed games such as Dragons of the North, Rumble Rhino Megaways and Wildwood Buffalo.</p>
<p>The operator plans to roll out more games for the states where it holds a license. This way, it will be able to engage customers with a diverse portfolio of exciting gaming offerings. PlayStar plans continue its growth, and therefore, it will add more titles to its offerings in other states as well. Because of this, inking deals with major content suppliers is an important strategy to increase PlayStar’s value to players and enhance its portfolio. Overall, PlayStar plans to improve its quality by introducing diverse and engaging content, better personalization tools and unrivaled customer service.</p>
<p>This deal is in line with Pariplay’s strategy, which has seen the company double down on its efforts to expand its footprint in the United States and North America as a whole. Recently, the company agreed to power the Mexican operator Winpot.mx with games through its Pariplay Fusion platform. Furthermore, it also teamed up with Skillzzgaming to roll out exclusive US-oriented content.</p>
<p>The Companies Are Glad to Expand Their NA Presence</p>
<p>Andrew Maclean, the vice president of sales for Pariplay, spoke about the deal with PlayStar. He said that his company is pleased to join forces with the operator and continue pursuing expansion in North America. Maclean praised PlayStar as a true innovator and said that he is looking forward to working with it:</p>
<p>The company’s (PlayStar’s) exciting approach to operations gives us the perfect chance to enjoy a successful partnership with a brand that has huge aspirations to carve a real niche within the biggest emerging market in the world. Andrew Maclean, VP of Sales, Pariplay</p>
<p>Likewise, Adam Noble, the chief business development officer of PlayStar, is also happ about the partnership. Noble lauded Pariplay’s Fusion platform as something that will give the operator immediate access to a plethora of content. Additionally, he mentioned that diversifying PlayStar’s content is a key to boosting player acquisition and retention. Noble added that PlayStar looks to team up with the best platforms in the sector. Because of that, it is delighted to have Pariplay by its side.</p>
<p>PlayStar continues its journey to disrupt the market by providing high-quality gaming experiences to bettors.</p>
