<p>Hello there! I fear the calculation is not that simple. To get the proper RTP you need to reverse-engineer the slot. This is why it is so damn hard to prove such a thing.</p>
<p>Besides:</p>
<p>"EXAMPLE</p>
<p>If a game RTP is 96%, it means that if you start with $1,000,000,000 and then play 1,000,000,000 rounds at $1 each, then you should end up with approximately $960,000,000 dollars."</p>
<p>Volatility of slots</p>
<p>Volatility of a slot game can‚Äôt be expressed as a single number, as you can win thousands of different win amounts as a result of the many different winning combinations. I have found out that the most accurate way to present slot volatility is a chart like this:</p>
<p>(https://casino.guru/how-slot-machines-work-math#slots-rtp-volatility-variance)</p>
<p>Thus, games and their creators need to be licensed to provide a guarantee of "honest" products.</p>
<p>You can always ask the game provider to check out your gaming history. I would bet you won't get a reply. Many players are convinced their bad luck is something more sinister and want to get an explanation. üôÅ</p>
<p>If you decide to try, let me know how it goes, please.</p>
