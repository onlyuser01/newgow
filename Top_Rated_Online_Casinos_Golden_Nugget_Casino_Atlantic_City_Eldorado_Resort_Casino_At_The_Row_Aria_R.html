<p>With the Dota 2 competitive season successfully wrapped up and the 2021-2022 Dota Pro Circuit looming, at least one organization will be missing out the upcoming events hosted by Valve. Omega Esports, a Philippine-based esports powerhouse, has been awarded a ban from all Valve-sponsored events as allegations of match-fixing have surfaced.</p>
<p>The organization has lost its Division One status in the Dota 2 pecking order in the Southeast Asia Regional organizer, Beyond the Summit, a popular host of esports events has said. Without an approval to continue, Omega Esports</p>

<p>The implications for the franchise are huge, but luckily some players will be able to continue playing. Three of the current Omega Dota 2 roster members were cleared of all charges, to name Ramzi “Ramz” Bayhaki, Lee “Forev” Sang-don, and Liew “Eren” Jun Jie.</p>
<p>However, coach Chris “CTY” Ian Francis Maldo and five of the organization’s previous team members have been caught red-handed, BTS claims. Dave “Hiro” Miyata, Prince Daculan, Patt “Piolz” Piolo Dela Cruz, Van “Van” Jerico Manalaysay, Ryniel “Zenki” Keit Calvez have all participated in knowingly fixing Dota 2 games against opponents.</p>
<p>Out with a BANG, BOOM Esports In</p>
<p>Interestingly, Team Execration recently recruited Van as the team’s offlaner. They will now have to look for a recruit but will be allowed to continue competing in the DPC. Omega will not be able to participate, though, and it would be relegated out of professional Dota 2 play, giving up its spot in the league to Indonesian esports organization BOOM Esports.</p>
<p>This will be a step up for BOOM Esports who are going to move automatically from Division Two. Meanwhile, their vacated slot in the league will be filled through a closed qualifier on November 26 hosted by Beyond The Summit. The host has invited three teams to battle for the BOOM Esports slot for a chance to make it back into competitive play.</p>
<p>While Valve and tournament hosts have found a quick fix for the issue, the prevalence of match-fixing in competitive video gaming has become a more serious issue of late. Previously, the members of Dota 2 organization Newbee, were implicated in a match-fixing scandal leading to their permanent suspension from professional play.</p>
<p>What is shocking is that Newbee managed to win The International 2014, bagging a $5,025,029 first-place prize along with that. In places such as Australia, match-fixing in video gaming has become a criminal offense that can lead to jail time.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, organizations such as the Esports Integrity Coalition (ESIC) have sworn to uphold the order and integrity of professional gaming and clamp down on fraudsters.</p>
