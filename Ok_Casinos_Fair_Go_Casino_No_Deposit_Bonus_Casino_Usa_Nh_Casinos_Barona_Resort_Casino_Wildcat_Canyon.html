The site is known for its live betting, horse racing, and traditional sports betting offer and provides you with a selection of great markets, competitive odds, exciting bonus opportunities, and even a crypto promo right from the start. We will dig deep into each section to help you find all you need to know before you commit.</p>
<p>As far as online sportsbook options go, BetUS makes sure that sports fans will have a great selection of opportunities to explore. The user interface and experience are top-notch, and you will have numerous offers, markets, and odds boosters to enjoy. Let’s find out what this sports betting site is all about.</p>
<p>BetUS Sportsbook Welcome Bonus</p>
<p>BetUS has a massive selection of bonus offers to extend to players. The sports betting site brings you several worthwhile promos that need to be taken at their own merit. In fact, BetUS has several sign-up promotions giving you the right to choose what specific bonus you wish to explore and if any at all. Let’s have a look at the available bonuses and what they bring to the table.</p>
<p>125% Sign-up Bonus up to $2,500</p>
<p>One small caveat to mind here is that the sports betting offer is only 100% of the total bonus. The other 25% applies to the casino. You are free to pick either one or focus on the sports betting experience. To claim the bonus, you simply need to make a deposit of at least $100 which will then be matched to $2,500. The rollover requirement is 10x, and the bonus itself has a 14-day expiry. Use bonus code JOIN125 to activate the bonus.</p>
<p>$200% Crypto Match Bonus up to $2,500</p>
<p>For those of you who want to deposit with Bitcoin and still place a sports wager, BetUS is the right sportsbook to pick. The crypto match bonus is once again split between sports and casino, with the bulk going directly to sports or some 150% matched up to $1,875. To activate the bonus, you need to make a deposit of at least $100. Once you do, you will have 14 days to wager the bonus. The wagering requirement here is 15x, so keep this in mind. Use bonus code JOIN200 to activate the bonus.</p>
<p>Reloads, Loyalty, and RAF Bonuses</p>
<p>BetUS Sportsbook has a wide variety of bonuses you may claim. The reload bonuses or Re-Up Bonuses, as they are known, will offer you a variety of ways to top up your bankroll even after you have registered and finished your playthrough through the first deposit bonus. Whether you want more sportsbooks or casino funds, they will be available to you.</p>
<p>The sportsbook puts a big emphasis on any deposit carried out in Bitcoin and offers several worthwhile offers you can benefit from. Because of the constant changes in the bonusing system at BetUS, we recommend visiting the site as this will help you get a quick grasp on the available bonuses.</p>
<p>BetUS uses a number of promo codes to help you trigger the different available promotions offers. There is a dedicated Rewards program designed in tiers to award you with comp points which can be redeemed for additional betting funds.</p>
<p>Not least, sports fans can bring their fans on board by tapping into the BetUS refer-a-friend bonus. Each account has a unique referral signature that can be used to bring more people to the sportsbook. When a friend registers and deposits, you will earn 100% of their deposit bonus up to a total of $1,000.</p>
<p>Sports Betting Markets at BetUS</p>

All odds listed on the sportsbook are comparable to other leading betting websites. You will find the lines and fixtures for popular sports to add value and the probability of the overall line to bet spot-on.</p>
<p>The sportsbook provides you with a good and strong selection of betting odds to take advantage of, and that applies to the mainstream contests available down to the niche markets you can find for some more obscure sports, such as darts or tennis tables.</p>
<p>So then, what markets can you place bets on? There are multiple options, and they will vary depending on the sport you choose. However, as with most sportsbooks out there, you can rest assured that there will be the option to bet on Match Winners, Point Spreads, Totals, and Proposition bets.</p>
