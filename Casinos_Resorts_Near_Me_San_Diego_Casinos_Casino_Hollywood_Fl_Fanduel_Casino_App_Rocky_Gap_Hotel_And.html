<p>The news comes after the business-to-solution provider of premium iGaming products announced that it would add NOWPayments to its roster of supported crypto payment methods earlier in the week. The newly inked deal with V8Poker, the popular content provider on the Asian continent, will help NuxGame continue to provide top-grade content to its clients.</p>
<p>NuxGame to Harness V8Poker’s Innovative Solutions</p>
<p>Commenting on the new decision, NuxGame’s chief executive officer Daniel Heywood expressed their excitement for being able to access the Asian gaming market which he described as a “dynamic and diverse market.” He also spoke about the rising growth opportunities that he called “boundless” in the context of the new partnership with their highly experienced and innovative partner.</p>
<p>The latter specializes in offering state-of-the-art, localized card and table titles for customers on the lookout for an enhanced gaming experience and adding more variety.</p>
<p>According to the landmark content agreement, the 2018-launched iGaming platform provider will take advantage of V8Poker’s unique game formats and top game picture quality, alongside their application programming interface (API) that is distributed without limits to generate visual impacts never seen before.</p>
<p>Since V8Poker’s titles are customized to cater to the needs of a wide plethora of users at the same time, NuxGame along with its partners in Asia will benefit from a lot of scaling opportunities for their operations. This is essential in the constantly growing Asian markets where offering eye-catching content that can stick its head above the crowd and draw all the attention is mandatory to differentiate oneself.</p>
<p>Operators here are, therefore, busy finding new ways to stimulate players’ interests and convince them to return to their platforms and access even more content. This in itself has represented one of the main reasons why NuxGame decided to ink the new content deal with V8Poker.</p>
<p>V8Poker’s Intelligently Engineered Games, Part of the Deal</p>
<p>As a result of the new deal, the company that offers sport engine, retail, legal services, turnkey, and website API solutions is hoping to offer its partners from Asia the most entertaining games possible.</p>
<p>V8Poker’s generous list of games features excellent designs and spectacular mechanics created with the help of intelligent engineering. These games are expected to offer NuxGame’s Asia-oriented partners customized gaming experiences suitable for Asian players’ expectations. Among V8Poker’s most sought-after games that are likely to turn into crowd favorites we can mention Sic Bo, Blackjack, Texas Hold’em Poker, and Fan-Tan.</p>
