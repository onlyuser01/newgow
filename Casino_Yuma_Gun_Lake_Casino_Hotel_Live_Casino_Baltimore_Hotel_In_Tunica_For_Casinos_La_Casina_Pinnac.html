<p>One of the first sportsbooks in the world to adopt esports betting markets is now bringing a new dedicated competitive event under its aegis</p>
<p>The Pinnacle Cup, a popular tournament series organized by the namesake sports and esports betting company, will be coming back for a new edition in 2023. The competition focuses on Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, one of the most bet-on video games in the world of esports.</p>

<p>Pinnacle is also expanding the current scope of the competition, adding a Brazilian circuit which reflects both the company’s commitment to some of the most popular regions when it comes to CS:GO and also the fans based in those regions.</p>
<p>The 2023 edition will feature a total of four events. The upcoming events will include a Swiss and Playoffs format and they will have a Play-In stage with a $50,000 prize pool. Two of the big tournaments that are coming will be taking place in Brazil, with Pinnacle giving a much stronger focus on the jurisdiction.</p>
<p>The news was welcomed by Pinnacle Head of Esports Alex McBride who said that the company was delighted to see the return of the CS:GO tournament circuit. McBride also spoke of the Dota 2 series that the company announced previously and said:</p>
<p>These events will give teams at the top of their game, as well as aspiring teams trying to break into the elite tier, a chance to prove themselves. Pinnacle Head of Esports Alex McBride</p>
<p>Pinnacle will continue to work with GRID as the official data and analytics firm for the upcoming event. GRID head of sponsorships was happy with this development. Harry Wiggett said that the company was very happy to welcome Pinnacle back for yet another year of esports competitions.</p>
<p>“After a successful 2022 full of CSGO action including a 250,000 USD arena finals in Sweden, we’re excited to take what we’ve learned together and bring Pinnacle Cup’s back to the community and market,” Wiggett said.</p>
