<p>British online gambling company bet365 has been chosen as the fastest-growing British boxing promotional company Boxxer’s official betting partner. The deal also extends to Sky Sports boxing.</p>
<p>Becoming Boxxer’s Official Betting and Odds Partner</p>
<p>Additionally, bet365 has also been picked as Boxxer’s official odds partner. As an odds partner, bet365 will be integrated into all of Boxxer’s social and digital content. Fans of bet365 and/or Boxxer can expect to start seeing the operator’s logo across boxing events as soon as the Sky Sports Wembley Arena event on October 2.</p>
<p>Through this, the gambling operator will help fans to expand their knowledge of boxing events and fighters. Thanks to this partnership, bet365 will start featuring live streams of the Boxxer matches on its platform. Those streams are planned to be available in multiple international territories. Bettors can become more familiar with the fighters they are wagering their money on and can closely follow how bouts unfold.</p>
<p>The founder and chief executive officer of Boxxer, Ben Shalom, spoke on the deal with bet365. He revealed that his company is impressed by bet365’s customer conscience, quality, and trusted position around the world and is delighted to work together with them.</p>
<p>“We believe there is substantial synergy in terms of our brand values, with both companies committed to innovation and unlocking access to the greatest live sporting events,” Shalom pointed out.</p>
<p>In recent times, Boxxer has been dedicated to establishing reliable partners within the world of gambling. The boxing promotional company has previously worked with the betting operator Mansionbet. During this partnership, Masionbet’s logo was featured prominently in Boxxer events, including in the Ultimate Boxxer tournament.</p>
<p>Bet365 Continues Its Expansion</p>
<p>A bet365 spokesperson also commented on the partnership. “We are delighted to be working with an exciting new partner within the boxing space that will bring compelling new events to the growing industry,” he said in a release.</p>
<p>The spokesperson from the gambling operator added that bet365 places significant importance on working closely with all of its partners. He ended by saying that the operator is looking forward to collaborating and maintaining positive terms with Boxxer.</p>
<p>Bet365 has been focusing on expansion. The company was lucky to be one of the few companies that recently got approved by the Netherlands gambling regulator, the KSA. Thanks to this, bet365 will be one of the first ten betting operators who will have the opportunity of pioneering the fresh Dutch online betting market that launches on October 1.</p>
