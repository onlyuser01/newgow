<p>Australian sports betting operator PointsBet saw the end of its financial year riddled with expenses over US expansion</p>
<p>Core business operations soared to AUD$25.6 million, up 173% in comparison to the previous fiscal year</p>
<p>Chief executive Sam Swanell reasons that expenses are necessary for their growing presence on the US market, feeling upbeat despite the financial losses</p>
<p>“The technology agility and operational focus that allowed PointsBet to launch so swiftly and effectively in New Jersey will be a significant competitive advantage as the company launches in numerous states in FY2020 and beyond. PointsBet is on the starting line of the nascent US sports betting opportunity.” Swanell said.</p>
<p>PointsBet’s Financial Year’s End Results</p>
<p>January 2019 marked the Australian sports betting operator, PointsBet, move in on American territories. This has created a serious pull of resources on their side, as the business reported a loss of $515,000 from overall $1.5 million in gross winnings in the US for the period up to Jun 30. Investing in advertising and business promotion totaled $2.1 million, but – in accordance with future perspectives – is expected to pay out in the not too distant future. Sales and marketing alone pulled some $24.9 million for US market promotions. Employee benefits and staff expansion also contributed to the widening of the expenses, as they climbed up to $15.6 million.</p>
<p>Overall, year-on-year spend made a significant spike, as the statutory total for operating expenses spiked up to $47.8 million in contrast to $11.8 million in the fiscal 2018.</p>
<p>Product and technology expenses also spiked expenses, perhaps as the Australian operator is investing in new technology for its new market. Speculations aside, the numbers stand at $1.9 million, up from $300,000 last year. The period also saw administrative expenses climb from $900,000 to $5.3 million.</p>
<p>The overall higher spend also became reason for a bigger statutory loss after income tax. Its 2018 $6.7 million in tax grew to $41.9 million. In light of that the pre-tax loss indicator also spiked from $6.7 million to $39 million.</p>
<p>Despite the pull, PointsBet’s core business in Australia soared 173% from AUD$9.4 million last year to AUD$25.6 million for the 12 month period, which ended June 30th. Net winnings jumped to $28.9 million, up 18.9 million as compared to the year before.</p>
<p>Sam Swanell reflected that the statutory gross profit more than doubled during the said period and was not feeling discouraged in view of the numbers.</p>
<p>PointsBet’s Future on the US Regulated Sports Betting Market</p>
<p>However, PointsBet reported positive results from New Jersey, as their overall contribution climbed 3.2% in June, making for a total of 5.4% contribution to the New Jersey regulated sports betting market in just a few months, in comparison to their February reports, which stood at 2.2%.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the operator has just recently received a green light for launching in Illinois, Indiana – which just recently joined the market – as well as Iowa, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Other promising perspectives from Colorado, Louisiana, Missouri, Ohio and New York are also on the table, awaiting confirmation.</p>
