<p>Finnish game developer Supercell has teamed up with Ligue 1 soccer champions Paris Saint-Germain for an official Brawl Stars partnership.</p>
<p>Supercell and PSG Join Hands in Esports</p>
<p>French soccer powerhouse Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) has tied up a new partnership with mobile gaming developer Supercell. Supercell is a Finland-based company that has created some of the most competitive and memorable mobile esports titles, including Clash Royale, Clash of Clans, Boom Beach, and Brawl Stars. Most recently, PSG sealed a victory at DreamHack Valencia 2019 in Rocket League.</p>
<p>As a result of the partnership, Supercell is PSG’s official gaming partner. This is an important landmark for the Ligue 1 team which has been driving steadier inroads in esports with titles, such as Rocket League, Dota 2, and FIFA 19. To commemorate the partnership, Supercell will create a special PSG-themed edition for Brawl Stars.</p>
<p>The news was well-received by Marc Armstrong, who is head of PSG partnerships. Here is what Mr. Armstrong had to say:</p>
<p>Our two brands share the same global ambition and a young and dynamic identity that appeals to a young audience. With more than 75 million fans on social media, nearly a quarter of them in Asia, the club will help Supercell to consolidate its popularity around the world.</p>
<p>As is the custom in such activations, PSG soccer stars were involved with the video promotion of the partnership. Kylian Mbappé, Neymar Jr, Marquinhos, Angel Di María, Julian Draxler and Presnel Kimpembe all appeared in the video.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Supercell Head of Marketing for Europe Manuel Langegger expressed the company’s satisfaction to be working with the French soccer team:</p>
<p>We are proud to join forces with a club that understands and shares our passion for games, all with the aim of learning from each other’s expertise and experience.</p>
<p>Langegger further added that Supercell was pleased to associate their brand with a renowned innovator in mainstream sports and competitive video gaming in the face of PSG.</p>
<p>Paris Saint-Germain has been one of the most innovative soccer clubs in Europe and the world insofar as esports are concerned. The team launched its Dota 2 squad in collaboration with Chinese powerhouse LGD and went on to finish second in The International 2018, the world’s most prestigious Dota 2 event, losing to OG.</p>
<p>The team has also been successful in Rocket League, dominating DreamHack Valencia 2019 just recently, and securing first place in the tournament. PSG also has existing ties with sports betting agency Betway, which has been investing heavily in backing mainstream sports teams and esports outfits.</p>
