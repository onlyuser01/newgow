<p>1X2 Network is moving onto the United States, with the company bringing its unique portfolio of titles through a partnership with Light &amp; Wonder, which will utilize its well-established aggregation platform to reach more customers, operators, and players in the country.</p>
<p>The first place where this is happening is Michigan, where players will have the chance to access a vast selection of 1X2 Network games developed by four in-house studios, to wit Iron Dog Studio, Ad Lunam, Prospect Gaming, and the eponymous 1X2gaming.</p>
<p>1X2 Network and Light &amp; Wonder are not chance partners either as they have already worked together in other jurisdictions, including across Europe, and are now shifting up a gear by moving their collaboration to cover the market in North America, and the United States specifically.</p>
<p>1X2 Network CEO Kevin Reid has welcomed the opportunity to see the company’s portfolio expand in the United States, and do so in partnership with Light &amp; Wonder, a company that 1X2 Network has come to trust and build strong and fruitful collaborations with.</p>
<p>"We are starting in Michigan, but work is already well underway in other states," Reid added, confident that this is only the beginning of much better things to come.</p>
<p>Light &amp; Wonder Digital Partnerships Director Steve Mayes was similarly happy to be collaborating with 1X2 Network, touting its more than 20 years of experience in building high-performing and outstanding titles that appeal to players of all hues.</p>
<p>"It’s great to now be in a position to start putting its games in front of players in the U.S., who I am sure will be every bit as receptive as players have been in the European markets," Mayes wrapped up. Light &amp; Wonder has been particularly active in the North American market, striking partnerships in Ontario with Playzido.</p>
<p>In the meantime, 1X2 Network has pursued several opportunities of its own, having reached out to different content aggregators and individual brands. In Romania, 1X2 Network teamed up with Skywind Group and it has pursued similar partnerships and opportunities with REEVO through the company’s ever-growing aggregation solution that only features games from the best providers.</p>
<p>Not least, 1X2 Network’s games have been featured as part of Livespins’ platform, which supercharges the casino experience and creates innovative ways for players, streamers and operators to engage.</p>
