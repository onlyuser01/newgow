<p>Slotegrator has completed the anticipated product integration with premier iGaming developer NetGaming in a bid for both companies to benefit from their unique industry focus. In this instance, Slotegrator focuses on delivering aggregated content to online casinos and the addition of NetGaming’s portfolio of distinct titles allows the company to continue building its unique product offering available to B2B clients and player bases. The tie-up was announced in September with the companies now completing full content integration.</p>
<p>NetGaming comes as a good choice for Slotegrator with the young studio backed by industry veterans and systematically building up its footprint. The developer is dedicated to using innovative mechanics that introduce new ways of engaging with iGaming products rather than reusing well-established features already available on the market. So far, NetGaming has been able to publish over 20 high-quality slots and table games with more coming down the pipeline.</p>
<p>Commenting on this partnership, NetGaming’s team was happy to say: “NetGaming is delighted to add Slotegrator to our growing list of customers. Slotegrator’s market entry approach is aligned with NetGaming’s and we are looking forward to building a mutually beneficial relationship. Our games portfolio continues to grow from strength to strength.”</p>
<p>NetGaming’s portfolio features top-notch choices such as MTV Pimp My Ride, Shelby Online Video Slot, and more. The company has also developed other fan-favorite titles such Skulls Gone Wild, Vegas Time! and Guardian of Prosperity proving resilient and popular choices with players.</p>
<p>To help with the onboarding, NetGaming has leveraged its expertise in creating strong marketing tools that further add value to the experience. NetGaming offers various bonus features and plans on releasing a tournament tool later in 2021.</p>
<p>NetGaming is confidently building its unique signature style that now resonates with new audiences from across the world of iGaming thanks to the company’s strong ties with business partners facilitating product distribution. Slotegrator is similarly happy to add a new developer to its massive game library that now features over 5,000 games and 75 licensed game developers.</p>
