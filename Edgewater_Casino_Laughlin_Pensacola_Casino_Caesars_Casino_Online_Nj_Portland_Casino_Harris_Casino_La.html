<p>Researchers seek gamblers in Illinois to do an anonymous survey that may include a $30 e-gift card for the participants.</p>
<p>Gamblers of Illinois Can Participate in Anonymous Survey</p>
<p>Researchers from the Illinois Department of Human Services want to conduct an anonymous survey among gamblers in Illinois who don’t consider their habit a problem. With this survey, addiction experts want to see how spread the problem of gambling is in the state.</p>
<p>Participants could be gamblers who play anything from slots and online sports betting, bingo, lottery, even illegal cockfighting, and dogfighting. The survey is part of an assessment to help gamblers at risk. Experts want to see what the state level of risky gambling behavior is. There hasn’t been a survey of this magnitude conducted in the state for the past 20 years.</p>
<p>The survey was published on Wednesday, asking state residents, who place bets, regularly to take 10 to 15 minutes of their time to complete it. Although the information will remain confidential and anonymity kept, the participants who provide an email address will receive a $30 e-gift card.</p>
<p>People who want to take part in the survey can visit the Illinois Gambling Survey’s website. The report will be published in the summer.</p>
<p>Problem Gambling Awareness Month</p>
<p>Researchers are conducting a half-million-dollar gambling addiction study during the gaming expansion in the state. The study is unprecedented for Illinois because it focuses on understanding and preventing gambling disorders.</p>
<p>With the gambling-expansion law from 2019, there are many more gambling facilities in the state, and there is an outlook to add even more slot machines and casinos. According to experts, the calls to the state’s gambling disorder hotline have doubled in the past 2 years.</p>
<p>During the Gaming Board’s meeting for Problem Awareness Month, Hannah Carliner, from Health Resources in Action, said that a statewide survey could give a better view on risky gambling. She stated that people who have experienced segregation based on race or culture are essential to the study.</p>
<p>Problem Gambling Awareness Month aims to provide residents with more information about gambling-related problems. Pennsylvania’s Gaming Control Board has also embraced PGAM’s goal towards gambling disorder awareness and started the month with a free webinar on gambling addiction.</p>
<p>March has been Problem Gambling Awareness Month for almost two decades. The campaign increases public awareness of gambling addiction and related issues. It encourages healthcare providers and organizations to check clients for risk gambling signs.</p>
