<p>Flutter Entertainment is outlining the goals the company wants to achieve over the next decade or so. The company has set firm objectives for the year 2030 with one of its most important pivots towards energy sustainability. This is part of a three-pronged strategy for the future aptly dubbed “Positive Impact Plan.”</p>
<p>Building Communities, Focusing on Sustainability</p>
<p>Flutter is hoping to build up its sustainability efforts and maximize this strategy on a global scale that will allow it to contribute to various social initiatives, reduce any harmful impact it may have on fellow colleagues, players, and the communities where the company is based.</p>
<p>One of those pivots is to see players “play better” and employees “work better” through various cooperation between business and communities, Flutter explained. The company’s chief executive, Peter Jackson, welcomed the opportunity to use this strategy to build the future of the company’s identity. In a statement, Jackson added:</p>
<p>“We are committed to contributing positively to our customers, colleagues and the communities in which we operate. This plan builds on the strong foundations laid by each of our divisions, leveraging our global scale and positioning us at the forefront of meaningful change.” Flutter Entertainment CEO Peter Jackson</p>
<p>Flutter will make a dramatic effort towards onboarding customers who play online on its dedicated well-being tools. In this case, the company is talking about the “Play Well tools” which are supposed to feature alerts, AI tracking behavior, and notifications when someone is spending above their limits, for example.</p>
<p>Flutter is making tangible steps to make this a reality including £45 million ($60 million) to bolster the available gambling measures on its websites. Jackson said that safer gambling is a prime objective and mission of the entire business. The Play Well strategy is reliable and will significantly enhance the way Flutter assists players, he added.</p>
<p>Paddy Power and Betfair Seek to Employ More Female Execs</p>
<p>A Diversity, Equality, and Inclusion (DE&amp;I) strategy has also been put in place to help build a diverse business. This means that the group’s leading brands, including Paddy Power and Betfair, will push for at least 40% of their top positions to be represented by female executives. Jackson added:</p>
<p>“Flutter’s leading brands are deeply embedded in communities and homes all over the world,” Jackson concluded. “Our approach reflects this and will continue to evolve over the coming years in line with shifts in our markets, technological developments, and continued collaboration with our stakeholders.” Flutter Entertainment CEO Peter Jackson</p>
<p>Flutter will further seek to work with local partners that can help it achieve its community-focused objectives, including outreach and support goals. Each of these pillars will have specific pillars that must be met and achieved by the year 2030. Some of those are broader, such as the Paris Agreement and the Race to Zero campaign by the United Nations want to see more businesses going carbon-free.</p>
<p>Other sustainability efforts focus on the so-called “e-waste” policy which seeks to ensure that any online operations supported by Flutter are now conducted through renewable energies. The company is also a member of the European Gaming and Betting Association (EGBA), which means it would be continually aligning its own operations with EGBA’s standards for responsible and safe gambling experience.</p>
