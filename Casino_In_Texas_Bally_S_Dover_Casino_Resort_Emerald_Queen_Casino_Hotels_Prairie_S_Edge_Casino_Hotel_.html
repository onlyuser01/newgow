    <h1>Casino In Texas Bally S Dover Casino Resort Emerald Queen Casino Hotels Prairie S Edge Casino Hotel</h1>

<p>Hi Nick and thank you for replying.All documents apart from phone verification are approved. Which are :</p>
<p>My address</p>
<p>My method of deposit</p>
<p>My identity</p>
<p>The phone is impossible to verify due to not ever allowing me to receive the sms code necessary to send to Boho to verify . It’s as though the deliberately have this set up to fail on purpose .</p>
<p>aApart from that communications are purely generic and they change their reasons for continuously refusing my payout .For example asking several times for reverification when it’s already been completed ( 3 times submitted) then proof of my deposits, then just canceling without explanation.</p>
<p>I deposited $30 on 17th Feb, no bonuses attached and keep winning, so I decided to withdraw $650 and submitted that request . The deposit was cleared and my account with Boho said there were no restrictions ( no bonus restrictions) preventing me from withdrawing this amount .</p>
<p>Then I continued playing with the balance and also deposited $ 30 extra to keep playing . Then when I won again ,I withdrew $350 , again without bonus conditions .</p>
<p>Almost straight away both were canceled no explanation ..So I went into my account and this is where I discovered that I had not actually completed my verification requirements. Boho did not say that time I needed to verify , they simply just canceled on what grounds I do not know . So after submitting all the documents and having all but the phone verified ( they have never mentioned this requirement by the way when they cancel , I think they deliberately have made it impossible for anyone to verify the phone numbers in order to restrict accessing your winnings)</p>
<p>I never hear from the support team at all when I email them each time my request is cancelled , only from the withdrawal email with different reasons .</p>
<p>Then , after I won the money for my $350 my 2nd deposit on the 17th of February for $30 deposit with funds in my boho account I see when I checked my bank account on the 20th of February that the deposit was rejected ??</p>
<p>So , Boho then kept asking for proof I had deposited. I have no idea what has happened and this occurred after I had already sent you my complaint . Therefore, Boho is now questioning both my withdrawals, even though the first $650 withdrawal was requested before the second withdrawal request of $650, completely nothing to do with the 2nd withdrawal request of $350 . Yet they are combining the two and refusing them both .</p>
<p>I have attempted several times to withdraw various amounts now to see if they will approve them in smaller increments but they keep refusing, refusing and refusing . If I cannot access the money won by the rejected 2nd deposit, which is out of my control , surely the first winnings I won fair and square on a approved deposit without bonus conditions attached ( I read their terms and conditions ) should be be paid without question .</p>
<p>Another glitch is that when I try to withdraw money and have it deposited back into the method of payment I used to deposit ( master card) it will never accept my address, so I ask for a bank deposit. They have never questioned me about this either , which I find odd and suspicious because one condition I read about is that when you withdraw you must withdraw using the same method you use to deposit, except I can never get it to process . They easily accept deposits , but make it impossible to withdraw . I am bringing this to you for urgent attention Nic , as in my experience the 7.5 rating is very misleading . I would never have joined if I knew how they actually operate and treat their players .</p>
<p>The last time I heard from them was last night . Again rejected . I have requested to receive less money now $ 535 which is the amount they advertised on the winning page I won before I tried to withdraw $650 . Be interesting to see what, why they will no doubt refuse this too .</p>
<p>I have played out the remaining balance now, trying to win more with no deposit, silly me, I should have left the balance at $1000, but I thought if I won more with no further deposit, then they would have no recourse to keep refusing . They keep referring to the $30 rejected deposit as reason for the entire amount being refused when the two withdrawal requests were entirely separate .</p>
<p>They are a very dishonest, casino and I can hardly afford to lose money I have won as I now care full time for my very I’ll husband and I hoped I could win some money to pay some bills . A risk , but when I did , I was over the moon, took a burden off my chest . Then it’s been stressful ever since .</p>
<p>I truly hope you can get to the bottom of this for me , at least see why their Mastercard and phone verification system is a sham designed to fail . I am in Australia by the way .</p>
<p>Kindest Regards for any assistance, explanation.</p>
<p>yours faithfully</p>
