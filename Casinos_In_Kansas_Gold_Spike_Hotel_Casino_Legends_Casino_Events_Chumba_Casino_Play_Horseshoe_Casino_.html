<p>Globally the focus has moved away from player acquisition to player protection. Appeasing the regulator is the key to a sustainable and thriving business in the iGaming space. This is the logic Zeal, an online lottery company, follows in teaming up with MindwayAI, a safe and responsible gambling specialist, which will help the company bolster its own understanding of how to better protect players.</p>
<p>To achieve this, Zeal will benefit from MindwayAI’s advanced artificial intelligencealgorithms and GameScanner solution which is capable of analyzing consumer behavior by looking for aberrations in player habits and taking stock of the overall pace of play for each individual customer.</p>
<p>This data can play a crucial role in alerting the company early if someone is playing outside of their means or spending more than usual. It also makes for a powerful message deliveringsystem as customers can also be alerted if they are spending too much.</p>
<p>Zeal CEO Helmut Becker was pleased with the opportunity to be adding MindwayAI to the range of tools used to ensure that consumers remain protected. He assured that the prevention of gambling addiction is an utmost priority which Zeal is working actively towards bolstering around the clock. Commenting on MindwayAI’s powerful solutions, Becker added:</p>
<p>"We are proud to have found a partner in Mindway AI that has specialized in gambling risk detection and incorporates scientific aspects such as neuroscience and psychology into its product development, in addition to innovative technologies such as AI."</p>
<p>Zeal is excited to have the opportunity to improve its level of commitment to vulnerable consumers and make sure that everyone is having fun. This is further done by the GameScanner tool that Mindway AI will readily deploy across the platform.</p>
<p>The fully automated GameScanner may not need human control to collect and process the data, but valuable human inputcan help companies, including Zeal, steer a strategy that will enable it to always be one ahead of a potential gambling-related problem.</p>
<p>MindwayAICEO Rasmus Kjaergaard hailed Zeal’s proactive and forward-thinking approach toward the industry as a whole. Kjaergaard argued that even though lotteries have a very low chance of triggering a gambling addiction, it was entirely to Zeal’s credit for making this preemptive decision.</p>
<p>The executive assured that MindwayAI is fully capable of delivering powerful AI-driven insights into human psychology and helping improve and understand problem gambling across every gambling vertical, whether this is the lottery or online casinos.</p>
