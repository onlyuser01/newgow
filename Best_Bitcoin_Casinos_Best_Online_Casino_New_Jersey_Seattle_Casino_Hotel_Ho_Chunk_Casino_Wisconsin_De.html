<p>Caesars Sportsbook at Raynham Park will open a temporary location in the spring before opening the permanent sportsbook later in the year</p>
<p>Caesars Entertainment announced that starting today fans of sports betting in Massachusetts can download the Caesars Sportsbook app and take advantage of a special early sign-up offer.</p>
<p>Mobile and Retail Sportsbook</p>
<p>The launch of the Caesars Sportsbook app is offering bettors a glimpse of its functionalities, including a variety of deposit and payout options, user-friendly wagering features, lightning-fast scoreboards, expanded in-play betting menu, same-game parlays, and thousands of additional markets.</p>
<p>“The launch of our mobile app is an excellent complement to the planned Caesars Sportsbook at historic Raynham Park,” commented the president of Caesars Digital, Eric Hession, confident that “this combination will deliver the most rewarding sports wagering experience in the Commonwealth” and allow the company to live to its motto by treating “all sports fans like royalty.”</p>
<p>Caesars Entertainment and Raynham Park teamed up last month with plans to open one of the biggest sports betting destinations nationwide, and once approved by the Massachusetts Gaming Commission, Caesars Sportsbook at Raynham Park will become one of the largest free-standing race and pari-mutuel simulcasting establishments in the US. The partners are planning to open a temporary sportsbook this spring before being able to offer their permanent retail sportsbook later this year.</p>
<p>Massachusetts residents who elect to wager with the Caesars Sportsbook will gain access to the operator’s industry-leading rewards loyalty program, Caesars Rewards, earning Tier Credits with every wager they place.</p>
<p>By converting Tier Credits into Reward Credits, bettors will then be able to exchange their play for extraordinary experiences at various Caesars’ destinations in the US, bonus cash in the Caesars Sportsbook app and world-class culinary experiences.</p>
<p>Early Sign-Up Bonus Available</p>
<p>To celebrate the launch of the Caesars Sportsbook app in Massachusetts and to entice bettors to its sports betting offering, the operator is offering residents in the Bay State an early sign-up bonus of $100 in Bonus Bets.</p>
<p>The bonus money will be split into four equal parts with the first $25 for betting available on the day Massachusetts goes live, and the remaining three given on a weekly basis thereafter.</p>
<p>The app is also providing its users with tools such as Deposit Limits, Spending Limits, Daily Time Limits, and Cool Off Time Limits to allow them to stay in control of their play and affirm Caesars’ commitment to responsible gaming.</p>
<p>True to its purpose to keep its customers educated, Caesars Sportsbook teamed with Covers.com ahead of Super Bowl LVII for the latest episode of the Sharp 600 podcast, placing the focus on game lines and player props as these were expected to participate heavily during the game.</p>
