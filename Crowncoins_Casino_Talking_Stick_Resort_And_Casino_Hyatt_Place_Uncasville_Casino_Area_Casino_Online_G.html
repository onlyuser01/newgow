    <h1>Crowncoins Casino Talking Stick Resort And Casino Hyatt Place Uncasville Casino Area Casino Online G</h1>

<p>Dear Viliam,</p>
<p>Please see respond to your questions.</p>
<p>You have paid 10k to the player and he played out the rest of his balance? Yes this is correct because client was advised about our T&amp;C’s regarding weekly limits and that the funds (balance will be reversed back to the account) this player was fully aware off. He also when creating the account confirmed that he understand the T&amp;C’s</p>
<p>You've locked his account because he violated T&amp;C's? The account has been locked because of the following statement made by player ( I am trying to understand where all my pending withdrawals are, there is also some suspicious deposits from my bank account that I have also not made....Is it possible my account has been accessed by an online hacker and how do I go about getting my account refunded...I clearly stated in an email to management that I did not want that withdrawal reversed back into my account very clearly for this reason..I am breifing this matter because I believe my account has been hacked" )</p>
<p>Due to this statement we had to close the account because we are not only dealing with players withdrawal query of which he was advised about the T&amp;C’s. We now had to deal with unauthorized deposits query and possible compromised account claim by player. Now our process is clear that we lock the account to further investigate. I believe that the clients withdrawal issue is now considered close because this was the complaint Casino Guru had to intervene and not the deposit and hacked account query</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>Levi</p>
