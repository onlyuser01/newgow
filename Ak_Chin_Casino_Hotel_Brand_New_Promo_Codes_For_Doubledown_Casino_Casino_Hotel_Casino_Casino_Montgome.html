<p>Bally’s Corporation announced a new deal with Major League Fishing earlier this week.</p>
<p>Major League Fishing and Bally’s Ink New Agreement</p>
<p>The leading US omni-channel provider of land-based gaming and interactive entertainment, Bally’s Corporation, inked a new groundbreaking deal with Major League Fishing (MLF), the world’s largest tournament-fishing organization.</p>
<p>The deal was completed on Thursday this week and made Bally’s an exclusive Sports Betting and Daily Fantasy Sports (DFS) partner for the MLF. Additionally, under the deal, the operator became an exclusive Free-to-Play (F2P) partner for MLF’s tournament circuits.</p>
<p>This marks the first such partnership for the professional fishing industry. However, this is not the case for Bally’s as the recent deal is the fifth sports betting agreement with a professional sports league. Before the deal with MLF, Bally’s inked other key agreements with the NHL, NBA, the Women’s National Basketball Association as well as MLB.</p>
<p>The Deal Marks an Important Moment for MLF</p>
<p>The CEO of North America for Bally Interactive, the company’s digital division, Adi Dhandhania, acknowledged that there are millions of anglers that are passionate about the professional side of fishing. He outlined that thanks to this partnership, Bally’s will be able to leverage its “sports betting, daily fantasy sports, and free-to-play games to enhance the fishing fan experience across MLF media and live events.”</p>
<p>“We know how passionate the millions of recreational anglers are about the professional ranks of their sport.” Adi Dhandhania, Chief Operating Officer of North America for Bally Interactive</p>
<p>MLF’s CEO and president, Jim Wilburn, added that the partnership comes just in time for the start of the 2022 season. He deemed the new deal an important moment for MLF while the US sports betting and gaming market continues to grow. In conclusion, Wilburn said that the new partnership will undoubtedly help boost viewership and participation among sports fans.</p>
<p>Celebrating the Deal, Bally’s Will Launch Two F2P Games</p>
<p>Under the new collaboration, two new free-to-play fantasy fishing games will be launched for the 2022 season. Both games are going to be powered by Bally’s technology. The first game, dubbed MLF Predictor Game, allows sports fans to make predictions for the Bass Pro Tour events. Correct predictions will be awarded prizes and the game will be active for the full season.</p>
<p>On the other hand, MLF Fantasy Fishing will be released in 2022, just in time for the MLF Bass Pro Tour and the MLF Tackle Warehouse Pro Circuit. The F2P game will grant fans the unique opportunity to choose a team of anglers for each tournament. Moreover, sports fans will also be able to create private leagues with friends and family. This will give them a chance of winning big prizes. Bally’s vowed to release more details regarding the two games soon.</p>
<p>Last but not least, the collaboration will make Bally’s online sportsbook, Bally Bet, a title sponsor of the MLF’s coveted Angler of the Year (AOY) Award for the Bass Pro Tour. The prize for this tournament circuit will be a staggering $100,000. Finally, the collaboration enables Bally’s to stream the Bass Pro Tour events via its applications as well.</p>
