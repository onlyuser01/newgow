<p>Stakelogic is continuing to grow its footprint in the Dutch iGaming market, having found a new partner in the face of Goldrun Casino</p>
<p>The collaboration further helps establish Stakelogic’s significant presence in the Netherlands as a tier-one provider of online casino content. Goldrun Casino, for its part, is a trusted and licensed local operator with a considerable reach and pull among online gamblers.</p>
<p>Slots, More Slots!</p>
<p>Goldrun Casino has found the right partner in Stakelogic as the company has long realized the importance of the Dutch gaming market. For this reason, presently the company has a dedicated slot studio that is working exclusively on producing content designed for the iGaming industry in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>Through a dedicated division, Stakelogic is pushing slots that are tailored to meet the needs and expectations of Dutch players across the board. The company is working on a number of different experiences, from the traditional classic slot machine format to innovative video slots replete with excellent mechanics.</p>
<p>The company puts equal heft on visuals and gameplay, and has been delivering a top-notch experience across its titles, including but not limited to Multi 6 Player, Bonus Runner, Big Runner Deluxe, and Runner Runner Megaways, among others. Stakelogic’s games are based on traditional industry maths, but the developer has imbued each game with a host of features designed to further intrigue and add to the gaming experience.</p>
<p>Goldrun Casino is confident that the addition of these games will help it exceed player expectations through the consistent delivery of quality products.</p>
<p>Dutch Market Thrives</p>
<p>The Dutch market has been a particularly auspicious one for suppliers, despite the strict level of regulation operators are held up to. Regardless, Stakelogic commercial director Jose Simon Kadala has welcomed the opportunity to team up with Goldrun Casino and help the company further engage with its player bases.</p>
<p>Kadala noted that the Netherlands was a market where classic games are particularly popular, but where new and modern gameplay elements need to keep coming in so that operators may remain competitive and appeal to new and existing player bases.</p>
<p>Goldrun Casino CEO Eddy Hultermans was similarly pleased with the opportunity, arguing that Stakelogic is what his company describes as a “must-have” studio in order to compete in the Dutch gaming market. It’s also precisely what Dutch players need and wants to see in casino lobbies.</p>
<p>Stakelogic previously launched with Energy Casino and Versailles Casino in other jurisdictions in Europe.</p>
