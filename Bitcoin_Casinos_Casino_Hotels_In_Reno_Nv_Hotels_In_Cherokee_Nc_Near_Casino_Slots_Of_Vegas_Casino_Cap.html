<p>Caesars Sportsbook launches in Washington State just days before Super Bowl LVI takes place, which is the most highly anticipated sports game in the US. After it managed to secure a license, the sportsbook partnered with Chewelah Casino, Muckleshoot Casino, and Spokane Tribe Casino.</p>
<p>Caesars Digital Co-president Considers This a Major Milestone</p>
<p>While speaking about the launch of Caesars Sportsbook in Washington, the co-president of Caesars Digital, Eric Hession, stated that the partnership with the three casinos in Washington is a very big moment for the operator. Recently, Caesars Sportsbook even released its prop bet menu for the Super Bowl.</p>
<p>Thanks to the fact that Caesars will debut sports betting at Chewelah, Muckleshoot, and Spokane Tribe casinos, the Caesars Sportsbook product will be available to residents in the eastern and western part of the state.</p>
<p>Muckleshoot Casino is the largest gaming facility in the Pacific Northwest and it will feature 4 live betting windows as well as 9 self-service kiosks. Moreover, plans on offering on-site digital wagering via Caesars Sportsbook are in the works.</p>
<p>Customers at Chewelah Casino, which is the sister property of Spokane Tribe Casino, will be able to wager at self-service kiosks, while Spokane Tribe Casino will open a new location within the property.</p>
<p>Hession stated that Caesars is thrilled to offer sports bettors in Washington the chance to join the Super Bowl action and said that the company wants to see fans enjoy the thrill of placing bets.</p>
<p>The Gambling Market in Washington Is Facing Some Challenges</p>
<p>At the moment, laws state that betting in the state of Washington is only legal at tribal-owned casinos. Apart from Caesars, FanDuel is also getting a piece of the pie as it partnered with Suquamish Clearwater Casino and opened a retail sportsbook.</p>
<p>Since betting is allowed only at tribal casinos, they kind of have a monopoly on the market, and some parties are not too fond of it. Maverick Gaming is one of the companies determined to disrupt the monopoly. It filed a lawsuit in January 2022 in which it stated that state officials have granted a “discriminatory tribal gaming monopoly” to tribal casinos.</p>
<p>Ever since sports betting went into effect in the state of Washington in September 2021, Maverick has introduced bills to expand gambling activities to its card rooms. It currently owns 19 of the 44 licensed card rooms in the state, but none of its attempts had any success. Now, it plans to resolve the matter in court as it filed a lawsuit in the US District Court, Washington, DC.</p>
<p>Eric Persson, the CEO of Maverick thinks that attorney general Bob Ferguson, the governor of Washington, Jay Inslee, and Deb Haaland, the US interior secretary are discriminating on the basis of ancestry or race.</p>
