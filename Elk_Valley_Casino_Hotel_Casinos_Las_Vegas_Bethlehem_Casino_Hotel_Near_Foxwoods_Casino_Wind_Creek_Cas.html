<p>As Ontario is already up and running insofar as its sports betting industry is concerned, other provinces are now deliberating their choices. Back in May, a new organization in Québec dedicated to informing legislative decisions and seeking to replicate the neighboring province’s success was formed.</p>
<p>The so-called Québec Online Gaming Coalition (QOGC) is here to try and reunite the efforts of online gambling operators and help push for a new regulatory framework for the online gaming industry that adequately addresses consumer safety, advertising, and responsible gambling, but also offers increase to government revenues.</p>
<p>The QOGC is hoping that through the addition of GeoComply, an organization that focuses on preventing fraud and offering advanced geolocation tracking for the gambling industry, it can introduce further safeguards and pave the way towards a licensed-based model for the gaming industry in the province.</p>
<p>Commenting on the new partnership between the organizations, QOGC’s Nathalie Bergeron said that the data provided by GeoComply will offer clearer pictures of Québec residents’ gaming habits and behavior.</p>
<p>"Their cutting-edge technology can help ensure safer online interactions for operators and users at all stages of the player journey, while achieving the highest standards in compliance," Bergeron added.</p>
<p>The development was similarly welcomed by GeoComply SVP Compliance Lindsay Slader who was happy to see that the coalition has chosen the company to help it inform its decision on modernizing the online gaming market while focusing firmly on consumer protection.</p>
<p>GeoComply has also been working on protecting Ontario as many residents of Québec try to connect and play in the legal sports betting market in the province.</p>
<p>GeoComply has been successful in foiling these attempts across the board and will now work closer with QOGC to ensure that it can provide insightful and impactful data that will inform the coalition’s decision-making process and help it push for a regulated framework for gaming in the province based on a license-focused model.</p>
<p>GeoComply has been a leader, and the company has been teaming up with brands all across Canada and the United States. Recently, GeoComply partnered with 888 Holdings to further strengthen the brand’s AML and KYC processes. Another company that sought GeoComply’s services recently was Prophet Exchange.</p>
<p>Many of the companies that are part of the QOGC are also partnering with GeoComply individually.</p>
