<p>Playson, a leading game developer of cutting-edge slots has inked a deal with the Bulgarian operator Inbet. As per the agreement, the provider will supply Inbet with a collection of hit slots titles.</p>
<p>Playson to Provide Inbet with Games</p>
<p>Inbet will receive some of Playson’s best digital games, including Divine Dragon: Hold and Win, Stars &amp; Fruits: Double Hit and Wolf Power: Hold and Win. In addition, Playson will provide the operator with some of its latest and most innovative features. This includes the renowned “Double Hit” mechanic that allows players to spin across two game fields at the same time. Double Hit guarantees a win when scatters appear across both fields, making it especially lucrative to players.</p>
<p>The agreement comes ahead of Inbet’s online launch. The company currently operates multiple casinos in Bulgaria but is yet to foray into the online market.</p>
<p>The deal with Inbet reinforces Playson’s foothold in Eastern Europe – a region where it already has a significant presence. The supplier is already working with numerous European operators and is looking forward to expanding its influence even more.</p>
<p>Blanka Homor, the sales director of Playson, commented on the agreement with Inbet. She lauded the Bulgaria-based company as one that is quickly and steadily growing. Because of this, Homor thinks that the agreement with Inbet is a “fantastic step” for Playson. Homor emphasized that Playson’s high-tech titles have proven to be well-liked by bettors in Central and Eastern Europe. She hopes that Inbet’s users will like them just as much.</p>
<p>Homor said that Playson’s team is looking forward to participating in exciting new projects. The company plans to continue expanding in Central and Eastern Europe and attracting audiences in the region and beyond.</p>
<p>The Developer’s Games Continue to Hit New Markets</p>
<p>True to its word, Playson continues to expand in Europe and beyond. One of its latest deals saw it expand its presence in Africa through a partnership with the local operator Kiron Interactive. About a month ago, the company also doubled down on its efforts in the Baltics by agreeing to power OlyBet. Thanks to the latter partnership, the studio was able to launch its titles in Estonia and Latvia.</p>
<p>As a leader in game development, Playson understands how important it is to have a strong and reliable team. Because of this, it recently enhanced its leadership team with new additions. In April, Vselovod Lapin, a long-time employee, was promoted to the position of a chief operating officer. Three weeks ago, the company named Nikolay Illiustrov as head of games. Soon after, Gambling News interviewed Illiustrov about his immediate plans in the company.</p>
