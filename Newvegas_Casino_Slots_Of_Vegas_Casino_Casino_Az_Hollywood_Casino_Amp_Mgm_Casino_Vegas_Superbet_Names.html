<p>Jokić added that he appreciates Superbet’s commitment to responsible gambling and praised the company’s safer gambling-oriented initiatives. According to the basketball pro, this was one of the things that convinced him to team up with the brand.</p>
<p>Jokić concluded that he is looking forward to working with Superbet and promoting sustainable sports betting. He teased that he cannot wait to work on exclusive activations with the brand and engage fans in Serbia and beyond.</p>
<p>Thanassis Kanouris, Superbet’s country manager for Serbia, also commented on the matter, welcoming Jokić to the Superbet family. According to Kanouris, Jokić is an amazing athlete and a great team player whose qualities perfectly reflect Superbet’s core values.</p>
