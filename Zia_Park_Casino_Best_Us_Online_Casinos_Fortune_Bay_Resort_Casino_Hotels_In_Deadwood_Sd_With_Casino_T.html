<p>The technology-driven sports betting monitoring company that offers protection against betting fraud, US Integrity, announced a new partnership with Gold Rush Gaming, a licensed gaming operator.</p>
<p>US Integrity Joins Forces with Gold Rush Gaming in Ohio</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the duo unveiled their comprehensive partnership which comes just ahead of the planned launch of sports betting in Ohio. The new deal will see US Integrity provide its leading monitoring services for Gold Rush Gaming. This collaboration will boost the integrity of the company’s operations as it launches its sports betting kiosks in retail locations once the market in Ohio opens.</p>
<p>US Integrity’s leading technology helps flag irregular betting patterns by analyzing multiple data streams. Thanks to the company’s leading solutions, operators can flag suspicious wagers and identify attempts for match-fixing or fraud.</p>
<p>“US Integrity will provide integrity monitoring services via its proprietary dashboard to Gold Rush Gaming. US Integrity conducts analysis across dozens of data sets to proactively identify irregular officiating and wagering patterns,“ explained US Integrity</p>
<p>To launch its services in Ohio, Gold Rush Gaming had to secure a license from the gambling regulator in the state. Only recently, the operator was awarded a Type C Proprietor license which enables it to operate sports wagering kiosks within locations that meet a specific criterion around Ohio. In addition, Gold Rush Gaming is also the third-largest Class 3 Route Gaming company in Illinois, the home state of the operator.</p>
<p>The Deal Boosts Gold Rush Gaming’s Sports Betting Integrity</p>
<p>Matthew Holt, US Integrity’s CEO and co-founder said that the company is delighted to join forces with Gold Rush just before Ohio launches its sports betting market. He explained that a main goal for the company is to “provide conflict-free, best-in-class insights and compliance solutions” for its growing portfolio of clients. Holt acknowledged that Gold Rush supports the highest integrity standard without any doubt. Finally, he said that US Integrity will provide its leading solutions that safeguard the integrity of betting and make it safer.</p>
<p>“US Integrity is proud to partner with Gold Rush Gaming ahead of the launch of sports betting in Ohio.“ Matthew Holt, CEO and co-founder at US Integrity</p>
<p>On the other hand, Ron Bolger, the director of operations at Gold Rush, added that the company is excited to team up with US Integrity. He acknowledged that the new collaboration will help flag “betting abnormalities in real-time,” identify them and create a more safe and more fun experience for sports betting fans in Ohio.</p>
