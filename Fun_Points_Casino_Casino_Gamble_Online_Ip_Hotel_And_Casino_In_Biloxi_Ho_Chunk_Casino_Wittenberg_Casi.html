<p>William Hill may have only targeted sports betting for decades, but not anymore. The gaming ecosystem is evolving and the operator is evolving with it. William Hill previously stepped into the online casino segment and is expanding its activity. It has announced that it has teamed up with Real Dealer Studios in order to bring the games of the developer to William Hill customers this year.</p>
<p>This deal will see five titles from Real Dealer Studios' portfolio go live on both the William Hill casino and Mr Green casinos brands in January and February. Customers of the.com or.uk websites will first be able to access the games.</p>
<p>Real Roulette with Sarati and Real Baccarat With Courtney, Real Fortune Finder With Holly, Real Auto Roulette, Multifire Auto Roulette and Real Baccarat are the five new games.</p>
<p>Real Dealer Studios is well-known for its professional actors portraying the role of dealers. The characters are often specific to each country, allowing them to create engaging and relevant content in every market.</p>
<p>Real Dealer's line-up also features recorded video of their games that was captured in the studio. All games feature high-quality video and audio. This allows them to create a personalized casino experience for players without the delay and noise associated with Live Casino products.</p>
<p>Real Dealer's unique approach to casino games can be already experienced by players. The first title was released at William Hill on January 6.</p>
<p>Richard Atkinson, the Global Head of Live Casino for William Hill Group, stated, "William Hill Group are delighted to partner with Real Dealer Studios to expand our portfolio of top content for customers and we're very much looking forward to debuting their games on our network in the coming weeks."</p>
<p>Mr Green and William Hill are sites that have a large market presence in the UK. William Hill can strengthen the Real Dealer brand and share a selection of top titles with new audiences, who may not be familiar with the company's unique way to do things.</p>
<p>Shane Cotter, Chief Product Officer at Real Dealer Studios, added, "2021 was an incredibly successful year for Real Dealer Studios and we're really happy to be carrying that momentum into 2022 by announcing our new partnership with the William Hill Group."</p>
