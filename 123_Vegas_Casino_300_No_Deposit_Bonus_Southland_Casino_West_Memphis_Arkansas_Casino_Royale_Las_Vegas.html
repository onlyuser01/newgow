    <h1>123 Vegas Casino 300 No Deposit Bonus Southland Casino West Memphis Arkansas Casino Royale Las Vegas</h1>

<p>Blackjack fans in Pennsylvania are in for a treat after the Borgata Casino and BetMGM launched a new special promotion. The two venues have launched a $25,000 blackjack leaderboard promo that holds prizes for the top 200 participants.</p>
<p>The $25,000 Blackjack Leaderboard Promotion</p>
<p>Last week, BetMGM and Borgata Casino in Pennsylvania launched a big blackjack leaderboard. The $25,000 blackjack leaderboard special promo launched on May 27 and will run through June 3. Everyone who wishes to participate in the promotion can do so by using an active BetMGM or Borgata Casino Pennsylvania account.</p>
<p>The promo is valid for electronic blackjack games meaning that live dealer blackjack games do not accumulate points on the leaderboard. In other words, players that want to play live dealer blackjack games can do so, but their wagers won’t bring points towards the leaderboard.</p>
<p>Whenever a player wagers $5 on electronic blackjack games, they receive 1 point on the leaderboard. The $25,000 blackjack leaderboard promo doesn’t have hand limits or time limits. This means that high-stake players have a chance at ranking a higher position in the promo. Furthermore, blackjack players that play more may also reach a top spot in the promotion.</p>
<p>Prizes Await the Top 200 Participants in the Promo</p>
<p>A total of $25,000 in prizes will be paid out to the top 200 players that participate in the event. Players that rank 101 through 200 will receive a $5 prize, while a $10 prize will be awarded for players who rank 51-100 on the leaderboard. A $25 prize awaits players ranking positions 31 through 50, while a $50 prize awaits players with ranks 21 through 30. A higher prize of $100 awaits players that rank positions 16 to 20, while players that rank 11 to 15 positions will receive $250.</p>
<p>Prizes continue growing the higher the player ranks and there will be $500 for the players that reach positions 6 through 10. The player that reaches fifth place will be able to enjoy a $750 prize, while $1000 goes for the player that ranks fourth. The top 3 players will receive significantly higher prizes than the other players that participate in the event. The lucky player that ranks third will receive a prize of $2000. On the other hand, a $5000 prize goes to the player that ranks second. The grand prize of $10,000 will be awarded to the top player that generates the most leaderboard points and takes first place.</p>
