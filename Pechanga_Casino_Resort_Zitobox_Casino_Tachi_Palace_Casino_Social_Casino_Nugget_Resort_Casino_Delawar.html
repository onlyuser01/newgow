<p>For the second month in a row the Delaware Lottery, which is responsible for all forms of gambling in Delaware, reported that online gambling revenues collected in Delaware reached a record high. In August, iGaming revenue kept growing in comparison to the results in July.</p>
<p>Operator Delaware Park Remains the Leader in August as Well</p>
<p>In August, the total amount that iGaming brought in was $1.30 million. That was 37.2% higher than the revenue reported in August, 2021, which amounted to $945,512. August’s revenue also surpassed the $1.25 million that was reported in July.</p>
<p>The August handle for iGaming was $36.8 million, which marked a 69.6% increase in comparison to the same month last year. However, this amount was 6.6% lower than the $39.4 million that Delaware residents gambled away in July, 2022.</p>
<p>The most modest revenue contribution came from fees, including poker rake, which reached $37,169, slightly lower than the $43,944 collected in July. Table games did better this month than in July generating $221,330, which was 25% higher month-on-month.</p>
<p>Online Lottery games were again the clear leader with total revenue of $1.0 million. They brought in the same revenue amount in July as well.</p>
<p>In terms of total monthly handle, video lottery games accounted for $21.8 million, while Delaware residents spent $15.0 million on table games.</p>
<p>As in July, racino Delaware Park remained the clear iGaming leader. Its total handle for August was $15.8 million, while the actual revenue amounted to $558,272. Compared to the previous month this marked a modest increase of about 3%.</p>
<p>In second place was Bally’s Dover as it was the case in July. The casino resort’s total handle was $12.1 million, while revenue reached $412,044. The third place was taken by Harrington Raceway with the handle of $98.9 million and revenue of $326,657.</p>
<p>Sports Betting Revenue with 439.7% Increase Year-on-Year</p>
<p>Revenue from sports betting achieved extreme growth year on year. The revenue for August was $354,444, which corresponded to a massive boost of 439.7% compared to the same period last year when the reported revenue made up $65,678.</p>
<p>However, the revenue had a month-on-month decrease of 7.5% compared to the $383,249 reported for the month of July.</p>
<p>On the contrary, the sports betting handle results were the opposite. Year-on-year there was a 40.8% decrease in the total handle from $4.9 million in August 2021, to $2.9 million wagered on sports in August 2022. However, month-on-month there was a growth of 7.4% from July’s $2.7 million to August’s $2.9 million.</p>
<p>Delaware Park was also the leader in sports betting revenue. It collected $162,795 deducted from a handle of $1.4 million. Bally’s Dover came second here as well with $101,243 in revenue and total handle equaling $837,814. Similarly to iGaming, Harrington Raceway came third. Its revenue amounted to $54,472, while bettors wagered a total of $448,645.</p>
