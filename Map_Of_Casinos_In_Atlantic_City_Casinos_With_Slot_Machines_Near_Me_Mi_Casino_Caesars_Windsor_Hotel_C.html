<p>Real Luck Group Ltd. and its betting subsidiary Luckbox have revealed a partnership with Nuvei, a global payment tech company, which will help bolster the platform’s user experience insofar as banking goes.</p>
<p>Luckbox head of payments Boris Kostadinov welcomed the opportunity to be teaming up with Nuvei as the company’s latest payment partner. In a press statement, Kostadinov outlined the significance of the move for Luckbox:</p>
<p>“Nuvei is a leading payment technology company with extensive experience in the digital and iGaming sectors, and its extensive range of payment methods will allow new and existing customers a comprehensive choice of payment options when betting on the Luckbox platform.” Luckbox head of payments Boris Kostadinov</p>
<p>The integration with the platform allows Luckbox to deliver on the iGaming experience that customers expect, Kostadinov added. Nuvei’s payment solution will be used to significantly improve the available offer to existing customers. Nuvei’s offer has a vast network of payment opportunities that span 150 currencies and 40 cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>Nuvei chair and CEO Philip Fayer has welcomed the partnership with Luckbox. Fayer said that he was happy that Nuvei would be able to land its market knowledge in the regulated gaming space to the betting platform.</p>
<p>Luckbox Continues to Build Up Its Momentum</p>
<p>The payment provider will work closely with Luckbox to help the company enhance its standing and offer in existing and emerging gaming markets around the world. “We look forward to working closely with Luckbox on enhancing its checkout experience by delivering the most relevant payment solutions for its customer base,” he concluded.</p>
<p>Luckbox has been strengthening its offer to provide better cashing-out options. In August, the company teamed up with PaymnetIQ, and a company focused on facilitating mobile payments. Before that, in July, Luckbox added Funanga to enable CashtoCode payments.</p>
<p>Luckbox has been successfully building up its product portfolio and offer. The company started as an esports-first company focused on blockchain and betting and quickly expanded its offer globally. Luckbox launched on the Toronto Stock Exchange in December 2020 and has been quickly scaling up its resources to introduce iGaming and traditional sports betting.</p>
<p>To reflect this change of strategy, Luckbox brought former EA executive Thomas Rosander in February, who was promoted to a chief executive, succeeding Quentin Martin in May.</p>
