    <h1>Casinos Near Indianapolis Vegas Gems Casino Lightning Link Casino Planet Hollywood Resort And Casino</h1>

<p>Registered at the casino in May 2022 and made a small deposit (30EUR), lost. Deposited again in February, lost.</p>
<p>A total of about 200 euros paid in and "won" for the first time, a minimum amount of 30 euros became 60.</p>
<p>The casino refuses to pay out this minimum amount even though I answered a huge questionnaire about job etc. by email, "extended verification". The problem is that I used my wife's Paysafecard account for ONE of the deposits because she still had credit there and I don't have a Paysafecard account myself.</p>
<p>I sent the marriage certificate and all sorts of things to the casino unsolicited. Here in Switzerland it is legal (as in many other countries) so that spouses are jointly entitled to each other's assets and it makes no difference. I was not aware that this should be forbidden and I assured the casino that it would not happen again and just sent all the documents.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, despite all efforts, the casino refuses to pay out this minimum amount and has confiscated it. My statement that the 3 deposits from that day (3x 30 EUR) should be refunded to me was not answered. Neither does the casino return the deposits, nor does it pay out the mini amount. This decision was made by the "manager", further escalation by e-mail is unfortunately not possible.</p>
<p>Esteemed CasinoGuru team, I kindly ask for your very much appreciated mediation that a solution is found here with the casino and they make an exception to your rule and pay out the amount. The company "N1" is a large provider with countless casinos and I also use them regularly, have never had any problems with the company and just don't think it's fair to act like this here. It was a small mistake and it is the case here that you jointly own everything that concerns the accounts with your spouse. For me it is natural to use the woman's accounts and she also uses mine - that it violated the casino rules came as a surprise to me, since she is not just any acquaintance.</p>
<p>I think the casino can easily make a "goodwill" decision here given the small amount and that I'm in the red overall and leave with a warning or alternatively just refund the deposits from the day.</p>
<p>I am attaching transaction history and the email rejection plus the XXXXXXXL questions ðŸ™‚</p>
<p>thank you very much</p>
