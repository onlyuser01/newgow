<p>Hello Casino Guru team,</p>
<p>Thank you for reaching to us.</p>
<p>We have reviewed it from our end and we can confirm that the casino management decided to close this account and void the winnings as per this clause from the terms and conditions:</p>
<p>" 1.18 Bonuses offered by Ruby Vegas are solely intended for genuine recreational players only. Bonus/Promotional abuse will not be tolerated. Player betting patterns and activity are constantly monitored and in case of bonus abuse, Ruby Vegas reserves the right to cancel, suspend or lock any player account found guilty of abuse as well as void/revoke any pending gaming activity and refund the original deposit. Ruby Vegas can also decide at its own discretion to ban any player from participating in Ruby Vegas’s promotions for a definite or indefinite period of time as decided by Ruby Vegas’s management "</p>
<p>The missing 40 EUR that the player claimed was not refunded from his deposits, was indeed refunded to his balance on the account on 13.08.2023 at 07.42 UTC.</p>
<p>The same day the player requested the withdrawal of 40 EUR at 13.08.2023 at 13.56 UTC and the withdrawal was approved at 13.08.2023 at 16.14.</p>
<p>The second pending withdrawal of 150 EUR was processed at the same time 13.08.2023 16.14 UTC.</p>
<p>I believe all the monies referred to on this complaint have been paid out to the player, and the reason of closure cleared out on this response.</p>
<p>We consider this case solved and closed on our end.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>RubyVegas team</p>
