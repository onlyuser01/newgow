<p>A top three betting and gaming operator in the US is teaming with one of the largest cruise ship operators to provide retail and mobile gaming to cruise ship guests.</p>
<p>Phased Rollout to US-Branded Carnival Ships</p>
<p>BetMGM, one of the leading three sports betting and gaming operators in the US, alongside DraftKings and FanDuel, announced today a partnership with Carnival Corporation, the operator of Carnival Cruise Line, Holland America Line and Princess Cruises, among others, for a phased rollout of its gaming platform on more than 50 cruise ships over the coming months.</p>
<p>Excited with the opportunities presented by the new partnership, BetMGM’s chief executive officer Adam Greenblatt outlined that BetMGM has found “an ideal partner in Carnival Corporation and look forward to providing” its sports betting and online gaming products to its passengers.</p>
<p>“This is another great opportunity for us to further expand BetMGM’s footprint,” Greenblatt concluded.</p>
<p>The partnership grants BetMGM the right to offer its branded digital and cash-based sports betting, and its real-money digital gaming products onboard Carnival’s US-branded ships while they are in international waters. Carnival and BetMGM will also collaborate on marketing and promotional campaigns.</p>
<p>Complementing Shipboard Casino Operations</p>
<p>Also commenting on the news, Marty Goldman, senior vice president of Global Casino Operations for Carnival Corporation, hailed the new partnership that will “deliver the excitement and engagement of sports betting and iGaming” to the guests of the cruise ships.</p>
<p>“Our two leading global hospitality organizations will provide a wide array of immersive digital content as a complement to our exceptional shipboard casinos.” Marty Goldman, SVP, Global Casino Operations, Carnival Corporation</p>
<p>While continuing to expand into new gaming markets, BetMGM continues to focus on responsible gaming education and is proud to provide its customers with resources available under its partnership with GameSense, a responsible gaming program developed and licensed to MGM Resorts by the British Columbia Lottery Corporation and integrated within BetMGM’s mobile and desktop platforms.</p>
<p>As for Carnival Corporation, the Miami-based cruise giant announced this week that a ship that is currently in the fleet of sister line Costa Cruises, Costa Luminosa, will become part of Carnival fleet in September.</p>
<p>The transfer of the 13-year-old vessel will be made instead of the previously considered transfer of Costa Magica, another ship from the Costa Cruise fleet, and Luminosa will begin operations in November, offering voyages out of Brisbane, Australia.</p>
