    <h1>Non Smoking Casinos In Las Vegas Southern California Casinos Casino No Deposit Bonus Usa Dreams Casi</h1>

<p>I don't know how streamers collect the info such as their current win/loss. My advise is don't follow them. The slot always lure you to bigger bet. Example when you deposit $1,000 and you played $1/ Spin all the way until you left around $100, and you start bet $2 or $5 because sometime you know you need to chase the loss. Fortunate during the last 2 to 3 hand, the "Revive hit" occur. and you may get back all your losses. This is the example to lure to bet bigger and better chance. The steamer also playing same method, they keep bet bigger. and always got better chance.</p>
<p>Regarding the RTP on the casino, I believe they are sharing the same pool. Example, player A win $10K, and player B account will be very tight and vice versa. Sometime the casino will ask some junket to play for fun and hope they win big money (They won't pay the junket but maybe only the turnover commission) so when the junket is playing, the server close for player to login and after they finish if they won a lot money and the real player coming in, they will start facing very very tight machine.</p>
<p>Many casino or online explainer said it's all about luck. Trust me, it's not I played for few years, I learn the map such as "almost hit" lure, revive lure, turbo play lure and so on. Sometime the slot is very tight, it will no payout and continue lose for 50 spins and which is not normal. It's not random.</p>
<p>You are right, after a max win, you are unlikely will get a big win another time. i got a 4000x win before and the whole night I keep lost no matter how I played. If you got a max win, you need to quit gamble.</p>
