<p>NeoGames will help EL member lotteries generate more revenue and maximize contribution to good causes</p>
<p>Provider of iLottery technology and services NeoGames announced it has entered into a two-year partnership with The European Lotteries and Toto Association (EL).</p>
<p>Efforts in Europe Did Not Go Unnoticed</p>
<p>The agreement NeoGames reached with EL was showcased during EL/World Lottery Association (WLA) Marketing seminar held in London this year and will see the provider of end-to-end iLottery solutions contribute as Level 2 (semi-premium partner) to all the major events of the largest Lottery and Toto trade organization in Europe for the next two years.</p>
<p>Moti Malul, chief executive officer of NeoGames, hailed the opportunity for the company to partner with the largest and most representative lottery organization in Europe, happy to see that the over decade-long efforts to provide iLottery technology solutions and online games to European lotteries did not go unnoticed.</p>
<p>“NeoGames today has nine EL members as its customers and we look forward to working closely with EL over the next few years, contributing to its key events and ultimately playing an instrumental role in helping its member lotteries advance their programs to their players, generate more revenue, and maximize proceeds to good causes,” Malul concluded in his comments.</p>
<p>A technology-driven innovator, NeoGames offers its customers a complete suite of products, including proprietary technology platforms, dedicated game studios and a range of value-added services.</p>
<p>Expand Presence, Receive Certification</p>
<p>The company’s iLottery portfolio was boosted by the acquisition of Aspire Global Group which also enabled NeoGames to expand its presence in sports betting via BtoBet, add content from aggregation platform Pariplay, as well as a complete set of Gaming technology and Managed Services.</p>
<p>Last month, NeoGames received Responsible Gaming (RG) certification from WLA as proof that the iLottery supplier had undergone WLA’s assessment and that the independent monitor had found the company compliant with the responsible gaming standards for providers of lottery services and solutions set by the global organization.</p>
<p>“NeoGames is a young and innovative supplier to the lottery sector and brings new developments and knowledge to the members of EL,” commented Secretary General of EL, Arjan van ‘t Veer, delighted to welcome the iLottery supplier as the organization’s new partner.</p>
<p>As the European trade body of national lotteries, EL has members operating in more than 40 European countries, including all members of the EU.</p>
<p>The organization brings benefits to sport, culture, social projects, research and causes of general interest and its EU members alone generate revenue of more than €20 billion ($21.4 billion) annually to state budgets and various programs.</p>
