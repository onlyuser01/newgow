<p>ZingSports’ innovative approach to betting makes it is an ideal partner for SB22, a representative from the latter company said</p>
<p>SB22, the first fully immersive betting and transactional platform that does not rely on any legacy technology, unveiled a new partnership agreement with ZingSports. The latter company is a sports betting operator based in Puerto Rico that will benefit from SB22’s products and solutions.</p>
<p>Under the deal, the supplier will provide its new LATAM partner with a wide range of sports betting options. Puerto Rican players will thus get access to many free-to-play and real-money wagering games.</p>
<p>Thanks to the deal, ZingSports will also secure access to SB22’s next-gen sports betting platform, which has tons of built-in features that boost player engagement and customer retention. This includes a Player Account Management module, promotional capability powered by artificial intelligence, an advanced betting engine and a genuine omni-channel experience.</p>
<p>ZingSports players will get to wager on a wide range of sports including football, soccer, basketball, baseball and others. SB22 offers a rich selection of wagering markets, including in-play betting and player props.</p>
<p>The sports betting offerings provided by SB22 are still subject to regulatory and licensing approvals, the announcement pointed out.</p>
<p>ZingSports Is the Ideal Partner for SB22</p>
<p>Jerry Foley, ZingSports’ chief executive officer, commented on the agreement with SB22. He said that his team is glad to have the betting platform as its partner. According to Foley, the agreement will allow his team to differentiate itself from its competitors.</p>
<p>We are thrilled to partner with SB22 and launch a modern and differentiated sports betting offering in Puerto Rico. This partnership will allow us to bring our customers the most engaging sports betting experience in the market. Jerry Foley, CEO, ZingSports</p>
<p>SB22 representatives also voiced their thoughts on the matter. The company’s chief commercial officer, Vik Shrestha, said that SB22 is excited by the opportunity to bring its state-of-the-art technology to the Puerto Rican market. Shrestha emphasized that SB22’s ambition is to provide clients from all over the world with betting products that resonate with sports fans.</p>
<p>Vladimir Jovanovic, SB22’s chief operating officer, on the other hand, said that ZingSports represents an ideal partner for his company. He praised the operator for its many creative ideas for fan engagement and acquisition.</p>
<p>We are looking forward to combining their ideas with our technology and showcasing our collective efforts. Vladimir Jovanovic, COO, SB22</p>
