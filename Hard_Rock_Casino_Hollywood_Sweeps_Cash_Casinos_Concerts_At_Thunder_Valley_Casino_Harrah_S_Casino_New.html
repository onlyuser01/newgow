<p>Evoplay Reinforces Exposure in the UK and Malta After New Deal</p>
<p>After recently teaming up with InPlayNet, game development studio Evoplay Entertainment inked a deal with Playzido on Tuesday, December 1.</p>
<p>Evoplay Partners up with Playzido for Content Deployment</p>
<p>Evoplay is on its way to break ground in more markets and reach more audiences, thanks to an exciting new partnership with Playzido, a leading distributor of iGaming products.</p>
<p>For its part, Evoplay has gained a strong reputation in the iGaming sector with a development centre in Ukraine, a portfolio of more than 60 slots, table and instant games and partners all over the world while offering customers the best gaming experience.</p>
<p>As a result, Playzido partners can benefit from a neat portfolio of Evoplay games that tick over nicely on both desktop and mobile platforms in six different languages and localizations.</p>
<p>Now Evoplay is making a push across the streaming and player communities but also looking to add to its outreach opportunities.</p>
<p>Ground-breaking Studio Associates with Contemporary Platform</p>
<p>The new deal negotiated with Playzido, a supplier and aggregator of online casino games, will allow innovative titles by Evoplay to be deployed across Playzido’s partnership network with affiliated Malta Gaming Authority (MGA) and UK license holders.</p>
<p>The platform is designed “by and for operators,” says Playzido’s managing director, Stuart Banks. The solution is capable of delivering high-end products to esteemed clients internationally. Banks is confident that Evoplay Entertainment’s content will lead to first-rate player experiences in all targeted verticals.</p>
<p>Launched in 2018, the experienced team behind Playzido focuses on values such as quality products and unique gamification options, encouraging responsible gambling practices and consumer protection, and empowering the user experience for all customer groups.</p>
<p>As both companies continue to improve and deliver on better products, more markets will follow, Evoplay has assured.</p>
<p>A Booming Sector Wants to Expand to More Locations</p>
<p>Evoplay Entertainment CBDO Vladimir Malakchi had a few things to add as well “It’s been a hugely productive year at Evoplay Entertainment, and we’re thrilled to maintain that success with a major partnership covering a critical set of territories that we will be focusing heavily on throughout 2021.”</p>
<p>Malakchi said that the company will look to roll out advanced gaming technology to empower the experience for consumers in all fresh markets and strike home with new audiences. A new generation of players awaits, Malakchi explained, and Evoplay is fully-prepared to cater to its needs.</p>
<p>It’s a new opportunity for Playzido, which already signed a few significant partnerships this summer launching content with leading iGaming operator 888 casino and the company’s bingo brands.</p>
<p>As part of that partnership, 888 players have been able to enjoy a number of excellent games, such as Atlantis Megaways by ReelPlay, Dumb and Dumber and Deal or No Deal Rapid Round by Endemol Shine Gaming, and many others.</p>
