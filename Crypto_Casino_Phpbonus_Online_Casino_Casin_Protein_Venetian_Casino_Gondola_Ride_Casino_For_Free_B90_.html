<p>B90 Holdings, an online sportsbook and casino operator, has announced its plans to acquire Emwys AB, a Swedish-based marketing company in the online gambling sector. The share purchase agreement was made with Funko International, and the total share capital of Emwys is valued at €3.6 million ($4 million).</p>
<p>B90 Holdings Acquires Emwys to Boost Pay-Per-Click Marketing Expertise</p>
<p>Emwys specializes in pay-per-click marketing and has focused on marketing online gambling services in Finland. B90 Holdings intends to leverage Emwys’ expertise to expand into new territories and drive traffic for its existing and new affiliate accounts. The acquisition includes valuable marketing tools, business contracts, domains, and administrative rights necessary for successful operations.</p>
<p>As part of the agreement, B90 Holdings will also obtain a short-term associated license and marketing agreement for Funko’s Google advertising account used by Emwys for pay-per-click marketing in the Finnish market. This license agreement aims to regulate the cooperation between B90 Holdings and Funko in generating and sharing revenues.</p>
<p>The transaction is set to close no later than September 1, 2023. The initial consideration payable by B90 Holdings is €500,000 ($561,625) in cash and €250,000 ($280,868) in convertible loan notes (CLNs). The remaining balance of the consideration will be paid on the closing date, subject to certain performance conditions being achieved. The consideration consists of cash and CLNs or the issuance of new ordinary shares in B90 Holdings.</p>
<p>Emwys Acquisition: A Strategic Step for B90 Holdings’ “Buy and Build” Expansion Strategy</p>
<p>Ronny Breivik, executive chairman of B90 Holdings, expressed excitement about the acquisition and said: “The acquisition of Emwys presents substantial opportunities for B90. It is a step change for our business both in terms of scale and operations. By acquiring new knowledge and investing in this proven marketing concept, we aim to drive strong revenue growth whilst continuing to generate profits from our existing marketing operations.”</p>
<p>Breivik also highlighted that this acquisition aligns with B90 Holdings’s “buy and build” M&amp;A strategy, aiming to scale the business rapidly by pursuing selective acquisitions and entering license agreements to enhance operational know-how and distribution capabilities.</p>
<p>With this strategic move, B90 Holdings aims to strengthen its online marketing division, which collaborates with online casino companies to provide them with marketing services. The company’s primary brand in this division is Oddsen.nu, a Norway-based community and affiliate website.</p>
<p>B90 Holdings, acquired the sports betting site Oddsen from Performance Media in September 2021 for $3.8 million, which was paid partially in cash and partially through the issuance of new ordinary shares. The strategic acquisition included Oddsen’s domain, business IP, and operations.</p>
