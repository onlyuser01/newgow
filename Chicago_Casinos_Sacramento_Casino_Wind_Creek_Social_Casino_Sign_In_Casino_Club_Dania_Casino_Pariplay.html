<p>Pariplay, a dynamic and innovative global company, describing itself as “the number 1 iGaming aggregator,” has inked a partnership deal with the tech company Wiztech.</p>
<p>Thanks to the agreement, the provider will reinforce its footprint in the Mexican market. As per the deal, Pariplay will power Wiztech’s Mexican gambling operator subsidiary, Winpot.mx, with its varied portfolio of games. Through the Fusion platform, Winpot will receive access to over 12,000 games from more than 70 of the best iGaming suppliers in the world.</p>
<p>The deal will also provide Wiztech’s Mexican operator with the back-office conversion and retention tools, available in Pariplay’s Fusion.</p>
<p>The Agreement Will Benefit All Parties Involved</p>
<p>Antonio Haua, chief executive officer of Winpot, said that he is excited by the opportunity to provide its customers with a myriad of premium iGaming titles. He explained that the operator is interested in expanding across the digital vertical to complement its successful retail operations in the country. The CEO is sure that Pariplay’s Fusion platform has everything his company will need to make its iGaming business successful.</p>
<p>Yoni Sidi from Wiztech Group is convinced that the deal with Pariplay will greatly benefit the online business of Wiztech’s subsidiary. Sidi said that the opportunity to offer thousands of recognizable iGaming titles thanks to a single agreement is a great step forward for Winpot. Sidi emphasized that great content is crucial to attracting more customers and is something that will help Wiztech and its subsidiary grow as businesses.</p>
<p>Andrew Maclean, the vice president of sales for Pariplay, is delighted to power Winpot with the Fusion platform. As a proven solution that has already benefitted multiple companies, the platform will undoubtedly boost the Mexican operator’s business as well.</p>
<p>Maclean also noted that Latin America is crucial to iGaming thanks to its budding market. He added that Pariplay is always looking for new opportunities in LATAM and is keen on maximizing its potential in the region.</p>
<p>Pariplay Continues Expanding Worldwide</p>
<p>Pariplay already has a significant presence in Mexico and Latin America as a whole. The company has ongoing deals with numerous local operators such as Codere, Caliente, and Virtualsoft.</p>
<p>Pariplay is owned by Aspire Global and has a global presence outside of the LATAM region. Some of its latest deals have been oriented towards the North American market. They included content distribution agreements with operators such as Skillzzgaming, Sportingtech, and Golden Nugget Online Gaming.</p>
<p>Pariplay recently reinforced its leadership team with the addition of Matthew Kelemen as a business development director.</p>
