    <h1>Cannery Casino Hotel Phone Casino Online Casino Nederland Palm Casino Fire Rock Casino MGM Vegas Cas</h1>

<p>Hello, thank you for your quick response!</p>
<p>I got the KYC verification all clear on either the 7th or 8th of January. (I initially submitted the first round of documents the week before Christmas.)</p>
<p>I made a $30 deposit at the end of October. The deposit came with a 400% or 500%, match bonus. (It's been long enough I don't remember the exact bonus percentage)</p>
<p>The last time I spoke with the casino was Saturday when they were finally able to verify my Bitcoin address (I tried the wire transfer at first but got the run around with that so switched it to Bitcoin) and the said it would go to final review. I sent an email back asking how long the process would take but got no response. I logged in with the intention of asking customer support but it said that no one was available on Monday and again Tuesday before submitting this complaint.</p>
<p>I understand that sometimes things take time. That's honestly not my main complaint. It's getting the run around and the apparent inability to answer a simple question. Each time I've sent an email I would get a response within 24 hours. (Most less than that) But now that you've all my personal information, you quit responding? That just doesn't set well. If it's going to take another month (while honestly that would irritate the shit out of me because come on it shouldn't take that long) it is what it is...just say so, I'll deal with it.</p>
<p>Am I wrong?</p>
<p>Thank you for your time and cooperation. If you have any other questions please let me know.</p>
