    <h1>Casino In Milwaukee Wisconsin Orlando Casinos Juwa Casino 777 Download Buffalo Bills Casino Angel Of</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have read so many reviews about how great Luckland.com is, which i totally agreed, up until today. Maybe you could give me some advice on who to talk to, what to do when a supposable reputable casino won’t give you your winnings. I have played here for some time now and am a loyal member at Platinum Level. Unfortunately and to my disbelief i was refused my withdrawal on the basis of, they said it has bonus terms and conditions, which it did not.</p>
<p>I was contacted via phone by the Casino and was given a free loyalty gift of $150 that was deposited directly into my real money account, so not my bonus account. I logged in and proceeded to play, I was over $8000 when i decided to withdraw. On the withdraw page it states what you are allowed to cashout as you well know i’m sure, that I could cash out full amount. I even contacted chat first to make sure this was the case. They confirmed that if in my real money account there should be no problem because its was not a bonus, so I could cash out full amount. So I proceeded to do so, in the Cashier it showed no wager requirements or no sign of bonus or anything. When I put in full amount it didn’t say I could cash out $100 or anything else.</p>
<p>I got a reply on email that they received my withdraw notice and it was pending. The next email i got from them was they declined my withdraw because i was only allowed a $100 cashout on a bonus. A bonus of free spins is only allowed a cash out of $100. A daily bonus up to $200 depending on what the Casino site has it at. Funny considering the gift was $150. As well there is nothing in the T&amp;C for this only that from time to time, they offer promotions and/or competitions which are governed by separate terms and conditions.</p>
<p>That has been a few weeks. I have emailed them a few times and was told they took it to senior management and there was nothing they could do. I think the only reason it would go to senior management is if my cash out was not clear and they couldn’t make a decision and I maybe won but they were not sure. This is the first email I sent them.</p>
<p>I have read all policies on this and have won this in all fairness. I am a loyal member and like Luckland Casino and am trusting in you to do what is right. Please use your CARE policy in this matter. Luckland may, from time to time, offer promotions and/or competitions which are governed by separate terms and conditions.</p>
<p>This free loyalty gift of $150 was not put in my bonus funds, it was put directly in my Real Money account, thereby telling me no restrictions. If it were put into my bonus funds then I would have had restrictions to adhere by.</p>
<p>The bonus was neither a free spins nor a no deposit bonus, which go by the $100 rule. The rule of Winnings received through the use of the free bonus (no deposit) or free spins shall not exceed €100. All daily bonuses are subject to a €200 maximum unless otherwise stated.. I got a call for $150 free gift, which is governed under different rules. This gift does not go by the same rules as free spins or daily bonus, they have there own rules. For a free gift it can be withdrawn at any amount as long as it is put into my Real Money account and requirements meant. Funds in a real money account have no restrictions other then the wager requirements. Please reconsider your finding on this matter.</p>
<p>Thank You,</p>
<p>Pamela T***</p>
<p>I would appreciate any advice you can give me in this matter.</p>
