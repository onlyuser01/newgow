<p>Bragg is delighted to roll out its new RGS tech and content with a leading operator such as RSI, in a major market such as Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Bragg Gaming Group has announced that its gaming content and solutions are now live in Pennsylvania thanks to an agreement with Rush Street Interactive (RSI). The former company, which already offers Spin Games content in the state, has now introduced titles from its in-house Bragg Studios as well.</p>
<p>Bragg Studios content such as Fairy Dust by Atomic Slot Lab and exclusive content from the Powered by Bragg program will now be available at RSI’s local brands, BetRivers and PlaySugarHouse.</p>
<p>The deal furthers Bragg Gaming’s NA expansion strategy, allowing it to supply content to yet another major operator. For reference, RSI is one of the biggest iGaming companies in the United States, Canada and LATAM. All of the newly-integrated content will be delivered via Bragg’s new Remote Game Server Tech.</p>
<p>The current agreement represents an extension of the existing agreement between Bragg Gaming and RSI, with Bragg having previously supplied the operator with RGS tech and content in New Jersey, Ontario and Michigan.</p>
<p>The launch of more content is a major development for Bragg, considering the size of the local gaming market. Experts believe that the local market will generate almost two billion dollars in gross win this year, which will cement it as the largest regulated iGaming market in the United States.</p>
<p>Bragg Gaming Group’s chief executive officer, Yaniv Sherman, commented on the launch of content in Pennsylvania. He noted that by providing RSI’s BetRivers and PlaySugarHouse brands with third-party content, Bragg will expand its presence in the NA region as a whole.</p>
<p>Sherman added that his team is delighted to roll out its new RGS tech and content with a leading operator such as RSI, in a major market such as Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>We are delighted to roll out our new RGS technology and content with a leading operator in a large and growing U.S. market and look to continue our ongoing work with RSI as we provide their Pennsylvania players with engaging content and a great gaming entertainment experience. Yaniv Sherman, CEO, Bragg Gaming Group</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Richard Schwartz, Rush Street Interactive’s chief executive officer, said that the experience his team has had with Bragg Gaming so far has been positive. Because of that, RSI is thrilled to incorporate content from the supplier into its Pennsylvanian offering as well.</p>
<p>Bragg’s content clearly resonates with our players and we are confident that our continually growing base of customers in Pennsylvania will enjoy the best-in-class entertainment experience provided by their content library. Richard Schwartz, CEO, RSI</p>
<p>RSI continues to diversify its content library. The operator recently onboarded games from Greentube in Ontario and Michigan.</p>
