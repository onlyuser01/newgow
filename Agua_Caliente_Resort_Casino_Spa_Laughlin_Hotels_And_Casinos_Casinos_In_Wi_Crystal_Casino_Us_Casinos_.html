<p>After two years of steadfast development and extensive testing, Poker8, 888poker’s new proprietary poker platform is finally here and readying for a global launch.</p>
<p>Poker8 Heads for a Global Launch after Two Years of Testing</p>
<p>888 has announced the global rollout for its Poker8 poker platform developed in-house and marking the culmination of two years of developing efforts, after the initiative was first teased late in December, 2018.</p>
<p>The platform received extensive feedback from brand ambassadors, players, and the community to shape what 888 hopes is the most intuitive poker solution to date.</p>
<p>Poker8 comes with a host of new features designed to enhance the player experience, including an improved mobile device interface and portrait format, as well as a new feature allowing players to quickly swipe between tables and play up to four poker games at the same time.</p>
<p>To keep the community happy, 888 has developed gift drops to populate player bankrolls with additional funds and offer a chance for surprise prizes. A special winner spinner game is already part of the revamped look of the company.</p>
<p>Poker8 is also integrated as part of the casino platform, another 888 in-house solution. The company hopes to achieve better synergies across the two verticals and integrate the solutions seamlessly into one another.</p>
<p>888Poker’s New Platform is ‘Made to Play’</p>
<p>Commenting on the fresh look and functionalities, 888 Head of Product Technologies Gili Brandshtein, lauded the team who has committed a significant effort and time to give the poker experience a fresh lease.</p>
<p>The platform focuses on a customer-centric experience combining existing solutions with product innovation, Brandshtein said. It’s a direct response to what customers need, he continued, adding:</p>
<p>“Through this new and intuitive poker product, we created an enhanced and unique user experience that will establish ourselves as one of the leaders in the global poker market.” -888 Head of Product Technologies Gili Brandshtein</p>
<p>While this is an official launch for Poker8, the platform has been teased and piloted across several markets in Europe since July, making for good testing time given the increased online traffic.</p>
<p>The platform was available primarily to the recreational player base during the beta, with some input from higher-tier players as well. Yet, 888 has been working actively to popularize its platform on all levels.</p>
<p>To this end the company launched the “Made to Play” campaign with the goal of boosting awareness for the product’s new slick and intuitive look. Yet, good looks are not everything that 888 counts on.</p>
<p>Strong Results for 888Poker in Europe and Beyond</p>
<p>The campaign will feature $1 million in prizes in a bid to cajole players into giving the new look s shot. Poker has definitely been an important vertical for 888 in the first half of the year. Traffic in the United States increased by 60%.</p>
<p>The operator saw revenue from the segment increase by 56% to $36.1 million in H1 2020. Poker signups smashed all records, with 103% more registrations over the period comparing year-on-year results.</p>
<p>Previously, 888 confirmed that poker enthusiasts have been significant drivers of revenue for the company. That is not surprising, argued 888 CEO Itai Pazner on the occasion of releasing the first half-year results, as the game of poker adds great entertainment value for the money spent on it.</p>
