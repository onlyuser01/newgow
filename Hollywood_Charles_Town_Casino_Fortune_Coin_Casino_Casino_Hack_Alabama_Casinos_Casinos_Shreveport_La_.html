    <h1>Hollywood Charles Town Casino Fortune Coin Casino Casino Hack Alabama Casinos Casinos Shreveport La</h1>

<p>Good day. Thank you for this service. I've been playing at FoggyStar for a while. I won and wanted to withdraw via EZEwallet. Then I was contacted there were problems and I should use Crypto BTC as a payout. I did that and a day later I had the money.</p>
<p>Then I kept playing and won â‚¬3'500 again and wanted to cash it out. The next day I get the message that I broke the rules and my winnings have been confiscated and my account closed. I didn't do anything differently and I don't know what rules I would have broken. The casino didn't answer that. Thank you for your support</p>
