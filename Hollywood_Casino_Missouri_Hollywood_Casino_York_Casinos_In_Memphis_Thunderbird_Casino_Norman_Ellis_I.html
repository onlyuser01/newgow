<p>Thanks to the new deal, popular titles such as John Daly Spin It and Win It, the recently released Mythological Mayhem Supreme Streaks and Armadillo Goes West will become available for BetMGM players. What’s more, customers of the leading operator will also gain access to The Lioness, a leading game featuring Amanda Nunes, the famous MMA Champion from Brazil.</p>
