<p>The unnamed 67-year-old victim was kicked and punched as two of the suspects stole more than $38K early Sunday in the driveway of his Mahtomedi, Minn. residence, according to the St. Paul Pioneer Press.</p>
<p>The victim won the money Saturday night at Treasure Island Resort &amp; Casino in Welch, Minn., about 42 miles southeast of Mahtomedi. Police didn’t reveal whether the suspects followed the victim home from the casino.</p>
<p>While the violent attack unfolded, two female relatives of the victim rushed to his aid from a nearby house. One of the suspects allegedly pointed a firearm at the woman. He ordered them to leave, or he would shoot them, the report added.</p>
<p>After the two suspects fled in a red pickup truck, the 67-year-old victim got into his vehicle and tried to chase them.</p>
<p>The unnamed victim didn’t appear to be seriously injured despite the kicks and punches he suffered from the two robbers.</p>
<p>Three Men Arrested</p>
<p>Eventually, local police officers stopped the suspects’ truck in Maplewood, about 12 miles from the crime scene.</p>
<p>Three Minnesota men were apprehended. The driver, Deangelo Romaine Jacox, 32, of Coon Rapids, as well as the two alleged robbers, Shawn Eric Lewis, 35, of Bloomington, and Tristin Tyler Jacox Mann, 32, of Golden Valley, face several charges.</p>
<p>These include first-degree aiding and abetting aggravated robbery, second-degree aiding and abetting aggravated robbery and aiding and abetting threats of violence disregard risk. The driver was also charged with fleeing a police officer.</p>
<p>Two of the suspects appeared in Washington County District Court on Tuesday. Lewis’ bond is $250K. Jacox Mann’s bond is $150K.</p>
<p>The third suspect didn’t appear in court on Tuesday because of a legal glitch. The Pioneer Press reported that the suspect wasn’t charged before a deadline for a judge to sign a complaint, so he was initially released.</p>
<p>He was arrested again on Tuesday evening at his Coon Rapids residence on a warrant, the report revealed. That suspect was scheduled to be arraigned in court on Wednesday.</p>
<p>It’s unclear if the trio were still in custody on Wednesday.</p>
