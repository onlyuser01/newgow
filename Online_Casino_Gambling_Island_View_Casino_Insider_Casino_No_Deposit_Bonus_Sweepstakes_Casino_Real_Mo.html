<p>The approach to warning gamblers may actually help with excessive gambling, a recently published study in the peer-reviewed journal Psychology of Addictive Behaviours found out. Dr Philip Newall, a postdoctoral research fellow at the Experimental Gambling Research Laboratory at CQUniversity in Sydney, Australia, based on a 2,000 sample of UK gamblers, concluded that if warning signs outline potential losses rather than winnings, gamblers would be more cautious with their spending.</p>
<p>Positive Spin on the Wording</p>
<p>It is common practice within the gambling industry to use warning signs with a positive spin on the wording, like for example, outlining the average payout in percentage, instead of highlighting the amount a gambling machine retains. Such a positive spin, the “return-to-player” approach, besides using the psychological influence of the bigger number, creates false expectations, Dr Newall claims based on his research findings.</p>
<p>The wording in the warning signs influence gamblers in the way they perceive the likelihood of winning, and Dr Newall who is currently living in Australia, is urging state-based gambling regulators to implement requirements for warning label contents.</p>
<p>“Across the group, only 40 per cent of those surveyed correctly understood the mathematical meaning of the return-to-player message, compared to 66 per cent understanding the house-edge message”. Dr Philip Newall, Experimental Gambling Research Laboratory, CQUniversity</p>
<p>The warning where the average amount a gambling machine retains, the “house-edge” approach, should become a standard requirement if the country wants to deal with the issue of skyrocketing spending on pokies post-coronavirus since the August re-openings, Dr Newell outlined.</p>
<p>House-Edge and Volatility Labels More Effective</p>
<p>The understanding of return-to-player messages was further enhanced by an additional volatility explanation that the statistical average is based on the long-term and may not materialize in a short period of gambling, impacting on player confidence, the study also found out.</p>
<p>Dr Newall noted the findings of the study based on a UK sample were similar to smaller Australian studies, as well as a recent Federal Court of Australia ruling, where return-to-player information on poker machines was ruled to be confusing to gamblers, prompting a review of labeling requirements in Victoria, the only state which currently requires warning labels on pokies.</p>
<p>“The findings illustrate what everyone already knew, that the current warning labels are confusing, possibly deliberately confusing, the way they present the glass as half-full – or even 90 per cent full!” Dr Philip Newall, Experimental Gambling Research Laboratory, CQUniversity</p>
<p>While the rest of the states must provide return-to-player information in a written form upon request, none of the states, including Victoria use the house-edge approach to label the machines, and Dr Newall believes a national move towards the house-edge message would help protect a large proportion of excessive gamblers.</p>
<p>For 2018-19 Victorian residents lost a record AU$2.7 billion at the pokies, up AU$3.4 million compared to the prior year, according to the Victorian Commission for Gambling and Liquor Regulation (VCGLR). According to Australian Gambling Statistics for 2017-18, the total loss per year is AU$12.5 billion, while in the UK is £1.8 billion, almost 4 times lower.</p>
<p>When it comes to gambling losses, Australians are the worst in the world and this will not change unless the industry shows honesty, concluded Dr Newall, who used to be a professional gambler and poker player before turning to gambling research.</p>
