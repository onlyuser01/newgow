    <h1>Betrivers Casino App Salt Creek Casino Casino Cancun Big Easy Casino Brango Casino Review Smoke Free</h1>

<p>Smoke-free casinos are starting to pop up from Colorado to New York. Still, some casinos try to cater to both their non-smoking and smoking guests by allocating dedicated spaces for both cohorts. Other venues favor banning smoking altogether and going completely smoke-free. Casino workers have also had their say in the debate. The fact is, though, that if you are not a smoker, you can easily look up nonsmoking casinos near you.</p>

<p>Indoor Smoking Is a Health Risk</p>
<p>Without any doubt, separating smokers from non-smokers is a good idea, however, smoking in closed spaces such as the casino floors can be harmful not only for the guests but for the employees as well. In an effort to reduce the negative effect of indoor smoking, casinos invest in expensive clean air and filtration systems. Such innovations help by removing the smoke from the casino floor, making the overall experience more joyful even for non-smokers.</p>
<p>Smoke-free casinos aren’t a new occurrence in the United States. In fact, smoking on casino floors has been subject to debate for decades. Recently, in light of the global COVID-19 pandemic, many casinos implemented smoke-free policies. This was not unexpected, considering that one of the ways COVID is transmitted is through droplets that are breathed out by a person that carries the virus.</p>
<p>Some Casinos Voluntarily Ban Indoor Smoking, despite Fears of Revenue Drop</p>
<p>Although in general, smoking is prohibited within public and workplaces in a lot of states, there are loopholes that allow smokers to carry on with the activity in casinos specifically. A major reason why casinos are likely the only places where indoor smoking is still allowed is the fear of the industry from a decline in revenue.</p>
<p>For decades the gambling sector warned that a complete ban on indoor smoking would have a significant negative impact on their revenues. In turn, that negative effect would impact workplaces, resulting in job cuts and layoffs within the gambling sector.</p>
<p>Despite such claims, the pandemic-enforced smoke bans confirmed that such fears may be unjustified. What’s more, some gambling operators decided to keep the temporary smoke ban and become smoke-free permanently. Such efforts likely made their gaming floors more appealing to the younger demographic while at the same time, undoubtedly having a positive impact on the employees and more importantly, their health.</p>
<p>More than 1,000 Gambling Venues Are Smoke-Free in the US</p>
<p>Despite the ongoing efforts of unions and workers’ rights associations, there are still many casino employees that are exposed to second-hand smoke on a daily basis. One of the organizations that want to prevent the harmful effects of second-hand smoke and smoking among young people is the American Nonsmokers’ Rights (ANR) Foundation.</p>
<p>According to ANR data, as of January 1, 2023, some 37.5% of the workers in the United States are impacted by secondhand smoke at their work. This data doesn’t specify what is the percentage of employees from the gambling sector, but in an effort to reduce the exposure of those employees, the ANR launched a project called Breathe Easy with Smokefree Casinos.</p>
<p>Breathe Easy with Smokefree Casinos data reveals that as of March 2023, there are a total of 1,014 commercial, tribal, and other gaming properties that are 100% smoke-free. It’s important to mention that this data includes some 148 Tribal casinos that are “operating smoke-free during the COVID-19 pandemic by their own sovereign policy.”</p>
<p>Which States Have Smoke-Free Casinos?</p>
<p>Judging by data from Breathe Easy with Smokefree Casinos, the casinos in nine different states are 100% smoke-free. This includes more than 130 gambling venues located in strategic US jurisdictions such as Illinois, Colorado, Maryland, Ohio, Connecticut, Delaware, Massachusetts, Alaska, and North Carolina.</p>
<p>But what are the figures for Nevada, the state with the highest number of casinos and gambling venues in the US? Well, out of more than 410 gambling venues and casinos in the state, only 2% or 7 casinos are smoke-free. Luckily for nonsmokers, from that total, there are four smoke-free casinos in Las Vegas, the gambling capital of the world. Additionally, there are two smoke-free venues in Reno and one in Fernley.</p>
<p>The list of smoke-free casinos in Las Vegas includes two gambling venues owned and operated by RK Gaming, Aces and Ales – Nellis and Aces and Ales – Tenaya. Park MGM as well as the Sand Dollar Lounge are other smoke-free venues located in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>On the other hand, in nearby California, there are significantly more smoke-free casinos. Overall, there are some 160 gambling venues in the state of which, 104 are smoke-free. This means that some smoke-free casinos in California are 65% of the total, which is significantly better when compared to the figures from Nevada.</p>
<p>According to Breathe Easy with Smokefree Casinos, in Florida, there are 37 gambling venues. From that total, the smoke-free casinos in Florida are 27 or 73% of the market. In nearby Mississippi there are 31 gaming properties, however, only 13% or 4 properties are smoke-free. Similar is the picture in Indiana which has a total of 16 gambling venues. Overall, the smoke-free casinos in Indiana are 2, representing 13% of the market.</p>
<p>Debate on Smoke-Free Casino Floors Continues</p>
<p>The debate involving smoking inside casinos has been going on for decades and continues to this date. While many enjoy placing bets while holding a cigarette in hand, non-smokers as well as employees undoubtedly are not that happy to inhale secondhand smoke. There are efforts that differ from state to state when it comes to banning smoking within casinos. Whether or not statewide legislation would address the issue anytime soon remains to be confirmed.</p>
<p>Alternative Options to Smoke-Free Casinos</p>
<p>The most obvious alternative, if for whatever reason you can’t find a smoke-free casino, is to gamble at real money casinos online. Ironically this is also the best option for those who are smokers that can’t find a casino that accepts them. You’ll be able to play casino games in the comfort of your own home where you control the environment and you will also benefit from the advantages of online casinos such as great welcome bonuses, more payment options, 24/7 operation, and much more.</p>
