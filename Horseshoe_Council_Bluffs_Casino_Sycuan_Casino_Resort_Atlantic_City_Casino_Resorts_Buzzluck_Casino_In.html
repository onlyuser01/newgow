<p>Turn up the Heat!</p>
<p>While setting foot into the mesmerizing universe of Mexican wrestling, players meet the three friends whose common goal is to turn into Luchador champions. While the trio never found the strength to compete at a professional level, they eventually come across a very special chili pepper that gives them supernatural powers and helps completely changes the game for them.</p>
<p>In Luchamigos, players are invited to join Join Gran Chico, Roco Elastico, and Muchos Salvajes, the aspiring luchadores who are determined to tear up their competitors using their newfound spicy magic.</p>
<p>As the game progresses, players feel the upbeat energy more and more and enjoy the vibrant and vividly colored experience represented by lucha libre, Mexicans’ wrestling specialty.</p>
<p>The game features cool and quirky symbols and an eye-catching background. It is also packed with excellent features that are revealed in time, as the game progresses.</p>
<p>Play’n GO’s head of game retention George Olekszy has expressed excitement regarding fans’ reaction to the game that “offers players some brilliant bonus features.”</p>
<p>Recently, the company launched Ronin’s Honour, another premium game with a similar traditional fighting theme in place for samurai fans.</p>
<p>Wilds, Power Chili Spins, and the Ultimate Hot Spins</p>
<p>The wilds in the game are represented by the trio of wrestlers. Landing at least one of these symbols while engaged in the base game together with a Chili Scatter symbol triggers the respective wrestler’s special abilities.</p>
<p>These include stacked reels of wild symbols, 2×2 Mega Wild symbols, or four random wild symbols popping on the reels. Each of these features can significantly improve the chances of triggering a winning pay way for cool rewards.</p>
<p>To receive the Ultimate Hot Spin, players must fill the Ultimate meter all the way to the top. When this occurs, players receive an additional Free Spin while being guaranteed a wild win through the symbol’s most powerful version.</p>
<p>At the end of April, Play’n GO released Gerard’s Gambit, an educative slot that tells the story of an adventurer called Gerard.</p>
