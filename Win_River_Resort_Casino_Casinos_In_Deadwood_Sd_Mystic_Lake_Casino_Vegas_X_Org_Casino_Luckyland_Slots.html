    <h1>Win River Resort Casino Casinos In Deadwood Sd Mystic Lake Casino Vegas X Org Casino Luckyland Slots</h1>

<p>Pragmatic Play continues to expand its reach in the iGaming industry and the live casino portfolio segment with the addition of Speed Blackjack. The latest live dealer game reflects the casino’s ambitions to create a one-stop live gaming product that strikes home with players and is their go-to choice.</p>
<p>Speed Blackjack Brings Unique Twist to Traditional Game</p>
<p>With the introduction of Speed Blackjack, Pragmatic Play reworks the original and adds side bets, auto-decisions, and a generally more dynamic pace of play that matches modern players’ expectations and preferences. The game is part of the premium segment that Pragmatic is building up for its partners.</p>
<p>According to Pragmatic Play, the auto decisions included in the Speed variant will allow slashing the length of the game by up to 30%, which will see more hands played and gaming sessions generally shortened if players so prefer. The auto-decisions feature is an innovative and tailored feature that will rely on a player’s strategy to achieve the best results.</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play has also worked on the visuals to make sure that the UI will meet the dynamic pace of play and guarantee immersive experiences. The game is streamed from the new Pragmatic Play studio, Ruby, which hosts a number of VIP and regular blackjack tables and uses the latest advancements in live game streaming to make it a reality.</p>
<p>Building a Premium Experience for Live Casino Players</p>
<p>Yossi Barzely, chief business development officer at Pragmatic Play, commented on the latest arrival and said that the company was very pleased to continue building up its product lineup. He congratulated the overall performance of the live studio product as well:</p>
<p>The performance of our Live Casino offering is a great success story, and we are keen to capitalize further on the luxury environment it offers. Yossi Barzely, chief business development officer at Pragmatic Play</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play has been definitely busy. The company struck a content deal with bet365 and the company went live with Casino Epic. The addition of Speed Blackjack is a reaffirmation of the supplier and developer’s commitment to multiple verticals of the gambling experience and delivering on spot-on games that are playing favorites.</p>
