<p>Aristocrat, one of the world’s leading gambling content creators, has unveiled its Dragon Link slot at the Solaire Resort &amp; Casino in Manila during a “Dragons” showcase event. The new slot is set to provide all players with a unique gaming experience and it will soon be available across the whole Asian continent.</p>
<p>Dragon Link Is Performing Above the Average</p>
<p>While speaking about Dragon Link, Ashley Fong, Aristocrat’s manager of product planning and strategy, noted that she was very excited when the game was unveiled in front of the customers and said that she’s confident that Dragon Link will deliver “sustainable revenue growth.”</p>
<p>Fong added that even though every market is different, Dragon Link was able to perform above the average across various casino floors and that it is among the best performers at a majority of venues. That is exactly what she wants to provide Asian customers with – a pleasing experience.</p>
<p>Lloyd Robson, Aristocrat’s general manager APAC, stated that it was truly delightful to showcase Dragon Link in front of the customers in Manila and stated that the feedback that the company received from the slot and its portfolio in general, has been excellent.</p>
<p>John Stevanja, the director of product marketing and strategy APAC, went on to say Aristocrat has built a special version of Dragon Link for the Asian market in order to suit the venues in this region. He ended by saying that Dragon Link is the “most configurable game ever built for Asia.”</p>
<p>Dragon Link launches on the MarsX cabinet, which features 4 additional Asian-themed games – Panda Magic, Golden Century, Happy &amp; Prosperous, and Autumn Moon.</p>
