<p>Resorts World, a casino games and mobile sports betting company has penned a partnership deal with the multinational online payments company Paysafe. The agreement will provide the operator’s mobile players with the ability to make easy deposits and withdrawals on the Resorts WorldBET app. It will also expand Paysafe’s footprint in New York.</p>
<p>Resorts WorldBET Adds Paysafe Payment Solutions</p>
<p>As per the deal, Paysafe will power Resorts WorldBET with its critically-acclaimed payment systems. The provider’s offerings have been available in New York since the state’s online market launched in January.</p>
<p>By implementing Paysafe’s solutions to their platforms, operators allow bettors to make deposits through their debit cards. The company promised that the payments will be seamless regardless of whether mobile bettors use Android or iOS phones.</p>
<p>The provider’s technology also allows punters to charge their accounts through automated clearing house transfers from their bank accounts. This same solution can also be used to help lucky players instantly withdraw their prize money from their banks.</p>
<p>The deal with Resorts WorldBET will notably see the operator include the provider’s numerous payment options to its platform. Following the deal, WorldBET players can also pay using Paysafecash and Skrill USA digital wallets.</p>
<p>Paysafe’s Solutions Will Improve User Experience</p>
<p>More varied payment solutions are one of the hot topics of the gambling industry. As more and more states launch their regulated markets and sports betting continues to soar in popularity, the players have started to demand quicker and more reliable ways to make deposits and withdrawals.</p>
<p>Darlene Monzo, the chief marketing officer of Resorts World Genting, spoke about the deal. She said that her company is thrilled by the opportunity to enhance fans’ experience with “the fastest, most reliable and safest” mobile sports betting experience. Monzo emphasized the qualities of Paysafe and its renowned solutions and said that she is happy to have the provider as a partner of Resorts WorldBET.</p>
<p>Zak Cutler, the chief executive officer of North America iGaming for Paysafe, shares Monzo’s sentiments. He said that his team is excited to power Resorts WorldBET and lauded the mobile sports betting application for the supreme quality it delivers to fans.</p>
<p>Cutler also added that good payment solutions are always welcomed by bettors and he is convinced that Paysafe will help Resorts WorldBET rise above its competitors. Cutler said:</p>
<p>“Given the strong correlation between payments and US sportsbooks’ player acquisition, we look forward to helping Resorts WorldBET increase its customer base and revenue in 2022 and beyond.” North America iGaming for Paysafe Zak Cutler</p>
<p>As a company that realizes the importance of payments, Paysafe strives to reach more markets and enhance the experience of bettors across various states. A month ago, the provider inked a deal with Hard Rock International, agreeing to power its New Jersey App with premium payment solutions.</p>
