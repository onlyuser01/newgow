    <h1>Wynn Casino Boston Orleans Casino Photos Casino Of Vegas Live Casino Hotel Philadelphia Catfish Bend</h1>

<p>Lucky Legends Casino closed my account owing me $10,000</p>
<p>My god I am So Distraught!</p>
<p>I wish I had read others before I accepted the no deposit bonus from this casino. That went ok and I did not win anything so then I deposited money and played and won nothing to brag about then I got a promo for free spins for a deposit of 15$ so I played that and I won nothing againg but was thouroughly enjoying the casino. I got a 10$ weekly cashback and I played through my requirements and then I won 10000$ yes I said $10,000.00 I then read the terms and conditions but there were no conditions because I had already played out my wagering requirements and was playing on my winnings. So I waited over seven days and then went into my transactions to see if anything had happened and I had a 30$ chargeback on my account. I thought that it was a charge for the withdrawal of 2500$ I requested. You can only maximum withdraw at a time 2500$. So a couple more days go by and last night I go on chat and speek with a really nice lady and asked what was a chargeback because I had no idea. She looked into it and said that I had a charge come back and that I was not to worry about it because they already took the thirty but I still owed 75$ and 105$ for fees for the chargeback and if I agreed, they would just take the rest owing from my withdrawal once it is approved. Those were pretty much her exact words</p>
<p>I was so grateful because I stupidly spent my bill money and food money on spoiling myself counting on my winnings . Never ever have I been so excited. Well now I am literally starving and have no tiletries or anything and telephone is cut off already, next is my internet and power. My own fault for believing in a casino I guess.</p>
<p>Anyway after that conversation I went into look at my bank account because I had some shady transactions and thought maybe one of them was lucky legends by accident may have got included in those if I did not rcognize the payment company. I already felt terrible and feared I would no loose the winnings because I would not have been entitiled to the 10$ cashback. Sure enough this was one of them and what happened with that one is that my bank pointed it out to me and my job now was to contact these companies that had taken money off my card without my knowledge and find out what they would do to fix it. I did not get a response except from Online Pay and of course I deleted the email like an idiot. But I had no idea that it was for any casino and the figure did not look familiar because I also did not realize that they took my thirty $ in american funds so it was a totally different number. Anyway the response I got from Online Pay without a word of a lie was that they did not put that transaction through and to get back in touch with my bank because the charge was fraudulent. I did this and do know that I sent a copy of that email to my bank. So my bank reversed the charge and made me dispute it and then two days later put the charge back on my account . I did not question it because I figured out by then that it was probably for one of the new casinos I had joined. I have to methods of proof of these transactions too. One being the online lineup of the transactions I see on my account which I copied for Lucky Legends and then my original monthly statement which I also sent to Lucky legends The statement shows only one transaction of the withdrawal of funds from my account to Online pay. The list I see online however shows three transactions, one is the original withdrawal that went to Online Pay and then there was a reversal of that, followed by two days later that charge being put through again.</p>
<p>So I did not have anything owing in reality and I talked to two very nice staff members last night who thanked me for bringing this to their attention and the lady told me she had passed the information onto the proper area and to wait a little while and check back.</p>
<p>So this morning I go to do just that and I have a nice little message that comes up when I try to sign in that says oops something bad happedned try again later and it has said that all day now so I am assuming it is because they do not want to pay me and are punishing me for doing nothing wrong. Now I have peanut butter I am eating with a spoon because I have no bread. I have no food for my dog and my bills are all unpaid. Great for my credit for sure .</p>
<p>How can they do this to someone. I am so distraught and really do not deserve this the one time I actually win big I get shafted.</p>
<p>I am disappointed in inclave too which is an identity verifying company because they do business with this casino and I trusted them so in turn trusted the casino that used my identity with them to sign me in and open my account.</p>
