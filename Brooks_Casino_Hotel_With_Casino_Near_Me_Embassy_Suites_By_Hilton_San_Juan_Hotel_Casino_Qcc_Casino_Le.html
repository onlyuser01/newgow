<p>PressEnter Group is set to move into a new headquarters in Malta which will host the company’s workforce, the group revealed during a press conference attended by the Maltese Minister for Economy Silvio Schembri.</p>
<p>Establishing an HQ That Reflects the Company Culture</p>
<p>The company is moving into the newly-built Ferries Business Center and will run operations out of several stories of the building in Silema. The facility is designed by DesignHub Malta specialists and has factored in Press Enter Group’s preferences. PressEnter Group CEO Lahcene Merzoug welcomed the move and had this to say:</p>
<p>“Our brilliantly designed new office is yet another step towards establishing PressEnter as an industry power player in a jurisdiction that has established a reputation for providing gaming excellence.” PressEnter Group CEO Lahcene Merzoug</p>
<p>As a result, the group expects to see an inspiring working environment for its members of staff and executives with a level and open-space structure in mind. PressEnter has insisted on a balanced “work-and-play” culture on the office floor.</p>
<p>PressEnter Group employees will arrive at a number of great additions to their workplace, including a fully-stacked kitchen, a dedicated games room, spacious working space, a mini-golf course, and great views.</p>
<p>The Group decided to consolidate its presence in Malta and shift its HQ operations in the country arguing that the country offers quick access to some of the most talented specialists in the iGaming industry.</p>
<p>Malta’s Constant Influx of Talent Attract Business Giants</p>
<p>Malta has created an ecosystem where regulators, suppliers, and companies come together to provide the world with some of the best iGaming and betting offers, PressEnter Group feels. The new office and HQ location also reflect on the recent rebranding where Betpoint Group transformed into PressEnter Group, opening a fresh chapter in the company’s ambitions and future growth across the world.</p>
<p>Schembri also spoke on the occasion of the ribbon-cutting and welcomed PressEnter Group’s choice to settle down in Malta, the world’s leading online gambling jurisdiction in his words. “I am certain that PressEnter has a successful future ahead and feel proud that they have chosen to do this from Malta,” he concluded.</p>
<p>PressEnter recently secured Rapid Casino to its quickly expanding portfolio of iGaming brands.</p>
