<p>The Kansspelautoriteit (KSA), the Dutch gambling regulator, imposed a fine against JOI Gaming, a division of the Dutch land-based casino operator JVH Gaming and Entertainment Group, over breaches related to gambling advertising for young adults</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the gambling watchdog unveiled details regarding the €400,000 ($436,300) regulatory sanction. Prior to introducing the fine, the regulator launched a probe into JOI Gaming’s operations on the Dutch market. The investigation uncovered that between December 8, 2021, and March 7, 2022, the operator sent out promotional messages for its website jacks.nl to its customer base.</p>
<p>Some of the recipients of those promotional messages were young adults, aged 18 to 24, according to the KSA. Currently, there are strict laws for gambling in the Netherlands. This includes strict regulation of gambling advertising as well, which all licensed operators need to comply with.</p>
<p>According to the KSA, targeting young adults is in breach of the Dutch Gambling Act, the main law that regulates gambling. Specifically, the regulator said that such advertising breaches Article 2, paragraph 4 of the Gambling Act. In light of the breach, the regulator imposed the aforementioned penalty against JOI Gaming.</p>
<p>“The law explicitly includes the protection of young adults, because they run a greater risk of gambling addiction. Enforcing the ban on advertising aimed at young adults is one of the KSA’s priorities,“ reads a statement released by the KSA</p>

<p>René Jansen, KSA’s chairman, pointed out that the law is clear and it prohibits gambling advertising to young adults. Moreover, he explained that back in December 2021, the regulator reiterated the rules for advertising. Finally, Jansen said: “The Gaming Authority considers it serious and culpable that this provider nevertheless focused on young adults.”</p>
<p>“As far as we are concerned, the legislator is crystal clear: no recruitment activities aimed at young adults.“ René Jansen, chairman of the KSA</p>
<p>The announcement about the regulator sanction against JOI Gaming comes after only recently, the KSA confirmed it plans to fight against illegal retail gambling operators. Earlier this week, KSA’s chairman unveiled that illegal retail gambling will be a priority for the regulator throughout the year.</p>
<p>Jansen explained that there are large-scale illegal gambling operations that not only do not adhere to the established regulations but also void paying taxes. Those illegal gambling operations represent a threat to the well-being of the customers, warned the KSA.</p>
<p>Besides JOI Gaming, recently, the KSA issued a hefty $1 million fine against Shark77. Earlier this month, the regulator said that the operator offered its services without a license to Dutch customers. Consequently, it issued a staggering €900,000 ($975,400) fine against the Malta-based iGaming operator.</p>
