<p>The leading iGaming software and sportsbook provider, Altenar, announced it forged a new partnership with the first performance-driven, content and technology supplier powering betting companies around the globe, Vermantia. Announced Tuesday, the new collaboration will see Altenar elevate its online racing entertainment via Vermantia’s premium racing content and data.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the new agreement, complete racing data and content will supercharge Altenar’s offering, resulting in unique experiences for its growing number of customers around the globe. The company will leverage the aforementioned data to enhance its horse racing offering and meet the growing demand for that particular form of entertainment. Per the new agreement, Altenar will power its operations in strategic markets such as Europe, as well as Africa and Latin America.</p>
<p>Currently, Altenar is famous for its extensive offering, as well as thrilling and engaging betting and gaming experiences. Now, thanks to the collaboration with Vermantia, the company will further propel the experiences it delivers for racing fans around the globe. Thanks to seamless integration, globally-recognized greyhound and horse racing events from New Zealand, Australia and the UK will now be available for Altenar’s customers.</p>
<p>The new strategic agreement with Vermantia comes after recently, Altenar announced a partnership with nVenue, an innovative provider of sports technology. Announced earlier this month, the collaboration saw nVenue tap into Altenar’s advanced platform. On the other hand, the collaboration enabled Altenar to benefit from unique micro-betting technology delivered by nVenue.</p>
<p>The Deal Is Expected to Help Altenar Continue to Grow</p>
<p>Spyros Stavropoulos, Vermantia’s commercial director, said that the company is delighted to join forces with Altenar in what was described as a strategic deal. “By integrating Vermantia’s world-class racing content, Altenar’s iGaming customers can now offer their players a top-quality live racing experience from international racecourses,” he explained pointing out that Vermantia delivers low latency streaming solution that powers the greyhound and horse racing vertical. Finally, Stavropoulos predicted that the collaboration expands Altenar’s offering and helps the company reaffirm its position within the growing betting and gaming sector.</p>
<p>“Our partnership with Vermantia solidifies our position as a leading iGaming software provider.“ Dinos Doxiadis, sportsbook product development manager at Altenar</p>
<p>Dinos Doxiadis, Altenar’s sportsbook product development manager, was similarly delighted about the freshly minted deal with Vermantia and said that it helps strengthen Altenar’s position as a go-to provider for the online gambling industry.</p>
<p>Additionally, he pointed out that the company is excited to elevate its racing offering with high-quality data delivered by Vermantia. This data, according to Doxiadis, helps Altenar ensure it offers its clients the “most comprehensive racing portfolio on the market.” Finally, Altenar’s sportsbook product development manager acknowledged the importance of the racing industry and its popularity among players.</p>
