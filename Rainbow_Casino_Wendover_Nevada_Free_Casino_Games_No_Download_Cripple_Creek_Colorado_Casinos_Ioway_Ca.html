<p>Luck &amp; Magic review</p>
<p>Theme and Style</p>
<p>Luck &amp; Magic is a magic-themed slot from B Gaming. The game is set in medieval times, where wizards, ogres, and monsters roamed the lands.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The Luck &amp; Magic slot has a very novel design. The game does not have a traditional game grid. Instead, the reels are presented as cards. These cards spin and then flip on each spin, revealing the symbol behind them.</p>
<p>Win in the Luck &amp; Magic slot machine</p>
<p>The high-paying symbols in the game consist of a beautiful princess, a knight, an ogre, and a wizard, with the latter acting as the game’s Scatter.</p>
<p>There are also hints of other creatures populating this world, with the hands of some sort of demon wrapped around the Ace symbol and other elements eating into the other card icons.</p>
<p>The game’s soundtrack is upbeat, giving a ‘ye olde adventure’ feel. There is also the chit-chat of a pub filling the soundscape, indicating that this card game is being played in an old tavern of sorts.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>The game has a unique look, but the gameplay is fairly basic. The slot has three reels, each displaying three symbols. There are only five paylines in the game, with winning combinations being formed of three matching symbols across one of them. You can find all of the information you need about these by checking the paytable.</p>
<p>Full paytable for the Luck &amp; Magic slot</p>
<p>You will also find all the controls you need to adjust the sound, set the autospin, and change your stake on the control panel beneath the reels. All of this remains unchanged when you switch to the mobile version of the slot.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The game has a solitary bonus feature which is triggered when you land three of the Wizard Bonus symbols on the reels. In the game, five cards appear face-down on the screen. Players must then select a card, which will reveal a multiplier that is then applied to their bet and paid out. The maximum multiplier in this bonus is x999.</p>
<p>There is also the option to buy your way into the bonus round, depending on your location.</p>

<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>Luck &amp; Magic has an RTP of 96.23%, which puts it above the industry average and means it fits the criteria of our slot strategy guide.</p>
<p>The maximum win in the game is 1,059x, which is not overly inspiring and is not likely to interest many players. The slot is considered highly volatile.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Luck &amp; Magic has a quirky look and design, but the gameplay itself is far from inspiring. The maximum win of just over 1,000x your stake is not going to get many players excited, and a lack of interesting bonus rounds means that this is a slot that you are not likely to be a hit with many players. A high RTP and volatility are its only redeeming features.</p>
