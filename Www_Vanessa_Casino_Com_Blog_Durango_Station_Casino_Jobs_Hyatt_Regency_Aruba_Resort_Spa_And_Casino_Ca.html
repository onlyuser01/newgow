<p>Despite falling $5.7 million below the October total, industry experts acknowledge it as a noteworthy achievement given the prolonged repercussions of the casino workers' strike</p>
<p>Detroit’s bustling casino scene faced yet another blow to its gambling revenue in November, marking the lowest monthly earnings in 22 years. The three major casinos – MGM Grand Detroit, MotorCity Casino, and Hollywood Casino at Greektown – collectively amassed $76 million in slot and table game revenue, reflecting a substantial 28.2% decline from their monthly average in 2023 prior to the workers’ strike.</p>
<p>MGM Grand Detroit Faces Revenue Plunge During Prolonged Strike</p>
<p>Although this figure fell $5.7 million below the October total of $81.7 million, industry insiders note that it is somewhat of a triumph considering the extended impact of the casino workers’ strike throughout November.</p>
<p>The strike had a profound effect on MGM Grand Detroit, which bore the brunt of the revenue downturn, experiencing a strike that persisted for the entire month until a resolution was reached on December 2.</p>
<p>MGM Grand Detroit’s November revenue of $30.6 million plummeted by 38.2%, significantly below the 2023 average prior to the strike.</p>
<p>After a 47-day labor dispute, the Detroit Casino Council successfully negotiated a historic five-year labor agreement with MGM Grand Detroit on December 2, ending the strike that began on October 17.</p>
<p>Nearly 4,000 union members, representing various unions, voted overwhelmingly in favor of the contract, securing substantial wage increases, including an immediate raise of $3 per hour and a cumulative $5 per hour over the contract’s duration. The agreement also includes bonuses, no healthcare cost increases, workload reductions, and unprecedented job and technology protections.</p>
<p>MotorCity and Greektown Casinos Show Stability Amid November’s Strike Fallout</p>
<p>MotorCity Casino and Hollywood Casino at Greektown, in contrast, witnessed relatively stable figures in November, with the strike ending on November 19 for both establishments.</p>
<p>MotorCity Casino, which recorded $25 million in gaming revenue in October, experienced a marginal dip to $24.7 million in November. Hollywood Casino at Greektown, on the other hand, exceeded its October revenue of $19.4 million by reaching $20.7 million in November.</p>
<p>In a surprising twist, retail sports betting revenue at the Detroit casinos reached a yearly high in November despite the workers’ strike. The three establishments collectively raked in $15.3 million in wagers, slightly down from October’s $18.1 million but a marked improvement from November 2022’s figures.</p>
<p>MotorCity Casino emerged as the frontrunner in this category, attracting the highest revenue and handle with $8 million in wagers and $2.2 million in revenue.</p>
<p>Calculating the overall impact of the strike, the three casinos lost approximately $51.1 million in combined revenue.</p>
<p>While this represents only 4.6% of the current $1.12 billion in combined gaming revenue for 2023, industry analysts speculate that this setback might hinder the casinos from surpassing the 2022 combined yearly revenue total of $1.28 billion.</p>
