    <h1>Fantasy Springs Casino Hard Rock Casino Cincinnati Hotel Palazzo Casino Las Vegas Hilton Ponce Golf</h1>

<p>Deposit 50 euros on 9/30/20 (I had already made deposits before for more than 200 euros.</p>
<p>I did not receive a bonus and I did not request it.</p>
<p>I played and withdrawn my winnings on 10/4/20.</p>
<p>Send the documents and they replied that everything was perfect.</p>
<p>On the 6th, apart from the withdrawal that appeared in pending status, they added 30 euros of balance. When I asked if those 30 euros conditioned me to withdraw my winnings and they told me that IF I said that I did not want them, obviously I was not going to risk 2,500 euros for a bonus of 30 euros. It seemed strange to me, I think they added that bonus to see if I fell and played it, but it wasn't like that and I rejected it (save screenshot of the chat because it seemed strange to me)</p>
<p>Today I asked about my pending withdrawal and they answered me that I have not met the bonus conditions when I did not have any bonus granted.</p>
<p>I copy here the text of the email they sent me:</p>
<p>"" "Dear Maria</p>
<p>As part of our regular withdrawal review process, we have seen that the terms and conditions of the bonus you received were not being met</p>
<p>The Bonus Terms and Conditions prohibit placing single bets, equal to or greater than 30% of the bonus value credited to the player's account, before the wagering requirement for that bonus has been met. (You can review the Casino Terms and Conditions by clicking on the "Bonus Terms and Conditions" link at the bottom of our site)</p>
<p>Therefore, we have canceled your withdrawal request and removed your winnings.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, please reply to this email or contact our customer service via live chat on our site.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
