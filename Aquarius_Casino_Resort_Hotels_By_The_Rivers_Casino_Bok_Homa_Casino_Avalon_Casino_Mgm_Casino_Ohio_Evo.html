    <h1>Aquarius Casino Resort Hotels By The Rivers Casino Bok Homa Casino Avalon Casino Mgm Casino Ohio Evo</h1>

<p>Evoplay, a supplier of excellent gaming content and many games, such as Temple of Dead, Rise of Horus, and Treasure Mania, has expanded its reach in the Netherlands through a new partnership. The supplier has signed a deal with Kansspel.nu which will allow both companies to benefit in their own way.</p>
<p>Evoplay will have the advantage of moving in with even bigger audiences, bringing them its cutting-edge gaming products, the company stated in a press release. Kansspel.nu, on the other hand, will continue to cater to its players by offering them access to some hard-hitting and industry-leading titles.</p>
<p>As a whole, Kansspel.nu is committed to providing Dutch players with some of the best gaming products. The casino is optimized for desktop and mobile play and offers exceptional entertainment value to local players. The product library will now be strengthened by the arrival of distinct Evoplay games as well.</p>
<p>"By teaming up with Kansspel.nu, we aim to expand our reach to the Netherlands and offer even more value to players seeking high-quality gaming options," Evoplay said in a statement outlining the collaboration.</p>
<p>The supplier confirmed that itâ€™s enthusiastic about the opportunities to introduce its games to even bigger audiences and in a competitive market such as the Netherlands. Kansspel.nu makes the perfect partner to achieve just that, the company believes.</p>
<p>Suppliers have been moving in quickly on the Dutch iGaming market, with many signing up partnerships with local operators. Among those are Stakelogic which teamed up with 711 in March and Playson which teamed up with Bingoal back in February.</p>
<p>The Netherlands operates one of the newest markets that is safeguarded by the Kansspelautoriteit, the national gambling authority which has been taking a stern course of action against bad actors, issuing record fines.</p>
