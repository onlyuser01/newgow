<p>Few could have predicted what’s happening in Ohio. The state’s four commercial casinos and seven racinos are on a heater. Gross gaming revenue (GGR) in the Buckeye State has now hit record numbers in four consecutive months.</p>
<p>In October, the 11 gaming properties won $169.1 million, an increase of 6.7 percent from October 2019. The haul is the best October in the history of Ohio’s gaming industry. Roughly one-third of gross gaming win is directed to the state in the form of taxes and fees.</p>
<p>The four casinos won $74.8 million, a year-over-year increase of 9.84 percent. The racinos won $94.3 million, a 4.4 percent premium.</p>
<p>Hollywood Columbus was the big casino winner, the Penn National Gaming property reporting GGR of $20.3 million. MGM Northfield Park was the dominate racino, win there also totaling $20.3 million.</p>
<p>Ohio casinos and racinos continue to be limited to a 50 percent operating capacity.</p>
<p>Merry Maryland</p>
<p>October is the month of Halloween. But it was anything but scary for Maryland’s six commercial casinos. Despite also operating at 50 percent capacity, the state’s gaming floors won $142.7 million, a year-over-year decline of less than one percent.</p>
<p>The state’s share was $59.9 million, with $43.6 million allocated for the Maryland Education Trust Fund.</p>
<p>MGM National Harbor once again led the way, the integrated resort casino just outside DC pulling in $56.6 million. However, National Harbor’s October GGR was down 5.5 percent compared with the previous year.</p>
<p>Maryland Live! once again placed second, the casino resort near Baltimore Washington International Airport keeping $49.6 million of patrons’ money. That’s a 4.1 percent bonus on October 2019.</p>
<p>Horseshoe Baltimore GGR came in at $17.3 million. The casino near Camden Yards and M&amp;T Bank Stadium continues to struggle, its GGR representing a 9.5 percent drop. Horseshoe was the biggest percentage loser last month.</p>
<p>Maryland’s three smaller resort-style casinos — Hollywood Perryville, Ocean Downs, and Rocky Gap — all reported year-over-year revenue increases. Hollywood was up 19.9 percent to $7 million, Ocean Downs 4.2 percent to $6.9 million, and Rocky Gap 10.2 percent to $5.2 million.</p>
<p>Regional Rebound</p>
<p>COVID-19 continues to impede domestic and international travel. For Las Vegas, a city that heavily relies on tourism and conventions, its coronavirus recovery is expected to take far more time than regional gaming markets.</p>
<p>Ohio and Maryland casinos predominantly rely on drive-in business. MGM National Harbor is one exception, as the integrated resort was built with DC business gatherings and exhibitions in mind.</p>
<p>But the gaming reports for October 2020 highlight a regional pent-up demand to gamble in wake of casinos being closed.</p>
<p>Ohio’s casinos and racinos were shuttered in March, and remained closed until June. Maryland’s casinos also closed in mid-March, and resumed operations in June.</p>
<p>Bank of America gaming analyst Shaun Kelley is forecasting regional casino revenues to be down between five percent and 12 percent this year from 2019 levels. Amid an unprecedented modern-day pandemic, that isn’t all that bad.</p>
<p>Las Vegas Strip GGR through September is down more than 40 percent in 2020.</p>
