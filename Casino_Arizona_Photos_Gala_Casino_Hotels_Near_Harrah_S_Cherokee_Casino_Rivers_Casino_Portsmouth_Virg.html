    <h1>Casino Arizona Photos Gala Casino Hotels Near Harrah S Cherokee Casino Rivers Casino Portsmouth Virg</h1>

<p>Dear JDavis5227,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. Do I understand correctly that your payments are still pending inside the account without being processed? Could you please specify how many days ago were your withdrawals requested?</p>
<p>It’s quite usual for withdrawals to take a couple of days or even weeks to get fully processed. This means that it may take some time before your money appears in your account, especially if it’s your first withdrawal. That’s why we advise players to be patient and wait at least 14 days after requesting their withdrawals before they submit a complaint. Assuming that you have completed KYC verification successfully and had your withdrawals approved, I truly believe it’s only a matter of time before you’ll receive them.</p>
<p>Looking forward to hearing from you. Thank you in advance.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
