<p>Social media sports betting platform Betsperts continued to expand its digital footprint with the acquisition of a platform dedicated to delivering breaking news and updates to sports bettors and daily fantasy sports players.</p>
<p>“The future of sports betting is stronger social connectivity between bettors and we are leading the way in building the destinations for communities.” Reid Rooney, CEO, Betsperts</p>
<p>The Largest Sports Betting Social Media Platform</p>
<p>The all-stock acquisition of Fantasy Life App announced by the crowdsourced sports content platform designed to meet the needs of the casual punter will see the combined company renamed into Betsperts Media and Technology Group and give birth to the largest social media sports betting and fantasy sports platform in the world.</p>
<p>“The acquisition of Fantasy Life App is a major stepping stone in providing our loyal users with advanced capabilities where they’ll be able to not just interact within the community but utilize Betsperts to grow, fortify and effectively monetize their sports betting following much like how influencers leverage other social media platforms.” Reid Rooney, CEO, Betsperts</p>
<p>Reid Rooney, in partnership with Austin Harper, founded Betsperts in 2018 to give users of the platform the opportunity to share information and content and help them grow into an informed sports betting community.</p>
<p>Upon closing the transaction, the combined business entity will hold a multi-million Series A funding round to raise funds and acquire new talent, add more content and technology advancements, while continuing to engage further with sports fans and bettors.</p>
<p>The acquisition of Fantasy Life App is expected to double the headcount at Betsperts Media and Technology Group and is projected to deliver a revenue of 20x Betsperts’ 2020 full-year reading.</p>
<p>Co-founder of the news and content platform and ESPN fantasy sports expert Matthew Berry will stay with the combined company as a member of the Board of Directors and will have a significant stake in the business as a minority shareholder.</p>
<p>“Community and the social fabric of gaming has been a huge part of my life and career. I write about it extensively and it’s what led to the creation of the Fantasy Life App for fantasy and DFS players.” Matthew Berry, Co-Founder, Fantasy Life App</p>
<p>Featuring more than 10 million combined monthly visits during the 2020 football season, the newly created group will leverage both platforms’ apps to enhance its capability and further engage with users by providing them with the fastest news alerts on the market.</p>
<p>“The companies are a perfect complement to each other and as gaming in all forms keeps growing in America, I know that bettors and fantasy players alike will continue to look to Betsperts and the Fantasy Life Apps for more ways to interact, educate and entertain themselves.” Matthew Berry, Co-Founder, Fantasy Life App</p>
