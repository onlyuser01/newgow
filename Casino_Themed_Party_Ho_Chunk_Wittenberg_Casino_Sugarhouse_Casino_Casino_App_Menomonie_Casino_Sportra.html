<p>Sportradar Launches a New Social Media Integrity Education Service</p>
<p>The sports integrity services leader, Sportradar announced today the launch of its new Social Media Integrity Education Service. The new solution is answering the growing number of athletes on social media and will help both athletes and sports stakeholders with multiple education tools.</p>
<p>Penny Del, Germany’s leading ice hockey league is among the first sports organization that has signed up for Sportradar’s new program. By organizing workshops and webinars, Sportradar will educate the league’s players and clubs. Tutorials on integrity risks when using social media as well as methods for protection of the players are going to be part of the new program.</p>
<p>“We are delighted about the cooperation with Sportradar.” Gernot Tripcke, general manager, Deutsche Eishockey Liga GmbH &amp; Co. KG</p>
<p>The general manager at Deutsche Eishockey Liga GmbH &amp; Co. KG, Gernot Tripcke said that the team is delighted to cooperate with Sportradar. Furthermore, he acknowledged that players and clubs are active daily to “make their own accounts as professional as possible“.</p>
<p>Tripcke added that the workshops would undoubtedly deliver professional advice on enhanced security in the social media environment. In conclusion, he stressed that with such knowledge “anti-manipulation” can be achieved, which is something that has always been important for the league.</p>
<p>The Sports Integrity Leader Continues to Grow</p>
<p>Sportradar’s head of education integrity services, Andrew Whittingham said that both integrity and reputational risks that may arise when using social media are “far-reaching”. According to him, failure to act with integrity online may put the users at risk of harm, threaten the integrity of teams, clubs, leagues, and competitions, or even the whole sport.</p>
<p>Whittingham added that Sportradar is excited to be working closely with Penny Del and complemented the robust approach which the organization is taking on social media integrity education. Furthermore, he added that educational sessions for players, referees, and officials ensure that all ice hockey participants “understand the individual and collective responsibilities they have to maintain the highest integrity standards“.</p>
<p>“We’re excited to be working closely with Penny Del and we commend the robust approach they’re taking to social media integrity education.” Andrew Whittingham, head of education integrity services, Sportradar</p>
<p>Sportradar’s integrity services expanded to include education back in 2013. The sports integrity market leader has seen tremendous success since then, reaching audiences in 25 countries around the world. More than 35,000 athletes, coaches, and sports officials in 17 sports have since participated in integrity education sessions.</p>
<p>In fact, last week, America East Conference joined forces with Sportradar to help educate student-athletes about sports betting integrity. Before that, in January, Sportradar extended an existing partnership with the European Handball Federation (EHF). Consequently, the company and EHL agreed on 10 more years of collaboration aiming at protecting the integrity of the game.</p>
