    <h1>Biggest Casinos In The World Hard Rock Hotel Casino Punta Cana Photos Hotels Near Gun Lake Casino Mi</h1>

<p>Symplify, a CRM and AI cloud solutions leader, has negotiated a new partnership with SoftMaya, a provider of online and offline gaming software</p>
<p>SoftMaya already operates a number of successful iGaming brands and brings market-defining solutions that help players access the most fulfilling level of gameplay available to them. The company is known for its Rock ‘n’ Reels brand.</p>
<p>SoftMaya to Benefit from Powerful Symplify Software Solutions</p>
<p>Each of the brands that run under a SoftMaya label solution, though, will now further benefit from Symplify’s powerful AI-driven Personalization Model. This solution allows for brands to swiftly adapt their offerings to their player needs.</p>
<p>The solution applies to both sports and casino lobbies and is a powerful ally in further streamlining the experience from the moment players onboard with a brand to the later stages of their customer journey.</p>
<p>Symplify is happy to bring what it describes as a “hyper-personalized” on-page experience that is based on both Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning technology. Symplify also integrates its products in a seamless and robust manner, bringing stronger communication and boosting retention and conversion metrics.</p>
<p>The company also has a dedicated CRM team to manage each of its operations, adding even more value to partner businesses. There is also the Campaign and Journey builder for further opportunities to drive business growth across the board.</p>
<p>The platform is socially responsible, which means that companies, such as SoftMaya, are able to benefit from future-proof solutions that can be used as the blocks of future success. Ultimately, the companies will seek to boost their lifetime value and greater customer sentiment.</p>
<p>Symplify to Drive Significant Lifetime Value</p>
<p>Symplify CEO Robert Kimber welcomed the opportunity to work closely with SoftMaya’s portfolio of brands and use this as an opportunity to demonstrate the power of the AI Personalization Module. Kimber added:</p>
<p>It revolutionizes the way in which we can understand user behavior and then positively adapt website experiences to meet player preferences. Symplify CEO Robert Kimber</p>
<p>SoftMaya marketing manager Will Parker was similarly pleased with the deal. He noted that the integration of Symplify was part of the “next-stage” of company expansion and that Symplify would help with CRM capabilities and AI to shape a truly worthwhile and valuable experience for customers from across the board.</p>
