<p>This partnership allows both companies to consolidate their presence in the Italian market and continue to deliver an unmatched experience to their audiences. Hacksaw Gaming has been able to secure a number of important content partnerships in the highly lucrative Italian market over the past months making the year a particular success for the supplier.</p>
<p>Previously, Hacksaw Gaming negotiated a similar partnership with another prominent operator in the country, NetBet.</p>

Hacksaw Gaming CEO Marcus Cordes welcomed the opportunity to see his company expand in the important jurisdiction and bring its product to local players.</p>
<p>"Italy remains a major focus for us as we continue to drive our expansion across regulated markets, so we’re thrilled to get another deal over the line with one of the country’s biggest operators," Cordes assured.</p>
<p>He extolled the virtue of Dork Unit, the first game to arrive on Eurobet.it, and said that the title was a humorous and innovative game with fast gameplay and a captivating environment. However, the coming months would bring more great titles by the studio to Eurobet, including some of its signature games such as Chaos Crew, Hand of Anubis, and Wanted Dead or a Wild.</p>
<p>Hacksaw Gaming has been certified to operate in numerous markets, making it one of the most flexible and dependable brands in the industry. The supplier’s products are available to in more than 20 markets and with top-tier operators.</p>
<p>As a supplier, Hacksaw Gaming debuted in Bulgaria with Inbet and pushed its geographical footprint with Betplay in Colombia.

<p>Hacksaw Gaming has achieved this in a short span of time as the studio was founded in 2018 and has been rapidly expanding its content offer and proposition.</p>
