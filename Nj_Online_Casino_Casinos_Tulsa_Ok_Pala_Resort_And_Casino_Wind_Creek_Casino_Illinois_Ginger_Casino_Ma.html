<p>Marcin Tybura Ready for Another Grinding</p>
<p>The Polish fighter lost just one of the seven fights he‚Äôs fought since the start of the decade. The loss in question happened to Alexander Volkov who beat him by decision. In his most recent fight, Tybura defeated Alexander Romanov by the same method. In fact, 11 of Tybura‚Äôs pro fights ended this way (eight were wins).</p>
<p>"I might not be a big mouth but I show it in the Octagon. I'm a tough fighter."</p>

<p>Add to that the fact that seven of his 23 wins happened by technical knockout, and you‚Äôll understand what kind of a fighter Tybura is. Rather than going for a finish in the first round, he likes to bully his opponents for all 15 minutes.</p>
<p>He‚Äôs a grinder who lands a lot of strikes, with his average being 3.61 significant strikes per minute. Tybura also often tries to take the opponent down. He‚Äôs now always successful (his TD accuracy is 32%), but he does end up making 1.42 TDs per fight.</p>
<p>Blagoy Ivanov Doesn‚Äôt Get Grinded</p>
<p>Sure, all UFC fighters are tough as nails, but Ivanov is special. The Bulgarian fighter never stops fighting even when facing a much stronger rival. The former PFL and WSOF champion is great defensively, while also having decent stamina for a heavyweight. As a result, he‚Äôs incredibly hard to beat inside the distance.</p>
<p>The evidence of this is that even though he‚Äôs lost three fights since joining the UFC, he‚Äôs without a defeat inside the distance in this competition. Actually, Ivanov has only one loss before the final bell ‚Äì Alexander Volkov defeated him by submission at Bellator 120 in 2014.</p>
<p>Still not convinced that Ivanov is one of the toughest fighters in the world? If so, here‚Äôs one fun fact for you. Back in 2012, Ivanov was the victim of a knife attack, in which he suffered a lung puncture. Doctors spend six hours fighting for his life and he stayed in critical condition for about a month and a half. He barely survived the incident, but that didn‚Äôt make him give up on his MMA dream.</p>
<p>In 2013, he returned to the ring, winning by submission in his comeback fight. Then, he went on to win another eight fights in various promotions (while losing just one), which is what got him on the radar of UFC promoters.</p>
<p>Marcin Tybura vs Blagoy Ivanov Prediction</p>
<p>We don‚Äôt think either of these fighters has the ability to finish the other one. Instead, we think this fight will drag on until the final bell. Don‚Äôt get us wrong, we don‚Äôt think this is going to be a slug fest, but we also don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll witness a spectacular finish.</p>
<p>We‚Äôre almost 100% certain the fight winner will be decided by the judges, but who will they vote for? It can go either way, really, but if we had to pick one of them, we‚Äôd go with Ivanov. The main reason is that the Bulgarian fighter has fought some real A-list fighters over the last couple of years (Tai Tuivasa, Derrick Lewis, Augusto Sakai, etc.). He did well against them, so why wouldn‚Äôt he do the same against Tybura?</p>
<p>Pick: Blagoy Ivanov to win by decision</p>
