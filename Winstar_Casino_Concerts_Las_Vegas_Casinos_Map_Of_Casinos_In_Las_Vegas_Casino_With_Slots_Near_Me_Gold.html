Whoever wins will claim the first seed in the League of Legends Pro League. While both teams deserve to win, the oddsmakers seem to favor one side a little more than the other.</p>
<p>Edward Gaming is posted as the underdog at (+220) based on early predictive models by BetOnline while FunPlus Phoenix seems to be the favorite with the tremendous (-278). This begs the question of whether the betting agency is off with its prediction. If so, there is some great value riding on a simple match bet backing Edward Gaming.</p>

<p>FunPlus Phoenix Recovering from Difficult 2020</p>
<p>After FunPlus Phoenix won the World Championship in 2019, the team immediately hit a decline in their overall performance. Call it winner’s high if you will, but FPX struggled much in 2020 and they understandably missed the 2020 Worlds, only to return this year for a shot at making the first or second seed in the LPL, which should be enough to qualify them.</p>
<p>Not only that, but the team is running 13-3 which is an outstanding track record that justifies why oddsmakers have them at (-278) to win. FPX is on fire and compared to the previous season, the team is determined to win.</p>
<p>They have had a string of successes on their way to the top, defeating Team WE and LNG Esports, and finally facing off with Edward Gaming which will vie just as hard for a shot at ranking as the top seed in the league. EDG faced off with Phoenix in the 2019 World Champion and went on a Bo3 series against the team, losing to FunPlus.</p>
<p>What Are Edward Gaming Chances on Thursday?</p>
<p>In honest, Edward Gaming has had a good overall series. They defeated LNG twice in August and exchanged one victory and loss to Team Win. In terms of FunPlus Phoenix, Edward Gaming is still a little hesitant. The teams met on August 8 and FPX left the series with 2-1.</p>
<p>Edward Gaming has found Phoenix to be a hard opponent to crack but this doesn’t mean that you should dismiss them altogether just yet. If anything, Edward Gaming is bound to press Phoenix and for the series to go the full five rounds.</p>
<p>EDG should be able to bring at least two games home and Phoenix will have to make sure that they are not letting the third one slip away from them. We would also bet on the games going over 3.5+ (+165), as the finals are headed to the distance.</p>
