<p>Detroit's three casinos reported slight increase in revenue for January despite the sudden drop in revenue within their sports betting segment</p>
<p>The gambling regulator in the state, the Michigan Gaming Control Board (MGCB), announced that the three casinos in Detroit reported a total of $103.5 million in monthly aggregate revenue last month. This result, when compared to the $100.9 million reported for the corresponding period in 2022 marked a slight increase of less than 3%.</p>
<p>Further details released by the MGCB reveal that the revenue from table games and slots last month increased by 4.4% when compared to January 2022. However, a month-over-month comparison to December 2022 showed that table games and slots revenue in January dipped by 4.5%.</p>
<p>Sports Betting Revenue Plummets</p>
<p>A breakdown of the $103.5 million in revenue for January reveals that retail sports betting produced only $111,023, while table games and slots generated $103.4 million in revenue.</p>
<p>The Board revealed that qualified adjusted gross receipts (QAGR) for retail sports betting last month plummeted by 94.3% or $1.8 million below the January 2022 results. Moreover, a comparison to December 2022 also shows a decrease, with QAGR from retail sports betting reported by the three casinos down by $1.5 million or 93.2%.</p>
<p>The total sports betting handle in January was $15.3 million, while a breakdown of QAGR per property showed losses for two operators. Motor City Casino was the only casino that reported positive QAGR from sports betting last month, hitting $236,503. On the other hand, both Hollywood Casino at Greektown and MGM reported losses from this segment of $62,755 and $62,725 respectively.</p>
<p>Gaming Revenue Increases</p>
<p>Despite the dip in the sports betting segment, the three casinos in Detroit posted an increase in their January gaming revenue. Hollywood Casino posted an 11.9% increase in its gaming revenue to $22.9 million last month when compared to the same period in 2022. Additionally, MGM reported a 3.2% increase in gaming revenue to $50.2 million last month, while Motor City Casino observed a 1.3% increase in gaming revenue to $30.3 million when compared to January 2022.</p>
<p>Keeping in mind the gaming revenue results, the trio paid a total of $8.4 million in taxes to Michigan. This result was in line with the $8 million paid in taxes for the same period the prior year. Revenue market share data released by the MGCB revealed that MGM held 48% of the share in January, while Motor City and Hollywood Casino were responsible for 30% and 22% respectively.</p>
