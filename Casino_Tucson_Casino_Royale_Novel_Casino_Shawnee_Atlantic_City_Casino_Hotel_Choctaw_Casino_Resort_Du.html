<p>The long-anticipated global gambling and gaming event, ICE London is expected to return bigger than ever for its 2023 edition</p>
<p>The hosts of the event, Clarion Gaming, announced Tuesday that this year’s edition of ICE London 2023, is set to run between February 7 and February 9. Previously, in 2020, ICE London set a record for using a net space of 49,690 square meters. However, the latest edition of the industry expo expands further, taking additional space, and is expected to occupy 51,466 square meters of net space, a new record for the gathering.</p>
<p>Overall, the event will be held within 41 halls at ExCeL London, a famous international exhibition and convention center. On the other hand, iGB Affiliate London, a sister show, will occupy the remaining three halls at ExCeL London.</p>
<p>A Long-Anticipated Event for the Whole Gaming Industry</p>
<p>Stuart Hunter, Clarion Gaming’s managing director, said that ICE London 2022 was undoubtedly a success. Still, he pointed out that the return of a full-scale edition of the ICE will gather all major brands within the gambling sector. Hunter pointed out that it will be fantastic to see ExCeL flooded with gaming industry experts that deliver unique energy and creativity.</p>
<p>Whilst ICE London 2022 was a tremendous success the fact remains that nothing compares with the return of a full-scale edition of ICE featuring all of the major supplier brands to the land-based sector. Stuart Hunter, managing director at Clarion Gaming</p>
<p>What’s more, Hunter pointed out that iGB Affiliate London along with ICE London helps completely fill up ExCeL London’s exhibition center. “A full-size, dynamic ICE on its traditional dates is something that all sectors of the industry are looking forward to participating in,” he added.</p>
<p>According to Clarion Gaming’s managing director, ICE represents a unique opportunity for networking and is one of the most trusted and anticipated industry events. He added that after a 3-year wait for a full-scale event, the whole industry is focused on “World Gaming Week.” This is because ICE will hold a significant number of high-level meetings, as well as content masterclasses, conferences, and other networking events that bring unique opportunities for gaming industry stakeholders.</p>
