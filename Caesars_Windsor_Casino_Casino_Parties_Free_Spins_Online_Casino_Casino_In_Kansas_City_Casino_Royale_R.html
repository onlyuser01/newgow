    <h1>Caesars Windsor Casino Casino Parties Free Spins Online Casino Casino In Kansas City Casino Royale R</h1>

<p>Wazdan, one of the leading suppliers and providers of iGaming content globally, has expanded its reach in the Netherlands. This was made possible through a tie-up with Bingoal, a prominent local operator which will now benefit from a range of Wazdan’s acclaimed slot titles.</p>
<p>With more than 20 years of experience, running both land-based and iGaming projects, Bingoal makes for a very good partner for Wazdan which will seek to realize its ambitions of cementing its presence in the Dutch iGaming market. Bingoal Casino Product Manager Dany Salmon was pleased with the opportunity to see more innovative and high-quality casino games arrive on its platforms.</p>
<p>He hailed Wazdan as a supplier with a strong reputation and impeccable gaming content that comes with plenty of innovative features. "We look forward to seeing our players’ reactions," Salmon stated.</p>
<p>As a result, Bingoal has now started offering many popular titles by Wazdan, such as 9 Burning Dragons, 9 Burning Stars, 9 Coins 1000 Edition, 9 Lions, Black Horse Deluxe, and a number of other prominent options.</p>
<p>Wazdan already has another batch of six games planned out for the market as well, with the supplier leaning heavily on its top-performing titles and seeking to strike home with players on the local market. Bingoal is similarly pleased to see Wazdan release its titles and benefit from a number of proprietary features developed by the supplier.</p>
<p>Among those are Hold the Jackpot, Sticky to Infinity, Cash Infinity and Collect to Infinity, all of which are trademarked by Wazdan and introduce unique experiences to the gameplay. This is not Wazdan’s first Dutch market entry either, as the company already maintains a fleet of its games in the country through a similar partnership with Play North.</p>
<p>Commenting on the latest opportunity, Wazdan Chief Commercial Officer Andrzej Hyla welcomed Bingoal as the company’s latest Dutch partner. "The deal allows us to continue delivering our engagement-boosting games across regulated European markets and fulfil our commercial vision," Hyla stated.</p>
<p>Wazdan first entered the Dutch iGaming market in August 2022 with 777.nl. Since then, the company has signed a multi-brand partnership with Play North and has launched a number of the company’s casinos, including Kiirkasiino, Pikakasino, and Kansino.</p>
