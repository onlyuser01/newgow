<p>Unifor, the trade union representing casino workers at the two Great Canadian Gaming Corporation (GCGC) casinos in Ontario which went on strike announced the strike could soon be over.</p>
<p>Tentative Agreement Signed</p>
<p>Employees at Pickering Casino Resort and Casino Ajax who are members of Unifor Local 1090 went on strike on July 29 after the casino company failed to negotiate new wages with the trade union but the trade union announced Thursday that a tentative agreement with GCGC has been reached.</p>
<p>Lana Payne, National Secretary-Treasury at Unifor, congratulated all Unifor members who did not give up and “took on a powerful employer to fight for what was right.”</p>
<p>“Gaming sector workers deserve fairness during these uncertain economic times,” added Corey Dalton, president of Unifor Local 1090, explaining that the negotiations were tough and members’ stance for “better working conditions” was the main driver behind the tentative agreement.</p>
<p>Unifor said in the announcement that details of the tentative agreement reached with GCGC would be released after the ratification vote for members scheduled to take place today.</p>
<p>Seeking Better Wages, Benefits and Pensions</p>
<p>Looking for improvements to wages, benefits and pensions for its members working at GCGC casinos, Unifor held a coordinated bargaining table meeting in Toronto last month. As part of the negotiations, Unifor also sought to reduce the employer’s reliance on precarious part-time jobs.</p>
<p>Unifor negotiations bore fruit on July 23, when negotiators signed agreements with GCGC’s Great Blue Heron Casino, Casino Woodbine, Shorelines Casino Thousand Islands, Shorelines Casino Peterborough, Elements Casino Mohawk, and Elements Casino Brantford. At that time, an agreement with Unifor members at Pickering Casino Resort and Casino Ajax could not be reached.</p>
<p>Canada’s largest trade union in the private sector with 315,000 members, Unifor, represents approximately 1,500 people working at Great Blue Heron Casino, Casino Woodbine, Pickering Casino Resort, Casino Ajax, Shorelines Casino Thousand Islands, and Shorelines Casino Peterborough via its Unifor Local 1090 branch, advocating for their rights while fighting for equality and social justice and seeking to create progressive change for a better future.</p>
<p>The company operating the casinos, Great Canadian Gaming Corporation, announced today it has rebranded to Great Canadian Entertainment to better align with its long-term strategy and market position in the Canadian gaming market.</p>
