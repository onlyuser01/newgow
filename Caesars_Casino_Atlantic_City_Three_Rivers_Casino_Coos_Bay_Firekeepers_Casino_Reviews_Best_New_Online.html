    <h1>Caesars Casino Atlantic City Three Rivers Casino Coos Bay Firekeepers Casino Reviews Best New Online</h1>

<p>So finally I know that bluechip website is totally a scam. I created my account a few days ago and made it verified with my documents. I never created any 2nd account with the same email/number/identity. Yesterday I deposited 300 INR just to check if their deposit really works, I deposited the amount which wasn't appearing later in my balance over there. So I talked to chat support and they told me to verify the payment with the same method again (by filling the same amount and transaction ID) again... So I did the same and they said that there's some technical issue so that they're forwarding my issue to appropriate department and it will be resolved soon. I waited for almost 6 hours, still balance is zero, no deposit appeared so I logged out my account and went to sleep. Today morning I woke up with a hope that my account is deposited with the amount now so I tried to log into my account but it was showing an error that please check your password or email, I tried thrice then changed my password by clicking 'forget password' again tried to login with new password and got same error 'no login'. I created an 2nd account with my father's mobile and email and asked the issue to chat support about my account, I was surprising when they said that you might had pasted your transaction ID again (I didn't paste but typed because it was in screenshots so I saw and typed each and every character properly), okay then they said that you might have 2nd account with same details, address, IP login. I said no that was my only verified account with my details. Later that that didn't give me a proper reason so I asked to refund my money, they said please ask your payment provider, I mean what the hell... My payment got deducted from my bank so how could my bank pay it to me now. Then they denied returning my payment and told me big lessons on terms and conditions that I might have didn't read the T&amp;Cs and now they can't return my money which wasn't even deposited into my account and got blocked. Great... I'm requesting you everyone and casino guru to make this casino blacklisted ASAP as I've all the proofs of payment I sent to them and didn't get return even my payment was zero and still zero after deducted from my bank. Don't ever try to olay on this casino, don't ever make any account there. They're pure scammers and don't ever leave a single chance to rip your money.</p>
