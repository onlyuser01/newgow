<p>English Premier League team shirt sponsorship has rocketed to all-time high. The league’s 20 teams will earn a combined £281.8 million ($368 million) from the brands that will adorn chests during the forthcoming 2017-18 season.</p>
<p>That’s up £55 million ($72 million) on last year.</p>

<p>In fact, revenues from shirt sponsorship have almost tripled over the past seven years, according to figures published this week by SportingIntelligence.com.</p>
<p>Gambling brands have contributed handsomely to the cash pile with an extraordinary nine clubs of 20 bearing the logos of betting companies, who have paid a combined £47.3 million ($62 million) for the privilege.</p>
<p>The biggest spender from the gambling sector is Betway, whose sponsorship of West Ham is worth some £10 million ($13 million) a year to the East London club.</p>
<p>Close behind, at $9.6 million (12.5 million), is Kenya’s SportsPesa, the proud new shirt sponsor of Everton and the first African company to invest in the EPL.</p>
<p>Man Utd Tops List</p>
<p>Those deals pale in comparison with the “top six” clubs, whose status and worldwide following commands the real top dollar. Chevrolet’s sponsorship of Manchester United is worth $47 million ($62 million) alone.</p>
<p>That was the biggest deal of its kind in the world when it was signed in 2014, before was eclipsed the following year by Real Madrid’s deal with Adidas, at £59 million ($77 million) a year.</p>
<p>Chelsea’s deal with Japanese tire giant Yokohama Rubber Company, meanwhile, is next on the EPL list, worth £40 million ($59 million) a year.</p>
<p>The global reach of the EPL is reflected in the international diversity of its sponsors. This season, only three clubs will be sponsored by British companies.</p>
<p>Along with the aforementioned US and Kenyan firms, there are two airlines based in the United Arab Emirates; two Hong Kong-based gambling companies, as well as one from the Philippines; a Chinese insurance company, and, oddly enough, a Chinese company that plans and builds eco towns.</p>
<p>Betting Controversies</p>
<p>But gambling brands will be the most ubiquitously splashed across the Premier League’s highly paid walking bill boards come kick off on 12 August.</p>
<p>That’s likely to be a point of contention again this year, following the recent decision of English soccer’s governing body, the FA, to pull out of a four-year sponsorship deal with Ladbrokes after only a year.</p>
<p>The FA forbids soccer players from betting on the sport, but a recent series of high-profile player betting scandals left the organization open to accusations of hypocrisy for lining its pockets with the proceeds of gambling, while penalizing its players for gambling on soccer games.</p>
