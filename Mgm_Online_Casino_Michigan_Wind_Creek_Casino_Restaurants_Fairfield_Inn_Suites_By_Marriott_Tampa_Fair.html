<p>Despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, casinos in Detroit, Michigan managed to surpass $100 million in monthly aggregate revenue last month, according to recent results.</p>
<p>MGM, Greektown Revenue Grows in January</p>
<p>The Michigan Gaming Control Board unveiled figures on Tuesday regarding the revenue which casinos in Detroit raised in January. According to the recent report, the three casinos in Detroit reported $100.9 million in aggregate revenue last month.</p>
<p>Breakdown of the revenue shows that MGM earned the highest market share, contributing 49% of the monthly revenue. On the other hand, MotorCity’s market share in January was 30%, while Greektown was responsible for the remaining 21%.</p>
<p>In other words, MGM’s revenue last month hit $48.7 million, marking an increase of 43% when compared to January 2021. Greektown’s revenue in January 2022 hit $20.5 million, marking a 4.1% increase when compared to the same period a year ago.</p>
<p>In contrast, MotorCity’s revenue hit $29.9 million, marking a 9.9% decrease when compared to January 2021. According to the MGCB, one of the reasons why gaming revenues plummeted last year was the pandemic-related capacity limits.</p>
<p>Taxes Last Month Increased to $8 Million</p>
<p>The regulator revealed that the bigger part of the gaming revenue from Detroit’s three casinos last month was generated by table games and slots. Those games were responsible for nearly $99 million, while retail sports betting generated some $1.93 million.</p>
<p>Overall, the tax proceeds from the three casinos in Detroit in January hit $8 million. This marks an increase when compared to January 2021, when taxes halted at $7 million.</p>
<p>According to the MGCB, retail sports betting’s total gross receipts in January were $1.97 million. On the other hand, qualified adjusted gross receipts (QAGR) for sports betting last month dropped to $1.93 million, marking a 52.4% decrease when compared to the same period in 2021. Michigan received some $73,070 in taxes from the three casinos’ retail sports betting operations last month. Additionally, the venues submitted $89,308 in retail sports betting taxes to Detroit.</p>
<p>Last but not least, MGCB’s latest report outlined that fantasy contest operators reported $772,465 in total adjusted revenues in December. This represents taxes of $64,887. The aggregate fantasy contest adjusted revenues from fantasy contest operators for the full year 2021 hit $16.2, representing $1.4 million in taxes.</p>
