<p>Maryland Powerball Ticket Wins $731M Jackpot, Winner Might Never Be Known</p>

<p>A lucky Powerball player in Maryland is $731.1 million richer after winning last night’s draw. But thanks to Maryland law, the winner can choose to stay anonymous.</p>

<p>The winning numbers were 40-53-60-68-69, and the Powerball 22. Only one ticket matched all six numbers.</p>
<p>The Multi-State Lottery Association, which operates Powerball, advertised an estimated jackpot of $730 million for the January 20 draw. But higher than expected ticket sales pushed the jackpot another $1.1 million higher.</p>
<p>The lump-sum cash option — typically what jackpot winners opt for — is approximately $546.8 million. It’s the second-largest cash value for a single winning ticket in US history.</p>
<p>Along with running the Maryland Lottery, Medenica is the director of the Mega Millions Consortium.</p>
<p>For those who didn’t win Wednesday, Friday’s Mega Millions jackpot is an estimated $970 million.</p>
<p>Maryland Anonymity</p>
<p>Wednesday’s winning Powerball ticket was sold at the Coney Market convenience store in Lonaconing, a small, remote town in Allegany County in the Georges Creek Valley.</p>
<p>“We’re really happy for somebody,” Coney Market owner Richard Ravenscroft told the Associated Press. “We don’t know who it is yet.”</p>
<p>We might not ever know. Maryland provides lottery winners with the legal right to remain anonymous.</p>
<p>There are many reasons why you may want to remain anonymous,” says Robert Pagliarini, president of Pacifica Wealth Advisors. Pagliarini advises clients on sudden wealth planning.</p>
<p>“When you have lots of assets, you can become a target for lawsuits, harassment, and requests for money — from family, friends, and often complete strangers.”</p>
<p>Forty-four states have a lottery, but only 11 allow anonymity. One being Maryland.</p>
<p>Powerball Jackpot Breakdown</p>
<p>USA Mega is an online site dedicated to all things lottery, including the financial breakdown of potential jackpot wins.</p>
<p>The person who won Wednesday night won’t actually receive the full $731.1 million annuity or $546.8 million cash payment — not even close.</p>
<p>If the individual takes the $546.8 million lump sum, it will be subjected to a 37 percent federal income tax, which cuts more than $202.2 million from the win. That leaves the winner with $344.5 million. But, of course, the state of Maryland wants its share, too.</p>
<p>Assuming the ticket was sold to a Maryland resident, he or she will need to pay an 8.95 percent state tax on the income, or around $48.9 million. That brings the net one-time lump sum to roughly $295.5 million.</p>
<p>The best tax scenario in the United States for a massive lottery jackpot win would come by way of either California, Florida, New Hampshire, Puerto Rico, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, or Wyoming. None of those jurisdictions impose a state tax on lottery prizes, meaning the net prize from last night’s win would be $344.5 million.</p>
<p>The worst state to win a major lottery jackpot — if there is such a thing — is New Jersey. The Garden State levies an effective tax of 10.75 percent on lottery prizes. That would have brought Wednesday’s jackpot win down to $285.7 million.</p>
