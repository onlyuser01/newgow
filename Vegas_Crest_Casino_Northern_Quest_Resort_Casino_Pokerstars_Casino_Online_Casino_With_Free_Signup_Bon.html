<p>Gambling and betting giant bet365 has penned a partnership extension with Rightlander, a leading provider of innovative affiliate compliance solutions. The deal highlights the operator’s desire to promote safer gambling, as well as its commitment to high compliance standards.</p>
<p>Rightlander and be365 have worked together for some time with the former company providing its comprehensive cutting-edge compliance tools to the operator. The partnership has since become an important part of bet365’s affiliate program.</p>
<p>As agreed, Rightlander will continue to leverage its solutions to help bet365 maintain ethical advertising standards and navigate the complex regulatory landscape. Rightlander offers many advanced features and tech solutions that are designed to help bet365 and other partners remain compliant and stay in touch with regulatory changes.</p>
<p>In addition, the extended contract is expected to provide a boost to bet365’s compliance infrastructure while driving innovation in affiliate compliance within the iGaming sector. According to the official announcement, the partnership between the two parties will continue to be exemplary for industry standards of affiliate compliance.</p>
<p>The extended agreement highlights the two companies’ desire to promote safer gambling.</p>
<p>Last year, Rightlander announced a new partnership with the international affiliate marketing network Tradedoubler, expanding its global reach. In October 2022, the company updated its library of solutions with a new marketing compliance tool.</p>
<p>The Companies Are Happy to Deepen Their Ties</p>
<p>Nicole Mitton, Rightlander’s head of customer success, commented on the partnership extension. She said that she is thrilled by the opportunity to continue working with the operator and deepen its relationship with her company.</p>
<p>According to Mitton, the new agreement underscores the effectiveness of Rightlander’s tools.</p>
<p>This renewed agreement is a testament to the effectiveness of our compliance solutions, and we look forward to continuing to help bet365 promote responsible gambling and adhere to regulatory requirements. Nicole Mitton, head of customer success, Rightlander</p>
<p>A spokesperson from bet365 also commented on the matter, saying that they are very excited to renew the operator’s contract with Rightlander. The representative applauded the solutions provider’s comprehensive compliance solution, which has become “an integral part” of bet365’s affiliate program.</p>
<p>The extended partnership reinforces our commitment to responsible gambling and our dedication to providing a secure and fair environment for all our customers. Bet365 spokesperson</p>
