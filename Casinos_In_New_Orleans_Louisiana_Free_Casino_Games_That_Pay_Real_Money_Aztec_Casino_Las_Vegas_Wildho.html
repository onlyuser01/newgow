<p>The Colorado Lottery has said that it will improve its Scratch game product and business by securing a new partnership with Scientific Games, a global leader in the delivery of lottery games, content, and products. Thanks to the Scientific Games Enhanced Partnership program, the Colorado Lottery will be able to significantly extend the scope of its offer and plan responsible growth across the state.</p>
<p>Scientific Games Enhanced Partnership Arrives to Colorado</p>
<p>The resulting revenue will be forwarded as contributions to the state’s park, trails, open spaces, schools and more. Colorado will draw from Scientific Games’ experience which involves close to 40 years in running lottery games in all their permutations. Presently, the Scientific Games Enhanced Partnership program is available to seven out of the ten top-performing global lottery operations. Scientific Games president of Americas and global instant products, John Schulz, said:</p>
<p>This is an exciting opportunity for the Colorado Lottery and Scientific Games teams to expand our work together to entertain players and benefit environmental and education programs in the state. We look forward to taking our collaborative efforts to the next level through an SGEP partnership that includes our SCiQ technology. Scientific Games president of Americas and global instant products, John Schulz</p>
<p>According to the company, it generates 40% improvement in performance across the board for partner operators.</p>
<p>Thanks to the renewed collaboration between both entities, Scientific Games will be able to provide the Colorado Lottery with its world-leading instant game design, portfolio management services, and analytics-driven solutions that will lead to improved financial performance and elicit stronger engagement from consumers by servicing them with the specific products they prefer.</p>
<p>Boosting Results, Monitoring, and Inventory Management</p>
<p>Scientific Games will deploy the Scitrak and Ordercast systems which will facilitate inventory management for the Colorado Lottery and its 3,000 retailers across the state. Scientific Games will further seek to boost the job market by providing in-state employment opportunities at its new office near Lakewood, Colorado.</p>
<p>Scientific Games is also deploying 500 units of SCiQ to hand-picked Colorado Lottery retailers which will enable real-time visibility and control of instant game inventory. The units will also help with accounting and operational procedures.</p>
<p>Colorado Lottery director Tom Seaver welcomed this opportunity and said that the lottery was committed to growing its product offering responsibly. The idea is to maximize the returns to good programs in the Centennial State, Seaver explained.</p>
<p>“This contract extension with Scientific Games will bring operational efficiencies to the Lottery and our retailers,” the executive concluded. Presently, Scientific Games is manufacturing and selling an estimated 70% of all global instant game retail sales. The company is working with 130 lotteries across 50 countries and is a preferred go-to partner for lotteries in North America.</p>
