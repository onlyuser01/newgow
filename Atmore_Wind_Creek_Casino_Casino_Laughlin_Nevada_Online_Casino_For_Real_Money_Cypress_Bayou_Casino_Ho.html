    <h1>Atmore Wind Creek Casino Casino Laughlin Nevada Online Casino For Real Money Cypress Bayou Casino Ho</h1>

<p>Rivers Casino Pittsburgh, one of Pennsylvania’s most influential properties, has turned another person’s life around as it paid out another huge gaming table jackpot to a lucky customer. This was also the highest table game jackpot the casino has ever paid out, surpassing even the $1.2 million bad-beat jackpot recorded in August 2022.</p>
<p>The latest Rivers Casino Pittsburgh jackpot winner was playing Fortune Pai Gow Poker. The game uses a standard playing cards deck but also includes a single joker that can be used as a wild card, substituting for an ace or another card in a straight or flush.</p>
<p>The game sees the dealer deal seven cards to the player and to himself, after which each of them compiles a five-card high hand and a two-card low hand. Under the rules of the game, the high hand must exceed the low hand.</p>
<p>The Player Was Dealt a Seven-Card Straight Flush</p>
<p>The lucky jackpot winner was dealt a seven-card straight flush, containing 4 through 10 of clubs. This exceptional luck landed them a $1.39 million jackpot, which is by far the biggest jackpot Rivers Casino Pittsburgh has ever handed out.</p>
<p>The jackpot was further boosted by the two optional $5 side bets the player had placed. For reference, the two side bets contributed $25,000 and $3,000 to the final payout.</p>
<p>This is notably the first time the full Fortune Pai Gow Poker progressive jackpot has been scored at the casino ever since the vertical was added in April 2017. Prior to the current win, the biggest payout had stood at only $92,186 and was hit in August 2020.</p>
<p>Andre Barnabei, assistant general manager at Rivers Casino Pittsburgh, commented on the matter, describing the property as “the place to win.” Barnabei added that the jackpot has now been reset to $538,791 but noted that this is still a life-changing sum.</p>
<p>In the meantime, lucky Las Vegas visitors recently collected several jackpots. Harry Reid International Airport in Las Vegas once again paid out a huge jackpot, making another customer a millionaire. In addition, a Durango Casino and Resort visitor turned a $0.80 bet into a $10,000 payday. Similarly, an Aliante Casino Hotel Spa visitor was able to win $10,000 after placing a modest $1.80 wager.</p>
<p>Betway, on the other hand, recently gave one player extra reasons to celebrate as they hit a staggering $14.7 million jackpot on Christmas Day.</p>
