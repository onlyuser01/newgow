    <h1>Silver Dollar Casino Seatac Hard Rock Casinos In Florida 4 Queens Hotel And Casino Marriott Resort A</h1>

<p>Hello. I have registered in betspalace casino a month ago. Played a few days. Had couple 100 Eu deposits lost them. Then the last deposit was 25 Eu with bonus. I have reached 400+ Eu when my balance was corrected to 250 Eu, as the maximum winnings can be no more than 10x deposit amount when you use bonus. Then I continue playing some games and my balance amount was lowered to 237 Eu. I ordered a withdrawal. But I was wondering when I received an email from casino that I have bonus violation my winnings were confiscated and my balance returned to 25. The strange was that they was about using bonus for PURELY progress the games and then return and play with REAL money to continue them. I answered to their email that I didn't play with real money but bonus money instead and I met wager requirements. Their answer was that I have violation AFTER I met wager requirements and my balance corrected to 250. So the strange is that they confirmed that winning of 250 Eu was LEGAL but losing of 13 Eu was illegal)). So they stated that my incoming balance of real money is 250, as my bonus wagering was legal but they write that illegal was my gameplay AFTER that. If they are right, why they didn't return it to incoming balance that should be 250, but not 25..?) Shouldn't I continue playing some games? How could this be a violation if my balance was lowered - just continue games that have progress features. If I stopped at 250 they should have nothing to say. This is unfair and very funny at the same time. But they have to return my money.</p>
