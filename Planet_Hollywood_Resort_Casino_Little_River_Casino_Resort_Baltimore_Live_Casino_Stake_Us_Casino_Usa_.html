    <h1>Planet Hollywood Resort Casino Little River Casino Resort Baltimore Live Casino Stake Us Casino Usa</h1>

<p>Dear,</p>
<p>I would like to mention that in "Casino Napoli" there is the following interesting procedure regarding bonuses.</p>
<p>I deposit 155 euros, I receive 155 euros, I manage to break the barrier of 15,000 euros and as soon as I go to make a withdrawal, an unpleasant surprise awaits me</p>
<p>"You can withdraw up to 350 *** EUR from your balance.</p>
<p>Please be aware that 155 *** EUR that were given to you as a bonus,</p>
<p>will be removed from your balance upon the withdrawal transaction. Do you wish to continue? "</p>
<p>That is, they give you a bonus, you cross the limit, you go to withdraw and they tell you that you can not withdraw the bonus amount!</p>
<p>-The trap:</p>
<p>as soon as you log in to the page, a "pop up window" is activated and tells you to send CASH via chat to receive a Bonus. By sending the specific word they give you a bonus but they never inform you about where you will find the T&amp;C or they give you the link so that you can read and then accept.</p>
<p>When I contacted them via chat, the answer I received was that all players are required to read T&amp;C.</p>
<p>-Also, they claim that there is no file with the history from the conversations (chat).</p>
<p>To my question about whether they can prove to me that they have the necessary licenses, the answer was to look at the bottom of the page.</p>
<p>-As for my question about who is the legal representative of Casino, they answered that I should send an email.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely</p>
