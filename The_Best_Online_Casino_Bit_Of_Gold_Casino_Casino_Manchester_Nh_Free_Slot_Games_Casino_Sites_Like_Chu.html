    <h1>The Best Online Casino Bit Of Gold Casino Casino Manchester Nh Free Slot Games Casino Sites Like Chu</h1>

<p>Sports betting in the United States is certainly not what it used to be in the past. A lot of huge developments have occurred since the country’s Supreme Court lifted the federal ban on sports betting. With more and more states warming up to the idea of legalized and regulated sports betting industries, it is quite easy to see the direction that the sector is going to take going forward. As expected, several big brands are looking to capitalize on the rapidly growing market which makes a whole lot of sense especially considering how lucrative it is.</p>
<p>Rivers Casino Launches Permanent Sportsbook in Pittsburgh</p>
<p>On Monday, Rivers Casino Pittsburgh officially debuted its $5 million sportsbook. Thanks to its state-of-the-art interior as well as amazing offerings, the sports betting facility is on track to be even more popular than its temporary predecessor.</p>
<p>This sportsbook is located at the center of Rivers Casino’s gaming floor, the space that was previously occupied by the Levels Lounge. It is a massive 5,500-square-foot gaming space with a massive LED monitors as well as 24 flat-screen 86-inch monitors. The lounge includes club chairs and table seating for nearly 200 guests who will be able to place their bets via the six betting windows or the 33 self-service betting kiosks.</p>
<p>Just like its temporary predecessor, Rivers Casino Pittsburgh’s BetRivers Sportsbook is now offering betting on a number of popular sporting events. These include basketball, football, soccer, hockey, baseball, and even college sports. Both the casino’s retail and online sports betting operations are run bu Rush Street interactive while its technology is provided by the Kambi Group.</p>
<p>The new BetRivers Sportsbook will now be operating daily with varying opening times for different days of the week. Even so, it will be complemented by the operator’s online betting option.</p>
<p>Saracen Casino Resort Launches Sports Betting Operation</p>
<p>On Monday, the Arkansas Racing Commission also gave the state’s Saracen Casino Resort in Pine Bluff the go-ahead to begin offering sports betting services. This comes after the gaming operator soft-launched its sportsbook and was cleared after having met all of the gaming commission’s requirements.</p>
<p>The new betting facility will have betting kiosks where patrons will be able to place smaller bets of up to $500. Initially, these bets will be available for basketball, football, baseball, soccer, ice hockey, tennis, golf, auto racing and boxing with more set to be added in the near future. Renowned technology provider IGT will be powering the Saracen Casino Resort sportsbook through its Play Shot platform.</p>
<p>All these developments were made possible by Amendment 100 which was approved by Arkansas voters last November. It allows the state’s casinos to offer sports betting services and already two casinos have been authorized to do so.</p>
