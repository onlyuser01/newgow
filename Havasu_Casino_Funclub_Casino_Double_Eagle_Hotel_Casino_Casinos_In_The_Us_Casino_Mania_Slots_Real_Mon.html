<p>EveryMatrix has upgraded its successful relationship with Thailand-based developer of web solutions TOTOIT by acquiring the company and making it a permanent part of its portfolio.</p>
<p>TOTOIT Joins EveryMatrix’s Development Family</p>
<p>Established iGaming supplier and whitelabel solutions vendor EveryMatrix has added a powerful ally in the face of Thai development firm TOTOIT. The Thailand-based IT company specializes in a vast array of services, including front-end, intranet and extranet design as well as customizable programming solutions to meet specific customer needs.</p>
<p>This partnership is a direct continuation of previous collaborations that resulted in success between the two companies. Operating out of Chang Mai, TOTOIT will come to the help of EveryMatrix’s clients and empower the development of new brand offerings for them.</p>
<p>Commenting on these developments, EveryMatrix Group CEO Ebbe Groes said that TOTOIT’s proven track record of success has been essential in motivating the company to take the relationship to the next level.</p>
<p>“Their team already has a deep understanding of our APIs and processes,” he continued. “I have nothing but praise for this team, as I come to know them as efficient, reliable, and service-minded. In addition, they have the great business knowledge and will add new dimensions for gamification innovation.”</p>
<p>He commended TOTOIT’s team expertise and grasp of APIs and processes. TOTOIT stands out by virtue of the company’s reliability, efficiency and service-mindedness, Groes added.</p>
<p>Bringing an A-Grade Product to Tier 1 Clients</p>
<p>The acquisition of the brand would allow EveryMatrix to focus on a better quality service to Tier 1 customers and deliver bespoke solutions. TOTOIT has a team of 20 well-seasoned developers familiar with the needs and expectations of iGaming brands.</p>
<p>Twenty is a meaningful number for the brand which was founded in 2000, extending services to European and Southeast Asian clients. Bringing its expertise to EveryMatrix’s network would allow both companies to benefit and scale their offer and achieve meaningful and sustainable synergies.</p>
<p>EveryMatrix is caught in an interesting period of growth. In September, the company reinstated its BonusEngine tool as a standalone solution. As the company puts it, it’s intended to help take “bonusing onto the next level.”</p>
<p>The tool allows better gamification and access to a variety of contests, tournaments, achievements, and challenges. All of these solutions are becoming a more sustainable part of the bonus ecosystem and effectively replacing more linear solutions.</p>
<p>CasinoEngine CEO Stian Enger Pettersen commented that the company would be able to drive better bonus strategies for EveryMatrix’s client. By focusing the bonus management experience into a single tool, Pettersen believes that brands would be able to cut the time they spent on repetitive tasks and have more time to think strategically.</p>
