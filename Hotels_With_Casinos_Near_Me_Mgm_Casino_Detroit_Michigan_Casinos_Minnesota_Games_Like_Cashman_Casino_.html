<p>A total of 55 parishes in Louisiana support sports wagering. While FanDuel is currently collaborating with the local authorities about the launch of its product, it is up to the lawmakers to give the green light. If Louisiana’s legislature approves the activity, it may be launched just in time for the start of the football season.</p>
<p>Will Louisiana Launch Daily Fantasy Games Soon?</p>
<p>The beginning of this year’s football season may prove to be extra exciting for sports fans in Louisiana. Although the state did not allow fantasy sports betting last year, the activity may be launched just in time for the start of the football season. Three years ago, 47 parishes in Louisiana approved daily fantasy games. On the other hand, residents from 17 parishes voted against the activity.</p>
<p>Now, according to FanDuel’s governmental affairs director, Stacie Stern, who recently spoke to KLFY, the company is in talks with the state to launch its product. Stern deemed the launch of fantasy sports betting as a “big step”. Furthermore, she acknowledged that Louisiana is a state with a significant base of sports fans, which makes the launch of FanDuel’s product even more exciting. With that in mind, before launching fantasy sports wagering in Louisiana, the local authorities must set the geofencing around the 17 parishes that voted against the activity.</p>
<p>Last year, more parishes supported sports wagering in the state, reaching a total of 55 parishes in favor of the activity. By now, 9 bills are being reviewed by the lawmakers before the activity can be launched. The activity is expected to be taxed at 8%, and predictions estimate Louisiana to receive between $10 and $20 million annually.</p>
<p>According to Stern, having legal and regulated sports betting in Louisiana is undoubtedly important for its residents. Furthermore, she acknowledged that taxes will also bring the state a “little bit of revenue“. The next move is now in the hands of the state’s legislature to vote on the proposals. A final decision on the topic is expected to be reached next month.</p>
