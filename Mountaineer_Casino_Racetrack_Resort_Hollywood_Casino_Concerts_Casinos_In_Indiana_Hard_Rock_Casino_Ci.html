<p>OGA Dota Pit Minor Launches Today, April 22</p>
<p>8 teams will vie for the last spot in the MDL Disneyland Paris Major</p>
<p>Ninjas in Pyjamas and Gambit Esports primed as favorites</p>
<p>Dota PIT Minor: Event Overview</p>
<p>The fourth Minor part of the Dota 2 Pro Circuit (DPC) is about to kick off. The OGA Dota PIT Minor 2019 is launching today, April 22, and it will run through April 28, pitting 8 teams against each other for a share of the $300,000 prize pool and 500 DPC. Even more importantly, the event will grant successful teams an entry into the Mars Mediaâ€™s MDL Disneyland Paris Major.</p>
<p>WATCH LIVE NOW</p>
<p>Held at the Spaladium Arena in Split, Croatia, the Dota PIT Minor is the first such event to be held un front of a live crowd whereas all other Minors so far have bene held privately and broadcast via streams.</p>
<p>There will be quite a bit of Dota 2 to enjoy with the 8 participating teams all being part of the gameâ€™s global elite and therefore making for a spectacular show.</p>
<p>Format &amp; Schedule</p>
<p>The PIT Minor will kick off with a group stage held from April 22 â€“ April 24. There will be two groups with four teams in each. Each game will be played in the Best of 3 (BO3) and it will lead to the next stage, which will feature double-elimination bracket.</p>
<p>Once the teams hit the playoffs, they will be split into two brackets â€“ an upper bracket where BO3 games will be held and a lower bracket where teams will play in BO1 matches to move forward. This is a refresh from the traditional GSL way of running groups so far.</p>
<p>One minor issue that we might have is with the lower bracket BO1 in the playoffs when the stakes are significantly higher and therefore the games far more entertaining to watch. Come April 27, only 5 teams will be standing and they will start battling it out in another BO1 series.</p>

<p>Teams</p>
<p>Looking at the participating teams, we can definitely expect to see some high-profile Data. Of course, itâ€™s true that the majority of these teams have known their lows, but their names still inspire admiration. Nearly, all teams on the rosters have shown us some exceptional plays.</p>
<p>Forward Gaming are probably not going to still the thunder in this competition, but there are many, such as Ninjas in Pyjamas, Alliance, EHOME and even Royal Never Give Up that might do.</p>
<p>If we had to choose sides, we would definitely have to narrow down the choice of winners of this Minor to four teams:</p>
<p>Ninjas in Pyjamas</p>
<p>Gambit Esports</p>
<p>Alliance</p>
<p>EHOME</p>
<p>Gambit Esports might just have a smaller edge over Ninjas in Pyjamas which have been experiencing some trouble this season, although keeping themselves abreast with all the rest of the competitors.</p>
<p>Where to Watch the Game?</p>
<p>Apparently, there will be quite a few opportunities to watch the event, but the real action will be broadcast directly at the OGA Dota PIT Twitch Channel. Tune in to watch the 7-day Dota 2 action in the company of broadcasters and your fellow fans.</p>
