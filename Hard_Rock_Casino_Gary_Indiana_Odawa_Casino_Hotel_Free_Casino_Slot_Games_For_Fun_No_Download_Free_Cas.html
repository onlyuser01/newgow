    <h1>Hard Rock Casino Gary Indiana Odawa Casino Hotel Free Casino Slot Games For Fun No Download Free Cas</h1>

<p>Dear Casino.guru. Please also pay attention to this complaint which was submitted by the player from Estonia about winnings also confiscated from him by Wild.io about the same time they confiscated my money. Estonia is also on the prohibited list which the casino provided to this thread today but somehow the player, who exactly like me used the Welcome Bonus, was eventually paid. And this shows that Estonia too, was added to this list most recently (as well as Russia, Azerbaijan , Ireland and, probably, some other countries). The list, obviously, was actively edited just recently.</p>
<p>https://casino.guru/wild-io-casino-player-s-winnings-were-confiscated</p>
<p>Moreover, please, check this thread. The player from Russia, who also was a victim of the Wild.io casino - who also opened his/her complaint about the same time I did - was eventually not paid by the casino. But the casino NEVER quoted the reason for the non-payment as Russia being on the prohibited countries list and instead, as in my case, used the vague bonus abuse explanations. Why? Because Russia too was NOT on that list at the time of the complaint. It is on that list now.</p>
<p>https://casino.guru/wild-io-casino-player-s-winnings-were-confiscated-1</p>
<p>Later this Russian player left this comment in the discussion section of Wild.io casino (on this website):</p>
<p>Hello all. My complaint was closed as unresolved. But now i want to add new details. Please look at all wild.io complaint. They are all almost the same. First they took your money, then they come up with idea of abuse without any proofs. Now they have added Russia to blacklisted country list. However when i won Russia was not blacklisted ( i have screenshot). And now they say that i played from restricted country. Please do something</p>
<p>https://casino.guru/wild-io-casino-review#tab=js-tab-discussion</p>
<p>By the way, I also have a screenshot that Russia was not in the prohibited list 2 months ago (I refer to the screenshot of the General terms. Unfortunately, I don't have a screenshot of the Welcome bonus page).</p>
<p>And one more: another complaint, this time by the player from Ireland. Again , this complaint , exactly as mine, was submitted in November last year. This is the player's (dsp99RF) quote from that complaint :</p>
<p>"I have sent proof of Irish residence to the casino and I can see no mention of Ireland being a restricted country".</p>
<p>The casino never in that thread informed the player that his country (Ireland) was ineligible for the bonus he has received throughout the whole thread. And voila (!!!) , look above at the list provided by the casino representative today and you can see that IRELAND is also on the list of the prohibited countries ALREADY.</p>
<p>(Take a deeper look at this complaint and find the last post by the casino representative (one week ago) where he provides the list of the Restricted countries from the General Terms and Conditions (not a Welcome bonus page quoted above in this thread). Probably, the player from Ireland has a passport of a different country (which is prohibited in that General Terms list) but also have an Irish residence. The question is why to provide this list when you have another list where it is clearly stated that the players from Ireland are not eligible for the bonus which this player used? May be because just one week ago Ireland was NOT on that list yet?).</p>

<p>THIS IS SUCH A CLEAR CUT CASE OF FORGERY! Not only the Wild.io casino for 2 months "somehow" missed the fact that my country Azerbaijan is in the welcome bonus excluded list - it also missed that at least three other people's countries, whose money they confiscated, are on that list too! To all four of us and to the Casino.guru, from day one, the casino kept explaining that we abused their bonus by playing it in a "wrong way". When this did not help and Casino.guru supported the players against the rogue behavior of the casino and when the Skype calls the casino made to the players proved that those are the genuine players - then the Wild.io representatives changed the tactics and decided to edit their Terms and Conditions retroactively by adding our countries to the prohibited list on their website. Problem solved! (or was it?)</p>
<p>Does the casino involved in the falsification of proof deserve 5.9 points at Casino Guru?</p>
