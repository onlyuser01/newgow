<p>Read this Grant Park 220 preview for NASCAR odds information, drivers stats and news, as well as some free betting picks.</p>
<p>Sunday’s Grant Park 220 race is special for several reasons. Not only is this the inaugural edition of the Grant Park 220, but it’s also the first street race in the NASCAR Cup Series history. That said, it’s not easy to predict what’s going to happen in Chicago this weekend, but we’ll give our best in this Grant Park 220 preview.</p>

<p>Tyler Reddick’s Road Racing Experience Makes Him the No. 1 Grant Park 220 Favorite</p>
<p>Tyler Reddick is the main favorite, the probable reason being that he’s got experience with racing over a street course. Plus, he’s got a fantastic record on road courses, with wins in Indianapolis and at Road America.</p>
<p>The trouble is that the 27-year-old hasn’t won a race since March 26, when he triumphed at the 2023 EchoPark Automotive Grand Prix. The race uses a similar course as the Grant Park 220, suggesting that he likes these sorts of races. However, his recent form isn’t great. In the last three races, his best finish was the No. 30 position.</p>
<p>Other Drivers Worth Checking Out</p>
<p>Last weekend, we predicted Martin Truex Jr. was going to finish in the top 3. And he did! It was his fifth finish on the podium this season, meaning that in almost 30% of all races, he finished in one of the top three spots.</p>
<p>We’re almost certain he’s going to do the same this coming Sunday, but can he win the Grant Park 220? Perhaps, but anything can happen in this event. We think his chance is pretty much the same as the chance of Kyle Larson, Chase Elliott, and others.</p>
<p>When it comes to longshots, we think you should pay special attention to Chris Buescher. The 30-year-old loves road races, but more importantly, he’s very determined to improve his form as he’s currently sitting in the No. 12 place in the 2023 NASCAR Drivers’ Championship.</p>
<p>Grant Park 220 Prediction</p>
<p>The inaugural Grant Park 220 race looks like an ideal opportunity for a major underdog to upset the odds. Assuming that he actually takes part in Sunday’s race, Chris Buescher is the right guy for the job. He’s great in these sorts of races, with plenty of motivation to win his first race of the 2023 season.</p>
<p>Still, if this is too much of a risky bet for you, a much better alternative is Martin Truex Jr. to finish in the top 3.</p>
<p>Picks: Chris Buescher to win; Martin Truex Jr. to finish in the top 3</p>
