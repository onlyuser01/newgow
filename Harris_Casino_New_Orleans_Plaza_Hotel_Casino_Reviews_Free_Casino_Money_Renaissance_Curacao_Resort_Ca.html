    <h1>Harris Casino New Orleans Plaza Hotel Casino Reviews Free Casino Money Renaissance Curacao Resort Ca</h1>

<p>Sightline Payments continues to bring digital solutions to more casinos across the US. Developed to offer cashless gambling solutions, it has branched out to offer other options, such as mobile apps and loyalty programs. Sightline has made significant strides expanding across the country and just added one more name to its list. It signed a deal to supply the Indigo Sky Casino in Oklahoma with its Joingo platform.</p>
<p>Joingo Comes To Indigo Sky</p>
<p>Indigo Sky is owned and operated by the Eastern Shawnee Tribe of Oklahoma. It is one of the most popular casinos in northeastern Oklahoma. The casino floor boasts over 1,400 gaming machines and various table games. There is also a bingo hall. Two hotel towers are located within the resort, as well as an RV park. In addition, Creekside Bar &amp; Grill is home to the only golf simulator in the area.</p>
<p>Sightline announced Wednesday that Joingo, its mobile loyalty platform, will be launched at Indigo Sky in Oklahoma during the first quarter of this year. The Indigo Sky-branded mobile application will leverage Joingo’s seamless integration to the IGT ADVANTAGE casino management system. It will offer mobile marketing tools that provide patrons with a unified experience using their iOS or Android smartphones.</p>
<p>Sightline and IGT announced a partnership in 2021 to help with the deployment of cashless gaming technology using IGT’s suite systems innovations, including Resort Wallet with IGT Payment. The partnership was recently extended to include Joingo. Sightline’s first product launch with IGT will be this Joingo mobile loyalty platform at Indigo Sky.</p>
<p>Joingo is available at almost 100 casinos across the country. Its apps have been downloaded more than 2.5 million times.</p>
<p>Significant CX Gains for Indigo Sky</p>
<p>Indigo Sky can increase customer engagement through mobile-driven marketing with Sightline’s mobile loyalty program. The platform can be integrated with Indigo Sky’s non-gaming and casino management systems. It allows the property to send automated, real-time marketing messages to guests’ smartphones with personalized GO Rewards Club activations.</p>
<p>Indigo Sky will allow guests to check in via the mobile app. This eliminates the need to wait in line at kiosks. It also plans to integrate its mobile application with IGT’s Resort Wallet and IGT Pay solutions at a later time.</p>
<p>Sightline senior VP Kirk Olson states that the Indigo Sky App will offer a “seamless, mobile-first experience” that consumers expect. He adds, “Sightline’s mobile loyalty platform allows casinos to modernize their customer experience and enhance their marketing capabilities by adopting mobile solutions.”</p>
<p>Indigo Sky’s mobile app will be made available on the Apple App Store, as well as the Google Play Store.</p>
