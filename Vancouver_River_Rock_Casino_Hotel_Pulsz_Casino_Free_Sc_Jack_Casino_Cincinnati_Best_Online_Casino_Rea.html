<p>Reply from 21prive complaints team</p>
<p>"Dear Mr Smyth,</p>
<p>We reference your recent dispute and have undertaken a review of your account.</p>
<p>We note that you deposited using a payment method that does not belong to you. We draw your attention to clause 7.2 of our terms and conditions https://www.21prive.com/index.php?page=terms which provides "You may only use payment methods registered in your own name to make deposits."</p>
<p>We further reference the warranties you agreed to when creating this account, excerpts of which have been included below:</p>
<p>"4.1 By opening an account with us and/or by using the Website you acknowledge, agree and warrant that you:</p>
<p>• have a valid bank account or credit or debit card issued in your name or alternative payment method;</p>
<p>• you are the legitimate owner of the money you deposit and any money that you deposit into your account is not tainted with any illegality and does not originate from any illegal activity or source;</p>
<p>4.2 In the event of any of the warranties outlined in clause 4.1 (Registering Your Account) being false, your stake will be forfeited, and we shall not be obliged to pay any winnings. We may also report the matter to the police, parents (in relation to underage gambling) and the appropriate regulatory authority."</p>
<p>Therefore, and in accordance with clause 13 of our Terms and Conditions, the below actions were taken:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Your account was terminated with immediate effect.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You were banned from the group.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The deposits of £500 were returned to the payment source it originated from.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We further draw your attention to clause 13 of our terms and conditions, excerpts of which have been included below for ease of reference:</p>
<p>"13.2 We reserve the right to close your account at any time for any reason.</p>
<p>13.3 Where we terminate your account due to you breaching any of the terms as set out below, we shall void any winnings:</p>
<p>• you are in breach or any of your warranties</p>
<p>• If it’s proven that you have played at any other online casino in bad faith or under any of the circumstances set out above."</p>

<p>They have not provided any evidence to support those outlandish claim. The PayPal account I used to deposit my funds was indeed in my name and they both did not ask me to provide any evidence to counter their claim and only found out this information as part of my complaint. Why was this information not provided in the first place so I could have had an opportunity to prove otherwise? It's simply not good enough to suggest I've deposited under a payment method that's not my own and not ask for any supporting evidence to prove the account is mine. Also to withhold this information deliberately until the 11th hour despite me continuously asking for a reason as to why my account had been blocked and you knowingly having this information and not providing it to me on multiple occasions is extremely disingenuous. You have no right to confiscate my winnings on this basis as you've not allowed me any opportunity to provide any evidence to suggest the account belongs to me. I had no idea this was your poor excuse as at no point did you advise me.</p>
<p>Casino guru, please can you comment on this?</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>
<p>Aaron</p>
