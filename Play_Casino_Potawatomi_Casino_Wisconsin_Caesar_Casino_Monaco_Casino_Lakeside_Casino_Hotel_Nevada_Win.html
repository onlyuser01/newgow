    <h1>Play Casino Potawatomi Casino Wisconsin Caesar Casino Monaco Casino Lakeside Casino Hotel Nevada Win</h1>

<p>Thank you for bringing your concerns to our attention regarding our decision on your gameplay. We appreciate your acknowledgment of rule 7.2 in our casino terms and conditions. However, upon reviewing the player's account and actions and gaming activity across our other brands, we stand by our initial decision.</p>
<p>We understand that switching from high-risk betting to low-risk betting after experiencing a significant win may seem like a natural response to safeguard your winnings. However, we would like to clarify the basis of our decision to deem this behavior as a violation of our terms and conditions.</p>
<p>As stated by the player in a previous post, the player mentioned having a wager of €12,000 and expressed concern about converting such a high bonus wagering requirement. This statement implies that the player’s decision to switch to low volatility games was primarily motivated by completing the substantial bonus wagering requirement rather than mere caution after winning.</p>
<p>While we do recognize that casino games incorporate a house edge to ensure profitability bonuses given do not afford this same edge. It is crucial to understand that bonuses and promotions are offered to enhance the gaming experience and provide additional excitement to our players. The terms and conditions associated with these bonuses are in place to maintain fairness, protect against bonus abuse / bonus hunting, and ensure that all players are given an equal opportunity to enjoy the benefits.</p>
<p>Switching to low-risk bets strategically to meet wagering requirements can be seen as exploiting the bonus, as it guarantees a certain level of profit while reducing the associated risks. Such behavior goes against the spirit of fair play and may be considered as bonus manipulation.</p>
<p>Our decision to enforce the terms and conditions in this case is aimed at upholding the integrity of our bonus offerings and creating a level playing field for all our customers. It is not about penalizing low-risk bets but rather ensuring that our bonuses are used as intended.</p>
<p>We encourage responsible gaming and are committed to providing transparent and reliable information to all our players. Having said that, we also hold our players to a responsible standard, expecting them to understand and adhere to the limitations outlined in our bonus terms and conditions.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Levi,</p>
<p>Communications Manager.</p>
