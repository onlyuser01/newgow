    <h1>Argosy Hotel And Casino Kansas City Missouri Harrah S Casino Biloxi Mississippi Wildhorse Resort Cas</h1>

<p>Hello Halil.</p>
<p>Sorry that it takes longer, but we needed to decide carefully and evaluate all the facts. We consult the case internally cross departments and here is the result:</p>
<p>So let's start with the easiest:</p>
<p>You are complaining about casino license.</p>
<p>In this case, Curacao license can't be used as a licensing authority for Dutch players, but the casino can take you if some local law does not prohibit this. You are just not protected by Curacao license. (that's the reason some casinos has two or more licenses)</p>
<p>From our perspective, you can complain to your government or their licensing authority if you wish so, but we are evaluating the fairness of gambling at first place. In this point, if you decided to play in this casino even if you know that Curacao license doesn't cover Dutch player you did it solely on your responsibility. This is your 9th complaint on our website and in 3 of them, you mentioned the same situation as here. You played and lost and then asking for a refund.</p>
<p>In this matter, we are using our fair gambling codex: https://casino.guru/fair-gambling-codex-for-casinos</p>
<p>So let's look closer to the problem of what happens if you played in the casino from a restricted country. There are two possible situations:</p>
<p>1) If you lost fairly, you have no right for refund. If the casino accepts your bet, they should also pay your winning even if you are from a restricted country. After the casino pays out the winnings to the player, his account should be closed. (casino should not take players from restricted countries)</p>
<p>2) The casino should refund the player who is from a restricted country. In the case where the player wins, void players winnings.</p>
<p>We think that the first option is the right one. Because in case of second option player may lose and not ask for a refund, which we consider as unfair (because he had no chance of winning but has a chance of losing)</p>
<p>In your case (and from 3 of your complaints) is evident that Curacao licensing authority prefers to make an option 2 (refund)</p>
<p>Our opinion is that you played and lost fairly, so you have no right for a refund, but if the licensing authority prefers the way of refounds instead of option1, it's up to them. (you wrote to them so we will see what happens)</p>
<p>The second problem:</p>
<p>The freezing the account feature is nice to have, but not mandatory for Curacao license. I wish one-day the possibility to freeze the account (set the time till when the account will be frozen) would be a standard. But unfortunately, nowadays there is no global definition of how this freezing should work even when probably everybody knows how it should. I understand that you expect something else from this feature and casino describes completely different functionality as probably many players expected. ("we don't freeze accounts with positive balance" - from your message/originally from a phone call) In this case, you asked support to freeze your account, but this never happened probably because of different functionality as you expected. Then you cancelled your withdrawal and lost all the money. In this case, you gambled them fairly, and I believe that you have no right for refund eighter.</p>
<p>We are always happy to help you, but because you are complaining a lot on different casinos, and you were also unable to hold yourself and you lost your winnings, I am worried about you. Maybe you should consider to take a break from gambling or at least consider to choose a casino which has excellent player protection.</p>
