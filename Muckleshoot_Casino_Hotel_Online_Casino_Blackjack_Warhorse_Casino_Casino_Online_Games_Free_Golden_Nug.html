<p>The prominent studio and developer of games continues to march on in regulated European markets, with the latest partnership struck in Germany</p>
<p>Jokerstar has welcomed the opportunity to expand its local market clout through the addition of a number of premium games by Swintt. The operator is a prominent name in the regulated market and has a strong pull with local audiences.</p>
<p>This is only going to improve over the next weeks and months as Swintt is introducing a variety of titles that will be incorporated into the core gameplay. Among those are the company’s Book slot series, including Master of Books Unlimited and Seven Books Unlimited, which come chockful of excellent features such as free spins, mystery symbols and more.</p>
<p>Swintt will also be delivering a range of additional games as well, including the Secret Spellbook Respin, which offers players a chance to activate optional respin features, bonuses and more. The integration will also feature the Swintt Select portfolio of games that will be added to Jokerstar’s portfolio.</p>
<p>Swintt will further be adding prominent games that have achieved critical acclaim and success with players, such as The Crown slot game which features Vinnie Jones, Aloha Spirit XtraLock, and many others. Swintt head of business development Lars Kollind welcomed the opportunity and said that the company has long been interested in the German market, adding:</p>
<p>We’re thrilled to now have the chance to share all of these exciting titles with German players through our new partnership with Jokerstar. Swintt head of business development Lars Kollind</p>
<p>In particular, Kollind was happy to see the company’s premium slot games reach players through the operator and bring both excellent features and aesthetics that German players are bound to enjoy. Jokerstar DE CEO Juergen Kling was of a similarly positive mind commenting on the partnership.</p>
<p>Jokerstar Players Set to Benefit from Excellent Gameplay</p>
<p>“At Jokerstar, our goal has always been to provide all the excitement of an in-person casino experience to players from the comfort of their own homes – and partnering with Swintt will certainly enable us to further enhance our slot offering,” Kling explained. The quick-fire gameplay provided by Swintt will definitely strike home with German players at Jokerstar, the executive said.</p>
<p>Swintt has been staying busy all the while. The company released a new Native American-themed game early in March with Takutiki hitting regulated markets.</p>
