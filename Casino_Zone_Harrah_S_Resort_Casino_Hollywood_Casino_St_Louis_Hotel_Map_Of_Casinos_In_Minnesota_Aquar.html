<p>Peter &amp; Sons, a prominent iGaming studio and developer of online casino content, started the year on a strong foot with the introduction of Dragon Blox GigaBlox, a six-by-six slot game featuring the company’s signature Game Engagement Mechanic.</p>
<p>The studio’s consistently robust performance has now resulted in a new business development that sees SkillOnNet, an online casino specialist that powers a number of tier-one operators worldwide invest in the company.</p>
<p>The news was shared via an email press release and it is the result of SkillOnNet’s ambition to expand the content it provides for third-party casino brands it works with. Among those are major brands such as DrückGlück, PlayOJO, Genting Casino, Spin Genie, Metal Casino, and many others.</p>
<p>Peter &amp; Sons will be able to extend its own reach with many of these brands as a result of the investment, with the studio having developed more than 20 distinguished titles to date. Among those are games such as MonsterBlox, The Legend of Musashi, Johnan Legendarian, and many others.</p>
<p>Commenting on the opportunity, SkillOnNet Senior VP of Corporate Development, Maor Nutkevitch, said that the company was honored to be working with a rising star such as Peter &amp; Sons. He assured that through SkillOnNet, this up-and-coming studio will have the opportunity to considerably grow its footprint in the iGaming industry and benefit from new audiences.</p>
<p>Peter &amp; Sons’ Co-Founder Mitri Wiberg was similarly pleased with the investment. Thanks to this "joint venture," Wiberg said, the company would be able to expedite its pace of development and also create more innovative and worthwhile content options for its players.</p>
<p>The partnership with SkillOnNet is a tremendous opportunity, Wiberg says, and its financial dimensions are not the only consideration to speak of. Presently, Peter &amp; Sons operates out of its offices in Armenia and Spain, and it will use the latest investment to expand its team and bring even more worthwhile options for players and partner operators.</p>
<p>Peter &amp; Sons is already part of the Yggdrasil Masters program and it is similarly featured on the Silver Bullet portfolio by Relax Gaming. Both of these, combined with SkillOnNet, give the studio a significant presence in the iGaming sector.</p>
