<p>One of the world’s largest gambling companies Caesars Entertainment, Inc., has signed a 10-year partnership with SportsBetting.com owner and operator Carousel Group. This agreement is set to increase Carousel Group’s addressable market in the US to a whopping $1.8 billion.</p>
<p>Caesars Brings Carousel’s Sportsbook to 3 New States</p>
<p>Caesars Entertainment Inc., one of the world’s largest gambling companies, has signed a multi-state partnership with Carousel Group. The 10-year deal will bring the company’s online sportsbook – SportsBetting.com – to customers in New Jersey, Indiana, and Iowa. This comes on the tail of another market-access deal in Colorado last year where SportsBetting.com first launched.</p>
<p>This deal will increase Carousel Group’s market share in the US to an estimated $1.8 billion, an increase from $109 million. The agreement allows Carousal to tap into lucrative iGaming markets. New Jersey’s GGR increased steadfastly throughout 2020, hitting $961m last year from previously $483 million last year.</p>
<p>“We closed out 2020 with the launch of SportsBetting.com in Colorado, and we are thrilled to start 2021 with the announcement of our multi-state agreement with Caesars, a giant in the casino industry and the perfect strategic partner to help us aggressively expand our market access in the US,” Daniel Graetzer, President and CEO of Carousel Group, said.</p>
<p>Caesars Entertainment’s Impressive Corporate Responsibility</p>
<p>Being one of the biggest gambling companies in the world is not the only milestone that Caesars Entertainment Inc. has achieved. The company has achieved new goals and is currently the 104th place in Newsweek’s list of “America’s Most Responsible Companies” for 2020.</p>
<p>Many other achievements follow the company, the international environmental non-profit CDP Worldwide, U.S. Pan Asian American Chamber of Commerce Education Foundation (USPAACC), and Human Rights Campaign Foundation have all recognized Caesars for different efforts in various fields.</p>
<p>CDP has acknowledged Caesars’ commitment to significantly reducing its carbon footprint and its water consumption throughout the US. The company earned two spots on CDP’s “A-list.”</p>
<p>Caesars Entertainment has also scored a 100% perfect score for the 14th year in a row from the Human Rights Campaign Foundation, as well as naming the company “Best Place to Work for LGBTQ+ Equality.”</p>
<p>Last but not least, USPAACC has named Caesars as one of its “Top 35 Corporation Stars,” which is an impressive feat on the company’s part.</p>
<p>Graetzer added that he was excited to partner with Caesars for the opportunity to bring SportsBetting.com’s high-grade wagering and casino platforms to three new states. The website comes with cutting-edge mobile-responsive architecture and dedicated casino and sports betting apps to serve savvy customers.</p>
<p>Carousel doesn’t plan on stopping there either. The company’s in-house tech and design principle guarantee its long-term success in the United States.</p>
