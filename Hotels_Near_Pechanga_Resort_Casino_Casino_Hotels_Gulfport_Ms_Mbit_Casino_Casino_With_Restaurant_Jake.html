<p>Casino is an important part of the company’s product mix and will allow Buzz Group to diversify its offering</p>
<p>Buzz Group, the group behind Buzz Bingo, has forayed into the world of online casino gaming with a new brand. The company just launched Buzz Casino, its first iGaming subsidiary. The newly-launched site will complement Buzz Group’s existing bingo business.</p>
<p>As announced, the new iGaming platform has been developed by Playtech, Buzz Group’s existing iGaming technology partner. The site will feature a selection of slots, table games and live casino offerings.</p>
<p>Buzz Casino is the logical continuation of the company’s growth journey. The company’s current form was formed in 2018. Since then, Buzz Group has been steadily expanding its business. However, its numerous retail bingo shops were dramatically impacted by the pandemic and the company is still struggling to rebound.</p>
<p>The launch of the new brand is in line with the company’s efforts to diversify its business. Before rolling out the new iGaming brand, for example, Buzz Group launched a live bingo streaming service.</p>
<p>Buzz Group continues its efforts to recover from the lasting effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Prior to the pandemic, the company operated 91 bingo locations in Britain but was forced to close nine of them amid the pandemic.</p>
<p>Buzz Group Is Excited to Launch the New Brand</p>
<p>Dave Evans, Buzz Group’s digital operations director, commented on the launch, saying that his team is “really proud” to foray into the world of iGaming. According to him, this will cement his company as the best omnichannel operator of slots, casino games and bingo.</p>
<p>Casino is an important part of our product mix, and whilst bingo is still at the heart of our business, our players love to experience new content and spend their leisure time playing in different ways. Dave Evans, digital operations director, Buzz Group</p>
<p>Evans added that the launch of an iGaming brand is but the latest part in the company’s journey as it continues to leverage over 50 years of experience to engage its players.</p>
<p>Laura Craddock, Buzz Group’s head of product management, also commented on the matter. She said that she feels very excited to bring a new product to the market, “especially one that brings all the fun of Buzz Bingo to the casino world.” Despite the similarities, the new site will adopt new principles, she noted.</p>
<p>Inspiration from the streaming video world has helped make content the focus of the UI, making it easy for players to find the games they love, in a fun and trusted environment they know they’ll get from a Buzz venue. Laura Craddock, head of product management, Buzz Group</p>
<p>Last year, Buzz Bingo teamed up with the Stroke Association to provide survivors with a second chance at life.</p>
