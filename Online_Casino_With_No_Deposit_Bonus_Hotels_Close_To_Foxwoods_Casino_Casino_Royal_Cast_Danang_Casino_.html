<p>Betway has become the official sports betting partner of Spanish La Liga champions Atlético de Madrid.</p>
<p>The online gaming operator signed a two-year global partnership, excluding in Spain and Asia, with the 11-time Spanish champions to increase its presence in the sporting sphere.</p>
<p>The deal will see Betway’s branding feature pitch-side on LED advertising boards at the club’s Wanda Metropolitano Stadium in domestic and European fixtures. The operator will also have access to Atlético’s players and the ability to produce social and digital content for the football club’s fans.</p>
<p>Betway CEO Anthony Werkman said: "We’re incredibly proud to become the official sports betting partner of the current La Liga champions, Atlético de Madrid.</p>
<p>"We’re excited to have an agreement with oneofthebiggest clubs involved in both La Liga and the Champions League; two of the most viewed sporting competitions around the world."</p>
<p>"With a team full of internationally recognised names, this partnership will gain further exposure for our brand, that has an ambitious global vision."</p>
<p>Betway already boasts an extensive list of sporting sponsorships. It is currently the main shirt sponsor of English Premier League team West Ham United. While in July, the operator became the premium partner of German Bundesliga club VFB Stuttgart and the official betting partner of league rival Eintracht Frankfurt. It sponsors all of the West Indies’ men and women home international cricket matches, and within the last year signed sponsorship deals with the South African rugby and cricket teams.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Entain-owned bwin has become an official partner of both the UEFA Europa and UEFA Europa Conference Leagues for the next three seasons. The operator will benefit from a high visibility of its branding in both competitions, appearing on broadcast backdrops and in-stadia advertising boards. It will also have a strong presence on social media platforms of both competitions.</p>
<p>The partnership will also see bwin support UEFA’s clampdown against match-fixing and the operator will commit to promoting responsible betting through the deal with European club football’s second premier competition and the newly formed Conference League.</p>
<p>In August, the operator extended its exclusive sports betting partnership deals with German football clubs Borussia Dortmund, Union Berlin, Cologne, St. Pauli and Dynamo Dresden, until 2024.</p>
