<p>Flamingo Las Vegas: Injured Marie Osmond Says Let’s Get On with the (Final) Show</p>

<p>Famed entertainer Marie Osmond is not letting an injured knee keep her from performing Saturday with her brother Donny for their last show, as they cap off an 11-year run at the Flamingo in Las Vegas.</p>

<p>Prime tickets for the final performance are selling for as much as approximately $4,000, according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal. Resale tickets were selling between $150 and almost $1,700 on Thursday, according to a Ticketmaster website.</p>
<p>Marie, 60, may not dance during the show, but she promised TV fans on The Talk she will sing during the 90-minute performance. Songs the two will perform are likely to include such favorites as: “Puppy Love,” “Paper Roses,” “I’m Leavin’ It (All) Up To You” and “Soldier of Love.”</p>
<p>Donny had offered to do the show himself. But Marie would have none of that.</p>
<p>Her injuries came from two recent stage falls. She suffered a bruised and chipped bone and torn meniscus in her right knee last week during the show, according to the Review-Journal.</p>
<p>“I probably won’t be dancing a lot, but I will be [there] — I can sing,” Marie told fans. “I’m pretty black and blue, it’s really pretty…. So, for those of you that have bought tickets for that last week, I will be there.”</p>
<p>The most recent injury apparently was caused after her boot got stuck on the stage floor, according to KSNV News. That kept her from turning her leg, leading to the injury.</p>
<p>The show will go on,” Marie added in a Wednesday Facebook post. “You have all been so amazing these last 11 years, and nothing will stop me from the last few shows at Flamingo Las Vegas Hotel &amp; Casino. Love you all. Thank you for your prayers.”</p>
<p>The brother and sister act first appeared at the Flamingo in September 2008. Their show kept on getting extended because of its popularity.</p>
<p>Rather than having a huge audience, the siblings opted to have a more intimate performance, with just 750 fans in attendance each night at the Donny &amp; Marie Showroom.</p>
<p>VitalVegas.com reported five years ago that Donny and Marie Osmond are each paid a base salary of $1.6 million, plus 40 percent of the box office gross. The report is based on an earlier lawsuit.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, there may be future performances featuring Donny and Marie. “The end of the Donny &amp; Marie show is not the end of Donny and Marie,” Donny Osmond recently said on TV, according to People magazine.</p>
<p>Donny, Marie Perform for Many Decades</p>
<p>The two initially performed on the Andy Williams Show back in the 1960s. Then, in the 1970s they got their own variety show on ABC.</p>
<p>The Donny &amp; Marie TV show ran for three years between 1976 and 1979, and the Friday night broadcast was one of television’s biggest hits. Around 14 million viewers tuned in each week.</p>
<p>Marie went off to work on her own show after the show with her brother was canceled. The Marie show was canceled after several episodes.</p>
<p>The pair teamed up again to host a syndicated TV talk show. That lasted for a couple of years.</p>
<p>Celine Dion, Marshmello Stop Their Las Vegas Gigs, Too</p>
<p>Donny and Marie are not the only top Las Vegas shows to recently call it quits. Celine Dion also stopped performing earlier this year after 16 years at the Colosseum at Caesars Palace.</p>
<p>Also, Christopher Comstock — known professionally as Marshmello — the now ex-DJ at Kaos Nightclub at The Palms Las Vegas — had his residency end midway between his $60 million, two-year booking.</p>
