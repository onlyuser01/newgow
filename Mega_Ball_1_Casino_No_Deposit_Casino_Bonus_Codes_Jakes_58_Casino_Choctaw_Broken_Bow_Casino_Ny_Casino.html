<p>Crown Resorts is well on a path to recovery, and still smarting from its most recent brush with the law. Yet, the company is confident that it can rectify the situation and part of this requires strong leadership. Who better than David Tsai to step in as a chief executive officer for Crown Perth.</p>
<p>David Tsai Brings Decades of Experience</p>
<p>The newly appointed chief executive, who is still awaiting regulatory approval, is set to step into his new role before the end of 2023. He has amassed significant experience in running casino resorts, having served for 15 years in various MGM Resorts International roles.</p>
<p>His most recent position as part of MGM saw him as president of Midwest Group, where he was responsible for the overall strategy. He also ran the day-to-day activities at the MGM Grand Detroit in Michigan, one of the most profitable casinos in the Great Lakes States, and the MGM Northfield Park in Ohio. Crown Resorts CEO Ciarán Carruthers welcomed the appointment of his new colleague and said:</p>
<p>Crown Perth is a world-class property and David is a world-class leader with a proven track record and deep experience in global hospitality and entertainment. I’m delighted to welcome him to the team. Crown Resorts CEO Ciarán Carruthers</p>
<p>Tsai’s appointment will be instrumental as the company seeks to recover from its run-in with regulators throughout Australia. Tsai will be in charge of the Western Australia path towards sustainability and overall strategy that places the company on the regulators’ good side.</p>
<p>Tsai Is Ready to Take Over Pending Regulatory Approval</p>
<p>The executive will seek to implement the recommendations pitched by the Perth Casino Royal Commission in full. Carruthers shared his confidence that Tsai was the right appointment who will guide the company towards sustainability and ensure that safe and responsible gaming can continue as intended.</p>
<p>Commenting on his appointment, Tsai said that he looked forward to working alongside the team at Crown Perth. He added that he was already pleased with the opportunity to work at a casino known for its outstanding facilities, entertainment, and premium restaurants, among others. Not least, Tsai noted that he was honored to be able to join a team of 6,000-strong people who are working dedicatedly to make gaming safer and more responsible.</p>
