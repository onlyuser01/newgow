<p>SciPlay, a provider of engaging and thrilling casino, casual and bingo mobile social games has named the experienced Jim Bombassei as its new chief financial officer, executive vice president and secretary.</p>
<p>Bombassei Has Decades of Experience in the Finance Sector</p>
<p>Bombassei will commence work on December 1 and will be responsible for overseeing SciPlay’s financial operations. He will collaborate with the leadership and business teams and devise new strategies to grow the company.</p>
<p>Bombassei is a seasoned industry veteran who boasts 25 years of experience in corporate finance and investor relations. He is currently the SVP of investor relations at Light &amp; Wonder, another industry-leading iGaming products provider. Bombassei’s earlier experiences include a long two-decade-long tenure at Paramount Global, where he occupied various leadership positions.</p>
<p>In his new position, Bombassei will succeed Daniel O’Quinn who served as an interim CFO for a year. The latter will continue working for SciPlay to ensure a seamless transition of responsibilities. After that, O’Quinn will remain on the finance team as VP of finance.</p>
<p>Wilson Welcomed Bombassei on Board</p>
<p>Josh Wilson, SciPlay’s chief executive officer, said that his company’s goal is to become the top mobile gaming company in the world. To that end, the provider seeks to reinforce its team with seasoned professionals that will help it maintain its momentum. Bombassei, Wilson believes, is the exact person for the job.</p>
<p>Jim is an accomplished and strategic financial executive with extensive global experience and a demonstrated track record of success across multiple industries. He brings a broad perspective to SciPlay with his keen understanding of the investment community, capital markets and value creation. As we advance on our strategy, Jim is the right leader for SciPlay’s finance organization. Josh Wilson, CEO, SciPlay</p>
<p>Wilson added that SciPlay currently has one of the best executive leadership teams in the entire industry. Thanks to this, he emphasized, the company is able to maintain strong stability and is set up for a great future. Wilson thanked O’Quinn for his exceptional service as an interim CFO and said that he is happy the latter will continue working for the company.</p>
<p>Bombassei also spoke about his new position. He said that he is nothing short of thrilled to join SciPlay at such a pivotal time and is excited to capitalize on the company’s momentum.</p>
<p>Drawn by the company’s strong culture of collaboration, innovation, and excellence, I see a compelling opportunity to drive significant growth and shareholder value and I look forward to partnering with Josh and the entire team to unlock SciPlay’s full potential. Jim Bombassei, CFO, SciPlay</p>
