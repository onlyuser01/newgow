    <h1>Circus Circus Hotel Casino Las Vegas Reviews Grand Casino Milacs New York New York Hotel And Casino</h1>

<p>Hi TravenUrr,</p>
<p>Thank you for your query regarding your withdrawal of $4,200.</p>
<p>From review of your account, we see that you redeemed a $50 free chip that carries a maximum cash out limit of $100. You then played this bonus up to a balance of $1569.51. Thereafter, whilst having this bonus balance (which carries a maximum cash out limit of $100), you made 2 x $25 deposits, and then played this up to an amount $4,220.18. Please note that this balance would still carry a maximum cash out limit of $100, as the balance initially originated from the $50 free chip.</p>
<p>We would like to bring point number 3 to your attention under our free bonus terms and conditions, which is available on our website:</p>
<p>"Wagering bonus money or winnings originating from bonus money in conjunction with a deposit greater than $10 is not permitted. Winnings generated from such gameplay will be restricted to the terms of the bonus. Winnings over and above the originally stated maximum cashout on the bonus will be forfeited."</p>
<p>Regardless of the withdrawable balance stated in the cashier upon initiating your funds, all withdrawals are subject to a final audit by our finance department, in order to determine the correct amount payable.</p>
<p>We would hate to see this happen to you again and suggest that in future, you read through all our bonus terms and conditions before redeeming any of our bonus offers to avoid situations like this going forward. Donâ€™t forget that if you are ever unsure of anything, you are always welcome to contact our friendly support team, who will gladly assist you.</p>
<p>If you have any further questions or concerns, feel free to contact us directly.</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Platinum Reels Team</p>
