<p>Britons love their royals, and when it comes to marriages and pregnancies, bookmakers see a flurry of wagering activity on the possible outcomes. Though Prince Harry and Meghan take a backseat in importance to his older brother Prince William and wife Catherine – Duchess of Cambridge – the excitement regarding the newest addition to the royal family nonetheless has captivated the UK.</p>
<p>William Hill spokesman Rupert Adams told the Associated Press that the bookmaker closed betting on the gender of the baby after an “avalanche” of bets came in on a girl.</p>
<p>“The secret’s out, as far as we’re concerned,” Adams explained. “It could be because someone somewhere has seen the scan, or someone has heard something.”</p>
<p>Not all bookmakers are so convinced. Paddy Power, Betfair, and Coral still have odds on the gender, with girl the favorite at 4/7, and boy the underdog at 5/4. At that line, a $100 bet and the baby turning out to be a girl nets $57.14.</p>
<p>According to OddsChecker, 73 percent of wagers have been made on Meghan giving birth to a girl. Books say the betting favorite date for the birth is April 21.</p>
<p>Diana Tribute</p>
<p>The general consensus among novelty bettors fixated on the royal birth say Diana is likeliest to be the child’s name. Paddy Power has the name of Harry’s mother at 3/1, or implied odds of 25 percent.</p>
<p>Adams said he isn’t sold on the royal couple naming their first-born child after Prince Diana, who tragically died in a car accident in 1997. Royal historian Carolyn Harris agrees.</p>
<p>The choice of Diana as a first name would place a lot of pressure on the royal baby, as the press would constantly compare her to her famous grandmother,” Harris stated.</p>
<p>There’s an abundance of other name options on the betting board – and in typical Paddy Power style, some are rather absurd. After Diane, the Irish bookmaker has Grace at 7/1. Should the child be a boy, the odds favor Arthur at 12/1.</p>
<p>Other leading contenders include Victoria and Alice (14/1), and James and Edward at 16/1. Harry naming the child after himself is longer at 66/1. A few of the comical betting choices include Jesus, Muhammad, and Buddha – all at 500/1.</p>
<p>Baby Bets</p>
<p>UK oddsmakers are serving up a smorgasbord of novelty prop bets on the royal birth. Bettors can take odds on whether Meghan will give birth to twins (9/2), triplets (80/1), quadruplets (200/1), and even quintuplets (500/1).</p>
<p>Paddy Power has a futures line on whether Prince Louis, who was born last April, or Prince Harry’s child, will go bald first. Louis is the favorite at 8/11.</p>
<p>As for the baby’s weight, 8lbs – 8lbs 15 oz has the shortest odds at 7/4. Seven pounds – 7lbs 15 oz is next at 2/1.</p>
