<p>As 2018 Super Bowl Nears, Oddsmakers Confident Patriots Prevail Over Eagles</p>

<p>The 2018 Super Bowl kicks off this Sunday, February 4, at 6:30 pm ET at US Bank Stadium in Minneapolis, Minnesota.</p>

<p>Should Las Vegas oddsmakers and NFL experts have it right, when the game concludes, the New England Patriots will hoist the franchise’s sixth Vince Lombardi Trophy.</p>
<p>The Las Vegas Super Bowl spread has stabilized, with the favorite Patriots spotting four to 4.5 points to the underdog Philadelphia Eagles. After the two teams won their respective conference championships, odds on the big game opened with the Birds getting as many as 6.5 points, the longest underdog for a Super Bowl team since 2009.</p>
<p>It quickly shrunk after a flurry of money came on Philly. But it’s since calmed to its current four or 4.5-point position.</p>
<p>NFL experts agree, with the majority of analysts predicting a Patriots victory. Should New England prevail, future Hall of Fame quarterback Tom Brady would become the first player in football history to win a sixth Super Bowl ring as a player.</p>
<p>Balancing Act</p>
<p>Las Vegas has taken considerably more money on the underdogs, meaning oddsmakers will be rooting for a New England victory Sunday night.</p>
<p>At Las Vegas casinos, the days leading up to the Super Bowl are nearly as exciting as the game itself. Oddsmakers must walk a careful line in enticing money on both sides. Much activity will come during these final 48 hours, as bettors looking to put a wager on the Patriots at the best odds run out of time.</p>
<p>For New England backers, the most attractive sportsbooks as of Friday were the Westgate SuperBook and Station Casinos, which both had the favorites at four points.</p>
<p>Caesars lengthened its line late Thursday from four to 4.5 after taking some considerable amount of money on New England.</p>
<p>As for Eagles bettors late to the game, the best odds in Las Vegas can be found, in addition to Caesars, at Wynn, William Hill locations, Mirage, Venetian, Palazzo, Tropicana, and others, all of which have the spread at 4.5 points.</p>
<p>Straight Bets</p>
<p>Bettors not looking to be impacted by the spread can of course take the moneyline offering, but New England backers will need to bet a lot to win a little.</p>
<p>As of Friday, the SuperBook has the Patriots at -190 to win, with the Eagles at +160. A $100 bet nets just $52.63 on a New England victory. Conversely, the same wager on Philadelphia nets $160 should the underdogs prevail.</p>
<p>Bettors can get an extra five spot on the Eagles at MGM and Caesars, which have Philadelphia’s moneyline at +165. Patriots backers can find better deals at Caesars (-185), William Hill (-175), Wynn (-185), and CG Technology books (-180).</p>
<p>Gamblers outside of Nevada can find 2018 Super Bowl bets online at Bovada, which has the spread at 4.5 points, and the moneyline on the Eagles at +155, and Patriots -175.</p>
