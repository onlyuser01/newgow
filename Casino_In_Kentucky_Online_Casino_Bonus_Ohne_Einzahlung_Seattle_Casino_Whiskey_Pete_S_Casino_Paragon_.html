    <h1>Casino In Kentucky Online Casino Bonus Ohne Einzahlung Seattle Casino Whiskey Pete S Casino Paragon</h1>

<p>AvatarUX has launched GemPops, a new slot with free spins and a series of innovative game mechanics introduced by the studio for the first time</p>
<p>The award-winning slots developer with a clear purpose to “create engaging games that players want to play” while turning into a market leader recognized worldwide, AvatarUX, has announced the release of GemPops, a brand new slot with a number of innovative mechanics.</p>
<p>The game will first be exclusively accessible to the studio’s partners featuring direct integrations, with the international rollover being planned for later on.</p>

<p>96% Min/Max Bet: 0.20-100</p>
<p>0.20-100 Release date: November 20, 2023</p>
<p>Reel Multipliers, Popscade Mechanic and PopWins</p>
<p>As anticipated, through the drop of the new video slot, AvatarUX, which is also one of REEVO’s freshest suppliers, has continued its mission to “create engaging, forward-looking games, mechanics, and products,” as explained by the company’s chief executive officer, Nicola Longmuir.</p>
<p>Longmuir added that they were thrilled to release the slot that incorporates exciting new mechanics meant to help players “explore extended spins and expanded paylines” during new spins.</p>
<p>Accordingly, all new spins are initiated with reels with variable height, starting at three reels up to seven positions high.</p>
<p>Plus, the game also features a reel multiplier attributed to all individual reels. The multipliers go up every time players manage to score a symbol win. While engaged in the base game, players who reach the maximum height of the reel are awarded the corresponding multiplier.</p>
<p>GemPops also incorporates the Popscade mechanic that works by making all winning symbols part of a combination vanish, while adding new ones in the form of cascading symbols pouring down from the heightened reel, as opposed to the popping movement into empty cells.</p>
<p>Free Spins, Gamble Wheel and Xpops</p>
<p>The studio, which injected its portfolio into BetConstruct in September in an attempt to reach even more players, also incorporated the Free Spins mode in the new release.</p>
<p>To trigger it, players need to land a minimum of three diamond bonus symbols. Once they enter the Free Spins round, players are allowed to activate the Gamble Wheel where they can earn the chance to benefit from more free spins and a higher starting multiplier.</p>
<p>While the bonus round is still active, players can trigger the Xpops mechanic that will make the symbols pop by a random amount, between one to four times. At the same time, players can unlock up to three additional free spins in case special bomb symbols are seen landing on the reel.</p>
<p>In case players unlock a reel to its full height during the Free Spins round, the corresponding multiplier goes to the total multiplier amount. This means an even greater win potential. Finally, the studio that partnered with Relax Gaming and became their Silver Bullet partner at the end of August also included the Ante Bet and Buy Bonus options for players in some jurisdictions, guaranteeing higher rates of engagement.</p>
