    <h1>Mardi Gras Casino Resort Temecula Casino Dover Downs Casino Hotel Mardi Gras Casino Best Casinos Veg</h1>

<p>I opened this account less than a week ago. I deposited (very silly of me) over a thousand pounds to them. I questioned them about the Merchants that were showing up on my bank (none of which are registered with Visa under the Gambling category) my debit card is actually blocked from Gambling transactions but still the deposits went through. (yes I have mental health issues and find i'm gambling too much). The reply about the Merchants from this is as follows:</p>
<p>Dear Rachel,</p>
<p>Thank you for contacting Platinumclubvip Risk-payments Team.</p>
<p>We would like to inform you that these are descriptors used by our payment provider, which is not up to us to decide, but we can see your deposits in our back office.</p>
<p>Regarding all deposits, as our terms state, the same way that we would honour any bets placed whilst the account was open we of course cannot refund any bets placed in the reverse of this.</p>
<p>Your account is now closed,will not be reopened again and i wish you all the best.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Risk Payments Team</p>
<p>Not only did they close the account (there suppose to do daily cashback) so I never got any of that before they closed the account.</p>
<p>They will not refund my Money which I find is unfair. Also I am convinced the games are fake as I play a certain game for years and when you click on the game it brings up another game, this has happened to me on a few sites I have joined this week.</p>
<p>In fact I have deposited 3k to sites a few different name sites of course and yet they all on everyone of them come up as merchants in Nigera, and I have a whole list of Merchants. Apparantly I have been doing yoga in Nigeria, been to a lactation specialist, oh the list is endless. I have been totally abused by these casino's and I guess I'm the vulnerable one and the one feeling absolutely suicidal over all of this. I did stop gambling and joined GamCare years back and am still on there but these are casino's that accept players from anywhere and take our money. I have lost thousands due to casino's excuses and they are all individual casinos. The complaints i have with certain casino's goes on and on for the last couple of years.</p>
<p>I hope you can help in these complaints. Could I list all the casino's in one complaint or individually? I'm confused.</p>
<p>I'm sending a file of casino names (lots) about 60% of them I have issues with. I don't know if you can help. I also have lots, and lots of Merchant names not under the correct category for gambling with Visa. Like I said My card is blocked from gambling transactions.</p>
<p>Please advise and help me.</p>
<p>I have a statement for transactions made on 23rd June to Platinum it won't allow me to upload. 1200 uk pounds.</p>
<p>Many thanks.</p>
