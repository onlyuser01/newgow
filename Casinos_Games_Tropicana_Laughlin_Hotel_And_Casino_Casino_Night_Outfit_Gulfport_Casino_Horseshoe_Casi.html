<p>The announcement comes ahead of a planned gambling reform in NSW and is reportedly looking to determine if the outside signage is in breach of the gambling regulation</p>
<p>Ahead of the upcoming election in New South Wales (NSW), the regulatory body responsible for gambling and liquor sales, Liquor &amp; Gaming NSW, plans to look into signs located outside gambling venues. According to a report released by IAG, Liquor &amp; Gaming NSW’s executive director of regulatory operations and enforcement, Jane Lin, spoke at a conference in Sydney called Regulating the Game.</p>
<p>During that conference, the executive director of regulatory operations and enforcement hinted that the regulator will look into the external signs that are used by gambling venues. Lin explained that Liquor &amp; Gaming NSW will look into this “on a case-by-case basis, like we always do, as to whether we think signage is compliant.”</p>
<p>Currently, the advertising of gambling venues via outdoor signs is prohibited under the active regulations in NSW. However, gambling locations have found a smart way to avoid this restriction by placing external signs such as “VIP Lounge.” Although this isn’t direct advertising, such locations are most of the time associated with gambling, which means that gambling venues have found a way to void the promotional signage restriction.</p>
<p>“The wording of the legislation is such that we need to take a look at what can be done in terms of taking enforcement action.“ Jane Lin, executive director of regulatory operations and enforcement at Liquor &amp; Gaming NSW</p>
<p>According to Lin, some 80% of the gambling locations around NSW had “some sort of signage that might indicate the presence of gaming machines inside.” Although she explained that Liquor &amp; Gaming NSW will look into this matter, she acknowledged that legislative changes may be needed. Lin pointed out that in the end, it may not be the regulator that takes action, considering that NSW parties that are competing in the upcoming election have shown support for major changes within the gambling sector.</p>
<p>Overhaul of the NSW Gaming Sector Yet to Start</p>
<p>Recently, much was said about the legislative changes within the gambling sector in NSW. The two major parties competing in the upcoming election have both voiced their support for changes in the sector, given that they win the election.</p>
<p>Among the proposed changes is the implementation of a cashless gaming card. This method is expected to help in the fight against financial crimes within the gambling sector such as money laundering. Additionally, the cashless gaming card will hopefully curb the rate of problem gambling and help reduce gambling harm.</p>
