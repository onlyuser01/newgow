<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Please see below the basic outline of my complaint regarding 1RedCasino. In addition, I would like to point out they currently operate under operates under the Master License of Gaming Services Provider, N.V. #365/JAZ (Gaming-curacao) who have stated previously they take responsible gambling seriously and will act as such as outlined in Case study 2 in an article from Thepogg.com. Here is the link to the article - https://thepogg.com/regulator/curacao-egaming/ I initially sought help from ThePogg but feel they might've misunderstood the nature of my complaint and you guys seem quicker to respond so I thought I would send you this information and seek your thoughts on the matter. Basically, I am asking for assistance (most likely in seeking out the regulator) as I believe they - specifically my VIP manager for both casinos - breached the terms of the license by personally contacting me about opening a new account at a new casino while knowing I was a gambling addict who had become suicidal.</p>
<p>I have attached live chat logs but have a trove of back and forth emails I would also like to send through but am unaware how you would like to receive them i.e., screenshots or can I forward them somewhere? I am also awaiting my correspondence and communications from the first casino which I will also provide when I have received them. Please let me know your thoughts on the entire matter when you can.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Ashley Van Beek</p>
<p>Original complaint email written to Casino/VIP manager -</p>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Please consider this my outline of my official complaint regarding my experience with 1Red Casino (and more specifically my VIP Manager - James).</p>
<p>I have sent, what must be, 25 emails at least attempting to speak to someone about it and have not received an adequate response. In short here is a quick summary of my complaint/experience -</p>
<p>My VIP manager had previously been my VIP manager at another casino and that relationship ended when I told him I was having massive problems with gambling and I was going to end up dead soon if the situation persisted as it was - my account was made to be closed basically immediately based on this information - he then chose to pursue me via email when he started to work for a new casino knowing already I was a problem gambler who had mentioned it causing me to be suicidal.</p>
<p>History repeated itself and my account was closed and my VIP manager advised me that I had a gambling problem and was suicidal - something he had already seen first-hand last time. Him knowing this and still reaching out to me via email I believe breaches the terms of your licence in response to Responsible Gambling and protection of gambling addicts and when I have attempted to ask to speak to someone who is not him I just keep being transferred back to him. He has then lied to me repeatedly about someone higher up/a head manager being in contact but has provided me no details of these people and they have not responded in the timeframes he has provided. He now is also no longer responding to my emails.</p>
<p>I am happy to provide much, much more information but just thought I would send through this overview of the situation regarding my treatment in regards to 1Red casino so it's all in one place as I am attempting to seek out an independent body regarding this.</p>
