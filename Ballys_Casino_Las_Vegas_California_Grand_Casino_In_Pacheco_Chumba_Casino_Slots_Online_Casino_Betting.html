    <h1>Ballys Casino Las Vegas California Grand Casino In Pacheco Chumba Casino Slots Online Casino Betting</h1>

<p>The developer of the world’s most successful crash-style game has obtained an important technical certification allowing it to expand in several European markets</p>
<p>Spribe is now able to expand its content portfolio across the region on a firmer foothold as the company has received the necessary certification from Gaming Associates to operate its advanced gaming titles in both Romania and Italy. Gaming Associates is an established testing firm that ensures that the products and games offered by an iGaming supplier are based on a fair algorithm.</p>
<p>Spribe Clears Technical Certification Hurdle</p>
<p>As an interesting bonus, the licensure in Romania is also recognized by the Malta Gaming Authority, further boosting Spribe’s reach. The company, which became famous for its Aviator game, has been delivering a range of innovative and out-of-the-box games over the past months.</p>
<p>Some of its main game titles include Mines, Goal, and Hi-Lo. All of these games have been redesigned based on popular gaming concepts. The most successful of those genres has been Aviator which invites players to push their luck by taking a plane to the sky and ejecting before the plane crashes. The farther up they soar, the bigger the multiplier win they stand to collect.</p>
<p>Commenting on this important milestone, Spribe CCO Giorgi Tsutskiridze said that the company was excited to see its Turbo Games portfolio, the collective name for the company’s innovative and unorthodox games, now be available to roll out in both markets. Tsutskiridze added:</p>
<p>This will allow our partners to stand out from their rivals through next-generation content that appeals to an important but hard to engage audience. Spribe CCO Giorgi Tsutskiridze</p>
<p>The executive noted that the entire company was excited to see how its games will fare in the new markets and what value they could bring to players with the portfolio entering the designated countries for the very first time.</p>
<p>The Supplier Continues to Grow Globally</p>
<p>Spribe is presently live with more than 2,000 operators worldwide and it continues to grow. Entering new jurisdictions in Europe will allow Spribe to significantly scale up and add more players, brands, and explore new opportunities.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Spribe obtained a license from the Spelinspektionen, the Swedish licensing and regulatory authority. The company has also been focusing on establishing aggregation partnerships, with companies such as Groove in order to further amplify its geographical footprint.</p>
