<p>British sportsbook William Hill is pushing ahead with adding to its business portfolio in the United States. William Hill is now all set to begin operating the M Resort Spa Casino in Nevada, taking Penn National’s spots betting offer to the next level.</p>
<p>William Hill Takes Control Over M Resort Spa Casino, Nevada</p>
<p>Penn National Gaming and William Hill revealed plans to collaborate for the Henderson-based M Resort Spa Casino in Nevada. With the companies awaiting regulatory approval, William Hill will be able to deploy its state-of-the-art technical solutions, allowing the company to run both the property’s racebook and sportsbook.</p>
<p>Located not so far from Las Vegas, M Resort Spa Casino is well-poised to cater to locals and tourists, offering top-notch sports betting options, which has long been part of Penn National’s own strategy. William Hill brings important expertise to the table.</p>
<p>While US sportsbooks have been far from the idea of ever expanding online, the latest push and arrival of well-seasoned overseas companies bringing staple products, including in-Play and mobile wagering options, has changed their mind. No small part of this sudden change has been thanks to the now defunct PASPA, repealed in May, 2018.</p>
<p>This is also an important upgrade for the current offer of William Hill in Nevada. The company owns over 110 shops and loungers across the state. William Hill CEO Joe Asher has confirmed the sportsbook’s satisfaction with the progress achieved with Penn National:</p>
<p>We are excited to expand our partnership with our friends at Penn National to operate the sports book at The M. It is a fabulous property, serving the Henderson and Southern Highlands areas, as well as guests from out of town, and we look forward to bringing our market-leading product to these customers</p>
<p>Penn National Gaming Senior Vice President of Regional Operations Ameet Patel said that his company was “delighted to team up” with their British partner, cited in the official media update.</p>
<p>Penn National and William Hill are not going blindly into this partnership either. Working together since 2018, William Hill has been able to demonstrate the immense value it has been able to offer to multiple Penn-owned properties in several states, including West Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Mississippi, most of which launched their online sports betting only recently and are now considering other gambling elements.</p>
<p>The M Resort Spa Casino has been active since 2009 offering a vast play area along with almost 2,000 slot machines. The addition of William Hill will help take the sports and race books up to a world standard and further consolidate William Hill’s expanding footprint in the United Statement.</p>
