    <h1>Best Online Casino For Blackjack Four Winds Casino New Buffalo Casino In Pa Casino Minnesota Casino</h1>

<p>The leading iGaming content publisher, Yggdrasil, announced the release of ReelPlay's latest thrilling slot game, King Arthur 10K WAYS. Launched on Thursday, the latest release was developed by ReelPlay under Yggdrasil's YG Masters program. The release of King Arthur 10K WAYS follows the launch of other hits such as Mega Money Machine, among others.</p>
<p>The adventure-themed slot game is powered by Yggdrasil's state-of-the-art technology, GATI. Thanks to this innovative technology, products can be deployed easily as they come regulation-ready, preconfigured along with a standardized development toolkit. This provides unique capabilities and advantages for fast distribution, allowing operators to engage with new audiences.</p>
<p>Players of the new 6x4 slot game are invited to the enchanting realm of Arthurian Tales where every spin offers a chance for mouth-watering prizes. King Arthur 10K WAYS is a slot game with high volatility, features an RTP of 96.00% and grants a chance for a max win of €228,543.75. Similar to other games published by Yggdrasil, the slot is available in more than two dozen languages, supports Android and iOS, as well as desktop devices.</p>
<p>David Johnson, ReelPlay's CEO, shared his excitement about the recently released adventure slot. "King Arthur 10K WAYS incorporates ReelPlay’s hugely popular 10K WAYS mechanic alongside some incredible art and sound whilst utilizing some double-sized symbols for the first time in a 10K WAYS game," he explained in a statement. Finally, Johnson said: "ReelPlay’s 10K WAYS series has fast become a trusted IP that both operators and players alike actively seek."</p>
<p>Mark McGinley, Yggdrasil's Chief Gaming Officer, added: "King Arthur 10K WAYS sees the return of ReelPlay’s popular mechanic and takes players on a journey through British mythology to a world of knights and wizards in search of huge wins." Last but not least, he noted: "With an unlimited multiplier and giant cash rewards, our latest collaboration with ReelPlay highlights the true power of the Sword in the Stone."</p>
<p>The world-famous Excalibur sword is displayed two symbols high and serves as the Scatter in King Arthur 10K WAYS. Players who land three or more such symbols in full view can access the game's free spins mode. Once this mode is activated, they have a chance of also accessing an unlimited win multiplier.</p>
<p>It's no surprise that King Arthur 10K WAYS features the popular mechanic that removes winning combinations from the reels. This feature allows new symbols to fill in the empty spaces, allowing multiple cascading wins.</p>
