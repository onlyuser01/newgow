<p>Sports betting operator Betfred Sports has signed a partnership with the Paragon Casino Resort, located in Louisiana. Through this partnership, the United Kingdom-based sportsbook will reinforce its presence in the United States and the state of Louisiana in particular.</p>
<p>Betfred Sports Opens the Draft Room</p>
<p>Betfred Group’s chief operating officer, Mark Stebbings, spoke about the partnership. He revealed that Louisiana is an attractive destination that presents great opportunities for Betfred Sports’ ongoing expansion in the United States.</p>
<p>The British sports gambling operator was already approved for offering sports betting options to players in Iowa, Colorado, and Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>“We look forward to utilizing our 50 years of bookmaking experience with our fantastic partner, Paragon Casino Resort, to bring the best sports betting experience to bettors in the state,” Stebbings stated.</p>
<p>As a product of the partnership, Betfred Sports has launched the Draft Room – a unique sportsbook that will allow Paragon Casino Resort visitors to get a new Las Vegas-inspired experience. The Draft Room is already open and available to sports-loving visitors who wish to place a bet. It will have traditional theater-styled seating, a video wall, kiosks, and betting counters.</p>
<p>Paragon and Its Ownership Welcome Betfred to the State</p>
<p>Paragon Casino Resort’s general manager, Marshall Sampson Sr, also spoke on the matter. According to Sampson, the partnership with Betfred Sports “marks a new chapter” for both him and the resort as a whole. Paragon Casino Resort has always been a “source of pride” for Marksville and the people of Louisiana and Sampson is sure that the partnership with the British operator will make it an even more attractive destination.</p>
<p>“With this new partnership, I hope visitors from across the region will have the chance to experience it for themselves. Together, we are offering a first-class sports betting platform and venue that will make Paragon Casino Resort the place to bet and watch games in Louisiana,” Sampson concluded.</p>
<p>Marshall Pierite, the chairman of the Tunica-Biloxi Tribe of Louisiana, Paragon Casino Resort’s ownership tribe, also had a word. As a native to the state and chairman of the tribe, Pierite is more than glad to be able to “help usher in sports betting” to Louisiana. He believes that the Betfred Sports partnership will build on the continued success of Paragon and will support the mission of having a “first-class gaming destination and vacation experience” for everyone coming to Central Louisiana.</p>
<p>Paragon Casino Resort already has some substantial gambling offerings. It has a 64,000-square-foot gaming floor, filled to the brim with over 1,000 slot machines and 500 guestrooms.</p>
