<p>As Ireland prepares to launch its first gambling regulatory body, the government is frantically searching for someone to lead it. The position of the chief executive officer is open and Ireland is willing to accept applications from a wide range of applicants.</p>
<p>Ireland Seeks CEO for Its Future Regulator</p>
<p>Ireland has been looking to establish its own gambling authority since December 2020 when Dáil Éireann, the country’s House of Representatives, approved the Interim Gaming and Lotteries Act. The government approved the act for priority drafting and publication.</p>
<p>Minister James Browne reiterated that applications for the CEO position have been open since February 25. He added that the Public Appointments Service is managing the recruitment together with an Executive Search Agency. The application process will conclude on March 21 and Browne urged all eligible candidates to apply.</p>
<p>The search has been launched outside of the state. Potential applicants can find the eligibility requirements and citizenship criteria in the candidate booklet. Browne said that the perfect CEO candidate would be someone who can follow the regulator’s vision of governing the Irish wagering sector and regulating gambling ads, iGaming sites, and betting applications.</p>
<p>The Regulator Should Begin Work Before the End of 2023</p>
<p>Ireland is bullish on launching its own regulated market, seeing the success of other regulated jurisdictions across the world. Alongside the authority’s launch, Ireland envisions rolling out certain laws against harmful betting practices. The country plans to ban free bet offerings and the VIP treatment of long-time bettors.</p>
<p>Certain groups in Ireland have suggested that action needs to be taken against the overabundance of gambling ads. The Irish Labor Party, the Gaelic Athletic Association, and the Gaelic Players Association have all asked for sports betting advertisements to be banned from airing on TV.</p>
<p>The European Gaming and Betting Association has warned Ireland that it should be careful with the strictness of its regulations. It pointed out that some actions, such as the ban of free bets, might be a slippery slope to people turning to the black market.</p>
<p>Ireland hopes that its regulator will be able to start operating directly after its creation. To that end, the government made a Program Board that works on the authority’s operational procedures parallel to the legislation. Ireland’s regulator is expected to begin its work in 2023. However, certain officials believe that the process should be sped up because of the importance of dealing with the country’s alarming gambling harm rates.</p>
