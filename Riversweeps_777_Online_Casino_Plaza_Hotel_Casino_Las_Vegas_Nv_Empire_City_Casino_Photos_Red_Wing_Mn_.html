<p>The leading online casino and sportsbook operator that is a part of Mansion Group, M88, announced a new partnership with Livespins, a company famous for charging the iGaming vertical by delivering innovative and engaging games</p>
<p>By becoming a partner with Livespins, the leading operator integrates the company’s live-streaming product into its online casino lobby. This delivers an entirely new level of experience for M88 online customers that can engage with Livespins’ streamers within different games that are available via the company’s platform from leading developers including Yggdrasil, iSoftBet and Relax Gaming, to name a few.</p>
<p>M88 online customers can tap right into the action and place bets. According to the company, the live streaming product “creates a group bet and a shared experience with each player able to set their bet size and number of spins.” As a result, all of the players have the same chance to win or lose, which creates a new type of engaging and fun experience.</p>
<p>“Livespins is taking the online casino sector by storm and as an operator that likes to be at the cutting edge and exceed player expectations, it was a partnership that we absolutely wanted to sign as a matter of priority.“ Joy Lao, operational division head at M88</p>
<p>Joy Lao, M88’s operational division head, explained that Livespins delivers unique experiences that exceed the expectations of online players. She added that this was only one of the reasons why M88 was interested in joining forces with the company.</p>
<p>Additionally, Lao acknowledged that thanks to Livespins, its customers can now engage in online entertainment unlike anything else offered before. Finally, she pointed out: “This means tremendous added value but through a product that is responsible and ensures players are properly protected.”</p>
<p>Online Casino Streaming Delivers Exciting Experiences</p>
<p>Besides the live-streaming product within M88’s online casino lobby, the new partnership creates new engagement opportunities. Per the deal, the company will benefit from Livespins’ Ambassador product. This unique product enables the operator to introduce its own influencers and brand ambassadors who can take the role of streamers. In turn, M88 can leverage the advantage of having its own ambassadors that can engage with its fan base.</p>
<p>“It’s great to welcome M88 to the Livespins family and for its players to be able to enjoy an entirely new way of experiencing online casino for the very first time.“ Michael Pedersen, chief commercial officer at Livespins</p>
<p>Michael Pedersen, Livespins’ chief commercial officer, said that it is exciting to join forces with M88. He explained that thanks to the new deal, the operator’s customers will engage in new experiences. Pedersen added that there is a continuously growing demand for casino and slot streaming. Finally, he acknowledged that thanks to the new deal, M88 can meet this demand and deliver thrilling, fun and social experiences for its customers.</p>
