<p>Affiliate services provider to the global gaming industry Gambling.com Group received authorization to provide its services to online sports betting operators in Maryland just days before the state’s official market launch.</p>
<p>Foster Competition to Benefit Consumers</p>
<p>The Vendor Registration Certification issued to Gambling.com Group by the Maryland Lottery &amp; Gaming Control Commission authorized the player acquisition services provider to offer its services to licensed online sportsbooks starting with the official launch of the online sports wagering market in Maryland on November 23, 2022.</p>
<p>“The expected launch of the legal online sports betting market in Maryland adds to the tremendous amount of positive momentum for the North American online gaming industry in 2022,” said Charles Gillespie, chief executive officer of Gambling.com Group.</p>
<p>Maryland is set to become the fifth North American jurisdiction to launch legal sports betting or casino in 2022, following in the footsteps of New York and Louisiana, which set the tone in January, Ontario, which followed suit in April, and Kansas in September.</p>
<p>Gillespie continued by outlining that what makes Maryland’s approach “the right one” is that the market has low barriers to entry and allows a variety of operators on the market, convinced that such an approach “will foster competition and ultimately benefit consumers as the operators with the best products rise to the top.”</p>
<p>Caroline Smart, vice president at Gambling.com Group outlined the upcoming launch in time for Thanksgiving as a “huge success for sports bettors in the state,” as they will finally be able to place wagers with legal sports betting operators and enjoy the variety of choices and opportunities a robust market as Maryland will present, while Gambling.com Group stands ready to “navigate their new world of options.”</p>
<p>Next Wave of US Online Sports Betting</p>
<p>Besides BetMaryland.com, Gambling.com Group operates Gambling.com, Bookies.com, RotoWire.com and BonusFinder.com, and all its national and international websites will be available for Maryland operators to acquire players.</p>
<p>BetMaryland.com, the website launched by Gambling.com Group in February as a source of trusted, comprehensive, and up-to-date information, conducted a survey in September and revealed that 24% of Maryland adults are likely or somewhat likely to wager once the online sports betting market in the state goes live, while 44% claimed they would be placing bets at least on a weekly basis.</p>
<p>With a population of 6 million, the Old Line State is presenting a market of approximately 2.64 million bettors wagering weekly and Gillespie believes that the company “is well positioned to help operators and customers succeed in this next wave of regulated legal online sports betting in the United States.”</p>
