<p>Chelsea vs Manchester United is the biggest matchup of Round 13 of the 2022-23 Premier League. The two soccer giants are doing okay now, despite a very poor start to the season. Chelsea is currently sitting in the #4 position with 20 points. Manchester United is just behind with only one point fewer.</p>
<p>Winning on Saturday evening would mean a lot for either of them. Not only would the winner stay near the top of the table, but the win would also do wonders for the players‚Äô confidence.</p>

<p>Graham Potter Wants to Stay Undefeated for as Long as Possible</p>
<p>Chelsea hasn‚Äôt suffered a single loss since Graham Potter‚Äôs been appointed the head coach. The former Brighton boss has a 5-2-0 record with his new team in all competitions. It‚Äôs a very impressive record, especially considering that Potter‚Äôs boys played against some really tough opponents this month.</p>
<p>For instance, they played two UCL games against AC Milan, winning both of them. They also beat Crystal Palace and Aston Villa on the road in the Prem, as well as Wolves at home.</p>
<p>So far, the reign of Potter has been marked by meticulous defending, with five players in the back line ‚Äì three center-backs and two wing-backs. Unfortunately for the Blues, their starting right-back Reece James suffered a knee injury last week, for which he will have to abstain from soccer for at least a few more weeks.</p>
<p>We think Potter might put Caesar Azpilicueta in Reece‚Äôs role, which would make Chelsea even stronger in the defense (but less dangerous in the attack).</p>
<p>There‚Äôs Trouble in the Red Devils Paradise</p>
<p>After suffering two embarrassing losses at the start of the 2022-23 EPL season, Erik ten Haag has managed to put his new team in order. The Red Devils are now looking good on the pitch, with some really impressive results in the last couple of weeks. For instance, in their most recent game, they defeated Tottenham 2-0.</p>
<p>They‚Äôre doing well on the pitch, but the situation in the Red Devils‚Äô locker room is far from ideal. Ten Haag has been their coach for only two months, so he probably still isn‚Äôt the favorite figure of Man United‚Äôs players.</p>

<p>To make things even worse, ten Haag doesn‚Äôt seem capable of handling the Cristiano Ronaldo situation. The Portuguese superstar is dissatisfied with his role in the ten Haag era, and he‚Äôs not shy to show his dissatisfaction to the world.</p>
<p>During Wednesday‚Äôs game with Tottenham, Ronaldo was sitting on the bench until the 89th minute. When he realized he wasn‚Äôt going to get on the pitch, CR7 left his teammates and went to the locker room.</p>
<p>His behavior sparked reactions from soccer pundits like Gary Lineker, Rio Ferdinand, Micah Richards, and others, all of whom suggested the 37-year-old should be fined for his actions.</p>
<p>Chelsea vs Manchester United Prediction</p>
<p>Even though we think this is going to be a fantastic game, we don‚Äôt think there will be many goals. Chelsea‚Äôs defense is solid as a rock, and we think they could keep another clean sheet. And if their offense does a good job, they will win all three points on Saturday.</p>
<p>Picks: Chelsea to win; under 2.5 goals</p>
