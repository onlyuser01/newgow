<p>The proposed changes aim to address concerns surrounding the volume and content of iGaming advertisements in the regulated Ontario market</p>
<p>The Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario (AGCO) has announced an extension to the deadline for industry stakeholder consultation regarding proposed changes to internet-gaming advertising standards. The initial deadline of May 8 has been moved to May 15, allowing more time for input from interested parties.</p>
<p>AGCO Proposal Seeks to Ban Athletes and Celebrities from Ontario’s Gambling Ads</p>
<p>One significant change being suggested in the AGCO proposal is the prohibition of athletes and celebrities in advertising and marketing campaigns within the province. The AGCO’s objective is to minimize potential harm to vulnerable populations, particularly youth. To gather feedback and opinions on these proposed changes, industry stakeholders have been encouraged to register on AGCO’s engagement portal.</p>
<p>Eventually, operators and suppliers will be given a three-month grace period to comply with the new standards once they are finalized.</p>
<p>Should the proposed changes be implemented, several notable advertisements will be affected. Advertisements featuring Jamie Foxx for BetMGM, Auston Matthews for Bet99, Jon Lovitz, Russell Peters, and Patrick J. Adams for theScore Bet, as well as Aaron Paul’s ads for Bet365, would no longer be permitted.</p>
<p>Studies have shown that gambling participation tends to increase during adolescence and peaks in young adulthood, which coincides with an increased risk of gambling-related harm. The proposal is part of the effort to address this issue.</p>
<p>AGCO Proposal Sparks Debate Amidst Booming Growth in Ontario’s Online Gambling Industry</p>
<p>The AGCO proposal comes as Ontario’s online gambling industry experienced remarkable growth in its first year, with significant revenue generated from iGaming and mobile sports betting. The province’s strict regulations and focus on responsible gaming were proven successful with licensed operators displacing unregulated options and providing a consumer-friendly environment.</p>
<p>Reactions to AGCO’s proposal have been mixed, leading to the decision to extend the consultation deadline. While the motivation behind the proposal is logical, some have expressed concerns about the scope of the changes as a complete ban on the use of brand ambassadors and influencers is not a reasonable solution.</p>
<p>The primary goal should be ensuring that messages from celebrities, players, and influencers are only received by the intended audience. At the same time, Ontario has faced backlash over the abundance of sports betting advertisements during games, with calls for a complete ban. Concerns about youth exposure and normalization of gambling prompted the Ban Ads For Gambling campaign. The group has reached out to the Canadian Minister of Canadian Heritage and aims to raise awareness through open discussions.</p>
