<p>The leading gambling software supplier Playtech has inked a new deal with Betfred, agreeing to power the British operator with a fresh digital bingo variant. The new content will be themed after horseracing and will emulate the feeling of a real derby.</p>
<p>Giddy Up Bingo Emulates the Excitement of a Derby</p>
<p>The new offering is called Giddy Up Bingo and is inspired by the biggest horseracing events in the world. It is a 50-ball, multi-stake variant of bingo that aims to emulate the excitement of watching a horseracing event.</p>
<p>As a way to make the Giddy Up Bingo even more similar to a horseracing event, entry tickets represent horses, emulating the feeling of picking a horse. In reality, there are four tickets with four different price tags. The more expensive ones offer their players the chance to win better rewards.</p>
<p>To truly immerse players, the Giddy Up Bingo has replaced all balls with animated horses and jockeys, all of which bear a number. When a number is called, the corresponding digital jockey appears on the screen alongside their mount.</p>
<p>The Giddy Up Bingo is an exclusive betting offering, available only to Betfred’s players.</p>
<p>Playtech and Betfred Are Delighted by the Fan Response</p>
<p>Angus Nisbet, the director of digital bingo at Playtech, spoke about the new offering. He is proud of the end result and is relieved to see players react so strongly to the idea. Nisbet noted that this strong response is provoked by the ongoing horseracing season. Despite that, he believes that the Giddy Up Bingo will continue to be a beloved betting product even after the season is over.</p>
<p>“Our development team has done a fantastic job with Giddy Up Bingo, and we’re delighted to have partnered with Betfred to bring it exclusively to their players,” Nisbet concluded.</p>
<p>Betfred’s bingo manager, Joni Keelings, lauded Playtech’s work on the Giddy Up Bingo and is excited to see players enjoying it.</p>
<p>“To be able to work closely with Playtech to deliver something unique for our players adds great value to our partnership and we’re delighted with the results.” Betfred bingo manager Joni Keelings</p>
<p>The release of Giddy Up Bingo comes in the wake of the exciting Cheltenham Festival – one of the biggest horseracing events in Great Britain. With more events coming soon, the new bingo offering will be a great way for players to take their engagement further and enjoy a new form of horseracing-inspired betting content.</p>
<p>This isn’t the first time Playtech has demonstrated its commitment to horseracing. In February, the company signed a new five-year partnership deal with The Jockey Club.</p>
