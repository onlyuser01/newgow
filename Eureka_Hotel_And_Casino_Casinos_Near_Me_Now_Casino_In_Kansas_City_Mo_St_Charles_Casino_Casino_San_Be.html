<p>Louisiana Marks PointsBet‚Äôs 12th US State Entry</p>

Previously, the leading operator launched its online sportsbook in key markets such as Pennsylvania, New York, Michigan and New Jersey.

What‚Äôs more, the launch in Louisiana is the fourth state launch completed under PointsBet‚Äôs deal with Penn National Gaming.
