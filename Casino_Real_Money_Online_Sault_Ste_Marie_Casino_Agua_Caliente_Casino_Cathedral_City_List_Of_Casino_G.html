<p>Hello Everyone</p>
<p>I love gambling and i am a VERY high roller ,playing online casino"s since 2002 i.e 22 years n god forbid i never ever faced any problem in hundreds of online casino"s i played in UNTILL NOW when i joined " 888STARZ CASINO " believing the good ratings given by casino guru . I joined n deposited Rs 15000 n received 100% match making total of 30000 . But this BUNCH OF SCAMMERS RUNNING THIS CASINO got a shock immedietly as i completed the WAGERING REQUIREMENT OF 35× WITHIN 2 HOURS WINNING AROUND Rs 2 Lakhs !!!! But the maximum Cap is equal to bonus amount so out of 2 Lakhs winnings i received 15000 ( bonus ) , no issues with that as i was aware of the max cap . Now i wanted to get my account verified to open up the option of withdrawls in future . They asked me the documentsand i sent the same which they asked . Now began the real story or the real comedy show !!!! . I got a mail from their so called security department which i m copy pasting inside comma"s , plz read it ----</p>

<p>I dont care about a small amount of money of Rs 30000 but its not about money , its about your self-respect n dignity !! I even gave them a option to keep my winnings n enjoy with my money and just return my deposit amount , but you know what was their reply ????? THE SAME COPY PASTED MAIL MENTIONED BY ME ABOVE !!!! OH GOD....SUCH MENTALLY RETARDED PEOPLE R RUNNING A CASINO N ROBBING PEOPLE ....As i follow the casino guru website from the 1st day of their launch , i felt its my responsibility to tell them whats going on and the latest trick invented by a casino to cheat n rob people in the name of verification so that no1 can catch their self aclaimed LEGAL WAY ( for verification ) to CHEAT PEOPLE .I HOPE MY DECISION TO BRING IT ON A PUBLIC PLATFORM WILL SAVE ATLEAST SOME PLAYERS FROM GETTING CHEATED BY THIS "" 888STARZ CASINO ""</p>
