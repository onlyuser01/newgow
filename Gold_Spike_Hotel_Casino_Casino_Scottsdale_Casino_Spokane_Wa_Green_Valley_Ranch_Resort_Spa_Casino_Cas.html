<p>Following the successful launch of its dedicated mobile app in Colorado last week, theScore Bet confirmed that it has entered the Indiana market with a dedicated mobile wagering solution on Friday.</p>
<p>TheScore Bet Arrives Scores Big Time with Indiana App Launch</p>
<p>Score Media and Gaming Inc. subsidiary, theScore Bet, has launched a dedicated sportsbook app solution in Indiana, adding to an already strong presence in the United States betting market.</p>
<p>This is a second big investment by theScore Bet recently and after the company expanded in Colorado a week ago. TheScore is also present in New Jersey.</p>
<p>TheScore Bet will run a number of match and in-play wagering options available for all sports leagues and events covered by local demand. This includes a variety of bet types that makes for a fulsome online betting experience.</p>
<p>Last week, we touched down in Colorado. Today: Indiana!</p>

<p>To negotiate the partnership, theScore used its existing partnership with Penn National Gaming and as to the betting platform itself, theScore relies on Bet.Works to deliver the necessary software solution and live up to consumer expectations. Speaking on the occasion of the launch, theScore CEO, John Levy, had this to say:</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis launch comes just weeks after we introduced theScore Bet to fans in Colorado, a huge testament to the best-in-class technology, multi-state infrastructure, and product development team supporting our ongoing expansion.‚Äù</p>
<p>TheScore Remains Committed to Expanding in the United States</p>
<p>The United States is one of the fastest-growing markets and theScore intends to capitalize on this growth. After breaking ground in New Jersey, the state that spearheaded legal sports betting in the country, theScore has been pushing into other markets around the country.</p>
<p>Levy noted that the platform would seek to gain momentum in the sports betting segment and run a number of marketing initiatives to allow it to expand its footprint and exposure in each state it enters.</p>
<p>While theScore has teamed up with a different land-based operator in Colorado, the platform is betting heavily on its 20-year multi-state partnership with Penn National. Penn National has access to 10 more states in which theScore will most likely consider launching.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the number of states legalizing their sports betting product has been growing exponentially. TheScore even signed a partnership with Twin River Worldwide Holdings in August for the New Jersey market.</p>
<p>As per the partnership, the pair has agreed on the launch of the dedicated theScore Bet casino, breaking a new vertical for the firm.</p>
<p>TheScore has picked a fortuitous moment to break ground in Indiana as the Indiana Gaming Commission reported a total sports betting handle for August amounting to $169 million, a big spike in the results by 139% month-over-month.</p>
<p>Sports betting handle is likely to continue climbing up with the NFL season returning and the Big Ten Conference confirming that it would return to the regular football season on October 24.</p>
