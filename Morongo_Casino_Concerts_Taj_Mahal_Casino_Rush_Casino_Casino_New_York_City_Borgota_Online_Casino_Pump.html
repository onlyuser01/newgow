<p>Pumpkin Patch review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Pumpkin Patch is set in the titular agricultural milieu. The particular patch in question is beset by pesky squirrels and colourful birds which the distractible scarecrow does a poor job of keeping away.</p>
<p>The world of Pumpkin Patch has the look of a children’s TV show which clashes a little with the very adult context of a gambling game, but it is still a fairly cute setting.</p>
<p>Big win in the Pumpkin Patch slot</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The graphics look rather childish but are competently drawn and are given a wide range of animations to draw the eye and keep one interested.</p>
<p>The music is a bouncy banjo track that fits with the rural setting and style but is yet another track that is better muted. The rest of the sound effects are varied and fun.</p>
<p>Overall the design for this slot leaves a lot to be desired but is far from being the worst of its kind.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Although just a typical five by three slot game at first glance, Pumking Patch’s base game has a few small features to spice up the gameplay.</p>
<p>Firstly, the winlines, of which there are twenty-five, can win going both from leftmost reel to the right or from rightmost reel to the left.</p>
<p>There is also the Pumpkin feature whereby any Pumpkin symbol appearing next to a Bird or Squirrel symbol is turned into a Wild which then expands to cover its reel before winnings are calculated.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>There are two different wild symbols, one that is the word ‘Wild’ (which we will call Wild) and one which is a scarecrow (which we will call Scarecrow). The Wild and Scarecrow symbols substitute for all other symbols.</p>
<p>Three or more Scarecrow symbols anywhere on the reels will trigger the Free Spins bonus.</p>
<p>The Free Spins counter starts at 8, and any Corn symbols that appear in a winning combo in the base game or Free Spins are added to the counter. If you get the counter to 30 in the base game, this also triggers the free spin bonus.</p>
<p>Pumpkin turns into Expanding Wild thanks to 2 bonus features</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 98.18%, in keeping with Habanero’s habit of offering very favourable return to players in the hope of capturing some market share from the bigger players.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.40 up to a maximum of $/£/€50.00 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is medium. This is not ideal, but can still be matched with our preferred slot strategies, though we normally prefer something with a bit more variance.</p>
<p>Paytable for high paying symbols</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Pumpkin Patch is a rather twee and irritating slot machine. Some good gameplay ideas are lost behind a rather tiresome and childish veneer.</p>
<p>The return to player, being as high as it is, almost rescues the game but not quite.</p>
<p>We do not recommend this slot.</p>
