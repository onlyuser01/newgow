<p>Florida Lottery Winner Says Ticket Purchased After Fellow Player Cut in Line</p>

<p>A Florida Lottery winner says he might not have experienced his lucky win if it hadn’t been for an unruly customer who cut the line in front of him.</p>

<p>Stephen Espinoza, 43, recently stopped in the Publix grocery store along NE 5th Avenue in Delray Beach. He told lottery officials that while he was waiting in line to purchase a ticket at the store’s self-service lottery machine, another patron cut in line.</p>
<p>Instead of telling the person who butt in line that he was waiting to use the machine, Espinoza decided to move to the customer service counter. He purchased a $50 “500x The Cash” scratch-off, and the purchase paid off.</p>
<p>Espinoza hit the game’s second-best prize of $1 million. Each print run of the lottery game includes 160 $1 million prizes. The odds of winning the seven-digit sum are one in 267,739 — or 0.00000373%.</p>
<p>Patience Pays</p>
<p>Espinoza’s patience paid off to the tune of $1 million. He opted for the one-time lump-sum payout, which was $820,000.</p>
<p>Espinoza will need to pay federal tax on the win. The federal income tax rate for earners who make more than $539,901 or more in a single year is 37% — which is currently the highest tax bracket.</p>
<p>The federal tax reduces Espinoza’s haul by $303,400 for a net payout of $516,600. More than half of a million dollars for a gamble that almost didn’t happen.</p>
<p>It was the end of a long day, and I was tired,” Espinoza told the Florida Lottery. “I stopped at Publix and was about to buy a ticket at the machine when a man cut right in front of me.”</p>
<p>“Instead of saying something, I decided I’d just buy a ticket at the counter instead. I can’t believe I won a million dollars,” Espinoza said.</p>
<p>Florida does not consider lottery winnings as taxable income, and therefore does not further tax Espinoza’s lucky day. While Espinoza was fortunate to not have won the $1 million prize in one of the 36 states that do tax lottery winnings, Florida laws do not allow lottery winners to remain anonymous.</p>
<p>Espinoza seemed fine to make his identity known. He says he plans to use some of the winnings to purchase a home for his family. The Publix that sold the $1 million ticket receives a $2,000 bonus commission from the Florida Lottery.</p>
<p>Extravagant Scratch-Offs</p>
<p>The Florida Lottery offers scratch-off tickets ranging in sale prices from $1 to $50. The state’s “500x The Cash” is its only $50 scratch-off product.</p>
<p>The Texas Lottery last year introduced the nation’s costliest scratch-off. Its “$20 Million Supreme” game costs $100 per scratch-off, and there’s no “break-even” prize. The smallest prize is a $150 win, and the richest prize is $20 million.</p>
<p>Each print of the “$20 Million Supreme” Texas Lottery game comes with four $20 million winners. The first was scratched off in September. The odds of winning one of the $20 million prizes are one in 2.55 million.</p>
<p>The odds of winning one of the 1.36 million $150 wins are one in 7.5.</p>
