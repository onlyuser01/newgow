<p>Yes, it could be that this is one of the newer options for betting, because I noticed that even here it is not included for every match, but only for top leagues. I also like to use the double chance.</p>
<p>As far as favorite sport is concerned, volleyball really ? I wouldn't have guessed that. I don't watch this sport very much but it could be as you say. Football or hockey have more unpredictable results every year and I have the feeling that nothing is "certain" even when playing first with the last. I believe that if I bet on such a match, suddenly a string of 10 wins in a row would be broken.</p>
<p>Regarding the fact that when a bookmaker offers you almost the same amount of money to pay out immediately after creating a ticket, I agree with that in general, even though it may not be a rule. I once managed to win something around 250 euros out of 5 euros and at the beginning I was only offered about 2 after the betting ticket was placed. Of course I take it as a coincidence and occasional relaxation. It's not something I would do let's say "professionally".</p>
<p>Concerning the sites, thank you for the tip, but I think I'll stick to the one I have and I'm satisfied with it.</p>
<p>Anyway thanks for the insight and your opinion on sports betting. I came across this thread about sports betting on the forum: https://casino.guru/forum/sports-and-betting , so if you ever have time, you can check it out and interact with other players. Maybe you can exchange interesting information that will be useful to you. Good luck in this industry, we probably both need it. üòÅüòÅ</p>
