<p>Moving forward, St8.io will be able to supply local operators in the regulated Eastern European market with various casino and gaming content that will be injected directly into the libraries of partner operators through the powerful and lightweight aggregation platform.</p>
<p>St8.io Becomes Latest Aggregation Platform to Be Licensed in Romania</p>
<p>The company has a Class II license that allows it to collaborate with other operators that have been licensed locally by ONJN and have the necessary license to offer online gambling products lawfully. St8.io CEO Vladimir Negine has welcomed the opportunity as well and added that the company was very happy to put its mark on the Romanian iGaming market, something that the company had planned for.</p>
<p>“We see significant growth potential but at the same time operators are telling us they need a content pipeline to deliver the truly exceptional experience players are demanding,” Negine added. He also said that the aggregator is capable of bringing operators locally the type of experience that will help promote their offer and give them a competitive edge.</p>
<p>Negine further praised the functionalities of the aggregation solution and said that his company’s product offered features that were not normally associated with aggregation platforms. The company also uses an API to seamlessly integrate its content and deliver cutting-edge solutions for the market.</p>
<p>St8 Brings a Host of Solutions and Features to Help Partner Operators</p>
<p>St8.io brings a host of options along with it, including a number of marketing and bonus tools that will help partner operators not only access the aggregator’s library of games but also ensure that they have a quick and easy way to engage with its library.</p>
<p>Slotmill, Peter &amp; Sons and BGaming are among some of the exciting suppliers that have already agreed to collaborate with St8.io which is determined to continue and scale up its offer further.</p>
<p>St8.io similarly offers a lot of control over what products do well and how, featuring a powerful back office with powerful real-time data and instant support.</p>
