    <h1>Alabama Casino St Louis Casinos Sweepstakes Casino Real Money Casinos In Detroit Michigan Schenectad</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I registered in Wazamba Casino, I saw that no verification was needed, then I deposited 800 euros. I played about 2 hours of blackjack(without any bonuses) and won about 700 euros. The other day I went to the site and saw that they were asking for a selfie, photo ID and proof of address. I attached my driver's license and proof of address and waited for approval. The next day they told me that they wanted a photo of my ID card and a new photo for the address because this one had been cut off. I have attached a photo of my ID and proof of address from the bank. The other day, the system showed that I did not attach a photo to the ID card, I made several more attempts, but the system showed that it was accepted successfully, but then it did not attach. I chatted with them and we agreed to email them the documents, I emailed them the documents and the next day I got the following reply.</p>
