<p>BGaming, the fast-growing iGaming content provider that converts gambling into gaming, announced Tuesday that it now supports Crypto SNACK. The collaboration between the duo sees BGaming support the world's fastest-growing iGaming token as a currency.</p>
<p>As a result of the collaboration, Crypto SNACK holders will be able to wager the token on all of BGaming's online casino games. Besides expanding the possibilities for SNACK holders, the new collaboration reaffirms the online content provider's goal of offering the most flexible payment methods.</p>
<p>By now, BGaming supports cryptocurrencies, virtual currencies as well as fiat currencies. Continuously growing, the company's portfolio now features more than 80 products that include video poker, video slots, lottery and other games. What's more, the company's content is available to millions of players via BGaming's partners.</p>
<p>In a statement released on June 7, 2022, Crypto SNACK's CEO, Stuart Morrison, acknowledged that the collaboration with BGaming marks a milestone for the Crypto SNACK token. Moreover, he said: "It strengthens our position as the world's fastest-growing iGaming token."</p>
<p>According to Morrison, the integration with BGaming marks an important goal for Crypto SNACK. In conclusion, he predicted further success and outlined that the partnership will undoubtedly bring excitement to the SNACK community.</p>
<p>Alexandr Shavel, BGaming's Head of Business Development Department, added: "We are sure that crypto is making the current iGaming space more comfortable and are proud to be the pioneer in supporting SNACK cryptocurrency." He explained the deal with SNACK marks another important step for BGaming on its way to offering its players the best payment options for the iGaming market.</p>
<p>Late last week, BGaming announced a new content deal with the leading European operator, Platincasino. The new partnership resulted in Platincasino integrating BGaming's portfolio of highly popular titles and mechanics.</p>
<p>The company even hinted that its collaboration with Platincasino may reach a new level by developing a new exclusive game. That content deal helped BGaming expand its reach in Europe. In fact, the partnership with Platincasino follows BGaming's plan for growth in key European markets.</p>
<p>On the other hand, adding Crypto SNACK currency to its gaming portfolio will help BGaming attract new players. Offering a variety of payment methods is significantly important, especially for iGaming operators. But adding the iGaming token as currency also reaffirms BGaming's position as a pioneer in crypto gambling.</p>
<p>Headquartered in Malta, the company's portfolio offers more than 80 game titles that are available in HD graphics. By now, hundreds of operators have selected BGaming's innovative and engaging products.</p>
