    <h1>Hard Rock Casino Biloxi Casino Hotel In Niagara Falls Mohegan Sun Casino Pa Casino Morango Casino Ne</h1>

<p>Sumsub and Casino Guru have inked a partnership for the release of iGaming Player Verification, an online course for gambling platfo</p>
<p>The all-in-one verification platform has reunited with the independent online casino database in a desire to educate operators in the industry on a number of important topics. The list includes anti-money laundering/Know Your Customer policies, gambling compliance, and user onboarding matters.</p>
<p>The iGaming Player Verification and AML Course Is Free</p>
<p>The new online course developed by Casino Guru and Sumsub is free of charge and it is aimed at helping online platforms keep up with the ongoing changes in legislation.</p>
<p>Created by the Casino Guru Academy, the course is Casino Guru’s initiative targeting the education of the online casino industry by promoting fairness, educating, and identifying fresh solutions to keep players protected against gambling harms.</p>
<p>The platform has previously released three other courses focused on safer gambling practices, enhanced customer support, and casino bonuses.</p>
<p>The new course resulted from a desire to help casinos limit their risk of being subject to penalties because of failing to comply with the current regulations in their jurisdictions.</p>
<p>These penalties are normally accompanied by a series of additional license suspension or license revocation decisions, eventually wreaking damage to the reputation and operational integrity of the respective platforms.</p>
<p>Sumsub Offered Insights on Creating AML-Compliant User Verification Policies</p>
<p>The company that offers customizable Know Your Customer, Know Your Business, Know Your Transactions, and Anti-Money Laundering solutions and helps customers usher in more global customers worldwide has brought its important contribution to the new course.</p>
<p>Namely, Sumsub’s best compliance experts and gambling pros have added their own content to the online course. This includes a series of important insights on the way operators should generate highly effective user verification procedures that are fully compliant with AML requirements.</p>
<p>According to Sumsub, this should be done while maintaining the conversion rates at an all-time high. Sumsub’s experts also inserted information on how to tackle the behaviors of problematic gamblers in the same course while providing a complete identity verification checklist.</p>
<p>The latter is meant to assist online casino businesses with the optimization of their Know Your Customer flows and the creation of ideal customer experiences.</p>
<p>Sumsub’s chief executive officer and co-founder Andrew Sever believes all the recommendations provided by their experts should help operators prevent “painful fines and reputational damage”.</p>
<p>Casino Guru’s sustainable and safer gambling lead Šimon Vincze expressed his hope that the new course will bring “great value to anyone looking to expand their knowledge”. Last December, Casino Guru and safer gambling charity in the UK Gordon Moody partnered for the delivery of an interactive safer gambling course.</p>
<p>In October, Sumsub announced it would publish its first Know Your Customer identity verification guide for the US and Canada.</p>
