    <h1>Casino Manchester Nh Westgate Las Vegas Resort And Casino Casinos Resorts Near Me Horseshoe Casino L</h1>

<p>As the year draws to a close, we already have our eyes set on what is going to be some of the biggest events in 2024. One such industry gathering is the highly-anticipated iGaming Club 2024 hosted by AffPapa, which will bring together thousands of affiliate experts. One of those is Betsson Group Affiliates, which was confirmed as Standard Sponsor for the event just last week.</p>
<p>Betsson Group Affiliates represents several renowned brands under the eponymous group’s umbrella and brings a range of experiences and gaming products to be explored by potential partners. The decision to appoint the company as a Standard Sponsor reflects on the positive partnership and collaboration that AffPapa and Betsson have maintained over the past years.</p>
<p>The upcoming event seeks to attract a large host of affiliates, operators and B2B companies, but it will also feature a VIP dinner which will offer 250 guests the opportunity to network in a more intimate and casual atmosphere. The event is already locked in for February 6 and both AffPapa and Betsson are very happy with the opportunity to be a part of this.</p>
<p>Betsson Group Affiliates Senior Affiliate Operations and Events Manager Shakyra Jonsson has welcomed the opportunity to step into this important role and offer support for iGaming Club London 2024, one of the most significant and meaningful events on the calendar. Jonsson added:</p>
<p>"Events of this nature serve as valuable platforms for fostering meaningful connections, presenting innovative products and services, and remaining abreast of the latest trends within the dynamic iGaming sector. Our goal is to further grow relationships with both current and prospective affiliate partners, thereby contributing to the continued success of our network."</p>
<p>AffPapa Head of Commercials Yeva Avagyan was similarly excited to welcome a prominent partner for the upcoming event and said that Betsson Group Affiliates’ sponsorship meant a lot.</p>
<p>"The BGA team has been a dedicated partner of AffPapa for several years, and their continued support reflects the strength of our collaboration. Looking forward to a successful event in London," Avagyan wrapped up.</p>
<p>Following the success of the 2023 event, AffPapa is committed to revisiting the venue and bringing together some exceptional insiders from the world of iGaming and gambling affiliates.</p>
