<p>Daryl West, an outsider to the gaming industry, has joined William Hill as the company’s new head of sponsorship, social and PR. West’s experience spans a number of companies where he worked as head of social media for the most part, and he has cultivated the relevant knowledge to deploy tailored business solutions across the board, including as part of William Hill’s operations today.</p>
<p>The Right Fit for William Hill</p>
<p>He joins from Vanarama, his most recent company, where he served for 3.7 years and where he worked in the same position. During his time with the company, West was able to spearhead several campaigns, including Manarama and #GetUsinTheGame petition.</p>
<p>He worked with Vanarama soccer ambassadors Vinnie Jones and Jeff Brazier and was responsible for implementing a social media workflow and more. West’s stint had a measurable and tangible effect on the company’s reach through his PR and social media efforts.</p>
<p>Before that, he worked for Sage as global social media lead where he was responsible for communications for the most part. He served for four years as head of social media insight at telecoms company O2. Commenting on his appointment at William Hill, West said:</p>
<p>Delighted to join William Hill as Head of Sponsorship, Social and PR. Lots of exciting things happening across the business and I’m very excited to be part of such a brilliant team. William Hill head of sponsorship, social and PR Daryl West</p>
<p>West will play an equally important part as part of William Hill’s team. While details about his immediate focus in the company are still not available, West is likely to work on one of the brand’s many campaigns as he seeks to steer the sports betting and gaming giant’s future success.</p>
