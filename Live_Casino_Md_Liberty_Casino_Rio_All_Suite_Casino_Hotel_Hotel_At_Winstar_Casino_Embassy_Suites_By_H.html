<p>Paysafe, the owner of digital payment services Skrill, Neteller, and Paysafecard, announced its new VIP iGaming player program on May 31. The program will allow owners of Skrill USA digital wallets an increase to their instant deposit limits by as much as several hundred times the standard amount, depending on individual KYC verification.</p>
<p>A Program Focused on the High-Rollers</p>
<p>The new VIP program, which was first tested with the PlayUp USA sportsbook, comes after a major update, which allowed players to link their bank account to their Skrill USA account and make automated instant deposits 24/7, even during weekends. Clients can also deposit via Credit/Debit card or use either Paysafecard or Paysafecash, both available at most major U.S. retailers.</p>
<p>VIP players can also make withdrawals from PlayUp USA to their Skrill USA account in real-time, and the funds can be transferred directly to their linked bank accounts. Skrill users can even invest their winnings directly into cryptocurrency through the platform’s new crypto exchange feature.</p>
<p>The Skrill mobile application recently received a new streamlined interface that centralizes the most vital information a client needs to deposit, facilitating quicker and uninterrupted payments. Returning customers can skip straight to depositing thanks to the “remember me” functionality on the login page, streamlining the transaction process even further.</p>
<p>According to a press release by Paysafe regarding the new VIP program, they aimed to cater to the wagering preferences of high-stakes American e-gamblers (those with 7+ wagers a week). Skrill USA is currently rolling out the program across its U.S. customers. Zak Cutler, CEO of North America iGaming at Paysafe, said that U.S. VIP players exclusively prefer digital wallets over alternative payment methods. He added that this new initiative would help increase Skrill USA’s popularity among the VIP customer segment of American operators.</p>
<p>“We take great pride in taking care of our VIPs and the ability to onboard them quickly once they have cleared our due diligence protocols,” commented Kevin Smith, Chief Marketing Officer at PlayUp USA. He commented that the platform allows frictionless deposits in full compliance with regulations.</p>
<p>Skrill remains one of the most popular e-wallet services both in the USA and around the world. Major casino brands which allow their clients to use Skrill include BetMGM, Caesars Casino, DraftKings, PokerStars, and BetRivers.</p>
