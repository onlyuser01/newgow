<p>Saturday, January 8, will be an important date in the gaming industry. New York is becoming the first state in 2022 to introduce online sports gambling. It was a long time coming, and almost everyone is thrilled – except maybe New Jersey. In conjunction with the launch, a flurry of new deals is going to be seen. Two have already been announced.</p>
<p>Better Collective Lands in New York</p>
<p>It was announced this week that New York is ready to launch mobile sports betting this weekend. This gives the state a month of action before the biggest sports gambling event in the US, the Super Bowl.</p>
<p>Caesars Sportsbook, DraftKings, FanDuel, and Rush Street Interactive (RSI) have already been approved to launch. Five other operators are waiting in the wings and need to receive final approval from regulators.</p>
<p>Helping the mobile operators hit the ground running, they will be able to count on assistance from Better Collective. The company has signed partnership agreements with three of the approved operators and is currently in conversation with the fourth. It said in a press release that it will be available to assist New York sports fans with betting lines and sports information on its proprietary platforms, including Action Network and Vegasinsider.</p>
<p>The company added that this will be an excellent opportunity for Better Collective and its platforms. New York has the potential to be the most popular sports betting destination in the US. Even though Better Collective has more than 500,000 visitors per month from the state already, it is not possible for them to use the betting data for wagers.</p>
<p>Better Collective CEO Marc Pedersen added, “Unlocking the fourth most populous state in the United States to mobile sports betting is a huge moment for Better Collective and our growing portfolio of US assets. We are strongly positioned and excited to continue delivering sports betting content to the many thousand sports enthusiasts from New York that visit our sites daily.”</p>
<p>FanDuel Partners with the Buffalo Bills</p>
<p>FanDuel Group and the NFL’s Buffalo Bills have announced a multi-year partnership. The operator was designated as the official mobile betting partner for the team. It will have access to media assets, including radio spots and TV spots that engage Bills fans, as well as signage and activations at Highmark Stadium.</p>
<p>FanDuel will be the presenting sponsor for the Buffalo Bills-themed Podcast Bills by the Numbers. Chris Brown and Steve Tasker host the podcast, which discusses team updates and key fantasy matchups.</p>
<p>It isn’t clear if FanDuel will have everything ready in time for this Sunday’s Bills game against the Jets, but it likely will. The NFL regular season is about to wrap up, and the operator will want to make the most of its investment.</p>
<p>FanDuel Group Chief Marketing Officer Mike Raffensperger said in an announcement, “As we prepare to bring America’s #1 sportsbook to New York state, we will collaborate with the Bills to bring unique content and experiences to one of the most loyal fanbases in sports.”</p>
