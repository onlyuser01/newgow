    <h1>Casino Beach Pensacola Playstar Casino Modo Casino Cadillac Jacks Casino Deadwood Milkyway Online Ca</h1>

<p>The screenshot has a typed in memo by an agent that says it was canceled by the player. There is nothing on my account activity that says I canceled the withdraw. It’s does however say it was requested and denied. no where does it state the funds were placed back in my account and played out like you say. I had an agent tell me what games it was I supposedly played, I asked to see the history and they told me to message support@limitlesscasino.com for the account history and then ended the chat immediately. I don’t understand why it’s so difficult to get see the history if I played it out, it should be documented as every other action is. You should be able to show me where from 9:27am when I made the request to withdraw $189.55, then (the supposeed cancellation) the denial of withdraw at 9:32. 10am when I requested a different coupon FEELESS that was approved, meaning that I would have had to be below $1 balance to receive. So I’d like to see where I received and played out the $190 you say was put back in my account in a 28 minute window. That’s a lot of things to take place in LESS than 30 mins….just saying.</p>
<p>I need to see the timeline you suggest happened between 9;33am to 9:59.</p>
<p>thats the window of time available for what you say happened, if it happened.</p>
<p>why would it say denied by you…on your side as well FIRST? Then says player canceled the COUPON, Not the dang withdraw. The coupon that was requested between the withdraw request and the withdraw denial I requested a coupon and then I canceled the COUPON I REQUESTED.</p>
