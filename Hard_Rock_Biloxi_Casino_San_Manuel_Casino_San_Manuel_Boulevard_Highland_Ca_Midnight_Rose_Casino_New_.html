<p>Who invented gambling? Who invented casinos? How old is gambling? How did gambling start? If you've ever wondered about the answers to any of these questions, you've come to the right place. This article will give you a detailed overview of the history of gambling, and it will be the comprehensive gambling introduction you are looking for.</p>
<p>Covering all the important eras, including gambling in B.C., ancient gambling games, gambling in the US, as well as the history of online gambling, this piece is your ultimate guide to gambling through the ages.</p>
<p>Gambling in B.C.</p>
<p>Pinpointing a single moment where the history of gambling began is an impossible task. However, given the inherent nature of humans – modern or prehistoric – to take risks and look for rewards, historians assume that gambling is as old as humanity itself.</p>
<p>In an era where very few opportunities for entertainment existed, it comes as no surprise that our ancestors came up with very clever ways to pass the long nights and cold winters. Gambling is a type of activity in which a clear distinction between the winner and the loser can be made, making it a perfect activity for prehistoric times, during which fights for dominance, power and victory were prominent.</p>
<p>Gambling quickly became the go-to activity to do while indulging in alcohol and piles of food, and emperors were especially notorious for spending their fortunes on everyone's new favorite pastime. And once the first coins started to be minted in Lydia (modern Turkey), gambling got a lot more exciting.</p>
<p>The anticipation just before the outcome was revealed, the release of dopamine making them want to play again and again... when you think about it, the prehistoric men were not that different from us after all. Gambling plays a big part in understanding ancient societies, as no matter which point in the history of humanity you point to, you're bound to find some evidence of gambling connected with it.</p>
<p>GAMBLING IN B.C. The earliest evidence of dice is found inside an Egyptian tomb. Evidence also suggests that a six-sided dice was used around this time in Mesopotamia. Gambling houses become a popular entertainment activity for people, and the emperors are often blowing public resources on gambling and drinking. Source The first coins start to be minted in Lydia, located in modern-day Turkey. This is the beginning of using coins for gambling. Source</p>
<p>Evolution of Gambling in the Early Centuries</p>
<p>Given that the first Olympics (that we know of) were held in year 776, making them almost 1,300 years old, it isn't very surprising to know that gambling was already widespread around that time – and not only in Ancient Greece. By the 8th century, Roman gladiators were already fighting for their lives for centuries, and betting on the winner has become as common as putting on one's clothes in the morning.</p>
<p>But betting on winners and playing dice was soon supplemented by another exciting invention: cards. The people didn't know it then, but this was a significant moment in the history of gambling. Today, cards are an essential part of the majority of popular casino games, and it's hard to imagine gambling without them.</p>
<p>It was during this time that the first versions of some of the most common casino games like baccarat, blackjack and craps were created. However, it would still be a long time before their ultimate versions (like we know them today) would be born.</p>
<p>Games of chance would also become very popular with sailors in desperate need of passing the long days on the sea, and due to the now widespread and mainstream use of gambling, first laws and regulations around gambling start to appear – many of them making gambling completely illegal.</p>
<p>GAMBLING IN THE EARLY CENTURIES A horse racing-themed gambling machine is used for gambling in Constantinople. People are betting on which ball makes its way from the top of the machine to the bottom the fastest. The machine features many hidden paths inside it, making guessing solely dependable on chance. Source The first evidence of cards is found in Ancient China. In one of his works, a Chinese writer said Princess Tong Cheng of the Tang dynasty played the "leaf game." A dice game called Hazard is mentioned in Canterbury Tales, a collection of stories written by the English poet Geoffrey Chaucer. The game's rather complicated rules were simplified in the 19th century, creating what we now know as the game of craps Source The first mentions of baccarat are recorded. The origin of the game is up to many debates, but the majority of sources agree that the game was invented in Italy, with "baccara" meaning "zero" in Italian. Trente-un (31), is mentioned by a priest. The game was later also referenced by Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra in 1570. Several earlier versions of blackjack, such as French Quinze (15) and Italian Sette e Mezzo (7 1⁄2), were also played before the blackjack as we know developed from Vingt-et-un (21), which gained big popularity in the 18th century. The first known predecessor of blackjack , Spanish(31), is mentioned by a priest. The game was later also referenced by Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra in 1570. Several earlier versions of blackjack, such as(15) and Italian(7 1⁄2), were also played before the blackjack as we know developed from(21), which gained big popularity in the 18th century. Liber de Ludo Aleae ("Book on Games of Chance") is written. The book is often cited as one of the pillars of probability theory. Besides that, it's considered to be one of the earliest gambling manuals of its kind. The Unlawful Games Act 1541 makes gambling in England essentially illegal. King Henry VIII was afraid that sports and games such as bowls, tennis, dice, and cards were diverting the attention of the male population from their military-related duties, and the Act was a result of those fears. Several parts of this act were in force until the 1845 Gaming Act, while the 1960 Betting and Gaming Act revised the rest of them.</p>
<p>Introduction of Casinos and New Casino Games</p>
<p>Due to the rapid growth of the gambling industry in the early centuries, it was only a matter of time until casino establishments started to open their doors to the public. However, the transition from establishments that featured a gambling area to actual casinos was not an instant one – it took several decades.</p>
<p>At the same time, new casino games were being created on a regular basis, and two of them started to really take off. In America, the early version of poker dominated the country, while multiple different versions of a game we now call European roulette were introduced in England and then France.</p>
<p>In the US, lottery started to become an increasingly important source of public funds, and this form of gambling is known to have funded many prominent organizations and universities, including Harvard University.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION OF CASINOS AND NEW CASINO GAMES The oldest casino in the world, Casino di Venezia, opens in Venice, Italy. At the time, the building itself was a theatre that featured a gambling area, Il Ridotto. Over the next decades, the premises served many purposes apart from gambling, including hosting the Italian royalty. In 1946, the building was officially bought by Venice city, and in 1959, the place finally opened its doors as an official casino. Source Pascal manages to construct a perpetual motion machine, which has become the basis of today's roulette wheel The early version of poker is believed to have been created around this time. We know that by 1829, poker spread through Mississippi, and the game became widespread and popular across the whole country. The game was played with 20 cards only. Other versions of poker started to appear later, with Texas Hold‘em and other community card poker games appearing around 1925. The first evidence of people playing Roly Poly, an early version of roulette involving a spinning wheel and a ball, is recorded in England around this time. The game was banned 20 years later. Another predecessor of roulette, the Even-Odd, was introduced shortly after to circumvent the new gambling prohibition laws, but 1945 put a stop to the game as well. Source A curious law passes in New Hampshire (England). The law prohibits gambling in case such a decision can prevent the impoverishment of the gambler's family. The First Baptist Church of Providence in Rhode Island is made possible due to money obtained from the lottery granted by Rhode Island. At the present time, the church is home to the oldest Baptist congregation in the USA. The lottery is believed to be the main reason for many historical and influential institutions in America today, including Columbia University, Harvard, Yale, and many others. Harvard is also said to have bought 2,000 tickets in the lottery itself, managing to win $10,000 in return. Roulette (without the 0) starts to appear at gambling establishments all over France.</p>
<p>Rise of Gambling in the US</p>
<p>The history of gambling in the US stretches all the way back to the era of colonialism, during which many of the first settlers liked to enjoy various games of chance whenever possible.</p>
<p>Many casino games have already found their way to America by this time, and despite several religious groups fighting hard to make gambling disappear from the face of the earth, more and more gambling establishments were being set up all over the country at a rapid pace.</p>
<p>Despite going through tough times in the 19th century, lottery managed to become a source of freedom (literally) for a lucky black American during the period of slavery, and the American version of roulette with an additional "00" number took off in America.</p>
<p>RISE OF GAMBLING IN THE US The city treasurer of Charleston draws nr. 1884 as the winning number of the $1,500 Grand Prize, which won a black American slave named Denmark Vesey his freedom from slavery. However, Vesey and 34 others were executed in 1822 for attempting to conduct a slave uprising. Source Tough time for lotteries in America. What began as a petition of evangelical reformers in the 1830s, ended up being a total ban on lotteries by 1890 (except for Delaware and Louisiana). Around this time, roulette finds its way into America. However, to have a bigger house edge than the European roulette, the American roulette features an additional double 00 instead of 37 numbers. This increases the house edge to 5.26%. Perhaps that's why its popularity in America never reached the level of European roulette. New Orleans decides to license and tax several casinos in order to use the proceeds for charitable purposes.</p>
<p>Move to Gambling as We Know It Today</p>
<p>The constant strengthening of regulations in the US forced business owners to come up with creative ways to keep their businesses running. This led to the creation of riverboat casinos – casinos operating in international waters, where American gambling laws didn't apply. This allowed US casinos to operate legally even during one of the most difficult eras of gambling in America.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the 19th century, Charles Fey constructed arguably the biggest and most significant invention of the entire gambling industry: the slot machine, which paved the way for what is currently known as the single most popular casino game in the world. This era saw several other casino games, including craps, further refined, and a predecessor to another fairly popular game, video poker, was invented.</p>
<p>MOVE TO GAMBLING AS WE KNOW IT TODAY Francois &amp; Louis Blanc introduce the first single zero roulette in Germany. Although of French origin, they had to present their invention in Germany, since gambling was (again) illegal in their home country. With a house edge of only 2.70% (compared to the American roulette's 5.26%), the European roulette was a big hit among players, who now had an opportunity to test out their best roulette strategies with a relatively low house edge. In what is considered to be England's trial of the century, William Palmer, also known as Palmer the Poisoner, is hanged outside the Stafford Prison in front of a 30,000 crowd. Palmer was a problem gambler addicted to horse racing and was believed to have murdered multiple of his relatives in order to finance his gambling debts. He was convicted of poisoning his gambling friend John Parsons Cook after a horse racing game in which Cook won heavily and Palmer suffered a big loss. Palmer, increasing his already great debt by the race-gone-wrong, poisoned Cook, collected his winnings due to Cook "being sick" and, two days later, Cook was officially pronounced dead. Source Gambling on boats, the so-called riverboat gambling, takes off and becomes a successful way of circumventing gambling laws in America. Francois Blanc (the inventor of European roulette) and his wife move to Monte Carlo to take over the Casino de Monte-Carlo after persistent persuasion from Princess Caroline of Monte Carlo, who was attempting to save the casino from bankruptcy. Source Wild Bill Hickok, an infamous gunslinger and gambler, is shot from the back while playing a round of poker. The legend says he was holding a pair of eights and another pair of Aces in his hand when shot, thus coining the card combination as the dead man's hand. However, the term was only coined in print full 50 years after the incident took place, so the story is more of a legend than a fact. The identity of Wild Bill's fifth card remains a mystery to this very day. Source The version of craps where players bet against the casino is introduced. Betting against other players is still not possible. The Card Machine, the predecessor of today's , the predecessor of today's video poker , is developed by Sittman and Pitt. The machine featured 5 drums, each containing 10 cards. By inserting a coin, the drums started to spin. Once hitting the lever, the drums would stop and form a combination of 5 cards. To increase the house edge, ten of spades and jack of hearts were removed from the deck, which decreased the players' chances of hitting the royal flush significantly. There was no automatic payout mechanism, so the prizes, such as free beers or cigars, were paid out by the bartender. Source Liberty Bell and gave it automatic payouts, which turned out to be a huge success. He reportedly made more than 3,000 of them, but unfortunately never applied for a patent. The earlier versions of the machine were similar to The Card Machine from 1891, but what made this machine revolutionary was the fact that the decks of cards were replaced by three reels, and the individual cards were replaced by 5 symbols (diamonds, spades, hearts, horseshoes, and a liberty bell). Around this time, Charles Fey builds what is considered to be the first real slot machine . After several earlier versions of the machine, Fey finished Theand gave it automatic payouts, which turned out to be a huge success. He reportedly made more than 3,000 of them, but unfortunately never applied for a patent. The earlier versions of the machine were similar tofrom 1891, but what made this machine revolutionary was the fact that the decks of cards were replaced by three reels, and the individual cards were replaced by 5 symbols (diamonds, spades, hearts, horseshoes, and a liberty bell). Source Florida's The Beach Club Casino, infamous for being the "longest running illicit gambling casino" in the US, is opened. It closed nearly 50 years later. Source</p>
<p>Gambling in the 20th Century</p>
<p>Gambling in the 20th century continued on its path of "Operation Gray Zone", and riverboat casinos in America continued to grow in popularity throughout the century. Horse betting and other betting opportunities existed in many places, and betting on college football has become particularly interesting for the Americans.</p>
<p>Fey's invention of the slot machine marked the beginning of a new era, with multiple companies, including the Mills and the Novelty company, introducing their own versions of a slot machine throughout the 20th century. Several improvements, including the possibility to win a jackpot, were brought on by the new slots, jumpstarting their popularity among the crowds.</p>
<p>After the introduction of blackjack at the beginning of the 20th century, it didn't take long for the first card counters to appear in casinos. This trend was intensified by the release of the now notorious book Beat the Dealer, which quickly became the ultimate textbook for anyone interested in counting cards. The book is still considered mandatory reading for any aspiring card counter today.</p>
<p>It probably comes as no surprise that with gambling becoming more prevalent, an increasing number of people started to display problem gambling symptoms. This led to the creation of Gamblers Anonymous, a fellowship of men and women with a compulsive gambling problem, followed by the American Psychiatric Association including pathological gambling in its list of disorders and diseases roughly 15 years later.</p>
<p>GAMBLING IN THE 20TH CENTURY Russian Roulette is believed to originate during this period, although the stories surrounding its origin vary depending on the source. While some believe that Russian officers forced prisoners to play the risky game of chance for their amusement, others favor the story of the officers using Russian Roulette to showcase their fearlessness. In 1937, the term appeared in a magazine for the first time. America's first gambling boat called The City of Traverse starts its operation. With 200 gamblers waiting to bet on the opening day and hundreds more betting on horses daily since then, the boat has become a target of Chicago officials for years to come.

The casino is still operating today, offering a possibility to be accommodated in one of the few original rooms dating all the way back to the 1900s. Source The Novelty company introduces gum-dispensing slot machines that feature new fruit-inspired symbols, a move that was shortly followed by the Mills Company. The idea of using slot machines as product dispensers was born after strict anti-gambling laws were introduced in America. The slots dispensed everything from cigarettes to candy and fruity gums made by the Chicle Company. Some sources say this is what inspired the fruit and candy symbols we see on the slot machine screens today. Fun fact: if a slot machine featured a lemon symbol, it meant the machine was somehow rigged. Twenty-one, the earlier version of blackjack, is introduced in the USA. The game featured a special bonus cash prize in addition to the typical payoff for the player who got an ace of spades and a blackjack on the first two cards. This feature was later abolished.

Not only was the opening night a big flop, but the casino's first week was horrible too, resulting in losses of around $300,000. It closed down two weeks after the opening, and although the casino managed to reopen again the following year, Flamingo's founder was shot shortly after due to his alleged involvement in organized crime. The world's first card counters start to appear. In 1962, a famous book called Beat the Dealer became one of the first sources of card-counting information.

<p>Introduction of Online Gambling</p>
<p>With technology advancing at a rapid pace, the gambling industry started to look for new ways to bring their services and games to a wider audience. The turn of the millennium saw Planet Poker establish the first online poker room, and the rest is history. The introduction of online casinos created a perfect opportunity for what can only be described as poker boom, which rapidly swept across America and produced some of the biggest stars in the history of gambling.</p>
<p>The U.S. Senate attempted to dismiss the rapid rise of online gambling with their Internet Gambling Prohibition Act, but the act did not pass. Betting on sports has reached a new high thanks to the possibility of betting online in real-time, and it was only a matter of time until the first live dealer casinos started to grab their fair share of the market.</p>
<p>But, of course, as is usually the case, playing online casino games from one's laptop wasn't enough, and dedicated slots sites, mobile casinos, and even crypto casinos started to enter the market very quickly.

<p>Gambling in the New Millenium</p>
<p>The new millennium brought about significant changes and milestones in the world of gambling, and the landscape of gambling underwent a remarkable transformation. Legal reforms, technological advancements, and shifting consumer preferences continue to shape the landscape of gambling during this time, providing new opportunities and challenges for players, operators, and regulators alike.</p>
<p>In the early 2000s, various jurisdictions began to recognize the potential economic benefits of gambling and legalized multiple gambling establishments. These reforms aimed to boost revenue and stimulate economic growth in the aftermath of significant events like the 9/11 terrorist attack, particularly in the US.</p>
<p>The emergence of online casinos revolutionized the industry by offering convenient access to a wide range of casino games from the comfort of one's own home. This digital transformation enabled players to enjoy the thrill of gambling anytime, anywhere, leading to a surge in popularity and engagement of gambling as a whole.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the integration of mobile technology brought gambling to the palm of our hands. The development of mobile casino applications allowed players to engage in their favorite games on smartphones and tablets, offering unprecedented flexibility and freedom. The ability to gamble on the go further expanded the reach and accessibility of the industry, captivating a new generation of tech-savvy gamblers.</p>
<p>In 2014, the first licensed casino started to accept Bitcoin as a deposit method, which marked a significant step towards the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrency in the gambling industry.
