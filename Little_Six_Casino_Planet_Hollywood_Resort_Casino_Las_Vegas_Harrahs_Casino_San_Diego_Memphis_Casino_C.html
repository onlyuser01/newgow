<p>The omni-channel gaming industry leader, Affinity Interactive (AI), revealed a leadership appointment Thursday. The company announced it appointed Andrei Scrivens to serve as its new Chief Executive Officer (CEO).</p>
<p>Although the appointment is recent, AI explained it will be in effect as of January 1, 2023. This is when the current CEO of the company, Mary Beth Higgins, will be retiring after a long 25-year professional tenure within the gaming industry.</p>
<p>Higgins will remain with the company, according to AI. After January 1 next year, she will assume an advisory role and will help ensure a smooth transition for the new CEO. According to AI, Higgins will remain in this advisory role until June 2023.</p>
<p>In a statement released by AI, Scrivens said: "This is an incredible opportunity to lead AI during such an exciting phase of its growth trajectory." He outlined that ever since he joined AI back in 2014, he has been impressed with the leading talent and dedication of the company's management team and employees. Finally, Scrivens added: "I am grateful for Mary Beth's leadership over the past few years, and I am looking forward to building on the strong foundation we've put in place together."</p>
<p>Sharing her excitement, Higgins added that she is proud of the achievements accomplished with AI. Last but not least, she said: "This is the right time for AI to transition to its next generation of leadership, and I could not be more confident in Andrei's ability to execute on all of the exciting developments we have been working on and more."</p>
<p>Since 2019, Scrivens served as the Chief Financial Officer of AI. As CFO, he played an important role when AI was created via the merger of Sports Information Group and Affinity Gaming last year.</p>
<p>Before becoming a part of AI, Scrivens was employed by Z Capital Partners for seven years. During his tenure at the company, he served as Managing Director overseeing different hospitality and gaming investments. Prior to Z Capital Partners, Scrivens was also a part of the middle market private equity firm and boutique investment bank Chilmark Partners where he served as Director.</p>
<p>James J. Zenni Jr., AI's Chairman, said about the latest announcement: "Andrei has been instrumental in establishing Affinity Interactive as the industry-leading platform it is today, and I am confident he has the vision to lead AI to even greater success." Finally, Zenni acknowledged that the company is positioned well "to capitalize on the growing demand for omni-channel casino and online gaming products."</p>
