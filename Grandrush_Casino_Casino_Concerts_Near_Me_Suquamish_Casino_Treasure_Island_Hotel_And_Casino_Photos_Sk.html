<p>The provider of innovative solutions for the online gambling sector, SOFTSWISS, announced it secured two important certifications. The company confirmed Friday it was recognized with landmark certificates from the leading gaming equipment testing company with decades of experience, Gaming Laboratories International (GLI). As a result, the SOFTSWISS Sportsbook secured GLI-33 certification for its Event Wagering Systems, while the company's Casino Platform was recognized with a GLI-19 certification for its Interactive Gaming Systems.</p>
<p>Vitali Matsukevich, SOFTSWISS' COO, shared his excitement about the latest certifications in a statement. "Achieving the highest standards of technical compliance set by GLI for both the SOFTSWISS Casino Platform and Sportsbook is a strategic leap forward for us," he said.</p>
<p>Additionally, Matsukevich revealed that the latest certifications recognize the quality and innovation of SOFTSWISS' solutions while at the same time predicted that they pave the way for further expansion to new regulated jurisdictions around the globe. Finally, SOFTSWISS' COO pointed out: "I would like to thank all the teams involved for reaching another significant milestone for SOFTSWISS."</p>
<p>GLI-33 and GLI-19 certifications represent landmark achievements for companies within the online gambling sector. The certifications recognize companies that meet a rigorous standard for player protection, security and fairness. To secure the aforementioned certificates, the products developed by iGaming providers undergo extensive monitoring, including processes related to game development and even payout mechanics.</p>
<p>SOFTSWISS acknowledged that the GLI-33 and GLI-19 certifications mark an important milestone. The company also predicted that the certifications will ease its licensing processes, considering that the certifications confirm that the company covers a majority of local software requirements.</p>
<p>GLI has extensive experience within the iGaming sector and it is globally recognized for its gaming testing capabilities. The company launched in 1989 and has helped in the process of developing a technical standard for the global gaming vertical.</p>
<p>GLI-33 and GLI-19 are important certifications for companies within the gambling sector. To develop the certifications, GLI fused policies, regulations and guidelines from different gambling industry stakeholders, including the UK Gambling Commission, the British Columbia Gaming Police and Enforcement Branch, as well as the Nevada Gaming Control Board, among others.</p>
<p>The latest announcement from SOFTSWISS comes on the heels of another important achievement. Earlier this month, the company released details regarding the performance of SOFTSWISS Sportsbook for the first half of 2023. SOFTSWISS confirmed that an overwhelming majority, 78.3% of the bets were placed via mobile devices, while desktop devices amounted to 21.7% of the bets for H1 2023.</p>
