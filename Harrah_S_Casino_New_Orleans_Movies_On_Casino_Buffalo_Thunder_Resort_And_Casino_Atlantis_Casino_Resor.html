<p>Two Bracelets in One Week for Kahle Burns</p>
<p>Kahle Burns won his first WSOP bracelet earlier this week, when he won the €25,500 High Roller Event. It was only a few days late that he won his second bracelet after taking down the €2,500 Short Deck NLHE tournament.</p>
<p>In the High Roller event, Burns found himself amongst a roster of talented poker pros. At the final table, he beat out Robert Campbell, who is currently #2 on the WSOP Player of the Year leaderboard, and Sam Trickett.</p>
<p>A few days later in the Short Deck event, Burns ended up heads up at the competition’s final table with Manig Loeser. He had nearly double the chips of his competitor and the last hand came down to Loeser’s Kh Js against Burns’ Ah Jh. The board came down As Qs 7h 9d 7d, giving Burns two-pair.</p>
<p>In securing the first-place title, Burns won a prize worth $113,036 while Loeser earned $32,220. Now, his total tournament winnings total over $6 million and he’s in third-place on Australia’s All-Time Money List.</p>
<p>“It’s been like a whirlwind week. Two bracelets in a week. It’s crazy. Lucky enough to win one live tournament in a week, now I’ve won two in a week, it’s quite fortunate.”</p>
<p>Burns has had a great year in 2019, and this is the perfect way to finish it off. He’s cashed in over 15 events this year, and placed first in Crown Poker Championship’s No Limit Hold’em – High Roller Shot Clock event.</p>
<p>He came incredibly close to earning his first WSOP bracelet in July, when he competed in the $10,000 No Limit Hold’em Six-Handed Championship. He ended up in second place, with Anuj Agarwal taking the bracelet and grand prize worth $630,000.</p>
<p>About Kahle Burns</p>
<p>Burns is an Australian poker player who hails from Geelong. He first started playing with play-money poker online, with some success as he racked up several million chips over time. He then moved on to play in free pub poker events, before moving to real-money games at Crown Casino.</p>
<p>Grinding was the key to Burns’ success, as he moved up the stakes to eventually play in $50/$100 NLHE cash games. Then, his first big cash came when he came first in the 2013 WSOP Asia Pacific Main Event.</p>
<p>Since then, he’s seen a steady stream of poker tournament wins. His biggest payout came in 2017, when he came third in the Triton Poker Super High Roller Series Main Event for a cool $1.3 million.</p>
<p>Burns has been on an impressive winning streak lately, and is definitely a player to watch. 2020 could be an incredible year for this talented poker player.</p>
