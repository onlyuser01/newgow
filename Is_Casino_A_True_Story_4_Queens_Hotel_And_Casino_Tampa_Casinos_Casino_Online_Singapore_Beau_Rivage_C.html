    <h1>Is Casino A True Story 4 Queens Hotel And Casino Tampa Casinos Casino Online Singapore Beau Rivage C</h1>

<p>Hello, I have such a situation with https://www.bitcoincasino.io/ru</p>
<p>I played and they didn’t want to pay me my winnings,</p>
<p>From the beginning, I played there and everything seemed to be fine.</p>
<p>But not much lost money in the region of 25,000 - 28,000 rubles.</p>
<p>After that, after some time I went from playing my lost money.</p>
<p>And luck smiled.</p>
<p>I won from about 28,000 rubles 100,400 rubles.</p>
<p>From the beginning in live chat they wrote to me that my withdrawal of 15,000 rubles was being processed, but then they wrote that the account was blocked and here is the next correspondence with life chat</p>
<p>They asked for verification.</p>
<p>I sent my passport</p>
<p>Send a selfie with a passport</p>
<p>Screenshot of the wallet from where replenished funds.</p>
<p>Here is the chat chat at https://www.bitcoincasino.io/en</p>
