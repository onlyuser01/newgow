    <h1>Casinos In Montana Usa Vegas X Casino Login Main Street Station Casino Las Vegas Riversweeps Online</h1>

<p>Dear Michael,</p>
<p>Thank you for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your bad experience. Please, could you answer a few questions, so I can fully understand what the issue is?</p>
<p>Was this your first withdrawal in this casino? How much did you deposit accumulatively into your account since you have opened it? I have checked the Terms and Conditions, and this is what I found in the "Withdrawals" section: "If a player's accumulated deposit amount does not exceed €200, player will be entitled only up to X10 last deposit. This maximum payout will be enforced also in cases where the player made additional deposits which were deemed at the sole discretion of the Casino to have been made in order to exceed the €200 accumulated deposit amount."</p>
<p>If I understand it correctly, you have deposited €30 and even if you succeeded to accumulate winnings of €2000, you were entitled to withdraw X10 last deposit, which equals to €300. Unfortunately, if this is the case, there is not much I can do for you in this matter. I will be waiting for your reply regarding accumulated deposit patiently. Thank you in advance.</p>
<p>I would like to emphasize, that Casino Guru considers this regulation to be unfair and it’s listed in our Fair Gambling Codex between hidden and predatory rules: https://casino.guru/fair-gambling-codex-for-casinos#hidden-predatory-rules</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
