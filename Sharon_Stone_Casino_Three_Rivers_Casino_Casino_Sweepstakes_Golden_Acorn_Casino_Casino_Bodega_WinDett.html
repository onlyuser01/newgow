    <h1>Sharon Stone Casino Three Rivers Casino Casino Sweepstakes Golden Acorn Casino Casino Bodega WinDett</h1>

<p>Furthermore, let’s look at the wording of this rule:</p>
<ul>
<li>7.5. If a player closes his casino account due to "problems with gambling" / "loss of self-control over the game" / "gambling addiction", in this case, the player is prohibited from playing on the sites of the casino partners, which are indicated in the license of this casino</li>
</ul>
<p>With the way it is worded, this rule does not specifically apply to the casino the rule is written on. In other words, the rule is not written as, for example, "A player cannot register to this casino if he/she has previously self-excluded at a partner casino". The rule expects that someone reads and remembers a rule that was written on a different casino, again where the full list of casinos for which this applies is not readily available on the casino’s page itself.</p>
<p>There is also rule 7.3: "If you want to delete your account due to gambling addiction, or your account was blocked by due to fraudulent activities, you agree to never create a new account on this Website. The Company is not responsible for any losses you may incur after opening a new account. We reserve the right to delete an account violating these conditions at any time." This rule is more clearly stated, and points out that a player only agrees to never create a new account on the website if they deleted their account / got their account blocked for fraudulent activities on WinDetta itself.</p>
<p>So, a player registering to this casino is essentially only agreeing to not play on other partner casinos once they close the account in the casino that the rule is mentioned on. I would dare say that a player who has self-excluded on a different Altacore casino, no matter what the apparent reason is, is not breaking any T&amp;Cs on WinDetta by registering and playing with the way T&amp;C 7.5 is worded. If anything, they're breaking the T&amp;Cs of other casinos.</p>
<p>The rule also doesn’t mention any future casinos that the group will open, so even if a list of casinos was provided at the point of my self-exclusion, WinDetta wouldn’t be mentioned as it didn’t exist, since the casino apparently opened in 2023 and I last played at an Altacore casino in 2022. This means I would not even be breaking the T&amp;Cs of their other casinos since there is no mention of the rule applying retroactively to their new casinos.</p>
<p>So let’s say a player is extremely dilligent and keeps a very detailed list of all the casinos they have played and self-excluded at, as well as all the other casinos specific groups own. The player is then expected to keep updating the list as the group opens more and more casinos and assume they are not allowed to play in the new casino.</p>
<p>Assuming I had taken all of those precautions and interpreted everything how the casino expects people to interpret their rules, when I opened an account at Wintopia, got verified and withdrew some money, the only natural conclusion would be that I am allowed to play on Altacore casinos that opened after my self-exclusion in 2022. Thus, the claim that I bypassed any "systems" cannot possibly be valid, and in the case that such systems did exist, they were insufficient, or, more likely in my opinion, designed so that the casino could take advantage of people.</p>
