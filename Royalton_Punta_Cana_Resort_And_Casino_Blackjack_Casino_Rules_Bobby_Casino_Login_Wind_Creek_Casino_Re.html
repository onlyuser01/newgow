<p>The American Gaming Association's (AGA) responsible gambling initiatives continue to gain support from operators. Several have already joined, and Penn National Gaming is adding its name to the list. It has become part of the AGA's Have A Game Plan campaign.</p>
<p>The campaign will be promoted on the Barstool Sportsbook digital platform and social media platforms by the regional casino operator. It currently offers sports betting across 13 states. All Penn National physical retail locations will be activated with the message Have A Game Plan.</p>
<p>Jon Kaplowitz, Head of Interactive at Penn National, stated in an announcement, "Responsible gaming is core to our sports betting operations, and we're thrilled to extend these efforts through our partnership with the AGA's 'Have A Game Plan' initiative. Our customers are sports fans first, and this campaign will allow us to educate everyone, whether they are new to sports betting or seasoned bettors, on how to wager responsibly in a fan-friendly way."</p>
<p>AGA launched the socially responsible campaign in 2019 to help consumers understand the basics of responsible betting, particularly as more options are available across the US. The campaign emphasizes four aspects of responsible gaming: setting and maintaining a budget, making sure betting is not a social activity, understanding the odds and playing with trusted operators.</p>
<p>Casey Clark, Senior Vice-President of the AGA, added that Penn National's extensive digital and land-based footprint will help to amplify the Have A Game Plan campaign to consumers across the nation.</p>
<p>"We are appreciative of Penn National's significant commitment to the campaign, as we collectively work to ensure every sports bettor is equipped with the knowledge to wager responsibly," he added.</p>
<p>The company joined the 20 existing partners in the campaign, which covers sports leagues, teams and media companies.</p>
<p>Penn National has previously integrated responsible gaming into its corporate structure. This ensures that its employees are educated in this area and aims to continue its commitment to educating its customers.</p>
<p>Most recently, the NFL's New York Jets joined the campaign last September. The team was followed by MGM Resorts International and its BetMGM sports betting arm. DraftKings, Entain and Rush Street Interactive are also involved.</p>
