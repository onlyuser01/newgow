<p>JeffBet, a casino licensed by the UK Gambling Commission, has secured a major content milestone with the operator confirming that moving forward, it will feature games by Microgaming, a respected iGaming supplier.</p>
<p>Detailing the new opportunity, JeffBet explained that its brand is determined to bring players in the regulated market in the United Kingdom the most entertaining, fun, safe and secure place to enjoy their favorite games. Moving forward, these games will include Microgaming’s smashing hit series, Mega Moolah.</p>
<p>Mega Moolah is one of the best-known games by Microgaming, and it has been known to award massive prizes to lucky players. The game’s highest jackpot won in the United Kingdom is £13.2m.</p>
<p>Commenting on this new opportunity with Microgaming, JeffBet spokesperson said that the company was delighted to be adding a progressive jackpot game such as Mega Moolah to offer to loyal players in the market. "The addition of Mega Moolah further enhances our portfolio of progressive jackpot games," the spokesperson explained in the press release.</p>
<p>The arrival of Microgaming as one of the available content suppliers is a major milestone for the casino, which was established in 2022 and is a new operator in the iGaming space in the United Kingdom. JeffBet.com offers games by more than 60 suppliers and it provides players with a flexible variety of payment options, flexible withdrawal limits, and a spot-on mobile experience.</p>
<p>The company also supports pay-by-phone deposits and e-wallet services to make the process simple. Microgaming on the other hand has been considerably scaling its content offer over the past months. The company similarly made a leadership change, appointing Stephen Fisk as its new Chief Executive Officer.</p>
<p>Players at JeffBet.com now have a chance to try their luck with Mega Moolah and see if they can get the reels to favor them.</p>
