    <h1>Bet Casino Login How To Play Roulette In Casino Four Jacks Hotel And Casino Freeplay Casino Seminole</h1>

<p>Swedish developer of online casino content Lady Luck Games AB Group announced in a press release that one of the companies of the group, ReelNRG, has obtained its B2B license to operate in the UK.</p>
<p>‘Massive Achievement’ for the Company</p>
<p>The B2B license granted to ReelNRG by the UK Gambling Commission will allow the distribution of gaming content in the UK from both ReelNRG and Lady Luck Games AB Group via integration of the company’s platform with partner iGaming operators.</p>
<p>Commenting on the news, Mads Jørgensen, Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer of LL Lucky Games AB, hailed the significance of the moment marked by the B2B gaming license, granting access to its “premium gaming content … in the world’s preeminent and established market, the United Kingdom.”</p>
<p>“This is a moment we`ve all been waiting for, and to see this finally happening is a massive achievement and will open many new doors for Lady Luck Games,” Jørgensen concluded.</p>
<p>The B2B license acquired from the Gambling Commission will allow players in the UK to experience the thrill from Lady Luck Games’ top-performing titles such as The Treasures of Tizoc, Beetle Bailey, and recently released Astro Anna, as well as ReelNRG’s Dark Spells, Genie’s Gold and Mr. Mostacho.</p>
<p>The developer’s latest release, SpinJoy Society Megaways, which was developed in an agreement with the holder of the official rights of the Megaways mechanic, Big Time Gaming, will also be part of the deal. Earlier in the month, Lady Luck Games introduced the fruit-themed slot game to players in another European jurisdiction, Greece, via its local partner Novibet.</p>
<p>The UKGC licensing process is recognized globally as one of the highest bars to entry for a gaming company as the UK regulator is known for considering every application with the highest attention to detail, and the B2B license will empower Lady Luck to continue growing its presence globally.</p>
<p>Latin American Expansion Continued</p>
<p>Just days ago, Lady Luck Games announced its footprint in Latin America expanded after the Swedish developer established a partnership with one of Mexico’s leading iGaming operators, Logrand Entertainment Group.</p>
<p>According to the terms of the agreement, the operator of multiple land-based casinos and online gaming brand Strendus Casino will offer via the Strendus.mx website Lady Luck Games’ popular game titles, including initially Weight of the Gun, Mr. Alchemister and Ruler of Egypt, and later on followed by The Treasures of Tizoc, Beetle Bailey and Valholl Wild Hammers, which will be made available to via Slot Matrix.</p>
