    <h1>Sun Palace Casino Harrahs Casino San Diego Casino In Hot Springs Del Lago Resort And Casino Choctaw</h1>

<p>I made a deposit on 30.04.2023 in the amount of $ 75 to this casino, after a while I won $ 120 and tried to withdraw funds, the support service told me to wait a few hours, but there was no withdrawal for more than 10 hours and I almost lost everything, they replied immediately after that that they are sorry that it took a long time, but now everything is fine, after that I won again and I was told to pass verification, this can be seen in the first screenshot.</p>
<p>I immediately passed verification, but the withdrawal of funds did not work, and I lost almost everything again, and immediately after that I received an answer from them that everything was fine with the account. As you can see, after both losses, the answer immediately came to me that everything was fine</p>
<p>Now the most important point, after verification, before making a new deposit, I asked the support service if everything was OK with my account, if I could get a win, to which I received a positive response, this can be seen in the third screenshot</p>
<p>Now the most important point, after verification, before making a new deposit, I asked the support service if everything was OK with my account, if I could get a win, to which I received a positive response, this can be seen in the third screenshot The operator assured me that I would be able to withdraw funds in the standard mode, I managed to win $ 700, but the money was not withdrawn to me again, citing various problems</p>
<p>As you can see, after I was assured that I could safely make a deposit and play, problems began and I was not given any answers for 24 hours, although they assured me before making a deposit that everything was fine, then they asked me to go through verification again I have passed the verification again, but the money is not being withdrawn to me. Please note that whenever I partially lost funds or completely, I immediately received an answer that everything was fine with my account, and when I won, problems happened, also please note that before the last win, after verification, I clarified before making a deposit whether everything was okay, to which I received a positive response, please help get your winnings</p>
