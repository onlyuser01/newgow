    <h1>100 Dollars Free No Deposit Casino Casino Boat At Myrtle Beach Speaking Rock Casino Casino Shrevepor</h1>

<p>The self-proclaimed king of online sportsbooks BetMGM and the premier casino, sports betting, and daily fantasy company FanDuel have expanded their deals with the National Hockey League. The operators are now the first North American sports betting partners of the league.</p>
<p>The NHL Expanded Its Deal with the Two Operators</p>
<p>The deal will grant the two betting companies the right to use the NHL’s branding to promote their sports betting products to customers in Canada and the United States. The league will continue to provide the operators with custom sports content, helping them to differentiate their offerings from their competitors. Additionally, the NHL will promote FanDuel and BetMGM’s branding across official live hockey events.</p>
<p>The two operators will commit to launching various responsible gambling campaigns alongside the NHL. Other activations and hospitality deals are also envisioned by the deal.</p>
<p>The agreements celebrate the launch of sports betting in Ontario. The Canadian province legalized online sports betting on April 4 and allowed countless online operators to launch their offerings in the state.</p>
<p>Opportunities Await in the Budding Canadian Market</p>
<p>BetMGM and FanDuel were the NHL’s first sports betting partners in the United States, as emphasized by Keith Wachtel, the chief business officer and senior executive vice president of the National Hockey League. She said that she is excited to expand the league’s relationship with the two “leaders in the sportsbook and mobile betting marketplace” into Canada as well.</p>
<p>Wachtel recognizes the opportunities that await in the Canadian betting market and is delighted to have BetMGM and FanDuel as the league’s partners. She said:</p>
<p>“Canada’s new sports betting landscape presents a tremendous opportunity to further fan engagement and continue our progressive approach with the sports gaming industry.” NHL chief business officer Keith Wachtel</p>
<p>Adam Greenblatt, chief executive officer of BetMGM, praised the partnership with the hockey league as something that allows it to reach hockey fans and provide them with enhanced hockey wagering offerings. He added that the expansion of the partnership with the league is in line with BetMGM’s recent launch in Ontario.</p>
<p>Amy Howe, chief executive officer of FanDuel, is just as glad to reinforce the operator’s relationship with the NHL. She said that the partnership has helped the league and FanDuel usher in true innovation in sports betting through initiatives like the NHL Network Odds Ticker and custom NHL sports betting content for social media.</p>
<p>FanDuel is another betting operator that received approval from the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario and launched its offerings in the province. In early March, the NHL welcomed the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation as an official betting partner in Canada.</p>
