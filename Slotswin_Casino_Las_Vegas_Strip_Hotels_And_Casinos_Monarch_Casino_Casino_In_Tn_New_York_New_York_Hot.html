With its specific book mechanics in place, Book of Kemet is a high-volatility 5×3 game with 10 pay lines that continues BGaming’s popular book/Ancient Egypt-themed series.

<p>Set on An “Awesome Historical Adventure”</p>
<p>BGaming’s chief marketing officer (CMO), Kate Puteiko, described the new slot as a “generous” one packed with all the features meant to send players on yet another amazing historical adventure. As further explained by Puteiko, the provider constantly works on creating “slots with favorite fan mechanics” that are prone to turn into hit games.</p>
<p>Giving the example of their iconic Book of Cats MEGAWAYS and Book of Pyramids slots, the CMO explained their portfolio is this way subject to more diversification, which in turn makes it more appealing for all players.</p>
<p>Book of Kemet carries players on the fascinating tale of the popular ancient civilization with breathtaking riches that need to be discovered using the clues found in the mysterious book.</p>
<p>As the action gradually unfolds on the nicely designed grid filled with Egypt-themed symbols, the player’s job is to discover as much of the hidden gold of Cairo as possible. To do this, they must look at the map where every combo of matching symbols sheds light on a fresh part of the mystery.</p>
<p>When three scatter symbols simultaneously land on the reels, players activate the Free Spins Round. The latter hosts a randomly selected expanding symbol. The round can also be retriggered, thus adding an extra expanding symbol to the same round.</p>
<p>Slot aficionados eager to immediately start exploring the Free Spins Round can take advantage of the available Bonus Buy feature. Players are given the chance to buy up to nine random expanded symbols.</p>
<p>The new slot also comes with a Chance x2.5 feature that adds even more thrill to the gameplay while boosting the winning potential when engaged in the main game.</p>
<p>At the end of February, SkillOnNet announced an important content integration agreement with BGaming, with the latter making its mobile-friendly slot, arcade, and provably fair games available to SkillOnNet partner operators.</p>
