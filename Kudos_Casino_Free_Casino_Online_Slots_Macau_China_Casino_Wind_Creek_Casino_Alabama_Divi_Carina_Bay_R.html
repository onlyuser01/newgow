    <h1>Kudos Casino Free Casino Online Slots Macau China Casino Wind Creek Casino Alabama Divi Carina Bay R</h1>

<p>The Italian iGaming market continues to attract prominent suppliers even though the local regulatory climate is one of the toughest in Europe</p>
<p>G Games has not shied away from a challenge, taking its product portfolio live with one of the country’s most prominent and best-established companies, NetBet.</p>
<p>As a result, NetBet will gain access to a number of G Games’ titles, which will be promptly integrated with NetBet’s platform and bring fresh experiences to local audiences in Italy. G Games stands out by virtue of its advanced mathematics and design of titles, which makes it a perfect fit for NetBet.</p>
<p>Bringing Excellent Cinema and TV-Inspired Games</p>
<p>NetBet too has been making a point of teaming up with trusted and respected iGaming developers to maintain its game variety and cutting-edge portfolio of titles. Among the games that G Games will bring is a selection of classic slots and games that have been inspired by cinema and TV shows.</p>
<p>Some of the absolute must-play games here are Cheeky Fruits 6 Deluxe, The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly, and Age of Athena, to name just a few. NetBet Italy’s PR manager Claudia Georgevici welcomed the opportunity to see G Games arrive on NetBet’s platform:</p>
<p>NetBet prides itself on delivering an engaging and safe online experience for every player visiting our site, meaning we’re always looking to evolve and bring new talent on board that we can trust. NetBet Italy’s PR manager Claudia Georgevici</p>
<p>Georgevici said that NetBet was stoked to see G Games work alongside her company and argued that the casino games the supplier brought were excellent picks for local audiences who will enjoy them a great deal. G Games CCO Helen Walton was similarly pleased to see the next chapter in the collaboration between NetBet and her company shape up.</p>
<p>Content Offer in Italy Grows for NetBet</p>
<p>The two companies have been working together for years now, and Walton said that G Games was absolutely delighted to have the opportunity and collaborate with the operator in Italy, NetBet’s own stomping ground. NetBet in the meantime has made sure to continue and grow its content library.</p>
<p>The company has been most recently bolstered by content deals with ESA Gaming, which brought the EasySwipe content portfolio. CT Interactive also signed a partnership with NetBet at the end of March, boosting the content library once again.</p>
