    <h1>Santa Ana Casino Hotel Winstar Hotel And Casino Tropicana Casino In Atlantic City Durango Casino Ope</h1>

<p>Yes Hello dear forum,</p>
<p>I have had an account with Mifinity since 2022 and verified myself back then, and reached the limit of 1000 euros almost 2 days ago, according to the email from Mifinity, and now I can no longer receive money from the casino or pay it out from Mifinity There is no response via email, and I don't understand why I only have a limit of 1000 euros for transactions even though I'm verified... since I've only rarely used Mifinty and it's now almost a four-digit limit The amount is that I can't get to and I haven't read very positive reports in several threads regarding support, so I wanted to ask if there are people here in the forum who have VIP status or have direct contact and can ask what's going on . Over 48 HOURS no response (2 emails), no chat, no option in the account although there is always a notification Transaction limit reached go to your profile On your own...etc smells like a long process to get your money. ..and I can't understand at all that it's only 1000 euros, otherwise I always read 2000 euros or 20000 euros when verified, and they got all the documents directly back then almost 2 years ago, only the money that disappeared from MuchB and Now something like that... just problems and frustration with all these providers.</p>
