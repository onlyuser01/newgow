<p>Pragmatic Play, a leading content provider to the iGaming Industry that offers an innovative, regulated, and mobile-oriented multi-product portfolio, has expanded its pre-existing relationship with the Romanian gambling operator Maxbet.ro.</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play and Maxbet.ro Add Live Casino to Partnership</p>
<p>The expanded deal will see Pragmatic Play power Maxbet.ro’s offerings with live casino content. This includes the supplier’s beloved live dealer games, such as baccarat, blackjack, and the Mega Wheel TV-show-inspired offering.</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play is renowned for the quality of its content. The company produces as many as five new games a month and is quickly expanding its reach through various partnerships with betting operators. Pragmatic Play’s live offerings, which include card games, casino games, bingo, and others, are just as liked as its slots, engaging thousands of bettors across numerous markets.</p>
<p>Thanks to this new deal, Pragmatic Play will reinforce its presence in the Romanian market and increase its presence in Eastern Europe. Throughout 2021, the company inked several additional deals with local operators, supplying them with its premium slots games. The addition of live casino titles to Maxbet.ro is a further testament to Pragmatic Play’s growth drive.</p>
<p>The Partners Are Happy to Deepen their Commitment</p>
<p>Victor Rusinov, the chief executive officer of Maxbet.ro, is delighted to add Pragmatic Play’s cutting-edge live casino titles to his company’s offerings. He is happy by the opportunity to deepen the ties between Maxbet.ro and Pragmatic Play and is convinced that the Romanian bettors will relish in the latter’s world-class selection of live casino products:</p>
<p>“They [the Maxbet.ro players] will now have a breadth of content to enjoy, including exciting slots, more traditional card games or the innovative Mega Wheel as we continue to secure our position as a leading operator in Romania.” Maxbet.ro CEO Victor Rusinov</p>
<p>Yossi Barzely, the chief business development officer for Pragmatic Play, said that his company shares Rusinov’s sentiments and is glad to develop its relationship with Maxbet.ro. Barzely emphasized that this crucial partnership helps Pragmatic Play expand its footprint in Romania and boost its renown on the local market.</p>
<p>Barzely added that his team can’t wait to see how Maxbet.ro’s bettors will react to the new content:</p>
<p>“Our award-winning Live Casino portfolio represents an exceptionally strong proposition and we are excited to see how Maxbet.ro’s players, that currently enjoy our slots, engage with our live solution.” Pragmatic Play chief business development officer Yossi Barzely</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play has been quickly growing its global footprint by signing strategic partnerships with operators across key markets. Two weeks ago, the provider launched its bingo offerings in Venezuela, thanks to a partnership with Facilibet.</p>
