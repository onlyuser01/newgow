    <h1>Casino Arizona Hotel Where Can I Watch Casino Bingo Billy Casino Casino In Elk Grove M Casino Christ</h1>

<p>Gaming Innovation Group Inc. (GiG) and Rank Entertainment Holdings have sealed a deal for a multi-year partnership that would last for a minimum of five years. The agreement would allow Rank Entertainment to tap into GiG’s proven iGaming platform that will lead to a stronger international push for Rank.</p>
<p>What Is Expected of the GiG – Rank Entertainment Holdings Agreement</p>
<p>Other than the provision of GiG’s player account management, the agreement would also feature frontend solutions through the deployment of the company’s Content Management System that would help Rank enhance the capabilities of its product offering. The deal would also focus on all managed services, with emphasis on business and media operations, while following the popular revenue share model.</p>
<p>Rank plans on improving its present online offerings on behalf of its reputable customers, while also making sure not to lose the focus on customers’ exact needs. The company is also known to put great emphasis on the ‘human touch’ strategy they have been working on over the past few years.</p>
<p>By using GiG’s technologies connected to their iGaming platform, Rank would manage to add more automation to their local brand building process. With the help of gamification and Logic, GiG’s rules engine, Rank will successfully supply top-notch player experience while modernizing its offerings.</p>
<p>Rank’s CEO, Asanga Warusavitharna, has stated the company takes great pride in the new partnership while looking forward to helping the brand reach international markets. Warusavitharna continued:</p>
<p>“Throughout the process, it was evident that this was a style of project that GiG had delivered several times, consistently outlining the best way to deliver from a technical and a services-driven perspective. We are very much looking forward to our long-term partnership and are excited to go on this journey with GiG.” Rank Group CEO Asanga Warusavitharna</p>
<p>GiG CEO Richard Brown also said the company was ‘delighted’ to partner up with an industry veteran that has a flawless reputation in the brick-and-mortar gambling casino market. Brown added that GiG is extremely proud of the fact that Rank had chosen to put its trust in GiG’s technology and managed services. Furthermore, the CEO stated that Rank’s idea to further develop player experience and automation would be a perfect match with GiG’s Business-to-Business strategies.</p>
<p>Both Brands Are Experienced and Set to Grow</p>
<p>Rank Entertainment is privately owned and counts many decades of experience in the retail field. They have successfully opened two casinos and resorts in Africa under their reputable brand Marina and are determined to continue their exponential growth.</p>
<p>Accordingly, they have already added a few similar projects to their portfolio, including nine venues in regulated African areas, one project in Nepal, and more venues in the pipeline. The Group also owns several gambling establishments in the UK. After the profits of its Grosvenor Hotel and Casino dropped last year, the Group urged London to revitalize. The new partnership with GiG would help them speed up their expansion worldwide.</p>
<p>Gaming Innovation Group was founded almost a decade ago and it is listed on both the Oslo and the Stockholm Nasdaq Stock Exchanges. Primarily aiming to help their partners grow in a sustainable manner and increase their profits with the help of innovation, high-quality services, and scalable technologies, GiG has also expanded its partnership with leading European iGaming operator Betsson Group in September.</p>
<p>Undeniably, GiG is a top company in the iGaming technology field. It offers products, services, and solutions to a wide array of operators of iGaming platforms. Its main goal is to become the number one platform in the industry as well as the most important media supplier while offering state-of-the-art solutions to its iGaming customers and partners.</p>
