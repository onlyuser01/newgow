<p>King Kong Cash review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>King Kong has fascinated the world since Edgar Wallace invented the colossal ape back in 1933. This version of him puts a crown on his head and a hawaiian shirt on his back. The art style suggests that there might be more influence from the Nintendo owned gorilla Donkey Kong rather than the cinematic giant.</p>
<p>He’s certainly got a more chill look at the top of the Empire State Building than the beast who is ultimately killed by beauty and a squadron of biplanes. Though the biplanes still make an appearance.</p>
<p>There’s plenty of great apes in the realm of slots, but only one is King.</p>
<p>Big win in the King Kong Cash slot</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The graphics are one of the major draws of this slot. The character of Kong is a cheery character snoozing beside the reels, ready to jump up and award the player a feature. His animations are crisp 3D renderings.</p>
<p>The reels themselves are adorned with a range of interesting symbols. The animals all come with kooky outfits, while the ace to ten symbols are in bold colours that jump out as they spin.</p>
<p>The sound scape is a little more limited than you’d expect from a slot with this much visual flare. But it does a good enough job of generating atmosphere. And it does so without overdoing it and becoming invasive or annoying.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>The base game is a five reel slot with three rows per reel and twenty win lines.</p>
<p>To spice things up, there are randomly triggered features that can affect any given spin. When the features are triggered, King Kong jumps up and activates the feature himself. These features include things like respins or additional wilds.</p>
<p>All 5 randomly triggered bonus features</p>
<p>There is a range of bonus features as well, but no gamble feature. Though with everything else in play, you probably won’t miss a simple game of double-or-nothing too much.</p>
<p>Random feature - King Kong Streak respin feature</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter symbol.</p>
<p>Three or more Scatter symbols anywhere on the reels trigger a Bonus. There are five possible bonuses that can be triggered. In order to decide which one the player is to be awarded they must spin the wheel.</p>
<p>The five possible bonus games on the wheel are:</p>
<p>Barrel Blast Bonus : in this picking game, the player selects barrels to reveal their contents. Each barrel contains an object that is associated with a particular win amount (a multiple of the player’s bet per spin). Once the player gets three of a kind, they are awarded that multiplier. The player can trigger the Big Monkey Bonus from this minigame.</p>

The barrel’s contents dictate if the player advances 1–5 spaces or end the bonus right there. The player can trigger the Big Monkey Bonus from this minigame too.</p>

These are added to a counter, and when the counter hits a threshold, the player gets further free spins and the reels are upgraded.</p>

Golden Kong Free Spins : These are more like regular free spins except played on grid with four rows instead of three. However, they come in two stages. In the first stage players collect sticky Wilds. In the second stage, sticky Wilds are added to the mix. These Wilds remain in place even as the reels spin.</p>

Big Monkey Bonus: This game involves spinning a wheel to determine a win multiplier, and then selecting a barrel which either gives the player an additional free spin or ends the feature. This cycle continues until the player picks the latter.</p>

<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 95.79%, a little under our yardstick for average of roughly 96%, but only just.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.20 up to a maximum of $/£/€200.00 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is low to medium, which makes it a weak match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Full paytable for King Kong Cash slot</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>With its fun character and top notch graphics, King Kong Cash makes an excellent first impression.</p>
<p>It’s main downside for us, however, is the low RTP (95.79%) which is a little below average, and the low to medium volatility. Either by itself could be countered by the other, but both together make the slot useless for anyone pursuing our slot strategies.</p>
<p>If RTP and volatility are less important to you, you may well find a lot to like in this slot.</p>
