<p>SkillOnNet, a global gaming and entertainment behemoth, has signed a new partnership with up-and-coming iGaming developer and casino supplier Spade Gaming. Thanks to this new alliance, Spade Gaming will be able to bring its established product portfolio and make it available for SkillOnNet players.</p>
<p>SkillOnNet Keeps Momentum in Content Variety</p>
<p>Spade Gaming has developed a number of excellent slots, ranging from innovative skill-based arcade concepts to classic and video titles. The company has gathered momentum in Asian and Latin American markets in particular and has been happy to continue building up.</p>
<p>Part of this build-up is thanks to spot-on games such as Fishing God and Fishing War, which will be among the many titles that SkillOnNet can now extend to partner casino operators and brands. SkillOnNet already features more than 3,500 titles that include table games, progressive slots, instant win titles, bingo, and live dealer games, among many others.</p>
<p>SkillOnNet head of games Jani Kontturi was pleased with the new partnership and said that Spade Gaming is building some quality gaming content all around. Kontturi noted that Spade Gaming’s presence in the Latin American and Asian markets was a significant advantage.</p>
<p>We’re pretty confident their games are going to massively popular with European players, as well. Fishing War and Fishing God are hugely engaging titles, and they bolster our arcade-style content, which has a fast-growing audience in all markets.</p>
<p>Spade Gaming general manager Danny Vincent was similarly pleased to be teaming up with SkillOnNet Games and welcomed the opportunity. Vincent had this to add:</p>
<p>We’re passionate about building games that engage and entertain, and this deal means our games will reach new audiences and new markets through some of the world’s biggest gaming brands.</p>
<p>Recently, SkillOnNet added Ezugi as another trusted supplier to extend to its partner casinos and brands. SkillOnNet is determined to bring leading solutions and titles to its business partners. SkillOnNet also teamed up with German supplier of iGaming products Hölle Games back in September, and the company helped roll out Wazdan content in Ontario back in August.</p>
