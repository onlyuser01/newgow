    <h1>Edgewater Casino Resort Matrix Casino Cypress Bayou Casino Hotel Quest Casino Spokane Online Games C</h1>

<p>I'm just looking at this and my guess is that the winning is probably correct. Let me explain this.</p>
<p>If you bet 5 per spin, then your coin value was 0.5. According to the pay table, you get 120 coins for 5x symbol 7.</p>
<p>The game doesn't pay winnings from all paylines, but it only pays the highest winning on a payline. I believe you won on the payline no. 4. (see the attached screenshot)</p>
<p>I tried to write down everything you described here and re-create the situation you saw on your screen.</p>
<p>I believe your 3 symbols of 7 were counted + 2x symbol WILD (that substitutes symbol 7 in this case). That's 5x symbol 7 in total. That should be 120 coins, so 0.5 (coin value) x 120 coins = Â£60</p>
<p>You actually won more, I believe it's because you first got wild on one reel, won something and then it triggered re-spin (when you get wilds, it always triggers the re-spin). Then you got wilds on 2 reels, won Â£60 and then you triggered the re-spin again and didn't win anything or some lower amount. The first spin and the las tone made Â£15 in total and the middle one paid out Â£60.</p>
<p>Since starburst is from NetEnt, I'm sure they could even find the specific spin and even a screenshot of the spin. If you won Â£75, then you should see the specific timestamp in your casino gaming history (and the casino support can see it as well).</p>
<p>The casino can submit a ticket to NetEnt and then wait for a reply from NetEnt. They should explain what happened and if it was paid correctly.</p>
<p>Anyway, I believe there's nothing strange about the winnings you got paid ðŸ™‚</p>
