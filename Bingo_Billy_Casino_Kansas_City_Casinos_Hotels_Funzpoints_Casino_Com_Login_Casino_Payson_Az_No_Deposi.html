<p>CT Interactive, a global supplier and manufacturer of advanced online casino games, has expanded its existing partnership with Favbet. The two companies first collaborated in Romania when in 2021 the supplier extended its array of titles to the local brand.</p>
<p>Now, this partnership continues with Favbet.hr in 2023. Favbet is using this new content alliance to strengthen its capacity and the variety of its online gaming library in Croatia.</p>
<p>Commenting on the new opportunity, CT interactive Head of Business Development EMEA Milena Tsankarska said that her company was proud to be building upon its existing partnership with Favbet.</p>
<p>Tsankarska was joined by her colleague, Kiril Kirilov, CRM at CT Interactive, who said that the company is only getting started in Croatia and will continue to deliver outstanding titles in the market as time goes by.</p>
<p>She described the partnership as incredibly rewarding for both parties and expressed confidence in the long-term gains for both partners. Favbet Casino Manager Anna Amelina was similarly pleased with the opportunity to strengthen the brand’s game library in Croatia with CT Interactive. Amelina added:</p>
<p>"With its commitment to quality, CT Interactive has become a trusted and reliable gaming provider that always manages to surprise us and our customers with new and creative games."</p>
<p>CT Interactive has been a very busy supplier in the meantime. The company has defied regional bounds and has been rapidly expanding across new markets and scouting fresh opportunities. Most recently prior to its partnership with Favbet in Croatia, the company made a similar move with BetMexico.mx.</p>
<p>The fast-evolving Latin American market is definitely of interest to CT Interactive, which has not been shy about its ambitions in the region at a time of rapid legalization moves. Back in Europe, the company made a similar content move with Kajot in Slovakia, strengthening the supplier’s standing in central Europe.</p>
<p>Further out south, CT Interactive was able to similarly receive a recertification for its games in Italy. The supplier also signed a partnership with The Ear to further strengthen its presence in the Italian market.</p>
<p>CT Interactive brings a variety of games, including titles featuring free spins, multipliers, and jackpots. The company has more than 200 releases that range from dice slots to cascading slots, to classic slots. The library includes excellent titles such as Win Feast, Aztec Gold, Fruits &amp; Sweets, and many other relevant games.</p>
