    <h1>Draftkings Casino Michigan Royal Aces Casino Rhythm City Casino Whiskey Pete S Hotel Casino Foxwoods</h1>

<p>Dear Taylor,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. I have checked the T&amp;Cs and I found this:</p>
<p>„In the interests of fair gaming, there are limits on the maximum bet sizes you can place during the playthrough of any bonus including cashback offers. $10 is the maximum bet unless specifically stated otherwise. Betting above $10 during a bonus playthrough will result in any promotion winnings voided."</p>
<p>Our position is closely explained in Fair Gambling Codex https://casino.guru/fair-gambling-codex-for-casinos#max-bets: The max bet rule is, in fact, an industry standard, just as the fact that a casino has the right to seize the player's winnings from bonus play after breaking this rule. We prefer not to go against industry standards by penalizing casinos that use the maximum bet rule against players from time to time.</p>
<p>However, if you are sure you didn’t breach this rule, please forward me your game history together with a link to the specific bonus that you redeemed and played. My email address is kristina.s@casino.guru. Additionally, please specify how much money you deposited in order to activate this bonus.</p>
<p>If there is any relevant communication between you and the casino, please send it as well.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Kristina</p>
