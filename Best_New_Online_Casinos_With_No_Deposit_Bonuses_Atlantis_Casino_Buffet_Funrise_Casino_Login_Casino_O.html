    <h1>Best New Online Casinos With No Deposit Bonuses Atlantis Casino Buffet Funrise Casino Login Casino O</h1>

<p>Guru, Snatch isn't verifying my account, they are requesting documents that I just cannot obtain because they simply do not exist. The first step was fine, then I began to play at the casino and managed to amass a balance of almost 300 BRL. That's when the problems started. Initially, they asked me to log into my bank app to send personal and address information to prove that I was indeed connected to that bank account. I sent it, and now I just received a reply requesting the same information (email, Postal Code, address, etc) on a bank statement, something that doesn't exist in my bank unless I become a hacker, break into my bank's system, and change the settings of bank statements, in other words, something that's impossible to get.</p>
<p>It seems to me that Snatch has crossed all boundaries and is looking to create conflict with the players. So far, it's one of the worst casinos I've ever played at, packed with tactics that are against the player, and now, they've turned against the players themselves. This is my impression, I hope to be wrong and receive a satisfactory response to these transgressions.</p>
<p>It's impossible to get these documents they're asking for!!!</p>
