<p>Markor Technology has secured a new important milestone in its company development through the acquisition of an Ontario license</p>
<p>Thanks to the permit issued by the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario (AGCO), the provider of casino software aggregation platforms and tech solutions, will be able to expand into one of North America’s most promising markets.</p>
<p>Markor Technology Hails Success of Ontario Licensing</p>
<p>Markor Technology has been subjected to careful examination by the regulator to determine its suitability to hold a license and provide its advanced products in the Canadian province.</p>
<p>Moving forward, any relevant operators that are also registered and covered by an AGCO license will be able to tap into the extensive catalog of slots, table games, and live dealer options brought through the Markor’s aggregation platform.</p>
<p>Ontario’s existing and incoming brands will all be able to benefit from the extensive variety of options brought on by Markor Technology and its API. Apart from casino games, Markor Technology will also be able to provide a range of other gaming-related solutions.</p>
<p>Among them are the company’s dedicated multi-licensed PAM service and in-house and agile tools and technologies that will deliver insights in real time and help improve the overall experience for players.</p>
<p>These tech and solutions have been tested across a number of markets already, with the company bringing them to places like Gibraltar, the United Kingdom, Spain, and Malta, among others. Markor Technology already has plans for 2023 as well.</p>
<p>Strong Local Market with Significant Potential</p>
<p>The company is planning to launch in Sweden, Romania, and Portugal, as part of its roadmap this year. The company’s CEO, Melissa Summerfield, was particularly pleased with the developments and their significance for the company in the long term. She noted:</p>
<p>The acquisition of proper licensing and certification has always been at the very heart of Markor Technology’s long-term expansion plans, so we’re obviously delighted to have been granted approval from AGCO to offer both our content aggregation platform and PAM services to all locally-licensed casino operators in Ontario. Markor Technology CEO Melissa Summerfield</p>
<p>She hailed the importance of the license and said that it would allow Markor Technology to further expand its reach with new partners and connect with local audiences all across the regulated market in Ontario, and from there on in, use this license as a springboard for further successes in the region.</p>
