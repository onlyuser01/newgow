    <h1>Best Casino Bonus River City Casino Hotel St Louis Vivaro Casino Treasure Island Casino In Minnesota</h1>

<p>LVBET.COM ROBBED ME OF $10,000 BEWARE ALL AND DO NOT USE THIS PLATFORM! (THIS IS A REAL REVIEW).</p>
<p>I am from Toronto, Canada.</p>
<p>Joined LVBET.COM about 3 weeks ago. I deposited first few times and lost, then after another deposit my deposits total was then at $8000.</p>
<p>I then got a lucky win from a game and sports balance was $10,000 putting me a profit of $2000, since I had deposited 8k over a space of around a week.</p>
<p>Here comes the nightmare now, well maybe not as yet because sportsbooks asking documents is normal procedure.</p>
<p>I provided, proof of bank cards, proof of id, also latest available 3 months bank statements.</p>
<p>To then be asked for a bank statement that was not even cycled because the month had not finished. I went to bank to let them know and they printed off a statement month that had not even finished, stamped the statement for me and I sent it to the lv reps for them to tell me they do not accept copied documents even though online banking did not have access to what they requested and it’s a stamped bank document.</p>
<p>Fast foreward to them making me wait for statement to cycle to online banking about two weeks later while they hold</p>
<p>My 10k.</p>
<p>Also to add, they had requested me sent the URL of the page where I print statements from, page showing personal details and just ridiculous request I’ve never seen before.</p>
<p>After providing all they’ve asked and thinking my $10,000 would finally be on its way I am now being asked for tax return bill and corporate information.</p>
<p>Even though I’ve supplied them</p>
<p>With my corporate account statements and articles of incorporation.</p>
<p>MY CORPORATE ACCOUNT AND COMPANY HAS NEVER DEPOSITED ON THE LVBET PLATFORM AND THEY ARE TRYING TO STEAL MY MONEY. SOMEONE PLEASE HELP ME.</p>
<p>I HAVE NEVER HAD A SPORTSBOOK DELIBERATELY STEAL MY MONEY, STAY AWAY ALL!!!</p>
<p>My personal bank account is only one that has deposited and I gave them standard information usually asked for and more only to have excuses made and tax returns being requested over $8000 deposits and being ahead $2000 I am receiving issues.</p>
<p>I will be contacting the board and leaving reviews everywhere possible.</p>
<p>LVBET.COM IS A SCAM!</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>I EVEN ASKED THEM TO PERMANENTLY CLOSE MY ACCOUNT WHEN I SEEN THEY WERE DELAYING MY FUNDS AND REQUESTING NOT NORMAL</p>
<p>THINGS.</p>
<p>THEY THEN CLOSED ACCOUNT FOR ME AND SAID THEYD SEND ME MY MONEY ONCE THEY GET LATEST STATEMENT. I HAD TO WAIT FOR A CYCLED STATEMENT THAT CAME IN YESTERDAY TO ONLY HEAR WE NEED YOUR TAX RETURNS NOW FOR CORPORATE ACCOUNT.</p>
<p>Keep in mind corp has never deposited and account has funds clearly moving through it which statements show and company making consistent payments.</p>
<p>With only $8000 deposited this is the nightmare I am going through. Just imagine they would have kept taking more if I was to continue losing.</p>
<p>I got lucky on my last $1000 at that moment and won back my money for a $2000 profit. Only to have this website steal my funds that is rightfully mine.</p>
<p>PLEASE SOMEONE HELP ME!</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Now my account is closed permanently because I requested them to do this and was told funds would be sent after I send the statement in only for them to lie to me.</p>
<p>My funds are being withheld in a very evil</p>
<p>Manner now, going to contact the board next.</p>
<p>PLEASE I SOMEONE HELP ME.</p>
<p>GOD BLESS</p>
