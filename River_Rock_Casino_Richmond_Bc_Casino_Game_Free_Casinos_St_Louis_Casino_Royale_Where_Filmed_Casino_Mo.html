<p>Kambi Group has signed a partnership with the leading daily fantasy sports operator in Brazil. The partnership between the leading sportsbook technology supplier and Rei do Pitaco comes at a time when sports betting is expanding rapidly across Latin America, and interest in both traditional and fantasy sports is growing at a strong pace.</p>
<p>The collaboration is signed as a multi-year partnership that will let Rei do Pitaco fully benefit from Kambi’s technology and services and allow the company to launch a real money sportsbook in Brazil.</p>
<p>The country has hit several snags in recent months while attempting to legalize sports gambling, but stakeholders are confident enough that Brazil will soon become the largest regulated sports betting market in the region, and possibly the world.</p>
<p>While President Jair Bolsonaro failed to sign sports betting regulations last week, lawmakers feel confident sports betting is coming. Rei de Pitaco is also in a very good position to benefit from the incoming legalization as its app has been downloaded more than 3.4m times since it launched in 2019.</p>
<p>Kambi will be able to leverage its full technology suite and bring powerful solutions and differentiation tools to ensure the best possible experience by leveraging the brand’s ample database of users. The partnership was naturally welcomed by Kambi CEO and Co-founder Kristian Nylén who hailed the opportunity and said that Brazil had the potential to become the world’s largest regulated sports betting market.</p>
<p>He further said that Rei do Pitaco was definitely a company that had a chance of becoming a leader in the regulated sports betting market as well. Nylén added that the fact that the brand chose Kambi to provide it with sportsbook technology only served as proof of Kambi’s similarly leading position in the global market and Latin America in particular.</p>
<p>Rei do Pitaco CEO and Co-Founder Mateus Dantas was similarly pleased with the partnership and said that bringing Kambi as a sports betting partner was precisely what the company needed to pursue a successful launch in the regulated sector.</p>
<p>"Through this new operation, we are confident of delivering a market-leadingonline sportsbook to our fast-growing customer database which will have access to an excellent and safe user experience on our platform," Dantas said.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Kambi signed a partnership with LMG Gaming to help the company get started with sports betting through its ApuestaPR sports betting brand in Puerto Rico.</p>
