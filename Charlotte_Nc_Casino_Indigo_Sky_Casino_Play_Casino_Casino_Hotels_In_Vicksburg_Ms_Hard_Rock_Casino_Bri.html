<p>The supplier continues to focus on the lucrative iGaming market in the Netherlands, launching with a new operator</p>
<p>Bingoal, a brand with a strong local presence and appeal to Dutch players, will deliver games by Booming Games, and strengthen its library of games in the country. Booming Games has a ton of excellent spot-on games for the operator’s players.</p>
<p>Booming Games Offering a Content Boost to Bingoal</p>
<p>Among the games that are now going to be featured by Bingoal are such top-of-the-range choices by Booming as King Cobra, TNT Bonanza, Treasure Vault, Legendary Diamonds, Mighty Gorilla, Cash Pig, Go Bananza, and so many others.</p>
<p>Booming Games prides itself on providing uniquely-themed games that focus on market innovation and gamification. The titles are developed with a big emphasis on gamification and strengthening the rapport between the developer its partner operators, and their players.</p>
<p>Booming Games CCO Frederik Niehusen said that the company was very happy to have partnered with Bingoal. He argued that the operator had significant experience in both the offline and online landscapes and that the partnership with Booming will elevate the brand’s stature in the Netherlands and beyond.</p>
<p>Bingoal casino product manager Dany Salmon was similarly pleased with the opportunity and argued that Booming provides a range of highly-entertaining games that are going to strike home with the casino’s own players, adding:</p>
<p>We are excited to announce that these entertaining games will now be available in our casino lobby, and we are truly pleased to have established this partnership. Bingoal casino product manager Dany Salmon</p>
<p>Navigating the Lucrative and Demanding Market in the Netherlands</p>
<p>Bingoal has been committed to strengthening its presence in the Netherlands despite some regulatory headwinds the brand has faced of late. The company was fined €400,000 ($430,000) by the Dutch Gaming Authority over the purported advertisement of games of chance to young people.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Bingoal has been strengthening its casino content offering by featuring games by some of the industry’s top suppliers. Among those is Playson which signed a deal with the brand to provide it with its own games.</p>
