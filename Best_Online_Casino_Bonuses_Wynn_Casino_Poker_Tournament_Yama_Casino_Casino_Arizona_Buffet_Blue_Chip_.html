<p>Theme, Storyline, and Graphics: Get Ready to Fly a Fighter Jet!</p>
<p>Nucleus Gaming has chosen the military fighter theme for this title released at the end of 2022, giving players the opportunity to explore a cockpit and learn how to fly a jet. The main storyline is a celebratory one that places the courage of sky protectors at the center. The militaries who spend their days controlling hostile aircraft and firing missiles are the main characters. They are searching for equally brave colleagues who want to join them in doing this honorable service. The more fearless players prove to be, the more rewards will be coming their way.</p>
<p>The fighter jet along with several pilots, the ammunition they use, the card royal dog tags, gloves, aviator sunglasses, helmets, and American freedom-symbolizing eagles are the main elements that make up the theme. The background is represented by a mesmerizing sunset seen from a military boat, cleverly displaying the jets and the flying planes up in the clear blue sky.</p>
<p>The wings of victory in the slot are symbolized by the fighting jet along with the pilots on their way to bring peace to the land beneath them. Lots of battles still need to be fought and won prior to establishing peace. One of these battles may completely destroy the enemy, and it will be carried right on the large grid packed with 100 fixed paylines. As the aircraft is seen flying around during the sunset, the skilled pilots are busy making the “birds” they are responsible for turn into victorious weapons against all attempts to conquer the land beneath them and the people living there.</p>
<p>Wings of Victory: Game Symbols and Payouts</p>
<p>Players are given the chance to opt for a rich plethora of betting options with minimum bets starting at 0.25 credits and going as high as 100 credits. The 5×4 grid lets players form winning combinations with three, four, or five matching symbols from left to right.</p>
<p>The highest win per line will be paid to players while coinciding wins on separate paylines are combined. The regular symbols in the game are represented by low-paying poker cards that pay between 0.16x and 0.32x for five-of-a-kind and mid-paying symbols ranging from glasses (0.48x for five symbols), gloves (0,48x for five symbols ), the American flag and eagle symbol (0.60x for five-of-a-kind), and a pilot (1x for five symbols). The high-paying symbols are represented by the male and female pilots that pay 4x and 2x respectively for five identical symbols landing on a winning line.</p>
<p>The game also features several special symbols, including a Wild which is represented by the fighting aircraft and which can only land on the three reels at the middle of the grid, and the Scratters represented by the missiles which trigger a bonus game.</p>
<p>Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>Wings of Victory lacks the dynamic animations part of other titles released by the studio. Nonetheless, its visual presence is still pleasant to the eye and the intricately drawn symbols and game elements perfectly match the theme. The animations are seen when the symbols that form winning combinations bounce in place, causing fireworks to go off in the background. The background music and sound effects also nicely complement the military jet/battle theme.</p>
<p>Wings of Victory Gameplay</p>
<p>The gameplay is smooth and all game controls, settings, paytable, and rules can be accessed by clicking the “i” (information) tab to the left of the grid. Choosing a bet amount is done by clicking the dedicated plus and minus signs. Players can also mute and unmute the background music, enable or disable the sound effects and Turbo mode and choose the number of automated spins and their cost. The play tab is located to the right.</p>
<p>Wings of Victory: Wilds, Free Spins &amp; Buy Feature</p>
<p>One of the main special features in the game is represented by the Wilds which can replace all the other symbols with the exception of the Scatter. When popping on the second, third, or fourth reels, the Wilds contribute to a winning combination while also turning into a Sticky Wild for the following two spins.</p>
<p>To trigger the Free Spins round, players must land three, four, or five matching Scatters to be granted 10, 15, or 20 Free Spins. During the Free Spins game, all Wild symbols that have helped players trigger wins will also turn sticky for the remainder of the round and not only for the following two spins.</p>
<p>Players eager to jump into the action can purchase instant access to the Free Spins round.</p>
<p>Final Thoughts</p>
<p>With its interesting military jet fighter theme, excellent design elements and background music, satisfying special features for higher payouts, and a large selection of betting options, Wings of Victory is another Nucleus Gaming video slot that is prone to keep most players at the edge of their seats, fully immersed in the action on the reels. No matter if you are a fan of the genre or not, you won’t regret giving this title a try.</p>
