<p>The post was submitted around 8 am ET without any context or evidence, yet Levis' odds shifted from +4000 to roughly +400 at many major sportsbooks within an hour</p>
<p>An anonymous Reddit user managed to influence the NFL Draft markets with a single post, claiming that Kentucky quarterback Will Levis had inside knowledge that he was going to be selected by the Carolina Panthers with the first pick in the 2023 NFL Draft.</p>
<p>Will Levis Could be Selected First Overall by Carolina Panthers</p>
<p>A new Reddit account under the name “SaleAgreeable2834” claimed that Will Levis, the quarterback for Kentucky, was telling his friends and family that he would be selected first overall by the Carolina Panthers. The post went viral, and within hours, the odds of Levis being the first overall pick rose dramatically on betting sites.</p>
<p>Levis has remained relatively quiet throughout the draft process, but he spoke out against the Reddit post during an NFL service project in Kansas City.</p>
<p>Throughout the draft buildup, Will Levis has been considered as the third or fourth-best quarterback prospect. The pre-draft process is always full of smokescreens, and it is hard to tell what is true and what is not. However, Levis has become one of the more divisive prospects in the draft, with some analysts predicting that he could go as high as second overall to the Houston Texans or a team trading with them.</p>
<p>Levis has all the physical tools that scouts look for in a quarterback, including size, arm strength, athleticism, and experience. However, his college stats are not as impressive as those of other top prospects, with a 65.4% completion percentage, 2,406 passing yards, 19 touchdowns, and 10 interceptions in 11 games as a senior, without any All-SEC honors or major awards.</p>
<p>Betting Activity on Will Levis Surges After Viral Reddit Post</p>
<p>Despite his mixed track record, Levis has piqued the interest of NFL teams due to his potential. He showed off his skills during his pro day, and some experts believe that he could be a diamond in the rough for the right team.</p>
<p>In the hours after the Reddit post, DraftKings, Caesars, and FanDuel all reported significant upticks in the number of bets received on Levis to be the first prospect off the board.</p>
<p>However, major sportsbooks do not agree on Levis’ odds to be the first pick in the draft. For example, BetMGM, which did not even have Levis as one of the three favorites to go first overall the morning of the Reddit reveal, has him as the standalone second-most likely option.</p>
<p>Despite the sudden movement of odds and betting activity, it remains to be seen whether Levis will be selected first overall in the 2023 NFL Draft.</p>
