    <h1>High 5 Casino Casinos In San Antonio Texas Casinos In Branson Mo New Casino In Las Vegas Downstream</h1>

<p>If you mean verification as in my identity verification, no. That process was completed back in March of this year because it was required in order to be eligible to process withdrawals.</p>
<p>note : That's how all this started. I used one of their welcome bonus offers and once I met the playthrough requirements I requested a withdrawal of the remaining winnings.</p>
<p>All documents for verification were verified and the initial playthrough requirements were also completed.</p>
<p>I contacted support like the instructions suggested when verification was completed and I was told I'd recieve the withdrawal in 7-10 days. After 2 weeks, I contacted support again for a status update on when I can expect to receive it and thats when I was informed that in order to recieve it in 7-10 days, I'd need to make a deposit. Otherwise, I'd still recieve the withdrawal but would take 60-90 days. So I waited some more.</p>
<p>note : Keep in mind after each time I contacted support, I confirmed with them that all requirements were completed to process the withdrawal. Each time it was agreed and confirmed. Until the next time I had to contact support, then that representative would add some other stipulation to the requirements.</p>
<p>Come July 2022, and still not having received the withdrawal amount I requested, I contacted support for a 3rd time who then told me something that completely discredits what I was told by both the first and second support representative. The third representative advised me that to be eligible for the withdrawal to be processed, I was appatently required to make a minimum deposit of $30.</p>
<p>Come August, I had enough to make this now new requirement to process the withdrawal I started in March, so I deposited $30 plus an extra $5 just incase, so $35 total. Immediately contacted support again to update them that I again completed all requirements needed and wanted to finish processing the withdrawal of my previous winnings.</p>
<p>The moment the representative began trying to explain yet again some other stipulations that were needed is when I decided I had enough of getting the run around and knew it was going to be a never-ending back and forth to get my winnings. That is when I requested a refund of my deposit.</p>
<p>All in all, I've been waiting for the refund since the same day I deposited it; August 29th. Last contact I had with the casino was last week. Where I was told they had supposedly processed the refund a week prior and to contact my cardholder the refund would be processed onto and to contact silver edge support again after 24 hours.</p>
<p>I contacted my cardholder and they have not recieved anything or see anything from silveredge for the amount im to be refunded. I also haven't had any contact from Silveredge since then.</p>
