<p>Scientific Games Corporation has just launched its new Symphony lottery-systems technology in Germany with Lotto Baden-Württemberg.</p>
<p>Scientific Games’ Symphony System Debuts in Germany</p>
<p>Germany’s Lotto Baden-Württemberg is now able to enjoy Scientific Games’ next-generation technology Symphony lottery-systems. The new gaming solution powers Lotto Baden-Württemberg as well as all its entire network of 3,000 licensed retail shops in Stuttgart, southwest Germany.</p>
<p>Lotto Baden-Württemberg is part of Germany’s 16 state lotteries and is the third-biggest in the country, reaching €1 billion in annual revenue. However, Scientific Games is a supplier for all 16 German lotteries.</p>
<p>Lotto Baden-Württemberg’s full range of lottery resources such as Lotto 6aus49, EuroJackpot, GlücksSpirale, KENO, Oddset sports betting and other instant games are currently all supported by Scientific Games’ technology.</p>
<p>For Georg Wacker, Managing Director of Lotto Baden-Württemberg, being the first company to launch the latest-generation Symphony platform means “leading the way for other lotteries in the industry in understanding the importance of third-party systems technology and integration capabilities for future growth.”</p>
<p>The Las Vegas-based gambling products provider created Symphony with a completely independent architecture and has included both existing hardware and third-party systems in any product range.</p>
<p>As a result, the system permits to increase the lottery’s flexibility to changing consumers and retailers’ needs. It is designed upon the modular architecture and now is used by other established gaming companies, including Danske Spil and Norsk Tipping.</p>
<p>“Lotto Baden-Württemberg has demonstrated its trust in Scientific Games’ cloud-based, omnichannel technology and our sustainable growth expertise,” stated Pat McHugh, Lottery Group Chief Executive for Scientific Games.</p>
<p>Lotto Baden-Württemberg Continuously Improving</p>
<p>Scientific Games and state-owned Lotto Baden-Württemberg have worked together since 1992. The American company is providing its technology through a series of established legacy companies and supplies tech-enabled devices and assistance from Vienna, Austria, where its lottery technology center is located.</p>
<p>Commenting on the announcement, Matthias Müller, VP Strategic Sales &amp; Marketing, International Lottery Accounts for Scientific Games said Symphony fits perfectly the Lottery’s strategic plan “to shorten time to market for new products and services.”</p>
<p>Announced in January, the system integration project was developed all year long by both companies.</p>
<p>Several other projects have been carried out by Scientific Games in 2020 such as the participation in the “Gift Responsibly. Lottery Tickets Aren’t Child’s Play” campaign, aimed at educating people of the risks about children participating in lotteries during the holiday season.</p>
<p>Another initiative included the partnership with Italian gambling group SISAL SPA. Since November, the company has been able to operate on the Moroccan market thanks to SISAL SPA’s subsidiary in the country.</p>
