<p>Casino Guru, the biggest casino database in the world, has teamed up with the British safer gambling charity Gordon Moody. The two parties will join forces, just as suggested by GambleAware, to deliver a new interactive safer gambling course.</p>
<p>Casino Guru and Gordon Moody Teamed Up for a New Course</p>
<p>Casino Guru and Gordon Moody will leverage their expertise to create a new program that will promote safer gambling by familiarizing people with the benefits of betting responsibly. The best part about the program is that it would be completely free, which would allow it to reach more people.</p>
<p>The course covers everything that should be known about safer gambling. It talks about the basics, as well as the advanced stuff, such as the usage of AI for spotting irregular gambling patterns that often signpost problem gambling. The new course is Casino Guru and Gordon Moody’s way of delivering valuable knowledge to customers and operators alike.</p>
<p>The course teaches the value of responsible gambling and how it benefits sustainability. As such, it is targeted toward industry professionals but also contains valuable information that customers and industry enthusiasts might be interested to know.</p>
<p>Gambling operators can further expand the information contained in the free course and use Gordon Moody’s learning platforms to meet the demands of developing market segments.</p>
<p>The new course is a part of Casino Guru’s Casino Guru Academy, the casino database’s in-house program for promoting a better understanding of gambling, the gambling industry and responsible wagering. The new course is notably the third one Casino Guru has worked on. Previously, the company released two other courses, one dedicated to customer support and one concerning casino bonuses.</p>
<p>United Against Problem Gambling and Harm</p>
<p>This is not the first safer gambling initiative that the involved parties have undertaken. Gordon Moody recently released its own E-Learning platform and Virtual Classroom. Casino Guru, on the other hand, is currently working on a Global Self-exclusion Initiative, attesting to its commitment to safer gambling.</p>
<p>The two companies’ collaboration reflects GambleAware’s call for unity from earlier this year when the charity proposed that industry veterans should join their forces in the battle against gambling harm.</p>
<p>Casino Guru’s safer and sustainable gambling lead, Simon Vincze, spoke about the new course. He said that his team is delighted to join forces with Gordon Moody, a charity with decades of experience in the sector. Vincze reaffirmed his company’s intention of providing customers and operators alike with content of value.</p>
<p>All of our Academy courses are created with the intention of giving our participants the maximum possible value within a limited time frame. Simon Vincze, safer and sustainable gambling lead, Casino Guru</p>
<p>In October, Casino Guru promised to award the most responsible companies in the sector.</p>
