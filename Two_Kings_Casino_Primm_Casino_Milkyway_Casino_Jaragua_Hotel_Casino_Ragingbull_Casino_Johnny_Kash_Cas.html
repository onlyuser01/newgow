    <h1>Two Kings Casino Primm Casino Milkyway Casino Jaragua Hotel Casino Ragingbull Casino Johnny Kash Cas</h1>

<p>Hello everybody!</p>
<p>I made the switch to Johnnykash Casino fairly recently and since doing so, I have deposited roughly $20,000 (honest) into the casino, and one things I have noticed apart from the fact that having a nice win seems to be a complete myth at this casino (I pushed through $1000 deposit two weeks ago and literally only got one set of free games, and that gave me a total free games winning of $2.40) then the zero balance hit shortly after. That aside, the customer service wuality reeeeaaalllly deteriorates the more loyal you are. The last 5-6 times I have attempted to resolve a casino issue that gladly accepts my deposit, then very shortly after (a few spins) glitches me out of being logged in, and then does not load the casino page or allow me to log back in for a few hours, sometimes until the following day. Support connects normally withing 5 minutes but then they proceed to tell you they will be with you in a few minutes as the coronavirus is causing delays, over and over again, the longest I've waited after been told that "I will be with you in a few minutes" is 1 Hour 45 minutes before I disconnected the chat due to generic, automated responses and of course the time wasted already! (I have screenshot proof of all the issues, support wait times, and dodgey sounding reasons to why the casino is glitching)...</p>
<p>I do think 'shame on me' for continuing to deposit with this casino after all the problems and money + time wasted that has gone on, but if you have the gambling bug in your brain, you will also know the feeling that 'it's going to pay out soon' even though I'm near 100% confident JohnnyKash Casino never will. I just want to warn everyone to be careful and perhaps don't give you money to this greedy casino, take it from me please, I had to reach the 2nd top tier in their VIP casino to realise that being 2nd top tier in this casino does not mean a thing. Please listen, trust me, and stay away from this casino.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Daniel</p>
