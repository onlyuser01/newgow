<p>US-based sports betting operator William Hill US is set to bring betting on horse racing in Florida, the operator’s first activity in the market in its 85-year history. The bookmaker will open a new land-based facility at Casino Miami</p>
<p>Florida to Welcome the Venue This Year</p>
<p>Although the launch of the race book is subject to regulatory approval, the new facility is expected to open before the end of the current year. The venue will boast 10 screens for fans to follow events together with 30ft video wall, high-top tables and 30 race carrells.</p>
<p>Joe Asher, CEO of William Hill US said: “Casino Miami is a great location with a modern space where we have created a first-class experience for all racing fans in the area. We look forward to working with Phil Ruffin and his team to enable our customers to bet on races from across the country.</p>
<p>Overview of the Facility</p>
<p>Players will be offered pari-mutuel simulcast betting and will be able to watch and wage on major Thoroughbred, Harness, and Greyhound tracks as well as Jai Alai from around the country. It is still unclear what kind of bonus promotions will be available and if the bet app will be offered in 2020.</p>
<p>Ruffin, owner of Casino Miami said: “William Hill has unparalleled expertise and a rich history in racing. The company has led the industry for decades and together we will bring state-of-the-art technology and innovation to Casino Miami. This new race book will provide us with an incredible amenity for guests and will place us at the forefront of the forthcoming Florida sports betting business.”</p>
<p>Legalising Sports Betting on Track</p>
<p>Although it will only be possible to take part in limited betting activities, the opening will give the operator an advantage should sports betting be legalised. Florida is already making steps towards legalising the sports betting with three bills filed in the state legislature last week. Some of the highlights around the bills are that sports betting would be done via the lottery and additional licensees authorised by the lottery with online betting also being permitted. Operators will be charged a $100,000 license fee a will pay a 15% tax on their revenue.</p>
<p>In November 2018, Florida citizens decided by a vote that any law giving green light to sports betting in the state would also be subject to a referendum by citizens. Should any of the new bills pass, voters might give their “yes” or “no” at the November 2020 ballot.</p>
<p>Recently, the NBA announced a sports betting partnership with William Hill under which the operator acquired the right to use official betting data and branding of the league across its mobile apps and in its sports books on the territory of the United States.</p>
