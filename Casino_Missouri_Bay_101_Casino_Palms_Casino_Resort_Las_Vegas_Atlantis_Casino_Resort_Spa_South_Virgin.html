    <h1>Casino Missouri Bay 101 Casino Palms Casino Resort Las Vegas Atlantis Casino Resort Spa South Virgin</h1>

<p>The brand, which is a go-to provider of live casino games, is now making its products available with a local behemoth in the face of Versailles Casino. This will allow the operator to further dig its heel into the market but also ensure that Stakelogic Live’s products are available to more players, becoming recognizable and trusted products.</p>
<p>Versailles Casino and Stakelogic Form Live Casino Alliance</p>
<p>Versailles Casino and Stakelogic Live are confident that they will be able to intrigue local players, bringing them fresh live casino opportunities, including in-demand games such as Auto Roulette and Auto Roulette Classic which will enliven the casino’s live casino lobby and enhance the quality and variety of the experience. Commenting on this partnership, Versailles Casino CEO Ludovic Lefevre said:</p>
<p>Auto Roulette is an absolute must for any operator looking to provide the live dealer experience that players are seeking. It’s a classic table game and one that we have taken to the next level thanks to the striking backdrop our games are set against. Versailles Casino CEO Ludovic Lefevre</p>
<p>Dzehs has assured that Stakelogic Live has been able to shape itself as one of the de facto leaders in the live casino vertical in Europe and Beyond and the new partnership with Versailles Casino was a testament to this continued success.</p>
<p>Versailles Casino is similarly confident that the addition of these games will allow the company to consolidate its presence in the market and the highly competitive live casino vertical, which is bringing fresh challenges for operators to keep up.</p>
<p>Stakelogic Live has the infrastructure to support some excellent products and bring them to market. The company operates out of its enhanced studio in Malta and makes sure to bring VIP experiences to players of all backgrounds, especially the operators that feature the company’s products.</p>
<p>Versailles Casino CEO Ludovic Lefevre was similarly pleased to welcome players to have a go at the new live casino products provided by Stakelogic’s dedicated live arm. The supplier, Lefevre said, was setting up the standards for other developers to follow.</p>
<p>The deal is no doubt a great step forward for the casino in the sector. Lefevre said that he is now looking forward to the casino’s players having a sit-down and playing the newly added Auto-Roulette and Auto Roulette Classic.</p>
