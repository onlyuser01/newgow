<p>The 2023 NASCAR Cup Series is coming to Vegas this weekend. Las Vegas Motor Speedway is where the 2023 South Point 400 will take place on Sunday, October 15. This is going to be the first of the three Round of 8 NASCAR races</p>
<p>Even though he didn’t make it to the last 8, A. J. Allmendinger was the one who won last week’s race. William Byron finished just behind him, the result of which is that the Hendrick Motorsports driver is now sitting top of the NASCAR Drivers’ Championship.</p>
<p>However, it’s a big question of how long he will stay there as all the other drivers that made it to the Round of 8 have a chance to leapfrog him. And they all seem super-motivated to do so. This explains why the 2023 South Point 400 odds are so close, as you’ll see for yourself in the next segment.</p>

<p>2023 South Point 400 Favorites</p>
<p>There are four drivers with NASCAR odds that are shorter than +1000. Those are, namely, Kyle Larson, William Byron, Denny Hamlin, Tyler Reddick, and Martin Truex Jr. Only two of them – Hamlin and Truex Jr. – have already won this race in the past.</p>
<p>Last season’s winner of the South Point 400 was Joey Logano, but his odds for the 2023 event aren’t too great. In fact, he’s priced at +3000, which makes him one of the underdogs.</p>
<p>If you’re wondering why Kyle Larson is the No.1 South Point 400 favorite, one of the reasons is that he really needs to up his game ASAP. His three last finishes are 31st, 15th, and 13th place, which just isn’t good enough for a driver of his talent.</p>
<p>Another driver who really needs to improve his stats ASAP is Truex Jr. The winner of the South Point 400 four years ago hasn’t had a top-10 finish since the start of the 2023 NASCAR Playoffs. Further, Truex Jr. is without a win since mid-July.</p>
<p>Our 2023 South Point 400 Prediction</p>
<p>Who’s going to win the 2023 South Point 400 NASCAR race on October 14? We think anything can happen on Sunday, but if we had to pick one driver, it would be William Byron. This guy’s been fantastic since the start of the Playoffs, finishing on the podium in each of the last three events. Further, he only finished once outside the top 10 in the last eight races.</p>
<p>Byron doesn’t have any great memories from driving in Vegas, with his best-ever finish at South Point 400 being the No. 7 place in 2019. However, we do believe it’s time for him to do better.</p>
<p>Pick: William Byron to win the 2023 South Point 400</p>
