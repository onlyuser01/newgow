    <h1>Century Casino Central City Paragon Casino Cinema Casino In Philly Best Casino In Washington St Kitt</h1>

<p>I opened an app from the Google play store (PlinCo Destiny), and it took me to a site to put in my deposit to play the game. After doing same, no plinko variant was available. I since discovered the app was serving as a portal to this casino. I opened the chat portal to request my balance/or deposit back as i was fraudulently lead to their site/deposit. The casino has a min 100 wd and would neiither</p>
<p>refund the deposit or the minimal balance (whichever was less). the casino refuses to give me my deposit back and has closed my account, keeping the full deposit/balance so I can't even tell you what the balance was. I have screen captures of the chat and video of the Plinco App opening to their site. I also emailed the video to their support email. It's not letting me attatch. So do email me and I'll send them that way.</p>
