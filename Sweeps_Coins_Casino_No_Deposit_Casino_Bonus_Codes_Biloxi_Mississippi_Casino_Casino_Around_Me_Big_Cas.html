<p>The European Casino Association (ECA) and Clarion Gaming have decided to join efforts and organize the ECA/Clarion/ICE Symposium at Les Ambassadeurs Casino on July 13. The event will reunite an important number of operators and developers from the gaming industry. The main topic of discussion will focus on the attempt to hit the refresh button on Europe’s gaming industry which was severely affected by Covid-19 in the past two years. The prestigious ICE event in 2023 is expected to go back to the standard February starting date, but more talks and preparation are needed in the meanwhile. The confirmation of the July symposium is an important milestone in the process.</p>
<p>The Symposium’s Agenda Will Be Created In Real-Time</p>
<p>The idea behind the event was born from a series of previous talks and meetings during the ECA leadership event and the Dealer Championship held in May which brought together important board members during a relaxed breakfast meeting. These talks concluded the imperative need to match the industry’s approach for ICE 2023 with the ideas expressed by the ECA leadership team.</p>
<p>According to Clarion Gaming’s managing director Stuart Hunter, the Mayfair symposium will have a dynamic agenda that will be created in real-time during the morning meeting. The meeting will be held in an open space and allow participants to personally set their own talking points in a natural and honest manner. The burning discussion topics will focus on the needs, weaknesses, and opportunities that can be shared among participants. The symposium will also host a panel session at the end of which individual groups will be encouraged to initiate their own talks.</p>
<p>Clarion Gaming Is Looking for More Inspiration</p>
<p>At the end of the event, the results of the talks are expected to help reshape the way the ICE event in London will look in the upcoming year in terms of content, strategies, customer experiences, and networking. Clarion Gaming is determined to keep offering the most beloved exhibitions in the industry, reuniting highly influential attendees and setting the ground for the assembly of the global gaming community. As one of its highest anticipated events, ICE will draw all eyes to it. T</p>
<p>his is why the July symposium will be used as a way of preparing for the return of the biggest brick-and-mortar developers to the show floor in London in 2023. ECA’s chairman Per Jaldung reinforced the idea that the symposium will guarantee that Clarion Gaming’s vision will be perfectly aligned with the industry’s vision regarding the London event. The ECA represents domestic gaming associations and individuals that operate licensed brick-and-mortar casinos in Europe. This year, the ICE London event had its original date moved to April because of an outbreak caused by the Omicron variant.</p>
