    <h1>Instant Withdrawal Casinos Casino Games Slots Free Shreveport Hotels And Casinos The Brooks Casino G</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m very sorry to hear about your negative experience. I have checked terms and conditions, and this is what I found https://www.mbitcasino.com/terms-and-conditions:</p>
<p>„ Each player can create only one personal user account. Creating multiple user accounts will lead to termination of the accounts. All betting accounts you try to open may be blocked or closed and any bets may be voided. Depending on the severity of the case mBit Casino holds the right to withhold or take any funds deposited to pay for damages and/or the prevention of future misconduct."</p>
<p>„ If you notice that you have more than one registered Member Account you must notify us immediately. Failure to do so may lead to your Member account being blocked for access."</p>
<p>„The Casino has zero tolerance to advantage play. Any player who will try to gain advantage of casino welcome offers or other promotions agrees that Company reserves the right to void bonuses and any winnings from such bonuses, for the reasons of:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>use of stolen cards;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>chargebacks;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>creating more than one account in order to get advantage from casino promotions;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>providing incorrect registration data;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>any other actions which may damage the Casino."</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We will contact the casino and ask for supporting evidence, but, before we do so, could you please advise if to the best of your knowledge, there’s a possibility that someone else from your family members or neighbors has opened an account from the same IP address or device as yours? Have you redeemed any promotional offers in the past? If there’s any relevant communication, please forward it to petronela.k@casino.guru. I hope we will be able to help you to resolve this issue as soon as possible. Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
