<p>Sticky Bees review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Sticky Bees is a bee-themed slot game from Pragmatic Play.</p>
<p>The slot invites players into the middle of a forest, with the titular bees making an appearance as part of the game’s bonus features.</p>
<p>Sensational win in the Free Spins round</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play has kept things basic with the design of the Sticky Bees slot. The reels are placed in the middle of a forest, with some small animations in the background helping to bring it to life.</p>
<p>The bees themselves are not a huge part of the game, only making an appearance in the bonus features. This is in contrast to a slot like Relax Gaming’s Beellionaire Dream Drop, where the bees are central to the base game action.</p>
<p>While the slot doesn’t come across as particularly original and does nothing new with a well-established genre, it is sharply rendered and has plenty of colour to help bring it to life on both mobile and desktop.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Sticky Bees is a cluster-pay slot game that uses a 7x7 grid. Winning clusters are secured when players land five or more symbols clustered anywhere on the grid.</p>
<p>Similar to other cluster-pay slots, Sticky Bees uses a Tumble sequence mechanic. Whenever winning clusters are formed, the symbols involved are removed from the grid. When this happens, new symbols fall from above. This continues to happen if more clusters are formed.</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>On each spin in the Sticky Bees slot, between 12 and 19 positions will be marked. If a golden bee symbol, which acts as a Super Wild, lands in these positions, the position becomes active. When another symbol lands in these in the subsequent tumble, it will become Wild. Super Wild positions can also add six additional Wilds to random positions on the reels.</p>
<p>Marked spaces are randomly selected for every spin</p>
<p>The other bonus in the game is the Sticky Bees Free Spins round. This is triggered when players land four or more Scatters. There are seven spins awarded, with an additional spin for each extra Scatter past the fourth. During the round, up to three Super Wilds are guaranteed to land. To make things even better, any activated positions remain active on the grid until the end of the spins.</p>
<p>Bee Reel is active throughout the Free Spins round</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>Sticky Bees uses a maths model we have seen in Pragmatic Play slots in the past. The maximum win here is 10,000x the player’s stake, with the RTP being 96.06%. This puts it around the industry average. Pragmatic has also given Sticky Bees a 5/5 volatility rating, making it a highly volatile slot that suits our slot strategy guide.</p>
<p>Full paytable for the Sticky Bees slot machine</p>
<p>The stake can be adjusted between each spin using the +/- buttons on either side of the spin button. The minimum stake in the game is $0.20, and the maximum is $100, giving this a healthy betting range.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Sticky Bees may be the most creative slot visually, but it makes up for this with some solid gameplay and enjoyable bonus features. You can trigger some nice winning sequences in the Free Spins round, especially once the grid starts filling with Super Wilds. A maximum win of 10,000x your stake also adds some extra honey to this pot, making it a thoroughly enjoyable slot game.</p>
