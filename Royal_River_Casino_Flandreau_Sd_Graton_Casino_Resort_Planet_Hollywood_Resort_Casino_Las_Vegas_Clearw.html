<p>But, if you wish me to close the case anyway, just confirming it will be enough and no further information is needed. The case will be closed/rejected. No problem.</p>
<p>As for posting the thread anywhere - we would highly appreciate it. It is always great to raise awareness of common player issues in online casinos and how it works. I sincerely believe you will share a link to the complete thread to not provide only selected and/or misleading information.</p>
<p>The requested details should be sent directly to him via email and in a specific form, that is all. Thanks to his help and cooperation, we were able to solve many cases. So I would give it a chance.</p>
<p>If the casino is unresponsive and Nick is the only one who can help us, why was/is it a problem to send him the requested details and document?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is likely no other or simpler way to verify a payment method than to provide the casino with the official bank statement. It is an industry standard and therefore, unawareness is no excuse. You accepted the casino's Terms and Conditions during registration.</p>
<p>Although you kept referring to the fact that you did not receive an email from Nick and that you have only a joint account, I provided you with all the instructions from his email, how to proceed, and informed you that if you can verify the ownership of the payment method (despite it being a joint account), that you are one of the rightful owners of it, it should not be a problem to withdraw the disputed funds from the casino.</p>
<p>What information and where did you send it, please? Do you still mean only a withdrawal request in the casino, or did you follow the instructions above and send everything to Nick?</p>
<p>There were clear instructions, and for some reason, you were requested by Nick to send everything via email. However, you did not answer several questions at all.</p>
<p>I am sincerely sorry if my posts indicated disrespect or they made you uncomfortable.</p>
