<p>B2B provider of sports betting services to licensed B2C gaming operators Kambi Group has inked an agreement with the Netherlands operator BetEnt. As a part of the multi-year deal, Kambi will provide its solutions to BetEnt’s brand new sportsbook BetCity.nl</p>
<p>Kambi to Support BetCity.nl</p>
<p>Kambi will elevate BetCity’s sports betting options through its critically-acclaimed technologies. Furthermore, Kambi’s profound experience with gambling regulations and maintaining integrity will be of invaluable help for BetCity’s launch.</p>
<p>Kambi’s chief executive officer, Kristian Nylén, is happy to work with BetEnt. Nylén spoke on behalf of the whole company when he said that Kambi is “delighted to have been selected as the exclusive online sportsbook provider to BetCity.nl”.</p>
<p>“The Netherlands will be extremely competitive but the combination of Kambi’s technology and sports betting know-how with BetEnt’s sports-first strategy leaves the BetCity.nl sportsbook well placed to succeed,” Nylén optimistically added.</p>
<p>BetEnt’s chief executive, Melvin Bostelaar, is just as happy to work with Kambi. Bostelaar places his full trust in Kambi’s expertise as one of the best sportsbook providers on the market.</p>
<p>“It is exciting to enter the regulated Dutch market with such a first-class partner who fully supports and has an unrivaled track record in our values of compliance and sports integrity,” Bostelaar added.</p>
<p>Preparing for Success on the Dutch Market</p>
<p>Kambi’s services, in the company’s words, “encompass a broad offering from front-end user interface solutions through to odds compiling, customer intelligence and risk management, built on an in-house developed software platform”. It has a state-of-the-art security approach and is ISO 27001 and eCOGRA certified.</p>
<p>The business-to-business provider has over 30 customers across the global gambling scene. Some of the most notable of them include ATF, Churchill Downs Incorporated, Kindred Group, Leo Vegas, Penn National Gaming, and Rush Street Interactive.</p>
<p>Kambi has its headquarters in Malta but operates from offices across the whole globe. It has footholds in Australia, the Philippines, Romania, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States.</p>
<p>With Kambi’s help, BetCity has everything it needs for success. The fresh sportsbook will be operated by industry veterans who have previous experience in live casinos. BetCity’s shareholders are also knowledgeable industry specialists.</p>
<p>Moreover, BetCity will have an edge over a lot of operators as it will be among the first ten operators that have been licensed for operation by the Kansspelautoriteit. As such, BetEnt’s BetCity will have the opportunity to be among the pioneers on the fresh Dutch online betting market as soon as it opens on October 1.</p>
