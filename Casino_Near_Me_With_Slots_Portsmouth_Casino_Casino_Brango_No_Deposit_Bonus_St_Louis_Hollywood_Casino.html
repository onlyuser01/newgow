    <h1>Casino Near Me With Slots Portsmouth Casino Casino Brango No Deposit Bonus St Louis Hollywood Casino</h1>

<p>Played with bonus, bonus successfully implemented at the end of â‚¬4300 payout.</p>
<p>The payout will be canceled as more documents are requested. (I deposited 130â‚¬ there in the whole year 2022, nevertheless a full SoF/SoW is made now... very trustworthy)</p>
<p>So far too good, the following documents were requested:</p>
<p>We kindly ask you to upload your salary statements (payslips) for the last six months or proof of business ownership (if you have one) and detailed PDF bank statement showing this income (the origin of funds) being credited to your bank account for the last 6 months or more as well.</p>
<p>As a reminder I deposited a total of 130â‚¬, very proportionate to the SoW/SoF but ok uploaded the documents.</p>
<p>Then again rejection of the count and suddenly the following:</p>
<p>For additional verification of your account, we would ask you to upload the following documents into your profile (Documents tab): - a salary statement for the last 6 months - a detailed pdf bank statement for May .</p>
<p>Suddenly there are other documents that are required ðŸ™‚</p>
<p>After that I went to the live chat here, new documents were pulled by the hair:</p>
<p>[...]Also please, upload statements for 6 months, not for May only</p>
<p>From my payroll account which was NOT EVER USED at this casino! (The deposits were made from another account but these statements don't seem to matter...)</p>
<p>Please make sure my winnings are paid out quickly, this casino is really not recommended and I think it works very dubious.</p>
<p>If you need any further information, I'll be happy to provide it.</p>
