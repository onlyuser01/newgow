<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. Please allow me to ask you a few questions, so I can understand the whole situation completely. Could you please advise what reason you have given when requesting to temporarily block your account?</p>
<p>Please, let me explain to you what the difference is between closing the account and self-exclusion:</p>
<p>Some casinos use lots of tools for responsible gambling and I would not mention them here. What players can do if they’re unhappy in the casino: Close the account or self-exclude themselves, that's the two basic choices.</p>
<p>Closing an account is simple and has almost no impact - the player can reopen the account anytime, and the casino has no obligation to the player.</p>
<p>On the other hand, self-exclusion does. If a player successfully makes a self-exclusion the casino agrees not to open this account or if yes only under particular circumstances (after cooling off period and this cannot be done for players who’s are addicted/with gambling problem).</p>
<p>In the case of self-exclusion, if the casino failed in this, the player may ask for a refund.</p>
<p>If there’s any relevant communication, please forward it to petronela.k@casino.guru.</p>
<p>Thank you very much in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
