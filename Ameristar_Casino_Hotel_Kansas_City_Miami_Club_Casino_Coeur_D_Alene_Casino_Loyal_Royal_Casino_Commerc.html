<p>Clarion Gaming has announced a new initiative amid Safer Gambling Week. The company revealed its plans to leverage its media channels and support responsible gambling by organizing multiple initiatives.</p>
<p>Clarion Gaming Unveils Different Responsible Gambling Initiatives</p>
<p>According to a company press release, Clarion Gaming created a program that includes a mix of analysis, interviews and news. The initiative supports safer gambling and was developed in collaboration with the company’s content team. It seeks to inform the public regarding the latest updates and share valuable information for responsible gambling. The announcement comes amid the UK Safer Gambling Week that started on Monday.</p>
<p>“Safer Gambling Week is in its fifth year and has done an excellent job in driving awareness of the work being undertaken by gambling brands to reduce the incidence of problem gambling.“ Stuart Hunter, managing director at Clarion Gaming</p>
<p>Stuart Hunter, Clarion Gaming’s managing director, acknowledged that this is the fifth year the Safer Gambling Week is organized. According to him, the initiative has achieved significant success in helping raise awareness of responsible gambling and at the same time attracted support from leading gambling industry operators.</p>
<p>“Safer Gambling is important across every international jurisdiction and once again ICE will be hosting many of the world’s leading regulators and strategic bodies at ExCeL London in February,“ added Hunter</p>
<p>Hunter added that the company’s new program focuses on positive facts and figures. He said that Clarion Gaming will continue to work toward its goal to raise further awareness about safer gambling via different events, most notably, the ICE London.</p>
<p>The Company Will Provide In-Depth Studies and Analyses</p>
<p>Clarion revealed that its program will include a study on PAF, the Nordics operator. The white paper will include details on how PAF has successfully implemented a variety of responsible gambling (RG) tools that help reduce gambling-related harm and can help people control their gambling. Additionally, a study will examine the positive impact of “friction payments,” also referred to as delayed transactions that grant gamblers extra time to think about whether they want to deposit more funds or not.</p>
<p>Another analysis will look into Kindred’s “Journey Towards Zero” campaign. The ambitious campaign launched by the operator seeks to reduce the revenue from problem gambling to zero by the end of next year. A separate study will reveal interesting details about RG tools available for retail venues. Last but not least, Clairon will share in-depth statistics on gambling harm in the UK.</p>
