<p>Professional sport in the US saw another partnership between a sports franchise and a gambling company Thursday after an announcement made by the Portland Timbers that Luckii.com was named the team’s official online gaming partner.</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to welcome Luckii as our official online gaming partner.” Mike Golub, President of Business, Portland Timbers</p>
<p>Both parties also plan to collaborate on various promotional and charitable efforts, in-game and on-field sponsorships, IP rights, and a Timbers-themed game, which will be released soon.</p>
<p>“We are excited about this groundbreaking partnership with the Timbers.” Bill Yucatonis, President, Luckii.com</p>
<p>The agreement with the Timbers will ensure presence of the online gaming brand via promotions on the field and around the stadium at Providence Park to boost brand awareness among fans of the MLS franchise. In addition, Luckii will get regional broadcast integration for home and away games of the Timbers on FOX 12 Oregon and ROOT Sports.</p>
<p>“Since their launch in Oregon, we’ve discussed creative ways to introduce Luckii to our fans and are excited about this new multi-year partnership.” Mike Golub, President of Business, Portland Timbers</p>
<p>Branded Events and Promotions for Fans</p>
<p>Fans of the Portland Timbers will be given the opportunity to participate in a number of promotions and branded events integrated at Luckii.com, offering them a chance to win Timber-specific prizes.</p>
<p>“The Timbers are an iconic brand in Oregon and a franchise with deep roots in the community, along with a dedicated and passionate fan base we are excited to connect with. As we move forward with plans to expand to other states, this partnership has shown us the value of engaging with Major League Soccer fan bases across the country.” Bill Yucatonis, President, Luckii.com</p>
<p>To offer this type of fan engagement, Luckii retained Portland-based Watson Creative, spearheaded by Matt Watson, a former Nike creative leader widely recognized for developing creative marketing and advertising campaigns through storytelling at multiple brands and professional sports teams including the Timbers.</p>
<p>“Matt and his team are the best in the business and we’re excited to be live in Providence Park and on Timbers.com this season.” Bill Yucatonis, President, Luckii.com</p>
<p>The Portland Timbers became the latest professional sports franchise to team up with a gambling partner after DC United broke ground with its agreement with FanDuel in October last year.</p>
