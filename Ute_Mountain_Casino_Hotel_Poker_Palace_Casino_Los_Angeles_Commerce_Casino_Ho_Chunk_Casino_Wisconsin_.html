<p>Kinectify, a company focused on anti-money laundering and risk management, has teamed up with Kindbridge Behavioral Health (KBH), a mental health service for people suffering from gambling harm. The two companies will work on improving safer gambling tech in the United States and Canada, helping companies protect their users.</p>
<p>In addition to that, Kinctify’s chief executive officer, John Martin, will join the board of the Kindbridge Research Institute.</p>
<p>Under the agreement, Kinectify will integrate KBH’s treatment network platform into its responsible gambling software. The integration will improve the speed and efficiency of Kinectify’s solutions, helping companies shield their players from harm. It will complement the risk management firm’s one-stop solution, RG Case Management.</p>
<p>Kinectify’s AML and RG Efforts Will Be Strengthened</p>
<p>Daniel Umfleet, Kindbridge’s chief executive officer, commented on the matter, saying that “mapping out as many ways as possible for people with a gambling problem to gain access to a network of trained providers that understand what they are going through” is paramount to achieving a healthy and sustainable industry.</p>
<p>Umfleet added that the partnership with Kinectify will provide important behavioral insights from the latter company’s AML tech. In addition, by powering the AML and responsible gaming company with the KBG treatment network, Kindbridge will be able to “start to connect the link from AML to gambling harms to direct care access faster than ever before.”</p>
<p>Joseph Martin, chief executive of Kinectify and now a member of KRI’s board, also commented on the partnership with Kindbridge, saying that his team is happy to join forces with the mental health firm. He praised KBH for being the first organization to focus on building treatment infrastructure through telehealth and said that he is looking forward to testing many treatment modalities.</p>
<p>We look forward to testing a variety of treatment modalities on those that are more dangerously impacted from their gambling behavior and assisting states with solutions for treatment disparity gaps that exist due to a lack of trained resources in this field. Joseph Martin, CEO, Kinectify</p>
<p>Martin added that the pairing of Kinectify’s tech expertise with KBH’s vast network of researchers and clinicians will allow his team to train its AI models and enhance the efficiency of Kinectify’s products.</p>
<p>Last year, Kinectify joined forces with Caesars Southern Indiana and the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians to bring its AML solutions to both organizations’ gaming operations.</p>
