    <h1>Jacks Casino Cleveland Virgin Casino Online Casino Games Free Harrahs Cherokee Casino Club Casino Ga</h1>

<p>The developer of exciting and innovative slot-meet-bingo games will now give a leg-up to SkillOnNet’s casinos in the rapidly growing market</p>
<p>With gross gaming revenue in Spain continuing to soar, both SkillOnNet and Gaming Realms, the author of the Slingo vertical, stand to benefit from this new opportunity and partnership. Both companies will expand their influence in the jurisdiction.</p>
<p>SkillOnNet Launches Slingo Games Across 30 Brands in Spain</p>
<p>Spanish players will have access to the hybrid games across SkillOnNet’s ample portfolio of brands with some 30 websites available. Among those is PlayUZU, which is one of the best-known and most-respected brands that the operator is fielding in the country.</p>
<p>As to Slingo, the company is bringing a range of fantastic experiences that will appeal to local players and boost retention and engagement for partner casinos. Among those are Slingo Monopoly, Slingo Deal or No Deal, Slingo Rainbow Riches, and Slingo Extreme</p>
<p>SkillOnNet’s head of games Jani Kontturi welcomed the opportunity to work with Slingo and strengthen the network’s library of games. There are a number of high-quality releases that will be now available to Spanish audiences and resonate with them. Kontturi added:</p>
<p>Most of all, we’re excited that games that revolutionized the online casino space almost 30 years ago are finally coming to Spain.</p>
<p>Gaming Realms’ Ian Robson was similarly pleased to have this opportunity and said that his company was looking forward to seeing how the full range of products performs in the Spanish market.</p>
<p>Slingo Enjoys Strong Reception in All Markets</p>
<p>Robson noted that the Slingo product has already been tested in other markets and has elicited strong reception from local players in each. Yet, it’s the Spanish market that provides a unique opportunity for the company, the man said:</p>
<p>The Spanish market has provided the Slingo brand with an immense amount of growth in recent years and launching our advanced platform there, whilst simultaneously offering even more places to enjoy our portfolio, will allow both new and existing players to become more familiar with our offering. Gaming Realms’ Ian Robson</p>
<p>Spain is not an entirely virgin market for Gaming Realms. The company has previously teamed up with Goldenpark.es to provide the operator with its dedicated Slingo titles. Meanwhile, big companies from the industry, including Entain, have been turning a curious eye to the Slingo vertical and in some cases, securing the licensing rights to develop original products.</p>
