    <h1>Best Odds In Casino Northern Quest Resort Casino Crown Casino Casino Oklahoma Texas Border Casino Pa</h1>

<p>I have always been a loyal player of Viperspin, as of recent I won $75000 over a course of a few day and on Tuesday when I asked for a withdrawal increase they sent me an email asking for my relationship with the name Kobe who is my brother which I explained to them.</p>
<p>they then began to tell me deposits had been made with my account using my cards apparently without the knowledge of my brother using my account and are now accusing me of fraud for this matter.</p>
<p>they have also assumed that I have allowed my brother to then gamble on my personal account and other linked accounts which I donâ€™t even know of when I have never given my brother access or had any knowledge of this and due to this Viperspin have closed my account and taken away my $75000 from the money in which I have deposited weeks prior to this.</p>
<p>i feel that this is completely unfair and am not given an fair decision upon this as I have never been aware of this and was never told of this prior of me winning this but they allowed me to deposit thousands and thousands or dollars into the account before making this situation apparent.</p>
<p>have I done anything wrong here or am I being mistreated and unfairly done by ?</p>
