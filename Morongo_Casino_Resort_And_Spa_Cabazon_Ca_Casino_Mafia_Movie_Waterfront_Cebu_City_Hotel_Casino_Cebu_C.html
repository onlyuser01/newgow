    <h1>Morongo Casino Resort And Spa Cabazon Ca Casino Mafia Movie Waterfront Cebu City Hotel Casino Cebu C</h1>

<p>Hello, some days ago i received in my email an invite to participate in an exclusive tournament from Duelbits: "Aprentices Tournament: WEEK 1 - fishermen's guild". So did I, and ended up in 2th from leadearboard (leadearboard based on highest multiplier in a single spin). `</p>
<p>Link Tournament ToS:</p>
<p>https://duelbits.com/promotions/apprentice-1-fishermen?utm_source=sendgrid&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=website</p>
<p>It said on tournament ToS people would get rewarded 72h after it ends..but i asked support 4 days ago and go this answer: "Unfortunately, we are yet to receive the list of eligible winners from the provider. As soon as this is provided, payout will be made to all eligible winners"</p>
<p>Well, no problem after all, just need some time.. but 2 days ago i asked again in support and got another very different answer: "Dear customer, as our Management team mentioned, you have been disqualified from the Tournament due to the promotion abuse. This decision is irreversible. Have a wonderful day."</p>
<p>I really dont know what happened here. This tournament specifically was about highest multiplier in a single spin so what kind of abuse are they talking about?? I've asked support about this "abuse" but didnt get answer so far...Funny fact is that in WEEK 2 from this tournament ive participated and already get my reward, so how i am banned??</p>
<p>To be fair ive lost cash trying to get 2th spot in leaderboard and then got this arbitrary answer. Considering i did nothing wrong here and got this false accusation i feel kinda "scammed".. After all that was a tournament not a giveaway or some kinda of charity.</p>
<p>I've been using Duelbits for almost 2 years, have KYCed, always participating on those slots tournaments and no problem until then. If someone can help solve me this issue would be great..and if ncessary i have proof i was at second place when tournament ended.</p>
