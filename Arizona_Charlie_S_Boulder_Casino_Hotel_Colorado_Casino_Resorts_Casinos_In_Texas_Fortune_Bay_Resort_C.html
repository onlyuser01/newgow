<p>NetEnt’s new lobby look aims at increasing player’s engagement as well as providing players with better understanding of the overall product.</p>
<p>NetEnt’s New Lobby Look for the Live Casino</p>
<p>Earlier today, May 15, NetEnt unveiled a new look for its Live Casino. Players now will be able to choose from a Lobby and a Mini-Lobby, thus allowing smooth transition between the games. NetEnt’s new lobby design is contemporary and user-friendly.</p>
<p>Players can now see information regarding the tables as well as available seats, winning numbers, numbers of players and betting limits. The new lobby features tiles with live images of the games, which contributes to enhancing player experience. NetEnt’s updated lobby grants operators the option to create a customized environment or choose from generic branding options.</p>
<p>NetEnt Live Director Andres Rengifo commented on the new look “As the core of the live casino, the lobby is a vital element to get right. It makes a huge difference – from the first visit to the long-term – to the levels of a player’s engagement as well as their experience and brand perception. We believe we’ve created the perfect lobby environment to help set up the ultimate live casino player journey.”</p>
<p>NetEnt’s Swiss Market Entry Following ISO 27001</p>
<p>Back in April, NetEnt was awarded the global certificate ISO 27001. The certificate itself aims at enhanced information security management. In order to receive the certificate, the company had to pass a multitude of tests and assessments related to sensitive data and information security. This was a big win for NetEnt, considering that the tests even scrutinize at the company’s infrastructure and development.</p>
<p>Following the certification, NetEnt effectively entered the Swiss market. The Swedish company’s games first debut on both Grand Casino Luzern and Grand Casino Baden. Back in April, NetEnt Malta managing director Henrik Fagerlund commented on the exciting news: “We are very pleased to take this step into the Swiss market and look forward to launching our award-winning games with even more operators soon.”</p>
<p>The Company Continues Towards Success</p>
<p>NetEnt is clearly looking towards growing player engagement and the recent updates to its lobby confirms this. Back in December, 2019, the company released another new live roulette product – Auto Roulette Studio. The product is actually a combination between Rapid Auto-Roulette, Classic Auto-Roulette and VIP Auto-Roulette. Similar to the recent lobby update, Auto Roulette Studio introduced many changes that shook off the feeling of an ordinary casino.</p>
<p>The Swedish giant is proving to be focused on the future, considering that it hasn’t been a week since the IP agreement which was signed with Instant Win Gaming. Under the agreement, NetEnt allows IGW to use content and develop instant games. Looking back, in April NetEnt signed another strategic partnership with the Australian ReelPlay. The two companies now collaborate to protect their “Infinity Reels” mechanic.</p>
