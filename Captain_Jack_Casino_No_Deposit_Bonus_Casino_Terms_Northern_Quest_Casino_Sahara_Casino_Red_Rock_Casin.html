    <h1>Captain Jack Casino No Deposit Bonus Casino Terms Northern Quest Casino Sahara Casino Red Rock Casin</h1>

<p>As I can see, several players have already played with Cat Casino and Gama Casino (which both belong together). I am having problems with Gama Casino.</p>
<p>I was already sent a withdrawal confirmation on Neteller and the money never arrived.</p>
<p>After that, I was promised that if I give my bank details, the money will be transferred immediately. I then wrote that I would only give my bank details if I could get the money immediately. The chat also promised me that and pointed out that the payment would be made immediately. For a whole 7 days, the chat put me off again and again and could not give an answer.</p>
<p>Only after these 7 days was an e-mail sent to me that they needed more data from me. How can you take so long just to request data?</p>
<p>Of course, I also provided the other data, whereupon the casino sent me an email again that the money had been transferred.</p>
<p>That was 3 weekdays ago and my bank advisor confirmed to me that an international transfer also takes a maximum of 2-3 days. Only in very rare cases does it take longer than 3 days and that's why I have a very bad feeling again that the casino won't pay out my â‚¬1,800.</p>
<p>I also already wrote to Anastasia on Telegram, who only replied that she would look at it. After that, however, there was no further reaction.</p>
<p>Now I have to wait until Monday again, hoping that the money will finally arrive. I have never experienced a casino sending a payout confirmation email and then not receiving the money.</p>
<p>Every day you wait, you get angry and nobody gives you any information. The casino is not contactable except via the live chat which is as ignorant as you are and has no direct contact with the finance department so is completely pointless.</p>
<p>Repeated email requests are simply ignored and once you get a reply it is bland and contradictory.</p>
<p>My confidence is completely gone and when I look at my bank account again on Monday, there will probably be no money there again. It's been like this for 26 days now.</p>
<p>Why am I describing this in such detail? I can tell you that. Casino Guru currently lists 5,669 casinos and if you select the casinos based on the highest rating and thus the highest security standard, then Cat Casino is in 20th place and Gama Casino is in the TOP 100. And that out of 5,669 casinos.</p>
<p>One would expect otherwise from such highly rated casinos and it is a mystery how Casino Guru can rate these two casinos so highly. As you can see here in the thread, there were similar problems with the casino back then and at that point the rating was 8.5. Now the rating is 9.3, even though the casino has already acted dubious several times and obviously has payment problems.</p>
<p>By the way, I only signed up at Gama Casino because of Casino Guru back then, because it has such a high rating and I trusted Casino Guru here. With 5,669 casinos, the 20th and also the 100th place must be absolute top casinos, but certainly not casinos that treat their players like this.</p>
<p>I will gladly write here again when I finally receive my money. I'm curious when and if that will happen at all.</p>
