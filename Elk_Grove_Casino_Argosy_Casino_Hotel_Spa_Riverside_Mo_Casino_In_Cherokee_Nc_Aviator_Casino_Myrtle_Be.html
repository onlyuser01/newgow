    <h1>Elk Grove Casino Argosy Casino Hotel Spa Riverside Mo Casino In Cherokee Nc Aviator Casino Myrtle Be</h1>

<p>Leading iGaming technology company, providing products, services, and solutions to iGaming operators, Gaming Innovation Group, (GiG) announced that it extended its collaboration with Malta-based Avento Group.</p>
<p>Avento Group, Gaming Innovation Group Expand Existing Partnership</p>
<p>GiG explained that the partnership extension relates to the provision of its automated compliance tool GiG Comply. Moreover, the collaboration builds upon an existing agreement between GiG and Avento Group that dates back to December 2020. Back then, Avento added GiG’s automated compliance tool. Thanks to the extended agreement, Avento is going to use GiG’s automated marketing compliance tool for two more years.</p>
<p>GiG Comply enables operators to scan web pages for content and links and iGaming code red words. Additionally, the automated marketing compliance solution analyzes screenshots from marketing campaigns, extracting the content which the operators can then review. GiG’s solution enables operators to stay in compliance within multiple regulated markets considering the ever-changing regulatory landscape.</p>
<p>Responsible gambling is a key priority for Avento. This is why by extending its partnership with GiG, the company “remains in control of its marketing compliance by ensuring affiliates are fully aligned with the brand guidelines and responsible gaming requirements.” Besides Avento, other leading operators such as Pixelbet, Betway, and bet365, to name a few, are already using GiG Comply.</p>
<p>The Two Companies Are Excited to Extend Their Collaboration</p>
<p>A Avento Group’s compliance team spokesperson revealed that the company is delighted to extend its agreement with GiG. The spokesperson explained that thanks to GiG Comply, Avento ensures its compliance within the industry.</p>
<p>“We are super delighted to continue our agreement with GiG Comply,” said a spokesperson for Avento Group</p>
<p>GiG’s CMO, Jonas Warrer, said that extending its existing agreement with Avento Group makes GiG very happy. Additionally, he explained that operators saw an increased need for compliance with the continuously changing regulations in different regulated markets.</p>
<p>“It makes us very happy to start the New Year re-signing our existing agreement with Avento Group.” Jonas Warrer, CMO at GiG</p>
<p>Warrer added that GiG is “very proud to have a young and innovative partner like the Avento Group.” In conclusion, he outlined that Avento continues to trust in GiG Comply, while at the same time values how important it is to create a sustainable and safer gambling environment.</p>
<p>Founded in 2012, GiG quickly grew as a global leader providing industry-leading solutions for iGaming providers. Seeking to grow globally, the company has active partnerships with leading iGaming operators.</p>
