<p>Information about Dash casinos</p>
<p>Dash is a digital coin, or cryptocurrency, that can be used to send and receive payments. It's built on the same blockchain technology as Bitcoin but is said to offer quicker transactions and better privacy.</p>
<p>Users can pay their bills, buy retail products or even grab a coffee with the coin. They can also make online casino deposits via Dash, and this page is here to help you find safe and reliable Dash casinos. Continue reading to find out the pros and cons of the method, how to make a deposit, and bonuses offered by Dash casinos.</p>

<p>Dash – a cryptocurrency with mainstream ambitions</p>
<p>Dash's story begins in January 2014, when Evan Duffield launched it as an open-source cryptocurrency called Xcoin.</p>
<p>Duffield created it as a fork of the Bitcoin protocol, meaning he took BTC's source code and converted it into a new, independent product. Like Bitcoin, it was decentralized, but attempted to improve on speed and privacy.</p>
<p>Much of its early growth was on the 'dark web' and the currency was even called Darkcoin for a period. However, negative press around this hidden part of the internet led to the coin's team giving it a full rebranding in March 2015, settling on the name Dash, a mix of 'digital' and 'cash'.</p>
<p>Dash's unit value stayed below $10 until the start of 2017 when it started to increase dramatically. By the end of the year, it had reached a high of $1,540, hitting a market cap of $4 billion and putting it in the top 12 cryptocurrencies in the world.</p>
<p>Like with any other crypto, however, Dash's value has been subject to market volatility. Its value in mid-2021 was a tad more than a tenth of the 2017 high, but it had improved in other areas in order to be considered as a mainstream payment method.</p>
<p>Dash gave its website a complete overhaul, created an app on both iOS and Android platforms and expanded its product range. In short, it became super user friendly as the Dash team looked to take on digital giants like PayPal.</p>
<p>Today, Dash seems to have shaken off its 'dark web' past and offers a reliable service. Read on to find out more about it, and how you can use it in an online casino.</p>
<p>Pros and cons of Dash</p>
<p>Dash prides itself on three key attributes: speed, security and privacy. It does this by using three system features called Masternodes, InstantSend and PrivateSend.</p>
<p>Masternodes are users that act as a kind of security agency via a special server. They help to ensure that transactions are both instant and private, and receive a share of newly mined Dash as a payment for their time and effort. Masternodes must prove their worth to the system by first paying a registration fee and then putting in hard work to help the system.</p>
<p>PrivateSend boosts Dash's privacy by concealing the user's details. Unlike the Bitcoin blockchain, which is completely transparent, Dash users can opt out of sharing the value of the transaction and the identity of each party's blockchain. This is a big advantage for many people, who prefer not to make their details public.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrencies have also been criticised for occasional transfer delays, which you typically wouldn't get with more traditional payment methods like Visa. For a small fee, Dash users can opt for InstantSend, where Masternodes verify a transaction in a few seconds as opposed to several minutes.</p>
<p>While we can view these features in a positive light, they do also conjure up a few questions. If Masternodes are a type of authority, can we really consider Dash to be truly decentralized? If PrivateSend conceals user identities, can we really rule out the possibility of illegal transactions? If we have to pay to send a payment instantly, is it better than many online platforms that offer this for free?</p>
<p>Note: These are all questions to consider when deciding to use Dash's services, but the bottom line is that the platform has a solid reputation for quick, safe payments and that you should feel secure when using it.</p>
<p>How to find the best Dash casino</p>
<p>The most important thing for any online casino player is finding a safe site to play on, regardless of its supported payment methods or other features.</p>
<p>You can use this page to find trustworthy Dash sites, and our filters, ratings and reviews will give you a firm basis on which to make your decision.</p>
<p>To find the Dash casinos that score highest in our review process, click on the 'Recommended' tab. These are the sites that you can have most confidence in, thanks to their great customer service. Other filters include the 'Newly opened' option – which presents those brand-new Dash casinos on our database – and 'All', which will simply give you the full list.</p>
<p>You can also sort the list by other criteria. If you'd like to find ones that have games by a certain games developer, then go to 'Game provider' and choose the company of your choice. NetEnt casinos, for example, is an extremely popular choice.</p>
<p>For a more in-depth look at how to find that perfect casino, you can check out our How to choose an online casino article which covers every detail.</p>
<p>Using Dash in online casinos</p>
<p>Once you've found a Dash casino that you're happy with, then you'll need to make a deposit to play games – unless the site offers you a no deposit bonus, of course, but we'll come to that later.</p>
<p>To start with, make sure that your casino account is fully open – that is, that all verification checks are complete and you're registered. Next, have your crypto wallet with Dash ready for use.</p>
<p>The payment process should go along these lines:</p>
<p>In the casino's cashier, select Dash as the payment method and copy the casino's wallet address Go to your crypto wallet and put the address into the 'send' section, as well as the amount you want to transfer Double-check the amount and click confirm.</p>
<p>The money should land in your casino account within a few minutes, but it's not impossible for a delay to happen. In that case, you should contact your crypto wallet or casino to check that everything is OK.</p>
<p>Note: In terms of Dash withdrawals, it's possible that the casino in question doesn't allow them, or perhaps your wallet doesn't accept them. If you're unsure, check with either of them. If it is possible, then you simply do the above process for the opposite direction, however it might take longer and be more expensive.</p>
<p>Bonuses offered by Dash casinos</p>
<p>Bonuses are a nice way to get to know more about a new casino if used in the right way. You might be offered one after your first deposit, known as a deposit bonus, or even before you put any money down at all, as with a no deposit bonus.</p>
<p>To discover the Dash sites that offer bonuses, you can start by going to Casino Guru's list of casino bonuses and choosing 'Dash' in the 'Payment Method' filter. If you're looking for a specific type, then you can select your preference in the 'Bonus Type' section. No deposits bonuses, for example, are very popular, and you can see these by clicking 'No Deposit Bonus'. You can also go to our list of no deposit bonuses and choose 'Dash' there for the same results.</p>
<p>Finally, be assured that the Casino Guru team works hard to only include offers relevant to the day of your search. You should also be able to see your bonus's expiry time from when you claim it in the information box alongside it.</p>
