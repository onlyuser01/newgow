<p>James “PhantomL0rd” Varga has won a case against Twitch for the platform’s decision to terminate his streaming channel abruptly back in 2016.</p>
<p>Varga Wins Twitch Ban Case</p>
<p>Former Twitch streamer James “PhantomL0rd” Varga has won a lawsuit against the Amazon-owned streaming platform. Following his suspension from the platform in 2016, Varga prepared a lawsuit that launched in 2018 in San Francisco and sought damages from Twitch for wrongfully suspending the streamer’s account.</p>
<p>The player himself shared the news on Twitch, proclaiming his victory a victory for “ALL streamers.” Varga said that he had won the case on all counts resulting in approximately $21,000 paid in damages.</p>
<p>However, it’s probably Twitch that should be thankful as a previously set $50,000 damages cap has been lifted, so the court could have put a much stiffer penalty. At the time when he was banned, Varga had over 1.3 million followers that could have resulted in substantial revenue over the years.</p>
<p>Originally, Varga sought the whopping $35 million from the streaming giant. The sum paid in damages, though, relates to the 30-day notice period which Twitch failed to provide the streamer, effectively proving that no more was owed and characterizing the abrupt ban lacking a notice period as a “small misstep.” A company spokesperson added:</p>
<p>“While we regret the procedural failings related to Mr. Varga’s termination in 2016, he repeatedly violated Twitch’s Community Guidelines and exposed our community to harmful content.” Twitch spokersperson</p>
<p>Ignoring the Notice Period</p>
<p>Twitch suspended Varga’s account on July 19, 2016, outlining no reason at first other than the streamer had breached the company’s Terms of Services, a popular refrain the streaming giant uses in high-profile cases, and most recently the one involving Dr. Disrespect, a Fortnite and VALORANT player and streamer.</p>
<p>At the time of the ban, rumors swirled that Varga was the owner of CS: GO Shuffle, a skin betting website that allowed players to gamble on weapon skins for the popular game. He was showing content from the website on his stream, media reported.</p>
<p>The issue must have proven sensitive in light of a looming class-action lawsuit against Valve, the Counter-Strike: Global Offensive developer and publisher, who was accused of facilitating underage gambling for failing to restrict skin trading in the first place.</p>
<p>However, Varga didn’t hesitate to seek justice and said that Twitch never issued a formal reason for his suspension and that Twitch would allow him to stream gambling content for up to 30 minutes.</p>
<p>When litigation started, Twitch reiterated its claim that the streamer had breached the service’s terms despite having been issued various penalties and warnings to ensure the integrity of the service.</p>
