    <h1>Casino In Waukegan Illinois Wind Creek Casino Montgomery Buffalo Bill S Resort And Casino Primm Neva</h1>

<p>Pariplay has been actively growing its portfolio of content providers to join the company’s dedicated distribution platform, Fusion. The aggregator has now added Fazi to the list, with the supplier bringing more than 100 excellent titles.</p>
<p>All of Fazi’s games are based on HTML5 technology, covering both the slot and table verticals, along with many well-known and established titles already, including Book of Spells, Giga Hot 40, Lolla’s World, Roulette, Crystal Hot 40, Wild Hot 40, and so many others.</p>
<p>With Pariplay taking on global markets, Fazi makes a perfect addition. The company itself has been able to penetrate numerous jurisdictions in Latin America and Europe, and this collaboration with Pariplay will only help strengthen the supplier’s reach.</p>
<p>Pariplay, which works with more than 80 suppliers and features over 14,000 games is only shortlisting companies and products that uphold the highest industry standards. This is why Fazi makes a strong addition to the overall selection of titles as confirmed by Pariplay Director of Partnerships Callum Harris who was thrilled to see the brand join:</p>
<p>"Fazi has a great product portfolio, offering a mix of slots and table games that have already proven popular in several markets."</p>
<p>Harris further added that it has been Pariplay’s ambition to only expand with great content and trusted partners. Fazi Head of Sales Andrea Stojanovic said she was delighted to strengthen her position in what is a competitive market with the help of Pariplay, which will help Fazi stand out among competitors.</p>
<p>Stojanovic was excited to see Pariplay and Fazi work closer together as she noted that both companies share the same core values and passion for delivering state-of-the-art products that strike home with players. Pariplay’s Fusion platform has been a lot in the news of late. Pariplay has secured a number of commercial partnerships to help bolster the overall library of titles.</p>
<p>Among the studios to become recent members of Pariplay and Fusion are Swintt and Everi Digital. Meanwhile, Slotmill and Kalamba Games have recently joined Pariplay’s Ignite partner program. Aggregators have become one of the most successful distribution options for companies in the industry.</p>
<p>While studios have been trying to sign individual deals as well, aggregators such as Pariplay’s Fusion have proven to be the most cost-efficient way to reach new audiences, markets, and operators.</p>
