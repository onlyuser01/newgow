    <h1>L Auberge Louisiana Casino Treasure Island Casino Hotel Casinos Near San Diego Harrahs Casino Cherok</h1>

<p>Thank you for your reply, Shane. Please note that if the casino account belongs to your partner, they should always be the one who has access to it. You have breached 2 main online casino rules by this - you accessed an account that hasn't been created in your name; and deposits in each account should only be made by the owner of that account, which in this case is your partner.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, technically it is very difficult to check whoâ€™s the owner of the payment method at the depositing stage. This can be checked only during the account verification, which is usually done when a withdrawal is requested.</p>
<p>Since the casino has no way of knowing who is accessing the account and who is depositing, you couldn't be stopped or blocked, therefore we cannot punish the casino. I am sorry, we would really like to help you, but it is impossible for us this time. I can only recommend that you do not use someone else's account and never make deposits to such accounts to avoid situations like this in the future.</p>
<p>Please, let me know if there is anything else I could help you with, otherwise, I will be forced to reject this complaint. Thank you for your understanding.</p>
