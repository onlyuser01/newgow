    <h1>Atlantic City Casinos Casino Hollywood Buffet Atlantis Casino Reno Horseshoe Hammond Casino Miami Ca</h1>

<p>It had a little relationship with the Cyber.bet site. I deposited a few times with bonuses that they always sent me. My account has been verified. Overall, I had never won there. At the beginning of April, I received a bonus for a deposit of 1500 BRL. I did and for the first time, at the end of the rollover I had a balance higher than my deposit. When requesting a withdrawal, he asked me to send a selfie with my document and the website screen. I did and sent. After a few days, they informed me by email that they blocked my account, that in 10 days I would receive the amount of my balance. They informed that the reason would be the suspicion that I would be involved in fraudulent and illegal activities of money laundering. Obviously, I'm not a thief and I don't have money to launder. I'm a worker, I pay my taxes, I don't have and I've never had any problems with the law or police authority. I have a fixed address, I have been employed by the same company for 17 years. Don't move massive amounts of money. I could prove to the site who I am and my clean slate. But it was clear that the site just wanted to keep my money the first time I won. The other few times I deposited there and lost, I was no problem for the site. Well then, it became even clearer that the site's attitude was just to keep my money, when they didn't fulfill what they themselves said in the email they would do. They didn't refund my money even after 10 days and they don't answer my emails. Clearly the site is acting in bad faith.</p>
