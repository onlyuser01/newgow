<p>PokerStars players can win Platinum Passes by creating content on Twitch and watching the brand’s Twitch channel.</p>
<p>Watching PokerStars’ Twitch Channel Can Earn You A Platinum Pass</p>
<p>Streaming is becoming a big deal in the online poker world, and PokerStars wants to push the trend a little bit further. A new promotion from the brand will provide Twitch players with the chance to earn Platinum Passes.</p>
<p>Pokerstars players who link their accounts with Twitch will be provided with an exclusive Platinum Pass promotion. As part of the prize, players will also receive a PC that is optimised for streaming and a $1000 deposit into their PokerStars account. They simply have to watch 24 hours of coverage on PokerStars’ Twitch channel and stream over 10 hours of themselves playing poker on their own Twitch channel.</p>
<p>Two players will be able to win Platinum Passes, and they will be allocated by PokerStars Twitch Ambassadors Georgina “GJ Reggie” James and Mason “PyeFace” Pye. On December 23, the two players will be judging each entry based on the quality of the content they produce as well as how innovative and entertaining it is.</p>
<p>So, if you want to win a Platinum Pass, you’ll have to get creative. The most popular streamers on Twitch didn’t become famous by simply streaming their hands; they put a lot of thought and effort into their streams, and you’ll have to do the same if you want to be a Platinum Pass winner.</p>
<p>Twitch and PokerStars Working Together</p>
<p>This is all part of PokerStars’ new strategy to integrate its platform with the Twitch network. So, we’re likely to see even more exciting promotions that involve both of these big brands in the future.</p>
<p>“Integrating PokerStars further with Twitch is just another step of a long list of plans and ideas we plan on testing with the aim of players getting even more from their time with us” – said Scott Goodall, Head of Poker Communities &amp; Engagement at The Stars Group.</p>
<p>This PokerStars promotion will be available to players around the world. Whether you’re playing from Europe, the UK, New Jersey or Pennsylvania, you’ll be able to vie for your chance to win Platinum Passes by getting active on Twitch.</p>
<p>One of the next big things coming up for PokerStars and Twitch is the EPT. PokerStars will be live streaming the event on the popular online platform, so you can tune in from anywhere to catch a glimpse of the action.</p>
