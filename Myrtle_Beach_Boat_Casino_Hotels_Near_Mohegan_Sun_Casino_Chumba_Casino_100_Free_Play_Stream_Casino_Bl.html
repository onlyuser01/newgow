<p>As a highly experienced financial professional, Hussain has a lot of working experience in senior roles at numerous reputable companies. That includes William Hill, Betfair, The ZEAL Group, Tipico, and Probability Plc.</p>
<p>His 15-year career is now reaching its peak as PressEnter Group will take advantage of his experience in working at regulated companies that have achieved fast growth. The CEO of PressEnter Group, Lahcene Merzoug, acknowledged Hussain’s massive experience in the respective field and noted that using that experience will be of massive importance to PressEnter as the company is looking to capitalize on its growth plans.</p>
<p>Merzoug went on to say that the company culture at PressEnter is incredible and it allows “all members of the team to excel and thrive.” He concluded that not only will Hussain help deliver this type of culture, but he will also benefit from it.</p>
<p>While speaking about the appointment, Hussein was also kind enough to share a few words. He said that he’s delighted to join the company at this time and help it on its quest to become a market leader. He added that he’s more than excited to start working with the team.</p>
<p>As a CFO of PressEnter, Hussain will be supporting Merzoug, driving the company’s strategic aims (especially M&amp;A), and supporting the C-suite in this period of fast growth.</p>
<p>About PressEnter Group</p>
<p>PressEnter was established in 2018 with one goal in mind – deliver the best casino products and provide a unique online experience. As the CEO of the company, Merzoug believes that it is important to stand out, especially in an environment that is as competitive as online gambling.</p>
<p>It operates several well-known online casinos with JustSpin, 21.com Nitro Casino, and UltraCasino being the most popular. Back in October 2021, the company moved to its new headquarters in Malta. While speaking about the move, Merzoug stated that the new offices are a step further in establishing PressEnter as an industry power player. As for the reason why Malta was chosen, he said that it is a jurisdiction known for providing gaming excellence.</p>
<p>One of its recent changes also included rebranding its affiliate program in November 2021 and thus, entered a new chapter. Hannes Thunberg, the head of affiliates at PressEnter, commented on the development by saying that even though the company may have a new look and feel, the team remains unchanged.</p>
