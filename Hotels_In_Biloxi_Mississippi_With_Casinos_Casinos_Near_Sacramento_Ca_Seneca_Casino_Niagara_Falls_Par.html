<p>Wynn Resorts-owned mobile sportsbook WynnBET has revealed that it has been approved to operate in Louisiana’s betting market. This will be the 17th state where WynnBET has at least some market access.</p>
<p>WynnBET Continues Its Expansion on the US Market</p>
<p>WynnBET has seen a spectacular expansion in recent times. The Las Vegas-headquartered operator has been keen on reaching new markets and expanding its influence to more and more states. WynnBET’s offerings can currently be freely used by bettors in Michigan, Colorado, Tennessee, New Jersey, Virginia and Indiana. The operator also just launched its sports wagering offerings in Arizona, where regulated sports betting went live in September.</p>
<p>Together with the other states where WynnBET has a varying degree of market access, it has been estimated that the operator reaches a total of 46% of the entire adult population of the country. The operator doesn’t plan on stopping, and is currently in negotiations with seven more states. If WynnBET manages to acquire a license for operations in all of them, this would increase its reach to almost 80% of the population in the country.</p>
<p>In order to maintain and expand its dominance, WynnBET should be wary of the fluctuating nature of the iGaming regulation rules. Especially since the legalization of sports betting in 2018, the industry has experienced a fast period of evolution and change. WynnBET’s vigilance to the changing landscape will be important for the operator’s future expansion to new markets.</p>
<p>WynnBET: An Industry Powerhouse</p>
<p>WynnBET is one of the betting brands of Wynn Interactive. Wynn Interactive, in turn, is the iGaming branch of the Nevada-based casino and hospitality company Wynn Resorts. Wynn Interactive also operates the WynnSLOTS and BetBull betting brands. Through its iGaming offerings, Wynn Interactive aims to provide the full Wynn Resorts experience to people across several states through their PC or mobile devices.</p>
<p>The WynnBET brand has been critically acclaimed as one of the best mobile betting applications. The quality of its offerings is backed by a well-designed user-friendly interface and betting mechanics that double down on the social aspect of gambling.</p>
<p>WynnBET is the authorized gaming operator of NASCAR, the NBA and MLB. WynnBET has also been officially approved as one of the NFL’s sports betting operators.</p>
<p>In addition, the gaming operator is a marketing partner of many of the aforementioned leagues’ teams. WynnBET recently inked a deal with the New York Jets. Other than sports league franchises, WynnBET has strategic partnerships with various industry professionals. A few weeks ago, the operator teamed up with the renowned data management company Genius Sports to boost its fan engagement.</p>
