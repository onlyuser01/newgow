    <h1>Hard Rock Casino Gary Indiana Daniel Craig In Casino Royale Casino Spokane Wa Casino Night Zone Gold</h1>

<p>Gaming Laboratories International has made two new appointments to strengthen its staff and ensure that it maintains a good rapport with tribal and governmental institutions and agencies</p>
<p>As a result, GLI is bringing in Joseph Bunveith who is going to work as VP of government relations and regulatory affairs. Another important appointment is in the face of Kelly Myers who will be working as director of government affairs.</p>
<p>GLI president &amp; CEO James Maida welcomed the new appointments with both of them having experience in the respective field they are going to represent. Maida said:</p>
<p>At GLI, we are continually planning for the future of this exciting and dynamic industry. These proven leaders in their new positions enable us to serve our clients even better in both technology and regulatory advice, empowering our clients to face the future armed with the best possible information and insights. GLI president &amp; CEO James Maida</p>
<p>The firm is confident that it is making the right decision as it will be able to navigate and enhance its understanding of government and regulatory affairs as it goes along. This will bring more ability for partners to interact with agencies from both sectors.</p>
<p>GLI Brings the Right Veterans in the Right Places</p>
<p>Both appointments are smart additions and seasoned industry veterans â€“ although not limited to the gambling industry necessarily. Bunveith for example has worked with a number of prominent companies to achieve product launches across Apple App Store, Google Play Store, Steam, and Facebook App.</p>
<p>He has a strong track record in helping develop fantasy sports online gaming platforms and is joined by Myres who has more than 17 years in tribal gaming regulation. She is uniquely capable to deliver on significant results for her company and has worked as compliance and licensing manager for the Cherokee Nation Gaming Commission.</p>
<p>She has similarly collaborated with other tribal nations, including the Iowa Tribe of Oklahoma Gaming Commission and the Oklahoma Tribal Gaming Regulators Association.</p>
