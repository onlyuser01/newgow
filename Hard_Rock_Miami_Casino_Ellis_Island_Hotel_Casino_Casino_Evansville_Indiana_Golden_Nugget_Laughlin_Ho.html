    <h1>Hard Rock Miami Casino Ellis Island Hotel Casino Casino Evansville Indiana Golden Nugget Laughlin Ho</h1>

<p>My account was hacked, I made the corresponding inquiries, I gave the information, I had approximately 1,110,000clp in it, my last play was on March 10. Two days ago I entered my account and I had 700,000clp less, yesterday I had 300,000clp and I saw how my balance went down, someone was in my account. From the casino they only told me about the IP, which can also be hacked, that it was the same IP and that there would be no compensation. There are only two people living in my house and one of them is an elderly person and doesn't know how to use electronic devices. They have not given me a solution, I was harmed by a huge hack and I lost all my money. I felt that they treated me as a liar, I explained to them over and over again that I had NOT played, that nobody has access to my accounts. They sent me the terms and I already knew them because I read them, I played legally and responsibly and when I won that amount, I stopped playing. The only thing I ask of them is the return of the money, they are sitting idly by and I was harmed. I really don't know how they used my IP, I'm desperate and I just want justice to be done. I will send my account id (46396901). The attached photo is the amount he had, which today is 0.</p>
