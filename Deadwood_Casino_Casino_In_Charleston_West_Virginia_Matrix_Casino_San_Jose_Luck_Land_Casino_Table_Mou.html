<p>GGPoker Network, an industry-leading supplier of poker software, table games and arcade games, has forayed into the Romanian iGaming market under the playgg.ro domain name.</p>
<p>Playgg.ro Will Provide Romanian Fans with Fully-Localized Experience</p>
<p>The launch was officially recognized by the Romanian regulator, National Gambling Office who will assume authority over the site’s integrity. Playgg.ro will be operated by GGPoker’s parent company, GGN Europe, and Skywind Holdings, working collectively as the Malta-based group WindGG.</p>
<p>The poker platform will be advertised by GGPoker’s global ambassador Daniel Negreanu – an elite poker player of Romanian origin, who is famous for winning the World Series of Poker bracelet six times. Negreanu will participate in playgg.ro’s advertisement content and will also propagate various promotions celebrating the site’s launch.</p>
<p>Playgg.ro will offer Romanian poker players a fully localized experience, created with the local fans’ needs in mind. That means that playgg.ro will have dedicated customer support that speaks the Romanian language, as well as all the various responsible gambling tools that the Romanian National Gambling Office requires from operators.</p>
<p>GGPoker Will Allow Romanian Players to Be a Part of the Biggest Poker Events</p>
<p>Hilary Stewart-Jones, the chief executive officer of Skywind, has spoken about the exciting launch of playgg.ro. She said that the whole Skywind team is delighter to partner with GGPoker. Furthermore, Stewart-Jones shared that her team is extra excited and proud of the Romanian launch because her company’s philosophy is to focus on “local partnerships with a global scale.”</p>
<p>For GGPoker’s head of Europe, Marco Trucco, this partnership is a crucial step in the expansion of GGPoker into the regulated European Markets. This year has seen GGPoker launch in several new European markets. One of them is the Belgian iGaming market where GGPoker operates as ggpoker.be. The other is the fresh Dutch online gambling market that went live this fall, where GGpoker is available as ggpoker.nl. Romania will now join the list of countries where the renowned operator’s offerings are made available.</p>
<p>“Romanian players now have access to the best poker software, the biggest tournaments and promotions in the industry,” Trucco noted.</p>
<p>Speaking of the biggest tournaments in the industry, playgg.ro launched too late for Romanian players to join the World Series of Poker Las Vegas but is still in time for the main event of the World Series of Poker’s European edition. This means that confident Romanian players can join the exciting competition for a chance to win a share of the $5.6 million prize pool. The event is scheduled for the beginning of December and will take place in the King’s Casino in Rozvadov, Czech Republic.</p>
