<p>The National Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG) released today the National Detailed Report and State Detailed Reports to summarize findings from a survey on public attitude towards gambling and gambling-related issues.</p>
<p>“NCPG is to be commended for undertaking this enormous research project.” Robert Jacobson, President, Board of Directors, NCPG, Executive Director, California Council on Problem Gambling</p>
<p>Largest NCPG Research on Gambling Behavior</p>
<p>Serving as comprehensive follow-up reports to the National Survey of Gambling Attitudes and Gambling Experiences (NGAGE) 1.0, the reports represent the largest research project undertaken by NCPG up to date and likely the largest survey on public opinion.</p>
<p>“There is no need to make assumptions or rely on much smaller studies anymore. The State Reports are especially important – whether you are an operator, regulator or health provider – since all decision-making for the gambling industry resides at the state level, and health providers address local needs.” Robert Jacobson, President, Board of Directors, NCPG, Executive Director, California Council on Problem Gambling</p>
<p>Based on the responses from more than 28,000 participants, the reports highlighted areas of concern related to young people as the answers to at least 1 of the 4 questions indicating problem gambling from 50% of the respondents under 35 suggested risk of problematic behavior. In comparison, only 10% of respondents over 65 indicated problem gambling.</p>
<p>“We hope the new reports spur the public and private sectors to redouble their efforts to implement policies and allocate resources to create a safer gambling environment, as well as assist those who show signs of gambling addiction or are in recovery.” Keith Whyte, Executive Director, NCPG</p>
<p>Summary of Survey Findings</p>
<p>The survey revealed gambling as a very popular pastime in the US as every 3 out of 4 adults reported to have gambled in the year preceding the survey, while only 12% stated they had never engaged in gambling.</p>
<p>Another insight the reports provided was that legal restrictions had almost no effect on gambling, as more than 50% of adults in two states which prohibit any form of gambling, Utah and Hawaii, reported to have engaged in gambling behavior in the past year.</p>
<p>In addition, 1 in 5 respondents admitted to having placed a bet last year, while by the time of the survey there were only 2 jurisdictions that allowed legal wagering on sports.</p>
<p>Sponsored by Entain and conducted independently by Ipsos, the survey also provided insights into current trends related to daily fantasy sport and sports betting in the US, outlining sports bettors as particularly exposed to high risk of problem gambling.</p>
<p>“While organizations like the National Council on Problem Gambling will use this data to help make those goals a reality, any entity that interacts with the gambling industry will benefit from better understanding public sentiment about gambling as America undergoes an unprecedented amount of gambling expansion, especially sports betting.” Keith Whyte, Executive Director, NCPG</p>
<p>According to the survey, sports bettors are over 3 times more likely than people not engaging in sports wagering to report problem gambling behavior, and if betting occurs on a regular weekly basis, the ratio jumps to 5 to 1.</p>
<p>NGAGE 2.0 is expected to take place in the next 12 months, NCPG outlined, to track changes in gambling behaviors and help inform industry operators, regulators, and local governments on future trends.</p>
