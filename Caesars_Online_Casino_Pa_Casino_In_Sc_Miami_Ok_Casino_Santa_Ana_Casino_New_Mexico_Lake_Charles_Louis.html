    <h1>Caesars Online Casino Pa Casino In Sc Miami Ok Casino Santa Ana Casino New Mexico Lake Charles Louis</h1>

<p>Dear fxtqk2b4js,</p>
<p>Thank you for contacting us. I have checked the casino’s website for options to close an account and unsubscribe from all correspondence with the casino and its services, and this is what I found (here):</p>
<p>Responsible Gaming</p>
<p>We at CosmicSlot believe that gambling should be fun and free of harm and only done for entertainment purposes. Before you start playing at CosmicSlot, it is very important to understand that gambling should never be viewed as a source of any kind of income or recipe to pay off your debts. We strongly recommend you to keep track of how much time you spend playing casino games and how much money you can afford yourself to spend on them.</p>
<p>Although recommendations stated above might seem obvious for some of you, there are still certain percentage of players who lose control over such things when playing. If you think you might be one of those players and gambling has negative impact on your life or life of your family and friends, we can suggest you one of the following things:</p>
<p>You can always contact our support department at support@cosmicslot.com and ask to terminate your CosmicSlot account for a certain period of time. After that we will take necessary measures to completely block you from our site and block any promotional e-mails that you might have been receiving from our casino before.</p>
<p>Please contact customer support team if you want to set a personal cooling-off period.</p>
<p>When applying for the self-exclusion, state clearly the reason why you want your account to be deactivated and specify the time period. Also, email "Subject" should be clearly marked and easily recognizable as casino support receives many requests per day hence, if it’s visibly marked you stand a better chance to have your request granted as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>Email subject: Self-exclusion</p>
<p>Player’s info:</p>
<p>First name:</p>
<p>Last name:</p>
<p>DOB:</p>
<p>Casino login:</p>
<p>Email address:</p>
<p>"Greetings CosmicSlot Casino,</p>
<p>I’m writing to inform you that I wish to exclude immediately from this casino and from receiving any gambling-related marketing material for a minimum period of xxx months/years (lifetime).</p>
<p>The reason that preceded my decision is xxx</p>
<p>I acknowledge that I will not be allowed to rescind my self-exclusion during this period and self-exclusion cannot be lifted before the end of the agreed period."</p>
<p>Please send another email to support@cosmicslot.com (you can CC me at petronela.k@casino.guru in the copy) and keep me informed about any further developments. Thank you in advance.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
