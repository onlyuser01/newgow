<p>The NFL is coming to London in Week 5 with the Jacksonville Jaguars vs. Buffalo Bills game which will take place at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Sunday, October 8.</p>
<p>The Buffalo Bills are coming off a huge win over the in-form Miami Dolphins, which has certainly given Sean McDermott’s men a huge confidence boost. The win happened on their turf, while this coming weekend, they’re playing overseas. Tottenham Hotspur Stadium is the venue where the Bills will take on the Jacksonville Jaguars.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bills Wanna Keep Their Good Run Going</p>
<p>They suffered an overtime loss to the New York Jets in the first round, but after that, the Bills have been nothing short of impressive. In their most recent game, they destroyed the Miami Dolphins 48-20, a team that recorded a 70-20 win a week earlier.</p>
<p>The result is that the Bills are now 3-1 with the second-best offense in the conference and the best defense in the AFC. Their offense is scoring 34.75 points per game, but what’s surprising is that they haven’t scored anywhere near that number against Jacksonville in more than a decade.</p>
<p>In their most recent game against the Jags, the Bills scored just six. And even that isn’t their worst offensive performance against this opponent. In 2018, they scored just three points against Jacksonville. Both of the aforementioned games took place away from Buffalo.</p>
<p>Jacksonville Jaguars Putting Their Hopes in Their Defense</p>
<p>The Jaguars are 2-2 in 2023, with 20.00 points scored and 20.50 conceded per game. Their defense did very well against tough teams such as the Kansas City Chiefs. Mahomes &amp; Co. did beat them in Week 2, but the reigning champs scored just 17 points that day.</p>
<p>The Jags offense, however, has been pretty disappointing. Quarterback Trevor Lawrence needs to up his passing game ASAP. He did do okay in last weekend’s game, throwing for 207 yards and one TD. That’s not too bad, but he can definitely do better.</p>
<p>What’s giving the Jags confidence they can improve their stats is that the next game is played in London. That’s where they demolished the Atlanta Falcons 23-7 last Sunday.</p>
<p>Jaguars vs. Bills Prediction</p>
<p>The Buffalo Bills are much better than the Jacksonville Jaguars in all aspects of the game, but this is going to be a much closer game than expected. First of all, we don’t think the Bills are going to do great so far from their home. Secondly, the Jags’ offense is ready to take that big leap forward, possibly scoring more than two TDs for the second time in 2023.</p>
<p>Their defense, however, doesn’t seem capable of stopping the Bills’ offense. That’s the main reason why we think the Jags are going to lose on Sunday.</p>
<p>Pick: Bills to win but not cover the spread; over to hit</p>
