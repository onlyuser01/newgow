    <h1>Drake Casino No Deposit Bonus Parking At Treasure Island Casino Las Vegas Grande Vegas Casino Login</h1>

<p>Livespins has grown its portfolio of partner studios with a fresh addition as 1X2 Network and the company’s content providers, Prospect Gaming, AD Lunam, Iron Dog Studio, and 1X2gaming,will now all be available through the acclaimed slot streaming platform.</p>
<p>All four of 1X2 Network’s studios' content will now be a part of the Livespins library of titles, which will see the original games deployed with streamers worldwide. Livespins has been looking to completely change the way people think about casino streaming, making it possible for viewers to not just passively consume streams but also to actively participate in them.</p>
<p>Livespins allows viewers to use an intuitive and accessible overlay and menus that enable them to gamble on the outcome of slot games that streamers are playing in real-time. Now, among the titles that can be played this way are 1X2 Network studio options, such as Megaways Jack, Feeding Fury, Forge of the Gods, Wolf Strike, and more.</p>
<p>Viewers and streamers can interact openly through the platform, raising the level of fun. Livespins Chief Commercial Officer Michael Pedersen has welcomed this new opportunity and said that he was very happy to see the quarter of studios now power the Livespins platform and offer exciting titles to local players.</p>
<p>"1X2 Network’s studios are behind some of the most popular slots in the market and via this partnership, we have rolled them about across the Livespins platform," Pedersen explained.</p>
<p>This is a brand-new way for casino players to experience their favorite games, the executive added. 1X2 Network CPO Alex Ratcliffe was similarly excited about the partnership:</p>
<p>"We are passionate about creating thrilling classic and innovative video slots but are also committed to producing next-generation content through our Iron Dog Studios, AD LUNAM and Prospect Gaming brands."</p>
<p>He said that the tie-up with Livespins would allow the studios to inject their content directly with players in one of the most innovative and entertaining manners available anywhere in the industry. Streaming has become a preferred way of distributing slot content, as Pedersen attested himself in a recent interview with the Casino Guru news team.</p>
<p>Livespins has had some successful partnerships to report on lately. The platform has been able to secure some of the biggest names in the industry and the parade of willing studios and suppliers is not waning.</p>
<p>Notably, Livespins added both Jelly Entertainment and Relax Gaming’s titles and products to its ever-growing library of titles.</p>
