<p>US domestic leader in online poker since 2013 World Series of Poker (WSOP) expanded its presence into a fourth US state, following the launch in Michigan today.</p>
<p>The Wait Is Over</p>
<p>The launch of WSOP.com in Michigan added to the brand’s presence in Pennsylvania, Nevada and New Jersey, offering online poker players a broad mix of live-action games from No Limit Hold’em to Pot Limit Omaha, as well as a full slate of daily guaranteed tournaments.</p>
<p>“With two world champions coming out of this state, Michigan is a special market for the WSOP,” commented SVP of the World Series of Poker at Caesars Entertainment and WSOP’s Executive Director Ty Stewart.</p>
<p>The popular poker brand owned by Caesars Entertainment also offers players a chance to earn their way to gold bracelet events in Las Vegas via exclusive 2022 WSOP satellites. WSOP’s other enticing features include BLAST Poker, a poker game allowing players to win up to 10,000x the amount of their buy-in.</p>
<p>“We’re sorry it’s taken so long, but WSOP.com is ready to make up for our late entry with industry-leading promotions, the biggest weekly tournaments, and player appreciation benefits like freerolls to the Main Event in Las Vegas.” Ty Stewart, Executive Director, WSOP</p>
<p>The Path to 2022 WSOP Main Event</p>
<p>To further popularize its brand in the Great Lakes State, the brand signed a partnership with Michigan resident and 2009 Main Event Champion Joe Cada. Under the agreement, the local poker player will serve as a WSOP brand ambassador, hosting live streaming sessions from the WSOP.com website, participating in bounty events and hosting live tournaments around the state.</p>
<p>“It’s go time in Michigan. I know a lot of local players are excited that WSOP.com is finally live in the state and I’m personally looking forward to getting to know all the great poker players at tournaments and online events soon. Game on!” Joe Cada, Brand Ambassador, WSOP</p>
<p>To mark the agreement with Cada, the brand is offering a $1,000 bonus to any Michigan resident who can outlast him in the 2022 WSOP Main Event. For the first time, the event will be taking place on the Las Vegas Strip this summer, and WSOP.com offers satellites starting as low as $1 as a path to the event.</p>
<p>First-time depositors at the website will also have another way to Las Vegas as the winner of a monthly freeroll will receive a VIP trip to play at the Main Event.</p>
<p>Sing-Up Bonus and Rake</p>
<p>Michigan players are set for WSOP’s most generous offers in terms of both sign-up promotions and rake propositions. Upon signing, players will receive $25 available for play and $25 upon deposit. A match-up bonus of up to $1,000 is also part of the package WSOP is looking to entice online poker players with.</p>
<p>Poker grinders will have the opportunity to receive two online reward credits for every dollar of rake or tournament fee paid and points can be redeemed for cash or tournament tickets, or linked with Caesars Rewards for unbeatable experiences at Caesars destinations nationwide, including in Las Vegas.</p>
