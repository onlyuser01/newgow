<p>Hölle Games has launched its slot portfolio with ZEAL Network, strengthening the latter’s established LOTTO24 and Tipp24 brands. Through this new partnership, Hölle Games is deploying its portfolio of player-favorite and innovative titles, including Autobahn Automat, Bells, DrunkenSailor, and one of the most recent releases, Reel Tiger.</p>
<p>Hölle Games CEO Robert Lenzhofer has welcomed the opportunity to launch with the company and its brands. He said that ZEAL has more than one million active users in Germany, and this new partnership was a significant boost to the supplier’s own reach.</p>
<p>"ZEAL’s presence in Germany is unparalleled and we are proud to support ZEAL on their journey to dominate yet another iGaming-vertical, with our market-leading Slots-offering," Lenzhofer added.</p>
<p>ZEAL Network has picked Hölle Games as its first and only slot supplier for the time being, as confirmed by the official press release. As a supplier, Hölle Games has been able to secure a number of prominent partnerships with various operators, including SkillOnNet, which has welcomed the games onto its PlayOJO and DrückGlück brands.</p>
<p>Hölle Games has also signed several partnerships this month alone, one with Inside Casino and another with SlotsMove, as the company continues to expand its offer. Over the past several months, the supplier has also launched titles such as Reel Tiger, Hellish Seven Multi 100, and Fruits 20 DELUXE, as part of its ongoing efforts to continuously improve its presence and bring intuitive and worthwhile gaming experiences to players.</p>
<p>ZEAL has also been strengthening its own offering. Recently, the company confirmed that it will be introducing products by Swintt and onboarding those onto its Zeal Instant Games, part of the group’s overall product offer.</p>
