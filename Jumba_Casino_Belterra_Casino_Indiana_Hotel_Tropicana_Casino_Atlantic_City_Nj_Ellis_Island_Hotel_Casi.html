<p>Sports betting specialist Pinnacle received a license to operate online sports betting in Ontario last month. The company now announced that it hopes to launch in the province by the end of the next week.</p>
<p>Pinnacle to Go Live in Ontario</p>
<p>Although Pinnacle is yet to officially go live, it has already launched marketing efforts in Ontario. Local customers will be able to make accounts on Pinnacle’s new localized site starting October 26. To play with Pinnacle, users will also have to install GeoGuard to confirm and verify their location. Some may also need to verify their identity.</p>
<p>Ontario launched its online gaming market this spring. Since then, several notable gambling companies have launched in the state. Pinnacle will be a great addition to the list of local licensees as it is a highly reputable brand and the operator of choice for many fans across the globe.</p>
<p>Ever since Pinnacle obtained an iGaming license from the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario, sports betting enthusiasts have been eagerly awaiting the company’s official launch. While the launch may cause some trouble to existing bettors, it will ultimately provide Ontarians with great regulated sports betting offers.</p>
<p>The launch in Ontario has caused fans to speculate that the operator might next try to re-launch in the United States. While the company is yet to announce any such plans, the USA would make a lot of sense considering the scope of its betting market. On the same note, Pinnacle previously tried to re-launch in the United Kingdom but ultimately failed to do so.</p>
<p>Some Bets Might Be Voided</p>
<p>Pinnacle, which has until now been operating in Ontario as a gray operator, warned its customers in the province that it will stop taking bets for an hour between 11 pm and 12 pm on October 23. This maintenance period will ensure a seamless launch in the new market. The operator warned that some pre-existing bets might be voided so players should wager carefully.</p>
<p>Pinnacle contacted its customers via email to explain the situation:</p>
<p>For those bets that are canceled, if the markets are no longer available on the new site, and the result of the bet has not yet been determined, we can re-offer those bets to you (except Multiples bets). Pinnacle statement</p>
<p>The company added that when the markets reopen and become available on the new site, customers will be free to place their bets anew. Players will have five days to contact Pinnacle’s customer service to help them re-place any future bets. This, Pinnacle emphasized, applies only to bets that have been placed earlier than October 18.</p>
