    <h1>Orleans Casino Restaurants Best Casino Online Real Money Highest Payout Online Casino Luckyland Slot</h1>

<p>Thank you for the email. In the footer of the message with the bonus offer, there is a link redirecting you to the Terms and Conditions of this particular bonus, and there are the following rules:</p>
<p>The following betting activities are not permitted until the bonus wagering requirements are met:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Using bonus funds to purely progress through the bonus stages of games.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Equal, zero or lower margin bets</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bets on non-slot games such as table or card games</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Betting more than €4.00 per spin or 10% of the bonus amount received (the smaller of the two)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Betting on disallowed games (Check out " Disallowed Games " to see the list of disallowed games)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using the 'purchase feature' function or Buy Pass on a game</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If, ​​when we analyze your betting activities, you are found to have performed one of the above actions, your winnings will be removed.</p>
<p>Our position is closely explained in Fair Gambling Codex. The max bet rule is, in fact, an industry standard, just as the fact that a casino has the right to seize the player's winnings from bonus play after breaking this rule. We prefer not to go against industry standards by penalizing casinos that use the maximum bet rule against players from time to time.</p>
<p>However, if you feel like you have been accused mistakenly, feel free to forward me your game history. My email address is veronika.l@casino.guru.</p>
<p>If there is any other relevant communication between you and the casino, please send it as well.</p>
