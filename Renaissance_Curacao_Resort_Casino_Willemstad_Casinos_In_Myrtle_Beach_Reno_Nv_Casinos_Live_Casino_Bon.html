<p>The company becomes the first iGaming provider to secure the prestigious certification recognizing its commitment to safer gambling</p>
<p>The fast-growing betting and gaming technology supplier, EveryMatrix, confirmed that its efforts toward responsible gambling were recognized by a prestigious status. The company has announced that it was awarded a Safer Gambling certification from the World Lottery Association (WLA), the international, member-based organization of state-authorized suppliers and lotteries to the global lottery sector.</p>
<p>The prestigious certification represents a milestone moment for EveryMatrix. This is because the company became the first iGaming supplier to hold a certification from the WLA, reaffirming its commitment to best practices in responsible gambling.</p>
<p>The latest WLA certification comes after an extensive company-wide audit process for EveryMatrix. Ultimately, the Association recognized the company’s current and future commitment to safer gambling. Moreover, the WLA confirmed that EveryMatrix is prepared to go above and beyond to ensure the best practices in safer gambling.</p>
<p>Currently, EveryMatrix’s Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) policy has a robust strategy related to safer gambling that provides all tools necessary along with information for the company’s clients and employees. The latest recognition adds the company to a growing list of iLottery providers with WLA that have already achieved this standard and vowed commitment to its principles.</p>
<p>The Certification Brings Excitement to WLA, EveryMatrix</p>
<p>Melissa Azam, WLA’s CSR senior manager, revealed that the Association is delighted to award EveryMatrix with its Safer Gambling certification. She explained that the certification is a testament to the company’s commitment to safer gambling and ensuring player protection.</p>
<p>“The WLA is pleased to officially recognize EveryMatrix’s adherence to the WLA Responsible Gaming Guidelines for suppliers highlighting their commitment to ensuring player protection and safer gambling is at the core of both their own and their customers’ operations.“ Melissa Azam, CSR senior manager at WLA</p>
<p>Naomi Koops, EveryMatrix’s senior compliance counsel and safer gambling coordinator, added that the latest certification recognizes the company’s commitment to the Association’s principles. This commitment, she continued, extends beyond EveryMatrix’s lottery partners and includes all of its clients. Koops added that the company’s products are developed with “player protection in mind” and are backed by academic research.</p>
<p>“The WLA are pioneers in safer gambling certification and we’re delighted they have recognized our work, commitments and pledges to both uphold and drive forward safer gambling best practice across everything we do.“ Ebbe Groes, CEO at EveryMatrix</p>
<p>Ebbe Groes, EveryMatrix’s CEO, said that the company is excited to see the recognition from the WLA in terms of responsible gambling. He spoke about common goals that the company and the association share toward safer gambling.</p>
<p>According to Groes, EveryMatrix remains committed to protecting players and encouraging safe and responsible gambling. This, in turn, can lead to sustainable growth and expansion of the sector as well, he added. Finally, Groes praised the latest achievement and said that he is looking forward to seeing more companies secure the prestigious certification.</p>
