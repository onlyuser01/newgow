    <h1>Downtown Casino The Cromwell Las Vegas Hotel Casino California Hotel Casino Harrah S Cherokee Casino</h1>

<p>Yes, I answered their question as to what the reason for the self-exclusion was and that is that I didn't want to lose any more money. I told both the support and the vip manager! I'm sending you screenshots. What other reason can there be behind a request for a PERMANENT self-exclusion of a player if not that of not wanting to know more about playing and losing money? The fact is that I followed their T &amp; Cs where they talk about responsible gaming:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you think you are spending more money than you can afford, or if gambling is starting to interfere with your normal daily routine, we strongly recommend that you consider several measures that can help you, such as setting Personal Limits on your activities gambling, opting for self-exclusion or seeking help and support from trusted independent bodies.</li>
</ul>
<p>-WHAT IS SELF-EXCLUSION?</p>
<p>The self-exclusion setting informs us that we must take all steps to block your access to your account and ensure that you do not receive promotional material. You can also contact our support team at support@skycrown.com and inform us of your decision to stop gambling on the website for a certain period of time or forever.</p>
<p>It is not even mentioned in these T&amp;C that you have to specify the reason for the request for self-exclusion because it is already implied ("do not spend more money than you can afford .."). The fact is that I mentioned the reason why and instead of understanding the problem and following their T &amp; C's they offered me a bonus to make me change my mind. If this is normal for you ..</p>
<p>This is the history of the emails:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I ask in Italian for permanent self-exclusion from the support via email</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I ask for permanent self-exclusion in English to the support via email</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>-after the support asks me if I am sure I confirm by asking again for permanent self-exclusion</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the support asks me the reason and at the same time convinces me to desist with the proposal of a bonus</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I explain that the reason is that I did not want to lose any more money and that I could only accept a substantial bonus (and here I fall into their trap)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>-then the VIP manager contacts me at the invitation of the support and she also asks me why and asks me if to change my mind she can offer me a bonus</p>
<ul>
<li>I also repeat to her that I did not want to lose any more money</li>
</ul>
<p>-the vip manager then offers me 200 euro bonus with 10x rollover</p>
