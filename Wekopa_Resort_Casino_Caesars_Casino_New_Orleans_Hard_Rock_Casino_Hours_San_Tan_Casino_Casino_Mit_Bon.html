    <h1>Wekopa Resort Casino Caesars Casino New Orleans Hard Rock Casino Hours San Tan Casino Casino Mit Bon</h1>

<p>I received 2 bonuses simultaneously. A deposit that would be 50% + 50 free spins. And another 10 free spins. I fulfilled the rollover, which is already absurd. When I requested the withdrawal after one day I received an email in the spam box that said that my withdrawal had been canceled and my winnings voided. You claim that I have exceeded a 10% maximum bet amount. At the time I requested the withdrawal, my bonus balance was approximately R$47.00, until then it was ok for them to cancel my balance, but I had not used the 50 free spins that were granted to me in the bonus. With these free spins I won another 5 or 7 reais that if added would give a total of more than R$50.00 of bonus. Therefore, the bet I made of R$5.00 would be within the maximum 10% value. An agent even told me that the values are not added up, but the bonus balance does not show any description of their individuality. At first I didn't even know about this 10% maximum bet, of course the site uses it in bad faith to try to take away the winnings from players who don't read the thousands of lines of terms. If each specific bonus received that I can play up to 10%, it should be considered the sum of them, since there is no clear distinction between them in the balance area. The previous attendant didn't even know how to explain the free spins bonus calculations. This is sad because it casts doubt on whether the voiding of my winnings was correct or not. In my view it was not correct. No one explains, they just repeat the reasons and don't give me data. By chance it wasn't just my complaint that I saw here claiming the same thing, strange because in other casinos they make a point of showing you how much rollover is missing and what is your maximum bet whenever you enter any game. Ex: MrSlots casino. But it's easier to void player winnings! If that's not bad faith, I don't know what is. Why would I play for more than allowed value if I knew?</p>
