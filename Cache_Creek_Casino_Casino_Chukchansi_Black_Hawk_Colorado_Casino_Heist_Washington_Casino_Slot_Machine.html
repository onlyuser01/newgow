<p>Arsenal to face Chelsea in Uefa finals</p>
<p>Chelsea facing a difficult game and a tougher future due to transfer freeze</p>
<p>The Gunner did better versus Chelsea in the EPL</p>
<p>Two English teams set into a head-to-head battle in the 2019 Uefa Europa League finals at the Baku Olympic Stadium on Wednesday, May 29.</p>
<p>Arsenal and Liverpool Vying or the European Silverware</p>
<p>It has been a turbulent season for both the Blues and the Gunners. Offered a chance to redeem from missing out on the title in the English Premier League (EPL), Chelsea and Arsenal will have a go at the Uefa Europa League final on Wednesday, 29.</p>
<p>Playing at the Baku Olympic Stadium in Baku, Azerbaijan, both teams have been faced with a spate of troubles at home. Arsenal finished fifth at home, after losing all three of their last games in the League, but overcame Eintracht in the semi-finals to advance to the finals on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Date : Wednesday, May 29</p>
<p>: Wednesday, May 29 Place : Baku Olympic Stadium</p>
<p>: Baku Olympic Stadium Time: 8:00 PM BST</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Chelsea has been faced with quite a bit on its own. First, the club may be barred from transferring footballers in the 2019/2020 season in the EPL. Secondly, N’Golo Kante may not be coming back in time from an injury to play for the Blues on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Maurizio Sarri is caught up in a tight corner after he almost lost his job earlier in the season amid changes in the club’s ownership. He did manage to see the Blues through in the Europa League which secured him his position, though.</p>
<p>Both Arsenal and Chelsea seem to have done better in Uefa’s competition than in the home championship this year. Their chance to redeem for somewhat poorer performance is on the hands, but only one team can walk away victorious.</p>
<p>Did Arsenal Crumble in the Last Leg of the EPL?</p>
<p>Arsenal’s performance in the final stretch in the EPL hasn’t been exactly inspiring. With three consecutive losses and a draw, Arsenal’s form crumbled. The Gunners did manage to pry away a victory against Eintracht in the semi-finals, though, with one goal in each game.</p>
<p>Arsenal needs to pull itself together and vie for the title, after most recently missing out on the European silverware in 2016. Understandably, the Gunners don’t have so many things to worry about in the upcoming football season. They won’t have to deal with a transfer handicap, which may send the Blues below 10th spot in the new season, some fear.</p>
<p>Jude Summerfield, an analyst, has said that while the Blues had better run in the EPL, Arsenal pulled off far more impressive games against the blues. It will be a full English final and his is worth watching. In a sense, the Uefa’s finals will be a more meaningful conclusion than the last pre-determined round of the EPL.</p>
