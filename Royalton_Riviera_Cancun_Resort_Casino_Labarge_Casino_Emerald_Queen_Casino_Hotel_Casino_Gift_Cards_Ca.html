<p>ICE London is, without a doubt, one of the most important conferences in the gambling industry. This year, the high-profile exhibition event will be running from February 4 to February 6 at the ExCeL in London. As expected, several gaming operators and gambling companies are already gearing up to showcase the products and offerings that they have been working on. There are very many exciting exhibitions in the line up from leading gaming brands which sets the event up to be one of the most exciting ones of 2020.</p>
<p>Microgaming’s New Slots</p>
<p>Last year, Microgaming announced that it was shutting down its online poker network but it assured its customers that it had so much in store for them. At the upcoming ICE London, the company will be showcasing some titles in its ever-expanding portfolio of gaming content.</p>
<p>The company reportedly has plans to unveil over 100 exclusive games as well as over 200 partner games to its highly-praised content aggregation platform. That is definitely going to be a huge development for the company especially as it readies to completely do away with its online poker network.</p>
<p>Enter the LatAm Poker Network</p>
<p>Thankfully, poker operators who may have been relying on the Microgaming Poker Network, now have a brand-new option – the LatAm Poker Network. This EvenBet product will be exhibited at the ICE London 2020 next week. While this poker network is set to be focused on the South and Latin American poker market, it is expected to be one of the biggest highlights of poker gaming this year.</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play Readies New Range of Virtual Sports</p>
<p>The renowned gaming content and solutions provider has several new additions to its robust multi-product portfolio lined up. These will all be released in the course of 2020 and gamers will have the chance to get a glimpse of them at ICE London.</p>
<p>Its upcoming Virtual Sports offering is perhaps the most interesting of the bunch. The range of games that will fall under this category includes Fantastic League, Horse Racing and Penalty Shooting.</p>
<p>Scientific Games Going All In</p>
<p>Scientific Games Corporation has always been one of the leading brands in the global gambling industry. It has always been a trendsetter and things will be no different at the ICE London 2020. The company is expected to showcase the broadest portfolio of games, systems and innovative technology at the event.</p>
<p>“The passion from our team members around the globe has resulted in amazing games and solutions that our players and partners will love,” said Barry Cottle, the company’s President, and CEO.</p>
<p>Clearly, they have been very busy over the past year preparing to continue taking their customers through the journey into the best-in-class gaming experiences. The Scientific Games’ booth has always been a major highlight of the event and this year it is bringing even more heat. Brace yourselves for some mind-blowing showcases.</p>
