<p>Cricketer Brendan Taylor in Spot-Fixing Blackmail Plot After Snorting Cocaine with Gang</p>

<p>Brendan Taylor, 35, did not go through with the group’s demands to “spot-fix” in international cricket matches. But his story offers a stark warning about how naïve athletes can be coerced into corruption by criminal gangs.</p>
<p>Spot-fixing describes the manipulation not of the final result, but of the minutiae of a match. In cricket, this could be the number of “no balls,” for example, the game’s equivalent of a “ball” in baseball.</p>
<p>The rise of internet betting has enabled gamblers to place bets on these small details, or spots, within a game.</p>
<p>The Hook</p>
<p>Taylor says he was approached by an Indian “businessman” in October 2019. The unnamed figure wanted to discuss a potential sponsorship deal and the possible establishment of a T20 league (a quick-cricket format) in Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>The man told Taylor he would be paid US$15,000 to travel to India to discuss the deal. Taylor said he was “wary” of the approach.</p>
<p>But at the time, he hadn’t been paid for six months by Zimbabwe Cricket, the domestic governing body. The Zimbabwe team was a force in international cricket in the 1980s and 1990s. But it has been in crisis since the mid-2000s after some players openly opposed the regime of late dictator Robert Mugabe.</p>
<p>Following a government backlash, many of its finest players left the game, while Mugabe’s economic mismanagement gradually crippled the nation’s economy. Players have been sporadically fighting Zimbabwe Cricket, which critics say is a tool of the government, over politics and payments ever since.</p>
<p>And there are few prettier sights to a match-fixing syndicate than a badly remunerated top-level sportsman.</p>
<p>The Set-Up</p>
<p>Taylor made the trip, but his apprehensions were allayed when discussions with the businessman and his associates were restricted to pre-agreed topics of commercial partnerships and the T20 league.</p>
<p>On the last night, he was taken for a celebratory dinner, which involved cocaine use, and Taylor partook.</p>
<p>The Sting</p>
<p>The next morning, he says the same men stormed into his hotel room and showed him a video taken of him snorting cocaine. They said the video would be made public unless he agreed to spot fix.</p>
<p>I was cornered. And with six of these individuals in my hotel room, I was scared for my own safety,” Taylor wrote. “I’d fallen for it. I’d willingly walked into a situation that has changed my life forever.”</p>
<p>Taylor said he accepted the $15,000, which he was told was now a “deposit” for spot-fixing. He would be paid a further $20,000 once he had finished the job. He says he accepted the money so he could get out of India.</p>
<p>“I would like to place on record that I have never been involved in any form of match-fixing. I may be many things, but I am not a cheat,” added Taylor, who announced his retirement from international cricket last year.</p>
<p>The Shut-Out</p>
<p>Four months after the incident, he reported it to the International Cricket Council (ICC), the sport’s world governing body.</p>
<p>Despite choosing not to comply with the syndicate’s demands, he still faces sanctions because the ICC’s anti-corruption code states all match-fixing approaches must be reported “without unnecessary delay.”</p>
<p>Taylor says the incident has severely impacted his mental and physical health, resulting in a doctor prescribing the anti-psychotic drug amitriptyline. He is seeking help for issues with substance abuse.</p>
<p>“I want to be a better version of myself,” he said.</p>
