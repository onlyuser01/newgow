    <h1>Lake Of The Torches Resort Casino Casino Kush Strain Potawatomi Casino Carter Stake Casino Free Casi</h1>

<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>I had an account with Casino Midas and was at VIP status and at one stage I had a large balance due to a win. Being a VIP I had a weekly cash out limit of $6,000. But after some weeks, I was only able to cash out $2000. When I contacted the casino, I was told that the system had defaulted my cash out limits to the standard as I had not made any deposits and not played enough. I had been playing the way I usually would. They told me it was a system algorithm, but they would see what they could do to help. After many weeks, they came back to me with a solution of, if I managed to play and earn 100,000 comp points a day - 700,000 in a week I would be able to withdraw more. With far too many hours playing and reducing my winnings substantially, I managed to do it once and was only able to withdraw $4,000. I contacted my VIP host again and explained how I thought it was a very unreasonable limit and that given I had managed to get to VIP status it was wrong to have this kind of limit. After more weeks went by, I received a response that they could offer that if I reached 500,000 comp points in a week, I would be able to withdraw a higher limit. I managed to do this, but at the same time used all of my winning and had a zero balance. I did have a comp points balance (which I was told not to cash in - so that they could see that I was reaching my comp points target) the comp points were the equivalent of $3,500 Australian dollars. I received an email a few hours later saying that my account had been closed and would not be reopened. They gave no reason. The email also had reference to Jack Million Casino as well as Casino Midas. Which is odd because I only have the account with Casino Midas.</p>
<p>I replied to the email asking when my comp points would be transferred to my bank and have heard nothing. I have also sent 2 emails to my VIP account manager asking what the reason for cancellation is and when I can expect to receive my comp points conversion into cash deposited into my account and still have heard nothing.</p>
<p>Can I please get some assistance with this.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance</p>
<p>Kristi .</p>
