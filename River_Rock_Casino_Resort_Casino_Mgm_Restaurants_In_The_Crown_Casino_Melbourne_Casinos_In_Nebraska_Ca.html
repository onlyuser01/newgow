<p>Also, WHY are they claiming to you they 'wired the remaining funds' after sending the $300 in btc? The total amount of withdrawal totalled $300..what remaining funds?</p>
<p>Bottom line: whatever happened, it is 100% confirmable that the address they say they sent funds to is an LC wallet, not one of mine.</p>
<p>Bitpay's Blockchain research also shows those funds were then sent to another address, obviously not mine, but prob a another LC account wallet.</p>
<p>What Blockchain DOES show is that I made a $40 deposit to that address, meaning its a LC wallet. So if they sent $300 to that wallet as they claim, they sent it to themselves and should be easily confirmed by checking their wallet address transaction for $300 received right after they said it was sent, correct?</p>
<p>Most importantly, the address they sent btc is not my wallet. I have email confirmation from Bitpay support that it isnt an address from my or any Bitpay wallet address.</p>
<p>He sent a Blockchain screenshot of several 6/15 transactions apparently one of showing the $300 payment. However the screen shot shows no amount near $300 nor the wallet address they claimed to have sent it to. I have pointed this out, he says he's getting back to his finance team, this was 2 days ago.</p>
<p>I am in direct contact with Cody from LC. He spoke to me once and have texted a few times since.</p>
