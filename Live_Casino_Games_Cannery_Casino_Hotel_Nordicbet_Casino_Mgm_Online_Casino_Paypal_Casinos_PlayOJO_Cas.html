    <h1>Live Casino Games Cannery Casino Hotel Nordicbet Casino Mgm Online Casino Paypal Casinos PlayOJO Cas</h1>

<p>I have been with PlayOjo for a few years and took some time out for a break. I recently won $400 and cashed out. Oh my goodness, the headaches I’m going through, there’s only 4 withdrawl methods for Ontario residents. And none of them are easy or fast. They used to offer Interac as an option but they no longer do. Mastercard won’t accept a refund to the card, which leaves me with the other two options one is pay safe (which I have no idea what it is) the other I have never heard of but consists of registering and contacting their people to discuss account options etc… I don’t need any account with a third party, I just want my withdrawl, so this just leaves me with the wire transfer option which could take a week (which is now going to be two weeks cause I am unable to make a withdraw cause there’s a document still "processing"). I submitted all requested documents after about 4 days they reversed my withdrawal and told me they needed a card ended in 4 particular digits. I don’t have a card ending in these digits I explained this in the chat and email. Of course emails take days before they’re responded to (if they ever are) and the live chat is NEVER live and that takes days as well. I have submitted cards, bank account information, utility bills, passport id and still nothing. Ojo prides itself in being the fair casino, but after all these headaches and lack of communication I don’t agree.</p>
