    <h1>Fremont Street Casinos Choctaw Casino Resort Grant The Casino Wow Online Casino Grand Palladium Pala</h1>

<p>Redeem bonus I was givin. Played thru the bonus with 12 bucks and was given a playthrough amount. I continued to play and cleared the play through amount by a long shot. 1600 bucks or more then it reduced It to the amount I could redeem..wich was only 100 after it deducted the 1400 from wagering... I still continued to play with it and manage to bring it up to 710.00 I withdraw from my account and had to deposit 10$ Bitcoin to confirm my digital account.. it processed and everything looked good. Continued on with my withdraw request and was confirmed saying congratulations your winnings are on the way.. 4 hours later still not received anything I finally get ahold of customer service. To be told my withdrawal request has been rejected and my Bitcoin deposit would be sent back to me but I have to wait 72 hours for my 10$ Bitcoin deposit..so now not only am I getting denied my winnings fair and square. But I'm getting held up to receive my own money out didn't take but 10 mins to take it from me. But now 72 hours before I get it returned</p>
