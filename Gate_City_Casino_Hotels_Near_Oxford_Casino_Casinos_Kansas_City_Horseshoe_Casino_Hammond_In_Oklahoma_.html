    <h1>Gate City Casino Hotels Near Oxford Casino Casinos Kansas City Horseshoe Casino Hammond In Oklahoma</h1>

<p>Dear Lucasg,</p>
<p>Thank you for contacting us. I have checked the casino’s website for options to close an account and unsubscribe from all correspondence with the casino and its services and this is what I found (here):</p>
<p>Self-exclusion</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>By requesting a period of self-exclusion, you agree to follow the below terms and conditions, which will be in effect from the time that CS implements the chosen period of self-exclusion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You may self-exclude for periods of 1, 3, 6, 12 month/s or permanent. Self-exclusion requests are to be made via Live Support.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once you have self-excluded you will not be able to access your account or withdraw during this period.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>When applying for the self-exclusion, state clearly the reason why you want your account to be deactivated and specify the time period. Also, email "Subject" should be clearly marked and easily recognizable as casino support receives many requests per day hence, if it’s visibly marked you stand a better chance to have your request granted as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>Email subject: Self-exclusion</p>
<p>Player’s info:</p>
<p>First name:</p>
<p>Last name:</p>
<p>DOB:</p>
<p>Casino login:</p>
<p>Email address:</p>
<p>"Greetings BC.Game Casino,</p>
<p>I’m writing to inform you that I wish to exclude immediately from this casino and from receiving any gambling-related marketing material for a minimum period of xxx months/years (lifetime).</p>
<p>The reason that preceded my decision is xxx</p>
<p>I acknowledge that I will not be allowed to rescind my self-exclusion during this period and self-exclusion cannot be lifted before the end of the agreed period."</p>
<p>Please send another email to support@BC.GAME (you can CC me at petronela.k@casino.guru in the copy) and keep me informed about any further developments. Thank you in advance.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
