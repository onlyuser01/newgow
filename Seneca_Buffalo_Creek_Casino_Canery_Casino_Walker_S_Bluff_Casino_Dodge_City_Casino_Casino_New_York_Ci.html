    <h1>Seneca Buffalo Creek Casino Canery Casino Walker S Bluff Casino Dodge City Casino Casino New York Ci</h1>

<p>The Kansas City Chiefs remain one of the top 3 Super Bowl candidates, with the odds on them winning the Championship currently standing at +600.</p>
<p>This might seem strange, knowing that their record ahead of Week 7 is 3-3. We saw them struggling many times this season already, but what happened last weekend has filled this team with confidence. On Sunday, they beat the Washington Football Team, 31-13.</p>
<p>The good news is that the Chiefs seem to be back on the right track. The bad news is that next Sunday, they’ll be facing their toughest opponent thus far. The team in question is the Tennessee Titans, who beat the favored Buffalo Bills in Week 6.</p>

<p>It’s All About the Chiefs Defense in Week 7</p>
<p>Sure, when people talk about the Kansas City Chiefs, the conversation almost always revolves around Patrick Mahomes. No surprise there, as he might be the very best quarterback in the NFL.</p>
<p>Judging by what we’ve seen so far from him in 2021, he surely deserves to be one of the top favorites for the MVP award. He was the #1 favorite before the season kicked off. However, due to his team’s poor performances, Mahomes is now the #9 on that list.</p>
<p>Still, he isn’t much to blame for his team’s disappointing record. Instead, it’s the Kansas City defense that should take all the blame.</p>
<p>The fact that there’s only one team in the AFC that’s conceded more points than them shows how poor the Chiefs’ have been in the defense. They did, however, put on a good display in Week 6 against the WFT. However, in Week 7, they’re taking on one of the league’s best offenses, led by incredible running back Derrick Henry.</p>
<p>Tennessee’s RB Derrick Henry Looks Impossible to Stop</p>
<p>Ahead of Week 6, the oddsmakers thought of the Titans as an underdog against the in-form Bills. However, Henry proved everyone wrong.</p>
<p>The running back had an exceptionally good game, with three touchdowns. He made 20 carries for 143 yards in that game, recording the fastest speed for a ball carrier in 2021.</p>
<p>Derrick Henry (76-yard rush TD)</p>
<p>Henry reached a top speed of 21.80 mph, the fastest speed reached by a ball carrier this season, and fastest play of Henry's career as a ball carrier.#StatThat | Powered by @awscloud pic.twitter.com/ktP54hTnrS — Next Gen Stats (@NextGenStats) October 19, 2021</p>
<p>Stopping this guy seems like a mission impossible for the Kansas City defense. What’s worse is that he’s not the only Titan they should fear.</p>
<p>Tennessee’s quarterback Ryan Tannehill has also been fantastic this season, especially with his rushing game. Truth be told, we haven’t seen him impressing with his passes, but the reason might be that his main targets have been struggling with injuries.</p>
<p>Speaking of injuries, it seems that WR Julio Jones has suffered an injury against the Bills and might have to sit out the Kansas City game.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, with or without him in the team, the Titans’ offense just looks too good for the Chiefs’ defense.</p>
<p>Pick: Tennessee Titans to win; over should hit.</p>
