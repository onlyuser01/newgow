<p>Yggdrasil and Jelly have joined hands for the release of Fury of Hyde Megaways, the first title in the brand-new Curious Cases series</p>
<p>The global gaming provider looking to build a worldwide partner network with leading operators, YG Masters partners, and franchisees has launched the first chapter of the fresh adventure-focused classic tale together with the independent real-money game studio “driven by the love of great games.” Packed with free spins, mystery symbols and Hyde Super spins features, Fury of Hyde Megaways is expected to quickly become a hit among lovers of the genre.</p>

<p>Inspired by Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde’s Story</p>
<p>Clearly inspired by the popular Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde story, the new slot carries gamers on a mysterious journey through the beautiful and mysterious cobbled streets in London. The graphics are excellent and the atmosphere is maintained with the help of the nicely designed symbols including science kits, serum bottles, books, and, of course, the Hyde and Jekyll symbols.</p>
<p>As expected, the game features cascading symbols that pop up after every Megaways win, leading up to some mouthwatering potential wins thanks to the HYDE Super Spin with high volatility. The feature can be triggered on any random spin, where it acts by removing symbols, boosting the Multipliers, and increasing the minimum Megaways during a single super spin.</p>
<p>Players who manage to come across a minimum of four bonus symbols are sent straight into the Free Spins bonus round. There, they can expect to see extra HYDE Super Spins being triggered along with a growing Multiplier for a potentially huge win potential.</p>
<p>A Great Way to Introduce the New Series</p>
<p>Jelly’s marketing lead Victoria Newbolt spoke about the new release as a game that they were “extremely proud of”, calling it an excellent manner of introducing players to their Curious Cases slot series.</p>
<p>The series plans to carry players on engaging journeys with inspiration from popular tales, myths, and legends. Newbolt also praised the Megaways boost given to the game which is expected to deliver “a truly thrilling and innovative game”.</p>
<p>At the same time, Yggdrasil’s head of product and programs Stuart McCarthy called Fury of Hyde Megaways a “fantastic addition” to their current YG Masters portfolio with combined the already-proven mechanics with a top storyline and nicely designed graphics. McCarthy also spoke about the new game’s role as a pioneer slot chosen to break the ice for Jelly’s Curious Cases series.</p>
<p>In September 2022, Yggdrasil and Jelly came together for the release of Wild Fishin’ Wild Ways. Buffalo Blox Gigablox and Big Benji Bonanza are additional slots released by the two companies earlier in the same year.</p>
