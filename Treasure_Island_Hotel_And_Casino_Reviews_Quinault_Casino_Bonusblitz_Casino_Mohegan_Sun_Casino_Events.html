<p>The Jacksonville Jaguars are traveling to California in Week 3. The destination is SoFi Stadium where they’re going to be welcomed by their AFC foes, the Los Angeles Chargers on Sunday, September 25, 2022.</p>
<p>Oddsmakers think the Chargers are going to win, but judging by what we saw from the Jags last weekend, it’s not going to be easy. The spread is set to seven points, but bettors wonder if the Chargers are going to be able to cover it. To see our prediction for Sunday’s game, make sure to read this Jaguars at Chargers preview until the very end.</p>

<p>Jacksonville Jaguars Coming Off Their Best Performance in Years</p>
<p>In Week 2, the Jacksonville Jaguars did something they haven’t done in years – they shut out their opponent, winning the game 24-0. The most impressive fact is that they did it against the Indianapolis Colts, who entered the game as 3-point favorites.</p>
<p>Led by second-year quarterback Trevor Lawrence, the Jags offense did a marvelous job that day. The QB threw 25/30 for 235 yards and two touchdowns and no interceptions. The Jaguars also did well rushing the ball, with running back James Robinson recording 23 carries for 64 yards and one touchdown.</p>
<p>Still, it was the Jacksonville defense team that deserves the most credit for winning the game last weekend. Even though they had to play against a top 3 running back (Jonathan Taylor) and a former MVP quarterback (Matt Ryan), they allowed zero points.</p>
<p>Los Angeles Chargers Need to Bounce Back After a Sobering Loss in Week 2</p>
<p>After a 24-19 win in Week 1 over the Las Vegas Raiders, the Chargers lost to the Kansas City Chiefs in Week 2. The final score was 27-24, even though the Chargers entered the fourth quarter with a 3-point lead. Their performance in that game showed that perhaps they’re still not ready to do well in big games.</p>
<p>However, we should see them do okay against underdogs such as Jacksonville. They have a great record against the Jaguars, with four wins and one overtime loss in their previous five meetings. The last time they played – two years ago – they won 39-29 with QB Justin Herbert throwing for three touchdowns.</p>
<p>We expect Herbert to do great again. He’s a fantastic ball thrower who seems capable of outsmarting any defense in the league. The evidence of this is that, along with Patrick Mahomes, he’s one of only two players that have recorded 3+ passing touchdowns in more than 40% of their games.</p>
<p>Jacksonville Jaguars vs Los Angeles Chargers Prediction</p>
<p>The Jaguars’ defense was superb last weekend, but we don’t expect them to pull off anything similar this coming Sunday. Sure, they’re not going to embarrass themselves at SoFi Stadium, but we don’t think they stand a chance against Herbert &amp; Co.</p>
<p>Picks: Los Angeles Chargers to win and cover the spread</p>
