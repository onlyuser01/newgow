<p>Cleveland Indians Win Streak Hits 20, Tribe Now World Series Favorites in Las Vegas</p>

<p>The Cleveland Indians had basically wrapped up their Tuesday night game against the Detroit Tigers after their leadoff hitter Francisco Lindor hit his 30th homerun of the season to take a 1-0 lead. It would be all the Tribe needed, as ace Corey Kluber pitched nine scoreless innings in route to the defending American League champions’ record-tying 20th straight victory.</p>

<p>The Indians haven’t lost since August 23, and is tied with the 2002 Oakland Athletics for the longest win streak in 82 years. And the Tribe shows no signs of slowing down, prompting Las Vegas sportsbooks to shorten their World Series odds.</p>
<p>At the Westgate SuperBook, Cleveland is now at 3-1 to win the Fall Classic. That correlates to a moneyline of +300, meaning a $100 wager returns $300 should the Indians win their first title since 1948. The implied odds at the SuperBook are 25 percent that Cleveland will win the World Series.</p>
<p>“It’s pretty crazy,” Kluber said. “To go almost three weeks without losing a game is not something that you ever really expect.”</p>
<p>The Indians are 89-56 on the year (.614). The Los Angeles Dodgers remain the best team in baseball (at least record speaking) at 93-52 (.641).</p>
<p>Dodgers End Skid</p>
<p>Owners of the best record in baseball, the Dodgers have been going in precisely the opposite direction as Cleveland. While the Indians have run off 20 in a row, the Dodgers entered Tuesday night’s game on an 11-game slide.</p>
<p>Fortunately for LA, their ace Clayton Kershaw was on the mound. Though the Dodgers were down 1-0 after three innings, a four-run 4th put Los Angeles ahead for good.</p>
<p>Despite their recent struggles, in the mind of the betting man, the Dodgers are still the favorite in the National League to win the World Series. The SuperBook has the Dodgers at 7-2, or +350. Oddsmakers are giving the team a 22.22 percent chance of winning the World Series.</p>
<p>The Washington Nationals and Houston Astros are next at 5-1, followed by the Boston Red Sox (8-1), defending title holders Chicago Cubs (10-1), and longshots New York Yankees and Arizona Diamondbacks at 12-1. The Colorado Rockies are also still somewhat in the picture at 20-1.</p>
<p>At the MLB All-Star break, the Dodgers were the ones at 3-1, and the Indians were at 7-1. Cleveland’s record was 47-40 at the midway point, while Los Angeles was at an MLB-best 61-29.</p>
<p>By the Numbers</p>
<p>If the Indians win on Wednesday against the Tigers, its 21-game win streak would tie the Chicago Cubs’ mark set in 1935. The Tribe’s historic run includes some very astonishing statistics, as the team isn’t just beating opponents, but destroying them.</p>
<p>Cleveland has outscored its foes 134-32 during the streak, its pitching staff holding teams to just 1.6 runs per game and striking out 183. The Indians have trailed just four innings out of 180, with the offense batting .309.</p>
<p>The Tribe has belted 39 homeruns during the span, five triples, and 47 doubles.</p>
