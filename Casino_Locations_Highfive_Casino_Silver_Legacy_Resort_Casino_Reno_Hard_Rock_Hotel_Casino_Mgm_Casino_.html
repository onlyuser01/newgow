    <h1>Casino Locations Highfive Casino Silver Legacy Resort Casino Reno Hard Rock Hotel Casino Mgm Casino</h1>

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>I've been playing on Evobet.com for an extended period without winning.</p>
<p>At the end of July, I won, and naturally wanted to withdraw the money.</p>
<p>On July 31, I submitted all the documentation they requested:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Proof of address</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Proof of ID/PASSPORT</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Proof of bank account</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Proof of the card I used for payment</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>After a few days, they came back and asked me for proof of all the cards I've used throughout my time on their site:</p>
<p>I supplemented with three additional Visa/Mastercard cards.</p>
<p>Then, I received an email last Wednesday saying that my account had been verified.</p>
<p>I made a withdrawal last Wednesday, and the next day they cancelled it, asking me for a selfie where I've written my name, my personal number, and the site I've played on (Evobet.com).</p>
<p>They have now approved the selfie document and the account should be verified.</p>
<p>I know that the withdrawal I'm about to make won't go through, they'll cancel it again and keep you running around in circles in all possible ways. This loop will not have an end, it will go on indefinitely.</p>
<p>I have been playing for 17 years and for this operator, there are no words.</p>
<p>I won't say more than that, but I am resilient.</p>
<p>I sincerely feel sorry for new players who start playing with these operators, they'll lose their patience and get a very distorted view of how the gaming industry works.</p>
