<p>Tightening Regulations Necessitate Enhanced Monitoring</p>
<p>Rapidly changing regulations can often catch operators unaware, resulting in potential breaches that can lead to significant fines and tarnish the company’s reputation. This problem is especially prevalent with companies operating in multiple jurisdictions, often sporting distinct regulatory challenges. Such a rapidly evolving landscape has caused many companies to seek third-party assistance, relying on professionals like VIXIO to track relevant changes and reveal new opportunities.</p>
<p>A recent GamblingNews interview with VIXIO senior gambling industry analyst Joe Ewens revealed the company’s stance on the upcoming UK white paper and the rising compliance burden on operators. He noted that such significant changes to a well-developed gaming market would undoubtedly cause local disturbances but were part of a worldwide push toward tightening regulations.</p>
<p>The reality is that all of the planned changes are just the latest developments in a story of tightening regulation over the past few years. Joe Ewens, VIXIO senior gambling industry analyst</p>
<p>The VIXIO Data Hub’s launch marks an important milestone for regulatory intelligence solutions. Organizations can use this newest tool to ensure compliance and make informed decisions in a rapidly evolving regulatory landscape. The growing need for comprehensive data coverage and advanced analytics capabilities means more operators will gravitate towards such third-party solutions, enabling them to stay ahead of the curve and confidently achieve their objectives.</p>
