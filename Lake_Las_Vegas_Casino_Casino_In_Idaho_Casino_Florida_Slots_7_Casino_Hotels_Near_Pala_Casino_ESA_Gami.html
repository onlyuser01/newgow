<p>ESA Gaming, a provider of innovative and lightweight iGaming content for the online casino industry, has teamed up with Kiron Interactive in a move that will allow the company to significantly strengthen its global exposure and give it another leg-up in its pursuit of new markets.</p>
<p>ESA Gaming is specifically putting forth its dedicated EasySwipe solution, which is already live across a number of regulated markets. As a Malta Gaming Authority (MGA) regulated entity, ESA Gaming has been able to deliver outstanding experiences through its unique FruitStaxx, Pirate Mine, and Goal Mine.</p>
<p>Kiron will tap into these products and add them to its own gaming platform which will make it much easier to deliver an outstanding portfolio to partners and leverage cross-sell capabilities to guarantee a seamless experience.</p>
<p>ESA Gaming Head of Marketing Thomas Smallwood welcomed the chance to be working with Kiron, arguing that the company has a very strong reach in globally regulated markets.</p>
<p>Smallwood said that EasySwipe is bound to enhance Kiron’s own standing and product offering, a sentiment shared by Kiron Interactive co-CEO Steven Spartinos who was equally receptive to the news, hailing it as an important milestone.</p>
<p>ESA Gaming’s EasySwipe portfolio offers a similar appeal to players looking for quick-resolution alternative betting experiences," Spartinos added. ESA Gaming has been indeed strengthening its presence in individual markets. The company launched in Nigeria with betBonanza in January this year.</p>
<p>Last year, the company rolled out in Tanzania, Mozambique, Zambia, and Kenya, demonstrating its commitment to the local iGaming market. ESA Gaming’s speciality lies in the delivery and development of super lightweight HTML5 games, which makes them ideal and easy to position in a variety of markets around the world.</p>
<p>The optimized graphics and platform make sit easier for ESA Gaming to successfully roll out its products in places where traditional suppliers may struggle.</p>
