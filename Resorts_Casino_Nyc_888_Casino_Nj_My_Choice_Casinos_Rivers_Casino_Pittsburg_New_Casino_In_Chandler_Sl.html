    <h1>Resorts Casino Nyc 888 Casino Nj My Choice Casinos Rivers Casino Pittsburg New Casino In Chandler Sl</h1>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>It's the primary and the ethical responsibility of any player to check the limitations and restrictions related to their country before they register on our site. This is quite clearly mentioned in our casino site terms in black and white.</p>
<p>We have published a clear list of the countries which are allowed and the ones that are restricted. You will see three different columns in that list which will tell you which column is for what. Any layman can easily understand that without any difficulty. The point here is that the player didn't check the site t&amp;c and applied rules related to that.</p>
<p>Given below is the required link:-</p>
<p>https://www.slots7casino.com/countries</p>
<p>Please check this link clearly. It gives you every piece of information in detail. Nothing is missed out over here.</p>
<p>1st column - Allowed to Play</p>
<p>tells you which countries are allowed to play and which are not</p>
<p>2nd column - Cashout from Free Welcome Bonuses</p>
<p>tells you about those countries who can cash out from the casino provided free chip</p>
<p>3rd column - Redeem ‘No Play No Max’ Bonuses</p>
<p>This in turn gives you a clear picture whether a player can make a deposit or can't make a deposit because no play no max bonuses are given only on the deposits made.</p>
<p>While there are several countries where cash outs are not given on any free chips, they are still open to sign up and just play for fun. We cannot restrict them from playing on our site as they want to have fun and experience the games on our site. Some players are not allowed to play at all but still they come forward and sign up with us as they just want to have some fun. Now, we cannot stop these players from signing up as they want to experience the gaming on our site.</p>
<p>Our team had contacted this particular player who is from the restricted country Bulgaria by call. He clearly agreed for the rules mentioned on our site and asked for 2 days max time frame saying that he will take back the complaint and get it closed by casino guru.</p>
<p>If a player genuinely fulfills all the conditions in adherence to the laid down guidelines to get a pay out, we will be the first ones to run behind him/her and get them paid out at the earliest. If a player doesn't qualify for any pay out as per our site laid guidelines, then no matter what, under any circumstances, we will not give any pay out.</p>
<p>We have set certain guidelines and protocols in place and we will have to adhere to them for all the players. We have some standard rules which are in place right from the inception of our casino. we cannot modify or change our standard protocols for any player or for any casino review site. It's upto the player whether they want to adhere and follow our casino site rules.</p>
<p>We have framed and designed our protocols based on how we want to run our business. Our site terms and conditions will be in our control and will be laid as per our choice and as per our business policies.</p>
<p>@ Casino Guru ---</p>
<p>You as a representative / staff should only act as a mediator between the player and the casino site. You have to make sure that you are absolutely neutral to both the parties and must be unbiased and have no right to say or express something ill or defame the reputation of our casino site.</p>
<p>On the contrary, from the lines posted by you, it sounds like that you strongly want to support players without determining the facts and the rules no matter what.</p>
<p>You cannot act one sided and you have to be absolutely neutral.</p>
<p>We literally don't want to know from you as to how we have to run our business and frame our methodologies and policies. This is the last thing that we ever want to hear from you. You cannot dictate terms to us. Our site belongs to us and any decision related to it totally, wholely and solely vests with us.</p>
<p>If you cannot act accordingly in the interests of the casino in an unbiased manner, then please let us know and we will proceed further accordingly to stop this forever.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Slots7casino Support</p>
