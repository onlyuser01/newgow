<p>Blueprint Gaming and Banijay Brands extended their partnership and with it, Blueprint has further established itself as the world’s leading developer of the Deal or no Deal brand. Thanks to the new licensing deal between the two parties, Blueprint will be able to develop content under the format of this TV show. This is yet another massive development for Banijay, after the recently-formed partnership with Playtech.</p>
<p>The Next Installment Will Be Released in February</p>
<p>The renewed partnership between Banijay and Blueprint results in the instant development of new products. The first one is Deal or No Deal: Banker’s Bonanza, which will be released in February. Apart from that, Blueprint will be provided with many new global IPs and thus, expand its global reach and widen its slots portfolio.</p>
<p>Some of those global rights include Big Brother, Peaky Blinders, The Money Drop, Black Mirror, and the £100k Drop. Thanks to the success of Deal or No Deal titles in the UK, Blueprint is likely to create additional versions for Canada’s equivalent to Le Banquier.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Blueprint will continue to supply the UK land-based market with all of the branded games by Deal or No Deal. So far, the company has had massive success with Deal or No Deal What’s in Your Box, Deal or No Deal Lightning Spins, and Deal or No Deal Diamond Jackpots. These three titles are a massive success as many UK players enjoyed them.</p>
<p>Blueprint Considers The Deal Extension Vital in Future Development</p>
<p>The managing director of Blueprint Operations, David Puris, stated that as the Deal or No Deal brand continues to rise in popularity in the UK, the extended partnership between the two companies will be vital in Blueprint’s future development plans in which the company will be looking to build more customer-engaging products.</p>
<p>Blueprint Gaming’s head of commercial, Lauren Bradley, doubled down on the importance of Deal or No Deal by saying that it is a massive part of the company’s identity. That is why Blueprint is happy to extend its partnership with Banijay.</p>
<p>Bradley also added that apart from solidifying its market position in Europe and the UK, Blueprint will now be expanding its global reach, starting with the introduction of the Deal or No Deal titles in Canada. To make things even better, Blueprint will have additional IPs on their hands, which is something that the company is happy about.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the commercial director of Gaming and Gambling at Banijay Brands, Lex Scott, said that thanks to the success that Blueprint had over the years with the Deal or No Deal brand, extending the partnership is a no-brainer. Scott also added that the company is looking forward to the expansion, especially in Canada and the US.</p>
