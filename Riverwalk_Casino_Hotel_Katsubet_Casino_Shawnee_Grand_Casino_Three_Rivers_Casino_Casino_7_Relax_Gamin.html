<p>The leading iGaming aggregator and provider of unique casino games, Relax Gaming, announced the launch of its latest video slot title. The company confirmed on Tuesday it introduced Snake's Gold Dream Drop, an engaging slot that invites the players on a jungle adventure, granting a chance for significant prizes. As the name of the new game suggests, it marks the latest addition to Relax Gaming's popular Dream Drop portfolio.</p>
<p>Players of Snake's Gold Dream Drop have a chance to locate a stolen fortune while benefitting from thrilling features such as the Dream Drop Bonus and Free Spins. Offering an RTP of 94.00%, the new slot game features 5 reels and 4 rows. The slot game offers 10 fixed paylines and features a €0.20 minimum and €100 maximum bet.</p>
<p>The latest addition to the company's growing portfolio further expands its offering. Currently, Relax Gaming offers more than 4,000 casino titles, including fan-favorite and cutting-edge proprietary slots, along with a wide range of games from third-party providers.</p>
<p>Shelley Hannah, Relax Gaming's Chief Product Officer, was excited about the new addition to the company's Dream Drop portfolio. "Our range of Dream Drop titles simply goes from strength to strength with each release, and Snake’s Gold will undoubtedly be yet another fantastic addition to our portfolio," she explained in a statement released on October 24, 2023.</p>
<p>Hannah added that Snake's Gold Dream Drop offers a thrilling adventure and unique experiences for the players along with a chance for mouth-watering prizes. "I couldn’t be happier with our teams who have produced another engaging title as our Dream Drop portfolio continues to lead the way in the industry," she explained in conclusion.</p>
<p>Players of Relax Gaming's new slot game can activate jackpot symbols on any random spin. Once this feature is activated, there are only blanks and Dream Drop symbols on the reels. To activate the special Dream Drop Bonus, players need to hit five DD symbols. "After each spin, block symbols are removed while Dream Drop symbols drop to the bottom and remain in play," explains the iGaming developer. The spins will continue until the players fill one of the reels with Dream Drop symbols, allowing them to secure a relevant jackpot prize.</p>
<p>On the other hand, lucky players who land two special coins can tap into the thrilling Wild Reel feature. Players that land three or more bonus reels can benefit from further exciting prizes with a Free Spins bonus along with fixed Wild Reels, granting a chance for even greater payouts.</p>
