<p>Alleged Drug Kingpin/Casino Slots Money Launderer Flees After Sawing-Off Ankle Tag</p>

<p>According to authorities, Mostafa Baluch, 33, sawed-off a tracking device on his ankle and fled just days after he had been granted bail by a Sydney judge.</p>
<p>The former Australian restaurateur was arrested in June. He was allegedly part of a foiled plot to traffic three tons of cocaine with a street value of US$700 million into the country. Prosecutors describe Baluch as the “sole financier” of the operation.</p>
<p>His family owns the successful Cervo restaurant chain, based in Sydney’s northern beaches.</p>
<p>Baluch’s associate, Mende Rajkoski, was, until his recent arrest, the biggest slots player at the Star Sydney. He once gambled $US77 million on the machines in one week, despite having a minimal income.</p>
<p>The casino is under fire for failing to properly vet high rollers, some of whom are alleged to have ties to the criminal underworld.</p>
<p>Anger Over Bail Decision</p>
<p>New South Wales police minister David Elliot said he was “devastated” that Baluch was granted bail, against the advice of police.</p>
<p>“This guy was part of an international racket with levels of drugs we have never seen before,” Elliot alleged.</p>
<p>Baluch is now the subject of a nationwide manhunt. Police are investigating whether he may have left New South Wales on a private jet on the night of his disappearance. But they said on Monday they believed he was still in the country.</p>
<p>Authorities caught wind of Rajkoski’s unusual gambling habits at the Star last year. A subsequent investigation uncovered the plot to flood Sydney with cocaine and led police to Baluch and others.</p>
<p>Prosecutors have described the operation as a “significant transnational organized crime syndicate.”</p>
<p>Police Sting</p>
<p>In October, the US Navy intercepted two boats off the coast of Colombia carrying 870 kilos of cocaine. That was following a tip from Australian law enforcement. In April, the US Coast Guard seized a further 900 kilos from a boat off the coast of Ecuador.</p>
<p>Back in in New South Wales, police built a replica of the illicit cargo, which they delivered to a storage facility in Sydney. Rajkoski was arrested when he arrived to collect what he believed was the shipment.</p>
<p>The media storm around Baluch’s dramatic bid for freedom will heap more bad publicity on operator Star Entertainment. The company, Australian media claims, is accused of “enabling” money laundering.</p>
<p>Star’s shares plunged almost 23 percent last month following the publication of the allegations in several media outlets. That wiped almost $US740 million off its market cap.</p>
<p>Authorities have said the company will face a public inquiry into its operations.</p>
