<p>After securing a license for the Dutch iGaming market in March, Wazdan is finally happy to announce that it has launched its product portfolio in the Netherlands with the help of 777.nl. The company revealed the partnership on LinkedIn. This marks the 20th regulated market in which the iGaming supplier and developer is able to operate and where it has launched its products.</p>
<p>The partnership is important for Wazdan as it will allow the company to roll out a number of top-performing titles, including Power of Gods Hades, Sun of Fortune, Magic Spins, and many other games built on the company’s proprietary technology optimized for mobile play. Wazdan is also preparing a number of upcoming releases, among which Hot Slot Magic Bombs, Hot Slot Magic Pears, Sizzling Kingdom Bison, and others.</p>
<p>The company has confirmed in a press release that it will be launching with "Fruit Mania Deluxe, Great Book of Magic Deluxe, Larry the Leprechaun, Magic Fruits Deluxe, Magic Stars 3, Magic Stars 6, and Sizzling 777 Deluxe." Wazdan CCO Andrzej Hyla was particularly happy with this collaboration.</p>
<p>"This is a source of huge pride for us," the executive shared in an official media communication. He assured us that Wazdan’s games come with cutting-edge mechanics, many innovative features, and evocative &amp; gripping themes which will be a fitting addition to 777.nl’s offer.</p>
<p>A similar sentiment was shared by 777.nl Head of GamingJean-Christophe Choffray offered similar reasoning behind the deal. He said that Wazdan’s products provided players with great win potential and superb graphics. Choffray, just like Hyla, was pleased with the overall arrangement and saw it as an opportunity for both companies to continue improving their product offerings and positioning in the market.</p>
<p>Wazdan has been in the headlines these past months, as the company seeks to continue its global presence. The company partnered with Ruby Sevens Studios to launch its portfolio with Ruby Casino in the United States. Another important milestone was negotiated with the company this June when Wazdan signed a partnership with PressEnter, a prominent name in the iGaming industry.</p>
<p>The Netherlands has proven to be a particularly attractive market. The newly regulated iGaming industry in the country has attracted other big industry names, including NetEnt, which launched with Holland Casino several weeks ago.</p>
