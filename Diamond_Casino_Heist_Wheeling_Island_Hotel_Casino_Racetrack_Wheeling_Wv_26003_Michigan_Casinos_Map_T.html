<p>Following the shocking death of George Floyd, an African-American man in police custody who was held in a chokehold for eight minutes, the United States has been hit by a spate of riots. Amid those, boxing legend Floyd Mayweather said he would pay for Floyd’s funeral expenses.</p>
<p>Mayweather’s Agent Says Boxer to Pay for Floyd’s Funeral</p>
<p>With protests spreading to over 140 cities in the wake of George Floyd’s death, Las Vegas resident and boxing legend Floyd Mayweather has said that he will pay for Floyd’s funeral. Floyd died on May 25 while in Minneapolis police custody.</p>
<p>A video of his death emerged shortly after, showing a policeman pressing his knee on Floyd’s neck for eight straight minutes while the 46-year-old man kept repeating that he couldn’t breathe. Floyd passed away on his way to the hospital. He died over a $20 forged dollar bill.</p>
<p>The video, though, prompted an unprecedented backlash that has plunged the country into unseen riots, wrecking local businesses and leading to a violent confrontation between police officers and protestors, and shortly after the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak.</p>
<p>In light of these events, Mayweather has sought to cover Floyd’s funeral expenses with Leonard Ellerbe, CEO of Mayweather Promotions, confirming that the boxer is paying.</p>
<p>“He’ll probably get mad at me for saying that, but yes, Mayweather is definitely paying for the funeral,” Ellerbe told ESPN earlier this week.</p>
<p>How Floyd’s Death Inspired a Nation</p>
<p>With the death of African Americans by police being a particularly sensitive topic in the United States, the violent and misplaced way in which Minneapolis Officer Derek Chauvin treated Floyd, and which led to the latter’s death, has sparked the biggest backlash to date. Some have referred to what is happening as “race riots.”</p>
<p>While Chauvin and his partner were released from duty almost immediately, the anger at the act continued to mount not only in the United States but around the world. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey didn’t hesitate to vituperate last week why the man who killed George Floyd was not in jail?</p>
<p>Frey’s statement reflected a sentiment that much of American society shared in looking for justice in Floyd’s case. Torrents of accusations were directed on social media that the Minneapolis police are trying to cover up the case. However, no let-up has come in the intensity nor scale of protests around the country.</p>
<p>Floyd’s Memory Honored in Four Services</p>
<p>George Floyd’s family has said they will organize four memorial services for him, with the first held in Minneapolis on Thursday. A second service will be held in North Carolina on Saturday, and then, on Monday, the family is organizing the third one in Houston. A last memorial service will be hosted at The Fountain of Praise Church, held privately to George Floyd’s closest friends and family.</p>
