<p>Roar Digital’s BetMGM app launches in New Jersey</p>
<p>MGM excited to see its GVC joint-venture efforts begin to gather momentum</p>
<p>Roar Digital plans to see the company expand to other states</p>
<p>GVC Holdings and MGM Resort’s rebranded app, BetMGM, has launched. Roar Digital, the joint-venture between the companies, is hoping to gain more traction both in the Garden State and across the U.S.</p>
<p>Roar Digital Launches Rebranded Betting App in New Jersey</p>
<p>Roar Digital, a joint-venture between GVC Holdings and MGM Resorts, has launched its new online sports betting platform, BetMGM, in New Jersey. The app is effectively replacing an older iteration of the software by the name of PlayMGM that was introduced by the casino operator in 2017.</p>
<p>By rolling out the new app, Road Digital has been able to expand the offer of the software, including GVC’s own sportsbook, and MGM’s casino and poker games. The new solution introduces the ‘cash out’ function, which is designed to help players withdraw in-play wagers prior to an event’s end.</p>
<p>BetMGM has also brushed on its offer by boosting the overall functionality of the platform and adding a single wallet solution. As a result, players may use the same funds between the different sections of the app, as well as transfer money via PayPal, Play+ and Skrill.</p>
<p>The addition of PayPal for gambling activities is an interesting touch, as the payment processor largely left the country in 2006 when UIEGA was passed, but then returned in legalized markets, such as New Jersey.</p>
<p>Just in Time for the NFL</p>
<p>The app’s release coincides with the beginning of the American football season, which will help BetMGM rake in solid profit. The platform will use a variety of mechanism to achieve this, including boosted daily bets and various promotions – applicable to both the NFL as well as other sports. BetMGM intends to cover professional and collegiate athletic competitions, and specifically football.</p>
<p>Commenting on the occasion, MGM President of Interactive Gaming Scott Butera had this to say about the launch:</p>
<p>The mobile gaming industry’s future is on a steep incline – we are harnessing best in class mobile technology from Roar Digital, powered by GVC.</p>
<p>Mr. Butera continued by saying that he had expected GVC’s offer to be a significant upgrade to the existing MGM offer and to boost the overall presence of the brand in New Jersey as well as other state across the United States.</p>
<p>Buffalo Wild Wings and MGM Resorts International said their partnership, called Roar Digital, will offer a sports betting-style experience. https://t.co/KsNMqdQGIX — USA TODAY Money (@USATODAYmoney) September 5, 2019</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Roar Digital has been working hard to gain a further entry into the sports betting markets. A week ago, the company signed a partnership with Buffalo Wild Wings, a restaurant and sports bar chain. Together, the companies will be working on achieving a better coverage of the U.S. Market and expand their efforts to other legal states as well.</p>
<p>With the NFL and collegiate being one of the top draws for sports bettors in the United States from September through February, BetMGM is focusing its immediate efforts on the right segment for the best growth opportunities.</p>
