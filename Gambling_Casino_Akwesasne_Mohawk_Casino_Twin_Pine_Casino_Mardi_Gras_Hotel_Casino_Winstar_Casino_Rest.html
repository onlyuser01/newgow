    <h1>Gambling Casino Akwesasne Mohawk Casino Twin Pine Casino Mardi Gras Hotel Casino Winstar Casino Rest</h1>

<p>Dear Casinoguru,</p>
<p>We have concluded this case and the decision was made that the player and further involved accounts have been banned.</p>
<p>The main breach is covered by https://chipstars.bet/legal/terms-and-conditions</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>"If a user did not use their own funds to top up their bank accounts, crypto wallets and e wallets and/or does not use their own payment instruments, an enhanced due diligence procedure with Source of funds requests is mandated. If these documents are not provided within 2 weeks of their request, the account will be permanently closed and the deposited funds will be refunded to the origin of the funds if applicable. If the funds have been lost, this does not always apply and is subject to the payments teams decision as well as management."</p>
<p>Further, there was another account which was operated by the same device, playing the same games and using the same payment method which had provided false or ficitious details, the second account was not responsive to our requests and has been closed. There is no refund to be done, the player managed to withdraw more than he deposited with us.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Chipstars team.</p>
