<p>Efforts for the legalization of the activity were reignited by a coalition formed by professional sports teams from the state</p>
<p>Missouri is one of a handful of US states that are yet to legalize sports betting. Legislators in the state have previously shown support for the legalization of the activity, but efforts haven’t gained much traction. While previously, the House showed support for the legalization of wagering on sports, efforts halted in the Senate over arguments about the growing illegal retail sector across the state.</p>
<p>While efforts of lawmakers have previously stalled, professional sports teams in the state joined forces in support of the legalization of sports betting. A coalition, supported by professional sports teams in Missouri leads the efforts in legalizing sports wagering. This coalition includes St. Louis City, a soccer club, St. Louis Blues, a hockey team, as well as St. Louis Cardinals, a baseball team, who are leading the charge for the legalization.</p>
<p>Currently, the coalition has proposed eight ballot questions that will seek a response from voters in the state. Ultimately, the proposal calls for the legalization of retail and mobile sports wagering and the implementation of a 10% betting tax. If the activity is legalized, some $29 million is expected to be raised for education. The proposed legalization calls for the development of a $5 million problem gambling fund.</p>
<p>Despite the coalition’s plan, a report released by the St. Louis Post-Dispatch suggests that not everyone agrees with the legalization of sports wagering. Citing research, the report outlined data from a Remington Research Group survey that uncovered some 54% of 711 likely voters would oppose the legalization of sports betting. With only 26% voting in favor, 20% admitted they were not sure whether to support it or not.</p>
<p>Betting Legalization Is Still Far from Becoming a Reality</p>
<p>Supporters of the legalization of sports betting in Missouri would now need to select one out of the eight questions to be placed on the ballot. Yet, to include the question, supporters need to collect signatures of at least 170,000 residents across the state.</p>
<p>“I would be thrilled if we could get legislative action because then we wouldn’t have to do it. I’m hopeful, but I’m also being realistic.“ Bill DeWitt III, president of The Cardinals</p>
<p>The Cardinals’ president, Bill DeWitt III, said that the coalition’s next step is to discuss the proposed legalization with members of the gambling sector. After that, he said, they would consult on how to collect the necessary signatures. While DeWitt said that he hopes to see lawmakers act on the legalization of sports betting, he explained that he looks at the matter realistically.</p>
<p>The efforts toward legalization of sports betting come at a time when most US states have already legalized some form of the activity. According to data from the American Gaming Association, 37 US states and Washington DC offer sports betting, while less than a dozen states are yet to legalize the activity.</p>
