    <h1>Nevada Casino Casino Extreme Existing Player No Deposit Bonus Best No Deposit Bonus Online Casino Tw</h1>

<p>After depositing €100 I got a €100 bonus.</p>
<p>The bonus conditions state that the bonus turnover can only be achieved with stakes of up to €2.</p>
<p>At "My Bonuses" you can see how far you are with the conversion of this bonus amount.</p>
<p>Now it is like this, after my bonus turnover was 101%, the money was transferred to my withdrawable game account.</p>
<p>After I requested the withdrawal, my balance was at 0.00! However, the payout was also canceled.</p>
<p>The reason, I also played games over €2 during the bonus conversion.</p>
<p>However, I believe that games over €2 simply do not count towards bonus wagering. And thus only the games up to 2€ are counted for the conversion.</p>
<p>The casino now thinks that everything has been confiscated since I played over €2. I don't think that's right!</p>
<p>It would be understandable if the bonus turnover has not yet been reached, since over €2 was played from time to time, and that doesn't count.</p>
<p>But confiscating the entire balance because you once played higher than €2 is absolutely not okay!</p>
