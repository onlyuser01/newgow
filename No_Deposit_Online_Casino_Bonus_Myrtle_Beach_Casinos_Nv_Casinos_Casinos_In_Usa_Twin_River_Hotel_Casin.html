<p>Tigers, the newly set-up team that has been struggling to qualify for the Dota 2 Pro Circuit (DPC) ,just got a number of important additions to its roster. Mushi and Dendi, two legendary Dota players are joining the team captain, 1437, and his wards, in a bid to climb the summits of competitive Dota 2. Stiff competition lies ahead.</p>
<p>Tigers Add Dendi, Mushi and Prepare for DPC</p>
<p>Team Tigers is a fairly new organization, an offshoot from TNC Tigers. To say that they have been successful would be an exaggeration. Failing to make it to both Major and Minor events of the DPC, Tigers have been struggling.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, they have secured two important additions to their team’s roster, with Danil “Dendi” Ishutin and Chai “Mushi” Yee Fung joining Tigers in their ascent to glory. They will be starting by joining the open qualifiers for DreamLeague Season 11 on Thursday.</p>
<p>A long time rival to our players, now ally. Let’s welcome Danil "Dendi" Ishutin as the 5th member to join the Tigers family today! Bringing the team to a full roster. Fans of Tigers, we want to share this experience with you. Meet the new members of @tigers_dota . #roartigers pic.twitter.com/w75zbAg7yZ — Tigers (@tigers_dota) January 22, 2019</p>
<p>The roster now contains some of the best-known faces in the world of Dota, way before the game became a stand-alone title, including:</p>
<p>Danil “Dendi” Ishutin</p>
<p>Ishutin Chai “Mushi” Yee Fung</p>
<p>Yee Fung David “MoonMeander” Tan</p>
<p>Tan Kenny “Xepher” Deo</p>
<p>Deo Theeban “1437” Siva</p>
<p>Dendi’s addition to Tigers’ roster is most refreshing. It’s not just that an accomplished player will now step in to assist a team. Dendi has hundreds of thousands of fans globally, which will rise Tigers’ profile.</p>
<p>Mushi was also one of the newest additions to the team, joining as the dedicated “hard carry”. Mushi’s experience has taken him through multiple teams, including the local powerhouse Mineski, the Chinese esports giant EHOME, and others.</p>
<p>Today, we want to reveal the 4th member of Tigers. Please welcome Chai "Mushi" Yee Fung who will carry the banner and be part of the Tigers family. With years of experience in esports and titles under his belt, no doubt he will be a strong addition to the Team. #roartigers. pic.twitter.com/R6Nd0rVkPF — Tigers (@tigers_dota) January 20, 2019</p>
<p>Theeban “1437” Siva, the team’s captain, has long been playing with world-class players, including Artour “Arteezy” Babaev &amp; Clement Puppey” Ivanov. 1437’s even been mentoring the aforementioned, but it was admittedly the talent of Arteezy and Puppey that have won them world-wide renown.</p>
<p>What’s Dendi Hoping to Achieve?</p>
<p>Dendi’s joined a fairly low-profile team, but this needn’t be any reason for concern. The leadership of 1437 and proven track record of 1437 is enough to propel team well beyond any qualifier and into the neck-and-neck race for a final spot in a big event.</p>
<p>A little behind by now, Tigers will only now start to build their legacy. So far, there isn’t much footage capturing the gaming history of the team either, with Dendi and Mushi arriving in time for the DreamLeague Season 11 on Thursday.</p>
<p>If Tigers want to build from the grounds up, Malaysia is the sweet spot to achieve just that. The government vowed $2.4 million in fresh investment for esports.</p>
<p>Kuala Lumpur hosted the first Major event in Dota 2, and there are hundreds of thousands of esports fans in the country, playing either recreationally, semi-professionally, or pursuing a part-time career as streamers.</p>
<p>After the excitement of the Kuala Lumpur Major, the Dota 2 community has its gaze once again fixed on Malaysia.</p>
