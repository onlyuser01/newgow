<p>GambleAware and the UK Gambling Commission have announced a system stabilization fund designed to further tackle gambling harm. The initiative is launched at the behest of the former, with GambleAware now seeking to allocate part of regulatory settlement funding to help stabilize the system of gambling harm prevention, as well as assist with support and treatment, the organization said in a press statement.</p>
<p>Funding streams have been disrupted, GambleAware said, in light of a planned statutory levy that would demand from companies to pay a mandatory contribution to harm prevention and responsible gambling programs – now subject to public consultations. Donations contracted in the 2023/2024 fiscal year, the organization said in a previous update.</p>
<p>To address this, GambleAware is now accepting applications for its System Stabilization Fund which will allocate funds to organizations in England, Scotland, and Wales, to help mitigate the impact of contracted revenue streams in the short term. This measure is planned as a short-term solution to help stabilize the existing system and will run through March 31, 2024.</p>
<p>The first round of applications will be open between August 7, 2023 and August 21, 2023. Successful applications will receive an answer in September. The fund will focus on the continuation of existing programs, however, and organizations that want to pitch a new project or initiative will not be eligible for funding.</p>
<p>Commenting on this measure, GambleAware Chief Executive Zoë Osmond has said that the organization is fully behind plans for a statutory levy as outlined in the Government’s Gambling White Paper. Although the right call in the long-term, Osmond cautioned that the short-term results have not been ideal as the industry is preparing to transition to this new proposed levy.</p>
<p>She welcomed the Gambling Commission’s decision to assist with helping established projects and initiatives that may be affected by funding shortfall and ensure that they tide over the transition as they continue to help people impacted by gambling harm.</p>
<p>Companies and organizations that may apply for the funding would need to demonstrate that they meet at least one of five outlined outcomes. In short, these include "increase the awareness and understanding of the risks of gambling," "prevent gambling harm amongst individuals who are at risk," "reduce the legacy of gambling harm," "prevent escalation related to gambling harm," and not least, "ensure communities and individuals have access to the necessary services."</p>
<p>Applicants will also have to communicate to GambleAware also important metrics, such as the potential outcome and impact of their program, how they are going to approach and deliver the solutions, why the proposal is needed in the first place, the value for money, and not least – sustainability.</p>
