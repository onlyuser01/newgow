<p>The latest acquisition strengthens the company's global footprint and allows it to expand in the region</p>
<p>The leading digital sports media group, Better Collective, announced a new strategic acquisition, allowing it to strengthen its position within the South American region. The company confirmed details regarding the acquisition of Torcedores.com, a leading national Brazilian sports media platform. Expanding into the South American region marks a strategic move for Better Collective, considering the significant potential of the markets in the region. Thanks to the acquisition, the company will significantly expand its presence in Brazil.</p>
<p>The announcement comes after Better Collective confirmed its intention to invest further into the market and move into a new office located in Rio de Janeiro. The latest acquisition comes after last month, the company agreed to acquire multiple brands in Sweden, another strategic market. Bolstering its presence in Sweden, Better Collective agreed to acquire a handful of brands from Everysport Group in a deal with a price tag of €3.7 million ($4 million). This marked an important move for the company as it sought to expand its footprint on the Old Continent.</p>
<p>Now the acquisition of Torcedores.com further complements Better’s ongoing global expansion. By taking over the leading Brazilian sports media platform, the company anticipates reaching new customers and accessing some of the most passionate audiences around the globe. It’s no surprise that Brazilian sports fans are particularly fond of soccer, but other sports such as tennis, volleyball, basketball and even esports also enjoy strong popularity in the region.</p>
<p>Acquisition to Strengthen Better’s Presence in the Region</p>
<p>Over the last year, Torcedores.com has seen significant growth in Brazil, attracting more than 12 million sports fans on average per month. The leading sports media platform has a strong presence in the social media vertical, with a diverse following on TikTok, Twitter/X, Instagram, as well as YouTube. The platform reaches millions of passionate sports fans, delivering unique sports-focused content.</p>
<p>By taking over Torcedores.com, Better Collective will leverage its diverse tools and extensive experience to benefit from new revenue streams. This will be required as Torcedores.com has so far been monetizing through traditional advertising.</p>
<p>“To build a leading position, localization and strong media brands are key ingredients – acquiring Torcedores.com fits perfectly into that strategy.“ Simon Hovmand-Stilling, CEO of Better Collective South America</p>
<p>Simon Hovmand-Stilling, the CEO of Better Collective South America, said that the company is excited to see Torcedores.com become its first sports media brand for Brazil. He added: “The sports brand complements our strategic position in the region and will expand our reach and sports content production – which in turn will make us even more relevant to our partners.” Finally, Hovmand-Stilling highlighted the company’s plans to become a leading digital sports media group for the region, acknowledging that the acquisition complements this plan.</p>
