    <h1>Hard Rock Casino Florida Casino French Lick Rockford Il Casino Betsafe Casino Hard Rock Hollywood Ca</h1>

<p>Even if I can make a deposit, I cannot withdraw.</p>
<p>After clearing the betting conditions etc., even if I apply for withdrawal by the same method as the payment system, it is not paid, and when I go to the site, the payment is rejected.</p>
<p>Even if I receive support and reapply for it several times, it is rejected again and I do not pay.</p>
<p>If you repeat it, you will not be able to log in.</p>
<p>Login is NG with your email address, and you log in with your ID.</p>
<p>This time, when I apply for payment, I no longer receive the SMS code.</p>
<p>Support improvement plan</p>
<p>・ Clear cache</p>
<p>・ Replace the SIM card with another smartphone</p>
<p>Does not improve even if you do.</p>
<p>We have received SMS codes such as Ecopaise.</p>
<p>・ I don't know if it's the same series, but I can't receive the SMS code of 1x slot. In the same situation, I will also help 1x slot.</p>
<p>After that, there is no help for it, so even if you contact support, you will only receive an email to inform you of clearing your smartphone cache.</p>
<p>The exact amount of the dispute is 3247</p>
<p>JPY</p>
<p>I've been with support dozens of times, but I can't solve it, I think it requires the intervention of a third party.</p>
<p>Thank you for your support.</p>
