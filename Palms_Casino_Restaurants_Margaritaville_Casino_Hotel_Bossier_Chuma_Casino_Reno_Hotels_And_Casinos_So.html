<p>BGO Entertainment has selected industry veteran Mark Quayle as its new CEO, succeeding Andrew Bently who left in 2019.</p>
<p>Mark Quayle Joins BGO Entertainment as CEO</p>
<p>Multi-platform online gaming company BGO Entertainment has appointed Mark Quayle as its new CEO, stepping in the shoes of now-former CEO Andrew Bentley. The move is likely a part of BGO’s planned expansion into Gibraltar, especially with Quayle’s credentials.</p>
<p>Quayle is an industry veteran with over 17 years of experience in the gambling sector. Prior to joining BGO, he served as Head of UK Operations for Malta-based online gambling operator Kindred Group. He rose to the position back in May 2019.</p>
<p>Quayle joined Kindred Group in 2017 when the operator acquired UK online casino company 32Red for £175.6 million ($ 226.4 million). Up to that point, Quayle had been with 32Red for over nine years and was the company’s acting Director of Marketing Operations at the time of acquisition. It is important to note here that 32Red had a license to operate in Gibraltar.</p>
<p>However, Quayle’s nearly-a-decade-long career with 32Red was not his first foray into the gambling market. In fact, his career started all the way back in 2003 when he joined BetDirect. 32Red purchased the company three years later in 2006.</p>
<p>Quayle Confident And Looking Forward To Position</p>
<p>The industry veteran is joining BGO during a crucial time – the company is actively preparing to explore and grow in Gibraltar. Quayle’s eleven years with 32Red will be of significance for BGO.</p>
<p>On joining BGO, Quayle said he was looking forward to starting a new career chapter with the company. According to him, BGO is a successful brand with a great team and massive untapped potential. Despite this, he noted that leaving Kindred Group left him with a “heavy heart”.</p>
<p>In regard to the company’s venture into Gibraltar, Quayle said that BGO was heading into busy times. He explained that the company’s first step would be to open an office in Gibraltar and strengthen its workforce. Quayle is confident that BGO will be able to tap into the plentiful supply of outstanding local talent.</p>
<p>BGO’s management has welcomed Quayle into his new position as CEO. Co-Founder Alex Holt said that it was great to have Quayle on board. The company is excited and looking forward to working with him, Holt continued.</p>
<p>Holt also brought up Quayle’s stay with 32Red. According to him, Quayle was an integral and valued component of 32Red’s management team and for the company’s growth as a whole. “[…] we’re confident his experience with such a large casino operator will be a huge asset to BGO”, Holt said.</p>
