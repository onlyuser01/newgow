    <h1>American Place Casino Casino In Charleston West Virginia Maryland Live Social Casino The Strat Hotel</h1>

<p>I registered on their site on the 13th of May, I made 2 deposits in total (150eur on the 13th of May and 200eur a day later). When I earned 688euro my account was limited and my maximum bet was under 1euro so I decided to withdraw my funds. I uploaded ID document, which was approved and I requested a withdrawal. The withdrawal was rejected for following reason: Suspicious activities were detected (Screen1). I sent an email asking about those irregularities (Screen2) and got an answer that multiple different IP addresses were linked to my account (Screen3).</p>
<p>I've not used any VPN or anything like that, which I told them (Screen4), I checked my profile and in the "my sessions" tab there was only 1 IP address for the whole time that I was registered on their site. I got an answer saying "If you have not engaged in any suspicious activity, there is nothing to be afraid of. Your transaction will be concluded in a short time." and an hour later I got an email that my winnings got deducted (Screen5). They left my last deposit (200eur), but confiscated all winnings.</p>
<p>I have never logged in from different IP on their website, didn't use VPN, my logs clearly show that only 1 IP address was used (I will attach a video showing my logs if it's possible).</p>
<p>What's the most interesting is that in the last email about the money deduction, they told me that I used 30+ different VPN addresses within 20 days of my registration. The thing is that I was registered for 5 days.</p>
<p>If you have any questions to make the situation more clear, feel free. Looking at previous complaint from this casino, it looks like a common practice.</p>
