<p>Manchester United is sitting in the #4 place in the Premier League at the moment. However, in order to stay there, the Red Devils need to beat Burnley on Tuesday. Knowing that Burnley is at the very bottom of the Premier League table right now, one would assume that Manchester United is going to have an easy job at Turf Moore.</p>
<p>However, the Clarets are famously tough to break, especially when playing against big favorites. So far in the 2021-22 season, this team has managed to hold to a draw such heavyweights as Chelsea, Arsenal, and West Ham.</p>

<p>Burnley in a Desperate Need for Points</p>
<p>Things aren’t looking great for Burnley. After 19 games, they have only 13 points, which puts them at the bottom of the table. On the bright side, the Clarets have played three games fewer than Norwich, the closest team from the safe zone.</p>
<p>What this means is that Burnley has a pretty decent chance to get away from the pit. However, the Clarets need to start winning more points than usual for that to happen. This season, Burnley won only once, and it happened back in October.</p>
<p>They did manage to snap a point off several big teams, but they also failed to beat some underdogs. The reason for that is that, despite having superb defense, Burnley’s offense has been horrendous. With 16 goals in 19 games, they have the second-worst offense in the league.</p>
<p>However, they have a top 10 defense, with just 27 goals conceded so far. The best thing is that Burnley’s goalie Nick Pope has kept a clean sheet in the previous two games.</p>
<p>Tough Times for Man United</p>
<p>It was a horrible week for Manchester United. First, Mason Greenwood got arrested. Then, a few days later, the Red Devils suffered a shocking defeat to Middlesbrough in the FA Cup. The Red Devils lost the penalty shootout after 1-1 in regulation. Further, the game also saw Cristiano Ronaldo missing a penalty in the 20th minute.</p>
<p>The situation probably isn’t great in their locker room, but they need to pull themselves together ASAP in order to do well against Burnley. What’s giving them confidence is that they have a great record against this rival, having won seven of the previous ten Burnley vs Manchester United duels.</p>
<p>Still, we could see them fail to do so again. With Burnley “parking the bus” in front of the goal, Man United’s players are likely to struggle to find the net.</p>
<p>Picks: Burnley and Manchester United to draw; under 2.5 goals</p>
