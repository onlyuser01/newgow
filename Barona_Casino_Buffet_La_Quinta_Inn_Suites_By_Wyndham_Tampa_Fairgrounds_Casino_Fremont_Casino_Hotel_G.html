    <h1>Barona Casino Buffet La Quinta Inn Suites By Wyndham Tampa Fairgrounds Casino Fremont Casino Hotel G</h1>

<p>Hello I have been with bitstarz casino for a while now I have had withdrawals I the past and are normally very good. i submitted a cash out on the 13th of December it got approved really fast. Withdrawal back to my mastercard. I first contacted bitstarz on the 18th dec as my payment hadn't reflected in my account.</p>
<p>"We have now escalated this issue to the appropriate channels and this email serves a ticket for your support case handling. Any updates to your case will be added here as a reply." Email i received.</p>
<p>I contacted them again on the 21st dec for a follow-up received this back from them</p>
<p>"Our Payments Team have transferred the information about this transaction to the payment provider.</p>
<p>As soon as we receive a response we will be in touch.</p>
<p>We thank you for your cooperation."</p>
<p>Later that night I contacted live chat after reading the terms and conditions of the casino as I was concerned why it was taking so long they responded with this</p>
<p>"Yes, was checking your cashouts. They have all been processed on our end to your account."</p>
<p>It is now the 28th of December. Can you please follow this up thank you.</p>
