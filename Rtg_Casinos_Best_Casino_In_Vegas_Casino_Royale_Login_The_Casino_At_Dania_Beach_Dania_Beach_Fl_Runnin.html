<p>Windy Rose Jones, 23, is set to appear in Las Vegas Justice Court in May on two counts of felony grand larceny, according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal. She was booked Monday into the Clark County Detention Center and later released.</p>
<p>Jones is suspected of stealing a $37,000 Audemars Piguet Royal Oak watch from a man on Feb. 21 at the Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas. She also is accused of stealing a $45,000 Rolex Daytona watch from a different man on March 24, also at the Cosmopolitan.</p>
<p>The incidents were believed to have been prostitution-related, the newspaper reported.</p>
<p>The Cosmopolitan is a $4.1 billion luxury hotel-casino on the west side of the Strip. It towers over the older Jockey Club, just south of the Bellagio Las Vegas.</p>
<p>Possibly Drugged</p>
<p>In the February incident, the resort’s security officers phoned police when a hotel guest said he possibly had been drugged, according to an arrest report quoted in the newspaper. The man also said he was the victim of a theft.</p>
<p>The man reported having met a woman named Rosa at the Vesper bar in the Cosmopolitan. They went to his room together, ordered from room service, and drank margaritas, police said.</p>
<p>The man told police sex was never discussed. He said he did not remember much of the night. He fell asleep shortly after finishing his margarita, the police report states. The man told police he thought the woman might have drugged him.</p>
<p>The next morning, he noticed his $37,000 watch was missing. Also, he said cash totaling $1,500 had been stolen from his wallet.</p>
<p>The man told police “Rosa” had a tattoo of a lion on her thigh.</p>
<p>Expensive Watch Missing</p>
<p>On March 24, a different man met a woman in the Cosmopolitan casino and invited her to his room. They ordered room service. The man noticed a large tattoo of a lion or tiger tattooed on her leg, the newspaper reported.</p>
<p>After waking up the next day, the man discovered that his expensive Rolex watch and Apple iPhone 12 were gone. He told police he thought he had been drugged.</p>
<p>With this information, police viewed “multiple photos of Jones from multiple prostitution related ads on the internet,” the newspaper reported.</p>
<p>The photos showed Jones with a large lion tattoo on her upper leg,” according to police.</p>
<p>The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department arrested Jones on April 4. Authorities confirmed she had a lion tattoo on her leg.</p>
<p>In an unrelated incident, the Cosmopolitan was the site of a recent stabbing that led to an arrest. One man was hospitalized with three stab wounds, but is recovering.</p>
<p>The Cosmopolitan first opened in December 2010 as the the most expensive hotel-casino in Las Vegas history. When the $4.3 billion Resorts World Las Vegas opens this summer on the Strip, it will surpass the Cosmopolitan as the most expensive hotel-casino ever in Las Vegas.</p>
