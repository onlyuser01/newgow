<p>Bragg Gaming Group has secured another major milestone under its renewed leadership with the supplier obtaining a business-to-business remote gambling license from Gibraltar. This marks the latest geographical expansion for the company which has been one of the most relevant and respected studios and developers in the industry, with the new license allowing it to scale its offer even a notch further.</p>
<p>Bragg will benefit from this expansion by adding to its long list of certified jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom, Romania, Sweden, Belgium, Greece, and Malta. The supplier also recently expanded in Ontario, Canada, and several states in the United States, as the company is determined to scale its presence globally and deliver content to the world’s top-performing and most prominent operators.</p>
<p>Bragg Gaming Group Chief Operating Officer and President Lara Falzon has welcomed the news and added that Gibraltar is an important jurisdiction to the company’s future developments and ambitions.</p>
<p>"Together with the United Kingdom, Gibraltar is one of many key regulated markets that Bragg is keen to supply with its products. We have seen significant growth over the last few months, entering new markets and boosting our reach in established ones, and this license is an important milestone as we continue our journey," Falzon said.</p>
<p>Falzon said that Bragg was excited about the opportunities this new opportunity presented and said that she was excited to provide some of the world’s elite operators with Bragg’s in-house and third-party content. Bragg currently has a number of proprietary brands, including WildStreakGaming, Spin Games, Indigo Magic, Oryx Gaming, and Atomic Slot Lab, among others.</p>
<p>Bragg also provides its remote games server and Player Account Management solutions which have been equally popular with the company’s clients. Bragg Gaming recently changed its leadership with the appointment of Matevž Mazij who was appointed Chief Executive Officer at the end of September and replaced Yaniv Sherman, another industry veteran.</p>
<p>Apart from securing licenses to operate in individual jurisdictions, the company has also been working to team up with some of the most prominent iGaming operators in the industry, including PokerStars and 888, securing content alliances in key jurisdictions and thus reinforcing the company’s presence in those regions.</p>
