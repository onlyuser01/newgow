    <h1>Saratoga Casino Hotel Missouri Casino Live Casino Blackjack Winstar Casino In Thackerville Ok Gold S</h1>

<p>I deposited Â£30.00 on 1st july with no bonus and played ok no problems. When this deposit ran out I deposited another 30 but accepted a bonus . Not many games would load but I started playing some Boongo games . I found that the games would play ok until i got a bonus and received an error . The bonus would not load . I spoke to customer support a number of times thorught the day mainly being told there were technical issues that they were trying to fix and kept being told to try again later . This happened 5 times on 5 games . I was unable to play bonuses or free spins . I have screen shots of the games and the error message . I continued to play a different game until my balance reached zero then miraculously I tried the games again and the free spins and bonuses loaded but the winnings were not being added to my balance . I also have screen shots of these and what I won . When I contacted support they told me that because the bonus had been cancelled the winnings did not count . I have screenshots of the chat with the support agent . So basically while I had a balance the bonuses and free spins would not work I could not win to wager anything as most games would not load and only worked when I could not receive the funds . Do not accept bonuses because not only will you not I was advised in the chat that my real funds automatically become bonus funds so become part of the wagering or so it seems as some of the games were played with what I felt was real money before the bonus amount . I have tried uploading the screenshots but they are failing to upload .</p>
