<p>Wazdan, a provider of innovative slot games, has penned a new Europe-oriented agreement, expanding its presence in the region. The premium slots studio agreed to power the modern Latvian operator FeniBet with a rich selection of games.</p>
<p>Wazdan to Supply FeniBet with Content</p>
<p>The new deal will further strengthen Wazdan’s presence in Europe, helping its content reach new audiences. In the meantime, FeniBet will be able to engage its players with the studio’s exciting slots, which include many unique engaging features.</p>
<p>Per the agreement, ten games are already available to FeniBet customers in Latvia. Those include hits like Sizzling Eggs, 9 Coins, Magic Spins, Sizzling 777 Deluxe, Sizzling Kingdom: Bison, Hot Slot: 777 Crown, Power of Gods: Valhalla, 9 Lions, Telly Reals and Magic Fruits Deluxe.</p>
<p>By playing these titles, FeniBet customers can benefit from Wazdan’s proprietary features, which include mechanics such as Collect to Infinity, Cash Infinity and Hold the Jackpot. Players should stay tuned for further releases that will come at a later date.</p>
<p>Both Parties Seek to Engage Latvian Players</p>
<p>FeniBet is a fairlyh new Latvia-oriented gaming site that was founded this spring but already offers a rich selection of slots, live casino games and varied sports betting offerings. It is a brand operated by Admiralu klubs, one of the oldest gambling companies in the country. As such, FeniBet is a part of the wider Alfor ownership group.</p>
<p>Martins Opmanis, Alfor’s head of IT department, spoke about the launch of Wazdan products on FeniBet’s platform. He noted that delivering Wazdan’s content will help them experience some of the best titles that the current gaming market has to offer.</p>
<p>Opmanis added that Wazdan’s products are famed for their unique and exciting engagement-boosting features and imaginative atmospheres. Because of that, he is sure that Latvian fans are going to love the provider’s games.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Andrzej Hyla, Wazdan’s chief commercial officer, said that his team is thrilled to join forces with FeniBet in a bid to expand its Latvian presence. He said that his team believes Latvia to be an exciting market that holds huge potential. In addition, it will help Wazdan expand its global footprint.</p>
<p>The deal allows us to maintain our impressive growth trajectory and continue expanding our global presence, while providing the operator with some of our most exhilarating slot products. Andrzej Hyla, CCO, Wazdan</p>
<p>While the agreement will expand the supplier’s presence in Latvia, it is not its first deal in the country. Wazdan already has existing agreements with brands such as Play North, Seasame and Star Casino.</p>
