    <h1>Isle Casino Hotel Bettendorf Horseshoe Casino Tunica Mississippi Valley View Casino Hotel Grand Casi</h1>

<p>Dear Casinoguru,</p>
<p>Sadly I have been facing a gambling addiction for the past 2 years.</p>
<p>I managed to quit gambling for over a year.</p>
<p>I returned last weekend to Stake.com after I recieved some promotional emails with christmas events from Stake.</p>
<p>Even though I already had 2 accounts banned on Stake for problem gambling. The fact that they know about my gambling issue, and still keep spamming my inbox with bonusses &amp; promotional material is unacceptable.</p>
<p>After reading multiple reviews on Tristpilot it is clear to me they are taking advantage of problem gamblers, and people from restricted country's.</p>
<p>What they do is the following; you will not be asked to complete any KYC procedure upon depositing any amount.</p>
<p>However if you are lucky enough to get your overall stats in profit, they will happily ask you to complete the KYC procedure.</p>
<p>Stake says they care about problem gambling and underage gambling. They have proven that is not true. If they truly cared about problem gamblers they would not keep sending promotional emails to an account banned for problem gambling. If they truly cared about underage players and players from restricted country's they would implement KYC procedure upon registering or depositing. Stake sadly only cares about the money and are certainly not aware to the damage and suffering they are causing to customers and their loved ones.</p>
<p>I am sure I have forgotten a few other unfair treatments by Stake, but I am sure I will be able to add this in a later stage of the complaint.</p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to read my complaint.</p>
