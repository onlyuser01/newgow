    <h1>Lucky Red Casino No Deposit Bonus Ladyluck Casino Shelbyville Casino Indiana Oak Grove Casino Hinkle</h1>

<p>So a couple days ago I was playing on 7bit casino I was given 50 free spins as part as a deposit bonus. So I win around 2000 Dollars on free spins. So as I’m doing the ridiculous 40x play through I notice that even though I’m playing the bonus wagering games none of them are taking off from my play through. Now that little experiment alone has cost me around 500 dollars as now I’m down to about 1500. I decide to take a break and go and order groceries online so I can also prove I wasn’t even on the site because that’s what comes next in the story. I go back to play and all my money is gone from my bonus. So I ask customer service before I play anything what’s going on where’s my bonus money at? Silvia tells me oh I cancelled it! What the <strong>*</strong> my heart sank because I knew then and there they were gonna burn me out of my winnings! So I say I didn’t cancel it I haven’t even been online I can prove it can you show me the ip address it was cancelled from because it’s not showing up in my transaction history either that I cancelled it. No she says you cancelled be more careful next time! What ?? Like why would I cancel the bonus I was up 1500 dollars on? She won’t let me talk to anyone else absolutely refuses to transfer me to a supervisor which I have all documented and keeps telling me I cancelled but can’t show me where and what address it was cancelled from. So the next day I asked again to get the same run around from Michael this time telling me I cancelled it then all of a sudden they are having issues with their chat and he will get back to me via email. So I wait another day and I get an email basically telling me the same thing I cancelled it and they are t gonna do anything about it. Like it could be a software glitch but I think at this point it was intentional on their part like how many other people have they done this to? I really needed that money and for them just to take it back from me for no reason is just wrong!! Keep in mind I haven’t violated any rules and was actually a loyal customer of theirs for years till this. So players beware I wouldn’t spend time or money here because you could be next anyone could and they’ll just tell you you cancelled it when you know D am well you didn’t. So my goal is to make sure this doesn’t happen to anyone else and try to shut them down it isn’t right what they are doing I won that money fair and square and they should return it and let me finish my play through like I was but don’t think that’s gonna happen. And I can prove I wasn't on the casino let alone online I made a online order and have receipts to prove it and picked it up at the time of the allege canceling of the bonus but they are saying they cant see that but they know what browser everyone logs in with but cant tell what ip canceled the bonus feel like that's a lie i have a friend familiar with software and it can pretty much pull up any stat on every player in that casino at any given time and also cancel bonuses when you win too much or have the games lose and not take off from your playthrough like it was doing on mine and they wont even acknowledge that issue i brought up because if they aren't doing maliciously then they have a serious software glitch on their hands that you think they would want to know and fix either way to not happen to other players but refuse to listen to that they are so stuck on i canceled it when im telling them their is no way I could of because I was out picking up grocery's after i ordered them and once again i can prove this</p>
