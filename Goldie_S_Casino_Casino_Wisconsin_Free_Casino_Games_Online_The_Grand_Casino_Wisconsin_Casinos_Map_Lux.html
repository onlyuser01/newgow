    <h1>Goldie S Casino Casino Wisconsin Free Casino Games Online The Grand Casino Wisconsin Casinos Map Lux</h1>

<p>hi there,</p>
<p>I am a very understandable when it comes to this. But again you are wrong first off there were atleast 4-5 different people that told me the same thing I can tell you names if you like and these people are the same ones I’ve messaged a year ago so are they still in training. When I applied to withdraw why didn’t I get told then that my email was used more then once? And why would I use another name on another account if I only have the one ID. I just found it very suspicious that it took almost 2 weeks to withdraw and on the final day of withdrawl which was 15-12-2022 I was then told it was confiscated. I reasoned and reasoned in so many levels to understand why my withdrawl was refused but I’ve never gotten an straight answer</p>
<p>1st- I know many places that if you use more then one email address or number or whatever it will decline because it’s been used before</p>
<p>2nd- I was told from 11-15th December money was in the withdrawal process and then again it was released. I was told "your money has been released on the 14/12/22 and then again on the 15/12/22</p>
<p>3rd- I sent many emails explaining my side why didn’t I get told then that I have created more then one account? All I was asked was</p>
<p>who’s laloifi</p>
<p>can you send a screenshot of your account</p>
<p>which I did all this.</p>
<p>4th- I’ve withdrawn from here before why is it a problem now?</p>
<p>5th- I only tried to explain and ask why my money was confiscated yet I was told I was harassing you guys that is wrong I have all the emails from you guys.</p>
<p>all I wanted was to get that $5000 I won and then I would’ve left it but you guys are making me fight for it and go through all this just to get all these negative from every angle.</p>
