    <h1>Onieda Casino Walkers Bluff Casino Planet Hollywood Resort Casino Reviews Casino In Palm Springs How</h1>

<p>Spotlight Sports Group (SSG), a world-renowned content, technology, and media company, has announced a multi-year agreement with LiveScore Group. Thanks to this partnership, LiveScore Group’s Virgin Bet and LiveScore Bet businesses will benefit from the services offered by the company’s Superfeed product.</p>
<p>Superfeed Will Boost the Racing Product of Virgin Bet and LiveScore Bet</p>
<p>SSG launched Superfeed in April 2021 and its goal is to deliver insights from sports betting experts and thus, boost fan engagement. By using this product, LiveScore Bet and Virgin Bet will be able to add additional territories with time and increase their racing offerings. Additionally, they will be able to ingest Racing Post data from internationally-recognized races.</p>
<p>The head of UK and Ireland sales at SSG, Daniel Smith, spoke on the development and noted that Virgin Bet and LiveScore Bet are among the “most exciting brands in the industry” and that SSG is more than happy to partner with these two brands.</p>
<p>He added that the content provided by Racing Post has been the market’s number 1 horse racing coverage for more than 3 decades. Smith ended by saying that the partnership with the two brands will bring expansion as it will not bring just Irish and UK horse racing, but it will also add South African, the US, and French analysis.</p>
<p>Currently, Superfeed’s Racing Post content is available to customers in France, the UK, the US, Ireland, Hong Kong, UAE, and South Africa. More territories will be added in the coming period and the international content can be accessed via a single Superfeed integration.</p>
<p>LiveScore Bet and Virgin Bet’s sportsbook director, James McKay, stated that the Racing Post content adds a lot of value and influence and that is why he is excited to have it on the two brands. He added that thanks to the SSG partnership, the user experience will be “even more enjoyable.”</p>
<p>SSG Secured Massive Expansion in the US in Early 2022</p>
<p>SSG managed to expand its footprint in the rapidly-growing US betting market as it locked a partnership with Advance Local, a US media powerhouse. This agreement laid out that SSG will maximize Advance Local’s SEO and revenue by providing various local and national sports betting content including the latest scores, betting tools, integrated affiliation tools, as well as games.</p>
<p>Howard Kamen, the vice-president of sports betting and iGaming and Advance Local, praised SSG by saying that the company is able to drive engagement with its national and local content, but the one thing that makes the partnership exciting is the fact that the company creates a community with tools and games “to make sports fans smarter.”</p>
<p>SSG’s SVP, Rick Wolf, stated that the partnership with Advance Local is “more than just creating clickbait” and the tools that the company will provide Advance Local with will allow fans to have access to localized sports betting content.</p>
