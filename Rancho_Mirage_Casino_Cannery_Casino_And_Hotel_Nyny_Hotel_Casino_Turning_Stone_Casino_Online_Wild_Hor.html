<p>HappyBet Becomes Official Regional Partner of Inter Milan</p>
<p>FC Internazionale Milano, the soccer club also known as Inter Milan, announced a new partnership with HappyBet. The deal was revealed last week and sees the brand become an Official Regional Partner for the team.</p>
<p>Through the collaboration, the team will display the HappyBet brand on the Virtual Cam Carpets, as well as LED boards around the field during home games of the team at Stadio San Siro. This will be possible thanks to the innovative geolocation technology known as Digital Overlay that is used by the club. It is important to mention that only select countries in Europe will view the HappyBet brand on the Virtual Cam Carpets.</p>
<p>Inter Milano revealed that the new partnership will also bring exclusive initiatives. Those initiatives will further promote the HappyBet brand to the large fan base throughout the season.</p>
<p>The Team Inks More Key Agreements</p>
<p>Besides the new partnership with HappyBet, Inter Milan also recently inked an agreement with AYX, one of the leading sports brands in Asia. Similarly, the collaboration made AYX a Regional Partner for the soccer club.</p>
<p>Additionally, the team inked an agreement with the global icon of quality Italian excellence, Santa Margherita. The company strengthened its collaboration with the team after it was named an Official Wine Partner for Inter Milano last week.</p>
<p>On the other hand, HappyBet is a well-known and trusted brand within the Austrian and German markets. In fact, in May this year, HappyBet was integrated into Snaitech, which is Playtech’s Italian business arm. HappyBet has been quite busy striking new partnerships to help the brand reach more sports fans. Besides Inter Milano, the operator also inked a similar agreement with AC Milan back in August. With that in mind, AC Milan is one of Inter Milano’s biggest rivals.</p>
