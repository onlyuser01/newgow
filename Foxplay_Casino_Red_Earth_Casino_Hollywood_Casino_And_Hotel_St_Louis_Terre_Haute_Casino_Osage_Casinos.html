<p>Although the Division of Pari-Mutuel Wagering in Florida has given green light for Bayard Raceways relocation to a new facility in St. Augustine, the decision is challenged by Daytona Beach Kennel Club. Daytona filed a petition requesting an administrative hearing regarding the relocation.</p>
<p>Daytona Beach Kennel Club Files a Petition in Relocation Matter</p>
<p>Bayard Raceways’ plan to relocate its permit and open a facility along Interstate 95 southwest of St. Augustine, Florida may be obstructed by a legal dispute. The company previously used the permit for a dog track in northern St. Johns County and more recently in Clay County.</p>
<p>In July, Bayard Raceways asked the Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation to allow the relocation of the gambling permit to a new eight-acre site in St. Johns County. Consequently, in September, the Division of Pari-Mutuel Wagering’s director, Louis Trombetta, gave the green light for the relocation.</p>
<p>However, Daytona Beach Kennel Club, has challenged the government officials’ decision by filing a petition with the state Division of Administrative Hearings last week. The petition requests an administrative hearing and seeks a final order on the relocation, previously approved by the Division of Pari-Mutuel Wagering.</p>
<p>According to the court filing by Daytona, the Bayard Raceways’ new facility near St. Augustine is within 50 miles of Daytona Beach Racing and Card Club in Volusia County. This, according to Daytona’s filing will “substantially deteriorate DBKC’s revenue-producing capability”. Furthermore, the company also stressed that the distancing factor had to be considered as part of the relocation analysis, however it was “completely disregarded by the division.“</p>
<p>Hearing on the Case Is Set for Next Year</p>
<p>Responding to Daytona Beach Kennel Club’s filing, Bayard Raceways filed a notice of intervention with the Division of Administrative Hearings earlier this week. Bayard asked for a final order for dismissing the petition by Daytona Beach Kennel Club arguing that it was “lacking any basis in fact or law“.</p>
<p>Following the notice of intervention on the petition, on Thursday this week, the legal case was assigned to Administrative Law Judge Suzanne Van Wyk. Consequently, an online hearing on the case was set for January 27 and January 28 next year.</p>
