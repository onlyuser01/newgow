    <h1>Casino Hotels Biloxi Ms Twin Pine Casino Hotel Houston Casino Casinos In Indio William Hill Casino C</h1>

<p>In order to achieve a VIP status platinum, a player has to have played for an insane long time and often and has already made "real bets" in this casino. For this you should be rewarded on Sunday depending on your status.</p>
<p>With Vipstatus Platinum you get $ 150.00 Loyi on Sunday, which has to be converted with a turnover of $ 3750.00 and is deducted from the profit again with conversion with $ 150.00! As a rule, this is absolutely impossible to achieve anyway.</p>
<p>With Vipstatus Platinum you get 1 $ redeemed as point for 750 sales. To do this, it has to be checked in the transaction log. So you can tell whether you have reached the Loyi, i.e. the 4000.00 in sales that are required for the Loyi.</p>
<p>Since $ 1 is already reached at 900 instead of 1000 sales (VIP status platinum), you get one dollar at 900 sales.</p>
<p>You can see all of this in the transaction log, but unfortunately that's not enough for the casino. It is usually claimed, almost every Sunday, that sales for the Loyi have not been reached. Depending on who is in the chat and what mood they are in, these people decide whether or not to be accommodating and to give a proportionate loyalty. As a rule, only half of the Loyi is offered, although the Loyi has not even been reached up to 200 points, i.e. at around 3800 sales. It was different 2 years ago, because people like Vincent, Michaela etc. almost always gave full loyalty in this case, knowing full well that there would be no payment anyway !!!!</p>
<p>Today all employees except for Paul are prepared to give nothing more, zero goodwill. Although the player can prove to have reached the loyalty according to the transaction log.</p>
<p>So today (see attachment)</p>
<p>The chat was allegedly banned if you as a player asks whether the turnover has been reached, to give an answer, allegedly it no longer comes into the action. But on Sunday the chat tells exactly that you have only reached 3800 sales, for example. How does that work all at once? Why does Sunday come in and not during the week?</p>
<p>Is that a view to withhold the player that Loyi is facing? I say yes, because in my case it was already 4 times at the Europacsino, that of all things the turnover was only 3800, almost always the same amount? Bad tongues suggest something, should that actually be the case, that the casino knowingly and deliberately, the player withheld from Loyi? That would be a fraud ?!</p>
<p>Another Manco, shcon complained about for years, but no reaction from the casinos- The Loyi is only booked with $ 75.00, so half, it will not be corrected ?! Only after I ask in the chat will the other half be booked !? Why is the casino unable to finally enter the correct status?</p>
<p>More Manco, The VIP player always received a bonus of 100, sometimes even 150%, after the Loyi was achieved. Usually nothing comes today! Why ?</p>
<p>I could list a few more things, but I think that's enough. If you apparently want to play in safety, you should no longer use these casinos. These casinos only advertise new players, the old ones are neglected and even cheated!</p>
<p>Today the Chat Constanze offered me half a Loyi, but again I had the proof in the transaction log. That I met the sales, that's why I refused. But Erich later in the chat, rejects any form of goodwill! Why? Bad Sunday or arbitrariness?</p>
<p>I advise every long-time gambler in Tropez, as well as in the European casino, not to play for the Loyi anymore, because you will only be cheated and you won't get a payout anyway because the wagering requirements are much too high!</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>
<p>I will also publish this on the Internet B. at GURU and in the Casinoforum, if you can't find a proper solution!</p>
<p>You can here after rehcnen 6 times 675 sales = 4050 and weutere 340 sales have not yet been redeemed, but the sales for the Loyi were allegedly not reached. So it goes every Sunday! "</p>
