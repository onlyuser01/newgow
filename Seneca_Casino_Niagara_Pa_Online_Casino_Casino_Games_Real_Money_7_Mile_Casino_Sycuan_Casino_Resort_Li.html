<p>A new content partnership between Light &amp; Wonder and Grand Casino Luzern in Switzerland will allow both companies to significantly increase their scale of operation. The alliance will see Light &amp; Wonder roll out its games through its dedicated OpenGaming aggregation platform on the online Swiss market for the very first time, complementing its existing land-based offer.</p>
<p>To this end, Light &amp; Wonder will launch its content portfolio with mycasino, the online arm of Grand Casino Luzern, which is, in turn, one of the biggest and most respected land-based operators in the casino industry in the country. Mycasino was launched in August2019 and it has been quickly gaining steam through a series of content deals.</p>
<p>OpenGaming and Light &amp; Wonder have plenty of excellent games to offer to local gaming audiences in Switzerland, the company said in a press release. Among the titles that will now be part of the market are such options as Spartacus, RagingRhino and 88 Fortunes, all of which have been excellent and much sought-after games in other markets as well.</p>
<p>Commenting on this new opportunity, Light &amp; Wonder Managing Director Europe Magdalena Podhorska-Okolow said that the company was very interested in the Swiss iGaming market, which has been performing very well. She explained that Grand Casino Luzern is a very strong brand in Switzerland and one that has been gathering momentum. She added:</p>
<p>"We will be launching our OpenGaming aggregation platform with a wide variety of gaming content, allowing Grand Casino Luzern’s customers access to a comprehensive range of relevant, compelling entertainment."</p>
<p>Grand Casino Luzern CEO Wolfgang Bliem was similarly excited about this new content opportunity. He said that mycasino and Grand Casino Luzern in general was always on the lookout for the best possible casino games, and specifically those products that offer freshness and innovation.</p>
<p>Having Light &amp; Wonder enrich the casino’s portfolio would allow the company to continue delivering outstanding products. The entire team at mycasino and Grand Casino Luzern was now looking forward to seeing how Light &amp; Wonder’s products would perform in the market, and he thanked me for the opportunity to see mycasino become a gateway for the supplier into the country.</p>
<p>This is an important development for Light &amp; Wonder, as the company will significantly bolster its presence in regulated online gambling markets in Europe. A number of other companies have similarly teamed up with mycasino to offer content, among which Pragmatic Play. A similar partnership was negotiated between Apparat Gaming and the online casino as well.</p>
