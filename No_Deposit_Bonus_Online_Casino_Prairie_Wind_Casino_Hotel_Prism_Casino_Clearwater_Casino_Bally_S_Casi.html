    <h1>No Deposit Bonus Online Casino Prairie Wind Casino Hotel Prism Casino Clearwater Casino Bally S Casi</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Thank you for your response.</p>
<p>I can confirm that I did request that the account was closed, during a phone call - I think it was this February, but possibly March. The person that I spoke to confirmed that the account had been 'closed'. However, I have since managed to log into it, so it appears impossible to close the account permanently as one of their representatives informed me that you can self-exclude for a maximum of 30 days. This is an unacceptable practice and surely cannot be legal.</p>
<p>The account was created by my Son, who was 15 years old at the time. He used his debit card to deposit funds on numerous occasions, and gambled approximately £450. He informed me that he won over 400 Euros on one occasion, but he could not withdraw it as they required proof that the payment method belonged to the account holder. How can it be considered acceptable for these checks not to be conducted before you are allowed to gamble on their website? The fact that they can accept deposits from a card that’s details doesn’t match the account holder's, and belongs to an underage person is appalling.</p>
<p>As a result of this experience, my son, who is now 16 years old has experienced major gambling issues, as he lost all of his money and he is trying to win it back by young to extreme lengths to find outlets where he can gamble.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
