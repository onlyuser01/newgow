<p>FunFair Games has revealed its latest game which is touted as a next-generation installment in the supplier’s portfolio with “Hugo: Up &amp; Away” once again focusing on the multiplayer crash-game experience. The title is developed in partnership with 5th Planet Games, the IP owner.</p>
<p>More Innovative Crash-Game Experiences by FunFair</p>
<p>Hugo: UP &amp; Away introduces players to the familiar crash-game setting in which they get to play the popular character themselves as they steer him through storms and thunderous clouds so that they can collect more jewels while Hugo’s opponents are throwing TNT balloons and other perils at him.</p>
<p>The fact that players can enjoy the game in the company of others is an added benefit that makes this title truly shine. The maximum multiplier in the game is set at 2,500x, but watch out, because while the game tantalizes you to do your best and reach the farthest, you need to be aware of lightning and other round-ending conditions that will be coming your way.</p>
<p>The farther you make it, though, the more rewards you will claim, but they will all be lost unless you parachute on time and save Hugo and your newly acquired riches. Hugo became a popular franchise in its own right, and it has been particularly popular in video gaming. Thanks to the partnership between FunFair Games and 5th Planet Games, the character has found a new home in the crash-game vertical.</p>
<p>FunFair Games CEO Mark McGinley said that the Hugo franchise has gained a solid following and that FunFair was very happy to bring it to its portfolio of titles. He added:</p>
<p>“We’re delighted with the final product and have to thank 5th Planet Games for its support throughout the development process. We can’t wait for players to enjoy this vibrant title that combines elements from the original game show and harmonizes it with the thrilling crash game elements.</p>
<p>Beloved and Popular Character Crashes the Party</p>
<p>5th Planet Games CEO mark Stanger was equally thrilled with the opportunity to enrich the gaming space with Hugo’s presence and said that the original TV show has transcended its original design and found new homes. “</p>
<p>We couldn’t be happier with the result,” Stanger noted. Hugo is bound to appeal to fans both old and new and be a worthwhile addition to the FunFair Games’ portfolio which has focused on innovative iGaming experiences for everyone. FunFair Games just recently launched its products with the William Hill and Mr Green brands in the United Kingdom.</p>
