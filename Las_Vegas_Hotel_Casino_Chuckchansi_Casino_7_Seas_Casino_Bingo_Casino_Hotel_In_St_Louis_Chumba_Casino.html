    <h1>Las Vegas Hotel Casino Chuckchansi Casino 7 Seas Casino Bingo Casino Hotel In St Louis Chumba Casino</h1>

<p>At the start all was good, until I started winning more than I had deposited, once my withdrawals went higher than my deposits the trouble started..first they wanted to verify me with photo ID and verify my address, after sending in my NZ issued drivers license 6 times and being told it would not pass as photo I.d even though it states in the terms and conditions that a NZ issued drivers license is fine for id purposes. Once they realized I wasn't going to give up and that my next step was going to citizens advice they finally verified my I.d and my address. The very next day after being told I was verified, I received an email from skycity casino stating that I was not verified any longer and needed to send in my files again, so I did! Then because they couldn't keep doing this they decided it was time for me to prove my visa debit was actually mine, I did this and proved it was, then after this they wanted me to prove where I got my income, I sent them a bank statement for the ONLY account I used for topping up on ssc, this wasn't enough, they wanted verification of my personal information from my income provider. This all seemed too much with all the phishing scams going on, it felt like they were trying to get as much info about me as possible, like they want to steal my identity or something. Definitely do not recommend. ALSO being a NZ Casino you would expect their online chat help to be in NZ or atleast run by people who can speak the language, nope! Getting your point across to these people is like trying to p*ss into the wind! Messy and not a good experience. Ohh yes I should add that the reason all this happened was because I won $500 and wanted to withdraw it, if i had of withdrawn it it would of placed my withdrawls above my deposits and so they did everything they could to make sure I couldn't get my winnings, worst money I have EVER spent. Do not trust these guys they will screw you over as soon as you start winning. Please note I had no troubles withdrawing UNTIL my withdrawals got higher than my deposits!!!</p>
