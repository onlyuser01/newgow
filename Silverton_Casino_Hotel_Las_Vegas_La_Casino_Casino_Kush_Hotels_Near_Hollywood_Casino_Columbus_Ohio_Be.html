<p>Individuals who suffer from problem gambling often spend more than they can afford. In some cases, this problematic behavior can also result in legal action against them as some problem gamblers are willing to engage in criminal activities in order to get their hands on money that is later used to fuel their addiction.</p>
<p>A legal case against the leading gaming and betting operator, BetMGM, was filed a few years ago by a New York citizen, who claimed the gambling operator enticed him with lucrative bonuses despite his gambling addiction. The lawsuit was filed by Sam Antar, the nephew of Eddie Antar, the founder of the now-defunct “Crazy Eddie” electronics store chain.</p>
<p>In his lawsuit, he claimed BetMGM breached the New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act (CFA) by enticing him with different bonuses. Moreover, Antar alleged that he was enticed despite his gambling addiction which ultimately resulted in him losing nearly $30 million with the gambling operator.</p>
<p>Plaintiff Plans to Appeal</p>
<p>Last week, Antar’s lawsuit was dismissed by court due to suitability. US District Judge Madeline Cox Arleo sided with BetMGM, outlining that the Casino Control Act (CCA) supersedes the CFA, thus rejecting the claim that the operator breached the CFA. The January 31 ruling explained the Court will not “address most of Defendants’ arguments because, as Defendants correctly point out, Plaintiff’s CFA claim is preempted by the CCA and Plaintiff fails to state a negligence claim upon which relief can be granted.”</p>
<p>Moreover, Judge Arleo’s ruling outlined: “despite the inclusion of gambling addiction as a substance addiction disorder in the DSM 5, the New Jersey legislature, as the Court has already noted, has not yet seen fit to require casinos to prevent or stop inducing gambling from those that exhibit problem gambling behavior.” As a result, Antar’s legal claim was dismissed by the court.</p>
<p>Despite the decision, the case is far from over as an appeal is possible and this is Antar’s intention, according to a report released by US Bets. Moreover, Matthew Litt, his attorney, revealed he was “disappointed” with the latest decision. He explained: “The New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act is exactly the mechanism by which the New Jersey Legislature protects the consumers of the state of New Jersey.”</p>
