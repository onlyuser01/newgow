<p>The conflict between Caliplay and Playtech continues, as the former party undertook legal action in an effort to cancel its relationship with the supplier.</p>
<p>A joint venture of Playtech and Caliente, a Mexican gambling company, Caliplay is actively trying to cut its ties to Playtech, which continues to affect its business.</p>
<p>The development follows earlier legal orders that forced Playtech to continue providing software and services to Caliplay while canceling some of the supplier’s rights. As a result, Playtech had to continue its work with Caliplay while being unable to receive payments for its services.</p>
<p>In any case, Caliplay hopes to resolve the matter quickly. It promised to keep on working with Playtech on resolving the dispute.</p>
<p>Playtech Was Unaware of the Proceedings</p>
<p>Playtech eventually commented on the development, saying that it had previously been unaware of the legal proceedings in Mexico.</p>
<p>Whilst Caliplay has stated that the Mexican courts accepted jurisdiction on 28 August 2023, Playtech only became aware of the issuance of proceedings today.</p>
<p>Playtech statement</p>
<p>The company described its past relationship with Caliplay as “extremely productive for both parties” and called Caliplay a “highly valued customer.” Playtech added that it still lacks access to the court filings and has not been served with any proceedings yet.</p>
<p>Playtech concluded that it will review the matter once it secures access to the court filings and will provide an update to its shareholders if needed.</p>
<p>For reference, the original point of disagreement between the two companies refers to whether Caliplay still has the option to redeem the extra service fee as part of the strategic deal that the two companies had signed in 2014.</p>
<p>Other Playtech News</p>
<p>In other news, Playtech just unveiled a partnership agreement with Adjarabet, agreeing to supply the operator’s business in Georgia and Armenia with content. The launch in these markets highlighted the provider’s interest in supporting emerging markets and engaging an international audience of fans with content.</p>
<p>A few days ago, Playtech also strengthened its relationship with Buzz Bingo, extending it until 2031. The deal underscored the two companies’ commitment to offering players innovative and seamless gaming experiences.</p>
