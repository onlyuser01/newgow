<p>Reasons Why Sportsbooks Favor Jake Paul</p>
<p>Jake Paul is the favorite in this fight, but the odds have moved against him over the last couple of weeks. The reason is that bettors have started putting a lot of money into the Englishman. Nevertheless, oddsmakers still believe it’s the American who’s more likely to triumph.</p>
<p>The YouTuber-turned-pugilist is 6-0 in his professional career, with one win as an amateur boxer. Those who don’t have faith in Paul often point out that he hasn’t fought a pro boxer. Instead, he fought against a fellow YouTuber (AnEsonGib), a former basketball player (Nate Robinson), and two ex-MMA fighters (Tyron Woodley, and Anderson Silva).</p>
<p>50 year old Anderson silva beat a professional boxer and former world champion, even though he was washed up, But couldn't beat a youtuber and punched thin air? don't think tommy fury will be performing like this. pic.twitter.com/eoufTdG3pa — leejones (@gymdude_16) February 15, 2023</p>
<p>Paul’s fans, however, point out that he was brilliant in practically all of his pro bouts. The evidence is that he’s got four wins by KO/TKO and two by decision (one unanimous and one split decision win).</p>
<p>Tommy Fury Is Ready to Prove Doubters Wrong</p>
<p>Tyson Fury’s little brother is a professional boxer with an 8-0 record. Unlike Paul, Fury has fought against pro boxers in each of his bouts. Still, the fact is that none of them has a too impressive record. Nevertheless, Fury’s training footage shows that he’s a fine pugilist.</p>
<p>In fact, there are reports about Fury breaking the jaw of his sparring partner during a recent training session.</p>
<p>Speaking of the fight preparation, one mustn’t forget that Tommy is the younger brother of the world heavyweight champion. He comes from a boxing family and has been fighting since an early age. Paul, on the other hand, has only started taking this sport seriously after YouTube boxing became a thing a few years ago.</p>
<p>Jake Paul vs Tommy Fury Prediction</p>
<p>Tommy Fury might not be an elite boxer, but he is a professional who’s been fighting his whole life. Plus, being trained by John and Tyson Fury sure is a major advantage.</p>
<p>Fury seems confident he’s going to win, even promising he’d retire if he lost the fight. That said, we do think he’s going to beat Paul on Sunday, most likely by unanimous decision.</p>
<p>Picks: Tommy Fury to win by decision</p>
