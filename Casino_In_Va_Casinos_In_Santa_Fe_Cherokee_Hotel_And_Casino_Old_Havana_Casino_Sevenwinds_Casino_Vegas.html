<p>The new streaming agreement comes ahead of the season launch and is expected to engage with new and existing fans of the Vegas Golden Knights</p>
<p>The National Hockey League (NHL) franchise that is operated and owned by Black Knight Sports and Entertainment LLC, the Vegas Golden Knights, announced a new content streaming-focused partnership. The franchise confirmed Monday it joined forces with the sports streaming powerhouse, ViewLift. Under the terms of the new multi-year agreement, the company will stream all locally-broadcast games of the Golden Knights, enabling the team to reach fans across Nevada and nearby states.</p>
<p>Judging by a statement released by the Golden Knights, the new partnership kicks off with the opening of the new season, set to start a month from now, on September 24, 2023. ViewLift announced that in the coming weeks, it will unveil details regarding different features that NHL and sports fans will benefit from.</p>
<p>The new multi-year deal comes after a collaboration between the team and Scripps Sports. Under that deal, Scripps is expected to develop and distribute games via its local station, KMCC-TV, as well as via different TV platforms and on pay TV.</p>
<p>Per the new collaboration with the Golden Knights, ViewLift will bring team-branded content for a variety of channels, including Android and iOS devices, as well as Fire TV, Apple TV, Roku, Xbox and Vizio. The content is expected to include live games, along with other thrilling activations.</p>
<p>While this collaboration will help the Knights reach new clients, it also strengthens ViewLift’s position within the sports vertical. Previously, the company joined forces with other famous franchises, such as the Washington Capitals and has established itself as a leading NHL streaming provider.</p>

<p>ViewLift’s CEO, Rick Allen, shared his excitement about the new collaboration. He explained that the company is excited to join forces with the Stanley Cup champion for this new streaming agreement. “Our expertise delivering live sports across the OTT device world – including for the NHL and its teams – will ensure the best streaming experience for those fans, watching at home or on the go,” explained Allen in conclusion.</p>
<p>“We are honored to be the reigning Stanley Cup champion Vegas Golden Knights’ digital partner, and to work with the team and Scripps Sports to bring the action to all local VGK fans.“ Rick Allen, CEO at ViewLift</p>
<p>Kerry Bubolz, the Vegas Golden Knights’ team president and CEO, revealed that the collaboration with Scripps and ViewLift will enable the team to engage with new fans. “We will give our fans every possible option to interact with the team and watch hockey live and on-demand,” he added. Last but not least, Bubolz highlighted the importance of connecting with fans and said that the aforementioned agreements complement this goal.</p>
