<p>Leading global sports technology company Sportradar announced today a foundational partnership with the United States Football League (USFL) ahead of its official launch in April.</p>
<p>Measuring to the Gold Standard</p>
<p>The multi-year agreement between Sportradar and the new professional football league USFL that was signed following a competitive bid process designated the data and technology company as the Official Sports Data Partner of the league, as well as its official integrity partner.</p>
<p>“The USFL is thrilled to have forged its first data and integrity partnership with Sportradar. With more than 60% of American adults living in states where sports wagering is now legal, it was critical to the new USFL that we partner with the market leader in integrity solutions, and Sportradar is the gold standard to which all sports information businesses are measured.” Edward Hartman, Executive Vice President, Business Operations, USFL</p>
<p>The terms of the agreement stipulate that Sportradar will develop USFL’s data collection and delivery systems, including those for the league’s related businesses, to power advertising from betting operators during USFL telecasts.</p>
<p>Commenting on the agreement, Sportradar chief commercial officer Ed Blonk focused on the crucial role Sportradar’s “fast, accurate and reliable data” would play to help the USFL engage with its audience as the new league is seeking to establish itself on the US sports landscape.</p>
<p>“… with the backing of Sportradar’s industry-leading integrity services, the USFL is taking a proactive step to protect its brand and safeguard the league from match-fixing and betting-related corruption.” Ed Blonk, Chief Commercial Officer, Sportradar</p>
<p>As the league’s official integrity partner, Sportradar will deploy its Universal Fraud Detection System (UFDS) to conduct monitoring of betting activities around USFL’s matches and streamline reporting of suspicious behavior.</p>
<p>Besides the independently assessed and verified by recognized betting and integrity experts UFSD, Sportradar will conduct an audit of the USFL’s integrity policies, perform annual due diligence reporting and provide education and training to players, coaches and staff.</p>
<p>The USFL that is set to launch on April 16 will feature two divisions with four teams each that will play a 10-game schedule, followed by the best two in each division playing against each other in the semifinals to establish who is going to play in the championship match between the top teams from each division.</p>
<p>The USFL that will feature the teams of the Birmingham Stallions, Houston Gamblers, New Orleans Breakers, and Tampa Bay Bandits in the South Division, and the Michigan Panthers, Pittsburgh Maulers, New Jersey Generals, and Philadelphia Stars in the North Division, will play all regular-season games at Protective Stadium or Legion Field in Birmingham, Alabama. The USFL is set to hold a player selection meeting in mid-February and training camps will open on March 21.</p>
<p>The USFL’s product will be popularized through the league’s official media partners NBC Sports and FOX Sports, which already committed to carrying all 43 regular- and postseason games on NBC, FOX, FS1, USA Network, or Peacock.</p>
