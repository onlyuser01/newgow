<p>KSA moves forward with iGaming regulatory framework</p>
<p>The Netherlands will start accepting licenses on July 1, 2020</p>
<p>Bad actor clause could still apply</p>
<p>The Netherlands is finally scaling its gambling operations with the introduction of a regulated online gaming industry, the KSA chairman has announced.</p>
<p>KSA Passes Remote Gambling Act</p>
<p>The Netherlands is a step closer to a legalized iGaming industry after Kansspelautoriteit (KSA) chairman René Jansen announced new progress regarding the Remote Gambling Act, the piece of legislation that is expected to lay the framework for the industry. This continues the government’s efforts to establish a clear-cut framework for gambling activities in the country.</p>
<p>Jansen revealed on June 5, 2019 that the legislation is finally going to be enforced stating July 1, 2020, which will officially add the Netherlands as the next gaming destination in Europe. Come July, the regulator will begin accepting license applications and assigning permits.</p>
<p>KSA to Add Final Flourishes to iGaming</p>
<p>With the legislation nearly prepared in full, the KSA will need to work with the Ministry of Security and Justice to create the regulatory measures that will ensure customer safety and mandate taxation and rules of use.</p>
<p>Once there is an actual framework, the KSA will be able to flesh out the details of the license. The Dutch watchdog has been acting pre-preemptively, having already established a consumer protection initiative in Mach, 2018.</p>
<p>While preparations are still ongoing, the KSA has already asked interested parties to apply through the website so that the regulator can begin processing applicants now. Understandably, without a proper license framework, this is just preliminary work. Jansen was cited by iGaming Business saying:</p>
<p>It is important for the KSA to know how many licence applications we can expect in the future. This information will allow us to organise the licensing process properly. A smooth process is not only in our own interest but also in the interest of the companies that are going to apply for a licence.</p>
<p>He acknowledged that the KSA may indeed be too overwhelmed to process all applications and therefore the regulator would need to expand its staff to meet demand. Meanwhile, Speel Verantwoord Rutger-Jan Hebben, the chair of the Dutch iGaming operator association, has resigned from his position.</p>
<p>Hebben said that he has been pleased with the progress made over the last two years, allowing for the iGaming industry to finally begin shaping up in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>A Bad Actor Clause Still Looming Large</p>
<p>As the KSA prepares the licensing conditions, one question remains unchanged – how is the country’s future iGaming industry going to treat the so-called “bad actors”. For the sake of clarification, the Netherlands considers a bad actor any company that has been offering a gaming product to Dutch customers in the country without a proper license.</p>
<p>The Netherlands has already tangled with a number of casino operators over unregulated casino products. The KSA has issued fines for brands such as Betsson, Mr. Green, 1xBet and others. If the present legislation upholds the bad actor clause, then none of these operators would be allowed to apply for a license once the industry kicks off on July 1, 2020.</p>
