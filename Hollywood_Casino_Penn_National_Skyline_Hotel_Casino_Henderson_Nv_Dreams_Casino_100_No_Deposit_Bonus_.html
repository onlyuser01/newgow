<p>Kevin Ortzman Reportedly Out as Regional President for Caesars Atlantic City Under Cloud of Controversy</p>

<p>Kevin Ortzman — who was regional president for Bally’s Atlantic City, Caesars Atlantic City, and Harrah’s Resort Atlantic City — has left the influential Caesars Entertainment Corp. position he held for two years, unnamed sources told multiple news outlets.</p>

<p>Ortzman stopped working at Caesars Entertainment last week, the Press of Atlantic City reported. The news comes as the casino company is awaiting final approvals for its sale to a rival firm, Eldorado Resorts.</p>
<p>The New York Post broke the story on Tuesday, also claiming an ex-employee lawsuit triggered an “internal investigation” that led to Ortzman’s exit.</p>
<p>Jocelyn Agnellini-Allison, who was regional vice president of marketing for Caesars, sued Caesars Entertainment in federal court for wrongful termination. Agnellini-Allison alleged two employees, who reported to her, witnessed Ortzman “making out” with another employee after a work-related gathering in 2017, the Press reported.</p>
<p>Agnellini-Allison was later fired after working in a hostile environment, the lawsuit alleges. She further claimed she was retaliated against for calling attention to the romantic encounter between the male executive and subordinate.</p>
<p>Also, Agnellini-Allison’s direct superiors at Caesars were Regional Chief Marketing Officer Joseph Schatz and Ortzman. The attorney representing Agnellini-Allison, Lane Schiff, based in Philadelphia, declined to comment to Casino.org on reports of Ortzman’s departure.</p>
<p>Eldorado Resorts Pending Acquisition</p>
<p>Also, the change in leadership comes as Caesars is to be acquired by Eldorado Resorts for a $17.3 billion offer. The transaction still requires approvals from regulators and shareholders.</p>
<p>The new gaming company is likely to continue to be named Caesars. Caesars emerged from bankruptcy two years ago.</p>
<p>Eldorado is seeking $500 million in cost reductions as part of the Caesars’ deal. Bally’s in Atlantic City may survive, as Eldorado Resorts moves forward with the acquisition of Caesars Entertainment.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Ortzman could not be reached for comment. Caesars did not respond to a request for comment from Casino.org, and a company spokesman told the Press they do not comment on personnel matters.</p>
<p>Ortzman has also been president of the Casino Association of New Jersey (CANJ). That is a trade organization that represents the Atlantic City casino industry.</p>
<p>It is not clear if he remains at the top position of the association. Nor is it clear if he remains on New Jersey’s Casino Reinvestment Development Authority executive board.</p>
<p>Tourism Key Focus</p>
<p>The controversy comes as New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy (D) wants to grow tourism and see visitation increase by more than a quarter by 2023. Jeff Vasser, executive director for the New Jersey Division of Travel and Tourism, told the Press, Atlantic City is the state’s best asset in increasing visitation.</p>
<p>The Garden State welcomed nearly 111 million visitors last year, who spent more than $22 billion. Atlantic City was responsible for 43 percent of the overnight guests.</p>
<p>New Jersey also has seen visitation climb in each of the past five years. The state welcomed 89.24 million people in 2013, meaning last year marked a 24 percent jump in just five years.</p>
<p>Murphy wants another 25 percent gain by 2023. When he assumed office in January 2018, he announced the tourism goal as one of his priorities.</p>
<p>Atlantic City can improve on its convention business, Vasser adds. The days where people in neighboring states needed to travel to Atlantic City to find a slot machine are long gone, and diversifying the gaming town is viewed as one way to lure travelers and business people.</p>
