    <h1>Vivaro Casino Mississippi Casino Hotels Encore Casinos Casino Pier Photos Casino Supermarch Light Wo</h1>

<p>One of the world’s leading manufacturers of slot machines and online games has receive greenlight from its Board of Directors to proceeds with a listing in Australia</p>
<p>As a result, Light &amp; Wonder will now give more serious consideration to whether it should proceed with a secondary equity listing on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) after the company secured the backing of its Board.</p>
<p>Light &amp; Wonder Mulls Australian Stock Exchange Listing</p>
<p>The recent developments come more than two months after the company confirmed that it was interested in the prospect. However, the listing is just a secondary one, meaning that NASDAQ in New York will still remain the primary listing for the company. In a lengthy communique, Light &amp; Wonder outlined the opinion of the board on this potential development:</p>
<p>The Board believes there are substantial potential benefits for the Company and its shareholders in pursuing a secondary listing on the ASX, including enhancing the Company’s profile in Australia, one of the leading markets for the Company’s Gaming business, and providing the Company access to new long-term Australian institutional investors that would complement its strong existing base of shareholders in the US and Australia. Light &amp; Wonder Board of Directors</p>
<p>The prospect of a potential listing was present as part of the company’s first-quarter results for the period ended on March 31, 2023. The company has been toying with the idea of ASX listing for a very long while now. Light &amp; Wonder considered a similar move back in 2021 when the firm was still known as Scientific Gaming.</p>
<p>There are several reasons why this is the case. Light &amp; Wonder has been doing well since it transformed itself and spun off Scientific Games as an independent lottery games operation. In the meantime, the business remains well-established in the Australian market, and its products are known to local businesses and professionals, which can make it a strong bet on the stock market. However, further deliberations would be necessary before a listing is made official.</p>
<p>Strong Financials During First Quarter of 2023</p>
<p>The company saw very strong performance during the first quarter of the year, with gaming revenue increasing by 18% to $419 million. Gaming machine sales went up by 53% and SciPlay managed to bring in record revenue of $186 million, or an 18% gain on the previous period.</p>
<p>Light &amp; Wonder also reported record quarterly revenue in the iGaming vertical reaching $65 million, up 10% from last year. The milestones were welcomed by both Light &amp; Wonder CEO and President Matt Wilson and Company CFO Connie James.</p>
<p>Wilson said that the company was beginning 2023 on a very strong footing and that its double-digit revenue growth was likely to carry on in the next quarters. The company continues to develop and deliver a “robust product roadmap,” Wilson added, with the company continuing to acquire new talent, technology, and solutions to differentiate itself.</p>
<p>James was similarly happy with the results. The CFO noted that the company continues to bank on strong growth opportunities and deliver results that impact Light &amp; Wonder’s financial profile positively.</p>
