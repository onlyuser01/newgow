<p>The Philadelphia Eagles vs. Tampa Bay Buccaneers is the final game of the Wild Card Round. It’s played on Monday, January 15, 2024, at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa</p>
<p>After losing five of their last six games, the Philadelphia Eagles failed to win the division. On the bright side, their good run from the early stages of the season helped them book a wild-card ticket to the postseason.</p>
<p>Now, in the 2024 NFL Wild Card Round, they’re going to play against the winners of the NFC South Division, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Florida.</p>

<p>Philadelphia Eagles Coming to Florida to Grab a Win</p>
<p>The Philadelphia Eagles went 10-1 until December when they entered a horrible run. The run saw them lose five of the following six games, with their only win happening on Christmas Day against the New York Giants.</p>
<p>So, what’s been going on with the Birds from Philly? Their offensive team has been uninspiring, particularly their passing game. Excluding the game with the Giants in which QB Jalen Hurts threw for three TDs, Philly’s passing has been abysmal lately.</p>
<p>In the last four games, Hurts got a total of five passes intercepted, while in his most recent game, he threw for only 55 passing yards. On the bright side, he and his teammates have been doing alright running the ball. Hurts himself scored three rushing TDs in the last four games. Further, running back D’Andre Swift has been impressive throughout the season.</p>
<p>That said, it’s Philly’s wide receivers who need to step up in the playoffs. Unfortunately for the Eagles, both A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith are struggling with fitness.</p>
<p>All Eyes on Tampa’s Defense?</p>
<p>The Tampa Bay Buccaneers won the NFC South Division with a 9-8 record. They should consider themselves very lucky because the competition in their division wasn’t fierce at all. In fact, NFC South was arguably the least competitive division in the regular season.</p>
<p>But they now have playoffs to think about. Luck might have followed them in the regular season, but now, it’s up to them to show what they’ve got. So, what’s their strongest weapon? It’s their defense.</p>
<p>These guys finished the regular season in the shared sixth place on the list of the best NFL defenses, with just 19.1 points allowed per game. In comparison, the Eagles were allowing 25.2 PPG in the regular season.</p>
<p>Further, Tampa’s defense has really upped its game in the closing couple of weeks of the season. For instance, in the final week, they kept the Carolina Panthers to zero points. The bad news for the Bucs’ fans is that their offense hasn’t been as impressive. Against the hopeless Panthers, they scored only nine points.</p>
<p>Philadelphia Eagles vs. Tampa Bay Buccaneers Prediction</p>
<p>If you compare these two teams player-for-player, the Philadelphia Eagles look way, way better. However, their recent form has been horrible, which explains why the NFL odds aren’t even more in their favor. Right now, they’re 3-point favorites, but we think they’ve got the manpower to cover the spread easily.</p>
<p>Pick: Philadelphia Eagles -3.0</p>
