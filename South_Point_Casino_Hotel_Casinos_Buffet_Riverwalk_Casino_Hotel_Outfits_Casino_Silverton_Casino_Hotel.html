    <h1>South Point Casino Hotel Casinos Buffet Riverwalk Casino Hotel Outfits Casino Silverton Casino Hotel</h1>

<p>December 2020</p>
<p>Win $ 5,000 from the no deposit bonus and apply for a bonus withdrawal limit of $ 100</p>
<p>(Prohibited games, number of bets, prohibited acts, etc. have all been confirmed)</p>
<p>You will be asked to fill out a driver's license, address confirmation documents, and a PDF form dedicated to withdrawal applications and submit it.</p>
<p>January 2021</p>
<p>Inquiry because the withdrawal application was rejected</p>
<p>I was asked for a set of documents again, so tell me that I submitted it last time</p>
<p>After that, I emailed several times and was asked to submit a selfie with my driver's license and the newspaper with the date of the day, so I submitted it and applied for withdrawal again.</p>
<p>Around May 2021</p>
<p>It is said that KYC has not been completed again, and you are required to submit a driver's license, address confirmation documents, and PDF form for application.</p>
<p>I told him that I had already submitted it, but I kept saying that KYC was not completed, so I submitted the documents again.</p>
<p>I will inquire because it will not progress even in September, but it is still unsolved</p>
