<p>Slingo Rainbow Riches review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>The Rainbow Riches franchise is a well-established set of slots with an Irish theme centred around the idea of Leprechauns and the pot of gold they keep stashed at the end of the rainbow.</p>
<p>In Slingo Rainbow Riches, that theme is overlaid onto Slingo’s bingo style software.</p>
<p>It’s still all the classic style of Rainbow Riches, but with a completely different gameplay. For those who love the familiar atmosphere but are still looking for something to keep it a bit fresh.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The graphics on Slingo Rainbow Riches are excellent. The Slingo software lends itself to interesting designs. The verdant green of the Irish countryside is retained here, while the old symbols and fonts have been repurposed to work with the new style.</p>
<p>The music and soundtrack are pleasant and not too irritating, and the win and spin sounds are on theme and timed well.</p>
<p>Animations are a little simpler than in the other games as the grid format has mostly numbers rather than symbols for the animators to play with, but the slot remains visually top notch.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>The grid is randomised with numbers between 1 and 75 in each square of a five-by-five grid.</p>
<p>The player spins the Bingo spinner and a row of numbers and symbols appear at the bottom of the screen, one for each column of the grid. If the number from the spinner matches any of the numbers in that column, the number is starred out.</p>
<p>The player is awarded prizes for the number of horizontal or vertical lines of five they successfully star out, starting at five filled lines. Less than five lines means game over, unless you are willing to buy extra spins.</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>Because of the unusual gameplay, the idea of Bonuses, Wilds and Free Spins work slightly differently.</p>
<p>Wilds allow the player to select any number in the column it lands under, while free spins, add a ball to the bingo spinner.</p>
<p>There are no bonus games.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 95.6%, a bit below our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.50 up to a maximum of $/£/€100.00 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is medium, which makes it a poor match for our preferred slot machine strategies. If the RTP was higher, we might be willing to overlook this, but when combined low-RTP and lower volatilities make for a bad combination.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Slingo Rainbow Riches is a high quality slot at the design level. The graphics are lovely, the theme familiar, the style cartoonish and engaging.</p>
<p>But under the hood a combination of low RTP and medium volatility make it expensive to play, and useless to work with our strategies.</p>
<p>We do not recommend this slot.</p>
