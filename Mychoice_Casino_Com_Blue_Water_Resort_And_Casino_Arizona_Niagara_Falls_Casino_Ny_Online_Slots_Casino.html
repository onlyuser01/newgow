<p>Genesis Island Slot Review</p>
<p>Genesis Island is a 5×3 video slot with 20 pay lines released by Genesis Gaming in 2021. The leading provider with over a decade of experience in the industry chose the popular King Kong/lost in jungle theme as a main point of focus for its new game.</p>
<p>If you are ready to learn all about the game that is packed with scatters, free spins, and wild symbols and watch the almighty Tyrannosaurus Rex or the colossal Godzilla make an appearance on the grid, keep reading. We have compiled a comprehensive slot review for you to teach you all you need to know about the theme, storyline, graphics, animations, sounds, gameplay, and features.</p>
<p>Theme, Storyline, and Graphics: Explore the Jungle with Godzilla and T-Rex</p>
<p>While the interesting and immersive jungle theme has oftentimes made an appearance in lots of popular slots online, the way Genesis Gaming chose to embed it in this title is definitely one successful way of grabbing the attention of many players. The action is set on an island with a luscious, thick jungle packed with wild and fierce animals which also represent the main characters in the game. The jungle scenery is interrupted by a vast valley where we immediately notice a giant volcano in the background, with black smoke coming out in the horizon as giant creatures that resemble birds are noticed circling overhead in the gloomy sky.</p>
<p>The top-quality graphics are spectacular to watch and explore as the game gradually unfolds on the reels. Ranging from the massive 3D gorilla with its mouth wide open part of the interface that creates an excellent cinematic view to the iconic T-Rex and the rest of the jungle animals that switch from one to another, the theme and overall graphic elements are spectacular to look at.</p>
<p>Besides the high-definition graphics, the game also displays a series of additional features that significantly boost the attributes of the slot. We are now speaking about the available customization icons such as the game settings that enable players to easily adjust the brightness, music, game sounds, and overall quality of the image in the game.</p>
<p>Genesis Island: Game Symbols and Payouts</p>
<p>The most eye-catching symbol in the game is represented by Godzilla which also awards the highest payouts when a minimum of five icons are seen landing on a reel. This same symbol can also engage two different bonus features with cash reward bonuses and free spins.</p>
<p>The wild is represented by the Gorilla symbol. The wild brings players a significant amount when it is seen three times on the mid-reel, which is also the time when the bonus feature is engaged. During this round, players get a 20x multiplier for just one spin. The T-Rex symbol brings free spins when a minimum of five icons are seen showing up on the same reel.</p>
<p>The monster icon turns into the scatter in the game once it is seen landing three times on the first and second reels. Once the transition takes place and the new monster scatters icons are seen on the reels, they also introduce new symbols and automatically increase players’ odds of winning. The grid is also covered in the standard royal card symbols (A, K, Q, J, 10). These are also the low-paying symbols but they also have a more lucrative side when they award bonus features. For example, matching at least five card symbols on the first, the second, or the fight reel will trigger the gamble game. The latter provides players with free spin bonuses along with a bonus game that enables free betting on all pay lines.</p>
<p>Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The upbeat music and dark tribal drum sounds perfectly match the animations and the overall theme of the game. The animations nicely complement the action on the reels and perfectly match the selected theme.</p>
<p>Genesis Island Gameplay</p>
<p>Gameplay is smooth and easy with the main play button to the left, a main hamburger menu with the paytable and information on the game features, the autoplay alternative, and the +/- betting tabs at the bottom for easy access to all the necessary information to get started.</p>
<p>The game determines the prize value from a payline by simply dividing the total bet by the number of pay lines that the players have chosen to play, then multiplying it by the symbol’s win multiplier displayed under the Symbols &amp; Pay Value section on the Paytable.</p>
<p>The game only pays the highest win on a line. Also, when wins occur on more than one line, all win values are summed.</p>
<p>Players can choose 10, 50, 100, 250, or an infinite number of automatic spins.</p>
<p>Genesis Island: Mega Reel, Primal Wilds &amp; Evolution Mega Spins</p>
<p>The main features in the game are the Mega Reel, the Primal Wilds, and the Evolution Mega Spins.</p>
<p>Mega Reel – here, the reels will mix to generate a two-reel or a three-reel mega reel. When this occurs, all the high-paying symbols and the wild symbols turn into 2×2 and 3×3 mega symbols based on the size of the mega reel. The mega reel can randomly pop up during the base game. During the bonus round, the mega reels can show up on any free spin.</p>
<p>Primal Wilds – players receive these randomly while engaged in the base game as well as during the bonus rounds. Up to two reels can turn into full wilds. Players can match both primal wilds and mega reels during the same spin.</p>
<p>Evolution Mega Spins – landing a full 3×3 scatter in a three-reel mega reel, you will activate a free spins round in which you are given ten free spins. Each spin awards a new mega reel. Completing an entire 3×3 scatter within this round will automatically bring ten more free spins to players.</p>
<p>Final Thoughts</p>
<p>With mesmerizing graphics, designs, and animations, a popular Godzilla/lost island theme set in place, excellent music, and simple and smooth gameplay with plenty of free spins and multipliers to keep the fun going and the wins rolling, Genesis Island is definitely an interesting 5×3 slot from Genesis Gaming worth your attention.</p>
