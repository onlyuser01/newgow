    <h1>Raging Bull Casino No Deposit Bonus Codes Online Casino Ohio Pala Resort And Casino Wyoming Casinos</h1>

<p>The leading provider of games for the online gambling industry, Spinomenal, announced the release of its newest slot game. On Monday, the company revealed it expanded further its popular Queen of Elements series with the addition of Queen of Water. As the name of the slot suggests, it invites the players on a thrilling aquatic adventure into the depths of the ocean.</p>
<p>Elevating the excitement for the online players further, the new Queen of Water slot incorporates a fantasy theme and brings engaging and rewarding features, including Free Spins and Bonus Buy. The recently released slot creates an immersive atmosphere thanks to quality animations and sound effects, backed by an engaging soundtrack.</p>
<p>Omer Henya, Spinomenal's CTO, shared his excitement about the latest slot in a statement released on September 18, 2023. He pointed out: "Queen of Water combines compelling gameplay with impressive features, creating an engaging experience that’s as memorizing as the ocean’s tides."</p>
<p>The newly released slot game comes after Spinomenal grew its European footprint thanks to a partnership with the leading online gambling operator, Casino777. That partnership was announced earlier this month and saw the iGaming content supplier agree to deliver games for the operator, powering its offering in different markets.</p>
<p>At the time of the announcement, Spinomenal confirmed that its games will be integrated with Casino777 thanks to Light &amp; Wonder's OpenGaming platform. Consequently, customers of the operator in Belgium and the Netherlands gained access to thrilling games from Spinomenal.</p>
<p>When it comes to the latest release, Queen of Water, the new slot game uses standard card symbols between 10 and Ace. Additionally, the slot brings medium symbols such as starfish, jellyfish and the Queen's tiara, among other ocean-themed symbols.</p>
<p>Spinomenal's recent slot game uses the Queen of Water as a Wild symbol that has the ability to replace any symbol with the exception of bonus and free spins symbols. "By landing five Wild symbols on a winning line multiplies the player bet per line by x2000," explains the content provider.</p>
<p>More engaging features offered by Queen of Water include the synchronized reels. During each spin of the base game, two random reels can sync up and display identical symbols. This grants a chance for mouth-watering prizes. Lucky players who land a Wild on those reels can benefit from further prizes.</p>
<p>Players who land three or more free spins symbols can benefit from 10 free spins. Landing wilds during the free spins round can further amplify the excitement and chance for securing wins.</p>
