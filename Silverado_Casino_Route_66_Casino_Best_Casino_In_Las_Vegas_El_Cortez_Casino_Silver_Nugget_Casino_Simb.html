    <h1>Silverado Casino Route 66 Casino Best Casino In Las Vegas El Cortez Casino Silver Nugget Casino Simb</h1>

<p>I put £10 on my account as a welcome bonus and i got 50 free spins, i read all t&amp;cs prior to accepting this, it stated this was a 65x wagering and it stated "whenever the wagering requirements are met" you can then withdraw.. this didnt state any time scale or nothing so i started playing. Got my account upto £100 so i decided to then go into cashier to check how much wagering i had left but i couldnt as a message popped up stating "my account is being verified" so this would not let me check or anything.. so i emailed the company asking whats happening as i need to check wagering. So i kept playing and got my account balance up more so i checked back onto cashier for it to stilll say this isnt done yet so i sent them multiple emails and tryed live chatting them and still havent got nothing back. So i kept playing and i got my account upto £300 so i was happy so tryed checking wagering again so i could withdraw but still nothing, so i left it a little and last night i checked it still nothing then 10 minutes later i signed back in to see my balance has dropped to £10, my money has all gone and still no messages back from the company but yet now all of a sudden my account has been verified and is now allowing me to withdraw! Which is strange! So i checked transanctions and it stated i would of done the wagering etc but it states "admin adjustment -£312" "admin transfer +£10" so are they joking me? Admin have been on my account and took my £312 and put £10 back onto my account! I have all the screenshots of this and the terms etc but stilll nothing from the company! So upset as this was the money i was going to try and take my kids away with! So dissapointed and upset! Please can someone help me get my money what i wagered and won!</p>
