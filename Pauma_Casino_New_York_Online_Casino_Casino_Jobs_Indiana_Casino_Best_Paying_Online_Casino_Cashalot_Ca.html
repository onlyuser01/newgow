    <h1>Pauma Casino New York Online Casino Casino Jobs Indiana Casino Best Paying Online Casino Cashalot Ca</h1>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>Sorry, I have a problem with the casino. I made two deposits on October 18, 2021. A deposit of € 21 contained a 200% bonus, which unfortunately was downplayed to € 0.00 with no real winnings. Then I made a deposit of € 20 without using a bonus.</p>
<p>I played for over € 904 (unfortunately you can see how much money was in the casino in the bet list.</p>
<p>For reasons inexplicable to me, the system had applied bonus conditions to the deposited money, but I neither used a bonus nor did I receive a bonus on my money.</p>
<p>When the account balance was over € 904, the bonus conditions were apparently met and due to the conditions for 200% bonuses set out in the T &amp; Cs, € 800 was removed.</p>
<p>As mentioned, I didn't use a bonus on my second deposit. Especially since it always worked with previous deposits at the casino (I didn't have to cancel a bonus if the balance went to € 0.00).</p>
<p>I then contacted support and was told that the balance was € 0.00 and that the balance from the 2nd deposit should not have a bonus.</p>
<p>Again and again I was told that someone would contact me and the problem would be solved. However, it is now almost 3 months and nothing has happened. Only a bonus of 50 € and a small car of 5x was posted to my account. This, as I learned today, should now be the compensation. I didn't use the bonus at all and it has already expired. I ask for help from Casinoguru, because unfortunately I am not getting anywhere and would like to have my money .. I have not yet paid out the remaining € 104 so that it does not lead to any problems, as I would like to pay out the full amount of 904.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>
