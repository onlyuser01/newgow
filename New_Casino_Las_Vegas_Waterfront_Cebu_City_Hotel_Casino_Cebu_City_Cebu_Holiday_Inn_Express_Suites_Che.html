<p>Liverpool and Manchester City are the teams that won the Premier League in the previous two seasons. The Reds did it in 2020; the Sky Blues from Manchester are the reigning Premier League champions.</p>
<p>This season, the two are once again among the top title favorites. No surprise there, as they’ve been laying elite soccer since the start of the season. With 14 points in 6 games, Liverpool is at the top of the table. Manchester City is just behind with 13 points.</p>
<p>Obviously, we’re in for a very exciting duel on Sunday. The question is, who will win? Or maybe we’ll see a draw at Anfield? Let’s see what oddsmakers think!</p>

<p>Jurgen Klopp’s Boys Look Unbeatable</p>
<p>March 7, 2021 – that’s the last time Liverpool lost a Premier League game. What’s even more impressive is that they’ve been scoring a lot of goals lately, with a total of 20 goals in the past six games. That’s 3.33 goals on average per game.</p>
<p>Mohamed Salah has been their best player so far, although others are not far behind when the form is concerned. In fact, Sadio Mane and Diogo Jota have also been superb in the offense. At the back, Virgil van Dijk has been superb as you’d expect from the Premier League MVP from two years ago.</p>
<p>Knowing all this, you’d expect them to get an easy win on Sunday. The trouble is that it’s not any team that’s coming to Anfield. It’s Manchester City, the reigning champ of the Premier League.</p>
<p>Should Man City Fear Anfield?</p>
<p>Manchester City has won only two games against Liverpool at Anfield since the 1980s. One of those wins, however, happened last season. Does this mean Man City players have found a key to beating the Reds on their turf? Not necessarily, because the game in question was played with no fans in attendance. This time, however, Anfield will be packed with Liverpool supporters.</p>
<p>This probably isn’t going to scare Man City players, as they recently pulled off a big win against Chelsea in London. There were more than 40,000 fans in the stands of Chelsea’s Stamford Bridge, most of whom were rooting for the home team.</p>
<p>That didn’t stop the visitors from dominating the game. Manchester City had the ball in their possession for nearly two-thirds of the time, with three times more goal attempts than Chelsea. The result of such a dominant performance was a 1-0 win for the Premier League champions.</p>
<p>Can they do it again? They might, although a draw seems like a much more plausible outcome.</p>
<p>Pick: Liverpool and Manchester City to draw</p>
