<p>Acclaimed online payment provider AstroPay is introducing crypto to its offering, effectively expanding the list of payment options consumers may use to pay with, buy or sell crypto. As a result, AstroPay will enable various crypto buying and selling options on its app and webapp.</p>
<p>The company states that no additional fees are incurred for trading, transferring, purchasing, or maintaining your crypto on Astro’s wallet. Commenting on this move, Astropay CEO Mikael Lijtenstein added:</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to launch our cryptocurrency offering that puts us at the forefront of international payment solutions. With this offering we want to serve younger users who are more inclined to trade cryptocurrencies as they are digital natives.” Astropay CEO Mikael Lijtenstein</p>
<p>AstroPay has been experimenting with cryptocurrencies for over two years at the time of the release and, according to Lijtenstein, the time had come to leverage crypto power with the company’s broader customer base. As a result, the company’s digital wallet will support Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, and Cardano.</p>
<p>All of these may be acquired in a supported local currency or US dollars. The onboarding is seamless allowing you to quickly purchase or exchange crypto. Over the years, AstroPay has become a preferred payment option for casino players.</p>
<p>Astro’s Prelude to Cryptocurrency Some Time in the Making</p>
<p>This latest launch is a testament to AstroPay’s ongoing commitment to vendors in and outside of the iGaming industry. With the crypto market size increasing exponentially, more companies are entering to offer a bridge between fiat and crypto operations. There is also Web 3.0 which has been making forays into the mainstream as well.</p>
<p>AstroPay is also the first digital wallet that offers Cardano (ADA) blockchain tokens in Latin America. The crypto rollout and support will not be available to all customers in all markets, but rather, AstroPay will make this feature available on a per-case basis and in select markets, complying with local regulation. AstroPay has been actively sponsoring various sports teams, including Burnley FC.</p>
<p>AstroPay is not the only company to pursue crypto payments. Visa and PayPal have both started accepting and supporting cryptocurrency, as 2020 and 2021 were bullish years for the currencies, sending their value beyond what many analysts expected. Bitcoin reached an all-time high of $68,000 only to crash to $37,715 as of today.</p>
