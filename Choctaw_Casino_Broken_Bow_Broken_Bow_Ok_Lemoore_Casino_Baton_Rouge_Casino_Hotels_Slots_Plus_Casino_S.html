<p>Dear lumsdenangela,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting this complaint. I'm sorry to hear about your issue with Ruby Slots Casino.</p>
<p>Please understand that requesting identity documents such as ID card, passport, bank statement, or utility bills are normal practice in online gambling establishments. These documents are used for verification which is a very important and essential process, during which the casino makes sure that the money is sent to the rightful owner. As the casinos do not have the luxury of being able to physically see all the players and check their identification, this is the only way gambling establishments are able to complete the verification process. None of the serious and licensed casinos take verification lightly and it might take a few working days to complete this thorough process.</p>
<p>Could you please advise if you passed the verification?</p>
<p>Do I understand correctly that the casino declined your withdrawal request?</p>
<p>Could you also explain in more detail what is the proof you sent here?</p>
<p>I hope we will be able to help you solve this issue as soon as possible. Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards</p>
<p>Veronika</p>
