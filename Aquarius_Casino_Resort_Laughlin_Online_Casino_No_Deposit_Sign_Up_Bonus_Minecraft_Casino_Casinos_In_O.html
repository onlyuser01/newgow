<p>Amid the growing popularity and convenience of online gambling, a new proposal calls for the legalization of iGaming activities in France</p>
<p>Online gambling activities, unlike retail gambling, can be accessed via smartphones or even desktop computers easily. Many iGaming operators offer games that are mobile-first, which reaffirms the potential of the sector which is valued at billions of dollars on a monthly basis. Yet, while many countries around Europe offer iGaming options, the market in France remains significantly restricted. However, a new proposal seeks to change that and introduce legal online gambling options but under strict conditions.</p>
<p>Philippe Latombe, representative of the Democratic party in the country introduced Bill 1248 earlier this week. His proposal calls for the authorization of online casino gambling. However, it sets strict rules for the market, allowing it to grow under specific conditions.</p>
<p>“The ban in force against online casinos is therefore reaching its limits, even if the authorities try to identify and block illegal sites using court orders,“ Explains Bill 1248</p>
<p>The iGaming Market Is Expected to Change in 2030</p>
<p>The bill consists of three articles. Article 3 proposes “online casino games to the same levies operated by the State and local authorities, and therefore completes the list of games that make up the gross gaming revenue,” while Article 2 calls for the introduction of a moratorium that lasts for five years and allows only established casino operators with a license to operate online. Finally, Article 1 of the bill seeks operators that offer online gambling activities to introduce games of chance that are similar to their retail counterparts.</p>
<p>In other words, the proposal calls for the liberalization of the online gambling market which will be initially run by the “national casino industry” under the five-year moratorium. Then, effective from January 1, 2030, the proposal calls to open the market for other companies that are interested in the online gambling market in the country.</p>
<p>The bill explains that this is mandatory as a “total and immediate” opening of the market may result in losses for the national casino industry. This, in turn, may also result in unemployment and devastating consequences for the casino sector.</p>
