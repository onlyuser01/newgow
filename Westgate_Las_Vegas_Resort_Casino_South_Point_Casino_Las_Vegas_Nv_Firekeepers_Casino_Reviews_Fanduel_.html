<p>Exacta Solutions, an iGaming recruitment firm and merger and acquisition specialist, has begun tacking the North American market by establishing a foothold in Mexico. The company plans to establish a strong presence in the country and use it to further expand its presence in the Americas.</p>
<p>Exacta Solutions Will Expand across the Americas from Mexico</p>
<p>Exacta Solutions’ goal is to expand its reach across North America and Latin America and help operators in the region with their staffing needs. The company will begin its North American expansion from Mexico City, which will serve as its new base. The vast city will provide Exacta with a great place to start and reach operators in the region.</p>
<p>In order to further boost the company’s growth in the region, Exacta Solutions’ commercial director and co-founder, Anthony Hennessy, moved to the Mexico hub. He will now directly oversee and guide the recruitment firm’s expansion into North America.</p>
<p>Hennessy spoke about the company’s vision. He noted that the agency was founded in 2019 and has quickly cemented itself as a “specialized and trusted recruitment specialist.” The commercial director explained that Exacta Solutions’ vision is to be a company that provides its partners with a consultative approach tailored to their personal recruitment needs.</p>
<p>Hennessy concluded that his team will remain committed to excellence as the company continues its expansion into the lucrative NA and LATAM markets. He promised that his team will continue “representing the highest caliber of candidates with specialized backgrounds” across all iGaming niches.</p>
<p>Mexico – a Budding Betting Market</p>
<p>Exacta Solutions’ managing director, Chris Vella, also commented on the company’s goals for the future. He said that Exacta was inspired by its success in Bulgaria and is now looking to further scale up its operations by launching in the Americas. Vella noted that Mexico was not a randomly-chosen point of entry. On the contrary, the MD called Mexico a budding gambling market and pointed out that many world-leading operators are looking to establish a presence in the country. He believes that Mexico gambling will continue experiencing strong growth.</p>
<p>True to Vella’s words, many notable gambling operators and suppliers are now realizing the potential of LATAM as a region for gaming. About a month ago, Novibet, a famous game developer, launched in the country through an agreement with Big Bola Casinos, a major Mexican casino operator. This followed an agreement that was originally signed in August. In October, Golden Matrix launched an online gaming brand called MEXPLAY in the country.</p>
