<p>Innovative lottery ticket-selling app Jackpocket continued with its efforts to establish a presence in sports via an agreement with Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise New York Mets.</p>
<p>‘Ways to Meet Players Where They Are’</p>
<p>The strategic partnership between Jackpocket and the New York Mets named the lottery ticket seller the Official Digital Lottery Partner of the professional baseball team which is one of the most recognized franchises in professional sports.</p>
<p>A baseball fan himself, Jackpocket’s founder and chief executive officer Peter Sullivan was excited to have his dream to partner with the Mets fullfilled, outlining the continuous efforts of the lottery ticket-selling app to come up with “ways to meet players where they are.”</p>
<p>“With this latest professional sports partnership, we expand on the unique experiences created for our sports fan base and provide Mets fans with a new way to play and win.” Peter Sullivan, CEO, Jackpocket</p>
<p>Under the collaboration with the Mets, Jackpocket will host sweepstakes for exclusive prizes such as trips to away games and officially licensed pieces of Mets memorabilia. And the app will offer lottery players free lottery tickets available for grabs via a special code upon checkout.</p>
<p>Growing Presence in MLB</p>
<p>The partnership with the Mets is the fourth for Jackpocket with an MLB franchise since the third-party app signed its first agreement with the Minnesota Twins in April to become the Official Mobile Lottery Partner of the Twins.</p>
<p>In May, Jackpocket added another MLB franchise to its portfolio of partners to become the Official Mobile Lottery Partner of the Texas Rangers deal and in June, it was time for the Colorado Rockies to team with the lottery selling app.</p>
<p>Available in Arkansas, Colorado, Minnesota, Montana, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Texas, and Washington DC, Jackpocket is offering a convenient, fun and responsible way to play the lottery and score big on games such as Cash4Life, Powerball, Mega Millions, and others.</p>
<p>Just days ago, Jackpocket announced its ambitions to expand into other interactive gaming verticals with the appointment of John Worthington as its new vice president of interactive gaming, creating the new role to facilitate its path into online casino gaming.</p>
<p>Earlier in the month, four Mets players were named to the 2022 National League All-Star team: first baseman Pete Alonso, second baseman Jeff McNeil, outfielder Starling Marte and RHP Edwin Díaz were all selected for the 92nd All-Star Game scheduled to take place today at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles.</p>
