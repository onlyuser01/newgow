    <h1>Indian Casinos Bighorn Casino Ace Casino New Sweeps Cash Casinos Casino English Movie Flutter Entert</h1>

<p>Global betting and gaming conglomerate Flutter Entertainment announced today the opening of its new state-of-the-art technology and innovation hub located in Leeds, Yorkshire.</p>
<p>Technology Is Key</p>
<p>The new £15-million ($20.7 million) facility designed by prominent property developer MEPC is looking to fill around 1,700 positions, most of which are across the media, technology and creative industries. It is inviting Flutter Entertainment employees in the UK, Ireland and the group’s international divisions to apply.</p>
<p>Our new office in Leeds is our vision for the future of working and we are excited to welcome our colleagues to this modern, agile and flexible workspace.” Conor Grant, CEO, Flutter Entertainment UK and Ireland</p>
<p>Spread across 136,000 square feet of flexible space on eight floors at 4 Wellington Place in Leeds Dock, the technology and innovation hub will become home to more than 800 technology professionals operating in key functions like Global Sports Trading Platform, Digital Infrastructure, Platform Services and Information Technology.</p>
<p>Conor Grant, CEO, Flutter Entertainment UK and Ireland, explained, “The entire Flutter Group has benefited greatly from the leading technology capabilities we have developed in Leeds through our talented and highly skilled workforce, and this investment demonstrates our ongoing commitment to both the city and our colleagues.”</p>
<p>The multi-million technology hub that will have the last two floors dedicated solely for social activities between teams, will also feature a significant investment in video conferencing equipment to promote inclusive meetings between remote and office workers, IT vending machines for certain equipment, as well as six electric car charging points in its basement. The facility received a BREEAM Excellent rating on completion.</p>
<p>People Are Central</p>
<p>A sizeable investment to the city of Leeds and the surrounding Yorkshire region, the facility that was built to the highest environmental standards with a range of accessibility and sustainability features, will also provide numerous high-skilled jobs and is expected to become a center of excellence for all Flutter brands with operations in Ireland and the UK and drive group-wide innovation by developing digital products with global appeal.</p>
<p>The innovation and technology facility will continue SBG’s ‘Skills Academy’ initiative, which offers fully-funded Master of Science in Digital and Technology Solutions in collaboration with Sheffield Hallam University, while also providing experience with technology teams across the group.</p>
<p>We will also continue to be a positive force in the communities we serve, with our Skills Academy and Kickstart scheme offering exciting opportunities for young people to develop their skills,” concluded Flutter Entertainment UK and Ireland CEO Conner Grant.</p>
<p>SBG has recently launched a self-funded version of the government’s Kickstart scheme aimed at young people at risk of long-term unemployment by creating 13 new roles across other business areas and functions like marketing, finance, people, tech and design.</p>
