<p>Yggdrasil returns with a new slot just in time for Day of the Dead with its latest release. “Calavera Crush” is a game that evokes the spirits of the dead and promises to create many fond memories as you find your way through this eerie slot that will haunt you long after you have ended your session.</p>
<p>Excellent Multipliers and Big Wins Await in Calavera Crush</p>
<p>The game comes with upbeat mariachi tunes and loads of bonus features and mechanics that promise to make the experience a true delight. Players will get the opportunity to trigger avalanches and have symbols removed to optimize their gameplay and winning potential. Yggdrasil head of product and programs Stuart McCarthy said:</p>
<p>This epic Day of the Dead-inspired release will have players going loco thanks to its thrilling features and memorable mechanics. Yggdrasil head of product and programs Stuart McCarthy</p>
<p>Free spins with a potentially infinite win multiplier also await at “Calavera Crush.” Players will get a chance to keep on triggering Wild Symbols that add to the win multiplier at a rate of +1, +2, or +3. As players win more, consecutive wins add up to a nice total multiplier that can be quite rewarding.</p>
<p>But if you are really about the Day of the Dead festivities, you just wait and see until you hit four or more scatter symbols during the base game. This will trigger the free spins which feature eight free rounds for you to enjoy. However, you can also try and test your good luck once more as a special feature offers you to gamble your spins for a chance to win 18 free spins instead.</p>
<p>Benefit from the Bonus Buy Feature in the Right Jurisdiction</p>
<p>Not only that, but the Calavera Crush’s win multiplier does not reset when you transition from the base into the bonus game, which ends up adding even bigger multipliers on your reels. There is also a Golden Bet option that will result in 25% extra per each spin, which increases your chance to trigger a bonus by x2.</p>
<p>Not only that, but certain jurisdictions even allow players to benefit from the Bonus Buy features that comes with Calavera Crush in approved markets. Using the GAT technology, Yggdrasil is all about building a unique game that will resonate with players and compel them to try new and exciting features around the clock.</p>
<p>McCarthy concluded by adding that the game has been designed with fantastic winning potential and it had all that it would take in any slot to make a great player-favorite title.</p>
