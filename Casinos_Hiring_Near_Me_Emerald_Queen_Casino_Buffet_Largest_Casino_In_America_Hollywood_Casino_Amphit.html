<p>The new collaboration will see the betting and gaming brand benefit from increased exposure</p>
<p>The famous soccer club based in Wolverhampton, England, Wolverhampton Wanderers Football Club, also popular as Wolves, announced Monday a new sponsorship agreement. The club confirmed that it joined forces with the industry-leading sports entertainment platform with a strong presence in Asia, 6686 Sport.</p>
<p>Judging by a statement released by the Wolves, the sponsorship designates the company as the club’s official Asian betting partner. The collaboration saw the betting brand’s logo on the team’s sleeves for the pre-season friendly matches, applicable for its away and home kits.</p>
<p>The new sponsorship will see 6686 Sport’s logo appear on all Wolves’ playing and adult replica kits throughout the season. Additionally, the famous betting and gaming brand will benefit from double-row LED advertisements for all Molineux Premier League games.</p>

Besides engaging with new audiences through brand exposure, the brand vowed to develop new content in collaboration with the Wolves. This content will cater to the global fans of the team, as well as the sport.</p>
<p>The collaboration with Wolves comes on the heels of another deal announced by 6686 Sport. Earlier this month, the company confirmed it joined forces with AS Monaco, a globally-recognized soccer club with millions of fans. Under the deal, 6686 was designated as AS Monaco’s official regional partner for Asia for the next three seasons.</p>
<p>Danny Chen, 6686’s brand manager, was delighted to see the company join forces with the Wolves. He predicted that the collaboration will help revolutionize the sports betting vertical, delivering unique experiences for sports fans and bettors.</p>
<p>Chen added: “With many collective years of industry expertise, 6686 Sports has established itself as a trusted leader in the betting platform realm.” He spoke about the company’s love for soccer which enables it to deliver unique betting experiences. Finally, Chen predicted that the deal will play an important part in the development of the future of sports betting.</p>
<p>“We are delighted to announce our thrilling partnership with Wolves, as we join forces to revolutionize the world of sports betting.“ Danny Chen, brand manager of 6686 Sport</p>
<p>Russell Jones, Wolve’s general manager for marketing and commercial growth, added: “We are delighted to formally welcome 6686 Sport to the club ahead of our first Premier League fixture at Old Trafford on Monday night.” He pointed out that the new deal marks a milestone agreement for the club as it is the biggest one to date.</p>
<p>Jones spoke about the Wolves’ growing presence in Asia, saying that the club is excited to team up with 6686 for the 2023/24 season. Finally, he said that he is looking forward to the thrilling experiences the new activation will bring for sports fans.</p>
