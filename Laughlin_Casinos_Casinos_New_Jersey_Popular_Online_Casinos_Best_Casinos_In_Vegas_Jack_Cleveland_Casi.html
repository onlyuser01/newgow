<p>The supplier and the operator will solidify their presence in the two jurisdictions</p>
<p>White Hat Studios, a major provider of slot games in the United States, has agreed to power Kindred Group’s gaming operations with content. Under the agreement, slots from the supplier will be rolled out on Unibet, Kindred’s flagship gaming platform.</p>
<p>As per the deal, some of White Hat Studios’ best titles will be now available to Unibet players. This includes award-winning hits such as Almighty Buffalo Megaways and other fan-favorite games. Moreover, Unibet will secure access to the provider’s unparalleled jackpot system Jackpot Royale.</p>
<p>In addition to engaging slot games, Kindred will also onboard White Hat Studios’ innovative table games, bringing even more excitement to its consumers.</p>
<p>The two companies’ new partnership agreement covers Kindred’s business in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, two regions where White Hat Studios’ games are very popular. As a result, the supplier will be able to solidify its presence in the two jurisdictions.</p>
<p>The Two Companies Are Happy to Grow their Presence in the States</p>
<p>White Hat Studios, which recently signed a similar agreement with betPARX, shared its excitement about the deal through its vice president of sales and marketing, Daniel Lechner. The latter said that his team is “thrilled to be partnering with Kindred Group,” which he praised as a prominent global operator in the USA and beyond.</p>
<p>Our high-quality, engaging titles will boost both player acquisition and retention and we look forward to seeing Unibet’s players’ reception to our releases across the two states involved in the deal. Daniel Lechner, VP of sales and marketing, White Hat Studios</p>
<p>Miranda McPhail, Kindred Group’s product vice president, also commented on the matter. With Kindred’s Platform now live in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, the company is now seeking more content-oriented partnerships with industry-leading suppliers. McPhail noted that Kindred recognizes the importance of providing players with “the most entertaining and varied portfolio of titles.”</p>
<p>This strategy, McPhail pointed out, is key to Kindred’s expansion plans in the United States. The deal with White Hat is in line with this strategy.</p>
<p>The company’s [White Hat Studios’] titles have won numerous awards and have quickly established a loyal fan base that has solidified it as a brand within the US gambling industry zeitgeist. Miranda McPhail, product VP, Kindred Group</p>
<p>McPhail concluded that Kindred Group is excited about this mutually-beneficial agreement.</p>
<p>In other news, Kindred recently renewed its Team Talk agreement with Rangers FC in the United Kingdom, expressing its desire to support its local communities. This was further echoed by the company’s recent Journey Toward Zero report, which showed that only 3.1% of the company’s revenues come from harmful gambling.</p>
