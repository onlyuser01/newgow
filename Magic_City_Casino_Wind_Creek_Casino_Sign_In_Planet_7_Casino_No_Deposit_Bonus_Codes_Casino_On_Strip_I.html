<p>Gambler Sues Paddy Power Over ‘Misheard’ £286,000 Bet</p>

<p>London’s High Court has agreed to hear the case of a wealthy bettor who claims Paddy Power owes him £286,000 after the stakes of his bet were misheard.</p>

<p>In September 2019, James Longley, 44, called Paddy Power’s telephone betting service with the intention of placing a $1,300 each-way bet on a horse called “Redemptive” at Wolverhampton Racecourse.</p>
<p>The operator sought authority for the stake because of its size, but mistakenly relayed it to an authorizing trader as £13,000 each way, £26,000 in total.</p>
<p>Longley accepted the bet, claiming he understood it as “a counter-offer” from Paddy Power. This should have entitled him to a £286,000 payout when Redemptive romped home in the first place, but Longley says the bookmaker is welching on the bet.</p>
<p>The bookmaker refused to pay out on the larger stake, citing an “error” clause in its terms and conditions.</p>
<p>‘Plausible Bet’ from Multi-Millionaire</p>
<p>Paddy Power’s lawyer Kajetan Wandowicz argued that, based on context and Longley’s reaction, the plaintiff had not noticed the mention of a larger stake. He claimed Longley only realized the difference when he later checked an app on his phone.</p>
<p>This meant the parties had been at cross purposes, and so no valid contract had been agreed upon, Wandowicz said.</p>
<p>“It beggars belief, that a highly intelligent and sophisticated punter [bettor] who has only just been told that his requested bet has been approved would regard that mention of a different sum of money as a counter-offer,” Wandowicz added.</p>
<p>Longley’s lawyer, Mark James, said that for most people, a sudden tenfold increase in stakes would be unheard of. But his client’s wealth and gambling habits made it perfectly plausible.</p>
<p>Longley is described by The Sun newspaper as a “self-made multimillionaire” who made his fortune through the sale of his utility bills company Utility Bidder in 2018.</p>
<p>Chasing Losses</p>
<p>James said it seemed the Paddy Power trader had been eager to accept the bet because he thought Longley was chasing his losses. The plaintiff had already lost £19,000 to Paddy Power that day, from an opening balance of £78,000.</p>
<p>“Objectively, it’s a bet for £13,000 each way. That’s how Mr. Longley understood it, that’s how the phone operator understood it, and that’s the bet that Paddy Power’s trader authorized. It would be a very unusual outcome if they were all wrong,” James said.</p>
<p>“They [bookmakers] can lay off their bets, make a profit on the deal, and then tell the bettor, ‘We’re keeping our winnings, but you can’t have yours’,” he added.</p>
