    <h1>Casino Pendleton Oregon Cherokee Casino Oklahoma Tuscany Hotel And Casino Little River Casino Manist</h1>

<p>Boston-based daily fantasy and sportsbook operator DraftKings teamed up with the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation to provide online sports betting in Connecticut, subject to legislative and regulatory approvals, the online gaming operator, and the tribe announced today.</p>
<p>“This is a landmark deal in collaboration with the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation as well as a critical next step to bringing America’s top-rated sportsbook app to sports fans in Connecticut.” Matt Kalish, Co-Founder and President, DraftKings North America</p>
<p>Foxwoods’ Official DFS Partner</p>
<p>The deal with the Mashantucket nation which makes DraftKings the official daily fantasy sports (DFS) partner for the casino operated by the tribe, Foxwoods Resort Casino, further expands the operator’s footprint to 12 states, most of which offer retail and online sports betting.</p>
<p>“The national expansion of regulated sports betting is among our top strategic priorities. DraftKings today is live with mobile sports betting in 10 states, more than any other operator in the U.S., and teaming up with the tribe will allow us to extend our reach even further.” Matt Kalish, Co-Founder and President, DraftKings North America</p>
<p>December 13 will see DraftKings launch as the first-ever DFS partner for Foxwoods, offering contests and online promotions, as well as other digital experiences to boost engagement with fans for the casino and the operator.</p>
<p>“Partnering with DraftKings, the most prominent name in sports betting, reinforces the Mashantucket Pequot Tribe’s position as a leader in the gaming and entertainment industry.” Rodney Butler, Chairman, Mashantucket Pequot Tribe Nation</p>
<p>Tribal Gaming Exclusivity</p>
<p>The Mashantucket Pequot and Mohegan tribes hold the exclusive rights to offer gaming in Connecticut, paying 25% of their slot revenue as per the terms of their state compacts which have generated so far in excess of $8 billion for the state.</p>
<p>“DraftKings is a pioneer in the U.S. digital sports entertainment and gaming market. Offering daily fantasy sports allows us to bring a new type of compelling and interactive online experience to our passionate sport fans.” Jason Guyot, Interim CEO and President, Foxwoods Resort Casino</p>
<p>Connecticut is projected to generate $175 million from online gaming and sports betting over 5 years and the deal between DraftKings and the Mashantucket will let them launch sports wagering upon its legalization and after a state compact amendment is executed.</p>
<p>“We’ve proven our ability to shape the future of gaming time and time again, and now we’re ready to drive sports wagering and online gaming for the state of Connecticut. Working through the tribal gaming compacts, we will help bolster our economy with much-needed revenue and virtual entertainment.” Rodney Butler, Chairman, Mashantucket Pequot Tribe Nation</p>
<p>The issue of sports betting legalization in the state is still hanging in the balance as the tribes insist on maintaining their exclusivity with regards to the new gaming activity while other commercial operators strongly oppose that notion.</p>
<p>In October, there was a legislative attempt to bring back the subject to the table through the Connecticut Jobs and Revenue Act, in which both tribes were offered to develop a new casino in Bridgeport if they give up their sports betting exclusivity, a proposal the tribes rebuffed.</p>
