    <h1>Casino Game Apps Treasure Island Casino Red Wing Mn American Casino Casino Money Casino News Virgin</h1>

<p>The prominent sports betting brand has confirmed that it is extending its support for the prominent horse racing festival for a third consecutive year</p>
<p>Ayr Racecourse has welcomed this ongoing commitment on behalf of the sportsbook and said that the Virgin Bet Ayr Gold Cup has reached a value of £180,000 ($235,000) and continues to be a perpetual source of excitement for fans.</p>
<p>Ayr Racecourse Finds Unfaltering Partner</p>
<p>The event has also grown in prominence and has been able to engage with fans of horse racing, not least thanks to the backing of the bookmaker. The venue also hosts the Gold Cup and Silver Cup, as well as the Bronze Cup, making it the only venue that keeps all three in the same place across the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>As to Virgin Bet’s actual commitment to the event, the sportsbook will be sponsoring the entire three-day Festival which will kick off on Thursday, September 21, and will also feature the Virgin Bet Kilkerran Cup. On Friday, the festival will then feature Virgin Bet Bronze Cup and the sportsbook will similarly sponsor the Saturday Gold Cup race as well.</p>
<p>Commenting on this opportunity, Ayr managing director David Brown has expressed his thanks to the new sponsor and the significance of this ongoing relationship with the bookmaker:</p>
<p>The Virgin Bet name will be associated with the entire 3-day Festival once again and, as well as the Ayr Gold Cup itself, another 8 key contests over the 3-days will be sponsored by Virgin Bet, including the prestigious Firth Of Clyde Stakes for 2-year-olds and the mile and a quarter Doonside Cup.</p>
<p>Virgin Bet marketing director Ric Leask was similarly excited about the event. He said that it was with great pleasure that his company was offering sponsorship for the event for a third consecutive year.</p>
<p>The Rising Star and Fixture in British Sports Betting</p>
<p>“Virgin Bet remains committed to being a leading player in the world of horse racing, and sponsoring this prestigious race demonstrates this,” Leask added. Virgin Bet is one of the newest sports betting companies in the United Kingdom. The company was launched in 2019 in the market, and it received accolades as “The Rising Star” from SBC 2021.</p>
<p>Virgin Bet works closely with LiveScore Group to deliver some of the best sports betting experiences. Just as well, the company continues to sponsor prominent racing and sports events.</p>
