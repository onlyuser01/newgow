<p>Haney vs Lomachenko is arguably the most exciting boxing matchup of the month, and heading to MGM Grand Garden Arena on May 20, 2023</p>
<p>Devin Haney (29-0) is defending five lightweight titles (IBF, WBA, WBC, WBO, and The Ring) against Vasiliy Lomachenko (17-2) this coming Saturday. Oddsmakers think Haney will stay undefeated, but we feel as if the Ukrainian pugilist might stage an upset.</p>
<p>Moneyline Odds Devin Haney -260 Vasiliy Lomachenko +200 Odds taken from DraftKings on Tuesday, May 16, 2023.</p>
<p>When, Where, and How to Watch?</p>
<p>Place : MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada</p>
<p>: MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada Date : Saturday, May 20, 2023</p>
<p>: Saturday, May 20, 2023 Time : ~10:00 PM ET</p>
<p>: ~10:00 PM ET How to Watch: ESPN+</p>
<p>Reasons Why Devin Haney is the Favorite in Saturdayâ€™s Bout</p>
<p>Devin Haney is a 24-year-old American boxer who started his professional career in 2015. Two years later, he won his first major title (WBC Youth), and it was 2019 when his pro career really took off. Then, in 2022, he beat George Kambosos Jr., becoming the youngest undisputed champion in history.</p>
<p>He defended his title against the same opponent the same year. Both times, he did it by unanimous decision. In fact, each of his last six bouts lasted for a full 12 rounds. However, heâ€™s got more wins by KO/TKO, although the last time it happened was in 2019 against Antonio Moran.</p>
<p>Obviously, his boxing skills have evolved over time, and in 2023, heâ€™s one of the most tactical pugilists in the lightweight division. Actually, some believe that the only lightweight boxer with a higher fighting IQ is his next opponent, Vasiliy Lomachenko.</p>
<p>Vasiliy Lomachenko Ready to Stage an Upset</p>
<p>No one can dispute that Devin Haney is a smart boxer, but we did see him lose his temper a couple of times. That hasnâ€™t caused him major problems in the past, but it might affect him negatively against Lomachenko. Heâ€™s already tried to play some mind games with the Ukrainian fighter, but Loma did not respond.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s no surprise as this guy has way more experience than Haney. Loma is a 35-year-old veteran whose professional record is 17-2 with both of his losses happening by decision. Before going pro, he had a fantastic amateur career, with a record of 396-1.</p>
<p>Similarly to Haney, Loma too is a tactical fighter with great stamina. Heâ€™s also very quick with great footwork and incredible head movement. This explains why no oneâ€™s ever managed to knock this guy out. Weâ€™re sure Haney wonâ€™t do that either. But can Loma beat him?</p>
<p>Devin Haney vs Vasiliy Lomachenko Prediction</p>
<p>Devin Haney is at least as good as Vasiliy Lomachenko in terms of physical abilities and boxing skills. However, the Ukrainian has way more experience than the reigning champ. We think Loma can outsmart him on Saturday, winning the bout after all 12 rounds.</p>
<p>Pick: Vasiliy Lomachenko to win</p>
