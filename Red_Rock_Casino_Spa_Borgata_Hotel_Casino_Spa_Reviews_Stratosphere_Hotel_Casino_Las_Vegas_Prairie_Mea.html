    <h1>Red Rock Casino Spa Borgata Hotel Casino Spa Reviews Stratosphere Hotel Casino Las Vegas Prairie Mea</h1>

<p>I have kinda noticed a strange trend with really all of these Casinos but mostly at this one because I used to play at this one the most.</p>
<p>What I noticed was it would seem that when I would accept a bonus on a</p>
<p>deposit I would hit and I would hit a lot and pretty big wins. So given the outrageous amount you usually have to play thru just to be able to cash out I would be okay with it because like I said I would still have that play thru to meet before any cash out would be possible.</p>
<p>So I would play usually straight thru sometimes lasting up to 12 hours of straight play thru if I had nothing going on or a high amount I wanted to be able to cash out once I reached the play-thru limit.</p>
<p>So I was starting to notice as time went on and no matter how many different "machines" ( different slots ) I played at I would see less and less winnings than originally starting. As I would start to lose more the winnings got more and more sporadic. Which I originally thought in the beginning was just attributed to me having bad luck. But I continued to see this happening again and again. Ending with me having lost everything in the end.</p>
<p>So I started to not use the bonuses and see if I had different results. What I noticed was by using no bonus it more closely matches what a normal night out at the Casino would be. In other words more random wins vs. losses. ( more wins for me usually when I play live. I live 4 miles from a big local Casino and have had excellent luck there. I don't know how or why but no bs here 95% of the time I go I always walk out with money in my pocket. Everyone hates going with me because they all lose and I win. Lol but I digress )</p>
<p>This is not to say that you cannot win by using a bonus with your initial deposit because you can. I have just noticed in my usual taking of the given bonuses It is usually very very less often I win anything at all in the end by utilizing bonuses.</p>
<p>I am not sure if this happens to anyone else or not but what I have noticed is I win more by usually not taking them.</p>
<p>I have also noticed something else. I usually play with a number of Casinos but like I said before I used to play with this one exclusively. It kinda seems odd to me that given as much as I have deposited with this Casino my withdraws have been let's just say rather dissapointing. Yes I know the house has the upper hand so I have already factored that in. I have kinda noticed with these Casinos that they will notice if your a usual player ( and this is only a theory and my opinion ) then they might throw you a big big win or a even maybe a jackpot at ya. So then they know they got ya as a returning customer they then let you go ahead and cash out. So then your thinking, this is great! So you keep coming back trying to grab that elusive jackpot. But alas, said jackpot never comes. Sure you might hit a few big wins here and there, but any big bucks suddenly never seem to show up. So you might try another Casino and BAM after playing a bit you hit it big again. Then you start to notice the same trend. Never able to reach any decent amount worthy of a cash-out or "withdraw". Oh let's be clear for me personally I just don't see the point of withdrawing anything under 300 American. I usually start with around 200. So to me there is no point in withdrawing unless I've actually at least to the very least made some kind of money. And let's just say this Casino right here has been for me a 10% winner for me. That's right you read that right. Out of all of the money I have paid to play this Casino has 90% of the money I've put into it. That's also the same for all the other online Casinos I've played with.</p>
<p>This is me playing for close to 5 years now with Online Casinos 2 with this one.</p>
<p>Personally I feel that number is quite low and really should be closer to at least 35%-45%. But my checkbook sadly doesn't lie. Unless my US math education has failed me (zip-it) or the calculator I use is calibrated wrong, then numbers speak for themselves.</p>
<p>It is my belief that every single one of these Online Casinos has it rigged so much in their favor and with such little oversight or regulation such as any type of legit and trusted agency to dig into these Casinos and their so-called "random number generators" and if those aren't tweaked more, like a lot more in the Casinos favor then what they should be normallaly. Or maybe they have the ability to selectively change them at any given time for them to use as they see fit?</p>
<p>I don't know. But I smell a rat! I don't think I'm alone in my. Smelling of said rat either. I really think there should be more into just how these Casinos are run. Statement of the Century huh? Lol. A crooked Casino?? Nooo?? Look I get it. All I'm saying is, I think there is a lot that just isn't quite adding up and I absolutely think people who get rich off of "insert cuss word here" (starts w/ F ends with ing) with peoples money are a big part of the scum of the Earth.</p>
