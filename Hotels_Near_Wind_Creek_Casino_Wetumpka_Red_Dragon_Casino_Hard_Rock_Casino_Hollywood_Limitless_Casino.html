<p>BetCity.nl, sports betting brand of BetEnt and one of the first 10 operators granted a license for the new online gaming market by Kansspelautoriteit (KSA), announced two new additions to its responsible gaming team, Iris den Boer and Milan Moser.</p>
<p>Bolstering the Responsible Gaming Team</p>
<p>New additions to BetCity’s responsible gaming team den Boer and Moser bring expertise from the gaming and banking sectors and increase the company’s headcount at the brand’s head office in Amsterdam to over 60 people.</p>
<p>Moser is joining the sports betting firm from Dutch bank ABN AMRO, having spent the last three years serving in the bank’s new client and compliance department, while den Boer brings experience as a responsible gaming expert at Malta-headquartered Kindred Group, where she spent four-and-a-half years, Australian social gaming company VGW and Kaizen Gaming, her most recent employer.</p>
<p>Ahead of the official launch of the newly regulated online gaming market in the Netherlands, the online sportsbook brand BetCity was beefed by Kambi‘s technology after a multi-year agreement between the sports betting tech supplier and BetCity’s parent BetEnt.</p>
<p>Utilizing the Power of Kambi and Oryx</p>
<p>As part of the deal, Kambi became BetCity’s exclusive online sportsbook provider, while the tech company’s experience with gambling regulations and maintaining integrity would provide further support for BetCity’s official launch.</p>
<p>In November, BetCity went live with online casino gaming via Oryx Gaming under a full turnkey agreement signed between BetEnt and the company that is part of Toronto-based Bragg Gaming Group. According to the terms of the deal, BetCity will receive a complete iGaming solution, including Oryx’s Player Account Management (PAM) and its extensive content library of over 10,000 aggregated casino games.</p>
<p>Under Oryx’s PAM, BetCity will utilize a comprehensive set of proprietary tools, including player management, payments, data services, CRM, promotions, bonuses, rewards, fraud, compliance, analytics, reporting and others.</p>
<p>Oryx’s FUZE player engagement platform will further allow the new online casino brand to benefit from tools like tournaments with real-time leaderboards, missions, quests, free rounds and an advanced campaign management system.</p>
<p>The full turnkey solution provided by the company from the Bragg Gaming umbrella also includes localized managed services, providing BetCity with marketing, anti-money laundering and payments services tools.</p>
