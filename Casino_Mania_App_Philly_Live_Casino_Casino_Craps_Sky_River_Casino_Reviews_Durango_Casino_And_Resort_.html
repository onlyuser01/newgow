<p>DraftKings Stock Soars After Inclusion in Biggest ARK Fund, Analysts Cheer Investor Day Comments</p>

<p>DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) is on pace for one of its best days since its debut last April as market participants embrace another round of bullish commentary from sell-side analysts and support for the name from a famed investor.</p>

<p>In midday trading, shares of the sportsbook operator are higher by nearly 10 percent — a sign the Boston-based company is earning glowing reviews following its March 9 investor day. Yesterday, the operator told investors the North American iGaming and online sports wagering markets could eventually be worth $67 billion.</p>
<p>DraftKings added that the US sports betting business could be worth $22 billion at maturity and it raised its long-term earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) forecast to $1.7 billion.</p>
<p>In our view, DKNG provides one of the better user experiences given product innovation, wide offerings and seamless UI,” said Macquarie analyst Chad Beynon in a note.</p>
<p>“In addition, following the third-quarter SBTech migration, which will bear financial synergies, this could further unlock the ability to properly curate/recommend personalized items as well as create new and innovative content,” Beynon added.</p>
<p>Beynon lifts his price target on the stock to $73 from $71 while reiterating an “outperform” rating. That new forecast implies upside of almost 18 percent from the March 9 close.</p>
<p>More ARK Support for DraftKings Stock</p>
<p>Another catalyst for today’s DraftKings upside is the ongoing support of the name from Cathie Wood’s ARK Investment Management, which has recently been feasting on the shares.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the money manager issuer bought 949,000 shares of DraftKings for the ARK Innovation ETF (NYSEARCA:ARKK) — the firm’s flagship exchange traded fund (ETF). That purchase follows a buy of 748,201 shares allocated to ARKK on Monday and the purchase of 56,900 shares directed to another ARK fund on the same day.</p>
<p>ARK started buying DraftKings stock in February, initially including the name in the ARK Next Generation ETF (NYSEARCA:ARKW) and later the ARK Fintech Innovation ETF (NYSEARCA:ARKF).</p>
<p>The inclusion of DraftKings in the Innovation ETF is a strong endorsement of the stock because that fund has $17.68 billion in assets under management, making it the largest actively managed ETF in the US. The gaming equity accounts for 0.47 percent of that fund’s weight.</p>
<p>Across the three aforementioned ETFs, ARK holds approximately 3.7 million DraftKings shares. On that basis, the fund manager is now the 12th-largest institutional owner of the equity.</p>
<p>More Good Vibes</p>
<p>It wasn’t just Beynon and Wood contributing to today’s surge by DraftKings stock. At least a half dozen other analysts made positive comments on the name following the investor with several joining Beynon in boosting price targets.</p>
<p>Needham analyst Chris Pierce highlighted “1) DKNG bumping up the low end of potential iGaming market share; 2) Further commentary around a potential oligopoly market structure developing, which stands to benefit DKNG as a market leader; 3) A smattering of potentially bullish OSB nuggets: illegal market conversion still in the early innings, DKNG’s customer makeup of casual vs VIP players, &amp; in-game wagering as a potential differentiator as DKNG is able to leverage the SBTech integration.”</p>
<p>He has a “buy” rating and an $80 forecast on the stock.</p>
