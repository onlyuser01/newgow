<p>Information about Betsoft Gaming casinos</p>
<p>So you've seen Betsoft Gaming slots online and you want to find the best casino to play them in. Well, our Betsoft online casino list can help you do just that, with ratings, reviews and special filters to help you make your decision.</p>
<p>We'd also like to give you some more info about Betsoft Gaming; what background they have and what you can expect from their games. Read on to find out more.</p>
<p>Table of contents:</p>
<p>Betsoft Gaming – a solid reputation and international presence</p>
<p>Founded in 2006, Betsoft Gaming are well-known for producing quality games with attractive features that players enjoy. Like many providers, they are based in Malta; earning a Class 4 Gaming License with the Malta Gaming Authority in 2014.</p>
<p>While they can back this up with a Class II License from the Romanian Gambling Board and a license in Curacao, they were suspended from the Alderney Gambling Control Commission in 2014, although no reason was given at the time.</p>
<p>Despite this, we have no reason to believe that they are a dishonest provider. They have continued to supply popular 3D games; building an impressive portfolio that has been exhibited at top events, such as the ICE event in London.</p>
<p>The company can call upon a team of experienced engineers, developers, and designers to deliver what they describe as an 'unparalleled level of service'. Today, they service a wide range of operators in Europe and both the Americas to give them an established international presence.</p>
<p>Betsoft Games - An impressive 3D selection</p>
<p>Betsoft like to refer to their award-winning range of games, and this is true - with accolades received from the likes of 5 Star Awards for creating the Game of the Year. But do they live up to their billing?</p>
<p>A glance at their list of titles shows them to have striking 3D graphics, and these are grouped together under the group name Slots3. Titles such as Monster Pop and Gold Canyon seem to jump out at you as you scroll your cursor over them - and it's clear they all have an attractive bold aesthetic.</p>
<p>The games are mostly three to five reels, with some exceptions, and they normally have 20 to 30 paylines. They also come with a range of special features, from standard options including free spins and 'click me' games, to more advanced second screen bonus games that enhance gameplay by allowing an interaction with that game's characters.</p>
<p>Betsoft don't limit themselves to slots, either. A wide selection of card games, including Blackjack and Poker titles, will keep you entertained for a good while, as well as non-card games such as Roulette and Craps.</p>
<p>A special touch is shown within their table games, too, with beautifully-designed virtual tables giving you the impression that you're playing there in person.</p>
<p>Betsoft software</p>
<p>Like most providers, Betsoft makes use of HTML5-based technology for all of their games meaning you can play them on any mobile device, as well as your desktop computer. As such, they boast the ToGo™ brand of video slots - a line that is optimized for iOS and Android devices.</p>
<p>The Betsoft platform is known for its flexibility, which gives casinos that run their games a choice of software solutions to power their games. The end result is a higher level of game choice for the player, and more chance of a satisfied customer.</p>
<p>The software used by Betsoft Gaming comes with official certification from authorities such as the Technical Systems Testing (TST) and Quinel Limited, which ensure the fairness of the games.</p>
<p>A guide to finding the best Betsoft casino for you</p>
<p>With its multiple licenses and vibrant games, it'd be a shame if you played a Betsoft title in a dishonest casino. Unfortunately, some casino sites try to exploit players and con them out of money, even while playing games from a trusted provider like Betsoft.</p>
<p>We don't want that to happen to you, which is why our Betsoft casino list and review system is here to help you choose the right options. As such, you can follow these guidelines to use it effectively.</p>
<p>To start, you'll have the Betsoft casino list in front of you, showing all available options. From there, you can click the 'Recommended' tab to see the Betsoft casinos that we rate the highest. These will all have been given the 'thumbs up' by our team and will be available to play in your country.</p>
<p>It could be that you just want the latest options to look at. If so, hit the 'Newly opened' tab to get those new Betsoft Gaming casinos.</p>
<p>Another option is the 'All' tab, which, as you probably guessed, takes you back to all Betsoft Gaming casinos on our database.</p>
<p>Our How to choose an online casino list is also available for you to read and is full of great advice to help you choose the best casino to play on.</p>
<p>Betsoft casino bonuses</p>
<p>If you love a bonus, then the good news is that Betsoft casinos often give you the chance to use them. There are bonuses of many kinds, including first deposit (welcome) bonuses and no deposit bonuses, so it's good to know how to find them.</p>
<p>You can do this by heading to our list of casino bonuses and selecting 'Betsoft Gaming' on the Game provider filter. You can also do this for a specific bonus type, so ticking the 'no deposit bonuses' filter will give you just those; or you can just go to the list of no deposit bonuses and hit the filter there. You'll only get the most up-to-date options here, so don't worry about irrelevant or expired bonuses.</p>
