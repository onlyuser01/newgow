    <h1>Ignition Casino Review Fanduel Casino Michigan Login Allegany Casino Online Casino Betting Free Cash</h1>

<p>Hello</p>
<p>I have a serious problem with Bitstarz casino withdrawal "procedures". It reminds me the worse practices of the soviet police. It seems like the casino support people have no any limit on what they can ask you to perform in order to get your legitimate casino winnings paid back to you. And I think such practices are highly reprehensible and should be punished.</p>
<p>Just look at what I was put through when I tried to cash out 1950 euro balance from my casino:</p>
<p>Standard copies of all the documents</p>
<p>then</p>
<p>Selfie with passport and paper</p>
<p>then</p>
<p>Another Selfies with passport and paper</p>
<p>then</p>
<p>photo of myself near the address post on my street in fron of my house with passport in my hand</p>
<p>then</p>
<p>photo of myself with the local newspaper + passport + me winking on the photo</p>
<p>then another one because the details were not too clear on the previous photo</p>
<p>then a request for a phone call</p>
<p>then a 20 minutes interrogation (yes, I mean it!) on the phone including asking the details of my gameplay at the casino 2 years ago and expecting exact answer for the smallest details!</p>
<p>And then, after 20 minutes on the phone with almost all crazy question answered in full - then I receive another email asking for the skype conferenceâ€¦.</p>
<p>This is when thought that I had enough, enough humiliations from the casino which , it seems like that, has no intention to pay and who intentionally tortures their winning clients by making them to go through the absurd and unnecessary procedures and also, which is especially infuriating, one at a time. I have my human dignity and I am not ready to compromise it just because some online casino owes me a certain amount of money. I am not ready to be treated like a criminal!</p>
<p>With all that I insist the casino should be definitely punished for these kind of unethical practices , the type of Soviet times repressive state machine used against its citizens.</p>
<p>Thank you for your help!</p>
