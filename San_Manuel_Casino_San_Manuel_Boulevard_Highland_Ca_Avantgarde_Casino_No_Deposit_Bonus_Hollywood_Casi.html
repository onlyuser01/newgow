<p>The International Basketball Federation (FIBA) has revealed a new partnership with the Philippines-based sports betting operator, J9.com. As a result, J9.com will have access to all major basketball events hosted by the organization through 2024.</p>
<p>J9 will secure signage and presence in key FIBA competitions, including the FIBA Continental Cups for men and women as well as the FIBA Women’s Basketball World Cup 2022 and the FIBA’s main event, the FIBA Basketball World Cup 2023, and others.</p>
<p>This partnership marks the tenth official global partner for FIBA as the federation seeks to pivot its offering globally and engage with fans up close. FIBA is already in partnership with Bitci.com, a cryptocurrency trading platform, Chinese telecommunications giant Tencent, Wanda, and others.</p>
<p>J9 is hoping to significantly boost brand awareness for its own products and services. The operator will have access to the organization’s .basketball domain to promote various initiatives such as corporate social responsibilities through a dedicated portal, to name J9.basketball.</p>
<p>Commenting on this opportunity, FIBA director general of media and marketing services, Frank Leenders, said that he was excited to see J9 joining the FIBA family. He is confident that the collaboration will help advance basketball’s popularity globally as well as make sure that fans stay closer to the game through J9’s unique engagement options through betting.</p>
<p>New and Improved Experiences Made Possibly by J9</p>
<p>Leenders spoke about new and improved experiences that fans will be able to benefit from with J9 in the center of its all as FIBA’s latest global partner. J9.com managing director James Chen welcomed the opportunity to be joining FIBA and benefiting from the company’s substantial footprint. Chen had this to add:</p>
<p>“It is a great honor for us to become a Global Partner of FIBA and to have the opportunity to contribute to the development of basketball globally.” J9.com managing director James Chen</p>
<p>The manager expressed confidence in 9J’s digital-savvy and innovative approach to sports betting. With FIBA, the company has little doubt that it would be able to spread the love for basketball across the world and its own jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Sports leagues continue to seek closer ties with sports betting operators at a time when fan engagement is beginning to dry up. However, sports betting has brought fresh opportunities for sports bodies to re-engage with fans and continue to drive the momentum of sports around the world.</p>
<p>The NFL picked several official authorized sports gambling companies earlier this year and in the United Kingdom, Betfred struck a partnership with one of the most prestigious rugby leagues, the Super League.</p>
