    <h1>Pahrump Nugget Hotel Casino Casino Cerca De M Casino Nyc Restaurant Doubledown Casino Promo Seneca A</h1>

<p>King Billy Casino keeps giving me the run around in the validation of SOW/SOF. I am self employed so don't have pay stubs. I have provided bank statements, invoices and they keep rejecting my documentation based on new different reasons.</p>
<p>My identity has been confirmed, bank statements are valid, but since my customers sometime will pay partial amounts to an invoice, they are not capable of verifying this information on their own. I have sent documentation even highlighting the partial payments, and even though they acknowledge that some of them show up, they seem to want a validation based on every invoice having to be named in the statements and on the exact amount, which is naturally not possible based on the nature of how my customers pay.</p>
<p>I have provided everything asked for, and more, and I've gone above and beyond what should be required to get this verified.</p>
<p>It seems to me they are doing whatever they can to avoid paying out the 900 Euro, even though I deposited a total of 1400+ euro since opening my account.</p>
<p>They also wrote that I had 30 days to provided KYC information, but they want this before processing the withdrawal.</p>
