<p>SkillOnNet is keen to deepen its understanding of the specific needs of German iGaming players with the company behind award-winning casinos such as PlayOJO and DrückGlück striking a new ambitious partnership. To this end, the company has teamed up with Hölle Games an iGaming developer of games that focuses exclusively on building games that are tailored to the expectations of local players.</p>
<p>Hölle Games has released a number of prominent titles targeting German-speaking audiences, including Ring the Wild Bell, Fruits, Bells XL, and others. The company has been building a number of unique titles that are not available outside of its portfolio, creating cutting-edge concepts, mechanics, and features.</p>
<p>One of the developer’s products, Holla die Waldfee, is an original product that carries a distinct nametag that makes it immediately recognizable to audiences in Germany. Another strong aspect of Hölle Games’ proposition is the development of the "Bonus Spin" series, which is designed once again to factor in the tastes of German players.</p>
<p>Hölle Games puts a great emphasis on building games that meet consumer expectations directly, but at the same time, it develops RTP and products that directly meet regulatory expectations. The addition of Hölle Games gives SkillOnNet another significant boost as the company seeks to establish itself as a dominant force in the European iGaming market.</p>
<p>SkillOnNet has already been able to partner with big casino brands and operators, including Mega Casino, Genting Casino, Miami Jackpots, Spin Genie, and others to name a few. Commenting on this new partnership, SkillOnNet Jani Kontturi said:</p>
<p>When it comes to developing slots that not only meet but exceed the expectations of German players there is no better studio than Hölle Games. Its games capture exactly what it means to be German and provide a highly entertaining player experience.</p>
<p>Kontturi assisted that SkillOnNet’s approach to selecting the right partners comes down not just to pure numbers, but also adding studios that understand local needs in markets that the company wishes to break into. Hölle Games is an excellent partner because of that.</p>
<p>Hölle Games Robert Lenzhofer welcomed the opportunity to be teaming up with SkillOnNet. Lenzhofer acknowledged the company’s successful track record with European casinos and said that the company was proud to bring its "Made in Germany" products to audiences in the country. Lenzhofer confirmed that it’s beyond any doubt that Hölle Games is the leading creator of iGaming titles that make the best fit for the German market.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Casino Guru also spoke with SkillOnNet VP of B2B SolutionsJerry Land with whom we discussed a number of developments for the company, including the success of the PlayUZU brand in Latin America.</p>
