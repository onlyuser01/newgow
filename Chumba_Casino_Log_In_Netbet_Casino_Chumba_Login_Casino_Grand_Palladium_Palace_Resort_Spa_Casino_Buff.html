<p>Your concerns about licensed casinos and the role of platforms like Guru in ensuring fairness and transparency are valid points to consider in the online gambling industry.</p>
<p>Enforcement of User Rights: It's essential for licensed casinos to adhere to their obligations and respect users' rights. This includes ensuring fair play, secure transactions, and timely payouts. If a casino fails in these aspects, it should indeed face repercussions to protect the interests of its users.</p>
<p>Transparency and Fairness: To maintain trust, casinos should operate transparently and fairly. Guru, as a platform that reviews and promotes casinos, has a responsibility to evaluate them objectively. If Guru provides inaccurate or biased information, it can mislead users and harm their interests.</p>
<p>License Privilege: Holding a legal license should not grant a casino an automatic privilege or excuse for unethical practices. A license is a baseline requirement, but it should be supplemented by adherence to industry standards and ethical conduct. Guru should encourage casinos to maintain high standards rather than solely promoting profit.</p>
<p>Guidance and Standards: Guru, as a review and affiliate marketing platform, should actively encourage casinos to follow the correct standards. Publicly or privately addressing errors and ethical lapses can help maintain a level of integrity in the industry. Guru's role should extend beyond promotion to include advocacy for fair and responsible gambling practices.</p>
