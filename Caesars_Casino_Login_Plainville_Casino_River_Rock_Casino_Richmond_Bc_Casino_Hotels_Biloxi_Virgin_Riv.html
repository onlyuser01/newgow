<p>New Partnership by 888 and Authentic Gaming</p>
<p>The live casino game developer Authentic Gaming has announced a new partnership with 888 casino. Under the new partnership, Authentic Gaming will be providing live casino content for clients of 888. Clients of 888 on the UK, Italian, Danish, Swedish, and several other markets will now be able to access Authentic Gaming’s casino games. Besides the live products, 888 customers will receive access to the full range of the casino game portfolio by Authentic Gaming. Authentic Gaming’s content features quite a few live casino games such as the brand’s popular live roulette. Among the top, most popular games that 888 players will gain access to the brand’s Grand Roulette, Blaze Roulette, and 24/7 Roulette.</p>
<p>The live roulette games by Authentic Gaming are actually streamed from the company’s proprietary studio located in Malta. This is where the company has located their Arena Studio which is a top-of-the-line gaming space capable of streaming high-resolution casino experience.</p>
<p>Further to the agreement, players of 888 will be able to access Authentic Roulette’s Premium Tables pack which features additional game streams from the Royal Casino in Denmark and Foxwoods Casino Resort in Connecticut. Streams from Casino International in Georgia, Aspers Stratford Casino in UK and Bad Homburg Casino in Germany will also be available for 888 players.</p>
<p>Management of both companies shares their excitement for the deal</p>
<p>Commenting on the new partnership, Authentic Gaming CEO, Jonas Delin said: “This partnership with 888 is a breakthrough moment for Authentic Gaming and marks our arrival as a leading live roulette provider. 888 one of the world’s leading online gaming and entertainment solutions providers and we are thrilled to offer our games to its players.“</p>
<p>Delin continued by saying that the company’s live roulette product is already highly popular. One of the reasons for its popularity is because nowadays more players are looking for “authentic online casino experience“. Delin further noted that Authentic Games is excited to work with such a gaming market leader as 888.</p>
<p>888 Holdings senior vice president and head of B2C, Guy Cohen also commented on the subject. He said that the company is focused on providing a vast portfolio of games. Cohen added that 888 is pleased to add the live gaming products by Authentic Gaming to the company’s platform.</p>
