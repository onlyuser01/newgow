    <h1>Candyland Casino Monarch Casino Bluewater Resort Casino Parker Casinos Near Me With Slot Machines Ne</h1>

<p>Hi.</p>
<p>Few weeks ago I registered on this website, but I start playing few days ago (around 1 week if I good remember)</p>
<p>I lost some money but I make next and next deposit and ... cuccesfull - I win some money.</p>
<p>So then I make a withdrawal request, just on 2000PLN becouse this is daily limit.</p>
<p>Next day I make next withdrawal request, as well this same amount, next day same situation.</p>
<p>Then I start playing again and I win again, good money.</p>
<p>I waiting 2 days then I received a email message about financial department need more information, I mean last 3 months of my transaction from ecopayz.</p>
<p>I send this, i send screenshoots and all statement (3months) via PDF format as well (before I send email message on support, and then confirmed about pdf format 'll be ok)</p>
<p>Now when I try send email and I ask about my withdrawal always this same answered, please wait.</p>
<p>Today is 5 working days and no answered.</p>
<p>I play on more different website and never before I not have situation like this.</p>
<p>5 days and no answered.</p>
<p>As well I send email on financial department (kyc@betinia.com) after around 30hours I received answered.</p>
<p>This answered looks like copy-paste this previous about screenahots from Ecopayz, nothing more.</p>
<p>Yesterday I send email message on support (support@betinia.com) left more like 24hours and still no answered.</p>
<p>On website was information about max time to replay is 45 minutes.</p>
