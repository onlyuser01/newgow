<p>The Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario has approved BtoBet for launch in the Canadian province of Ontario.</p>
<p>BtoBet, a pioneer in the provision of iGaming platform and sportsbook solutions, has been greenlit to launch in Ontario. This is an important milestone for the company, which has been looking to expand its presence in the NA region.</p>
<p>BtoBet to Launch in Ontario</p>
<p>BtoBet, a subsidiary of NeoGames, will now launch in the province after successfully securing the approval of the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario (AGCO). This will allow the former company to provide locally-licensed operators with its critically-acclaimed suite of sports betting tech and sportsbook solutions.</p>
<p>The foray into Canada and North America as a whole was facilitated by the GLI-33 Events Wagering System Certification BtoBet recently acquired from Gaming Laboratories International. It also follows recent events that have seen the iGaming and sports betting supplier dramatically expand its presence in Africa.</p>
<p>Maimon Excited to Expand the Brand in NA</p>
<p>Tsachi Maimon, the president of BtoBet’s parent company, NeoGames, commented on the latest development. He said that the registration approval from the AGCO represents a key milestone for the provider, which currently seeks to establish a foothold in North America.</p>
<p>Maimon added that the approval from the Ontarian regulator attests to BtoBet’s diligent work when it comes to following local regulations. He concluded that the company is looking forward to powering local operators with its acclaimed suite of sports betting tech.</p>
<p>“This approval underscores BtoBet’s exemplary track record in compliance, and we are excited to be in a position to deliver our market-leading sportsbook technology to customers in Ontario.</p>

In August, the supplier teamed up with the Ethiopian brand UtopBet. A few months prior to that, the company also joined forces with Bet237, a Cameroon-based gambling company.</p>
<p>In recent times, BtoBet expanded its team by naming the experienced Malte Hegeler as vice president of product. The new hire, boasting over 15 years of experience in the sports betting sector, will be responsible for improving the company’s pipeline and helping it produce better products.</p>
<p>Speaking about recruitment, yesterday, BtoBet announced that it is looking for a new head of development. The company said that its perfect candidate would be a “true leader who would like to have a pivotal position within a fast-growing company.”</p>
