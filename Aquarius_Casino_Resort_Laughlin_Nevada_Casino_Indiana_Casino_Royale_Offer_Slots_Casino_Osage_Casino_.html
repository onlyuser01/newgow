<p>GoSlot refuses to pay out my 14,000 euros winnings!</p>
<p>Since March 11, 2022 I have an account on GoSlot, which I have played a lot in the past. The total deposit amount will therefore amount to several 10,000 euros.</p>
<p>In the months before September I stopped gambling for a few months and therefore made no deposits. On September 26, out of the blue, I received a text message from GoSlot stating that I received a 100 euro cash bonus and later a 25 euro cash bonus. I played with this in the period from September 26 to October 2 and ultimately managed to win an amount of 14,000 euros. During the period that the bonus was active, I enforced all bonus regulations.</p>
<p>After requesting a payment of 14,000 euros, many days passed until I was told that the full amount will not be paid out due to the following two regulations:</p>
<p>'2.2.3. No deposit bonuses (money and free spin winnings) are limited to a payout of €25. Any remaining free bonus winnings exceeding the maximum amount will be waived (these terms may vary based on loyalty level).</p>
<p>2.2.4. Scatters bonuses are intended for active-player recreational playing only. An active-player is a player who has deposited and wagered a minimum of €20 or more in the past 30 days. Only active players can participate from non deposit offers.</p>
<p>However, in my opinion, both regulations have been used incorrectly. I will explain my reasoning below for each regulation.</p>
<p>2.2.3: I previously heard from my VIP manager Liam that there is no maximum bonus winnings for my account due to my high VIP level. The regulations also describe that the 25 euro rule depends very much on the VIP level. Liam previously sent me an email in which he indicated that there is no maximum withdrawal limit for my account with cash bonuses. This email has been added to the photos. I also have several examples in the past where I was able to pay out more than 25 euros with a cash bonus.</p>
<p>2.2.4 Goslot personally offered me this bonus through my VIP manager and added it to my account, thereby giving me permission to use the bonus. Here too, I believe that my VIP level should play a role in the decision-making process.</p>
<p>I would still like to see the amount paid out. Looking at the entire situation and the fact that so much money has been transferred from me to GoSlot in the past, it seems fair to me that they should accommodate me in this regard.</p>
