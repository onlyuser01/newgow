    <h1>Casino Resort Hotels American Online Casino Sands Casino Best Slot Machines To Play At The Casino Ba</h1>

<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>I deposited 155.11€ with this casino on 22nd April and received a 100% match deposit bonus.</p>
<p>At the moment I finished the wagering my balance was automatically cut by the system from about 1.015€ to 655€, leaving 500€ of winnings + my deposit.</p>
<p>Parimatchwin claims that this bonus had a maximum win amount of 500 EUR and therefore my balance has been cut by the system.</p>
<p>That claim is FALSE. The bonus did NOT have any maximum winning.</p>
<p>These are the bonus terms from that 100% Easter deposit bonus:</p>
<p>Parimatchwin casino states that term 8 would state a maximum winning. As you can see from the screenshots above, it does NOT. Point 8 states the maximum bonus amount you could receive by depositing which was 500€.</p>
<p>They have now changed their terms regarding this Easter bonus and added the word "winning amount" in term 8 and also edited the increased the amount to 800 EUR:</p>
<p>https://www.parimatchwin.com/promotions/easter-100</p>
<p>-These were not the terms from the moment I played and requested a withdraw, which you can see above on my screenshots. -</p>
<p>I also checked with their live chat agent BEFORE depositing, who assured me that there is no maximum winning from bonus funds (only from the free spins that I did not use). That is the chat log with their agent:</p>
<p>In conclusion:</p>
<p>1.) Bonus terms do not state any maximum winning from bonus funds.</p>
<p>2.) Chst agent does state that there is NO maximum winning from bonus funds</p>
<p>-&gt; still my balance has been cut wrongfully.</p>
<p>I already tried to solve this matter with a) their live chat and b) their email support. They investigated the incident and stand by their decision. (you find that logs attached)</p>
<p>I kindly ask Parimatchwin to reinstate my wrongfully cut balance of about 360€.</p>
<p>On a side note: my account is fully KYC verified and I made deposits totalling 350 EUR and withdrawals totalling 4.200 EUR without any problems in the past.</p>
