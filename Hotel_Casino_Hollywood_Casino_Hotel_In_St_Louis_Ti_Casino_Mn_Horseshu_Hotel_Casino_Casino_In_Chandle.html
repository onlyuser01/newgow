    <h1>Hotel Casino Hollywood Casino Hotel In St Louis Ti Casino Mn Horseshu Hotel Casino Casino In Chandle</h1>

<p>Dear Rejo556,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. Iâ€™m sorry to hear about your withdrawal problem. I have checked the general bonus terms and conditions, and this is what I found (here):</p>
<p>"Country Based Restrictions</p>
<p>Based on your country of residence, restrictions apply to playing at the Casino, the use of bonuses, redemption of free chips and/or deposits via credit card. We retain the right to lift these restrictions on an individual basis. Carefully go through the constraints that may apply. You may view all country restrictions in this PDF document or you can download it in MS Word format to check your status.</p>
<p>You can contact us in order to appeal for any country-based restriction(s). The Casino shall assess your account and make the final call based on your case."</p>
<p>Could you please advise if your account has been fully verified already? Have you redeemed any Free Bonuses in the past? I would like to emphasize, that according to our fair gambling codex https://casino.guru/fair-gambling-codex-for-casinos#restricted-bonuses, we believe that casinos should only give bonuses to players who are allowed to get them according to the Bonus T&amp;Cs. And if the casino makes the mistake of granting a bonus to a player who shouldn't have received it, the casino shouldn't take it away from them. Instead, the casino should accept that it was their mistake and pay out the winnings to the player.</p>
<p>I hope we will be able to help you to resolve this issue as soon as possible. Looking forward to hearing from you.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
