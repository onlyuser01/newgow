    <h1>Casino In Washington Dc Casinos In Maryland Watch Casino 1995 Casino In Jacksonville Fl Durant Casin</h1>

<p>NineCasino has become the first plug-and-play casino brand launched on DUXGroup Holding’s namesake iGaming platform designed to enable businesses to set up casinos in a few simple steps.</p>
<p>Establishing a Swift Setup for iGaming Operators</p>
<p>DUXPlatform, as the solution is aptly called, already features games by leading suppliers, including Evolution, NetEnt, Microgaming, Play’n Go, and Pragmatic, and 20 payment providers that make the platform regulation-ready and easy to implement.</p>
<p>NineCasino is launching with 3,000 games under its belt and various promotions. Commenting on the event, casino chief executive Michael Newell said that DUXPlatform was the solution that the team had hoped to find when the project was first incepted five months ago. He added:</p>
<p>“We are grateful to the DUXPlatform team for their prompt response and the opportunity to improve the product based on our wishes.”</p>
<p>DUX is built around the idea of providing owners with a full overview of operations, including registered users, expected LTV, and churn rate for consumers. DUXPlatform uses algorithms that allow it to analyze consumer behavior and set apart VIP customers early into the process, giving the owners and managers a more targeted approach.</p>
<p>Creating a Comprehensive Solution for Casinos</p>
<p>DUXPlatform deals with something called “low-quality traffic,” whereby the people who register do not show interest in playing. The DUX solution also extends numerous options to casino owners willing to work with DUXPlatform, including VIP, Antifraud, CRM, legal, and PSP support.</p>
<p>DUXGroup CMO Edward Swan has thanked and welcomed NineCasino for trusting the company product and becoming the first brand to launch its operations, choosing the automated platform. He explained that the team was happy to carry the load and look over each partner brand’s future success.</p>
<p>DUXGroup’s portfolio presently features numerous assets, including DUXGroup Ventures, DUXPlatform, and DUXGroup Operations.</p>
