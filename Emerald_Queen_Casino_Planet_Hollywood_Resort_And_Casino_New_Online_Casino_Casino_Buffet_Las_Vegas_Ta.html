<p>LSports, an Israeli provider of Innovative sports betting data API for the sports betting industry, has struck a major new M&amp;A deal. The sports feed specialist will acquire Statscore, a Polish sports data company.</p>
<p>Statscore to Become a Part of LSports</p>
<p>Per the agreement, LSports will acquire Statscore in a deal that will help it reach new heights. This is notably the Israeli sports data company’s first European acquisition, marking a new chapter in its efforts to establish a foothold in Europe.</p>
<p>LSports pointed out that the acquisition of its Polish peer will help the former company reinforce its data collection capabilities. Under the agreement, LSports will be able to integrate a fully-developed data center that currently covers 30 sports.</p>
<p>Following the Statscore acquisition, LSports will strengthen its European footprint, providing it with further expansion opportunities. The company is ambitious to grow its presence in many regulated jurisdictions across Europe, the United States, Latin America and Asia.</p>
<p>The Deal Will Yield Results Sooner than Anyone Can Expect</p>
<p>Speaking about the current deal, Dotan Lazar, the co-founder and chief executive officer of LSports, said that his team has “full confidence” in Statscore’s products. Furthermore, he trusts the Polish sports data specialist’s team and believes that the acquisition will allow LSports to produce more tech-based in-depth content.</p>
<p>Lazar added that the acquisition of Statscore will propel LSports forward, allowing it to boost its business-to-business offering. His current ambition is to double the company’s productivity. In addition, he believes that the current deal will allow LSports and Statscore to produce new and innovative data-powered sports products.</p>
<p>I believe the acquisition of Statscore will lead us to new heights, more B2B products, personalization and data validation tools that will bring our accuracy level to 100%. Dotan Lazar, CEO, LSports</p>
<p>Statscore’s chief operating officer, Dariusz Łęczyński, on the other hand, said that joining LSports felt like a “natural move” for his team. He said that his company felt as if it had been a successful partner of LSports for a long time.</p>
<p>Similar visions, yet different approaches to the products and data collection made each company unique. This spectacular potential has a chance to explode once combined. Dariusz Łęczyński, COO, Statscore</p>
<p>Łęczyński concluded that he is thrilled to join LSports and explore the future with the Israeli company. He added that he believes the M&amp;A deal will yield great results faster than anyone can imagine.</p>
<p>LSports continues its global expansion as it aims to conquer many regulated markets. A year ago, the company received a sports betting license in Colorado, allowing it to expand its reach in the United States.</p>
