<p>SRI, a global executive search and talent consulting firm focused on shaping the futures of companies across the media, content, technology, and sport, has made a new addition to its leadership by acquiring gambling industry veteran Ben Fried.</p>
<p>Ben Fried Joins SRI</p>
<p>Fried is joining SRI as its new head of betting and gaming practice for London. Prior to becoming a part of the SRI family, Ben Fried has worked in various betting and communications companies and has vast experience in the field.</p>
<p>Fried has worked as a part of the online gambling company Betfair for more than six years. His years-long career there saw him begin as an insight analyst in 2002. With time, Fried rose to head of business intelligence, then to poker operations manager, and finally to a general manager.</p>
<p>Fried served as Betfair’s general manager for four years before moving to Microgaming in January 2012. There, he served as an advisor for the operator’s poker network management board for two years.</p>
<p>Fried’s gambling experience then carries on to several other companies. He founded Gaming Edge Associates and served as its director for four years. Simultaneously, he worked as Plumbee’s advisor for almost four years.</p>
<p>He has other stints in several non-gambling-related companies as well. He served as a chief operations officer of easyCar, GM for UK and Ireland at Catawiki, held various positions in Edge Retreats, and worked as LoopUp’s EVP Group Commercial.</p>
<p>Fried’s Talents Are Welcomed by the SRI Team</p>
<p>Fried spoke about his new position, revealing that he is thrilled to be joining SRI:</p>
<p>“Its (the company’s) deep expertise in sport, entertainment and technology will bring significant value to betting and gaming clients as they are closely aligned sectors in a converging world.” SRI head of betting and gaming Ben Fried</p>
<p>He is sure that the combination of the company’s global presence in various regions, most notably in the United States and the Asia-Pacific region, and the skilled and talented SRI consultants will help to differentiate SRI’s offerings even more.</p>
<p>Jim Chaplin, the chief executive officer of SRI, also spoke on the new acquisition. Chaplin said that he is delighted to welcome Fried to the company. The CEO believes that Fried’s knowledge of both business-to-business and business-to-customer environments and his overall industry experience will be invaluable. Chaplin is sure that Fried’s vast knowledge will help leadership teams “transform their businesses.”</p>
<p>“Ben’s positive and collaborative approach aligns with SRI’s culture and values, and he will be a tremendous asset to our firm,” Chaplin concluded.</p>
