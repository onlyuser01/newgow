    <h1>Casino Age Casino In Natchez Ms Valley View Casino And Hotel Casino Illinois Oklahoma Casino Map Veg</h1>

<p>Dear casino guru team,</p>
<p>I played in the mentioned casino and finally earned the sum of € 3,761 with my € 600 deposit. I mainly played the Bonus Buy which was between € 100 and € 300. During the game I apparently achieved bronze and silver status and as I was told afterwards, a cash drop of € 100 and € 30 was credited to my account. I have not received any information about these amounts and only became aware of the problem through a forum post.</p>
<p>According to chat, I probably did not receive the information because I did not check the box for information via email and SMS. Since I played the games pretty quickly, I never noticed the cash drop received while playing.</p>
<p>The € 30 was in my player account after a payout. At that point I thought I had forgotten to debit the amount. Accordingly, I canceled my payout for € 3,365, made a bonus buy twice and finally € 3,761 was paid out.</p>
<p>Through the conversation in the chat, I noticed that I got the cash drop of € 100 during the first few games.</p>
<p>In total, I deposited € 4,600 before the 600 € without being able to make a withdrawal.</p>
<p>Now the amount of € 3,761 will probably not be paid out to me and I ask for your support, as the cash drop was not displayed to me and I had no chance to object.</p>
<p>I would like to enclose my chat history in English and all transactions (deposit, withdrawal, betting) with you, but unfortunately there are probably too many pages. I will be happy to provide this by email.</p>
<p>According to the chat I got the 100 € cashdrop on October 28th. at 13:54 and a € 30 cash drop on October 29th. credited at 12:02 pm.</p>
<p>Thanks very much.</p>
