    <h1>Arizona Charlie S Casino Strip Vegas Map Casinos Casino De Montreal Casino In Springfield Ma Casinos</h1>

<p>Hello !</p>
<p>Recently you helped me with another casino so now I am asking you to help me with Simple Casino.</p>
<p>Always played with pure cash at this casino with no bonuses.</p>
<p>Almost 2 weeks ago, I won 1,100 euros and wanted to withdraw it immediately. Even though I always deposited with card and confirmed Bank ID my first withdrawal request was removed and asked to withdraw on ecopayz.</p>
<p>Up to now, 9 of my withdrawal attempts have been rejected despite full verification of identity or recovery and attempts to withdraw to ecopayz.</p>
<p>48 hours ago, I reached an agreement on a manual payment to my account and provided full details. However, today it was rejected again this time by a technical problem (I think it's at least 5 times when they give such a reason)</p>
<p>I don't know what to do anymore, every withdrawal request is rejected ....</p>
