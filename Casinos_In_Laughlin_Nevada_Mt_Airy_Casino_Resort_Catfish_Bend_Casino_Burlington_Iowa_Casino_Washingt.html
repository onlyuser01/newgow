<p>Chilli Heat Megaways review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Chilli Heat Megaways is themed around a Mexican street party.</p>
<p>Players will turn down a colorful street and find a rollicking festival underway. Bottles of hot sauce, adorable chihuahuas, and plenty of tequila await.</p>
<p>This slot is well-suited to players longing for a warm holiday and a cheerful atmosphere.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The upbeat soundtrack adds plenty of flair with its Mariachi band style. Players will feel ready to dance their way through festive streets. The beat quickens upon spins adding additional drama.</p>
<p>The animation quality is solid and offers a warmly hued color palette. Players will notice several iconic Mexican items on the reels including chilled tequila shots, hot chilis, and letters adorned like piñatas.</p>
<p>The most adorable symbol is the chihuahua who looks out keenly from his reel, ready to play. His large eyes and smiling face make this slot especially welcoming.</p>
<p>Beyond the reels, a Mexican cobblestone street can be seen with cacti and hot chilis hanging in bundles. Each house is painted a bright bright color, adding to the unique Mexican vibe.</p>
<p>Overall, the animation and soundtrack of Chili Heat Megaways offer a friendly, exotic atmosphere.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Chilli Heat Megaways randomizes the number of symbols that appear in each reel for every spin using the Megaways system.</p>
<p>Players are awarded wins for landing matching symbols in adjacent reels starting from the leftmost reel and going towards the rightmost. This is sometimes called the Any Way Wins system.</p>
<p>Whenever symbols are part of a winning combination they will disappear, making way for new symbols to fall in from above in a Cascade.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol appears on reels 2, 3, 4, and 5 and substitutes for all symbols except the Money symbol.</p>
<p>The Money symbol takes on a randomly selected value for each spin and appears on reels 2-5. When players land at least 6 Money symbols, the Respin feature is triggered.</p>
<p>As the Respin feature begins, all regular symbols are removed from the reels, leaving only the Money symbols that triggered the feature. If at least 1 additional Money symbol lands, the respin count is reset to 3 and the feature continues until all respins are used up or the reels have been filled with Money symbols.</p>
<p>While in the Respin feature, players can unlock extra reels that offer special symbols. These special symbols have a range of properties, including multiplying the numbe of Money symbols on the reels by x2-x10, collecting Money symbols, and unlocking special reels.</p>
<p>If players wish, they can buy directly into the Respin feature for x100 their current bet.</p>
<p>Players can also select the Ante Bet feature which offers a number of bet multipliers that change the game’s behavior. An example is if players choose a bet multiplier of x25 or higher increases the number of Money symbols on the reels and their odds of being awarded the Respins feature.</p>
