    <h1>Hotels Near Choctaw Casino Durant Ok Nashville Casino Casino Queens California Hotel Casino Las Vega</h1>

<ul>
<li>
<p>the disputed amount is an estimated sum since I had lot of substantial open bets and I was blocked before these were closed. It can be more, it can be less, no way for me to check. But not less then 1000€ in any case.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Account opened october 2022, successfully completed the verification and played sports and casino together</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Played the same way the whole time, combined casino with sports.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During the time before blocking the account in September 2023 I had deposits of €4300 and withdrawals of €450.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The block and the typical message about flagged account and breaking the infamous nothing and everything rule came maybe one hour after I tried to withdraw 200€ from some winings.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I played sports based on my preferences and the value I saw in games that were offered from Supra, I don't see any possibility for an unfair advantage there, they always keep the right to block any game or to declare the game void, as any other betting house, there is nothing special here. I claim I used my brain only to find the games where I found value and there is no way to prove the contrary.</p>
<p>Also I traveled often to Serbia this year and I logged myself lot from Serbia too, but there is no crime or advantage there too, I am from Serbia, gave them serbian passport during the verification. I can show plain tickets if needed, not that someone asked me to.</p>
<p>Of course I always used my one and only account.</p>
<p>The only casino game I played is holdem poker from evoplay, and I played it in different ways, using different tactics. But mostly I used thw tactic double the buy in if I lost the last hand, and follow up on a good hand. And so on. And this game is played against the dealer. I would bet harder in case I have a good hand and I would leave the game if I have winings.</p>
<p>Since I believe or suspect that they have some software that follows the player behavior, and they tend to be more generous at the beginning to get you into the game I combined suprabets casino with casinos that offer the same evoplay game.</p>
<p>So, I have also I think 1win, babibet, zenit, cloudbet, rabona, pinup...that offer the same game. My tactics to fight the software AI programming sucking me into the game was 15€ rule, as soon as I win 15€ I go to the same game by different casino. The same rule goes for losing, and I had some other tactics, but no need to share the whole thing.</p>
<p>Long Story short, I don't see how does any of this break any rules and why is my account blocked and why is my money stolen.</p>
<p>I only got one answer from them informing me they have the right to steal my money since it is written somewhere in their rules.</p>
<p>I hope there is some way you can help me, thanks in advance.</p>
