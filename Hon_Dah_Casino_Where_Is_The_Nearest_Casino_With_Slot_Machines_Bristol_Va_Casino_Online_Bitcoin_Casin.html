    <h1>Hon Dah Casino Where Is The Nearest Casino With Slot Machines Bristol Va Casino Online Bitcoin Casin</h1>

<p>Dear Иван,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. I have checked terms and conditions, and this is what I found https://www.megaslot.com/terms-and-conditions:</p>
<p>"Any deposit has to be wagered 3 times (player must place bets three times of their deposit amount) before the withdrawal of funds connected to this deposit is available. In case several deposits were made with no gaming activity, player has to wager the total amount of these deposits prior to withdrawal. Otherwise the Casino has a right to charge a fee for the procession of deposit and withdrawal, which is at the sole decision of the Casino."</p>
<p>It is not unusual for a casino to have this rule. Some casinos require deposit wagering 1x, some 3x or 5x, but you can find casinos with even higher wagering requirements for real money.</p>
<p>Mandatory real money wagering has been introduced by the AML (Anti-Money Laundering) Regulations for Gaming and Gambling Industry and is usually set by the Licensing Authority. All the serious and licensed casinos have to comply and follow these policies.</p>
<p>Please let us know if this explanation was satisfactory. Looking forward to hearing from you.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
