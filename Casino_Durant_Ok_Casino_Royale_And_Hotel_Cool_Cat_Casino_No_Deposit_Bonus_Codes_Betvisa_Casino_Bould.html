    <h1>Casino Durant Ok Casino Royale And Hotel Cool Cat Casino No Deposit Bonus Codes Betvisa Casino Bould</h1>

<p>Ok so this casino ran a promotion for two weeks that once a day you get a $50 chip. 10x play through $100 max cash out. After those two weeks were up you could still get $50/day (same restrictions) after you had deposited at least once that day.</p>
<p>so today I made my deposit, played it through (lost) and used the coupon 2WELCOME50 to claim my $50. Over the course of the next hour or so I played mainly Khrysos Gold and racked up almost $500 before I purposely started betting $10 to work through the rest of my play through. Once I did, as expected, my balance dropped from around $320 to $100. I went to the withdrawal page and tapped on the instant Bitcoin withdrawal option (it was the only option). I had already submitted my KYC during the first round of $50 chips so I was already approved (i didn’t make a withdrawal that time because I was a bit below the $100 mark and my hubris got the best of me). So I entered the $100 in the withdrawal amount field (which is what my withdrawabke balance showed) and hit next, and I got this big red screen saying there was a $20nfee and since I was $20’short I couldn’t withdraw. So I went back and tried entering $80 but it was below the minimum so I couldn’t. That’s when I contacted support. He was mildly helpful but mostly just confused and wouldn’t answer the question I asked repeatedly until I sent him a screenshot and he basically just said "you need $120." I kept saying that the fee should be more apparent earlier on and/or if you’re gonna have a max cash out include the fee with the leftover balance at the end after play though (or set it aside in case you don’t want to do Bitcoin but I saw no other option). So basically I was left with the one option of risking my winnings to add $20 for the fee. So I tried and guess what? I lost everything. So I think this is completely bogus because a) there is no indication of the fee beforehand, b) the fee shouldn’t be deducted with the excess if there’s a max cash out - bc I had plenty of money to cover it) and c) now I’m left with nothing because of some bullshit technicality. Also $20??? That’s ridiculously high. Most places don’t charge anythjng near that much (some don’t charge anything!). So basically I want my $100. I won it fair and square, followed all the rules and got tripped up by some shady last minute bullshit.</p>
