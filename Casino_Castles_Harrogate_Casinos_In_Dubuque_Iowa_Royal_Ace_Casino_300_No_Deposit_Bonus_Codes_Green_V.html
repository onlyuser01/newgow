    <h1>Casino Castles Harrogate Casinos In Dubuque Iowa Royal Ace Casino 300 No Deposit Bonus Codes Green V</h1>

<p>Hi Petronela,</p>
<p>Thank you for your help!</p>
<p>I had an account with goldenbet a few months ago which I asked to be closed down, when asked why I said personal reasons - I found I was losing more than winning so just wanted to remove myself from the account. To answer your second question I am on gamstop which is why I use goldenbet as it is marketed as a casino you can use that isn't on gamstop. I tried to log in using my old account details, but when this wouldn't work I made a new account, assuming the old account deleted months ago wouldn't have an impact. Note that when I had to sign up I had to give details such as my full name, phone number, address, bank details etc. and was able to deposit over 600 pounds without an issue.</p>
<p>I didn't use any of the new bonuses or anything like that for my bets, they didn't interest me. All my winnings came from live casino, I got lucky with some sidebets.</p>
<p>After I sent this initial request for help I once again got in touch with goldenbet via their live chat. I was told a now different reason for them taking the money from me, apparently I have violated terms and conditions but they refuse to tell me which ones when I ask. One minute it is because of responsible gambling policy, next I am violating terms of service apparently?....</p>
<p>My argument here is that I have done nothing wrong and should have access to the money which I won fair and square on the live casino. If their argument is that I shouldn't have been allowed to make an account and gamble, then at the very least I should be refunded the 600 I was allowed to deposit. It doesn't seem to make any sense to me that I was able to put 600 into an account I was never able to actually use and gamble and then not be entitled to it back.</p>
<p>I hope this makes sense and you can understand my points on view and frustrations on this matter. I have emailed goldenbet asking for details about what I have done wrong but have received no answer.</p>
<p>Thanks again for your help in this matter.</p>
