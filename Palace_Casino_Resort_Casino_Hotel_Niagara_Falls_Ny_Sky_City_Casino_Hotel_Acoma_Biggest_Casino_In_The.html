    <h1>Palace Casino Resort Casino Hotel Niagara Falls Ny Sky City Casino Hotel Acoma Biggest Casino In The</h1>

<p>Leading provider of technology serving the gaming and entertainment industries Win Systems has installed its top-tier Gold Club Lumina electronic roulette at the Hialeah Park Casino. The casino is located in Hialeah, Miami and it will give Floridians the chance to try a Gold Club electronic roulette product for the first time in history. The importance of the installation is also fueled by the relevance of its new location combined with Win Systems’ intention to grow in the US.</p>
<p>Why the Hialeah Park Casino?</p>
<p>The venue is known as “the world’s most beautiful race course” thanks to its luxuriant gardens, thriving landscape, and architecture inspired by the French Mediterranean architecture style originating in the 1500s. The casino itself only opened in the summer of 2013, but the building has been in existence since 1922 in various forms. In 1925, the race track started hosting thoroughbreds. The beautiful buildings have been listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The environment is home to a huge population of flamingos, which is why it has received an Audubon Bird Sanctuary distinction.</p>
<p>The casino itself spreads across 90,000 square feet and is home to 23 poker tables and 882 slots and electronic table games. There is also a full-service luxury hotel available for casino patrons and simple guests, along with fresh entertainment venues and a dedicated commercial space that promote a vibrant city center in the Hialeah area.</p>
<p>Win Systems Continuing US Expansion</p>
<p>Win Systems’s executive vice president and general manager Chad Dickie said they were “honored and proud” to have a casino like Hialeah Park put its trust in their “extensive experience” and bet on their Gold Club electronic roulettes. The new installation is even more important for the company given the casino’s “relevance” in relation to Win Systems’ plans to expand its foothold in the US. Dickie also explained that the company is currently “living in a great moment” in the country which is not only tied to its successful WIGOS management system but also to its excellent gaming products. The company gave thanks to the casino’s management team, with special emphasis on the vice president and general manager for Gaming Operations Steve Calabro as well as Javier Fernandez, the casino’s director of slot operations.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, the sports betting market in Florida does not seem to have a bright future ahead any time soon. In July, the Court of Appeals announced a case regarding a tribal compact that will most likely be carried on until at least the end of the current year. In April, Win Systems signed an agreement with Gaming Laboratories International to turn it into its exclusive certification partner.</p>
