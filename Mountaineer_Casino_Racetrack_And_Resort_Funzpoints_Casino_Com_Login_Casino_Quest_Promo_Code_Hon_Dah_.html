    <h1>Mountaineer Casino Racetrack And Resort Funzpoints Casino Com Login Casino Quest Promo Code Hon Dah</h1>

<p>Hi I joined euro bets at the start of October and played with there welcome bonus offer to deposit £500 via Bitcoin for £5000 bonus. I then proceeded to play slots with this to clear the wagering amount and I completed the wagering with a total balance of £6909. After I had won this amount I proceeded to withdraw my funds which had a maximum amount of £500 at a time back to my crypto account the first withdrawal was completed within 2 weeks so I saw no issues with getting the rest out. I then tried to process another £500 and it still hasn’t been processed to this day. I have repeated the process and also contacted them so many times now via live chat on there website and they have been no help at all. They simply keep saying it will be sorted soon but it’s been 6 months now and I feel I’m not gonna get my money any other way than via a complaint to the casino. I have also lodged an internal complaint against the casino to which I had no response.</p>
<p>Please can you help me to try and recover my winnings from them many thanks.</p>
