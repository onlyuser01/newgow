<p>The global sports technology company, Genius Sports Limited, expanded further its North American footprint by securing a new license. The company announced Wednesday it has secured a temporary sports wagering vendor license in Massachusetts.</p>
<p>The news came after the company received a green light from the gambling regulator in the state, the Massachusetts Gaming Commission (MGC). As a result, Genius is now temporarily certificated for a sports wagering vendor license for 12 months.</p>
<p>Securing a license in Massachusetts marks an exciting moment for the company as it continues to grow its presence in the US and North America. Currently, Genius holds 41 licenses within different jurisdictions in the US and Canada, delivering its leading services and technology to a growing portfolio of clients.</p>
<p>In a statement released on February 1, 2023, Genius, CEO, Mark Locke, said: "We are honored that the Massachusetts Gaming Commission has awarded Genius Sports its temporary sports wagering vendor authorization to provide licensed sportsbooks with access to our exclusive NFL wagering products and media solutions."</p>
<p>Finally, he explained: "As an ever expanding number of US states legalize sports betting, Genius Sports welcomes the opportunity to work with states like Massachusetts, on providing sports fans with official sports data-powered solutions to power their sportsbooks."</p>
<p>Massachusetts launched its legal retail sports betting market on January 31, 2023. The launch comes just in time for the upcoming Super Bowl. Yet, sports fans will have to wait a few more months before the introduction of mobile sports betting, which is planned to be rolled out at some point in March or even later.</p>
<p>Besides Genius, the MGC recently awarded temporary licenses to other companies within the sports sector. Sportradar, the leading sports technology company, secured a temporary license from the gambling regulator in Massachusetts as well. This expanded further the company's reach in North America, which now holds 44 licenses.</p>
<p>Again, in Massachusetts, the gaming and sports betting entertainment giant, BetMGM, announced the launch of its retail sports betting outlet. Earlier this week, the company confirmed it has started accepting wagers at its BetMGM Sportsbook and Lounge outlet located at MGM Springfield in Massachusetts.</p>
<p>Besides Massachusetts, according to the American Gaming Association (AGA), sports betting is available in some form in 33 states as well as DC. There are six states that currently do not have legislation for the legalization of the activity, while lawmakers in eight states are pushing for the legalization of sports wagering. Three US states have already legalized the activity but are yet to launch it, reveals AGA.</p>
