Meanwhile, Desert Diamond Sports managed to win in two separate categories, distinguishing itself in the newly-established Tribal Gaming Operator of the Year, and Rising Star of the Year category.</p>

<p>SciPlay was distinguished as the Social Gaming Operator of the Year and the Ontario Lottery &amp; Gaming Corporation won another important accolade, leaving the event with the Socially Responsible Operator of the Year silverware to its name. There were other operators, too. IGTPlaySports became the Sportsbook Supplier of the Year.</p>
<p>Evolution cemented its position as the Casino Supplier of the Year, and Bragg Gaming Group was hailed for what has been a year full of innovation, bringing it the Innovation of the Year. Scientific Games naturally won the Supplier of the Year. Epic Risk Management won the Player Protection Service Provider of the Year for the second time in a row at the event, and Sportradar was distinguished with Sports Data Product.</p>
<p>OpenBet managed to snatch the Platform Provider of the Year and Land-Based Betting &amp; Gaming Product, Chalkline ended up with the Marketing &amp; Services Provider and Low6, a gamification specialist, deservingly won the Acquisition &amp; Retention Partner of the Year.</p>
<p>Dylan Slaney, Light &amp; Wonder’s CEO, was named Leader of the Year whereas the distinction for Operator &amp; Supplier was awarded to Betting Herro. Better Collective became the Sports Affiliate of the Year and Gambling.com Group was awarded the Casino Affiliate of the Year. Playmaker Capital was announced as the winner of the Sports Media Company of the Year.</p>
<p>This new edition of the event also featured new Tribal categories, three in total. They had to do with Tribal Leader of the Year (Jammie Hummingbird) and Tribal Regulator (Pokagon Band Gaming Commission).</p>
<p>Payment &amp; Compliance saw Trustly become the Payment Solution of the Year. Meanwhile, GLI won the Compliance Solution &amp; Partner of the Year, and Fiserv ended up with the Payment Innovation of the Year.</p>
<p>The 2023 SBC North America Summit was largely a success and the Awards ceremony was a proper way to crown it. Sojmark did not miss to thank the headline sponsors for the event, which included SBC Advisory Partners, White Hat Gaming, and BetConstruct.</p>
