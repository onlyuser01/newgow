    <h1>Golden Nugget Las Vegas Hotel Casino Grand Victoria Casino Elgin Fitzgeralds Casino Tunica Hotels Ne</h1>

<p>Pala Casino, NASCAR, and RFK Racing have signed an important strategic agreement that will come into effect during the Pala casino 400 NASCAR Cup Series</p>
<p>The event will also introduce Pala Casino as National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing’s (NASCAR) Title Sponsor for the Cup Series race called The Pala Casino 400, according to Pala Casino’s chief executive officer Fred Buro. The February 26 race that will take place in Fontana, California will be the second race part of the NASCAR Cup Series regular season, representing the follow-up to the DAYTONA 500.</p>
<p>It’s All About the Action</p>
<p>Buro also spoke about the “action” element that both racing and casinos have in common. While Pala Casino features spinning reels and NASCAR features spinning wheels, both of them are known to spin fast and trigger engaging experiences for participants and players, ultimately creating winners.</p>
<p>Buro also explained that the Pala Casino crew and the Pala Band of Mission Indians were “very proud” to be able to sponsor the upcoming NASCAR Cup Series race. He added that they were also looking forward to their lucrative partnership for the upcoming years.</p>
<p>NASCAR is the sanctioning organization for the top form of motorsports in the US. It owns 16 of the country’s greatest motorsports entertainment facilities and features three national series: NASCAR Cup Series, NASCAR Xfinity Series, and NASCAR Camping World Truck Series. NASCAR also consists of four regional series, three international series, and a local grassroots series.</p>
<p>Chris Buescher’s No. 17 RFK Ford Will Carry Pala’s Colors</p>
<p>Chris Buescher’s No. 17 RFK Ford has also been chosen to carry the Pala Casino colors once the green flag will be seen waving to announce the start of the race.</p>
<p>RFK Racing marked three and a half decades of seasonal competitions last year. The racing features an impressive lineup of iconic ownerships including the owner of the Fenway Sports Group John Henry and NASCAR Champion Brad Keselowski.</p>
<p>According to Auto Club Speedway’s president Dave Allen, their fans are expected to rapidly perceive the enthusiasm that Pala Casino will bring along. Allen also called the new partnership between NASCAR, The Auto Club Speedway, Pala Casino, and RFK Racing a “winning combination.”</p>
<p>Auto Club Speedway is located 50 miles east of Los Angeles and it represents California’s premier facility for motorsports. Each year, the club organizes more than 320 days of track activity. Among the most resounding events is, of course, the NASCAR Cup Series weekend.</p>
<p>The Club also hosts a variety of movie, TV, and commercial productions, club racing, racing schools, new car testing, and photo shoots.</p>
<p>The 2022 NASCAR Cup Series Championship Race was held on November 6 at the Phoenix Raceway located in Arizona.</p>
