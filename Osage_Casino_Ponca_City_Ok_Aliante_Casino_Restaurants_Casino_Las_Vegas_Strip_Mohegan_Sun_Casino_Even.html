<p>New Hampshire’s Boston Billiard Club &amp; Casino Renamed, Sportsbook Opens</p>

<p>Boston Billiard Club &amp; Casino is now Gate City Casino. The name is inspired by its location, Nashua, N.H.</p>

<p>The city is sometimes called “Gate City” because it acts as a gateway to the metro Boston region. The name change is an apparent tribute to the area.</p>
<p>Last October, Delaware North, a hospitality and entertainment company, acquired Boston Billiard Club &amp; Casino. The company is responsible for the name change.</p>
<p>We renamed it the Gate City Casino to pay homage to its location and history in Nashua,” Brian Hansberry, president of Delaware North’s gaming division, said in a recent statement. “Much like Nashua’s history as the travel and economic/cultural ‘gateway’ between the major city of Boston to Manchester, Concord, and all of New Hampshire, the new name reflects the expanded casino’s significance to the region.”</p>
<p>Delaware North is also planning to eventually move Gate City Casino to the 337-room Sheraton Nashua hotel. Delaware North now owns the hotel.</p>
<p>Gate City Casino contributes a portion of the proceeds to approved nonprofit organizations as a charitable gaming property.</p>
<p>Boston Billiard Club &amp; Casino has been a popular entertainment venue in Nashua since 2000 and is the longest operating charitable casino in the city, contributing more than $15 million to local and state charitable organizations since 2016,” according to Hansberry.</p>
<p>With the name change comes several updates. The casino will also have over 500 gaming machines by the end of next month. A new poker room also recently opened with approximately 19 table games.</p>
<p>DraftKings’ Newest Location</p>
<p>Nashua is also the newest location of a DraftKings sportsbook. It became the fourth DraftKings sportsbook in New Hampshire. The new sportsbook will include 12 self-service sports betting kiosks and an over-the-counter window for wagers. TV screens will show athletic events.</p>
<p>DraftKings also plans to launch online operations in Kentucky on September 28.</p>
<p>Mall Casino Coming to Nashua</p>
<p>Elsewhere in Nashua, ECL Entertainment and Clairvest, a Toronto-based private equity firm, plan to open a 130,000-square-foot charitable gaming complex at the Pheasant Lane Mall in late 2024, according to New Hampshire Business Review.</p>
<p>ECL will reassign licenses from its Lucky Moose Casino &amp; Tavern and River Casino &amp; Sports Bar. Both are in Nashua.</p>
