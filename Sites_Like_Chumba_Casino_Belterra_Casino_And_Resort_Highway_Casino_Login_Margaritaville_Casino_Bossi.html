    <h1>Sites Like Chumba Casino Belterra Casino And Resort Highway Casino Login Margaritaville Casino Bossi</h1>

<p>Im just curious why the Guru advertises and guides American players to sportsbetting sites, poker and/or Casinos when they know they have no license? There are only 8 actual states in the US that allow online gambling. Dont get me wrong, Im guilty of playing online for years however, after Bush put the lock on us its been hit and miss. I have been fortunate and gotten paid here and there. It wasnt because I went to the Guru for help. I did it myself and so has my wife. And believe me, its a long and painstaking process. They actually recommend BetUS! I about fell over. When you feel the games are being manipulated, they are. They claim to be in Costa Rica when they are in Canada. Whats in Costa Rica is their corrupt Govt that they try and convince you regulates numerous online gambling sites. Its all about the internet and the fact that America has no DOJ anymore. They work for jOE. If you go to the Curacoa Govt website look under casino regulatory agency or something to that effect. It tells you : we are not taking complaints at this time. lol. Im not kidding. I was going to tell you what happened to me at ignition but Im not gonna waste my time. They arent licensed either. However, you may get lucky here and there and actually get paid but its at their decresion. They got me for $1000 win this past Friday, its pretty bad.</p>
<p>Im not sure if any of you are aware of a coin called bitcoin SV. I wasnt either, never heard of it. Apparently its a new tatic they are using not to pay winners. They will claim you requested a bitcoin SV withdraw and when they sent it to your bitcoin wallet ( hello) the wallet address I actually gave them, they tell you there was a mismatch. This is beyond anything Ive ever heard of. They cant show you the actual withdraw request, they just keep saying, I changed coins midway through my withdraw request. I guess BSV is the original bitcoin. Do your research. Youll be shocked. Such a load of crap. I have never even heard of Bitcoin SV, or BSV. Im 65 yrs old, tell me why me or anyone would change currency when your wirhdrawing your winnings or any time for that matter, NO ONE, THATS WHO. Oh i did the research, its crazy, way above my tech knowledge. Read the article you be able to understand whats really going on. it doesnt even make sense. Its just yet another way of not paying players their wins.</p>
<p>Im sure Guru isnt going to be pleased with what Ive said however. Its the truth. Remember there are only 8 states that allow you to gamble online. Im not talking about betting on horses, football etc. I know its double standard but those types of wagers are controlled by that state. Why are these corrupt casinos allowed to advertise in my state, let alone all the other ones. It makes no sense.</p>
<p>You have no recourse of getting any of your winnings. There you have it. Just wondering why this is happening. The Guru isnt the only site that recommends these casinos, either. There are so many sites that say Ignition, the #1 online casino in AZ Thats a bold face lie. Im born and raised in AZ. Wth is going on. The world as we knew it is gone. Thats what.</p>
<p>Take care.......</p>
