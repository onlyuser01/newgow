    <h1>Hard Rock Fort Lauderdale Casino Horseshoe Casino Buffet Wynn Casinos Casino Jackpot Slot Machine Be</h1>

<p>In the UK I signed up to GamStop being a problem gambler. Shortly after I relapsed when I found MyStake who would allow me to deposit and play.</p>
<p>From late September I started playing very frequently, depositing a lot of money in short time frames (minutes,hours).</p>
<p>I was never prompted by the casino or had any support "pop ups" to check in. They say the have specialist support that can identify problem gambling. But they didn't ever reach out to me and allows me to keep depositing ridiculous amounts and amount of times.</p>
<p>This month I reached out to support and asked them to put a time out/cooling off period on my account for 1 month. They then said this was granted and they I would not be able to access for a month. They lied to me and they didn't put this protection onto my account.</p>
<p>Which then allowed me to make several more deposits and lose even more money.</p>
<p>I then emailed costumer services and asked why they did not apply this block to my account as agreed. I told them I have a gambling addiction and needed it blocked. Furthermore they replied with no remorse as to why I was lied to. Instead saying they have closed my account and I would not be able to access it anymore.</p>
<p>THEY LIED AGAIN!</p>
<p>I could still deposit and play!</p>
<p>I have reached out to the support again, with no reply. I feel I am being taken advantage of, even after telling them I am a problem gambler and that I needed the block on my account. I am at my most vulnerable and there's nothing I can do even after seeking help from the online casino. It's very unfair that they can treat customers like this and lie to them.</p>
