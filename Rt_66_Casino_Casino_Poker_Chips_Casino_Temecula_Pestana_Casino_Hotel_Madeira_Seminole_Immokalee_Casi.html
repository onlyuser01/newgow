<p>The provider of games and solutions powering the iGaming sector confirmed it has gone live with games for SBbet</p>
<p>The leading online casino solutions and content provider, 7777 gaming, continues to expand its global footprint after going live with another operator. The company confirmed it has gone live with the leading betting and gaming operator in Montenegro, SBbet. Currently, SBbet is among the top 3 gaming operators in the country and has been operating for nearly three decades since its initial launch dating back to 1997.</p>
<p>The company has a strong presence within the land-based gambling vertical, with betting shops all around Montenegro. Additionally, SBbet has a strong online gambling presence, delivering thrilling virtual sports, live casino, casino and sports games.</p>
<p>7777 gaming had previously secured certification from the Bulgarian Institute of Metrology (BIM) for more than 100 of its thrilling games. This means that those games are now ready to be deployed for the regulated online gambling market in Montenegro. Going live with SBbet enables the leading provider of games to reach new players, delivering its engaging and unique portfolio of games.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, at ICE London, one of the most important events for the gambling sector, SBbet won promotion from 7777 gaming’s HIT THE DEAL Bonus Wheel. That incentive ultimately helped ignite the collaboration between the duo.</p>
<p>7777 gaming’s titles going live with SBbet will bring unique games to the operator’s growing customer base. As a result, players will be able to enjoy popular hit titles such as Cash 100, Fortunes of Rome, Jinn, Greenhat’s Jackpot, as well as Sea of Treasures. What’s more, SBbet’s customers will be able to access the iGaming developer’s innovative releases, Zeus Quest and Club Mr Luck, among other thrilling games.</p>
<p>Recently, 7777 gaming teamed up with Kaizen Gaming, introducing games for its Betano Bulgaria brand.</p>

<p>Marko Boskovic, SBbet’s head of online gaming, explained that as one of the leading operators within the regulated gambling market in Montenegro, the company focuses on delivering unique experiences for its growing customer base. He added: “We found in 7777 gaming a trusted partner with a bright vision for what the new generation of casino players needs and requires – a fun, entertaining, and unique experience.” Finally, Boskovic predicted that the collaboration will bring success for the two companies.</p>
<p>“We’re looking forward to working together, and with the support of their community, we believe this partnership will be very successful.“ Asya Raykova, account manager at 7777 gaming</p>
<p>Asya Raykova, 7777 gaming’s account manager, shared the excitement of SBbet’s head of online gaming. She recognized the leadership position the betting and gaming company holds in the country.
