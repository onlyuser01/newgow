<p>AffPapa has revealed a new partnership with Crashino, a cryptocurrency-based online casino brand and operator. The website offers more than 2,000 games provided by some of the leading industry suppliers and developers, and it supports a number of cryptocurrency tokens that can be used to bet with, deposit, and withdraw from the casino.</p>
<p>Crashino prioritizes an authentic cryptocurrency gambling experience which it hopes stands out from the competition, the companies shared in a press release. Part of Crashino’s offer includes the right to anonymous registrations, which it argues offers an elevated level of player protection. Crashino uses responsible gambling tools such as time-out and cool-down periods designed to help players keep their gambling under control.</p>
<p>Thanks to its tie-up with AffPapa, Crashino will now have the opportunity to collaborate with no fewer than 1,400 affiliates, which will help the brand to further strengthen its reach and strike home with bigger audiences with the help of professional marketing experts.</p>
<p>"We are excited to partner with AffPapa. We are certain that together we will be able to rapidly expand our network of affiliates in no time," a Crashino spokesperson said in a statement. The news was similarly welcomed by AffPapa Head of Commercials, Yeva Avagyan, who hailed the addition of Crashino to the company’s expanding network of partners.</p>
<p>She said that partnerships such as these allowed AffPapa to further solidify its position as the industry’s leading place where operators and affiliates can meet and embark on various projects together. Moving forward, crypto-focused affiliates that are part of AffPapa’s network will be able to offer their services to Crashino.</p>
<p>AffPapa has been in the news a lot lately. The company signed two major partnerships with media companies, to wit iGaming Next and SBC with the companies now going to share their expertise and work on a range of events and activities together.</p>
<p>Not least, AffPapa has deemed its latest edition of iGaming Club a success, getting more than 500 registrations, and planning to continue helping affiliates and gambling businesses establish meaningful connections within the gambling ecosystem.</p>
