    <h1>Prima Play Casino Pennsylvania Casinos Hollywood Casino Amphitheatre Photos Casino Danville Va Diamo</h1>

<p>Before i file a chargeback, i will explain the scenario carefully. The casino has denied request for a refund so I am making a complaint.</p>
<p>July 2021 I created an account under eweb****@gmail.com. No transactions in this account. Email not verified.</p>
<p>January 22 I received a bank notification for exposure to 3 fraudulent transactions. I have not received any SMS codes and i have proof of this.</p>
<p>My previous company notified me that they keep receiving emails from sol.casino and asked if i am familiar with it. (The company email account I used to have access to) so they informed sol casino to block the account because no body registered there. I presumed it was hacked or unintentionally was used in some way.</p>
<p>I reported the incident to my lawyer and my bank who immediately blocked my card.</p>
<p>I told sol casino the other email was a duplicate and i had unauthorized transactions. They wont refund but their terms say (unspecified authorized or unauthorized) transactions from a duplicate account are NULL AND VOID.</p>
<p>No verification. No ID. No email confirmation. Bank confirmed no SMs codes. Yet they will not refund so I told my bank and waiting. Now theyre seeking compensation when the money wasnt returned to me yet based on their terms that i made a protest?! How ridiculous!</p>
