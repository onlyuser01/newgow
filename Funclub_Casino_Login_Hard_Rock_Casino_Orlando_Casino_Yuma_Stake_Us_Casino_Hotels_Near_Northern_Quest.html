<p>IGaming operator NetBet has reinforced its offerings with the addition of games developed by Ortiz Gaming. The bingo slots specialist agreed to provide NetBet with some of its best titles, which are now available on the operator’s platform.</p>
<p>NetBet Adds Ortiz Titles to Portfolio</p>
<p>As per the agreement, Ortiz Gaming powered NetBet’s offerings with hit titles, such as Ace Bonus, Ace Mania and Triple Bonus. These games are now available on NetBet’s website. The deal will help the operator diversify its strong portfolio as it continues to expand internationally. In addition, it will help Ortiz Gaming’s titles reach more players.</p>
<p>Ortiz is a renowned supplier with over 20 years of experience. The studio powers many notable operators and aggregators with its critically-acclaimed games. In early 2022, for example, the studio teamed up with the leading aggregator SkillOnNet in a historic LATAM-centered partnership.</p>
<p>Claudia Georgevici, PR manager at NetBet, spoke about the agreement. She lauded Ortiz Gaming as a developer of great iGaming titles and said that her team is thrilled to add them to NetBet’s online offer. Georgevici said that she is certain NetBet’s players are going to enjoy the new titles. The PR manager added that the NetBet team is looking forward to hearing its players’ feedback.</p>
<p>Georgevici finally concluded that NetBet will follow Ortiz Gaming’s titles with interest as her company believes there is a bright future ahead of the supplier.</p>
<p>NetBet Continues to Strengthen Its Position with Key Deals</p>
<p>NetBet was founded in 2001 and has since grown to be one of the leading iGaming operators. However, the company realizes that staying at the top requires constant innovation. Because of that, NetBet’s team is always seeking to generate more value for its players by inking agreements with top online casino suppliers, aggregators and tech companies.</p>
<p>For example, in July, NetBet joined forces with Evolution, a flagship brand in the live casino sector. The latter agreed to provide NetBet with several of its top titles, helping the operator engage its customers in Italy.</p>
<p>NetBet recently teamed up with FeedConstruct, a leading provider of sports data and innovative data solutions. The agreement saw NetBet join FeedConstruct’s family of partners, which includes many notable operators. Thanks to this partnership, NetBet was able to power its offerings with the key BetGuard solution that maximizes profits and minimizes risk. BetGuard is a multi-faceted tool that will help NetBet manage its trading operations. It will also help to identify suspicious gaming behavior that might be related to problem gambling or money laundering.</p>
