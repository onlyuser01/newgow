<p>On Air Entertainment is making another stride in the iGaming market in the United Kingdom. The supplier has teamed up with two premier online casino properties, further expanding its footprint in the regulated market. Now, On Air Entertainment’s products will be available at both Betway and 32Red.</p>
<p>On Air Entertainment Taking the UK by Storm</p>
<p>Specifically, the brands will have access to On Air’s blackjack products, which have won a name for themselves, making it one of the best possible additions both companies can enjoy in the live segment. Betway and On Air have previously worked together on the delivery of live casino products in other markets. Commenting on the recent partnership expansion, Betway CEO Anthony Werkman said:</p>
<p>“On Air has been a fantastic provider of live casino in our other market, so it’s great that we’re able to extend that offering to UK customers through our latest agreement with them.” Betway CEO Anthony Werkman</p>
<p>This tie-up will only continue to elevate the live casino content offer, Werkman confirmed. On Air Entertainment has been able to develop dedicated experiences across its different live casino tables. 32Red commercial operations manager Adam Newnham welcomed the addition of On Air Entertainment products:</p>
<p>“We are delighted to be able to offer our players the refreshingly new live casino product from On Air Entertainment via the Microgaming platform.” 32Red commercial operations manager Adam Newnham</p>
<p>Through On Air, 32Red can deliver established products by a highly-acclaimed portfolio of games. This partnership should stretch further down the road as 32Red is committed to further developing its portfolio with the supplier.</p>
<p>Betway and 32Red will similarly benefit from other dedicated experiences part of the On Air Entertainment product portfolio. This includes a highly-anticipated roulette release that should be coming on February 24. Both companies will be able to add it to their own libraries and benefit from future releases.</p>
<p>Building up Momentum in New Market</p>
<p>On Air has only recently entered the regulated UK market – on January 25. The company has been developing live products since 2020 and has a focus on “competitive, customer-centric entertainment experiences.”</p>
<p>Prior to debuting its product in the United Kingdom, On Air Entertainment teamed up with Microgaming to power a new live gaming product. This alliance marked Microgaming’s renewed efforts to break into the live gaming market after a hiatus.</p>
<p>Evolution, in the meantime, has acquired Ezugi and NetEnt, a direct competitor to Microgaming’s slot and table games offer for traditional casinos.</p>
