<p>Ahead of the Super Bowl, Rep. Paul D. Tonko has brought forward the Betting on our Future Act, legislation that aims to ban all online and electronic advertising of sports gambling.</p>
<p>Sports Betting Ads Put Young Adults at Risk</p>
<p>The Betting on our Future Act is modeled after the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act, which banned tobacco advertisements. The new legislation aims to tackle harmful online sports betting advertisements by prohibiting the advertising of sportsbooks on any medium of electronic communication under the jurisdiction of the Federal Communications Commission.</p>
<p>The bill is a federal legislation, which makes it different from the ongoing efforts to restrict sportsbook advertising at the state level such as those proposed in Massachusetts, for example. If enacted, Tonko’s bill will have a significant impact on the entire online gaming industry in the US.</p>
<p>According to congressman Tonko, during the Super Bowl, many families will be exposed to a barrage of advertisements from DraftKings, FanDuel, and other companies promoting “risk-free” or “no sweat” bets. These advertisements pose a significant threat, especially to young adults who are not aware of the risks involved in gambling and vulnerable individuals prone to addiction.</p>
<p>Tonko expressed that the promotion of these sites has become excessive and needs to be regulated, which is what the Betting on our Future Act aims to do. According to Tonko’s statement, Congress must take action to control an industry that has the power to harm the American people.</p>
<p>In his press release, Tonko also quoted data showing how much the sports betting industry has grown in just a few years. Following the Supreme Court’s decision to strike down the federal ban on sports betting in 2018, at least 36 states have legalized sports gambling in some form, with 26 states legalizing mobile sports betting. According to the American Gaming Association, Americans wagered $73 billion on sports in the first ten months of 2022, which is a 70% increase from the previous year.</p>
<p>Psychologist Reveals Why Sports Betting Apps Are Addictive</p>
<p>In this context, a recent analysis by psychologist Meredith Ginley on why sports betting apps are addictive showed the magnitude of the problem. Ginley explains that the addictiveness of these apps lies in several distinguishing characteristics such as the ease of access to a casino in one’s pocket, the satisfaction of betting on a favorite team and potentially winning, and the gamified design of the apps.</p>
<p>Ginley also notes that problem gambling is similar to other addictions and that the brain activity of frequent gamblers is close to the reaction to cues such as alcohol, cigarettes, or cocaine. To combat problem gambling, various tools are available, such as awareness campaigns, limiting exposure, and imposing limits on deposits, spending, and losses. However, social stigma and other factors can make it difficult for users to seek help.</p>
