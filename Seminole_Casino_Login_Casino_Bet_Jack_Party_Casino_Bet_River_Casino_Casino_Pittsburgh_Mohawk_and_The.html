<p>The Stars Group strikes partnership with Mohawk in NY</p>
<p>The companies will explore online betting opportunities</p>
<p>Betting facilities to be all ready up by NFL season</p>
<p>Through its joint-venture with Fox, The Stars Group is now entering New York sports betting in partnership with Akwesasne Mohawk Casino Resort.</p>
<p>Akwesasne Secures TSG Partnership for NY Retail Sportsbook</p>
<p>The Stars Group has struck a landmark partnership with Akwesasne Mohawk Casino Resort in New York, allowing the Canada-based gaming company to enter the sports betting vertical in the state. By extension, TSG will be able to expand into any new iGaming market the state rolls out in future.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the current partnership, TSG will be able to launch its full offer, including online sports betting, poker and casino, with New York potentially becoming the fifth state to allow online poker.</p>
<p>While some legislation measures remain to be negotiated to establish some of the verticals, TSG will also provide technical support for the retail sportsbook that will be located at the Akwesasne Mohawk Casino Resort in Northern New York.</p>

<p>Mohawk will be entitled to a share of online revenue operations whereas the Canadian iGaming giant will claim revenue claimed through the retail sportsbook.</p>
<p>The TSG, Fox Partnership to Pay Off</p>
<p>Following a recent pivotal patnership between The Stars Group and Fox Sports, the company is now making its first serious move onto the U.S. market since. Accoding the new company’s CEO, Robin Chhabra, this new entity is set to completely shake up things in the market. Here is what Chhabra had to say:</p>
<p>“We are excited to announce this agreement with Mohawk, which further strengthens our market access as we work to build our FOX Bet business into one of the leaders in the emerging U.S. online betting and gaming market.”</p>
<p>The news was also well-met by Akwesasne Mohawk Casino Resort general manager Todd Papineau who said that the 5,200-sq ft sports betting hub the company owned would be ready in time for the NFL season in the fall.</p>
<p>Mr. Papineau reminded that the company would have to wait for the official go-ahead from lawmakers first: “Once permissible in the state, we will be prepared to accept sports wagers through our new kiosks.”</p>
<p>He went on to explain that FOX Bet and TSG-owned PokerStars were poised to become the de facto leaders on the iGaming and betting landscape in the country.</p>
<p>“We are delighted to work with The Stars Group, one of the world’s largest, most licensed online gaming companies, to leverage the opportunity presented by online betting and gaming in the State of New York,” Mr. Papineau added.</p>
<p>TSG and Mohawk are preparing for an early launch of the industry in the fall this year. Measures to allow sports betting in the state were passed in June, 2019, allowing land-based retail sportsbooks to operate at specific locations.</p>
<p>However, legislators couldn’t agree on voting on mobile and online betting and as a result the measure has been deferred for 2020 when New York residents would possibly be allowed to start wagering from home.</p>
