<p>NOVOMATIC’s iGaming division, Greentube, has made further strides into North America, launching its games with Betway in Ontario. The deal expands the long-term partnership between the two companies while reinforcing the provider’s presence in the Canadian province.</p>
<p>Under the new agreement, Betway’s customers in Ontario will be able to enjoy some of the supplier’s best games. This notably includes fan-favorite classics like Book of Ra Deluxe, Sizzling Hot Deluxe and Lord of the Ocean, among others.</p>
<p>In addition to that, many of Greentube’s innovative video slots will also make their way into the operator’s Ontarian portfolio. As a result, fans will also get to play exciting action-packed hits such as Egyptian Underworld, Apollo God of the Sun 10 Win Ways and Book of Ra 10 Win Ways, among others. All of these games sport many of the features and mechanics that make Greentube’s content truly unique.</p>
<p>The new content integration was enacted through the iForium aggregation platform, allowing Betway to access these new games and further tap into the potential of the Canadian province.</p>
<p>Ontario has remained a market of key importance to gambling operators and providers ever since the launch of iGaming. Greentube secured its license in 2022 and has been seeking expansion opportunities ever since. The company’s gaming content is also available in Columbia, Manitoba and Quebec.</p>
<p>Greentube has been going from strength to strength, expanding its presence on multiple fronts, including North America, Latin America and Europe.</p>
<p>Betway Is Glad to Expand Its Partnership with Greentube</p>
<p>Representatives commented on the partnership. Betway’s head of marketing in Ontario, Joachim Bjerg, said that his team is glad to deepen its relationship with Greentube and partner up in Ontario. Bjerg added that his company’s customers in the province are sure to like the new additions to Betway’s Ontarian portfolio.</p>
<p>Our market data shows that our customers really enjoy playing fun and innovative casino games, so adding premium content like Greentube’s will continue to help Betway thrive in the province. Joachim Bjerg, head of marketing for Ontario, Betway</p>
<p>Greentube’s sales &amp; key account manager, Jordan Wall, also commented on the matter, saying that his team is looking forward to growing alongside Betway in North America.</p>
<p>Jordan Wall, Sales &amp; Key Account Manager at Greentube, said: “Greentube has a fantastic long-standing partnership with Betway and together we have achieved fantastic things in established and emerging markets worldwide. Jordan Wall, sales &amp; key account manager, Greentube</p>
