<p>Dear Jason D***,</p>
<p>Trust this email finds you well.</p>
<p>Kindly note that from the Bank Statement you sent us, we have realized that the account is a joint account with Desjardins Ontario. Kindly note that this is not something allowed within our company and business and therefore, would need to inform you that your account is currently limited until all documents are received. This would have been listed within our T&amp;C's. Therefore, we would need to ask for further documentation.</p>
<p>We would still require</p>
<p>Interac Bank Account; we need to see proof of all deposits made to our casino. Kindly note that the screenshots and bank statements you have provided us do not show our casino name next to any of the transactions, and therefore, cannot accept this. Kindly make sure that the Bank Statement shows your name, surname, bank company logo, account number and all transactions showing. Ideally, to get all this information, you would need to download the bank statement as PDF from the respective banking website.</p>
<p>PDF Bank Statement showing proof of deposits made from Credit Card ending **3560. This is needed due to the card not having your name and surname on it. You have made two successful deposits to our casinos and these would be as follows;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>27/12/2021 at 07:25:52; Deposit of 10.00 CAD</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>27/12/2021 at 09:45:49; Deposit of 14.00 CAD</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For the 3rd Party Payment method ( Bank Account that is joint with Desjardins Ontario ) we would need to ask for the following further documentation;</p>
<p>Declaration Form; Attached to the email, you will find a 3rd Party Declaration form which you would need to fill out accordingly, and provide us with a fully completed document. If you prefer to write the document, rather than print and fill it out, you can choose to do so, however, make sure that you write all the words exactly as they are shown on the declaration from we provide. All the information needs to be written down, from top to bottom of the page; including the three bullet points at the bottom of the page.</p>
<p>Kindly note that we cannot accept a digital or scanned copy of the form. It needs to be either a picture or a written paper.</p>
<p>Attached, kindly find the declaration form which you would need to fill out accordingly. Kindly note that where 'Identification Documentation Number' is requested, you need to fill out the ID Numbers of both yours and the 3rd Party as well as writing the respective name next to each ID Number.</p>
<p>Photo ID of the 3rd Party; Desjardins Ontario ; can be passport, driving license or National ID.</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>

<p>GAMBLING CAN BE ADDICTIVE. PLAY RESPONSIBLY</p>
<p>I have never seen any casino names beside any deposits and I have made several deposits to many casinos and I don't see any casino names so its impossible for me to prove that and I have used the same account at different casinos and still got paid out. This is the first time that joint accounts aren't accepted it's my only bank account and as for card 3560 it was a present a non reloadable gift card so the bank statement won't be good enough for these guys I guess I'm never getting anything told ya they were thiefs any documents that I give will never be good enough I give up they can keep there money I guess</p>
<p>I don't know if you ever did e transfer deposits but it never says casino name just the reference # like when I e transfer money from my brother in law it never says his name. This is never going to be resolved but you should let other people know cause how many people Deposit with joint accounts or gift cards they should know not to play here so far the best casino that I've had no problems with payouts is woo casino. But please let others know before they go through the same nightmare that I'm going through I know it's too late for me but if we can prevent even one person from getting screwed I feel like I may have accomplished something.</p>
