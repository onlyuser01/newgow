    <h1>Posh Casino Crypto Casino Aquarius Hotel Casino Boomtown Casino Bossier Louisiana Casino Near Nashvi</h1>

<p>Hi.. I've been playing on luckynuggetcasino since 2020 I believe.. my address was [edited by Casino Guru] back then.. but long story short I ended up stopping playing for around 3 years.. but started again a few months ago.. I've spent well over 1000$ on there with no withdrawals or not really any wins honestly..</p>
<p>I won 200$ last week and got the money in my account a few days after my bank account I mean.. so I ended up playing again and won almost 5000$ but I played it down to 3500 and made the withdrawal.. so it goes into processing and I can't reverse it.. and then a couple days pass.. (the weekend) and I got on the support chat to get an update.. the lady on there told me the withdrawal has been put on hold and my personal documents need to be updated.. so I did what they required and was told now It's a waiting game.. they say possibly up to 7 business days.. so I was kind of frustrated but said okay I guess that's all I can do..</p>
<p>Now let me explain since I started playing again I've asked for my address to be updated to my current one and they said okay every time i asked .. but it never got done..</p>
<p>So back to being told I have to wait for it to be looked at and wait for an email.. I go to bed.. get up and go to work for the day.. when I got home I went to sign onto lucky nugget.. and it tells me my info is incorrect ... which doesn't make sense cause I have my passwords and stuff saved on my phone.. so I request a password reset which i tried at least 6 times.. but it don't send to my email.. so I open the live chat support and literally have to retry at least 5 times before I get through.. for them to tell me my account has been locked temporarily because of what they say were some "concerning statements".... I can't even begin to think what they're referring to? I'm always polite and respectful to the agents on live chat.. so I'm confused about what that means.. the agent then tells me my withdrawal will process like normal in 3 days and my accounts documents will be reviewed in up to 7 business days... so now I'm getting stressed out.. and I ask am I going to receive the money I won legally and by the rules.. I can't help but feel I'm being ripped off or scammed. Then the agent says he can't tell me when the money will process or if ill get it.. that my account is under review.. so more less a contradiction of his earlier statement.. and I'm being left in the dark..</p>
<p>Last night I read an article on here of a guy who's account was closed and suspended without receiving his winnings.. and literally everything he says they said to him is pretty much what they're saying to me?.. I'm super stressed out about this cause I was really depending on that money.. I could use a bit of help figuring everything out.. and being privy to what the alleged issue is.. ðŸ˜Ÿ</p>
