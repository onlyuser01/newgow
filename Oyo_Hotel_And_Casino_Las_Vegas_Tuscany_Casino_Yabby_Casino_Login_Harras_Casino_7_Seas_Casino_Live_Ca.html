<p>Live! Casino Pittsburgh is celebrating its first year as the anchor at the Westmoreland Mall in the Pennsylvania city. To mark the occasion, the casino is getting a few upgrades, including a poker room and more gaming options.</p>
<p>Live! Casino Pittsburgh Expands Gaming</p>
<p>Officials revealed several new attractions Tuesday, including a poker table, event center and electronic gaming tables (EGT). They also created a reconfigured high-limit room and a FanDuel FanCave. These new options will be added to the 30 table and 750 slot machine games and the restaurant and entertainment facilities at the 100,000-square-foot property.</p>
<p>Sean Sullivan, the property’s GM, stated when announcing the upgrades, “A year after we opened, we didn’t rest on our laurels. We went and expanded everything. The point is we listen to people. The point is we constantly want to improve things. If you don’t, you become stale, you become criticized.”</p>
<p>The 1,500-square-foot poker room, located on the second floor of the venue, has seven table games. It will open Monday after approval from the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board (PGCB). The space, which is located adjacent to Sports &amp; Social Steel City, was originally designed as a banquet room that could be used for private events or meetings.</p>
<p>The new poker room will create approximately 25 new jobs. The casino held a free school for poker dealers in preparation for its opening. 24 people graduated last week.</p>
<p>Also on the second floor is the FanDuel FanCave. The space measures 826 square feet and includes 13 leather recliners as well as a 173-inch television. The casino’s sportsbook, however, is still located on the first floor.</p>
<p>Sullivan explained that the viewing experience was created on the second floor so that people can walk from the Skee-Ball to FanCave or the bowling and still be with their friends and families.</p>
<p>New Event Center Adds a Special Touch</p>
<p>The new event center, measuring 7,000 square feet, is located just down the hall from poker room. This space can be used to host weddings, private parties, and other special events. This space will be upgraded following New Year’s. It was previously used for storage and a dining room for staff. It is scheduled to open in 2022.</p>
<p>The center can currently hold 650 people. When the renovations are complete, it will hold 850 people.</p>
<p>20 new electronic gambling tables will be installed on the casino floor’s first floor. They are currently awaiting approval from the gaming board. The EGTs feature blackjack and roulette, which will be dealt by a live dealer.</p>
<p>There will be 14 EGTs outside the main casino bar, as well as six inside. Other modifications to the casino floor include reconfiguration of high-limit rooms to add 18 more slots machines.</p>
<p>The PGCB still has to vote on whether Live! can offer the poker room and new EGTs. That vote could happen at a commission meeting scheduled for today.</p>
