    <h1>Casino North Carolina Live Casino Philippines Bitcoin Live Casino Turtle Creek Casino Casino Dallas</h1>

<p>I am here to alert people, please do not fall for this scam site. I have deposited 2k into it and now I am not able to get it back. They are clever that I tried to deposit 300 at first and then try to withdraw a 50 out. Yh, it turned out to be a success and I received my 50. That's why then I decided to put in more the rest of my money.</p>
<p>After that, I saw many bad reviews on the web and tried to contact the support team through live chat and email. Email responses were quick on the first day. Thru live chat, I find out that the support who contacted me was named Davi. I managed to find him out on TELEGRAM GROUP through the "Official TG" which is now changed its name and lots of victims are inside it. He blocked me instantly when I tryna talk to him. And Yh, the next day which is now, I got banned officially on their platform with 4k balance on it. (2k winnings)</p>
<p>There is one more thing is that I was telling the honest opinions on this scam site on their official FB page, and yeahh, I was blocked and my comment was deleted. Now I am not able to reply or comment on their post anymore.</p>
<p>I know it's impossible to get my money back, what I am expecting here is stopping people from falling for this scam site. PLEASE DO NOT PLAY ON IT. The whole RGT based casinos are all scams. Please note that.</p>
<p>It's worse that they have requested for KYC process, which I am not sure what they would use it for which purposes and I can't believe how many people have fallen for it. It's disgusting.</p>
