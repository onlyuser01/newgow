<p>The latest leadership-affirmation move to do with this specific vertical comes through a new tie-up with BetMGM.co.uk and LeoVegas.com, both of which have now received access to Pragmatic Play’s premium Live Casino games, the company confirmed in a press release.</p>
<p>BetMGM, which launched in the United Kingdom only recently, is set to benefit from distinct games, such as Auto Mega Roulette. Both LeoVegas and BetMGM have launched branded versions of Pragmatic Play’s Live Casino games, adding even more variety and differentiation to their respective offers, and offering players great new chances to win.</p>
<p>Auto Mega Roulette can pay multipliers up to 500x adding a level of excitement that is not available in more orthodox versions of the game.</p>
<p>Commenting on this fresh opportunity for the company, Irina Cornides, Pragmatic Play’s COO, welcomed the chance to see this partnership carry on. Pragmatic Play has been a well-established powerhouse in the Live Casino vertical, Cornides noted, and the company now had the opportunity to reinforce its presence.</p>
<p>"Our extensive suite of customization options adds another dimension for our customers, who can quickly and easily stand out with uniquely tailored and branded content," Cornides noted.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Pragmatic Play has been making sure that it loses none of its international momentum, with the company expanding its product offering to new jurisdictions. First, the company expanded its reach in Slovakia through a partnership with Niké.</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play also continued to grow its efforts in Latin America, where the supplier has recently teamed up and expanded with Betmais, as the Brazilian iGaming market is about to undergo serious regulation.</p>
<p>The supplier has also introduced several exciting slots over the past several months, including Timber Stacks and Viking Forge, both well-polished, gamification-focused, and exciting titles.</p>
<p>BetMGM launched its UK casino back in August, and it has been building quickly in the local market. The latest introduction of branded Live Casino games is another step in this direction, with the company hoping to firmly establish its offer and ensure that it’s a meaningful provider of gaming experiences for local audiences.</p>
