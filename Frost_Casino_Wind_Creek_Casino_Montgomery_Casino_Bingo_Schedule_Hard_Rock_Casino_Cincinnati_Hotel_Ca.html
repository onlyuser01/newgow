<p>The iGaming content supplier continues to grow its footprint by agreeing to supply its games to another leading online gambling operator in Switzerland</p>
<p>The fast-growing digital entertainment supplier, Playson, announced a new European-facing agreement.

At the same time, the new deal enables Pasino to deliver thrilling new games for its growing customer base.</p>
<p>Per the new agreement, Pasino’s customers will be able to access fan-favorite games from Playson, including Wolf Land, 3 Pots Riches and Crown and Diamonds, among others.
