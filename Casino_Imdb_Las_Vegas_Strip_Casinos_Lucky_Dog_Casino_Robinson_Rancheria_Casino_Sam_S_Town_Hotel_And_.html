<p>The San Francisco 49ers suffered a bad defeat last week, losing 44-23 to the Kansas City Chiefs. It was their second straight defeat, because of which, they’re now 3-4 in the 2022 NFL season. Unfortunately for them, it won’t be easy to get to .500 this weekend. Why? Because in Week 8, they’re playing against reigning champions, the Los Angeles Rams, at SoFi Stadium.</p>
<p>Not only are the Rams the 2022 Super Bowl-winning team, but they’re also very motivated to beat their NFC West rivals. They’re 3-3 right now, coming off a bye week, meaning that they’ve had plenty of time to prepare for the Week 8 clash.</p>
<p>Knowing all this, you’ll be surprised to learn that online sportsbooks see the Niners as the favorites in Sunday’s game. Are the bookies right to think so? That’s what we’ll examine in this 49ers vs Rams Week 8 preview.</p>

<p>San Francisco 49ers Have a Brand-New Weapon in Their Arsenal</p>
<p>Christian McCaffrey, who’s one of the best running backs in 2022 (if not the very best one!) is a new San Francisco player. He made his debut last weekend in the game with the Chiefs, rushing eight times for a total of 38 yards. He didn’t score any touchdowns, but overall, he passed his first exam. This goes especially knowing that he was playing against one of the NFL’s best rushing defenses.</p>
<p>The Chiefs are now ranked third in rushing TDs conceded per game and rushing yards allowed per game. The Los Angeles Rams, on the other hand, are sixth and tenth, respectively. That said, McCaffrey is supposed to have an easier job in Week 8.</p>
<p>Los Angeles Rams Have Had Enough Time to Prepare for Week 8</p>
<p>The Rams might not be as impressive as they were last season, but they still have plenty of talent on the roster. It’s only a matter of time before they start impressing again. Their offense really needs to step up ASAP.</p>
<p>With just 17.3 points per game, they are the fourth-worst offense in the league. The reason why this is so surprising is that the Rams have a fine quarterback in Matt Stafford, who has plenty of targets at his disposal, most notably, Cooper Kupp.</p>
<p>The explanation behind this is that in their six games of the 2022 season, the Rams faced some really tough defenses. In fact, two of their three losses in 2022 happened against the two top defenses in the NFL – the Buffalo Bills and the Dallas Cowboys.</p>
<p>Their third loss of the season happened to the Niners when we saw them fail to score a single TD. It’s got to be different this time, right?</p>
<p>San Francisco 49ers vs Los Angeles Rams Prediction</p>
<p>Now looks like an ideal time for the Rams to start playing better football. Their current record isn’t great, and their schedule is going to get very ugly in November. Winning on Sunday would not only bring them their fourth win of the season, but it would also do wonders for their confidence.</p>
<p>Picks: Los Angeles Rams to win; over to hit</p>
