<p>Relax Gaming has launched Snake’s Gold Dream Drop, an Aztec-themed slot with a max win of 5,000x, free spins, wilds, and five progressive jackpots</p>
<p>October has been a busy month for popular iGaming aggregator and casino games supplier Relax Gaming. At the start of the month, Relax Gaming announced it would add Skatelogic’s Super Wheel feature to its games, aiming to add new levels of thrill and extra chances to grab prizes.</p>
<p>The news came one week after the provider launched Titan Strike, an Ancient Greece-themed slot with a max win of 5,005x the bet.</p>
<p>Now, fans of the 2010-launched studio and slot aficionados alike can rejoice at the news of yet another exciting slot release. Snake’s Gold Dream Drop is Relax Gaming’s latest 5×4 game with an Aztec theme in place, a max win capped at 5,000x, wilds, free spins, and five different progressive jackpots.</p>
<p>The new game comes to complement the developer’s refined collection of Dream Drop jackpot slots.</p>

<p>Enter the Aztec Temple and Find the Horde of Stolen Treasures</p>
<p>As the game is initiated, players are sent straight deep into the lush jungle hiding an Aztec temple where stolen treasures are waiting to be revealed. The gaming grid is set at the core of this scenery, overlooked by the serpents carved in stone.</p>
<p>Players who land two special coins will set the snake’s eyes on fire while being granted a full Wild Reel. With a minimum of three bonus reels, more fuel is added to the fire, letting players unlock a Free Spins bonus as well as the fixed Wild Reels as soon as the two coins are collected.</p>
<p>Any random spin can trigger jackpot spins. During these spins, only Dream Drop symbols and blanks are seen landing on the grid. Coming across five Dream Drop symbols DD at a time will engage the Dream Drop Bonus.</p>
<p>At the end of each new spin, the block symbols are swept off the grid and the Dream Drop symbols are dropped to the bottom, staying in play. The spins will go on until the Dream Drop symbols completely fill up one of the reels. In turn, this will reward players with one of the five available jackpot prizes: Mega, Major, Maxi, Midi, and Rapid.</p>
<p>As explained by Relax Gaming’s chief product officer, Shelley Hannah, similar to their other Dream Drop titles, the new release is expected to be “yet another fantastic addition” to their rich portfolio consisting of over 4,000 casino games.</p>
<p>Dream Drop Jackpots is a one-of-a-kind jackpot product originally released in May 2022 in conjunction with a sequel to one of the studio’s flagship slots, Temple Tumble 2. The five linked progressive global jackpots are won prior to players reaching a guaranteed level.</p>
<p>This means players are given a guaranteed jackpot win whenever they enter the Dream Drop jackpot feature in a game. In less than a year after its launch, the feature turned seven players into millionaires.</p>
