<p>Supplier of technology and services for the gaming industry International Game Technology (IGT) made an announcement today about a recent expansion of the company’s presence in Virginia.</p>
<p>HRMs Rollout at Peninsula Pacific Gaming Venues</p>
<p>IGT entered into a distribution agreement with Exacta Systems for the deployment of IGT’s first historical racing machine (HRM) across Virginia via gaming venues owned by Peninsula Pacific Entertainment.</p>
<p>“IGT’s distribution agreement with Exacta Systems enables us to pursue exciting new growth opportunities like those offered in Virginia’s expanding historical horse racing market.” Nick Khin, COO, Gaming, IGT</p>
<p>According to the terms of the agreement, IGT rolled out across the state HRMs featuring some of the company’s customer favorite video slot themes including Fortune Coin®, Solar Disc™ and Red Hot Tamales!®, operating on IGT’s CrystalCurve® and CrystalDual® 27 cabinets.</p>
<p>“As the historical horse racing segment continues to grow across the U.S., Exacta Systems is thrilled to partner with leading content provider IGT to ensure that players have access to the highest caliber game content and cabinets in the market.” Jeremy Stein, CEO, Exacta Systems</p>
<p>New Experience and Growth Potential</p>
<p>The addition of the HRMs in Virginia brought a new “compelling casino-style entertainment”, Jeremy Stein continued, outlining the growth opportunity for the business inherent with this new and exciting player experience.</p>
<p>Aaron Gomes, chief operating officer at Peninsula Pacific Entertainment underscored IGT’s exceptional gaming content and hardware cabinets, and the deployment of IGT’s HRMs which offered a great opportunity for the gaming operator to boost the quality of entertainment for its players.</p>
<p>“As we look to drive growth and differentiate our offering, IGT’s video slot-style HRM games captured our players’ attention and brought some of the gaming industry’s most popular slot themes to our gaming floor.” Aaron Gomes, COO, Peninsula Pacific Entertainment</p>
<p>The deployment of IGT’s HRMs across Virginia made the state the second jurisdiction in which the gaming technology provider established a presence in the historical horse racing market. In June 2020, IGT entered into an agreement with Churchill Downs Incorporated (CDI) for the sale of 1,250 HRMs to enter the historical horse racing market in Kentucky.</p>
<p>“With IGT’s performance-tested content and proven hardware portfolio, we can offer a steady stream of new HHR experiences that engage players and elevate the profile and success of the entire HHR gaming segment.” Nick Khin, COO, Gaming, IGT</p>
<p>By the time of the agreement, CDI announced it would deploy IGT’s HRM featuring player-favorite themes on some of IGT’s highest performing hardware, across its Derby City Gaming in Louisville, Oak Grove Racing, Gaming &amp; Hotel in Oak Grove, Newport Racing &amp; Gaming in Newport, as well as any future facilities.</p>
<p>Kentucky is still in a state of limbo regarding the legal status of historical racing, with business owners hoping that state lawmakers would finally solve the conundrum and put the business on solid legal footing.</p>
