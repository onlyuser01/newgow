    <h1>Hotels Near Hollywood Casino Amphitheatre St Louis Casino Richmond Va Hustler Casino Live Online Cas</h1>

<p>Hello All,</p>
<p>We have investigated the player account and have found the below:</p>
<p>A Registration bonus was claimed on 2023-09-11to the value of 5 EUR</p>
<p>A Registration Bonus is added to player accounts upon verification of the email address.</p>
<p>This needs to be claimed by email, where the Terms and Conditions are listed.</p>
<p>After the Free Bonus was claimed, a confirmation email was sent to the player with the Terms and Conditions and Game Overview</p>
<p>https://www.boocasino.com/en/tnc/registration-complete-bonus</p>
<p>On 2023-09-11 a deposit of 8 EUR was made by the player as required to be eligible to submit a withdrawal request</p>
<p>In order to be eligible to submit a withdrawal request, the wager balance must be fully played and a deposit must be made to the account.</p>
<p>This is mentioned in the Registration bonus Terms and Conditions above:</p>
<p>You must complete the bonus wagering requirements before being able to request a withdrawal. The wagering requirement of this bonus is 60 times the bonus amount. (Please see "Non-Allowed Games" for list of non-allowed games).</p>
<p>The bonus is given for wagering purposes only, and will be removed from your account balance when you request a withdrawal.</p>
<p>A withdrawal request was submitted the same day for EUR 191.00</p>
<p>The withdrawal request was declined on 2023-09-12 for placing bets larger than 10% of the bonus amount.</p>
<p>Bets were placed to the value of 3.5 EUR, 2 EUR, 4 EUR, and 7.5 EUR</p>
<p>The Registration Bonus Terms and Conditions state the below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Betting more than €4.00 per spin or 10% of the received bonus amount (the smaller of the two) on a slot game</li>
</ol>
<p>As the bonus claimed was 5 EUR, the bet amount cannot be larger than 0.50 EUR (smaller than 4 EUR)</p>
<p>The Game History for the player has been sent to branislav.b@casino.guru as requested.</p>
<p>All players have access to their Game History in the Transaction History Section of their account.</p>
<p>For security reasons, the Game History can only be requested by the account owner by email.</p>
<p>This cannot be requested via Live Chat and cannot be sent by mail to a player’s residential address.</p>
<p>We have reviewed the Chat History of the player and have found the below:</p>
<p>The player was advised regarding Non Allowed games and the link was provided</p>
<p>The player closed the chat on the agent while checking the account regarding the same request in point 7</p>
<p>The player asked regarding point 7 and the agent advised wager balance must be completed to be eligible to submit a withdrawal request</p>
<p>The player closed the chat as the agent opened the chat</p>
<p>The player was advised the withdrawal request was under review and further updates would be provided via email from the Verifications Team</p>
<p>The player requested account information be sent to his residential address for his solicitor, the Support Agent advised this is not possible and to show the solicitor his account</p>
<p>The player asked regarding the deposit made and the Free Bonus claimed, claimed he made a mistake with the deposit, requested the wager be removed, and requested a refund when Support Agents advised the Wager cannot be removed and must be played.</p>
<p>We would like to refer to our Terms and Conditions regarding chat no 7 with our agent.</p>
<p>The player claimed he deposited with the bonus by accident and requested the wager balance to be removed.</p>
<p>As stated in the Registration Bonus Terms and Conditions:</p>
<p>If you received the bonus and prefer not to play with it, you may contact Customer Support to have the bonus removed. However, you must do this before placing a bet after the bonus was received. By placing a bet after receiving a bonus, you accept the bonus and any applicable conditions.</p>
<p>The Registration Bonus was claimed, and multiple rounds were played before a deposit was made.</p>
<p>The Registration Bonus was a Free Bonus claimed and not a Deposit Bonus</p>
<p>The Wager balance from the free bonus needed to be completed.</p>
<p>If the wager was removed, the winnings would have been removed as well, as the winnings were made from the Free Bonus money claimed.</p>
<p>Therefore our agents were advising the player correctly according to the Terms and Conditions of the Free Bonus claimed and active on the player’s account.</p>
<p>Please let us know if anything further is needed.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Boo Casino Representative</p>
