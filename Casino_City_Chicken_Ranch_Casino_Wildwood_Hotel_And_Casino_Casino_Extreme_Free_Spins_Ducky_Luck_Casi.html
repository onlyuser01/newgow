<p>Allwyn will celebrate the beginning of the changes with a new nationwide campaign beginning today</p>
<p>Lottery giant Allwyn has made history, becoming the first company other than Camelot to operate the United Kingdom’s National Lottery. The Czech company promised to celebrate this by providing more money to good causes than ever.</p>
<p>Allwyn was selected as The National Lottery’s successor a while ago, much to Camelot’s initial dismay. Camelot and IGT tried to overturn the UK Gambling Commission’s decision, alleging that the regulator might have been biased.</p>
<p>Despite the challenges, Allwyn remained firm. Eventually, Allwyn and Camelot buried the hatchet as the latter company was acquired by its former competitor. This also put Allwyn in indirect charge of The National Lottery much earlier.</p>
<p>On February 1, 2024, Allwyn officially took over The National Lottery, opening a new chapter for the beloved lottery. Justin King, Allwyn UK’s chair, promised that, over the next decade, Allwyn will work hard to increase returns to National Lottery-funded projects.</p>
<p>Allwyn will celebrate the beginning of these changes with a new nationwide campaign beginning today.</p>
<p>The Operator Wants to Benefit Future Generations</p>
<p>Allwyn UK’s chief executive, Andria Vidler, recently commented on the matter, saying that her ambition is to make sure that The National Lottery does more to benefit future generations. She admitted that this journey may take some time but added that there will be many incredible milestones along the way.</p>
<p>Vidler added that 2024 is set to be a very important year because of the Olympic and Paralympic Games and the fact that the lottery will celebrate its 30th birthday.</p>
<p>We want the birthday year, and the decade that follows, to be full of more unmissable and unforgettable moments for more people in more ways. Andria Vidler, CEO, Allwyn UK</p>
<p>Gambling Minister Stuart Andrew congratulated Allwyn on its new license and praised its ambition to generate funding for additional important initiatives. He pointed out that The National Lottery is one of the favorite pastimes of countless Brits, meaning that Allwyn has high standards to live up to. However, Andrew is optimistic that the lottery will continue to change the lives of millions of people under Allwyn’s leadership.</p>
<p>From mental health services and preserving heritage and the arts to supporting our Olympians and Paralympians, The National Lottery will continue to have a positive impact on the lives of millions. Stuart Andrew</p>
<p>In the meantime, IGT recently extended its partnership with The National Lottery.</p>
