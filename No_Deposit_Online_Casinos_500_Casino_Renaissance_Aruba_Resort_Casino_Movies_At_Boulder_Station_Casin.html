    <h1>No Deposit Online Casinos 500 Casino Renaissance Aruba Resort Casino Movies At Boulder Station Casin</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Hope you are all well,</p>
<p>Thank you for reaching out to us with your concerns.</p>
<p>Regarding the incident that occured on the 6th of October, we will try to explain in detail why the player wasn't able to finalize the withdrawal.</p>
<p>The player has indeed received 30 free spins for completing the review of the new Vegas XL game on Casino Extreme's Blog. The bonus came with the following terms:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Blog Promotion - 30 Free Spins Reward for the game review;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Code: <strong><em>*</em></strong>;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Value: 30 Free Spins on New Game;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wagering: 45x;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Max cash out: $50;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Playable on: Slots, Non-Progressive Only;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Available from OCT 6 - OCT 13.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Upon playing the 30 free spins, the player's winnings were $2.05. The 45x wagering requirements apply to said winnings, hence, the player was required to wager a total of $92.25 in order to meet the playthrough requirements.</p>
<p>At one point during the playthrough, the player's balance dropped under $1.00, and at this moment the coupon restrictions have been removed by the system. The coupons are set to convert if the balance drops below $1 by our software provider. Without this setting in place, every coupon would remain locked and require the player to actively play until the balance is 0. That means no player would be able to play with another coupon or with bonus free deposit until we manually remove the coupon.</p>
<p>Due to this setting, Casino Extreme explicitly states in the official Terms &amp; Conditions that the terms of the promotion remain in full effect even after the playable balance has dropped under $1.00.</p>
<p>https://casinoextreme.eu/terms-and-conditions</p>
<ol>
<li>BONUSES AND PROMOTIONS</li>
</ol>
<p>7.1. General Bonus and Promotion Rules</p>
<p>v. "Once a bonus is claimed, the terms of that bonus step into effect immediately. These terms remain in full effect until a new Fund Action (Deposit or Bonus) is processed to your account and after the bonus has been cleared from your balance. Bonus Terms will remain in effect after Wagering has been met. Bonus Terms will remain in effect after a Withdrawal is processed. Bonus Terms will remain in effect after Playable Balance drops below $/â‚¬ 1. Depositing on top of your existing bonus balance does not void the Bonus Terms. Any violations of the terms while they are in effect, may result in all winnings being voided as per the Terms &amp; Conditions."</p>
<p>At this point, the player has wagered a total of $69.00, which meant that additional $23.25 had to be wagered in order for the playthrough requirements to be met. Therefore, the player's withdrawal request has been canceled and the funds have been returned to the player's account in order for the wagering requirements to be met.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the player has decided to proceed to play Blackjack, which, according to the terms of the VEGAS30 promotion, is not allowed.</p>
<p>Upon submitting the subsequent withdrawal request, it has been established that a restricted game has been played, hence, the winnings had to be voided. The player also received a full explanation by email as to why, unfortunately, the winnings were voided.</p>
<p>We would also like to emphasize that the player had received multiple free promotions in the coming days and had received payouts from more than one, when the requirements of each promotion were met without any violations. Hopefully, this proves that the incident explained above is an isolated issue and with the clarification provided, it should not occur again.</p>
<p>Should any additional explanation be required, please do not hestitate to contact us.</p>
<p>Kind Regards,</p>
<p>Casino Extreme Team</p>
