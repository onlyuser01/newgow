    <h1>Washington Casino Hotels Casinos St Louis Vegas Gems Sweepstakes Casino Catalina Island Casino Casin</h1>

<p>Dear sparkleritter,</p>
<p>I was provided with sufficient evidence supporting Nick's claims and the casino's decision.</p>
<p>After gathering all the necessary information and details, we are closing this complaint as unjustified due to breaching the casino's Terms and Conditions - multiple accounts (several linked accounts that were banned by the casino in the past, so you were not allowed to open another one and/or by new registration, you risked your funds) and multiple free bonuses use consecutively without making a deposit.</p>
<p>It is the players' obligation to read the terms and conditions before accepting them. Even if there were no other accounts and no abuse in the past, the deposit of a minimum amount was made only after the disputed winnings were won, and they were accumulated with the 2nd consecutive no-deposit bonus. Therefore, you would not have been entitled to the winnings obtained from this bonus anyway. In addition, any of your further winnings are considered invalid since making a deposit on top of the existing bonus money funds caused "mixing funds".</p>
<p>The casino acted within its terms and conditions, and basically, considering the other circumstances and banned accounts/violations, it is only up to the casino whether it decides to refund your deposit or not, and whether it will close your account or not. Thus, there is nothing we can help you with in this case.</p>
<p>The applied rules are available HERE - it is basically explained at the beginning, in the first half of the section "General Terms &amp; Conditions for Membership". Other ones, related to bonuses, are in the section "RULES".</p>
<p>Sorry, we were not able to help you with this one, but please, do not hesitate to contact us in the future, if you run into any issues with this or any other casino. We are here to help.</p>
<p>In case of any questions, feel free to write to me at branislav.b@casino.guru.</p>
<p>Thank you very much, Nick and Raging Bull Slots Casino, for providing the necessary details and for your cooperation!</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Branislav, Casino.Guru</p>
