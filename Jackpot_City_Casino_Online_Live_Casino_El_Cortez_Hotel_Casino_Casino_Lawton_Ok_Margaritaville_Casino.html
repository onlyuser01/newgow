<p>Amid a developing trend with esports teams to prioritize players‚Äô health, Bucks Gaming has become the latest team to strike an important partnership with Froedtert Health.</p>
<p>Esports Players‚Äô Well-being Opportunities Within Bucks Gaming</p>
<p>Froedtert &amp; the Medical College of Wisconsin has teamed up with NBA 2K League esports franchise, Bucks Gaming owned by the Milwaukee Bucks. As a result, Froedtert is becoming the official health sponsor of the esports outfit.</p>
<p>Buck Gaming co-managing directory Colin Hayes explained that the partnership was signed for one year and that the esports organization would display Froedtert &amp; MCW‚Äôs logo during all digital competitions taking place in the virtual NBA 2K League.</p>
<p>Health is wealth!</p>
<p>One of the last stops during our stay at @TheAmericanClub was with an experienced chef, who showed our players some quick and easy ways to eat healthy during the season üôè</p>
<p>The full recap video at #DestinationKohler will be released tomorrow, so stay tuned! pic.twitter.com/lSj9bCaivA ‚Äî Bucks Gaming (@BucksGG) May 28, 2019</p>
<p>Froedtert Heath director of marketing, advertising and digital communications Chris Sadler expressed his appreciation for the newly-formed partnership, saying:</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe are excited to be a part of Bucks Gaming, and we see this partnership as another way to connect with a younger generation within our community and stress the importance of good health to NBA 2K League fans.‚Äù</p>
<p>A similar sentiment was expressed by Hayes who was equally excited at the opportunity, adding that the team was ‚Äúthrilled to extend the organization‚Äôs partnership with Froedtert &amp; MCW to Bucks Gaming.‚Äù Hayes continued by adding that Bucks Gaming had ‚Äúplaced an enormous emphasis on health and wellness of our players this season and believe that a healthy lifestyle is paramount to achieving peak performance in our team on and off the court.</p>
<p>The NBA 2K League is named after the namesake video game developed by Electronic Arts. The league launched in 2018 under the aegis of the NBA with NBA Commissioner Adam Silver calling the new entity ‚Äúpart of the family. Today, the league features 21 teams and it has expanded to feature Hong Kong qualifiers earlier this year.</p>
<p>Bucks Gaming aren‚Äôt the first team to take the wellness of their esports players seriously with Magic Gaming signing up with Orlando Health earlier this year. From reducing burnout to mediating stress, esports organizations are on a quest to help players and fans lead longer &amp; healthier lives.</p>
