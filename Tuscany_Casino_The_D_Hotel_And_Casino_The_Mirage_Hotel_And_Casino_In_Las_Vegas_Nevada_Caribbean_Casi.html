<p>Greyhound races are a bit of a niche sport, but there are enough fans out there. One issue sports has faced is connecting with those audiences. Greyhound Racing Victoria, though, may finally have a solution that works. The organization has teamed up with Sky Racing Broadcasting to ensure that more people will see the races as the two partners work together on producing even more content and opportunities.</p>
<p>Owned by Tabcorp, Sky Racing will focus on broadcasting content from Greyhound Racing Victoria and seek to raise the sport’s profile. It will be no easy task as animal races are plummeting worldwide, but Australians and most other anglophones in the region still seem to have a soft spot for them.</p>
<p>Tabcorp is also hoping to get something in return. By broadcasting these races, it stands a very good chance to get more people to use its sports betting platform, TAB, and drive betting handle on greyhound races. The overall objectives are much broader and more ambitious, though, with helping a traditionalist sport gain a sufficient foothold in the modern sports environment and benefit from that to the best of its ability.</p>
<p>Through Sky Racing’s airtime, Greyhound Racing Victoria is hoping to reach domestic and international audiences and cultivate even more opportunities. Digital will be a huge part of this offer as one of the best ways to engage with fans these days is through social media channels as well.</p>
<p>Pondering the implications of the partnership, Tabcorp General Manager of Sky Operations, Aam Brownlee, said that the partnership would also benefit people looking to place a bet. Besides, the two companies already have a strong partnership.</p>
<p>"Sky and GRV have a longstanding partnership and the new agreement will strengthen our relationship," Brownlee explained. Brownlee doubled down on the sports betting potential this partnership would create, remaining confident that sports bettors and sports fans will see this as an opportunity to pursue betting options through TAB’s generous offer.</p>
<p>As for Greyhound Racing Victoria CEO Stuart Laing, the executive was first hopeful that the partnership may indeed lead to an uptick in the people watching and enjoying the sport. The organization will work very closely with Sky Racing to ensure that the sport can be showcased to sports betting fans in the best possible light.</p>
