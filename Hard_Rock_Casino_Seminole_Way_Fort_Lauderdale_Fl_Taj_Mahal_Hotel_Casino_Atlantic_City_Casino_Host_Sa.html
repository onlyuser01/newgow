<p>NeoGames and Caesars Entertainment have been happy with their collaboration. This is why the companies have taken preemptive measures and amended an already fruitful partnership that sees the existing license agreement with an affiliate of Caesars Entertainment extended.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the renewed and improved collaboration, NeoGames will continue to offer Caesars a sublicense for its NeoSphere platform, which is an advanced Player Account Management solution. What this means is that Caesars will be able to continue using advanced platforms and systems by NeoGames to operate its successful iGaming and online sports betting businesses, which have proven pivotal in the company’s overall success and market ambitions for the US market.</p>
<p>NeoGames will be involved with Caesars throughout the term of the sublicensing deal, assisting the company with various operations. NeoGames will similarly aid Caesars to transition any operations that are currently on NeoGames’ platform to Caesars’ own, the press release specifies. NeoGames CEO Moti Malul welcomed the terms of the new deals, with his company still securing a guaranteed net profit level for the duration of the partnership.</p>
<p>Malul confirmed that NeoGames will continue to deliver market-leading services to Caesars and work closely with the company’s team to drive the best possible results for the company’s online betting and iGaming arms in the regulated gambling market in the United States. Naturally, the deal was also welcomed by Caesars Digital President Eric Hession.</p>
<p>"We appreciate the commitment and strong support of the NeoGames team over the years, and the important role that its technology plays in the success of our online sports betting and iGaming business," Hession explained.</p>
<p>He hailed the qualities of NeoGames as a tech partner and said that the company is very interested to continue working with its partner as Caesars advances its iGaming and interactive betting footprint in the United States.</p>
<p>The original partnership between the companies has been further extended for a period of three years and automated renewals unless either party wishes to terminate the agreement.</p>
