<p>Las Vegas Raiders vs Kansas City Chiefs is the Monday Night Football game of Week 5. The game is taking place at Arrowhead on October 10, which is almost exactly one year since the last time the Chiefs lost a home game in regular time.</p>
<p>This season, they are 3-1 overall with a 1-0 record at home. Judging by the betting odds, it seems very likely they will add another home win to the list on Monday night. It’s not just because Mahomes &amp; Co. are fantastic in 2022; it’s also because the Raiders are not.</p>

<p>Patrick Mahomes Looking Unstoppable</p>
<p>The Chiefs quarterback is playing on another level in 2022. He’s sharing the leader position in passing touchdowns with Jared Goff and Lamar Jackson – each of them has thrown for 11 TDs thus far.</p>
<p>He’s second in passer rating, just behind Tua Tagovailoa, as well as sixth in terms of total passing yards. The most impressive thing is that only two of his throws ended up intercepted in 2022.</p>
<p>We did, however, see him get sacked five times, three of which happened in the previous game week when they beat the Buccaneers 41-31. Still, that doesn’t have much to do with him but with the Chiefs’ offensive line, which didn’t provide enough protection for the QB.</p>
<p>On the bright side for them, they did play against one of the best defenses in the league last weekend. In Week 5, however, they’re taking on a team that’s conceding 25.0 points per game.</p>
<p>Las Vegas Raiders Coming Off Their First Win of the Season</p>
<p>The Raiders defensive stats aren’t great in 2022, but this doesn’t mean their defense is horrible. On the contrary, we think that they’re better than they were the last season now that they got Chandler Jones in the defensive end position.</p>
<p>The reason why they’ve conceded so many points so far is that their schedule has been really ugly. In the first three weeks of the 2022 season, the Raiders played (and lost) to the Los Angeles Chargers, Arizona Cardinals, and Tennessee Titans. In Week 4, they finally got themselves their first win of the season. They beat the Denver Broncos 32-23.</p>
<p>Las Vegas Raiders vs Kansas City Chiefs Prediction</p>
<p>Despite being 1-3 in the 2022 NFL season, the Raiders are actually a very good team. Unfortunately for their fans, they probably aren’t good enough to beat the Chiefs, especially not in Kansas City.</p>
<p>Picks: Kansas City Chiefs to win, but not cover the spread; over to hit</p>
