    <h1>River City Casino Hotel Toledo Casino Usa Casinos Tulalip Casino Events Primm Casino Oshi Casino Pla</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I never been have worst experince than on oshi casino.</p>
<p>This is on my top worst casino i been playing on since i play casino 10 years.</p>
<p>Stay away from this casino, they will do everything in the world to try to scam you on your winnings ( Raw deposit )</p>
<p>However i did make a raw deposit on this casino 24th of may.. I manage to win 28k and did decided to withdrawal my money.</p>
<p>I did before send documents and they did approve all, im living in Malta but was on vacation in Sweden when this all did happened. Now when i did make my WD they cancel it and did ask me why i was playing from sweden.</p>
<p>Totally fine, i did explain how it was with vacation and made my WD again, after another day they cancel again my WD and keep asking me now from nowhere to go outside my street in Malta to take selfie with street name and send to them. Never have done that to anyone else ( other casino , playing over 100+ casinos )</p>
<p>So after a couple of days i came back to Malta and did that also to them. After that they approve my documents AGAIN and even send email that my account is full verified. Now after another day they cancel again my WD and ask me to go and buy newsletter timeofmalta and take selfie with that and still they have approve my account 2 times and yet not send me 1 WD out of 15. I did even that as they asked me. Now finally after a couple of days they send me first WD to my revelout on 4000â‚¬.</p>
<p>Now aftet that the first withdrawal has came to me, they start to tell we cannot send anymore to revelout they do not accept the request. I went to Revelout live chat to ask if its true and they told me nobody has from this company tried to send you anything, i ask the casino for proof but could of course not get it.</p>
<p>Now they asked me to make wire transfer to revelout and ASK ME AGAIN for BANKSTATEMENT which is have send to them already, so they asking for documents they got already again from me. When i point out that to them, they said " ohh totally fine now we can send again your money" i have full chat with the agent when they keep on confirming me my accounts its fine , i will get my money 100 times and they do not sending my anything. Now after the wire transfer they keeping telling revelout does not accept casino payment..</p>
<p>I need some serious help here from this scam casino that trying everything they can to scam me on my money.</p>
<p>I cant upload any files to you so i would like your Complaint team to reach me by my email so i can provide you with chat transcript of this approval where they state all is good</p>
