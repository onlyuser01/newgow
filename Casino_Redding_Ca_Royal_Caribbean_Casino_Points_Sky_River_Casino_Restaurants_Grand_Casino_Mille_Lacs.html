    <h1>Casino Redding Ca Royal Caribbean Casino Points Sky River Casino Restaurants Grand Casino Mille Lacs</h1>

<p>Hi, my problem dates back to last summer, I did not know of the existence of this site so I hope to be in time ... So: both me and my partner have a passion for the game of poker. I had opened the pokerstars account about 10 years ago, instead my partner just over two years ago. We live together, therefore the same residence, the same address, the same Wi-Fi network and the same devices. I would like to clarify that we have never participated in any type of online event concurrently, we have never "colluded" as can be seen from the game history of both. I receive an email from pokerstars asking me to explain what the relationship is between me and the user "xxxx", who would be my partner. I answer all the questions, proving everything with data, documents, residence, etc. I am replied after a couple of days that my account will be blocked as there is a doubt that my partner's account is actually my alleged second account. I find it an arbitrary, unfair and unfounded decision. And above all I wonder why they decided to continue with the closure of my nearly 10 year old account, keeping open what they suspect is a duplicate account so the data would not be mine ?! Could it be because my partner created twice as much game volume in two years as I generated in 10 ?! So if it is possible, I would like to ask for my pokerstars account to be reopened.</p>
