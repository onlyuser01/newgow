<p>American B2B gambling products supplier Scientific Games has inked an extension to its relationship with the South Dakota Lottery. The two companies have been working together for around three decades now and are happy to continue their collaborations.</p>
<p>Scientific Games Reiterates Commitment to South Dakota Lottery</p>
<p>Scientific Games, which has supplied the South Dakota Lottery for about 30 years, has extended the partnership by six years. The new deal will see the former company as the lottery’s exclusive instant scratch games provider. Scientific Games will, therefore, continue to provide the South Dakota Lottery and players in the state with “good fun.”</p>
<p>The supplier has been powering the South Dakota Lottery with scratch games since the beginning of the two’s partnership and has helped the lottery achieve double-digit growth in its instant vertical. A part of the proceeds has always been donated to support education in the Mount Rushmore State. Thanks to Scientific Games’ scratch cards, the lottery has donated to many K12 schools, universities and institutes within the state.</p>
<p>According to the deal, Scientific Games will also supply the lottery with analytics, insights, popular brands and other marketing services. As announced by the supplier, the deal can be extended for four more years.</p>
<p>The Lottery Is Glad to Be Supported by a Leading Supplier</p>
<p>Norm Lingle, executive director of the South Dakota Lottery, commented on the deal. He praised Scientific Games for boosting the lottery’s momentum and said that his team is excited to deepen its relationship with the supplier.</p>
<p>We’ve created great momentum with our instant game performance through our long-term partnership with Scientific Games to benefit important programs in our state. Our teams look forward to continued collaboration on the design and marketing of quality, secure, high-performance games that entertain South Dakota players. Norm Lingle, exec director, South Dakota Lottery</p>
<p>Meanwhile, John Schulz, Scientific Games’ president for the Americas and global instant products, said that his company is delighted to continue serving as the lottery’s sole provider. He vowed to continue supporting the South Dakota Lottery with the supplier’s industry-leading content and services.</p>
<p>We are honored to be named the sole provider of South Dakota Lottery scratch games and will continue to support the Lottery in its mission to provide funding for vital state programs. We are focused on using our world-leading industry analytics and insights to innovate new products for the South Dakota Lottery to help achieve responsible growth. John Schulz, president Americas/global instant products, SG</p>
<p>A week ago, Scientific Games extended its deal with another state lottery by inking a 12-year partnership extension with the Texas Lottery. A week prior to that, the supplier penned an agreement with Latvia’s lottery.</p>
