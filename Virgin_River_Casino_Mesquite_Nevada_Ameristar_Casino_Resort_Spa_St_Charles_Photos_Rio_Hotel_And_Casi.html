    <h1>Virgin River Casino Mesquite Nevada Ameristar Casino Resort Spa St Charles Photos Rio Hotel And Casi</h1>

<p>Hello, I signed up for this resource about 5 months ago. The total turnover in slot games I made above as on</p>
<p>UAH 2,000,000. The main slots that I use are slot games from the provider Pragmatic Play such as: Dog House, Dog House Megaweys, Wild West Gold, Madame Desteni Megaweys, Gates Of Olympus, Sweet Bonanza, Xmas Bonanza, Big Baz Bonanza. The claimed return of the provider in the slots in the description of the games is 94.6% with high volatility. Now let's go in order:</p>
<p>1) Dog House: the game made about 30,000 spins with bets of different equivalents from 1 to 24 hryvnia, received exactly 100 bonus games, not one x1000 of the bet, the return rate was about 34% - with a stated 94.6%.</p>
<p>2) Dog House Megaweys: 9 bonus games with the equivalent of UAH 500,600,700 were purchased, the maximum x from the bet was x12, the return was less than 4% - with the stated 94.6%.</p>
<p>3) Wild West Gold: bought 99 bonus games with the equivalent of bets from 400 to 2500 hryvnia, none x1000, the total rate of return of 46.2% with the stated 94.6%.</p>
<p>4) Madame Desteny Megaweys: bought exactly 100 bonus games equivalent to 400 to 2500 hryvnias, not one x1000 !!! the percentage of return is 31.2% - with the stated 94.6%.</p>
<p>5) Gates of Olympus: bought exactly 100 bonus games, equivalent to 400 to 3000 hryvnias, not one x1000, the maximum x was x329 !!! from the rate for 100 BUYED BONUSES !!! it is less than 10% of return - at the declared 94,6% !!!!</p>
<p>6) Sweet Bonanza: bought 29 bonus games, equivalent to 500 to 1500 hryvnias, 14 of them !!! gave less x10 !!! The percentage of return is 6% - with the stated 94.6% !!!!</p>
<p>7) Xmas Bonanza: bought 60 bonus games, equivalent to 300 to 1500 hryvnias, the total return rate is 27.5% - with the stated 94.6%</p>
<p>8) Big Baz Bonanza: made a total of about 1,500 turns, equivalent to a spin from 2 to 15 hryvnia. 32 bonuses were caught, not one x1000, the percentage of return is 12.4% - with the declared 94.6% !!!</p>
<p>So what we see: Total bought or caught for the backs of bonus games in the provider Pragmatic Play: 529 spent on them ~ 500 000 hryvnia, the total rate of return is 14.3% compared to the stated 94.6%. I also want to note that all the bonus offers from your casino I bought from them played less than 20%! All cashbacks that were awarded to me for unsuccessful sessions SUCCESSFULLY LOST !!! BUT NOT PLAYED OUT AND REMOVED !!! YOUR CASINO HAS NOT EVEN MADE ME TO PLAY CASHBACK !!!</p>
<p>Here is a letter I sent to the casino administration more than a month ago, after which I received a reply that my account was blocked. I asked for what reason, I was told that the administration is conducting an investigation into my complaint. For 37 days they have been rechecking something there, although by law they had a maximum of 30</p>
<p>days. The last time I applied was 3 days ago, but of course no one answered. I came to the conclusion that the casino administration simply "throws" people for money and blocks accounts. This is despite the fact that they have a valid license !!! Do not follow the law 768-9 on gambling. I demand from this casino to fully compensate me for the funds for which I was deceived.</p>
