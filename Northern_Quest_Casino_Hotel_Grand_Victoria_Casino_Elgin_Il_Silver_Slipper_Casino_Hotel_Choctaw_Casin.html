    <h1>Northern Quest Casino Hotel Grand Victoria Casino Elgin Il Silver Slipper Casino Hotel Choctaw Casin</h1>

<p>20bet are arrogant scammers. This site does not pay money to its players.</p>
<p>I've played for about a week on the site.</p>
<p>The first deposit was made from the card. The site does not have a withdrawal to the card, so I tried to withdraw money to my crypto wallet. The withdrawal has been canceled by the site. Reason: in order to withdraw to cryptocurrency, I needed to make a deposit from the cryptocurrency, and also "wager" it. I understand that these are the rules of the site and followed them. Then I tried to withdraw funds. And here the horror began. First, they asked me for a full set of documents: my passport, a photo of my card on both sides, a bank statement. I sent all the documents, and the site accepted them. The withdrawal request was rejected. Then they asked for a photo with a passport, I've immediately sent it.</p>
<p>The photo was accepted, but the withdrawal was again rejected. For the third time they asked for a new photo with a sheet of paper and the text "Hi 20bet". The photo was uploaded. But the withdrawal was again rejected. This time they requested a new document confirming the address. I've sent it, document was accepted. But again the withdrawal was rejected. They said that the document confirming the address was issued more than 3 months ago, although the document was issued in May. After discussion with support, they've admitted the mistake, accepted the documents and allowed to make the withdrawal. Then they just closed my account! Withdrawal of funds is not available. Now they're asking me for some more photos. But I have no desire and strength to send my personal information to scammers. I give up. I do not recommend this fraudulent site to anyone. You will not be able to collect your winnings.</p>
