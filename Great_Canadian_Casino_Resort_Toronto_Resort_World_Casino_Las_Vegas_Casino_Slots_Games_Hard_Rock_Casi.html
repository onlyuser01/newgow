<p>The Local Government Association and the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners are appealing for tougher regulations on the gambling industry amid gambling harm concerns. They hope that this will be taken into mind in the 2005 Gambling Act review.</p>
<p>Councils Should be Able to Choose Which Venues to Greenlight</p>
<p>The concerns stem from recent research that concluded 21% of land-based gambling shops are situated in poor neighborhoods, exposing the families living there to risk. The appellants demand the local councils be granted the power to stop the establishment of more such venues in deprived areas, especially in locations near schools and treatment centers.</p>
<p>LGA’s chairman of safer and stronger communities board, Nesil Caliskan, spoke on the issue. She claims that she isn’t opposed to the gambling industry but wants it to prioritize the safety of people at risk of gambling harm. Caliskan explained:</p>
<p>“The review [of the 2005 Gambling Act] is a golden opportunity for the government to implement further measures that empower local communities and their elected representatives to determine what and how many gambling premises they have in their local areas.” LGA’s chairman of safer and stronger communities board, Nesil Caliskan</p>
<p>Caliskan added that the fact local councils have such a limited power is simply outrageous.</p>
<p>Problem Gambling is a Danger to All</p>
<p>APCC’s joint leads for addictions and substance misuse, David Sidwick and Joy Allen, noted that gambling harm victims often resort to crime. Sometimes, the crimes of gambling addicts aren’t light, which is why action should be taken.</p>
<p>“Problem gambling can do a great deal of harm, to both the individual and to society, and we want to ensure that support is available to those affected and, where the industry has acted irresponsibly, it is held to account for its actions.” APCC’s joint leads for addictions and substance misuse, David Sidwick and Joy Allen</p>
<p>Sidwick and Allen agree with the LGA that councils should have the power to take measures when needed. Caliskan is also concerned about the increasing volume of gambling ads shown on TV and the Internet – a sentiment shared by the APCC as well.</p>
<p>The two bodies remarked that vulnerable people are often tripped into betting by tempting marketing campaigns that promise them free bets. The appellants noted that even people who try to exclude themselves from gambling sometimes spring back into it because of dangerous ads. The LGA demands stricter control of gambling advertisements, especially on TV channels and sites frequented by children.</p>
<p>The LGA and APCC agree with a previous proposal of imposing a mandatory statutory levy for gambling firms. The proposal envisions using the funds to support various gambling support clinics. Many gambling companies used to donate to such initiatives but the National Health Service recently announced that it will no longer accept money directly from the gambling industry amid independence concerns.</p>
