<p>Detroit Lions Offense Looks Great in 2022</p>
<p>The Lions are the team with the most productive offense in the league. With 140 points scored, they average 35 points per game. Last weekend, they had their best offensive performance of the season, scoring 45 points. This is a fantastic performance, especially considering that they weren’t able to count on several key players, including starting running back DeAndre Swift, and wide receivers D.J. Chark and Amon-Ra St. Brown.</p>
<p>Even without those players on the field, the Lions offense did great. This time, it was tight end T.J. Hockenson who produced a marvelous performance, scoring two touchdowns that day.</p>
<p>Still, he probably wouldn’t have done it if it weren’t for inch-perfect throws by quarterback Jared Goff. The 27-year-old is having a fantastic season, ranking eighth in QBR in the league, with a 60.9 passing percentage, 1,126 passing yards, and 11 touchdowns.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for the Lions, their defense has been nowhere near as good as their offense. In fact, with 141 points conceded, their defense is the worst in the league. On the bright side for them, they’ll be taking on the banged-up New England Patriots offense in Week 5.</p>
<p>New England Patriots’ Offensive Problems Not Going Away</p>
<p>New England’s starting quarterback Mac Jones picked up an injury in Week 3, which meant that backup Brian Hoyer had to take his place in Week 4. Unfortunately, he too suffered an injury, so third-choice QB Bailey Zappe took the stage. The 2022 fourth-round pick did surprisingly well in that game, throwing 10/15 for 99 yards and one touchdown.</p>
<p>Zappe did well in that game, but he probably isn’t going to start in Week 5. It’s going to be either Hoyer (who did miss practice on Wednesday due to the injury) or Garrett Gilbert who signed with the Pats as a free agent a couple of days ago.</p>
<p>Regardless of who gets to play in the QB position for the Patriots in Week 5, we do not expect this team to do too great offensively. They’re averaging 18.5 points per game in 2022, and we don’t think they’ll improve that number significantly on Sunday.</p>
<p>Detroit Lions vs New England Patriots Prediction</p>
<p>The Lions are great in the offense, but poor in the defense. It’s just the opposite when it comes to the Patriots. That said, we expect to see a close game on Sunday, which is probably going to be decided by no more than a field goal. This is why we think that the best betting option for this game is to back the Lions to cover the spread.</p>
<p>Pick: Detroit Lions (+3)</p>
