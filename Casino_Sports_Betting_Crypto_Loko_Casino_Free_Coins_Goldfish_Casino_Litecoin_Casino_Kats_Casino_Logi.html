    <h1>Casino Sports Betting Crypto Loko Casino Free Coins Goldfish Casino Litecoin Casino Kats Casino Logi</h1>

<p>Dear Xotin35,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. Before we contact the casino and ask for their standpoint, could you please forward emails or screenshots showing that you have sent a request for a self-exclusion? My email address is petronela.k@casino.guru. Did you specify in that request for how long you wish your account to be suspended and the reason why?</p>
<p>When applying for the self-exclusion, state clearly the reason why you want your account to be deactivated and specify the time period. Also, email "Subject" should be clearly marked and easily recognizable as casino support receives many requests per day hence, if it’s visibly marked you stand a better chance to have your request granted as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>Email subject: Self-exclusion</p>
<p>Player’s info:</p>
<p>First name:</p>
<p>Last name:</p>
<p>DOB:</p>
<p>Casino login:</p>
<p>Email address:</p>
<p>"Greetings Superb Casino,</p>
<p>I’m writing to inform you that I wish to exclude immediately from this casino and from receiving any gambling-related marketing material for a minimum period of xxx months/years (lifetime).</p>
<p>The reason that preceded my decision is xxx</p>
<p>I acknowledge that I will not be allowed to rescind my self-exclusion during this period and self-exclusion cannot be lifted before the end of the agreed period."</p>
<p>Please send another email to support@superb.bet (you can CC me at petronela.k@casino.guru in the copy) and keep me informed about any further developments. If there is any option for an alternative contact such as live chat or WhatsApp, please try that too and save screenshots of the relevant communication.</p>
<p>In the meantime, you also have the option to utilize our Self-Exclusion Assistance Tool. This tool allows you to block your casino accounts across multiple gambling establishments simultaneously and is not affiliated with any specific casino. The Self-Exclusion Assistance Tool was designed to assist individuals who may be facing challenges with their gambling habits by helping them limit their access to gambling and reduce the potential for further harm.</p>
<p>I hope we will be able to help you to resolve this issue as soon as possible. Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
