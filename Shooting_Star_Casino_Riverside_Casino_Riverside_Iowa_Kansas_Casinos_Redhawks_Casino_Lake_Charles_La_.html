    <h1>Shooting Star Casino Riverside Casino Riverside Iowa Kansas Casinos Redhawks Casino Lake Charles La</h1>

<p>A casino that was reviewed and promoted by me, had recently updated the terms and conditions. The terms on the withdrawal section, stated that withdrawals are processed in 3 days max. ( Ewallets were included). Also there was a max cashout policy if 10x the initial deposit. Imagine that when it was reviewed the withdrawal time frame was 1 day on e wallets with no max cap.</p>
<p>Another online casino has problematic withdrawal methods. What do I mean by that? A player deposits via neteller and wants to withdraw. The available withdrawal methods are paysafe and bank transfer. Doesn't that make it difficult for a player to withdraw? Casino asks for a new deposit by the player with a bank transfer in order to verify it and withdraw whole sum. For this these kind of situations that are in a thin line being able to be turned into complaints are a no go. Even if I asked the support why don't they fix it , since it is a new issue, I was informed that due to new money processor the situation will remain like this and it's not an issue. Moreover after couple of weeks I re contacted the support to ask them again, I was informed that there isn't any problem and maybe due to jurisdiction from my side might be the problem. Eventhough it wasn't.</p>
<p>These issues that tempt to appear and not being fixed is something that I don't want to represent. Eventhough I'm not a guy with 10.000 followers, I like promoting fast and good casinos. Yes it might sound cliche but as a gambler myself I don't want to promote unfair casinos.</p>
