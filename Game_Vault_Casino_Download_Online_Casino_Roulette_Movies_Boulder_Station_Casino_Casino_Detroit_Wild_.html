<p>The addition of the two gambling industry experts strengthens the company's team, amid plans for further growth and expansion</p>
<p>The fast-growing gaming content and platform provider and developer, Jogo Global, strengthened its C-suite by announcing two strategic hires. The company confirmed on Wednesday it hired gambling industry veterans, Patrick Southon and Simon Collins.</p>
<p>Joining Jogo Global, Southon was appointed to the role of non-executive director. On the other hand, Collins joined the company as its executive chairman. The strategic hires come at a time when Jogo Global continues to expand its offering and global footprint. Currently, the company offers top-performing fast games from Mines to Crash.</p>
<p>By hiring the two experts with extensive experience, Jogo Global seeks to grow further within the gambling vertical. A market that the company is particularly interested in is the United States. Jogo Global has identified the potential of the land-based sector in the country and it anticipates its solutions, technology and content to be well received.</p>
<p>Southon and Collins’ appointments come as no surprise, considering their extensive experience. The duo delivers a unique entrepreneurial experience within the iGaming vertical after founding the successful online bingo business behind the famous UK brand, Foxy Bingo, Cashcade, which was sold back in 2009 in a deal surpassing $100 million.</p>
<p>The Duo, Delighted to Join the Company</p>
<p>Southon outlined that he is delighted to join Jogo Global as a non-executive director. He said that it will be exciting to collaborate for the company’s development with its senior-level members. “Operators worldwide are seeing the benefits of the Jogo Global offering and it’s a great time to join this talented and fast-growing team,” said Southon in conclusion.</p>
<p>Collins, Jogo Global’s new executive chairman, was similarly delighted to become a part of the company’s leadership team. He spoke about Jogo Global’s unique products that deliver engaging and thrilling experiences. Finally, Collins said: “My time as non-executive chairman has been very fruitful, and I’m thrilled to now become Executive Chairman at the beginning of this promising new chapter.”</p>
<p>“We’ve experienced exponential growth over the past 12 months.“ David Marcus, CEO of Jogo Global</p>
<p>David Marcus, Jogo Global’s CEO, added that in the last year, the company has seen significant growth. Now, he pointed out, that the addition of the gambling industry experts will supercharge the company’s growth and enable it to continue to expand, delivering unique solutions and products.</p>
