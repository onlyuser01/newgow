    <h1>Ocean Casino Resort Atlantic City Green Valley Ranch Resort Spa Casino Henderson Nv Foxwoods Casino</h1>

<p>This is nothing more than a scam as others have said.</p>
<p>registered wagered - no issues. Became apparent that the games had to be fixed. Patterns in card hands and hand after hand dealer had 20s, if he got a 5, it was a 6 followed by a ten. I’d get blackjack so would be, I’d double a 10/11 and get 2/3/4/5, on the occasion I got 18/19/20 he beat me. This was over weeks of play.</p>
<p>slots similar, win £30 the. Go from £200 down to £0 with not a bonus round.</p>
<p>ok suddenly my account shows verified, didn’t think anything but I’d sent no id or nothing to them. I check my details today and my DOB is wrong by a long way. Contacted them and they said well you must have sent in your licence or passport, I said NO.</p>
<p>this morning I get a message saying daily dep limit hit after about £300 maybe. I go back couple of hours later and allows deposits again. I question this and they say they don’t set limits they don’t offer it. Pointed out as a responsible operator they have to to protect players time and £ used online. Told it’s the player’s responsibility not theirs and they don’t offer any controls. On the base of their website it points out responsible gambling and states they have a range of tools to help players, seems they don’t think it’s important.</p>
<p>So as I’m not a verified player (I’ve asked for a copy of the ID they’ve used to "verify" my account but nothing yet. On top of this the details are incorrect, had my ID been checked with the account details it would have highlighted DOB and age error but nothing. So I’m unverified, no KYC and the £0000s wagered they had no source of funds, no ID and they have never contacted about levels of deposits or controlling online spends.</p>
<p>complete disregard for players and don’t want to take any blame. With the levels of spend at times it should have flagged up and alerted them, they failed and just took the money. They have no way of confirming my identity and could be an underage individual using illicit funds which they have a duty to check.</p>
<p>ID and verifying is in their T&amp;Cs and they haven’t followed it. Responsible gambling tools are promoted on their site, but not offered. The cheeky t<strong>t from support said to me please send in your documents for verification as without these any withdraw would likely fail. So they are happy to take money without ID but try and cash out and they f</strong>k you over. Not responsible for an operator to allow a non verified player to deposit £1000s in a few hours</p>
<p>C***S. horrible horrible form have just bled me dry and left with no saving or nothing . What can I do, I understand their licence may be an issue but anything else? Fraudulently scamming my kids money.</p>
