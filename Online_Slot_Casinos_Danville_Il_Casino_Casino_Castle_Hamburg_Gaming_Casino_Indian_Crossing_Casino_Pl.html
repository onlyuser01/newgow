<p>Gaming giant Playtech continues to push ground-breaking products amid internal strife between shareholders and management.</p>
<p>Playtech Releases Live Slots and Quantum Blackjack</p>
<p>Playtech has introduced two industry game-changers. On December 19, the company pioneered the Live Slots and Quantum Blackjack products. Playtech is pushing ahead with the Live Slots solution, which will combine live dealers with the popularity of the slot experience.</p>
<p>Styled after popular rival products, such as Evolution Gaming’s Dream Catcher and Monopoly, the Live Slots initiative will be presented as a live casino show. Playtech will focus on the communal experience by bringing a so-called ‘community spins’ option into play.</p>
<p>Players will be allowed to team up and place wagers on the same game together. Yet, the studio plans on introducing variable control mechanisms so as to allow players to stay in control of their bankrolls.</p>
<p>For example, participants can tinker with the limit and number of spins, how much each spin is worth and how many spins are set as autoplay. Live Slots is not a single game, it’s an extension of the traditional slot and live experience.</p>
<p>Enter Buffalo Blitz Slot, Playtech’s First Live Slot</p>
<p>Kevin Kilminster from Playtech has explained the Live Slots concept in an official statement, cited by iGamingBusiness. ‘Live Slots is a genuinely new concept within the industry,’ Kilminster said.</p>
<p>He is right as the segment brings together two completely different verticals together. Playtech and Kilminster in his role of Head of Innovation within the company, have been drawing lessons from social media.</p>
<p>Based on their observations, players are seeking a more engaged experience, similar to social media. The interactive feeling is now a priority for Playtech. The focus on interaction is visible in Quantum Blackjack, developed off Quantum Roulette, and effectively becoming the first multiplayer Blackjack game in the online casino space.</p>
<p>Players can further benefit from a number of multipliers ranging from 3x, 5x to 10x. Kilminster has praised Quantum Roulette, pointing out its clear advantages as a game. In terms of live segment coverage, Playtech has had a very successful year, Kilminster specified.</p>
<p>A number of games have been launched, including Dragon Jackpot Baccarat, American Roulette, All Bets Blackjack and Casino Stud Poker to name a few. With the addition of Live Slots and Quantum Blackjack, the Playtech network has already grown with two priceless additions.</p>
<p>Internal Strife in the Company Contained</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Playtech has faced some internal strife. According to The Times, the New York-based hedge fund, Springowl, has insisted that Playtech cuts all ties with Teddy Sagi, who sold 11.5% sale stake in the software gambling giant in 2018.</p>
<p>The bone of contention has been the reelection of Chairman Alan Jackson with 40% of all shareholders voting against him and the current bonus and remuneration policy in Playtech, The Telegraph reported.</p>
<p>Shareholders have also protested against the remuneration of executives within the company. For example, Mor Weizer, the company’s boss received estimated €1.13 million in salary in 2018.</p>
<p>While this pales in comparison with the £320 million Bet365 boss Denise Coates received in 2018, shareholders have found Weizer’s remuneration disproportionate with the company’s results.</p>
