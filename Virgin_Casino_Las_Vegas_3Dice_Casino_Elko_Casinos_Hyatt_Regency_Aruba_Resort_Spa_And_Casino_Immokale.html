    <h1>Virgin Casino Las Vegas 3Dice Casino Elko Casinos Hyatt Regency Aruba Resort Spa And Casino Immokale</h1>

<p>GeoComply has introduced some changes to its team with the company appointing Kelly Schaefer and Lindsey Drake in new executive positions</p>
<p>Lindsey Drake will now step in as the company’s new chief financial officer (CFO) and Kelly Schaefer has joined as chief human resources officer (CHRO) at a time when GeoComply continues to grow and expand rapidly in the United States, North America, and the world in general.</p>
<p>GeoComply Taps Top Talent to Strengthen Growth</p>
<p>GeoComply has also been looking to grow beyond the sports betting and iGaming industries, through investments in Norwest Venture Partners and Arctos Sports Partners. GeoComply has found trusted experts in the faces of Drake and Schaefer who will help the company seek to expand and grow.</p>
<p>The company also made a determined stride in the compliance space with the acquisition of OneComply. All of the above events have increased GeoComply’s remit, expanded its customer base, and ushered in urgency to bring the right people to the right place to meet customer needs.</p>
<p>Drake will oversee financial planning, capital management, and budgeting for GeoComply. She is a well-seasoned corporate veteran who is able to design and execute financial strategies with ease. Schaefer is also an important asset as she will be working on strengthening GeoComply’s human resource strategy and adding to the talent pool the company uses to engage and develop.</p>
<p>Creating a Robust Company Culture</p>
<p>Schaefer has an established background in fostering and developing a positive work culture, which is precisely what GeoComply needs to have at its core to ensure that it continues to grow and expand in a meaningful and sustainable way. Anna Sainsbury, GeoComply’s boss, has welcomed the appointment of both.</p>
<p>“Their extensive expertise and leadership in their respective fields will be instrumental in guiding our financial strategy and strengthening our talent capabilities,” Sainsbury said. She confirmed that GeoComply is in the process of actively looking to expand its business footprint and to get there, it needs the best and brightest people who can offer solid contributions.</p>
<p>GeoComply has a people-centric approach to doing business which has allowed it to stay competitive and expand across numerous verticals, with a big focus on sports betting. GeoComply has helped deliver compelling arguments that have swayed legislators to proceed with the launch of sports gambling in several states in the United States.</p>
