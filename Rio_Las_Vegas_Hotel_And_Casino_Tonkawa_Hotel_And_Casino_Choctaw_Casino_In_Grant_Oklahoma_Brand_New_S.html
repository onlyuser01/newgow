    <h1>Rio Las Vegas Hotel And Casino Tonkawa Hotel And Casino Choctaw Casino In Grant Oklahoma Brand New S</h1>

<p>In this critical role, Foethke will be entrusted with advocating for the company's interests in the ever-changing landscape of politics and regulations</p>
<p>Bingen-based gaming giant Löwen Entertainment has recently named Sebastian Foethke as the new representative for political affairs and regulation. His appointment comes at a time when the gaming industry faces significant regulatory challenges, and Foethke’s expertise is seen as a valuable asset.</p>
<p>Sebastian Foethke Demonstrates Dedication and Influence at Löwen Entertainment</p>
<p>Having joined Löwen Entertainment’s public affairs team in 2017, Foethke has demonstrated his dedication and commitment to the company. Drawing from his extensive experience in the transport and logistics sector, Foethke has brought a fresh perspective to the gaming provider’s public affairs endeavors. His passion for the industry and strong track record have earned him recognition and trust among his peers.</p>
<p>As of May 2023, Foethke has also taken on the role of vice president for the German Online Casino Association (DOCV), representing Novo Interactive as Löwen Entertainment is part of the Novomatic Group of Companies. This new position further solidifies Foethke’s standing as an influential figure within the gaming community and attests to his ability to navigate the intricate web of regulatory complexities.</p>
<p>Dr. Daniel Henzgen, managing director of communications and compliance at Löwen Entertainment and also a director at Novo Interactive said: “We are facing major regulatory challenges in our industry. We are very pleased to be able to rely on Sebastian Foethke and his expertise in the field of public affairs.”</p>
<p>Henzgen further expressed his confidence in Foethke’s capabilities.</p>
<p>German Gaming Sector Faces Regulatory Changes</p>
<p>Notably, Löwen Entertainment has been an outspoken critic of the German State Treaty on Gambling, which was introduced over two years ago. The gaming provider has been actively involved in advocating for fair and reasonable regulations within the industry.</p>
<p>Germany’s gaming sector has witnessed a rapidly evolving regulatory landscape, with the Higher Administrative Court of the State of Saxony-Anhalt recently granting the German gaming regulator, Glücksspielbehörde der Länder (GGL), the authority to impose advertising restrictions.</p>
<p>Additionally, the GGL continues its efforts to combat the thriving black market for gambling in the country. According to the GGL’s latest report, unlicensed operators in Germany made up less than 5% as of December 2022. In other news, the German Sports Betting Association (DSWV) criticized the German Head Office for Addiction (DHS) for using incorrect figures and questionable sources in its article, Yearbook Addiction 2023. The DSWV insists that the DHS should correct the market size calculation based on federal tax data and reliable sources to accurately represent the sports betting market in Germany.</p>
