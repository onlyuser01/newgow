    <h1>Red Casino Online Casino Slots Vegas X Online Casino Real Money Casinos In Carson City Nevada River</h1>

<p>Hacksaw Gaming, the provider of distinct quality games for the online gambling sector, strengthened its presence in the United States thanks to a new collaboration. Joining forces with the renowned betting and gaming operator, DraftKings, the iGaming content provider expanded the reach of its titles to customers in West Virginia.</p>
<p>The new collaboration designated DraftKings as the second operator in the state to benefit from Hacksaw’s award-winning content. Per the terms of the new alliance, the content provider for the online gambling sector agreed to deliver its slot games including Outlaws Inc., Hop’N’Pop, as well as Hand of Anubis for DraftKings’ players in West Virginia.</p>
<p>Thanks to the new content agreement, the aforementioned titles have become available for the operator’s online casino lobby catering to customers in the state. According to a statement released by Hacksaw on Tuesday, more fan-favorite and popular games are expected to arrive for DraftKings’ customers soon. Such titles would include Wanted Dead or a Wild, the company’s flagship title, as well as other thrilling and engaging games like Gladiator Legends and Stack’em.</p>
<p>Marcus Cordes, Hacksaw’s CEO, acknowledged that the company was busy over the last few months, growing its US presence. He reminded that last month, Hacksaw secured complete regulatory approval, allowing it to expand its presence in the state.</p>
<p>Cordes added that the company is excited to deliver its engaging games for customers of DraftKings in West Virginia. Finally, he spoke about the strong position the operator holds within the iGaming vertical across the US and predicted that its clients will find Hacksaw’s games appealing.</p>
<p>“DraftKings is a name that needs no introduction in the world of iGaming, and we’ve no doubt our top-shelf content will find scores of new casino fans through this partnership.“ Marcus Cordes, CEO at Hacksaw Gaming</p>
<p>The Provider of iGaming Content Continues to Expand</p>
<p>Recently, Hacksaw expanded once again the reach of its thrilling games via a deal with REEVO, the renowned B2B content and aggregation platform. Under the terms of that deal, the provider agreed to supply its products, helping grow REEVO’s extensive library of games even further. While the deal provided a boost for REEVO’s offering, it will also help Hacksaw engage with new clients across the globe.</p>
<p>Back in August, Hacksaw expanded further its global footprint by inking a partnership with N1 Casino in Greece. At the time, the leading provider of iGaming content agreed to roll out a plethora of its games, powering the Greek operator’s online platform.</p>
