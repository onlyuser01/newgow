    <h1>Madison Ho Chunk Casino Skagit Casino Hotel Goldies Casino Circus Circus Las Vegas Hotel And Casino</h1>

<p>1×2 Network has appointed Kevin Reid as its new CEO. Reid will be replacing Sean St. John, who has spent the past two decades in the prestigious position, helping it grow from a small but incredibly ambitious gaming studio into a premier gaming content provider with its own subsidiaries and an award-winning portfolio.</p>
<p>Sean St. John Will Keep Assisting the Group in Its Expansion</p>
<p>St. John is an iconic figure for the prestigious casino games supplier. He laid the first bricks at its foundation in 2002 and saw it grow from a frail studio into a full-blown content developer and aggregator for online casinos. As part of his former duties as a CEO, St. John helped oversee all product and technical crews over the years. His new responsibility will be to oversee all aspects of content innovation and development as part of his new product role in the company.</p>
<p>St. John expressed his “honor” to have served as 1X2 Network’s CEO for the past two decades, continuously pursuing the best strategies for making engaging games that would keep players entertained while sharing their content with operators in all worldwide regulated markets. While his strategies proved their success over the years, St. John considered it was time for him to give up his position.</p>
<p>However, he stated he will continue to look forward to the future of the group while asserting the 1×2 Network will still be in “great hands” with Reid taking over the steering wheel. St. John is now eager to bring his support to the group’s bold plans of expansion while feeling confident about the quality of the current team that will keep the flame of progress burning.</p>
<p>Kevin Reid Will Also Oversee the Iron Dog Studios and 1x2gaming Subsidiaries</p>
<p>Reid joined 1×2 Network in 2012 when he was appointed as the commercial strategy leader of the company. The new strategic move will have Reid take over the group’s management and two of its subsidiaries, Iron Dog Studios, and 1X2gaming. Reid has already expressed his opinion that, despite the group’s incredible success over the years and their fruitful PokerStars partnership, there is still plenty of room for growth.</p>
<p>Another important chore he will undertake will be that of leading the group’s penetration into new regulated markets throughout the year 2022, continuing their efforts in the past years. Last January, the group entered Canada by signing a partnership with state lottery operator Loto-Québec. Reid acknowledged St. John’s “incredible contribution” to the growth of the company and its transformation into the leading casino content provider and aggregator in the industry. He also expressed his belief that 1×2 Network should take advantage of its strong momentum will propel itself into the next chapter of its success story.</p>
