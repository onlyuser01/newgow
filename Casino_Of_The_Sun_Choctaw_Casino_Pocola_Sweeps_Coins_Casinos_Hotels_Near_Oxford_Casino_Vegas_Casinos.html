<p>Nevada’s revenue falls for forth consecutive month</p>
<p>Baccarat is the only table game to go up</p>
<p>Noth and South Lake Tahoe post the heaviest reduction</p>
<p>Nevada’s gaming revenue fell in April for a forth consecutive month, down 1.8 percent, the Gaming Control Board reported on Wednesday, May 29.</p>
<p>Nevada’s Gaming Revenue Takes Another Tumble</p>
<p>Releasing new data, Nevada’s Gaming Control Board cited another reduction of gaming revenue for April. This has been the forth consecutive month in 2019 that gaming revenue took a hit in Nevada. The total amount won by casinos from players amounted to $936.5 million, or down 1.8 percent.</p>
<p>Major gaming hubs posted declining revenue, including Clark County with 2 percent lower at $808.6 million and the Strip’s revenue taking a more pronounced 3.5 percent tumble to $481.9 million. Conversely, Las Vegas managed to grow its revenue, adding 2.1 percent increase or $61.8 million.</p>
<p>Not all properties posted declining revenue, with Mesquite seeing a good month in April, and revenue going up 4 percent to $12.2 million. However, other properties reported even more serious decline in their overall revenue performance for the month.</p>
<p>Lake Tahoe saw as much as 12.5 percent slip in terms of gaming revenue whereas North Lake registered the even more significant 16.1 percent.</p>
<p>As Games Decline, Sports Betting Rises</p>
<p>Insofar as different verticals were concerned, table games sunk to double-digit reduction over the period. It all came at the expense of sports betting which has been raking up a solid 32.7 percent increase in overall volume. With sports betting in good stead, casino revenue has flat-lined.</p>
<p>So far as table games go, baccarat made an interesting comeback in April, posting $66.8 million in total revenue, or a 2.5 percent increase year-over-year. Card games were dealt a tougher hand in April, though, and their revenue took a step off a 5.8-percent-cliff.</p>
<p>Roulette, blackjack and craps all posted declines with blackjack falling by -11.1 percent and roulette bearing the brunt for a -23.5 percent decline. Poker did post a mild uptick of 4% or $8.6 million, but this is to be expected with the World Series of Poker (WSOP) drawing near.</p>
<p>Year over year, the fiscal results are the same, although a continuation of the downward trend would put 2018/2019 in a decline. Meanwhile, North Lake Tahoe, South Lake Tahoe and the Strip continue to post marked decline with their overall year-over-year results going under by 1.58 percent.</p>
<p>While casino properties registered fewer conferences, occupancy rates continued to keep steady at 91 percent of capacity. A slight increase in visitors numbers has also been registered.</p>
