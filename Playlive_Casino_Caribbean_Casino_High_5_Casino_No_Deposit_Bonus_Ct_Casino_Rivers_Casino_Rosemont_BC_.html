    <h1>Playlive Casino Caribbean Casino High 5 Casino No Deposit Bonus Ct Casino Rivers Casino Rosemont BC</h1>

<p>Hello! I am a recent player at BC GAME casino. I came in on the recommendation of a streamer who promised quick withdrawals and no KYC for playing. Today I faced an issue: my friend had explained this whole world to me, as I had no previous experience with casinos. I wanted to clarify if it was legal for him to participate in games being only 17 years old. The operators interpreted this question as if I asked it personally, and they blocked my plus account with my winnings.</p>
<p>The operators requested me to write a letter to their email. After sending it and replying to the first letter, no more than three minutes had passed. The relevant material is attached in the media.</p>
<p>As they claim, I am underage. However, upon my argument that I had turned 18 and am ready for verification, they stopped responding to my emails. The support team simply started excluding me from the conversation, and that was the end of it.</p>
<p>When I tried to log in to verify my identity, nothing happens. I initially registered through WalletConnect.</p>
<p>The money I deposited was transferred via an exchange (Bybit), where I registered, providing my documents. I will also attach this material along with the deposit information.</p>
<p>At present, I'll resend the email, attaching all the necessary information and my documents. You may also take a look at the attached tab.</p>
<p>I request you to resolve this situation. The money involved is extremely important to me and I thank you for your understanding.</p>
<p>I have written them from two email addresses - the first one at the time of the block, after receiving a standard message they stopped replying. I wrote from a second email, the result was the same - they are not being cooperative, they do not allow me to go through verification. I've attached tabs with a letter where I wanted to go through verification. They are giving me no chance to verify.</p>
