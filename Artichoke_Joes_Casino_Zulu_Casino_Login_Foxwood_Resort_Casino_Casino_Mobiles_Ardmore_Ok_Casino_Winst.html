    <h1>Artichoke Joes Casino Zulu Casino Login Foxwood Resort Casino Casino Mobiles Ardmore Ok Casino Winst</h1>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I took a 100% match bonus from this casino that was offered to me via email. I made a deposit of $45 and ended up winning $1407. I successfully completed the wagering requirements and tried to withdrawal but it was rejected. They said the bonus comes with a max win limit of 5x deposit so I'm only allowed to withdrawal $226. Nowhere in the email does it tell you there is a max win limit. I always read the bonus terms and conditions before taking a bonus and I did not find this term anywhere in their T&amp;C. If I had been properly informed of this term I would have never taken their bonus. I am well aware of this 5x deposit max win that some casino imposes on their bonuses and I always stay away from them.</p>
<p>Do I have a case here if they this max win term have not been clearly stated in either their T&amp;C or their marketing material?</p>
<p>For your reference. I've attached a screenshot of the email I received with the bonus offer. Also a copy of their bonus T&amp;C extracted from their website. I can't find this 5x max win limit anywhere in this email or their website. If it does exist, then it's very well hidden.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Ninja8</p>
