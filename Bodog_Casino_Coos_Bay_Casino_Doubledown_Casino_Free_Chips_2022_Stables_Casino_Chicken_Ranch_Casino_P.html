    <h1>Bodog Casino Coos Bay Casino Doubledown Casino Free Chips 2022 Stables Casino Chicken Ranch Casino P</h1>

<p>I initiated a withdrawal on the 28th of October, 2023, making 3 separate withdrawal requests on the 28th of October, 31st of October, and 1st of November of 400 PEN each. However, only two withdrawals were processed and completed. I raised this issue through email, but was informed that there were internal issues that they were dealing with. Then upon requesting a new withdrawal on the 2nd of November, my withdrawal requests were rejected, and any subsequent request has been denied. They don't allow me to withdraw my money, even though I have verified my account in full. I can't believe that they would treat me like this. I'm currently in dispute over 2066.02 PEN because they won't let me make any withdrawals. I have all the evidence in the form of emails and the bank's response stating that the withdrawals I'm claiming have not arrived.</p>
<p>I never thought I could get hurt like this. They continue to string me along, telling me that they don't know when this issue can be resolved. The problem can go on for one, maybe two years, and they may continue to hold onto my money, never allowing me to withdraw. This is utterly cruel. I trusted them and they're causing me harm. I spend every day contemplating how I'm going to withdraw the money I deposited and won in game prizes. I haven't participated in any bonuses.</p>
<p>Please help me, they're not letting me withdraw anything, and yet they keep on saying they do not know when they are going to resolve my issue. Parimatch's support team doesn't appear to have my or my family's best interest in mind.</p>
<p>Please, I need your help. They're attempting to keep my money, which isn't fair. I trusted them and now they're making a mockery of me. Please, I need your help, I need assistance.</p>
<p>Parimatch's Support is mocking me. They keep saying they have problems, and they seem to want to keep my money. This isn't right.</p>
<p>I send emails on a regular basis but they're not helping. I've been having these issues since the 28th of October. I heed their requests and wait, only for the issue to persist. I can't withdraw a single penny.</p>
