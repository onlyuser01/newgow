<p>Collect Candy to Win Prizes</p>
<p>The new game is a part of the Candyways Bonanza franchise and builds on the success of its two predecessors.</p>
<p>The game’s sweetness calls for a dentist appointment as players will collect a variety of candy-themed symbols to win. The six-reel slot will see players take advantage paylines that provide them with a whopping 117,649 ways to win on every spin.</p>
<p>In addition, the game uses a cascading reels mechanic that removes winning symbols from the grid, adding extra symbols in their place. This provides additional chances to win, allowing players to score multiple wins with a single spin.</p>
<p>The game features an additional reel above the grid that provides extra ways to score winning combinations. In addition, the reel can land on highlighted symbols that will turn matching symbols below into wild symbols.</p>
<p>Enter the Bonus Round to Win More</p>
<p>In addition, players can collect scatter symbols to trigger the bonus round. To do so, they need to land 4, 5 or 6 of these symbols, earning 10, 12 or 14 free spins, respectively. Players can activate the Super Stake feature to increase their wager and boost their chances to trigger the bonus round.</p>
<p>If players get 4 or more scatters during the bonus round, they will earn extra free spins, extending the round. Those who are too impatient can directly buy free spins in markets where this is allowed.</p>
<p>In addition to that, during the bonus round players can land on candy bear symbols that will trigger various multipliers, ranging from 2x to 15x. A larger mystery multiplier candy bear symbol, meanwhile, can reveal a multiplier of between 18x and 100x.</p>
<p>Finally, players can land on an Epic candy bear symbol that will reveal a value between 2x and 5x that will be applied to the total multiplier already collected.</p>
<p>A Great Addition to the Stakelogic Lineup</p>
<p>The game has great graphics and follows the themes of its two predecessors. The varied symbols will appeal to all players who prefer colorful and flashy slots.</p>
<p>Andrew Fraser, product owner at Stakelogic, said that his team is glad to return to the Candyways Bonanza series. He noted that the first two games proved to be very popular, which is why he cannot wait to see how players react to the new game.</p>
<p>With additional bonus features and the chance to win up to 20,000x your stake, we are confident that this is the series’ best offering yet. Andrew Fraser, product owner, Stakelogic</p>
<p>In other news, Stakelogic just expanded in Portugal through an agreement with Betclic.</p>
