<p>3 Oaks Gaming, a distributor of iGaming content, is stepping up its pace of expansion across Europe with the company now releasing its products on the Italian market in a ground-breaking move for the company. 3 Oaks Gaming is now able to deploy its extensive portfolio of slot games and state-of-the-art gamification tools with local operators and bring them some of the best and most worthwhile offers.</p>
<p>3 Oaks Gaming Goes Big in Italy with Fresh Content</p>
<p>This follows up on the company’s Isle of Man’s license obtained by the supplier earlier this year. 3 Oaks Gaming has been steadily advancing its products, bringing a more relevant and top-shelf product to companies such as SoftSwiss, iSoftBet, and Parimatch.</p>
<p>3 Oaks Gaming managing director Sebastian Damian welcomed the opportunity and said: “Adding Italy to our roster of certified countries is a clear signifier of our ambition for expansion into regulated European markets.</p>
<p>Damian was pleased with the progress the company has made. Since launching in January 2023, the supplier has been able to obtain a number of important licenses and considerably expand its footprint in Europe and well beyond.</p>
<p>“The quality of our product offering speaks for itself, and we are confident it will bring a new level of value to the Italian market,” the managing director concluded confidently that the future for the supplier will only become brighter.</p>
<p>Multiple Content Deals and Market Entries in Europe</p>
<p>3 Oaks has been on a rapid expansion over the past months. The company managed to sign a contested deal with Slots City. There has been a clear Eastern Europe pivot in much of the expansion that happened in recent weeks. 3 Oaks Gaming secured entry into the Bulgarian market after obtaining a license from the National Revenue Agency.</p>
<p>Earlier in October, the company introduced a new integration-free jackpot product. The company also secured Big Time Gaming Megaways feature licensing back in May this year. All in all, 3 Oaks Gaming has been a tremendous job of consistently expanding its reach in new geographies and building on impressive momentum.</p>
