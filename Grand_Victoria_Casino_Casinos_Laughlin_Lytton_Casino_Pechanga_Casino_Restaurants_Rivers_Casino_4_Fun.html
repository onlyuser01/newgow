<p>Canadian sports betting operator NorthStar Gaming has signed an agreement with the National Basketball Association (NBA) and is being listed as an Authorized Gaming Operator by the league.</p>
<p>Canada’s NorthStar Gaming Becomes One of NBA’s Authorized Gaming Operators</p>
<p>NorthStar Gaming is partnering with NBA in a new agreement that will see the Ontario-based sports betting operator offer live NBA data to its customers.</p>
<p>The NBA logo will be included in NorthStar Gaming’s platform and Canadian bettors will be able to enjoy an alluring sports wagering experience.</p>
<p>The collaboration will also ensure that the integrity of all NBA matches is being protected with the implementation of professional integrity standards.</p>
<p>Michael Moskowitz, CEO of NorthStar Gaming has elaborated on what players can expect: “As an Authorized Gaming Operator, NorthStar Gaming will connect our players with official data and stats from the NBA and provide them with an insights-packed user experience. We’re excited to offer current and future NorthStar Bets players with an authentic NBA experience on our platform.“</p>
<p>The collaboration with NBA is one more step in NorthStar Gaming’s expansion of its odds offerings through partnerships with major sports leagues.</p>
<p>NorthStar Gaming Has Been on a Growth Path Since the Start of 2022</p>
<p>At the beginning of July, NorthStar Gaming proceeded with an agreement with Baden Resources for a reverse takeover. NorthStar Gaming is going through a merger with one of Baden Resources’ subsidiaries in order to become a publicly listed company.</p>
<p>Before the merger plans were announced the company stepped in on the recently launched iGaming market in Ontario with its brand NorthStar Bets.</p>
<p>The brand, which is Canadian-owned, builds upon NorthStar Gaming’s local tradition and Ontario roots and offers localized sports betting and casino products. NorthStar Bets offers an exquisite betting experience catered to the specific needs of Ontario residents.</p>
<p>The NorthStar Bets platform is being facilitated by a partnership with Playtech, which has provided it with casino services and its IMS platform.</p>
<p>In recent months, NorthStar Gaming lined up a few new partnerships in order to expand its product offering and improve the gaming experience for its customers.</p>
<p>Just a few days ago the company announced a collaboration with iGaming games supplier Pragmatic Play. Under the new agreement, NorthStar Bets will start offering Pragmatic Play games such as Sugar Rush, Big Bass Splash, and Gates of Olympus. In September, NorthStar Gaming also signed an agreement with Genius Sports, which provides live data and pre-match services to the company’s NorthStar Bets brand. As a result, NorthStar Bets will benefit from Genius Sports’ rights agreements with major world sports leagues such as Premier League, NCAA, NFL, and NASCAR.</p>
