<p>Inversely, the casino is more likely to get new deposits and a lot more wagers than they otherwise have gotten. It is the difference between representing a $150,000 prize as being worth $150,000 compared to a $150,000 bonus worth maybe $50,000. There's a reason that legitimate casinos keep a section tracking everything involving bonuses and a reason they put an expiration date on noncashable bonuses.</p>
<p>7/19 TIV responds:</p>
<p>We are not obligated to pay you $ 1000 a week. Our commitment is to allow you to set aside $ 1000 a week (in pending). There's a significant difference.</p>
<p>In an effort to be fair, we increased your limit to allow you to set aside (in pending) $ 10,000 in one go, instead of $ 1,000 a week. You chose not to take advantage of this, which is entirely your decision.</p>
<p>According to your own statements, you stopped playing because you found our promotions uninteresting (despite some being modified at your request), and because we do not offer the games you prefer. let's at least be honest.</p>
<p>If you wish to make this matter public, we have no issue with that.</p>
<p>You have received a substantial amount of money from us, often under conditions that were specially adjusted for you. No one compelled us to do this, and therefore, no one can obligate us to continue offering you these conditions.</p>
<p>We manage a large operation with many customers, none of whom have raised complaints about our payment ethics, our games, our promotions, or claimed inactivity due to non-payment. and all at the same time. and all, all of a sudden. Regrettably, these issues seem to be unique to your experience.</p>
<p>-I have attached 3 screenshots of complaints about TIV and its skins from Casinomeister from just this year alone. Two of these cases have already been closed with Casinomeister issuing warnings as a result for TIV ignoring the player complaints. The 3rd is still pending but TIV has yet to reply.</p>
<p>-If you go to https://www.casinofreak.com/ there are a notable number of black medals that players have posted against the TIV group.</p>
<p>-sistersitesindex.com labels TIV as a "rather small casino". Does this sound consistent with the fact that TIV offers literally the biggest casino tournaments and raffles on the internet and yet have one of the smallest guaranteed payout schedules.</p>
<p>-Outside of complaints, I could not even find ThisIsVegas on Casinomeister (no reviews) except basically for some old forum postings referencing them being in and out of the "rogue pit" from about 12 years ago.</p>
<p>-The player feedback I saw on TIV and its skins strongly represented low stakes players and very little if anything on TIV's massive raffles/tourneys.</p>
<p>9/11 Me:</p>
<p>I have been paid only $3000 since 5/30/2023 despite the fact that I have had $1000 payout requests pending that entire time. I have given you plenty of action the last 7 weeks as well on average over the past year. I stopped playing for a while for some tough love. That obviously didn't work. This needs to be a lot better.</p>
<p>9/12 TIV:</p>
<p>We would like to remind you, however, that our actions are in strict compliance with the Terms and Conditions that were agreed upon at the time of your account creation.</p>
<p>...The alternative approach would be adhering strictly to the Terms and Conditions, consequently revoking any promotional prizes you have accumulated, guided by the same principles that govern CashBack rewards.</p>
<p>9/12 Me:</p>
<p>So that we understand each other, there is only one language I am paying attention to at this point and that I have been paying attention to for some time. For your benefit, I would suggest saying only things that would survive scrutiny. I don't mind playing, but you need to start paying or I will switch the carrot to the stick.</p>
<p>9/13 TIV:</p>
<p>...sorry, in your case, we are not supposed to follow them (the T&amp;C), but we chose to pay you, albeit at our rate, but it is better than deleting all the CASH BACK from your account, right? So before you switch the carrot with the stick, we suggest that you read the T&amp;C again, and if something is not clear, we are here for any question.</p>
<p>9/13 Me:</p>
<p>You need to establish what your payout rate will be in the next response. If in word or action the response is inadequate, you better hope your rules do validate your position. I don't think they will.</p>
<p>9/14 TIV:</p>
<p>Currently, we are processing payments to you, despite not being required to do so according to our established terms and conditions. Consequently, the pace of these disbursements will be dictated by our discretion.</p>
<p>We want to emphasize, as previously communicated in our past correspondences, that we are willing to adhere to the Terms &amp; Conditions that were agreed upon at the time of your account creation. Adhering to these terms would entail the forfeit of all the cashback (CB) you have accrued.</p>
