    <h1>Largest Casino In America Phoenix Casino Chumba Casino Payout Reviews Filmen Casino Brango Casino 10</h1>

<p>One of the world’s biggest sports digital media companies is going to shift its iconic headquarters and move office later this year</p>
<p>Better Collective, which is currently headquartered in the Toldbodgade buildings in Copenhagen, will be shifting its headquarters to the Skt Annae Plads in the Danish capital city. The new headquarters is reflective of the company’s evolution and expansion over the past years, with the building soaring five-story high and featuring more than 6,000 square meters of space.</p>
<p>Better Collective Ready to Move Into a New Office</p>
<p>The new hub will be used by people from all over Europe, overseas team members, to conduct meetings, and executives. The company is due to make the move to its new offices by August. Better Collective co-founder &amp; COO Christian Kirk Rasmussen has welcomed:</p>
<p>Moving into our new HQ is an important part of our journey to become the leading digital sports media group. The move reflects and is the result of the collective efforts, dedication, and hard work of our entire team, across all departments and locations. Better Collective co-founder &amp; COO Christian Kirk Rasmussen</p>
<p>Rasmussen has hailed the event as a significant milestone and said that the Better Collective team, and each member, have been instrumental in making this happen. The move to the new headquartered continues Better Collective’s mission to improve the company’s overall model and the goals it sets itself to achieve.</p>
<p>The new venue will be equipped with everything that team members at Better Collective may need, such as a gym, meeting spaces, a green room, a lounge area, eating spaces, and more.</p>
<p>Better Collective Continues to Pick Up Pace</p>
<p>Better Collective has been fast-expanding globally, with the company putting a very solid focus on its operations in North America, where the market has been undergoing a massive overhaul.</p>
<p>Better Collective also agreed to buy out Playmaker HQ, a social media specialist, which will significantly strengthen the former’s sports betting content in the digital space. The deal is said to cost $54 million with Better Collective agreeing to pay $15 million upfront.</p>
