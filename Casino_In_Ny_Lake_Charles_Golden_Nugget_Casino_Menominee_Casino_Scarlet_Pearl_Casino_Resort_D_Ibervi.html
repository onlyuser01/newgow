    <h1>Casino In Ny Lake Charles Golden Nugget Casino Menominee Casino Scarlet Pearl Casino Resort D Ibervi</h1>

<p>Popular gaming operator in Mexico Caliente.mx has chosen to expand its long and fruitful partnership with FBM, the global gaming brand that defines itself as “proud, champion and responsible.” Caliente.mx will be making FBMDS’ games available to its players with the help of several weekly game launches on the platform. Players can expect to benefit from fully customized, localized, and highly innovative options.</p>
<p>FBMDS and Caliente.mx: the Journey Continues</p>
<p>The two brands have partnered for a number of important deals regarding brick-and-mortar operations over the years. The latest decision will carry their partnership into the digital realm. It will be used by FBM as a means of strengthening its foothold as a critical player in the iGaming market in Latin America. At the same time, thanks to the addition of FBMDS’ games to the Mexican online casino, players will get the chance to carry their play sessions straight into their preferred FBM titles, from land casinos to the online world.</p>
<p>FBM Digital Systems’ chief executive officer Roberto Regianini described the new agreement as “a massive step for FBMDS.” At the same time, Caliente.mx’s head of gaming Nimrod Dvir spoke about the popularity of FBMDS’ video bingo and slot games in land casinos in Mexico. He explained the operator will be adding FBM’s most popular games to its current offer, including special and exclusive promotions for players eager to try them out.</p>
<p>60 Games and Counting</p>
<p>FBMDS currently has more than 60 casino games ready to be explored by online players in Mexico, all expected to generate new thrills. The two companies have agreed on a strategic plan that will allow them to keep launching five new games on a weekly basis. At the moment, FBMDS’ slots count has reached 15 on Caliente.mx’s platform. The list includes hit games like the Mythic Link packs and FBM Easy$Money Link. Soon to follow are a series of popular video bingo games preferred by many Mexican casino players and sports aficionados online.</p>
<p>The new deal is meant to further prove the quality of FBM’s high-class products, trustful partnerships, and commitment to constantly take players and operators by surprise with fresh solutions.</p>
<p>At the moment, FBM’s games are present in 700 rooms worldwide, with 40 000 installed machines and counting. The company continues to remain committed to building “emotions through joyful moments” for its customers, reflecting their way of doing things at an internal level.</p>
<p>In 2020, Caliente.mx 2021 was the owner of approximately 200 off-track betting and bookmaking outlets worldwide. The company Grupo Caliente was launched in 1916. Last January, Grupo Caliente and Genius Sports signed a streaming and live data agreement. This February, FBMDS and EveryMatrix agreed to a strategic content deal.</p>
