<p>Oddin.gg, an established provider of esports software, data, and odds, has teamed up with SB22 and will collaborate with the company, which is an up-and-coming technological solution provider operating in the North American region, to advance the esports vertical.</p>
<p>SB22 to Benefit from Oddin’s Esports Expertise</p>
<p>Oddin.gg is known for the provision of distinct products, such as esports feeds and its iFrame solution, boosting engagement with esports fans and offering a comprehensive and disruptive solution for betting agencies that wish to join the competitive video gaming vertical.</p>
<p>Moving forward, SB22 will be able to deliver on its own in-house tools along with the additional technical expertise on esports as assisted by Oddin. SB22 COO Vladimir Jovanovic has acknowledged the prowess of Oddin.gg as a company that creates and delivers on industry-leading esports solutions. He added:</p>
<p>Our selection process was especially rigorous, as SB22 is a company full of gamers ourselves. For this reason, we are more than pleased to say that Oddin.gg, thanks to its extensive esports markets coverage and truly engaging esports offering, covers everything we were looking for and much more. SB22 COO Vladimir Jovanovic</p>
<p>The partnership is important to Jovanovic and his company as SB22 will be able to gain an important foothold in the highly-dynamic esports vertical which is undergoing some significant changes and is attracting sufficient interest from big names in the sector.</p>
<p>Better Collective recently acquired Futbin in a massive $113-million deal. Entain is preparing to relaunch Unikrn, a leading esports betting platform that will introduce a new brand identity and features. Jovanovic is confident that Oddin.gg’s expertise will prove useful in enabling SB22 to build its own unique proposition.</p>
<p>SB22 and Oddin Ready to Tackle Challenges Together</p>
<p>SB22 will also implement the iFrame solution which will give its partners a better grasp of both sports betting products but also seemingly integrate esports betting options. Oddin.gg managing director and co-founder Marek Suchar commented on the new opportunity and welcomed SB22 to the family of company partnerships.</p>
<p>He described SB22 as a “future-ready company” that is built to add more value to the sports betting experience. SB22’s focus, Suchar said, was on the future and evolution of the industry. Suchar is also confident that SB2 and Oddin.gg will embark on mutual challenges together.</p>
<p>Oddin.gg’s expertise in the esports betting vertical has been continuously sought by established companies. SIS and Oddin teamed up to provide 24/7 live betting options on Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Yolo Group, formerly known as Coingaming Group, also sought closer ties with Oddin.gg seeking to bolster its own esports offering.</p>
