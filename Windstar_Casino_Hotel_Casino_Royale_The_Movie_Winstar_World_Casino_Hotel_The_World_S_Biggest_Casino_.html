    <h1>Windstar Casino Hotel Casino Royale The Movie Winstar World Casino Hotel The World S Biggest Casino</h1>

<p>Strive Gaming has tapped the talent of Haig Sakouyan as the company’s new vice president of client success. Sakouyan has close to 19 years in the gambling industry, spanning both casino and sportsbook assets. He has collaborated with 18 industry brands and specifically helped with the launch of each.</p>
<p>Experienced Veteran with a Lot to Offer</p>
<p>He will now leverage his expertise and understanding of the industry and put it forward to strengthen relationships between consumers and Strive Gaming. The platform is a B2B free-to-play and real-money iGaming supplier which has been expanding its footprint across North America.</p>
<p>Sakouyan’s expertise will be invaluable to the team as he has worked with the likes of Bally’s Interactive, where he was tasked with the position of VP of B2B. As part of his duties, he worked with theScore and Rushmore Gaming and also helped BallyBet Sportsbook’s launch, giving the brands a strong foothold in the highly competitive iGaming market.</p>
<p>Sakouyan also worked with Rush Street Interactive and BlueBat Games. He has now found his latest venture as part of the Strive Gaming team. Company chief executive Max Meltzer has welcomed Sakouyan, praising him for his extensive expertise in the sector.</p>
<p>“Sakouyan joins Strive Gaming at a time when there is incredible momentum behind the business with licenses already secured in Arizona and Colorado and with applications in progress in other states, and I look forward to working closely with him as we move towards going live with our first partners.”</p>
<p>Growth in Both Canada and the US</p>
<p>With Strive Gaming having ties to both the United States and Canada, the company is going to focus on scaling its product offering and roll out throughout as many regulated jurisdictions as it can. Ideally, that is all regulated markets in North America.</p>
<p>Strive Gaming already holds a license from the Colorado Limited Gaming Control Commission, awarded last September. Sakouyan will now work from the company’s Canadian office in Vancouver. Commenting on his appointment, the seasoned gaming veteran said that Strive Gaming has embarked on an ambitious plan to conquer both the US and Canadian markets.</p>
<p>“I am thrilled to join such an incredible team and to be able to use my years of experience to help Strive Gaming’s operator partners leverage the full power and potential of its cutting-edge platform,” Sakouyan concluded.</p>
