    <h1>J7Bet Casino Red Wing Casino Casino In South Dakota Laughlin Hotels And Casinos Nyny Casino Videoslo</h1>

<p>The latest partnership builds upon the positive momentum gained between the two companies after the launch of Videoslots' 10,000th game this summer</p>
<p>The leading online gambling operator, Videoslots, announced a new content partnership with RAW iGaming, the award-winning provider of games for the iGaming vertical. Announced Thursday, the new deal will see the operator introduce popular games from RAW iGaming, powering its operations in Ontario, Canada. Per the latest deal, Videoslots will bolster its offering, delivering thrilling experiences for customers in the province.</p>
<p>Currently, Videoslots already has a strong presence across Europe. Earlier this year, in June, the operator entered the gambling market in Ontario. More recently, Videoslots has gone live with its first TV campaign for the region, seeking to propel its presence.</p>
<p>Customers in Ontario are already familiar with some of the most successful games from RAW iGaming. Such include Rise of Shinobi, Ave Caesar DynamicWays and Big Money Bass, among others that are already popular among online players.</p>
<p>As a leading global iGaming operator, Videoslots constantly grows its offering. This summer, the company announced that its platform offers 10,000 titles, after launching RAW iGaming’s Raging Super2Ways. That achievement undoubtedly had a positive impact and helped pave the way toward the latest announcement.</p>
<p>The Partnership Brings Excitement to the Duo</p>
<p>Tom Wood, RAW iGaming’s CEO, praised the strong presence Videoslots has within the global gambling sector. He explained that it is incredibly important for the company to join forces with such an award-winning and trusted operator. Finally, Wood said: “Our portfolio continues to expand across Ontario and the launch with Videoslots will undoubtedly boost the outreach of our titles.”</p>
<p>“Videoslots are an award-winning operator and who better to partner with than the biggest operator globally.“ Tom Wood, CEO at RAW iGaming</p>
<p>Ulle Skottling, Videoslots’ deputy CEO, shared the excitement of RAW iGaming’s boss. He explained that it is thrilling to join forces with an award-winning iGaming provider for the market in Ontario. Moreover, Skottling said that Videoslots anticipates further growth and expansion to a leadership position in the region. “RAW iGaming launched our 10,000th title and we are delighted that our relationship with them will continue to grow within Canada,” he explained in conclusion.</p>
<p>“To partner with one of Ontario’s leading iGaming providers is fantastic for Videoslots as we look to become market leaders in terms of our choice of games.“ Ulle Skottling, deputy CEO at Videoslots</p>
<p>Last month, Videoslots announced a landmark partnership by teaming up with Delasport, a leading iGaming supplier. That collaboration saw the leading operator strengthen its offering with the integration of API for different sports.</p>
