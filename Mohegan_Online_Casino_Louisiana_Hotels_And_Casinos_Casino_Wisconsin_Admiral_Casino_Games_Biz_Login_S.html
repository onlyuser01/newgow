<p>EQL Games will be able to reach new customers around North America thanks to the new partnership</p>
<p>The leading North American aggregator and NeoGames subsidiary, Pariplay, unveiled Monday details regarding a new partnership with the fast-growing iLottery provider based in Louisville, Kentucky, EQL Games. Under the terms of the freshly minted partnership, EQL Games was designated as one of Pariplay’s Fusion platform partners. This deal will help extend the platform’s offering by bringing a bespoke portfolio of games from the iLottery provider.</p>
<p>Thanks to the new collaboration, EQL Games will have the ability to reach new clients, as well as audiences around North America. As a Fusion partner, the company’s range of titles will be integrated into the platform, providing a significant boost to its coverage.</p>
<p>The latest deal helps grow further Pariplay’s Fusion offering. By now, the platform offers more than 14,000 games from 120 different suppliers. In addition, Fusion brings engaging features and tools that are proven to boost player retention, conversion and enhance player value.</p>
<p>Besides expanding the reach of EQL Games’ content, the partnership complements Pariplay’s goal of becoming a go-to supplier for iLottery technology and solutions for North American markets. The company has previously established deals with leading organizations within the lottery vertical, including the Atlantic Lottery (ALC) in Atlantic Canada, Ontario’s AGCO, Alberta’s AGLC, as well as the West Virginia Lottery.</p>
<p>The latest deal with EQL Games comes on the heels of another collaboration announced by Pariplay recently. Last month, the company confirmed that it joined forces with Slotmill. Under the terms of that deal, the operator has gone live in the UK as Pariplay’s Ignite partner.</p>
<p>Earlier in June, Pariplay expanded its team of experts by hiring Irina Roman. Joining the company, she was appointed to the role of head of account management.</p>
<p>EQL Games, Pariplay, Excited to Team Up</p>
<p>Brad Cummings, EQL Games’ CEO, shared his excitement about the deal with Pariplay. “Our goal is to deliver lottery content that is novel, engaging, and profitable for lottery operators while making it available to as wide an audience as possible,” he said.</p>
<p>Cummings acknowledged that Pariplay has a significant market presence. Finally, he said that the collaboration with the company represents a milestone moment for EQL Games which will significantly expand its reach within the iLottery vertical.</p>
<p>“We are always seeking to enhance our portfolio of games with fresh, high-quality content. EQL Games fits the bill perfectly with its compelling collection of iLottery instant win products that we are sure will be a hit with players.“ Shivan Patel, VP North America at Pariplay</p>
<p>Shivan Patel, Pariplay’s VP North America, added that the company has seen significant growth in its Fusion platform around North America in the last few years. He pointed out that an ongoing goal for Pariplay is to deliver engaging and unique games. Finally, Patel said that the partnership with EQL Games complements this goal and predicted that their games will deliver thrilling experiences for lottery players.</p>
