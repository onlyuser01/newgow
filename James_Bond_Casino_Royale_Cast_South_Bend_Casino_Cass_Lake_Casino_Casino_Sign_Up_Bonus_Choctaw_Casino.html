    <h1>James Bond Casino Royale Cast South Bend Casino Cass Lake Casino Casino Sign Up Bonus Choctaw Casino</h1>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>When the withdrawal was made I noticed shortly afterwards that it had been returned to a closed bank account, which I found surprisingly as I hadn't made a withdrawal from this account since the beginning of the year as I closed the account in March. As soon as I noticed I emailed to make you aware because at the moment you can't reverse withdrawals but customer services didn't want to help me with the matter. I told my bank who informed it would be fine because once the funds hit them they are automatically returned because the account is closed and I have been pretty much back and forth ever since. The account is verified because I have been using and have made successful withdrawals in the past, the account has been open over 5 years. This is correct I have not received the funds and I am still waiting. I have been emailing back and forth for almost 3 week, I have spoken to my old bank endless who have been great and finding all the details and sending them to you but still your customer services refuse to take the information provided to them. I would like to get this resolved as soon as possible. I am now at the point I had emailed your transaction team on 9th September and called on Tuesday in which it was confirmed you had received the email but I have had no reply and it was refused to be dealt with over the phone.</p>
<p>Kind Regards,</p>
<p>Danielle</p>
