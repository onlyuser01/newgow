<p>GeoComply Donates $200,000 to Conscious Gaming</p>
<p>The global leader in geolocation and compliance technology, GeoComply announced that it made a $200,000 donation to Conscious Gaming. Announced on Thursday this week, the donation aims at boosting the development of Conscious Gaming’s self-exclusion tool PlayPause. Furthermore, the donation will also help the non-profit organization overcome future responsible gaming challenges that it may face in the growing U.S. market.</p>
<p>Established by GeoComply, the non-profit philanthropic organization Conscious Gaming aims at aligning the responsible gaming needs of all stakeholders by creating a standardized baseline that is shared nationally. GeoComply’s donation will help Conscious Gaming accelerate the deployment of the industry’s first national self-exclusion tool PlayPause.</p>
<p>Today, we are thrilled to announce a $200,000 donation to @ConsciousGam, a non-profit dedicated to tackling the challenges of responsible gaming through the deployment of an innovative self-exclusion tool, PlayPause. More: https://t.co/wz10F4YGEz — GeoComply (@GeoComply) January 14, 2021</p>
<p>“We have been very fortunate at GeoComply to have a front seat to the growth of the iGaming industry across the United States over the past decade.” Anna Sainsbury, GeoComply Chairman and Co-Founder</p>
<p>In a statement, Anna Sainsbury, GeoComply Chairman and Co-Founder acknowledged that the company was very fortunate to have had a “front seat to the growth of the iGaming industry across the United States over the past decade“. Furthermore, she added that the industry’s growth brings challenges and GeoComply is proud to be able to allocate funds to Conscious Gaming which will boost responsible gaming and a safe environment for players.</p>
<p>Interest in PlayPause Is Tremendous</p>
<p>According to Seth Palansky, Vice President of Corporate Social Responsibility and Communications at Conscious Gaming, the interest in PlayPause from both regulators and operators has been tremendous. Furthermore, he added that GeoComply’s donation will help the non-profit organization scale up efforts and “help drive the adoption of PlayPause throughout the U.S. iGaming industry in 2021“.</p>
<p>“The interest and momentum for PlayPause from operators and regulators since the launch has been tremendous.” Seth Palansky, Vice President of Corporate Social Responsibility and Communications at Conscious Gaming.</p>
<p>The PlayPause solution offers unique protection for the players. The first-of-its-kind solution allows players that have self-excluded to transfer their exclusion when they move from state to state. Furthermore, users can choose to self-exclude across multiple states which prevents them from going to a neighboring state to continue gambling.</p>
<p>The national gambling self-exclusion solution is already well-received and operators such as Entain and BetMGM have already committed to its use. Furthermore, the state regulator in Pennsylvania was the first regulator to deploy the solution.</p>
