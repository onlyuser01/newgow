    <h1>Casinos Near Phoenix Az Sunset Casino Casino Com Sycuan Casino Casino Niagara Falls Usa Vulkan Vegas</h1>

<p>Good day.</p>
<p>I finally won €600 after several deposits.</p>
<p>now the fuss is making because my partner also has an account with vulkanvegas. My account is of course registered in my name and that of my partner in her name, etc.</p>
<p>my partner's account is not verified via KYC.</p>
<p>I have uploaded some documents for some time, 6 of which have been approved, but it is not enough and my account is unchecked. Now, after winning €600, I have uploaded another 18 photos with the desired documents that are "under review".</p>
<p>Then I wanted to change my email address in the online chat with customer support, but I didn't know that my partner used the same one (which I wanted to change for my account) for her registration. The lady in the chat then said that it was strictly forbidden to have duplicates. However, I don't see it as a duplicate if my partner uses one account and I use one. Or ?? As I said, my account is registered with my personal data, as well as with my partner with her personal data!</p>
<p>What can I do? Kind regards</p>
