<p>Information about Megaways games</p>
<p>Megaways are a collection of innovative slot games software that offer action-based gameplay and exciting wins. They are created by Big Time Gaming (BTG), an Australian iGaming provider with a reputation for releasing successful titles.</p>
<p>Founded in 2011, Big Time Gaming soon began to release successful titles, starting with Bonanza Megaways. They continued this with a stream of quality titles including popular theme-based slots Monopoly and Who Wants to be a Millionaire?</p>
<p>Megaways games are available in over 20 different languages and are recognised by most gambling jurisdictions, such as the Alderney and Malta gaming authorities. The games are also tested rigorously by a team of testers who subject them to random result algorithms.</p>
<p>The success of Megaways has led to Big Time selling the software license on, so it's possible you'll see developers like Blueprint Gaming releasing Megaways, as well as other smaller companies.</p>
<p>The Megaways collection is very large, and you can play several of these titles for free on this page. If you wish to play Megaways titles for real money, check out our list of casinos with BTG games.</p>
<p>Megaways slots</p>
<p>Megaways titles stand out for their unusual setup, which involves a special type of random reel modifier that alternates the number of symbols appearing on each reel. The result is that there can be over 100,000 ways to win per spin, many more than the standard 20 or 40 paylines in traditional slots. Throw in features like multipliers and free spins and you have a very attractive betting proposition.</p>
<p>One of the big draws to the Megaways selection is Bonanza. The game is set in a goldmine, and you spin six reels carved into cliff face to a soundtrack of twangy hillbilly music. The game has a couple of great special features, which take place within a fiery night setting: the Reactions feature, where rocks are blasted away to reveal winning combos; and bonus free spins, triggered by landing four scatter symbols spelling GOLD, which include an unlimited win multiplier. The multiplier applies to pay outs and increases after each successive explosion. Also, keep an eye on the gold cart at the top of the reels: anything above three gold bars in there will give you further spins.</p>
<p>The legendary Legacy of Ra is also covered by the Megaways brand. This boasts an irresistible combo of the Megaways system with Book of Ra's revolutionary pay mechanic. The result is over 15,000 ways to win as you embark on a journey into Ancient Egypt. The game is based around the scatter symbol in the game's logo, which triggers various bonus features. You can also use a special bonus buy feature giving you guaranteed free spins, the number of which varies each time.</p>
<p>For something a little different, check out BTG's White Rabbit. Set in a peaceful wonderland of tweeting birds and gentle guitar sounds, the grid, featuring mythical characters such as leprechauns and Cheshire cats, expands when you activate the free spins feature. You can also get wilds symbols and a special feature drop â€” a paid-for option with a twist: the price of it drops according to how many feature-drop symbols you collect beforehand.</p>
<p>The sheer variety of Megaways means you won't get bored in a hurry, and their unique setup is a hit with casino players all over the world. Give them a blast for free and see what you think!</p>
