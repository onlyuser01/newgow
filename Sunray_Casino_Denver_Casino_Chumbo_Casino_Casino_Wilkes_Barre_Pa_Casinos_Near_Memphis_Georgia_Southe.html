<p>Ohio Bobcats to Cash In on Their Good Form</p>
<p>The Bobcats went 9-3 in the 2023 NCAAF, with a 6-2 record in the Mid-American Conference (MAC). Their scoring average was 22.91, which is kind of surprising given that last season they were the highest-scoring offense in the conference. This season, they finished third in this aspect.</p>
<p>The reason for their dip in offensive performance is that their quarterback Kurtis Rourke had big injury problems during the offseason. It took him a while to get his engine running, but he did finish the season in top gear.</p>
<p>Ohio QB Kurtis Rourke has entered the portal as a grad transfer, @TheAthletic has learned.</p>
<p>The 2022 MAC Player of the Year has thrown for 7,650 yards and 50 TDs in his career. Another proven passer on the market. — Max Olson (@max_olson) December 5, 2023</p>
<p>The Canadian got a QB rating of over 57 in each of his last two games, which prompted him to enter the transfer portal. This, however, doesn’t mean he won’t feature in the 2023 Myrtle Beach Bowl.</p>
<p>On the contrary, the Ohio vs. Georgia Southern game could be an ideal opportunity for him to showcase his talents to NFL scouts.</p>
<p>Georgia Southern Eagles Need to Patch Up Defensive Holes</p>
<p>The Georgia Southern Eagles went 6-6 in the college football season, with their conference record being 3-5. They did alright offensively, scoring 371 points in 12 games or 30.91 PPG.</p>
<p>However, their defense was disappointing. They conceded 355 points, which accounts for 29.58 points conceded per game on average.</p>
<p>The worst thing is that their recent form has been horrible. They lost each of their last four games, conceding 158 points. That’s 39.5 points allowed a game. The worst thing is that a couple of teams that beat them aren’t too famous for being great in the offense.</p>
<p>Excluding Texas State (36.0 PPG) and Appalachian State (34.76), they lost to teams with a worse point average than them – Old Dominion (22.91) and Marshall (23.25).</p>
<p>Georgia Southern Eagles vs. Ohio Bobcats Prediction</p>
<p>Our 2023 Myrtle Beach Bowl prediction is that the Ohio Bobcats will triumph. Kurtis Rourke and Ohio’s offense are going to run riot on the Georgia Southern Eagles defense, whose offense probably isn’t going to do much on December 16.</p>
<p>Pick: Ohio Bobcats (+158)</p>
