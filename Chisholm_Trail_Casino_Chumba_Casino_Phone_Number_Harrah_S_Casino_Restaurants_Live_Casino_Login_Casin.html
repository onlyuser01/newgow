<p>The years-long project is finally nearing the opening of its doors. Mohegan, the tribal and commercial gaming unit owned by the Mohegan Tribe in Connecticut, says it will open the first phase of Inspire on Nov. 30.</p>
<p>Located adjacent to the primary international airport serving the Seoul capital metro, Inspire will debut with three hotels with 1,275 guestrooms, 10 restaurants, including a Michael Jordan’s Steak House, a multi-purpose arena with capacity for 15,000 people, convention and meeting facilities featuring the largest ballroom in South Korea, and an “immersive entertainment street” enveloped by a 150-meter LED display adorning the walkway’s ceilings and walls.</p>
<p>We have been honored to work closely with the Korean government to make this day possible, and we look forward to Inspire contributing to the local and regional economies by creating local jobs, bringing visitors to enjoy the Incheon region, and attracting new businesses both on and adjacent to the property,” James Gessner, chair of the Mohegan Tribe told Casino.org.</p>
<p>Ray Pineault, president and CEO of Mohegan, added that the company’s debut in South Korea “is significant to us not only for our growth in the global market, but also for the opportunity to share Mohegan’s legacy and spirit with the world.”</p>
<p>More to Come</p>
<p>Incheon International Airport in 2009 announced its plans to expand the facility with a new terminal and integrated resort component. Following years of delays, the South Korean government in early 2016 picked Mohegan, then operating as Mohegan Gaming &amp; Entertainment, as its preferred developer of the resort and casino.</p>
<p>The project underwent numerous designs and reviews, which further delayed the resort from coming to reality. The final vision was a $5 billion investment that would be built over several phases and many years.</p>
<p>The first phase, Mohegan says, is the result of a $1.6 billion investment. Along with the aforementioned features, Inspire will open with an entertainment attraction called Splash Bay. The glass-domed structure will initially offer a swimming pool, but will later add an indoor water park.</p>

<p>Forthcoming attractions include Inspire Mall, billed as “an integrated culture space combining shopping, dining, and entertainment.” The facility will be complemented by Inspire Wonders, which will provide shoppers a respite to “appreciate marvels of nature.” Planned “wonders” include Wonder of Space, Wonder of Motion, Wonder of Light, Wonder of Time, Wonder of Petal, and Wonder of Mind.</p>
<p>An outdoor nature attraction called Discovery Park is also slated to open in the first half of 2024.</p>
<p>Casino Opening 2024</p>
<p>Mohegan Inspire will open its foreigner-only casino in “early 2024.” The gaming floor measures more than 200,000 square feet and will feature approximately 1,500 slot machines and 250 table games.</p>
<p>Tables — unlike in the U.S., where slots occupy the most floor space — dominate casinos in most of Asia. Baccarat is among the most popular games.</p>
<p>Inspire’s most anticipated amenity — its private air terminal connecting the resort to Incheon International — is expected to open next year.</p>
<p>Inspire is Mohegan’s first project overseas. The company, in addition to its Mohegan Sun integrated resort in Connecticut, owns and/or operates casinos in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Nevada, Washington, and Ontario.</p>
