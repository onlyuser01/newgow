    <h1>Fanduel Casino Michigan Login Liberty Slots Casino Riverside Casino Golf Resort Iowa Map Of Casinos</h1>

<p>Additional comments from the player:</p>
<p>The fact is that I did not exceed the real limit of 5 euros. All my bets were up to 2 euros for 1 round of play. The total bet for my deposit of 100 euros + 100 bonuses, was 9000 euros. After I won the Dead or Alive 2 of € 75,000 (with a bet of € 1.8), all my winnings were immediately confiscated and left my initial deposit of 100 €.</p>
<p>The casino immediately found a reason to confiscate the money, namely: The purchase of the "bonus function" is equivalent to a bet, so they believe that the conditional game he bought conditionally on the slot machine Extra Chilly in the amount of 30 euros (at the actual rate 0.60 euros for 1 round of play) is considered exceeding. This is a misinterpretation of the rules, because the unity of conditions for bonuses nowhere stipulates that they buy the bonus feature - it is forbidden when the active bonus. It is reasonable to assume that "my real bet when buying the operating bonus was no more than 2 euros from all the bonus features purchased". In most other casinos where I have played when I play with an active bonus feature, it is forbidden to buy the bonus function and therefore it is impossible to enter the slot with such an option. In my opinion, these are the most transparent rules and absolutely fair to the customer. In the case of Betrebels Casino - it is a direct misleading customer and their interpretation of the bonus rules, ie paragraph 4, is considered depending on their wishes and intentions (to pay the player or not). In fact, after buying the bonus features, my balance was around 500 euros. The betting rate of the active bonus at that time was about 30%. My huge victory in the Dead or Alive 2 slot machine was completely legal (I didn't buy the bonus feature on this slot machine) according to the general rules of Betrebels casino. The fact is that I didn't exceed the real limit of 5 euros. All my bets were up to 2 euros for 1 round of play. The total bet for my deposit of 100 euros + 100 bonuses was 9000 euros.</p>
