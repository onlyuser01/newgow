    <h1>The Venue At Horseshoe Casino Casino Santa Rosa The Big Casino Mr Lucky Casino Mystic Casino Snatch</h1>

<p>Good evening!</p>
<p>As I could see there are already tons of complaints about this casino on the internet! I hereby submit another one as the casino refuses to self-exclude me (due to my problem gambling)! I also complain about the bonus policy (8000 euros were simply deleted)!</p>
<p>Statement of facts:</p>
<p>Played at said casino and used a deposit bonus! Won over 13,000 euros! After meeting the wagering requirements, almost 8000 were deleted! Remaining credit: 5000! The unfair bonus conditions seem to allow that! If you use a bonus, you either cannot win anything or you have to expect that everything will be deleted! And for that you give a good reputation???</p>
<p>Self-exclusion: will be denied as long as you have an open withdrawal request or real money balance! Since the withdrawal limit per month is 1000 euros (not 3000/daily as stated by CasinoGuru!) I would have to keep the account for at least 5 months! The casino has been informed of my gambling problem and also knows that I am already banned from over a hundred other casinos! They don't care! This corrupt bunch (sorry for the term, but someone who abuses gambling addicts deserves that term) will do anything to make me gamble away my bankroll! But I won't!</p>
<p>Thanks in advance to Casinoguru for the renewed help! Unfortunately, the withdrawal from some casinos is more difficult than expected! Can you please also indicate the complaints office for the responsible supervisory authority of this casino! In this case, it will be necessary, especially in the interest of player protection, to inform them about what is happening in this casino!</p>
<p>@snatchcasino should no agreement be reached even after Casinoguru intervened, I will definitely take legal action against you! I will sue for the payment and in the course of this also the closure if this should be necessary! I will hold you accountable for any consequential damage caused by forcing you to play! And I will hold you accountable for illegal gambling! We both know you don't have a license for my country! This threat is not an empty promise! For people like you, people like me own legal protection insurance!</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>
