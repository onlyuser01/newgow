<p>Relax Gaming will continue to grow its aggregation platform’s reach by adding new titles by Peter &amp; Sons to it. The aggregator now features more than 4,000 games and has been hailed as one of the go-to options for operators and suppliers, all the while Relax Gaming has been pushing its own designs and in-house games.</p>
<p>The platform has won EGR B2B Awards and Best Game Provider at AskGamblers Awards and continues to be one of the best solutions for operators who are looking to swiftly integrate products into their offer. This integration will now include games by Peter &amp; Sons, which come with some distinct games, such as The Mafiosi, Water Blox Gigablox, Wild Duel, Valkyries, and so much more.</p>
<p>The latest products, such as Voodoo Hex, are also expected to be featured on Relax Gaming once they are taken off the assembly lane. Commenting on this partnership, Relax Gaming CEO Simon Hammon welcomed the opportunity to work with Peter &amp; Sons and add the products to the Silver Bullet program.</p>
<p>The Silver Bullet program is a special solution Relax Gaming has launched to aggregate gaming products from hand-picked third-party suppliers and distribute them across a portfolio of trusted brands. Peter &amp; Sons also welcomed the opportunity to work with Relax.</p>
<p>Yann Bautista Wiberg, Business Development Manager at the company, and one of its co-founders said that he was delighted about the opportunity. "Our games have proved to be a huge hit with players so far, and this agreement will open up so many more opportunities for us. We can’t wait for even more slot enthusiasts to see what we’re all about," Wiberg added.</p>
<p>Peter &amp; Sons is a prominent supplier which managed to break into the industry in 2019 and began designing and launching a series of distinguished games worthy of tier-one operators. The company has been picking up the pace of production ever since.</p>
<p>Previously this year, Relax Gaming made some changes to its executive team, promoting a long-time company veteran Simon Hammon to the role of Chief Executive Officer. The company also ventured into the Italian market thanks to a partnership with PokerStars.</p>
