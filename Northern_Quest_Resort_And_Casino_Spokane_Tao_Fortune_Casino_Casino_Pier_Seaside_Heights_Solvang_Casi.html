<p>Casino Withdrawal Verification</p>
<p>Translate this grammatically into English: Hey, after winnings 6000 euros, I aimed to withdraw 1000 euros, as this casino allows a daily withdrawal of up to 1000 euros. As customary, I was required to verify my identity, which, after 10 rejections, I did. I promptly withdrew 1000 euros. After two days, I received another rejection. This required me to take a selfie with a piece of paper bearing my name, birth date, and the casino's name. I complied, and then tried to withdraw another 1000 euros. The most recent withdrawal attempt was on July 15th, and it's still pending.</p>

<p>Hey, after winning 6000 euros, I intended to withdraw 1000 euros, as this casino promotes a daily withdrawal limit of 1000 euros. As is typical, I was asked to verify my identity, which, despite 10 rejections, I successfully did. I then promptly initiated a withdrawal of 1000 euros. However, two days later, I faced another rejection requiring me to take a selfie holding a piece of paper displaying my name, birth date, and the casino's name. I promptly complied and attempted another 1000 euro withdrawal. This last withdrawal occurred on July 15th and remains pending.</p>
<p>They claim Dutch players are not permitted, yet how was I able to successfully carry out the verification process? I also found that my personal information lists my country as Austria rather than the Netherlands, which was my original selection. Consequently, I asked customer support to correct this issue, only to be informed that the matter was a technical glitch that they had previously encountered.</p>
