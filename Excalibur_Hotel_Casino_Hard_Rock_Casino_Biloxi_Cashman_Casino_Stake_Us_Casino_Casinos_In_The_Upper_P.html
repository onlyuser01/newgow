<p>The fast-growing iGaming content developer, PopOK Gaming, announced it received a certificate in Georgia.</p>
<p>PopOK Gaming Receives Certificate in Georgia</p>
<p>The announcement came Monday and sees the game developer offer local players access to already popular games. Such content includes proven hits such as Lost Treasure, Diamond Flash, Yummy, 20 Hot Bar, Los Apaches, Sultan’s Tale and more leading titles. With its entry into the iGaming market in Georgia, PopOK Gaming vows to “bring a breath of fresh air to all players and make their leisure more colorful, tasty and enjoyable.”</p>
<p>“Since iGaming is regulated strictly in Georgia, it’s a huge step forward to deliver our games to the Georgian audience.“ Karen Gulkanyan, CEO at PopOK Gaming</p>
<p>Karen Gulkanyan, PopOK Gaming’s CEO, deemed the certificate in Georgia as a major step for the company. She acknowledged that the iGaming industry in the country is strictly regulated but thanks to the new certificate, the company will have the option to launch its content for Georgians. Gulkanyan pointed out that PopOK Gaming hopes to catch the attention of the audience with content that will “immediately appeal to the regional players.” In conclusion, she said that the company expects to see growth in business volume.</p>
<p>Thanks to the recent achievement, PopOK Gaming will deliver certified games to its partners in Georgia. At the same time, the company predicted that the new content will boost its partners’ traffic and expand their content portfolio.</p>
<p>The Developer Continues to Expand Its Reach</p>
<p>The recent certificate in Georgia complements PopOK’s ongoing expansion. Earlier this month, the company passed certification in Romania. As a result, PopOK was given green light to offer its iGaming solutions in the country.</p>
<p>Similarly, the company entered the UK back in July. PopOK Gaming unveiled on July 13, 2022, that it has been certified to offer its games in the region. To enter the regulated market in the UK, the company had to implement “technical improvements” that were required by the gambling operator in the country.</p>
