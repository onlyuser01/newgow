<p>William Hill’s brands are set to expand their product offering with the addition of gaming content from Slot Factory after the gaming operator and the B2B development arm of InTouch Games announced an agreement today.</p>
<p>‘Incredible Opportunity’ to Expand Online Casino Presence</p>
<p>The distribution deal between Slot Factory and William Hill will see the operator’s network of online casino brands offer a portfolio of Slot Factory game titles starting with Big Box Bonus and adding many others later throughout 2022.</p>
<p>Commenting on the agreement, Slot Factory’s chief commercial officer Charles Mott hailed the “incredible opportunity” the deal presented to the game developer to expand its presence in the iGaming space.</p>
<p>“William Hill is focused on providing the best betting experience for its players and we are well positioned to contribute to this offering to customers.” Charles Mott, CCO, Slot Factory</p>
<p>The B2B division of UK-based game developer and operator of online and mobile games InTouch Games provides a wide range of in-house developed games with engaging themes, imaginative features and user-friendly interface that have been rigorously QA-tested prior to distribution to ensure the best quality for operators.</p>
<p>Team Dedication and UK Market Strength</p>
<p>Equally content at the new partnership that will allow William Hill to bring unique gaming content to its online casino players, Craig Staples, game content director at William Hill, outlined all Slot Factory credentials which weighed in the decision to partner with the developer.</p>
<p>“The dedication their team puts into creating their games, combined with their strength in the UK market, makes them a trusted partner.” Craig Staples, Game Content Director, William Hill</p>
<p>Slot Factory’s game titles, available both as standalone games or as a full white-label solution, have already proven their quality and captivity among players, helping operators to engage with new players while keeping retention levels high.</p>
<p>Since its inception in 2001, InTouch Games has grown into an industry-leading company operating eight online casino brands among which mFortune, Jammy Monkey and MrSpin, and is boasting a team of over 500 employees across its offices in the UK, Cyprus, Romania, Vietnam, and Taiwan.</p>
<p>Earlier in the month, InTouch Games was acquired by Skywind Holdings, seen as the perfect opportunity to grow Skywind’s B2C presence in the UK and Europe.</p>
<p>William Hill became the latest operator to distribute Slot Factory’s iGaming content, following two distribution agreements in April: with White Hat Gaming and MrQ.</p>
