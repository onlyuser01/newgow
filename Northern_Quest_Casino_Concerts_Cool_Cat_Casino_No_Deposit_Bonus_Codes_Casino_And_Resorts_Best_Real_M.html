<p>REEVO lauded Hacksaw Gaming’s unique touch and said that it is excited to onboard its games</p>
<p>REEVO, a fast-growing B2B content and aggregation platform, has further diversified its library thanks to an agreement with Hacksaw Gaming, a leading provider of iGaming products. As per the deal between the two, the latter company’s library of slot games, scratch cards and instant games will be integrated into REEVO.</p>
<p>Hacksaw Gaming was founded in 2018 and is a disruptive provider of cutting-edge content. At first, the company was primarily focused on digital scratch products but eventually expanded its expertise and now produces many hit slot products and instant win games.</p>
<p>Under the agreement, Hacksaw’s existing and future content will become available to REEVO’s partnering operators, allowing them to greatly improve their offerings. Thanks to the partnership, REEVO’s clients will be able to engage their fans with games such as Le Bandit, Wanted Dead or a Wild, R.I.P. City, Dork Unit and Bloodthirst, among many others.</p>
<p>Hacksaw Gaming’s best-in-class games also recently made their way into N1 Casino in Greece, expanding the company’s international presence.</p>
<p>REEVO Continues to Grow at a Rapid Pace</p>
<p>REEVO’s head of sales, Petra Maria Poola, commented on the new integration, praising Hacksaw Gaming as a developer of outstanding and highly playable content. She lauded the company’s unique touch and said that its games will be a great addition to REEVO.</p>
<p>They [Hacksaw Gaming’s titles] are an excellent addition to our platform that is attracting the biggest and most innovative studios and providing our operator partners with the best possible choice of content. Petra Maria Poola, head of sales, REEVO</p>
<p>REEVO continues to grow at a rapid pace as the company adds more and more content from third parties. In addition to its proprietary content, the company offers games from over 70 top companies.</p>
<p>Some of REEVO’s latest partners include notable industry names such as Orbital Gaming, Vibra Gaming and Barbara Bang Games. Earlier this summer, the company also penned agreements with AvatarUX, RubyPlay and Endorphina.</p>
<p>Prior agreements also saw REEVO integrate titles from 3 Oaks Gaming, OnlyPlay and Turbo Games into its platform.</p>
<p>Currently, REEVO’s platform sports some 8,000+ games, including slots, table, crash games and live gaming titles. REEVO’s ambition for 2023 is to have added content from at least 60 more providers by the end of the year.</p>
<p>In other news, REEVO just released Rays of Ra, a proprietary Egypt-themed game.</p>
