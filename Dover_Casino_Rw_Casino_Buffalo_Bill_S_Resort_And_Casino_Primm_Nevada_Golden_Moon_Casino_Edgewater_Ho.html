<p>The WSOP Super Circuit in London will mark the first time a WSOP event has been held in the UK city since 2010.</p>
<p>The World Series of Poker (WSOP) will return to London for the first time in over a decade. As announced by GGPoker, the world’s biggest poker room, the WSOP Super Circuit Series is set to take place in London this summer.</p>
<p>GGPoker noted that the WSOP Super Circuit Series will take place at the JW Mariott Grosvenor House Hotel in the British capital’s Mayfair district. The event, scheduled to take place from July 27 to August 13, will welcome some of the best poker players in the world.</p>
<p>This will notably mark the first time a WSOP event has been held in London since 2010.</p>
<p>Tournaments for Everyone</p>
<p>Four big events have been announced for the upcoming 2023-2024 WSOPC season. This includes a £3,000 + £300 WSOP Super Circuit series main event. In addition to that, there will be a £500 + £60 Colossus, a £1,000 + £100 Mystery Million and a £10,000 + £400 High Roller events.</p>
<p>Each competition’s specifics will appeal to different poker-playing demographics, allowing many poker pros to enjoy themselves while competing against their peers. Buy-in prices will range from £500 to £10,000, providing options for cautious players and risk-takers alike.</p>
<p>The WSOP Super Circuit Series will also host a competition that will welcome fifteen holders of WSOP Gold Ring holders.</p>
<p>If the buy-in prices are still too high for some players, they could also test their mettle in the satellite tournaments hosted by GGPoker. Players can register for these events and compete against other challengers for a shot at qualifying for GGPoker’s bigger tournaments.</p>
<p>WSOP Published Its Summer 2023 Schedule</p>
<p>In February, the WSOP revealed its full schedule for summer 2023, promising a year of excitement to poker enthusiasts. Its main event will be held between May 30 and July 18 at the Horseshoe Las Vegas Casino.</p>
<p>The poker series is planning to host a total of 95 bracelet events prior to that, providing lucky players with chances to win exciting prizes. One lucky player will win free entry to 30 upcoming WSOP Main Events.</p>
<p>Back then WSOP’s SVP &amp; executive director Ty Stewart said that his team expects record-breaking WSOP and World Championship at Paris and Horseshoe Las Vegas activity in 2023.</p>
<p>In other news, GGPoker high rollers recently boycotted the company’s updated rake system. The players slammed the historically high rake rates, which have now been made even worse.</p>
