<p>The Hard Rock Hotel and Casino project near Bakersfield, California moved one step forward after the Assistant Secretary of Indian Affairs signed the approval that the Tejon Indian Tribe can operate a venue at the proposed location.</p>
<p>Hard Rock Hotel and Casino Tejon Project Moves One Step Forward</p>
<p>The Tejon Indian Tribe received federal approval to operate a Hard Rock Casino located just outside of Bakersfield in California. As announced by the Bakersfield Californian, Tara Sweeney, Assistant Secretary of Indian Affairs signed the approval earlier this month outlining that the proposed by the tribe location is suitable. The next step now is to be taken by California Governor Gavin Newsom who has one year to make the final decision.</p>
<p>“The Department’s decision enables us to move closer to the promise of self-determination through economic development.” Octavio Escobedo III, chairman of the Tejon Indian Tribe</p>
<p>Octavio Escobedo III, chairman of the Tejon Indian Tribe said in a statement that the Tribe has had a relationship with the U.S. government since 1851. Since then, the Tribe has fought for a homeland for its people, he added. According to Escobedo, considering the recent decision of the federal government, now the Tribe moved closer to its goal. It was back in January 2012, when the Tejon Tribe was federally recognized. According to data by the Tribe, by now it has 1,111 members.</p>
<p>A $600 Million Investment</p>
<p>The proposed site where the Tribe may be allowed to build a casino is located near Mettler which is about 15 miles away from Bakersfield. The Tejon Indian Tribe casino project involves the creation of a 166,500-square foot gaming venue as well as a luxury hotel.</p>
<p>The hotel building would be 11-story high featuring 400 hotel rooms, more than 10 restaurants, convention space as well as a Hard Rock Live events center. A fire station, sheriff’s office, and an RV park are also to be established within the area.</p>
<p>Details revealed on the official website of the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino Tejon project outline that the project is expected to create approximately 5,000 workplaces. Furthermore, if the $600 million investment is given green light, it is expected to increase tourism and boost the local and state economy.</p>
