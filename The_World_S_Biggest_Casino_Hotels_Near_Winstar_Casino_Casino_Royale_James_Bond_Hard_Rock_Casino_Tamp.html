<p>Secure and licensed</p>
<p>Although relatively new, El Royale Casino is one of the most prominent online casinos that cater to US players. The website was set up in 2020 and it has a distinct Speakeasy Club ambiance that is reflected in how the casino offers its bonuses and games. The awesome theme aside, El Royale Casino is a great online casino at its core as our review has shown.</p>
<p>There is a wide selection of games powered by trusted providers such as Visionary iGaming and Realtime Gaming, among others. The brand is owned by Infinity Media Group LTD, a legitimate and trusted operator of casino brands, and El Royale Casino itself holds a license from the Curacao eGaming Authority.</p>
<p>El Royale Casino Bonuses and Promotions</p>
<p>We have taken our time with the El Royal Casino bonuses and promotions since there are so many of them. To be perfectly honest, El Royale Casino really prioritizes choice, but it may be just a bit confusing what to pick first.</p>
<p>Well, we won’t hold this against the casino, as there are plenty of good options to go with here. The most important part is to choose which of the bonuses you want to claim with the $7,500 welcome bonus one of the best options. Claiming and clearing bonuses at El Royale Casino is fun and easy to follow, as you will see in a minute.</p>
<p>El Royale Casino Welcome Bonus</p>
<p>Starting from the top, the welcome bonus at El Royale Casino is definitely easy and simple enough to follow. Players will get to spend $7,500 on their favorite slot and card games. The minimum deposit amount is very easy to meet as well, at $10 for Neosurf depositors.</p>
<p>If you use Bitcoin, Litecoin, or Ethereum, you need to deposit at least $20. The bonus itself is split into several installments that you will claim at slightly varying match rates. To get started, you need to use the bonus code EGGCITEMENT250 for the 250% bonus up to $2500. This means to get the maximum value, you need to deposit $1,000.</p>
<p>This first part of the welcome bonus comes with a 35x wagering requirement that applies to both the deposit and bonus. The second part of the welcome package is triggered with the EGGCITEMENT150 bonus code which is a 150% match up to $1,500. The bonus is available twice. Once again, the same conditions apply as above. There is also the EGGCITEMENT100 bonus code to use and get a 100% match up to $1,000. This bonus is also available twice.</p>
<p>Crypto Bonus at El Royale Casino</p>
<p>The crypto bonus at El Royale Casino is definitely geared towards high rollers, and there are no two ways about this. Players who wish to access the generous $9,500 welcome package will need to use the CRYPTOBONUS promo code.</p>
<p>To trigger the bonus, you need to deposit a minimum amount of $1,000 in one of the supported currencies, whether this is Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, or USD Tether. The maximum bet with this bonus is $10 and there is a 35x wagering requirement on both the deposit and bonus.</p>
<p>Now, this is one serious sum of money to play through, and we understand your trepidation. Personally, we have high rollers in our team who said that $9,500 is a feasible sum, provided you are a big game hunter yourself. The crypto bonus is available on the first five deposits, too, so you will have some leeway in playing through the amount. You can spend your crypto welcome bonus at El Royale Casino on slots, keno, scratch cards, and board games.</p>
<p>El Royale Casino’s Special Offers</p>
<p>There is more to El Royale Casino than meets the eye. The website is filled with excellent additional promos besides the sign-up bonuses that you can scoop up once you have registered. In our experience, the casino makes access to these additional promos exceptionally fun and easy.</p>
<p>There are lots of these goodie bags that are designed to play a part in the casino’s theme and we love that. Following the bonus selection is also fairly easy. El Royale Casino extends options such as Today’s Special, a 165% slot bonus activated with ROYALHOUR promo code.</p>
<p>There is also the 24/7 Event which is another 165% slot bonus you claim with the NIGHTSHOW promo code. Players can also get the All-inclusive Pass that will grant them a 125% match on slots and cards and is activated with the DRESSCODE bonus.</p>
<p>In case you enjoy free spins, there is a lot of this to go around just as well. Players can grab 100 spins on Gemtopia.</p>
<p>Get Comp Points and the El Royale Treatment</p>
<p>Another part of the experience that we ought to mention is the loyalty experience with El Royale Casino. We have reviewed the program and are very happy with the results. Basically, you get one comp point for every $10 you wager. Then, you can convert 100 comp points into one dollar.</p>
<p>This rate may not seem tremendous, true – but it’s simple and straightforward. There are no hidden conditions here. You can redeem your comp points as you see fit and in one of the simplest and most streamlined ways, we have seen at any VIP program online.</p>
<p>Is El Royale Casino Online Trustworthy?</p>
<p>Yes, El Royale is a trustworthy online casino. Players who are wondering if El Royale is legit can rest assured that they have come to the right place.</p>
<p>The casino owns a license from Curacao eGaming Authority and has a solid track record as a brand. It helps that El Royale Casino is also known to US players as a brand they can reliably register at and play.</p>
<p>El Royale is further audited for fairness independently and it abides by industry standards, providing players with a level and fair playing field. There is also advanced security on the website to make sure you can browse and navigate El Royale with peace of mind.</p>

There is a mix of slots, table games, video poker, and live dealer options to explore at El Royale. The bulk of the portfolio is provided by Realtime Gaming, with live dealer games by Visionary iGaming.</p>
<p>The titles are neatly arranged across the website to provide you with quick and reliable access to their entirety. In the library, you will find titles such as Slots, Poker, Table, Specialties, and Blackjack. Players will find a hefty selection to enjoy, with the casino constantly adding to its library.</p>
<p>Slots and Jackpots</p>
<p>Slots are one of the biggest groups of games you will discover at El Royale Casino. Players will discover a mix of popular video slots and progressive jackpot titles. Popular choices here include Aladdin’s Wishes and Aztec’s Millions, both of which offer players the chance to win seven-figure prizes while betting nominal stakes at a time.</p>

The graphics and visuals are spot-on, particularly in games such as Dr. Winmore, Dragon’s Gems, Desert Raiders, and more. The jackpot slots can be tracked in real time so that you can see what jackpot you are looking to win at any one time.</p>
<p>El Royale Casino will also let you play many of the titles as demos, letting you explore the games’ features, volatility, and theoretical return first-hand without ever having to pay your own money to test.</p>
<p>Table and Card Games</p>
<p>There is no shortage of great table and card games. In reviewing El Royale Casino, we stopped by the section to see what was available and found quite a range of different titles. There are blackjack and poker games, with options such as Caribbean Hold’em, Caribbean Stud Poker, and Tri Card Poker, European Roulette, and more. We also found several versions of blackjack, including 21 Blackjack, 21 Blackjack + Perfect Pairs, and Suit’em Up 21 Blackjack.</p>
<p>This large collection of table games provides you with a sturdy variety of titles that you can explore at your own leisure. The table limits were very flexible and accommodating across the board. You will definitely be able to pick a title with a great house edge and decent RTP to have a blast with at El Royale Casino. Also, table games are a great way to add to your loyalty comp points that are later redeemable for real money.</p>
<p>Video Poker</p>
<p>There are quite a few video poker games to explore, with 14 titles readily available. Some of the popular video poker options here include Aces &amp; Eights, Bonus Poker Deluxe, Deuces Wild, Jacks or Better, Joker Poker, Double Jackpot Poker, Double Bonus Poker, Loose Deuces, and more.</p>
<p>Video poker has an excellent house edge that makes it a lot of fun to try and play these games with El Royale. The added incentive that you can “beat the house” definitely helps make you enjoy your game a little more. Not only that, but the betting limits on video poker are very flexible.</p>
<p>You will notice that you can bet between $0.01 and $1 per credit. Realtime Gaming has a great reputation for bringing excellent and spot-on titles in the video poker vertical. The graphics are a bit dated, admittedly, but video poker is about a balanced house edge and the opportunity to try play your hands optimally.</p>
<p>In this sense, most players who love video poker prefer the classic user interface, as they find most actualizations to be a little distracting.</p>
<p>Live Dealer</p>
<p>El Royale brings you a great live dealer online casino with 12 games powered by Visionary iGaming. The titles feature Baccarat, Roulette, and Blackjack options that you can play on your own time.</p>
<p>There are no demo versions in the live casino, and you must play all games with real money. The betting limits start fairly small, but you can easily be betting $1,000 or $2,500 per round, which is great for those players amongst you who are high rollers.</p>
<p>Overall, Visionary iGaming does a great job of keeping the live lobby together, offering you professional live dealers and casino games that are streamlined in real-time and without any feed disruptions. Sure, the picture quality can be upped a bit, but we don’t really see this to be an issue.</p>
<p>All live casino games by Visionary iGaming are provably fair and are audited to guarantee their impartiality, which means you can enjoy a trusted experience with El Royale Casino’s live dealer selection.</p>
<p>Banking Methods at El Royale Casino</p>
<p>El Royale Casino makes it easy to use various banking methods so that you can deposit and withdraw your money and winnings as you think is best. Overall, there is a great variety of payment options and flexible limits on transactions. You will find a handful of methods that you may not see in other online casinos licensed in Curacao as well, which gives El Royale Casino a small edge when it comes to managing your funds.</p>
<p>Deposits</p>
<p>Method Minimum Deposit Maximum Deposit Visa $30 $1,000 MasterCard $30 $1,000 Bitcoin $20 Unlimited Ethereum $20 Unlimited Litecoin $20 Unlimited Tether $40 Unlimited Flexepin $20 $500 Neosurf $10 $250</p>

<p>This makes for a fun and easy way to deposit and definitely helps with the $9,500 crypto welcome bonus. Overall, the deposit options are instant, and you will enjoy a great experience when you first enter the casino.</p>
<p>Withdrawals</p>
<p>Method Minimum Withdrawal Maximum Withdrawal Visa $150 $2,500 MasterCard $150 $2,500 Bank Wire $150 $2,500 Bitcoin $150 $2,500</p>
<p>Although we have not experienced any difficulties with the banking methods at El Royale Casino, and find the information to be straightforward and helpful, we are still not very happy with the fact that the maximum withdrawal is set at $2,500.</p>
<p>This is not to say that the casino won’t let you withdraw your full amount across several transactions. Still, it’s a bit of a hassle to have to do that, and we believe that El Royale Casino can take quick steps to remedy this.</p>
<p>Aside from that, the overall banking at the casino is solid, quick, and reliable, making it easy to enjoy the gameplay from start to finish.</p>
