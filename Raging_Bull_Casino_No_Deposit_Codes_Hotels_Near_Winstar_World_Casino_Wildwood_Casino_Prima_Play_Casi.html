<p>PlayAGS will provide new slot games to expand its current product portfolio with DraftKings Casino to over 20 titles</p>
<p>Supplier of online casino content PlayAGS announced another game content partnership with a high-profile US gaming operator, DraftKings, to continue to expand its presence in the North American iGaming market.</p>
<p>Turbocharge DraftKings Casino’s Operations</p>
<p>The new content deal with Boston-based DraftKings will see PlayAGS deliver a portfolio of over 20 proprietary slot titles to help DraftKings speed up its online casino operations in the US and build on the existing casino content partnership between the parties.</p>
<p>Commenting on the latest content deal with a market leader in the US, Gary Hardy, senior vice president and general manager of Interactive at PlayAGS, hailed the launch of the company’s real-money gaming (RMG) content on DraftKings Casino as “a considerable accomplishment for the company.”</p>
<p>“We are pleased to provide DraftKings players in New Jersey with the differentiated, exciting, and high-energy gaming experiences we are known for delivering, and we are excited to further expand our partnership with DKNG moving forward,” Hardy concluded.</p>
<p>The new deal is set to build on the current DraftKings Casino offering of PlayAGS’ games in New Jersey of over 10 titles, including some of the supplier’s most popular and player-preferred games such as River Dragons, Fu Nan Fu Nu, Rakin’ Bacon!, Jade Wins, and Capital Gains, as well as two titles from PlayAGS’ Imperial 88 game family, Peacock Beauty and Tiger Lord.</p>
<p>New Title Launches Set to Continue</p>
<p>DraftKings Casino and PlayAGS are planning to go live with additional titles, including the highly acclaimed Golden Wins Deluxe which received in the 5th Annual Eilers &amp; Krejcik Gaming Slot Awards a nomination for a top-performing new online game in the iGaming category .</p>
<p>Beginning as a supplier of Class II Native American content, PlayAGS branched out to become an all-inclusive commercial gaming supplier, offering a suite of high-performing Class II and Class III slot products, an expansive portfolio of table games, RMG platforms and content, social casino solutions and excellent service to its casino partners.</p>
<p>The content partnership signed with DraftKings is the latest for the casino content supplier with a leading US gaming operator, after the agreement PlayAGS reached with Caesars Sportsbook &amp; Casino last month.</p>
<p>PlayAGS agreed to deliver high-performing titles from its portfolio of online gaming content to help boost Caesars Sportsbook &amp; Casino’s online RMG operations.</p>
<p>The game selection included more than 30 titles from the supplier’s interactive content library, including Capital Gains, Rakin’ Bakon!, Gold Wins Deluxe, Tiger Lord, and other titles that have proven their popularity among players across land-based venues.</p>
