<p>The license enables the company to offer its services to operators that are locally licensed, allowing its solutions and content to reach new partners</p>
<p>The provider of innovative content and solutions serving online and land-based gambling operators across the globe, Bragg Gaming Group, confirmed it has secured a business-to-business (B2B) remote gambling license in Gibraltar. Securing the license from the important iGaming hub marks a milestone moment for the company as it complements its global expansion.</p>
<p>Moreover, the B2B remote gambling license enables Bragg to offer its services to operators licensed in the jurisdiction. Currently, some of the most famous and globally recognized gambling operators are locally licensed in Gibraltar and that list includes giants like bet365, William Hill, 888, Entain and Lottoland, among many others.</p>
<p>Securing the license in Gibraltar boosts Bragg’s ongoing strategy for global growth. This achievement will enable the company to further expand the reach of its innovative portfolio, reaching new partners.</p>
<p>Only recently, Bragg announced a major change to its senior-level team. Late last month, the company revealed it selected Matevž Mazij as its new CEO, replacing the outgoing Yaniv Sherman.</p>
<p>Lara Falzon, Bragg’s president and chief operating officer, spoke about the importance of holding a license from a jurisdiction such as Gibraltar. She confirmed that this license creates new growth opportunities for the company that can expand in strategically regulated gambling markets.</p>
<p>Falzon praised Bragg’s ongoing growth in the last few months, explaining that the company established its operations in new jurisdictions. She added that this license further complements its expansion. Finally, Falzon said: “We’re looking forward to collaborating with new partners and to introduce our content on their online casino platforms.”</p>
<p>“Gibraltar is an important jurisdiction that is home to both UK and international facing companies and this license will enable us to further expand our presence in key regulated markets.“ Lara Falzon, president and chief operating officer at Bragg Gaming Group</p>
<p>The B2B iGaming Provider Continues to Grow</p>
<p>In addition to Gibraltar, Bragg currently holds B2B licenses in strategic jurisdictions, including Malta, the UK, Sweden, Belgium and Greece. The company also has access to Ontario, Canada, and four US states, among other important markets.</p>
<p>Currently, Bragg remains committed to growth and expansion and its latest results are a testament to its progress. Looking at becoming a leading iGaming B2B provider, the company reported revenue of €24.7 million ($26.5 million) for the second quarter of this year. This result, compared to the corresponding period in 2022, marked an increase of 18.9%.</p>
