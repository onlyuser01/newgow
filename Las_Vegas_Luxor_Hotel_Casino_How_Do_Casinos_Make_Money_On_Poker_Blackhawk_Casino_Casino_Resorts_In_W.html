    <h1>Las Vegas Luxor Hotel Casino How Do Casinos Make Money On Poker Blackhawk Casino Casino Resorts In W</h1>

<p>Innovative sports betting technology company Simplebet announced today its partnership with Intralot saw the rollout of new real money micro-betting products in Washington DC and Montana, to cover action from the National Basketball League (NBA) and Major League Baseball (MLB).</p>
<p>Following the Success from the NFL</p>
<p>The launch of the first-ever automated micro-betting product on the NBA and MLB followed the debut Simplebet and Intralot made in the early months of 2021 in both jurisdictions on playoff games from the National Football League (NFL) which attracted serious betting interest.</p>
<p>“We saw incredible user engagement around our real money offering during the NFL playoffs and are thrilled to unveil our next products for the NBA and MLB seasons alongside our partner, INTRALOT. Micro-betting represents the future of the sports betting landscape in the U.S. and our technology is delivering an unmatched product for fans, operators and media partners.” Chris Bevilacqua, Co-Founder and CEO, Simplebet</p>
<p>Simplebet and Intralot teamed up in November last year with the purpose to offer bettors micro-betting opportunities on games from the NFL, NBA and MLB via GambetDC, an online sports betting operator in Washington DC, and the initial response was more than encouraging, accounting for approximately 25% of the entire NFL in-play handle of the operator.</p>
<p>“The results from the rollout of our real money micro-betting products in GambetDC and Sports Bet Montana have been extremely positive thus far and we’re excited to deliver the next evolution of wagering opportunities for the basketball and baseball seasons.” Byron Boothe, CEO, Intralot Inc.</p>
<p>Via GambetDC and Betting Terminals</p>
<p>Through GambetDC and at locations housing Sports Bet Montana terminals, the first-ever fully automated product featuring games from both professional sports leagues, powered by Simplebet’s proprietary micro-betting pricing engine, will allow bettors to wager on millions of moments over the course of every game.</p>
<p>The micro-betting solution which allows every second of a game to become a moment to bet on, runs on the Orion sports betting platform of the premier wagering and lottery supplier that has operations across 41 regulated jurisdictions globally and accounts for $22.1 billion of placed wagers annually.</p>
<p>Sports betting technology supplier Simplebet recently completed a $15 million round of financing to raise $50 million and allocate the funds for further development of its technology platform to allow it to power micro-betting and accommodate all forms of in-play wagering and fan engagement in the US.</p>
