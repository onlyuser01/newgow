<p>The premium content provider for the iGaming industry, Skywind Group, announced Tuesday that it completed the acquisition of Intouch Games Group, the award-winning technology company.</p>
<p>Skywind Finalizes Intouch Games Group Acquisition</p>
<p>Founded in 2012 by a group of industry veterans, Skywind Group offers high-performance iGaming solutions and content for key regulated markets around the world such as Europe, Asia and Latin America. The company’s growing portfolio is innovative and features live dealer, slot games, as well as sports and engagement tools.</p>
<p>By finalizing the acquisition of Intouch Games, Skywind will expand its presence in the UK, which is one of the largest markets in Europe. Currently, Skywind offers more than 200 slots, live casino and player engagement tools on its platform. The recent takeover will help expand Skywind’s portfolio further by adding popular live casino and slot games.</p>
<p>The Company Continues to Grow</p>
<p>Skywind has more than 600 dedicated professionals that work from offices located in the UK, Belarus, Ukraine, Malta, Romania, Australia, the Philippines and Cyprus. Since its foundation more than a decade ago, Skywind solidified its place as a leading global business-to-business solution provider within the iGaming industry. The company currently holds 7 licenses and has a presence in 19 regulated markets around the world. Overall, Skywind has more than 250 customers and has joined forces with more than 1,000 operators worldwide.</p>
<p>Intouch Games was established back in 2001. The award-winning technology company quickly grew to become an industry leader, offering unique game content for its customers. By taking over Intouch Games, Skywind’s workforce will increase significantly. More than 500 Intouch employees based in Romania, the UK, Cyprus, Taiwan and Vietnam will now become a part of Skywind.</p>
<p>Early last month, Skywind announced that it launched its services in Portugal. As a result, the company is now live in one of the largest and fastest-growing European markets. Before that, in April, Skywind released a new online slot game offering growing multipliers called Teller of Tales.</p>
