<p>NetEnt and Red Tiger, two brands of the premium provider of online casino content, Evolution, announced a new partnership with Supabets, the leading South African operator.</p>
<p>Supabets to Offer Slots from NetEnt, Red Tiger</p>
<p>Under the terms of the new collaboration announced today, Supabets becomes the first operator in South Africa to offer slots. As a result, NetEnt and Red Tiger will provide the operator with a world-class portfolio of 175 slot games. It’s important to mention that at a later stage, additional content may be added as well. To achieve the recent launch, Supabets collaborated with the gambling regulator for the market, the Mpumalanga Economic Regulator (MRE).</p>
<p>But this is not Evolution’s first collaboration with Supabets. Previously the duo joined forces which resulted in the launch of Evolution’s live games portfolio. Now, the recent deal further strengthens Evolution’s partnership with Supabets. At the same time, the operator expands its offering that is available to customers in South Africa, Tanzania, Zimbabwe and Ghana.</p>
<p>The Collaboration Brings Excitement</p>
<p>Dean Finder, the CEO of Evolution, shared his excitement in a statement. He revealed that the company is delighted to expand its partnership with Supabets by adding NetEnt and Red Tiger’s leading slot portfolio. In conclusion, Finder said: “We hope their players will enjoy the diversity of the portfolio, as there truly is something available for everyone to enjoy.”</p>
<p>“We are delighted that we have the opportunity to expand our partnership with Supabets and that they will now have access to our portfolio of NetEnt and Red Tiger slot games.” Dean Finder, CEO at Evolution Services SA</p>
<p>Marc Palxton-Harrison, the managing director of Intelligent Gaming added that the approval from the MER brings excitement to the company. He acknowledged that after the approval from the regulator, Supabets can expand its offering by launching world-class slots from Red Tiger and NetEnt. Palxton-Harrison predicted that the new content will be well received by Supabets customers. In conclusion, he said that the company is looking “forward to adding the portfolio to our remaining SA clients.”</p>
<p>“We are ecstatic to finally have MER approval for the launch of the NetEnt and Red Tiger world-class slots offering.“ Marc Palxton-Harrison, managing director at Intelligent Gaming</p>
<p>Only recently, in June, NetEnt announced the launch of Space Wars 2 Powerpoints, a sequel of its popular game. The sequel of the popular Space Wars slot game offers high volatility and unique high-tech features. Space Wars 2 also combines interesting characters and thrilling graphics.</p>
