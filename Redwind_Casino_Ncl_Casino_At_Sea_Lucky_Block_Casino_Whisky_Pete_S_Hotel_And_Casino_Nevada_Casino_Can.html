<p>Esports Entertainment Group (EEG) has selected Stuart Tilly as the group’s new chief operating officer. As a result, the company will entrust the executive with several responsibilities that will pertain to its overall performance and the latest launch of esports betting products in New Jersey.</p>
<p>Preparing for Busy Months Ahead</p>
<p>Last week, the Division of Gaming Enforcement approved the launch of EEG’s Vie.gg betting platform in the Garden State. The platform is the first officially recognized esports betting platform in the marketplace.</p>
<p>Tilly will seek to navigate this and other essential aspects of the company’s operations. He joined EEG at the time of Argyll Entertainment’s acquisition which the company bought out in August 2020.</p>
<p>He served as the CEO through the end and then transferred and assimilated into the EEG’s ecosystem as a chief legal officer. After serving close to two years in his position, he will hope to steer EEG’s future plans that are not limited to esports.</p>
<p>In fact, EEG has been on a series of acquisition moves, targeting companies such as Lucky Dino Gaming Limited and Game Fund Partners. Commenting on his new appointment, Tilly said:</p>
<p>“Having played a role in the burgeoning expansion of the company’s operations through our M&amp;A activity since joining the company in the summer of last year, I’m incredibly excited to now be entrusted with overseeing the next stage of the company’s operational growth.” EEG COO Stuart Tilly</p>
<p>Mergers and Acquisitions Are EEG’s Bread and Butter</p>
<p>Mergers and acquisitions will clearly play an important driver in EEG’s future growth and performance in the months and years to come. EEG CEO Grant Johnson welcomed his appointment. He explained that Tilly’s position is critical in enabling the company to pursue its long-term goals.</p>
<p>“With Stuart’s extensive iGaming knowledge, first-hand experience of launching and growing businesses together combined with his legal and regulatory background, we felt he was the ideal fit for this position,” Johnson said.</p>
<p>In December, EEG teamed up with Hard Rock Atlantic City to assist the property in setting up a skill-based esports tournament. The event runs from January 22 through January 23. EEG has been prominent in the esports space.</p>
<p>The company became an official esports tournament provider for the Cleveland Cavaliers in May 2021, and the company secured a similar partnership with the New York Rangers in June last year.</p>
