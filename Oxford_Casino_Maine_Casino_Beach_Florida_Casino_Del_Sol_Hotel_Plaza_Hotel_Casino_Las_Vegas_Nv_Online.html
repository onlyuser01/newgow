<p>Singapore continues to crack down on illegal gambling with a new police operation rounding up 25 suspects</p>
<p>Singapore has arrested 25 people who the Police Force believes were involved in illegal gambling. The suspects include 13 men and 12 women between the ages of 31 and 76. The illegal gambling ring was allegedly run by a 52-year-old woman and a 39-year-old woman who hosted electronic gambling devices out of an unlicensed venue. A statement by the police said:</p>
<p>The Police take a serious view of all forms of illegal gambling activities and will continue to take tough enforcement action against those who are involved in such activities. Singapore Police Force</p>
<p>Upon raiding the location, police authorities seized SG$19,752 worth of cash on hand, 11 phones, and other items that were found to be connected with running the illegal gambling business. This makes the latest similar move by the Singapore Police Force over the past years.</p>
<p>Singapore Police Works Hard to Stop Illegal Gambling</p>
<p>In the last years, there have been hundreds of similar arrests. Between 2020 and 2022, the police arrested more than 2,400 people linked to various gambling offenses, including sports gambling. Singapore recently revamped its laws with the Gambling Control Act 2022.</p>
<p>Under the revised legislation, anyone who is running illegal gaming or betting may serve up to five years in prison and is liable to a penalty of up to SG$200,000. Even those participating may be sent to prison for up to six months and be ordered to pay SG$10,000.</p>
<p>This case follows another similar development that saw authorities look into 89 people who are allegedly involved in betting illegally on sports gambling. Authorities have been very active in homing in and clamping down on illegal gambling operations.</p>
<p>Regardless, those operations have continued to multiply in the jurisdiction despite the threat of imprisonment and financial penalty that perpetrators risk. One theory is that there is a lack of awareness about the penalty gamblers run the risk of suffering if caught.</p>
<p>Other offenses have taken place directly on the grounds of the Marina Bay Sands and do not concern illegal gambling operations specifically.</p>
