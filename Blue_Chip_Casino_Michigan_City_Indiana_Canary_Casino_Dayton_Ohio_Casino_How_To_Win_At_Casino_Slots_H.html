<p>DraftKings has acquired sports betting radio company Vegas Sports Information Network (VSiN), though financial terms have not been disclosed.</p>
<p>DraftKings Successfully Acquires VSiN</p>
<p>Daily fantasy sports operator DraftKings has announced the successful acquisition of Vegas Sports Information Network (VSiN) – a US-based sports betting radio network and streaming service. The company develops and distributes live linear sports betting on a daily basis.</p>
<p>VSiN is a relatively new organization, having only been launched in February of 2017. Despite this, the multi-channel network has already established itself on the market. Over the years, VSiN has attracted prominent professionals such as Brent Musburger of ESPN and Michael Lombardi of the National Football League (NFL).</p>
<p>The purchase’s financial terms were not released, but DraftKings said it would allow it to improve its product and content capabilities in the 14 states where it operates. DraftKings, which recently named its first-ever WWE gaming partner, will completely incorporate VSiN’s existing workforce into its global workforce of 2,600 employees.</p>
<p>This year, DraftKings has taken significant steps to expand the reach, selection, and quality of its services. The business recently signed a historic deal with the American Cornhole League, marking the first sports betting collaboration on competitive cornhole in the industry.</p>
<p>DraftKings Impressed By VSiN’s Service and Infrastructure</p>
<p>Jason Robins, co-founder, CEO, and Chairman of DraftKings, welcomed the acquisition and praised VSiN and its content. VSiN’s material, according to Robins, is genuine and factual, and appeals to sports bettors of all ability levels, whether they are just starting out or more advanced.</p>
<p>Robins also spoke highly of the brand’s established infrastructure. He noted that VSiN’s existing framework can be quickly and efficiently expanded. Robins believes this would add value to customers looking to inform themselves about or practice sports betting.</p>
<p>VSiN chief executive Brian Musburger also praised the acquisition. Musburger is one of the company’s co-founders alongside Todd Musburger and Dave Berg. According to Musburger, VSiN was created as a destination for sports bettors to find the most credible content to help inform their wagering decisions.</p>
<p>In terms of the acquisition, Musburger assumes that by leveraging the DraftKings brand’s strength and network, VSiN will be able to attract an even larger audience with its exclusive content.</p>
<p>Musburger and his management team will continue to run VSiN on a day-to-day basis while maintaining editorial independence.</p>
