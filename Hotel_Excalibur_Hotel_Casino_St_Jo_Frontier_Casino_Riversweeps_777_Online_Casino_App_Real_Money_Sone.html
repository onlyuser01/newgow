    <h1>Hotel Excalibur Hotel Casino St Jo Frontier Casino Riversweeps 777 Online Casino App Real Money Sone</h1>

<p>Hy</p>
<p>I deposited 25 â‚¬ in the casino via Ecopayz and then tried to verify my account and it worked after several days.</p>
<p>Well then I clicked out and what do I see ..</p>
<p>No Ecopayz, only Astropayz and offline payment.</p>
<p>Then I took offline payment and told the support that they should please pay out on Ecopayz ..</p>
<p>As you can see in the casino there are 3 different times when they pay out.</p>
<p>60-70% of our withdrawals are automated. This means that customers who have verified their accounts and used the same payments method as per deposit, will have their withdrawal processed immediately.</p>
<p>30-40% of our withdrawals are manual. This means that in some cases the withdrawal needs to be manually approved, therefore it can take up to 24 hours to be processed.</p>
<p>Go on with</p>
<p>Visa - 2-7 business days</p>
<p>MasterCard - 2-7 business days</p>
<p>eco Payz - 2-7 business days</p>
<p>Bank Transfers - 2-7 business days</p>
<p>Neteller - 2-7 business days</p>
<p>Interac E-Transfer - 2-7 business days</p>
<p>Paykasa - 2-7 business days</p>
<p>Skrill - 2-7 business days</p>
<p>eco Voucher - 2-7 business days</p>
<p>Flexepin - 2-7 business days</p>
<p>Qiwi Wallet - 2-7 business days</p>
<p>Pay Safe Card - 2-7 business days</p>
<p>Neosurf - 2-7 business days</p>
<p>Oto Pay - 2-7 business days</p>
<p>And finally from the support itself</p>
<p>Processing time takes 24 to 48 working hours.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>When asked what is correct, the following email came after 4 days of pending and nothing has happened so far.</p>
<p>Hello and thank you for your email.</p>
