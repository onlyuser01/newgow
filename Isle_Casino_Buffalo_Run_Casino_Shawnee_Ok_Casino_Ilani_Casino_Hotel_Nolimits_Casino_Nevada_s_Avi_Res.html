<p>Opened Not Even for a Month, Avi Resort and Casino in Laughlin Closes Doors Temporarily</p>
<p>The Avi Resort and Casino in Laughlin, Nevada announced yesterday that it will temporarily shut down operations until July 10. The operator was forced to suspend operations after employees tested positive for COVID-19. All of Nevada‚Äôs casinos, movie theaters, and other entertainment venues labeled as ‚Äúnon-essential‚Äù were ordered to close down back in mid-March. The order by Governor Steve Sisolak effectively stopped the casinos from operating within that period in order to help the state flatten the curve of COVID-19 spread in the state.</p>
<p>Earlier in June, the Silver State entered a new phase in the reopening plan. This lifted the ban, which was introduced in mid-March and casinos were allowed to reopen doors for visitors. The Avi Resort and Casino in Laughlin did not wait long to restart operations on June 8. But keeping in mind recent events, the operator has closed doors for visitors after not even one month of operation.</p>
<p>Few Employees of Avi Resort and Casino Showed a Positive COVID-19 Test</p>
<p>Further to the Avi Resort and Casino announcement, the company said that an excessive of 400 team members were tested. According to the operator‚Äôs statement ‚Äúfew team members‚Äù tested positive for COVID-19. With that being said, the company did not disclose the exact number of team members that tested positive for COVID-19. The operator‚Äôs statement also noted: ‚ÄúAdditionally, the significant rise in COVID cases in the local area is of utmost concern.‚Äù Due to the closure, the operator said that the Independence Day holiday weekend firework show is also cancelled.</p>

<p>The operator did not miss to say that for the time that the property is closed, a thorough evaluation will be conducted as well as deep sanitation and cleaning. Commenting on the subject, Brian Cook, general manager of Avi Resort and Casino said: ‚ÄúThese are unprecedented times and our commitment to the well-being of our community, tribal members, team members and guests is our highest priority.‚Äú</p>
<p>Guests who reserved their stay for dates until July 10, 2020 will receive a full refund on their purchase, read the Avi Resort and Casino‚Äôs announcement. The company also noted that they will keep monitoring the updates from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Further to the statement, Avi Resort and Casino said that they will keep close communication with the state‚Äôs health officials and the Nevada Gaming Control Board (NGCB). If necessary, the operator said that it will update their safety protocols and procedures.</p>
<p>Last week, the Gaming Control Board has announced that possible disciplinary actions may be introduced for operators who do not follow the health and safety guidelines for operating in the post-COVID-19 environment. With that being said, some operators have already prepared and tested new cashless options. On the other hand, the Gaming Control Board has added that such cashless options may be implemented in the near future.</p>
