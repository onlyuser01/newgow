<p>Chicago Fire has won only two home games this season, but Frank Klopas’s men hope they can add another one to the list this Saturday when they’re playing against Nashville SC at Soldier Field</p>
<p>After two back-to-back losses in the MLS, Nashville SC beat DC United somewhat routinely 2-0 last weekend. It’s just the opposite when it comes to the Chicago Fire. “The Men in Red” saw their two-game winning streak end with a 3-1 loss to Orlando City.</p>
<p>As a result, Chicago Fire is now third from behind in the East, while Nashville SC is sitting in the No. 2 position in the conference standings.</p>
<p>What’s giving Frank Klopas and his boys some confidence ahead of the July 8 game is that they’re playing on their turf. They haven’t been great at Soldier Field this season, with just two home wins so far. The good news, however, is that one of those happened right after Klopas took over as the interim manager in May.</p>

<p>Chicago Fire Showing Signs of Improvement</p>
<p>Ezra Hendrickson got fired from the head coach position at the Chicago Fire on May 8. Since then, the interim manager Frank Klopas has led the team in 10 MLS games, with his team winning four of those, losing three, and playing a draw on three occasions.</p>
<p>The fact is that Chicago’s form has improved under Klopas, particularly in home matches. With him in charge, the Fire has a 1-1-1 record at Soldier Field. His men defeated the Eastern Conference leaders St. Louis City 1-0, while also tying 3-3 with Atlanta United, the team with the most valuable roster in the MLS.</p>
<p>In their most recent game in Chicago, they lost to high-flying Columbus Crew, but it was a 2-1 loss. Plus, Columbus scored its winning goal in the third minute of stoppage time.</p>
<p>Nashville SC Needs Points Before the Schedule Gets Ugly</p>
<p>Nashville SC is second in the East with 38 points after playing 21 games. These guys are 11-5-5 with a 30-16 score difference. It’s almost certain we’ll see them in the postseason unless something really goes astray for Gary Smith and his boys.</p>
<p>They’ve got another three games to play before the Leagues Cup break, and two of those look really hard. After the game with Chicago, they take on the Philadelphia Union, followed by a game against FC Cincinnati. Those two are going to be very tough matches, which is why they will probably focus extra hard on winning points against Chicago.</p>
<p>They definitely have the manpower to get a win on Saturday, with players like Hany Mukhtar and Randall Leal in top form right now. What’s got to worry them ahead of their trip to Illinois is that they haven’t been great on the road lately. In fact, they’re without a win away from home in three games with two losses and one tie.</p>
<p>Chicago Fire vs. Nashville SC Prediction</p>
<p>On paper, Nashville SC looks like the better team, but Chicago’s players have shown some signs of improvement lately. That’s why we expect to see a real battle on the pitch on July 8, with a draw looking like the most probable result.</p>
<p>Pick: Chicago Fire and Nashville SC to draw</p>
