    <h1>True Fortune Casino Rio All Suite Hotel Casino In Las Vegas What To Do At A Casino Casino Free Games</h1>

<p>I received an email on 07/08 from Bitcoin casino.us which was in reference to a 250% bonus promotion ( Bonus code UTMOST ) which prompted me to make my first deposit with them on 07/09. Upon doing so only the deposit was accredited to my account. I contacted live chat regarding the issue and was told that the promotion was no longer available. I explained to her that I had just received the email and that it's specifically stated on the email that it was good for one-time July 9th - July 10. She had me send her a screenshot of the email and even after seeing the dates were on there told me that after conferring with management that the promotion was still no longer available. Apparently I raised such a ruckus about it that they took the money I had originally deposited leaving me with a zero balance. So basically they stole my money. I attempted to contact live chat as well as support regarding the issue and even though I could see that they were reading my messages on live chat no one would respond. It is my firm belief that the criminals that set up this site have done so solely for the purpose of stealing from people. It is criminals such as this that are giving all of online gaming a very bad reputation.</p>
