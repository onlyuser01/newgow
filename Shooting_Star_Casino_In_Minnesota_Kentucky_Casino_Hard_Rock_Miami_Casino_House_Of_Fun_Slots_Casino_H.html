    <h1>Shooting Star Casino In Minnesota Kentucky Casino Hard Rock Miami Casino House Of Fun Slots Casino H</h1>

<p>I became a customer of Twin casino on 7/12 2022 and then made my first deposits. The day after Thursday 8/11 I decided to withdraw 5,000 of my total of 8,025 euros I had with twin, I withdrew the other 3,025 euros on 10/12 (I only withdrew 5,000 euros because that was the daily limit for my payment method) . I have sent in papers to verify myself but they constantly asked for new papers even though I sent in the documents they asked for and today 12/12 they want another document that shows my income I thought they said that address, id and bank account paper is what is needed, but instead they ask for more documents. I had contact with an Igor on the Twin Security team via email who said that my "proove off address" was not accepted as it was from some document they wrote that they wanted yes even though it was a police report in pdf that stated my name, address and was not older than 6 months so then he wrote "Most of our Swedish players are using https://www.skatteverket.se/ to generate and download document for Proof of Address" so i did that yesterday 11/12 and he still has not accepted that document but instead asks for new documents strangely enough. I want my 8025 euros immediately and it should not be like this at a casino with a Maltese gaming license, I have played at many Malta licensed casinos and there has never been anything like this at twin. Please help me.</p>
