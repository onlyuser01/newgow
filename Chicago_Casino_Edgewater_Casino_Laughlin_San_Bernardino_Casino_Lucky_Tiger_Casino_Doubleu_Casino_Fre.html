<p>After successfully launching its first live game product via its Universal Game Launcher last November and hitting the impressive 500th employee mark in 2022, On Air Entertainment has announced another important growth milestone. The company has released the Standard Roulette game, another praised casino classic among players.</p>
<p>Standard Roulette Will Be Broadcast From Latvia</p>
<p>On Air Entertainment owns a state-of-the-art live dealer gaming studio in Riga, Latvia. The studio hosts multilingual betting tables that can host players speaking more than 20 languages. The operator uses a large number of cameras for capturing cinematical angles and the essence of gambling in real-time. All roulette ball drops and spinning movements are closely followed by the cameras.</p>
<p>Similar to the operator’s debut game Standard Blackjack, Standard Roulette also uses the “player comes first” focus. The game features top-tier streaming technology with eye-catching and uninterrupted table action. While Standard Roulette closely follows the gameplay rules of the classic European roulette game, OnAir’s players will get access to racetrack bets, special bets like Complete Bets and Finales en Plein, and favorite bets with as many as 40 different bet configurations.</p>
<p>Pre-saved bets are also available within the game, along with hot and cold number snapshots, hit percentages for several game outcomes at a time, and accurate statistics for the past 500 roulette spins.</p>
<p>On Air Entertainment’s Standard Roulette version can be played on all types of desktop and mobile devices thanks to the adjustable game interface compatible with all screen sizes and aspect ratios. The game can be played on both the horizontal and the vertical for added convenience.</p>
<p>On Air Entertainment Eying Three More Regulated Gaming Global Markets in 2022</p>
<p>Building upon last year’s momentum, OnAir has big plans to further increase its reach on existing markets, while penetrating three new regulated global markets in 2022. Since its official launch in the UK at the beginning of the year with 32Red and Betway, the operator has been busy preparing its launch on the Greek territory. The November 2021 release of its first live casino table game led to the operator doubling its number of studio employees. OnAir is getting ready to gear up for even more action at the tables with brand new titles on the horizon, including Auto Roulette which will be launched in the second quarter.</p>
<p>OnAir’s head of product Armands Zalitis expressed the operator’s excitement for the release of their second live casino game while acknowledging the important contribution of its hard-working and dedicated team.</p>
<p>Before the UK launch, On Air Entertainment partnered with Microgaming in order to power its fresh line of casino products while breaking into the live gaming industry after its hiatus.</p>
