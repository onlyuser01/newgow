<p>Updated event schedule as well as further details announced by Daniel Negreanu regarding upcoming GGPoker WSOP online events.</p>
<p>2020 WSOP Events Started Yesterday and Will Run through September 6</p>
<p>There is a total of 85 World Series of Poker (WSOP) bracelet events planned for this year’s tournament edition. The events which feature bracelet prizes have started yesterday – July 1 and will run through September 6. The start of the WSOP events was marked by yesterday’s “kick-off” $500 buy-in no-limit hold’em.</p>
<p>A total of 85 bracelet events will be launched between two separate poker websites. Of that number, 54 events will be featured on GGPoker. The other 31 will be available on WSOP.com and to players 21 or older within the states of New Jersey and Nevada. Each day will have a winner and the tournament will feature pot-limit Omaha or no-limit Hold’em. The 54 events featured on GGPoker on the other hand will start on July 19 through September 9. The main event will be the $5,000 buy-in WSOP Online no-limit hold’em with a guaranteed prize of $25,000,000.</p>
<p>Postponed Back in April, WSOP Events Get a Move On</p>
<p>Looking back, WSOP events were set to start on April 20. This however quickly changed with the spread of COVID-19 and the introduced lockdown in Las Vegas. With no other options, WSOP announced the postponing of original events. Then, the WSOP announced the new dates in June for the 85 gold-bracelet events. It’s important to mention, that this year’s number of online events sets a new record.</p>

<p>Looking back, since 2015, there have been only 18 online WSOP gold bracelet events. Initial plans for this year was that some 14 online bracelet events were to be held. However, the number of online events has increased to 54. Keeping this in mind, this year more players than ever before will be able to join in an attempt to win the prestigious poker memorabilia.</p>

<p>Schedule Changes for GGPoker Events and More Details Shared by the Professional Daniel Negreanu</p>
<p>The professional poker player and GGPoker Ambassador Daniel Negreanu shared an update on GGPoker’s events schedule. According to Negreanu’s announcement, the $10K NLHE Heads-Up Championship was changed from August 9 to August 8.</p>
<p>As a reason he pointed that Sunday, August 9 will be a really busy day, and based on feedback, it was better to move the event to another date. Negreanu also pointed out that an additional event will be added for August 9. GGPoker is adding the $1,500 buy-in NLHE GGMasters High Roller freezeout event on the same day instead.</p>
<p>Further to the announcement, Negreanu revealed more details for players participating in GGPoker events and traveling in the US. According to Negreanu, those players will need to rent an Airbnb or a hotel outside of the US, or wherever GGPoker is available, and show proof of address. Negreanu also expressed hope that the WSOP main event, $10K buy-in freezeout could be held at the traditional venue instead of online, but this would only be possible if the COVID-19 crisis settles down.</p>
