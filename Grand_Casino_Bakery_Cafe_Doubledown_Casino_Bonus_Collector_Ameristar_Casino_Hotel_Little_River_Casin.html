    <h1>Grand Casino Bakery Cafe Doubledown Casino Bonus Collector Ameristar Casino Hotel Little River Casin</h1>

<p>RiskCherry, a company that was founded with the ambitious goal of simplifying game certification and helping studios gain a foothold in key markets, has obtained an important piece of licensure itself with the company now moving to the United Kingdom after it secured the necessary permit from the UK Gambling Commission (UKGC).</p>
<p>This effectively allows RiskCherry to help established and up-and-coming studios based in the United Kingdom obtain the necessary permits needed to roll out their products. The company is specifically focused on aiding companies that are just breaking ground into the market to find a good purchase and deliver outstanding experiences for their players.</p>
<p>RiskCherry is a global juggernaut when it comes to certifications, and it has been able to obtain licenses from Sweden, Denmark, Gibraltar, and Malta, where the company is headquartered. The list goes on with localized licensure in the Isle of Man, Alderney, Spain, Lithuania, and others. It also holds several ISO standards, including 9001:2015, 17025:2017, 17020:2012, and 27001:2013.</p>
<p>Thanks to its comprehensive offer, RiskCherry helps companies that are developing games to focus on just that, while taking over all the red tape to ensure that partner studios are given a quick and honest shot at expanding in regulating markets.</p>
<p>RiskCherry COO Mihael Mladenov has welcomed the opportunity to obtain this crucial license and expand the companyâ€™s footprint yet again. "By simplifying the certification process, we are uniquely positioned to help our clients scale their operations efficiently," Mladenov added.</p>
<p>His company is already making waves in key regulated markets, including the United States, Canada, and Latin America, and RiskCherry has an established reputation as a trusted iGaming test lab.</p>
<p>RiskCherry will be attending the upcoming SBC Summit Barcelona2023 and present its product at a time when it has been able to secure an entry into one of the most exciting and lucrative European iGaming markets in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>RiskCherry presently offers video slot and other game certifications on its website, but the company is also determined to expand its offer. The ultimate goal is to make the certification simple owing to quick, high-quality, and impartial services that help studios really gain a firm foothold.</p>
