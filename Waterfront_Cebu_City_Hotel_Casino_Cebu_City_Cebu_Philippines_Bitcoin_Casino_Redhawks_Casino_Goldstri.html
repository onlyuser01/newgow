    <h1>Waterfront Cebu City Hotel Casino Cebu City Cebu Philippines Bitcoin Casino Redhawks Casino Goldstri</h1>

<p>I recieved a $200 chip for Xmas from Captain Jack's Casino. Played the play through of $6000 won $400 . I tried initially withdrawing wire. My identity was confirmed quickly via driver's license. I met the play through and didn't play any un allowed games. The support team was very helpful getting me to use bitcoin as the withdraw method and I am fine with that. I ended up having to withdraw only half, as instructed to, then was told the other $200 went to the chip</p>
<p>Didn't make sense to me, but it was approved for $200 got sent a congratulations email, and checked on it the next day nothing in my bitcoin account, so I contacted support to make sure that everything was there and see if they needed anything else from me. I was shocked when the support person said that I was not getting anything from them, she was the supervisor, I asked for her boss, then disconnected from the chat. I went back and sat there for a while, only to be told I wasn't getting the money, they gave me the chip via email, I have never withdrew from them before, never won there before, but made sure I was doing what is required. I am very upset obviously, and it's not right. I feel robbed and tricked. Please help me out. I am sending screenshots as proof.</p>
<p>Thanks Jolie Trahan</p>
