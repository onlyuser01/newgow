    <h1>Casino Hot Springs One Day Casino Bus Trips Near Me Tropicana Casino Online Par A Dice Hotel Casino</h1>

<p>The Sports Betting Network (VSiN) has decided to expand its team of award-winning TV broadcasters, oddsmakers, and top-notch managers with Len Mead. The sports media veteran has been appointed the company’s new general manager. The synergy between Mead and VSiN is expected to bring some important changes for VSiN. Here is why.</p>
<p>Mead Brings Massive Media Experience from Prior Positions</p>
<p>The DraftKings-owned sports media company that generates 24-hour industry news, detailed analyses, and sports data for millions of bettors plan to tap into Mead’s expertise in the industry in an effort to grow on all levels. In short, VSiN plans to strengthen its brand and position on the market, bolster its audience, and ultimately become the most reliable authority in the field. The company is already catering to the needs of millions of Americans looking to wager on sports on a daily basis, so its goals do not seem too far-fetched.</p>
<p>Mead can help tick all the boxes, as he spent the last 27 years working on audience growth strategies across a wide plethora of channels at NBC Sports, ESPN, and NESN. He was also PointsBet’s head of content and filled in extensive leadership positions at national and regional sports leagues and networks over the years. Prior to working for PointsBet, Mead was vice president of Media &amp; Broadcasting Partnerships at the XFL. There, he managed the pioneer project that made TV access available to sports fans inside live games via FOX and ESPN.</p>
<p>The field of sports betting is, therefore, no stranger to him. Accordingly, Mead is expected to generate premium content for a larger number of bettors on even more VSiN platforms.</p>
<p>The company that owns a number of satellite studios in top-tier gaming properties in the US used the voice of its chief executive officer brain, Musburger, to express its optimism regarding the appointment.</p>
<p>Innovation Is Key – Mead’s New Role at VSiN</p>
<p>Innovation is key to successful growth and Mead will be using his unique ideas on VSiN’s rich content distribution network that includes fuboTV, Comcast Xfinity, iHeartRadio, Sling TV, Rogers’ Sportsnet, TuneIn, MSG Networks, NESN, AT&amp;T Pittsburgh, and several radio stations spread across the US. He will also oversee VSiN’s dedicated website, app, and podcast and along with the company’s newsroom studios located in several sports books at Vegas hotels and casinos. The list includes Circa Resort and casino and South Point Hotel, Casino, and Spa.</p>
<p>Mead called the news of his appointment “an exciting time” while praising Musburger’s remarkable work that helped create “something special” that established VSiN as a smart and credible leading sports betting content generator. He also expressed his eagerness to help expand VSiN’s audience and cater to the needs of bettors “of all levels everywhere”.</p>
