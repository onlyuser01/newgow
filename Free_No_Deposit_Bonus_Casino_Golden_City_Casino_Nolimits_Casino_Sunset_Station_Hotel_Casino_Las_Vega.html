    <h1>Free No Deposit Bonus Casino Golden City Casino Nolimits Casino Sunset Station Hotel Casino Las Vega</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>This casino again is doing their famous thing, and it is the only thing they do best.</p>
<p>After going through the same experience last August when i posted a complaint on them, now they are again delaying my withdrawal and this time they even toke the right from me to express my disappointment.</p>
<p>They namely blocked me from live chat, every time i go on chat they close it and proof are in the screenshots.</p>
<p>I have deposited, played and requested a withdrawal the 1st of this Month and till now i am running after them to ask why are they stating in the general terms and conditions that withdrawals takes maximum of 48h for verified users which i am one of.</p>
<p>They don't answer this questions because they are taught to, this is a scam from a neutral point of view because the general T&amp;Cs are the contract between me and the casino and they are again breaching it regardless of not mentioning that WAGE Free Bonus isnt withdrawable and is a Sticky Bonus.</p>
<p>They now kick you out of chat if you keep asking about information that you have the eight to ask for.</p>
<p>I attached screenshots of their Email correspondence and also of the live chat and of my transactions.</p>
<p>This poeple with all due respect are not professional and cant even write or experess themselves clearly in English and they just handle like you some cheap material that they use. I am a regular player and depositor and get this handling of animals, not mention also that they work 90% with Copy Paste....</p>
<p>I am wondering how are they operating under a licence when they allow themselves to breach their own terms and conditions. Should i breach them then the response wouldn't take more than some 5 hours or so but in this case they allow themselves everything.</p>
<p>I am not letting of this matter they must adjust themselves and they have to process my withdrawals in the given timeframe because thats how everything works in this world, with respect ling rules !</p>
