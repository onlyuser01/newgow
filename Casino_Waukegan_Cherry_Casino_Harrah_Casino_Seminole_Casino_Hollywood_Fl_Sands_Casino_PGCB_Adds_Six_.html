    <h1>Casino Waukegan Cherry Casino Harrah Casino Seminole Casino Hollywood Fl Sands Casino PGCB Adds Six</h1>

<p>At this point, the reports about adults leaving children outside in casino parking lots are not anything surprising. Nevertheless, the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board (PGCB) has been clamping down on offenders, and often – the properties that have allowed such accidents to happen.</p>
<p>Children Left Unattended in Pennsylvania Casino Parking Lots</p>
<p>While it’s not always a casino’s fault that reckless parents leave children unattended, standards across casino parking lots are rising. The latest adults sanctioned by the PGCB and passed on authorities have been banned from the Keystone State casinos.</p>
<p>A total of six adults were named in the latest PGCB ban issuance. They had left children aged from 11 months to 12 years in casino parking lots across the state while nipping inside to gamble. Some kids were left in parking lots for more than an hour while others were left right in the casino lobby. A 10-year-old spent six hours in a vehicle unattended.</p>
<p>The PGCB has chosen to withhold the names of the casinos where the incidents took place, but the PGCB has made sure to place the adults on the Involuntary Exclusion List, which means that they would no longer be able to gamble across the state. It’s very likely that in some of these cases criminal charges would also follow, and social services have been informed about the issue as well.</p>
<p>Not the First Case, Not the Last Case Either</p>
<p>Authorities, casinos, and not least the PGCB have been working hard to ensure that these accidents are kept to a minimum. In May, a man was discovered to have left his child in the Rivers Casino in Des Plaines, Illinois. The case is similar to the ones that happen in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania began the year with a firm commitment to ensure that such offenders are not admitted to casino gaming floors, but despite this, it will take time to make sure that parking lots do not have abandoned children. While awareness of the issue is important, it will probably be down to casinos to spend more on hiring more people to patrol the parking lots and do door-to-door checks to ensure that all is well.</p>
