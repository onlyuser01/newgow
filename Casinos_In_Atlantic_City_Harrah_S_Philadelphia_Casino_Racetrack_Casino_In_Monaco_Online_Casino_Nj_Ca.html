<p>FanDuel, an American company offering a sportsbook, daily fantasy sports, online casino content and online horse race betting, has unveiled a new responsible gambling campaign, celebrating the Problem Gambling Awareness Month.</p>
<p>“The System” Will Teach People on Safe Gambling</p>
<p>The new campaign is called “The System” and is launching right in time for Problem Gambling Awareness Month. The System will see FanDuel encourage healthy and responsible gambling across its digital verticals as well as on TV and radio.</p>
<p>The initiative will aim to convince punters that gambling can be both safe and fun. The operator will promote its own suite of safe gambling solutions called Play Well and will explain what the benefits of being responsible are. Play Well has the following solutions available to bettors: deposit limit, wager limit, maximum wager size limit, time limit, time out, and self-exclusion.</p>
<p>FanDuel will also produce promotional content featuring its influential brand ambassador Craig Carton – a popular name in the world of sports media. Carton will participate in a series of videos that teach FanDuel’s customers and employees the intricacies of responsible gambling and what tools bettors have at their disposal.</p>
<p>Carton, a bettor himself, will share his own experience with sports betting and gambling and will advise people on what they can do to ensure they are safe from harm while still enjoying the thrill of placing a bet.</p>
<p>FanDuel Donates to the NCPG</p>
<p>To further demonstrate its commitment to responsible gambling, FanDuel will donate $100,000 to the National Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG). This will support the council’s activities by providing it with the much-needed funding to help more people deal with gambling harm.</p>
<p>Keith Whyte, the executive director of the NCPG, thanked FanDuel for its commitment to responsible gambling and its willingness to partake in the Problem Gambling Awareness Month. He is glad that the company acknowledges the issue and is willing to help to resolve it.</p>
<p>Whyte lauded the operator’s Play Well tools, saying that they offer “a common-sense, non-stigmatizing approach” to enjoying gambling responsibly:</p>
<p>“This critical initiative not only offers vital consumer protections but actively encourages customers to use these tools regularly.” NCPG executive director Keith Whyte</p>
<p>Adam Warrington, the vice president of responsible gambling for FanDuel, reiterated the company’s intentions of fighting against gambling harm and providing its customers with the tools they need to play safely. He added:</p>
<p>“Our new ad campaign and Craig Carton’s content aim to bring an important spotlight to our player control tools that help customers keep sports betting fun and entertaining.” FanDuel VP of responsible gambling Adam Warrington</p>
<p>FanDuel has never forgotten how important customer safety is despite being one of the leaders in the US betting market. The company is constantly expanding and scoring new partnerships. At the beginning of February, FanDuel announced its intentions to create a land-based sportsbook at the United Center stadium in Chicago.</p>
