    <h1>Best Casinos In Florida Online Roulette Casino Hollywood Casino Online Casino Ocean City Md Casinos</h1>

<p>Starting May 7, horse racing bettors in New Jersey will have the opportunity to legally place fixed-odds and pari-mutuel bets at Monmouth Park. The new options have resulted from a partnership between Australian developer and provider of Business-to-Business sports betting products BetMakers Technology Group, the New Jersey Thoroughbred Horseman Association, and Darby Development. The fresh service will allow both bettors and horse racing fans to place pari-mutuel and fixed-odds bets with the help of easy-to-use terminals with self-service.</p>
<p>What Will the New Self-Service Terminals Bring to Bettors?</p>
<p>Monmouth Park visitors will get free access to a brand new self-service terminal that is part of Global Tote’s fresh BetLine series. The terminal features touchscreens with wide displays and a dedicated user interface that accepts tote bets, creating a completely different experience for guests who usually go to the Monmouth Park tracks to watch the races.</p>
<p>Bettors will also take advantage of a large board that provides results, odds, and real-time messages during the races. The launch of the new product will also be accompanied by the release of a new web platform along with a mobile app created by Equibase together with BetMakers. Both will allow horseracing fans to place fixed-odds bets on their favorite races. A project that would launch fixed-odds betting wagering in sportsbooks’ own betting apps is also currently underway. The project would expand the customer base in the industry, raise stakeholder returns, and enable bettors to enjoy a richer array of options.</p>
<p>Plus, BetMakers is also determined to offer wagering on eligible tracks located outside NJ that have signed a distribution agreement for fixed odds with the Global Racing Network division that belongs to BetMakers.</p>
<p>BetMakers Makes Historical Move in the Garden State</p>
<p>The New Jersey racing market legalized fixed-odds betting last August when Governor Phil Murphy signed the bill that put the new regulation called the Fixed-Odds Wagering Act into law. The Act enables bettors to place fixed-odds bets using official sportsbooks that are licensed, as opposed to limiting them to pari-mutuel bets. This turned the Garden State into the first US state to legalize these types of bets for the first time in history.</p>
<p>BetMakers chief executive officer representing North America Christian Stuart expressed the company’s excitement about launching a “new slate of enhancements” that includes fixed odds betting on horse racing in the US while working with the “visionaries” at Monmouth Park. Following the impressive growth of sports betting since the abrogation of The Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act in 2018, BetMakers is determined to embrace progress and make new investments in the industry.</p>
<p>Their approach also focuses on constantly changing the way customers engage with their favorite sport. With their newly appointed non-executive director Anna Massion by their side to help with their strategy in North America, the company is slowly writing its global growth story.</p>
