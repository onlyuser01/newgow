    <h1>Casinos In Md Big Dollar Casino Login Casin Protein Casino By Me Casino Movie Cast Enteractive to He</h1>

<p>Enteractive, a company that specializes in retention and engagement for the iGaming industry, has signed NetBet as its latest partner. The partnership covers the Italian market where the NetBet brand operates both a casino and sports betting platforms. The company is working on personalized retention and engagement solutions that can help NetBet grow its player base, reactivate dormant customers, and optimize revenue streams, among other improvements across key performance metrics.</p>
<p>NetBet and Enteractive Embark on Loyalty, Reactivation and Retention Journey</p>
<p>Enteractive has more than 14 years working in the iGaming sector and has been instrumental in helping brands all over the world to reactive and better engage with their customers and audiences.</p>
<p>The two companies will work on various campaigns that will be run on behalf of NetBet and seek to increase player loyalty. Native speakers will engage with local players and drive real-human one-on-one outreach by phone, which Enteractive argues works and has the evidence to back this up.</p>
<p>NetBet country manager for Italy Filippo Stotani welcomed this opportunity and said that he felt confident that Enteractive will help boost CRM activities and engage with players better:</p>
<p>We work hard to always keep our customers informed about our services, new features, and the benefits of playing on NetBet. The personalized approach of calling the players and having a chat with them really works and they seem to appreciate it. NetBet country manager for Italy Filippo Stotani</p>
<p>The partnership was similarly welcomed by Enteractive CBO Andrew Foster who said that the company’s Italian teams are going to make a real difference for NetBet in Italy. “Players have told us that it makes a real difference to have a phone call from a brand, showing they care about player enjoyment and entertainment,” Foster explained.</p>
<p>Enteractive feels confident that its methods work as the company has been successfully reengaging more than 13,000 players per month for a number of leading operators across the globe.</p>
