    <h1>Casino Pier Breakwater Beach Fortune Casino Login Westgate Hotel And Casino Las Vegas South Point Ho</h1>

<p>Dear Sirs and Madames,</p>
<p>I have played at "WHAMOO" Casino several times over the past few weeks and have always been</p>
<p>excited.</p>
<p>On 07/16/21 I played again from about 16:40 to 20:30. I deposited a total of 3400 euros.</p>
<p>I played a few slots; various blackjack and roulette; I played the way I always play.</p>
<p>Since I was already in the red, my bets got bigger and I was lucky, I could</p>
<p>build up to 4500Euro. I made a payout of 4502 E and had myself blocked for 24 ST.</p>
<p>After about 1 ST. I received the following email from paymentsecurity@whamoo.com:</p>
<p>Hello Peter,</p>
<p>This is Richard from Whamoo. While reviewing your recent payout request we found that you breached our terms &amp; conditions by using strategic betting patterns.</p>
<p>Since this is not allowed, your payouts and balance will be removed from your player account. You will receive a refund for the deposit made of â‚¬ 1000.</p>
<p>To review our terms &amp; conditions, specifically section 8.8, please follow this link:</p>
<p>https://whamoo.com/en-int/terms-and-conditions/</p>
<p>I was shocked to be honest, I've played at a lot of casinos</p>
<p>But I've never heard anything like it before. You play normally and now you win and then something like that.</p>
<p>I have never violated Article 8.8 of the Terms and Conditions and</p>
<p>would like the sampled amount (4502E) to be paid out or back to mine</p>
<p>I don't know how the finance department comes up with something like that.</p>
<p>I've already made 5 withdrawals before.</p>
<p>I would like to ask you to look into the matter.</p>
<p>Many thanks in advance.</p>
<p>Kind regards, Peter M ****</p>
