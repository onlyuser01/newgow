<p>Next-generation data-informed business-to-business provider of casino games aimed at disrupting the market with headquarters in Malta and Krakow, Kalamba Games, has announced the release of Blazing Spirit Hold and Win.</p>
<p>The fresh 5×3 slot counts 25 pay lines and it is packed with animal symbols in light of its nature theme. The game follows the launch of Diamond Bounty 7s Hold and Win at the end of August after the introduction of Wilds From the Crypt at the start of the same month.</p>

<p>Bonuses and Personalized Gaming Experience via the Hyperbet Mechanic</p>
<p>One of the main highlights of the new game that packs well-designed symbols of eagles, horses, and owls is the Hyperbet mechanic that allows players to customize their experiences and boost the chances of reaching the free spins round. This can be done by changing their original bet amount according to their needs. For even more enhanced replayability, the slot offers two more bonuses.</p>
<p>To trigger the Hold and Win bonus, players must land a minimum of six Cashpots during the base game. The bonus offers three respins as a reward. Each new Cashpot that is seen landing will retrigger the spins.</p>
<p>To further increase the win potential of the game, players must land at least four different jackpots. Players get an additional prize when they manage to completely fill up the reels with the same Hold and Win symbols.</p>
<p>A minimum of three scatter symbols are needed to trigger the free spins round. The round brings players 10 free spins. During the same round, one additional spin will be awarded for each new scatter seen landing on the grid.</p>
<p>At the same time, all the low-paying symbols will be removed from the gameplay. The Hold and Win bonus can be triggered during the free spins round as well. Chief commercial officer and co-founder Alex Cohen commented on the two bonuses and players’ “ability to win one of these whilst already playing through a thrilling free spin round.” Cohen further called the Blazing Spirit Hold and Win slot one “full of surprises” while expressing confidence in engaging players with its fiery nature.</p>
<p>The game also offers wolf wild symbols and Cashpots featuring instant prizes tied to them. Players must land four or five symbols during the base game to receive their cumulative prize.</p>
<p>At the end of July, Kalamba Games also announced it would join the provider to develop a crash game in the form of Deep Rush.</p>
