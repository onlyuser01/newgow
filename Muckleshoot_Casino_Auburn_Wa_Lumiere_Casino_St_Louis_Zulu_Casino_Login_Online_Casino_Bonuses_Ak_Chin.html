<p>Skulls Gone Wild review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>This slot is themed around the Mexican Day of the Dead festival.</p>
<p>Players will wander twilight streets to find a booth filled with colourful sugar skulls and flowers. Communing with mischievous souls, players will see if the ghosts are feeling kind.</p>
<p>Despite the macabre atmosphere, there’s plenty of lighthearted fun in this game. Players will enjoy the art and magic of the unique Mexican celebration.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The soundtrack is a mix of firework explosions, jovial band music, and jingling coins. This helps conjure the feeling that players are present on the streets of Mexico city taking part in the festival.</p>
<p>The symbols include a classic sugar skull with floral designs adorning the bone. There’s also a skull that resembles Frida Kahlo, and an ornately painted cat. Some players may be reminded of films such as Pixar’s Coco as the spirits come to life through colourful graphics.</p>
<p>The reels are decorated with chains of marigolds, highlighting the juxtaposition between life and death. The orange of the marigolds contrasts with the cobalt of the twilight street in the background. Though the light is fading, the blue alley seems welcoming and full of possibilities.</p>
<p>Finally, at the base of the reels, there are sweets and offers to the dead laid out among candles.</p>
<p>Overall, the animation of this slot captures the spooky yet colourful atmosphere of the Day of the Dead festival.</p>
