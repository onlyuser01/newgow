<p>Wynn 2019 EBITDA Estimates Trimmed, Analyst Doesn’t See Macau Dice Bouncing Favorably For Shares</p>

<p>Wynn Resorts, Ltd. (NASDAQ:WYNN) relies on Macau for a massive percentage of its revenue, and that dependence can be problematic for the stock when gaming activity in the Chinese territory slows.</p>

<p>August gross gaming revenue (GGR) figures for the Special Administrative Region have not yet been finalized. But some analysts already forecast a slowdown there because of bad weather and the lingering US/China trade spat. In turn, at least one analyst is paring his 2019 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) estimate on Wynn.</p>
<p>In a recent note, Union Gaming analyst John DeCree trimmed his 2019 Wynn Resorts EBITDA forecast to $1.89 billion from $1.94 billion, citing softness in Macau.</p>
<p>The outlook in Macau has become increasingly cloudy, with ongoing VIP softness, social unrest in Hong Kong, economic implications for the U.S.-China trade war, [and] incremental competition from regional Asian gaming markets,” said DeCree in the note.</p>
<p>DeCree made those remarks about six weeks after he reiterated a “buy” rating on Wynn stock, with a $150 price target.</p>
<p>Rough Month</p>
<p>In the second quarter, Macau accounted for 70 percent of Wynn’s revenue, making the stock vulnerable to heightened trade tensions between the US and China. Last year, China enjoyed a trade surplus of roughly $420 billion with the US, but data indicates President Trump’s tariff gambit has put some pressure on the world’s second-largest economy.</p>
<p>A recent reading of Chinese economic activity by Bloomberg Economics shows growth slowing there, which follows a report on industrial output that tumbled to a 17-year low. The specter of a Chinese slump is pressuring some other Asian nations whose citizens are among the visitors to Macau, including Hong Kong and South Korea.</p>
<p>Wynn stock is reflecting those fears. The shares tumbled 10.39 percent in August, the worst performance among the four largest US-based gaming companies, and a loss that was nearly double that of Las Vegas Sands (NYSE:LVS), the operator of five Macau properties.</p>
<p>Softness in major economies is seen as a drag on the all-important VIP market in Macau, a group Wynn already expressed struggles with. In the second quarter, the company said VIP turnover at Wynn Macau slid $9.28 billion from $13.93 billion in the year earlier period.</p>
<p>Other Efforts, Figures</p>
<p>DeCree, the Union Gaming analyst, forecast 2019 EBITDA for Wynn Macau of $661.3 million, and $784.6 million for Wynn Palace on the Cotai Peninsula.</p>
<p>Twenty analysts currently rate Wynn stock with 12 having “buy” or “outperform” marks on the shares. The average price forecast on the name is $138.60, well above Friday’s close of $110.15.</p>
<p>Wynn stock’s correlations to Macau put added emphasis on the company to appease Wall Street with a more diversified revenue mix, something it’s attempting to do with Encore Boston Harbor. In July, that venue’s first full month of operation, GGR there was nearly $48.6 million.</p>
