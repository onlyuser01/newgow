    <h1>Milkyway Casino Texas Casino Cliff Castle Casino Lodge Silver Oak Casino No Deposit Bonus Codes 2023</h1>

<p>Ontario is fast becoming a focal point of interest for betting and iGaming companies. Exposure for brands vying for customers is of the utmost importance and this is why BetVictor, a respected betting and online casino brand, has struck an important partnership with the Canadian Elite Basketball League (CEBL) that will cover the entire country and not focus on individual province specifically.</p>
<p>The tie-up will nevertheless allow BetVictor to significantly scale its presence as CEBL’s Official Sports Betting Partner in 2023 and promote the brand. Since BetVictor is licensed and regulated in the province of Ontario, this decision is expected to have immediate benefits.</p>
<p>The sportsbook already features odds for the 2023 CEBL season and Championship, as fans will have more opportunities to derive immediate benefits from the new alliance. Commenting on this partnership CEBL CEO and co-founder Mike Morreale said:</p>
<p>"This partnership with BetVictor will not only offer cutting-edge online gaming experience to users but also an increased awareness of the CEBL brand globally. We look forward to bringing this personalized sports betting experience to basketball fans across Canada for all 107 games this season."</p>
<p>BetVictor’s Samuel Boswell was similarly pleased to see this opportunity come to fruition. Boswell argued that the partnership offered the company and brand the chance to truly connect with basketball fans in Canada and demonstrate the operator’s commitment to providing the best sports betting experience for the game and sports in general.</p>
<p>Boswell similarly explained that BetVictor was actively looking to promote the principles of responsible gambling to customers, a dedication that the company will carry on with as an official partner to the CEBL.</p>
<p>"We hope to promote responsible gambling and provide fans with the tools they need to gamble responsibly," the BetVictor representative said. BetVictor is already running betting markets for the event and covering the games in detail.</p>
<p>The betting options involve in-play wagers, parlays, future markets, and more, offering fans the chance to engage with the aspect of the betting experience they are the most interested in.</p>
<p>Ontario in the meantime has seen companies work hard to position themselves in the market and ensure that they champion responsible gambling as well. Shortly after going live in the province, Betsafe strengthened its responsible gambling commitment with Neccton. The competitiveness of the market has also seen some companies leave.</p>
