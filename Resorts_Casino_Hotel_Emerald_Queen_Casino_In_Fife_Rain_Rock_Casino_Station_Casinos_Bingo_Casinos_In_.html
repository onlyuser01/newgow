<p>Hey,</p>
<p>Thank you for the response. I created this account a few months ago when I tried online casinos and heard about Mbit from another site that offered a bonus match. I deposited XRP and got very lucky. I made a withdrawal and shortly after I got an email about how I had multiple accounts. They were taking the funds due to some terms that i never saw and made accusations that were not true. I have only one account with them and I still don’t understand why anyone would create more than one. They sent that email and didn’t respond for quite some time. They asked me to verify my ID and KYC or something like that. I did everything they asked. They told me I could login and withdrawal my winnings after pleading my case and asking for proof and to communicate about their claims. I try and try to login but never can, I get Captchas that never end and when I try to change my Pw it says something went wrong and to contact customer support. Every-time I did and do they claim their system is okay and it’s me to clear everything and retry. Now they won’t respond. I can’t login and I’m getting nowhere. I lucky have some shots of my account when I was playing and conversations we had but it feels like they just don’t want to pay me and I don’t know why! If it’s the amount? If it’s even a legit casino and I’m very disappointed because I thought they were. Here is everything I gathered and I hope you can help.</p>
<p>I played slots only, I registered and sent everything to them, my ID, me holding my Id and a bunch of stuff to a Luis. I had a bonus match or something but when I won I played through the requirements and hit what I did. I sent an email with all this. Thank you</p>
