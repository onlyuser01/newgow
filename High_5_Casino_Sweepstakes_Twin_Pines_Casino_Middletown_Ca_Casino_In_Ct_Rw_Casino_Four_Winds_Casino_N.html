    <h1>High 5 Casino Sweepstakes Twin Pines Casino Middletown Ca Casino In Ct Rw Casino Four Winds Casino N</h1>

<p>As opposed to the French gambler who turned his $3 pocket change into $3 million on a slot machine in January, a high roller who staked $40,000 on a four-way parlay lost $1 million after he turned down DraftKings’s cashback offer for over $364,000.</p>
<p>Marco Piemonte is the 32-year-old car dealer from Illinois who decided to risk it all on a 2-to-1 money line bet on the game between the Dallas Mavericks and the Phoenix Suns. This wouldn’t be Piemonte’s first ride on the carousel of emotions in 2022. In January, he was this close to taking home a whopping $1.2 million after betting on Georgia’s win over Alabama, a victory that sports fans had not witnessed in the past decade and a half.</p>
<p>Piemonte Decided to Let In Ride Once Again</p>
<p>Once again faced with the let-it-ride or cash-it-out dilemma, the player decided to risk it all as he had done many times before in the past. Piemonte grew from being a small pocket change player at 16 to becoming a high roller industry veteran at a very young age. He landed his first serious win of $78,000 on a poker site online at the age of 19 and continued to take home some serious bacon over the years. Today, he is not afraid to wager tens of thousands on sports, and his payouts constantly bring him into the spotlight.</p>
<p>His latest $1.3 million payouts in October 2021 came after betting $33,000 on a four-leg parlay that was eventually capped off by Cleveland Browns’ win against the Denver Broncos.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Piemonte was getting ready to pop the champagne once again after he managed to hit his first three legs a day before when the Memphis Grizzlies covered the spread and the San Francisco Giants and the Boston Celtics both won. It would all be determined by Wednesday night’s Game 5 between the Phoenix Suns and Dallas Mavericks. A Maverick win would have added more than $1 million to Piemonte’s account. DraftKings, which closed the acquisition of Golden Nugget Online Gaming at the beginning of May, offered him a cashback worth $364,344. Piemonte graciously turned down the generous offer in hopes of taking home all the money and going for the full glory.</p>
<p>Not a Complete Loss</p>
<p>After the Phoenix team took back a three-point lead at halftime, DraftKing’s cashback offer went down to $230,000. Ultimately, the Dallas Mavericks were defeated during the second half of the game. While losing the big bucks, Piemonte was still able to make a small hedge during halftime. He took back his original stake and even added a few extra thousand, so it wasn’t a total loss for the high roller.</p>
<p>Wishing for a bright future in the Piemonte car dealership family business, Marco studied at the National Automobile Dealers Association and received the mentorship of his father Al Piemonte. To this day, the high roller with a passion for cars keeps learning from his mother, while enjoying spending quality time with the family, attending Sunday football, and encouraging a relaxed work environment.</p>
