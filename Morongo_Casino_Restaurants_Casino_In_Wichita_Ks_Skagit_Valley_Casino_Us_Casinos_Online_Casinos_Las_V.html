<p>FC Porto has signed gambling operator and entertainment company Betano as the sports club’s official betting partner. The announcement was made on FC Porto’s official website.</p>
<p>Betano and FC Porto Sign a Betting Partnership Deal</p>
<p>The agreement currently covers only the present 2021-2022 football season. As per the deal, Betano will also be considered FC Porto’s handball team’s main sponsor and will have its logo represented on the dedicated main sponsor spot on the front of the athletes’ jerseys.</p>
<p>Porto Comercial’s director, Rui Lousa, spoke on the monumental importance of the deal to FC Porto. “This is an extremely important deal for us, as we are always looking at associating ourselves to strong partners, especially in a matter as important as this one,” Lousa said.</p>
<p>The director then explained that the two parties were quick to reach a mutually beneficial agreement and were both eager to sign the deal. On the behalf of the whole sports club, Lousa is pleased to have Betano as a betting sponsor and hopes that the partnership will be fruitful for everyone involved.</p>
<p>Panos Konstantopoulos, the chief marketing officer of Betano’s ownership company, Kaizen Gaming, confirmed Lousa’s words by saying that the operator is “thrilled to announce the partnership with FC Porto”, especially in light of the sports club’s rich history and victory trophies.</p>
<p>Konstantopoulos said Betano is looking forward to collaborating with FC Porto. He announced that the two newly-signed partners will be launching a variety of social initiatives in the future, as Betano usually does with all its partners.</p>
<p>“This sponsorship agreement shows, once again, the importance of the Portuguese market to Kaizen Gaming,” Konstantopoulos concluded.</p>
<p>Betano Expands on the Portuguese Sports Market</p>
<p>Betano has been eyeing the Portugal market and is especially focused on expanding its brand there this year. Other than FC Porto, Betano signed deals with five other sports club in the country, namely Benfica, Marítimo, SC Braga, Sporting CP and Os Belenenses.</p>
<p>The operator recently tried to replace NOS as a sponsor and sign a naming rights deal with the Primera Liga but was beat to it by Bwin. This has prompted a legal action that will see Betano and the Professional Football Federation trying to settle the case in court. Regardless of how the lawsuit plays out, Betano will retain a strong foothold in Portugal.</p>
<p>The operator also has a strong presence outside of Portugal. In the beginning, of 2021 it signed a sports betting license in Germany. At a later date, it became the official sponsor of Brazil’s Atletico Mineiro.</p>
<p>Betano is owned by the Kaizen Gaming group. The ownership company was formed in Greece in 2013 but has since grown substantially and currently operates internationally with offices in seven cities across Europe. Kaizen Gaming is a member of the ESSA Sports Betting Integrity.</p>
