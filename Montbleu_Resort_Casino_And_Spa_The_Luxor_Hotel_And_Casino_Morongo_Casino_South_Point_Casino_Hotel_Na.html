<p>Atlantic City’s network of live casinos suffered another downswing in October according to the latest results released by the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement (DGE).</p>
<p>Breaking down the latest financial happenings inside AC’s brick and mortar gaming venues, the DGE’s report didn’t make pleasant reading for those involved in the industry.</p>
<p>As a collective, AC’s eight live casinos experienced a 3.1 percent year-on-year decline in October, 2015.</p>
<p>Taking a closer look at the numbers, AC’s venues raked in $191.6 million compared to $197.7 million in October 2014.</p>
<p>Seasonal and Operational Changes</p>
<p>Despite being lower than expected, gaming experts insisted that the decline was due to seasonal factors and that fact it was the end of the summer.</p>
<p>However, it is important to note that October was the first fully comparable month with 2014. Between January and September, 2014, the AC casino community lost four venues which meant the year-on-year analysis has since had to be adjusted to account for the reduced number of operators.</p>
<p>However, the landscape hasn’t changed since October 2014 which means the drop in revenue is even more poignant as it represents a direct comparison between the past and the present.</p>
<p>Falling the hardest over the last 12 months according to the latest financial report was Caesars.</p>
<p>In 2014 the venue posted monthly takings of $30.2 million; however, just 12 months later the figure reported was 25.2 percent lower at $22.6 million.</p>
<p>Glimmers of Hope</p>
<p>While the overall picture was gloomy for Atlantic City, there were some patches of light that broke through.</p>
<p>The Borgata (10.5 percent), the Golden Nugget (10.6 percent), Resorts (21 percent) and the Tropicana (4.4 percent) all posted better numbers in 2015 than they did in 2014.</p>
<p>Additionally, things on the virtual side of the casino industry also showed signs of improvement in October. Accompanying the latest live casino report was a breakdown of the virtual world’s earnings.</p>
<p>In total New Jersey’s collection of online casino sites and pokers raked in $12.9 million during the month of October; an 8 percent increase on September’s takings. Earning the most and enjoying a 170 percent revenue increase was the Golden Nugget.</p>
<p>However, despite the Golden Nugget and its peers experiencing a 46 percent jump in revenue in October, the online poker industry continued to falter.</p>
<p>As outlined by the DGE’s report, online poker suffered a year-on-year drop of 3 percent after banking just $1.9 million.</p>
<p>Although that figure is better than the amount generated in September, 2015, it’s important to note that that month was the worst month in New Jersey’s iGaming history.</p>
<p>Gambling Atlantic City, moreover New Jersey, continues to move to its own beat.</p>
<p>Every positive seems to be tinged with a negative and every negative seems to be negated by a positive.</p>
<p>While there could be worse scenarios, it’s tough for those involved in the industry to get too excited about the state’s gaming future based on this dynamic.</p>
