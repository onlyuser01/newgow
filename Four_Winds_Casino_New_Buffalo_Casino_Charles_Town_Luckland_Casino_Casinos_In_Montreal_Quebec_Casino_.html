<p>(Philippines 6 March 2019): Only two weeks remain until the 2019 edition of the ASEAN Gaming Summit – held from 19-21 March 2019 at the Conrad Manila, Philippines.</p>
<p>Asia Gaming Brief, organizers of the conference, said the 2019 event is expected to be their biggest ever, with around 400 delegates expected over the three-days.</p>
<p>Key stakeholders in Asia’s gaming industry have already signed up as participants, including Belle Corporation, Caesars Entertainment, Crown Resorts, Melco Resorts, NagaCorp, Resorts World Manila, Thunderbird Resorts &amp; Casinos from the land-based sector, and companies such as Betcris, Ladbrokes Coral, LuckyNiki, MoPlay and Pinnacle from the online sector.</p>
<p>On Day 1 of the conference, delegates will be able to hear about the latest technology and innovations affecting land-based casinos, such as smart table technology, the evolution of slots, the future of ETGs and how the market has reacted to skill-based games from an operator’s perspective.</p>
<p>Attendees will also hear from famed entrepreneur and investor Jay Walker, Founder of Walker Digital, who will be speaking about the future of gaming, as well as Earle Hall of AXESNetwork, a TED-Talks professional speaker, who will discuss how blockchain can be used in land-based casinos today.</p>
<p>On Day 2 of the conference, delegates will take a deep dive into regulatory and economic developments across Asia’s key gaming jurisdictions, including Macau, Japan, Korea, Philippines, and Cambodia, just to name a few.</p>
<p>There will also be bonus sessions looking at the wider applications of blockchain in online gaming, and opportunities coming out of the U.S. sports betting market.</p>
<p>On Day 3, the organizers are running “closed-door roundtables” instead of the traditional conference format – catered to the online gaming industry. The day will be welcomed by President and COO of the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation, Alfredo Lim – who will be discussing what PAGCOR has been doing in the Philippines and their thoughts on the future.</p>
<p>Key roundtable discussions on Day 3 include: The Online Casino Roadmap, Innovation in Game Design, Asia Licensing, European Licensing Opportunities, Future of Asia Sports Betting and Betting on India – a $60 billion opportunity.</p>
<p>Of course, this year’s conference is supported by a roster of key industry suppliers, including eBET, Aristocrat, Asia Live Tech, Betradar, Scientific Games, Walker Digital and many more.</p>
<p>“The team is really excited to bring our 2019 edition of the ASEAN Gaming Summit to fruition. Everyone in the team has worked hard to bring industry heavy-weights onto the stage and to cover issues and topics that are at the forefront of our industry,” said Felix Ng, Conference Director at Asia Gaming Brief.</p>
<p>“We’ve also made sure that we provide a fun, and relaxed environment for delegates to network and form new business partnerships. In addition to our new ‘Chillax Lounge’ area, we’ll also be bringing back our line up of unforgettable networking parties, cocktail nights and poker tournaments throughout the three-day event,” he added.</p>
<p>Those who have not yet signed up for ASEAN Gaming Summit 2019 are encouraged to do so as soon as possible. Registrations are open until 18th March 2019.</p>
