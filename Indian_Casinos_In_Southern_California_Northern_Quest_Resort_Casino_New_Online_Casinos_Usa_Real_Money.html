    <h1>Indian Casinos In Southern California Northern Quest Resort Casino New Online Casinos Usa Real Money</h1>

<p>With sweepstakes quite popular around the United States, the Arizona Lottery has become the latest to launch its dedicated solution</p>
<p>The Lucky Lounge platform is now going to introduce players in the state to all sorts of exciting games to enjoy. To participate, there is no need to use real money, as the sweepstakes entries are usually free, and players can even earn tokens and win cash prizes all the same.</p>
<p>Presently, Lucky Lounge comes with four fun and easy-to-play games that are a mix between lottery games and popular app store games. The lottery advertises its games as whimsical, but also a good chance to test player luck. Commenting on this rollout, Arizona Lottery executive director Alec Esteban said:</p>
<p>We are excited to introduce everyone to Lucky Lounge, the first lottery product of its kind designed to engage players with an online sweepstakes experience that provides many ways to win with the Arizona Lottery. Arizona Lottery executive director Alec Esteban</p>
<p>He hailed the lottery team for coming together to develop this new product and offer players something that they have never seen before.</p>
<p>Arizona Lottery Gets More Exciting with Sweepstakes</p>
<p>The arrival of the sweepstakes model opens brand new opportunities for players to enjoy their favorite games.</p>
<p>Players who wish to join Lucky Lounge can do so by simply signing up for a Players Club account. The sweepstake tokens are used as the currency in Lucky Lounge and allow players to enter various cash contests.</p>
<p>The tokens can be won by playing games or by purchasing the said tokens, although there is no obligation to spend any real money which is at the core of the sweepstakes offer. Logging daily will see players get 50 free tokens which will be enough to get them started. There will be weekly, bi-weekly, and monthly drawings that will feature prizes of up to $10,000.</p>
<p>Players can also redeem up to 1,440 tokens daily, introducing them to even more ways to increase their holdings and add to their bankroll. The Arizona Lottery has urged players to download the Players Club app on their mobile devices as this will allow players to enter drawings and play games quicker and more comfortably.</p>
