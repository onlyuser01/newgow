<p>Liverpool Looking Unbeatable</p>
<p>The Premier League title has probably slipped from their hands, but the Merseyside Reds still have a chance to win another two trophies this season. They’ve already won the EFL Cup and are playing in the final of the Champions League (against Real Madrid). Before that, they also have a chance to win the FA Cup.</p>
<p>Oddsmakers see Liverpool as the favorite to win on Saturday, the main reason being that this team’s been in a fabulous run. Liverpool has lost just one game since December. The best thing is that most of Liverpool’s players are fit and ready for the big game.</p>
<p>Roberto Firmino is the only player who’s listed as injured. However, his absence probably isn’t going to hurt Liverpool too much, as he’s been playing a sort of a backup role this season. The proof of this is that there are three other forwards who have scored more goals than the Liverpool no.9 – Mohamed Salah, Sadio Mane, and Diogo Jota.</p>
<p>Struggling Chelsea Hoping to Salvage the Season</p>
<p>The Blues have won only five points in their previous five EPL games. The only team they defeated during that period is West Ham, while we saw them lose to Everton and Arsenal. Further, they also played a draw with Manchester United, as well as with Wolves.</p>
<p>The 2-2 draw with Wolves was their most recent game. It was played on their turf, meaning that one can think of the result as a failure.</p>
<p>One of the reasons behind Chelsea’s unimpressive run is that this team has some injury problems in the center of the pitch. N’Golo Kante, Jorginho, and Callum Hudson-Odoi are listed as injured ahead of the FA Cup Final.</p>
<p>Liverpool vs Chelsea Prediction</p>
<p>Online sportsbooks see Liverpool as the favorite in the FA Cup Final. It’s no surprise as this team looks great at the moment. The Reds do have other things on their mind but winning the FA Cup is certainly one of their top priorities.</p>
<p>Pick: Liverpool to win; over 2.5 goals</p>
