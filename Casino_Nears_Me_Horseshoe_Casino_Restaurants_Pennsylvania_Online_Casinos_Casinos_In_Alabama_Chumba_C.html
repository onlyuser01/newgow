<p>As the new ambassador for esports, Marcelo Coldzera would be tasked to support the company’s efforts to engage with esports fans and gain popularity in social media networks.</p>
<p>“Marcelo will help us with communication – it is very important that esports pros share their inspiring experience with fans. Welcome aboard, amigo! Let’s make the esport planet spin faster!” Stepan Shulga, Head of Esports, Parimatch</p>
<p>In an interview with the head of esports at Parimatch, Marcelo Coldzera expressed his feelings related to his appointment as the esport brand ambassador of the betting technology company.</p>

<p>Coldzera then outlined his knowledge for Parimatch as being a responsible and “truly immersed in esports” company, which contributes a lot to technology and entertainment.

<p>Parimatch and Esports</p>
<p>The presence of the global betting technology supplier in the world of esports began in August 2018 when it teamed up with Russian esports organization Virtus.Pro, and the deal which utilized Virtus.Pro’s Dota 2 and CS:GO teams was extended in December 2019 to run throughout 2020.</p>
<p>The company which started in 1994 has a history of being the official partner to the biggest Counter-Strike competition in Ukraine Logitech G National Cybersports League (NCL) and the EPICENTER CS:GO tournament.</p>
<p>Parimatch even launched its own DOTA 2 competition, Parimatch League, and after the successful completion of it, the tech company went on to initiate an online league for Counter Strike: Global Offensive teams, Parimatch League CS:GO.</p>
<p>Parimatch’s efforts to strengthen ties with the esports community got a significant boost in December last year when the betting technology firm announced a 2-year global partnership with Fnatic, a leading esports organization with more than 200 championships across 30 different games.</p>
