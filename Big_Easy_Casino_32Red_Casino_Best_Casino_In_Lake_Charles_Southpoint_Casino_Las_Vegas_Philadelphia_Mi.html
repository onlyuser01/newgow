<p>BetAmerica and Others Still Out Two Weeks After SBTech Cyberattack, DraftKings Merger Terms Revised</p>
<p>Posted on: April 9, 2020, 05:10h.</p>

<p>Almost two weeks after sports betting and lottery provider SBTech was hit by a cyberattack that forced it to shut down its global data centers, several US-regulated online gambling sites remain out of action.</p>

<p>The length of the outage is unprecedented for the industry. Online gaming operators have routinely been targeted by cybercriminals since at least the early 2000s, but these are usually short-lived DDoS attacks, designed to temporarily disrupt normal services while companies are held to ransom.</p>
<p>As of Thursday evening, Churchill Downs’ BetAmerica — which relies on SBTech software for all its online services, including sports betting and casino — was still offline, leaving customers unable to access their funds.</p>
<p>The online sports betting arms of the Golden Nugget and Resorts Atlantic City are also still down.</p>
<p>But SBTech’s European partners, such as MansionBet, are now back online, as is the Oregon Lottery’s “Scoreboard” sports betting app.</p>
<p>Diamond Eagle Demands $30 Million</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Diamond Eagle Acquisition Corp (DEAC) demanded SBTech set aside $30 million in cash and stock that could be used to settle any litigation that might arise from the outage.</p>
<p>DEAC is a Los Angeles-based acquisition vehicle, which will merge with DraftKings to engineer the forthcoming reverse takeover of SBTech, paving the way for an IPO.</p>
<p>According to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), if claims against SBTech exceed $30 million, DEAC would gain access to around $70 million in cash and shares that have already been put in escrow, per the terms of the original deal.</p>
<p>And if that’s not enough to settle future claims, DEAC would go after SBTech’s current owners, including founder and majority shareholder Shalom McKenzie, who has agreed to the amended terms.</p>
<p>Cryptoviral Extortion</p>
<p>The timing of the attack, just a few weeks before the DraftKings merger was expected to complete, is striking and bears the hallmarks of a ransomware attack launched by a sophisticated criminal group.</p>
<p>Cryptoviral extortion involves the encryption of a victim’s files, which renders them inaccessible until a ransom is paid or cybersecurity teams manage to regain control.</p>
<p>With the merger date looming, attackers may have believed SBTech would be more susceptible to paying ransom demands to help smooth the deal.</p>
<p>But the duration of the outage, and the piecemeal resumption of services would seem to suggest the company has been fighting the extortion attempt.</p>
<p>Diamond Eagle shareholders were scheduled to vote on the merger April 9, but that meeting has been postponed until next week.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, sources told iGaming Business Thursday that the deal was still expected to complete on schedule.</p>
