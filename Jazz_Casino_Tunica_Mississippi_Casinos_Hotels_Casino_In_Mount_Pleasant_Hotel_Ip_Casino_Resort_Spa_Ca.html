<p>Sports technology company FansUnite Entertainment announced today it signed an engagement letter with prominent gaming law firm Ifrah Law PLLC to ensure its collaboration with OneComply would provide assistance to FansUnite’s licensing strategy in the US.</p>
<p>Pursuing Rapid Expansion</p>
<p>Due to the interest gambling and casino operators in the US showed for the sports betting and iGaming solutions provided by the Canadian company, FansUnite will pursue a rapid expansion strategy starting with New Jersey, and Jeff Ifrah, a founding member of the law firm, will provide counsel with regards to legal matters in each jurisdiction.</p>
<p>“Jeff and his team are a great addition to the global legal team that we have assembled to oversee the delivery of FansUnite’s offerings.” Scott Burton, CEO, FansUnite</p>
<p>Ranked nationally in Gaming &amp; Licensing Law by Chambers USA, Jeff Ifrah is an accomplished lawyer with excellent reputation, having dealt with major prosecutions and lawsuits related to the iGaming industry in North America.</p>
<p>“We’re excited to onboard FansUnite at Ifrah Law to help guide their licensing strategy in the U.S. market.” Jeff Ifrah, Founding Member, Ifrah Law</p>
<p>With focus on regulated online sports betting and iGaming products, FansUnite’s ambitious 2021 expansion plans include entry into multiple US states starting with New Jersey, and Jeff Ifrah is expected to play a key role for the licensing process with his extensive experience and industry expertise.</p>
<p>“With a long-standing career as a prominent attorney in gaming law, Jeff will accelerate our expansion into the highly complex U.S. betting and iGaming market.” Scott Burton, CEO, FansUnite</p>
<p>Assist OneComply and Streamline Legal Process</p>
<p>Ifrah’s efforts will further support OneComply, a partner he had already worked with on numerous occasions, to streamline the legal process and ensure a seamless entry into the US for FansUnite.</p>
<p>“We’ve been following FansUnite’s recent growth and we look forward to working with their team to expand their footprint into the U.S. market.” Jeff Ifrah, Founding Member, Ifrah Law</p>
<p>Licensing specialist OneComply leverages decades of regulatory experience in state-regulated industries to allow businesses to manage many license applications via a single source of application, boosting accuracy and security of information, as well as the speed of delivery for the creation of the different applications.</p>
<p>Having received its operational licenses in Malta and the EU, FansUnite switched its focus towards the lucrative North American market and partnered with licensing specialist OneComply last month to ensure OneComply’s license application services will support efforts aimed at entering North American gaming jurisdictions.</p>
