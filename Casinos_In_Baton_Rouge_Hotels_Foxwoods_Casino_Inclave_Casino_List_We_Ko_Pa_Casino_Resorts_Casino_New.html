<p>The Maltese iGaming company KaFe Rocks, as well as its Time2play brand, have decided to demonstrate their devotion to their employees by offering them an unlimited number of holiday days on top of access to mental health support. This new initiative will be executed with the help of the mental health charity Richmond Foundation.</p>
<p>KaFe Rocks Offers Workers Unlimited Holidays</p>
<p>Cordelia Morgan Cooper, the head of people at KaFe Rocks, spoke about the employee-oriented changes that the company will be implementing. She explained that a healthy work-life balance for the Rocketeers (as KaFe Rocks’ employees are known) is a core pillar of the firm’s philosophy. Because of this, Cooper said that the company is more than willing to support people and allow them to take time off when they want.</p>
<p>“At our core is trust, passion, and accountability, and so moving to this model made perfect sense to us,” she explained.</p>
<p>Cooper elaborated that the people team she’s leading will work closely with leaders within the business to make sure that the Rocketeers have enough time to rest, recuperate and enjoy some time out.</p>
<p>Currently, the Rocketeers number a total of 160 people around the world. Some of them are working in one of KaFe Rocks’ properties, and others have been allowed to work fully remotely. The addition of unlimited holidays will be a welcome one for the on-site workers and remote workers alike.</p>
<p>Mental Health Help Will Be Provided to Those Who Need It</p>
<p>Other than prioritizing its employees’ health and allowing them to rest when they need it, KaFe Rocks has vowed to further help those in need by ensuring access to mental health support for all its workers. This will be done with the help of the mental health charity Richmond Foundation.</p>
<p>To top it, KaFe Rocks employees in Malta will be able to schedule face-to-face sessions with professionals who will help them get their lives back together.</p>
<p>For Cooper, this initiative is crucial. She recognizes that many remote employees lack the same amount of interaction, and that’s why the firm wants to give the Rocketeers “the tools to be happy and healthy both in and out of work.”</p>
<p>KaFe Rocks philosophy currently is to support all of its employees and nurture a healthy workplace where everyone is happy to contribute. While the company’s approach isn’t the most orthodox, it’s definitely interesting to see how it works out and whether it will affect the overall productivity within the firm.</p>
<p>A few months ago, KaFe Rocks’ Time2play firm became the “new home” of Twitch’s gambling streamers after the streaming platform prohibited referral codes and links. This was yet another demonstration of KaFe Rocks’ commitment to innovation and appealing to younger audiences.</p>
