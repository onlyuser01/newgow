    <h1>Casino Online Singapore Palace Station Hotel And Casino Las Vegas Chotaw Casino Casino Royale Theme</h1>

<p>Dear Team,</p>
<p>on the 27. of July 2022 I set a wager Limit over 1CAD per day.</p>
<p>Betsofa Confirmed the Wagerlimit is set and they confirmed via Email (Attached) I would be not able to decrease the limit the next 7 days for protection reason.</p>
<p>In they terms its nothing written regarding the rule of the wager limit, so I trusted the email.</p>
<p>I had a pending withdrawal over 1800CAD.</p>
<p>Next day in the chat I ve asked to remove the limit of course I would like to continue gaming. They chat confirmed it will be possible to remove it after 3 days.</p>
<p>On the 31.th of July they removed the limit from the side, I never confirmed special and also to be aware about the consequences, also I did not read the chat proper I ve trusted still the Email.</p>
<p>I was able to play on the 31th of July my pending withdrawal and also I deposit more then 3200CAD and loss them.</p>
<p>I raised a complaint to my Casino VIP Account manager that I am serious unhappy because I received and confirmation with different informations.</p>
<p>She promise me she will have a look in this case, but honestly she did not really care.</p>
<p>She confirmed they had technical difficulties and now its fixed (Of course 7 days) not a days earlier.</p>
<p>I asked them to refund the money. They did not, also they don't wanna know anything about it.</p>
<p>I am seroius schoked how Betsofa Casino is handling such an important topic and a casino who is one of the best on the market.</p>
<p>Also they confirmed they had technical problems and of course confusing different confirmation by email and chat, but the costumer had to pay it is unbeliable.</p>
<p>I want the funds back what I was speeded 2 days earlier as they confirmed.</p>
<p>Thanks for your support.</p>
