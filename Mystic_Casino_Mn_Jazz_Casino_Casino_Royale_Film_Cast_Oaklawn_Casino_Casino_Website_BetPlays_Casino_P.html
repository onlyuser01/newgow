    <h1>Mystic Casino Mn Jazz Casino Casino Royale Film Cast Oaklawn Casino Casino Website BetPlays Casino P</h1>

<p>We have checked with the operator and found the following:</p>
<p>You registered on their website on 03/12/2022. Since then, you have deposited a total of 3007.00 CAD and withdrawn 3128.00 CAD. (so you are at a win here)</p>
<p>On August 24, 2023, you deposited 505.00 CAD and received a 100% bonus (505.00 CAD).</p>
<p>You then made Under/Over market bets and repeat bets. Your winnings were obtained with bonus funds from Under/Over bets and repeated bets on the same event/market that violated the following Bonus Terms and Conditions:</p>
<p>17.4. Only one bet can be placed per event once there is an active bonus in your BetPlays account. If we detect such activity, all winnings and bonuses will be canceled, the account will be suspended and the payment will not be processed.</p>
<p>17.5 The following types of bets do not count towards meeting the wagering requirement: Starting Price (SP) bets, any type of handicap, no draw bets, system bets, over/under bets, void/canceled/red value bets, drawn amount bets or bets made with a free bet.</p>
<p>7.6. www.betplays.com will review all player Accounts and classify them at its discretion. Once a player is classified as a "bonus hunter" or "bonus abuser", all winnings and bonuses will be void and the Account will be suspended and the payment not processed.</p>
<p>We do not see a reason to hold them accountable as they acted in between their Terms and conditions.</p>
<hr />
<p>I was informed something else when the withdrawal was cancelled now they are changing their reasoning, This company invited me to use a bonus specifically, and now are callling me bonus hunter.</p>
<p>I could not have requested a withdrawal if the rollover requirements were not met.</p>
<p>Asked very clearly in the communication with vip@betplays.com, they informed the odds are just required to be 1.75 or more.</p>
<p>They have kept my deposit of 505, and winnings generated from my own cash was 1700 and 2900 was the winnings from bonus funds. When the rollover was completed these balances were merged and available for withdrawal and I was informed by their company to try to withdraw and then use the bonus free play of 100.00 CA$ as per the offer there is record of this chat with the operator.</p>
