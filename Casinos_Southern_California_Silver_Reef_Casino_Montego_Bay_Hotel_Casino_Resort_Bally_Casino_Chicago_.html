<p>EGBA has released its latest report on how its members have contributed to reducing problem gambling rates in 2022</p>
<p>The European Gaming and Betting Association (EGBA) has said that its members have been able to remit more than 45.5 million messages that promoted safer gambling to their customers. These messages are unique as they are not just smartly trying to raise awareness about the issue of problem gambling but also send messages that are calibrated to individual consumer needs.</p>
<p>EGBA Commits to More Personalized Gambling Messaging</p>
<p>At least 48% of these messages were personalized, which further strengthened their impact on consumers. The level of personalization has gone up considerably over the past years and marked a 40% jump year-over-year. As the Sustainability Report 2022/2023 outlines, there has been a significant effort on all levels to ensure that the messages transmitted to consumers are tailored to protect them.</p>
<p>EGBA Secretary General Maarten Haijer welcomed the results and their significance. He continued by saying:</p>
<p>We’re delighted that our members continue to make positive progress in their efforts to promote safer gambling. This is all part of their commitment to put a sustainable approach to gambling at the heart of what they do. EGBA Secretary General Maarten Haijer</p>
<p>He hailed the collective efforts of the association and its members which are bringing consumers closer to safety and promoting a sustainable industry in which everyone is protected. The takeaway from 2022 was that customer accounts increased to 31.2% million or a 5% gain in the numbers.</p>
<p>According to the association, 74% of all customers were male and 26% of all customers were female. The prevalent customer age of group was those aged 26-35 followed by those 36-50. Both categories posted numbers close to each other.</p>
<p>Tailored Approach and Interventions to Prevent Harm</p>
<p>EGBA hailed the personalized and safer gambling messages in general and said that 51% of those customers that received intervention actually reduced their financial losses in the three-month period immediately after the said intervention. EGBA’s members continued to seek and intervene in the cases of those customers that didn’t experience loss reduction.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, 76% of all EGBA members received responsible gambling training, indicating that the association is all but committed to protecting consumers. EGBA also posted the numbers of those members that contributed to problem gambling research, education, and treatment across Europe, with the total amount reaching €49 million ($55 million), or a 109% gain.</p>
