    <h1>No Deposit Casino Codes Cryptoleo Casino Wisconsin Casinos Map Lake Charles Casino Chinook Winds Cas</h1>

<p>Hello, I answer your questions:</p>
<p>Are these your first withdrawal requests at this casino?</p>
<p>Yes they are the first 2 made</p>
<p>Could you please advise if your account is already verified and if yes, since when exactly?</p>
<p>The account was verified when I requested the first one, and this was confirmed by mail on June 6 after requesting the documentation. In fact, they confirmed the first transfer on June 7 and the second on June 11. Through chat they assured me that I would receive them in a maximum of 3-5 business days, and I have the screenshots. In fact, they assured me that last Wednesday I would be the first and at most today the second, but it is not like that. I have asked them to give me the information to track the transfers but they do not provide it, and they no longer answer my emails and the chat appears disabled.</p>
<p>Did you accumulate your winnings with real money or did you use a bonus? Only with real money, I did not use any type of bonus</p>
<p>When was the last time you talked to the casino and what was it about?</p>
<p>I've been talking all week claiming that the first transfer that should have arrived on Tuesday didn't arrive, but they don't give me evasions and just tell me that everything is ok on their part. I have asked for the identifier, originator, account of origin and amounts that have been transferred to be able to trace it in the bank but they do not provide me with the information.</p>
<p>I enclose a screenshot of the chats where they assured me that I would be there but it was not like that, to the last emails where I ask for information to track the transfers they do not answer me or give me the information, and in the chat they tell me to keep waiting. I think it's a scam and they don't want to pay me.</p>
