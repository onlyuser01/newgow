<p>Big Time Gaming’s iconic Megaways mechanic will find a new home with 3 Oaks Gaming becoming the latest licensed studio allowed to use and integrate the bespoke feature into its own products.</p>
<p>BTG‘s Megaways Arrives on 3 Oaks’ Games</p>
<p>3 Oaks Gaming will be able to introduce the Megaways option to slots that it develops moving forward as well as integrate it with some of its older titles that are still player hits or can benefit from a new lease of life.</p>
<p>The feature offers players a whopping 117,649 ways to win and is one of the most popular options out there. Big Time Gaming has been able to license the product to a number of leading studios, as well, including NetEnt.</p>
<p>Megaways’ addition to 3 Oaks Gaming’s lineup will provide the studio with a new and powerful marketing tool that will resonate with global audiences, the company believes. Licensed by the Isle of Man, 3 Oaks Gaming wants to continue providing its products across regulated markets.</p>
<p>The coming months will be focused on the further development of new products that will reinforce 3 Oaks Gaming’s portfolio and provide the supplier with a stronger selection of titles to deliver across the board with others.</p>
<p>No Stopping Progress</p>
<p>3 Oaks will be focusing on global growth in the months to come as well. Speaking on this occasion, the company managing director, Sebastian Damian, said that he was extremely pleased to be incorporating the Big Time Gaming’s renowned feature into 3 Oaks’ own product lineup. He added:</p>
<p>“The mechanic’s popularity shows no signs of slowing down and continues to be in demand from players across various jurisdictions. The addition of Megaways will propel our offering to a new level and ensure 3 Oaks Gaming becomes an important source of content for operators across regulated markets.”</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Kalamba became the latest company to gain access to the Megaways feature and incorporate it into its own product lineup and portfolio.</p>
