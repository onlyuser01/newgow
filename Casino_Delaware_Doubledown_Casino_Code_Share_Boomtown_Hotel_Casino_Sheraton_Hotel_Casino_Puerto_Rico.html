    <h1>Casino Delaware Doubledown Casino Code Share Boomtown Hotel Casino Sheraton Hotel Casino Puerto Rico</h1>

<p>I've been using Bitstamp for many years. I'm not sure whether it's the best one, but they're known for low fees. But as far as I can remember, I had to take a selfie video and even say some numbers on the screen loudly in order to get verified ðŸ˜€</p>
<p>I remember Revolut wanted to see my tax return for previous. It took them 14 days to review it, then they suddenly increased my yearly transaction limit from 200 EUR to about 200 000 EUR. I did about 1-2 transactions there per month. The amounts were usually around 10-20 pounds. Then I got blocked for no reason for more than a month. Then they said I need to transfer all the money out and my account will be closed permanently. I requested to transfer the remaining balance back to my bank account. They declined it about 5 times and when I tried that again for the 6th time, it went through. It took about 14 more days. The account remained open. Apparently, someone forgot to close it ðŸ˜€</p>
<p>To sum it up. I don't recommend Revolut to anyone.</p>
