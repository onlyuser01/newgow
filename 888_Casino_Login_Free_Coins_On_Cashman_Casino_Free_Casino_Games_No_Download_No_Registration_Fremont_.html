    <h1>888 Casino Login Free Coins On Cashman Casino Free Casino Games No Download No Registration Fremont</h1>

<p>On the 21st of July I won and cashed out, I then knew about the term that said you can’t use coupons while its pending, I tried to redeem and it worked, other times if I redeemed too many or something like that it would stop me.so when it let me Horray I could carry on playing. 3 days later the money was in my account.</p>
<p>A week later, same thing. Played, won, cashed, coupons coupons coupons coupons. All good fun. Few days later I got my money. So in my mind if it let me redeem the coupon no problem.</p>
<p>On the 4th of August I was super lucky and kept winning. I eventually cashed out at R10750. In my life this was a life changing amount. Once I cashed I claimed my daily spins and had some fun. The next day I received an email to say that my winning were voided due to playing coupons.</p>
<p>My concern was why now when the precedent had been set when previous cashouts were allowed.</p>
<p>Thus began my soul sucking experience.</p>
<p>One of the Consultants confirmed that the other two payouts with coupons used while they were pending were an over sight on their part, he said this after he went to check.</p>
<p>All say sorry, maybe you will be lucky again.</p>
<p>I spoke to supervisors and call centre people who said that there is no way I would have been paid out if I had a coupon pending. Then I was fed up and getting nowhere. I googled how to handle such disputes and saw this ON SPRINGBOKS WEBSITE:</p>
<p>Make use of the Central Dispute System - If your issue cannot be resolved with the help of the customer support team and it revolves around the payment of winnings, we advise you to make use of the onsite Central Dispute System (CDS). It’s a player-oriented payout investigation program unique to all Real Time Gaming casinos. Provided you submit your claim through the online application form within 60 days of the dispute taking place, CDS will investigate the claim on your behalf.</p>
<p>Awesome, I though now it can get sorted. Click on the link on their page fill in and when I submits its an error. I went to the website to try and fill in the form there but Springbok is not an option on the drop down menu. That’s fishy. I asked them about it and no one could answer, even now this question is still dodged by them.</p>
<p>Yesterday 12/09 they all of a sudden have record that I was granted courtesy. This is untrue.</p>
<p>I asked them to send transcripts on 3 ocassions, one sent a conversation between her and someone else, Liam didn’t send at all and the other was received. I last night asked for the full set of transcripts to be sent to me, I was told they could only send the current as the rest was against policy.</p>
<p>My main issues</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If it paid out twice even though I played coupons why not now. A Precedent was set.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why do much of their call centre people know nothing of CDS</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why do they claim to be registered with them if they not</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why are they changing stories</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why do they not stop you from redeeming a coupon if you not supposed to, like it does with all the others</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I must remember a million different terms and conditions but thgey don’t know what CDS is.</p>
