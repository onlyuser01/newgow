<p>Recently disclosed private discussions between the government and vested interest groups regarding the fate of gambling advertising bans have caused controversy</p>
<p>Tim Costello, chief advocate for the Alliance for Gambling Reform, highlighted the importance of a gaming ad ban as Australia keeps struggling with a surge in problem gambling. He warned that clandestine talks behind closed doors could herald a potential compromise on the landmark parliamentary inquiry’s recommendations for gradually phasing out gambling advertising within three years.</p>
<p>A Lack of Transparency Raises Lobbying Concerns</p>
<p>Recently uncovered documents have unveiled closed-door dialogues between gambling entities, broadcasters, sporting codes, and global tech companies with Communications Minister Michelle Rowland and her staff. These talks centered on responding to proposals for a complete wagering advertising ban. Costello notes that stakeholders likely felt threatened by the measure and sought to apply pressure against it.</p>
<p>The involvement of prominent gambling companies like Sportsbet, Crown, Betfair, Tabcorp, and others in these private meetings has raised skepticism about the transparency and integrity of the decision-making process. Costello questioned the nature of the information shared behind closed doors and the validity of claims presented by these stakeholders, emphasizing the necessity for transparency in such discussions.</p>
<p>Australia has a huge blind spot when it comes to gambling and the immense harm it causes in the community. Tim Costello</p>
<p>Speaking for The Sydney Morning Herald, Costello lamented the discreet discussions as Minister Peta Murphy, the inquiry’s chair, worked exhaustively until her recent unfortunate passing due to cancer. Murphy’s dedication culminated in a comprehensive report featuring 31 recommendations to curb the detrimental impact of online gambling and advertising on society. However, a compromise with the broader industry could jeopardize her vision.</p>
<p>Problem Gambling Remains a Pressing Issue</p>
<p>Highlighting the magnitude of gambling-related harm in Australia, with an annual loss exceeding $25 billion, Costello underscored the urgency to address this issue. He stressed the need for the government to honor the recommendations set forth by the multi-party parliamentary inquiry, resisting undue lobbying pressures from the gambling industry.</p>
<p>Moreover, he urged Australian lawmakers to heed the public sentiment, backed by polls indicating over 70% support for a gambling advertising ban. While Costello noted that ignoring industry recommendations could be counterproductive, he once again urged for transparency, highlighting the industry’s significant financial influence in various sectors as it defends its interests.</p>
<p>Now is time to resist the pressure and back-door lobbying by big gambling and other vested interests. Tim Costello</p>
<p>As the government prepares to unveil its response to the Murphy inquiry, Costello implores new measures to reduce gambling-related harm, focusing on advertisement restrictions. He noted that gaming should face similar restrictions to tobacco and alcohol due to its widespread negative societal impact. The Australian government’s response should set the tone for its future gambling-related policy and hopefully dispel any integrity doubts.</p>
