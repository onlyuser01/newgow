<p>Betsson Now Live in the City and Province of Buenos Aires</p>
<p>Swedish-based gambling group Betsson AB continued to strengthen its presence in Latin America following the announcement its online casino is now live in both the City and Province of Buenos Aires, Argentina.</p>
<p>Local Operator Partnership Strategy</p>
<p>The launch of Betsson.com.ar gambling website covering the City of Buenos Aires happened on January 6, 2022, following a decision by the City Lottery (LOTBA) to grant the operator a license, while in the Province, the brand went live via Betsson.bet.ar on January 27 after obtaining a license from the Provincial Institute of Lottery and Casinos (IPLyC).</p>
<p>“The launch in Argentina signifies yet another milestone in LatAm and further strengthens Betsson’s market presence in the region. The license for the Province of Buenos Aires, together with the license for the City of Buenos Aires, cement our position in the region.” Pontus Lindwall, CEO, Betsson AB</p>
<p>Both websites are now live, offering online betting on sports, both pre-match and live wagering, online casino gambling such as slots and table games, as well as horse racing, while signifying Betsson’s vision to provide the best customer service in the industry.</p>
<p>The brand launched its operations in the City and Province of Buenos Aires in a partnership with leading land-based operator Casino de Victoria, part of Grupo Martone, to once again affirm its growth strategy to expand operations in Latin America via agreements with local operators.</p>
<p>“LatAm is a strategically important region where we are performing well and we have great ambitions for the future in Argentina.” Pontus Lindwall, CEO, Betsson AB</p>
<p>Unlike land-based gambling, the online market in Argentina is in its nascent days and presents Betsson with a huge potential for growth by utilizing its proprietary sportsbook on a robust technology platform, while in the online casino space, the brand’s offering featuring a vast portfolio of games and permanent drive for innovation ensures the next level of gaming experience.</p>
<p>Utilizing Casino de Victoria’s local market expertise and Betsson’s digital know-how and technical capabilities, the partnership is seeking to establish itself as a market leader in the online gambling space that is expected to rapidly grow.</p>
<p>Growing Latin American Presence</p>
<p>The launches further strengthened the brand’s footprint in Latin America, building on existing Betsson presence in Mexico, Peru and Colombia.</p>
<p>Similar to Argentina, in Mexico Betsson partnered with Big Bola Casinos, a land-based operator of 20 casinos across the country and perceived by the Mexican people as one of the leading gambling groups nationwide.</p>
<p>In Peru, Betsson acquired the online assets of local sportsbook and casino operator Inkabet in a deal worth $25 million to mark its fourth acquisition deal in the region following acquisitions of Colbet in Colombia, Suaposta in Brazil and payment provider JDP Tech.</p>
<p>Last month, Colbet’s general director announced the brand was ready to go live in the country and would undergo a shedding to assume the group’s core brand name Betsson.</p>
