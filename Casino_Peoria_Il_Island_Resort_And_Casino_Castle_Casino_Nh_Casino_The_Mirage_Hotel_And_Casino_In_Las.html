    <h1>Casino Peoria Il Island Resort And Casino Castle Casino Nh Casino The Mirage Hotel And Casino In Las</h1>

<p>Online casino brand Wishmaker will have its player engagement boosted via integration with the real-time player engagement solution platform provided by Fast Track.</p>
<p>“We are really keen on harmonising Wishmaker with our other brands and using Fast Track’s solution to optimise performance.” Maria Boelius, Head of Casino Operations, Spiffbet</p>
<p>Spiffbet Integrates Wishmaker with Fast Track</p>
<p>Malta-based CRM solutions supplier Fast Track expanded an existing partnership with Swedish-based gaming operator Spiffbet to allow the operator’s newly acquired casino brand Wishmaker to utilize Fast Track’s real-time data and automation capabilities and enhance experience for its players.</p>
<p>“We are happy to say that we are very pleased with the solution that Fast Track delivers and we are looking forward to unlocking additional value of future acquisitions together with Fast Track.” Maria Boelius, Head of Casino Operations, Spiffbet</p>
<p>The Wishmaker casino brand was launched in 2018 by a bunch of casino-lovers with a passion for new adventures and top-notch casino gambling and ever since, the brand has been focusing on using technology to provide players with great experiences, offering rich game features and a loyalty scheme to keep players engaged.</p>
<p>“I am personally excited to be partnering with Wishmaker, who have been so invested in using the right technology to deliver experiences for their players.” Christopher Hirst, Co-Founder and Chief Commercial Officer, Fast Track</p>
<p>Brand Harmonization</p>
<p>The current agreement to integrate the casino brand “born ready to thrill, excite, and reward” to Fast Track places the brand next to Spiffbet’s another two brands, Cashmio and Buster Banks, which also use the real-time player engagement solution.</p>
<p>“We are also pleased to be extending our relationship with Spiffbet, having worked with several of their brands for over the last two years.” Christopher Hirst, Co-Founder and Chief Commercial Officer, Fast Track</p>
<p>The deal with the acquired from Maltese company Dreamplex casino brand also includes a new initiative set to launch next year which will make machine learning accessible to operators.</p>
