<p>Ilya, the name of the aggregators is actually confidential information and it is not known to the technical support chat staff precisely because of confidentiality. But this does not mean that our company and the relevant specialists do not know the services of which payment aggregator the company used when conducting a particular transaction. In the chat on the site, they could say about "the unknown" in a certain context and there is no difficulty in this. Regarding the fact that our specialists contacted the bank, this is not entirely correct information, the operator was mistaken. Therefore, in order to avoid such misunderstandings, I suggest you communication on this forum. In the chat, in any case, they will not be able to speed up the process of resolving the current issue or influence the answers of payment systems, but here this issue is controlled until it is completely resolved by us and the administration of the forum, which can also express its opinion on the controversial issue</p>
<p>Also, you do not need and do not have the opportunity to apply on your own to the payment system for the reasons described above in this discussion. Your bank can make a request to the beneficiary's bank and receive all the information necessary for the return, if such a return is possible. Your bank knows the RRN of the transaction and it is by it that it can be identified in the beneficiary's bank system. If about info that you need to know through which payment aggregator the payment was made in order to return funds, you were informed by the same technical support chat employee who said that the bank did not have information about RRN - you should request information directly from the bank. Namely - "if the deposit was unsuccessful on the recipient's side, then what are the conditions and terms for the return of funds?". Specialists of the bank branch or competent support staff will be able to give you a correct answer to such a question. For our part, we do not stop working on your situation, but only inform about the stages. Please wait for an answer on the task by email or in this discussion and now contact your bank again to clarify the possibility of a refund. If you have any questions about the current situation - write in this discussion please, we will answer everything as it is and at what stage we are currently</p>
