<p>The innovative and fast-growing provider of content for the global gambling industry, Wazdan, expanded further its European footprint after announcing a new partnership. On Friday, the company confirmed it joined forces with INBET for the regulated gambling market in Bulgaria.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the new deal, Wazdan agreed to deliver content for the operator, strengthening its position in the country. The company said that its content will be introduced in batches and the initial launch will include games such as Choco Reels, 9 Lions, Larry the Leprechaun, as well as Great Book of Magic Delux.</p>
<p>Moreover, Wazdan explained that in the upcoming months, more games will be added such as Magic Spins, 9 Coins, Dwarf Fortune and Power of Gods: Egypt. Besides the engaging games, INBET will also benefit from Wazdan's solutions that are proven to boost customer engagement. Per the new deal, the operator will tap into the company's Player Engagement Suite, allowing it to leverage Collect to Infinity, Hold the Jackpot and Cash Infinity, mechanics that are proven to boost revenue.</p>
<p>Vanina Yanakieva, INBET's Casino Manager, shared her excitement in a statement saying: "We are delighted to welcome Wazdan as our latest slot games partner." She explained that the company has seen the potential of Wazdan's innovative games and is now proud to introduce them to its growing customer base. Finally, Yanakieva said: "We remain committed to upholding our brand's reputation and have no doubt our new agreement with Wazdan will help facilitate this."</p>
<p>Wazdan's Chief Commercial Officer, Andrzej Hyla, was similarly excited about the new partnership with INBET for the regulated gambling market in Bulgaria. He said: "Our partnership with INBET marks a further advancement in our commercial growth."</p>
<p>Hyla pointed out that Wazdan is looking forward to the successful collaboration with the Bulgarian operator which will deliver a plethora of unique games. Last but not least, Wazdan's Chief Commercial Officer said: "We trust this will be a successful relationship and hope we continue our trend of generating impressive results for operators in the region."</p>
<p>The partnership between Wazdan and INBET comes on the heels of another important deal announced by the prominent studio. Late in March, the company inked a deal with Livespins. That collaboration saw Wazdan's content reach new clients via Livespins' powerful social live-streaming platform.</p>
<p>Before that, earlier in March, Wazdan continued its expansion in Europe by forging a content deal with the operator Golden Grand. That deal saw the company advance its position within the Swiss iGaming market and at the same time delivered new games for customers of the operator.</p>
