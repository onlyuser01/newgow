<p>Leading B2B provider of sports betting solutions Kambi Group has inked a multi-channel sportsbook partnership agreement with Saginaw Chippewa Gaming Enterprises – a tribal betting operator in Michigan.</p>
<p>Kambi to Provide Solutions to Saginaw Chippewa’s Venues</p>
<p>The deal will see Saginaw Chippewa Gaming Enterprises integrate Kambi Group’s on-site sportsbook platform into two of its venues, namely the Saganing Eagles Landing Casino and Hotel, as well the Soaring Eagle Casino and Resort. The tribal gambling operator will also integrate Kambi’s various solutions, such as the Bring Your Own Device tech, the Bet Builder solution, and Kambi kiosk. Furthermore, the partnership between the two parties will also cover the release of an online sportsbook.</p>
<p>Melinda Coffin, the chief executive officer of Saginaw Chippewa Gaming Enterprises, said that she is thrilled to announce the tribal operator’s partnership with Kambi Group. She revealed that the clients of Saginaw Chippewa Gaming Enterprises’ venues have been “anxiously looking forward to sports betting. We look forward to working with Kambi Group and providing a great experience for our guests,” Coffin concluded.</p>
<p>Kambi is Continuing Its Steady Growth</p>
<p>Kristian Nylén, the chief executive officer of Kambi, also spoke on the partnership. He explained that partnering with “market leaders and local heroes” has always been a key strategy for the growth of the B2B company. “Saginaw Chippewa Gaming Enterprises certainly fulfills that criteria,” Nylén noted:</p>
<p>“Through its popular Soaring Eagle Casino &amp; Resort and Saganing Eagles Landing Casino &amp; Hotel properties, Saginaw Chippewa Gaming Enterprises has established a formidable brand and a large customer database in Michigan” Kristian Nylén, the chief executive officer of Kambi</p>
<p>Nylén added that Kambi’s team has the experience and savvy needed to create a leading sportsbook product. He said that his company is looking forward to collaborating with Saginaw Chippewa Gaming Enterprises and delivering “deliver exciting sports betting experiences” to visitors of its venues.</p>
<p>Kambi has worked to establish some reliable relationships with various tribal betting organizations throughout the United States, with the Saginaw Chippewa Indian tribe being one of many.</p>
<p>Kambi has been enjoying steady growth throughout 2021. The B2B provider recently posted its revenues for the third quarter of the year, which demonstrated a strong 48% year-to-year increase. The increased fan engagement in the US betting market helped greatly to that figure.</p>
<p>Despite its great contribution, the United States isn’t the only region Kambi has been actively targeting. In June, the company expanded its operations in the LATAM region via a deal with Olimpo.bet. In August, Kambi became the exclusive sportsbook partner of the Bahamas-based operator Island Luck. Recently, it expanded to the newly-launched Dutch market with a BetEnt agreement.</p>
