<p>The ban is in line with Australia’s wider efforts to crack down on problem gambling</p>
<p>Australia is proceeding with its plans to prohibit the use of credit cards in online gambling. In a new development, the House of Representatives passed a bill that would introduce a prohibitory measure.</p>
<p>The Interactive Gambling Amendment (Credit and Other Measures) Bill 2023 was first introduced in September amid concerns about the worrisome problem gambling rates in the country. The philosophy of the measure was best expressed by Communications Minister Michelle Rowland who said that people should not gamble with money they do not have.</p>
<p>The bill remained unaltered as amendment proposals failed to gain traction. As a result, the House of Representatives passed the bill in its initial form.</p>
<p>The ban is yet to come into force as the measure will now be discussed by the Senate. In any case, the ban has support from the biggest parties in the country.</p>
<p>Australia Doubles Down on Customer Protection</p>
<p>The ban on credit cards in online gambling mirrors a similar measure already in effect at brick-and-mortar venues. If passed, the measure would prevent consumers from gambling on credit.</p>
<p>In addition to banning the use of credit cards in gambling, the measure would provide the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) with the powers necessary to enforce the ban. For example, the regulator will be able to hand fines of up to AUD $234,750 (approximately $151,082 in USD, current conversion rates) to violators.</p>
<p>Should the new ban come into effect, operators will be provided with a six-month window to take their credit card products down.</p>
<p>The new measure has been discussed for years and may finally become a reality. It is in line with Australia’s wider efforts to crack down on problem gambling in the country and protect high-risk customers from harm.</p>
<p>One of these measures is the BetStop self-exclusion registry which allows people to exclude themselves from gambling for a period of between 3 months and a lifetime. The service recently reported having reached 10,000 registrations.</p>
<p>In more recent news, Michelle Rowland came under fire because of her birthday launch with gambling lobbyists in November 2022. The controversial meal prompted Kooyong MP Monique Ryan to introduce a new measure that would make lobbying more transparent. Ryan slammed the current lobbying rules as “toothless and ineffective” and said that ministers’ diaries should be visible to the public.</p>
