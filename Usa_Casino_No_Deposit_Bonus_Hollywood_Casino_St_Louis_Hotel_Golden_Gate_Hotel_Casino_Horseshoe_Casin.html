<p>Golden Rock Studios releases first game, Volatile Slot</p>
<p>The studio will focus on high volatility titles in future</p>
<p>Table games are also planned down the line in a bid to innovate the segment</p>
<p>New casino game-maker Golden Rock Studios has launched its first slot game, Volatile Slot, which sets in motion a long-anticipated beginning for the company with a number of games to come in the following months.</p>
<p>Golden Rock Studios Rolls Out Volatile Slot</p>
<p>Newly-minted B2B and B2C casino vendor Golden Rock Studios has released Volatile Slot, the company’s first game in the segment. As a result, players eager to get their hands on the hottest action in iGaming will need to head to Leo Vegas Group Brands, before the game hits a wider audience on November 11.</p>
<p>Golden Rock Studios have called their debuting title ‘a hardcore slot for the serious gambler,’ reminding players of the high volatility of the game. In iGaming, high volatility means lower frequency of the payouts but a bigger payday when a player hits a successful combination.</p>
<p>‘The Most extreme ever made’</p>
<p>You can multiply your bet by 23,600x its original value. There are 10 paylines and a Wild Symbol fixed to reels 2, 3 and 4. The game also offers a multiplier of 2x, 3x and 4x your bet amount. If you line up a number of Wilds across the reels, however, you can access an even better multiplier offering 64x the wagered amount in total payouts.</p>
<p>The game also features a free spin level where you can claim additional 10 free credits. Volatile Slot comes with crisp graphics and an OST craft specifically for the game.</p>
<p>Golden Rock Studios and Upcoming Projects</p>
<p>Golden Rock Studios has been founded with the help of Co-Founder Will Mathieson and the current CEO James Curwen, an industry veteran who previously worked at William Hill and Superbet. The good news is Mr. Curwen said earlier this year that he was fully-focusing on the games GRS plans on releasing.</p>
<p>Volatile Slot is just the first of many to come. Next on the list are games such as Star Gods, a 5×3 grid slot with 95.94% in estimated payout. Once again, the average volatility here is ranging from medium to high, which suggests that the company will be chasing an audience of high rollers.</p>
<p>While low-volatility games would have been easier to develop and market, GRS has gone after a highly-profitable-if-done-right segment instead. Next on the menu is Gold ‘N’ Rocks, a 5×5 grid slot with still unknown return-to-player (RTP) and once again medium to high volatility.</p>
<p>Slots will constitute the bulk of the upcoming portfolio, but Mr. Curwen has previously said that table games have long lacked proper innovation. To this end, Golden Rock Studios will focus on bringing its own titles to the virtual table as is.</p>
<p>Golden Rock Studios is on Microgaming’s Quickfire and the company is committed to socially responsible gambling practices.</p>
