    <h1>Sugarhouse Casino Pa Westgate Resort Casino Las Vegas Nevada Casino Saratoga Springs Casino Ocean Sh</h1>

<p>Dear wennertom,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem.</p>
<p>I have checked the general bonus terms and conditions, and this is what I found:</p>
<p>"GENERAL BONUS TERMS AND CONDITIONS</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>1.5 All winnings when playing with a bonus are limited to a maximum of ten times (x10) your deposit amount. The Casino has the right to increase the limit for players at its discretion."</p>
<p>I would like to emphasize, that according to our Fair Gambling Codex https://casino.guru/fair-gambling-codex-for-casinos#win-limits, we consider imposed win limit to be unfair and predatory, only when it’s applied to a real money game, however, we accept bonus T&amp;Cs that restrict the maximum cash out from a bonus play.</p>
<p>Could you please advise how much was your last deposit when activating the bonus offer?</p>
<hr />
<p>In regard to your missing deposit, I would like to warn you, that if your deposit has never been credited to your casino account, the only thing you can do is to contact your payment provider. They need to investigate, but bear in mind, that it’s a lengthy process which takes approximately one month. In these cases, the casino has its hands tied. Meanwhile, I would strongly recommend not to deposit any more funds until the issue is sorted.</p>
<p>If the money got lost during the transaction, it’s going to take some time before it’ll be credited to your casino account.</p>
<p>Please forward your payment receipt along with any relevant communication to petronela.k@casino.guru.</p>
<p>I hope we will be able to help you to resolve this issue. Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
