<p>EveryMatrix has entered a remote gaming server contract with JVL Labs to launch its land-based titles into the online gaming space.</p>
<p>A Landmark Deal</p>
<p>Award-winning software solutions and sports betting supplier EveryMatrix have announced that it has entered a fresh remote gaming server contract with gaming leader JVL Labs. Through the deal, JVL Labs will leverage EveryMatrix’s flagship RGS Matrix solution to translate its own land-based gaming titles into virtual space, thus extending the product’s reach and audience pool.</p>
<p>EveryMatrix, which has recently applied for a license application in New Jersey, has over 12 years of experience as a supplier of modular and API driven product suits and solutions for casino, betting, payments, and affiliate management. The company offers multiple solutions that can be used standalone or in tandem with each other.</p>
<p>The RGS Matrix platform is the company’s sixth iGaming solution and will enable JVL Labs to not only build games and IPs faster, but it would also greatly improve integration and streamline the distribution of the gaming company’s products to a global network of various platforms. The platform was launched in 2019 and aims to accelerate the process of developing, distributing and managing game products and portfolios.</p>
<p>JVL Labs has over 35 years of experience on the land-based casino gaming market and has a portfolio of over 100 available titles which stand to benefit from the partnership with Every Matrix. The company’s planned move into the online gaming market would potentially open up new sources of income.</p>
<p>EveryMatrix has entered into several other deals this year, including a promising agreement with Push Gaming, but this would be the first time that a company would use EveryMatrix’s platforms to translate land-based titles into online space.</p>
<p>Companies Share Confidence in Agreement</p>
<p>JVL Labs Chairperson Inna Levitan has expressed confidence about the company’s latest venture. According to her, this move is the culmination of many-year search for the right opportunity to enter the lucrative online market.</p>
<p>“This mutually beneficial venture will bring forth an excellent new product that will excite the online gaming community,” said Inna Levitan, JVL Labs Chairperson</p>
<p>RGS Matrix Managing Direction Mathias Larsson has stated that the software solution has proven successful in the 12 months since its initial launch. The product has helped impress and attract several up-and-coming gaming studios that have already launched titles with the aid of the platform.</p>
<p>In regard to the partnership with JVL Labs, Mr. Larsson noted: “The present agreement with JVL is different than the previous ones since they are our first land-based supplier that picked us to take them online. I think this signing announces a bright future for RGS Matrix. We are honored to work with JVL, and we’ll be here to assist their team with their future endeavors, no matter how ambitious and bold.”</p>
