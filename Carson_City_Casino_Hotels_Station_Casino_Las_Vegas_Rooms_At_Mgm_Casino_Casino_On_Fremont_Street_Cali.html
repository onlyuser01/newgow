<p>Calm Before the Storm: Trump vs. Biden Odds Unchanged in Election Leadup</p>

<p>The 2020 betting odds on the presidential election have been relatively stable in the week leading up to the November 3 election.</p>

<p>William Hill has former Vice President Joe Biden at 8/15, a price that implies a winning chance of 65.22 percent for the 77-year-old. That line has remained unchanged for more than seven days.</p>
<p>Incumbent President Donald Trump is the underdog at 6/4 (40 percent chance), a price that has also remained steady. The 74-year-old president has been crisscrossing the nation in key battleground states in the days before tomorrow’s Election Day showdown.</p>
<p>2020 presidential odds on the online betting exchange PredictIt have also been quite flat. Biden’s shares of winning the White House are holding strong at 66 cents — up two cents from a week ago. Trump’s shares are at 41 cents — down one.</p>
<p>While tomorrow is the day, it might not be the day we know who will lead the nation for the next four years.</p>
<p>“When will the presidential election outcome be called?” has November 4 the betting favorite at 37 cents. Election Day is next at 26 cents, November 5 at 11 cents, and Nov. 6-7 at 10 cents. “After December 14” is at seven cents, the fifth-likeliest market option.</p>
<p>PredictIt Retains Betting Monopoly</p>
<p>Gamblers in the US can still not legally place a bet on a political outcome at a regulated sportsbook. There are now 20 states with sports betting operational, but no state gaming regulatory has yet approved political betting.</p>
<p>PredictIt operates legally in the US through its issuance of a “no-action relief” letter from the federal Commodity Futures Trading Commission.</p>
<p>In obtaining the no-action letter, PredictIt agreed to limit each market question to 5,000 traders, and an $850 cap on individual investments per market. PredictIt shares its data with the academic community, including MIT, Harvard, Yale, Duke, and University of Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Biggest Betting Event in US History?</p>
<p>Since political betting is largely facilitated through online, offshore books, as well as legal bookmakers in the UK, it’s difficult — if not impossible — to determine just how much total cash is on the November 3 outcome. But there’s no disputing it’s a large number, likely one that runs 10 digits.</p>
<p>Betfair, a UK exchange that allows gamblers to buy and sell shares of political outcomes, says it expects its 2020 presidential market handle to eclipse a half of a billion dollars. In 2016, the site reported handle of less than $250 million on Trump versus Hillary Clinton.</p>
<p>Betfair confirmed that the 2020 White House showdown is its largest single betting event in its history. PredictIt told Casino.org that the Trump vs. Biden election is its most-traded market ever, more than 115 million shares bought and sold. PredictIt does not disclose financial numbers, but the market has long been capped after reaching its 5,000-trader ceiling.</p>
