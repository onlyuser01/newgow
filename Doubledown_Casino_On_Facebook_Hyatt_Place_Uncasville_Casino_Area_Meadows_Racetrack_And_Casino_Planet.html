<p>NorthStar Bets will have even more games to offer its players in Ontario, Canada moving forward, thanks to a new partnership with Pragmatic Play. The new partnership will see a number of excellent games incorporated into NorthStar Bets, the native brand developed to cater to the Ontario iGaming and sports betting market following the legalization of the province in April.</p>
<p>This partnership comes after Pragmatic Play announced a similar content alliance with Swiss4Win.ch, a Casinò Lugano brand, in Switzerland earlier this week. NorthStar previously sought a partnership with Genius Sports to strengthen its sports betting proposition in the province, but is now moving forward with iGaming.</p>
<p>Under the new partnership between NorthStar Bets and Pragmatic Play, facilitated by the former’s parent company NorthStar Gaming, players will have access to some of the supplier’s best titles on the market, including Sugar Rush, Gates of Olympus, Big Bass Splash, and many others. Pragmatic Play has an extensive variety of games in the slot category that will now be a more permanent part of NorthStar Bets’ own offer.</p>
<p>Irina Cornides, Chief Operating Officer, was similarly pleased to see the NorthStar Bets brand get a significant content boost through Pragmatic Play. She argued that the operator has a clear-cut plan for the Canadian market and that Pragmatic was happy to be a part of this plan.</p>
<p>"The NorthStar team has a strong vision of what they can achieve in the growing Canadian market, and we’re excited to deliver our content within the immersive NorthStar Bets online casino for slots fans to enjoy," Cornides explained.</p>
<p>NorthStar Gaming CEO Michael Moskowitz was similarly happy with the new partnership. He praised Pragmatic Play and said that the company has long established itself as one of the leading entities in the iGaming sector and deservedly so.</p>
<p>"We’re excited to provide our players with an immersive and content driven gaming experience that also features some of the most popular slots," Moskowitz noted. Pragmatic Play previously launched its bingo product with Bet365, as the two companies sought to expand their reach. The supplier also expanded with Bet24Horas in Brazil and has been building a steadfast momentum in key geographies.</p>
