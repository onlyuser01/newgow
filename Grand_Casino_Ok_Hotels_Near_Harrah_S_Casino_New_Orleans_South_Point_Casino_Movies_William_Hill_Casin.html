<p>Provider of lottery products and solutions Pollard Banknote announced the Texas Lottery Commission has awarded it with a new contract to extend their partnership through 2034.</p>
<p>Unique Concepts to Maximize Revenue</p>
<p>The new contract authorizes Pollard Banknote to provide scratch ticket manufacturing and services for the Texas Lottery and includes the rollout of the provider’s easyVEND In-Lane ticket vending solution to retailers across The Lone Star State.</p>
<p>Gary Grief, executive director of the Texas Lottery, outlined the “strong history” with the supplier empowered the lottery “to bring new games and innovative products to market,” hailing Pollard Banknote’s “expertise in the scratch ticket and retail categories” as the main drivers behind the “unique concepts that maximize revenue” in the state and “benefited all Texans.”</p>
<p>“We are excited to once again partner together to deliver products and services that delight players and grow our lottery business,” Grief concluded.</p>
<p>The new proprietary easyVEND In-Lane ticket vending solution will make its debut in Texas, seeking to impact sales of scratch tickets by allowing the addition of scratch tickets to transactions within a multi-lane retail sales environment and help the Texas Lottery grow its sales and revenue for good causes.</p>
<p>Brad Thompson, vice president of Sales &amp; Marketing at Pollard Banknote, stressed the two-decades-long partnership that helped “deliver innovative scratch ticket products that excite and engage players” would now enter a new phase with the inclusion of the company’s easyVEND solution.</p>
<p>“With the inclusion of our easyVEND solution, the Lottery can now augment sales at multi-lane retailers through increased product awareness and new points of distribution to its players, leading to greater returns for good causes throughout the state,” he added.</p>
<p>Two Decades of Collaboration</p>
<p>The collaborative partnership between Pollard Banknote and the Texas Lottery spanning over two decades already produced player-engaging cutting-edge lottery products and helped generate returns for good causes in the state.</p>
<p>The Texas Lottery has been experiencing significant growth in recent years, registering its 12th consecutive year of record-breaking sales in FY 2022 when sales reached $8.3 billion, driven by scratch ticket sales which accounted for 81% of the total.</p>
<p>The Texas Lottery is the latest to affirm its partnership with Pollard Banknote after an agreement with the Nebraska Lottery saw the iconic characters of Universal on scratch tickets in September to bring fun and nostalgic appeal spanning generations.</p>
<p>Earlier in the year, Pollard Banknote teamed with the Michigan Lottery to create a new omnichannel program based on the PAC-MAN experience, available as a pull-tab ticket, an instant ticket and a dedicated online experience.</p>
