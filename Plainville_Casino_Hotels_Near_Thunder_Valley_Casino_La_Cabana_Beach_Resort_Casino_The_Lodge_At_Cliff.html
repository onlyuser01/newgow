<p>Hard Rock International to Take Over The Mirage by End of 2022</p>
<p>The iconic Las Vegas hotel and casino The Mirage will finally be changing hands from MGM Resorts International to Hard Rock International following a major deal made between the two companies in December 2021.</p>
<p>Hard Rock International Will Take Over The Mirage by the End of 2022</p>
<p>Hard Rock International bought The Mirage from MGM Resorts International back in December 2021 for the whopping sum of $1.075 billion.</p>
<p>Hard Rock announced that they have big plans for the property, however, the major changes will be implemented gradually and will not happen just yet.</p>
<p>Hard Rock plans to build a hotel tower in the shape of a guitar in the front of the property facing the Las Vegas strip, probably in the place of the volcano show, and the company is going to rename the venue from The Mirage to Hard Rock Las Vegas.</p>
<p>However, The Mirage customers should not worry just yet. The changes will take time and players will be able to enjoy the volcano for a little while longer.</p>
<p>According to the sales agreement, Hard Rock has the right to keep the brand The Mirage for up to three years. The company also announced in July that it plans to open the rebranded property with the iconic guitar-shaped tower in 2025.</p>
<p>The finalization of the deal and the conclusive transfer of the property from MGM Resorts to Hard Rock is subject to approval by the Nevada Gaming Commission, which has a certain schedule of meetings. This means that the earliest possibility for the Commission to approve the transfer of the property will be December 22.</p>
<p>Players Will Still Be Able to Use Their MGM Rewards Points and Tier Status</p>
<p>Initially, guests will not experience much of a disruption in terms of services. All hotel reservations will remain as they are and the booking numbers will be the same during the transition period.</p>
<p>MGM Rewards perks will also still be available until the transaction is fully completed.</p>
<p>Members of the MGM Rewards program will be able to keep their tiers for all other MGM properties or they will be able to transfer their tier status to Hard Rock’s loyalty program.</p>
<p>Hard Rock is going to implement its loyalty program Unity Rewards in The Mirage, which Hard Rock customers have access to at more than 150 locations both in the US and around the world.</p>
<p>Hard Rock has made a commitment to make sure that The Mirage’s customers do not experience any disruptions or major changes during the transitional period and beyond.</p>
