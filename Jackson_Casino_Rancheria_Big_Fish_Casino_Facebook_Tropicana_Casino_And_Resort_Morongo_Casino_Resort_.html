<p>PokerStars Casino now part of NJ Fox Bet mobile app</p>
<p>Casino gambling market still bigger than sports betting</p>
<p>FanDuel and Fox Bet aren’t competitors any more</p>
<p>PokerStars Casino appeared in the NJ Fox Bet’s mobile app last Friday. The company is consolidating its market in New Jersey.</p>
<p>Fox Bet Launches NJ PokerStars Casino</p>
<p>On Friday, October 4, Fox Bet began promoting a new product in New Jersey. The brand opened doors for the PokerStars Casino within the dedicated Fox Bet mobile app. Moving forward, users will be able to access online casino as well as sportsbook games.</p>
<p>Following in the footsteps on one of the best-established companies in the state – DraftKings and FanDuel – Fox Bet is focusing on building a multi-purpose facility. With one month in operation, Fox Bet has already been showing strong signs of growth.</p>
<p>Casino Games for NJ Fox Bet Players</p>
<p>Fox Bet mobile is a product resulting from the partnership between The Stars Group and Fox Sports, which teamed up to create a new online sportsbook. The hopes are that the companies can push their product in every legal market in the country and overseas markets. Recently, Flutter Entertainment acquired The Stars Group, but this won’t disrupt current plans in any way.</p>
<p>While sports betting has been long considered the priority of the partnership, online gambling is another vertical worth exploring. In fact, online casino revenue outpaces the $250 million in sports betting revenue accumulated by sportsbooks in the state.</p>
<p>Hard to even make sense of NJ during this transition, for that matter. FanDuel Sportsbook has Betfair Casino embedded right now, and Fox Bet has PokerStars Casino. — Eric Ramsey (@Eric_Ramsey) October 5, 2019</p>
<p>To debut their product properly, PokerStars Casino has created a portfolio featuring 150 slot games alongside a number of table options. With this move, PokerStars is the only brand that has been able to bring around all three popular gambling segments, meaning casino, poker, and sports betting to the Garden State.</p>
<p>This is a particularly noteworthy achievement at a time when poker in the state has been in a downward spiral.</p>
<p>Converting Customers</p>
<p>Just like in the United Kingdom where sports betting and casino have been long used to convert players, so are companies in the United States now trying to prompt their customers to explore the full gambling portfolio on offer – whether that is betting or online casinos. FanDuel and DraftKings have been particularly good at that.</p>
<p>Admittedly, brands such as FanDuel had a lot of help, after Paddy Power Betfair acquired the brand in May 2018, just around the same time PASPA was struck down. The FanDuel Sportsbook was launched, and it featured a version of the Betfair casino, pointing to immediate emphasis on conversion.</p>
<p>New Jersey is one of the three market that has a fully-legalized online casino gambling market as of 2019, although a number of other states will probably focus on online gambling, once they have been able to establish a mobile betting sports legislation.</p>
<p>Narrowing Down the Competition Field</p>
<p>With Fox Bet expanding in one of the few markets that offers online casino gambling, competition is less of a concern. After the Flutter Entertainment $6-billion acquisition of The Stars Group, there are still a few unknowns, but that will be cleared up with time.</p>
