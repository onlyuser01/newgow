<p>FC Dallas vs. Inter Miami is a Leagues Cup round of 16 game, which will take place at Toyota Stadium in Fresno, TX, on Sunday, August 6</p>
<p>FC Dallas vs. Inter Miami is played in Fresno, a city in the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area, meaning that Sunday’s game will mark the first time Lionel Messi is playing for the Herons on the road. In the three games he’s played in Miami, the soccer GOAT was brilliant, but can he continue to do so away from home?</p>
<p>He’ll probably put on a good show on Sunday evening, but the real question is will that be enough for the Herons to advance to the next stage of the Leagues Cup? The thing is that they’re locking horns with a very tricky opponent, who just loves playing big matches.</p>

<p>FC Dallas is a Real Giant-Slayer in 2023</p>
<p>Sure, you wouldn’t think of FC Dallas as an MLS heavyweight, but this team does have some amazing players on the roster. Forward Jesus Ferreira is arguably this team’s biggest star, who got himself in the international news after impressing with the USMNT at the Gold Cup a few weeks ago.</p>
<p>His colleague from the center of the field, Sebastian Lletget is an exceptional playmaker, and the two have been working well together. This explains why FC Dallas has scored a total of seven goals in the three games of the Leagues Cup.</p>
<p>Sure, this team still hasn’t faced as tough an opponent as Inter Miami in this competition, but FC Dallas is famously good against tough opponents. In the 2023 MLS, we’ve already seen the Texans slay such giants as Los Angeles FC, St. Louis City, and Austin FC. This team has also defeated Inter Miami once this year, but it was way back when no one had any idea Lionel Messi was going to come.</p>
<p>Lionel Messi and His Inter Miami Teammates are Going for the Title</p>
<p>Lionel Messi’s arrival has made an instant impact on Inter Miami, whose ambitions are now super-high. The Herons have set their eyes on the Leagues Cup title. They want to lift the trophy, and they have every right to dream big.</p>
<p>Messi has been fabulous since coming to Florida, scoring five goals already and recording one assist. He could’ve scored one more, but in the game against Orlando City, he let his struggling teammate Josef Martinez take a penalty.</p>
<p>The former Atlanta United striker scored from the penalty spot, thus ending his 5-game goal drought. It put him in a great mood for the remainder of the game, as evident from the fact that he set up one goal for Messi later on.</p>
<p>With him and Messi in top form, the Herons look capable of beating anyone in the Leagues Cup. But it’s not just about them. Sergio Busquets has also been fantastic, and Jordi Alba is expected to start showing up very soon. The former Barcelona left-back made his Inter Miami debut in the previous round after coming off the bench. This time, we could see him start the game.</p>
<p>FC Dallas vs. Inter Miami Prediction</p>
<p>FC Dallas is a team that seems capable of scoring against any opponent in North and Central America. However, we’re 100% certain that the Texans are incapable of keeping their net safe against Messi &amp; Co. That said, we think the Herons are going to thrash them on Sunday.</p>
<p>Picks: Inter Miami to win &amp; over 2.5 goals</p>
