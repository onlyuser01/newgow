<p>SkillOnNet, a top casino and iGaming software solutions provider, has forayed into Ontario, launching three of its brands in the Canadian province.</p>
<p>PlayOJO, SlotsMagic and SpinGenie Go Live</p>
<p>It has been a few months since Ontario launched its regulated betting market. Now, SkillOnNet, a leader in iGaming software and an operator of many notable iGaming brands, has launched three of its brands in the province. Thanks to that, Ontarian punters can enjoy SkillOnNet’s PlayOJO, SlotsMagic and SpinGenie.</p>
<p>Each of the brands has something special to bring to the market. For example, PlayOJO lauds itself as the fairest online casino out there. It has no play-through requirements, pays all wins in cash and imposes no withdrawal restrictions on players.</p>
<p>SlotsMagic, on the other hand, is a leader in the world of slot games, as the name implies. It offers a vast variety of games and themes users can choose from, never allowing users to get bored.</p>
<p>Lastly, SpinGenie is another critically-acclaimed slots juggernaut. It engages players with an intuitive UI paired with free spins and exciting daily slots tournaments. The brand allows fans to win great rewards and prizes. Because of this, it enjoys great popularity in the United Kingdom and beyond.</p>
<p>This launch follows SkillOnNet’s approval by the local regulator, the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario.</p>
<p>Ontario – a Much-Coveted Jurisiction</p>
<p>Michael Golembo, sales and marketing director for SkillOnNet, commented on the launch of the brands in Ontario. He called it an exciting opportunity and added that his team is looking forward to rolling out more of its products in the market.</p>
<p>In addition, Golembo thanked the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario for giving SkillOnNet entry to the province. He also promised that there is a lot his company can bring to the market, emphasizing that it provides a network of the most popular European casino brands.</p>
<p>Golembo concluded that his team feels joyful to be able to showcase its games to Ontarians and engage with local customers.</p>
<p>As of the time of this writing, Ontario is the only Canadian province that has allowed international gambling companies to operate in its market. The province has 14.5 million citizens which is a huge opportunity for companies to find a new audience. Analysts predict that revenues from the province will reach a billion dollars in two years.</p>
<p>This January, SkillOnNet teamed up with the LATAM-facing operator Ortiz Gaming, reinforcing its foothold in the region. A month later, the company expanded the selection of payment methods on its platform by adding Apple Pay.</p>
