<p>Facing a few troubles of their own, the FanDuel Sportsbook and Washington Football Team have not hesitated to extend a hand to the United Negro College Fund (UNCF).</p>
<p>Following a recent tie-up between the Washington Football Team (WFT) and FanDuel, the pair is now donating $1 million to UNCF. This comes on the tail of a market access partnership WFT and FanDuel signed back in January in Virginia.</p>
<p>The $1-million contribution will be used as an Emergency Student Aid Fund for students enrolled in Virginia’s five Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU). The fund will assist students in need of tuition, housing, food, security, technology, and other expenses related to education.</p>
<p>This initiative was conceived as an extension of FanDuel and WFT’s legal sports betting partnership in the state to help celebrate Black History Month. HBCU institutions will work together with the UNCF to ensure students in need can benefit from the support.</p>
<p>“Supporting these institutions and these hard-working students, amidst enormous challenges related to COVID, is the right thing to do,” said Matt King, CEO of FanDuel Group.</p>
<p>He added that FanDuel hoped to contribute to the important role HBCUs play during Black History Month in the recognition and evolution of the next generation of leaders in academia, business, and civic partnerships, FanDuel hopes that this investment in students helps them accomplish their goals.</p>
<p>The Washington Football Team owners, Dan and Tanya Snyder added that HBCUs have created some of the most talented industry leaders, making an amazing impact on their organization and many others in the District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia. Through this investment, they hope to support the cultivation of talent at HBCUs and provide scholars with an opportunity to accomplish their career aspirations and goals.</p>
<p>WFT President Jason Wright Is Proud to Support UNCF and HBCU</p>
<p>The president of the WFT, Jason Wright, noted he was proud of the team and FanDuel in supporting the UNCF and HBCUs during an important moment in history as they have propelled Black socio-economic development like no other.</p>
<p>Dr Michael Lomax, president and CEO of UNCF, expressed content that FanDuel and the Washington Football Team support students during this harsh and disrupted academic year. UNCF is the largest private provider of educational support and scholarships to African American students.</p>
<p>According to FanDuel, The Emergency Student Aid Fund will start functioning as soon as possible. The grants will be dispersed to Virginia HBCU students by their respective universities. By the beginning of March, students who require emergency support can consult their school’s Financial Aid Office.</p>
