    <h1>Rivers Casino Resort Schenectady Casino Pechanga Casino Near San Diego Ca Casino And Resort Cannery</h1>

<p>I don’t have no family members I leave in apartment building with my little kids nd my wife doesn’t know how to play casino.</p>
<p>Never used bonus from casino..</p>
<p>I was involved on identity theft and a detective was helping me to get my information back to me. And I told them about my situation.</p>
<p>I had contact my account manager and I was told the account I had was temporarily suspended.</p>
<p>I was told to submit my identity for account verificatio of my account instead they told me to submit my identity for my balance withdrawal process</p>
<p>I have been with this casino from 2021 and didn’t have any issues but then out of knower my account is duplicate after I submitted my documents and after they seen my balance. I don’t have no intention to withdraw any of my balance because I want to keep them on my account</p>
<p>and play with them whenever I wanted to play</p>
<p>they told me to submit my identity and then they said for withdrawal porpoise not duplicate account.</p>
<p>Until now I have been asking to show me a copy of those they saying duplicate they have not show anything they keep saying sorry for misunderstanding I don’t know what they said that for but I totally understand and I am aware of the casino rule one account per person. Which is I did there is no point to duplicate my account because i used deposit my own money to play with the casino nothing else never contacted them about bonus or free chip I have my own money to play.</p>
<p>.that’s way I have always deposited 500$ so I can have fun not for them to have it and commit fraud and blame it to the player and keep those money for their own interests.</p>
