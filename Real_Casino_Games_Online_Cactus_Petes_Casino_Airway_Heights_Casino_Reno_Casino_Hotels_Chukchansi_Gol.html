<p>Content from BetMakers' Global Racing Network will feature in Ireland and the UK through Sky Sports Racing</p>
<p>Horse racing industry data, analytics and content supplier, BetMakers Technology Group, announced in a filing to the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) this morning it has signed a non-binding term sheet with 1/ST Content to distribute race meetings from BetMakers’ Global Racing Network (GRN) to international wagering markets, including Ireland and the UK.</p>
<p>Content Distribution Deal</p>
<p>Scheduled to launch from May 1, 2023, subject to long-form agreement completion, the agreement with The Stronach Group’s business will add horse racing content from popular US racecourses, including Kentucky Downs, Charles Town, Mahoning Valley, Penn National, Sam Houston, Zia Park and Monmouth Park to 1/ST Content’s broadcast schedule.</p>
<p>Commenting on the non-binding term sheet, Jake Henson, chief executive officer of BetMakers Technology Group, outlined the important role the partnership with 1/ST Content is expected to play for the group’s global horse racing footprint.</p>
<p>The partnership with 1/ST Content is designed to be an important addition to BetMakers’ Global Racing Network, further broadening our global racing distribution base with a strong and credible partner in expansive markets, which can deliver enhanced returns to our racetrack partners. Jake Henson, CEO, BetMakers</p>
<p>The agreement will see North American horse racing content feature through 1/ST Content’s broadcast partner in the UK and Ireland, Sky Sports Racing, as well as through 1/ST Content’s other international media partners’ websites.</p>
<p>Growing Global Presence</p>
<p>The distribution agreement, if executed, will be the latest distribution deal the Australian-based technology group has signed with horse racing operators around the world through its subsidiary, Global Racing Network, including the operator of Malaysia thoroughbred racing venue, Selangor Turf Club.</p>
<p>At the end of last year, the group signed a deal to extend its broadcasting rights from the Malaysian horse racing venue to include content for fixed odds, booked bets, and various exchanges in the UK and Ireland and further boost its product portfolio and attractiveness to betting operators, as well as the visibility of the events taking place at Selangor Turf Club.</p>
<p>Just days later, BetMakers was involved in another horse racing industry development after its partnership with Supreme Ventures’ subsidiaries Supreme Ventures Racing and Entertainment Limited (SVREL) and Prime Sports Jamaica (PSJ) saw the launch of fixed odds betting at Caymanas Park racetrack.</p>
<p>In a surprising development in February, BetMakers canceled 32 million unquoted options and 32 million unquoted class B performance rights issued to Tripp Investments Pty Ltd as trustee for Matt Tripp’s Tripp Investment Trust, citing “vesting conditions associated with the delivery of a ‘transformational deal’ before February 1, 2023, not being satisfied.”</p>
