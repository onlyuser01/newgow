<p>The global leader in sports betting technology, lottery games and preferred partner for government lotteries, Scientific Games (SG), confirmed that was recognized by the 2023 SBC Awards North America. Earlier this week, the company revealed that it won the prestigious Lottery Supplier of the Year Award from the famous event in New York City. The recognition reaffirms the potential of SG's technology and leadership within the digital lottery.</p>
<p>According to the organizers of the SBC Summit North America Awards, SBC, the third edition of the event saw significant interest and competition. SBC explained that many companies involved in the industry competed for an award.</p>
<p>Currently, SG holds a leadership role within the global lottery market. The company is currently the provider of digital lottery solutions, including digital games, iLottery, player loyalty programs and special promotions for 23 North American lotteries. Additionally, SG serves international lotteries around the globe and is undoubtedly a leader within the sector.</p>
<p>In a statement, Scientific Games' CEO, Pat McHugh, shared his excitement saying that the company is delighted to be recognized with the award from SBC. He added: "Looking back at the past year, it's been quite exciting for our digital business as we made significant investment in talent, content and technology advancements for our new company."</p>
<p>Finally, McHugh explained: "While we are most often recognized by the lottery industry as the global leader in retail instant games, we are a pioneer in digital lottery and have been providing groundbreaking internet-based solutions to lotteries in North America and Europe since 2001."</p>
<p>It was back in April last year when SG significantly strengthened its global presence. Back then, the company sold its lottery business to Brookfield Business Partners in what was labeled as a "strategic move." This helped SG return to its focus on lottery and made it even stronger on a global scale. This year, the company also celebrated its 50th anniversary.</p>
<p>Rasmus Sojmark, SBC's Founder and CEO, shared his excitement about the recent announcement saying: "Congratulations to Scientific Games on winning the award for Lottery Supplier of the Year at the SBC Summit North America Awards." He explained that the award recognizes SG's hard work, consistency and strong results over the last year.</p>
<p>SBC commented on the recognition by pointing out: "The company's name and foundation were built on the belief that science should be at the core of every product they create." Finally, SBC said about SG: "Their unwavering dedication to understanding consumers' needs and preferences has firmly established them as a trusted lottery partner and leading innovator in all things digital."</p>
