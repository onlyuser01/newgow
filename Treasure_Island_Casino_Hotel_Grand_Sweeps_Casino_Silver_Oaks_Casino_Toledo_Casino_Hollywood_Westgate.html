<p>Powered by Genius' data-capturing system LiveStats, the new ecosystem will bring value to fans, broadcasters, sponsors, and others.</p>
<p>Sports data, content and technology company Genius Sports announced that its partnership with the Canadian Football League (CFL) facilitated the launch of a new official data and technology ecosystem.</p>
<p>Revolutionizing CFL’s Digital Offering</p>
<p>The new data and technology ecosystem provides comprehensive statistics and insights, enhancing the experience for the entire CFL community, and its launch ahead of the 2023 preseason is the latest step of the partnership aimed at revolutionizing the league’s digital offering Genius Sports and the CFL agreed upon at the end of 2021.</p>
<p>Matthew Cowling, executive vice president of Sports and Partnerships at Genius Sports, commented on the news, outlining that “the CFL’s new data ecosystem will provide immense value for their fans, broadcasters, sponsors and more, creating a wealth of new engagement opportunities.”</p>
<p>“We’re delighted to take our partnership with the CFL to the next level, implementing technology that is used every day in over 150 countries worldwide to capture the fastest, most accurate statistics,” Cowling added.</p>
<p>The new data collection system, CFL LiveStats, will capture official play-by-play updates on every game from the league, powering live betting solutions, augmented broadcasts, tracking, the CFL Game Zone and free-to-play games, CFL Fantasy and CFL Pick’Em. Genius and the CFL launched the game zone in 2022, enabling the league to power personalized marketing experiences.</p>
<p>Helping CFL Tell Its Story</p>
<p>On behalf of the league, the chief operating officer of the CFL, David Goldstein, commented on the launch, “excited to leverage this incredible technology to help tell the story” of the league.</p>
<p>Paying tribute to Genius Sports and its state-of-the-art LiveStats tool, Goldstein outlined that the CFL is “revolutionizing how fans, media and stakeholders connect with” its “world-class action and athletes.”</p>
<p>“Better data will lead to everything from a better viewing experience to interactive gaming, responsible sports wagering, and more, all of which will pave the way for the future of CFL fandom,” he concluded.</p>
<p>CFL LiveStats is expected to provide live play-by-play data and post-game statistics at the start of preseason, as well as share betting, team and player data for all CFL contests. Authenticated CFL partners will have the lowest latency data for media and broadcast purposes.</p>
<p>The CFL said that the rollout of new CFL LiveStats features would continue throughout the season, with plans to launch historical play-by-play data and statistics for public consumption already underway.</p>
<p>Earlier in the month, Genius Sports’ footprint in global sports expanded after the sports data and technology firm agreed upon a four-year collaboration with the official data rights holder for Taiwan football, the Chinese Taipei Football Association (CTFA).</p>
