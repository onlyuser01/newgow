<p>TCSJohnHuxley has become the latest supplier of live gaming products to go ahead and obtain a license from the Mississippi Gaming Commission. The license will make it possible for TCSJohnHuxley to deploy its products in the state and partner with casinos interested in bolstering their live portfolio.</p>
<p>TCSJohnHuxley Clears Regulatory Hurdle to Enter Mississippi</p>
<p>TCSJohnHuxley has focused on a number of solutions that will resonate with consumers in the Magnolia State and enable land-based operators to strengthen their presence by bringing top-tier solutions to their gaming facilities. TCSJohnHuxley is also confident that this license approval will enable the company to pursue further growth and expansion in the region, putting it in a strong position to boost awareness of its games.</p>
<p>Company managing director for the Americas Phil Lee said that the company was delighted to have achieved this milestone and worked with the Mississippi Gaming Commission so closely to secure that. Thanks to this license approval, TCSJohnHuxley may now begin to plan how it will roll out its products across the state. He added:</p>
<p>We are thrilled we can now supply “Certified Perfects” dice alongside our world-renowned TCSJohnHuxley roulette wheels that integrate with our Blaze roulette tables and Winning Number displays. Company managing director for the Americas Phil Lee</p>
<p>Lee was confident that the company positions itself as a turnkey supplier of live table game equipment, which will make it easier for Mississippi players to enjoy excellent on-site experiences in some of the state’s most frequented venues.</p>
<p>TCSJohnHuxley has remained firmly focused on the land-based segments, manufacturing excellent dice, slot, and table games for its partners. The company managed to double down on its expertise and reach by recently adding Midwest Game Supply to its ranks, a fellow manufacturer for the land-based sector.</p>
<p>More Hires to Strengthen TCSJohnHuxley’s Lineup</p>
<p>The company continues to double down on its executive and professional lineup and recently brought in Patrick Magendans to serve as the company’s head of sales for the UK and Europe. Magendans previously worked for Zitro in North and Central Europe. Zitro is a rival company that has a global reach and delivers slot machines worldwide having made decisive strides in the North American and South American markets. TCSJohnHuxley now stands to benefit from Magendans’ expertise and help the company continue to expand its footprint in its target markets.</p>
