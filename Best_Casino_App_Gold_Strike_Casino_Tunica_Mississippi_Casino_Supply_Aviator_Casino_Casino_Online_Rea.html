<p>Following the re-regulation of the Swiss market in 2019, Grand Casino Luzern has been able to secure a number of content partners for its mycasino.ch iGaming brand. Now, Yggdrasil has become the latest leading iGaming supplier to bolster the casino’s content offer.</p>
<p>Yggdrasil Enters Newly-Regulated Swiss Market</p>
<p>Award-winning iGaming developer and publisher Yggdrasil is heading into the Swedish market through a partnership with local partner Grand Casino Luzern, and the company’s local market brand mycasino.ch.</p>
<p>The partnership allows Yggdrasil to roll out its portfolio of products and reach new audiences in Switzerland. A special focus is put on the company’s slot portfolio featuring brand new games, such as Valley of the Gods 2, Hyperburst, Syncronite Splitz and Hades Giglablox among others.</p>
<p>In reinforcing its footprint, Yggdrasil is also adding a touch of its authentic YG Masters program portfolio, which spans numerous games, including Christmas Tree, a newly-released Christmassy slot game by True Lab, a member of the YG Masters’ family.</p>
<p>Through YG Masters, Yggdrasil has been able to secure worthwhile partnerships with independent developers keen on reaching new audiences thanks to Yggdrasil’s vast partnership network.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Grand Casino Luzern has been fortifying its position in the domestic market, since Switzerland decided to re-regulate its gambling market in 2019, giving local companies a distinct advantage over foreign operators.</p>
<p>Previously, mycasino.ch secured another gateway content partnership with ORYX Gaming, which also used mycasino.ch as its entry-point into the vibrant and developing Swiss market.</p>
<p>A Thrilling Entry into the Swiss Market</p>
<p>Commenting on these developments, Yggdrasil Global Market Operations Chief Björn Krantz said that the company was excited to be a part of the Swiss market and work with Grand Casino Luzern.</p>
<p>Krantz explained that the latest tie-up was an example of the company’s ability to deliver on a far-reaching business strategy and a commitment to expand its reach, footprint and presence in what he described as high-value markets. He further had this to add:</p>
<p>“We are excited to add our games to Casino Luzern’s existing offering and to be able to reach more players with our ever-expanding portfolio of innovative and exciting content. Both parties are now working on the planning for a successful launch to take place soon.” -Yggdrasil Global Market Operations Chief Björn Krantz</p>
<p>Grand Casino Luzern CEO Wolfgang Bliem was equally happy with the market-entry, arguing that Yggdrasil is a market-leading slot supplier offering a number of thrilling titles that “never fail to impress.”</p>
<p>Mycasino.ch and Grand Casino Luzern were pleased to introduce their players to the vast portfolio of opportunities delivered by Yggdrasil, Bliem concluded.</p>
