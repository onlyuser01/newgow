    <h1>Ojos Locos Sports Cantina Y Casino Photos Casino Las Vegas Nevada Casino Extreme No Deposit Bonus Co</h1>

<p>When you register at this casino, you will receive a bonus of 4,000 yen.</p>
<p>The wagering requirement is 20x, so you need to rollover $8,000.My family played a few days ago, but after the bonus ran out, they never deposited or logged in.I was told about the casino by a family member, so I registered with the casino from my iPhone, received the bonus and cleared the 80,000 yen rollover, and tried to make a withdrawal, but the instructions were difficult to understand and it was written in such a way that I did not even know how much money I could withdraw.</p>
<p>I was not sure how much money I could withdraw, so I tried to withdraw little by little while communicating with the support chat.At this point, I received a KYC verification email, and customer support told me that I could withdraw the full amount if I deposited 5,000 yen first.When I closed the chat and went back to the top screen, the cache I had before was gone.</p>
<p>I was told that I was in violation because I have multiple accounts.</p>
<p>I was told that I was in violation because I had multiple accounts.At that point, my family contacted the management to delete my account because I don't do it anymore.</p>
<p>The management agreed to do so.</p>
<p>If the account was a duplicate, they would have known at the time of registration, and if it was a serious violation, they would have had to stop it at that point.</p>
<p>I don't understand why cash that I was told I could withdraw should be confiscated.</p>
