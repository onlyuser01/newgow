<p>BetMGM continues to expand in the iGaming segment, with the company determined to add more games and experiences for its growing audience in the online casino sector. To this end, the popular operator has teamed up with NetGaming, an up-and-coming creative casino game developer with a number of original content pieces that will now be part of BetMGM Casino’s offer in Michigan at first, Casino Guru News learned in an email press release.</p>
<p>BetMGM and NetGaming are also planning to roll out a similar partnership in other states, as they continue to build up their iGaming footprint in the United States. NetGaming will bring a remarkable portfolio of titles that includes a range of experiences, including but not limited to 3 Wild Jokers, The Shelby Online Video Slot, and Skulls Gone Wild.</p>
<p>BetMGM Director of Gaming Oliver Bartlett has welcomed the opportunity to provide the brand’s casino players with even more entertaining, fresh, and exclusive content across the market. "We’re thrilled to be working with NetGaming, as they have an exciting portfolio of games that will appeal to our customers in Michigan and beyond," Bartlett said.</p>
<p>BetMGM has been rapidly building up its product offering with more than 1,500 games now available in the iGaming category alone. The operator is also credited with building one of the biggest state-by-state exclusive progressive jackpot networks, which has awarded more than $100m in prizes in 2022 alone.</p>
<p>Commenting on the opportunity to see her company expand in the United States and Michigan, Pallavi Deshmukh, the CEO of NetGaming, has said that the company and the team behind it were thrilled to be rolling out in Michigan and with BetMGM specifically. She hailed this as a testament to the years of hard work that the team had put into building quality products worthy of tier-one operators.</p>
<p>"This is just the beginning of our relationship with BetMGM, as we intend to launch our content across the country, as more states regulate," Deshmukh said with confidence. BetMGM has been busy building up its portfolio in the online casino vertical, with the company securing a partnership with Lightning Box, another prominent developer, for Stellar Cash Dragon Palace.</p>
<p>BetMGM also introduced a Wheel of Fortune-themed online casino, as the company is continuing to expand in the sector.</p>
