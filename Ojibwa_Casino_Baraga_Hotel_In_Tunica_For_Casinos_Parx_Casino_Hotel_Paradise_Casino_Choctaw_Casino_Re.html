<p>The legal hurdle surrounding tribal-state gambling compacts in Oklahoma continues. A few years ago, Gov. Kevin Stitt’s office engaged in revised gaming compacts with four tribes in the state. Seeking to ensure higher proceeds from gaming, the agreements were backed by the Governor, a move that immediately captured the attention of other tribal nations.</p>
<p>Now, in the latest chapter of the legal fight, the Joint Committee on State Tribal Relations in Oklahoma voted against two gaming compacts proposed by Gov. Stitt. As announced by The Oklahoman, the Committee rejected the proposal over fears related to the potential expansion of casino gambling, primarily in Oklahoma County.</p>
<p>One of the agreements was a gaming compact between the state and the United Keetoowah Band, signed off by the Governor back in 2020. Additionally, he also inked a compact with the Kialegee Tribal Town. While the proposals were rejected by the Committee, Gov. Stitt reached revised gaming compacts with the Otoe-Missouria and the Comanche Nation too.</p>
<p>The voting which took place Wednesday, saw lawmakers reject Gov. Stitt’s proposals without any objections. Senate Majority Floor Leader Greg McCourtney announced the rejection and explained that there were significant flaws within the structure of the two gaming compacts. Additionally, he explained that he is unlikely to change his opinion regarding the two compacts.</p>
<p>“I believe there are significant fatal flaws in the construction of this compact in the lands that are granted. My opinion will not change over time.“ Senate Majority Floor Leader Greg McCourtney</p>
<p>Lawmakers, Worried about Potential Casino Expansion</p>
<p>This summer, Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond confirmed his plans to represent the interests of the state in the legal battle over the gaming compacts deemed unlawful. At the time, he said that those gaming compacts resulted in losses of the state’s resources. Prior to the recent meeting, Drummond addressed his concerns in a letter to lawmakers and committee members. In his letter, he explained that the Committee doesn’t have the authority to approve the proposals as they were already rejected by the Supreme Court in Oklahoma.</p>
<p>“Proper respect for the law requires the conclusion that the Joint Committee lacks the authority to make valid that which the Oklahoma Supreme Court earlier declared to be invalid,“ explained Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond in a letter</p>
<p>On the other hand, Jon Echols, House Majority Floor Leader, was more concerned about the potential expansion of gambling within the two proposals. With his district in Oklahoma City, the lawmaker said that building another casino is extremely worrying. Finally, Echols outlined that he was already approached by Oklahoma County residents who shared similar concerns.</p>
<p>However, Gov. Stitt didn’t have such concerns. Instead, he questioned why some tribes are allowed to engage in gambling activities while others are not. The Governor was left baffled and reminded that the proposed compacts were with federally recognized tribes in Oklahoma.</p>
