<p>PGCB launches exclusion scheme</p>
<p>Lifetime bans a possibility</p>
<p>Communities uneasy about casinos arrivals</p>
<p>The Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board (PGCB) has introduced the self-exclusion scheme designed to help problem gamblers avoid gambling dependency.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania’s Self-exclusion Scheme Launches in Full</p>
<p>With Pennsylvania’s online casino industry shaping up and on the cusp of a full-scale launch, the Keystone State has rolled out its self-exclusion program on Tuesday, May 28.</p>
<p>Citizens of the Commonwealth can opt for a self-exclusion option by visiting the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board (PGCB) board and putting their names in the register which will automatically restrict their access to both online and offline casinos.</p>
<p>The exclusion scheme comes with three options, including a year long, five-year long and lifetime ban. As a result, casinos will be obliged to limit the wagering opportunities for players registered under the PGCB protection scheme.</p>
<p>As part of the self-exclusion scheme, players will also be denied access to any player club membership or/and complimentary goods and services. This includes any promotional efforts that may be directed at the customer.</p>
<p>Failing to comply would merit a stiff penalty handed to the guilty party proportionate to the transgression committed. PGCB is focusing on limiting any potential harm stemming from online casinos.</p>
<p>Not in My Backyard</p>
<p>There have already been concerns raised over the presence of casinos in Pennsylvania with several communities protesting against the introduction of these properties in the state. The most recent debate was held in Amish country where locals have been leading a campaign against the Penn National property due to launch in July.</p>
<p>Both representatives of Penn National and the PGCB have met with local protesters, trying to assure them of the feasibility and safety the project, as well as the potential economic windfall for the region.</p>
<p>With the introduction of the self-exclusion scheme the PGCB is trying to listen to the desires of the locals who have appealed companies not to “gamble with their futures.”</p>
<p>With the first interactive wager places, although on sports betting, at the SugarHouse casinos, online solutions will be the dominating vertical for all casino and betting operations moving forward.</p>
