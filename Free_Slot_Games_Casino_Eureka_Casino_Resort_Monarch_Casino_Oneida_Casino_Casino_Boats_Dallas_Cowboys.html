<p>Dallas Cowboys Want to Keep Their Good Run Going</p>
<p>Mike McCarthy’s boys are 10-3 in the 2023 NFL with five wins in a row. Their recent schedule was relatively easy, with games against the New York Giants, Carolina Panthers, Washington Commanders, and Seattle Seahawks, all of which have a negative record.</p>
<p>However, in their most recent game, the Cowboys beat last season’s National Football Conference champions. Not only did they beat the Eagles, but they blew them out 33-13. Quarterback Dak Prescott had a fantastic game, going 24-for-39 for 271 yards and two touchdowns, with no interceptions.</p>
<p>The Cowboys also did well running the ball, with Tony Pollard gaining 59 yards for his team, but with no TDs. The only rushing touchdown was the work of Rico Dowdie.</p>
<p>Dallas’ offense was brilliant in the last game, but everyone needs to keep in mind that Philly is the fifth-worst defense in the league. In Week 15, however, Prescott &amp; Co. are taking on the NFL’s sixth-best defense.</p>
<p>Can Buffalo Stop Dallas?</p>
<p>The Buffalo Bills are 7-6, which doesn’t seem too impressive, but these guys are actually doing very well in 2023 given that they’ve played against some really tough opponents this year. For example, their most recent loss happened to Philadelphia, while in their last game, they defeated Kansas.</p>
<p>With Josh Allen leading their offense, it’s no surprise the Bills have been scoring a lot. Their defense, however, has been their strongest weapon. These guys are conceding just 18.8 points per game, which is really impressive considering that they’ve already played against some of the highest-scoring teams in the 2023 NFL season.</p>
<p>However, they haven’t played against the team with the highest scoring average in the NFL. That’s what’s going to happen on Sunday when they welcome the Dallas Cowboys (32.4 PPG) at Highmark Stadium.</p>
<p>Dallas Cowboys vs. Buffalo Bills Prediction</p>
<p>The Dallas Cowboys are doing so great because their schedule hasn’t been too ugly this year. It’s just the opposite when it comes to the Buffalo Bills – they’re not doing too great because of a very difficult fixture list.</p>
<p>However, they’re a fantastic bunch that should be able to beat the Cowboys. This goes especially because they’re playing on their turf.</p>
<p>Pick: Buffalo Bills -2.5 (-115)</p>
