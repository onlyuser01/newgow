<p>Shared Goals</p>
<p>Powerball, the lottery game which minted a billionaire last year and has been raising billions for good causes, has become an Official Partner of NASCAR and the Official Lottery Game of the professional car racing series organization.</p>
<p>NASCAR and Powerball have shared in the goal of providing exhilarating excitement for decades while also giving back to the communities in which we are a part of Daryl Wolfe, executive vice president and chief revenue officer, NASCAR</p>
<p>Wolfe is excited to launch the partnership that will create “different winning opportunities” for fans of the series throughout the country.</p>
<p>NASCAR and Powerball will commence their partnership by launching a promotion throughout the 2023 season that will allow one lottery player to become a millionaire, with the special $1 million-prize drawing scheduled to take place and broadcast live from the Phoenix Raceway during NASCAR Championship Weekend, Nov. 3-5.</p>
<p>‘Create Memorable Moments’</p>
<p>Powerball Product group chair and Pennsylvania Lottery executive director, Drew Svitko, also commented on the new partnership, outlining the “extraordinary ability” of the partners “to create memorable moments that bring everyone together, to dream and cheer for something big.”</p>
<p>That’s why Powerball is proud to partner with NASCAR to bring extra excitement throughout the season, which includes awarding a $1 million prize to a player in Phoenix. Drew Svitko, Powerball Product group chair and Pennsylvania Lottery executive director</p>

<p>Besides providing three chances per week for players to win big as drawings take place every Monday, Wednesday and Saturday, Powerball allocates more than half of all proceeds from ticket sales to the jurisdiction where the tickets were sold.</p>
<p>Powerball tickets are currently sold in 45 states, Washington D.C., Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands, while its drawings are broadcast live from the Florida Lottery draw studio in Tallahassee and streamed on the lottery’s website, Powerball.com.</p>
