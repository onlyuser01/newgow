<p>One of the leading casino developers in the United States, Rush Street Gaming expanded further the benefits of its loyalty program Rush Rewards, by announcing a new deal with MSC Cruises, one of the largest cruise brands in the world. Announced Tuesday, the new collaboration will see Rush Rewards Members enjoy annual cruise benefits.</p>
<p>Currently, Rush Rewards Members can sign up for free and can start earning tier points at Rivers Casino or via BetRivers Sportsbook. Each time a member plays table games, electronic table games, wagers in person or online, or enjoys slots or other casino games, their profile automatically earns tier points.</p>
<p>Although tier points have no cash value, they contribute toward a Rush Rewards Member status, unlocking exclusive and exciting benefits. Thanks to the new collaboration, Rivers Casino Rush Rewards Members that are Gold Card, Platinum Card and Black Card Members can benefit from MSC Cruises rewards.</p>
<p>Besides enjoying casino games, Rush Rewards members can also earn tier credits and upgrade their status by traveling to different Rivers Casino locations. Such locations include venues in Pennsylvania, Virginia, New York, as well as Illinois.</p>
<p>It's no surprise that Rush Rewards Members need to be at least 21 years old to participate in the program. Besides cruise benefits from MSC Cruises, members of the loyalty program can also enjoy exclusive offers for food and beverage outlets, free slot rewards as well as discounts for hotel accommodations.</p>
<p>Rubén A. Rodríguez, MSC Cruises USA's President, shared his excitement in a statement saying: "Expanding MSC Cruises’ relationship with Rush Street Gaming and Rivers Casino allows us to offer their most loyal players an incredible travel benefit that stretches worldwide."</p>
<p>He explained that the company's ships visit many famous locations around the world and help people engage in unique adventures. Finally, Rodríguez said: "The future of cruising is bright, and the more we grow, the more opportunities we’ll have for Rivers Casino players to explore the world with us."</p>
<p>Tim Drehkoff, Rush Street Gaming and Rivers Casino's CEO, added: "We’re thrilled to offer complimentary travel on MSC Cruises’ modern and glamorous ships to our Rivers Casino guests." In conclusion, he said: "Their world-class, amenity-rich fleet and incredible selection of destinations offer a sophisticated travel experience for Rivers’ most valued customers."</p>
