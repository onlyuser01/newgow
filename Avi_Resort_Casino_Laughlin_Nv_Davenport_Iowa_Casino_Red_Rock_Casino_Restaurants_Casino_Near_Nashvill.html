<p>Mansion Group has decided to close its sportsbook business, MansionBet. Instead, the operator will focus on its casino brands. The move will take effect at the end of this month.</p>
<p>Mansion Group has more than 18 years in the gambling sector and states that its casinobusiness will not be affected. This vertical's main brands include Casino.com and MansionCasino.</p>
<p>"After careful deliberation," explained Mansion CEO Christian Block in an announcement, "we have decided to cease trading our MansionBet brand. The commercial decision was a difficult one, but it does provide opportunity to focus on our casino brands, where we have a long history of excelling."</p>
<p>Current customers of the sportsbook can withdraw money up to the closing date. Any winnings from open wagers will be paid out by April 28, as willany open bets still active as of that date.</p>
<p>Block added, "To minimise impact on consumers, we have ensured our customers' future winnings continue to be paid out, and stakes will be returned regardless of outcome. Finally, I would like to thank all our colleagues and partners for building the sportsbook brand, and our loyal customers for their support throughout."</p>
<p>Bristol City Football Club has an ongoing sponsorship agreement with MansionBet, which features its branding on the soccer team's matchday kits, both home and away. MansionBet branding will be used by the soccer club until the end, but its role as principal partner will end on March 31.</p>
<p>The decision follows soon after Onisac, a Mansion-owned sports betting operator in Gibraltar, was found to have violated anti-money-laundering (AML) rules. Onisac must pay a $1.14-million fine for its AML deficiencies in dealing with non-EU and UK customers.</p>
<p>The Gibraltar Gambling Commissioner (GCC) conducted a study to verify that the operator's due diligence and monitoring practices met industry standards. The review found a number of violations. It also identified issues related to several customer accounts.</p>
<p>The GGC stated that one aggravating factor was the failure by former senior management to properly respond to regulatory advice. They also failed to implement an agreed-upon action program that the regulator put forward in 2020.</p>
