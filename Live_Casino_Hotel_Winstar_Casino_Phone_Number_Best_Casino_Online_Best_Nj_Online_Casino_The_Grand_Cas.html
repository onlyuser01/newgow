<p>Poland’s leading sports betting operator, STS, has unveiled an unprecedented deal with GKS Katowice, a Polish sports club. Under the agreement, the bookmaker will sponsor all of the club’s teams.</p>
<p>The current deal is notably the first multi-section sponsorship in the country. It has been signed for a year but can be extended further.</p>
<p>The agreement will see the operator provide support to GKS Katowice’s men’s and women’s soccer teams, its volleyball team and its ice hockey team. The agreement is in line with the company’s overall strategy, STS’s chief marketing officer, Paweł Rabantek, noted.</p>
<p>According to the official announcement, GKS Katowice’s women’s soccer team will wear the bookmaker’s logo during the autumn round. In the spring, as per the contract, the logo will be moved to the sleeve.</p>
<p>STS’s logo will also feature on the sleeves of GKS Katowice’s ice hockey team, men’s volleyball team and men’s soccer team. The logo will also be visible on LED screens across the stadium at Bukowe street, in the hall of the Szopienice Sports Center, and at the Satelita ice ring. Finally, the operator’s logo will also appear across the club’s social media and digital outlets.</p>
<p>STS Will Launch Exciting Promotions</p>
<p>In addition to promoting the gambling company, GKS Katowice will team up with the operator for multiple fan-oriented activations.</p>
<p>Before the first match of Poland’s top-flight league, STS will conduct a special promotional campaign, providing new customers with a special code. The code will provide GKS Katowice fans with free bets, allowing them to place more wagers throughout the season.</p>
<p>Existing customers, on the other hand, will get risk-free bet offers and dedicated odds for the first match of the league.</p>
<p>STS has also planned similar promotions for the first matches of leagues involving GKS Katowice’s other teams.</p>
<p>The Development Shows GKS Katowice Is Ready for Big Deals</p>
<p>GKS Katowice’s business development manager, Karol Kuśka, shared his excitement about the agreement and thanked STS for the trust it placed in the club. He shared his confidence in this multi-section arrangement and the upcoming collaborative activations.</p>
<p>Kuśka concluded that the current deal is a testament that the club is ready for partnerships with large companies.</p>
<p>Paweł Rabantek, STS’s chief marketing officer, also shared his thoughts on the matter, saying that his company is thrilled about supporting Polish sports. He noted that the sponsorship represents support on a local level as well, considering STS’s links with Katowice, where its headquarters are located.</p>
<p>Rabantek added that STS’s deal with GKS Katowice highlights the operator’s commitment to supporting local sports and underlines its desire to be a leading sports betting operator in Poland.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, STS posted strong Q2 results ahead of its takeover by Entain.</p>
