    <h1>Palace Casino Biloxi Mississippi Northern California Casinos Hotels Near Winstar Casino Oklahoma Lak</h1>

<p>Hello</p>
<p>I have the following problem. I registered at this casino on 7/6/23 and also immediately had my account verified. Uploaded my ID, proof of address and proof of payment. Then the status was verified during the check. Today I deposited another 20 euros without a bonus, I won 3 different slots, always with a bet of 1 euro, and continued to play. Then I played Book of Fallen, also every round with a bet of 1 euro. In one round I got 10 free spins and won 2000 euros. I went to the live chat to ask how I can withdraw because I saw that you can only withdraw 400 euros here, they told me 3 withdrawals at the same time. I did, and asked again later in the chat. Yes it was ok, but then I was asked if I hadn't received any email from the finance department. No, I didn't, and I already had this problem with Dozenspins, that I didn't get any email. In the chat, the content of this email was made available to me, in which it said that I should send the missing documents. Which wasn't a problem for me and I then sent them to kyc support. But I was shown the content of another email that I can't understand at all. My gaming session needs to be checked. I looked at the game history, but weirdly I can only see the game history right up to just before that one game. Very strange. I am sending the content of the 2nd email here</p>
<p>Your game session has been sent to the game provider for verification. As soon as we receive a reply from the gaming provider regarding your gaming session and bets, we will notify you immediately by email. The review of your withdrawal request has been postponed until the game provider provides an official response. An additional check is carried out according to paragraph 2.4.1 of the rules. of the project: 2.4.1. The finance department may defer processing a withdrawal request due to additional verification. The exam takes 3-14 business days.</p>
<p>Is it now a delay in my payout? Is it checked here whether I would have cheated??? I played normally and legally. My feeling is not good as I also had a problem with my payout at Dozenspins and this casino belongs to the same provider.</p>
<p>I have already won such an amount in other casinos in this game, what is unusual about the fact that you have to have it checked???? Or am I being tested here???? Can't understand all that. Maybe you can help me?</p>
