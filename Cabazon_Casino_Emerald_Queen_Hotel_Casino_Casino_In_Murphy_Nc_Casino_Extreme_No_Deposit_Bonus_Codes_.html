    <h1>Cabazon Casino Emerald Queen Hotel Casino Casino In Murphy Nc Casino Extreme No Deposit Bonus Codes</h1>

<p>You can see my account in the photo.</p>
<ol>
<li>The amount that I use to invest money. I play with that amount. 50,000. (â‚¬425) I play very very small roles. For example, 50 dinars per odd / even. Or I put 10 dinars on each number of the small series. That is 120 dinars. 1 token = 1 dinar. The smallest chip I play with 90% of the time is 10. Or any other game. It is important to know that in roulette you CANNOT miss or hit every time.</li>
</ol>
<p>I play very very carefully until I make the first plus over the amount of 50,000. So when, for example, there is a winning spin and there is 50,250 Rsd (dinar) in my account 1. I click on the card</p>
<p>ONLINE MONEY TRANSFER <em>/ </em>/ and I am transferring excess money in the amount of 250 rsd to account number 3.</p>
<p>50,000 rsd remain in the account again, with which I return to the game. As the game goes on, I carefully follow the numbers that come out and record them in special tables that I came up with myself. And I repeat everything until, for example, I achieve the planned profit of 3,000 rsd.</p>
<p>That's one session. End. I leave everything. I'm moving on to other commitments. During the day, I return and play session number 2. I can play a maximum of 3 sessions per day.</p>
<p>I WILL NOT PLAY session number 4 if someone tells me exactly what number will come out.</p>
<p>When enough money accumulates on account number 3, I transfer part of the money to the account. It's a card: reserved (number 2)</p>
<p>I can transfer money to the account only once during the day, so I wait for the end of the working day and transfer funds to the account in the evening around 9 pm. How much I will transfer depends on the needs and the amount in position number 3.</p>
<p>The money arrives in the account the next day by 12:00 p.m.</p>
<p>So Daniel, you're asking me what if I lose? Very very rarely do I lose the amount from balance #1 because I play very very small stakes so if I happen to go on a losing streak of 10 strokes I will be in a very small loss. And to miss every time. Unlikely ðŸ™‚</p>
