    <h1>Bobby Casino No Deposit Bonus America S Largest Casino Nj Online Casino No Deposit Bonus Riverside C</h1>

<p>Global iGaming platform provider SOFTSWISS has appointed Rhys Hamilton as its new head of VIP at managed services. The new hire is a seasoned veteran in the iGaming industry who brings 18 years of experience under his belt which will make him a valuable addition to SOFTSWISS’ own operations as the company undertakes further expansion moves.</p>
<p>Hamilton Is the Right Person for the VIP Job</p>
<p>Hamilton has been previously working on a variety of projects that are tied to his current position where he will be helping bolster SOFTSWISS’ VIP service through cutting-edge analytics and segmentation to further expand the company’s offer. The company’s VIP player support team will also benefit from Hamilton’s relevant expertise, helping SOFTSWISS position itself as one of the leaders in the sector.</p>
<p>Commenting on this opportunity, Hamilton said that he was excited to be joining the company at a time when SOFTSWISS is driving strong performance and picking up the business pace. He has relevant experience as head of the casino at League of Entertainment and head of VIP at Casumo and Hero Gaming, so his knowledge of the segment will help. Hamilton added:</p>
<p>Taking the lead of the VIP team, I look forward to developing a winning combination of Gold Star service for VIPs in a responsible and sustainable way.</p>
<p>SOFTSWISS managed services head Anastasia Vyshinskaia was equally pleased with Hamilton’s arrival and said that she was confident in his experience and the value he will bring to SOFTSWISS and help the company make its communication more personalized.</p>
<p>“We’re going to deep dive into VIP analytics and, as a result, increase the VIP segment’s revenue, Vyshinskaia concluded. Previously, SOFTSWISS added Popiplay, an up-and-coming studio as part of its aggregation platform.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, SOFTSWISS also published its crypto betting report, outlining the latest consumer habits involving crypto gaming worldwide and across SOFTSWISS’ network of partners.</p>
