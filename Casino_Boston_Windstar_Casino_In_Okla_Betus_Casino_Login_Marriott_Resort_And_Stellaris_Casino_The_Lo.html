    <h1>Casino Boston Windstar Casino In Okla Betus Casino Login Marriott Resort And Stellaris Casino The Lo</h1>

<p>I was wining big today, after a decided to stop and withdraw, I remembered to do the verification of my documents, I've opened the chat for informations and did all they request. After I returned to my girlfriend's place, I was going to show her the amount and maybe play a little bit more as the verification and withdraw would take some time.</p>
<p>At this moment my account was not avaiable anymore, I opened a new chat support, they told me that the closing was an administration decision and I should contact them by email, what I did.</p>
<p>Both of the email and chat support have told me the same thing, that I should read the Terms and Conditions, sector 9.1, what I did. I could not found nothing related to how I was using the Casino.</p>
<p>So now my account is closed, and they say that is irreversible.</p>
<p>After I started my documents verification, I played for a few hours, and won circa BRL 2000 more, at this time the games started to close all the time, sometimes I couldn't spin more than 5 times depending on the slot, as I was playing at the slots that I had the bigger wins mainly.</p>
<p>So now I'm at this very unfair situation, and I ask them which specific part of the sector 9.1 Terms and condictions I violated, no answer so far.</p>
<p>¹Obs: At the moment I started my verification process, I had the amount which I requested confirmation from the operator, as I said befor I won circa BRL 2000 more.</p>
<p>²Obs: I have videos a few videos of the playing session development, but they are too big for the upload, I'm also not sure if they would help or not.</p>
