<p>Mousasi Set to Defend His Bellator Title</p>
<p>Gegard Mousasi (48-7) is one of Bellator’s biggest stars, who’s been fighting in this promotion since 2017 when he moved there from the UFC. In his second Bellator fight, he won the Middleweight title, which he defended once before losing it to Rafael Lovato Jr. in summer 2019. A year later, he got ahold of the championship belt once again, and has been in its possession ever since.</p>
<p>During his second stint as the Bellator Middleweight champ, Mousasi has already defended his title once. It happened last August when he beat John Slater by technical knockout. That was his 27th career win by KO/TKO, which is proof that Mousasi is one of the best strikers in the promotion.</p>
<p>When it comes to Mousasi’s career losses, only one happened by KO/TKO, while he lost by submission and decision three times each.</p>
<p>Can Austin Vanderford Remain Undefeated?</p>
<p>Austin Vanderford got a title shot thanks to the fact that he remains undefeated in his professional career. The trouble is that despite already being in his thirties, he’s fought only 11 pro bouts. Five of those bouts happened under the banner of Bellator MMA.</p>
<p>Before joining this promotion, Vanderford competed in FFC, CCS, and a few other lower-lever promotions. He also tried himself in Dana White’s Tuesday Night Contender Series, but despite winning, he didn’t attract the attention of the UFC boss.</p>
<p>Maybe that will change if he becomes the new Bellator Middleweight champ? Perhaps, but winning the title is way easier said than done. The thing is that Vanderford has never fought such a good fighter as Mousasi.</p>
<p>All this explains why bookmakers see Mousasi as a huge favorite in Friday’s fight. Losing the title to Vanderford isn’t something this guy plans to allow.</p>
<p>Pick: Gegard Mousasi</p>
