<p>Jaguar Temple review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>The Jaguar Temple is a mythical site high up in the Andes, where the Aztec symbols on the walls mutate at sunset to form the Jaguar Temple slot. Holy braziers burn at either side, illuminating the hieroglyphs that could spell good fortune or total ruination for an unsuspecting explorer.</p>
<p>At least, that is the impression given by the Jaguar Temple, slot machine from Thunderkick. The slot refuses to give much away about its world, with a background that consists of a generic mountain sunset and the first few stars of the night.</p>
<p>The reels, on the other hand, have everything you’d hope for from a Mesoamerican themed slot, even if the story is rather thin on the ground in this game.</p>
<p>Base game win in Jaguar Temple slot</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The graphics of Jaguar Temple are nice and straightforward. The art style mimics temple carvings from Central America with a few stylised touches and plenty of colour.</p>
<p>The reels are near perfect with well-drawn art that feels appropriate to the theme of a jungle temple. However, the background is nondescript and undermines the tone set by the foreground.</p>
<p>The music can only part way make up for the loss of atmosphere, providing jungly beats and South American panpipe trilling to set the mood.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Jaguar Temple is a five reel slot with three rows and twenty win lines. There is a single free spin bonus game, no gamble feature, and only one interesting feature, which is the Jaguar symbol (these features are described in greater detail below).</p>
<p>The gameplay is pretty basic and covers only the bare minimum most players will expect from a modern slot.</p>
<p>You win with at least 3 adjacent Jaguar symbols anywhere on the reels</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter symbol.</p>
<p>The Jaguar Symbol pays out if you land three or more of them adjacent anywhere on a win line. This symbol comes in single or 3x3 sized block.</p>
<p>Three Scatter symbols anywhere on the reels will trigger the Bonus game. The Bonus game is a free spin feature. When the player triggers the Bonus with three Scatters, the Bonus game starts with 10 free spins. Four Scatters will give the player 15 free spins to start with, and five will give the player 20 free spins. The Bonus can be retriggered.</p>
<p>During the Bonus game, the 3x3 Jaguar block becomes more common and the Wild symbol expands to fill whatever reel it lands on.</p>
<p>3x3 Jaguar symbol can land on middle 3 reels in base or bonus game</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.10%, close enough to average for our purposes. Our yardstick for average is approximately 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.10 up to a maximum of $/£/€100.00 per spin.</p>
<p>Top symbols paytable for Jaguar Temple slot machine</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is at the high end of medium, which makes it a reasonable match for our preferred slot machine strategies.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Jaguar Temple is dull. The front end is given a cursory theme that barely holds together. The music is bland, the background nondescript and there are barely enough features cobbled together to call this a slot.</p>
<p>The return to player and volatility are acceptable but not nearly high enough to entice us in.</p>
<p>There are plenty of excellent Mesoamerican themed slots out there; give one of them a go instead. This is one to sacrifice atop the pyramids in return for something more compelling.</p>
