    <h1>Seven Feathers Casino Canyonville Oregon Casino Online Singapore Dotty S Casino Near Me Casino Mit B</h1>

<p>Resorts Digital Gaming has become the latest New Jersey iGaming operator to add products by Digital Gaming Corporation to its portfolio of games. As a result, ResortsCasino.com players will access many fan-favorite games delivered by DGC.</p>
<p>Player-Favorite Slots Heading for ResortsCasino.com</p>
<p>Some of the titles included in the partnership cover games such as 9 Masks of Fire and HyperStrike. Both games have been well-received in the Garden States across a network of operators.</p>
<p>Resorts Digital Gaming is adding them to its own portfolio of titles. There will be other games as well, including HyperGold, Adventures of Doubloon Island, and Assassin Moon, each of which will explore a different plot and gameplay feature.</p>
<p>As slots are becoming increasingly popular in the United States, the market is opening up to new experiences and varieties in order to match player preferences. The partnership that the two entities are embarking on will translate into other states meaning that DGC will be able to provide its suite of games in more places where ResortsCasino.com may start operating now or in the future.</p>
<p>Executives from both companies welcomed the move to strengthen their respective footprints in the fast-developing iGaming markets in the United States.</p>
<p>Resorts Digital Gaming CEO Ed Andrewes said that ResortsCasino already has a significant presence in the online slot market in New Jersey. It intends to continue strengthening its offer to elevate the player experience to the next level. Part of this strategy is teaming up with DGC:</p>
<p>“DGC’s focus on the US market is evident in the popularity of its slots among players in the Garden State and elsewhere, and we are delighted to be able to offer its content to our players for the first time who we believe will love the fun and thrills each title provides.” Resorts Digital Gaming CEO Ed Andrewes</p>
<p>Elevating the Experience as iGaming Momentum Increases</p>
<p>Meanwhile, DGC CCO of B2B iGaming Neill Whyte added that Resorts Digital Gaming is a partner that understands the need for bringing premium and diverse content to customers who seek a higher level of engagement and entertainment. He continued:</p>
<p>“Our games do just that, having been built especially for the US market. They are now some of the most spun slots in the Garden State, and we look forward to seeing ResortsCasino players enjoy the unrivaled experience they provide.” DGC CCO of B2B iGaming Neill Whyte</p>
<p>New Jersey is one of the oldest iGaming states in the United States. The first online casinos arrived in the early 2010s, but a recent push for iGaming has seen many new properties open doors. ResortsCasino.com launched in 2015. Over the past few years, PointsBet and FanDuel Casino have become some of the latest to set up their digital shop in the Garden State.</p>
