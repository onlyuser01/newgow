<p>Rampart Casino was happy to share the news, proudly emphasizing that the unlikely occurrence happened on its premises</p>
<p>A one-in-a-million situation has occurred at Rampart Casino in Las Vegas where a married man and woman simultaneously hit the Keno jackpot on two separate machines. The couple collectively won more than $100,000.</p>
<p>The unlikely happening was recorded on Saturday night at the casino. The two winners were playing Four Card Keno video machines at the property’s High Limit Bar. They were playing $1 hands when, as reported by the local TV channel KTNV, when they suddenly hit the jackpot on both machines.</p>
<p>The family preferred to remain anonymous and didn’t put their names behind their wins. Despite that, thanks to an announcement by the Rampart Casino, it is known that one of them won $87,240, while the other one claimed $13,048. In total, the couple won $100,288.</p>
<p>In Keno, players have to pick a few numbers, after which a random number generator draws a winning combination. As seen in a photo, one of the players hit a winning combination at the bottom right corner of the machine, while the other scored a win at the upper left corner of the machine.</p>
<p>“This happened right here!”</p>
<p>The Rampart Casino casino shared news of the unlikely occurrence, content that the unparalleled situation happened on its premises.</p>
<p>Despite being based in Vegas, the gambling venue is situated outside of the famous Las Vegas Strip. Visitors can enjoy a rich selection of slot games, linked progressives and a variety of table games. In addition, the venue offers its players an Asian restaurant, as well as a buffet and a spa.</p>

<p>In other news, a lucky winner just won the seventh Relax Gaming Dream Drop Jackpots via Unibet. Relax’s mechanic has proven to resonate with players, bringing more and more people toward its products. In the latest case, the winner took home a whopping $2 million.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Kansas’ Prairie Band Casino paid out a $1 million Ultimate Texas Hold’em jackpot. The winner, Steven L, started with a $5 progressive bet which made him eligible for one of four total progressive payouts. A lucky Royal Flush secured Mr L’s dominance.</p>
<p>At the beginning of this month, Instant Win Gaming reported that its eInstant progressive jackpot games have awarded multiple jackpots in 2023 alone.
