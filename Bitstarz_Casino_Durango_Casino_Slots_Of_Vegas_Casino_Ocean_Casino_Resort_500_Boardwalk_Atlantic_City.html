    <h1>Bitstarz Casino Durango Casino Slots Of Vegas Casino Ocean Casino Resort 500 Boardwalk Atlantic City</h1>

<p>I live in brazil for 2 years, been working here and have gained a family here, but I come from the states , My ID says USA, and I asked this casino from the very first day that I joined what is needed for a cash out , I specifically asked , do I just provide my btc address , and confirm the cash out via email, a very direct question, the agent told me to wait and then came back and told me to wait just a little longer to confirm the details , and told me yes that's that's all I needed to cash out , so at the time of cash out I got hit with kyc , which I have no problem doing, but now it's becoming a problem because they see my id is from USA, but I have proof of residency in brazil with energy bill I sent, they told me it wasn't a way to prove residency, they are saying it doesn't match the address in my profile, well I put the address that my id has , which is from the states , only reason I did that , is so it matches if I had to send ID, it would atleast match that, if I would of put my brazil address where I live now, they would of asked why it didn't match the ID I submitted, so I chose the best option I think and that was to have address match id, I feel when I asked about cash out from the start they should of mention this to me , they want to hold players to this high standard of I should of read the rules, well they should be held accountable for answering a question about those rules, when I asked about cashing out they never mentioned this, and again, I don't have a problem with the kyc I'll do it, but to not mention it when I asked weeks ago, and wait until I make a cash out , and then tell me I need kyc, well I could have already submitted the id and utility bill and if they had a problem verifying me 2 weeks ago I would have known not to play here , pretty much I could have tried to submit the documents when I asked about cash out 2 weeks ago and had this problem with 0$ in my account, but instead I'm dealing with it now with money in my account instead of 2 weeks ago when nothing was in my account, and they also told me they would accept the utility bill I submitted and then now saying it's taken out of context</p>
