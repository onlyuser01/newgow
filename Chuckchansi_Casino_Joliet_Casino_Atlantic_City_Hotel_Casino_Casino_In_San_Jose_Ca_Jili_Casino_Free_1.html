<p>Gambling.com Group Limited has confirmed that it will be entering the regulated online sports betting market in Ohio on January 1, 2023 and help legal brands to build up their footprint in the state</p>
<p>The company said that it will be providing marketing services to any third party that wishes to work with it and benefit from its extensive track record in managing and delivering services. The Group has already launched its dedicated BetOhio.com website which offers information on sports betting in the state and also helps guide local consumers in the betting and gambling landscape in the Buckeye State.</p>
<p>Gambling.com Group Is All Systems Go in Ohio</p>
<p>The website has already been doing some work on the ground with the website confirming that 15% of Ohio’s adult population was “likely” or “somewhat likely” to participate in sports gambling.</p>
<p>Out of all sports bettors, 57% of gamblers are expected to be gambling on sports at least once a week. The state is definitely a tempting prospect for any company that is looking to gain quick access to new affiliate markets and opportunities. There are eight million adult residents in the state, which means that sportsbooks are likely to get a big chunk of the action with close to one million likely to start gambling.</p>
<p>Gambling Group is also going to leverage its other assets to help licensed sportsbooks drive additional traffic and conversions. Presently, the group owns brands such as Bookies.com, BonusFinder.com, RotoWire.com, and Gambling.com, which it intends to use in Ohio.</p>
<p>Gambling.com Group CEO Charles Gillespie welcomed this new opportunity and highlighted its significance for the group. He said:</p>
<p>The expected launch of the legal online sports betting market in Ohio only adds to the tremendous amount of positive momentum we saw for the North American online gaming industry in 2022. Gambling.com Group CEO Charles Gillespie</p>
<p>Gillespie hailed the overall marketing and industry model Ohio has decided to set up, arguing that the model was particularly successful in ensuring that barriers are low and that a multitude of operators may enter, which is to the ultimate benefit of consumers in the state.</p>
<p>Ready to Help Bettors Navigate Ohio</p>
<p>The chief executive also expressed confidence that Gambling Group was in a good position to make the best of the new wave of legalization in the United States. The news was also welcomed by Gambling.com Group VP Caroline Smart who said that Ohio’s sports gambling will be on time for the NFL playoffs and Super Bowl, which is a big way to start gambling in the state.</p>
<p>“This is an exciting moment for sports bettors to finally place safe and responsible wagers with legal sportsbooks, after years of discussion and negotiation, and the robust offerings in the Ohio market will ensure there are plenty of choices and opportunities for customers,” Smart added, arguing that Gambling.com Group will be able to help gamblers navigate the myriad options available on the market.</p>
