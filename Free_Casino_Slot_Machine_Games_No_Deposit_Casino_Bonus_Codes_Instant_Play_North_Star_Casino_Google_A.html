    <h1>Free Casino Slot Machine Games No Deposit Casino Bonus Codes Instant Play North Star Casino Google A</h1>

<p>I joined iWild casino and have deposited several times through my bank which has gone through fine. When it comes to withdrawal I’m now verified and can withdraw, however, the bank option is not there. I was really annoyed with this, however, I did what they asked and opened up and Ecopayz and Mifinity account and added money into there to deposit so that I could withdraw my money which is wrong in itself as I’ve already deposited! However, I did this and attempted to deposit and you’ve restricted me from it going through on both accounts. So that means I have money in both those accounts now that is a battle to withdraw and I’ve lost money due to their fees!</p>
<p>I have been on Live Chat several times and keep getting the same old rubbish that I need to deposit from another method, I have tried them all and most are restricted to the Uk so you can’t just keep my money if you’re not giving me suitable ways to withdraw back to. You have taken from a UK bank account and the funds need to go back the same way for fraud and money laundering regulations. I have emailed your company 10 days ago I got one response 10 days ago that wasn’t helpful so I then sent a further 8 emails since 20th December and no reply! I’ve emailed to make a form complaint and no reply. My money is being held with it is mine to withdraw and you’ve been extremely unhelpful. I have asked for your CEO details and customer relations email address several times and nothing. I have emailed customer service and finance multiple times and nothing. Yet you can send me emails for bonuses every single day. I am on live chat every day and no one is helps me at all. I want this investigated and my money back to my bank.</p>
