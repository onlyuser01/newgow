    <h1>Cleopatra Jones And The Casino Of Gold Aria Casino Resort Casino Resorts In Arizona Boomtown Casino</h1>

<p>Yes I did.. I understand the original playthrough thing ..that’s when they said I need to wager again ...it is possible I jumped the gun after hearing more playthrough .. it’s been awhile , but thinking about it.. I’m willing to bet in all honesty they said 40 times.. again.. I am used to the one time deposit playthrough thing ..I would not have gotten mad about that. I am also willing to bet they were on their best behavior knowing that they were probably under scrutiny. Like I said .. you will not win off the free chip and you’ll end up giving them money.. guaranteed.</p>
<p>This is a different issue but I might as well tell you about this to all of your Saucify casinos that say "US players accepted?" It is very clear in the terms and conditions of all of them that United States players are not allowed. However, any customer service representative will say yes ..US players are allowed. I told one of them..well if you allow US players why is it in your terms and conditions that you do not? After a hesitation, I got a we do accept US players. So I told them well when your terms and conditions are current and say that you do I’ll consider depositing. Here’s the bottom line… That’s their ace in the hole… Technically they don’t have to pay you one single dime ..and especially if you win big I guarantee you they will use that against you that’s why it’s there.. most people don’t read the terms and conditions correct? Go look ...they are all clones just like a lot of the RTG Joints ..it is basically the same people ..you think they’d be smart and at least use different names for the customer service representatives...it scares me to think that there’s that many ignorant people in the world that don’t catch this.</p>
