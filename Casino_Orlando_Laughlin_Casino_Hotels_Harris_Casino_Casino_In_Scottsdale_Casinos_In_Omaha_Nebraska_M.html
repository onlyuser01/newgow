<p>MGM Resorts International has secured a new partnership with Major League Baseball players which will see the former partner access marketing and branding rights. Thanks to this multi-year arrangement, the hospitality company has become the Official Partner for MLB Players Inc, which means that the prominent gaming brand will have access to the image and likeness of athletes and leverage these assets to bolster its own marketing footprint.</p>
<p>MLBPA Strikes Partnership with MGM Resorts</p>
<p>MLBPA chief operating officer Xavier D. James commented on this new partnership opportunity, welcoming the addition of MGM Resorts as its newest partner. He said:</p>
<p>As a leader in the gaming and hospitality industry, MGM Resorts is an ideal business partner for us. This collaboration reinforces the importance of leveraging Players to facilitate marketing initiatives. We look forward to growing this valuable and strategic relationship in the years ahead. MLBPA chief operating officer Xavier D. James</p>
<p>MLB Players Inc operates as a for-profit corporate entity that is part of the MLB Players Association. Effectively, the company seeks to ensure that baseball athletes receive additional funding and revenue streams through such partnerships. The company also holds the exclusive rights to use the likeness of athletes, including their names, numbers, signatures, playing records, and biographical data.</p>
<p>The organization can also sub-license these assets as it sees fit with the goal of providing additional revenue for the players and the corporate entity. Moving forward, MGM Resorts will now be able to leverage these assets through digital and retail channels and across Japan, the United States, and even China.</p>
<p>MLB Players to Get Hospitality Benefits</p>
<p>In this particular case, MLB Players will get “hospitality benefits” with MGM Resorts providing the official Player House hospitality space for each season’s All-Star Game while the partnership lasts.</p>
<p>MGM Resorts will also serve as the Official Offseason Destination partner for MLB Players. There will be a variety of benefits and programs developed in conjunction with MGM Resorts properties. MGM Resorts SVP of sports &amp; sponsorships Lance Evans said that the new partnership further strengthens the company’s commitment to baseball in the United States.</p>
<p>“We welcome the opportunity to host MLB Players at our world-class resorts and create unique player experiences for our valued MGM Rewards members,” Evans said.</p>
