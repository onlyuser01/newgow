<p>Siren's Treasures review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>The sirens of Homeric legend were half-bird, half-woman and sang with such intoxicating voices that men would wreck themselves on the rocks about their islands following their musical lure.</p>
<p>However, anyone bold enough to brave this slot’s various rocky waters might come away with some portion of their treasure. If they aren’t wrecked upon the rocks, that is.</p>
<p>On the reels, sunken chests and amphoras live alongside still floating triremes and alluring sirens. While an excellent theme for a slot, its execution leaves a lot to be desired.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The music is probably this slots strongest feature, a rousing movie style soundtrack with ghostly choral undertones designed to imitate the song of the sirens.</p>
<p>The rest of the game’s front end is much weaker, the background is a pretty typical looking seascape while the reels are messy and uninterestingly designed. No care seems to have been given to generating a unified feel for this slot. It seems like each individual aspect of the visuals and animations was designed in a hermetically sealed room.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>The base game is a pretty standard five by three slot with fifty winlines.</p>
<p>Some effort has been made to spice up this formula by adding a Mystery symbol which adds nothing to the gameplay except for delays, by hiding a few identical symbols and revealing them to be all identical.</p>
<p>More usefully there are win multiplier symbols that apply a multiplier of between two and five to any wins on that spin. There are also basic Free Spin and Bonus games (details below). All in all, Siren’s Treasures tries and magnificently fails to be anything more than the most standard of slots.</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Free Spin and Bonus symbols. The Wild symbols are frequently stacked. If three Wilds land to fill up one whole reel, then wins are calculated, the Wilds locked in place, and a re-spin takes place.</p>
<p>Three or more Bonus symbols anywhere on the reels will trigger the Bonus game. This is a simple picking game where you turn over icons to reveal prizes.</p>
<p>Three or more Free Spin symbols anywhere on the reels will trigger the Free Spin feature with 10 free spin.</p>
<p>During Free Spins, a three times multiplier is applied to all wins and Wild’s are sticky. When a sticky Wild lands on the reel, it remains in place for all future free spins.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>Spinomenal does not provide the return to player information for this slot. This is a real red flag for us, as the absence of this information could be covering for an extortionate vigorish.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.50 up to a maximum of $/£/€500.00 per spin. This tips the balance heavily towards those with some serious coin to spend.</p>
<p>The volatility of Siren’s Treasures is medium, which makes it a poor match for our preferred slot machine strategies that favour highly volatile slots.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Like most of Spinomenal’s offerings, Siren’s Treasures disappoints at almost every level. Their slots come with routinely low returns to the player, and this slot is no exception. Couple this with the lazy design and low volatility and this slot is easily dismissed.</p>
<p>On top of this we noted frequent server issues with the Spinomenal slots we tested, which were not present on other slots. Your mileage may vary.</p>
