<p>The leader in identity, Know Your Customer (KYC) and anti-fraud services, Aristotle Integrity, announced it signed a new partnership with the provider of world-class identity verification and authentication solutions, Incode Technologies Inc. Details regarding the new collaboration emerged earlier this week and see Aristotle deliver an Incode-powered Integrity AutoDoc solution. Thanks to the new collaboration, Aristotle will strengthen its offering for its clients within the sports betting and online gambling sector.</p>
<p>Lauded as a revolutionary partnership, the collaboration sees Aristotle integrate Incode's solution into its suite of identity and age verification offerings. Per the new deal, the company will provide supreme services by improving its Electronic Know Your Customer (eKYC) service along with Integrity IDV and AML.</p>
<p>Ultimately, thanks to the collaboration, the leading provider of anti-fraud services will leverage Incode's leading biometric and document verification technologies. This world-class technology stands out from the competition considering that it is easy to use and offers high processing speeds.</p>
<p>Ricardo Amper, Incode's CEO and Founder, commented on the topic in a statement. "The challenges of compliance expenses, data responsibility, and the rise of age verification concerns underscore the difficulties legacy identity systems pose for iGaming and gambling," he said. Finally, Amper pointed out: "Now, Aristotle is powering AutoDoc with Incode's global, end-to-end identity orchestration offerings to enable seamless attestation that protects against fraud and underaged gambling and gaming without needlessly giving away PPI."</p>
<p>Michael Bolcerek, Aristotle's SVP of Business Development, was similarly delighted about the new collaboration. He said: "We are excited to partner with Incode to offer our customers access to Incode's next-generation ID verification technology for enhanced speed and ease of use across a variety of sectors." Last but not least, Bolcerek outlined that Aristotle is delighted to elevate the offering for its clients by providing additional capabilities that improve user experience and enhance privacy.</p>
<p>The latest collaboration between the duo will see Aristotle leverage Incode's Passive Liveness Detection solution. This solution will enable partners of the company to determine if a live person is trying to register, strengthening efforts against fraud.</p>
<p>Without any doubt, the collaboration with Incode will bring benefits to Aristotle and its clients. Currently, Aristotle has a growing presence in North America, considering that it is licensed in 22 different US states and territories. The company offers onboarding services for major gambling operators within the sector in the country.</p>
