    <h1>Casino Near Indianapolis Vernon Downs Casino Hotel Vernon Ny Caribbean Casino Kirkland Atlantic City</h1>

<p>Hello casino guru,</p>
<p>I am having a problem with this casino. I started playing in this casino a few days ago. I saw the welcome offer and made a deposit of 30€ with the code MOND1. I got the bonus, started playing and then i lost. Later i saw there is the weekend reload bonus that you can take 100% bonus on saturday or sunday with the code MOND100. So i said to try out. I deposit 30€ and then i lost all my money. Later I tried to get the second bonus from the welcome offer. With the code MOND2 i deposit 50€. After completing the wager i made 3 withdrawal requests. 1000€-1000€-800€. I sent the documents for the verification and my account is verified now. Then the next i got an email from the casino that i got advantange of the welcome bonus (???).</p>
<p>10.2.3 To claim any deposit bonus from the Welcome offer, player must make a minimum deposit of 20 EUR, 20 USD, 20 CAD, 20 AUD or 200 NOK. Deposit bonuses are valid for all new qualifying players of Mondcasino for their first three (3) deposits only as specified below in following order; first deposit with bonus code MOND1. Second deposit with bonus code MOND2 and third deposit with bonus code MOND3. Maximum amount to claim third deposit bonus (bonus code: MOND3) from Welcome offer is two times amount of second deposit (code: MOND2). Should a player violate any rule from this clause he, we will forfeit the bonus as well as any winnings which have resulted from the payout of the bonus or other games which were completed during the violation period.</p>
<p>I didn't advantage any offer. I just saw that there are plenty of bonuses in a casino and i tried them out. They also said</p>
<p>" You have claimed 2nd deposit bonus with your 3rd deposit which is against bonus T&amp;C. You have left us no choice than to retract your winnings and set balance to your initial deposit."</p>
<p>Also for the weekend reload bonus i wasn't valid to take it since i didn't have a clean deposit in the last 7 days. I didn't see this specific rule so my second deposit for that bonus was invalid and therefore it doesn't count. Because if i would win all my wins would be void.</p>
<p>I can't understand what's the problem with the order of getting the bonuses? I mean bonus is a bonus. You have chance to lose your money and same you have chance to win money. I believe this action from the casino is just do not pay the winnings. Can you help me?</p>
