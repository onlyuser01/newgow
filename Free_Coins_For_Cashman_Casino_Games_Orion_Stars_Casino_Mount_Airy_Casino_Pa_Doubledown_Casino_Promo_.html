<p>Wizard Games has launched Magic Baccarat, a new title with side bets that bring a twist to the popular table game</p>
<p>NeoGames S.A.’s subsidiary which mixes proven recipes with innovative concepts to create highly valuable iGaming experiences has announced the launch of the new game meant to add an engaging twist to the regular card staple.</p>
<p>The studio which is constantly busy adapting its games and tools to the players’ expectations and preferences has added Baccarat Magic to its library of 120+ casino games.</p>
<p>Magic Baccarat Carries the Fun and Payouts to a Different Level</p>
<p>Players are given the opportunity to place all types of classic bets, including Banker, Tie, and Player, with a 1:1 payout for each. The element of magic comes from the added option of placing side bets like Super 6, Banker Pair, and Player Pair. Each of these alternative side bets comes with a payment of up to 12x. Players need to focus on getting a hand with a value that is as close to nine as possible for a maximum win of 13x on each hand.</p>
<p>The game follows the release of other equally exciting Wizard Games titles, including Dragons of the North Blackjack and Sultan’s Palace Fortune.</p>
<p>The company’s managing director Joey Hurtado spoke about the new title, calling it “another strong launch” while explaining how the new table game incorporates familiar gameplay with profitable side bets. Hurtado also spoke about the studio’s efforts to constantly introduce versatile content to their players, ranging from fully immersive video slot games to standard games with a lot of stylish elements.</p>
<p>Side Bets That Keep Players’ Winning Streaks Rolling</p>
<p>To start winning, players can opt for the three standard bets. To increase their winnings and make their gameplay more interesting, they can choose the special Player Pair and Banker Pair side bets with an 11:1 payout.</p>
<p>The Super 6 alternative bet brings a 12:1 payout when the banker’s hand wins with a 6. The Bead Plate puts players’ last played hands on display, together with their outcomes. Players can use this information and mix it with their Baccarat strategy so they can enjoy an edge while playing.</p>
<p>Wizard Games’ portfolio is currently available in over 20 regulated jurisdictions worldwide, spread all around North America, Latin America, and Europe.</p>
<p>At the beginning of February, the company appointed industry veteran Yoganand Aiyadurai as the director of game technology. Last November, the company made another strategic move by appointing Simon Jagdhar as director of game studio to assist it with reaching its growth goals.</p>
