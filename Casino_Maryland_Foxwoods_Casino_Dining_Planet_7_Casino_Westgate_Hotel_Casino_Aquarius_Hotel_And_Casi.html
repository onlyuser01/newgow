<p>Support for the initiative came from Clark County Commissioner Tick Segerblom who spoke on Tuesday at the rally. He said: “A lot of these employees have worked for years and years, are out of work, and there’s no clear sign of when (all) these hotels will open up“. Segerblom added that although employers are looking to hire less experienced and younger personnel, the senior employees are the ones who have made Las Vegas great.</p>
<p>The Workers Have Helped to Build Nevada</p>
<p>Tuesday’s “Right to Return” rally urged employers to offer all workers, regardless if union-represented or not, throughout multiple industries to return to their jobs in Clark County once the businesses reopen. “Workers have helped to build Nevada into the tourism and entertainment capital of the world,” outlines a statement released by the Culinary Union last week.</p>
<p>“I was born &amp; raised in Las Vegas. I’ve seen our community come together during the hardest of times. 📣 Working families need our County Commissioners to come together now.” 💯- Matthew, 15-year Station Casinos worker pic.twitter.com/DM2I5885gG — The Culinary Union (@Culinary226) October 6, 2020</p>
<p>According to the Culinary Union statement, many of the workers have helped sick, injured, and elderly residents. In addition, the Union stressed that thanks to the workers, the city grew to be one of the best places to live and raise a family. In conclusion, the union outlined that the workers have lost their jobs or were furloughed through no fault of their own and they should have the right to come back to their workplace.</p>
