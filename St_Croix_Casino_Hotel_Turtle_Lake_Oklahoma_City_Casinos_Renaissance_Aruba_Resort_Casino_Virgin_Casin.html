<p>Sports data and technology provider Genius Sports has entered a partnership with Latin American gambling operator Betcris. Through this deal, Betcris will get full access to Genius Sports’ valuable sports data and betting data, while Genius Sports will reinforce its presence on the LATAM market.</p>
<p>The Benefits of Being a Genius Sports Partner</p>
<p>Betcris’ official release informs that as the official sponsor of the National Football League and the Major League Baseball in the region, the operator will use Genius Sports’ offerings to further immerse millions of local fans into the sports action. To this end, Betcris will be given access to the full pool of data and video content that Genius Sports piles through thousands of annual sports events. This will include all NFL-related data, content, and information about the player acquisition, etc.</p>
<p>The partnership will make Betcris among the first betting operators in LATAM to implement a full Genius Sports NFL offering with all the necessary statistics, live data, Next Gen Stats data, and also sports betting data.</p>
<p>Genius Sports is responsible for the National Football League’s regulated sports wagering marketing across the NFL’s digital outlets and media. Among this betting advertising inventory are the official data feeds for the league that will be especially important for Betcris.</p>
<p>Betcris’ chief executive officer, JD Duarte, spoke on the deal. He said that since Betcris’ main mission is to create entertainment opportunities for its clients, the operator seeks to collaborate with the most reputable companies that increase the value of its offerings and help fans to receive the best betting experience.</p>
<p>“Genius Sports is without a doubt one of those companies. With this agreement, we secure access to accurate and official data that allows us to enhance our product offering for the benefit of one of our most important stakeholders: our customer,” Duarte explained.</p>
<p>The Two Partners Seek to Expand Their Offerings to New Markets</p>
<p>As a partner, Genius Sports will provide its full support to Betcris. Through the sports data company’s invaluable data feeds, Betcris’ sportsbook will receive an unparalleled opportunity to grow, reach more people and engage more sports fans than ever. Enthusiasts across all sports will have a rich choice of hundreds of games to wager on and will be aided in making informed decisions through Genius Sports’ data.</p>
<p>Finally, Betcris will be deploying BetBuilder – a fully automated single-game parlay solution that is developed by Genius Sports and Sportcast. BetBuilder currently supports the major soccer events, along with the National Football League, the National Basketball League, the National Hockey League, and the Major League Baseball.</p>
<p>Genius Sports has been enjoying much popularity recently, with various companies seeking to benefit from its state-of-the-art data solutions. The company was recently chosen as Yardbarker’s exclusive reseller and as a partner to Barstool Sportsbook. Genius recently got a new overseer who will manage the company’s quick growth. Betcris, on the other hand, recently expanded into Europe by entering the Polish market.</p>
