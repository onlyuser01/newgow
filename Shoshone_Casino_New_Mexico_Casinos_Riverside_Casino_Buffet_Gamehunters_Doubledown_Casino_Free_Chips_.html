<p>The rebranding of its flagship game comes along with a significant increase in the prizes, including new raffles and higher rewards</p>
<p>The lottery that operates on behalf of 12 local society lotteries in Great Britain, the Health Lottery, confirmed its plans for a rebranding of its flagship lottery game. On Monday, the lottery revealed that it plans to not only overhaul its brand with a new logo and identity but also implement a new prize structure.</p>
<p>The flagship lottery game has taken a new name, The Big Win, which will be in effect starting with the drawing scheduled for Tuesday night. The rebranded five-times-a-week lottery game has also implemented a new prize structure.</p>
<p>As a part of the change, matching four balls on any draw will now bring a higher prize, the lottery reveals. Previously, matching four balls granted a prize of £250 ($318) and that sum will now increase to £300 ($381).</p>
<p>Most notable is the change regarding the lottery’s Saturday draw. The main prize for its free second chance prize draw was £250,000 ($317,000) previously. However, in light of the changes, that prize will be increased nearly double, to £475,000 ($603,200).</p>
<p>Further changes within the Health Lottery’s rebranding bring a special Mega Monday promotion. That change sees anyone participating in QuickWin on Mondays tap into a £500 ($635) raffle. Moreover, the changes bring in a £500 ($635) raffle for participants in Super Sunday instant win games on Sundays.</p>
<p>Elevating the experience for the players even further, Health Lottery’s players that use direct debit will be entered into a monthly raffle. The automatic participation in the raffle will reward 10 players with £100 ($127) each on a monthly basis.</p>
<p>Rebranding to Help Appeal to More Players</p>
<p>Lebby Eyres, the Health Lottery’s CEO, explained that the increase for the Saturday night free prize draw seeks to boost customer engagement. According to her, the current prize is the highest one a society lottery operator can offer. Eyres added: “Players will be able to win a truly life-changing amount from this weekend’s draw. Though the free second chance prize draw jackpot will almost double, tickets to the main draw will still cost £1.”</p>
<p>“To improve our appeal to players, we’ve increased our Saturday night free prize draw to the highest level possible for a society lottery operator.“ Lebby Eyres, CEO of The Health Lottery</p>
<p>The Lottery’s CEO added that the rebranding seeks to give the draw “its own identity.” She spoke about the expansion of the lottery’s portfolio of games and acknowledged that its main game needed to stand out from its other products. Besides the main game, the Health Lottery offers online instant win games, All or Nothing, as well as QuickWin games.</p>
