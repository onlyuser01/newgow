    <h1>Casino Guru Hollywood Fl Hard Rock Casino Casino Bus Trips Near Me Casino In Canada Casino Technolog</h1>

<p>Dear Casino Guru support,</p>
<p>On the 9th of November I requested a withdrawal to the amount of 3752 euros. Considering I had reached my withdrawal limit for the day, it became a pending transaction with a time frame of 72 hours to be processed. After waiting for 96 hours and the withdrawal still being marked as pending, I contacted Pokerstars livechat support. They told me that I am required to submit additional documentation to verify my account. This was the first annoyance, as I doubt they would have made any effort to make me aware of this and waited for me to make contact.</p>
<p>I have been playing with Pokerstars for nearly 5 years, have verified previously, and made plenty of withdrawals before. So immediately after (on the 14th), I submit a copy of my passport and bank statement from N26. After waiting 4 days I contact live chat support on the 18th and they inform me N26 is cannot be used and to provide an alternate document.</p>
<p>I had opened my account in Germany, though due to Coronavirus, I moved rather unexpectedly back to Luxembourg at the beginning of the outbreak. I did not have any applicable utility bills that were less than 3 months old or anything else relevant because I cancelled everything before I left. I explained this fact, said that I am currently in Luxembourg and provided them with 3 relevant documents all less than 3 months old, all original scanned copies from government agencies with my name and address (on the 18th). I receive a reply on the 19th, relating to the initial submission on the 14th, again confirming that N26 cannot be used for verification and to submit something applicable from a specified list.</p>
<p>As of today 23rd of November, my withdrawal is still pending and have not heard anything concerning the relevant documentation I provided on the 18th. I am honestly quite insulted at the service. I have played there for years, sent plenty of business their way. This issue could have been resolved in less than 15 minutes with direct contact to the correct department.</p>
