<p>Gaming revenue in Pennsylvania increased by 50% year-on-year for July as the state posted its record monthly figure.</p>
<p>The state’s Gaming Control Board reported a record month which saw total revenue reach $423.7m, surpassing the previous best tally of $413.2m which was set in May.</p>
<p>The board attributed the significant revenue rise to an end of strict social distancing and capacity limits on casino venues from May 2021. The pandemic, which caused all land-based venues in the US to be closed from mid-March 2020, was still rife last July when casinos were operating at reduced capacity, with Rivers Casino Pittsburgh and Rivers Casino Philadelphia closed for portions of that month.</p>
<p>In that respect, the board said it a more accurate comparison of July’s figures would be pitting it against July 2019, which would represent a rise of 51% when total revenue was $281.5m.</p>
<p>In terms of verticals, total online gaming revenue was up 63% from last year up to $88.7m, but down slightly from $88.9m in June. Online slots revenue came in at $63.2m which was 60% more than the same period last year, while online table games was up 92% to $22.9m. However, online poker revenue fell 13% down to $2.6m.</p>
<p>The state’s sports betting handle for July was down 28% from June, with $304.4m in wagers placed online and in retail sportsbooks. This was 85% higher than the same period last year but the lowest recorded total since July 2020, which was the last month handle was reported at being less than $364m.</p>
<p>Gross gaming revenue (GGR) for sports betting fell 35% from June to $27.5m which was still 101% higher than the same period last year, with $19.9m generated in taxable revenue.</p>
<p>According to lead analyst for PlayUsa.com Dustin Gouker, the decrease in sports betting revenue could be due to a slight lull in worldwide sport despite the NBA Finals and the Olympics taking place. He also said a surge in nationwide travel and family vacations played a part and that the start of the National Football League (NFL) season on 9 September should provide a welcome boost for sportsbooks.</p>
