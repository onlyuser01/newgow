<p>Land-based casinos have been pondering an existential question – how do they reach younger customers and do away with their image of hospitable venues for chain-smoking penny-slot-obsessed gamblers only, changing it up to a more chic repute instead?</p>
<p>A new study by LaneTerralever may hold the answer to that, with the full-service marketing and customer experience agency, focusing on analyzing what motivates casino players to visit, and particularly among younger generations such as Millennials and Gen Z.</p>
<p>According to the 2024 Casino Player Trends Report: How Non-Gaming Activities Are Transforming Casinos, this mostly has to do with offering non-gaming options, such as restaurants and bars, hotel amenities, and live entertainment, which explains why land-based venues from The Strip to the Boardwalk have been booking known performers to assume residency.</p>
<p>In fact, 83.9% of Millennials and 80.5% of Gen Z players confirmed that they cherish such opportunities, and although the number of people who say the same across generations is slightly lower (65.3% for Boomers) and (76.1% for Gen X), the fact remains that there is an appreciation for this particular kind of activities across all social strata.</p>
<p>Non-gaming activities seem to be a chief driver among generations as they create value that combines nicely with gaming, but casino floors alone are not reason enough for players to seek out a visit to a prominent casino operator.</p>
<p>The study was conducted in partnership with Professor Anthony F. Lucas from UNLV’s College of Hospitality, and polled participants between the ages of 21-75. There has been another telling factor about consumer habits as well, the study outlined, focusing on a phenomenon known as "group visits" where organized trips to land-based casinos, especially amongst the young, have been a strong incentive to travel and play at local casinos.</p>
<p>Some 80% of people visiting local casinos for example do so in groups. Commenting on the findings of the survey, LaneTerralever VP of Marketing Nick Dan-Bergman has spoken about the importance of better calibrating businesses to consumer expectations.</p>
<p>"Our study underscores the prevalence of the experience economy and how important it is for casino operators to continue to hone and expand their experiential and entertainment-focused offerings, particularly to attract the attention of younger generations and maintain long-term loyalty of all players."</p>
<p>It’s important to understand how land-based operators may appeal to customers who are driven by the non-gaming activities on-site, and where they usually spend around 50% of their money while on a visit.</p>
<p>Non-gaming features can actually have a strong impact on customer loyalty as well, with this surprisingly being the case across all four demographics mentioned in the study, to name Millennials (69.3%), Gen Z (65.7%), Gen X (61.3%), and the rear traditionally brought up by Boomers (56.9%).</p>
