<p>We are a day away from the 2021 Butterfield Bermuda Championship that will be played in Southampton. Tee-off is set for Thursday, October 28 and the field of competitors brings a good number of Top-50 golfers, although there has been a decline. Regardless, the competition will be an opportunity for underdogs such as Hayden Buckley and Chad Ramey to make their mark on it, but the spotlight has a few other names in focus.</p>
<p>Most eyeballs will be on Matthew Fitzpatrick who just won the European Tour, complementing his Ryder Cup performance with yet another decent golf session. To truly appreciate the event, you will probably want to have a quick look at the available odds. Here is what they feature.</p>
<p>Odds to Win 2021 Butterfield Bermuda Championship</p>
<p>Drivers Odds Matthew Fitzpatrick +1000 Christiaan Bezuidenhout +1200 Mito Pereira +1600 Patrick Reed +2000 Hayden Buckley +2000 Chad Ramey +2500 Takumi Kanaya +2800 Mathias Schwab +3500 Adam Hadwin +3500 Taylor Pendrith +3500 Guido Migliozzi +4000 Danny Willett +4000 Patrick Rodgers +4500 Stephan Jaeger +4500 Deny McCarthy +5000 *Odds as of October 27 at DraftKings</p>

<p>: Golf Channel Location: Port Royal Golf Course, Southampton, Bermuda</p>
<p>The 2021 Butterfield Bermuda Championship will take play at Port Royal Golf Course at Southampton, Bermuda. The event will be teeing off on Thursday, October 28, and will feature a massive prize purse of $6.5 million. You may watch the event on Golf Channel.</p>
<p>Who Should You Look out for in 2021 Butterfield Bermuda Championship</p>
<p>Even though some of the Top-50 golfers won’t be making an appearance in Bermuda tomorrow, there is no reason to doubt the quality of the competition. Matthew Fitzpatrick is naturally given the best odds of winning. He won the Andalucía Masters and finished T20 in the BMW Championship.</p>
<p>Both performances were an improvement on him missing the cut in the Northern Trust and Italian Open. He will not be the only golfer swinging for victory on Thursday. A lot seems to ride on Mito Pereira who is listed at (+1600) and who is expected to make his mark on the Butterfield Bermuda Championship.</p>
<p>Pereira is a two-time winner of the Korn Ferry Tour and he has been making big strides in his professional golfing career. He has posted a number of Top-6 finishes and he has been delivering well on gained strokes. Oddmakers have noticed the progress made over the past year and they give him a good chance to contest the title once again in Bermuda.</p>
<p>Is Pereira a good bet here? He most certainly is. There are many other opportunities to release a good bet digging further down in the odds.</p>
<p>What Underdogs to Bet on in Bermuda?</p>
<p>The Bermuda event will feature several great golfers you may want to place a wager on. Brian Gay is posted at (+10000) but if you are looking for a decent long-shot bet, you may want to go with the defending champion. Gay, though has had a few bad beats of late, which have made him not perform too well in several competitions.</p>
<p>Seamus Power (+2000) looks like another strong contender. He has clocked in three Top-10 finishes along the way and has been able to gain a decent number of strokes since the beginning of the year. Power finished T-21 in the Shriners Hospitals for Children Open. He missed the cut at the Sanderson Farms Championship.</p>
