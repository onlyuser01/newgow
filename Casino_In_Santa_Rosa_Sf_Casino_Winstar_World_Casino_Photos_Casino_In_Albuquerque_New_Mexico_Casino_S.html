<p>Chris Moneymaker, the famous poker pro and 2003 WSOP World Championship winner had second thoughts about participating in the main event this year. Now, it seems that he changed his mind and joined the event, surprising other participants.</p>
<p>Moneymaker Changes His Mind, Joins the WSOP Main Event</p>
<p>It was back in August when Moneymaker decided to cancel his trip to El Paso and Las Vegas for the WSOP. A prime reason for that decision was the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Moneymaker said on Twitter that his child couldn’t be vaccinated and he didn’t want to bring the virus home. Undoubtedly, this was a difficult decision at the time but not unexpected, considering the pandemic.</p>
<p>After that, rumors online and hints by Moneymaker himself claimed that he will participate in WSOP’s Main Event. However, there was nothing solid until early this week. On Tuesday, Moneymaker joined Day 1F of the WSOP Main Event and undoubtedly surprised the other participants.</p>
<p>Via Twitter, the poker champion posted multiple updates and one of them outlines that his “WSOP adventure begins.” While Moneymaker’s adventure starts, Justin Bonomo who is a fellow high-stakes professional player blasted another pro player who tested positive for COVID-19 but failed to inform other players.</p>
<p>More Poker Pros Join the WSOP Main Event</p>
<p>Born in Atlanta, Georgia, currently Moneymaker lives in Nashville, Tennessee. According to WSOP, by now, the poker pro has 14 cashes from tournaments. His earnings from WSOP have so far reached $2,584,979. Undoubtedly, his biggest win dates back to the $10,000 No-Limit Hold’em Main Event World Championship that dates back to 2003. Back then, the poker pro won first place, taking home a staggering $2.5 million prize along with a WSOP bracelet.</p>
<p>In 2009, Moneymaker participated in the $440 No-Limit Hold’em event and won 2nd place. That tournament got him a $16,552 prize. Additionally, in 2019, he also participated in the 2018/2019 $400 No-Limit Hold’em event. Back then he ranked 2nd once again and collected a $10,708 prize.</p>
<p>Before entering the Main Event this year, Moneymaker participated in the 2019 Main Event. Back then, he took 687th place and earned a $20,200 prize. Now, the poker champion is back on the table and it will be interesting what place he will take this year and if he will collect a second WSOP bracelet.</p>
<p>Besides Moneymaker, other famous poker pros such as Mustapha Kanit have also joined the Main Event. Moreover, the tournament proved interesting for Nate Silver, as well as iconic poker pro Doyle Brunson, who has also joined the Main Event.</p>
