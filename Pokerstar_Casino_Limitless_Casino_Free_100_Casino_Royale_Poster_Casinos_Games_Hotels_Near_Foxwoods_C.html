<p>Twin Spin Megaways review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>This game meshes a few classic slot themes including fruit, gems, and bells.</p>
<p>Players will see familiar symbols from cherries to sparkling diamonds. They’ll embrace a vintage aesthetic as they snag as many goodies as possible.</p>
<p>The game is a great fit for players in the mood for a retro slot machine experience, with a modern sensibility.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The festive soundtrack makes it clear players are entering a roaring party with a bit of a ‘90s feel. This music feels in line with the slot’s classic theme.</p>
<p>Though the symbols reference classic slot themes, their animation feels fresh, high quality and slick. The diamonds are luminous and self-aware of their art cartoon style while the cherries seem to glow red.</p>
<p>The reels flash with tiny light bulbs that add extra drama to wins and create the reel of playing on a reel machine.</p>
<p>The backdrop of the game is shafts of neon-like light leading in towards the reels. This brings the focus straight to the gameplay and adds a sense of glitz. The style of the game as a whole brings to mind a glamorous late night in a casino.</p>
<p>Overall, the animation and music of this game live up to its theme and create a retro atmosphere.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>This game uses the Megaways system, which randomises the amount of symbols on the reels with each spin.</p>
<p>Wins are awarded for matching symbols on adjacent reels from left to right.</p>
<p>This slot also uses a cascade feature, meaning that symbols in winning combinations vanish upon payouts. This leaves their positions open for new symbols to fall in.</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter symbol. The Wild symbol will only appear on reels 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.</p>
<p>In the Free Spins feature, Wild symbols may have multipliers of x2 or x3.</p>
<p>The Free Spins feature is triggered when 5 symbols land anywhere. Players begin the feature with 15 free spins and can receive 15 additional free spins for landing 5 Scatters again.</p>
<p>If players land more than 5 Scatters, the additional Scatters provide 1 extra free spin each.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.04%, about our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.10 up to a maximum of $/£/€100 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is on the high end of medium , which makes it a reasonable match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We recommend this average RTP, high-medium volatility classically themed slot.</p>
<p>With decent volatility and a well-interpreted theme, this game is a great balance of positive qualities that players won’t be sorry to try out.</p>
<p>The swift gameplay and bonus opportunities keep the game engaging and fun.</p>
