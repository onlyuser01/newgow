<p>Michigan authorities have confiscated 100 gambling machines and $29,204 in profits from allegedly illicit operations at storefront casinos located in Genesee County. The court-ordered raids took place last week near the county seat of Flint and were announced today.</p>

<p>The April 27 raids took place at The State Road Spot in Davison and The Bristol Spot in Burton. Authorities initially received a tip about the Burton operation. It led to finding out about the Davison storefront, too, authorities revealed.</p>
<p>Police found 35 machines at The Burton Spot. They include 12 standalone gaming machines and 23 gaming computer towers. At the State Road Spot, police found 65 machines, including 11 standalone gaming machines and 54 gaming computer towers. Also seized were 62 gift cards.</p>
<p>The searches were undertaken after an inquiry by the Michigan Gaming Control Board (MGCB) and investigators from the office of state Attorney General Dana Nessel.</p>
<p>Henry Williams, MGCB executive director, said such raids curb criminal activity.</p>
<p>“Illegal gambling machine operations bring unwanted crime to communities across Michigan, and deprive school districts of gaming tax revenue from the state to support education,” Williams said in a statement.</p>
<p>Earlier Raid</p>
<p>In March, Lansing, Mich. officials announced they had searched two suspected illegal gambling dens housed in local storefronts. Authorities seized 82 gambling machines, as well as $91,500 in cash, it was reported.</p>
<p>The second location, identified as “Games of Skill,” was searched on March 4. Officials seized 13 slots and seven gambling games, the report added.</p>
<p>Investigators from the Attorney General’s office, the MGCB, and Lansing Police Department took part.</p>
<p>The MGCB was contacted by Lansing cops in October to get help in investigating possible illegal gambling operations, officials said. It was in 2018 when a Lansing woman was sentenced to prison and four other suspects pleaded guilty to conducting an illegal gambling operation at a Logan Square shopping center storefront, officials said.</p>
<p>On Feb. 28, the Logan Square Shopping Center was also raided. Some 62 machines were seized. Among them were 28 slot machines, a virtual blackjack table, as well as other casino-style gambling devices, MLive.com, a regional news site in Michigan, said.</p>
<p>Chicago Gambling Den</p>
<p>In an unrelated incident, a Chicago storefront was allegedly being used for illegal gaming, and prostitution, and even had a possible methamphetamine lab there, a published report earlier this year said. The one-story building also was structurally unsound and dangerous, officials said. It later was demolished.</p>
<p>Several gaming machines reportedly were seized from the building during a Feb. 8 raid. The court-ordered search was led by federal agents and Chicago cops. The Chicago Sun-Times also reported that Allen Isip, 34, who worked in the building, was charged by police.</p>
<p>He was accused of keeping a gambling place, the newspaper said. He claimed to be the “host” at the operation.</p>
