<p>BREACH OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE VEGAS PLUS CASINO, SPECIFICALLY ARTICLE 7.5</p>
<p>7.5. The minimum amount to make a withdrawal is 300 euros. Withdrawals of earnings and bonuses derived from free bonus money prior to making the initial deposit are limited to a maximum of 150 euros. Any accumulated winnings greater than 150 euros of bonuses prior to making a deposit will be eliminated when the maximum win amount is reached. In order to withdraw the winnings generated from free bonus money prior to the initial deposit, the player must make a successful deposit. Currently, up to â‚¬ 1,500 in earnings per calendar week can be withdrawn. You can make up to 4 withdrawals per month at no cost. For each additional withdrawal transaction, you will be charged a commission of 60 euros. From time to time we may change the minimum amounts mentioned above at our discretion. In the event that a customer has a pending withdrawal or a withdrawable balance, the deposit limits and / or withdrawal limits cannot be altered.</p>
<p>BASED ON THE ABOVE I SET OUT THE FACTS OF THE SITUATION.</p>
<p>REQUEST A WITHDRAWAL ON 05/06/21 IT WAS PROCESSED ON 05/09/21, LEAVING A POSITIVE BALANCE IN MY ACCOUNT OF 1,500 READY TO REQUEST A NEW WITHDRAWAL ART 7.5 OF THE TC SAYS THAT YOU CAN MAKE WITHDRAWALS PER NATURAL WEEK, WELL AS THAT WEEK HAVING TRANSACTIONED, THE SYSTEM DOES NOT LET ME MAKE THE REQUEST FOR WITHDRAWAL, WITH WHICH THEY ARE BREACHING THEIR OWN TC AS FOR WITHDRAWALS</p>
<p>FOR ALL THE COMMENTS ABOVE, the casino is requested to comply with its own terms and to request the withdrawal of 1,500 euros.</p>
