<p>The popular provider of content, powering online gambling operators across the globe, Hacksaw Gaming, announced a new collaboration with Betsson Group. The two companies initially joined forces back in 2021 and have been gradually expanding their collaboration to new markets around the world. Now, Hacksaw Gaming confirmed it agreed to provide games for Betsson, powering the betting and gaming company's operations in Spain.</p>
<p>Going live with Hacksaw Gaming's content propels Betsson's offering for Spanish customers. It represents the latest step in the duo's successful partnership. Moreover, the collaboration in Spain marks Betsson's sixth regulated market launch with Hacksaw Gaming's content.</p>
<p>Ultimately, by expanding their collaboration to Spain, the two companies aim to strengthen their presence in the region. While the new content agreement will help Hacksaw Gaming engage with new clients, it also propels Betsson's offering in the European country. Thanks to the new deal, the leading iGaming content supplier aims to solidify its position as a go-to supplier for online gambling operators in Spain.</p>
<p>Marcus Cordes, Hacksaw Gaming's CEO, shared his excitement in a statement. "It is always a pleasure collaborating with Betsson," he explained. Finally, Cordes pointed out: "We are nearing 2024 with great enthusiasm for more successful launches!"</p>
<p>Laura Sanchez, Betsson Spain's Casino Manager, spoke about the latest collaboration with Hacksaw Gaming, explaining that it is the perfect way to celebrate the company's 60th anniversary. "Exciting news â€“ we're now live with the awesome games from Hacksaw Gaming," she added. Finally, Sanchez pointed out: "Our goal is simple: give our loyal customers a bunch of new and cool games, and this partnership is making it happen!"</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Hacksaw Gaming announced a new content agreement with DraftKings. That partnership came after the fast-growing iGaming supplier obtained a license for the regulated gambling market in New Jersey. Under the terms of the collaboration, Hacksaw Gaming agreed to deliver games for DraftKings, boosting the operator's offering in the Garden State.</p>
<p>Before that, late last month, Hacksaw Gaming announced a European-facing partnership. At the time, the iGaming supplier teamed up with Betsafe Lithuania. This saw the leading gaming operator deliver new games for its growing customer base.</p>
