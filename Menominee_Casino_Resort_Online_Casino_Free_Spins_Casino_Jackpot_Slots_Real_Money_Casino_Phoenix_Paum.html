<p>White Hat Studios has continued to increase its iGaming pull in the United States, following a recent partnership between the studio and BetMGM, which has now been topped up with a new exciting link-up.</p>

The first state where the partnership is live is Michigan.</p>
<p>PokerStars, one of the world’s leading online poker websites, has been actively seeking to expand its presence in iGaming, as indicated by its most recent content efforts. This alliance covers all regulated iGaming states, to name New Jersey, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Connecticut, and the already-launched Michigan, with more to follow.</p>
<p>The arrival of White Hat Studios on the PokerStars platform gives both partners a significant increase in their iGaming reach in the United States, which is also actively expanding the industry with more states choosing to follow suit and consider the legalization of online casino gaming.</p>
<p>White Hat Studios is also bringing a series of innovative and highly distinguishable games, including Masters of Atlantis, Almighty Buffalo Megaways, Peaky Blinders, and others. The content deal also includes table games, giving PokerStars and the company’s players access to some outstanding titles.</p>
<p>White Hat Studios’ Daniel Lechner, VP of Sales and Marketing, welcomed the opportunity to see his company team up with PokerStars, a prominent name in the iGaming industry in the United States, and deliver the full content variety of the supplier’s titles.</p>
<p>"The partnership is another major milestone for White Hat Studios and having recently gone live across all regulated states will allow us to further expand our presence within each," Lechner said.</p>
<p>In the meantime, White Hat Studios’ US pivot has continued uninterrupted. The company has been able to sign several high-profile content and distribution partnerships with some of the leading operators in the country. Recently, White Hat Studios teamed up with betPARX, covering three states, including New Jersey, Michigan, and Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>White Hat Studios also delivered content to Kindred Group’s Unibet brand, with the alliance rolling out in Pennsylvania and New Jersey earlier in August. Overall, the supplier has been maintaining a steady momentum. Its games have repeatedly topped some of the most played and popular titles in the United States, giving the company a firm foothold in the region.</p>
