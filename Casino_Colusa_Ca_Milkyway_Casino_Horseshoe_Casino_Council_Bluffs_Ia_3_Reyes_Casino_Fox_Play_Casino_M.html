<p>MGM Resorts International, the leading global hospitality and entertainment company, announced Thursday a new collaboration with the Grant a Gift Autism Foundation-Ackerman Center (GGAF).</p>
<p>MGM Partners with GGAF for a New Program</p>
<p>Under the terms of the new collaboration, the company pledged $1 million toward a new vocational job placement program. The funding is expected to help the program expand in the next five years. The new program will provide training as well as employment opportunities for people with autism. The recent collaboration complements another $140,000 grant MGM Resorts pledged for the GGAF earlier this year.</p>
<p>“MGM Resorts International has partnered with Grant a Gift Autism Foundation-Ackerman Center (GGAF) on a new vocational job placement program, providing training and MGM Resorts employment opportunities to individuals with autism,“ reads a statement released by MGM Resorts International</p>
<p>Now, participants of the new program called Working on Occupational Readiness will undergo 12-week vocational readiness training. During this period, participants will learn vital vocational skills and gain access to family services as well. Upon completion of the training course, the participants will be able to apply for positions with MGM Resorts.</p>
<p>To apply for the open positions, participants in the program will need to meet specific requirements. After that, the new employees that are hired will have the option to go through additional coaching via the GGAF to “ensure a full understanding of their new role above and beyond traditional, employee on-boarding,” MGM explained.</p>
<p>The Program Will Help Adults with Autism</p>
<p>Bill Hornbuckle, MGM Resorts’ CEO, acknowledged that the company currently is the largest private employer in Nevada. As such, the company has a responsibility to boost the economic and social progress of the community, he added. In conclusion, Hornbuckle added: “Our vision for embracing humanity aligns with the incredible work of GGAF as they work to improve the lives of adults with autism in Southern Nevada.”</p>
<p>“As the largest private employer in Nevada, we have a responsibility to contribute to social and economic progress of our community, including creating pathways to employment.“ Bill Hornbuckle, CEO of MGM Resorts</p>
<p>According to national data, currently, most autistic adults are impacted by underemployment or unemployment. Additionally, most such adults face significant challenges when it comes to employment opportunities. The new program seeks to change this reality and help autistic adults by providing the needed training, support and employment opportunities.</p>
<p>The recent announcement comes after earlier this month, MGM Resorts International revealed a senior leadership hire. The company selected Gary Fritz to serve as the president of its interactive division, MGM Resorts Interactive. This appointment complemented MGM’s plans to expand further into the digital realm.</p>
