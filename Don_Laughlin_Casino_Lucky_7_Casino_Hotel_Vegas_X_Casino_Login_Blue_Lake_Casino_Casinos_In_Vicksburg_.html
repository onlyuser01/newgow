<p>On Tuesday, Caesars Sportsbook announced a new partnership with brothers Cooper, Peyton and Eli Manning and their father, Archie Manning. With the deal, the Manning family will be participating in various advertisements by Caesars and appear at live events for the operator.</p>
<p>Chris Holdren, the Digital Co-President of Caesars, shared a few words on the partnership in a statement. He said that this isn’t a typical deal between major talents and a sports betting operator. The Caesars family will welcome and integrate arguably the most acclaimed family in the history of football. He also stated that Archie, Cooper, Peyton and Eli are community champions and fantastic people, which is why Caesars is delighted to partner with such well-spoken individuals.</p>
<p>The Manning family is highly celebrated in the NFL. Peyton and Archie are members of the Pro Football Hall of Fame and Eli has been successful enough to win two Super Bowls with the New York Giants. Cooper’s career felt short due to an injury he picked up before going to college, but he managed to maintain the family’s reputation by becoming a well-known TV personality. The four Manning family members will engage with bettors via Caesars’ loyalty program known as Caesars Rewards.</p>
<p>Peyton Manning released a statement in which he commented on the latest developments. He stated that all family members are delighted to join the Caesars Sportsbook team and that the quartet is more than eager to interact with the operator’s customers who are in love with football and sports, in general. Additionally, he mentioned that Caesars has a lot of planned initiatives that have a major focus on the community impact. They appreciate the fact that Caesars support causes that are important to the Manning family.</p>
<p>Mannings Will Promote Responsible Gambling</p>
<p>One of the initiatives in which the Manning family will participate is responsible gambling campaigns in which they will highlight bettors’ available resources via Caesars Sportsbook. At the moment, Caesars Sportsbook is operating in 20 jurisdictions and states, and 14 of those jurisdictions and states offer mobile betting.</p>
<p>Moreover, Caesars has partnered with US’ major leagues – MLB, NBA, NFL and NHL – and has inked partnerships with individual teams in these leagues. Finally, Caesars Sportsbook is the odd provider for both CBS Sports and ESPN.</p>
<p>The Caesars Sportsbook app has proven to be quite a success ever since its launch and has helped the operator bag huge amounts of revenue. It also contributed a lot towards Caesars’ profits in the third quarter of 2021. As more states are looking to legalize sports betting, it is highly likely that the Caesars Sportsbook will expand and increase its influence.</p>
