<p>The American Gaming Association (AGA) continues with its newest hire drive, with the Board of Directors now selecting Michael Rumbolz, Executive Chair of the Board of Evering Holdings, as the association's Elected Chairman.</p>
<p>He is taking over the reins from another prominent industry player, Hard Rock International Chairman and Seminole Gaming CEO Jim Allen, who has been in the position since 2022. Rumbolz will step into his new post from January 2024 onwards.</p>
<p>Commenting on his appointment, Rumbolz said that he was thankful for the opportunity, and said that he will work to shape the future of the gambling industry and help push standards. There are many important topics to be addressed, Rumbolz clarified, including the evolving nature of responsible gambling, but also the proliferation of illegal gambling.</p>
<p>AGA is already working on these issues, and Rumbolz himself confirmed that he is also keen to address the matters and help find a meaningful resolution.</p>
<p>AGA President and CEO Bill Miller has welcomed the opportunity to work with Rumbolz, whom he praised for his deep industry knowledge that will ultimately prove helpful in guiding AGA policy. He also used the opportunity to thank Allen for his service:</p>
<p>"Jim’s knowledge, insight and guidance have helped the AGA advance our mission and maximize our impact on the industry. He’s been a trusted advisor to me, and I am thankful for his partnership over the last two years."</p>
<p>Passing the baton, Allen was also pleased to see his successor preparing to assume the responsible position. "I am immensely proud of our success over the last two years accelerating gaming’s recovery while defining and advancing new priorities," he added commenting on his decision to withdraw.</p>
<p>AGA has only recently appointed Joe Maloney as its new SVP of Strategic Communications as the organization is entering a new phase with the unprecedented expansion of sports gambling and online gambling. Maloney comes from the NFL franchise, Washington Commanders, where he handled Public Affairs and Strategic Communications.</p>
<p>As to Rumbolz, the man has worked in various positions and he is well-versed in gaming equipment manufacturing and distribution, casino fintech, digital gaming, gaming, and regulation, as well as hotel and casino operations.</p>
<p>He has held many prominent positions which have helped him hone his skills, including a Member and Chairman of the Nevada Gaming Control Board and Chief Deputy Attorney General of Nevada, as well as CEO at Everi.</p>
