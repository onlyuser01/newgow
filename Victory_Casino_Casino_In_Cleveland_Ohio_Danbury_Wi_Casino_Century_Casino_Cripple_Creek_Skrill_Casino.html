    <h1>Victory Casino Casino In Cleveland Ohio Danbury Wi Casino Century Casino Cripple Creek Skrill Casino</h1>

<p>The Bay State has approved the company as an official supplier of products in the newly-regulated sports gambling market. This will help Genius Sports establish its cutting-edge products and operations in yet another US state, but also help bolster the local sports betting ecosystem at the same time.</p>
<p>Everyone Stands to Benefit from Genius Sportsâ€™ Legalization</p>
<p>The company has received what it described as a temporary certification by the Massachusetts Gaming Commission (MGA), the state regulator. Moving forward, the company can operate as a licensed sports wagering vendor, with the license application for the next 12 months before a final authorization is obtained by the watchdog.</p>
<p>This process should go smoothly, as Genius Sports is virtually present in every other state in the United States that has legalized sports gambling over the past several years. In fact, Genius Sports has more than 41 licenses across the North American region, including individual states, territories, tribes, and provinces in both the United States and Canada, and beyond.</p>
<p>Genius Sports CEO Mark Locke welcomed this opportunity and thanked the MGA for awarding the license to the company. He said that Genius Sports would be able to provide authorized sportsbooks with exceptional and exclusive NFL betting products and media solutions that are going to improve the fan experience and drive bottom lines. Locke added:</p>
<p>As an ever-expanding number of U.S. states legalize sports betting, Genius Sports welcomes the opportunity to work with states like Massachusetts, on providing sports fans with official sports data-powered solutions to power their sportsbooks. Genius Sports CEO Mark Locke</p>
<p>With the state just launching sports betting on Tuesday, January 31, sportsbooks are preparing for their first legal Super Bowl event, which should see significant interest from punters. Genius Sports is not the only vendor to have been approved in the state.</p>
<p>The MGA similarly approved a number of other prominent operators and suppliers, including Sportradar, a competitor to Genius Sports and an equally important addition to the technological betting landscape.</p>
