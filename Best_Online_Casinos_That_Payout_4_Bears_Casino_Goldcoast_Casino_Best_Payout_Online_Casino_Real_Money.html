    <h1>Best Online Casinos That Payout 4 Bears Casino Goldcoast Casino Best Payout Online Casino Real Money</h1>

<p>I'm writing to explain that I used a different option because I wasn't able to reach this complaint submission form at first.</p>
<p>Prior to reaching this complaint submission form, I was presented with the option</p>
<p>"Can you log in to the casino?"</p>
<p>The correct answer was "Yes".</p>
<p>However, for some reason, I could not reach this complaint submission form when I selected "Yes", so I chose "No" and submitted this complaint submission form.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if this is a browser error,</p>
<p>But, as I can log into blizz.io,</p>
<p>I would like to explain it here beforehand.</p>
<p>Now, I'll move on to the main issue.</p>
<p>On January 26th, I deposited $5000 worth of LTC, collected a bonus, and began to play.</p>
<p>On January 31 (Japan time), I requested a withdrawal of around $10,000 worth of LTC, but my withdrawal was denied due to betting on opposite.</p>
<p>Because of a mistake in bet placement, I bet on opposite around 23:48~23:49 on January 26th. I paused the game and inquired about it, and the support email responded with</p>
<p>"Everyone makes mistakes. Please be careful in the future."</p>
<p>I continued to play after receiving this message and have not bet on the opposite since then. Of course, I have kept a history of these email correspondences.</p>
<p>When I withdrew all of my funds on January 31, an email stated that all of my plays had been declared as betting on the opposite, and my withdrawal request, including winnings, was declined.</p>
<p>After repeatedly verifying whether other betting methods were or were not in violation of the terms, I felt the withdrawal denial was unjust,</p>
<p>Despite several emails and chat inquiries,</p>
<p>"Please wait a while"</p>
<p>"We will contact you shortly"</p>
<p>continue to be the replies I receive,</p>
<p>And only after sending 3 to 4 emails do I receive a single indirect response, always along the lines of "wait a bit".</p>
<p>Considering I was following the rules, I find this to be very disappointing, hence why I am submitting this complaint.</p>
<p>If necessary, I can provide emails in Japanese,</p>
<p>As well as screenshots,</p>
<p>And text attachments,</p>
<p>So I am waiting for your contact.</p>
