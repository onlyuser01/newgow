    <h1>Uk Online Casino Salamanca Casino Free Signup Bonus No Deposit Casino Hotels Near Foxwoods Casino Ct</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I was completely denied a withdrawal at Dublinbet Casino and my account balance was reduced to my deposit amount of €25.</p>
<p>At the time of my requested withdrawal, the player account stood at €5526.</p>
<p>The following day I revisited the casino and initially saw an amount of over €3526, which then suddenly dropped to €25 after just playing a few games of live roulette at Skylounge.</p>
<p>Not because of lost bets, but because I was actually the winner by doubling my stakes in between. Support has updated me to 5.1.13. referred to the rules of the game.</p>
<p>However, there is nothing about doubling or martingale, which I didn't know at the time I read it, and then googled it afterwards. They call it doubling strategies in the Dublinbet.</p>
<p>As a player, I take the full risk, you either win or lose, at least that's what I thought until then.</p>
<p>The live bets were also accepted by the casino and not rejected, so it cannot be the case that a win is not paid out.</p>
<p>I expressly refer to the text used by the casino in the player regulations and then a text modified by the casino is sent to me, so to speak. I would have given myself an advantage over others.</p>
<p>So far I haven't been able to achieve anything, but I would like to have this clarified legally. I don't know if that has any chance of success. I still find it a rip off because the casino doesn't want to pay out anything and doesn't offer any compromise either.</p>
<p>Accordingly, I cannot recommend it and I can only advise everyone to stay away from it</p>
<p>Dublinbet Casino.</p>
