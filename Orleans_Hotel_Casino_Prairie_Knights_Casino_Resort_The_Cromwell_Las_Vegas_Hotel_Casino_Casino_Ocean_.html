<p>Wild Wild Bananas review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Wild Wild Bananas transports players to a tropical island inhabited by adorable animals.</p>
<p>As players explore a lush jungle and a white sand beach, they’ll meet monkeys, toucans, and cheerful snakes. With the help of these new friends, they might just discover this island's secret gems.</p>
<p>Fans of jewel-themes, and those looking for a holiday atmosphere, will especially appreciate Wild Wild Bananas.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The soundtrack blends rhythmic drums and an ethereal melody to create a relaxing beachy atmosphere. The gentle chatter of birds and other animals helps to establish the natural setting. Upon wins, the pace of the music increases, and chimes add further excitement.</p>
<p>The reels are crafted from bamboo and filled with precious stones cut into the shape of each card suit. Sapphire spades, ruby hearts, emerald clubs, and amethyst diamonds all sparkle in the bright sunshine. Vivid pink hibiscus flowers also appear among the symbols, reminding players of the tropical location.</p>
<p>The stars of the reels are the cartoon animal characters, each one coming to life upon wins. The monkey character holds a fruit cocktail mischievously, while the snake and toucan smile warmly at the player.</p>
<p>In the background, an idyllic beach can be seen, with palm trees swaying in the wind and waves lapping at the shore. Sharp-eyed players will notice a small yellow lizard who occasionally snacks on insects.</p>
<p>The soundtrack and animation combine to create a lighthearted island vibe.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Wild Wild Bananas has a 3-3-4-4-4 reel structure.</p>
<p>Wins are awarded for landing matching symbols in adjacent reels, starting from the leftmost reel. This is sometimes referred to as an Any Way Wins system.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbols appear on reels 1 and 2, substituting for all symbols except the Bonus symbol and the Money symbol.</p>
<p>The Money symbol appears on reels 3, 4, and 5. During each spin, every Money symbol takes on a randomly selected value from a predetermined set.</p>
<p>If Wild symbols land alongside Money symbols on reels 1 and 2, forming a win line, the Money Collect Feature is triggered. This prompts all Money symbol values to be collected.</p>
<p>Direct Money symbol prizes range from 1x to 25x the player’s total bet. Jackpot values range from Mini (50x the player’s bet), through Major (100x the player’s bet), to Mega (500x the player’s bet).</p>
<p>The Free Spins feature is triggered when players land Wild symbols on reels 1 and 2 along with a Bonus symbol on reel 3. The feature begins with 10 free spins.</p>
<p>The Money Collect feature is active throughout the Free Spins feature and more Wilds and Money symbols will land on average.</p>
<p>The Golden Money symbol appears on reels 3, 4, and 5 only during the Free Spins feature. If a Golden Money symbol appears on the reels, the number of possible symbols on that reel increases by +1. This increase lasts for the entire Free Spins feature, allowing a maximum of 8 symbols per reel.</p>
<p>If a Golden Money symbol appears on a reel after it has increased to the maximum 8 symbols, players are awarded a random number of free spins. The number of free spins awarded will be between 5 and 10. Each reel can only provide one retrigger, after which no more Golden Money symbols will appear on that reel.</p>
<p>The maximum win for Wild Wild Bananas is 12,000x the player’s total bet. This applies to both the Free Spins feature and the base game.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 95.10%, decisively below our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.25 up to a maximum of $/£/€100 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of Wild Wild Bananas is high, which would have made it a good fit for our preferred slot machine strategies if it offered a higher RTP. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We do not recommend this low RTP, high volatility tropical island-themed slot.</p>
<p>Despite its enticing bonus features and ample volatility, Wild Wild Bananas has an RTP that is simply too low to merit a recommendation.</p>
<p>Some players may wish to drop by to meet the cartoon animals, but they would be wise to move on to slots with a more promising RTP.</p>
