<p>Serena Williams, Andy Murray Withdraw From Australian Open</p>

<p>The Australian Open is looking less like a Grand Slam event after losing tennis stars Serena Williams and Andy Murray this week. Murray told tournament organizers on Wednesday he couldn’t play because of a lingering injury.</p>

<p>“Sadly I won’t be playing in Melbourne this year, as I am not yet ready to compete,” Murray said in a statement. “I’ll be flying home shortly to assess all the options but I appreciate all the messages of support and I hope to be back playing soon.”</p>
<p>Williams followed a day later, withdrawing from the prestigious event, saying she wasn’t tournament ready and was still getting her game together after giving birth to her daughter Olympia in September.</p>
<p>“After competing in Abu Dhabi I realized that although I am super close, I’m not where I personally want to be,” Williams said in a statement. “My coach and team always said, ‘Only go to tournaments when you are prepared to go all the way.’ I can compete – but I don’t want to just compete, I want to do far better than that and to do so, I will need a little more time,” she said in a statement.</p>
<p>Other Factors Influencing Odds</p>
<p>Williams was the defending champion after defeating her sister Venus last year while she was two months pregnant. She was a 40-1 pick to repeat this year, far behind favorites Karolina Pliskova and Garbine Muguruza, who are at 6-1. Maria Sharapova and Simona Halep are next at 15-2.</p>
<p>Venus Williams is listed at 22-1 and is coming off a trying year for the 37 year old. She attained her highest ranking (No. 5) since 2010 but failed to win a title. She was also embroiled in a controversy involving an automobile accident when her car was hit by another vehicle.</p>
<p>The passenger in that car ultimately died of his injuries. Williams was cleared in December of any wrongdoing in the accident but a wrongful death lawsuit filed by the family is ongoing.</p>
<p>Murray wasn’t expected to play because of a lingering hip injury and wasn’t on the betting board. Last year he was one of the favorites to win at plus-150, but was upset by Germany’s Mischa Zverev in the fourth round. He has three grand slam titles but has never won the Australian.</p>
<p>With Murray out Roger Federer is the 15-8 favorite, with Rafael Nadal at 4-1 and Novak Djokovic at 5-1.</p>
<p>When They Might Return</p>
<p>It appears Serena Williams will be on a tennis court sooner than Murray. It is expected she will play next month and prepare for the next Grand Slam event, which is the French Open in May.</p>
<p>Murray’s season appears to be finished, to the disappointment of his fans. He is pondering hip surgery and returned to the UK to assess his options. He has not played in a competitive event since July.</p>
<p>“Surgery is also an option but the chances of a successful outcome are not as high as I would like which has made this my secondary option and my hope has been to avoid that,” he said in a statement. “However this is something I may have to consider but let’s hope not.”</p>
