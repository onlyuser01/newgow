<p>The Arizona Cardinals vs. Houston Texans Week 11 game is on the program on Sunday, November 19, 2023, at NRG Stadium in Houston</p>
<p>Kyler Murray is finally back! The Arizona Cardinals’ quarterback made his comeback after a months-long hiatus last weekend, leading his team to only their second win of the 2023 NFL season. The chance of the Cards is almost nonexistent, but we could see them make the playoffs via Wild Card if they continue winning.</p>
<p>So, can they continue winning in Week 11 when they travel to the Lone Star State to take on the in-form Houston Texans? These guys are doing very well in the 2023 NFL, even though not many people had faith in them at the start of the season. The Texans are 5-6 right now and are determined to challenge for the No. 1 spot in the AFC South.</p>

<p>Arizona Cardinals Going for a Third Win of 2023</p>
<p>The Arizona Cardinals are 2-8 on the season with an average of 26.3 points conceded per game, which makes their defense the fifth worst in the league.</p>
<p>Their offense is the eighth worst in the NFL with 17.6 points scored per game, but that number is likely to go up if Kyler Murray stays fit.</p>
<p>The quarterback made his comeback last weekend in the game against the Atlanta Falcons. We saw him for 19-fr-32 for 249 yards. He made no touchdown passes but he did get one rushing TD.</p>

<p>Further, his throws did help his team get closer to the end zone, thus making it easy for Matt Prater to score four field goals that day. It wasn’t easy every time, though. Two of his field goals happened from 50+ yards distance.</p>
<p>This actually isn’t too much of a surprise given that the 39-year-old legend is the record holder for most 50+ yard field goals in the history of the NFL.</p>
<p>Houston Texans Dreaming of Postseason</p>
<p>The Houston Texans are 5-4 in the 2023 NFL, which puts them in the No. 2 position in the AFC South, just behind the Jacksonville Jaguars who are 6-3.</p>
<p>This season, they’ve been brilliant against big teams, as evident from the fact that they won against such heavyweights as the Cincinnati Bengals, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and even the Jacksonville Jaguars.</p>
<p>The reason why they don’t have an even better record is that they lost to some real underdogs in 2023. Their most recent loss, for example, happened against the Carolina Panthers. Before that, they lost to the Atlanta Falcons. Their other two losses were against the Indianapolis Colts and the Baltimore Ravens.</p>
<p>What’s interesting, however, is that only one of those four losses happened in Houston. In fact, on their turf, the Texans are 3-1 this season, and their next three games are played at home.</p>
<p>With the help of their fans at NRG Stadium, they might be able to win at least a couple of those, which would practically open the door to the playoffs for them.</p>
<p>Arizona Cardinals vs. Houston Texans Prediction</p>
<p>The prospect of making the playoffs for the first time since 2019 is what’s giving the Houston Texans motivation to give their best. Plus, the Week 11 game against the Cardinals is played on their turf, where they’ll have their fans to cheer them on. Sure, beating the Murray-led Arizona won’t be easy, but we think these guys can pull it off.</p>
<p>Picks: Houston Texans to win &amp; over to hit</p>
