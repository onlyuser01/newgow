<p>Inspired Entertainment, a gaming provider with thousands of machines across shops and pubs, will expand its reach to Pennsylvania after successfully acquiring a gaming manufacturer’s license from the state’s regulator.</p>
<p>Inspired to Launch in Pennsylvania</p>
<p>After its successful licensing in the state, Inspired Entertainment will expand its footprint in the United States. Thanks to the approval to launch in Pennsylvania, the provider will be authorized to provide games and machines to all operators licensed by the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board.</p>
<p>Inspired Entertainment hopes to launch its offerings in the Keystone State sometime this summer. As per its plans, it will roll out a myriad of games to the Pennsylvanian punters.</p>
<p>This move continues Inspired Entertainment’s strategy to expand in the key North American markets. According to analysts, the gambling industry in the United States may experience a second record year, which makes it a perfect time for Inspired to reach new US markets. As of the time of this writing, Inspired Entertainment operates in Connecticut, Michigan and New Jersey. The company also holds licenses in the Ontario and Quebec provinces of Canada.</p>
<p>The Company Continues to Grow</p>
<p>Inspired Entertainment’s president and chief operating officer, Brooks Pierce, spoke about the importance of the Pennsylvania launch. He pointed out that the state has one of the largest and most profitable iGaming markets. Because of this, entering Pennsylvania is a monumental step for the company.</p>
<p>Pierce noted that many of the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board’s licensees are already partners of Inspired in other markets. He believes that this will allow his Inspired Entertainment to quickly find its way around in the Pennsylvanian market.</p>
<p>With the growing popularity of our content, increased brand awareness and rapid speed to market, we are confident we are well-positioned to capitalize on this opportunity. Brooks Pierce, president and COO, Inspired Entertainment</p>
<p>In early May, Inspired posted its financial results for the first three months of the fiscal year. They showed that the company’s revenue has skyrocketed by about 166% compared to the same period in 2021. Inspired has quickly recovered from the pandemic period and is ready to continue growing.</p>
<p>The strong start of the year, largely driven by Inspired Entertainment’s gaming and leisure verticals, puts Inspired in a good position. Lorne Weil, the company’s executive chairman previously commented that he believes Inspired is ready to grow. He is looking forward to scaling the profitability of the company’s business.</p>
