    <h1>3 Reyes Casino Kansas City Casino Hotels Casino Richmond Va Graton Resort And Casino Casinos In Tuls</h1>

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>I had a ''Father's day bonus'' @ CashiMashi they emailed me about it.</p>
<p>I had my last 40 euros on my gambling account, and I thought I'd give it a shot! (lost 500 euros just before)</p>
<p>Anyways, I played mostly Scarab queen from Pragmatic play , Dog house, and El paso Xnudge. When I had around 70-80 euros left I played El paso Xnudge, 0.5 euro bet and I hit 3 scatters and that last thing, where you get a ''better bonus'' I Believe, first time I play it.</p>
<p>After wagering, with 2 euro bets on Scarab queen for around 20 minutes, I'm left with 800 euro'ish after wagering. I decide to cash-out. 05-12-2021. 2 days later (30 minutes ago) I get a mail:</p>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Please note that your withdrawal request has been declined, as the maximum bet allowed while a bonus is active is €5, so your balance has been adjusted accordingly.</p>
<p>Feel free to make a new withdrawal request</p>
<p>If you have any other questions, concerns, or comments, please do not hesitate to contact our customer service team.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>CashiMashi Cashier</p>
<p>payments@hd.cashimashi.com</p>
<p>www.cashimashi.com</p>
<p>They took away 760 euro's and left me with my initial deposit of 40€.</p>
<p>I'm well aware of bonus terms and which games you may play, how much you can bet at max etc. (I've been in this business for around 10 years now) My max bet during the bonus period was 2 euros.</p>
<p>They are taking me for a fool, I know that they would LOVE if I'd bet over 5 euros and take the money straight outta my pocket.</p>
<p>But that's not the case.</p>
