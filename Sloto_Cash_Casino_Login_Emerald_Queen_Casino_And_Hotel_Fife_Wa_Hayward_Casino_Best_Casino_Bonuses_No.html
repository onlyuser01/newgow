    <h1>Sloto Cash Casino Login Emerald Queen Casino And Hotel Fife Wa Hayward Casino Best Casino Bonuses No</h1>

<p>Whenever they canceled the withdrawal request, the casino made no contact with me saying even why or what was needed, it was always me that when seeing that the value was already back in my account I went to chat, chat that does not help at all, the only information they give is to send a document, or make a deposit, then again documents, and now finally indicate that I can't raise the whole amount. Honestly it is a very horrible service, as in my view when it is canceled they would check everything that would be needed in order to inform the customer and help in the quick resolution, but quick is a word that the extra vegas casino does not know, let alone help.</p>
<p>The values, I on the day 3/12 (approximately) when I made the load I won the first 200 € with real money and mine, as for the bonus situation, almost every day the casino sent an offer of 25 free spins. by e-mail offer that one of the times I left 100 € after playing enough money to be cash balance and not as a bonus, I made the withdrawal request separately and both were refused with information given in the chat that documents were missing.</p>
<p>However on the 17th, approximate date, with the free spins once again, after much movement of the bonus money left me 1100 € as the casino had previously canceled the order for my ecopayz, I preferred to cancel the order and return to submit by bank transfer, because on other sites had already done and as I knew the procedures went very fast (on other sites).</p>
<p>On December 26th as already mentioned this order is once again canceled, for the reason of loading I assumed the responsibilities and I made the loading, on 02/01/2020 once again I see my withdrawal request refused, they realized that it was missing The sending of 2 more cards were generated at the beginning when I made the first 2 uploads, to point out that no profits were generated from them, but once again I sent, wondered if I would now have my money and the only information I received was to wait for the 3-5 working days, and they always go up to the limit of 5 days.</p>
<p>I resubmitted the order and on 9/01/2020 once again cancel the order, when questioning the reason, there is a limit of withdrawal values generated by free spins, in my case that the account is basic level, 100 €, I would like to know why, until that moment, you have not mentioned any situation, but the work is not responsible nor try to help.</p>
<p>Yesterday I submitted the withdrawal request and I put all the separate values, € 220 which refers to my non-bonus profits, € 200 of earnings + € 20 of the day load 27/12, + € 100 for the first winnings with free spins and 100 € of the last, but as the value is in cash balance and I'm sure it belongs to me because if I make a load accumulates the value in the same place, then unable to identify if it is one or the other, then I ordered the remaining 1000 € in orders of 100 € each since the limit is 100 € I am once again waiting for you to accept or decline the payment to see what is the excuse this time</p>
<p>I can even quote the information available in the bonus rules:</p>
<p>'' 2.1.4. The money won from Free Spins will be credited to your bonus amount balance and is subject to our standard terms and conditions, bonus terms and wagering requirements. However, winnings after wager requirements are completed are real money and are available for withdrawal.</p>
<p>2.1.4.1. Please note, if you complete the wager requirement, but have yet to make a deposit, your bonus will be credited in the form of € 25 cash.</p>
<p>2.1.9. Free bonus withdrawal limits</p>
