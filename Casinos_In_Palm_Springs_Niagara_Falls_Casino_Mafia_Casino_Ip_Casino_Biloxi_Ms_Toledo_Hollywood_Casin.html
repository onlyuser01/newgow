<p>Pragmatic Play is back with a new blood-curdling and action-packed highly thematic slot game that features werewolves, bats, snakes, and all sorts of miscellaneous creatures of the night, Casino Guru News learned as part of a press release. The company has introduced Blade &amp; Fangs, its first release for the new year, celebrating the company’s commitment to delivering fresh products round-the-clock.</p>
<p>This new game is a touch different than what we are accustomed to seeing from Pragmatic Play, which has usually been building vivid and more colorful titles, whether this is Gates of Olympus, The Dog House, or even the more somber Wolf Gold.</p>
<p>The newly chosen theme only adds to the fun as players will play Blade &amp; Fangs across a 5x3 grid and have 243 paylines to explore and try to turn into winners. There are two special symbols as well, noted as +1x and 2x, which will transform the base game and expand the reels to a 6x5 grid with a 2x multiplier.</p>
<p>Irina Cornides, Chief Operating Officer at Pragmatic Play has welcomed the new title and the opportunities it brought in:</p>
<p>"Pragmatic Play is set to raise a few hairs with Blade &amp; Fangs, which includes two separate 5x3 game grids that can combine to award multiplier wins up to 5,000x! Our first Slot release of 2024 pairs novel mechanics with a thrilling theme and epic win potential."</p>
<p>Although the exact mechanic may take some figuring out at first blush, the new expanding reels are integrated seamlessly and intuitively into the core gameplay making for a fun, rewarding and tight experience across the board.</p>
<p>Plus, there is a free spins level that is activated by using a fiery scatter symbol. You have an increasing multiplier during the free spins level as well, adding to the fun you can get out of this fresh release.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Blade &amp; Fangs promises to be rewarding as well, as the maximum multiplier wins up to 5,000x of a player’s stake, which is celebrated as a major milestone by Pragmatic Play.</p>
<p>The company had a very strong year in 2023, and it’s planning to continue delivering on the same level of success. In December, the supplier introduced Gates of Olympus 1000, a revamped version of its original franchise and classic.</p>
