<p>Koron LeKeith Lowe, 24, required treatment at a local hospital. Once discharged, cops said they will book Lowe at Riverside County Jail. He is charged with murder, attempted murder, resisting arrest with violence, and fighting a police dog, local police said in an online statement. He is expected to soon appear in local court.</p>
<p>The casino did not play a role in the incident, based on initial evidence. The shooting took place at a Hemet, Calif. residence on Tuesday. Lowe allegedly fired several bullets from a firearm. Asasha Lache Hall, 30, died from her wounds, the Riverside County Coroner’s Office said.</p>
<p>The confrontation began as a domestic disturbance, with the would-be shooter, who police said lived in the house, arguing with the other residents early Tuesday morning, authorities said.</p>
<p>Five adults and two children lived in the residence, police said. Two additional adults were visiting the residence when the shooting took place. Officers evacuated residents from neighboring houses until they were sure the crime scene was safe.</p>
<p>Body Discovered</p>
<p>A SWAT team searched and secured the house as Hall’s lifeless body was discovered. The shooter, later identified as Lowe, had fled the area. A handgun was located at the scene, police added.</p>
<p>Among the residents was a woman who had alerted police by phone about the shooting. She was hiding in the house with a five-year-old and six-year-old. They were not harmed. It was unclear if she was their mother. Two other adults were able to safely flee the house via a garage door after the shooting commenced, police said.</p>
<p>Police were later able to identify Lowe as a person of interest in the shooting. By mid-day Wednesday, he was found hiding in a parked car in Cabazon, police said. Officers initially attempted to negotiate with Lowe, but he refused to surrender.</p>
<p>Lowe Allegedly Injures Dog</p>
<p>Eventually, police used a Hemet police dog named “Bosco” to force Lowe out of the car. In response, Lowe “violently” struck the dog with a sharp piece of wood, police stated. Bosco suffered injuries and was transported to a local emergency veterinary clinic, police said.</p>
<p>The dog’s injuries were not life-threatening and he could return to duty soon.</p>
<p>Bosco, who works with his handler, Hemet Police Officer [Dylan] Detwiler, has been a valued member of the Hemet Police Department for 4 months and is expected to be back on the job after a weekend of rest &amp; recovery,” Hemet police said in an online Facebook post.</p>
<p>Several residents praised the officers and Bosco for their efforts in apprehending the suspect. One Facebook poster, identified as Annie Olszewski English, stated: “Glad you got Lowe. Bravo for Bosco, but it’s awful he was injured. Speedy recovery!”</p>
<p>Morongo Casino is located about 17 miles northwest of Palm Springs, Calif. It is one of the largest tribal gaming venues in Southern California. It is operated by the Morongo Band of Mission Indians.</p>
