    <h1>Mobile Casino Coushatta Casino Louisiana Casino By Me Tulsa Ok Casino Elko Casinos Casino Midas Play</h1>

<p>Good morning,</p>
<p>I am contacting you to jointly analyze a situation that does not seem ethical to me, I will try to be as concise as possible.</p>
<p>This complaint is addressed to CasinoMidas,</p>
<p>Where I registered a long time ago, and throughout this time I have been earning a lot of money.</p>
<p>I spent a long time without consuming bets, to which I finally relapsed due to all the advertising they send and it is impossible to eliminate it (extortion)</p>
<p>After having played a lot, and having had victories (never cashed) and many losses, there was a day where I got a good prize, I couldn't collect it because I didn't have a verified account, here comes my first doubt, in other casinos because I wasn't verified, you cannot enter more than 250e (I think I remember) on this page there have been months that I have entered more than 2 thousand e.</p>
<p>After my frustration of having lost the entire prize (6 thousand â‚¬) approx.</p>
<p>I continued depositing, until a moment came when I saw that it got out of hand, and after 2 or 3 attempts to block the account, it has been impossible for me, since they do not provide any facility for closing, the only thing they do It is giving you more bonuses and procrastinating about the closing, to which in the end, after having lost so much money, you give in thinking that you could recover part of it.</p>
<p>Also include, that after having played so much, I have seen repetitive patterns in the game, that you always win when they are bonuses, thus inviting you to end up making more deposits, which later when you do, the game pattern changes and does not reward.</p>
<p>I would like to be advised, and see if some type of action can be taken.</p>
