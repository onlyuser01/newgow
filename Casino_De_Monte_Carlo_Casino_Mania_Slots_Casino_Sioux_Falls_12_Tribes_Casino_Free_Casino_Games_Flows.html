<p>Norwegian iGaming portal Kongebonus partnered with technology provider Flows. Integrating the new technology will help Kongebonus accelerate its development pipeline and boost audience interaction</p>
<p>Flows, the tech platform, and iGaming software innovation company, continues to make waves in the European gaming market. The developer’s “no-coding” solutions impressed Kongebonus, the leading Norwegian gambling portal. Their cooperation will enhance Kongebonus’s features with an intuitive and easy-to-use toolset while Flows solidifies its position as a leading technology provider.</p>
<p>Kongebonus Gains Access to a Cutting-Edge Solution</p>
<p>Kongebonus’s needs perfectly match Flows’ intuitive and easily implemented development acceleration features. The website is Norway’s biggest iGaming social hub, featuring operator reviews, industry news, promotions, articles, and instructional videos. Kongebonus relies substantially on its social media presence, featuring Twitch live streams, a dedicated Discord server, and regular, feature-rich updates.</p>
<p>Kongebonus’ director lauded the new partnership, adding that Flows integration would give their team an innovative and optimized solution for boosting audience interaction. Pleasantly surprised at the new solution’s simplicity and ease of use, he was confident that the platform would benefit from their planned new features even earlier than expected.</p>
<p>“We’ve been able to double down on our product and feature roadmap for 2023 thanks to Flows.” Kongebonus director</p>
<p>Implementing a no-coding solution like Flows should allow Kongebonus the room to accelerate its developments and fast-track its integrations all through a single interface. It makes integrating and customizing third-party content like Twitter and Telegram significantly faster, allowing developers to focus more on the actual content and not on its implementation.</p>
<p>Flows Marches On With European Expansion</p>
<p>The new partnership serves as another significant milestone for Flows as it cements its presence in the highly-competitive Nordic markets. The developer recently made several high-profile partnerships, primarily focusing on the Italian market thanks to deals with slot producer Nazionale Elettronica, iGaming content creator, and distributor Microgame and Octavian Lab, an Italian gaming and betting platform provider.</p>
<p>Cooperating with Kongebonus proves that the developer’s offerings and mindset can accelerate delivery in various companies across different markets. Flows CEO James King was excited to partner with the Norwegian platform’s passionate development team. He was confident that their tools would help Kongebonus improve and accelerate its delivery pipeline.</p>
<p>“We’re really excited to have partnered with Kongebonus… as they continue to solidify their place as one of the brightest lights in the affiliate space.” James King, Flows CEO</p>
<p>With 2022 officially over, the deal puts a cap on an impressively successful year for Flows. The company has quickly risen from relative obscurity, relying on its state-of-the-art technology and passionate development team. Having established itself as a leading European innovation platform, Flows will likely continue to make headlines well into 2023.</p>
