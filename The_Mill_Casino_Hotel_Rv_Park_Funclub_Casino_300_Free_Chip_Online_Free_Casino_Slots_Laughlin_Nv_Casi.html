<p>The fast-growing developer of games for the online gambling industry, Gaming Corps, unveiled details regarding a new collaboration that will help extend the reach of its popular content. On Thursday, the company revealed it joined forces with QTech Games, a leading distributor of digital entertainment for new and emerging markets, offering some of the best online casino games from top iGaming developers.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the recent deal, Gaming Corps agreed to supply its complete range of games, powering QTech Games' online casino platform. This partnership enables the up-and-coming Swedish games developer to reach new partners and audiences thanks to QTech Games' innovative online gambling platform.</p>
<p>As a result, QTech Games' clients will be able to access Gaming Corps' certified Plinko product, as well as games from the provider's Mine, Crash, Table and Slot verticals, providing supreme entertainment. The portfolio of games includes Jet Lucky 2, Raging Zeus, Penalty Champion, as well as Coin Miner 2, among other popular titles from the Swedish iGaming developer.</p>
<p>Daniel Long, QTech Games' CCO, shared his excitement about the latest collaboration in a statement. "We are delighted to add Gaming Corps' thrilling games content to our online casino platform, and I'm sure this will prove to be very popular with our partners," he said. Finally, Long pointed out: "This will help us continue to strengthen our platform, and we are once again adding content which will raise the bar, which makes us very excited to begin this partnership."</p>
<p>Mats Lundin, Gaming Corps' Director of Sales, shared similar excitement about the new collaboration with QTech Games. He explained: "QTech Games is among the leading games distributors, with a strong footing across several regions, offering a wide, localized portfolio for each region." Finally, Lundin pointed out: "This partnership will allow us to grow our presence even further as we continue to provide first-class casino and video games content, and I look forward to utilizing QTech Games' platform, which will bring our games to more players."</p>
<p>The deal with QTech Games comes on the heels of another important collaboration announced by Gaming Corps only recently. Last month, the company confirmed it joined forces with The Mill Adventure (TMA), a popular iGaming platform that delivers solutions and content for operators and brands within the online gambling vertical around the globe.</p>
<p>That deal helped further expand the reach of Gaming Corps' engaging and innovative products to new customers around the globe. Similarly to the deal with QTech Games, the iGaming developer agreed to supply TMA with products from its different verticals.</p>
