    <h1>Eldorado Hotel Casino Reno Actors Casino Royale Golden Gate Hotel Casino Casinos Gambling Online Swe</h1>

<p>end of August I have been trying to withdrawal and have been getting the run around. I sent in all my info and profile was verified so I assumed I was okay to withdrawal as I did with other online casinos. Then I get a denial email with no explanation so I get online and chat with them. The agent I chatted with told me they needed to verify my Bitcoin account so I sent them all the info I could since I purchased bitcoin through cash app I sent them my statement showing the amount I purchased and amount with them. They told me that didn’t work and I needed to send them a screen shot of my wallet. So I also did that. Then they kept emailing me (as they told me) but I never received any emails from them other than the first denial email. Checked all folders and nothing. Got on chat again and they said they needed a screen shot of the address so I did that. But with cashapp apparently the address changes everytime per security reasons. And I explained that to uptown but they didn’t understand that. After over month of the same thing going back and forth with the screen shot, I get a call from security last weekend. They explained that my banked disputed a few transactions and that’s why I got blocked out of my account and cousins withdrawal. Almost two months and I knew it was fishy because they already blocked me from logging in the a few days after my withdrawal request. So obviously that wasn’t the real issue which I don’t even know what the real issue was in the first place. So then I talk to my bank and they have the money back to the casino because I saw the payments were retaken out of my account. So as per the call from last week the security team told me to email them the email from my bank and show the payments were reversed but when I tried to do that yesterday 10-7-23 I was blocked from emailing them. I then got on chat for the 100th million time and then they said that I was banned. I was like that doesn’t make sense because I been dealing with this withdrawal for almost two months now and you guys requested this info from me when I could and when I did you guys block me from sending it to you guys. Then the agent asked when the security team can call me and I said today 10/8 as their earliest. He told me it has to be Monday and I was like your security team called me on a weekend last week why can’t they call me again same time and day? And he wouldn’t answer that so I said for them to reach out Monday. I already know they’re gonna request me to email them and I can’t so obviously they’re not gonna get what they want. Just like how they keep telling me they’re sending me emails but I’m not getting any emails. I just wanna get my money and never play on their site again. And because of this they have locked mw out of other online casinos because when I log in the other agents say I have an issue with another casino that’s why I can’t log in… please help me get my money. Lol im done with this casino and sorry for the very long post. Just wanted to be detailed so it makes sense.</p>
