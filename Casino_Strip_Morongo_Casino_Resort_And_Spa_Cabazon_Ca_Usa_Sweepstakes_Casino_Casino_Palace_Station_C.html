<p>The company said that the favorable numbers “confirm the renewed dynamism” of the its activities following the end of the pandemic.</p>
<p>Groupe Partouche, a leading European operator, has published its financial results for the second quarter of the fiscal year (February 2023 – April 2023). In addition, the company highlighted its consolidated turnover for the first half of the year (November 2022 – April 2023).</p>
<p>The group noted that during the second half of the previous year (February 2022 – April 2022), its casinos still struggled with the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. The properties were affected by the “vaccination pass,” which limited the flow of customers.</p>
<p>The pass was eventually repealed on March 14, 2022 in France, and on February 17, 2022, in Switzerland.</p>
<p>The Group Recorded Increases Across the Board</p>
<p>Groupe Partouche shared its financial results, noting that its Q2 gross gaming revenue (GGR) increased by 14.1% year on year to $183 million (converted to USD). For reference, the group’s Q2 2022 results saw it earn around $160 million.</p>
<p>France continued to constitute Groupe Partouche’s primary market. The company reported $164 million from the French market, which represents a 13.7% year-on-year increase. This figure was attributed to the recorded 18% increase in attendance.</p>
<p>The group was very happy with its slots vertical, which posted a “very satisfactory” increase of 10% to $131 million. Electronic forms of traditional games were also a very popular vertical, which marked a stellar 26.8% GGR increase to almost $20 million.</p>
<p>Outside of France, Groupe Partouche recorded a GGR rise of 18.1% to over $18 million. iGaming continues to be a very profitable vertical in Switzerland, where it recorded a whopping 24.3% year-on-year increase.</p>
<p>The Company’s Business Is Recovering</p>
<p>Groupe Partouche continued that its net gaming revenue after levies increased by 11.9%, sitting at more than $85 million at the end of the quarter. Businesses excluding gaming recorded a total turnover of $22.6 million, the company reported. The global turnover of the second quarter surpassed $107 million, Groupe Partouche added.</p>
<p>The group reported that turnover for the first half of 2023 increased by 15.2% to $233 million. NGR for that same period increased by 14.8% to $190 million, Groupe Partouche reported.</p>
<p>The company concluded that the favorable numbers “confirm the renewed dynamism” of the company’s activities following the end of the pandemic.</p>
<p>Groupe Partouche concluded that it will report its Q1 income on June 27 following the closure of the stock market. Then, on September 12, after the stock market closure, the operator will disclose its financial information for the third quarter of the year.</p>
