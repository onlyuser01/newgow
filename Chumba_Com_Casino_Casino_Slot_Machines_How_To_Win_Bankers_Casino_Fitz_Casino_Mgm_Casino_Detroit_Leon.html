    <h1>Chumba Com Casino Casino Slot Machines How To Win Bankers Casino Fitz Casino Mgm Casino Detroit Leon</h1>

<p>Hello CasinoGuru!</p>
<p>I really hope that you can help me here!</p>
<p>I became aware of Leonbets through the "very good rating" here.</p>
<p>I deposited around € 1700 at Leonbets.</p>
<p>I played something with it and won something, of which I paid out € 1250 and used the rest of the winnings to complete sports betting.</p>
<p>For the payout, I had to verify my account, which worked within a few hours (I sent 5 pictures in total).</p>
<p>I won about € 19,000 from sports betting over the same weekend.</p>
<p>I requested a withdrawal of € 15,000.</p>
<p>After that, however, I could no longer request a payout because suddenly (2 days after I was told that my account is verified !!!!!) I have to send another picture for verification.</p>
<p>I did this.</p>
<p>In the email I received it said that the additional verification would take an average of 3 days, but in exceptional cases it could take 30 days.</p>
<p>The question arises why the first verification worked within hours and why there was no such information in the first email.</p>
<p>The notice with the 30 days only happened after I requested a payment of € 15,000, which in itself is very dubious.</p>
<p>Why does a single image suddenly take 30 days to verify?</p>
<p>But so far so good.</p>
<p>After waiting 3-4 days, I still had no information that my account was verified and I also had to find out that I can no longer request withdrawals and my withdrawals that have already been made have been completely canceled!</p>
<p>That you have to wait accordingly is okay, but not that you cannot request a single payout over such a long period and all payouts that have already been requested are simply canceled.</p>
<p>All taking into account that my account has already been verified, but 2 days later this was suddenly no longer sufficient!</p>
<p>I think this casino is really great and would like to continue playing there. But playing in the casino is only fun if you are treated properly with regard to payouts.</p>
<p>In total, I still have € 13,000 available and I won't move it any more.</p>
<p>There is still a sports betting pending ..</p>
<p>I hope that CasinoGuru can mediate here, especially because this casino is really good and should like to keep the good rating.</p>
<p>I am happy to withdraw my complaint ...</p>
<p>Kind regards, Simon</p>
