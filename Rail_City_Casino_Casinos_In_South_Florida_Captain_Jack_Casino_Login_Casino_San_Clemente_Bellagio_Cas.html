<p>The move comes following a successful launch of Bragg Gaming Group’s innovative content and Remote Game Server (RGS) technology on the bet365 platform</p>
<p>Bragg Gaming Group, a prominent player in the iGaming industry, has announced its latest move to extend its content outreach within Ontario through a strategic partnership with global operator bet365. This development not only reinforces Bragg’s foothold in the North American iGaming landscape but also highlights its commitment to expanding its reach.</p>
<p>Bet365 Players in Ontario Can Now Enjoy Exclusive Bragg Gaming Proprietary Titles</p>
<p>Under this collaboration, players on the bet365 platform in Ontario will now have access to a range of captivating gaming content. Bragg’s proprietary titles from Bragg Studios, including popular releases like Fairy Dust from Atomic Slot Lab and Sea of Plenty from Indigo Magic, are now seamlessly integrated into the bet365 gaming portfolio.</p>
<p>Additionally, the inclusion of exclusive premium titles from Bragg’s Powered by Bragg portfolio, such as the enthralling Devils Lock from Blueberi, is set to further enrich the gaming experience for bet365’s Ontario-based customers. All this engaging content will be seamlessly delivered via Bragg’s advanced RGS technology.</p>
<p>Lara Falzon, president and chief operating officer at Bragg Gaming Group, expressed her enthusiasm about the partnership, stating: “We’re delighted to work with bet365, one of the leading operators in Ontario, to bring our player-engaging content to their customers in the Province. With Ontario pacing as one of the largest iGaming markets in North America, our partnership with bet365 will play an important role in our North American growth strategy and help drive consistent, long-term growth.”</p>
<p>A spokesperson from bet365 also shared their thoughts on the partnership, stating that they had long recognized the caliber of content that Bragg Gaming Group consistently produces. The spokesperson also noted that the collaboration enhanced bet365’s diverse gaming content offering in one of their most dynamic markets. They further mentioned that Ontario-based players could now relish an extended selection of top-tier titles thanks to the collaboration.</p>
<p>Ontario’s Thriving iGaming Market Spurs Bragg Gaming’s Strategic Partnership</p>
<p>This development aligns with Bragg Gaming’s overarching strategy to tap into the burgeoning iGaming market in Ontario, which has shown remarkable growth potential over a short period. Ontario’s position as a leading iGaming jurisdiction in North America further underscores the significance of this partnership.</p>
<p>Ontario is not the only market where Bragg Gaming has been extending its reach. A few days ago the company entered into a new agreement with leading operator Unibet, expanding its game offerings in the UK.</p>
<p>The iGaming market in Ontario is considered highly promising in North America. Last month, speaking at the Canadian Gaming Summit, executive director Martha Otton of iGaming Ontario mentioned that the local online casino market’s year-over-year results were expected to be more than three times larger. Additionally, a report by Deloitte highlighted that Ontario’s regulated iGaming industry has a substantial economic impact of CA$1.6 billion ($1.2 billion), supporting 12,000 full-time jobs and offering significantly higher average salaries compared to the rest of the province.</p>
