    <h1>Philadelphia Mississippi Casino Mgm Casinos Las Vegas Yaamava Resort Casino San Manuel Blvd Highland</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I understand what your saying but I find this is a unique situation in which I followed the websites protocol. The websites safer gambling section informs if you want to and I quote "permanently close account" to email support. It doesn’t say anything else.</p>
<p>i have attached pictures with bet uk’s instructions that I followed.</p>
<p>I absolutely did not want to self exclude. I wanted to BAN my account and prevent from accessing the websites on any other accounts going forward, that is what I said, clearly I am referring to a problem to the email instructed to contact via their safer gambling page. So I followed what it told me to do. Me saying ban is clearly saying I don’t want to bet again as I have a problem, a ban is where you can never access again, everybody knows that. I should of never been able to reopen this account. Again I take some responsibility, but my problem has not been looked after here. If the way of perm banning my account should of been in a different way as you say, then the safer gambling page of betuk should have stated, I followed exactly what was told.</p>
<p>id like to stress the account was closed when requested, so they listened, they just allowed me to re open. I guess it comes down to how they have read my email, and they knew I had previously been on Gamstop and was currently on gamban. Therefore me saying ban my account and not open any more should be clear enough in my eyes</p>
<p>thanks</p>
