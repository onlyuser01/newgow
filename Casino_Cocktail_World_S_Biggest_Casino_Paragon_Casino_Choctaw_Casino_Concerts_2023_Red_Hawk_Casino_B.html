    <h1>Casino Cocktail World S Biggest Casino Paragon Casino Choctaw Casino Concerts 2023 Red Hawk Casino B</h1>

<p>It’s official, German soccer has returned in style! We saw some really breathtaking moments in the Bundesliga on Saturday – Borussia Dortmund winning the Ruhr Derby, VAR saving the day for RB Leipzig, Hertha Berlin hammering Hoffenheim, and more.</p>
<p>More excitement awaits us on Sunday, May 17 when two more matches are on schedule. If you’re planning to put your money on those games, here’s a Bundesliga betting preview that could help you with your picks.</p>
<p>FC Koln vs Mainz Preview</p>
<p>FC Koln is the team that almost got Bundesliga officials to decide not to return to action. At the beginning of the month, it was revealed that three members of the club had tested positive for the coronavirus. One of those was the club’s physio; one was a player from the reserves.</p>
<p>The third FC Koln player to be diagnosed with COVID-19 was Ismail Jakobs, a left-back who’s played 14 Bundesliga matches this season. Even though he’s had no symptoms for awhile, he will have to stay in quarantine.</p>
<p>Jakobs is not the only defender from FC Koln who will miss the clash with Mainz. Rafael Czichos, who’s played even more Bundesliga games this season, is also out. In his case, it’s not COVID-19 that’s the reason for absence. Instead, a back injury is what will keep him sidelined.</p>
<p>FC Koln’s defense might seem weakened, but that’s nothing compared to the problems Mainz has at the back. This team will have to play without their first-choice goalie Robin Zentner.</p>
<p>Instead, Florian Muller will have to step up as his replacement, a goalkeeper who’s played four Bundesliga matches this season. In those four games, he conceded a total of 13 goals, which is a statistic that’s got to worry the Mainz fans.</p>
<p>The bets: FC Koln (-117); Over 2.5 goals (+114)</p>
<p>Union Berlin vs Bayern Munich Preview</p>
<p>If you wonder what would happen with the Bundesliga if COVID-19 came back, the answer is that the season would not be cancelled. Instead, the league would declare the season finished and the team that’s at the top of the table at the moment would be crowned the champion.</p>
<p>Right now, the team that’s at the very top is Bayern Munich. However, ahead of the game with Union Berlin, the reigning champion has only one point more than the second-placed Borussia Dortmund. The reason is that BVB has played already this weekend. Nevertheless, Bayern Munich mustn’t relax. This team needs a win in Berlin to get a step closer to the title.</p>
<p>Bayern Munich players definitely have what it takes to beat Union Berlin. In fact, the same goes for literally any team in Germany. Not only is Bayern the strongest team in Germany, but it’s also one of the main favorites for winning the Champions League this season.</p>
<p>That’s actually a commonly known fact. Everyone knows about Bayern’s power, including sportsbooks. That’s why the odds are not too attractive. If you believe (-526) is not a great value (which it really isn’t), you’re probably looking for some more lucrative bets.</p>
<p>Here’s one that might interest you – Robert Lewandowski to score anytime.</p>
<p>The striker has scored 25 goals already this season, which is more than any other player in the league. Another interesting fact about his goal-scoring performance is that he’s scored at least a goal in seven of his eight previous matches.</p>
<p>The Bets: Bayern Munich (-526); Robert Lewandowski to score (+180); Over 3.5 Goals (-111)</p>
