    <h1>Drake Casino Login Wildhorse Casino Oregon Grand Rapids Casino Royal Casino Offers Raging Bull Casin</h1>

<p>Dear Casino.guru,</p>
<p>I am writing to express my deep dissatisfaction and frustration with the withdrawal process at Pinnacle Casino. I have encountered significant difficulties when attempting to withdraw my funds using Litecoin, as Pinnacle is not allowing me to do so. Instead, they insist that I withdraw to WebMoney, which does not support VND withdrawal.</p>
<p>I have made numerous attempts to explain to Pinnacle that WebMoney is not a viable option for me due to its lack of VND withdrawal support. After some correspondence, Pinnacle finally acknowledged this limitation and assured me, via email, that I could withdraw my funds using an alternative method. This communication provided me with a sense of security, leading me to believe that I was not obligated to use WebMoney for the withdrawal. Consequently, I chose not to withdraw all my funds at that time.</p>
<p>To my dismay, when I recently attempted to withdraw a portion of my funds, Pinnacle informed me that I am now required to withdraw all of my money to WebMoney. This requirement is deeply unfair since using WebMoney would essentially result in the loss of my funds, as VND withdrawal from Webmoney is not supported. What troubles me the most, however, is the inconsistency in Pinnacle's communication. Previously, they clearly stated that I could withdraw my funds using an alternative method, only to later retract that offer.</p>
<p>I am reaching out to you, as a reputable authority in the online casino industry, to seek your assistance in resolving this matter. I kindly request that you intervene on my behalf to ensure that Pinnacle Casino honors their initial agreement and allows me to withdraw my funds using Litecoin method. Furthermore, I believe it is essential that Pinnacle improves their communication practices to avoid misleading customers and causing unnecessary inconvenience.</p>
<p>I appreciate your attention to this matter and your support in resolving this issue promptly. I hope that together, we can rectify the situation and ensure a fair and transparent withdrawal process for all Pinnacle customers.</p>
<p>Thank you for your assistance.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely</p>
