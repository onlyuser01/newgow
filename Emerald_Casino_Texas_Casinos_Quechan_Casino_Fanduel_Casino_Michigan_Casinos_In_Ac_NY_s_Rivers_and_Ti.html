<p>New York’s Rivers and Tioga Launch Sports Betting This Week</p>
<p>New York is set to accept its first sports bets the Rivers Casino in Schenectady and Tioga Downs in Nichols launching today, July 16 and tomorrow, July 17 respectively. Both casinos have obtained a license from the New York Gaming Commission, allowing them to begin accepting wagers in person.</p>

<p>Rivers’ facilities will offer a great lounge equipped with a LED wall along with 22 TV monitors and as many as 16 separate kiosks where bettors will be able to place their wagers. Commenting on events, Rivers Casino &amp; Resort general manager Justin Moore had the following to say:</p>
<p>We couldn’t be happier to start construction on our new sportsbook and we’re looking forward to opening one of the first licensed sportsbooks in the state of New York at Rivers Casino &amp; Resort Schenectady.</p>
<p>He further added that the sports betting offer introduced by Rivers would excite bettors across the Capital Region. Fans are welcome at any time, Moore concluded. At the same time, Tioga Downs is readying to launch its own sportsbook with the help of FanDuel which has landed its name to the property.</p>
<p>While the sportsbook is launching on July 17, the official first bet will be placed two days later, on Thursday, July 19 with the inaugural bet placed by New York State Assemblywoman Donna Lupardo.</p>
<p>Land-based Sportsbooks Take Precedence over Digital Wagering</p>
<p>While New York seems to be on to a good thing insofar as sports betting goes, the Empire State is still missing mobile and online wagering. Senator Joseph Addabbo, one of the key proponents of the betting legislation, has failed to pass a bill in June that would have made it possible for the state’s residents to place wagers using their phones.</p>
<p>Under the current statures, New York sportsbooks will be paying as much as 10% on their betting revenue in tax. Meanwhile, more companies are preparing to enter the market. The Oneida Indian Nation has teamed up with Caesars Entertainment to roll out two betting offers come August 1.</p>
<p>The first one will be at Turning Stone Resort Casino in Verona and the second one will come at Point Place Casino in Bridgeport. Turning Stone Resort has immense potential as it’s one of the flagship properties owned by the Oneida Indian Nation and sprawls on 100,000 square feet.</p>
<p>New York is finally going to get its own sports betting activities rolled out officially. In fact, the Empire State was among the first to regulate the activities back in 2013, but the federal ban known as PASPA prohibited any casinos from accepting wagers.</p>
<p>Then, in 2018, the ban was struck down courtesy of New Jersey which won a case in the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS) and states have been legalizing their activities en masse ever since.</p>
