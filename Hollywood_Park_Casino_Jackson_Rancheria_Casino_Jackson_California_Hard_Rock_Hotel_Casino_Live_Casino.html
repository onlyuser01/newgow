<p>3 Oaks Gaming, one of the quickest-developing gaming studios in the iGaming industry, has signed a new partnership with Lucky Drops, a company that specializes in the creation of promotional tools for the sector. Lucky Drops develops solutions that help “remove gaps in player activity” and boosts engagement and retention rates across the board.</p>
<p>3 Oaks Gaming Leverages New Promo Solutions</p>
<p>Lucky Drops are designed in a way that distributes random prizes and rewards players out of a preset prize pool over a specific period of time. The prizes that Lucky Drops extends could be custom and real money prizes, multiplier options, and even bigger rewards, designed to appeal to players and meet user expectations.</p>
<p>Lucky Drops has a “Hot Period” feature that allows partner operators and studios to boost their retention rates and deliver value to players that makes them stick around and inspires brand loyalty. The software provided by Lucky Drops takes a deep look at historic player data to craft tailored products that strike home with player bases of all backgrounds.</p>
<p>Adjustments are made in real-time to better reflect what players need and prefer and 3 Oaks Gaming is happy to leverage this data to integrate it into its own games, which will ultimately benefit partner operators. The solution is even more worthwhile as it doesn’t require any specific integrations and is readily available to operators once a game is introduced.</p>
<p>3 Oaks Gaming is determined to benefit from the range of promotional products that Lucky Drops leverages in order to build its momentum in the iGaming space. The supplier has released dozens of titles in only a single year of operation and more products are forthcoming.</p>
<p>Commenting on this opportunity, 3 Oaks Gaming managing director Sebastian Damian has said that the company was happy to integrate the range of promotional tools into its offering to deliver an even better experience for players and partner casinos.</p>
<p>Commercial Success by Delivering Best Partner</p>
<p>“Whether you’re looking to plug the gap during quieter activity periods or elevate the user experience with a complementary promotion, Lucky Drops is destined to improve engagement and retention,” Damian added.</p>
<p>The solutions provided by Lucky Drops, argued the executive, add an extra dimension to every spin and make the experience even more worthwhile. Previously, 3 Oaks Gaming became part of the St8.io platform and the company has signed similar commercial partnerships with Hub88 and Technamin.</p>
