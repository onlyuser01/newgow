<p>Underdog Fantasy, a fantasy sports platform describing itself as “the best place to play fantasy sports,” has secured Xpoint’s backing. Under the agreement, the geolocation technology specialist will become the Mark Cuban-backed platform’s official geolocation partner.</p>
<p>Xpoint to Supply Underdog Fantasy with Geolocation</p>
<p>Xpoint, which provides geolocation solutions to sportsbooks and gambling operators all over the world, has agreed to power Underdog Fantasy with geolocation tech. The company announced that the daily fantasy sports specialist has already adopted Xpoint Lite, a geolocation solution tailored to the needs of fantasy sports operators. With Xpoint Lite integrated into Underdog Fantasy’s platform, the latter company will be able to provide its customers with experiences that are safer, securer and fraud-free.</p>
<p>Xpoint Lite is designed especially for daily fantasy sports operators and is compatible with web and app platforms. It is also compatible with Xpoint’s Xpoint Verify solution, the company’s famed real-money sports wagering and online gambling tech.</p>
<p>Underdog Fantasy, meanwhile, is one of the fastest-growing fantasy sports companies in the USA. The platform is backed by an experienced team of decorated industry veterans and is ambitious on becoming a leading force in American fantasy sports. Underdog Fantasy’s objective is to engage sports enthusiasts with exciting contests and fantasy sports games while driving innovation in the sector with fresh ideas.</p>
<p>Xpoint Is Well-Positioned to Help Its New Partner</p>
<p>Matt Garrigan, Underdog Fantasy’s senior director of sports betting, spoke about the new agreement. He expressed his company’s excitement to join forces with Xpoint and provide players with safe and fun experiences while complying with local rule sets. Garrigan lauded Xpoint as a “believer in innovation,” praising the company for thinking outside the box, just like Underdog Fantasy.</p>
<p>Xpoint’s chief executive officer, Marvin Sanderson, also commented on the agreement. He said that he couldn’t be happier to add Underdog Fantasy to Xpoint’s list of live partners. The CEO said that he is happy to see so many new companies seek Xpoint’s solutions.</p>
<p>This is a critical time for Xpoint, as we grow and expand our North American footprint. Now we have multiple partners live across the USA and Canada, with millions of location checks taking place, ahead of our targeted growth position by this point in 2022, and with a very bright 2023 ahead. Marvin Sanderson, CEO, Xpoint</p>
<p>Sanderson concluded that Xpoint is well-positioned to help Underdog Fantasy differentiate itself from its competitors and rise as a leading force in US fantasy sports.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, Xpoint also agreed to supply the sports betting operator Rivalry with geolocation solutions.</p>
