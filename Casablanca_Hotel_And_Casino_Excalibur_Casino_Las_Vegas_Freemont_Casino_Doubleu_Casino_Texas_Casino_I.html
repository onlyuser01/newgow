<p>Inspired Entertainment, a leading games and slot machines provider, has unveiled five new online and mobile slot games. Through these new titles, Inspired aims to kick start the summer season and engage players with more games.</p>
<p>Inspired Launches Five New Games</p>
<p>Inspired Entertainment’s five new games are called Big Egyptian Fortune, Big Wheel Bonus, Chilly Prize Pots, Gold Cash Big Spins and Grizzly! All of them offer something new and special as Inspired hopes to provide players with a choice. Each of the titles has a unique theme and atmosphere, as well as engaging mechanics that will keep users at the edge of their seats.</p>
<p>The release of the games comes as a celebration of the summer season. Steve Collet, the chief product officer of Inspired Entertainment elaborated:</p>
<p>“Inspired is launching into the summer season with a variety of new titles, bringing back and extending our successful ‘big’ mechanics in three of the five releases including Gold Cash Big Spins, Big Egyptian Fortune and Big Wheel Bonus.</p>
<p>In addition, some of the games will offer gamers more chances to become winners by providing them with tons of free spins. Chilly Prize Pots, and the highly-volatile Grizzly! are two such games, for example.</p>
<p>Collet is certain that the company’s “sizzling hot games” will help players have fun and enjoy the summer. He added that Inspired will be releasing more games on a monthly basis so fans will always have something new to keep them busy.</p>
<p>A Busy Year for Inspired</p>
<p>2022 so far has been a busy year for Inspired Entertainment. The first half of the year saw the supplier successfully foray into numerous new markets and dramatically expand its footprint. In May, the company acquired a gaming manufacturer’s license from Pennsylvania’s regulator and launched in the state. Two months earlier, Inspired expanded into Connecticut thanks to a deal with the first-class operator DraftKings.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Inspired Entertainment received a gaming-related supplier’s license from the Alcohol and Gambling Commission of Ontario. Thanks to that, the company entered Canada’s freshest gambling market. In March, the supplier expanded its presence in Europe as well, thanks to its deal with Sisal in Italy.</p>
<p>In May, Inspired Entertainment published its financial results for the first quarter of the year. The company reported a whopping 166% increase in revenue, earning over $60 million for the period. Thanks to its spectacular performance, Inspired has successfully returned to its pre-pandemic revenue levels.</p>
