<p>Following a significant win in the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS), the Seminole Tribe of Florida has confirmed on Tuesday that it is relaunching its dedicated mobile sports betting app, which was discontinued in 2021 after a challenge issued to the compact signed between Gov. Ron DeSantis and the Native American tribe hampered the app’s smooth rollout.</p>
<p>Now, though, with SCOTUS clearing the path to sports betting under the compact deal with the state, and despite two lawsuits hanging over its head, the tribe has decided to fire from all cylinders so far as sports betting goes.</p>
<p>In a statement, tribe spokesperson Gary Bitner had this to say: "The Seminole Tribe is offering limited access to existing Florida customers to test its Hard Rock Bet platform."</p>
<p>In-person sports betting is now set to launch in Florida on December 7, giving the Seminole Tribe a particularly strong position in the local market, or to put it another way - exclusivity. The tribe’s casinos are also adding other high-value products, such as craps and roulette under the 2021 Compact.</p>
<p>The news was naturally welcomed by Seminole Gaming CEO and Hard Rock International ChairmanJim Allen who said that the launch was a historic milestone for the state, and the tribe. Yet, not much is known about the current rollout other than it’s going to be available in "limited capacity" and serve primarily as a "test function"</p>
<p>It’s not clear if the app would also be available across the state. The official website of Hardrock Bet also states in an all-caps statement that "Legal sports betting is coming to Florida," which most likely suggests that the tribe would be all for pushing out its app. Residents of Florida are familiar with how the app works as well.</p>
<p>Back in 2021, locals were allowed the brief and tempting comfort of registering and playing with the dedicated sports betting app by the Hard Rock International brand. The days when this is once again possible may not be that far, which gives everyone high hopes for Florida joining the family of sports betting states.</p>
<p>Of course, the risk of having the app shut down should not be ignored as even though SCOTUS argued that the Compact was legal, and the Seminole Tribe could continue, the Department of the Interior, consulting on the matter, added that the matter may still be taken to the Supreme Court of Florida and resolved there.</p>
