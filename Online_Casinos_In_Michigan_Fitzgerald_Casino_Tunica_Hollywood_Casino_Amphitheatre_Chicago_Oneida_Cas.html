<p>Spelinspektionen, the Swedish Gambling Authority, has announced the financial results for the regulated gambling market for the second quarter of 2022.</p>
<p>Swedish Licensed Gambling Operators’ GGR 4% Higher Year-On-Year</p>
<p>The Swedish Gambling Authority reported that the total GGR for all licensed gambling operators in Sweden for the second quarter of 2022 totaled SEK 6.8 billion ($625 million), which is 4% higher than the 6.5 billion ($599.8 million) reported for the same period last year.</p>
<p>iGaming together with online sports wagering brought in SEK 4.20 billion ($386 million) in the second quarter of 2022, marking an increase of 2.8% in comparison to the same period last year.</p>
<p>The Swedish lottery, which is being provided by Svenska Spel together with slot machines that are also operated by the state-owned company contributed with revenue of SEK 1.41 billion ($129.7 billion), which was almost 1% higher than the SEK 1.40 billion ($128.8 billion) reported in the second quarter of 2021.</p>
<p>Brick-and-mortar casinos generated SEK 145 million ($13 million) in Q2, 2022, however, in the second quarter of 2021 casinos were closed due to the pandemic and it is not possible to compare results year-on-year.</p>
<p>The Swedish Gambling Authority also noted that at the end of the second quarter 76,400 people had used the services of the regulator’s self-exclusion program, Spelpaus, a 4% increase compared to the previous quarter.</p>
<p>85% of Gamblers in Sweden Are Familiar with Spelpaus</p>
<p>The Swedish Gaming Authority, in collaboration with SKOP, also published the results of a survey on Swedes’ online gambling habits. 4,400 people aged 18 or over were interviewed about their online gambling habits from May until June 2022.</p>
<p>One of the key findings of the survey was that one in three Swedes gamble online at least once a quarter and that 85% of the respondents were familiar with Spelpaus and its purpose. The survey also revealed that the main reasons for choosing gambling operators with a Swedish license are safety, security, and control.</p>
<p>Still, not all Swedes gamble only on licensed websites. 8% of gamblers who play online at least once a quarter has stated that they used the services of a website without a Swedish license. It must be noted, however, that some of the respondents pointed to licensed websites when listing the unlicensed operators they have used.</p>
<p>It turned out that poker and online casinos were particularly popular among those who say that they play on sites without a Swedish gaming license.</p>
<p>According to the study, the main reason why Swedes choose unlicensed websites is, of course, bonus offers. Other reasons are that the player has blocked himself/herself via Spelpaus or because of preferable odds and winning opportunities.</p>
