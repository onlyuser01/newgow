<p>Kindred Group, the leading global online gambling operator, announced a partnership extension with the professional American football team based in Philadelphia, the Philadelphia Eagles. The company unveiled Thursday that it extended its collaboration with the NFL's team for three years.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the extended partnership, Kindred's brand, Unibet, will be the team's official casino, online casino and sportsbook partner. The agreement covers the period until the end of the 2024/25 season and will include a variety of fan engagement activities.</p>
<p>In a statement released on September 8, 2022, the Eagles' Vice President of Corporate Partnerships, Brian Napoli, said that the team is looking forward to extending its fully-integrated partnership with Unibet further. He explained: "Our growth in this emerging online space has enabled us to connect with Eagles fans in new and interactive ways thanks to Unibet's forward-thinking approach to the industry." In conclusion, Napoli revealed that the Eagles are excited to offer new engaging experiences for its fans.</p>
<p>Manuel Stan, Kindred's SVP North America, added: "Our partnership with the Eagles has been a key pillar in Unibet's strategy in Pennsylvania since the entry in the market and will continue to be an essential piece going forward." He pointed out that the company is pleased to extend its successful collaboration further and deliver engaging online and in-stadium experiences for Eagles' fans and Unibet customers.</p>
<p>According to the recent announcement, the brand will now have a "dedicated Unibet Landing location" at Lincoln Financial Field, the home stadium of the Eagles located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Via the dedicated Unibet Landing, the brand will deliver different fan engagement activities.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Eagles and Unibet will continue to collaborate for branded mobile casino games that will include Eagles-branded slots games and blackjack games, among others. The partnership will also bring additional in-stadium and digital activations and experiences.</p>
<p>Late last month, Kindred announced it will host a Sustainable Gambling Conference in Amsterdam on October 19. This marks the seventh consecutive year the company hosts the conference that seeks to boost the trust in the iGaming industry and make it safer.</p>
