<p>Kansspelautoriteit (KSA), the gambling regulator in the Netherlands, announced a new probe into affiliate websites it believes targeted problem gamblers.</p>
<p>Affiliates Face Investigation by the KSA</p>
<p>On Thursday, the regulator revealed that it launched a new investigation into websites that promoted illegal gambling. Upon searching for illegal gambling offers, the regulator came across a couple of affiliate websites. This caused a great deal of concern for the KSA since the two affiliates used domain names such as “casinowithoutlicense” as well as “casinowithoutcruks.”</p>
<p>“The Gaming Authority (KSA) is starting an investigation into websites that promote illegal online games of chance and focus on extra vulnerable people,“ reads a statement released by Kansspelautoriteit</p>
<p>As the domain suggests, one of the websites is after getting the attention of users who are interested in participating in illegal gambling. The other one, targeted people who are self-excluded from gambling in the country via Cruks, short for the Central Register Exclusion for Games of Chance.</p>
<p>The uncovered affiliates, according to the KSA, focused on vulnerable people and promoted illegal gambling activities. Those two actions are in breach of the Netherlands’ current gambling regulations. What’s more, the regulator pointed out that offering games of chance without a license is illegal, just as it is promoting illegal offerings.</p>
<p>“The KSA thinks it’s extra bad that these affiliates focus on problem players. In addition to offering games of chance without a license, promoting illegal offerings is also prohibited,“ added the KSA</p>
<p>The Dutch Gambling Regulator Remains Vigilant</p>
<p>Currently, there are strict regulations for gambling in the Netherlands. Back in October last year, the country implemented the Remote Gambling Act, also referred to as KOA. After nearly a decade, KOA implemented an effective regulatory gambling framework for online operators. Ultimately, the regulation sought to increase player protection, provide a fair market and ensure operators offering their services are licensed.</p>
<p>Under KOA, the Netherlands implemented Cruks, a register for all individuals who have self-excluded from gambling. Under the current regulations, any operator offering their services must check Cruks’ database and ensure that they are not permitting excluded individuals to gamble. While this process is after protecting the players, sadly, unlicensed operators do not adhere to those rules. Still, the KSA is on the lookout for bad actors and only recently warned two operators. The operators were not identified but earlier this month, the regulator warned them after discovering insufficient controls in place for online gambling activities. Upon announcing the warning, the KSA urged the operators to implement meaningful changes and vowed to check once again the progress in three months.</p>
