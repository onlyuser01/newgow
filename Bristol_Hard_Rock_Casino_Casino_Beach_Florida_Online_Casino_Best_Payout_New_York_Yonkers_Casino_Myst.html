<p>Follow the Path to Wild Riches with Chaishen</p>
<p>The team behind the current company originally started out by creating content for a popular casino brand in 2004. Ever since, it continued to focus on learning, developing, and delivering excellent content that quickly received players’ praises, officially turning into Dragon Gaming in 2019. The new Make You Rich slot invites players passionate about the Asian culture to receive their blessing from the Caishen Three Ingots and start collecting wins.</p>
<p>The game is designed with mesmerizing good luck symbols and it revolves around a gold-plated temple located high up in the mountains. Players get to spin the reels while listening to the soothing sounds of the ancient Orient on the 3×3 layout grid. The game only counts six different symbols. The low-paying symbols are represented by firecrackers, moneybags, firecrackers, and lanterns. Mid-paying symbols are represented by abacus and ruyi, while high-value symbols are pictures of the Caishen god himself holding his golden ingot.</p>
<p>Mega Spins Feature</p>
<p>Once a player gets a winning spin, an ingot is added to the Ingot Collector to the left. The collector has three available slots. Winning three consecutive times lets players completely fill out the Ingot Collector and engage the Mega Spins feature. Playing this special round means following the same rules as the ones used in the base game. The Mega Spins round introduces identical symbols to the ones in the base game. This time around, however, these symbols are worth 5x the original stake. The Mega Spins feature comes to an end once five winning spins are locked in.</p>
<p>The game offers a smooth, minimum, but mesmerizing experience for gamers with a passion for myths, legends, deities, and legends part of the fascinating Asian culture. The gaming studio released a series of fresh iGaming titles at the end of April, including the Z Invasion video slot and scratchcard games like Rise of the Titans and Play With Cleo.</p>
