    <h1>Casino In Greenville Ms Vegas Casino Casino Albuquerque Nm Golden Nugget Online Casino Pa San Diego</h1>

<p>The game was exclusively available on Stake for a month and is now available for general release</p>
<p>A few months after launching content in Mexico, online casino content provider BGaming announced the release of a new high-volatility slot game called Dice Bonanza. As the title suggests, the new game is dice-themed and features symbols represented by dice sides.</p>
<p>The game is intuitive yet engaging and has a huge winning potential with the maximum win being x15,000 the bet.</p>
<p>Dice Bonanza Metrics</p>
<p>Rows: 5</p>
<p>Reels: 6</p>
<p>Paylines: Pays Anywhere</p>
<p>RTP: 96%</p>
<p>Volatility: High</p>
<p>Min/Max Bet: 0.20/50</p>
<p>Max Win: x15,000</p>
<p>The Game Is Simple Yet Engaging</p>
<p>In a game of Dice Bonanza, players will collect symbols represented by numbered dice or dice with geometrical symbols. Instead of using paylines, the game rewards players for collecting stacks of dice. All symbols pay anywhere on the screen.</p>
<p>Dice Bonanza sports a cascading mechanic where winning symbols are taken out of the grid and replaced by other symbols. As a result, players can score multiple wins with a single spin, increasing their winning potential.</p>
<p>The max win is €375,000 ($418,000) allowing lucky players to turn their wager into a huge paycheck.</p>
<p>The game was released exclusively on Stake a month ago and is now available for general release, allowing many more players to try it out.</p>
<p>Free Spins Mode Offers Many Chances to Win</p>
<p>In addition to its engaging mechanics and payline-free gameplay, Dice Bonanza has a Free Spins bonus round that can be activated when a number of scatter symbols are collected.</p>
<p>Scatter symbols are represented by a die with a W symbol on it. Collecting four such symbols will award 10 free spins. Five and six such symbols will award 15 and 20 free spins, respectively. Furthermore, getting combos of scatter symbols during the bonus round awards extra spins, extending the round.</p>
<p>During Free Spins mode, players can also land on multiplier symbols represented by a golden safe. When players land on a safe, it will open, revealing a random multiplier of between x2 and x100.</p>
<p>If players don’t feel like waiting, they can use the Buy Bonus feature to immediately kick off the Free Spins action. Alternatively, they can trigger the Chance x2 feature to increase their bet by 1.25 and double their chance of triggering Free Spins mode.</p>
<p>The Game Was a Hit on Stake.com</p>
<p>BGaming’s co-chief product officer, Yulia Aliakseeva, praised the new release, saying that dice games are increasingly popular among players. She said that the game was a hit with Stake – a success BGaming was assured in.</p>
<p>As well-known symbols of gambling and casinos across the globe, dice remind players of fun table games – but Dice Bonanza promises much higher chances of winning. Yulia Aliakseeva, co-CPO, BGaming</p>
<p>In April, BGaming vowed to continue sponsoring the Scatters Club Streamers Battle.</p>
