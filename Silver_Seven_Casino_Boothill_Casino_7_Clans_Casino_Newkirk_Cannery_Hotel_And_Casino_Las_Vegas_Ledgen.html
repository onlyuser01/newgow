<p>Manchester City Is One Step Away from the Treble</p>
<p>The Cityzens have already won the English Premier League, as well as the FA Cup. On Saturday, June 10, Pep Guardiola‚Äôs men stand a chance of winning another trophy ‚Äì the 2023 Champions League.</p>
<p>They‚Äôve got the motivation to do so, as that‚Äôs the only trophy they still don‚Äôt have in their collection. Further, they also have the manpower to pull it off. This team has at least one great player in every position on the pitch.</p>
<p>üö® Erling Haaland: "Everybody knows #ManCity have won every trophy except the #UCL without me. So that's a part of why I came here."</p>

<p>Erling Haaland has been their standout player, scoring 52 goals in 51 games in all competitions. He‚Äôs the scoring leader of the 2023 Champions League with 12 goals in 10 games. Truth be told, he was struggling with fitness in the second half of May. That‚Äôs why we haven‚Äôt seen him score a goal in almost a month. But that might change this Saturday. After all, scoring is his job.</p>
<p>Still, even if he doesn‚Äôt get on target (and we think he will!), Manchester City still has plenty of other players who could destroy Inter Milan.</p>
<p>Inter Milan Has Already Achieved a Lot in the 2022-23 UCL</p>
<p>Before the start of the 2022-23 Champions League season, Inter Milan was seen as one of the dark horses for the trophy. But these guys managed to get all the way to the final. Truth be told, ‚ÄúI Nerazzurri‚Äù did have luck on their side.</p>
<p>In the semifinal, Inter Milan knocked out AC Milan, while in the quarterfinal, the black-and-blues did better than Benfica. And in the first round of the knockout stage, Simone Inzaghi‚Äôs boys defeated Porto. None of the aforementioned teams were thought of as UCL favorites before the start of the season.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI Nerazzurri‚Äù did, however, play against a couple of strong UCL teams in the regular season. They played two games against Bayern Munich, losing both of them. They also played against Barcelona, which was completely out of form at the time. The Italians won at home and drew at Camp Nou.</p>
<p>Manchester City vs Inter Milan UCL Final Prediction</p>
<p>We don‚Äôt think Inter Milan is a UCL-winning material. This team just isn‚Äôt as good as Manchester City. Sure, these guys will give their utmost on Saturday, but we just can‚Äôt see them cause too many problems for Guardiola‚Äôs men.</p>
<p>Pick: Manchester City to win &amp; over 2.5 goals</p>
