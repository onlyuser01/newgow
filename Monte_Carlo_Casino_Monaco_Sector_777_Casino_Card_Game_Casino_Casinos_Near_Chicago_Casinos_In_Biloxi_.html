<p>Aruze Gaming America and Galaxy Gaming have teamed up to deliver more interactive content with craps as one of the main focuses of the partnership. This means that Aruze Gaming America players will have access to Galaxy craps tables, making for some of the best experiences out there.</p>
<p>Bonus Craps to Improve the Interactive Experience</p>
<p>Galaxy Gaming has an extensive portfolio of games that are readily available to partners. The studio, which is based in Las Vegas, has been producing many excellent casino products, including bingo, table games, and slots, available to operators worldwide.</p>
<p>The latest addition to this portfolio is Bonus Craps which will now be part of the Aruze Gaming America offering and help bring this title to the market and bigger audiences. Craps and keno are usually underrepresented in most casinos in the United States and especially in the digital segment.</p>
<p>The Bonus Craps game comes with three small wagers dubbed All Small, All Tall, and Make’em All. Players then get to shoot real dice across an interactive LED screen merging the best of the physical and digital world. Galaxy Gaming president and CEO Todd Cravens welcomed the opportunity and said:</p>
<p>“Our priority is making sure we continue to thrill players with our content, however, they may play. Partnering with Aruze to add Bonus Craps to the popular Roll To Win Craps product is a perfect example of this.” Galaxy Gaming president and CEO Todd Cravens</p>
<p>Aruze Gaming president Rob Ziems said that the key to success in today’s gaming environment relies on having more people drawn to a company’s offering and keeping those players engaged. With titles such as Bonus Craps and the popular Roll to Win Craps product, Ziems is confident that this is going to be the case for Azure.</p>
<p>“We are excited to provide our customers and their players this enticing Craps combination,” Ziems said. Aruze Gaming operates in 40 countries and it creates its unique variety of slot and table games. Some popular titles Azure is known for are Go Go Claw, Wealth of Coins, and X Wheel Tiki.</p>
<p>Azure has its products currently available in the Hard Rock Casino, Tampa Hard Rock Casino, and the Rivers Casino.</p>
