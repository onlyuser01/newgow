<p>BGaming, an award-winning supplier and developer of titles for the online casino sector, has taken another geographical stride in Latin America and expanded its presence in the Peruvian market.</p>
<p>The company has teamed up with Betara, a respected and established local brand, allowing both entities to benefit from their respective expertise and continue to grow with local customer bases.</p>
<p>This partnership will result in BGaming integrating more than 100 of its titles into Betara, which will significantly enliven the experience for players who are registered with the brand.</p>
<p>Commenting on this opportunity, Betara Head of Marketing Daniel Vargas welcomed the chance to work with BGaming on this further content expansion for his company.</p>
<p>Vargas hailed BGaming for its player-oriented approach in the design of gaming products and said that Betara was very excited about the opportunity to collaborate and strengthen its presence in the Peruvian iGaming market.</p>
<p>"The studio is also known for its exclusive brands created in collaboration with the main operators in the sector where Betara will have a special participation to launch exclusive games and branded with its own brand," Vargas added.</p>
<p>All in all, this tie-up would help the operator to significantly strengthen its position in the vibrant market.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, BGaming CCO Olga Levshina was pleased with the opportunity to see her company grow yet again in the desired and fast-evolving Latin American market. She said that BGaming has become a supplier to be known for its quality product releases and seamless integration.</p>
<p>"We look forward to a successful ongoing partnership with Betara and providing our ever-expanding portfolio to its players," Levshina wrapped up. BGaming has of course been working hard to establish its footprint globally, with the supplier keen to secure one important partnership after the next.</p>
<p>The company has secured a licensing in Spain from BMM Testlabs, allowing it to venture forward into the regulated iGaming jurisdiction and present its titles with local audiences and trusted operators.</p>
<p>BGaming has also been amping up its production pace, bringing a number of interesting and worthwhile games across the board to strengthen its content library. Among the releases planned for September are such noteworthy titles as Mice &amp; Magic Wonder Spin, Wild Cash Dice, Maneki 88 Fortunes, Bone Bonanza, and many other worthwhile games to try and explore.</p>
<p>BGaming will also be attending the upcoming SBC Summit Barcelona, where anyone interested may reach out to the supplier and discuss fresh business opportunities.</p>
