    <h1>Casinos In Southern California Mbit Casino No Deposit Bonus Borgata Casino Login First Casino In Veg</h1>

<p>Seriously they cutt off my hand most important after asked customer support twice I make withdrawl if I m not able for withdraw whose responsibility for that and if they didn't give withdraw why don't they reversed in my balance they took off all winning money I only request if not given money than add back in my balance it's not my fault totally customer support fault why I suffer</p>
<p>Add back money in balance that's Fair for both of us</p>
<p>it's not solution that u cutt all winning money without my fault</p>
<p>And you look my bets it's smaller quite smaller than Max bet if I bet 48 inr and won 60000inr in slot is this bigg bet you can check all bet under 250 INR their talking LIE and if I'm unable for that why customer support say yes after take his time and after show my account who responsible for that i just checked reedeem point that I already passed and bonus money automatically add in real money than I go to customer support for withdraw request</p>
<p>And what about if I lose 2500+2500 inr than no issue</p>
<p>Issue only start when I start winning without using their bonus balance so now pain came in their stumuch</p>
<p>They only lieing I didn't bet any higher I can show you all my bet</p>
<p>And one more thing in past they already snatch 65000 inr for damn this bonus breached matter but that time I ignore that it can be my fault but this time all fault from their side not mine</p>
