<p>Since the entry of Unibet on the UK market in 2013, today the company reaches a ‚Äúlandmark‚Äù moment with its 1000th horse racing sponsorship. The online operator reaches the 1000 race landmark by sponsoring both the Grade 1 Unibet Morgiana Hurdle at Punchestown and the Grade 3 Unibet Greatwood Hurdle at Cheltenham today. Furthermore, today Unibet sponsors a new Grade 2 hurdle at Punchestown to complement its ‚ÄúUnibet Morgiana sponsorship on the same day, entitled Unibet 1000th Race Celebration‚Äú.</p>

Since its market entry in 2013, more than 9,000 runners have raced in the 1,000 races sponsored by Unibet.</p>
