    <h1>Windstar World Casino Choctaw Casino Restaurants Tennessee Casino Big Candy Casino Horseshoe Casino</h1>

<p>Greentube looks forward to growing alongside Jokerstar in the region for years to come, regional manager Schagerl said</p>
<p>Greentube, a NOVOMATIC-owned provider of online casino content, has agreed to provide German operator Jokerstar with a selection of its best games. The deal will expand the B2B company’s European footprint while reinforcing its new partner’s content offering.</p>
<p>As agreed, Greentube will leverage its industry-leading library of games to provide Jokerstar with exciting gaming experiences. Some of the games that will make their way into the operator’s platform include classic hits such as Book of Ra Deluxe, Lucky Lady’s Charm Deluxe and Sizzling Hot.</p>
<p>One of the first games to be added to Jokerstar’s portfolio is CASH CONNECTION Book of Ra, an Egyptian-themed slot where players are tasked with discovering ancient artifacts.</p>
<p>Jokerstar is a King Automaten-owned third-gen family-run gambling business that is deeply rooted in Germany’s land-based casino sector. The company owns a whopping 165 casino arcade properties in the European country and is a well-known name among local players.</p>
<p>Jokerstar entered the digital sector last year after successfully securing a license from Germany’s new federal gambling regulator, the Glücksspielbehörde der Länder (GGL). The online platform proved to resonate with players, prompting the company to double down on its online business and enhance its products with more games from industry-leading suppliers.</p>
<p>Greentube Hopes for a Long and Fruitful Partnership</p>
<p>Greentube’s regional manager, Julia Schagerl, commented on the new deal, praising Jokerstar as “one of Germany’s most recognizable land-based operators.” She lauded the company’s strong reputation among local players and said that her team is happy to add games to Jokerstar’s portfolio.</p>
<p>We are delighted to have further enhanced our premium portfolio of games on the site and look forward to growing alongside the brand in the region for years to come. Julia Schagerl, regional manager, Greentube</p>
<p>Jokerstar’s owner and chief executive officer, Jürgen Kling, described Greentube as a supplier that “needs no introduction.”</p>
<p>As one of the world’s leading slot developers, their games are steeped in the company’s land-based heritage, while also providing important innovative elements. We could not be happier to be able to offer our players their first-class portfolio of games. Jürgen Kling, owner &amp; CEO, Jokerstar</p>
<p>Last month, Greentube strengthened its European presence through a partnership arrangement with Betway in Belgium. Earlier this year, the supplier also provided content to bet365 in the Netherlands.</p>
