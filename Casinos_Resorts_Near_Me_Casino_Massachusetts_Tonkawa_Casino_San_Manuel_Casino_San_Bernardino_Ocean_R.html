    <h1>Casinos Resorts Near Me Casino Massachusetts Tonkawa Casino San Manuel Casino San Bernardino Ocean R</h1>

<p>The new chair has substantial sports betting and management experience, making him a valuable addition to the RMG team. Grant received warm welcomes and pledged to become a worthy successor to former chair Roger Lewis. Grant’s expertise and passion for the sport will help secure RMG‘s place as the leading British horseracing supporter.</p>
<p>Former Chairman Lewis Is Now Free To Leave</p>
<p>Grant’s hire is a great relief to Racecourse Media Group, as the company struggled to find a replacement for the departing Roger Lewis. The now-former chair had to postpone his plans and remain with RMG for a few extra months to ensure a smooth transition of responsibilities. The company’s management team expressed gratitude for his contributions and wished him the best of luck in his future endeavors.</p>
<p>I would like to pay tribute to Roger Lewis for a very effective and successful stewardship of RMG. Nevin Truesdale, RMG Board non-executive director and The Jockey Club CEO</p>
<p>The new chairman steps into the shoes of a well-regarded and successful predecessor. Since his appointment in 2019, Lewis saw RMG’s license fees and dividend payments rise from £45 million ($55.5 million) to over £110 million ($135.7 million). His input was instrumental in securing several high-profile agreements. Despite the high expectations, Grant’s impressive skill set makes him more than ready for the task.</p>
<p>Grant Is a Respected Professional</p>
<p>Conor Grant has over two decades of experience in the sports betting industry. Starting as a manager at Paddy Power in 1998, he moved on to several other operators, expanding his skills and knowledge. His longest tenure was with Sky Betting &amp; Gaming. Over ten years, he rose from head of sportsbook product management to COO, cementing his position as one of the sports betting market’s leading professionals.</p>
<p>Grant joins RMG after a two-year tenure as Flutter UK &amp; Ireland CEO. The industry veteran previously expressed his intention to take a break and spend some time with his family, but RMG’s proposal appears to have won him over. An avid racehorse owner, Grant perhaps considers the new position an acceptable middle ground between remaining in the industry and taking things a bit easier.</p>
<p>The Board Welcomed Grant With Open Arms</p>
<p>The RMG management team welcomed Conor to the RMG Board, lauding his substantial expertise, hoping it would help the company accomplish its strategies and overcome potential challenges. The board believed the new chairman’s experience as CEO would be instrumental in developing the business and ensuring the prosperity of its shareholder racecourses.</p>
<p>(Connor) is perfectly positioned to take RMG forward and help build and strengthen our relationships across the industry. Adam Waterworth, RMG Board non-executive director and Goodwood Estate MD of Events</p>
<p>Such a positive reception should encourage Grant as he embarks on the next leg of his professional journey. With the blessing of his predecessor and RMG about to announce record 2022 results, he should be in a perfect position to impart some of his vast knowledge and industry insights while reserving time for himself and his family.</p>
