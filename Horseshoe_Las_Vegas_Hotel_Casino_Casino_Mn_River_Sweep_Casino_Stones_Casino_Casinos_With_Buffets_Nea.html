<p>The agreement will see Parx Casino as the official local casino partner of the Sixers, while betPARX will become the official winning partner of the team.</p>
<p>The agreement will also see the Sixers and Parx Casino team up to host various watch parties at the latter’s Liberty Bell Beer Garden property. These events will be open to both Society 76 members, as well as to the general public, allowing sports fans to enjoy the team’s games together. The watch parties will provide guests with a free drink and a free $25 slot play voucher they can use to play games at the venue. In addition, visitors will get the chance to win some exclusive 76ers merch through raffles.</p>
<p>BetPARX, Greenwood’s online subsidiary, on the other hand, will offer an exclusive limited-time offer for new customers. The new welcome offer will run during the opening week of the 76ers schedule and will provide customers with a $20 Casino Bonus. Existing users, meanwhile, can benefit from the “Win-for-All” promotion that allows fans to engage themselves with a random bonus they can receive from the Sixers’ social media or their official app.</p>
<p>A Natural Progression of the Partnership</p>
<p>Katie O’Reilly, the chief revenue officer of the Sixers, spoke about the new agreement. She noted that betPARX has been an incredible partner so far as it really understands the team’s passions.
