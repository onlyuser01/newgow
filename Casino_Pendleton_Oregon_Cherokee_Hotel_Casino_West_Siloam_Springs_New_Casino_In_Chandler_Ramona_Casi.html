    <h1>Casino Pendleton Oregon Cherokee Hotel Casino West Siloam Springs New Casino In Chandler Ramona Casi</h1>

<p>EQL Games has teamed up with ReelPlay, an Australian iGaming developer and content supplier, with the pair now focusing on iLottery content for various lotteries based in the North American market. The partners will leverage EQL Games’ RGS technology and integrate various ReelPlay games directly into the content platforms of partner lotteries. Thanks to the company’s RGS technology, lotteries will be able to sell their games online.</p>
<p>EQL Games Takes ReelPlay Further Across NA</p>
<p>EQL Games is making a strong move in the lottery content aggregation space, adding ReelPlay as its second studio to date to partner for the distribution of games in this fashion. The partnership is mutually beneficial as it improves EQL Games’ offering in terms of pure product variety, and it also helps ReelPlay consolidate its position in the North American market.</p>
<p>While EQL Games is yet to build a robust library of partners, its first forays in the sector are already promising. The company has already signed a partnership to roll out its products and operations with the Michigan Lottery at some point in 2023. EQL Games CEO Brad Cummings welcomed the opportunity and said:</p>
<p>As we’ve listened to the challenges facing lotteries, especially in the US, one pressing need keeps rising to the top – lotteries with digital platforms need better content and more of it.</p>
<p>EQL Games does not want to just enter the market and pile on more content. The company sees itself as a problem-solver and as a firm that can buck existing trends. Cummings confirmed that his company will continue to seek out the best iGaming companies and introduce the most suitable ones to the lottery segment. According to the executive, ReelPlay easily fits that description.</p>
<p>ReelPlay Fits the Lottery Bill in North America</p>
<p>The company has the right sound, art, math, animation, and bonus rounds to make for exciting lottery experiences and give eInstant games a clear boost. ReelPlay is not exactly a stranger to the North American market, as it has been present there through localized partnerships for a while now.</p>
<p>The company distributes games also in Europe and has built an impressive portfolio, track record, and strong rapport with local iGaming leads. The tie-up with EQL Games can only add to its further success in new verticals of the experience.</p>
