    <h1>Casino Yuma Casino Free Bonus No Deposit Casino Cruise Florida Silver Nugget Casino Event Center Cas</h1>

<p>Hi, I need your help before I take legal action.</p>
<p>let's start from the beginning, I had a game account in the casinos of the infiniza limited company.</p>
<p>amok, refuel, mountgold, gemler. I was banned from all the casinos of that company due to a gaming problem. On 22 November 2022, I sent the following message to Infiniza Limited:</p>
<p>kindly ask you to block my access to your site because of my gambling problem.</p>
<p>If I have an account on your site, please close it permanently and stop all marketing.</p>
<p>If I haven't registered yet, please make your best effort to prevent me from doing so.</p>
<p>I hope this ban also applies to any of your "sister casinos" and possible future casinos.</p>
<p>Here are my personal details:</p>
<p>they banned me, however I managed to play on 5/1/2023 at their sister casino Raptor casino. Raptor casino operates under a different license, but they are sister casinos.</p>
<p>Raptor casino is part of the 79Affiliates partnership program, which includes all sister casinos, including all casinos of infiniza Limited: amok, refuel, mount gold, gemler.</p>
<p>Raptor Casino websites are exactly the same as infiniza Limited casinos, the employees are the same. the terms of use are the same and Raptor Casino's terms of use even mentioned that they are under infiniza Limited.</p>
<p>because I specifically asked for ALL SISTER CASINOS AND COMPANIES TO BE CLOSED THEY are neglecting me. Now my account at Raptor casino is also closed.</p>
<p>Because of this they have to return my money that I deposited.</p>
<p>i have done research and can prove in many ways that they are sister casinos. I have no correspondence with the casino as they do not respond.</p>
