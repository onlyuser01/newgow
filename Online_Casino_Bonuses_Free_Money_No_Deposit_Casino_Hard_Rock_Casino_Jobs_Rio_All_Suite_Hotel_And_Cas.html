<p>Compliance expert HooYu has published a new report that looks into the KYC onboarding and drop-out rate in the UK and non-UK markets.</p>
<p>HooYu Looks into UK Onboarding and Drop-Out Rates in the UK</p>
<p>A new report by HooYu has looked into the rate of customer retention operators experience as a result of advertising and bonus funnels in light of rigorous Know Your Customer (KYC) checks. The report estimates that the average sign-up KYC success rate for the United Kingdom is 86%, with large operators reporting the highest number, with 92.5%.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, the report shows that medium operators post a lower rate at 82.5% than small operators with 84.2%. The logic here is that customers may be more inclined to give a new product a shot, hence the higher conversion rate and willingness to stick through the KYC process.</p>
<p>With the national average at 86%, though, this means that 14% of potential customers in the country are still an untapped market. These are individuals who are willing to play but find the KYC compliance procedure too pesky to complete.</p>
<p>HooYu has worked out solutions that allow operators to simplify the KYC journey in the United Kingdom and lead to better overall onboarding.</p>
<p>KYC and Onboarding Outside the UK</p>
<p>Interestingly, the United Kingdom has one of the highest onboarding worldwide, with operators outside the UK struggling to retain customers with the same rate of success. The average operator posts 70% in retention rates, but this percentage is lower for small operators with 65% and medium operators with 68.3%.</p>
<p>Large operators again do comparatively well with 75% onboarding success. Part of that may be owing to the fact that they are well-established brands and generally known names to the public. Part of customer reluctance to onboard may be due to the lengthy procedure that KYC processes take.</p>
<p>How Long Does It Take to Go Through KYC</p>
<p>In the United Kingdom, for example, the average onboarding process takes 11 minutes.</p>
<p>Large operators onboard customers through KYC in 11:21 minutes, but small operators take 17:30 minutes. Interestingly, medium operators need only 6:37 minutes on average to complete a KYC process.</p>
<p>How come medium operators have a worse overall onboarding rate than small operators. The UK, though, is still a great place for KYC compliance. Outside the country, the rate goes up drastically.</p>
<p>Only 20% of all operators HooYu reviewed managed to complete onboarding in 30-60 minutes. Another 50% took up to half a day, which is still fairly quick, and then again another 30% took up a whole day.</p>
<p>Why Do Customers Bail on KYC?</p>
<p>Interestingly, HooYu went deeper, examining each aspect of the compliance process for both UK and non-UK customers and established what percentage of people dropped out and where.</p>
<p>For proof of ID, the drop-out rate was 20% (UK) and 40% (non-UK), proof of address was 20% (UK) and 34% (non-UK), and proof of source of funds was 35% for both UK and non-UK customers.</p>
