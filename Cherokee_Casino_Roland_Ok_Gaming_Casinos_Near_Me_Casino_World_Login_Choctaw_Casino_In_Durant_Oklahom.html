<p>The Terminator franchise has become a sci-fi staple and in the age of Artificial Intelligence, it may serve as a warning. Casino players need not worry about Doomsday or robots from the future sent back to hunt down John Connor, though, or at least not in real life, as Inspired Entertainment, a prominent developer of entertaining iGaming titles, has released its own take on the popular TV franchise.</p>
<p>The Terminator video slot is an innovative take on the classic which harks back to the original visuals introduced in the 1984 movie that started the whole thing. While the graphics may be seeking to elicit an emotional response from an audience that saw the first movie, the game stands remarkably well on its own.</p>
<p>In The Terminator, players will find a five-by-four grid with 20 paylines. The game features Inspired’s latest original mechanic, Win &amp; Spin, which gives players even more control and winnings to look forward to. In the meantime, the visuals will definitely introduce some of the most prominent characters of the movies, including Sarah Connor, Kyle Reese, The Terminator sent to protect these two, and of course, the evil, almost undestroyable Endoskeleton.</p>
<p>The game will feature stacked symbols and reel modifiers that will trigger Super Symbol Respins round which is designed to provide you with more rounds of fun. Meanwhile, there are more bonuses to look forward to in the base game as well. For example, players who get six or more Win &amp; Spin symbols get to plunge into the Win &amp; Spin Bonus game. This level will represent a chase between the main characters – Sarah Connor who will be chased by The Terminator starting three spaces behind.</p>
<p>As players progress through the Bonus Round, they will similarly have access to "mystery supply packs" that are available in it, which will present players with three specific options, named "ExtraLives," "Collector" and "Upgrade Prize," all of which provide you with different ways to navigate the experience and try to boost your winnings. There is also a "Cash Boost" feature in which random symbols are added to the grid to increase the player’s stake and the potential payout. The Bonus Round may end with a Grand Wheel spin that stands to pay 1,000x of the players’ stakes.</p>
<p>Commenting on this fresh release, Inspired Entertainment Chief Product Officer Steve Collett said that the company was very excited to be bringing the iconic movie to the slot world. Collett added that Inspired had done its due diligence and crafted a slot that stands out with excellent visual effects, a robust math profile, and many ways to boost the player winnings.</p>
<p>"Offering big potential wins and non-stop thrills, The Terminator is a welcome addition to our growing suite of fun, licensed content," he concluded.</p>
