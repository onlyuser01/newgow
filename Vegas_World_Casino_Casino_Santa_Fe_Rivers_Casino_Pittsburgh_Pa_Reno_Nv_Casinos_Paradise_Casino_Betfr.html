<p>Denver Broncos from the National Football League (NFL) announced Tuesday it entered into a multi-year partnership deal with UK-based sports book operator Betfred, through its US subsidiary Betfred USA Sports. The announcement of the agreement came a day before the official launch of the sports book at Saratoga Casino in Black Hawk, which would mark a debut for the Manchester-headquartered gaming operator in Colorado.</p>
<p>Presence Outside and Inside the Staduim</p>
<p>The deal makes Betfred an official partner of the NFL franchise, including the opportunity to set up a sports betting lounge outside of Empower Field at Mile High, the stadium where the Broncos play their games, as well as stadium signage and media marketing opportunities. Partnering with the football team from Denver provides the necessary boost Betfred is looking for upon its entry into the Colorado sports betting market.</p>
<p>“We knew we needed to be aggressive upon entering the Colorado market with a Vegas-quality sportsbook and a sponsorship agreement with the Denver Broncos, one of the premier franchises in US sports. We look forward to launching our online platform right before football season,” Bryan Bennett, COO, Betfred USA Sports</p>
<p>A day after the announcement, Betfred is set to open up its retail sports book inside the Saratoga Casino in Black Hawk, marking its entry into the third state. In January, the sports betting operator announced its presence in Iowa by launching a state-of-the-art sports book within the Grand Falls Casino in Larchwood.</p>
<p>Betfred Looking to Expand</p>
<p>The aggressive 2020 expansion strategy of the European retail and mobile sports book operator includes entry into the Pennsylvania market, where Betfred partnered with Wind Creek Casino &amp; Resort in Bethlehem, besides the launch of operations in Iowa and the upcoming entry into Colorado.</p>
<p>“We’re extremely proud of our partnership with Saratoga and are excited to be part of the rich gaming community in Black Hawk.” Bryan Bennett, COO, Betfred USA Sports</p>
<p>Betfred means decades of experience, both in retail and online sports betting, and the partnership deal will further deliver on Saratoga’s promise to provide premium guest service levels, Vice President of Business Development for Saratoga Casino Black Hawk Sam Gerrity outlined.</p>
<p>Saratoga Casino Re-Opens</p>
<p>The opening of the physical sports book marks the re-opening of the casino after the period of closure due to the ongoing health crisis. The relatively new presence of Betfred into the state did not deter the Broncos from partnering with it, seeing it as the perfect means for further engagement with their fan base.</p>
<p>“Betfred’s combination of a physical sportsbook at Saratoga Casino, extensive retail offerings in Europe and an upcoming online offering make them an organization we think Broncos fans will enjoy engaging with.” Mac Freeman, Chief Commercial Officer, Denver Broncos</p>
<p>The deal with Betfred marks the second official partnership between a sports book provider and the NFL franchise, as on Monday FanDuel signed a deal with the Broncos to become its official sports betting and daily fantasy football partner.</p>
