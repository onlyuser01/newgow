<p>Pragmatic Play’s iconic globetrotter who has explored a plethora of ancient civilizations over the years, John Hunter, is back and ready for more exciting action on the reels.</p>
<p>Continuing the mesmerizing saga of the leading content supplier, the fresh release is an exciting follow-up to the trip to Egypt that the beloved archaeological adventurer embarked on in the first title of the franchise.</p>
<p>The new Megaways version of the slot carries players to the Ancient Egypt plains packed with lush vegetation where they can expect to come across a plethora of familiar symbols ranging from pharaohs and sphinxes.</p>

<p>Besides the expanded and dynamic grid counting six reels that are constantly changing throughout the game, players will also have a fun time discovering as many as 117,649 ways to win, by virtue of the Megaways mechanic.</p>
<p>Since this is a unique feature in the series, it is likely to draw all the attention while making the game more exciting than ever for fans of the franchise.</p>
<p>As explained by Irina Cornides, Pragmatic Play’s chief operating officer, the launch of the ninth installment in the John Hunter franchise “closely follows the milestone launch” of the studio’s 10th Big Bass slot release. This once again comes to prove the true degree of popularity recorded by these smash titles underpinned by the studio’s desire to keep generating “player favorite experiences time and time again.”</p>
<p>Cornides further described the new Megaways variant of the saga as “another iconic return by our famed explorer”, considering it would resonate with passionate fans of the series searching for excellent gameplay combined with the massive power of Megaways.</p>
<p>To score a win, players need to land adjacent symbol combinations starting with the utmost left reel. Thanks to the special expanding symbol feature, symbols are randomly selected during any spin taking place in the base game.</p>
<p>The respective symbols will then expand and completely cover all positions corresponding to their reels, where they will pay from any position and give players more winning opportunities.</p>
<p>The Free Spins round can be engaged when landing at least three Scatter symbols during any spin. Players receive a minimum of 10 free games. During the same round, players are also guaranteed a special expanding symbol. The respective symbol will be in play for all free spins during the same bonus feature.</p>
<p>Last week, the company announced it would inject its Live Casino content into 888’s William Hill after scoring a similar deal with Bally’s Interactive at the end of August.</p>
