<p>The Curious Machine Review</p>
<p>The Curious Machine is a steampunk slot game that will have you spin the reels in the futuristic present… or past! The game is not really keen on setting the time period per se, but what it does well is to create an immersive theme that inspires players to have a go at one of what is Betsoft’s most rewarding slot machines of all time.</p>
<p>Start with the Return to Player rate (RTP) for example, which is set at the tempting 97.50% and offers a 22.27% hit rate, a bit on the low side when it comes to how often you can expect the payout to occur. Yet, when it does, players definitely have something to look forward to.</p>
<p>With medium volatility, plenty of steampunk-powered symbols, a time travel feature, payouts, and so much more all in one neat metallurgic package.</p>
<p>The Curious Machine Theme and Setting: Steampunk, Dinosaurs, and a Wacky Future</p>
<p>It’s the future – and then again it is not! A T-rex roams the lush jungle-esque-looking surroundings, and a sci-fi city, blueprint, and pressure gauge symbols appear across the reels as players try to find their bearings in this whimsical setting.</p>
<p>There is a mustachioed general-looking character and a slick inventor with goggles pulled back on his head. A robot looking at you with confusion, and an operating console that does all sorts of things. This is just a taste of what you will get playing The Curious Machine, the game that uses rich 3D graphics and pacey music, along with neat gameplay elements designed to test how willing you are to go in pursuit of extra winnings.</p>
<p>The graphics are slightly dated but only just, and you get a very cool feel of where the entire action is headed, never mind the few odd designer decisions that feature a strikingly out-of-place, and yet fun and enticing. Does the T-Rex serve any specific gameplay purpose? Let’s find out!</p>
<p>The Curious Machine Game Symbols and Payouts</p>
<p>The paytable at Curious Machine is excellent, easy to follow, and let’s face it – at 97.50% RTP – quite rewarding. Players will have a bunch of symbols both high and low-paying ones to choose from and cheer for on the reels.</p>
<p>All symbols will pay from left to right, with the high-paying ones offering 45 for the inventor with the goggles on for 5 symbols, followed by 18 for the 5 robots, and the same amount for the mustachioed general-looking type.</p>
<p>There is also the pressure gauge, command console, a view of the sci-city, and the blueprints all of which reward values from 9 to 18. The symbols get a little more complex, of course, as there is a Wild Vortex and the T-Rex symbol which is free spins.</p>
<p>Players also get to enjoy the Double Up feature and even the opportunity to Travel Through time and escape the general. We will cover the bonus features a little later, though! For now, it suffices to say that you have plenty of awesome gameplay elements to enjoy across the board that will make the whole experience worth your while.</p>
<p>Sounds and Animations: Steampunk and Great Tunes</p>
<p>Betsoft is easily one of the best software developers when it comes to building excellent sounds and visuals. Now, the game is slightly dated in terms of both, as it was released in 2015, but being the cutting-edge title it was back then, it still stands the test of time effortlessly. We enjoy the overall feel and look of the game, which have been created to ensure that you get maximum value.</p>
<p>The Curious Machine Gameplay: Easy Now, the Future Calls You</p>
<p>The Curious Machine plays quite easily as a matter of fact, owing to Betsoft’s commitment to building games that are intuitive, easy to get into and even faster to play. Players will be able to adjust the bet size as they see fit and bet anything from $0.01 to $60. There is an autoplay feature that will allow you to pre-load dozens of rounds, and you can further switch the quick spin feature to give your gameplay a pacier feel.</p>
<p>The Curious Machine Features: Travel Through Time and Double Down on Winning</p>
<p>The Curious Machine will bring a ton of excellent features that will only add to the gameplay and make it more fun to experience, no matter whether you want to high roll or play casually on a small budget. Here are some of the things you can expect to find in the slot.</p>
<p>Free Spins : A Free Spins symbol will trigger when you hit enough T-Rex symbols. Don’t ask us why the T-Rex roams freely across the level, it just does. There are also multipliers applicable to the whole thing, so you get to enjoy a rather fun and rewarding experience from start to finish.</p>
