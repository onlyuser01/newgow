<p>Milwaukee Bucks vs Los Angeles Lakers is arguably the biggest game of the week. It’s taking place at Crypto.com Arena in LA on Thursday, February 9, 2023</p>
<p>The Milwaukee Bucks are in sensational form right now; the Los Angeles Lakers are not. But this doesn’t have to mean anything, considering how much star power the Lakers have on the roster. They got LeBron James, for one, whom many consider the GOAT of the sport. But then again, the Bucks have Giannis Antetokounmpo, who’s been literally unstoppable this season.</p>
<p>When, Where, and How to Watch?</p>
<p>Place : Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles, California</p>

<p>Giannis Looking for Another Impressive Performance</p>
<p>The Milwaukee Bucks are second in the Eastern Conference with a 37-17 record (0.685) with eight wins in a row. Their winning run started as soon as their talisman Giannis Antetokounmpo returned from a knee injury.</p>
<p>Over his last 5 games, Giannis is averaging 42.4 PPG and 15.2 RPG.</p>

<p>Since his comeback, Giannis has scored a total of 300 points, which accounts for 37.5 points per game on average. He’s also made 116 rebounds in eight games (14.5 per game), and 43 assists (5.37 per game).</p>
<p>Giannis has been brilliant, but his teammates haven’t. At least not as much, which explains why some of their recent wins happened by only a couple of points. For instance, they defeated the Los Angeles Clippers by only one point last week.</p>
<p>LeBron James Has Just Broken the NBA All-Time Scoring Record</p>
<p>After scoring 36 points on Tuesday evening, LeBron James broke the all-time scoring record set back in 1989 by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. The 38-year-old legend did great in that game, but it wasn’t enough for his team to avoid another loss. The Lakers lost to the Oklahoma City Thunder 133-130.</p>

<p>It was their second-straight loss, as well as their 30th of the season. As a result, they’re now 25-30 (0.455), meaning that their chance of making the playoffs doesn’t look that great. Of course, there’s still plenty of time left, but they need to act ASAP.</p>
<p>The good news for the Lakers is that they don’t have any major injuries at the moment, which used to be their biggest problem earlier in the 2022-23 season.</p>
<p>Milwaukee Bucks vs Los Angeles Lakers Prediction</p>
<p>LeBron and the Lakers love playing big games, and the one against the Bucks sure belongs to that category. Although we don’t have any doubt Giannis is going to wreak havoc on the Lakers, we don’t think it’s going to be enough for the Bucks to win in California.</p>
<p>Pick: Los Angeles Lakers to win</p>
