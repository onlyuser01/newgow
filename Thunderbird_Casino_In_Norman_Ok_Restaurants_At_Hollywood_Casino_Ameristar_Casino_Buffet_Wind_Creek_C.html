    <h1>Thunderbird Casino In Norman Ok Restaurants At Hollywood Casino Ameristar Casino Buffet Wind Creek C</h1>

<p>After announcing a partnership with RPM Gaming for the launch of a no-risk sportsbook at the beginning of July, leading PAM software developer and sportsbook ATLAS IAC has fresh news on the topic. The company is finally ready to mark the debut of its new and exciting product at G2E Asia, the main premier iGaming and sports betting summit in Asia. Atlas IAC will be present at the Marina Bay Sands Singapore between August 24 and August 26.</p>
<p>Why G2E Asia?</p>
<p>The G2E Asia was chosen by the company that employs gaming industry pros with over a century of experience for its ability to reunite “over 95% of all Asian operators.” According to Richard Thorp, ATLAS-IAC’s strategic advisor, and RPM Gaming’s director, all major “industry players” will be present at the same event, discovering fresh industry trends while improving their networking. Thorp described G2E as the “must-make marketplace for Asia’s flourishing sports betting and iGaming sector”, expressing delight for his return there. It would only make sense for ATLAS to choose this location to introduce its state-of-the-art automated trading tools and entirely automated Customer Relationship Management system that can reunite all communication and customer marketing activities under the same rooftop.</p>
<p>The new product will enable operators to group their customers in profiled segments relying on the activity of their platforms, customers’ wagering behaviors, a series of personal traits, and the regularity at which they make their deposits.</p>
<p>ATLAS-IAC will, therefore, take advantage of the gathering of impressive forces at the G2E Asia to introduce its “unrivaled customized platform solutions” along with its premier automation technology. Asian operators will get to test tailored solutions including localized sports betting solutions, data feed options, and skill and casino games. Anyone interested in learning more about the perks of the company’s fresh product can visit Stand B812 where they will be greeted by the team.</p>
<p>iFrame Integration</p>
<p>The same next-gen sportsbook option can be easily integrated as an iFrame on any structure with zero risks while running off one-of-a-kind pricing models. This will, in turn, enable its users to take advantage of complex and fully reactive in-play odds that will be available up to the very last second of each game. The new sportsbook will be showcased in Asia at perfect timing with the upcoming sporting schedule in the fall, with emphasis on the soccer World Cup.</p>
<p>ATLAS-IAC’s chief executive officer Sergei Efimenko called G2E Asia “a must-attend event”, while also speaking about the “real momentum behind this year’s renewal in Singapore, especially after all the challenges of the pandemic.” Efimenk also talked about the impressive “quality, quantity, and diversity of the delegates” that will be present at the event.</p>
<p>G2E Asia is organized by the American Gaming Association and Reed Exhibitions and it will exclusively take place in Singapore at the local casino resort Marina Bay Sands.</p>
