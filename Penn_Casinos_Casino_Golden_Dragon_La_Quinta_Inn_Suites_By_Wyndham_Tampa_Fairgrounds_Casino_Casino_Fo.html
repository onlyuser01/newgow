<p>Jeffrey - Hello my name is Jeffrey P<strong><em>*</em> My username for this particular Casino Ozwin Casino is Cle</strong>***ay. I have been a loyal customer for the past few months, and have been happy with there bonus's, and deposit process, however come time to withdraw, terrible process. It's almost as if you are a criminal come withdraw time. Mind you I had wagered what was requested, and even went further and played beyond wagering. I was given 3 different withdrawal amounts from 3 different representatives. A 25 dollar free chip (Nothing is Free) after 5 days of playing on it resulted in a withdrawal of $130 dollar's, of which $50.00 was there processing fee, and 15 days later, no deposit in my account. I have been told it could take up to 50 days for my wire deposit into my personal account, of which I provided them every document, and account number, everything, and still nothing. I have mentioned to representatives that I would be writing a review for Ozwin, and it just gets a response of please give us 15 more business days. I have the emails that state the withdrawal was processed on February 10th with there adjustments they made, and also with words of advice, do not tell your Banking Instructions what these charges are for on your Statement, otherwise they will not process your payment. Ozwin has received a lot of deposits from me, and there Representatives on the most part are excellent, but I feel Management, Owners, are greedy, and don't appreciate just how much we as loyal customers, get them there pay check. Withdrawing $180 dollars turned into a $130 dollar still waiting to be deposited, disappointed crime. You would swear I was withdrawing all the money that I deposited, and are they good at receiving your money, and the fees to deposit are crazy high. Good Casino, but don't win to much, because your withdrawal amount, and processing time can take up to 50 days, and that in my opinion is a outright CRIME. I would like my $130 dollar withdrawal immediately, and would not recommend this Casino if you are looking for a quick withdrawal.</p>
