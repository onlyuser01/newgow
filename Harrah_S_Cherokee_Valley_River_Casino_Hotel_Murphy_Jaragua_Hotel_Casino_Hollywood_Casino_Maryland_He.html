<p>Las Vegas Sands Wins Fourth Pennsylvania Satellite Casino Auction, Selects Location Near Ohio Border</p>

<p>Las Vegas Sands could soon have as many gaming floors in Pennsylvania as it does in Nevada.</p>

<p>The parent company to The Venetian and Palazzo won the fourth of 10 satellite casino auctions in Pennsylvania on Wednesday, with the winning bid totaling $9.9 million.</p>
<p>Sands selected a 15-mile radius in Mercer County, which sits in the northwestern part of the state near the Pennsylvania-Ohio border.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania’s 10 Category 1 and 2 license holders are eligible to bid on the Category 4 satellite casinos. The venues were authorized in a massive gaming expansion measure signed into law by Governor Tom Wolf (D) last fall. Each satellite is permitted to house up to 750 slot machines, and 30 table games.</p>
<p>Las Vegas Sands owns Sands Bethlehem in Eastern Pennsylvania. The casino is the second largest revenue generator behind Parx near Philadelphia.</p>
<p>Sands has two business days to pay the full $9.9 million to the Pennsylvania Gaming Control board (PGCB). It then has six months to submit plans for the precise location of the satellite casino.</p>
<p>Bidding Slows</p>
<p>In an effort to help bridge a $2.2 billion budget gap, and a Republican-controlled General Assembly apprehensive to raise taxes, the Pennsylvania legislature signed off on a gambling package that authorizes 10 satellite casinos, online gambling, airport and truck stop gaming terminals, daily fantasy sports, and more.</p>
<p>The gambling measure assumed $100 million in new revenue from the issuance of the satellite permits. But higher than expected initial bids easily eclipsed that figure, with the state collecting $111.4 million during the first three auctions.</p>
<p>Hollywood Casino owner Penn National won the first auction with a $50.1 million offer to reserve York County. Parx Casino took the second round with a $40.1 million bid to secure Westmoreland County. Mount Airy was next with a $21.1 million payment for Lawrence County.</p>
<p>But the bidding war has apparently eased, as the $9.9 million submission from Las Vegas Sands is $40.2 million less than what Penn National anted. During Wednesday’s auction, the PGCB took only two sealed bids, meaning five qualified casino operators chose not to submit an offer.</p>
<p>Location in Question</p>
<p>Las Vegas Sands selecting its 15-mile radius in Mercer County’s Hempfield Township is a bit perplexing, as seemingly more attractive towns remain in the running. Mercer County as a whole is home to just 116,000 people. On the Hempfield Township local government website, “entertainment attractions” include a golf course, VFW, and bowling alley.</p>
<p>Local government officials in Reading, a city in northeast Pennsylvania with roughly 90,000 residents, and over 415,000 in Berks County, is chomping at the bit for a satellite casino.</p>
<p>The city is also about 40 miles from Sands Bethlehem, a region that Las Vegas Sands would presumably like to secure when it comes to maintaining its regional customer base.</p>
<p>Penn National rationalized its $50.1 million bid for York County as “an investment we felt like we had to make to protect a major market area for our casino.” York is 30 miles south of Penn National’s Hollywood Casino.</p>
<p>However, the 15-mile satellite zone centered in Hempfield does lend Sands to build its casino fairly close to Interstate 80, a major artery that travels from New Jersey to San Francisco.</p>
