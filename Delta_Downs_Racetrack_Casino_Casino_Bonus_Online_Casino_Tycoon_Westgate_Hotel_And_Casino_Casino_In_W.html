<p>Amelco has become the one of the first sports betting and platform providers to go live in Ohio, following the state-wide market launch on January 1, 2023</p>
<p>The company has benefited from this expansion by introducing its outstanding and comprehensive sports betting product to the North American market, and Amelco already has strong positions in 12 regulated states.</p>
<p>Amelco Reaps Benefits of Moving Early on the US</p>
<p>Amelco expects two more jurisdictions to be announced before long as well, as the company is looking to significantly expand its reach in the regional and regulated betting market. These launches will focus on Maryland and Massachusetts where the supplier feels confident in the long-term success of its products.</p>
<p>Both states are drawing close to an actual launch date, with Massachusetts set to go live at the end of the month, just in a few daysâ€™ time.</p>
<p>Head of Amelco USA Brandon Walker welcomed the opportunity to see his company gather momentum in the regulated markets in the United States, and bring its unique offer to a vast audience of sports bettors hungry for the best-in-class solutions. Walker added:</p>
<p>We expect excitement to only increase, and we are really interested to see what the numbers are going to look like over the course of the next few months. In terms of our product, no one-offers a full service, end-to-end solution like we do at Amelco. Head of Amelco USA Brandon Walker</p>
<p>Amelco has been looking to innovate its product offer and deliver more compelling and stronger products across the board. A partnership with BetSwap was signed in a bid to boost secondary market engagement in the United States.</p>
<p>Amelco has also been looking beyond the North American market and launching with LulaBet in South Africa. The company continues to develop its momentum in new markets with a strong focus on delivering impeccable overall products.</p>
