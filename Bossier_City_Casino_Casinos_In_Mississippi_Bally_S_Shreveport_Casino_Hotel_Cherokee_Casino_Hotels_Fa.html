<p>PointsBet has entered into a partnership with Women in Sports Tech (WiST), a not-for-profit organization that champions women’s participation in sports, technology, and innovation. As a result, PointsBet will enable the organization to use the career opportunities and technological know-how available to PointsBet to further advance women’s careers in the segment.</p>
<p>Empowering Women in Sports, Gambling and Tech</p>
<p>PointsBet will focus on helping WiST to improve women’s lives on all career levels. The duo will organize fireside chats and panels with various industry leaders, offer summer internships, host career fairs for middle and high schools, and more as part of this initiative. PointsBet is just one of the many big companies to be joining the push.</p>
<p>There are more than 23 companies that have found WiST’s cause worthwhile, with industry giants such as Comcast NBCUniversal Sports Tech Accelerator, IBM Sports, Nike, and others pooling their efforts to introduce more opportunities for women. Commenting on this initiative, PointsBet chief of people Rachelle Carpenter said:</p>
<p>“As a rapidly growing sports technology business ourselves, we at PointsBet feel it is critically important to welcome more women into this industry and ensure a more inclusive environment for women interested in pursuing a career in sports tech.” PointsBet chief of people Rachelle Carpenter</p>
<p>PointsBet CEO Johnny Aitken joined and argued that it was part of the company’s mission to ensure that women feel empowered and contribute to what is a lucrative industry. He continued:</p>
<p>“As we continue to build upon our diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts, our partnership with WiST will be a very important piece of that puzzle.” PointsBet CEO Johnny Aitken</p>
<p>Women Are Already Power Brokers in the Industry</p>
<p>There is no doubt that women are some of the most capable power brokers in the iGaming and sports betting industry. Denise Coates, the founder of Bet365, has been one of the wealthiest women and biggest taxpayers in the United Kingdom. Her betting empire has allowed her to pay herself a significant and well-deserved check.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, other companies such as Kindred Group have been touted as some of the most inclusive workplaces in Europe. As the North American market opens up to sports betting and iGaming, women will seek to establish themselves in those emerging companies.</p>
<p>With the mass legalization of gambling, the focus has been on women as professionals and consumers. A new study in the United Kingdom found out that women tend to gamble a lot more based on the time of the year. As a response to these findings, GambleAware has launched a campaign to help women stay away from gambling-related harm.</p>
