<p>Provider of artificial intelligence (AI)-powered predictive sports data and analytics Quarter4 announced Thursday it has agreed to partner with fintech startup DraftFuel and power its content engine for the upcoming NFL Season.</p>
<p>‘Extra Boost of Confidence and Knowledge’</p>
<p>The agreement between Quarter4 and DraftFuel will see the provider’s predictions and data displayed in the fintech’s app next to lines and odds provided by various sportsbook partners to facilitate wagering for DraftFuel users with DraftFuel Discover Prepaid Cards.</p>
<p>“When we started DraftFuel, we wanted to create an environment where bettors of any skill and frequency can enjoy guilt-free gaming. Adding Quarter4’s unbiased predictions will give our users an extra boost of confidence and knowledge in addition to simplifying terminology for our users.” Alex Cullingford, Co-Founder, DraftFuel</p>
<p>Acting as a dedicated gaming fund since its launch at the end of last year, DraftFuel enables funds accumulation by either collecting everyday transactions spare change, or by automatic transfers of a preset percentage of a user’s bank deposit, or both, mitigating risks of excessive gambling by limiting play with “true discretionary funds” only.</p>
<p>“Progressive tech attracts progressive tech and we couldn’t be happier about the match that Quarter4 and DraftFuel make. Armed with Quarter4’s data, our users will be empowered to make smart, responsible decisions when betting.” Tom Mangan, Co-Folunder, DraftFuel</p>
<p>‘New Heightened Overall Betting Experience’</p>
<p>Commenting on the agreement, Danijela Covic, chief sales officer at Quarter4, outlined that DraftFuel is seeking to empower casual bettors with new opportunities to fund their wagers, and Quarter4’s predictive analytics with its sharpness, intuitiveness and simplicity, will bring the additional confidence to make sure they stay on the DraftFuel’s platform and wager via the platform’s sports betting partners.</p>
<p>Covic also outlined that the partnership is expected to add value within a subspace of the market which so far has been largely ignored by engagement efforts by empowering casual bettors with “advanced analytics, elevated content and a new heightened overall betting experience.”</p>
<p>Quarter4, which recently expanded its data and predictive offerings to cover the WNBA, uses predictions that are automatically generated by a deep learning neural network to support sportsbooks, online casino games and daily fantasy operators to engage with their customers by offering them betting content suitable as for the newbies, so for the seasoned veterans.</p>
<p>DraftFuel became the latest partner of the supplier of AI-powered data analytics which can produce up to 2 million predictions per day, being updated at least every 15 minutes, following in the footsteps of Parleh Media Group, which hired Quarter4’s services for one year in February.</p>
