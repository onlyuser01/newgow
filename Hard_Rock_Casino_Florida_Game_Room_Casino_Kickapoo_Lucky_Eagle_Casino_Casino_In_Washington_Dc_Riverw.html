    <h1>Hard Rock Casino Florida Game Room Casino Kickapoo Lucky Eagle Casino Casino In Washington Dc Riverw</h1>

<p>I understand you so far, but it was booked from my checking account anyway! I sent you my bank statement for the complete statement as a pdf from July, don't you see that?!?! Which bank is that where I can get in touch with them?! If it's not successful, they have to credit it back to my checking account... That's what it's all about! On the two days it is about, the error message also came up, when I checked online banking, it was booked! They talk about the screenshots all the time, look closely at the full July excerpt pdf I turned to them. When I used the screenshots back then no one cared and wanted the full July but apparently you can't research... I feel like I'm talking to a brick wall! Your vip responsible I have the feeling that there are different employees who don't quite know what the left and right hand is doing. It's not my concern that I want any credits or anything else from you... As mentioned, which bank is it that processes the whole thing so that I can get in touch with this bank.</p>
<p>In the upper 4 screenshots from July 24th and July 31st, 200 euros have been booked and also credited to my player account and the other 200 euros have been debited again but not credited to my player account! I also ask the Guru Team, what am I describing wrong here? Do you understand the problem I am trying to describe?!?</p>
