    <h1>Wendover Nevada Casinos Casino Live Kudos Casino Login Casino Days Paypal Casinos Starda Casino The</h1>

<p>I am writing about Starda casinos that delayed the payment according to the 8.24 rule, I had a birthday on 13.06, in honor of him the casino gave me 3500r with a 40x wager, as soon as I received the money, I went into the absolutely random slot, knocked out a 100r bonus which gave 38k, I don’t see anything suspicious here (I’ll explain why I’m writing further), after that I successfully played the wager, in different slots and not even in 1, and put it on the output on 13.06 12:32 Moscow time after the withdrawal I wrote in tp on the site, thank you all, and then that they made my dr better, and asked about the conclusion, to which they answered that everything is high and wait a maximum of 4 hours, after 4 hours, I wrote again when I did not receive a conclusion, and they asked me for a NEW VIDEO WITH PASSPORT, and also so that I received a call from a casino employee, I did what they asked, in the call they even asked me the domain of the site, and who issued my passport, but I was more shocked that they asked for the last 5 letters of the crypto wallet, I canceled the withdrawal at about 17 and went to play - raised 48k and I put it on the conclusion again, I’m waiting), I didn’t wait, about 19 I canceled the withdrawal again and raised 95k, after which the whole sitation began, with a check, etc., I wrote in tp about 30 times, all that answered me the same text, below are all the screenshots (I wrote the entire text on 06/18 at about 00:00, on the morning of 06/18 at 10:30 I woke up and my account was blocked at all when I write in tp they write, write to the casino manager in tg, I previously collaborated with them but it was 3 months back and not as unrelated)</p>
