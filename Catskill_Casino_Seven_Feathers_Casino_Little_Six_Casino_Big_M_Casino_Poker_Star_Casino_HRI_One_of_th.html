<p>One of the most globally recognized brands in the world, Hard Rock International (HRI), once again entered Forbes’ list of America’s Best Employers for Women.</p>
<p>Hard Rock Is among the Best Employers for Women for the Fifth Time</p>
<p>This year marks HRI’s fifth entry of the prestigious list. The company entered the category Travel &amp; Leisure. To compile the annual list, Forbes joined forces with Statista, the leading global market research company. Overall, more than 60,000 Americans working at businesses with at least 1,000 employees were surveyed for the recent list. This enabled the research company to identify the companies which are “most dedicated to diversity, equity and inclusion.”</p>
<p>“For the fifth consecutive year, Hard Rock is honored for empowering women and creating a diverse working environment on the prestigious annual list,” reads a statement released by Hard Rock International</p>
<p>Globally, HRI has 265 locations in 70 countries that include licensed, owned or managed Live Performance Venues, Cafes and Rock Shops. Currently, the company has more than 45,000 employees within hotels, casinos and corporate-owned café locations around the world.</p>
<p>The Company Increases the Number of Women in Leadership Positions</p>
<p>It was back in 2016 when HRI first launched its Women in Leadership program. The innovative program sought to mentor, empower and help women grow within their careers. Since the launch of the program, more than 1,000 HRI female team members have attended a brand-hosted educational conference or participated in the mentorship program.</p>
<p>According to HRI, the company has been continuously expanding its female leadership year-over-year, regardless of the ongoing pandemic. The company pointed out that vice president positions represented by women have grown more than 26%. HRI added that female representation for managers and directors grew by 31%. Moreover, the company revealed that in the last year “female representation at the executive committee level has doubled, and the majority of these appointments are women of color.”</p>
<p>“It is with great pride that Hard Rock continues to be recognized among the top companies actively making strides in diversity, equity and inclusion and be featured as a best employer for women.” Tracy Bradford, president of Seminole Hard Rock Support Services and co-founder of Seminole and Hard Rock Women in Leadership internal mentoring program</p>
<p>The president of Seminole Hard Rock Support Services, Tracy Bradford, acknowledged that the company is proud to be recognized as a leader in the industry when it comes to diversity, equity and inclusion. Additionally, she said that HRI is proud to be on the prestigious list as one of the best employers for women. In conclusion, she said: “At Hard Rock, our mottos: All Is One and Love All, Serve All inspire us to champion our unique differences and celebrate our employees at all levels of the business with effective policies, programs and practices.”</p>
