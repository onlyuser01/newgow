<p>Online sports betting and gaming operator Betway continued to expand its reach in the world of professional sport after a fresh deal with another franchise from the NBA, the Dallas Mavericks.</p>
<p>Strengthening NBA Presence</p>
<p>The new multi-year partnership between Betway and the Dallas Mavericks named the leading online global gaming brand as the Official and Exclusive Free-to-Play Partner of the professional basketball team and made the Mavericks the 6th NBA franchise to team with the sports betting and iGaming brand.</p>
<p>Continuing the growth of the Betway brand in the US, we’re delighted to be partnering with the Dallas Mavericks. The Mavs are a globally recognized team that will help promote the Betway name around the world.” Anthony Werkman, CEO, Betway</p>
<p>“We are excited to be showcased to their amazing fanbase whose loyal support helped the Mavs achieve the outstanding record for the longest run of sold-out games in major league sports,” Betway CEO Anthony Werkman concluded.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the deal with Dallas Mavericks, Betway gained lucrative branding rights and will have its logo promoted around the court at American Airlines Center.</p>
<p>Betway has been a phenomenal partner from the beginning, working with us to navigate this industry in a state where there are still many uncertainties yet potential for massive growth. We look forward to providing tremendous value to both Betway and our fans.” Ryan Mackey, SVP of Corporate Sponsorships, Dallas Mavericks</p>
<p>The partnership with the NBA franchise from Texas extended Betway’s reach in the professional basket league, making the Mavericks the 6th team to promote the gaming brand, following previous deals with Golden State Warriors, LA Clippers, Cleveland Cavaliers, Chicago Bulls and the Brooklyn Nets.</p>
<p>Strong Presence in Other Sports</p>
<p>Outside of basketball, Betway continues with its push to establish itself as one of the most recognized brands in sports, signing sponsorship deals with organizations across a number of sports, including tennis, soccer, esports, rugby and others.</p>
<p>The brand’s most recent deal was the partnership to become the official betting promoter of the upcoming Stockholm Open in November. Previously, Betway teamed with the European Open of the ATP TOUR, the Nordea Open in Sweden and the Hamburg Open, the Noventi Open and the Mercedes Cup in Germany, as well as the Madrid and the Miami Open.</p>
