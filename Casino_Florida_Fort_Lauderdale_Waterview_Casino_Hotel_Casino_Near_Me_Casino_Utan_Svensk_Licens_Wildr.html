<p>The Spanish casino game developer MGA Games continues to expand around the globe. Following a recent partnership deal with Betway, MGA games will be available for Mexican players visiting Betway’s platform. Betway.mx is actually the most popular platform for casino games in Mexico. This makes MGA’s games a fine addition to an already proven market leader.</p>
<p>Under the agreement, players of Betway.mx will receive access to some of the most popular and successful titles by MGA Games. Currently it is known that titles from MGA Games’ Hyperrealism Series such as Gold Mermaid by Renata González, GT World Challenge by Andy Soucek and Josef Ajram’s Epic Broker will be available to Mexican players as a part of the recent deal. In addition, a large variety of mobile games will also be integrated in Betway.mx. Some of the more popular titles are Bingo Mariachis, Calaca Party Bingo, Bingo Zeus and Circus and many more.</p>
<p>MGA Games Is Focused on Growth and Success</p>
<p>MGA Games CEO, Joan Sanahuja commented on the subject: “MGA Games feels honoured that such a large operator as Betway Mexico vouched for our game productions and decided to include them in their casino games catalogue.” He continued by saying that a “dazzling” number of fresh launches in Latin America was achieved mainly because the top shelf content that the MGA waas offering. Sanahuja did not miss to say that their success was also pushed by the incredible post-sales as well as latest gaming technologies that the company is offering.</p>
<p>Betway CEO, Anthony Werkman also had to say something about the deal: “MGA Games have a proven track record, and we are especially delighted to work with them in Mexico. Their suite of games is one of the most innovative in the market, and we have every confidence MGA Games’ offering will be hugely popular with our players in Latin America.”</p>
<p>This current move by MGA Games is showing just how focused the company is on growth, despite the global events surrounding the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Only recently, in April, MGA Games signed another key partnership. This was the team-up with the Chilean LatamWin. Looking back to 2019, MGA also struck another key partnership in the South American region when the company teamed up with Codere Colombia.</p>
