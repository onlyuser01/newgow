<p>The agreement with JOI Gaming is set to solidify Red Rake Gaming's presence as a B2B casino content provider in the Netherlands</p>
<p>Provider of casino content Red Rake Gaming announced today a new partnership in the Netherlands, teaming up with JOI Gaming to solidify its foothold in the country.</p>
<p>‘Experience, Love and Attention to Detail’</p>
<p>The agreement with JOI Gaming, a brand that is expected to launch across JACKS.NL later this month, will see a diverse selection of Red Rake Gaming’s localized games made available to online casino players in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>Commenting on the new business partnership, JOI Gaming’s head of Gaming and Retention, Sjoerd Kranz, hailed the quality of gaming content provided by Red Rake Gaming, delighted to have the opportunity to offer its games to players in the Dutch market.</p>
<p>“The experience, love and attention to detail the Red Rake team has put into their games is showing and converting into an optimal playing experience,” Kranz said, believing that the availability of Red Rake Gaming titles on JACKS.NL will further strengthen the website’s portfolio and “create a strong extension to the product offering” of the platform.</p>
<p>Feature-Rich, Engaging Titles</p>
<p>The selection of games offered across JACKS.NL will include the provider’s record-breaking title, Super 25 Stars, an action-packed slot game combining feature games and bonus rounds from all preceding games in the Super series that have been deployed across numerous casino and arcade markets and well received by players.</p>
<p>We could not be more thrilled to partner with JACKS.NL, who are a dominating force in the Dutch market thanks to their player-first approach and delivery of the best service to their players. Nick Barr, MD, Red Rake Gaming Malta</p>
<p>Barr is confident that the new casino content will contribute to JACKS.NL’s continued growth.</p>
<p>Lady Forest, a game that gives players a million ways to win, Guardian of Ra, 2 Kings of Africa, and Medusa Hunt will be the other popular titles that the casino content supplier will provide under the agreement to enrich the product offering at JACKS.NL.</p>
<p>The partnership with JOI Gaming is the latest for Red Rake Gaming as the casino content supplier is looking to expand its presence in Europe and globally, helping operators entice players with feature-rich and engaging games.</p>
<p>Last month, Red Rake Gaming added to its roster of B2B gaming partners PokerStars after an agreement to power the PokerStars Casino platform across multiple European regulated markets such as Spain, Italy, Romania, and the UK, with its popular titles, including the Super slot series and the player-favorite genre, 1 million ways to win.</p>
