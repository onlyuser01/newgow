    <h1>Planet Hollywood Las Vegas Hotel And Casino Treasure Island Casino Minneapolis Casinos On The Strip</h1>

<p>SoftGamings has received regulatory approval from the Romanian gambling commission, ONJN, to launch its casino and sports betting solutions in the market. This means that SoftGamings products and solutions can appear on any operators that are licensed and can legally offer their brands in the country.</p>
<p>SoftGamings Crowns Its Efforts with Success</p>
<p>Commenting on this new license, SoftGamings director of partnerships Anna Lalina welcomed the chance for the company to establish itself in yet another regulated market and drive forays into a new region:</p>
<p>We are steadily pushing forward towards new regulated markets and gaining a foothold in new regions, and the ONJN license we received is another testament to that fact. SoftGamings director of partnerships Anna Lalina</p>
<p>This license agreement followed years of hard work, Lalina noted and said that the company has expended significant effort and time to make sure that it can contribute to the Romanian iGaming market and in fact improve it. SoftGamings has worked hard to ensure that it understands the needs of local operators and the local industry and is looking to help operators distinguish themselves from rivals.</p>
<p>“We are excited for all the new partnerships and projects that are bound to come out from this new milestone for the company,” Lalina concluded. The new supplier license will allow SoftGamings to grow its geographical reach and consolidate its presence in the European market.</p>
<p>The company’s casino platform already boasts more than 200 game suppliers under a single integration, giving an immediate boost to any brand that is building from the ground up with SoftGamings. SoftGamings works with a number of established operators, such as Parimatch, Novibet, Favbet, and more.</p>
<p>SoftGamings also holds more than 11 supplier licenses adding the latest ONJN permit to B2B permits issued by the Isle of Man, the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario, the Malta Gaming Authority, and others.</p>
