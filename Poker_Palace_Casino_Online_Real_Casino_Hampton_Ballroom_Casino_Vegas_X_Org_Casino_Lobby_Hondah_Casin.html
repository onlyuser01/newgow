<p>After being a part of the company for nearly two decades, Smith confirmed its plans to transition from her CEO role to an advisory role</p>
<p>Famous as a provider that delivers unique alternatives to bookmakers, Pinnacle, formerly known as Pinnacle Sports, is a company with a rich history within the betting vertical. It was established back in 1998 and has grown significantly since then, by delivering the best odds, betting limits and offering innovative solutions.</p>
<p>Paris Smith, a betting and gaming industry veteran with decades of experience, first joined Pinnacle back in 2006. Now, after 17 years with the company, she confirmed Monday that she will transition from the role of CEO to an advisory role with the company. Smith explained that this transition will allow her to exit the busy day-to-day role of CEO while still supporting the company and its ongoing growth strategy.</p>
<p>Pinnacle’s new advisor explained that the company has already started a search for a new CEO. Smith thanked Pinnacle’s team and acknowledged that they have become friends and family. She spoke about the unique culture, dedication and friendliness of Pinnacle’s team that makes it a “special company.”</p>
<p>“After an incredible 17 years with Pinnacle, I am making a change and will be stepping away from the intense day-to-day requirements of the CEO role to transition into an advisory role with Pinnacle,“ wrote Paris Smith in a post released via LinkedIn</p>
<p>Exploring New Opportunities</p>
<p>According to Smith, her transition to an advisory role with Pinnacle will enable her to explore new opportunities as well as projects along with Pinnacle’s owner, Magnus Hedman. Still, she explained that in her new role, she will remain “close to the strategy and support of the beloved Pinnacle team.”</p>
<p>“I hope I have created a lasting legacy in my time as Pinnacle’s CEO, as I have always said it is an honor to have the privilege to lead such an incredible brand and organization. The confidence that has been given to me is greatly appreciated,“ added Smith</p>
<p>Within the recently released statement, Smith acknowledged the growth Pinnacle has seen over the last two decades. Finally, she explained that while the company is in good hands, the new transition allows her to move into the next phase of her career.</p>
<p>Recently, Pinnacle continued the positive momentum it gained within the esports vertical via a multi-year partnership with GRID. Announced back in February, the deal expanded the collaboration between the duo.</p>
