    <h1>Victory Casino Cruises Port Canaveral Hollywood Casino Gulf Coast Fire Keeper Casino Casino In South</h1>

<p>The Nevada Gaming Commission has voted and approved Legends Bay Casino in Sparks, which comes after 15 years of toing-and-froing between authorities and the properties, and not least some economic challenges. The approval was welcomed by the owners who now expect the Legends Bay Casino, located in the Sparks Marina casino project, to become a success moving forward.</p>
<p>Olympia Gaming Readies to Launch Legends Bay Casino</p>
<p>Olympia Gaming regional president Court Cardinal welcomed the approval, which comes on the tail of a similar recommendation by the Nevada Gaming Control Board which referred the matter to the Gaming Commission a few weeks back. At this point, though, the opening date is still up in the air.</p>
<p>Cardinal said that the company is looking to open the property in late summer, but there are still some final details that need to be settled first. “We have not committed to a specific date at this point because things can change at the last minute,” Cardinal said.</p>
<p>Olympia Gaming also considers this to be a great cause for relief since the property acquired the Legends Bay Casino in 2006 and embarked on a long, long road to ensuring that the property can actually open. Olympia Gaming sought to invest a hefty penny as early as the deal was announced, with $500 million going down in the development of a casino hotel with up to 1,000 rooms.</p>
<p>The casino talked about introducing other amenities as well, including a lakefront amphitheater. After the initial plans failed though, the property had to recalibrate. The biggest setback had been not regulatory pushback but rather the 2008 mortgage bubble that set the entire world in a long-term recession.</p>
<p>But before Legends Bay can actually open, there will need to be at least 300 new job positions filled. Legends Bay already seems to be attracting enough people already as at least 400 people have applied for the 70 management positions, Cardinal confirmed.</p>
<p>Workers in High Demand at Legends Bay Casino</p>
<p>The property is also launching a dedicated non-management website for hiring members of staff which can apply even now. Plus, the company will further host a job fair on July 12 with the goal of making sure that more people have the opportunity to come on-site and see if they want to work there.</p>
<p>Workers have been in huge demand during the pandemic as many people have been cautious to return. Some, such as workers in New Jersey and Rhode Island have cited indoor smoking on gaming floors as a reason why they don’t want to return.</p>
