    <h1>High 5 Casino Free 10 Casino Game Table Casino Heist Fingerprints Game Room Casino Escanaba Casino B</h1>

<p>News outlets tried to contact the two properties but did not receive a response</p>
<p>At least a few Las Vegas casino resorts have a bed bug problem, the local TV station KLAS-TV reported. Based on information from the Southern Nevada Health District, the report says that bed bugs had been found in two more Las Vegas Strip hotels.</p>
<p>The two properties in question, the report revealed, are none other than The Venetian and Park MGM.</p>
<p>A guest of the former property first reported seeing bed bugs on July 29. They were immediately moved to another room, with The Venetian launching an inspection shortly after. Unfortunately, the resort soon confirmed there were indeed bed bugs in the room.</p>
<p>Following that, a Park MGM guest complained about the bugs on August 14, prompting an inspection that identified the bugs’ presence.</p>
<p>News outlets tried to discuss the matter with representatives from the two properties but the hotels did not respond to the requests. In any case, the bed bug cases come at a really inconvenient time for the properties considering the F1 Las Vegas Grand Prix and upcoming Super Bowl.</p>
<p>Casino.org Advised Visitors to Be Wary</p>
<p>Casino.org, a gambling-focused news outlet, elaborated on this report, saying that KLAS-TV’s report brings the total number of resorts with recent bed bug problems to nine. Over the past two years, bed bugs have been identified at seven other casino resorts, including Circus Circus, Caesars Palace, Planet Hollywood, The Palazzo, Tropicana, MGM Grand, and Sahara.</p>
<p>Previously, Casino.org managed to contact representatives of Tropicana and Sahara who told the news outlet that such cases are very rare and unlikely. Still, the two properties promised that they would always respond immediately to such reports. The former hotel even reassured Casino.org that it would hire a third-party service that would evaluate the situation and recommend a plan for action.</p>
<p>Back then, MGM Resorts also spoke with journalists, promising that appropriate action would be taken when the need arises.</p>
<p>In any case, Casino.org recommended vigilance, advising hotel guests to thoroughly check their rooms for bed bugs when visiting a hotel. As the F1 Las Vegas Grand Prix and the Super Bowl approach, Las Vegas visitors should remain on watch for bugs and file a report to the Southern Nevada Health District if they spot any.</p>
