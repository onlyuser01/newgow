<p>The new slot game from the leading iGaming publisher invites the players on a mythological Nordic adventure with the potential to secure big payouts and enjoy a new GEM</p>
<p>The provider of popular games for the online gambling industry, Yggdrasil, announced the release of a new mythological-themed slot game called Ragnawolves WildEnergy. The leading iGaming publisher unveiled details regarding the latest slot addition on Tuesday. The new slot brings the company’s new Game Engagement Mechanic (GEM).</p>
<p>Yggdrasil’s Ragnawolves WildEnergy slot features a Norse mythology-inspired theme that tells the story of two young pups called Hati and Skoll, “in their cursed chase for chariots of Sól and Máni,” the leading developer reveals.</p>
<p>The new slot stands out with high-quality graphics, as well as sound effects. Players of the new game can benefit from Multiplier Wilds, Countdown Wilds, as well as WildEnergy, Yggdrasil’s latest GEM. The game grants players a chance to secure a win of up to 10,000x their stake, to a staggering maximum win of €1,000,000.</p>

<p>Yggdrasil’s New Slot Delivers Exciting Experiences</p>
<p>Stuart McCarthy, Yggdrasil’s head of product and programs, shared his excitement about the new game. He outlined that the company is thrilled to debut a new GEM in Ragnawolves WildEnergy. Finally, McCarthy said: “As always, we’re confident this mechanic will be well received by our player base and will help this new title onto sustained success in the coming months.”</p>
<p>“We are delighted to debut another fantastic GEM with the release of Ragnawolves WildEnergy.“ Stuart McCarthy, head of product and programs at Yggdrasil</p>
<p>Ragnawolves WildEnergy includes Nordic rune-inspired symbols along with special character symbols of the two wolves, as well as symbols resembling the Goddess of the Sun and God of the Moon. Additional special symbols include the sacred tree, Yggdrasil, along with WildEnergy symbols.</p>
<p>As with many new slot games, Yggdrasil’s slot offers a bet buy option via Golden Bet. The functionality enables the players to pay extra for their wager in exchange for “10x their bet to guarantee a wild symbol on each spin, and players can buy 10 or 13 free spins for 100x or 500x their bet respectively.”</p>
<p>Players that land WildEnergy symbols are granted four lives. According to Yggdrasil, if a “WildEnergy symbol is present on a winning payline, respins will be triggered.” This symbol remains on the reel for life’s duration and decreases with every respin. This effect goes on until the slot player has no more lives left.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if a player lands three or more scatter symbols on the reels, they trigger ten free spins. Wilds can also improve this gameplay by expanding the number of free spins, just like in the base game.</p>
