<p>Connor McDavid has become the first action sports athlete from the National Hockey League (NHL) and the four major US leagues who is going to represent sports betting brands. The athlete, who is the current captain of the Edmonton Oilers, has signed up a partnership with BetMGM, a leading iGaming operator in the United States.</p>
<p>First Active Athlete to Be Ambassador for Betting Brand</p>
<p>McDavid’s high profile among NHL fans will allow BetMGM to better position itself in the sport and reach out to new audiences who may be interested in betting products. This will be facilitated by McDavid’s own likeliness and popularity with hockey fans in the United States and beyond.</p>
<p>BetMGM will use McDavid’s imagery for its upcoming marketing campaigns, work on various promotions, social media content and fan engagement opportunities to build up its profile with hockey fans around the clock. Commenting on this opportunity, McDavid himself expressed his excitement to be part of the BetMGM team, a highly-successful joint venture between Entain and MGM Resorts:</p>
<p>“I am very excited to partner with BetMGM as they continue to shape the future of sports betting. It’s also a real honor to be on the same BetMGM team with star athletes like Wayne Gretzky and Kevin Garnett, both of whom I admire very much.” Edmonton Oilers captain Connor McDavid</p>
<p>The choice of McDavid’s as the company’s brand ambassador is not a chance event either. McDavid has made a name for himself as he became the youngest-ever captain the National Hockey League has had at the age of 19. His performance has been consistently good, which made him one of the most prominent names in the competition.</p>
<p>McDavid has won all the most prominent awards in the hockey league, including the Art Ross Trophy and the Hart Memorial Trophy, along with the NHL’s MVP and Ted Lindsay Award. This is only after six seasons into his career, making McDavid’s one of the best athletes to have ever played hockey.</p>
<p>BetMGM Welcomes Connor McDavid as His Own</p>
<p>Commenting on this development, BetMGM CRO Matt Prevost welcomed the new ambassador and commended him on his career accomplishments:</p>
<p>“The accomplishments that Connor already has earned on the ice is astonishing and we are excited to welcome him to the BetMGM family. We look forward to working together to engage BetMGM players across North America.” BetMGM CRO Matt Prevost</p>
<p>BetMGM has been one of the most prominent sports betting entities in the United States recently. The company joined the NCPG’s Problem Gambling Awareness Month at the beginning of March and the company previously struck a partnership extension with the National Hockey League in February.</p>
