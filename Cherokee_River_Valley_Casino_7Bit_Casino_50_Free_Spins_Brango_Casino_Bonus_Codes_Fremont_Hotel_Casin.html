<p>Vibra Gaming, a supplier of gaming and casino products, has signed a new high-profile partnership covering the Latin American market. As a result, the supplier will be working with Latamwin to power the latter’s iGaming brands, among which Casino Maverick, Divergana, PuntoBet, and others with premium top-tier content.</p>
<p>Vibra Gaming welcomed this new partnership opportunity in an official press release, arguing that securing a new ally in Latin America was an important step forward for the supplier’s regional growth.</p>
<p>The firm has plenty to offer to any potential market, having developed a premier portfolio of titles that are regulation-ready and quick to integrate with the platforms of any products. Vibra Gaming has confirmed that it’s prepared to deploy its variety of leading games, such as Popeye The Sailor and The Phantom. New releases will also be added to this arrangement with Condorito to follow soon after.</p>
<p>Latamwin has already been aggregating games from some of the world’s finest and leading suppliers of iGaming solutions, creating opportunities for its platforms. There are more than 2,000 games that Latamwin-powered casino brands can access, and Vibra Gaming’s own portfolio will be among them moving forward.</p>
<p>This news has been welcomed strongly by executives at both companies. For Vibra Gaming’s party, the company’s CEO, Ramiro Atucha, noted that this strategic alliance would lead to new opportunities and "open doors to new markets" in the region. Atucha expressed optimism that Latamwin is just as likely to benefit from this partnership and what it has to bring to both companies.</p>
<p>Latamwin CEO Wilfred Adelsdorfer was similarly welcoming to the development and said that thanks to this new addition, the company would be able to "improve its value proposal." Adding suppliers to the list has always been an important part of this, the executive noted.</p>
<p>By adding Vibra Gaming’s unique portfolio to Latamwin’s platform the company is able to continue on a quest of improving its proposition and delivering products of increasing quality and security standards. The partnership is good all-around, Adelsdorfer said.</p>
<p>Latin America has been of particular interest to companies. Betsson Group decided to team up with Zé Robertson to popularize the brand in the region and beyond. Playmaker CEO Jordan Gnat spoke to Casino Guru News in April and told us more about his plans to press on with corporate plans in the region as well.</p>
<p>In terms of growth potential, is one of the most important focal points of business interest for gambling companies.</p>
