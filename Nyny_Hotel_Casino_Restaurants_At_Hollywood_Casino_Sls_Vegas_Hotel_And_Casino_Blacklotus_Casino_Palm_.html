<p>SkillOnNet's Spanish-language brand PlayUZU has named Facundo Gómez as its new brand ambassador for the Mexican market</p>
<p>Global provider of white label and full turnkey casino software solutions for the online gaming world has taken one more step toward strengthening the foothold of its licensed Mexican brand PlayUZU.</p>
<p>By deciding to appoint the iconic influencer, host, and TV and social networks ruler Facundo Gómez as its new brand ambassador for the gaming market in Mexico, SkillOnNet will considerably boost its promotional activities in the region.</p>
<p>Last March, PlayUZU marked its presence in Mexico using a massive ad campaign to help it further expand its foothold in the area after making its successful debut in January.</p>
<p>Gómez Has a Social Media Following of Over Three Million</p>
<p>Like any other brand ambassador partnership in the industry, SkillOnNet has selected Gómez for its massive popularity in Mexico, backed by more than three million followers on his social media accounts.</p>
<p>This, according to sales and marketing director Micahel Golembo, has turned him into the ideal ambassador for the PlayUZU brand as the latter continues its impressive growth in the area.</p>
<p>Mexican players searching for secure and innovative ways of gambling online will come across a rich selection of slots and live dealer games via PlayUZU.</p>
<p>At the same time, they will benefit from leading global game providers and the perks of dedicated game analysis tools used to boost players’ safety while guaranteeing “a safe entertainment experience,” according to Gómez himself who commented on the newly inked agreement.</p>
<p>The new brand ambassador who is best known as a popular TV host among Mexican teenagers commented further on his appointment, saying that he was “happy” to join hands with PlayUZU and thus offer Mexican players “different and safe ways to approach online casino games” via a well-protected and reliable gaming platform.</p>
<p>Advertising Responsible Gaming Practices in Mexico</p>
<p>The new brand ambassador deal with Gómez will not only help the Spanish-language brand improve its position in the region but will also help promote responsible gambling practices that all players must obey.</p>
<p>In the context of the Mexican online casino market recording important growth in the past years, such practices are critical to ensure safe and pleasant experiences as well as a significant limitation of potential harms associated with gambling.</p>
<p>In January 2022, PlayUZU launched PlayUZU Nights, a live TV show hosted by Patricia Sánchez and Alvaro Márquez designed to reward PlayUZU’s Spanish players’ commitment, attract new ones, and inform and educate players on responsible gambling practices.</p>
