    <h1>Wind Creek Casino Hon Dah Casino Casino Free Spins Ocean Casino Resorts Atlantic City Lakeside Hotel</h1>

<p>Dear TOPG96,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. Iâ€™m sorry to hear about your problem.</p>
<p>Please understand that KYC is a very important and essential process, during which the casino makes sure that the money is sent to the rightful owner. As they don't have the luxury of being able to physically see all of the players and check their identification and documents, this is the only way gambling establishments are able to complete the verification procedures. None of the serious and licensed casinos take KYC lightly and it might take a few working days to complete this thorough process.</p>
<p>If you have been asked for a selfie with ID documents or a screen behind you, which is nothing unusual, please follow these important guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Do not edit the image in any way</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The photo needs to include your full face, head-on, with no distortions, shadows or reflections of light. If someone takes the photo for you, make sure they take it from up close and include as little background as possible (remember, no cropping is permitted)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you take the photo of your ID, make sure the photo is clear and close enough to read without cropping or editing</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Please forward any relevant communication to petronela.k@casino.guru. Could you please confirm that you have provided all the personal documents required for the verification as soon as possible, without any delay?</p>
<p>I hope we will be able to help you to resolve this issue as soon as possible. Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
