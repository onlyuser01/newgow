    <h1>Palm Casino Resort Horseshu Hotel Casino Online Casino Real Cash Casino Biggest Casino In The World</h1>

<p>Dear ikoric1,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting this complaint. I'm sorry to hear about your negative experience with SpinCity Casino. I have checked the casino's Terms and Conditions, and this is what I found:</p>
<ol>
<li>BONUS TERMS AND CONDITIONS</li>
</ol>
<p>7.7. On the website, there are two balances: real and bonus. The real balance is for the player's deposit funds, which can be withdrawn at any time if the deposit has been wagered twice (deposit turnover is mandatory). The bonus balance consists of received bonuses, which require wagering according to the bonus terms. When a player has both active balances, bets are deducted first from the real balance, and any winnings from such bets are credited to the bonus balance (without increasing the wagering amount). Wagering of both the real and bonus balances only occurs when bets are placed using these balances.</p>
<p>Playing with an active bonus means that you have to complete the wagering requirements to be eligible for withdrawal. In this case, the wagering is 40x bonus amount, i. e. $75 * 40 = $3000</p>
<p>If you decide not to complete the wagering requirements, you may cancel the bonus. But keep in mind, if you do that any winnings you got from the bonus will disappear. Also, because the real money is used up first, if you lost more than $25 from the start of your playing, your balance will end up at zero when you cancel the bonus.</p>
<p>Please let me know if there is anything else I can assist you with. Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards</p>
<p>Veronika</p>
