<p>Sycuan Casino will continue as the presenting partner of the 'Sycuan Endline Suites," 40th Minute Presented by Sycuan broadcast and "Sycuan 25k Halftime Kick Contest."</p>
<p>San Diego Loyal Soccer Club, a professional soccer team from San Diego, California, competing in the USL Championship, announced it has renewed its partnership with Sycuan Casino to keep the casino as its official and exclusive casino partner for the 2023 season.</p>
<p>Fruitful Collaboration Will Continue</p>
<p>The agreement with Sycuan Casino would see the AAA Four Diamond-rated property continue to hold the presenting rights of the all-inclusive premium seating area at Torero Stadium, the “Sycuan Endline Suites,” deliver the 40th Minute Presented by Sycuan broadcast and the all-season Halftime Kick Contest for fans.</p>
<p>Commenting on the contract renewal, Rob Cinelli, general manager at Sycuan Casino, expressed his and the casino team’s excitement to be the exclusive casino partner of the San Diego Loyal SC for a second consecutive year.</p>
<p>“After an exciting 2022 season, we know the team has a lot of great things in store for San Diego fans again this year,” Cinelli said, wishing everyone at the team great success and looking forward “to cheering them throughout the season.”</p>
<p>Located on-field along the east endline of the Torero Stadium, the “Sycuan Endline Suites” offer an up and close personal view of the game action, allowing ticket holders for this premium seating area to enjoy an all-exclusive experience comprising food and beverage and premium parking.</p>
<p>For the Benefit of San Diego Residents</p>
<p>Ricardo Campos, president of the San Diego Loyal SC, also commented on the continuation of the exclusive arrangement with Sycuan Casino the soccer club began in 2022 with a view to elevating the matchday experience for its fans.</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to continue our partnership with Sycuan Casino Resort for the 2023 season,” Campos said, convinced that the collaboration with the casino resort is for the benefit of the fans, the club’s partners and all the people of San Diego.</p>
<p>The 40th Minute Presented by Sycuan programming will also continue to broadcast presented by the casino, offering fans a chance to win a digital sweepstake before each home game of the Sand Diego Loyals, while in cases where the team scores a goal in the 40th minute, one random entrant to the stadium will receive a Sycuan resort prize pack.</p>
<p>Following an exciting debut last season, the “Sycuan 25k Halftime Kick Contest” will be back, offering fans a chance to win $25,000 during select home matches in the 2023 season. Participants in the contest are being randomly selected and try to kick their way to the prize live during the half-time break.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the year, Sycuan Casino partnered with Europe’s leading MMA organization, Cage Warriors, to become the exclusive location for Cage Warriors in the US and bring four events to the casino.</p>
