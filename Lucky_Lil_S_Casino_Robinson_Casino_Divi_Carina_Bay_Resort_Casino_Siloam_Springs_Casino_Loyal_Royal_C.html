    <h1>Lucky Lil S Casino Robinson Casino Divi Carina Bay Resort Casino Siloam Springs Casino Loyal Royal C</h1>

<p>Maybe I'm worrying unnecessarily, but after a lot of research I don't have a good feeling anymore and am constantly being put off by the live chat staff at the casino.</p>
<p>On Thursday, June 17th, I deposited ‚Ç¨ 50 and played my way up to ‚Ç¨ 700 that I wanted to withdraw. But then I decided to continue playing with a stake of ‚Ç¨ 8 per spin. After a few losses, I got the mega profit of almost ‚Ç¨ 12,500 in the game Sword of the Grail. I made withdrawals immediately. Since it is only possible in 2500 ‚Ç¨ steps via Trustly 5 x 2500 ‚Ç¨.</p>
<p>Since Thursday I have been waiting for any reaction from this casino regarding my withdrawal.</p>
<p>In the chat I was informed that I can expect the payout on Saturday. Today again I am told that this case will now be treated with the highest priority and that it will be dealt with "soon".</p>
<p>I played without a bonus, am verified and wonder why it takes so long? In other casinos you often have the money on the same day.</p>
<p>Here at crazeplay only 5000 ‚Ç¨ per week is paid out, so I don't understand the delay.</p>
<p>I am slowly starting to find it very questionable and worrying.</p>
<p>I hope these are unfounded worries üôè</p>
