    <h1>Real Money Casino No Deposit Hard Rock Hotel Casino Hollywood Mandalay Bay Resort Casino Casino Port</h1>

<p>I feel that no one has understood the case, I don't know how else to explain, that an email change was NEVER requested, only a password change was requested, no email change was NEVER requested from the email jotasantos0423@gmail.com, only password, the interest in changing the password is due to suspicion that the account was being stolen, I request a password change and they never send me the email to make said change, I request support and neither does it, and until the day I start the dispute here In casino Guru, I realize that apparently the casino page allowed the login email to be changed to someone other than me, the legitimate owner of the account, that seems irresponsible to me that the casino allows these types of modifications without realizing who is requesting it, therefore the withdrawals that were made after the $9,333,400 that I was able to withdraw were not me, it was the person who stole the account, the NEGLIGENCE for me to be able to recover my account is incredible, but for make an email modification to another person if they did it quickly, the casino should respond for their irresponsibility, it is today's date and they have not restored my account and obviously much less my money, the casino insists on sending 'evidence', but does not make it public, what transcript did the test casino send and from what email was that transcript sent? If I have NEVER written anything on my part to modify, how do I explain to them that THE ACCOUNT WAS STOLEN and the casino allowed another person to enter, modify data and steal the rest of my money, I ONLY MANAGED TO WITHDRAW $9,333,400 from the casino account to my official profile in SKRILL registered under the same email jotasantos0423@gmail.com, I can deliver my earnings to my profile in Skrill And you can verify that that was the only amount of money that could be withdrawn, the others were rejected, casino guru I can send you my password in SKRILL and you can verify that I certainly NEVER received more money, only the $9,333,400 that I shared in the tests, or tell me what I give you, but don't let that casino get away with it, If I had really withdrawn my money I wouldn't be here wasting time and handing out evidence</p>
