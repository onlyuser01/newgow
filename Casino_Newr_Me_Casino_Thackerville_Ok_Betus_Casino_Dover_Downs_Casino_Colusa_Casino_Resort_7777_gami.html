<p>The fast-growing provider of games, powering online gambling operators across the globe, 7777 gaming, strengthened its footprint within the Balkan region thanks to a new partnership. On Wednesday, the company revealed it joined forces with Mr Bit Casino &amp; Sport, an iGaming operator for the market in Bulgaria.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the freshly minted content agreement, players of the operator will be able to access hit titles from 7777 gaming. The new agreement will see Mr Bit significantly grow its gaming portfolio, delivering more than 120 exciting games.</p>
<p>Thanks to the new partnership, new customers in Bulgaria are going to be able to access 7777 gaming's hit games, including Cash 20x, Lucky Clover, Bucks Detective, Sea of Treasure and Diamonds of Majesty, among other quality titles that offer exciting features and engaging gameplay.</p>
<p>Currently, Mr Bit stands out with its customer-centric approach, offering a wide range of casino games from leading iGaming suppliers. Besides Bulgaria, Mr Bit Casino &amp; Sport operates in different markets across the globe, promising exceptional experiences and a chance for big prizes. Not unexpectedly, the operator's platform offers fair and secure online gambling entertainment.</p>
<p>The new agreement will propel Mr Bit's offering. At the same time, the partnership will help strengthen 7777 gaming's presence in the Balkans, allowing its games to reach new customers.</p>
<p>Larisa Karaboycheva, 7777 gaming's Account Manager, said about the latest deal: "We're thrilled to bring the excitement of 7777 gaming to another key player on the Bulgaria market - Mr Bit." Finally, she pointed out: "We look forward to seeing our titles resonate with Mr Bit's players in Bulgaria."</p>
<p>The new collaboration comes ahead of ICE London, a leading event that brings together the entire gaming industry, offering unique education and networking opportunities. This year's edition of the event is scheduled to take place between February 6 and February 8 at ExCeL London and 7777 gaming is set to attend at stand N1-340.</p>
<p>The partnership with Mr Bit comes on the heels of another deal that grew 7777 gaming's Balkan footprint. Earlier this month, the company joined forces with MEGAWIN.mk, a leading iGaming operator in North Macedonia. Under the terms of that deal, 7777 gaming agreed to power the operator with quality games. This granted MEGAWIN.mk access to 50 of the iGaming supplier's quality games.</p>
