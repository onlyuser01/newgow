<p>Burning Wins review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>This slot has a classic fruit machine theme.</p>
<p>Players will find a selection of brightly hued fruits contrasted against a dark set of reels. The symbols seem to glow tantalizingly.</p>
<p>The classic casino slot aesthetic will have players feeling nostalgic as they kick back to wander down memory lane.</p>
<p>Overall, the style is minimalistic, from the aesthetics to the gameplay. Players won’t find surprises here, but may like the familiar mood relaxing.</p>

<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The animation of each fruit is realistic and mouthwatering. Beads of condensation glint on the various lemons, oranges, cherries, and grapes. This lends them an especially fresh and appealing look.</p>
<p>This fruit animation style goes above and beyond the colourful motifs of some games. Clearly, extra care was taken to make each piece of fruit a tasty piece of art.</p>
<p>The game design is otherwise quite minimalistic, with an unobtrusive dark purple background and understated reel framing.</p>
<p>There is no background music for this game, but rather a satisfying clicking upon spins as the reels fall into place. This adds to the feeling that players are using an old-fashioned piece of real life machinery.</p>
<p>Wins prompt a cheery series of shimmering chimes. This hits the right mark between festive and yet still not shrill. Most players will be happy to leave the sounds on and enjoy the atmosphere they add.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Burning Wins is a three reel, three row slot, with five win lines.</p>
<p>Gameplay is very classic, with a pleasant pace.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>There is no Wild symbol in this game.</p>
<p>Sticking to its minimalistic style, this slot also has not added additional bonus options.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.21%, slightly above our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.10 up to a maximum of $/£/€100 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is medium, which makes it a less ideal match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>

<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We do not recommend this high RTP, medium volatility fruit-themed slot.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that this game does an excellent job of executing a classic theme, it does not overcome its mediocre volatility profile.</p>
<p>This slot does not bring anything particularly original to the table, and without a better set of mathematical stats, it’s simply not worth most players’ time.</p>
<p>The lack of bonus opportunities makes the gameplay a less exciting venture. Some players might like the soothing simplicity, but many will be craving variety.</p>
