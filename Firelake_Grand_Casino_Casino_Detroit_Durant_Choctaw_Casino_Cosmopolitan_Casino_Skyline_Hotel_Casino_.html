    <h1>Firelake Grand Casino Casino Detroit Durant Choctaw Casino Cosmopolitan Casino Skyline Hotel Casino</h1>

<p>HERE'S THE SCAM THAT THIS CASINO IS RUNNING:... It took me a while to figure out the scam at this casino, but I finally have a clear picture after 3 wks of my nightmare dealing with them. It's all about unsolicited cashback. This casino (like many others) offers cashback on the money you lose. Most casinos give you between 10%-20%, often with limitations on how much you can withdrawal. However, unlike most (if not all) other casinos, this casino has decided they will just add this cashback to your account w/out notification, w/out you requesting it...completely unsolicited. Which might sound great to some people...however, by them doing this, your entire balance is now considered part of this cashback promo &amp; now you are limited to a withdraw maximum of 10x the cashback amount. Even if you had $100 or even $1000 in your account, if they added $8 cashback (without notifying you &amp; without your permission), all of your $ in your account is now considered cashback promo money. If you try to withdrawal $ from your account, all of that $ including the funds in your account already &amp; all of the winnings after will be capped at 10x the 10% cashback amount = $80. My $1500 withdraw was kept by the casino after they slipped in $8. They pocketed $1420...which is considered Grand Larceny &amp; a FELONY! This is EXACTLY what happened to my account! BEWARE!!!! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!! wish I had the same warning before depositing at this casino myself!</p>
<p>Sadly this was the third major issue I encountered over the course of one week. I’ve visited over 100 online casinos &amp; this was the worst overall experience I’ve ever had. Customer support is very bare-bones 8 hrs of the day &amp; doesn't exist at all the rest of the day. This is due to an error msg that appears when you try to send a msg during non-live chat hours that claims the user is having connection issues preventing you from sending a message. I discovered this after waiting several hours for my bitcoin deposit to show in my acct after it was approved &amp; confirmed. It took several msgs over the span of 3 days &amp; assistance from www.lcb.com casino rep to finally get my deposit posted. This despite that I had the hash # for the transaction &amp; all the info needed for them to confirm my deposit.</p>
<p>The second issue I ran into was a technical glitch or system error that I thankfully caught quickly after noticing that my balance was much lower than it should have been after a nice win. I caught it right away &amp; had the history info from the game itself to back me up. Of course the live chat agent that I was surprisingly able to get in touch with at the time, wouldn't or couldn't do anything &amp; just told me they would "send it to time" for review. They couldn't tell me how long or who to contact &amp; they didn't or wouldn't provide me with any contact info or a reference number. I could only find out by continuously checking in with live chat to find the resolution...&amp; I guess I was supposed to explain it every time to the live chat agent &amp; hope they knew what i was referring to. It took another 3 days before I finally received an email notifying me that a credit was issued to my acct for the missing funds. Lastly, I’ve said enough about the withdrawal experience, but wanted to point out that it took them over a week to deny my withdraw request when they advertise all over their website that it's 24-hr processing of payments for verified accounts…&amp; I was verified before I even started playing. That's how long they scrutinized my account looking for a reason to NOT pay my withdrawal request. ALL OF THE TIME WITHOUT A SINGLE EMAIL OR PHONE CALL or …even a confirmation of the request. The only communication I had was the live agent (when available) who would only say they have nothing to do with billing &amp; can't confirm or deny anything.</p>
<p>=!=!=UPDATE=!=!=!=</p>
<p>This is a follow-up to my previous review. I'm happy to say that the casino (one day after I sent them the link to my posted review here on GURU), contacted the rep that was following up on my complaint...his msg to me:</p>
<p>"After a very detailed review by the whole mgmt of VooZaZa Casino the result is positive &amp; you will be paid the whole amount of $1420.</p>
<p>They said that you can expect the funds tomorrow. "</p>
<p>This detailed review of my account lasted about 30 days...or you could say it lasted 24 hours after I emailed them an example of how serious I was about making sure everyone found out what happened to me. And the funds were in my account the next day. I can't say I would change the content of my review (it's just a record of what I experienced after all), but I am happy they finally came to their senses &amp; did the right thing. I bumped them up from Very Negative to Negative.</p>
<p>But for those of you in my situation, maybe there's hope yet!</p>
