<p>Bragg Gaming expanded on its impressive record to enter new gaming jurisdictions in partnership with market leaders</p>
<p>Gaming content and technology provider Bragg Gaming announced a new content rollout with the largest casino operator in Belgium, Napoleon Sports and Casino.</p>
<p>Content Rollout with the Market Leader</p>
<p>As a result of the partnership with Napoleon Sports and Casino and obtaining its license last year, players in the Benelux country can now enjoy Bragg’s portfolio of games while the Canadian-based gaming supplier continues to expand its presence in Europe.</p>
<p>Commenting on the new business development, Lara Falzon, president and chief operating officer of the Nasdaq- and TSX-listed gaming technology and content company, outlined the excitement of going live in a new jurisdiction, especially when launching “with a market leader like Napoleon Sports and Casino.”</p>
<p>“We’re proud to continue to deliver on our new market expansion strategy, and it is a testament to the hard work of our teams and the quality of our product offering that we can align with so many at the forefront of the industry,” Falzon said, looking forward to enjoying “a fruitful relationship” with its Belgian partner while rolling out Bragg’s “exclusive content” in the country.</p>
<p>The rollout of content with Napoleon aligned with Bragg Gaming’s established approach of entering new regulated gaming jurisdiction in partnerships with market leaders. Napoleon Sports and Casino was acquired by Superbet Group in 2021 and is currently the largest casino operator in Belgium.</p>
<p>“Bragg’s reputation in iGaming is renowned and its provision goes from strength to strength, so this partnership is a natural fit for an innovative and forward-looking operator like Napoleon Sports and Casino,” commented Philippe Joos, chief product officer at Napoleon Sports and Casino.</p>
<p>‘Titles That Speak for Themselves’</p>
<p>Joos also highlighted Napoleon’s ambition to provide its players with “the most thrilling and responsible entertainment in a safe and protected environment,” and that the collaboration with Bragg Gaming “fits perfectly with that goal” by introducing to the market quality “titles that speak for themselves.”</p>
<p>Entering Belgium with Napoleon Sports and Casino opens up new opportunities for Bragg Gaming in an online casino market with an estimated worth of $395 million in 2022 and is expected to diversify the company’s paths to growth while expanding its footprint in a number of key regions.</p>
<p>At the end of last month, Bragg Gaming entered into two key partnerships. The firm initially partnered with First Look Games to ensure access for its in-house studios such as Indigo Magic, Atomic Slot Lab, as well as partners, to more than 800 approved publishers and affiliates, and later on, signed a content deal with DraftKings in New Jersey.</p>
