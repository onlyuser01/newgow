<p>The largest investment for the city is expected to bring a new arena which will serve as the home for University of Nevada Men's Basketball team, along with other amenities</p>
<p>A historic billion-dollar investment in Reno, Nevada is expected to bring a unique form of entertainment for guests and sports fans of the city. Earlier this week, the Grand Sierra Resort (GSR) announced a $1 billion private capital investment, the largest in the history of the city. GSR’s billion-dollar plan seeks to revamp the existing 140-acre property, introducing new amenities.</p>
<p>The project, envisioned over the next decade, is expected to bring a new home for the University of Nevada Men’s Basketball team. The visionary project plans to introduce a new cutting-edge arena that will serve as the home of the Wolf Pack, offering 10,000 seats. In addition to being the home of the Men’s Basketball team, the arena is expected to be used for other sports events and even concerts.</p>
<p>The new arena is expected to take approximately 300K square feet and offer amenities, including shopping outlets for Wolf Pack fans, as well as parking spaces. Additionally, sports fans would be able to benefit from a variety of beverage and food outlets and even enjoy games from exclusive suites. The new arena at GSR is planned to open in the fall of 2026. Subject to Board of Regents approval, Nevada Men’s Basketball is expected to play for either the 2026-27 season or the 2027-28 season.</p>
<p>An Ambitious Plan to Transform Grand Sierra Resort</p>
<p>Alex Meruelo, GSR’s owner, commented: “The vision is to transform GSR into a destination where community, sports and entertainment come together.” Steve Alford, Nevada Men’s Basketball’s head coach, added that the ambitious project represents a game-changer for the team. “I greatly appreciate Alex’s bold vision and incredible support. This will be a state-of-the-art facility and I cannot be more excited for the future of Wolf Pack Basketball,” he explained.</p>
<p>“We are beyond thrilled for this proposed plan which will help continue to elevate our basketball programs.“ Stephanie Rempe, director of Nevada Athletics</p>
<p>Stephanie Rempe, Nevada’s director of Athletics was similarly delighted about GSR’s ambitious plans. She predicted that this important project would provide a vital boost for the Athletics basketball programs. Rempe praised the bold vision of the new state-of-the-art arena that would be the home of Nevada Men’s Basketball.</p>
<p>At the same time, she spoke about the benefits the new arena would bring when it comes to hosting events with Nevada Women’s Basketball. Last but not least, Rempe said that the collaboration would help “solidify Nevada Athletics as a cornerstone of the Northern Nevada community.”</p>
