    <h1>Free Money No Deposit Casino Escanaba Casino Bally S Online Casino Nj Casino Freak Wind Creek Casino</h1>

<p>Screenshot of you telling me to open another account?</p>
<p>me querying it as I thought it was not allowed and you authorising the it ?</p>
<p>this second account was also closed due to gambling problems.</p>
<p>the more you lie the worse it gets, I have all screenshots as I was concerned about things I was being told.</p>
<p>you asked for KYC once , this was provided and you authorised a withdrawal (all provided in earlier screenshots)</p>
<p>and again, we’re all still waiting for the answer that’s been originally asked</p>
<p>, "why did you allow the account to be reopened?"</p>
<p>Just hold your hands up and admit you’ve made some mistakes here.</p>
<p>Im also not going elsewhere to gamble as I’m trying my best to recover from this problem but casinos that operators like yours make that challenge a lot harder and you show no sympathy or remorse about all of the above and damage you cause people.</p>
<p>Casinoguru, I will leave it to you as to who you think has acted correctly here but I can’t deal with the additional stress this is now causing and don’t have the time to constantly go back and forth with them.</p>
<p>Also Wizary you’re very defensive about the whole situation, I never said Wizary was a bad casino and in fact i recommended several people to you online. But in this situation and regards to responsible gambling issues nothing has been dealt with correctly.</p>
<p>Thank you for your help.</p>
<p>thank you</p>
