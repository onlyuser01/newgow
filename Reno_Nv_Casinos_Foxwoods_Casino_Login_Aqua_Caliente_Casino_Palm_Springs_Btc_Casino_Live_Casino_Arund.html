<p>Hello Jake,</p>
<p>I have switched the complaint to the correct casino and checked the website for the Responsible Gambling information https://www.mrvegas.com/responsible-gambling/:</p>
<p>"Player Self-Exclusion</p>
<p>Mr Vegas.com recognises that whilst most players gamble for entertainment, gambling can be harmful to a small number of people. We are committed to creating a responsible gaming environment.</p>
<p>If you are concerned about your gambling behaviour, please consider entering a self-exclusion.</p>
<p>Mr Vegas.com is committed to giving our players an enjoyable and safe gaming experience. If you choose to enter a self-exclusion, your gaming account with Mr Vegas will be self-excluded immediately for the chosen period. This means that you will not be able to login, deposit or play with Mr Vegas whilst self-excluded. Please note that you will not be eligible to re-open your account until the chosen self-exclusion period has expired.</p>
<p>We will also take all reasonable steps to ensure you do not receive any promotional material during this time. Nevertheless, if you use Social Media channels, we strongly recommend you take steps to ensure you donâ€™t receive our news or updates.</p>
<p>You have the option to self-exclude from 6 months up to five years.</p>
<p>We also recommend that you self-exclude with any other operator you may be registered with.</p>
<p>To request a self-exclusion, please contact our support team through. Or you can enter a self-exclusion from your account "My Profile" -&gt; "Responsible Gaming" whilst logged in to your Mr Vegas account.</p>
<p>UK Player Self-Exclusion</p>
<p>Any self-exclusion may, upon request, be extended for one or more further periods of at least 6 months. In order to extend an existing self-exclusion, please contact our customer support team through email or chat.</p>
<p>Upon re-opening request (Live chat, e-mail) when the chosen period of time has expired, one of our CS representatives will contact you over the phone in order to provide you with self-exclusion implications and education. We will then implement a one-day cooling-off period so you can reconsider the decision to access gambling again."</p>
<p>Could you please forward any relevant communication between you and the casino? Thank you very much in advance.</p>
