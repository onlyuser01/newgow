    <h1>Casino Coushatta Casino Caliente Cimarron Casino In Perkins Oklahoma Casino In Danville Va Hard Rock</h1>

<p>William Hill US and CBS Sports, as part of their deal signed in February, announced Wednesday the roll-out of wide ranging digital content across all digital platforms of the media network, as the sports betting operator is looking to utilize the innovative partnership ahead of the start of the new fantasy football season.</p>
<p>New Games, Odds and Videos</p>
<p>The new digital content across the CBS network will feature new offerings, among which a free-to-play parlay game, extensive odds and data, as well as editorial and video programming. Under the partnership with the digital media network, sports bettors will also have access to relevant educational tools such as prop and bet calculators.</p>
<p>“Our partnership is a first-of-its-kind, creating an experience geared to the sports fan and fantasy player that showcases William Hill content and products across the CBS Sports Digital landscape. We’re ready for fantasy football season to begin and can’t wait to introduce fans to the future of sports betting while taking their game to the next level.” Ken Fuchs, President of Digital, William Hill US</p>
<p>William Hill has the exclusive rights to promote its product offerings across the whole spectrum of CBS Sports digital network including CBS Sports Fantasy platform, which is expected to boost customer acquisition for the betting operator as it is one of the largest in the world.</p>
<p>Educational Content to Facilitate Wagering</p>
<p>The content is geared towards educating sports fans how to make picks for fun and understand the essence of sports betting markets, prior to going directly to products of the sports wagering operator in states where betting is legally regulated, and eventually make a seamless betting transaction.</p>
<p>“These enhanced sports betting experiences are the result of a true partnership between CBS Sports Digital and William Hill as we write a new playbook for our companies as well as the broader sports media and sports book industries. Together, we will continue to create maximum value for sports bettors and fans by offering completely new and exciting ways to engage with upcoming sports events.” Jeffrey Gerttula, EVP &amp; General Manager, CBS Sports Digital</p>
<p>For CBS Sports, the partnership deal with William Hill expands its leadership role in the sports wagering space and allows the media network to boost its audience by tapping into the pool of sports bettors across several states. William Hill has its mobile sports betting app live in Colorado, Iowa, Nevada, New Jersey and West Virginia.</p>
