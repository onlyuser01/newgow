<p>After a one-season hiatus, Fulham are back in the Premier League. Their no.1 goal for the 2022-23 season is to stay up, but it’s not going to be easy as the English top-flight looks more competitive than ever. Nevertheless, the spirits are high in Fulham’s locker room, even though their first opponent is one of the main title favorites – Liverpool.</p>
<p>Knowing that the Reds are fresh off winning the 2022 FA Community Shield, in which they defeated the reigning Premier League champions Manchester City 3-1, it’s no surprise that they’re seen as the favorites in Saturday’s EPL game.</p>
<p>Oddsmakers expect Liverpool to have a field day against Fulham, even though their recent experiences with this team aren’t that good. The last time Fulham were in the Premier League, they managed to stay unbeaten against Liverpool, winning one and tying the other game.</p>

<p>Fulham Are Hungry for EPL Success</p>
<p>After getting relegated to the Championship two seasons ago, Fulham dominated the second tier of English soccer, finishing the 2021-22 season at the very top of the table. By winning the Championship, they booked a place in the 2022-23 Premier League season, which is where they plan to stay for years.</p>
<p>The good news for them is that pretty much all of their key men who dominated the Championship are still on the roster. This includes Aleksandar Mitrovic, the new record-holder for most goals scored in the English second flight.</p>
<p>In addition to their old players, Fulham’s squad now has a few fresh faces. Fabio Carvalho came from Liverpool, Andreas Pereira arrived from Manchester United, Joao Palhina from Sporting CP, Manor Solomon from Shakhtar Donetsk, and so on.</p>
<p>These guys definitely look capable of keeping Fulham up, but they probably don’t have enough quality to do much against mighty Liverpool.</p>
<p>Liverpool to Start the Season in Top-Gear</p>
<p>Ever since Jurgen Klopp’s been in charge, Liverpool’s goal remains the same – win as many titles as possible. In the 2022-23 season, they are seen as one of the top favorites to win the Premier League, as well as the FA Cup and Carabao Cup. Plus, their odds of winning the Champions League also look decent.</p>
<p>To make their dreams come true, Liverpool need to start the new campaign in top gear. Actually, they’ve already started it great. Last Saturday, they destroyed Manchester City 3-1. It was a superb team effort, although we did see a couple of Liverpool players truly shine on the pitch – Mohamed Salah, Trent Alexander-Arnold, and their new signing Darwin Nunez.</p>
<p>Fulham vs Liverpool Prediction</p>
<p>Anything but a big win for Liverpool on Saturday would be a huge surprise. Not only are these guys way better than the players playing for Fulham, but they’re also in top shape, considering that we’re just at the beginning of the 2022-23 campaign.</p>
<p>Pick: Liverpool to win; over 2.5 goals</p>
