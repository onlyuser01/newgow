    <h1>The Meadows Casino Hard Rock Casino In Miami Casinos En Austin Texas Casino Connecticut Usa Emerald</h1>

<p>Livespins has started a streaming revolution in the gambling industry. Today, we sit down with the company’s CCO, Michael Pedersen, who walks us over what has been happening with Livespins, and how the company has created a new game format and way to experience and enjoy online casino gaming.</p>
<p>As Pedersen puts it, "there is no other experience like it," and he has a point. Pedersen is confident that the age of casino streaming has arrived and it’s not just something to look forward to in the future. The executive is confident that demand for casino streaming will only increase and as this happens – Livespins will be there to chart a course for the industry. Find out what Pedersen thinks in our full conversation.</p>
<p>Q: Michael, can you tell us a bit more about the Livespins product we have all been hearing about and seeing integrated into casino lobbies? What is it and should our readers be excited?</p>
<p>Livespins is socially charging online casinos and giving players an entirely new way to experience their favourite slots and games. Livespins sits within the casino lobby (in the same way that live dealer does) and sees players join streamers, celebrities, and brand ambassadors for the ride as they stream their gameplay. But players can also get directly involved in the action by betting behind the streamer. This creates a group bet and a shared experience but with each player able to select their own bet amount and a number of spins. Players can chat with the streamer and each other throughout, and drop reactions and emojis.</p>
<p>Should your readers be excited? Absolutely. There is no other experience like it, especially if players take part in Lightning Races – our version of tournaments. They really do need to strap themselves in for a truly thrilling ride.</p>
<p>Q: Streaming plays such an important role in connecting with audiences these days, do you reckon it’s the future and how far can you push the Livespins product offer?</p>
<p>Streaming isn’t just the future, it’s the here and now. The slots category racked up more than 400 million viewing hours on Twitch in 2022, up from the 280 million hours recorded the previous year. The demand for casino streaming content is incredibly strong and will only become stronger. Livespins has been designed to allow online casino operators to offer streaming experiences to players in a way that is responsible, allowing them to deliver the experiences their players are expecting and leverage the huge opportunity on the table. In terms of where we can take the Livespins experience, the sky really is the limit. We have lots of features and tools in the pipeline that will put players even closer to the edge of their seats and are also looking at how we can roll out across other formats such as sports betting. Ultimately, more and more people are seeking interactive and social entertainment experiences and online gambling operators need to provide this.</p>
<p>Q: How have people been receiving Livespins? Is it a product they enjoy and is Livespins bringing more fans to online casinos?</p>
<p>Livespins is whipping up a storm with players really enjoying the experience it provides. It actually works best with existing players, giving them a new way to experience online slots and casino games and providing a compelling reason to keep returning to the casino. But, of course, it is helping online casinos engage new players, especially those that also broadcast their Livespins streams on channels such as Twitch, DLive and Kick. Livespins really appeals to Millennials and Generation Z players – those that grew up with connected console gaming and enjoyed playing alongside friends and strangers. We bring this experience to the online casino space for the first time and, so far, it has proved to be a big hit. That said, it is an experience that all players can enjoy, and those that have tried it for the first time tend to keep coming back for more.</p>
<p>Q: What do you reckon the long-term challenges ahead of the further adoption of Livespins are?</p>
<p>For Livespins, the challenge will be in responding to the truly global demand for our product while scaling the business efficiently. We are already live with some of the biggest casino brands in Europe, have a deal with WynnBet in the US and plenty more lined up. Having spent last year onboarding some of the biggest game providers in the market, this year we are focused on striking operator partnerships so that more players than ever before can experience Livespins for the first time. We are already live with the likes of Bitstarz, M88 andYolo Group, and following our recent win at the EGR B2B Awards 2023, expect many more casinos to sign on the dotted line in the coming months.</p>
<p>Q: Can you make one big prediction for 2023 and Livespins’ place in it?</p>
<p>The Livespins revolution will continue to gather pace and players at some of the biggest casino brands in the world will be able to tune in to their favourite streamers and brand ambassadors while also betting behind the action taking place across the reels. I predict that this year will also see the first household name celebrity run a Livespins stream, chatting with players as they bet and interact with the big-name celeb and others that have come along for the ride. Livespins has already changed the game for online casino play and in 2023 we will continue to build momentum behind the business.</p>
