    <h1>Three Rivers Casino Resort Oklahoma Casino Las Vegas Casinos List Parx Casino Philadelphia Grand Cas</h1>

<p>I am a member of Betonline Casino in Panama. On JAnuary 29th, I had $67K USD in my account, after hours of roulette, blackjack, and other play. I withdrew $10K without issue.</p>
<p>The following day, my account rose to $84K with gameplay and decreased to $54K after some losses. I submitted a withdrawal request for $52,800 USD. This withdrawal was declined. I called, but was told that I could not speak to anyone in the financial or gaming departments. On January 30th, I received an email from the financial department stating, "We regret to inform you that we have identified a technical malfunction on our website that occurred on January 29th. This issue led to certain transactions being erroneously credited multiple times to your account."</p>
<p>Yesterday, January 31st, my account had casino wins and losses in 3 large amounts added and subtracted. Then it had a "write-off" balance added. It is now at zero dollars and still disabled.</p>
<p>I received an email today that the investigation is done and that, due to an unexpected error occurred that resulted in erroneous credits being credited to my account, my balance was wrong and has been adjusted to $0.00.</p>
<p>I played several different games to get to the balance that I did. The fact that they are now claiming that my actual wins are an error is completely ludicrous.</p>
