    <h1>Casino In Davenport Ia Online Casinos For Real Money Emerald Queen Casino Hotels Movies Boulder Stat</h1>

<p>I created my account and made my first deposit on December 12, € 200 + € 200 bonus. The maximum bet was 2 euros with this bonus and I did not bet more or less than 2 euros during the entire turnover process. I requested a withdrawal of 2000 euros and was asked to submit documents. December 18 my documents were verified and I requested a withdrawal again, was told that they could not issue money mastercard so I had to make an account on ecopayz.com so I created an account there and made a deposit through ecopayz to verify that account. Asked for a new withdrawal after that and they have asked me to wait and wait .... I have emailed them 2-3 times a week and they have just said every time that I should be patient. Now last week I got a phone call from them, they asked a lot of questions like what games I had played and how much my biggest win was and so on. I answered everything I could remember because it had been over a month since I played and won there. They were not happy with my answers and wanted to have a skype conversation with me while they saw my face so it really was me. We did it last week and now I got this email - https://gyazo.com/3c387b0d8d288cba0986f92ee0d9fbcb I was watching a twitch stream when talking to the guy, I had no idea I had to have eye contact with phone the whole conversation. It just felt stupid to stare into a black screen. All rules etc he links in that email I have followed to 100% abused none of the terms. I don't know what to do now, any advice?</p>
