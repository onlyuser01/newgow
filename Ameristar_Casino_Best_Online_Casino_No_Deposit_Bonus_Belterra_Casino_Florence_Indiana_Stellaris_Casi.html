<p>Continent 8 Technologies, a provider of managed hosting, connectivity, cloud and security solutions, has reinforced its commercial team with two new regional sales directors.

<p>In their new positions, the two appointees will manage Continent 8’s existing customer relations and will work on expanding the company in key markets, including the Americas and Europe.</p>
<p>Alessio is based in New Jersey and will bring over two decades and a half of experience in IT sales and leadership. He has worked for many notable firms and is skilled in hosting, managed hosting, cloud, ERP and AWS services, among others. Some of Alessio’s prior experiences include tenures at Google, AWS, Azure and Oracle OCI.</p>
<p>Renouf, meanwhile, is based in Jersey, Channel Islands. He boasts more than 15 years of experience with customers from all over the world. Renouf has provided multi-jurisdictional hosting, cloud and security solutions within the Fintech and iGaming industries, helping companies expand their online presence and bolster their revenues.</p>
<p>The two new hires are valuable additions that will help Continent 8 speed up its expansion. The company currently operates in more than 90 locations across four continents and is bullish on expanding its footprint further.</p>
<p>The two new workers will attend ICE London with Continent 8 next month. Visitors can find the company’s stand under the N3-110 number.</p>
<p>The Appointees Are Excited to Work with Continent 8</p>
<p>The two workers shared their thoughts on joining the company. Alessio lauded Continent 8’s recent successes and praised it for working with some of the biggest companies in iGaming. However, the new worker is sure that the company still has room for growth.</p>
<p>It’s exciting to me to have the opportunity to bring my experience and technical capabilities from outside of the industry to the business and to help push Continent 8 forwards and towards hitting its goals. Randy J. Alessio, regional sales director, Continent 8 Technologies</p>
<p>Renouf echoed his colleague’s sentiments. He noted that Continent 8’s growth has been nothing short of impressive and said that he feels honored to be able to join its team.</p>
<p>Having worked in the industry for over 15 years, I am proud to be working for such a well-respected brand, and I look forward to using my expertise and knowledge to build on the success the business has already had over the past 25 years. Nigel Renouf, regional sales director, Continent 8 Technologies</p>
<p>Continent 8 Technologies’ chief commercial officer, Brian B. Koh, welcomed Alessio and Renouf to the company. He praised them for their expertise and said they are going to augment the company’s talented commercial team.</p>
