<p>The game that is powered by Yggdrasil’s popular Game Adaptation Tools &amp; Interface (GATI) belongs to the YG Masters portfolio. It has the standard 5×3 grid with 25 paylines. The action is set inside a mesmerizing, enchanted forest where a beautiful green fairy awaits, ready to lead the way to magical wins. The game symbols are represented by specific good luck elements part of the Irish culture: the four-leaf clover, green lucky hats, pots filled with coins and others.</p>
<p>Special Game Features</p>
<p>While the base game is equally fun and exciting to play, once the special symbols start kicking in, the action becomes truly captivating. The game hides several features like the Pop and Drop mechanic, the Free Spins Gamble, and the Free Spins Bonus.</p>
<p>Pop and Drop Game Mechanic</p>
<p>This feature removes the symbols that helped create a win, while having them replaced with new ones. Players who manage to land consecutive wins also benefit from multipliers that go up with each new cascade.</p>
<p>Free Spins Gamble Feature</p>
<p>To activate this feature, players must see a minimum of three scatter symbols appear simultaneously on the grid. Next, players are invited to gather a minimum of seven free spins. They can also use the alternative Lucky Bet option and take a risk in an attempt to collect even more free spins.</p>
<p>Free Spins Bonus</p>
<p>When five scatters show up on the grid, players benefit from the Free Spins Bonus round. During this round, players are given access to a multiplier after each new win. This is similar to the base game. The multipliers keep increasing between different cascades and never reset.</p>
<p>Fairy Magic Feature</p>
<p>Engaged in a random manner during the base game, the Fairy Magic feature triggers the fairy to remove some of the symbols on the grid with the purpose of starting a cascade.</p>
<p>Yggdrasil’s head of product Stuart McCarthy, called the fresh slot “an exciting new release from Reflex Gaming incorporating one of our most intense GEMs”. Reflex Gaming’s chief product officer Mat Ingram praised the collaboration with Yggdrasil.
