<p>Blood and Shadow review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Blood and Shadow has a spooky supernatural theme.</p>
<p>Players will enter the ruins of a cathedral and discover piles of skulls and countless candles. As haunting creatures begin to appear and players will need to cast a few spells to survive.</p>
<p>This slot will especially appeal to players who are interested in the occult and horror genre.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The sound of wind blowing and the raspy breaths of some unknown monster give this slot a creepy atmosphere. The reels spin with a clink, and occasionally organs burst with a squishy splatter.</p>
<p>On the reels, players will see a range of cryptic symbols that bring to mind ancient runes. The color palette is restrained with shades of grey, brown, and dusky green most prominent. This allows flashes of red blood to stand out in vivid contrast.</p>
<p>A variety of supernatural beings also make an appearance including multi-eyed monsters, a red-eyed witch, and an eerie undead Madonna. Ravens, goats, wolves, and snakes are also among the symbols, each with glowing eyes. Each character symbol seems to be etched in ink, creating the aesthetic of a graphic novel.</p>
<p>Behind the reels, there is a dilapidated gothic cathedral. Candles and skulls are scattered around the space reinforcing the macabre mood.</p>
<p>Together, the soundtrack and graphics create a dark, supernatural world.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Blood and Shadow is a five reel, four row slot.</p>
<p>Wins are awarded for landing matching symbols in adjacent reels, starting from the leftmost reel.</p>
<p>The maximum possible payout for Blood and Shadow is 6,666x the player’s total bet.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter symbol.</p>
<p>The Ritual Bar below the reels monitors players’ progression through a variety of levels. The Ritual Bar advances when players land Scatters or winning combinations that include medium-high paying symbols.</p>
<p>When players reach a new Ritual Bar level, they are awarded +2 Candle Spins until they reach level 4 when this increases to +6 spins Cursed Spins. During the Cursed Spins feature, the Ritual Bar is removed and the reels transform to a 5x5 structure filled with only high-paying symbols.</p>
<p>If players land a Scatter during the Cursed Spins, an additional free spin is awarded.</p>
<p>Sticky Wilds appear on reels 2, 3, 4, and 5. During wins awarded by the Ritual Bar, Wilds travel to the bottom of the reels and remain sticky.</p>
<p>During Cursed Spins, xSplit symbols are active, splitting either the reels or rows they land on. This also divides symbols, doubling the number of symbols and creating more potential wins.</p>
<p>If players choose to buy into the Cursed Spins feature, 10 free spins are awarded.</p>
