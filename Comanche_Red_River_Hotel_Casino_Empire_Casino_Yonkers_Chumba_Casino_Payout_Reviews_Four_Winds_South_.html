    <h1>Comanche Red River Hotel Casino Empire Casino Yonkers Chumba Casino Payout Reviews Four Winds South</h1>

<p>Dear Sohilshaikh51,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. Before we’ll contact the casino and ask for their standpoint, could you please forward emails or screenshots showing that you have sent request for the self-exclusion? My email address is petronela.k@casino.guru. Did you specify in that request for how long you wish your account to be suspended and the reason why?</p>
<p>I have checked the Responsible Gambling section on the website, and this is what I found:</p>
<p>„Self-Exclusion</p>
<p>If you feel that your gambling has become problematic, you can self-exclude yourself by contacting Customer Service and requesting a self-exclusion period be applied to your account.</p>
<p>The following Self-Exclusion periods are available:</p>
<p>• 1 week</p>
<p>• 2 weeks</p>
<p>• 1 month</p>
<p>• 3 months</p>
<p>• 6 months</p>
<p>We will endeavor to apply your self-exclusion as soon as practically possible, however, please note that this process takes a reasonable working period to implement. We will not consider the self-exclusion period as having commenced until it has been fully implemented and communicated to you. If you can still access any of our services after self-exclusions, it is your responsibility to contact us immediately to inform us.</p>
<p>Any unsettled bets with Rajabets at the time that you enter into self-exclusion will be settled on the result of the event. If your bet is a winner, your winnings will be automatically withdrawn to your applicable credit/debit card or another financial account from which the funds were deposited.</p>
<p>Please note that upon your selected self-exclusion period expiring, your account will be automatically reactivated.</p>
<p>It is possible to revoke Self-exclusion upon a written request (and thereafter only after 24 hours has elapsed from the submitted written request), and Rajabets will always do all it can do to detect and close any new duplicate accounts that you may open. Once the self-exclusion is applied, you will also no longer receive any further marketing materials from us."</p>
<p>Is this support@rajabets.com the email address that you have sent your email to?</p>
<p>I hope we will be able to help you to resolve this issue as soon as possible. Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
