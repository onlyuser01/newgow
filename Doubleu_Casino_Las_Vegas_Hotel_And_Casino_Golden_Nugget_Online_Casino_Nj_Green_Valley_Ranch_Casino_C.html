<p>Kambi Group Plc has signed a new deal with the Desert Diamond Casinos &amp; Entertainment launching a dedicated on-site sportsbook in the process. The partnership will allow Kambi to extend its business nous to casino properties in Arizona.</p>
<p>Kambi’s software will be available at Desert Diamond Casinos’ properties, which is the largest tribal operator in the state, and one of ten to receive a sports betting license back in Arizona from the Arizona Department of Gaming.</p>
<p>While tribal sports betting has gone through in Arizona, not everyone was happy at first. The Yavapai-Prescott Indian Tribe tried to contest the introduction of on-site and mobile wagering as illegal and harmful to tribal operators’ interests.</p>
<p>Desert Diamond Casinos Welcomes Kambi in the Fold</p>
<p>Desert Diamond Casinos &amp; Entertainment CEO Mike Bean welcomed the multi-year partnership with Kambi and said that it’s an opportunity for the operator to build upon its sports betting offer by leveraging Kambi’s globally-recognized software.</p>
<p>“This exciting partnership provides Desert Diamond with the ability to leverage its long-standing, well-regarded brand to provide our guests with a leading sports betting product across multiple channels.” Desert Diamond Casinos &amp; Entertainment CEO Mike Bean</p>
<p>This means that Kambi will debut at Sahuarita, Tucson, and West Valley casinos, bringing its sports betting software along with it. Following this initial launch, Kambi is now planning on expanding its offer to interactive wagering, which should be coming this quarter under the hood of Desert Diamond Mobile LLC, a dedicated separate entity that will focus on mobile betting instead.</p>
<p>Kambi on Time for the NFL and NBA</p>
<p>Desert Diamond Casinos stands to benefit from a range of experiences and solutions with Kambi’s on-site sports betting software being one of the best. This includes the Bring Your Own Device tech and dedicated Kambi kiosks which make sports betting simple and to the point.</p>
<p>Kambi has been able to debut several new solutions just on time for the NFL season and Desert Diamond Casinos will now be able to leverage this technology to an increasingly busy sports schedule with the arrival of the NBA season.</p>
<p>Commenting on the progress so far, Kambi CEO Kristian Nylén said that the company was proud to be teaming up with Desert Diamond Casinos &amp; Entertainment, marking another important step for Kambi towards establishing stronger ties with tribal operators.</p>
<p>“Desert Diamond Casinos is renowned for offering world-class gaming and entertainment experiences and complements Kambi’s strategy to partner with market leaders.” Kambi CEO Kristian Nylén</p>
<p>Nylén is confident that the pair can work together to deliver high-quality sports betting experiences to both the interactive and in-person wagering sectors in the Grand Canyon State.</p>
<p>Tribal operators are the de facto leaders in the Arizonian sports gambling market with many private companies vying to get a license in the state through one of the recognized stakeholders.</p>
