    <h1>Best Casinos Near Me Ellis Island Hotel Casino Brewery Choctaw Casino Durant Online Casino Betting H</h1>

<p>Hello Petronela,</p>
<p>I apologize for not answering yet.</p>
<p>First of all, yes, I was able to make a payout successfully!</p>
<p>But not without further problems.</p>
<p>A bonus was automatically activated on the first deposit.</p>
<p>I ignored this or did not see it because these bonuses were not added directly to the deposit balance. I ONLY play live casino and no slot machines. In order to meet the redemption conditions for the bonuses, you have to wager 30 times the bonus balance with the slot machines.</p>
<p>But after I played live casino and had not noticed the bonus, my winnings in the live casino or the stakes in the live casino to achieve the redemption points were not taken into account.</p>
<p>I had already won around EUR 200 in the live casino. As long as a bonus is active, no withdrawals can be made (I am aware of this). In the bonus conditions it is mentioned that the bonus can be canceled by the support. After not reading it, my live casino promotions were useless.</p>
<p>I had to meet the redemption conditions by betting on slot machines, otherwise the winnings would be deducted with active bonuses and a desired payout.</p>
<p>So I was forced to play slot machines until I finally lost the winnings. As I said, I only play live casino and never slot machines! I have no idea about slot machines!</p>
<p>My winnings in the live casino were lost again, but the bonus conditions were still not met. I asked the support to deactivate the bonus via live chat. This was deactivated by the support (after 3 attempts) and my account balance was reset except for the first deposit amount!</p>
<p>I was finally able to make a successful withdrawal.</p>
<p>The payout duration was acceptable with 3 days.</p>
<p>My suggestion for ICE36:</p>
<p>The player must be able to activate or deactivate bonuses himself, as is the case with other providers (e.g. bwin, Vulkan Vegas, 888.casino, etc.)! It should also be clear from a list which games belong to the achievement of the redemption conditions.</p>
<p>With ICE36, the bonus is only visible when you start a selected game (slot) in which you can collect redemption points! That means you cannot collect redemption points on ALL slot machines.</p>
<p>With these two measures there would certainly be fewer problems or even not occur at all!</p>
<p>But maybe you don't want this transparency at all ?!</p>
<p>You can finally complete the process.</p>
<p>I do not find the good rating for ICE36 justified on your part!</p>
<p>Sincerely yours</p>
<p>Bernt N ***</p>
