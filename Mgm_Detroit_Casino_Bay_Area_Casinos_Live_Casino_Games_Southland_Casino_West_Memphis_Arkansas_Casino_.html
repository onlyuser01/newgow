<p>Betr, the micro-betting celebrity-backed sports betting brand spearheaded by Joey Levy and Jake Paul, has gained market access to a new market in the United States, through Caesars Southern Indiana.</p>
<p>Betr is focused on combining the best of a sports betting and sports media &amp; entertainment, not least through the image and likeness of Jake Paul, and Levy’s extensive experience in building successful products in the industry.</p>
<p>Micro betting is similarly an innovative and accessible form of sports gambling which is likely to appeal to younger generations of gamblers who are hesitant about getting started with betting in the first place.</p>
<p>Subject to regulatory approval, the partnership that unlocks Indiana is established between Caesars Southern Indiana, the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, and their gaming firm, EBCI Holdings, and Betr.</p>
<p>Betr has not confirmed an exact date as to when it may launch its operations in Indiana, but the company is confident that this will happen in the "coming months." Commenting on this, Betr CEO and Founder, Levy said:</p>
<p>"Market access is one of the primary expenses that comes with launching a regulated sports betting business in the US, so we have been focused on aligning ourselves with partners who buy into our vision and are willing to take equity in lieu of cash for access."</p>
<p>Levy similarly welcomed the opportunity to be working with EBCI Holdings and Caesars Southern Indiana to make this a reality. The partnership was naturally welcomed by Caesars Southern Indiana general manager Brad Seigel who was happy to be partnering with a fresh and dynamic brand that is capable of delivering on company expectations.</p>
<p>Betr is no doubt benefiting from Levy’s expertise as the executive helped build Simplebet, a similar micro-betting solution. Not least, though, JakePaul’s media following is definitely sealing the deal for Betr, making it an immediate success.</p>
<p>Once all the final details are sorted out with the Indiana Gaming Commission, and the Betr platform is live, sports fans will be able to leverage the powerful micro-betting solution to place their wagers around the clock and on thousands of possible events from the NFL to the NBA, to the NHL, to anything else that is covered by sportsbooks.</p>
<p>Betr is committed to rapidly scaling its market access and reach through the United States as the company already has a fantastic start. Betr also went live on the Apple and Google Play stores in September.</p>
