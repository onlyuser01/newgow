<p>The Golden State Warriors vs. Denver Nuggets is the most interesting of all 14 NBA games scheduled for Wednesday, November 8, 2023</p>
<p>The Golden State Warriors vs. Denver Nuggets is the biggest NBA game of the week if not the entire month. It’s because, on one end, there’s Steph Curry, who’s one of the best three-point shooters in history. On the other is Denver’s kind of triple-doubles Nikola Jokic.</p>
<p>With these guys on the court, we can have no other prediction but that we’ll see a lot of points on both ends on November 8. The Nuggets are averaging 117.0 points per game, while the Warriors are at 116.1 PPG right now.</p>
<p>Obviously, this is going to be a fun game to watch, which you can do on ESPN. But if you want to bet on this game, you might be wondering about the Warriors at Nuggets prediction. If so, you need to keep on reading!</p>

<p>Golden State Warriors Aren’t Scoring as Many as They’d Like</p>
<p>The Warriors are 6-2 on the season, with their scoring average being 116.1, which is among the best in the NBA. However, they probably feel as if they could’ve done even better.</p>
<p>Steph Curry was lights out against the Pistons:</p>

<p>The thing is that their top players haven’t been too precise with their shots. Steph Curry, for example, went 7-for-17 from the three-point field goal line in Golden State’s last game (vs. Detroit Pistons). That’s 10 three-pointers wasted by Curry.</p>
<p>Klay Thompson was even worse that day; he scored just one of his eight attempted three-point field goals.</p>
<p>The reason all this should worry the Warriors is that in the 2023-24 NBA season, they almost exclusively rely on three-pointers.</p>
<p>Nikola Jokic Needs to Go Wild Tonight</p>
<p>Jamal Murray won’t play in the Warriors vs. Nuggets game this evening, which could be a huge problem for the home team. It could, if Nikola Jokic doesn’t get in a beast mode.</p>
<p>The No. 1 MVP favorite is having a fantastic season, but he’ll have to take it up a notch this evening now that Murray is out.</p>

<p>Jokic will have to get busy on the offense to try to keep up with the Warriors, meaning that we’ll probably see the Serbian center try and score some three-pointers. He’ll also have to jump a lot to pick up the loose ball.</p>
<p>The good news for the Nuggets is that he’s used to these sorts of things. In his team’s last game (vs. Pelicans), he recorded a triple-double, his third of the 2023-24 NBA season. When it comes to double-doubles, he’s got a 100% record this season.</p>
<p>Golden State Warriors vs. Denver Nuggets Prediction</p>
<p>The Golden State vs. Denver odds suggest the Nuggets are more likely to win, but we’re not so sure about it. If the Warriors up their three-point percentage, we could see them score a huge number of points, which the Nuggets won’t be able to reach.</p>
<p>They haven’t been laser-sharp with their shots in the 2023-24 NBA season, but they’ve had plenty of time to work on that and prepare for tonight’s game. That’s why our Warriors at Nuggets prediction is that the visitors will win.</p>
<p>Pick: Golden State Warriors to win</p>
