<p>Jumbo Stampede review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Jumbo Stampede takes the player on an East African safari, offering views of lions, leopards, zebras, and of course, the majestic elephants of the title. Rolling grasslands under a blood-red sunset glow make up the background as the reels turn the circle of life under magnificent cloud formations.</p>
<p>You can almost smell the hot dust and the warm musty tang of elephant dung on the breeze.</p>

<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The graphics are pretty on point for Jumbo Stampede. As is so often the case with natural history based slots, Jumbo Stampede has a mural-like art style that is executed particularly well in this case.</p>
<p>The animations are nothing special but are timed well to make wins look satisfying and spins tense, without being slow.</p>
<p>The music is a pretty innocuous percussion-based rhythm that feels sufficiently – though very generically – African to lend the slot the atmosphere it needs to immerse the player.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Jumbo Stampede has a pretty standard set of gameplay features. It is played on six reels with four symbols each and uses an any way wins system that makes for 4,096 different ways to win.</p>
<p>There are a few simple bonus features to add a little spice, but on the whole, gameplay is not a field of innovation for most of iSoftBet’s output.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbols substitute for all other symbols apart from the Bonus symbol.</p>
<p>Three or more Bonus symbols will trigger a free spins bonus. Hitting three Bonus symbols will get you 8 free spins, with 15 spins for four symbols, 20 for five symbols, and 50 for six Bonus symbols.</p>
<p>Free Spins can be retriggered by two or more Bonus symbols. Two symbols gets you another five spins, with the rest retriggering the same number of spins.</p>
<p>Wild symbol multiplied in free spins bonus game</p>
<p>During the free spins, Wild symbols that are included in a winning combination can be converted into Multiplier Wilds which count as two or three Wilds.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Jumbo symbol pays out as if it is a Scatter during these Free Spins.</p>
<p>You will win with just 2 top paying symbols of the game</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 95.94%. Pretty much dead on our yardstick for the industry average of about 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum of $/£/€0.20 to a maximum bet per spin of $/£/€20.00. This is a rather low range, but other sites may offer a wider spectrum of bets.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is high, which goes well with our preferred strategies.</p>
<p>Paytable for Jumbo Stampede slot</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>The average RTP of Jumbo Stampede, coupled with its high volatility makes this game pretty appealing at the mathematical level.</p>
<p>At the gameplay level, Jumbo Stampede is solid with little to complain about, but also very little that stands out as especially engaging or exciting. This is similar with the audio-visual elements which are not bad but also do not distinguish themselves particularly.</p>
<p>Overall we can recommend Jumbo Stampede, but not with any great enthusiasm.</p>
