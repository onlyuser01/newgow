<p>Arsenal vs Liverpool is arguably the most interesting matchup of Round 10 of the 2022-23 Premier League. The game is on the program on Sunday, October 9, at Arsenal’s Emirates Stadium in London. Betting odds on each of the possible three outcomes are pretty close, which suggests we’re going to witness a real barnburner.</p>

<p>The Gunners Playing Elite Soccer in the 2022-23 Season</p>
<p>It seems strange, but Arsenal has won only two games against Liverpool in their previous 20 meetings. Can they get to their third win over the Reds? They might, because their roster looks incredible in the 2022-23 season.</p>
<p>Although the core of Arsenal’s squad is made of players who have been there for several years, they just weren’t great before. The reason is that most of the Gunners’ players are youngsters still in their early 20s.</p>
<p>Some believe that this season could be the one when they take that big leap forward. Judging by what we’ve seen from them so far, that might very well be the case. The Gunners are 7-0-1 in the Premier League, occupying the #1 position at the moment.</p>
<p>Liverpool Still Trying to Find Proper Form</p>
<p>The Reds started their campaign with high expectations, however, problems for Jurgen Klopp and his boys started from Round 1. They failed to beat Fulham in the opening round, and it took them until Round 4 to get their first win of the season.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to October and the Reds are 2-4-1 in the Prem, which is equal to only 10 points. If they want to keep their dream of winning another Premier League title alive, they need to start playing much, much better.</p>
<p>In the previous round, their offense did okay against Brighton, scoring three goals. Unfortunately, their defense had a horrible time on the pitch, allowing three goals. They’re the ones to blame for the failure in the previous round. Still, knowing how good defenders Liverpool has on the roster, we don’t expect to see another embarrassing performance this weekend.</p>
<p>Arsenal vs Liverpool Prediction</p>
<p>Jurgen Klopp’s boys have dropped too many points this season, meaning that they just have to up their game on Sunday. Beating Arsenal isn’t going to be easy, but they have no other option but to try it. By this, we mean that the Reds need to go out on the pitch and attack with all they got.</p>
<p>Picks: Liverpool to win; over 2.5 goals</p>
