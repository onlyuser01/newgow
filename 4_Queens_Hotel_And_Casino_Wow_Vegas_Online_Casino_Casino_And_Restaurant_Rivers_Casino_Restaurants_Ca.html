    <h1>4 Queens Hotel And Casino Wow Vegas Online Casino Casino And Restaurant Rivers Casino Restaurants Ca</h1>

<p>Dear Jade,</p>
<p>Thank you for your e-mail regarding our request for additional information from you, in order to process your withdrawal request. We are sorry to hear that you are unhappy with our processes. We take all reports of dissatisfaction seriously and will always investigate, and respond to all of the matters you have raised, in order to provide you with a full explanation for requesting this information from you.</p>
<p>We would like to reassure you that our request is not a reluctance on our part to send you your winnings, we are happy to see our players, and you, win and be successful. We do understand sometimes that it can be difficult for our players to understand why we ask for proof of ID and other documentation before making payments out. As a mobile casino we have a responsibility to our players to ensure as far as possible that payments are made to the correct people, and in a reasonable timeframe.</p>
<p>Because of our licence we have a responsibility to our regulators, as well as to other parts of the business community to ensure that our players are genuine, and that they are using legitimate payment methods. This includes being alert to the possibility that some players may unfortunately attempt to defraud their mobile phone or other payment providers.</p>
<p>We take our regulatory responsibilities seriously and therefore we have in place a number of internal procedures and controls to help prevent any potential abuse of the gaming system.</p>
<p>In this instance we have requested information from you not to verify your identity, but due to the deposit frequency and amounts you have deposited into your Cahsmo Casino account using your mobile phone. When making deposits using your mobile, your network provider credits us with the amount you have requested, which you in turn pay back to your network provider at a later date.</p>
<p>The possibility of us asking for this information is covered within our terms and conditions which was acknowledged and accepted by you when you first registered your account. For reference I would refer you extracts from the terms and conditions for Cashmo which apply to your circumstances as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>You may make a deposit by debit card and Paysafe Card. In addition, we may offer you a facility to top-up your Account by applying a charge to your mobile phone bill or mobile phone pre-pay account. We reserve the right to withdraw or limit any payment facility at any time and without notice. You may not use this facility if doing so is in breach of the terms of your mobile network operator agreement. If we are advised by your mobile network operator of your non-payment or misuse of this facility, or if payment is withheld by your operator or we reasonably suspect your non-payment or misuse of this facility, we may ask you to provide evidence of payment to your network operator and, if you have not been able to provide this for a period of 12 months or more, we reserve the right to close your Account. You will lose any amounts deposited and will not be entitled to withdraw any amounts in your Account if your Account is closed in these circumstances.</li>
</ol>
<p>Section 9: Withdrawals</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We reserve the right to void bets and refuse or withhold a withdrawal where we have any reasonable grounds for closing your Account (see Section 10 below), including where there is evidence of "suspicious activity" (see Section 13 below). In particular, if we suspect fraud or fraudulent activity on your part, or any of your deposits are charged back to us as a result of (alleged) fraudulent use, or loss, of your credit or debit card, we reserve the right to refuse or withhold a withdrawal from your Account and, if necessary, to lawfully collect any payments owed by you. It is your responsibility to provide correct bank details for winning payments. We will make reasonable efforts to contact you to obtain correct bank details.</p>
