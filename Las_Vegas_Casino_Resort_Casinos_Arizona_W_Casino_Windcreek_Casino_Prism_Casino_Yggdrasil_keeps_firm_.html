    <h1>Las Vegas Casino Resort Casinos Arizona W Casino Windcreek Casino Prism Casino Yggdrasil keeps firm</h1>

<p>Yggdrasil continues to expand in the coveted Dutch iGaming market at a time of shifting and maturing online casino industry, with the acclaimed supplier boosting its local presence through a new tie-up with Circus.nl.</p>
<p>Moving forward, Yggdrasil’s player-favorite content and YG Masters partner content will be available to Circus.nl players in the regulated Dutch market.</p>
<p>This means that players will get to enjoy some of the most innovative features available in the industry, including Game Engagement Mechanics, and releases such as Legend ofDragon WinsDoubleMax, Excalibur VS GigaBlox and not least – Rock Star Santa MultiMax, as some of the excellent choices available locally.</p>
<p>Circus.nl will be able to tap and pick from the 130-odd titles provided by the YG Masters slot portfolio, presenting a variety of excellent titles designed to cater to every taste and player preference. Yggdrasil has a two-pronged approach in elevating the experience for its players, providing players with enhanced maths through its GATI technology and also wrapping the functionalities in a neat visual package to drive engagement and retention.</p>
<p>Owing to Circus.nl’s own leadership position in the iGaming market in the Netherlands, Yggdrasil is confident that it can secure further positions and gain on the local market and importantly – competitors.</p>
<p>Yggdrasil CEO James Curwen welcomed the opportunity to once again expand the company’s operations in the Netherlands, confirming that the market is a key focus for the supplier, as it seeks to reach an ever-larger audience locally. Curwen had this to add commenting specifically on the tie-up with Circus:</p>
<p>"Our content has already proven popular with local players in the Dutch market, and we are excited to further bolster our stronghold in the country together with Circus."</p>
<p>The news was met on a similarly high note by Denis Witterbrood, the Casino Operations Manager at Circus.nl, who was similarly excited to see Yggdrasil inject its diverse and versatile portfolio into the operator’s library and provide local players with a strong selection of mechanics and themes.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Yggdrasil continued to grow in other markets from around Europe, including Bulgaria and Switzerland via partnerships with Inbet and Casino Lugano respectively. Yggdrasil has released a dozen of new slots in 2023, and the supplier is stepping into 2024 prepared to pick up the pace.</p>
