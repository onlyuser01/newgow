    <h1>Luckybird Casino Borgata Casino In Atlantic City Morongo Casino Resort Spa California Ignition Casin</h1>

<p>Dear pfisteryaenu,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. Iâ€™m sorry to hear about your negative experience with Pledoo Casino.</p>
<p>I checked the responsible gambling section of the website and I found this:</p>
<p>Standby or cool-off periods / Self exclusion</p>
<p>If you believe that playing games might affect your life in a negative way, we at Pledoo are able to help you. We provide you with the ability to exclude yourself from playing on our site for various periods of time. We offer 24-hour stand-by periods as well as 7 day, 30 day, 2 month restrictions and longer timeouts (only with email confirmation on security@pledoo.com. When sending an request to security@pledoo.com, please make sure that this message is directly addressed and not a forward or carbon copy (cc). There is a high possibility that these types of emails will go into Spam and therefore won't be viewed by the relevant department). You will not be able to access the games and/or services of Pledoo. Once you ask for a self-exclusion period, you have to close all tables at which you are playing and log out from your account. Once you have done that, the time out or self-exclusion period will begin. You will not be able to deposit or withdrawal and make inter-account transfers with your Pledoo account. Furthermore, you will not receive any marketing emails or newsletters from Pledoo after your cool off period has been initiated. It is important for Pledoo to receive information about your reasons as to why limit your account. The staff members of Pledoo have been trained in social responsibility and are trained to deal with compulsive gambling behaviour. They are always there to assist you with personal aid or guidance as to where you should go to find further help. If Pledoo recognises that gambling can cause serious financial harm to the Customer it reserves the right to close the players account in order to help overcome any addiction thereof.</p>
<p>Could you please advise if you contacted the casino and requested a self-exclusion via email?</p>
<p>What response have you received?</p>
<p>Thank you very much in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Tomas</p>
