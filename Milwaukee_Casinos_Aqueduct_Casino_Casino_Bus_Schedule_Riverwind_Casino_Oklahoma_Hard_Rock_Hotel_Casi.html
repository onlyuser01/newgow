<p>The new informational website was launched in accordance with Denmark’s strategy to reduce problem gambling</p>
<p>Denmark’s gambling regulator, Spillemyndigheden, has launched a new informational website that provides local consumers with information about gambling and gambling harm. The new site’s goal is to provide local players with sufficient educational materials about the sector and its risks.</p>
<p>Called StyrPåSpillet.dk, the new site will be Denmark’s official public informational portal for information about the country’s gambling industry. It will cover materials about the various gambling sectors, including brick-and-mortar casinos, lottery operators and iGaming companies.</p>
<p>In addition to updating Danish consumers about the latest developments in Danish gambling, StyrPåSpillet.dk will have a section dedicated to parents and educators. This section will include a variety of educational materials about addictive behavior, how to spot it and how to prevent kids and young people from harm.</p>
<p>The available educational materials, the Spillemyndigheden elaborated, are primarily focused on students aged 13 to 15.</p>
<p>In addition to all that, the new informational website will also host a special podcast dubbed “Vi snakker om spillet,” which translates to “We talk about the game.” As suggested by its title, the podcast will see experts talk about the gambling sector, providing audiences with insights into the experiences of former and recovering addicts.</p>
<p>StyrPåSpillet.dk is already live, allowing Danish consumers to learn more about the country’s gambling industry.</p>
<p>Denmark Seeks to Reduce Problem Gambling</p>
<p>The new informational website was launched in accordance with Denmark’s strategy to reduce problem gambling in the country.</p>
<p>In October, the Spillemyndigheden confirmed that the country’s self-exclusion system, ROFUS, will now cover land-based casinos and betting shops across the country. As a result, new registrants and registrants who have signed up after October 1 were allowed to benefit from exclusion from land-based gambling properties.</p>
<p>Denmark is bullish on enhancing its player protections and, under a new plan, will continue to crack down on harm.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the country introduced customized player IDs, further bolstering consumer protection. The customized IDs facilitate the withdrawal of winnings and the setting of deposing limits, while also safeguarding players from losing their winnings due to misplaced betting slips.</p>
