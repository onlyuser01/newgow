<p>Rafael Nadal and Casper Ruud go onto the main court of Stade Roland Garros on Sunday, June 5 to battle for the French Open title. If Nadal wins, it’s going to be his 22nd Grand Slam title. Oddsmakers sure seem to think he’s going to pull it off, but if Ruud upsets the odds, the 23-year-old will get ahold of his first major win.</p>

<p>Odds Keep Moving in Nadal’s Favor</p>
<p>Rafael Nadal, who’s turned 36 earlier this week, is the player with the most Grand Slam titles won in the Open Era. The Spaniard currently has 21 trophies in his collection, most of which were won in Paris. In fact, he’s the most successful player in the history of the French Open with 13 titles so far.</p>
<p>Not only does he have a fantastic portfolio, but Nadal has also been in superb form this season. In fact, since the start of 2022, the Spanish superstar is 29-3. His record could’ve been even better if it weren’t for injury troubles – he injured a rib in May after which he suffered his first loss of the season.</p>
<p>The injury also forced him to stay off the court for several weeks, disrupting his flow. Upon his return, Nadal failed to do much in two clay-court tournaments, getting knocked out in the early stages. However, since coming to Paris, he’s been nothing short of fabulous. His probably best performance was the one against The ATP no.1 Novak Djokovic in the quarterfinal.</p>
<p>Nadal entered the match as a betting underdog but then defeated his opponent 3-1. Next came the semifinal, which he won after Alexander Zverev got himself injured in the second set.</p>
<p>Ruud’s First Grand Slam Final</p>
<p>Casper Ruud is a rising star in the tennis universe, whose 2022 record is 30-9. This year, he’s won two tournaments – Geneva and Buenos Aires – both of which are played on the clay court.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, Ruud’s record on this surface is 21-5 in 2022, showing that, same as Nadal, he loves playing on clay. That fact is what’s making tennis fans think of him as a potential successor to Nadal. However, it seems that it’s still too early to think about that.</p>
<p>Ruud might be one of the best young players in the world, but he just isn’t on the same level as his 13 years older opponent.</p>
<p>Nadal vs Ruud Prediction</p>
<p>It would be a huge shock if Nadal didn’t win on Sunday. Everything seems to be going in his favor, which is why anything but an easy win would be a surprise.</p>
<p>Picks:</p>
<p>Rafael Nadal to win; under 34.5</p>
