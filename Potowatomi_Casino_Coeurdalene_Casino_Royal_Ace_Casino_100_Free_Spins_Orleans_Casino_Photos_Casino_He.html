<p>SBTech signs up with the Oregon State Lottery</p>
<p>Oregon refuses bids from Playtech, Scientific Games</p>
<p>Last-minute amendment could block mobile sports betting</p>
<p>The Oregon State Lottery is readying up for a September launch of the sports betting offer with the help of SBTech.</p>
<p>SBTech and Oregon Lottery Extend Partnership</p>
<p>iLottery supplier SBTech has signed a multi-year contract with the Oregon State Lottery. As a result, SBTech will be powering the retail and mobile sportsbook offering in the Beaver State. The moves comes just a few months ahead of the National Football League (NFL) season in September, which is tied to heighten betting activity and better windfall for business.</p>
<p>Oregon will also use this opportunity to roll out kiosks as soon as Q1, 2020, spreading the opportunities to place a wager in the state. Speaking to iGaming Business, a specialist edition focusing on the latest developments from the industry, a Lottery spokesperson had the following to say:</p>
<p>We’re excited about sports betting in general because it allows us to generate additional revenue for state programs without asking players of our current games to play or wager more.</p>
<p>SBTech Beats the Competition in Lottery Bid</p>
<p>SBTech is not an unlikely partner either. In 2018, the Lottery Commission examined a number of offers, including those of SBTech’s competitors such as Scientific Games (SG) and Playtech. Based on that examination alone, the Commission established that SBTech was the only company capable of meeting the set deadlines.</p>
<p>The background checks have been extensive to the point where Oregon State Police representatives visited the company’s headquarters in Sofia, Bulgaria. Having met the state’s regulatory requirements, SBTech should launch in September for the first time since 2007.</p>
<p>SBTech remains one of the largest sports platform suppliers to date. Focusing exclusively on the segment, whereas competitors are working in multiple verticals. SBTech has also renewed a multi-year partnership with ComeOn, a B2C Swedish gaming operator and a subsidiary of Cherry.</p>
<p>ComeOn and SBTech have teamed up ten years ago in 2009 and have been seeking closer business ties ever since.</p>
<p>Mobile Sports Betting Prohibited, a New Amendment Reveals</p>
<p>There are yet some issues that may need to be addressed. On Friday, June 7, Senator Mark Hass, brought up an amendment that if passed would throw a major in the works for both the Oregon State Lottery and SBTech. Here’s the text of the amendment:</p>
<p>“The Oregon State Lottery Commission may not offer a sports betting game unless tickets or shares for the game maybe purchased solely via equipment that is owned or leased by the Oregon State Lottery.”</p>
<p>Despite his draft, Hass is doubtful that the amendment would be passed as the regulators are already under the impression that mobile betting is an essential part of the future of the state’s lottery.</p>
