    <h1>Winstar Casino Texas Casino Albuquerque New Mexico Gate City Casino Austin Casino Casino In Iowa GVC</h1>

<p>Global betting and gaming operator GVC Holdings announced today the start of two new initiatives with regards to its Advanced Responsibility and Care (ARC) program for safer gambling, which began November 12.</p>
<p>Enhance Player Protection</p>
<p>The essence of the ARC is to improve player protection by utilizing the proprietary technology platform capabilities in terms of behavioral play data, and use real-time monitoring and analysis tools to allow for an early intervention in cases of gambling harm. To complement the ARC program, the group which is rebranding into Entain, signed partnership deals with Future Anthem and Mindway AI.</p>
<p>“As we set out last week with the launch of ARC, our new Safer Gambling programme, we are committed to leading the industry on safer gambling issues. Our proprietary technology provides us with unparalleled insight into player behaviour and we are now enhancing this capability by working with partners to provide additional scientific based insight.” Shay Segev, CEO, GVC Holdings</p>
<p>The agreement with Future Anthem will allow GVC to pilot the Anthem’s newly developed Anthemetrics Safer Play Responsible Gambling solution to boost GVC’s existing detection technology for earlier identification of problem gambling patterns.</p>
<p>“We are delighted to be working with a market-leader such as GVC, who have demonstrated their commitment to improving player safety and taking a science-led approach to player protection. We are excited to demonstrate how our Game Data Science solution will enable GVC to build on this approach, delivering even greater insight in to their player behaviours on casino games.” Leigh Nissim, CEO, Future Anthem</p>
<p>Introduce Neuroscience</p>
<p>GVC hopes to enhance its in-house capabilities by utilizing algorithms based on behavioral, neuro-scientific and academic learnings to pioneer a complex solution to minimize gambling harm. Partnering with the experts in neuroscience, neuroimaging and problem gambling Mindway AI, GVC will deploy the award –winning self-identification Gamalyze test to provide feedback to participants what influences decision-making, as well as advice and guidance on how gambling behavior can be kept under control.</p>
<p>“Over the past two years GVC have been at the forefront of tackling the issue of problem gambling and we are proud that they are piloting our Gamalyze self-test to provide their players’ with another tool to understand and stay in control of their gambling.” Rasmus Kjaergaard, CEO, Mindway AI</p>
<p>The announcement of the new initiatives by GVC followed the industry recognition the group received at the annual EGR industry awards, where GVC was named as “Safer Gambling Operator of the Year”. Along the ARC, GVC Holdings launched on November 12 a new strategy for sustainability, growth and innovation, as well as a new Sustainability Charter.</p>
<p>Subject to shareholder approval, GVC Holdings will rename as Entain Plc, as part of its total shift away from unregulated gaming markets.</p>
