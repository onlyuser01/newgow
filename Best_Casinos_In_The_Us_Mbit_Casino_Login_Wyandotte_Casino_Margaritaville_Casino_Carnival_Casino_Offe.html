<p>1×2 Network’s Branded Megaways mechanic continues to be one of the strongest sale pitches in the company’s arsenal. This time, 1×2 Network has decided to take Loto-Quebec’s experience to the next level, landing its unique offer to the operator.</p>
<p>Testing the Branded Megaways Mechanic as Engagement Tool</p>
<p>Thanks to this partnership, Loto-Quebec is expected to benefit from what is described as the “unique personality” of the Branded Megaways mechanic. Build to boost engagement and offer an experience that bucks trends, Megaways slots have long been a favorite with most players out there to whom the opportunity to win more has been front and center in any iGaming experience.</p>
<p>1×2 Network’s spin on the mechanic has taken this experience further. Company account manager and marketing director Rory Kimber have acknowledged the product’s strength in reaching customers and striking home with players:</p>
<p>“Branded Megaways slots offer an experience like no other, and it is great to see that the people of Quebec can now experience the edge of your seat thrills they provide combined with Loto-Québec’s brand.” 1×2 Network account manager and marketing director Rory Kimber</p>
<p>The partnership strengthens the existing relationship between Loto-Quebec and 1×2 Network and offers the opportunity to elevate the experience. Just recently, 1×2 Network introduced the Branded Megaways technology with RANT in a bid to customize the operator’s offer and add more variety to the available gameplay.</p>
<p>Bringing More to Players in the Form of Megaways</p>
<p>The latest tie-up with Loto-Quebec is a chance for the operator to bring an entertaining new product to its players and a good field test for 1×2 Network’s product and whether it has a future with audiences. Loto-Quebec seems to be mostly positive:</p>
<p>“By working with 1X2 Network and leveraging its Branded Megaways concept, we have been able to launch a truly unique slot for our players. Our Branded Megaways slot is a great addition to our growing online casino game portfolio.” Loto-Quebec</p>
<p>1×2 Network’s Iron Dog Studio develops the game under a license by Big Time Gaming, the original creators of the Megaways mechanic, which has been an absolute hit. The Branded Megaways game is capable of a 40,000x payout and comes with an average RTP of 96.2% per session.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, North America continues to challenge developers who will be looking to enter key jurisdictions quickly. Suppliers are already prepared to launch more convincingly in the United States, and Canada’s calls for iGaming regulation grow stronger. Loto-Quebec operates Espacejeux, which is the official province-controlled iGaming website where Branded Megaways will appear.</p>
