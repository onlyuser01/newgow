<p>Let’s preview the Atlanta Falcons vs. Arizona Cardinals Week 10 game, which is taking place at State Farm Stadium in Glendale on Sunday, November 12, 2023</p>
<p>The Atlanta Falcons vs. Arizona Cardinals is a duel between two struggling teams, but that exactly is the reason why we decided to preview this game. The Cardinals are 1-8 on the season, with six losses in a row, the last of which saw them score zero points.</p>
<p>But the good news for Arizona’s fans is that quarterback Kyler Murray is (probably) coming back in Week 10. The bad news for the Cards is that Murray’s return won’t help their defense, which is sixth from behind in the 2023 NFL.</p>
<p>Plus, this coming Sunday, they’re taking on the Falcons, whose offensive team has been in a good mood for scoring points lately.</p>

<p>Taylor Heinicke to Stay Atlanta Falcons Starting Quarterback in Week 10</p>
<p>Atlanta’s coach Arthur Smith put Taylor Heinicke in the role of the starting quarterback two weeks ago against the Tennessee Titans and the 30-year-old did okay, throwing for 175 and one touchdown. He helped his team score 23 points that day but that wasn’t enough for a win.</p>

<p>Smith kept him in the starting position in last week’s game, in which he threw for 268 yards and one TD. Unfortunately for Atlanta, that wasn’t enough to avoid losing 31-28 to the Minnesota Vikings.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the Falcons should be pleased with their offensive performances. In fact, they’ve been doing alright scoring-wise lately, with their average in the last five games being 20.8 points.</p>
<p>Arizona Cardinals Putting Their Hopes into Kyler Murray</p>
<p>Arizona’s crucial player Kyler Murray is expected to make his first appearance of the 2023 NFL season this coming Sunday. Without him to call the signals, the Cardinals have been dreadful offensively, scoring just 16.8 points per game on average.</p>
<p>As if that wasn’t bad enough, their average in the last three games is just 11.3. But those days might be over after Murray makes his comeback. Still, there’s a big question mark over whether the long-term hiatus has taken its toll on him.</p>
<p>He might not turn Arizona into a world-beater straight away, but our Falcons vs. Cardinals prediction is that Murray will up his team’s offensive numbers. Will that be enough for a win? It all depends on how Arizona’s defense performs on Sunday.</p>
<p>These guys have been horrible in 2023, allowing 26.7 points per game on average. They conceded 20 or more points in eight of the nine games they’ve played so far.</p>
<p>Atlanta Falcons vs. Arizona Cardinals Prediction</p>
<p>The fact that the Falcons are 4-5 in the 2023 season shows that they aren’t as bad as the Arizona Cardinals who are still on a single win (which happened back in September).</p>
<p>The Cards are likely to improve offensively once their first-choice QB Murray returns, but their defense will probably remain horrible until the end of the season.</p>
<p>That’s why our Falcons vs. Cardinals Week 10 prediction is that we’re going to see a lot of points, with the visitors being the ones to score more.</p>
