<p>According to the analysis cited by Casino.org, the White Paper Review will bring on a number of changes that are likely to suppress trading price for gambling companies which would, in turn, lead to further market consolidation – or at least would create the conditions in which such moves would be beneficial to the parties carrying them out.</p>
<p>Fat Wallets Required to Buy Some of the Big Assets in the Industry</p>
<p>This could put Caesars Entertainment in a pole position to secure at least one of Flutter’s assets, to name FanDuel, which is a prominent sportsbook in the market in the United States. But seeing it through would not be that easy as well. A sports betting jewel such as FanDuel would easily strain Caesars Entertainment’s war chest, as FanDuel is expected to fetch anything above $10 billion easily.</p>
<p>In fact, this could reach double the amount. Speculation that Caesars Entertainment may go after Flutter Entertainment though would have to be put to bed, as the current market capitalization of the would-be acquisition target is well beyond Caesars’ purchasing power presently.</p>
<p>But CFTN predicts that Caesars Entertainment isn’t the only company that may consider hunting for new spoils. Quite the opposite, Entain and MGM Resorts International may start their dance once again.</p>
<p>MGM Resorts International has already flatly declined that the company would be acquiring Entain and did not expect to change its outlook, but CFTN analysts may suggest otherwise. MGM could see the value of acquiring new assets and especially a company such as Entain which is a leader in the iGaming vertical where MGM Resorts International would want to develop quickly as well.</p>
<p>Speaking of potential pickings, the name 888 Holdings also came up in the CFTN assessment of the post-White Paper Review gambling industry. The paper could further trim the value of 888 Holdings shares which are somewhat depressed by the recent departure of now ex-CEO, Itai Pazner. Consolidation moves in the wake of big changes in the industry are not at all surprising.</p>
<p>Caesars Entertainment acquired the US assets of William Hill in 2021 for a sum total of $4 billion. The company has been moving well in both the sports betting and land-based casino verticals, but a further consolidation through the FanDuel brand could be a true jewel in its crown. Whether Caesars has the business nous and prowess to pull it off only time will show, though.</p>
