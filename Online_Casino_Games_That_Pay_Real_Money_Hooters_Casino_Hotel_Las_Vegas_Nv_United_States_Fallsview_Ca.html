    <h1>Online Casino Games That Pay Real Money Hooters Casino Hotel Las Vegas Nv United States Fallsview Ca</h1>

<p>What happened::I had a bonus of $129 usd deposited with 40x wager requirement ($5189 more or less) i have turned the $129 into $4000+ USD</p>
<p>and MET the ENTIRE wagering requirement of $5189 which is also MISLEADING CLAIM as well, because it's definitely NOT 40x but more like 200x!</p>
<p>as every bet counts only towards 20% of it's real value (ex: you place a $10 bet but in fact you counting only $2 towards the wagering rollover)</p>
<p>i have VIDEO PROOF of that and it will be presented here!</p>
<p>So this 40x/$5189 becomes almost $50.000,00 roll over, then !</p>
<p>Given this conditions.</p>
<p>But even though this INSANE rollover requirement, i still MET THEM ALL without LOSING a single cent, and won in the end a total of $3428.13</p>
<p>(have it ALL RECORDED IN VIDEO) and then after completing it, IMMEDIATELY MY WINNINGS BALANCE GOT REMOVED and i got left with only $129 USD, then!</p>
<p>I have it recorded IN VIDEO, at the time when the MONEY GOT REMOVED from my balance all together and left me with $99 USD !</p>
<p>Here's the image of the LAST BET made before the balance got disappeared/removed</p>
<p>Link to the image: https://ibb.co/vZ2s5SF</p>
<p>And the video link as well: https://streamable.com/5dlsna</p>
<p>What rights do they have to forfeit my entire WINNINGS balance BEYOND the initial deposit bonus, if i have wagered and completed their insane wagering requirement of $50.000/200x roll-over already, as well as the $3428.13 was WINNINGS and BALANCE made WITHOUT LOSING A SINGLE CENT OFF THE BONUS given, as well ?</p>
<p>Specially no rights to do this when clearly there are NO CLEAR BONUS TERMS written explicitly STATING that !</p>
<p>Like you can see here: https://help.bc.game/en/articles/8412942-a-comprehensive-guide-to-the-deposit-bonus-at-bc-game</p>
<p>it should have a clause CLEARLY saying something like: " All your winnings balance beyond your original deposit amount, will be 100% forfeited/voided and you will be left only with your original deposit in the end ! "</p>
<p>Besides that, to further STRENGHTEN my arguments against this sketchy behavior even more, on the image below you can CLEARLY SEE that on the ROLLOVER page of the bonus, it was stated that the $3428.13 IS 100% '' WITHDRAWABLE FUNDS ''</p>
<p>Here proof on this image: https://ibb.co/p3MH39y</p>
<p>So given this condition: I want my WINNINGS deposited back to my balance so i can withdraw!</p>
<p>I have fulfilled ALL the INSANE wagering requirements and it was super hard to achieve almost $50k worth of wagering at only 2% face value, with only a $129 initial bonus/deposit, so you can't simply take them away.</p>
<p>Payment Method: $129 USDT</p>
<p>Proof of Payment image: https://ibb.co/7y7sf26</p>

<p>Additional Notes: Clear contact with the operator/casino was attempted, and they initially stated would cooperate/invesgigate on the matter and to allow 24-48 hours to give a response, but the time has expired and no resolution whatsoever to the case, nor any responses further on the case were made by the operator/casino, and any further attempts of contact got IGNORED by them.</p>
<p>So i'm opening this complaint then to seek a peaceful resolution, which is the REINSTATEMENT of the WINNINGS balance of $3428.13 so i can withdraw what was RIGHTFULLY MINE, as i have met the WAGERING requirements successfully for the rollover, and accordingly with what was stated on the rollover page the $3428.13 was " WITHDRAWABLE FUNDS "</p>
<p>Here is the VIDEO PROOF of the issue happening LIVE https://streamable.com/5dlsna</p>
<p>(at the end of the video is the EXACT moment when they TOOK AWAY my balance after the wagering requirement has been accomplished/completed !)</p>
<p>On their terms there's NOTHING stating that we CANNOT keep the WITHDRAWABLE FUNDS from the rollover area as stated on the arguments above, as well as cannot withdraw our winnings AS PER THE LINK: https://help.bc.game/en/articles/8412942-a-comprehensive-guide-to-the-deposit-bonus-at-bc-game</p>
<p>So i seek for a peaceful resolution to this case against the operator/casino.</p>
