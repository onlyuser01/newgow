<p>Betano has acquired a license to launch digital sports betting in Germany and is preparing to launch betano.de in the near future.</p>
<p>Betano Acquires Sports Betting License in Germany</p>
<p>Leading digital sports betting operator Betano has acquired an operational license from the Darmstadt Regional Council. The license allows Betano to launch online sports betting operations in Germany.</p>
<p>Betano is one of many operators that have been granted sports betting licenses in the country, and more are sure to follow. Germany is currently in the process of issuing such licenses under the third amendment of its Interstate Treaty on Gambling.</p>
<p>The treaty’s core objectives are to enhance consumer protection throughout the country, prevent fraud in all forms and combat the gambling black market. Furthermore, the Interstate Treaty on Gambling places a particular focus on the prevention of problem gambling as well as the protection of minors. Under the treaty, gambling laws fall primarily in the competency of the 16 individual states. Federal legislation plays a comparatively limited role.</p>
<p>Betano To Launch Online Operations Soon</p>
<p>Betano, which is owned by powerhouse GameTech company Kaizen Gaming, has been active on the German market since 2018. Now that Betano is an officially licensed sports betting operator, the company is preparing for the launch of the German Betano brand. The operator will also incorporate the OASIS blocking engine, as required by German law.</p>
<p>All sports betting operators in the country are required to implement OASIS from the time of receiving an operational license. The system is used to prevent blocked players, such as minors, from engaging with the gambling content itself.</p>
<p>The country is set on regulating its booming gambling market in an attempt to prevent exploitation and curb the looming threat of problem gambling. Germany’s approach has received some criticism from the market itself, however. Last month, the Düsseldorf Institute for Competition Economics (DICE) warned against the proposed 8% gambling tax rate.</p>
<p>Betano Thrilled to Receive License, Voices Support for Regulation</p>
<p>According to Betano Germany Country Manager Clemens Kaiser, the digital sports betting operator was pleased to have received an operational license for the German market.</p>
<p>He also voiced his support for Germany’s decision to regulate the gambling market. Kaiser noted that every step toward regulation was beneficial to players as well as the actual operators themselves. He explained that the market now has a clearer set of rules to operate by. According to Kaiser, the current regulations and rules ensure player protection and public revenues for the state.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Kaiser said that Betano was looking forward to further growth in Germany. The company is also thrilled to offer quality services and entertainment in a responsible manner to its clients, he continued.</p>
<p>Betano is currently operational in Germany, Portugal, Romania as well as Brazil. Its parent company, Kaizen Gaming, is headquartered in Greece.</p>
