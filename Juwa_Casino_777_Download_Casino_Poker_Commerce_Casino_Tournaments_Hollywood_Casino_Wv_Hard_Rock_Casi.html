    <h1>Juwa Casino 777 Download Casino Poker Commerce Casino Tournaments Hollywood Casino Wv Hard Rock Casi</h1>

<p>They say a picture could be worth a thousand words. In the 21st century, there seems to be no better way to express one’s self than posting the right meme at the right moment. The institution of memes is big, and it has spawned online communities as big as 9gag and Imgur. Today, we take a look at the best gambling memes out there inspired by popular culture and giving you a throaty chuckle when you stumble upon them.</p>
<p>If you are having some qualms about your gambling habits, we are sure that there will be a gambling meme on our list to alleviate these concerns and make you feel right back at ease. Let’s have a look at today’s stock of witty memes about gambling.</p>
<ol>
<li>Barney Stinson (How I Met Your Mother)</li>
</ol>
<p>Our first gambling meme features Barney Simpson, a fictional womanizer from the 2000s ‘How I Met Your Mother’ who has not only written the ‘Playbook,’ a definitive guide on how to court women but has also come up with a solution for life’s every little jab.</p>
<p>When his boss was setting him up as a fall guy for his money-laundering operations, Barney was already a few moves ahead and working with the FBI.</p>
<p>On one occasion, Ted Mosby, Barney’s close friend in the show, suggests that Barney should just do nothing and focus on his gambling problems. Barney, though, just quips that it’s hardly gambling if you are “awesome” at it.</p>
<ol>
<li>Bender (Futurama)</li>
</ol>
<p>Bender Bending Rodríguez or Bender for short is a robot with an alcohol problem, a taste for the finer things in life, and admittedly blackjack.</p>
<p>Even though Bender never actually had a problem with gambling, one of the show’s most iconic moments has to do with Bender being tossed from the Luna Park, which is actually on the Moon as it’s now the 31st century.</p>
<p>As security kicks him out of the park, Bender turns angrily at the door and says his iconic phrase: “Fine, I am going to go build my own theme park with blackjack and hookers!”</p>
<p>The phrase is mentioned a few other times during the show, and each time Bender omits a bit of the phrase until there is only one word left. This is definitely one of the best gambling memes you will find out there, and you will appreciate it even more if you have a soft spot for Futurama.</p>
<ol>
<li>Stan (South Park)</li>
</ol>
<p>Gambling can be a lot of fun, but it just as well invites some risks. To best address these, you ought to be smart about your money. This is when Randy Marsh decides to take his son, Stan, to the local bank branch to deposit his first money.</p>
<p>Stan hands over the banknote to the bank cashier who enters it into the system and decides to invest it and just like the money is gone. The cashier spends a few seconds on his keyboard before announcing “… aaand it’s gone” to a flabbergasted Stan who has just lost his money.</p>
<p>While the episode has little to do with actual gambling, unlike the show’s Red Man’s Greed episode, it’s a funny way to remind yourself how risking your money can have serious consequences.</p>
<ol>
<li>Alan Garner (The Hangover)</li>
</ol>
<p>It was supposed to be one quick getaway before Doug Billings marries his beautiful spouse, Tracy. Doug decides to get his friends Phil and Stu, and Tracy’s brother Alan, on a trip to Las Vegas where things are about to get heated.</p>
<p>The quarter ends up out-of-their-minds when Alan mistakenly spikes his friends’ drinks but mixes up the dosage so nobody can remember what transpired the night before. Thankfully, Mike Tyson is there to inform them that they had stolen his tiger, which is now in their hotel room bathroom.</p>
<p>Things in this movie are packed with colorful anecdotes, but it’s especially fun when Alan mumbles his famous one-liner, “It’s not gambling if you are going to win,” which paired with his funny personality makes for a hilarious gambling meme.</p>
<ol>
<li>Marge Simpson (The Simpsons)</li>
</ol>
<p>The Simpsons have been a social critique of our times for years now and it’s one of the most iconic shows on television. It has exposed us to everything, from successfully predicting a global pandemic to calling the US Donald Trump presidency.</p>
<p>What The Simpsons didn’t expect was for one of the characters, well actually two of the characters, to make a great gambling meme. Being whisked away after a costly loss, Marge Simpson is accompanied by her husband Homer, who is oblivious of the issue.</p>
<p>Instead, Homer starts evoking mistakes he himself has made in the past, but excusing those with the phrase “You have a gambling problem!” It’s a good reminder that some things are well in our control but for others, we may need to seek out help from our loved ones.</p>
<p>Perhaps not Homer Simpson, though.</p>
<ol>
<li>James Bond (Casino Royale)</li>
</ol>
<p>James Bond has been frequenting casinos for decades and he has certainly had a few interesting anecdotes.</p>
<p>Yet, nothing is as intense and punchy as Casino Royale’s scene where 007, played by Daniel Craig, walks back from a poison attempt, after Le Chiffre, the movie’s villain, spiked his drink, almost costing him his life was it not for the swift intervention of Vesper played by Eva Green.</p>
<p>As Bond walks back to the table Le Chiffre is visibly surprised to see him well and breathing. 007 sits down and delivers his classy “Oh, I am sorry. That last hand nearly killed me.”</p>
<ol>
<li>Michael Jordan (Chicago Bulls)</li>
</ol>
<p>Michael Jordan is known for his success as one of the best basketball players of all time, but after his NBA success, MJ has had a bit of a wild run at the casinos.</p>
<p>His spending habits have piqued media interest and some suggesting that Air Jordan may be going a little too heavy on his gambling hobby.</p>
<p>That’s precisely what the man called it, saying that he didn’t have an issue with gambling, but rather that “it’s just a hobby.” This paired with his natural charisma gave rise to one of the best-known gambling memes out there.</p>
<ol>
<li>Cartman (South Park)</li>
</ol>
<p>When people think of gambling memes, they can’t help but bring up the ‘Make Love, Not Warcraft’ South Park episode featuring Cartman and his friends going a little overboard with their gaming habits.</p>
<p>While World of Warcraft is hardly a type of gambling, the game itself can be extremely addictive, so much that one of the loading screens in the game cautions players to “take everything in moderation, even World of Warcraft.”</p>
<p>In the episode, Cartman and his friends, Kyle, Stan, and Kenny, set out to tackle a feared enemy, a Warcraft character who has grown so strong that he is able to bend the game rules to his will.</p>
<p>In their pursuit of a solution, the boys decide to hide away from the man who apparently “has no life,” and start leveling up their characters by slaying low-level beasts to avoid detection.</p>
<p>Eventually, they all get sucked in by the game and become one of the most iconic memes on the Internet, which we generously consign to the category of the best gambling memes there are.</p>
<ol>
<li>Pikachu (Detective Pikachu)</li>
</ol>
<p>The Pokémon legacy has lived for ages and it’s still very much alive in Japan where Detective Pikachu (2019) reminded the world of how much everyone loves Ash Ketchum and his faithful companion.</p>
<p>Detective Pikachu, though, is another thing altogether, with the namesake character taking on some detective work. Yet, to keep himself going and creative juices flowing, Pikachu develops a taste for caffeine.</p>
<p>In one scene, Pikachu is confronted about his excessive drinking of coffee, to which he merely responds “I can stop whenever I want. These are just choices.”</p>
<p>It’s a fun reminder and definitely a worthy gambling meme, as it’s a reminder of how we tend to play down issues that may become a little too serious to control before long.</p>
<ol>
<li>Lloyd Christmas and Harry Dunne (Dumb &amp; Dumber)</li>
</ol>
<p>Alright, this one doesn’t exactly originate in the movie, but Dumb &amp; Dumber has given rise to quite a few worthwhile memes in its time, and it’s safe to say that gambling memes are on the list.</p>
<p>While this didn’t happen in the movie, our top gambling meme features Lloyd Christmas (Jim Carrey) and Harry Dunne (Jeff Daniels) who are on their way to a casino all cheerful and laughing.</p>
<p>In the next split screen though, they are “driving from the casino,” and they don’t seem too happy about it. The meme also features how live dealers feel about gambling, and it’s the exact opposite of players’ feelings.</p>
<p>It’s a witty little thing and true, if you were a live dealer at The Mirage you might appreciate it a wee bit more, but it’s funny nevertheless.</p>
