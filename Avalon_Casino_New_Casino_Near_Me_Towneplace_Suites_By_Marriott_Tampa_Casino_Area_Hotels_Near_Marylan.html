    <h1>Avalon Casino New Casino Near Me Towneplace Suites By Marriott Tampa Casino Area Hotels Near Marylan</h1>

<p>Dear sardapoor,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I want to inform you that we cannot make a case solely based on what you are describing.</p>
<p>I see several issues but I’m afraid none of them, on its own, would stand against the casino.</p>
<p>In regard to your unlucky streak: Sometimes you might get lucky and sometimes not; that's how casinos and casino games work. I would recommend reading our article about Payout ratio (RTP): https://casino.guru/learn-about-games-of-chance-rtp-variance.</p>
<p>If you have more information that would help our case, please forward it to me. Unfortunately, at this time, if we don’t have any evidence proving that something unfair is going on, there is nothing we can do. Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is anything else, I could do for you regarding your complaint.</p>
<p>In regard to your rejected payout: It has been put back to your account, played and lost.</p>
<p>In regard to your rejected bets: Please check the following https://www.schnellwetten.com/en/terms:</p>
<p>"The Operator is not liable for any downtime, server disruptions, lagging, or any technical or political disturbance to the Game play. Refunds may be given solely at the discretion of the management.</p>
<p>The Operator shall accept no liability for any damages or losses which are deemed or alleged to have arisen out of or in connection with Website or its content; including without limitation, delays or interruptions in operation or transmission, loss or corruption of data, communication or lines failure, any person's misuse of the site or its content or any errors or omissions in content.</p>
<p>In the event of a Casino system malfunction all wagers are void."</p>
<p>On what grounds do you request the exact amount of €1,500 to be refunded?</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
