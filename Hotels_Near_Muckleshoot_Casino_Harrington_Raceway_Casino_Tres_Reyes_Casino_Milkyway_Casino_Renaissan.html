<p>Super Slots Bonuses and Promotions</p>

<p>The Welcome Bonus</p>
<p>To get you started, Super Slots will extend a massive $6,000 welcome bonus for you to try. Players are able to grab a sizable bonus amount along with 100 Free Spins they can use on Captain’s Quest Treasure Island, a fantastic slot game to get you introduced to the hundreds of slots that await. To trigger the bonus, you will need to use the Super Slots Casino bonus codes for each of the six deposits. The first deposit bonus is a 250% match up to $1,000. It’s activated with the SS250 promo code.</p>
<p>The next five deposits are 100% match bonuses up to $1,000, activated with the SS100 promo code. All of these six deposits form the $6,000 welcome package. The wagering requirement is 35x and applies to the deposit and the bonus amount before you may withdraw any of your winnings.</p>

<p>Super Slots also reminds you that the free spins that apply to Captain’s Quest Treasure Island slot must be played through in the 14 days after receiving the bonus. The maximum amount you may win from the free spins is set at $100.</p>

<p>Is There a Super Slots Casino Cashback Bonus?</p>
<p>Yes, as you can expect Super Slots Casino does have a cashback bonus which will help you mitigate some of your losses. The casino extends a 10% rebate based on your sessions between Monday and Thursday, with up to $250 repaid back to players who end the week with a losing record. It’s a nice way to offset some potential losses. In order to qualify, however, your losses need to be equal to or exceed $1,000.</p>
<p>400% Crypto Bonus</p>
<p>Super Slots Casino features a fantastic bonus available for crypto enthusiasts. Players who wish to deposit and withdraw with cryptocurrencies can do so at Super Slots, and they can claim a fitting bonus to go hand-in-hand with this.</p>
<p>The bonus offers a 400% match amount up to $4,000 claimed and activated with the promo code CRYPTO400. Players can trigger the bonus with a minimum amount of $20. The playthrough requirement is 48x, but the bonus is not available for the Live Dealer Casino. The maximum winnings are capped at $10,000 and you can redeem it within 30 days of registration.</p>
<p>Overall, the 400% Crypto Bonus is suited for high rollers at Super Slots Casino. If you think you will be placing sizeable bets on individual rounds or want to get a little more cryptocurrency casino balance, this is one way to do it.</p>
<p>Super Slots Casino Games</p>
<p>Super Slots Casino offers more than 200 games to players. The casino is powered by a range of household supplier names, including Betsoft, Rival Gaming, Visionary Gaming, Nucleus Gaming, and others.</p>
<p>You will be able to navigate the full portfolio of games with ease picking from slots, blackjack, table games, live casino, video poker, and specialty games. The selection is quite extensive and one of the best we have seen at any online casino.</p>
<p>Slots</p>
<p>We were naturally excited to try the slot games available at Super Slots Casino as part of our review. There is a hefty selection of titles to try and when we checked, Super Slots was offering more than 140 slot games. Amongst them are games by Betsoft, which is known for its outstanding 3D game designs and captivating gameplay.</p>
<p>Our team was pleased to discover a number of high-RTP and jackpot slots across the board, with games such as Jungle Stripes, Book of Darkness, Wolf Moon Rising, Tower of Fortuna, The Wild Show and Take the Bank just among some of the games that you can enjoy.</p>
<p>There is a lot to Super Slots’ games in this section. They are all distinct achievements, with Betsoft sparing no effort in creating fantastic games that stand out by virtue of their graphics and gameplay, and not least – payouts. Awesome games such as A Night in Paris and Dr. Jekyll &amp; Mr. Hyde are bound to stick with us for many play sessions, and there are constantly new additions.</p>
<p>Table Games</p>
<p>Table games are another significant part of the experience you will discover at Super Slots Casino. Players are welcome to have a pick from 40-odd titles that are there to bring them outstanding options, from Zoom Roulette to Casino War.</p>
<p>We found the selection to be nicely varied, which is refreshing to see at a casino. As players, we tried Three Card Rummy, Pontoon, Triple Edge Poker, Pirate 21, Craps, Pai Gow Poker, Multi-hand Blackjack, Oasis Poker, Caribbean Poker, American Blackjack, Pirate 21, Red Dog, and others.</p>
<p>One thing we truly loved about the experience here was the betting limits. Compared to other casinos, the table games offer some excellent betting limits, ranging from $1 – $10,000. Of course, these limits will vary across the individual games, but you can definitely discover quite a few of these.</p>
<p>All in all, we haven’t found any blemishes with the table games selection at Super Slots Casino, and feel like you may like them as well, especially if you are a US player looking for more flexible gaming options.</p>
<p>Video Poker</p>
<p>Video poker is another massive part of the casino experience. Players will discover 13 video poker games available as part of the experience on Super Slots. We have reviewed all of them naturally and are satisfied with the results. There are tons of high-paying games to pick from here.</p>
<p>Super Slots will bring you some hard-hitting classics, such as Jacks or Better, Bonus Deuces, Deuces and Joker Poker, All American, Bonus Poker, Five Draw Poker, Tens or Better, Split Way Royale, Joker Poker, and more. There are other variants to try as well – with multi-hand options letting you play more than one hand per round if you are happy with this.</p>
<p>The betting limits are pretty generous as well, and you can bet anything between $1 and $100. We are very happy with the video poker games we found at Super Slots. They offer excellent payouts and the opportunity to choose a game that is right for you.</p>
<p>Live Dealer Games</p>
<p>Live dealer games? Yes, please! Super Slots Casino clearly goes the extra mile in hooking you up with some spot-on live casino experiences. Players will have the chance to play excellent games supported across two live casino lobbies. One of those is the Black Casino by Fresh Deck Studios and the other is the Red Casino by Visionary iGaming.</p>
<p>Both are excellent ways to enjoy yourself when playing. Some of the games though will be available only in one casino or the other. American Roulette, European Roulette, and Baccarat, for example, can be played across both the Red and Black casinos, but some games, such as Blackjack Early Payout, Auto American Roulette, Super 6, Blackjack HD Exclusive, Auto European Roulette can be played in Red.</p>
<p>Black offers BJ Baltic, BJ Russian, and BJ VIP, which are nice games to have a shot at. The betting ranges will vary between $0.50 and $2,500. Our review of both the Red and Black Super Slots Casino proved to be worthwhile, as all the games we play-tested ran smoothly and offered high-quality graphics and flexible betting limits.</p>
<p>Banking Methods</p>
<p>Reviewing the Super Slots banking and payment methods was very fun and easy indeed. We love transparency in casinos and when we see websites such as Super Slots offer us all the details that we need without the extra hassle of looking – we are definitely inclined to give them an A+.</p>
<p>Yet, we made sure to test the entire selection of deposit and withdrawal options to make sure that you will indeed get what you have come looking for. Players can rest assured that there is plenty to see and try here, with flexible deposits and withdrawals, making for a fun and easy way to cash out your money. Let’s take a closer look.</p>
<p>Deposits</p>
<p>Alright, let’s take it from the top. The deposit options are definitely worthwhile, and they make the entire process of topping up your account quite easy and straightforward. You have options such as credit cards, cryptocurrencies, and alternative methods. Here is what we mean:</p>
<p>Method Min Deposit Max Deposit Bitcoin $20 $100,000 Avalanche $20 $100,000 Binance $20 $100,000 BitcoinCash $20 $100,000 Cardano $20 $100,000 Dogecoin $20 $100,000 Ethereum $20 $100,000 Litecoin $20 $100,000 Polygon $20 $100,000 Ripple $20 $100,000 Shiba Inu $20 $100,000 Solana $20 $100,000 Stellar $20 $100,000 Tether $20 $100,000 Tron $20 $100,000 USD Coin $20 $100,000 MasterCard $25 $2,500 American Express $25 $2,500 Discover $25 $2,500 Visa $25 $2,500 Person to Person $10 $600 Money Order $300 $9,000 Bank Wire Transfer $500 $10,000 Cashier’s Check $1,500 $10,000</p>
<p>As you can see, there are quite a few deposit options you may use to top up your account at Super Slots. We have reviewed these payment methods and have concluded that they are all fast and reliable.</p>
<p>Cards and cryptocurrencies tend to be fastest when you seek to deposit, but some, such as cashier’s checks or bank wire transfers can actually take a while – usually between 2-5 business days. Overall, we are definitely happy with the deposit methods here. They offer a nice mix of speed and available amounts to choose from.</p>
<p>Withdrawals</p>
<p>Method Min Withdrawal Max Withdrawal Bitcoin $50 $100,000 Avalanche $20 $100,000 Binance $20 $100,000 BitcoinCash $20 $100,000 Cardano $20 $100,000 Dogecoin $20 $100,000 Ethereum $50 $100,000 Litecoin $20 $100,000 Polygon $20 $100,000 Ripple $20 $100,000 Shiba Inu $50 $100,000 Solana $20 $100,000 Stellar $20 $100,000 Tether $50 $100,000 Tron $50 $100,000 USD Coin $50 $100,000 MoneyOrder $500 $3,000 Bank Wire Transfer $500 $2,500 Check by Courier $500 $2,500 Person to Person $50 $400</p>
<p>So, when it comes to withdrawals, you can rest assured that Super Slots will sort you out quickly. However, there is a small snag. If you want to cash out more than $3,000, you need to use a non-fiat payment method, i.e. a cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>We generally recommend players use cryptocurrencies anyway. With a maximum withdrawal capped at $100,000 per transaction for methods such as Bitcoin, you will have no trouble cashing out any sum of winnings and the fees will be less.</p>
<p>Whatever payment method you choose in the end, we are confident you will receive a great experience and enjoy your banking experience at Super Slots.</p>
<p>Super Slots Casino Mobile Experience</p>
<p>Super Slots Casino doesn’t have a dedicated Android or iOS app, but its website is fully optimized for mobile and runs smoothly on every device and operating system combo we ran. The casino did well across the board and offered native resolutions for all devices we tried.</p>
<p>We were surprised to find an online casino for real money in the United States that was so user friendly and easy to use across the board. It was quick to navigate around the casino from handheld devices so we definitely appreciate the effort the developers put in to make the experience as intuitive as possible.</p>
<p>The site’s full functionalities worked well across the board, from customer support to the live casino, and we can definitely recommend Super Slots Casino as a place to try on your mobile device.</p>
<p>Customer Support</p>
<p>From extensive testing, we found that the customer support team at Super Slots Casino is very competent. Regardless if it’s via email or live chat, players are able to get in touch 24/7 to solve any issues they experience.</p>
<p>When we tried getting hold of support, we received answers immediately through the live chat channel, and within an hour for the email service. Overall, email is much slower, but it’s an efficient way to solve any issues you have without requiring your constant attention.</p>
<p>The only thing we found lacking is phone support, which is somewhat understandable as a Panama-based casino. However, it could add tremendous value to the Super Slots Casino brand, especially if done well.</p>
