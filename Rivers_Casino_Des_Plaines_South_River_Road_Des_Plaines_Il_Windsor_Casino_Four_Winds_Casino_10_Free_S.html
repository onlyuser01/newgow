    <h1>Rivers Casino Des Plaines South River Road Des Plaines Il Windsor Casino Four Winds Casino 10 Free S</h1>

<p>Good day Guru team, I'm writing today to show you the real side of Aussie Slots and Viper Spin Casino.</p>
<p>Also anyone wanting evidence of this and them saying my funds are safe and I would get it if I give the new licence, email me at Joobsclan@gmail.com, happy to show everyone and anyone.</p>
<p>Around the middle of last year (2022), I had played on viper spin because I trusted Aussieslots.</p>
<p>I had accumulated over 120k and played it down to 100k. During this 2-3 week period I was trying to get my account verified using my Australian licence. My licence was 100% legal and still is till today. They refused to accept my licence and told me to get a new one with my updated licences. (In aus they put all your licences on 1 card , so if 1 licence expired but the rest are still in date, it is a legal for of identification. Which is the case here. I even supplied my passport as a form of ID along with my licence. They wouldn't even look at it.</p>
<p>I reached out to Aussie slots to help and they assured me I will get my winnings and just to get the new Card because the casino doesn't want to budge... at that time I was only trying to withdraw around 1-3k as I hadn't made the 100k yet.</p>
<p>Then I applied for the new Card, I formed them it would take 3 weeks which it did. With in 2 week I built the account upto 100k and left it there. They assured me my money would be safe providing I gave them my licence. Before my licence even arrived, they took my account away and refused to respond to me. I then tried getting a password reset or something by entering in my details again which ended up making a new account that I never ever used and didn't even verify the email.</p>
<p>Aussie slots tried sorting this out for me and explained to them what I was trying to do.</p>
<p>I then got my new licence, provided it to them and no joke, the licence is basically the same, they just took 1 licence of the card (which was my learners), same photo, same numbers, same card with out my learners on it. I was ignored ...</p>
<p>I made a post to guru previously where I was then contacted by aussieslots 2 days after on behalf of the casino. He said take it down or tell guru i have been paid in order to get my winnings. So im complied (when I shouldn't have)</p>
<p>They then told me to make a new account and get it verified so they can pay me 5k a week into that account. So I got it verified. Then they messed around and didn't pay me for months. I asked Aussie what the go is and he wouldn't be straight up with me. He would sometimes ignore me too. Eventually Aussie told me that the casino won't pay because I have a Duplicate account, how ever I only played on a second account to get it verified when they told me to make it as they can't give my original with the money in it back. I have screenshots of where they asked me to remove my complaint and so on. So in short, they told me to tell guru I have been paid when I wasn't to get the money, then they told me to make a new account and verify it, then they said sorry you gambled on a duplicate, so we not paying you. But then why verify my account if I have a duplicate? Don't they take both away? I have tried asking the Aussie slots community to bind together and help me, how ever my post keeps getting taken down by Aussie slots as he doesn't want the community to know that they have scammed me. I have since been removed from the community. How ever what they forget is that I have made a few friends with in there that arnt exactly impressed about being scammed either. I have shed light to a few people who won't be using viper or following Aussie again. And by the way, they contacted me to find out how I was scammed. So I showed them. And they are just as angry and say they can't be trusted at all.</p>
<p>I even offered them to keep 20k and pay me 80k for the inconvenience. They still refuse to talk to me.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that this all started because they wouldn't accept my legal form of ID, then they took my winning away because I had won too much... they were ok when my account was at 2k. But when I hit 100k they decided to be thieves. That money is rightfully mine. I played and won it fair and square.</p>
<p>I did everything they asked me to do, and they used that to thier advantage to scam me. They must own uo to thoer mistakes. Im still happy to accept 80k instead of the 100k should they wish to settle this. As I will not stop till something comes of it.</p>
<p>They told me my account would be safe and my finds too providing I gave them the new licence, which I did. And they refused to pay. That's when I went to guru, then they came to me again to tell me to make the new account and tell guru that I have been paid to get the winnings.</p>
<p>Also bare in mind, I shared the new licence before going to guru and also making the new verified account. I went to guru as they were not complying . L</p>
