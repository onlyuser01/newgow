<p>The sportsbook has become the official partner to the prominent soccer club in Africa</p>
<p>Mojabet will be a betting partner in the period between 2022-2028 and help Olympique de Marseille further establish its footprint across the African region. The operator is one of the most prominent betting and gaming companies in the market and has amassed a significant presence.</p>
<p>Boosting Fan Experiences and Engagements</p>
<p>The tie-up with Olympique de Marseille will further help strengthen the operator’s online offering with African sports fans, the companies say. The partnership allows the two partners to drive fan-friendly engagement that is placed within the responsible gaming culture, as well as expand on an international scale.</p>
<p>Mojabet and Olympique de Marseille’s fans will be able to benefit from excellent synergies between the two powerful networks and reap the benefits of this tier-one collaboration which is set with the future in mind.</p>
<p>To celebrate this new opportunity, Mojabet has launched the OM8 competition which will see sports fans answer eight questions once a week for a chance to win a cash prize and a range of authentic OM memorabilia. This game is going to launch on Sunday and coincides with the game that Olympique Marseille will play against Paris Saint-Germain.</p>
<p>The partnership will also see Mojabet brand assets and signage across LED screens and across social media channels. Commenting on this opportunity, MOJA Group CEO Paris Anatolitis said that Olympique de Marseille is one of the world’s best-known clubs:</p>

<p>The OM8 competition is just a preview of what is to follow as part of the collaborative efforts put in by Marseille de Olympique and Mojabet. Olympique de Marseille strategy &amp; development general manager Pedro Iriondo was similarly pleased with the opportunity presented by the partnership.</p>
<p>“We are delighted to welcome Mojabet as a regional betting partner in Africa,” Iriondo explained. He confirmed that the opportunity with Mojabet will significantly allow the brand to expand its player base in the continent, and the club is now looking forward to working together with the operator.</p>
