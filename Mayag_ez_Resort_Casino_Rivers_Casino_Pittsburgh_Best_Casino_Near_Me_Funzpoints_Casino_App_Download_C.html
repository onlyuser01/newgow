    <h1>Mayag ez Resort Casino Rivers Casino Pittsburgh Best Casino Near Me Funzpoints Casino App Download C</h1>

<p>So I deposited and bcgame has yet to post it to the account after complaining numerous times over the period of 2 days. Then I make a deposit of 54 dollars and I starter winning. I got up to about 100 dollars and while I am playing, someone else withdrawals 2 times. One time for 74 dollars and another time for 23 dollars. While I was in the middle of playing a game!!! I was spinning as I watched my balance go to 0!!! Then my balance went from 0 tp 53 dollars!!! Then all the sudden my balance dropped down again to 0. I complained about this to staff and they said there was nothing they could do. How can no security flags be activated when the owner is in the middle of a game and another ip address logs in at the same time? How insecure can the system be? They suggested I enable 2fa. Then I inquire about the ip address of the thief and they refused to give it to me!!! They are enabling the thief to get away with my crypto! They told me they wouldn't give me the ip address. This makes them an accompliss to the crime Then. What kind of business allows the thief to remain anonymous and just take what they want? Here is the proof in chat:</p>
<p>Other platforms do not allow this kind of stuff</p>
<p>Why does yours</p>
<p>Why didn't the withdrawals trigger security flags</p>
<p>And I need to know the ip address</p>
<p>Of the person who withdrawal the last 2 withdrawals</p>
<p>We do not provide IP addresses.</p>
<p>And how did after those 2 withdrawals were made did my account all the sudden have 53 dollars</p>
<p>And then it disappear</p>
<p>Yes you do provide ip addresses</p>
<p>The system allows me to see who logs into my account</p>
<p>Someone stole my eth</p>
<p>User have their details and they should always check for their account safety.</p>
<p>Stole it</p>
<p>Illegally</p>
<p>They stole money that I put into your account for my gamss</p>
<p>Games</p>
<p>And I am legally entitled to know the ip address since my funds were illegally stolen</p>
<p>You denying me the right to information that would bring justice is being an accomplis</p>
<p>Accomplice</p>
<p>You denying me the right to seek justice enables thieves to steal your customers crypto</p>
<p>You will provide the ip address</p>
<p>If you don't you are enabling it</p>
<p>And enabling people to steal crypto is illegal</p>
<p>Because you might as well be stealing it yourself by protecting them</p>
<p>Do not hide the identity of the one who stole my eth</p>
<p>It's bad enough your system allows hackers to log into people's accounts while they are playing and in the middle of spinning, allows another person to withdrawal crypto</p>
<p>The fact that this didn't trigger some kind of security like booting one of us off when another is playing is ridiculous</p>
<p>Do you want me to file a complaint all over dozens of sites exposing the fact that people can withdrawal while you are playing</p>
<p>And tell people you will hide the identity of people who steal our crypto</p>
<p>You will not comply with my right to seek justice and obtain the identity of the person who stole my crypto?</p>
<p>And you will ignore my request?</p>
<p>You will protect them from the person who they stole from?</p>
<p>No response still....</p>
