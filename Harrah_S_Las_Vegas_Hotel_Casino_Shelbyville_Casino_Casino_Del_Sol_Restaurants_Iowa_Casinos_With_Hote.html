<p>Adda52.com, the gambling firm behind what it claims to be “the best card game site in India,” has announced an extension of its co-sponsorship deal with FC Goa. The operator is seeking to expand its presence in professional soccer and promote the sport.</p>
<p>FC Goa Still has Adda52’s Backing</p>
<p>Adda52’s goal is to improve its sports footprint while nurturing the pro sports ecosystem. It believes that soccer is one of the best skill-based sports and compared its complexity with that of poker.</p>
<p>In an official statement, the Indian operator explained that while they seem simple on the surface, both poker and soccer require a profound understanding of the game and polished skills to play at a pro level. It emphasized that to be a professional at any, one would need to have the “mental fortitude” to withstand the pressure, as well as the cunning to read the opponent’s mind.</p>
<p>Because of that, Adda52 is happy to continue supporting FC Goa and show its commitment to Indian soccer. This agreement extension will notably see the operator support the club for the third consecutive Indian Super League (ISL) season.</p>
<p>The Soccer Club Is Happy to Have Adda52 by Its Side</p>
<p>Both parties addressed the renewed agreement. Ravi Puskur, FC Goa’s vice president, noted that the upcoming ISL season is surely going to be a very exciting one. Because of that, he is happy to have the backing of an influential local brand such as Adda52.</p>
<p>Puskur concluded that he appreciates the partnership with the operator and hopes that there would be more future opportunities for the two parties to work together.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Krishnendu Guha, Adda52.com’s chief revenue officer, said that his team remains adamant about supporting pro sports in every way it can. Guha noted that games are more than just a pastime. In his words, all types of skill games are a way of life. His team is, therefore, committed to offering its full support to the pro sports ecosystem and FC Goa in particular.</p>
<p>Adda52.com is honored to join hands with FC Goa as a sponsor and help the team on its path to become a source of talent for the national team. The new season has begun and we can’t wait to watch FC Goa win the championship. Krishnendu Guha, CRO, Adda52</p>
<p>Adda52 is ambitious of nurturing FC Goa into a professional team that supplies players to India’s national team. Its dedication to sports, however, doesn’t end here as the company has other existing agreements with teams and organizations from other sports as well.</p>
<p>In June, Delta Corp, the ownership company of Adda52’s parent firm, Gaussian Network, opened a new casino resort in South Goa. The property opened its doors to gamblers on June 2, attesting to the company’s growth drive.</p>
