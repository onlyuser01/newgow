<p>Last month, the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario (AGCO) confirmed that iGaming activities in the province will launch on April 4, 2021. However, before launching their activities, operators would need to receive approval from the regulator. Earlier this week, the AGCO greenlighted two operators that will be able to launch their services in April.</p>
<p>Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario Grants PointsBet Canada License</p>
<p>One of the first operators to receive a license by the regulator in Ontario is PointsBet. As a result, PointsBet Canada became a licensed sportsbook in Ontario. The operator will be able to launch its services as soon as the province’s iGaming market opens.</p>
<p>“We look forward to applying our expertise from Australia and the United States to help build a trusted, competitive, regulated iGaming market in Ontario, establishing an important foundation for our nation.” Chantal Cipriano, VP of legal, compliance and people at PointsBet Canada</p>
<p>PointsBet Canada’s VP of legal, compliance and people, Chantal Cipriano, said that the company is proud to be among the first operators to receive a license by the AGCO. She explained that the green light demonstrates the regulator’s trust that PointsBet can deliver a safe, innovative and responsible experience for Ontario residents. In conclusion, Cipriano outlined that the company is looking forward to growing and helping develop a competitive and trusted iGaming market in Ontario.</p>
<p>“Today’s approval of PointsBet Canada as a licensed sportsbook in Ontario effective April 4, 2022, is a momentous step in unveiling our authentically Canadian gaming experience to the province.” Scott Vanderwel, CEO at PointsBet Canada</p>
<p>PointsBet Canada’s CEO, Scott Vanderwel, outlined that the company followed through on its promise to build “a Canadian sportsbook, with Canadian employees, for the Canadian market.” He said that thanks to the approval, in less than 60 days, PointsBet Canada will be able to bring its easy-to-use platform that offers unmatched speed and in-game betting capabilities.</p>
<p>theScore Bet Receives Internet Gaming Operator Certificate</p>
<p>Besides PointsBet, theScore Bet, which is Penn National Gaming’s subsidiary, announced that it achieved registration as an internet gaming operator with the AGCO earlier this week. This marks another regulator requirement that the operator needed to achieve in preparation for offering its sports betting and iGaming services in the province.</p>
<p>“We’re thrilled to be one of the first operators to receive an internet gaming operator certificate of registration from the AGCO as we prepare for Ontario’s new regulated market.” John Levy, CEO at theScore</p>
<p>theScore’s CEO, John Levy, said that receiving an internet gaming operator certificate marks an exciting moment for the company on its way to preparing to launch its operations in Ontario. He explained that bringing theScore on April 4 to the company’s home market is incredibly exciting. In conclusion, Levy outlined that the countdown to launch has finally begun.</p>
