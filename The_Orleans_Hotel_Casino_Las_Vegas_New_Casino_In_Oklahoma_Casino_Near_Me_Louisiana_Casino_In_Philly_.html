<p>Parx Casino launches a new digital sportsbook in NJ.</p>
<p>GAN will be operating the new online sportsbook.</p>
<p>Parx Casino in Bensalem is extending its footprint beyond Pennsylvania with the recent launch of an online gambling operation in New Jersey. This does not come as much of a surprise since New Jersey has one of the biggest and most lucrative gambling markets in the United States. This is especially true for its sports betting market. That said, most casinos in the state have invested in both retail and online sports betting offerings. Parx is just the latest or most recent entrant into that space.</p>
<p>The Greenwood Gaming &amp; Entertainment-owned Parx Casino made the announcement about its venture into the new market this week. However, the online sports betting operation officially went live last Friday after it successfully passed a three-day soft-launch phase. This soft-launch phase was seen by the state’s gaming regulators.</p>
<p>Already, the gaming operator’s newly launched digital sports betting platform is fully operational. Residents of the state are therefore now able to place sports bets using a wide range of devices from anywhere within the state’s borders.</p>
<p>Partnership with GAN</p>
<p>For the New Jersey operation, Greenwood Gaming &amp; Entertainment Inc. will be extending its partnership with GAN. The gaming solutions provider will be powering the digital sportsbook and its operations. After launching what is arguably the largest gambling facility in Pennsylvania, the next logical step was to find more ways of capitalizing on the rapidly growing gambling industry in the country. New Jersey was, therefore, undoubtedly a great choice.</p>
<p>“This represents an incremental revenue opportunity for GAN and is a logical extension of our technology infrastructure to serve Parx Casino patrons who routinely cross the invisible border between these two populous states,” GAN Chief Executive Dermot Smurfit said.</p>
<p>Greenwood Gaming &amp; Entertainment is very happy about its existing partnership with GAN. According to John Dixon, the company’s CEO, GAN has demonstrated unmatched abilities to serve their business needs across several states. This “aligns with the cross-border nature of our existing retail gaming customer base.”</p>
<p>More on Parx Casino and Racing</p>
<p>Parx Casino is perhaps the most popular gaming operation in Pennsylvania which boasts of several great gambling venues. The Bensalem-based gambling establishment began operating as horse racing track and has since grown into a behemoth gambling facility with up to 3,330 slot machines, 180 table games as well as a poker room.</p>
<p>The casino’s sportsbook went live in January 2019 and was followed with the launch of a digital sportsbook in June. Both sports betting verticals have performed quite well in the Keystone State hence the motivation to venture out to other markets. In New Jersey, Parx will be joining 15 other online sports betting operations. The competition will definitely be tight but we have to wait and see how things play out in the long run.</p>
