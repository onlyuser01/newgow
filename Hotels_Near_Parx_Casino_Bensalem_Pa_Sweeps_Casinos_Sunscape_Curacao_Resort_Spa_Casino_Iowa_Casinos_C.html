<p>Two young suspects are under arrest for last month’s hit-and-run collision that killed a retired California police chief as he rode a bicycle on a Las Vegas street.</p>

<p>The driver, with a passenger at his side, intentionally drove into Andreas “Andy” Probst, 64, during the August 14 incident, according to Las Vegas cops. Probst was the retired chief of the Bell, Calif. police department.</p>
<p>The traffic fatality took place at about 6 a.m. near the intersection of Tenaya Way and Centennial Parkway, located about 16 miles from the Las Vegas Strip.</p>
<p>Upon seeing Probst, one of the teens asked the other if he was “ready.”</p>
<p>The individuals pulled directly behind Probst and ran him over, as they fled the scene and laughed,” the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department (LVMPD) said in a recent statement quoted by NBC News.</p>
<p>A video of the incident recorded by the passenger in the car revealed one of the suspects said, “Yeah, yeah, yeah hit his a**,” moments before the crash.</p>
<p>The car then struck the back of the bicycle, hurling Probst backward onto the car’s windshield and hood before he landed on the pavement. He suffered critical injuries, and a short time later, was declared dead at University Medical Center.</p>

<p>Las Vegas prosecutors have made the case a priority.</p>
<p>I am confident that justice will be served in this matter once the investigation is complete and the appropriate charges have been filed,” Clark County District Attorney Steve Wolfson said in a recent statement.</p>
<p>Las Vegas prosecutors want to charge the unnamed 17-year-old driver of the car as an adult. The car he was driving when it struck Probst turned out to be a stolen Hyundai, police said.</p>
<p>The 17-year-old was apprehended and charged with murder for the collision. He remains in custody and more charges are possible, prosecutors said on Monday, according to Las Vegas TV station KLAS.</p>
<p>A passenger in the car was also arrested. That teenager will also be charged with murder, authorities said this week.</p>
<p>Both suspects were being held in Clark County Juvenile Hall this week.</p>
<p>The crime led to widespread condemnation.</p>
<p>“We are devastated by the senseless murder of Andy,” Probst’s daughter, Taylor Probst, was quoted by KLAS. “Andy’s life was robbed by two individuals who did not believe that the lives of others matter.”</p>
<p>Other Crimes</p>
<p>The teens are also suspects in numerous other crimes, authorities said.</p>
<p>It was revealed that these “individuals were also involved in an additional hit-and-run of a bicyclist prior to killing Probst,” NBC News reported, based on police reports.</p>
<p>The victim in that incident, which took place about a half hour before the one involving the police chief, was a 72-year-old male bicyclist, according to KLAS. The earlier collision took place on Fort Apache Road near Washburn Road in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>The two teens were in the same car when it crashed into a Toyota Corolla on U.S. 95 shortly before they drove into Probst, police said.</p>
<p>The duo allegedly stole at least four cars before they went on the crime spree, authorities said.</p>
