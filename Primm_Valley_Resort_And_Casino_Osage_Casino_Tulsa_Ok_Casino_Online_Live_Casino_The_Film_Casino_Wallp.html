<p>Blueprint Gaming has become the latest company to obtain a license from the Swedish Gambling Authority, or Spelinspektionen, the company confirmed in a press statement shared with Casino Guru News via email. The supplier of prominent content has been moving rapidly across European markets, and the latest licensure in Sweden reflects its commitment towards regulated and established markets.</p>
<p>The new accreditation is mandated as part of legislative changes that were voted on and approved in November 2022, and that will be coming into effect on July 1, 2023. Blueprint Director of Operations Thomas O’Halleran has welcomed the opportunity to see Blueprint Gaming continue to provide its product in the highly-coveted market, arguing that the supplier was delighted to continue supplying its products in the market.</p>
<p>"This new approval allows us to continue our growth and development of content that Swedish players will continue to enjoy and return to," O’Halleran said. Blueprint Gaming will continue to deliver a number of its excellent games in the region, including Rise of Atlantis, Bison Rising Megaways, and others.</p>
<p>Over the past several days and weeks, many suppliers in the iGaming industry have been able to reaffirm their commitment to the Swedish market in anticipation of the new rules. EveryMatrix, Relax Gaming and Yggdrasil, Stakelogic and Octoplay.</p>
<p>For its part, Blueprint Gaming has been actively looking to increase its European footprint over the past weeks, signing seminal partnerships with established brands such as BetFlag in Italy and DAZN Bet in Spain. Reregulation of the Swedish market has not proven particularly trying for established companies such as Blueprint Gaming.</p>
<p>The supplier has been present in the market and delivering an array of its titles already. Elsewhere, regulatory changes have been looming as well, and particularly in the United Kingdom which is due to introduce a White Paper which will review the existing gambling laws in the country. Blueprint Gaming is similarly ready to respond to any legal change in order to continue delivering its outstanding portfolio of player-favorite games.</p>
