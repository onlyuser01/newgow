<p>Cleveland Browns vs. Pittsburgh Steelers is an AFC North clash, which will take place on Monday, September 18, 2023, at Acrisure Stadium in Pittsburgh, PA</p>
<p>The Cleveland Browns started the 2023 NFL season in top gear, winning the Ohio derby in the opening game week. In Week 2, they’re taking on another AFC North team, the Pittsburgh Steelers who are 0-1 at the moment.</p>
<p>The Browns are favored to win, but what’s got to worry them is that they haven’t done it many times in Pittsburgh. In fact, most of their trips to Acrisure Stadium (formerly known as Heinz Field) resulted in a defeat.</p>

<p>Cleveland Browns Coming for Their Third Win in Pittsburgh in the 21st Century</p>
<p>The Cleveland Browns have a horrible record against the Pittsburgh Steelers, especially in the games played in Pennsylvania. In fact, they’ve won only twice there since the start of the 20th century. However, things have changed a lot lately. In 2023, the Browns definitely look like a team that can beat the Steelers on the road.</p>

<p>These guys started the season in the best way possible – by blowing out their Ohio rivals, the Cincinnati Bengals. It was the first game with Cincy’s Joe Burrow as the NFL’s highest-paid player ever, but Cleveland’s defense was able to stop him.</p>
<p>Their offense also did very well in that game, scoring two touchdowns, three field goals, one extra point, and even one two-point conversion.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh Steelers Need to Bounce Back After Embarrassing Week 1 Loss</p>
<p>The Steelers lost 30-7 at home to the San Francisco 49ers in the first game of the season. They scored a touchdown in the second quarter, but other than that, they were pretty disappointing offensively. Their QB went 31-for-46 for 231 yards, which sounds pretty decent. However, he also threw two interceptions.</p>
<p>Still, it was Pittsburgh’s offense that disappointed the fans the most. They conceded 30 points. Sure, the 49ers are an offensive powerhouse in 2023, but the defense was the Steelers’ strongest weapon in the past couple of seasons.</p>
<p>The good news is that they still do have some amazing players on their defensive team, including Minkah Fitzpatrick (safety) and Cameron Heyward (defensive tackle).</p>
<p>Cleveland Browns vs. Pittsburgh Steelers Prediction</p>
<p>The Steelers will probably perform much, much better than they did in Week 2, but we doubt that’s going to be enough to get to their first win of the 2023 season. Instead, we think the Browns are coming to Pittsburgh to win. They’ve got the confidence as well as the manpower to pull it off, although we can’t say with confidence that they’re going to cover the spread.</p>
<p>Pick: Cleveland Browns to win</p>
