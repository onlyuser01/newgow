<p>Hi Olle! Welcome to live chat!</p>
<p>I'm Kate, and I will be assisting you today.</p>
<p>(01:34:46)Olle A***</p>
<p>Yes I want my money and no more excuses it’s been 4 days and all you say is that you can’t contact your provider if payments</p>
<p>(01:35:23)Olle A***</p>
<p>Nothing takes 4 days to get in contact with anyone on this earth</p>
<p>(01:35:48)Kate</p>
<p>we are waiting to hear back from the payment provider Olle - this was emailed to you yesterday</p>
<p>(01:36:29)Olle A***</p>
<p>And I say it doesn’t take 4 days to get hold of anyone on this planet. How come it takes you 4 days and still no contact if a new payment provider ??</p>
<p>(01:36:45)Olle A***</p>
<p>One amil</p>
<p>(01:37:03)Kate</p>
<p>Yes it does Olle - because our payments department said yesterday it is being investigated and we have to wait to hear back</p>
<p>(01:37:13)Kate</p>
<p>so I don't have any more information to give you at the moment</p>
<p>(01:37:36)Olle A***</p>
<p>Why does it have to be investigated ? It was a new payment provider that handled my payment</p>
<p>(01:37:48)Olle A***</p>
<p>So what has to be investigated?</p>
<p>(01:37:57)Kate</p>
<p>because we sent the money and now we have to wait for a reply from the payment provider</p>
<p>(01:38:55)Olle A***</p>
<p>What ? You send my money to a new payment provider since the "old" one had technical issues , and the new provider is paying my money to me , WHAT has to be investigated????</p>
<p>(01:39:25)Kate</p>
<p>Sorry? No - it is being investigated with the payment provider so we must wait for news from them</p>
<p>(01:40:03)Olle A***</p>
<p>No, email conversation stated you used a new payment provider since old one had technical issues , so what is being investigated?</p>
<p>(01:40:31)Kate</p>
<p>Yes so we need to know why the withdrawal is taking a long time so this is what we are investigating with them</p>
<p>(01:41:59)Olle A***</p>
<p>So you investigate why my money hasn’t arrived instead of taking back the money and put them back on my balance so I can withdraw with e wallet instead?</p>
<p>And why do you investigate why it takes so long time instead of cancelling the transaction!!!????</p>
<p>(01:42:28)Kate</p>
<p>Olle - I have informed you that they are looking into it - when we have a reply we will inform yuo</p>
<p>(01:42:42)Kate</p>
<p>there is nothing more I can assist you with - we will be in touch as soon as possible</p>
<p>(01:42:57)Olle A***</p>
<p>And what’s the time limit for this investigation?? Before you decide to give me my money soon 10 days</p>
<p>(01:43:27)Olle A***</p>
<p>You do realize how this all sounds right ?</p>
<p>(01:43:33)Kate</p>
<p>I don't know Olle - If I did I would inform you - as soon as we hear back from them - I asked yesterday for an update and they said they were looking into it</p>
<p>(01:43:52)Olle A***</p>
<p>Haha sorry looking into it for 4 days</p>
<p>(01:44:36)Olle A***</p>
<p>but you do realize the absurdity of this whole situation? I’m as a player is getting shit cause you can’t get hold of your provider ???</p>
<p>(01:45:02)Kate</p>
<p>We have got hold of them and we are in touch with them - they are looking into it</p>
<p>(01:45:15)Kate</p>
<p>Olle there is nothing more I can assist you with here</p>
<p>(01:45:37)Olle A***</p>
<p>And the are looking into it for four days ? How hard is it ??? It’s not rocket science</p>
<p>(01:45:57)Kate</p>
<p>Yes they are Olle - so when we hear back we will inform you</p>
<p>(01:46:19)Olle A***</p>
<p>Ask them to resend the funds to my balance instead not hard , so I withdraw with e wallet , that’s not much to ask for</p>
<p>(01:46:49)Kate</p>
<p>Olle we will be in touch - there is no news for now</p>
<p>(01:46:51)Olle A***</p>
<p>Problem is you never seem to want to give me any money , it doesn’t take 4 days to send money</p>
<p>(01:47:14)Olle A***</p>
<p>You and me both know that</p>
<p>(01:47:22)Kate</p>
<p>We are going round in circles - there is no news at th moment - we will be in touch as soon as we have information for you</p>
<p>(01:47:36)Olle A***</p>
<p>The circle is not my fault is it ?</p>
<p>(01:47:53)Olle A***</p>
<p>I have deposited money to what I thought was a legit site of business , and still</p>
<p>(01:47:57)Olle A***</p>
<p>im getting the shit</p>
<p>(01:48:02)Kate</p>
<p>Nor mine Olle - The update is - we will get back to you as soon as we have information from thr provider</p>
<p>(01:48:13)Olle A***</p>

<p>(01:48:28)Olle A***</p>
<p>Whom should I turn to for complaints?</p>
<p>(01:48:46)Olle A***</p>
