<p>and it doesnt make sence tat i would abuse any bonus.....i have only made one dep with my bankaccount...and the accept the dep but than wont payout....</p>
<p>than they should say it in friont and so that i am not capable to make any dep ...thats also unfair and in my eyes not done when you know that?</p>
<p>all in allit doesnt make sence what they refer as reason not to pay me what i won.....i offered and sayd that i woukld take the half of the whole amount ....besides the 5000. euros i was playing with 400 or 500 euros ..it was 1200 at one time but in the end i still had about 400 or so and they are gone to....i find it funny when starded asking questions and felt trouble allready....and they even dfidnt want to tell me what was going onm= i dont know why but when i asked about the verification of my account than the word came out that it was to be payed but they never told on there behalve that there was a problem!!</p>
