<p>Numbers in New Jersey</p>
<p>Out of eleven active operators of the sports betting market in New Jersey, the total revenue generated in the state over the course of July saw a spike of 84.3% month-over-month. In comparison to 2018’s $3.8 million, when only five operators were actively in business, this year’s turn of events makes for a steady growth of the industry in the Garden State.</p>
<p>Foremost in the 11 pack stands the Meadowlands Racetrack, under whose license functions Flutter Entertainment’s FanDuel. Their $9.1 million revenue put them at the top of the competition for the past month and especially gaining grounds in their race with the partners Resorts Digital and DraftKings. The latter’s July revenue amounted to $3.7 million.</p>
<p>Third place goes to the Monmouth Park and William Hill alliance, which pulled in some $2 million, followed by the new entry – The Borgata – which opened their brand new $12 million sportsbook on the state’s territory in July, but still managed to pull in $859,478 in revenue.</p>
<p>The total of New Jersey’s sports betting market revenue is approximated at around $127.5 million. Placed bets for the year to date period amount to nearly $2.2 billion, $1.8m of which came in through online sources.</p>
<p>Overall, the state’s revenue for July saw a 10.7% spike in comparison to 2018 at $334.3 million. Overall, New Jersey is establishing itself as quite the sports betting paradise.</p>
<p>Delaware’s July in Numbers</p>
<p>Delaware’s sports betting market revenue pulled in approximately $40,000 more than last year’s July, reports showing a total of $288,675 generated.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, this year marks a drastic decrease of player spending at either sports betting venues or online of almost $10 million. In 2018’s July, online bets alone amounted to $17.92 million, while now they are showing $7.92 million. Player’s winnings have paralleled this notion, standing at $7.66m this July, as compared to $17.7 million last year.</p>
<p>Delaware Park’s report makes for a good example, generating about $114,000 during the month, which is about $5,000 less than last year’s results.</p>
<p>Second in the month’s reports goes to Dover Downs with revenue spiking some 62% in comparison to last year, amounting to $110,230, followed by the Harrington Raceway’s $63,738.</p>
