    <h1>7Bit Casino Login Casino Boston Hotel Monte Carlo Resort And Casino Washington Casino Hotels Poker P</h1>

<p>I have been trying for a week to withdraw my winnings from betsamigo, which is â‚¬250. But every time my withdrawal request is rejected and the casino in question receives an email asking for more personal information about me even though my account is confirmed on the site. I have sent the casino pictures of two of my bank statements, my driver's license, my Skrill wallet, my driver's license, a picture of my face, a picture of a piece of paper showing my face, full name, date of birth and the name of the casino. Now the casino in question asks for a picture of a different ID, even if you think that a picture of just a driver's license is enough, but nothing seems to be enough for this casino. The customer service is no help at all and e-mails are answered either once a day unclearly or not at all. The amount I'm trying to withdraw from the casino is not really big, but I'm starting to believe that you can't withdraw a single euro from this casino to your own account.</p>
