<p>CasinoBeats Summit 2023 is gearing up to come back in style, and one significant improvement of the latest edition is the arrival of the Leadership Conference track, which is hailed as one of the most successful and worthwhile parts of the entire event. The return of this seminal Conference has now been confirmed by SBC in a press release shared with Casino Guru News.</p>
<p>The Leadership Conference track will be available on the very first day of the summit, Wednesday, May 24, at the InterContinentalHotel in Malta. The Conference will touch on a number of important and exciting topics that will allow industry specialists to significantly increase their knowledge and understanding of the world today and how the industry fits in it.</p>
<p>Among the discussed topics will be matters of talent acquisition, the industry in the post-pandemic world, various discussions about investments and M&amp;As, dedicated panels on responsible gambling innovations hosted by Rootz, a leading operator, and more. There will also be a masterclass session which will focus on the rapidly-changing regulations around the world and how companies can respond to evolving advertising standards.</p>
<p>There are many highlights worth mentioning during the Leadership Conference track, one of which will be the "SBC Leaders panel - changing mindset and shifting the narrative," which will reunite an esteemed host of industry specialists, such as Andrew Rushgrove, Managing Director â€“ Gaming, Sky Betting &amp; Gaming, Colin Stewart, CEO of Palasino Malta Limited, Alexander Martin, CEO of SKS365, and Carlo Di Maio, CEO, FEG Romania.</p>
<p>The discussion will be moderated by Peter Wilson, Director of Peter Wilson Legal. Another prominent panel will include the "Marketing leaders - establishing an authentic voice," which will discuss the importance of this "authentic voice" that has to do with younger generations specifically and how firms can build greater authenticity around their businesses. This panel will include:</p>
<p>Sacha Kinser (Head of Content, Game Lounge)</p>
<p>(Head of Content, Game Lounge) Christine Debono (Marketing Director, Videoslots)</p>
<p>(Marketing Director, Videoslots) Silvia Hoppe (Group CMO/Founder &amp; Director Wunderino - Hyperino - Mybet / Globus Media Ltd)</p>
<p>(Group CMO/Founder &amp; Director Wunderino - Hyperino - Mybet / Globus Media Ltd) Aideen Shortt (CEO/Director, Lilywhite Limited/BetSwap Limited</p>
<p>Another interesting panel of interest to attendees would be "Protecting players during Inflation" which will discuss the responsibilities the industry has towards its consumers at a time of tightening economic prospects.</p>
<p>The panel will be attended by Ian Perrygrove, Chief Risk Officer of Kwiff, Matthew Curtis, Head of Responsible Gaming, L&amp;L Europe, Morten Ronde (Managing Partner/ CEO, Nordic Gambling/ Danish Online Gambling Association) and Dan Spencer, (Director of Safer Gambling, EPIC Risk Management).</p>
