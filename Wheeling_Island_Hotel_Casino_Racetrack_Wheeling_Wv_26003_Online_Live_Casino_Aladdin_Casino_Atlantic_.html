<p>The 2022 Valero Texas Open tees off Thursday, March 31, from TPC San Antonio-AT&amp;T Oaks Course. For four days, golf fans will have the luxury to watch some elite players competing for their share of the $8.6 million.</p>
<p>Apart from the money, golfers have another incentive to win the 100th edition of the Valero Texas Open. Being the world’s sixth-oldest golfing event, winning this tournament means engraving your name into golfing history books.</p>
<p>So, which golfer is most likely to win? According to odds, it’s Rory McIlroy. The Northern Irishman is seen as the #1 favorite, priced at +800 by the BetMGM oddsmakers. He’s the only player with a three-figure price; all the others have odds longer than +1000.</p>

<p>Will Rory McIlroy Win the 2022 Valero Texas Open?</p>
<p>Bookmakers sure think so. The legendary golfer has won 32 tournaments in his professional career, 20 of which were PGA Tour events. The most recent of those wins happened last October when we saw him grab the #1 prize at The CJ Cup @ Summit. Since then, we didn’t see him excel in the PGA Tour, finishing in the Top 10 only once.</p>
<p>The reason behind this is that the four PGA Tour events he’s played since October were all pretty tough. He was competing against elite golfers in each of those, which explains why he didn’t do much. This time, however, he has a seemingly easier job.</p>
<p>The thing is he’s the only player from the Top 10 of the 2022 Official World Golf Rankings who’s decided to take part in this tournament.</p>
<p>Other Contenders to Watch Out For</p>
<p>McIlroy is the highest-ranked player taking part in the 2022 Valero Texas Open. The next two in the rankings are Hideki Matsuyama (#12) and Bryson DeChambeau (#4), both of whom are seen as serious contenders for winning the event.</p>
<p>Then, there’s also Jordan Spieth, the golfer who’s sitting in the #17 place. The reason why bookmakers see him as a strong title candidate is that he’s the reigning champ. Corey Conners (#32) is also among the top candidates, which isn’t surprising knowing that he’s the man who won the 2019 event.</p>
<p>2022 Valero Texas Open Prediction</p>
<p>This seems like an ideal opportunity for McIlroy to get ahold of another big win. There’s no doubt he has the skills needed to win it and knowing that the competition isn’t as fierce as usual, winning the 2022 Valero Texas Open is a must for the 32-year-old.</p>
<p>Pick: Rory McIlroy</p>
