<p>Playtech and Paysafe have extended their partnership as both companies will collaborate in Europe and the UK. The existing deal includes the US, where Playtech offers Paysafe’s payment solutions to iGaming players and so far, the success has been praised by both sides.</p>
<p>Both Parties Enjoyed Their Relationship Since 2021</p>
<p>Paysafe has powered Playtech’s Play Gun Lake brand in Michigan since Q2 of 2021 and subsequently, it powered betParx’s app for New Jersey and Pennsylvania since the first quarter of 2021.</p>
<p>Thanks to the extension, UK and European operators will be able to take advantage of Playtech’s player account management (PAM) and information management solution (IMS) platform and integrate with Paysafe’s API to gain access to its payment solutions.</p>
<p>Card processing and payment acquisition will be the first solutions and e-wallets will follow suit later on. As for players, they will be able to enjoy massive flexibility in terms of the available ways through which they can pay to bet online.</p>
<p>The CEO of integrated and eCommerce solutions of Paysafe, Paulette Rowe, commented on the partnership extension by saying that Playtech is an “exciting global gaming brand” that is dedicated to providing operators with the best experience when it comes to payments.</p>
<p>Rowe added that both companies enjoyed a lot of success in the US and that is why they decided to extend and launch in both the UK and Europe with the same “single, integration technology.”</p>
<p>Market-Leading Technologies Are the Core of Playtech’s Strategy</p>
<p>Playtech was founded in 1999 and is one of the world’s most reputable game providers as it has upwards of 7,000 employees across 24 countries. It offers solutions across the most popular sectors of the iGaming industry. That includes sports betting, virtual sports, live casino, casino, bingo, and poker services.</p>
<p>Additionally, Playtech is an industry leader when it comes to omnichannel gambling via its platform Playtech ONE. Playtech ONE offers CRM, single wallet functionality, and data-driven marketing expertise, as well as responsible gambling solutions.</p>
<p>The success in the US market with the help of Paysafe was noted by Playtech and that is why the company is looking forward to expanding in both the UK and Europe. The COO of Playtech, Shimon Akad, shared a few words on the development by saying that offering market-leading technologies to the partners remains the core strategy of Playtech.</p>
<p>Akad added that payments “play an important role” in delivering the best possible experience for players and ensuring that, an expert team with a lot of industry knowledge is needed and that is exactly what Paysafe represents. As a concluding matter, Akad said that Playtech is extremely happy to extend the partnership in Europe and the UK and that he’s excited about what the two companies can achieve together.</p>
