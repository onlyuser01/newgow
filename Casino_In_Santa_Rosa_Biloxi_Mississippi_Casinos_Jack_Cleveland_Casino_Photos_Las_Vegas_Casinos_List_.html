    <h1>Casino In Santa Rosa Biloxi Mississippi Casinos Jack Cleveland Casino Photos Las Vegas Casinos List</h1>

<p>Dear Adam,</p>
<p>Below we present evidence of violation of our casino rules by player IWANNNAK.</p>
<p>Both players IWANNNAK and GAVALASZ from one country - Greece, from one city Athens, deposits were made from one number of bank card, it is confirmed by two reports - coincidence between numbers of cards - 100% coincidence.</p>
<p>This account of the player IWANNNAK considered as duplicate, according to the rules of our casino.</p>
<p>Also, as previously stated player IWANNNAK deposit was returned because the account is a duplicate.</p>
<p>Naturally, now the client will deny information that he knows the user DIMITRIOS GAVALAS, as wants to get his winnings, but the deposit of the bank card was on two accounts and it is an undeniable fact.</p>
<p>We advise the customer do not try to bypass the system of checking and play honestly, maybe the player IWANNNAK himself do not remember that he gave his card to make a deposit to anyone, but the fact of violation of the rules of the project was and it is confirmed.</p>
<p>The fact that the client IWANNNAK says that he did not make a deposit 2022-03-09 - money from a bank card can not be written off a day in a day and it is normal practice of different banks.</p>
<p>We would consider if the card would be reissued, received very recently, but it is not so. There was a successful deposit on another account (GAVALASZ) with this card on 2022-03-09.</p>
<p>Our decision remains unchanged, this account is a duplicate, and is blocked without the possibility of withdrawal.</p>
<p>Player IWANNNAK can contact the regulatory authority, but we have all the evidence that there was a fact of violation of our casino rules and there is a fact of deposit from one payment method (one bank card) on two accounts.</p>
<p>We are sorry if the representatives of Casino Guru do not see the facts that clearly show that the deposits were made with the same bank card on the first GAVALASZ account.</p>
<p>We ask the representatives of Casino Guru to mark the provided screenshots as private.</p>
<p>If you have any further questions, we will always be happy to help you.</p>
