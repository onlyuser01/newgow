<p>Bally’s Corporation has announced a new free-to-play game that offers sports fans and collegiate sports enthusiasts an opportunity to win $100 million outright. The only drawback is that they must get 63 games this March Madness season right. The chances of this happening are not very high as the NCAA estimates that there are 9.2 quintillion possible outcomes and possible groupings for the upcoming season.</p>
<p>Bally Offers Chance to Become Millionaire Off March Madness</p>
<p>Regardless, the Bally Bracket remains available to play for free and will offer anyone who has downloaded it to have a shot at winning the coveted reward. Bally’s is going to work with Sinclair Broadcast Group to promote the event. Sinclair and Bally’s go back to 2020 when the companies negotiated a partnership that allowed Bally’s to lend its names to 21 regional sports networks in what has since proved to be a massive boost for the brand.</p>
<p>Bally’s has also entered the sports betting game with a dedicated sportsbook product and has been actively growing its footprint. During several earnings calls in 2021, the company reaffirmed its ambitions to continue growing in the sports betting market in 2022 and beyond. Now, one way to do so is to use the popularity of March Madness to create awareness about its brand.</p>
<p>While predicting the outcome of 63 games is a fool’s errand, this will probably not stop people from trying. According to the American Gaming Association, 47 million people bet on March Madness in 2021. The expansion of sports betting across the United States this year should allow for this number to go one place – up. This comes in the context of people facing the consequences of COVID-19 shutdowns and inflation brought on by the geopolitical rupture caused by the Russian war in Ukraine.</p>
<p>Regardless, sports betting numbers are likely to continue going up with March Madness proving a strong magnet for gamblers and recreational fans. Bally’s will offer other bonuses as well. The company outlined that it intends to allocate an additional $100,000 based on nothing but chance.</p>
<p>Free Contest Awarding $100,000 in Additional Prizes</p>
<p>Anyone who participates in the Bally Bracket has an actual chance of winning a chunk of the prize pool. One player will get $50,000 while three others will get $25,000, $10,000, and $5,000 respectively. It seems that the odds of winning a random prize from the $100,000 draw are much better than actually winning by guessing the 63 games on the bracket. The odds for guessing the games are estimated at 1 in 120.2 billion.</p>
<p>Bally’s will be using the SportCaller infrastructure that it acquired in 2021 to manage the free-to-play game. Free-to-play games have been particularly popular in the United States and served as the basis of onboarding sports fans on betting platforms.</p>
