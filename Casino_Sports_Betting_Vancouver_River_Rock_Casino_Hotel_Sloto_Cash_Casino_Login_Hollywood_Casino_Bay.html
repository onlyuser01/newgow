<p>Continent 8 Technologies has been given green light by the Michigan Gaming Control Board (MGCB) to launch its proprietary Gaming Cloud and provide the solution to suppliers and operators in the Great Lakes state.</p>
<p>Continent 8 Continues to Add More Gaming Cloud</p>
<p>Continent8’s Gaming Cloud has already been launched successfully elsewhere in the North American market and in some of the biggest iGaming markets in the United States, to wit New Jersey and Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>The solution comes with a multi-tenanted, scalable, and resilient IaaS platform that covers businesses’ needs and helps create dependable and powerful infrastructure, data, network edge services, and others.</p>
<p>Continent 8 has been working with regulators in the North American market to offer its full suite of solutions and ensure that the products that offer are in fact compliant. This has empowered the company’s businesses to opt for a dependable and fully vetted product that is ready to be deployed, giving them a significant advantage when they launch new regulations.</p>
<p>Continent 8’s license by the MGCB is the latest evidence of the company’s well-developed software infrastructure and advanced solutions that it is able to offer to the dynamic and fast-expanding gambling sector in the country. Continent 8’s Public Cloud, though is only part of the existing network that the company maintains in the Great Lakes States.</p>
<p>Continent 8 already has network connectivity, data center, and cyber security services in the state. The company sought to expand rapidly in the state following January 2021 when MGCB gave the green light to sports betting and online casino services in the state. Commenting on this achievement, company CPO Justin Cosnett said:</p>
<p>Achieving approval from the Michigan Gaming Control Board for our Gaming Community Cloud is an important strategic development for Continent 8, as demand for secure and compliant cloud solutions continues to rise. Continent 8 CPO Justin Cosnett</p>
<p>He added that the company understood the importance of the first mover, a pay-as-you-grow advantage that businesses expect to find through Continent 8 in some of the United States’ most competitive iGaming and betting markets.</p>
<p>Continent 8 Continues to Grow in the United States</p>
<p>Continent 8 Technologies innovation director David Brace added that the company is determined to be the best and first service provider of Community Cloud solutions in Michigan. He continued:</p>
<p>In terms of infrastructure, the cloud offers fast market entry, especially for new licensees, as well as backup or migration capability for those already invested in the state and looking to move away from costly hardware investment in a time of supply chain challenges. Continent 8 Technologies innovation director David Brace</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Continent 8 already operates in 24 US states and offers a number of services that it is authorized to carry out by local regulators.</p>
