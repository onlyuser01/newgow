    <h1>Casino Charlotte Nc Casino Near Me Open Now Butte Casino Az Ip Hotel And Casino In Biloxi Harrahs Ho</h1>

<p>Hello dear Radka 🙂</p>
<p>Yes, incredible 14 documents... 👎🏼😑</p>
<p>Jackpot would be nice hehe 😛 it's only €500!!!!</p>
<p>I think for such a sum you don't have to torment the player.</p>
<p>Especially if you have been registered there for ages and also had some payments.</p>
<p>I was also verified, but they wanted all these documents again.</p>
<p>I made the first payout on October 31st (for my birthday😛) and it kept getting canceled due to documents being requested.</p>
<p>On November 2nd, I initiated another payout after all the submitted documents and this has been in process for 2 days.</p>
<p>I don't want to file a complaint and I don't want to mention the name here because I don't want to offend anyone.</p>
<p>However, if there is still nothing new in 2 weeks and you have not processed and paid it out, I think I will file a complaint. 🙂</p>
<p>I'm someone who plays in many different casinos and often has several payouts pending, so I don't really have a problem with waiting a month.</p>
<p>Personally, I have found that some casinos take a really long time to pay out, but if you refrain from gambling long enough, the casino pays out in most cases 🙂</p>
<p>The worst casino that I personally came across was Casinoplanet.com, I also like to mention the name because I know for myself that they are really nasty scammers who do not even shy away from forging PDF files and inserting bet amounts that are not correct they can confiscate a player's winnings.</p>
<p>I've been playing in casinos for easily 20 years now and I've also seen one or the other ugly behavior but Casinoplanet is really one of them that I would eradicate if I could.</p>
<p>I always say honestly what is going on and always try to be polite and not badmouth anyone because I don't want to play with other people's bread! But some casinos make you so sad with their corrupt ways that you lose all fun. 🙂</p>
<p>That's why I'm really happy that you exist 🙂</p>
<p>I will no longer play in any casino that is not on your list!</p>
<p>I always look at which casinos have the fewest complaints and good ratings and then I play there🙂 and so far always without problems except that you sometimes have to wait longer for your money, but that's not so bad if you show a little patience . 🙂</p>
<p>Nice that you exist ✌🏽❤️✌🏼</p>
