<p>The 2023 ICE London event will have a GBG High Street Hub, a special floor that will focus on operators and suppliers from the regulated street gaming sector</p>
<p>SBC News reported that ICE London organizer Clarion Gaming has announced that the new dynamic show floor dedicated to street gaming has been developed in collaboration with Gambling Business Group.</p>
<p>GBG High Street Hub Becomes ICE London Street Gaming Space</p>
<p>ICE London is organized by gambling event company Clarion Gaming and this year will take place from February 7 to February 9 at the conference center ExCeL London.</p>
<p>Clarion Gaming announced that together with Gambling Business Group it has developed and designed GBG High Street Hub, which will be situated right next door to the Pillar Hall Casino, the meeting space and bar that are allocated to the brick-and-mortar gambling industry.</p>
<p>The new dedicated space will allow operators and suppliers within the street gaming sector to showcase their products and will feature companies such as Novomatic UK, Entain, Buzz Bingo, Merkur UK, and GameNation.</p>
<p>The new floor zone is only one of many dedicated spaces created by ICE London organizers in collaboration with gambling industry stakeholders, including iGB Affiliate, ICE VOX, Pitch ICE, and many others.</p>
<p>In December, Ewa Bakun, Clarion Gaming’s director of industry, announced that this year’s convention will have the largest-ever Customer Protection Zone. The space already won an award at the Global Regulatory Awards. As a result, Clarion Gaming has decided to expand it even further this year.</p>
<p>The zone will host 20 stands, including the UK Gambling Commission and many charities working within safer and responsible gaming. This will mark a 50% boost in comparison to the number of stands in 2022 and the space will be 100% larger than it was in its debut year 2018.</p>
<p>Organizers Hope the New Street Gaming Floor Will Stimulate Valuable Debates</p>
<p>Executives both from organizer Clarion Gaming and Gambling Business Group embraced the new GBG High Street Hub.</p>
<p>Managing Director of Clarion Gaming Stuart Hunter said: “ICE London 2023 will be the biggest edition on record and I am delighted that this will include a section of the show floor dedicated to the street gaming sector of the business.”</p>
<p>Hunter further added that Clarion Gaming’s job is to collaborate with gambling industry stakeholders to deliver an exceptional and valuable event that they would like to attend and the partnership with Gambling Business Group serves as a great example of this.</p>
<p>Peter Hannibal, Gambling Business Group CEO and Co-Founder, also praised the collaboration: “Our aim is to reflect these important credentials and stimulate lively, topical and informed debate surrounding a sector which contributes so much to the economic and social vitality of towns and cities where street-based gambling entertainment is regulated.”</p>
<p>Hannibal also noted that the main topics for discussion will be the use of new technologies such as facial recognition, licensing regulations, and responsible gaming within the sector, among others.</p>
