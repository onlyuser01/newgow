    <h1>Rivers Casino Schenectady New York Mgm Vegas Casino Ip Hotel And Casino In Biloxi Draftkings At Casi</h1>

<p>Lightning Box has launched Stellar Cash Dragon Palace, the sequel to the popular 5x3 Dragon Palace slot with the added Stellar Cash jackpot feature</p>
<p>The expert slot studio that belongs to Light &amp; Wonder has mixed together their already popular Dragon Palace game with their iconic Stellar Cash feature for jackpot wins to create a new slot that will enjoy its exclusive launch with BetMGM in New Jersey in mid-July.</p>
<p>The new slot with an Asian theme will become available to players at Light &amp; Wonder’s top-tier OpenGaming platform together with other equally exciting releases including Money Link Great Immortals and Lightning Eclipse.</p>
<p>Dragon Palace Metrics Overview</p>
<p>Reels: 5</p>
<p>Rows: 3</p>
<p>Paylines: 243 Ways to Win</p>
<p>RTP: 96.24%</p>
<p>Hit Freq: –</p>
<p>Max Win: x500</p>
<p>Volatility: High</p>
<p>Min/Max Bet: 0.3/60</p>
<p>Release date: July 13, 2023</p>
<p>Up to 20 Free Games and a 15x Dragon Multiplier</p>
<p>The beautifully designed grid is packed with symbols that depict lotus flowers, turtles, and koi fish which must be matched in winning combinations across 25 available pay lines in order to grant a win.</p>
<p>The dragon is the wild symbol in the game and it replaces the rest of the symbols with the exception of the scatter symbols. Players who manage to land a minimum of three scatter symbols during the base game are rewarded with up to 20 free spins.</p>
<p>While the free spins bonus round is engaged, the Master Dragon symbol can be seen breathing fire across the grid reels while revealing the dragon multiplier. The latter is able to reach up to 15x in value, thus significantly increasing the game’s overall winning potential.</p>
<p>According to Light &amp; Wonder’s vice president of game development, Rob Procter, the opportunity to land multipliers that can go as high as 15x during the bonus round “compliments the big win potential” of the slot while also boosting the excitement that the slot has already triggered among players so far.</p>
<p>Stellar Cash Bonus Feature</p>
<p>For more spectacular winning opportunities, players can trigger the Stellar Cash bonus feature when landing at least three spaceship symbols attached to any regular symbol within the game.</p>
<p>This will automatically carry them to space in an epic battle against their enemies, where they will be asked to select a target and find out what instant cash prizes they have won provided they had made the right choice.</p>
<p>Players who reach the final level will be revealed a Mini, a Minor, a Major, or a Grand Jackpot as a prize. The studio’s operations manager, Michael Maokhamphiou, expressed their belief that the addition of the Stellar Cash bonus to the high-performing title in their library should rapidly turn the new release into a “fan favorite.”</p>
<p>At the end of January, Lightning Box announced the release of Chicken Fox 5x Skillstar, an arcade-style game based on the same Stellar Cash feature.</p>
<p>Ever since Lightning Box was acquired by Light &amp; Wonder in August 2021, the slot provider has recorded a 57% growth while keeping the same high commitment to offering top-quality slots.</p>
