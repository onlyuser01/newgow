<p>Hi,</p>
<p>First of all thank you for the support, now I'd like to share you the answer the casino sent me. (I'll paste it here)</p>
<p>---------‚Äê------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Greetings,</p>
<p>Thank you for contacting us.</p>
<p>Please note that the only way to verify your document is via the website.</p>
<p>Please provide a valid proof of address. It should meet the following requirements:</p>
<p>it could be either a utility bill, bank/credit card statement, tax invoice, or another government-issued residential statement/certificate which is no more than 3 months old.</p>
<p>Please note that we don't accept screenshots, mobile phone bills, medical bills, purchase receipts, or insurance statements.</p>
<p>You can use your ID document as proof of address if it contains your home address information. But in this case, you will need to provide another ID document as your proof of identity. You can't use the same document to prove both your address and your identity.</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>

<p>So, I've got a few questions, I have only one ID document and it shows the residence address but at the same time it is my only ID document how can I verify my residence if every government-issued residential statement I have are not in my name (I live with my parents) and also how could I l send them the documentation without taking photos? should I scan the documents? Maybe I can use the bank/credit card statement for the residence address verification? but I don't really know what it means for it.</p>
<p>Sorry for the messy text but I really don't want to get it wrong this time.</p>
<p>I look forward for your response and thank you so much for your time.</p>
