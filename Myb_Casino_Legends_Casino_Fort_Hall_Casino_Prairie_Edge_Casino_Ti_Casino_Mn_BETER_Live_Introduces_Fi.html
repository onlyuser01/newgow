    <h1>Myb Casino Legends Casino Fort Hall Casino Prairie Edge Casino Ti Casino Mn BETER Live Introduces Fi</h1>

<p>The popular gambling company and supplier of content for the online casino sector has introduced its first game show, Gravity Roulette</p>
<p>Gravity Roulette is BETER Live’s entry into the world of game show products that have been popular with leading developers. This announcement is aligned with a previous statement by BETER Live that the company will seek to challenge the vertical and disrupt it, going head-to-head with established companies such as Stakelogic, Pragmatic, and not least, Evolution.</p>
<p>Bringing New Experiences to the Live Casino Vertical</p>
<p>Gravity Roulette is based on roulette games that are already part of the company’s portfolio, and the game comes with what is described as “sky-high multipliers.” BETER Live’s first game show will also launch on March 8 and be distributed across a curated and hand-pick list of interested operators.</p>
<p>The company has big hopes for its products, leaning in heavily on the execution of a show that is elegant, captivating, and appeals to a wide audience. There is an up to 1,000x multiplier that will be available each round, which the company estimates would lead to stronger engagement and sustained interest by players.</p>
<p>Gravity Roulette also comes with a range of inside bets to further add to its gameplay and opportunity. The name was picked to reflect BETER Live’s commitment to building original and prominent franchises in the industry, with the Gravity Blackjack already proving a success and the company committed to expanding the line of Gravity-branded games as well.</p>
<p>BETER Live director Anna Vikmane was pleased with this new development, and she hailed the arrival of the company’s first game show. A lot of effort has gone into making sure that the resulting product will be precisely what the company’s partners expect:</p>
<p>We wanted to create a product that would look good and keep players engaged with its jaw-dropping multipliers on all inside bets.</p>
<p>BETER CEO Gal Ehrlich was similarly pleased to see the company’s first game show enrich BETER Live’s portfolio, and said that he was confident in the arrival of the Gravity series. “There are still several games to come in the Gravity series and we can’t wait to show them all off to players around the world,” Ehrlich concluded.</p>
