<p>Global gaming technology company Elys Game Technology announced that land-based sportsbook services it provides in partnership with Wright Bet have so far added over 100 host locations in Ohio.</p>
<p>Venues Eager to Launch Own Sportsbooks</p>
<p>The news that Elys Game Technology and Wright Bet doubled the number of host locations for their land-based sportsbook offering in just over a month is proof of how attractive Elys’ sports betting service is to restaurants, bars and other small businesses in the state ahead of Ohio’s official launch of sports wagering on January 1, 2023.</p>
<p>“We are extremely pleased with the momentum that we are experiencing among retail establishments looking to provide their customers with our proven, best-in-class, end-to-end sportsbook solution,” said Michele Ciavarella, executive chairman of Elys Game Technology, before going into detail about how the company presented and demonstrated its “cutting-edge ‘Build-your-bet’ technology” at the Ohio Bar Owners Association trade show.</p>
<p>Subject to regulatory approval and all required licenses approved by the Ohio Casino Control Commission, Elys expects to be able to launch its land-based sportsbook service across all its host locations alongside the official launch of sports betting in the state.</p>
<p>“Our solution offers hosts the added edge of providing mobile access for players to compare markets and prepare their wagers off-site before coming into the host location to place their bet,” Ciavarella continued, outlining the company’s belief that “the bet velocity advantage of this feature could be a win-win for the hosts and players.”</p>
<p>Elys is relying on the new feature to generate a new stream of revenue while bringing an engaging and exciting product and service to their business customers to help them strengthen their businesses by drawing sports bettors to their venues.</p>
<p>“Bars and restaurants are ideal locations for our sportsbook solution,” Ciavarella added, pointing to the exciting new way the sportsbook will offer fans of sports to enjoy their favorite teams alongside their food and beverages, stressing the company’s plans to “continue to aggressively develop” sales across additional venues around the country.</p>
<p>Host Locations Expand Nationwide</p>
<p>Acting on its vision to become a global leader in the gaming industry by pioneering and leveraging technology, Elys Game Technology is already present across five US states and the District of Columbia, offering its retail sportsbook solution to small businesses.</p>
<p>Among Elys’ latest partners was Maryland’s pool bar Top Hat Sports Bar &amp; Grill which gladly introduced its sportsbook powered by the sportsbook solution provided by the Canadian-based tech firm.</p>
<p>Also in October, Elys announced plans with Grand Central Restaurant and Sportsbook in Washington DC to launch a second sportsbook location in the area, subject to approval by the DC Department of Small &amp; Local Business Developments, and the DC Office of Lottery and Gaming.</p>
