    <h1>Leelanau Sands Casino Casino Pier Photos Where Was Casino Royale Filmed Pulsz Online Casino Hankinso</h1>

<p>The collaboration between the two companies resulted in the launch of a new NHL-themed game exclusively for PokerStars customers in Michigan</p>
<p>The provider of engaging online casino games, Play’n GO, announced the launch of a new NHL-themed game. On Friday, the company confirmed that through an agreement with PokerStars, it launched an exclusive Detroit Red Wings game. The new game, which is available for PokerStars customers in Michigan, recognizes the Detroit Red Wings, the famous NHL team and promises to deliver its fans unrivaled experiences.</p>
<p>The recently launched game comes after the two companies have successfully collaborated for several markets in Europe, as well as across the US. Building on this mutual success, the duo decided to join forces once again and deliver a new game for fans of the popular NHL team across Michigan.</p>
<p>The idea about the Detroit Red Wings game was conceived earlier this year. Ever since the initial idea, Play’n GO’s dedicated team of designers has been working tirelessly to release the exclusive new game for PokerStars’ customers in the Wolverine State.</p>
<p>The launch of the exclusive NHL-themed game comes on the heels of an important partnership announced by Play’n GO overseas. Earlier this week, the company grew its footprint in Europe by agreeing to deliver games for William Hill in Italy. As a result, players of the operator in the country will now be able to experience Play’n GO’s full range of quality games, including recent releases and proven hits.</p>
<p>Play’n GO and PokerStars, Excited to Join Forces</p>
<p>Brent Rovner, PokerStars’ casino director of North America, explained that the latest collaboration with Play’n GO for the delivery of the exclusive Detroit Red Wings game reaffirms PokerStars’ dedication to delivering exceptional experiences for its growing customer base. “We’re confident that this game will be a hit with our Michigan players, and we’re excited to see them cheer on their favorite team while enjoying this exciting new game,” explained the casino director in conclusion.</p>
<p>“The opportunity to team up with PokerStars to design a game for the Detroit Red Wings was very appealing to us from day one, and we’re very pleased with the final product.“ Magnus Olsson, chief commercial officer, Play’n GO</p>
<p>Magnus Olsson, Play’n GO’s chief commercial officer, was similarly delighted, highlighting the unique opportunity for the company to join forces with PokerStars for the new NHL game. He explained that the company is excited about the final product and is also proud to deliver this game for hockey fans in Michigan. Finally, Olsson predicted great success for the new game.</p>
