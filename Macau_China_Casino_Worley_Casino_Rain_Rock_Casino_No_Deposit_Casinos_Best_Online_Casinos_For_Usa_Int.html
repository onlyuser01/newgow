<p>Intelitics, a provider of scalable customer acquisition solutions for iGaming brands will expand its reach through a deal with the leading African sports and digital entertainment platform KingMakers.</p>
<p>Intelitics Will Boost BetKing’s Customer Acquisition</p>
<p>The agreement will see Intelitics use its critically-acclaimed customer acquisition program to support KingMakers’ wagering brand BetKing. The solutions provider will use its data-driven products and platform to help BetKing manage its affiliates and paid media activity. Furthermore, the latter will be able to closely track its players and follow its media campaigns in real-time.</p>
<p>BetKing’s affiliates will also benefit from the deal as they will receive access to real-time data and analytics which will help them to self-regulate their marketing campaigns.</p>
<p>This deal is crucial to Intelitics as it marks its foray into the African market. Previously, the solutions provider has mostly stuck to Europe and North America but is now eyeing the growth opportunities that await in the budding betting markets outside of the Western world. Intelitics has reliable partners and a strong foundation in its native markets, thanks to which it is well-poised for exploring new regions.</p>
<p>The Provider Is Excited by What Awaits in Africa</p>
<p>Allan Petrilli, Intelitics’ vice president of sales, spoke on the deal. He couldn’t hide his excitement by having Intelitics selected as KingMakers’ new partner and said that he is happy to see his company power BetKing with customer acquisition solutions.</p>
<p>“Our platform has been designed so that it is easy to manage and use for both operators and affiliates, with unrivaled access to real-time data at its heart. This gives operators and affiliates the power to see how their campaigns are performing and adjust course if need be.” Intellitics VP of sales Allan Petrilli</p>
<p>Petrilli noted that BetKing is one of the powerhouses on the African betting market and is pleased to have the brand as Intelitics’ first African partner. He added that Intelitics will use this as leverage to strengthen its positions in Africa and expand in the region over the next few months.</p>
<p>Neil Bothma, the chief executive officer of BetKing Nigeria, welcomed Intelitics, saying that as a platform provider capable of delivering insights in real-time, it will be an invaluable asset to the operator’s goals of maximizing customer acquisition. “This is a major deal for us, and we look forward to working closely with the Intelitics team,” Bothma explained</p>
<p>BetKing has quickly cemented itself as one of the leading gambling operators in Africa. Its offerings are currently available in several African countries, including Ethiopia, Nigeria, Kenya and have just launched in Ghana. BetKing has 20,000 betting shops in Nigeria alone and is slowly expanding across the continent. Thanks to its new partnership with Intelitics, BetKing will likely quickly expand its audience even more.</p>
