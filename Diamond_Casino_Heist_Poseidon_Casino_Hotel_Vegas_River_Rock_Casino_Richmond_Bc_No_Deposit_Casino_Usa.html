    <h1>Diamond Casino Heist Poseidon Casino Hotel Vegas River Rock Casino Richmond Bc No Deposit Casino Usa</h1>

<p>I been trying to get a hold of anyone from the team to let me know at least why has my account been locked and nobody's responding me support keeps telling me it takes weeks to get a response from email team I don't get no reply on their Twitter nor on Instagram. What's even going on. They closed on 25th December 2021, since then I was told to provide last transactions ip addresses and everything and what not which I did. They kept telling me I have breached their terms by using the BCL gift links to my advantage, It was a bug on their end and many users including me got those links which we clicked on and that gave some BCL which I really have no idea of that what it is. I provided them all the screenshots with that user even all those screenshots that I had. I literally deposited $250 and lost that and was just trying to claim my rakeback and turned out I'm banned. I didn't even use that BCL or whatever it was since I had no clue of where it is or what it is. They are saying I used it to my advantage. Well If I did that They should also be able to prove this to me since it was my account and I have all the rights to ask any information related to it I had 2fa enabled and I had also done their kyc voluntarily. They don't respond to my emails they don't tell me what exactly was my fault I have been on the site for literally since they launched I have referred a good few people. One of which is working as a vip host on that site. Plus every other person who was affected by that error and clicked that link got their accounts back literally after a week of this happening except me. Maybe because I'm not that active in their chat or maybe because I don't have contact with their support and mods and whatsoever links to be counted as priority user.</p>
