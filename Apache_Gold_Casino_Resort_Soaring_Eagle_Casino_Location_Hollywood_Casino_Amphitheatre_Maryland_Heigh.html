<p>VegasAces Casino is one of the newer casino websites out there that provides you with a range of experiences and tons of excellent games. Today, I take a look at VegasAces Casino in its entirety, covering everything they do – from the available games to bonuses, to the banking and website functionality.</p>
<p>All in all, VegasAces Casino is a good place to try games by some of the industry’s biggest suppliers, enjoy fast and reliable banking, and explore some tempting promotions. I will go ahead and jump right into it to help you figure out what this casino has to offer and why it may appeal to you.</p>
<p>Promotions at VegasAces Casino</p>
<p>Let’s start with the VegasAces Casino welcome bonus, a $5,000 package that is matched at 250% up to $1,000 on your first deposit, and then matched by 100% on your four following deposits. In terms of match rate, I can say that VegasAces Casino provides decent entry and accessibility.</p>
<p>You get more than you paid for right from the start which is always encouraging. The bonus terms and conditions are also clear and easy to follow, which I always consider a point in a casino’s favor. To activate the bonus what you need to do is deposit a minimum amount of $50 for each of the five deposits.</p>
<p>You also need to use a bonus code – ACES250 for the first deposit and ACES100 for each of the four subsequent deposits. The wagering requirements for the bonus are pretty standard for this type of casino, asking you to run the deposit and bonus amounts 35x times each.</p>
<p>There is also quite a lengthy list when it comes to individual games where you can use the bonus, including slots, keno, lottery, scratch cards, bingo, table games, and even video poker. One thing I didn’t like about the terms, though, was that it was hard to find what the exact wagering contributions were.</p>
<p>This is not because the percentage was missing, but rather because of how VegasAces presented the information. A simple table would have been best, but the casino has chosen to explain in detail why it has assigned each of the wagering contributions the way it did. This aside, I found the welcome bonus at VegasAces Casino to be a solid affair.</p>
<p>Reloads, Weeklies, and Other Promotions</p>
<p>When it comes to bonuses and promotions, VegasAces Casino has clearly worked hard and long to ensure that you get the best possible treatment. The website has plenty to offer as is right now and you will have the opportunity to enjoy a re-up bonus that will have you top up your bankroll up to $1,000 along with a crypto bonus that will have a 20% match up to $500.</p>
<p>The casino habitually runs Game of the Week and Weekly Bonus Accumulator initiatives to help you get even more value from the time you spend with VegasAces. First-time crypto depositors may also find an interesting bonus that is worth their while and time and get up to 300% match.</p>
<p>Overall, VegasAces Casino’s bonus games are definitely on point and you will have no issues with it whatsoever. Players who are new can definitely find great value, but even if you skip claiming the welcome bonus, you can still benefit from the many promos for established customers.</p>
<p>As is my habit to find faults with the casinos I review, I would have appreciated seeing a little more done in the way of free spins. Nevertheless, VegasAces Casino still offers a great opportunity for players.</p>
<p>VegasAces Casino Payment Methods</p>
<p>I do appreciate when casinos make the banking process as simple and straightforward as possible. VegasAces Casino has definitely put a big emphasis on transparency as shown in the terms of the bonuses, and now in its banking conditions. There are a few caveats that you ought to be aware of before we move forward.</p>
<p>Deposits</p>
<p>You can pick from a good range of depositing methods that are actually quite flexible. For example, you could easily top up your bankroll and account if you are a high roller, which is always nice. Essentially, you may bank using any of the following payment methods and with the following betting limits:</p>
<p>MasterCard – $50 – $2,499</p>
<p>Visa – $50 – $2,499</p>
<p>American Express – $50 – $999</p>
<p>Bitcoin – $10 – $50,000</p>
<p>Ethereum – $10 – $50,000</p>
<p>Litecoin – $10 – $50,000</p>
<p>BitcoinCash – $10 – $50,000</p>
<p>Withdrawals</p>
<p>Withdrawals at VegasAces Casino are fast, quick, and reliable. The only drawback is that they are limited to Bitcoin which may be a little restrictive to players who want to cash out in other currencies or by using other methods. The payout limit is set at $50,000, which is really good.</p>
<p>This will give you quite a bit of flexibility. Withdrawals take up to 48 hours with Bitcoin, although you may need to provide KYC and AML information before a large sum is approved. You may need to present ID documents, proof of address, or proof of card ownership.</p>
<p>VegasAces Casino may request additional documents to confirm your identity before letting you withdraw. I am only mentioning this so that you know, although the casino has a really solid track record when it comes to cash outs and I have not run into any issues with them even when I had to verify my identity.</p>
<p>All in all, I am not overly excited that I can only cash out in Bitcoin, but truth be told – it’s a quick and efficient way.</p>
<p>VegasAces Casino Games</p>
<p>VegasAces Casino features an excellent selection of games, and I cannot stress this enough. The website is a fairly new entry into the gambling market. The website actually hosts games by no fewer than 45 studios, which makes it quite a busy place to be.</p>
<p>Speaking of individual brands that have their games featured here, you will discover the likes of Turbo Games, TVBet, Rival, Funky Games, Dragon Gaming, Betsoft, Apollo Games, Felix Gaming, and many others. There is no shortage of casino games with more than 500 titles awaiting.</p>
<p>One thing I want to point out before I dive into the individual types of games available is how well-organized the lobby is. You will have different category filters to sort through, including Blackjack, Roulette, Video Poker, Table Games, Slots, Live Dealer, Jackpot Games, and others. Let’s get started. To access Favorite Games, though, you would need to first be a registered VegasAces Casino member.</p>
<p>Slots &amp; Jackpot Games</p>
<p>I have summed up these two categories under the same roof because they largely overlap. Slots are the most numerous genre of games that you can access at VegasAces Casino and this is no bad thing.</p>
<p>In fact, I am a huge fan of the slots and the casino brings so many different, varied, and worthwhile options to explore. Among the brilliant slots to try here are titles that I strongly recommend, including:</p>
<p>Take the Sword</p>
<p>Buffalo Bounty</p>
<p>Play with Cleo</p>
<p>Triple Juicy</p>
<p>Cleopatra’s Fortune</p>
<p>Gold Heist</p>
<p>Other spot-on options include Treasures of the Gods, Hammer of Thunder, and Genie’s Riches, all of which are excellent opportunities for you to enjoy yourself. As to the jackpot games available, they are actually split into two categories, which I really appreciate.</p>
<p>On the one hand, you have the progressive jackpots, and on the other – jackpots. This is a small distinction but an important one. Progressive jackpots are just what the name suggests – games that have a continually increasing prize pool until someone wins and the whole thing is reset.</p>
<p>Popular choices here include the Copa, Greedy Goblins, Dragon Kings, Faerie Spells, Gold of Egypt, and Maya’s Miracle. Regular jackpot games include Book of Symbols, Hotlife, Dragon’s Secret, and more.</p>
<p>Table Games, Blackjack &amp; Roulette</p>
<p>There are quite a few table and card games to try at VegasAces Casino which I can definitely get behind. The selection is not just decent – it’s replete. You will get to play some of the best titles there are across each of these categories.</p>
<p>There are more than 25 different blackjack options to try, including American and European Blackjack, 21 Burn Blackjack, and Double Exposure, along with Side Bets Blackjack, and more. Roulette is equally well represented on the website.</p>
<p>If you love this game more than you do counting cards, then you will have a similar number of games to choose from. The roulette library is stacked with European Roulette, French Roulette, and American Roulette.</p>
<p>These are virtually the three main types of games to try out, albeit there are others – such as Personal Roulette and Mini Roulette.</p>
<p>Video Poker</p>
<p>Video poker is a fantastic opportunity for you to play a game that combines skill and luck and brings you some of the best return rates. Video poker consistently provides players with high RTP and a game that is based on a deeper understanding.</p>
<p>I must admit that while slots are much easier to play in a sense, video poker gives you that strategic depth that will make your session more satisfying. Of course, video poker is a game of chance and the versions featured at VegasAces Casino are really no different.</p>
<p>There are some 32 games to try here, and they are all very much worth it. Among the games you can try is Casino Hold’em, Texas Hold’em, Caribbean Poker, Teen Patti, Trey Poker, Rolling Stack Blackjack, Jacks or Better, Oasis Poker and so many more.</p>
<p>The paytable for each of these games brings you some pretty decent payout rates and you will definitely have a good time settling in if you are a video poker fan.</p>
<p>Live Dealer Games</p>
<p>I always say that a casino that is willing to go the extra mile and provide you with live dealer games is worth playing at. VegasAces is no exception with 86 outstanding live dealer games -more than many of its table title selections!</p>
<p>You have a number of live dealer suppliers in this category and you can easily navigate through the lobby by picking games from FreshDeck, Lotto Instant Win, SaGaming, Superlotto, SuperSpade Games, TVBet, among others.</p>
<p>In terms of actual games to try, there is a ton of options I would wholeheartedly recommend. The blackjack and roulette tables are solid. You get European and VIP Blackjack, European Roulette and Auto Roulette, Baccarat and Speed Baccarat, SicBo, Fan Tan, Dragon Tiger, Anda Bahar, and others.</p>
<p>All of these games have been designed to provide players with an outstanding experience that feels satisfying across the board and is tons of fun to try and enjoy.</p>
<p>Mobile Compatibility</p>
<p>Mobile compatibility is often one of the key features I expect from a casino. VegasAces does not disappoint, as it plays well on Android and iOS, and it’s generally a fantastic casino to try and enjoy on your handheld devices. Essentially, VegasAces Casino does everything well on mobile.</p>
<p>You can contact customer support, for example, withdraw your money, play any game you wish, and generally have a lot of fun with the casino. I have found no fault with the mobile performance and believe me, I did try. All in all, this is a great casino on mobile.</p>
<p>VegasAces Casino Reputation and Licensees</p>
<p>Now for the tricky part. I have not been able to confirm any licensure on VegasAces Casino. Is this a bad thing? Well, this depends. Licenses are generally a decent indicator of a casino, although they are definitely not that much of an assurance unless the casino has a good reputation. I still hold this a shortcoming though. VegasAces Casino seems to be doing right by its customers and has a good track record, but a license can go a long way in ensuring that people can trust the casino, even if it will undoubtedly add to the bureaucratic nonsense that the operator has to sort. Either way, I think VegasAces is trustworthy but they do need to get that license underway.</p>
