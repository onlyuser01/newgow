<p>Playtech is clearly determined to make sure that it does not drop the ball on its iPoker Network, and the company has saved no effort to continue growing its reach over the past months. The company is now adding Lottomatica, a prominent regulated operator on the Italian market, to its growing iPoker Network in the country. This follows the launch of Goldbet.it a few months back, and establishes the Playtech solution as one of the go-to options for players in the market who want to experience poker options.</p>
<p>Lottomatica is not picked by chance either, as Playtech is aware that in terms of performance in the vertical, the brand is one of the leading options. In fact, Lottomatica ranks in the top five performers in terms of poker market share in Italy in both 2021 and 2022, the company explained in a press release.</p>
<p>This latest partnership is important to Playtech as it is to Lottomatica, helping the brands concentrate players across one thriving ecosystem that will allow everyone to benefit. Playtech VP of Interactive Gaming Marat Koss was proud with the development and said that the company was indeed very happy to have one of the best Italian poker operators join the network.</p>
<p>Koss noted that the Italian network has been growing at a robust pace and Lottomatica’s decision to now join was only a contributing factor. It will help boost not only Playtech’s market position, but also help develop the overall poker vertical in the country. "We are looking forward to a long and successful partnership with one of Italy’s biggest operators," Koss ended on an upbeat note.</p>
<p>Lottomatica Managing Director Betting &amp; Digital Italy at LottomaticaAlessandro Fiumara was similarly happy with the outcome and said that it was a delight to be teaming up with iPoker Network in Italy. He assured that both Playtech and Lottomatica shared a long-term vision for poker, and that is why their partnership was an ideal collaboration.</p>
<p>The two partners bring together more than 50 years of experience and it’s a natural partnership, Fiumara assured. "Everyone here is very much looking forward to continuing to develop our business together," he said. Playtech remains well-represented in the Italian market which, despite its strict regulatory framework, remains one of Europe’s most vibrant places, and has been continually attracting new suppliers.</p>
