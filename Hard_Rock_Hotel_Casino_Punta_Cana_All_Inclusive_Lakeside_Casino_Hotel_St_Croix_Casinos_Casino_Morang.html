<p>Svenska Spel has launched a new sportsbook platform based on a B2B solution from SBTech, now owned by DraftKings.</p>
<p>Svenska Spel Launches New Sportsbook</p>
<p>State-owned enterprise Svenska Spel has released a new sportsbook platform for the Swedish gambling market. The website is built on software owned by US sports betting operator DraftKings.</p>
<p>According to the company, the new platform is built with the customer in mind. It aims to expand the range of sports betting into additional regulated markets and improve customer experience. Most importantly, the platform features two crucial additions – a bet builder and cash out.</p>
<p>Svenska Spel has also stressed that the upgrade would boost the competitive range of its games, secure better functionality and contribute to an overall improvement of player experience.</p>
<p>The software that the new platform is built on was originally developed by gambling software developer SBTech. Svenska Spel and SBTech entered a provisional agreement for the development of the software in question back in September 2019. In April the following year, SBTech was successfully acquired by DraftKings.</p>
<p>Svenska Spel and DraftKings Both Confident in Move</p>
<p>Svenska Spel’s leadership is both thrilled at the opportunities and improvements entailed by the platform and confident in its contribution to the company’s goals.</p>
<p>Svenska Spel Sport &amp; Casino Head of Product Sports Betting And Sportsbook Integrity Dan Korhonen said it was incredibly good to finally be able to offer a new sportsbook to all of the company’s customers. He also noted that Svenska Spel will continue offering competitive odds coupled with fixed betting limits.</p>
<p>DraftKings, which recently launched in the US State of Virginia, has also expressed confidence in the move. DraftKings Chief International Officer Shay Berka said that the company was thrilled to provide Svenska Spel with its award-winning B2B solution.</p>
<p>Berka also stressed that DraftKings and Svenska Spel will improve the gaming experience for players through the Swedish regulated market.</p>
