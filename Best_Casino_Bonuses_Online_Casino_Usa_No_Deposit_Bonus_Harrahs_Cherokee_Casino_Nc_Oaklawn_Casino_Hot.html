<p>The new partnership extension will be valid through October 2033 and will upgrade the Lottery's central lottery system</p>
<p>The leading supplier of technology and solutions, powering gaming and lottery operators across the globe, International Game Technology (IGT), announced a partnership extension with the Virginia Lottery. Announced Monday, the new collaboration extends the partnership between the duo for three years through October 2033.</p>
<p>IGT confirmed that the deal was signed between the Lottery and its subsidiary, IGT Global Solutions Corporation. Besides the three-year extension, the newly inked deal delivers options for further collaboration between the duo via three extensions for one year each.</p>
<p>Per the new agreement, the Virginia Lottery will benefit from enhanced solutions supplied by IGT. It will upgrade its lottery central system, communications network and at the same time, introduce new point-of-sale terminals, promising engaging experiences. The launch of the aforementioned features is expected around October 2025, IGT explained in a statement.</p>
<p>Under the newly extended and enhanced contract, the Lottery will benefit from Aurora, IGT’s newest central retail system. Some 5,500 retail terminals will be replaced with the Retailer Pro S2, allowing the Lottery to benefit from high-speed terminals that are also capable of dealing with large volumes of data.</p>
<p>The contract extension represents an important milestone for the Virginia Lottery and IGT. This is because the duo has been collaborating for more than two decades. Back in 2020, the Lottery selected IGT as the prime provider for instant tickets, while back in 2000, it first gained access to IGT’s leading technology.</p>
<p>Extended Contract to Bring New Experiences</p>
<p>Jay Gendron, IGT’s chief operating officer, global lottery, spoke about the long-term business relationship between the company and the lottery. “The upgraded technology being deployed for the Virginia Lottery as part of our latest extension will offer increased flexibility for the Lottery to easily manage its back-end operations,” he added. Finally, Gendron said that the introduction of IGT’s progressive jackpot feature promises to deliver exceptional experiences for players in Virginia.</p>
<p>“Since first partnering with the Virginia Lottery in 2000, IGT has helped us responsibly modernize our lottery offerings and drive sales growth for our business.“ Tony R. Russell, interim director of the Virginia Lottery</p>
<p>Tony R. Russell, the Virginia Lottery’s interim director, also praised the collaboration between the Lottery and IGT which spans more than two decades. He explained that this strategic long-term partnership enabled the Lottery to grow its operations while ensuring responsible offering. Finally, Russell predicted that the improvements under the new contract will not only deliver new experiences for players across the state but also help raise revenue for public education via Virginia’s K-12 program.</p>
