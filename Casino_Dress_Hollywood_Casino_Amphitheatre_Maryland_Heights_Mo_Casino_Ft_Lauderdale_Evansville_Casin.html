    <h1>Casino Dress Hollywood Casino Amphitheatre Maryland Heights Mo Casino Ft Lauderdale Evansville Casin</h1>

<p>N1 Partners has become the first company to launch SOFTSWISS’s newest iGaming solution, the SOFTSWISS Jackpot Aggregator. The product allows the affiliate group to build up a range of custom-defined jackpot campaigns for its customers.</p>
<p>The Jackpot Aggregator was introduced to the public late last week. The software is designed specifically for the needs of casino operators, gaming providers, or aggregators who seek to generate an unlimited number of jackpots simultaneously. The solution is part of the so-called JaaS – Jackpot as a Service – software solutions. It can scale and increase the efficiency of an iGaming business by outsourcing a variety of different jackpots.</p>
<p>Fresh Off the Assembly Line</p>
<p>The two companies’ executives were happy to comment on the deal and its importance for the industry. N1 Partners Group CPO Yaroslav Laptev expressed his content about the deal and its benefits, explaining:</p>
<p>“It takes our projects to the next level: players can participate in jackpot draws by playing their favorite online casino games.” N1 Partners Group CPO Yaroslav Laptev</p>
<p>According to him, integrating the solution has already led to increased gaming activity and new players. SOFTSWISS founder Ivan Montik also expressed his enthusiasm in signing the contract with N1 Partners Group. He revealed that the product had been intentionally designed to help and support the work of companies such as N1. Montik added that SOFTSWISS had created the Jackpot Aggregator to help the industry become more appealing to the general public.</p>
<p>Part of a Stable Relationship</p>
<p>This is not the first deal between N1 Partners Group and SOFTSWISS. In September, both companies launched a new sports betting platform in Nigeria. The SOFTSWISS Sportbook is the companies’ first sports betting initiative in Africa.</p>
<p>In July, the online platform N1 CASINO launched in Greece, utilizing SPORTSWISS’ software and the N1 Partners Group network. In December 2020, JooSports, a betting platform by N1 Partners Group, was the first to sign up for SoftSwiss Sportsbook Platform.</p>
<p>What is JaaS or ‘Jackpot as a Service’?</p>
<p>The new product by SOFTSWISS allows its user to generate a variety of jackpot campaigns. By using just a few settings, it is possible to create simple or complex jackpots with various factors in the parameters list.</p>
<p>It arrives with pre-build settings and templates, consolidates players within teams, and offers complete transparency with data and statistics. According to SOFTSWISS, JaaS solutions will allow gaming operators to unload some of their operations and optimize their operations while keeping the players engaged. For example, the solution allows players to participate in multiple campaigns, thus increasing their chances of winning.</p>
