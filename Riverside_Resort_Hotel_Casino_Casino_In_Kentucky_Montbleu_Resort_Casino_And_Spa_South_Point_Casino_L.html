    <h1>Riverside Resort Hotel Casino Casino In Kentucky Montbleu Resort Casino And Spa South Point Casino L</h1>

<p>I followed a link to this casino cuz I saw USA welcome casinos for Bitcoin. I have the screenshot. I go there and all they ask for is an email and your name first or at all. I went on in to deposit and deposited 0.00059813 in Bitcoin which is $30 right now. I bought my bitcoin at $9700 it's now $52,000+ I noticed while I was waiting for the Bitcoin to come through the tab that said profile so I went up to fill out my profile for them and find out that they don't accept USA.</p>
<p>So I contact them on chat and tell them the mistake I made I have to have .001 btc in there to withdrawal although they said they would let me withdraw my money. When I go back to the chat and tell him the issue they basically tell me I have to have that much in there or I can't withdraw and then they threw their agreement at me that everybody clicks without reading. They should not let me deposit without filling out a profile cuz within the profile I will let you know you cannot play there for the USA it's very misleading and I'm not going to get my money back.</p>
<p>I'm not saying it's a rogue casino, I really wanted to play there. And they have fairly good reviews. I just feel that instead of me having to deposit more Bitcoin that I have to buy at eight times the amount that I bought what I deposited with they really could just send my money back if you can accept Bitcoin you can send it there's no sense in throwing an agreement at me and trying to worm your way out of it. Charge me a 5% fee or something who cares but don't just blow me off because I made a mistake.</p>
