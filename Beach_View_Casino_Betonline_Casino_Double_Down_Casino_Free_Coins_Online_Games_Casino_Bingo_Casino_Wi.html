    <h1>Beach View Casino Betonline Casino Double Down Casino Free Coins Online Games Casino Bingo Casino Wi</h1>

<p>https://www.dutchnews.nl/news/2023/03/five-firms-fined-e26-million-for-offering-online-gambling-without-a-licence/</p>
<p>I think the article above says enough. As a Dutch citizen I did everything I could to prevent myself from the gambling trap. In their T&amp;C the casino states :</p>
<p>You are aware that the right to access and use the Website and any products there offered, may be considered illegal in certain countries. Jungliwin is not able to verify the legality of service in each and every jurisdiction, consequently, You are responsible for determining whether Your accessing and using Our Website is compliant with the applicable laws in Your country and You warrant to Us that gambling is not illegal in the territory where You reside or citizen of which you are.</p>
<p>This is simply AGAINST the Dutch law. When people have a disease and try to do everything against gambling addiction, you simply cannot write this in your T&amp;C. It's the same you say "well if killing someone is legal in your country is your responsibility. We give you a gun and good luck". It is insane! These casinos operate in a grey area and take a lot of profit from addicts like me. I did everything I could in order to be not able to gamble and illegal operators like this casino still accept me without any question.</p>
<p>At this moment I do not have access to my account since I asked them to close it. I am aware of the fact that strictly seen I am responsible for my own behaviour. However, I am sick. I try everything to quit gambling and casinos like Jungliwin accept people like me illegally, against the Dutch law, and take money from me. I want to create a prejudice and hope this casino will stop accepting Dutch players.</p>
<p>Because of violation of the Dutch Gambling Act, I think it's more than reasonable to refund my deposits since I should never been able to create an account.</p>
