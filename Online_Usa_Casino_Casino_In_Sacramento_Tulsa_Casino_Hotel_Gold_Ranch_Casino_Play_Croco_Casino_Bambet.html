<p>Yes I played with the third deposit bonus and not the first one. AGB' s are now also completely changed. At the time I was playing there was only a cap of the first welcome bonus of €1500. You can see it in my screenshots above. I even marked it. Now you can of course only see the changed terms and conditions. Previously, there was no limit of €1500 on the first or second or third. Now there is €3000 on the first, €1500 on the second and €1400 on the third. That's how they changed it now and I think it would have been like that in English before, even a bad google translator would take over these lines into German.</p>
<p>That's fraud and you get fooled with really stupid statements like I quote -&gt; it doesn't say that there is no max win for the third deposit bonus &lt;- I see it that way, what doesn't say doesn't apply either!! ! Unfortunately there isn't much you can do about it, lawyer, obtaining a title doesn't help much with their antelope license you probably won't have a chance of getting your money...</p>
<p>Above all, it would have been determined in their system that the limit was €1400 for the third welcome bonus, which is why they left €1500 after the wager of the €3000 in the first deposit bonus. Already not credible.</p>
<p>Achso game history is of course limited to the last 50 activities, so it makes no sense to send them...</p>
<p>A nice win for this company. So that the Lambo can continue to be refueled...</p>
