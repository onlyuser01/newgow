    <h1>Fanduel Casino App New Casino In Lake Charles Casino In Cherokee Nc Casino Bar Lauberge Casino Lake</h1>

<p>Dear lehob77,</p>
<p>In summary, the cases involving this casino and Polish players show that very few have been successfully resolved after contacting the licensing authority. In most cases, there has been no response even after three months. Since the casino is now closed, there is no point in keeping this complaint open.</p>
<p>Following up on our position:</p>
<p>"Regrettably, as no aid has been received from the casino, and no efforts to resolve the situation have been noticed, we are compelled to terminate this and all similar cases from Polish players. Our belief is that blocking the account and confiscating the winnings goes strongly against any terms that should be adhered to, as the player had registered with valid information in the casino and had previously been able to play and withdraw winnings. If a country becomes a restricted jurisdiction, the casino ought to inform its players of the change and permit them all to withdraw their outstanding balances. It appears that a different approach has been taken in this specific instance, and due to the player's description of events and the casino's inability to clarify the situation, we are compelled to classify this complaint as unresolved."</p>
<p>We are now closing the complaint as unresolved. We are very sorry that we couldn't be of more help.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Tomas</p>
