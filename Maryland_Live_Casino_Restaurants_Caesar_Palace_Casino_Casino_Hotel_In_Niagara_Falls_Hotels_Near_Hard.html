<p>The Thursday Night Football game of Week 16 is the New Orleans Saints vs. Los Angeles Rams game, which is played at SoFi Stadium on December 21</p>
<p>Both teams are 7-7 ahead of the Week 16 TNF duel, which could be crucial for their playoff future. The end of the regular season is near, meaning that a loss on Thursday could mean real problems for the losing side.

<p>New Orleans Saints Have Their Eyes on the Playoffs</p>
<p>The New Orleans Saints are sitting top of the NFC South, although with the same record as second-placed Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and with just one win more than the Atlanta Falcons. They will play against each of those teams after the duel with the Rams.</p>
<p>What this all means is that their chance of winning the division looks pretty decent. Plus, even if they fail to do so, they will still be able to make the playoffs via wild card. Of course, all this is possible only if they win at least two of their remaining three games.</p>

<p>It seems that the toughest of those three is the TNF game of Week 16. Not only are they taking on the in-form Rams, but the game is played in LA. That’s where they’re traditionally bad, the evidence being that they won only one of their last five duels with the Rams on the road.</p>
<p>Further, the Saints are 3-4 in away games in 2023, with no wins on the road since October when we saw them beat the Indianapolis Colts.</p>
<p>One thing going in their favor is that their defense has been sensational lately, allowing just four field goals in total in the last two games. Their offense has been doing alright as well, with quarterback Derek Carr throwing for five touchdowns in the last two games.</p>
<p>Los Angeles Rams Want to Keep Their Good Run Going</p>
<p>The Rams are 7-7 overall with four wins happening in their last five games. The only game they didn’t win during this run was an overtime loss to the Baltimore Ravens who are the No. 1 team in the AFC. They’ve been solid defensively, with QB Matthew Stafford throwing for 12 TDs in his last four games.</p>

<p>Their superb form has helped them get in the conversation for a wild card entry to the postseason, but winning the division is out of reach for them. The thing is that the San Francisco 49ers have already secured the No. 1 spot in the NFC West as they’ve got four wins more than the Rams at the moment.</p>
<p>The Rams will play the Niners in the final game of the regular season, while before that, they’ve got to take on the New York Giants on the road. What this practically means is that the most winnable of their three remaining games is the TNF game of Week 16.</p>
<p>New Orleans Saints vs. Los Angeles Rams Prediction</p>
<p>The Saints at Rams odds suggest the home team is more likely to win the Week 16 TNF game. We can only agree – the Rams are a better team and they’re playing on their turf.</p>
<p>But will they be able to cover the 5-point spread? They did it in their last three wins, so we have no reason to believe they can’t do it again.</p>
<p>Picks: Los Angeles Rams -5 (-110)</p>
