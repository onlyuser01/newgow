    <h1>Jackpot Party Casino Angels Of The Wind Casino Monarch Casino Buffet Wild Wild West Casino Isle Casi</h1>

<p>Award-winning developer and supplier of B2B software for the gaming industry GAN has recently announced a new agreement with casino and racetrack operator JACK Entertainment. Under this new agreement, GAN’s sports betting and online gaming platform will be deployed in the casino and racetrack operator’s facilities in Ohio where the two gaming verticals are currently being debated.</p>
<p>The two facilities where GAN’s platform will be deployed include JACK Thistledown Racing, a thoroughbred racing, and gaming property in North Randall, Ohio and JACK Cleveland Casino which is located in downtown Cleveland. At these locations, GAN will be delivering its Enterprise Platform which will include its US-patented iBridge Framework – this will link the GameSTACK Internet Gaming Ecosystem to the casino management system deployed by JACK Entertainment the aforementioned Ohio properties.</p>
<p>GAN’s announcement further revealed that, as per the terms of the agreement, it would be operating its platform from “intra-State infrastructure entirely deployed in the State of Ohio.” This is probably meant to ensure that it is in compliance with the state’s gambling laws.</p>
<p>Speaking on the new agreement, Jeff Berman, chief operating officer of GAN, pointed out that the move is a demonstration of the strategic value of the company’s technology particularly because it “offers clients the ability to build an online community of Simulated Gaming players well in advance of real money internet gambling regulation.”</p>
<p>Previous Partnership</p>
<p>JACK Entertainment is already an existing client of GAN’s Simulated Gaming Enterprise Platform, which has available online at www.playJACK.com since the initial partnership deal was inked in October 2016. The casino and racetrack operator was an obvious choice for GAN thanks to its very impressive portfolio – in collaboration with its affiliates, JACK owns and operates several gaming properties in Cincinnati, Cleveland, and Baltimore as well as racing facilities in Kentucky and Ohio.</p>
<p>In fact, the casino operator’s complete portfolio includes more than 40 bars, 375,000 square feet of gaming space as well as 4,000 staff members. From all that, the company boasts of over $800 million in gaming revenue.</p>
<p>Any Hopes for Ohio?</p>
<p>As it stands, the legalization and regulation of both online gambling and sports betting are currently being discussed by lawmakers in the state. A number of issues have been brought forward with one of the most pressing ones being about betting on collegiate sports. While a coalition representing the state’s institutions of higher learning has asked lawmakers to keep collegiate games out of any betting legislation, the proponents see college sports as a precious revenue source that they cannot afford to miss out on.</p>
<p>As such, for now, it is likely that the legalization of both verticals might take about a year. Still, it is great to see that operators like JACK Entertainment are already making preparations to venture into that market. The state’s residents definitely have a lot to look forward to.</p>
