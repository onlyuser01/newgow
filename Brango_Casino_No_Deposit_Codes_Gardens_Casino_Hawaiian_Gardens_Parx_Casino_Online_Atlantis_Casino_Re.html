<p>The 2023 Formula 1 is coming to Italy this weekend. The Monza Circuit is the place where the Italian Grand Prix will take place on Sunday, September 3</p>
<p>The Italian GP is one of the F1 events with the longest tradition, having been run for more than a century. Winning this race is a thing of prestige, but even if that wasn’t the case, we’d still see all of the drivers be super motivated to win on September 3.</p>
<p>Max Verstappen’s motivation is to keep on winning. If he finishes the 2023 Italian Grand Prix before anyone else, it’s going to be his 10th win in a row. The motivation for Sergio Perez is to catch up with Verstappen, whom he’s trailing behind by 128 points in the F1 Drivers’ Championship standings.</p>
<p>Fernando Alonso is also coming to Italy with big ambitions. The Spaniard is hopeful he can cash in on his good form and grab his first win of the 2023 season. Then, there’s Lewis Hamilton, who stands a chance to break the record for most wins on this circuit.</p>

<p>Reasons Why Max Verstappen is the 2023 Italian GP Top Favorite</p>
<p>Max Verstappen is the Italian Grand Prix favorite because he’s the best driver in the world in 2023. On top of that, he (probably) has the best car in Formula 1.</p>
<p>The Dutchman has also been in top form, winning each of the last nine races. In fact, this season, he only failed to win two races, finishing second each time.</p>
<p>Further, this guy has already won one race in Monza. It happened last year, but Verstappen probably doesn’t rate his performance in that race very highly. It’s because all sorts of strange things happened that day with the safety car being deployed due to an oil leak.</p>
<p>The race ended on the 53rd lap with Verstappen winning the No. 1 spot on the podium. Knowing this, it’s very likely that Verstappen is very motivated to do it regularly this time.</p>
<p>Drivers Who Could Ruin Verstappen’s Plans</p>
<p>Max Verstappen is the main favorite to triumph on Sunday with the Italian GP odds of -380. The No.2 on the list of top F1 Monza favorites is Sergio Perez who’s priced at +950. Verstappen’s teammate from Red Bull Racing is sitting second in the Drivers’ Championship standings, and his and his team’s plan is to stay there.</p>
<p>He’s got 33 points more than Fernando Alonso of Aston Martin who’s his main rival for the second spot in Formula 1. What’s got to worry Perez is that Alonso has improved his form a lot lately.</p>
<p>In the first race after the summer break, the Spanish driver finished second. Before that race, he failed to get onto the podium in four straight events. However, unlike the two Red Bull drivers, he’s still without a single win in the 2023 F1 season.</p>
<p>Another driver who’s determined to get at least one win in 2023 is Lewis Hamilton. At one point, the Englishman was dubbed a potential GOAT of Formula 1, but that’s no longer the case. And many blame Mercedes for this. However, some improvements have been made to his care, so the 38-year-old might be set to improve his performance.</p>
<p>2023 Italian GP Prediction</p>
<p>Max Verstappen looks unbeatable in 2023. We think it’s very likely the Dutchman will win every single race until the end of the season, including the one on Sunday. In fact, the most interesting question about the Italian GP isn’t who’s going to win it, but who’s gonna finish second. So, who will it be? Our pick is Alonso.</p>
<p>Picks: Max Verstappen to win; Fernando Alonso to finish second</p>
