    <h1>Casino Fallsview Niagara Texas Online Casino Concord Casino Hard Rock Casino Cincinatti Flamingo Cas</h1>

<p>Relax Gaming has revealed plans to appoint Simon Hammon as its new chief executive officer. The new appointment is a continuation of the company’s strategy to nurture and develop talent internally, trusting seasoned industry veterans who understand how Relax Gaming operates and what it needs to move forward with its strategic and growth objectives.</p>
<p>New Chief Executive Committed to Relax’s Vision</p>
<p>Hammon, who is presently serving as chief product officer, will be replacing Tommi Maijala who has been in this position since November 2019. He will remain the incumbent until the end of 2022 when Hammon will officially make the switch. His stint with Relax Gaming for the past ten years as the company’s CPO has taught him all there is to know about the gaming aggregator and developer.</p>
<p>The company itself has been around for 12 years, building a reputation as some of the most accomplished developers and purveyors of bingo, poker, casino, and aggregation products available to iGaming companies globally.</p>
<p>Relax Gaming has positioned itself as one of the most prominent developers in the dynamic market which has evolved rapidly over the past years, not least under Hammon’s stint as part of the company. This change was welcomed by board members and Hammon himself. Commenting on his appointment, he said:</p>
<p>I’m truly honored to take on the position of CEO at Relax Gaming. As a company, we’ve continued to grow from strength to strength over the last few years and we represent a world class offering across all verticals. Relax Gaming CEO-elect Simon Hammon</p>
<p>He continued by saying that a company is only as strong as its team members, and argued that the Relax team was passionate about taking the company to the next level. The company is one of the true iGaming behemoths, Hammon explained, and it has the market power and brand to succeed.</p>
<p>Realizing the Company’s Full Potential</p>
<p>Relax Gaming has a bright future ahead of it, the newly-elected executive said, and it is bound to fulfil its vision of global expansion. His appointment was welcome by Relax Gaming chairman of the board Patrik Österåker who had this to say:</p>
<p>We’re absolutely delighted to announce Simon Hammon as Relax Gaming’s newest Chief Executive Officer. Relax is continuing steadfastly on its journey to claim an ever-larger footprint in the gambling industry, and we believe Simon with his experience, knowledge and vision is the perfect person to lead the team in the coming years. Relax Gaming chairman of the board Patrik Österåker</p>
<p>Österåker also used the opportunity to thank the outgoing chief executive who has been instrumental in making sure that Relax Gaming stays committed to its long-term goals. Under Hammon, this process should continue.</p>
