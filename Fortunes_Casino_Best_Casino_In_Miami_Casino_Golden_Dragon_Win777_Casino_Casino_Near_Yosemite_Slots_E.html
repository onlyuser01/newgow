    <h1>Fortunes Casino Best Casino In Miami Casino Golden Dragon Win777 Casino Casino Near Yosemite Slots E</h1>

<p>OutAbsolutely horrible experience!</p>
<p>I received a non-deposit bonus of $40 from this casino back on 3/5/23, and butsuccessfully finished the playthrough with a remaining balance of $250. At the time, the customer support team members were so friendly and helpful, and I remembered saying, "I think I might have found a new favorite site!"</p>
<p>What I've experienced since then can only be described as egregiously fraudulent. It has been 4 weeks now, still no payout. They've run the whole gambit of suspect excuses; First, it was a max cash out of $120 for the bonus. Then, after they reduced my account to that level, thet informed me that their minimum WITHDRAWAL is $150, so I had to make a deposit of $30, and lo and behold, I beat that as well, and eventually was sitting at $150, waiting on the KYC process. They every well-known bullshit trick on the books, including a few new ones I had never heard before. Long long story even longer, Tomorrow will be 4 weeks on the dot since I won on their site. Not a damn thing in return. They mentioned yesterday that it would be slated for, and sent today. (Since I was told that they had to verify that my cryptoaddress was a static one.) I've sent them documents for account verification 5 times. I don't believe they ever intended on me winning, or paying me, and they damn sure don't seem to be being straight with me from day one. I understand the necessity to have some KYC policies in place, but this has literally been longer than all casinos KYC that I've completed.. COMBINED. But, as is standard practice in pretty much all these online casinos, they were able to take my bitcoin out within minutes. Lmao</p>
<p>I am seeking a resolution to this matter in the form of my $150. I don't want to keep my account there, and I don't intend to ever play on this site again, byeven if it's for free. I just want my rightful earnings, and I want to post this here to inform others about the miserable experience I've had in hopes of keep others from investing their time, money, and emotions into this site. Overall, out of the more than 70 casinos I've played at online, Slots Empire ranks DEAD LAST.</p>
