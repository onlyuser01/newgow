    <h1>The Point Casino Ethereum Casino Buffalo Seneca Casino Funnest Casinos In Vegas Four Points By Shera</h1>

<p>After leading Ocean Casino Resort for nearly two years, Terry Glebocki resigned from her position as CEO. While she was acting as CEO, Glebocki helped the property overcome significant financial difficulties. Moreover, thanks to the decades of financial management experience, Glebocki helped Ocean Casino become a leading resort in Atlantic City.</p>
<p>Terry Glebocki Resigns from Her Position of CEO at Ocean Casino</p>
<p>Ocean Casino Resort’s CEO, Terry Glebocki, announced that she is resigning after leading the property for nearly two years. It was back in December 2019 when Glebocki was appointed as CEO. Before that, she was a part of the company for three months as interim chief executive. Thanks to Glebocki’s financial management, Ocean Casino started making millions. Before her time, the property didn’t come close to making a profit. Moreover, while the venue was still under its previous name, Revel, it was even close to bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Despite the difficulties brought by the pandemic last year, thanks to Glebocki’s management, Ocean Casino made some $21 million in profit. This was effectively one of the most profitable casinos in Atlantic City during the pandemic-impacted 2020. While Glebocki was a CEO, Ocean Casino was renovated. Besides improvements within non-gambling areas, the casino floor was also refurbished. As a result, Ocean Casino was able to increase its revenue and capture customers who did not visit the property solely to gamble.</p>
<p>Glebocki Leaves Ocean Casino in Pristine Shape</p>
<p>Over the last few years, more women have been running casinos, despite that the industry is considered to be dominated by men. Last year, out of nine Atlantic City casinos four were run by women. Now, Glebocki is the second lady to resign from a key position within a casino in the city.</p>
<p>“Terry joined Ocean on the brink of bankruptcy and is leaving the property as a leading casino resort in Atlantic City,” reads a statement released by Ocean Casino</p>
<p>In a statement, Ocean Casino acknowledged that Glebocki has decades of financial management experience. Additionally, the operator said that she was able to help the property gain financial stability. Ocean Casino stressed that when Glebocki joined the property it was near bankruptcy but she is leaving it in pristine shape as one of the leading casino resorts in Atlantic City.</p>
<p>The operator did not disclose a reason behind Glebocki’s resignation. She was appointed president of the Casino Association of New Jersey (CANJ) back in May this year. It is yet to be confirmed if she will remain in this position. Last but not least, Ocean Casino thanked Glebocki for her service.</p>
