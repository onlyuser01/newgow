<p>NetBet Italy, a major local online casino operator, has further diversified its portfolio with the addition of games developed by RAW iGaming. As a result, the former company will be able to bring some of the most disruptive titles in iGaming to its fans.</p>
<p>Under the agreement, Raw iGaming will supply NetBet with premium slot games. The deal covers titles featuring the innovative SuperSlice engine that offers dynamic slices to every wheel design. Thanks to this solution, players could always hit a multiplier trigger, a high or low-value symbol, free spins, re-spins, expanding wilds or an empty space.</p>
<p>The unmatched thrill provided by Raw iGaming and its engaging SuperSlice solution is something that NetBet hopes players will adore. For reference, the deal will allow NetBet’s Italian customer base to experience unforgettable games such as Mad Joker Super Slice, Blackbeards Super Slice Rings and Popeye vs Brutus Super Slice.</p>
<p>The agreement reflects NetBet’s ambition to keep diversifying its slots catalog, allowing its offering to appeal to all kinds of iGaming enthusiasts. To that end, the company has been pursuing agreements with notable suppliers, such as the current deal with Raw iGaming. Some of its latest deals include partnerships with companies such as G Games and ESA Gaming.</p>
<p>The Start of a “Great Partnership”</p>
<p>Thomas Wood, RAW iGaming’s chief executive officer, praised the new deal, calling it a “great partnership.”</p>
<p>This is a great partnership that will allow NetBet players to access our truly thrilling online casino content for the first time. Thomas Wood, CEO, RAW iGaming</p>
<p>Wood is certain that the unique content produced by RAW iGaming will help NetBet stand out from its competitors. He noted that the studio’s slots are sure to have players come back for more.</p>
<p>Claudia Georgevici, NetBet Italy’s PR manager, also commented on the new deal. She said that NetBet prides itself on creating robust relationships with its providers. Welcoming RAW iGaming to the list of NetBet partners, Georgevici praised the studio for the quality of its games.</p>
<p>They truly are ahead of their time with their unique graphics and intuitive gameplay, and we are certain that this will be the start of a fantastic partnership that will last for many years to come. Claudia Georgevici, PR manager, NetBet Italy</p>
<p>Earlier this year, RAW iGaming penned another Italy-facing deal, this time with SKS365. As agreed, the studio injected games into the latter company’s aggregation platform.</p>
