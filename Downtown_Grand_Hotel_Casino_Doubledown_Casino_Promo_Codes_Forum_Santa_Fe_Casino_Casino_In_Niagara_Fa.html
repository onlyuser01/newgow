<p>The next stop on the Formula 1 journey is the 2023 Hungarian Grand Prix. The race is scheduled for Sunday, July 23, at the Hungaroring Circuit in Mogyorod, a couple of miles from Budapest</p>
<p>We’ve been doing great with our 2021 Formula 1 predictions, but to be completely honest, it’s not because we’re the greatest F1 betting experts on the planet. Instead, it’s because we’ve been backing Max Verstappen.</p>
<p>In 2023, this guy’s been nothing short of brilliant. He’s won eight of the 10 races run so far, finishing in second place each time he missed the No. 1 spot. The Dutchman won each of the last six Formula 1 races, which is why it’s no surprise he’s a -300 favorite to win in Hungary. So, the big question is should you back him to win again?</p>
<p>2023 Hungarian Grand Prix Formula 1 Odds</p>
<p>Moneyline Odds Max Verstappen -300 Sergio Perez +1100 Fernando Alonso +1100 Lewis Hamilton +1400 Carlos Sainz +2500 Charles Leclerc +2000 Lando Norris +1600 George Russell +2800 Oscar Piastri +10000</p>

<p>Should Everyone Keep Backing Max Verstappen?</p>
<p>It seems that in 2023, the key to betting success is to back Max Verstappen every time. Priced at -300, he’s the main favorite to win the Hungarian GP, meaning that on a $300 bet, you stand a chance to win a profit of $100. That’s not bad, considering how impressive he and his car have been this season.</p>
<p>Verstappen really looks unstoppable at this point. Not only does he keep winning everything, but he’s been breaking/setting some records along the way. Plus, he stands a chance to cement his name as the GOAT of motorsports if he keeps on winning.</p>
<p>One record he won’t break anytime soon is the one for the most wins at the Hungarian GP. That record is held by Lewis Hamilton, who has eight wins on this circuit. Verstappen only has one win so far, but the win in question happened last year, which makes him the reigning champ of Hungary. Will he be able to defend his title? We say yes!</p>
<p>Lewis Hamilton Looking for Another Podium Finish</p>
<p>Before Max Verstappen took over, Lewis Hamilton was the sovereign ruler of the F1 world. He still has the skillset needed to dominate the tracks, but his car might not be as good as Verstappen’s. Nevertheless, he’s been doing relatively okay in 2023.</p>
<p>Right now, the Englishman is fourth in the World Drivers’ Championship standings with 121 points. He doesn’t have a chance to catch up with Verstappen, but he could challenge for the No. 2 spot. For that, he will need to grab a few more podium finishes before the end of the season.</p>
<p>The 2023 Hungarian GP looks like an ideal opportunity for that, given that he’s had some great moments on this circuit. Plus, Hamilton’s been on a pretty decent run lately, getting a podium finish in three of the last four races.</p>
<p>2023 Hungarian GP Prediction</p>
<p>Max Verstappen is winning this race, we’re almost 100% sure of it. But if he’s going to fail, it’s Lewis Hamilton who’s gonna take his place. Still, we wouldn’t bet on it. Instead, it’s much safer to back the UK driver to finish in second or third spot.</p>
<p>Picks: Max Verstappen to win; Lewis Hamilton to finish in the Top 3</p>
