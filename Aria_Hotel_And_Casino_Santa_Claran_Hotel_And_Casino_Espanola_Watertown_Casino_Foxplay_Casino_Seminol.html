<p>Probably the most interesting of all ten MLS duels scheduled for Saturday, June 18, is the one taking place at Lumen Field in Seattle. That’s where the Seattle Sounders will welcome Los Angeles FC.</p>
<p>Our prediction for this game is that it’s going to be a real barnburner, but which team will be the happier side after the referee blows the final whistle? Let’s see what online sportsbooks have to say on the subject.</p>

<p>Seattle Sounders Missing Several Key Men</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Seattle destroyed the Vancouver Whitecaps 4-0 at home, which was their fourth win in the previous five MLS rounds. It was a brilliant performance, no doubt about that, but this Saturday, they got a much harder job on their hands.</p>
<p>Beating LAFC or even getting a draw against the Californians is going to be very difficult. It’s not just that Los Angeles players are among the best in the league. It’s also because the Sounders will miss a couple of their crucial men.</p>
<p>Two players are injured, namely, Yeimar Andrade and Joao Paulo. Further, three players will miss the clash with Los Angeles due to international duty. One of those is Seattle’s designated player, Slovak midfielder Albert Rusnak. The other two are American internationals, Jordan Morris and Cristian Roldan.</p>
<p>LAFC Players in the Perfect Mood for Soccer</p>
<p>Online bookmakers think of Los Angeles FC as the #1 favorite to win the 2022 MLS Cup, giving Steve Cherundolo’s boys the odds of +550. Although we’re still only in the regular season of the 2022 MLS, these guys seem to be on the right road.</p>
<p>They’re currently topping the Western Conference table with 29 points (9-2-3 record) after 14 matches. That’s four more than the closest teams behind – FC Dallas and Real Salt Lake.</p>
<p>Things are about to get even better for LAFC in the near future. The story goes that earlier this week, the franchise confirmed the capture of legendary Italian defender, Georgio Chiellini.</p>
<p>Although the World Cup winner is turning 38 this summer, he sure is going to mean a lot for LAFC’s defense. With him in the backline, they’re likely to do even better.</p>
<p>However, before he starts playing Steve Cherundolo will have to make use of what he’s got at the moment. The defenders he has at his disposal might not be elite. In fact, This team has no designated players in its defense.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, their only designated player at the moment is Carlos Vela. Unfortunately, the Mexican will miss Saturday’s game due to an injury. Still, that probably isn’t going to ruin their chances of winning. In fact, he’s been out for weeks now, and his teammates have been doing more than well.</p>
<p>Seattle Sounders vs Los Angeles FC Prediction</p>
<p>Los Angeles FC players are in high spirits ahead of the weekend due to the Chiellini news. You can be sure they will go out onto the pitch fired up, ready to add another three points to the tally. Sure, the Sounders will fight back, but they probably won’t be able to outscore the opposition.</p>
<p>Picks: LAFC to win; Over 2.5 goals</p>
