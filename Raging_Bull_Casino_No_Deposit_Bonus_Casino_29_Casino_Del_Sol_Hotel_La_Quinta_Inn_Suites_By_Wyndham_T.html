<p>The provider continues to expand its global presence with a debut of its engaging and quality games in Portugal</p>
<p>The fast-growing provider of mobile-focused gaming content, Gaming Realms, continues to expand its global footprint. The company joined forces with the leading online gambling operator, Betclic, allowing it to expand the reach of its games to Portugal. The latest collaboration marked the debut of Gaming Realms’ games to customers in the country, delivering them to new audiences.</p>
<p>Thanks to the new collaboration Betclic’s customers will be able to enjoy the provider’s popular Slingo titles. Such include the fan-favorite Slingo SuperSpin, as well as Slingo Starburst and Slingo Sweet Bonanza. The aforementioned games are recognized within the iGaming sector, considering they deliver unrivaled experiences.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, the partnership will impact positively the operations of Betclic as it will expand its offering to players in Portugal. At the same time, the new content agreement complements Gaming Realms’ growth and allows it to further expand its presence in Europe.</p>
<p>The launch with Betclic comes on the heels of another important deal announced by the iGaming content supplier earlier this month. At the time, Gaming Realms confirmed it joined forces with bet365, the globally recognized gaming and betting giant. Per that deal, Gaming Realms significantly expanded the reach of its quality games to new audiences across the globe.</p>
<p>The Entry in Portugal Marks Another Milestone for the Company</p>
<p>Geoffroy Villiot, Betclic’s head of CRM operations, spoke about the unique experiences the games provided by Gaming Realms bring. He revealed that those titles cater to a wide range of audiences, delivering thrilling experiences by combining bingo and slots. Finally, Villiot said: “This collaboration will see us add a new and attractive proposition to our site and we are thrilled to be the first operator to launch their games in Portugal.”</p>
<p>Gareth Scott, Gaming Realms’ chief commercial officer, added that the company’s entry in Portugal underlines its commitment to growing its global footprint and expanding to regulated gambling markets around the world.</p>
<p>“Entering Portugal is a huge milestone for Gaming Realms and is testament to our commitment to distribution across regulated markets globally.“ Gareth Scott, chief commercial officer at Gaming Realms</p>
<p>Moreover, he praised the potential of the regulated gambling market in Portugal. Finally, Scott said that the new collaboration represents a fantastic opportunity for the company to introduce its content.</p>
<p>Late last month, Gaming Realms announced another important partnership. At the time, the company uncovered details regarding a new Pennsylvania-facing deal with Bally’s Interactive. Under the terms of that collaboration, Gaming Realms agreed to supply the operator with its engaging Slingo games, expanding further its US-facing footprint.</p>
