<p>Wynn Resorts Experiences Financial Revival in Q1 2023, Resumes Dividend Program</p>
<p>Operating revenues for the first quarter of 2023 reached $1.42 billion, representing a significant increase of $470.3 million compared to the same period in 2022. Net income also experienced a notable turnaround, with $12.3 million reported for Q1 2023, compared to a net loss of $183.3 million in Q1 2022.</p>
<p>Craig Billings, CEO of Wynn Resorts, praised the team’s commitment to delivering top-notch hospitality and experiences, stating: “For the first time in over three years, each of our resorts is generating strong financial results, which is once again a testament to our team’s relentless focus on delivering five-star hospitality and experiences to our guests.”</p>
<p>The company’s success was highlighted by the exceptional performance of its resorts in the United States. Wynn Las Vegas and Encore Boston Harbor achieved record-setting adjusted property earnings during the first quarter, showcasing their strong performance and robust financial results. In Macau, Wynn Resorts experienced a significant return of visitation and demand, particularly in their mass gaming and retail businesses, following several challenging years.</p>
<p>As a result of the company’s robust financial position, Wynn Resorts announced the resumption of its quarterly dividend program. Stockholders of record as of May 23, 2023, will receive a cash dividend of $0.25 per share, payable on June 6, 2023.</p>
<p>Macau and Las Vegas Operations Flourish</p>
<p>The positive financial results were further broken down by individual properties. Wynn Palace, the company’s resort in Macau, reported operating revenues of $369.4 million for the first quarter of 2023, representing a significant increase of $206.0 million from the same period in 2022. Wynn Macau also performed well, with operating revenues of $230.7 million, up $95.6 million from Q1 2022.</p>
<p>The Las Vegas Operations of Wynn Resorts saw a substantial increase in operating revenues, reaching $586.8 million for the first quarter of 2023, compared to $441.2 million in Q1 2022. Encore Boston Harbor reported operating revenues of $216.3 million, showcasing growth with an increase of $25.5 million from the previous year.</p>
<p>With a cash and cash equivalents balance of $3.84 billion as of March 31, 2023, Wynn Resorts remains financially strong. However, the company has a total current and long-term debt outstanding of $12.25 billion, consisting of various debt components related to its operations.</p>
