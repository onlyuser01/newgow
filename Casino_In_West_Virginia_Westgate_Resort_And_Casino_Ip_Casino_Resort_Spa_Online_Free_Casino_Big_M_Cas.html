Online NGR was up 7%, increasing to a 10% rise on a constant currency basis, meaning Q3 was the 23rd consecutive quarter of double-digit growth online.

<p>Entain CEO Jette Nygaard-Anderson said: "These results demonstrate Entain’s continuing ability to deliver sustainable, consistent and diversified growth."</p>
<p>"We continue to lead our industry in the all-important area of player protection, and I am excited by the early results of our innovative ARC programme, which we firmly believe has the potential to transform player protection across the industry."</p>
<p>"By offering customers ever more engaging products, while leveraging our scale and technology, we will drive the flywheel effects of secular growth dynamics that can triple the size of our business. As a result, we remain very confident in Entain’s future prospects."</p>
