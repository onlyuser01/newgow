<p>It’s time for Game 4 of the Stanley Cup Finals. The fourth game between the Colorado Avalanche and the Tampa Bay Lightning is on the program on Wednesday, June 22 at Amalie Arena. That’s where the Lightning got their first, and so far, only win in the series, which is currently led 2-1 by the Avalanche.</p>
<p>Tying the series is a must for the reigning champions, knowing that the Finals will move back to Denver after Game 4. Although oddsmakers have faith in the boys from Florida, the betting odds suggest they’re going to have a difficult job on their hands on Wednesday.</p>

<p>: Wednesday, June 22 Time: 8:00 PM ET</p>
<p>8:00 PM ET Place : Amalie Arena in Tampa, Florida</p>
<p>: Amalie Arena in Tampa, Florida How to Watch: ABC</p>
<p>The Lightning Needs to Win on Wednesday</p>
<p>Both finalists rely on home support a lot. The evidence of this is that the Avalanche won both of the games played in Denver, while the Lightning won the only game played in Tampa. The champions need to win another home game, as otherwise, things would get much, much harder for them.</p>
<p>The last time they played in Colorado, they lost 7-0, showing that playing on the road isn’t something they like very much. At home, it’s a whole different story. They defeated the Avalanche 6-2 on Monday evening at Amalie Arena, which was their eighth straight home win.</p>
<p>What we saw in that game is that the Lightning played as a team, with each player giving his utmost. The proof of this is that each of the six goals scored by Tampa was the work of a different player. Further, seven different players made an assist in the game.</p>
<p>They did great both offensively and defensively, showing the world that they still got it. Based on that performance, it’s only logical to assume they’re going to win Game 4. Of course, you can be certain that the Avalanche players will do all in their power to ruin their plans.</p>
<p>A Win at Amalie Arena Could Mean Winning the Stanley Cup</p>
<p>At home, they’re always thought of as favorites. That said, the Avalanche will probably be favored by the bookies once the series moves back to Colorado. And if they manage to get a win on the road, they will have a relatively easy job on their hands.</p>
<p>If they make it 3-1 on Wednesday, they will need to win just one game at home to get ahold of the Stanley Cup. Of course, that’s much easier said than done, knowing that their opponents are superb at home.</p>
<p>Still, the Avalanche do have a relatively good record when playing in Tampa with four wins in the past seven meetings.</p>
<p>Colorado Avalanche vs Tampa Bay Lightning Prediction</p>
<p>These are the two best teams in the NHL, which is why anything can happen in their duels. No one should be surprised if the Avalanche win on Wednesday, although we do think the Lightning are more likely to win.</p>
<p>What seems almost certain is that Game 4 of the Stanley Cup Finals will be packed with excitement. We should see plenty of goals on both ends.</p>
<p>Picks: Tampa Bay Lightning to win; Over 6 goals</p>
