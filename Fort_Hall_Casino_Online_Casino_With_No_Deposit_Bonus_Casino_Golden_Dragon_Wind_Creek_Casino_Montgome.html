    <h1>Fort Hall Casino Online Casino With No Deposit Bonus Casino Golden Dragon Wind Creek Casino Montgome</h1>

<p>Gaming Innovation Group Inc. (GiG) has appointed Richard Carter as its new Chief Executive Officer for Platform &amp; Sportsbook. His entering the position ensures that one of the company’s most important verticals has an experienced leader at the helm and will continue to drive strong results for GiG across the board. He will be assuming his new position in the third quarter of the year.</p>
<p>As the company has been in the process of reviewing its divisions and operations, it has become evident that GiG needs a more tailored approach to leverage its assets strategically and improve financial flexibility.</p>
<p>Carter makes a very strong fit for the division, as he previously served as Chief Executive at SBTech, where he spent five years, and helped the sports technology provider to complete the merger with DraftKings, part of a three-way deal. His appointment comes after months of searching for the right candidate.</p>
<p>He previously served as Chief Executive at Bragg Gaming Group and has a very solid track record in the gambling industry as a whole. GiG assured that Carter’s appointment comes at an important time for the company, as it is looking to achieve better growth for its Platform &amp; Sportsbook division.</p>
<p>Carter will lead the segment in regulated iGaming markets and continue to ensure that GiG’s interests and position are strengthened. The supplier already delivers solutions to more than 40 clients in over 35 markets. More importantly, Carter will be part of the division’s transformation as GiGi wants to see its Platform &amp; Sportsbook division transformed into a publicly listed SaaS company that is standing on its own.</p>
<p>Innovation and execution will be key philosophies in achieving this further success, a statement by the company reads. Carter himself was very much pleased and excited with the opportunity, arguing that he was delighted to be joining the Platform &amp; Sportsbook as its Chief Executive:</p>
<p>"I can’t wait to get started and am very much looking forward to working with the GiG Platform and Sportsbook team, building on the strong progress to date, and over time helping to unleash and extract the full potential of a standalone GiG platform."</p>
<p>His appointment was similarly hailed by GiG’s Chairmanof the BoardPetter Nylander who said that the entire group was happy to see Carter step into the CEO position. Nylander focused on Carter’s success during his time with SBTech and added that Carter his demonstrated his ability to outline what future steps ought to be undertaken in the Platform &amp; Sportsbook division to drive shareholder value and business.</p>
<p>GiG most recently expanded with Crab Sports, as the company continues to reach new geographies, audiences, and clients.</p>
