<p>Instead, Microgaming sends in Nathan Highmore, a Scotland Yard’s paranormal investigator, who will explore the ghostly Wraith Manor.</p>
<p>A Dark Matter Slot Features</p>
<p>A Dark Matter comes with a generous overall payout at 96.18%, 5 reels and high volatility payouts, making it a perfect fit for high rollers, but also keeping budget players in mind with a 0.05 – 50.00 coins range. There are many useful features to benefit from here, such as:</p>
<p>Invading Wilds</p>
<p>Bidirectional Paylines</p>
<p>Doorknocker Free Spins</p>
<p>Bidirectional paylines are better-known as both-way paylines. Invading Wilds will help you summon two blocks of reels of six wilds. To fulfil the condition, you will need to get the Wilds on either reel two or four.</p>
<p>Once you stake these reels, any Invading Wilds that once again drop on reels two and four will then create another block of wilds in the middle, pushing the total number of wilds to 9. Once the invading wilds enter the middle reel, you will also get a 2x multiplier to help you increase your profits further.</p>
<p>The doorknocker scatter symbols will grant you entrance into the Manor’s lounge and award you 12 free spins. During the free spins bonus level, you will receive an additional free spin for each extra scatter symbol you land on the reels.</p>
<p>A Dark Matter is now available at all Microgaming-associated casinos. The game officially launched on October 22, 2019. On October 9, Microgaming revealed 9 Masks of Fire. The company has collaborated with Slingshot Studios since September 2018.</p>
