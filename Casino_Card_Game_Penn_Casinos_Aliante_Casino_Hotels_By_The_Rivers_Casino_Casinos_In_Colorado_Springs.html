<p>Borgata enters a state with heavy competition</p>
<p>Borgata Hotel Casino &amp; Spa has become the latest brick-and-mortar property in New Jersey to introduce mobile and online sports betting platform.</p>
<p>Borgata Lunches Sports Betting Solution for Online and Mobile Customers</p>
<p>The Borgata Hotel Casino &amp; Spa has revealed its own sports book, which will complement the company’s casino and poker offers. The online sports betting platform comes as a result of the milder regulatory climate in New Jersey since the defeat of the federal ban known as PASPA.</p>
<p>In May, 2018 the Supreme Court of the United State (SCOTUS) found it unconstitutional to ban sports betting on a federal level and said that the decision lied entirely with individual states. New Jersey, Nevada, Delaware and over a dozen more have since pushed for a legal sports betting operation.</p>
<p>Borgata made an official statement earlier in the week, with President &amp; Chief Operating Marcus Glover expressing the company’s satisfaction with the recent developments.</p>
<p>“We are excited to launch BorgataSports.com,” Glover said. “With our customers in mind, we have delivered the ability for existing BorgataCasino.com and BorgataPoker.com account holders to use their current credentials to sign in and access all platforms, allowing for a seamless transition between products.”</p>
<p>Borgata now allows customers to enjoy the full portfolio of betting products online, including on mobile devices and tablets. The company has developed a native iOS and Android apps, allowing customers to experience online betting in the best possible environment.</p>
<p>A Great Portfolio of Bets</p>
<p>Borgata is offering customers a great portfolio of bets, including parlays, straights, and futures. On top of that, the company is happy to offer customers live betting (In-Play) and parlays that can be combined across multiple sports.</p>
<p>Following in the example of other operators, Borgata is hoping up to drum up interest for its online sports betting platform by adding promotional offers. In the case of the NJ-based casino, this translates into a risk-free first wager, up to $250 in cashback and $25 bonus that can be picked up when playing from a company’s casino property.</p>
<p>Bovada Isn’t Lacking for Competitors</p>
<p>Borgata is indeed one of the more exciting entries in the market this year, but it’s far from the first casino. DraftKings became the first operator to enter the vertical shortly after it was legalized. MGM Resorts, another well-established brand, is also offering online and mobile sports betting solutions to New Jersey customers making for a very difficult field of competitors.</p>
<p>There has been a very strong push among UK companies that are now looking to gain an entry into the market as well. They include brands, such as William Hill, 888 and most recently – bet365. As things stand, New Jersey already has</p>
