<p>As the year is nearly out now, the European Gaming &amp; Betting Association (EGBA) has published its annual report, "European Online Gambling Key Figures: 2022 Edition," and looked into the year's performance along with historic data and projections. The report has revealed the significance of both the online and land-based sectors and contributions toward European gambling markets.</p>
<p>Gross gaming revenue in 2022 performed well, hitting €108.5b, and ahead of the numbers generated in 2021. The results were in fact better by 8% than pre-pandemic results. Much of this, EGBA said, was owing to the significant rebound made in the land-based sector which picked up as COVID-19 restrictions were lifted in numerous markets.</p>
<p>Land-based revenue increased by 34% in 2022 to €70.3bn and in fact, accounted for 65% of the total gambling market surveyed by EGBA, the report elaborated. Online gross gaming revenue accounted for 35% of the total in Europe and sat at €38.2bn. In terms of segment popularity, the casino was the most popular vertical in terms of gross gaming revenue.</p>
<p>Casino accounted for 39% of the total revenue, followed closely by 35% for sports and other forms of betting, and lottery came up third. Poker and bingo accounted for 4% and 3%, and skill gaming brought up the rear, accounting for only 1% of the gross gaming revenue.</p>
<p>The online casino generated €14.9bn in gross gaming revenue and sports betting drove another €13.6bn in the online segment. Speaking of mobile betting, the share of mobile devices continued to increase significantly.</p>
<p>While in 2019 54% of the bets were placed on desktop by 2022, only 47% of bettors opted for a desktop online betting platform. This year 53% of all wagers were placed via mobile and EGBA estimates that by 2026, 64% of all bets will be made via mobile.</p>
<p>EGBA was also able to take a look and establish in which markets gamblers participated the most via online options. As such, the Swedish market which was legalized in 2019 led the way with 80% of all gambling activity taking place online.</p>
<p>Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, and the UK came next with 75%, 67%, 65%, and 65% respectively. Interestingly enough, markets driving strong gross gaming revenue, such as Spain, Germany, France, and Italy saw a much smaller online participation in gambling. Spain was in fact the lowest when it comes to online participation by gamblers in Europe and the UK.</p>
<p>The gambling market is set to reach €134bn in 2027, combining both the land-based and online segments in the country.</p>
