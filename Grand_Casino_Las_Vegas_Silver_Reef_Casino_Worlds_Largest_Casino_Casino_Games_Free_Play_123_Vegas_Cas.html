<p>Internationally televised gaming and entertainment brand World Poker Tour has partnered with advance-deposit wagering hub Game Play Network. The deal will see WPT’s online offering expand with the addition of real-money gaming.</p>
<p>GPN Will Boost WTP’s Offering</p>
<p>Through GPN’s patented B2B service, WPT will implement GPN’s wide variety of real-money video poker, poker events, and other casino games to its platform. GPN content is available in 22 states across the US and will be a valuable boost to its new partner’s offering.</p>
<p>GPN is a reputable brand that is officially licensed by the Federal Interstate Horseracing Act to conduct online betting on horse racing. The advance deposit wagering hub is planning to further expand in the future and cover up to eighteen more states.</p>
<p>GPN is happy to ink the deal with World Poker Tour. Its chief commercial officer, Sam Kiki, commented on the deal. According to Kiki, GPN considers WPT to be one of the few poker brands with this level of credibility, prestige, and following. The CCO added that his team feels “thrilled about the opportunity to partner with such an innovative company”.</p>
<p>Kiki is excited to bring GPN’s exciting portfolio of games and tournaments to WPT’s dedicated users. “Combining WPT’s events, personalities, and talent, with GPN’s platform, will unleash a whole new level of bespoke iGaming content,” Kiki concluded.</p>
<p>WTP Praised GPN’s Exceptional Products</p>
<p>Adam Pliska, the chief executive officer of World Poker Tour spoke about the importance of offering a variety of online products to its clients. Pliska said:</p>
<p>“In addition to our extensive live tournament and distribution network global footprint, our online platforms and products make up an ever-growing portion of our company’s portfolio.” World Poker Tour CEO Adam Pliska</p>
<p>Pliska continued that WPT’s loyal fan base exhibits a strong demand for more online offerings. Because of this, the company decided to respond to their demands and partner with a company whose products will be appreciated by its users and improve WPT’s brand.</p>
<p>“After extensive legal and business diligence, GPN clearly stood out in terms of its exceptionally talented team, strong product, and unrivaled market access,” Pliska concluded.</p>
<p>World Poker Tour is one of the leading poker brands. It was founded in 2002 and since then has given out $1.3 billion in prizes. Just this summer, once the COVID-19 restrictions in the United States eased up, WPT held several events across different states and handed out several thousand dollars in prize money. In April, WPT boosted its offering once again by introducing a dedicated NFT marketplace.</p>
