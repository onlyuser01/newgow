<p>The upgrade is based on the expectation of improved leverage in 2023 as Caesars significantly moderates digital losses.</p>
<p>S&amp;P Global Ratings forecasts a 4%-6% increase in Caesars’ casino EBITDA for 2023</p>
<p>Caesars’ digital segment has been a drag on EBITDA over the past 18 months, but Caesars has reduced this in recent quarters as it scales up digital revenue in new states and leverages player loyalty data to more efficiently target its marketing efforts to customers.</p>
<p>Additionally, the company expects to see reduced customer acquisition costs, advertising, and promotional spending as there are fewer states that are scheduled to launch digital sports betting in 2023 compared to previous years.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Caesars’ investments in its regional portfolio and convention and group recovery in Las Vegas will help offset inflationary pressures. Caesars has been able to sustain margins consistently above pre-pandemic levels despite the return of a more normal competitive environment, including the resumption of operations of alternative entertainment options and the elimination of pandemic operating restrictions.</p>
<p>The company will also benefit from the ongoing recovery in group and convention in Las Vegas that will likely support margin. S&amp;P Global Ratings forecasts Caesars’ casino EBITDA will increase 4%-6% in 2023.</p>
<p>Although the shift in spending to experiences from products may continue for a while longer, the surge in leisure spending in Las Vegas and good regional gaming revenue may begin to slow if consumers’ willingness to spend on travel and entertainment in 2023 is hit by reduced accumulated savings, ongoing high inflation, and higher unemployment.</p>

Bakkt and Caesars will be working together to explore how Bakkt’s crypto offerings will differentiate Caesars Rewards and help the company continue to be the leader in the gaming industry.</p>
