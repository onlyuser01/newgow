<p>Livespins is not in the mood of slowing down any time soon as the company which specializes in offering an innovative streaming experience for online casinos has secured a new partnership with Caleta Gaming, a popular Brazilian slot studio.</p>
<p>The partnership sees Caleta Gaming join Livespins innovative platform that allows streamers and content creators to share their gaming sessions with larger audiences. Viewers can bet alongside streamers by using a separate user interface that lets them pick the size of their own bets, as if they were playing the slot in the first person.</p>
<p>Yet, this is a shared social experience that has turned this Livespins project into one of the biggest and most innovative solutions in the industry. Caleta Gaming itself has plenty to bring to the table with its more than 115 games developed by the company’s own team of specialists.</p>
<p>Caleta Gaming similarly has a very strong focus on the Latin American market, and Brazil in particular, with the supplier expected to benefit even more from the fast-evolving local landscape for games. Livespins focuses on social interaction which makes the addition of Caleta Gaming a particularly auspicious moment for both companies.</p>
<p>Caleta Gaming Head of Creative and Product Gabriel Cardoso Mendes was particularly happy to welcome this new opportunity and see his company work closely with Livespins to ensure that it provides great content to leading operators. Mendes hailed Livespins for exploring the "yet mostly untapped" casino streaming vertical.</p>
<p>More importantly, it would allow Caleta Gaming to expand its product offer with players that it has not been able to reach before and engage with Millennial and Generation Z demographics. Livespins Chief Commercial Officer Michael Pedersen has been similarly happy with these developments, welcoming the opportunity to further strengthen the company’s presence in Brazil – which is set to become one of the biggest online gambling markets in the world.</p>
<p>Livespins is firmly committed to growing its footprint in the Latin American region and is partnering with brands locally to establish its footprint. "This is exactly what Caleta Gaming does and its games, combined with our award-winning platform, allow operators to provide next-generation casino experiences that are fully localized," Pedersen concluded.</p>
<p>Livespins has been looking to actively expand and strengthen its portfolio of suppliers. Most recently, the company signed a content-boosting partnership with SlotMatrix, EveryMatrix’s B2B division.</p>
