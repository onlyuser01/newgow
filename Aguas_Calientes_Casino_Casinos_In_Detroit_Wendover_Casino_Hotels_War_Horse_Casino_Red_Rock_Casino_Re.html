If you want to know more about NetEnt games and why they are so popular among your fellow gamblers, read this:</p>
<p>Table of contents:</p>
<p>NetEnt’s path as a gaming provider</p>
<p>Net Entertainment (NetEnt) is one of the most successful casino software providers founded in far 1996 in Stockholm, Sweden. That was literally dawn of online gambling, so the company became one of the pioneers of the industry and was powering some of the world’s first online casinos in the 2000s.</p>
<p>Since then, NetEnt has been delivering casino modules to numerous customers even before it obtained its first license issued by Malta in 2005, followed by the Category 2 license on Alderney in 2010. Later, the provider expanded to the rest of European markets, including online casinos in the UK, Italy, Spain, Denmark, Portugal, Bulgaria, and other countries.</p>
<p>Outside Europe, NetEnt is present in the American gambling markets under licenses issued by New Jersey and British Columbia.</p>
<p>Note: In 2015, NetEnt launched its first land-based slots which are now available at William Hill betting shops in the UK.</p>
<p>The proudest NetEnt achievement to date is its numerous "Mobile Supplier of the Year" awards. They receive it on a yearly basis due to their mobile-first approach and great dedication to the on-the-go casino innovations. It's therefore not a surprise that you will find NetEnt games at the majority of top casino websites.</p>
<p>For example, they were the first company that designed a casino game entirely in HTML5 (so it could be launched on both desktop and mobile) as well as created the first mobile live blackjack in online gambling history. NetEnt generates around 40% of its revenue from mobile gambling and is about to remain on the top of this niche today and beyond.</p>
<p>NetEnt’s contribution to the online gambling world doesn’t stop with NetEnt games and software. For example, some of the company’s employees decided to create their own company, Thunderkick, which is also known for creating engaging and high-quality games that can be played at many Thunderkick casinos online. Although it’s an indirect contribution, it’s fair to say that if it wasn’t for NetEnt, Thunderkick might not exist today.</p>
<p>Famous NetEnt slots and casino software</p>
<p>Players like NetEnt games for their engaging, realistic qualities and great 3D graphics. This software provider offers a wide selection of instant-play casino games, enhanced with captivating visuals and superior sound effects.</p>
<p>The most notable products of Net Entertainment are slots with stylish Scandinavian design, great usability, and simplicity in use. NetEnt has released over 200 casino games, roughly half of which are slot machines.</p>
<p>Note: NetEnt games are popular not only with players, but also with online casino operators selecting games for their promotions. That’s why you will find many free spins for NetEnt games in our list of no deposit welcome bonuses for 2024.</p>
<p>Categories of NetEnt slots</p>
<p>All NetEnt slots can be divided into three categories:</p>
<p>Classic slots;</p>
<p>Video slots;</p>
<p>Progressive slots.</p>
<p>Classic slots</p>
<p>Even though classic slots are not something we see on the main pages of NetEnt online casinos, they remain popular among nostalgic fans of fruit machines. Each classic slot’s interface is pretty simplistic and offers only 3 reels to spin and classic symbols to collect. These games are nice to familiarize yourself with the mechanics of the online slots in general. If you want to give them a try, take a look at Beetle Frenzy, Magic Love, or Mega Joker.</p>
<p>Video slots</p>
<p>Video slots are the category all the most renowned titles belong to. If you ever played any of NetEnt slots, it most likely consisted of 5 reels and at least 9 paylines. Those slots are seasoned with numerous bonuses and features such as scatters, extended wilds, re-spin features, and other mini-games, which make the gameplay especially entertaining.</p>
<p>Progressive slots</p>
<p>NetEnt progressive slots are famous for sky-high jackpots made up of all bets and eventually paid to the luckiest among players. It was a NetEnt slot called Mega Fortune that paid the record-breaking €17.8 million win to the Finnish gambler in 2013 and gained a place in the Guinness Book of World Records.</p>
<p>Note: Most of the NetEnt slots offer an RTP (Return to Player) between 95% and 99% (in Mega Joker slot machine).</p>
<p>Some of their titles are inspired by popular movies and TV series, so you will notice slots dedicated to renowned stories like Terminator, Jurassic Park, Planet of the Apes, etc. in their collection.</p>
<p>NetEnt’s mobile-first approach</p>
<p>Aside from slots, NetEnt designs other popular types of casino games as well, including roulette, video poker, scratch cards, and blackjack. Most of them are run on their trademark Touch platform built on HTML5 technology and therefore are fully compatible with modern Android- and iOS-based smartphones. This means you can play almost any NetEnt game in both mobile and desktop browsers without downloading any apps.</p>
<p>Note: NetEnt table games are offered at relatively low stakes compared to the software provided by other gaming companies. For example, you can bet as little as $0.10 in your blackjack session and $0.25-1.00 in other table games, but it can differ in each casino.</p>
<p>Also, NetEnt has developed its own NetEnt Live Casino software, through which players can play roulette or blackjack hosted by real-life dealers during a live streaming session. As we’ve already mentioned above, it’s available for mobile browsers and is one of the best live casino solutions in the market. Check out our list of live dealer roulette casinos and apply the "NetEnt game provider" filter to find venues that most likely offer these games.</p>
