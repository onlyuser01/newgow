<p>888casino goes all the way back to 1997 when the company launched in the British Virgin Islands. The company was not known as 888 then, but rather was known by the Casino-on-Net brand, which became one of the most successful casinos worldwide, and in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>Shifting into gear, the company decided to create a new brand, and thus 888casino was born, acquiring the necessary licenses, and quickly establishing itself as a household name. Since 2005, 888’s iGaming operations have maintained a dominant position in the UK market, and the casino remains a leader to this day.</p>
