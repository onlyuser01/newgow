    <h1>Little Creek Casino Resort Hard Rock Hotel And Casino Sacramento Hotels Near Four Winds Casino Treas</h1>

<p>Good day everyone,</p>
<p>I now find myself needing to open a case. I played at Emirbet Casino and had a bout of luck, winning â‚¬4,000!</p>
<p>However, there appears to be an issue. The support staff at this casino has been of no help, providing me with false assurances and attempts to "quell" my concerns. They seem to only repeat that they don't have any more information from the "responsible department", even failing to know when the payout department is open. I requested a payout on August 30th and it is now the 4th!</p>
<p>Since, no support staff have been able to provide me with precise information other than that my account is verified, I was compelled to lodge this complaint!</p>
<p>During the first withdrawal, the process took only three days; they asserted that after 48 hours, the withdrawal process would be complete. But now I fear I'm being disregarded like the air and that the money will never arrive!</p>
<p>Furthermore, every member of the staff repeats the same script, the likes of which I've never seen before in customer support!!</p>
<p>They do not send any emails either, despite their constant claims of "keep an eye on your inbox..."</p>
<p>I feel utterly abandoned by Emirbet's support and hope they keep their promise. Please help me.</p>
