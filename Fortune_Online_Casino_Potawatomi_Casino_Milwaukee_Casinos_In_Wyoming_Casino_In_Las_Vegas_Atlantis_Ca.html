<p>Seeking to enhance fan engagement and retention, FanDuel announced a new deal with Incentive Games that will bring exclusive daily free games.</p>
<p>FanDuel to Boost Player Retention under a New Deal With Incentive Games</p>
<p>The leading sportsbook and online casino brand in the US, FanDuel, joined forces with the world’s leading supplier of free-to-play games, Incentive Games. The new collaboration marks the debut of Incentive for the North American market. Under the terms of the new deal, Incentive Games will provide FanDuel with daily free game (DFG) content, seeking to boost player acquisition and retention for FanDuel’s online casino operations.</p>
<p>The games will seek to target both new and existing players within jurisdictions where FanDuel is offering its online casino. Although the games will be free-to-play, they will feature customized prizes for each online player. Undoubtedly, the recent deal matches well with FanDuel’s already proven leading products available in multiple US jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Using free-to-play games is a popular method for increasing player retention. At the same time, those games help reduce customer acquisition costs. Only recently, Incentive Games revealed that its partners using free-to-play games can see an average of 50% increase in week-on-week retention. Moreover, the company’s innovative content also helps reduce the customer acquisition costs by a minimum of 22%. Currently, Incentive Games operates in 36 countries around the world, has 40 clients and offers more than 30 games.</p>
<p>The New Deal Brings Excitement for the Two Companies</p>
<p>FanDuel Group’s VP of iGaming product, Andrew Gradwell, said that the company is always looking for new ways to engage with its players and deliver value at the same time. According to him, thanks to the new daily free game mechanic that Incentive will deliver, FanDuel is going to “excel in this area.”</p>
<p>“We are delighted to be working with the FanDuel brand and company, and we hope this is the start of things to come.” John Gordon, CEO at Incentive Games</p>
<p>Incentive’s CEO, John Gordon, added that the company was looking for the best partner in the US. He outlined that it became clear for Incentive that FanDuel is the best partner from the very first meeting. Gordon explained that the company will be delighted to collaborate with FanDuel. In conclusion, he said that free-to-play games help significantly with customer acquisition which will undoubtedly “allow FanDuel to stand out from their rivals in a hugely competitive market.”</p>
