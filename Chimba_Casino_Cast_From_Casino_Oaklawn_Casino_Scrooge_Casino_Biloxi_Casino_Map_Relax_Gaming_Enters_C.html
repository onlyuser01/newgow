<p>Relax Gaming has teamed up with Greentube, the Novomatic’s interactive division, to provide customers with unique gaming content.</p>
<p>Relax and Greentube Partner up for European Superiority</p>
<p>Leading iGaming aggregator Relax Gaming has entered a new deal with Greentube, Novomatic’s interactive division, to offer exclusive gaming content across regulated European markets.</p>
<p>To start the partnership a selection of proprietary and third-party games from Relax will be deployed with the Estonian online casino brand Fenixbet, the online brand recently launched by land-based operator Novolotto.</p>
<p>In the next few months, the agreement with Greentube is scheduled to spread to other markets like Germany, when iGaming becomes officially legal in the summer of 2021. A further expansion is expected for Relax in some of Europe’s most important markets.</p>
<p>“To be partnering with Greentube is a feather in our cap and one that will further our reach into core European markets,” said Daniel Eskola, Relax Gaming CCO in a statement.</p>
<p>Eskola also commented that Greentube’s strong relationships with Germany will be a major benefit to the Relax’s own growth plans when the regulated online gaming industry launches next year.</p>
<p>“The diversity and quality of the games provided through Relax’s aggregation platform will significantly boost Fenixbet’s offering and we are confident they will be a hit with its growing customer base,” stated Marcantonio Bottaro, Director of Brand Operations RMG at Greentube.</p>
<p>More Games For the Best Gaming Experience</p>
<p>Greentube manages Fenixbet’s online solution, which delivers the RMG platform technology and drives the development of Relax content. Fenixbet customers can now experience the company’s exclusive games, including the recent record-breaking Money Train 2, and smashing titles like Snake Arena and Temple Tumble.</p>
<p>A range of slot machines from studio favorites and rising brands such as Kalamba Games, Fantasma Games and 4ThePlayer has also been added from Relax’s well-selected partner studios Silver Bullet.</p>
<p>As this year was full of opportunities, the latest successful partnership enables Greentube to boost its influence and commercial strength within the industry and achieve growth in all its business branches. The company announced a huge recruitment campaign for 2021.</p>
<p>For its part, Relax Gaming keeps growing its portfolio with industry-leading online content, for example in the UK, with a partnership agreed in May with MrQ, or more recently with casino operator Pinnacle. This strategy allows the company to offer more than 1,500 casino games, including premium slot machines from selected Silver Bullet studios, as well as exciting proprietary content.</p>
