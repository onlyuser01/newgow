    <h1>Carnival Citi Social Casino Seminole Hard Rock Hotel Casino Hollywood Fl Starfield Casino Location P</h1>

<p>I won around $2700 total after deducting the bonus and completing the wager requirements almost two weeks ago. I sent in my verification and expected it done in the two days they quote. After contacting support they informed me that the email address in the provided form didn't receive anything and instructed me in sending over the form to another address.</p>
<p>I informed them that I've been waiting this entire time so I can withdraw my BTC since the BTC withdrawal option was not available. After the support checked and saw it in fact was not available she said she started a manual withdrawal for the BTC on Tuesday OCT 19 2021. A few days later I contacted them again and was told to check my withdrawal options and BTC was an option this time.</p>
<p>I informed the support that a manual withdrawal was already started but she said if I do it myself it would get priority. Guess what? After that they reset my withdrawal time despite the constant contact to support about this they kept insisting that I had to wait another 3 full business days from the date I requested the withdrawal (OCT 21 2012) despite the fact there was a previous manual withdrawal and that a support agent assured me doing the withdrawal myself would expedite the withdrawal. Aside from that on the withdrawal page, it says BTC takes 48 hours! They still insisted I had to wait longer.</p>
<p>It is now OCT 26 2021 four full business days and now they first told me that the cashier department will start processing my withdrawal tomorrow and that it will take yet another 3-5 business days. After responding that they have kept delaying my BTC withdrawal since last Tuesday the support agent said I would have the BTC withdrawal tomorrow. So despite all their support claims, their website CLEARLY claiming 48 hour BTC withdrawals, I still end up having a 7 day/6 business day delay for my withdrawal DESPITE all their contradicting claims that they pushed up/expedited/ rushed my withdrawal. I am beyond peeved at their process methods which are clearly put in place to push you to keep betting. Not even slotocash which has worse process methods can compete to this.</p>
