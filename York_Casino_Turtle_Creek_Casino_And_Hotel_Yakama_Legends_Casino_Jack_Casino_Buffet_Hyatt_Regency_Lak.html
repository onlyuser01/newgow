<p>Bullseye review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Bullseye takes the form of 1960s TV game show in which a bull mascot offers up lifestyle changing prizes based on whether or not you, as the contestant, can hit the bullseye with a dart.</p>
<p>In practice, the way you win prizes is actually by matching symbols from reel to reel, but the conceit shows itself in the Bonus Games (more on this later) and in the choice of symbols: caravans, cars, holidays and cash, all classic prizes from TV shows like The Generation Game.</p>
<p>Big win from free spins bonus feature</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The graphics are high quality, all drawn up in high definition and animated with shiny 3D animations for when you win. Overall the game looks lovely, though a little too much time was put into the bonus animations (see below).</p>
<p>The background music is a piano theme tune from the imagined TV show and though fun to begin with, it grows old very fast. The rest of the sound effects are simple and go with the game show setting.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>The game is a five reel, 243-ways game. This means you can win simply by getting matching symbols on adjacent reels running left to right. This gives you many more ways to win than your average slot.</p>
<p>There are free spins and a bonus game to break up the repetitive pattern and the controls are clear and simple, allowing you to get straight into gaming as fast a possible.</p>
<p>All payouts are multiplied by your "Coin Bet" decided by the number of coins in the "Coin" section of the screen. This is different from the total number of coins bet per spin which is your coin bet multiplied by thirty.</p>
<p>Multiple winlines hit</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>There is a Wild symbol, a Bonus Symbol and a Scatter Symbol.</p>
<p>The Wild stands in for any symbols except the Bonus or Scatter.</p>
<p>Hit two or more Bonus symbols and you get to play the Bonus Board game. A pseudo darts game which is so slow to play it almost saps all the fun out of winning. Each stage of the game sits behind a good ten seconds of animation and there are a lot of stages. You pick five targets on a dart board and win a random prize from behind them.</p>
<p>Another bonus feature - Bully's prize board</p>
<p>The prizes behind each throw are between two and fifteen times your bet per spin.</p>
<p>The Bonus symbol also pays out if you land two or more on a win line paying out 50 times your "Coin Bet" (see above for details), up to 400 times for five symbols.</p>
<p>The Scatter pays out a multiple of your bet per spin (rather than your coin bet). x5 for three, x10 for four and x100 for five. When you win with the Scatter you also get 15 free spins during which all wins are doubled.</p>
<p>Hitting free spins symbol in the bonus game - more free spins for you to enjoy</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The game has an RTP of 96.63% and has a medium to high level of variance.</p>
<p>This RTP is within our preferred range of +96% and the higher variance games play well with some of our recommended strategies.</p>
<p>Low symbols paytable</p>
<p>High symbols paytable</p>
<p>The range of bet sizes are significant on this game with a min bet of $/£/€0.30, this might push out some players who are on a very small bankroll and looking to make sure they can stretch their game-time. The maximum bet on the site we tested was a massive $/£/€150.00 per spin.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Bullseye is well made, pays out an acceptable amount, and works with our favoured strategies. Add to this the enjoyable (if rather slow) bonus game, and the additional free spins feature and you have a winner.</p>
<p>We recommend this to anyone with a bit of nostalgia for shows like The Price is Right.</p>
