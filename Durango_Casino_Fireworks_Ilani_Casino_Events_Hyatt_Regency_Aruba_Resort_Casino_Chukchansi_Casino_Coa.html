    <h1>Durango Casino Fireworks Ilani Casino Events Hyatt Regency Aruba Resort Casino Chukchansi Casino Coa</h1>

<p>The company has been expanding rapidly in the cashless gaming offer as more regulators have seen the value in this solution</p>
<p>Cashless is the new king and International Game Technology (IGT) knows it. The company has signed a multi-year agreement with Graton Resort &amp; Casino in Rohnert Park in California, adding yet another client to its growing portfolio of cashless gaming solutions.</p>
<p>Graton Resort &amp; Casino Leverages Cashless Tech</p>
<p>IGT will help Graton Resort &amp; Casino introduce state-of-the-art cashless gaming through the use of the IGTPay and Resort Wallet solutions, developed specifically to address the growing demand for this type of gameplay.</p>
<p>To make this possible, IGT is deploying its IGT ADVANTAGE casino management system to enable turnkey solutions that will make it easy for Graton guests to enjoy convenient, secure and unobtrusive gameplay. Players may still choose cash over cashless across the 3,000+ slot machines available on the property.</p>
<p>Commenting on this development, Graton Resorts &amp; Casino VP and assistant general manager, Brian Green, said that California is a premier gaming destination, and the property was proud to be able to offer its players leading-edge technologies that add to consumer satisfaction and the gameplay experience. He added:</p>
<p>IGT’s proven Resort Wallet and IGTPay cashless technologies will enable us to drive new operational efficiencies and optimize revenue, while offering our customers a future-forward mobile e-wallet option that comes with a variety of benefits. Graton Resorts &amp; Casino VP and assistant general manager, Brian Green</p>
<p>IGT SVP global video poker, VLT, systems and payments Ryan Reddy was similarly upbeat about the opportunity. Reddy hailed “cashless commerce” as the future of the industry and said that IGT’s solution will make this transition seamless for partners.</p>
<p>Preparing for the Future of Gaming in Land-Based Casinos</p>
<p>Reddy assured that IGT was committed to boosting player convenience and security, boosting growth and differentiating the guest experience with the help of IGT’s Resort Wallet and IGTPay cashless gaming solutions.</p>
<p>Cashless has been an increasingly important solution designed to help businesses, consumers and regulators meet key objectives. The Endeavor Group in Australia has vowed to introduce cashless solutions across its fleet of poker machines.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Australia is debating fiercely whether this measure would indeed help curb criminals laundering money through gaming machines or, rather – alienate customers and make them feel as “criminals.” Yet, unobtrusive cashless solutions such as the ones offered by IGT seem to be the future of the land-based casino industry all the same.</p>
