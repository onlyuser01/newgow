    <h1>Hollywood Columbus Casino Gate City Casino Hotels Near Agua Caliente Casino Lake Tahoe Casinos 7 Fea</h1>

<p>KYC Issues.</p>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Initially, I was asked to verify my address with the Casino: Locowin.com. A rental contract was not accepted as a document. They recommended a "Bank Statement" as an alternative. However, my online bank was not approved. Yet, it's the same bank I use to make deposits. Additionally, the document should not be more than 3 months old. However, in Germany, we only get utility bills or heating cost bills once a year.</p>
<p>My ID has to be verified in order to make withdrawals. Unfortunately, my ID had expired. Hence, I've applied for a new one at my local city hall and will be submitting it soon.</p>
<p>In addition to this, I was asked to also verify my credit card - specifically, the signed back of it. The problem is, I have a transparent card that has no field for a signature.</p>
<p>How can this be resolved? How can I access my winnings?</p>
<p>Could a pension statement be considered a valid document?</p>
<p>Overall, accessing my winnings appears to be very difficult. I constantly have to check whether my documents have been received to expedite their processing.</p>
<p>The Chat is very friendly but offers little help.</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>
