<p>CEO Ivan Kravchuk Highlights Increased Player Rewards in Evoplay’s New Tool</p>
<p>The new promotional tool complements Evoplay’s existing portfolio of slot games, offering players more chances for rewards and enhancing their gaming experience. By displaying the remaining prize pool on-screen, the tool generates anticipation and contributes to player engagement, retention and brand loyalty.</p>
<p>In an effort to cater to diverse markets, Evoplay is providing operators with the flexibility to customize campaigns and materials according to their brand identity and goals. This approach seeks to offer a tailored experience for players while promoting partner profitability.</p>
<p>Ivan Kravchuk, CEO of Evoplay, explained: “Our Random Prize Drops offer players more opportunities to receive rewards while engaging with their favorite Evoplay slots. These network promotions have not only benefited our partners’ performance metrics but also underline our commitment to delivering profitable campaigns.”</p>
<p>Following the successful “Endless Summer Network” tournament, which boosted user engagement, bet amounts, and gross gaming revenue for participating brands, Evoplay’s Random Prize Drops continue to push innovation boundaries in the gaming industry. Evoplay’s Endless Summer Network Tournament featured three tournaments with a €120,000 ($130,000) prize pool running from June 13 to August 22.</p>
<p>Evoplay Triumphs with Industry Recognition and Global Expansion</p>
<p>Beyond collaborations with leading providers like Bragg Gaming, Fortuna Entertainment Group, and Relax Gaming, Evoplay’s industry recognition is evident with nominations in seven categories at this year’s SBC Awards. The studio also secured the Innovation in Mobile award at the EGR’s 2023 B2B Awards, solidifying its status as an innovative gaming supplier.</p>
<p>Evoplay also recently entered into a LATAM-focused partnership with Sportingtech, a prominent online and retail gaming platform provider.
