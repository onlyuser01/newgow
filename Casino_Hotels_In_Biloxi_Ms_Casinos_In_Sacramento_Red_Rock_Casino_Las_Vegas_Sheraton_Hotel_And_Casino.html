    <h1>Casino Hotels In Biloxi Ms Casinos In Sacramento Red Rock Casino Las Vegas Sheraton Hotel And Casino</h1>

<p>so first they cancelled my winnings cause I played a restricted game (which are not locked) so they gave me back my initial deposit. Then when I won again they said they were unable to pay back to my visa card and I need to take wire transfer (however card withdrawal minimum is $100, wire transfer is $350). They say my visa BIN is not listed with them so should they not add it to their list??? Here is what they told me: Not all cards are actually supported for online withdrawal and this is due to the bin of the card that is issued by the card issuer or the bank.</p>
<p>Unfortunately your card is one of these cards. Alternatively you can request for withdrawal through Bank Transfer method.</p>
<p>They advertised payment by visa, and its the same card that I deposited with. Is there anything I can do??</p>
