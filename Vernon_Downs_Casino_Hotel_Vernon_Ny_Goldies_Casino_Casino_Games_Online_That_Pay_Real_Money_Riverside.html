    <h1>Vernon Downs Casino Hotel Vernon Ny Goldies Casino Casino Games Online That Pay Real Money Riverside</h1>

<p>Hello Radka. You ask about the guys that played at the same time I was on my property and if we were playing at the same time there was no one using my wifi except me . They were playing off of there personal Verizon cell service. Only reason I use we if is when I want to play with tablet and not phone. I have come to the conclusion that both casinos are just out to take cause when you start getting lucky a time or 2 it's time for you to go..? As far as the re me remains balance, I had played all day, the last day I played at Candyland.. I deposited multiple times in a 8 or 9 hour time span but there wasn't a remains balance as I was playing and spending a lot ,just having fun. When I went back in later that night to deposit and play the had locked my account. I went to check the email and seen the email saying I was a skilled player and they were just there for for recreation. There is nothing skillful about playing slots when all you do is constantly deposit and play for hours. Eventually you will hit a little something. I still haven't anything from New Vegas . I was there for alot longer than Candyland cause Scott the floor manager for New Vegas recommended I try Candyland a couple months ago and I did and really like it. I will not , knowingly do anything with my online casinos to jeopardize my accounts cause I play everyday. It is just a pastime of mine that I enjoy. With that being said , they have the right to lock your account and only the shady ones will find a excuse when someone happens to get lucky a couple times . The more you play the more of a chance you have of winning. That is the only reason I hit the little bit I do... Thank you Radka, for looking into it for me.. I really appreciate it... If for nothing else to just expose them for shady actions so maybe someone reading this won't get caught up with them ..If you have anymore questions I am always here,....,..</p>
