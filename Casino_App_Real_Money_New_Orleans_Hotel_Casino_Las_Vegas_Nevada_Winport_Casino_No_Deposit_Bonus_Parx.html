    <h1>Casino App Real Money New Orleans Hotel Casino Las Vegas Nevada Winport Casino No Deposit Bonus Parx</h1>

<p>Yes, Coleortiz, everything happened at the end of May 2023.</p>
<p>There is one screenshot with the Varo Bank Account Statement, where I can see only transactions from May 10 to May 12, 2023, which is irrelevant. Then there are 2 screenshots showing a few transactions made on May 26, 2023, but it is not clear which one is the one made to the casino. Instead, I can see only 1 transaction ("purchase of BTC") that was debited from your account, but it does not match any of the deposited amounts to the casino. Therefore, apart from the screenshot from your casino account, all other screenshots are irrelevant. Maybe you did not check the correct payment method.</p>
<p>However, in the meantime, I was provided with the game history from your disputed casino account.</p>
<p>From the game logs, it is clear that:</p>
<p>The first deduction was made legitimately by the casino upon meeting the wagering requirements</p>
<p>At the point of having a balance of $60 that could have been withdrawn if you had deposited $40, instead of making a deposit, you continued playing</p>
<p>You indeed accumulated $2425.34 from the $60, and only then you made the deposit(s)</p>
<p>After the successful deposit(s), your game strategy changed significantly, and you lost all your funds by playing in the casino</p>
<p>We try to help players resolve their issues, but I can see that you basically lost all your disputed funds by playing in the casino. So, can you please explain to us what should be paid to you and why?</p>
<p>Each player is obliged to read the casino's Terms and Conditions, and you accepted at least upon registration. Since we are talking about a no-deposit bonus, which is free money given by the casino, we are able to accept that casinos can limit them as they see fit (until it is not against our Fair Gambling Codex and policy). In addition, it is industry standard that online casinos require a deposit before withdrawing the winnings from no-deposit bonuses. Otherwise, everyone could play there and only withdraw the winnings without a chance to lose or risk anything from their real money. If it was so easy, and if players could only win and withdraw winnings from no-deposit bonuses, it would not make sense for casinos to provide their services to players at all. If you wanted to withdraw $60, you should have deposited $40 immediately after meeting the wagering requirements and cleansing the bonus winnings from everything above the maximum cashout amount. This did not happen.</p>
<p>If the circumstances were different and you would have made a deposit immediately after your balance was decreased to $60 upon meeting the wagering requirements, it would have been another story. But you even lost all your funds after the successful deposit(s). To be honest, I cannot see anything we can help you with further.</p>
<p>Nothing was left on your balance, and nothing was confiscated by the casino, only the first time upon meeting the wagering requirement (everything over $60), which is absolutely alright. I see no issue here.</p>
<p>Was my explanation enough for you, and can I consider this issue closed, or is there anything else we could help you with?</p>
<p>And only a few last questions. I can see in your game logs that there were moments with significant winnings made consecutively, each time in several consecutive rows/games. Do I understand correctly that you left some unfinished rounds/features in the games while you played with bonus money, and then, when you thought that it was a withdrawable/real balance of $60, you finished these rounds and collected winnings from them?</p>
<p>If that is correct - are you please aware that it is a prohibited tactic which means another rule was breached?</p>
