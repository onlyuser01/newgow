<p>Spain’s Directorate General of Gaming (DGOJ) has published a report on the industry’s performance in the first quarter of the year. While gross gaming revenue experienced a slight quarter-on-quarter decline, the figures represent an impressive year-on-year increase.</p>
<p>As reported, GGR experienced a slight drop from Q4 2022, declining by 2.8%. The higher Q4 number, however, was attributed to the boost that last year’s FIFA World Cup Qatar provided.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the $333 million in GGR the Spanish industry recorded in Q1 2023 represents a spectacular 51% year-on-year increase.</p>
<p>Sports betting continues to be one of the most popular gambling verticals in the country and was responsible for a whopping 42.8% of the Q1 GGR. The FIFA World Cup has a profound effect on wagering in Q4 2022, resulting in a 7.65% quarter-on-quarter decline in Q1 2023. In reality, the Q1 sports betting results represent a stellar year-on-year increase of 100.10%.</p>
<p>Casino revenues remained more stable since they were largely unaffected by the FIFA World Cup championship. The segment was singlehandedly responsible for 47.02% of the Q1 2023 GGR, making it the biggest contributor.</p>
<p>During the first quarter of the year, Spanish casino gaming recorded a GGR of $156.6 million, which represents a 0.64% quarter-on-quarter growth. The figure also translates to a respectable year-on-year increase of 29.19%. The growth was largely thanks to the rising popularity of live roulette and slot machines, which experienced growths of 32.19% and 31.29% respectively.</p>
<p>Spanish Gaming Remains Strong</p>
<p>Q1 was a very favorable period for Spanish gaming. The industry proved its capacity to grow in spite of Spain’s newly introduced advertising rules.</p>
<p>For reference, in 2022, Spain introduced a Royal Decree on Communications which restricted gambling advertisements, promotions and sponsorships. As a result, companies recorded fewer new customers, with the silver lining being that operators no longer need to spend huge sums on marketing.</p>
<p>However, the Q1 2023 figures show that the industry is more than capable to maintain its growth despite the new restrictions it has to deal with. This highlights Spain as a strong gambling market that is capable to navigate complex and restrictive regulatory frameworks.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Spain continues to work on a cross-operator deposit limit system that will improve player protection in the country. The DGOJ believes that such a system is vital for establishing a safer market where players are encouraged to spend responsibly.</p>
