    <h1>Blackjack Casino Near Me Casinos In Atlanta Wekopa Resort Casino Four Winds Casino 10 Free Slot Play</h1>

<p>The refund is indeed adequate, I am not questioning that. But I still think there should have been a compensation from their end on top of it too for the trouble and lack of action from their part.</p>
<p>The problem is he came here and just wrote a bunch of LIES, he's saying I did not mention live chat of my problem which is a HUGE lies and thats why he don't want me to have those live chat conversation.</p>
<p>He's also aware that you CANNOT self exclude yourself via the responsible gambling tab of the website, but he's been telling everyone that they could/should of self excluded there...another super wrong action from their part.</p>
<p>So far I Never re-opened a account I had closed previously so yes this would have changed everything in my case.</p>
<p>I was basicaly healed from my addiction to be honest, i did not play since new year, every account i had was closed, the only account i still had open ( because they did not close it ) was on vulkan vegas... the seconds the account unlocked after my 6 week exclusion they bombarded me of bonus/offer emails...</p>
<p>There are a lot of complaint here and on askgamblers about them ignoring account closure for a reason, they know they are wrong, but they continue to do it anyway. then they come here saying hey you could of done this or that .... what about you could of closed the account when the player asked for it !!! like i said i closed maybe 50 account and i never had to mention a gambling addition NEVER.</p>
<p>Well, thanks to Casinoguru team for helping me get in touch with them after almost a year without any response from their end.</p>
<p>You can close this complaint now, thanks again to Matej and Petronela this is really appreciated.</p>
