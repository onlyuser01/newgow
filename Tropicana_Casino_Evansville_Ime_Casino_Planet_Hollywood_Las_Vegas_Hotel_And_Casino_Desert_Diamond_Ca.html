<p>Surpassing $2 billion in wagers for a third month in a row, New York betting operators set a new record by posting $188.3 million revenue for December</p>
<p>Over the last few months, mobile sports betting operators in New York have reported exceptional results. The betting handle reported by the operators in October hit a $2 billion record, making the state the first one to surpass such a sum in wagers. Continuing this upward trend, November marked the second month in a row with a betting handle above $2 billion.</p>
<p>New York’s mobile sports betting market isn’t slowing down, considering the latest results released by the gambling regulator in the state, the New York State Gaming Commission. Wrapping up a successful year, betting operators posted $2.04 billion in betting handle for December 2023.</p>
<p>This result came close to the all-time record set in November when the betting handle hit $2.11 billion. While the betting handle didn’t surpass the result from November, a significant increase was observed in the mobile sports wagering gross gaming revenue (GGR). Last month, betting operators posted $188.3 million in GGR, a new record result that marked a $37.4 million increase when compared to the $150.9 million in GGR posted in November.</p>
<p>Year-over-year comparison of the results in December also shows significant growth. For December 2022, mobile betting operators posted $1.62 billion in betting handle. When compared to the $2.04 billion in betting handle posted last month, an increase of nearly 26% is observed. It’s not a surprise that the mobile sports betting GGR last month also marked a year-over-year increase by growing nearly 33% when compared to the same month in 2022.</p>
<p>FanDuel and DraftKings Maintain Their Leadership in New York</p>
<p>A breakdown of the $188.3 million in GGR shows that the operators’ share was $92.3 million, making another all-time high result. Similarly, New York’s net revenue to education also set an all-time high record hitting $96 million. This result marked a significant increase year-over-year when compared to the $72.3 million net revenue to education posted for December 2022.</p>
<p>It’s no surprise that market leaders FanDuel and DraftKings posted the highest betting handle and mobile betting GGR last month.</p>
<p>In December, FanDuel’s betting handle hit $834.5 million, the highest out of all operators for the month. Considering the betting handle, FanDuel posted $93.6 million in sports wagering GGR, a result which translates to $45.8 million in net revenue for the platform provider and $47.7 million in net revenue to education.</p>
<p>Following closely, DraftKings had the second-highest betting handle, posting $773.4 million last month. In December, the operator saw $31.9 million in net revenue, while the revenue toward the state’s education was $33.2 million.</p>
<p>Arriving third was Caesars Sportsbook, followed by BetMGM. Overall, the mobile betting handle reported by Caesars last month was nearly $202 million, resulting in a GGR of $15.9 million. On the other hand, BetMGM also enjoyed a strong month with its $126.5 million in wagers which brought $8.1 million in betting GGR.</p>
