<p>Good evening</p>
<p>I want to report the company bet365 for avoiding payment of profits of 1300 euros.</p>
<p>The problem lies in the identification of the card with which I made the deposit.</p>
<p>The betting bet365 asks for the following information to be found on a page:</p>
<p>beneficiary's full name</p>
<p>CARD NUMBER</p>
<p>RECENT DATE</p>
<p>AT LEAST ONE TRANSACTION APPEARS</p>
<p>The Piraeus bank to which the card belongs and I work with cannot provide this information in the e-statement on one page but on 2 pages.</p>
<p>I tried to send them on one page zooming in on the e-statement, but they don't accept it because it's not clearly visible.</p>
<p>They insist on having it on one page clearly and not on 2 pages. They want something that the particular bank cannot contain</p>
<p>. I sent them as much as I could my card in photos of both sides, and a print screen of the internet banking. Even a video of Internet banking so that they have the whole.</p>
<p>They don't accept anything and they don't pay my earnings. I have sent dozens of e-mails before addressing you, but unfortunately due to the bank's inability to provide exactly the form that the bookmaker wants, they reject the dozens of proofs that I have sent which certify beyond any doubt that I am the rightful owner of the card.</p>
<p>It is quite clear that using the specific form of identification as an excuse they avoid paying my profits.</p>
