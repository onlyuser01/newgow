    <h1>Casino Cast Casinos Nearby Online Casino Texas Minnesota Casinos Map Las Vegas Strip Casino Map BGO</h1>

<p>I have to supply some more statements for source of funds before they release the money but am unable to get the statements until after the 9th. Once they have come available which they haven’t yet I’ll get back to you if they still refuse to process the withdrawal with all of the information you request.</p>
<p>the casinos are all part of the BGO brand and operate as one so the complaint would be against BGO.</p>
<p>they basically put a source of funds check on my account once I hit a threshold and wasn’t going to withdraw me any winnings. I lost £2000 on BGO and they then initiated the check. Yet they allowed me to deposit 3 more times on 2 different sites and would have allowed more deposits before I raised it with them. At that time they froze the account immediately.</p>
<p>my withdrawals were just pending which was strange because the withdrawal process was normally immediate and then back in account relatively quickly too.</p>
<p>im upset that they allowed those deposits with no intention to pay me my winnings if I was to win which I did.</p>
<p>they should have put a block on deposits until I got back to them with source of funds.</p>
<p>the photos of the withdrawals pending I showed in the original email is what I’m expecting back of the two sites linked to BGO.</p>
<p>now even though they have self excluded me they still haven’t processed the withdrawal</p>
<p>they’ve had my wage slip, photo, bank statement, proof of address, self identity check. They just want rest of bank statements from my accounts now.</p>
<p>my argument is that they should really just pay me the withdrawal they owe me now that I can’t go back on the site anyway. But I’ll send the statements anyway. Then see what happens</p>
