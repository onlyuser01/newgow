<p>As part of the new deal, Greek players will have access to Relax Gaming’s extensive portfolio of top-performing slots, including Money Train 2, Temple Tumble 2, and the recently released hit, Book of Power.</p>
<p>This deal marks a significant milestone for Relax Gaming, which was recently awarded an iGaming Supplier License by the Hellenic Gaming Commission at the start of 2023. With this license, Relax Gaming can expand its operations in Greece and tap into the country’s growing online gambling market.</p>
<p>Commenting on the new partnership, Nadiya Attard, chief commercial officer at Relax Gaming, expressed her excitement, saying, “We are absolutely thrilled to have signed this deal with Novibet, as one of the top operators in the Greek market partnering with them puts us in a fantastic position to establish ourselves as a market-leading supplier.”</p>
<p>Foteini Matthaiou, casino product &amp; CRM director at Novibet, also shared her excitement about the partnership. She said: “All of us at Novibet are excited to see our Greek player base gain access to some of the most popular titles on the market. We are delighted to kick-start this successful partnership together, which also includes the exclusive offer of Money Train 2 on our platform.”</p>
<p>With this new deal, Relax Gaming is set to further solidify its position as a market leader and continue expanding its reach in the Greek online gambling market.</p>
<p>Relax Gaming Expands Its Reach with Launches, Licenses, and Partnerships</p>
<p>Relax Gaming has gained a reputation as one of the industry’s leading B2B suppliers, providing more than 4,000 online casino games, including high-performing proprietary slots and content from hand-picked third-party studios via its partnership programs.</p>
<p>The company was recently named the Best Mobile Gaming Software Provider at the EGR B2B Awards, Casino / Slot Developer of the Year at the SBC Awards, and was awarded GGA’s Product Launch of the Year for Dream Drop Jackpots in February.</p>
<p>The first months of 2023 were quite busy for Relax Gaming with new product launches, new licenses, and partnerships. The company announced the launch of its latest slot game Money Cart 3 in April but before that, it also released the slot game Book of Power and a sequel to its popular game Wild Chapo. In March, Relax Gaming stepped on the Swedish market and also struck partnerships with Bulgarian live casino production company Studio 21 and British gambling giant bet365.</p>
