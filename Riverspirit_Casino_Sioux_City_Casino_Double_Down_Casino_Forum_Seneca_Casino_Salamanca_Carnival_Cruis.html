As with most new slot games, Sweet Alchemy 2 provides options for an auto spin that include limits for balance increase, decrease and more customization options.</p>
<p>“The fans wanted more Sweet Alchemy, here it is.” George Olekszy, head of game retention at Play’n GO</p>
<p>George Olekszy, Play’n GO’s head of game retention, explained that the latest game comes after many fans showed support for a sequel to the famous Sweet Alchemy title. He pointed out that the first game was one of the company’s most popular games. “It only made sense for us to build on this IP and try something even sweeter with Sweet Alchemy 2,” said Olekszy.</p>
<p>The company’s head of game retention spoke about the engaging features the latest game offers, including multipliers and Bonus Game options. Finally, Olekszy acknowledged that Sweet Alchemy 2 offers and engaging gameplay that is supercharged thanks to the popular grid expansion mechanic.</p>
<p>The New Game Brings Engaging Features and Gameplay</p>
<p>The new sweet-themed game from Play’n GO features different symbols of sweets such as donuts, croissants and candy, among other tasty treats. The base game starts with a 5×5 grid but given the cluster pay mechanic, it can temporarily expand up to a 9×9 grid.</p>
<p>Within the initial game when only a 5×5 grid is available, Chocolate Blocker symbols cover the rest. Successful cluster pays can break the Chocolate Blockers covering the additional squares on the grid, allowing new symbols to drop in a cascading motion and potentially generate further winning clusters. Once a win is granted, the grid resumes the standard 5×5 layout for the next spin.</p>
<p>To engage in free spins, players need to clear all Chocolate Blocker symbols from the reel. “Four Free Spins and Mega Symbols can be fashioned in a player’s direction as they traverse the candy-coated wonderland. However, Mega Symbols are not always guaranteed,” explained Play’n GO.</p>
<p>If a player engages in free spins and clears the Chocolate Blocker symbols once again, they can benefit from four additional spins and also tap into bigger Mega Symbols, which further boosts the chance for big payouts.</p>
<p>Last but not least, to trigger the title’s Bonus Game, players need to collect random low and high-paying symbols during free spins. This bonus feature has three different levels, further boosting player engagement and experience.</p>
