<p>US casino giant Caesars Entertainment announced the appointment of Matt Sunderland as Senior Vice President of iGaming effective October 1, 2022.</p>
<p>Bringing an Established Industry Expert Onboard</p>
<p>The appointment of Sunderland as SVP of Caesars’ online casino gaming division brings more than 20 years of online gambling industry experience to the casino operator that is seeking to expand its presence in the online gaming space.</p>
<p>Speaking about the appointment, Caesars Digital president Eric Hession was thrilled to see Sunderland join the team at Caesars, underlying Sunderland’s “deep experience and successful track record” as the traits that will be a great asset for the business while efforts to grow in online casino and sports betting verticals continue.</p>
<p>“We’re looking forward to what we can accomplish together with Caesars Sportsbook and Casino,” concluded Hession.</p>
<p>Sunderland’s most recent role was at BetMGM where he served as Vice President of Gaming and was tasked with oversight of the brand’s iGaming launches in new jurisdictions, helping the team achieve triple-digit revenue growth under his leadership.</p>
<p>“As the industry continues to grow, I’m looking forward to identifying new potential for our iGaming business while continuing to bring top-notch service to our customers,” said Sunderland, recognizing the exciting times ahead in iGaming and pleased to have the opportunity to join the team at Caesars.</p>
<p>Before joining BetMGM, Sunderland served as an iGaming consultant for GVC and MGM Resorts while his professional career also includes several senior leadership roles at Probability, GTECH/IGT and CNN International.</p>
<p>Growing the Business in the Online Gaming Space</p>
<p>The appointment of Sunderland is part of the ongoing efforts of Caesars Entertainment to upgrade its sportsbook and online casino offerings following the launch of Caesars Sportsbook &amp; Casino in April 2021.</p>
<p>Operating land-based casinos in Michigan, New Jersey, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, and the Canadian province of Ontario, Caesars Entertainment has been seeking to establish a strong presence in the online sports betting and gaming space, introducing features like same-game parlays, faster payouts, cashout functionality, and others aimed to differentiate its product offering and ensure a best-in-class player experience.</p>
