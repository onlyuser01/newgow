    <h1>3Dice Casino Miami Ok Casino Ho Chunk Casino Madison Casino Live Online Toledo Hollywood Casino IBIA</h1>

<p>IBIA has been determined to expand its expertise across the globe and strengthen its presence in new and emerging markets, all in the pursuit of making sports betting safer and more secure for everyone involved. Now, IBIA has been putting a considerable effort to expand in North and South America, with the latest partner to join the association, KTO Group’s KTO, a sports betting brand.</p>
<p>One of the newest betting brands in the market, founded only in 2018, KTO is now going to be a trusted and reliable partner to IBIA’s ambitious growth strategy in Latin America in general. IBIA is determined to onboard more partners locally so that it can continue to monitor the emerging and fast-growing market.</p>
<p>Brazil is now in the process of finalizing its sports betting regime, which means that there will be even more wagering going down in the country, which is why the local expertise that KTO can add to IBIA is invaluable for the association. Commenting on the opportunity to be actually joining, KTO Managing Director Jeff Tabone:</p>
<p>"We are thrilled to become members of the IBIA. We view this as a step that reinforces our dedication to upholding the highest standards of integrity in Sports Betting."</p>
<p>Tabone further said that trust is one of the cornerstones of his company and that as a brand, KTO is committed to helping IBIA’s mission to make sports betting safer and more transparent. IBIA CEO Khalid Ali was similarly excited to see yet another strong partner join the association at a time when the entire region is in an upsurge and demand for sports betting products is growing. Ali added:</p>
<p>"KTO is the latest operator to make IBIA its preferred integrity partner for Brazil and its wider global operations. It further expands IBIA’s position in the LatAm region, and Brazil in particular, where our members are already estimated to account for over 60% of the remote gambling market."</p>
<p>IBIA has been doing a lot to establish its presence in the region. The association confirmed that it is launching a new base of operations in Brazil in particular, expecting the country to be the largest sports betting market in Latin America, and one of the biggest worldwide.</p>
<p>Apart from this, the association also added another Brazilian operator, galera.bet, as one of its latest partners to help it grow and strengthen its regional footprint. Neither Galera nor KTO will be the last local partners that IBIA is adding to its member list.</p>
