    <h1>Hard Rock Casino Hotel Henderson Casinos Borgata Casino Online Nj Online Casino Texas Bicycle Casino</h1>

<p>Acclaimed supplier and developer of cutting-edge casino products, Wazdan, has expanded its reach and clout in the United States and North America, with the company entering a new partnership with Hard Rock Bet in New Jersey.</p>
<p>This reflects on the company’s ongoing mission to continually position itself in important high-value markets, and the Garden State is one of the leading jurisdictions when it comes to online gambling in the United States, and North America as a whole.</p>
<p>Hard Rock Bet also stands to benefit, as it will gain access to Sizzling Eggs, Magic Stars 3, and Burning Sun, along with other games, which together build a robust library of games. Besides, Wazdan is already available in the state through partnerships with BetMGM and Tipico making Hard Rock Bet all the keener to also explore this content opportunity.</p>
<p>Hard Rock Bet has been steadfastly developing a dedicated library of games on its own, and the latest content injection is a significant step forward for the company in the market. Hard Rock Digital SVP of Casino Grant Williams has been welcoming of the opportunity as well, arguing that Wazdan’s popular games will only serve to strengthen the operator’s footprint locally.</p>
<p>"With hundreds of gaming options and engaging promotions like our $1 Million-in-prizes Winterfest, Hard Rock Bet is entertaining our players like no one else can," Williams boasted. Wazdan's Head of Account Management for NA and LatAm, Izabela Slodkowska-Popiel, was similarly pleased to see this partnership form and Wazdan’s games launch with Hard Rock, a respected player in the local iGaming market.</p>
<p>The delivery of content is carried out through Light &amp; Wonder’s platform, which facilitates the process for all parties involved and allows for smooth gameplay on the part of players. "Our partnership with Light &amp; Wonder has driven us to new heights across North America, and we’re confident that this will be another exciting expansion for us," Slodkowska-Popiel concluded.</p>
<p>Wazdan has been on a tear recently. The company introduced a new game, Hot Slot: 777 Stars Extremely Light, and it also strengthened its presence in New Jersey with PlayStar, and the supplier is committed to both the Garden State as one of the core iGaming markets in the United States, and the entire country as a whole.</p>
