<p>Avoid Using Crypto Loko</p>
<p>This is the worst experience I’ve ever had with an online casino.</p>
<p>They are the run of the mill casinos who will bombard you with promotions to coax you into signing up. I’ve had my fair share of casinos who’ve done this which isn’t necessarily a problem, but unlike other casinos I’ve dealt with — they will not honor their promotion.</p>
<p>They sent me a promotion with the promo code LOKO30 to use. It was $30 in free chips, and the promotion made it clear that I could cash out for real money with a maximum of $50.00.</p>
<p>After winning upwards of $409.10, I wanted to cash out which would’ve been $62.00. The cash out amount included a $12.00 deposit (which I also played through once) plus the $50.00 from the promotion.</p>
<p>But after putting in my request, they sent me back $12.00 and cleared the rest of the money from my account. I tried initially requesting $62.00, but it kept getting rejected. So I tried to cash out all of it, figuring they would see on their end that I would be owed $62.00, but they wiped the $397.10 from my account and only gave me my initial deposit back.</p>
<p>The worst is they refuse to answer any emails. They deserve the reputation they have online and I hope this review helps people to avoid them like the plague.</p>
