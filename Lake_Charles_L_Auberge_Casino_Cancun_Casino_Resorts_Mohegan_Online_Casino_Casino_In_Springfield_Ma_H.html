<p>The only way to tackle corruption in sports is by making sure that everyone is committed to the end goal. This is why the International Betting Integrity Association (IBIA) has revealed that it is launching its operations in the United States and Canada, welcomed by some of the biggest local operators.</p>
<p>IBIA Expands Its Monitoring Service to Include NA</p>
<p>DraftKings and FanDuel have both welcomed the launch, arguing that IBIA would be an important ally in tackling match-fixing and corruption in sports. IBIA already has licenses in Arizona, Colorado, Indiana, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Wyoming, and more are pending, allowing the trade body to hit the ground running.</p>
<p>Moreover, IBIA is confident that it has work to do as the gambling market in the United States for sports is expected to generate a total of $96 billion betting handle in 2022 alone. Another $7 billion is expected to be wagered on the Super Bowl as per the American Gaming Association. Commenting on this launch, IBIA CEO Khalid Ali said:</p>
<p>“IBIA is delighted to announce that we are touching down in the North American market. With the largest customer transaction-based betting integrity monitoring system in the world, we will play a crucial role in protecting and supporting the growth of the betting industry in the US and Canada.” IBIA CEO Khalid Ali</p>
<p>Ali is confident that IBIA is in a unique position to provide the best protection to sportsbooks and sports. There have been multiple calls to extend IBIA’s protection coverage to North America for a while, Ali admitted, and the organization was delighted to be finally able to do so.</p>
<p>Confidence in the Arrival of IBIA</p>
<p>As to what IBIA brings to the table, it matters. The monitoring and alert platform have been an efficient tool in analyzing betting fraud. While IBIA has had to play catch-up for most of the past years, its tools and products have advanced to the point where its real-time monitoring proves an efficient way of clamping down on fraud.</p>
<p>IBIA advertises collective action, meaning that it’s not the sole custodian of sports contests, but rather expects a concerted effort by trade bodies, regulators, national sports bodies, and others. FanDuel Group director of risk and trading John Sheeran said that Flutter Entertainment has long been committed to the global mission set by IBIA.</p>
<p>The present expansion is only another opportunity to improve the collaboration between Flutter and IBIA and ensure the safety of sports betting products. The integrity monitoring service by IBIA would make customers even more confident in FanDuel’s offer, Sheeran noted.</p>
<p>DraftKings VP and head of regulatory affairs Roy Pollitt welcomed the entry on a similar note. He argued that the company has been impressed with the progress made by IBIA in ensuring that sports and betting remain clean of fraud and that IBIA’s arrival in North America was a step towards ensuring that remained the case.</p>
<p>“Protecting the integrity of sport while creating an engaging product for sports fans is at the heart of everything we do.” DraftKings VP and head of regulatory affairs Roy Pollitt</p>
<p>Thanks to these two endorsements, IBIA is already capable of monitoring 60% of the regulated US online market. IBIA will continue to improve its offer and seek new partners to join its ranks in ensuring the safest betting operations possible.</p>
