    <h1>Route 66 Casino The Plaza Hotel And Casino Restaurants In Ocean Casino Hallmark Casino Las Vegas Hot</h1>

<p>So I'm very frustrated and upset with this Casino, as i REALLY ENJOYED it until i i tried to get this cashout, now I'm just upset i even have to "complain, or report" them, i mean ive never had any problems with them (besides there absolutely horrible live chat employee's, who treat you like garbage for even contacting them) i actually stopped playing at all casinos except for this one and the ones that are owned by them as well (jackpot wheel, lucky creek, etc) but the weirdest part is I've never had any problems with them before, they just do not want to pay me my $3,580 (it was 3,680 but after 2 failed wire transfers and 2 checks were charged and wasted time it's now 3,580 I guess I paid for being a customer here)</p>
<p>so my $3580, was one April 19 2021 and I cashed it out instantly within that 24 hours, its strange to me because IDK why there not paying me, as they attempted to pay me, first we tried 2 bank wires (the first one came back cause PayPal doesn't accept foreign transactions, 2nd one miscommunication ) then I paid $30 ( all these charges were out of my winning's but they are trying to play dumb about that to so i won't be seeing that $100) so all that time wasted and still no pay (about 56 days)</p>
<p>after I have the 2 checks no bank will accept them, and then I call big dollar and they tell me, I must've had a canadian bank?? which idk why they wouldnt tell me this in the begining, so NATALIE decides to take this into her own hands as it's taken so long and im getting frusturated, alsio the fact I took theere word for it I pawned my dead wifes wedding ring thinking I was getting paid on a certain day just to find out there giving me the runaround and it's to late for me to get that ring back and im mad at myself for even trusting in someone who doesnt care, I thought she did but no, she then tells me to rip up theese checks and write void on them and she will make sure im paid by this following monday, so I did that monday comes still nothing and here we are 6/17/21 stikll waiting for fior my 3,580, as they say, were waiting for the processor to return it back to my account aso we can start all over, I asked how long is the procesor going to take? "idk" at this point i wouild have just opened a new acct with the checks now i have nothing and waiting in limbo, i have proof of them teklling me its all fine even to conversations &amp;me winning the physical ammount, i would reccomend this casino, if you like to get lied to after what you think is building trust with eachother there going to stab you in the back and think your dumb, it sucks cause i really enjoyed this place and they payed everything out which is weird that they wont paty me my $3,580mit sucks its even had to come down to this, but i need what is rightfully mine, without them playing games i do not have anytime for this shit, i wish i would have read the reviews on this casino ,, but THEY NEED TO PAY ME MY $3,580 NO MORE EXCUSESS IVE BEEN WAITING ALMOST 97 DAYS THIS IS INSANE , THEY WILLL TELL YOU WHAT YOU WANT TO HEAR &amp; LET YOU DOWN HARD CORE, NATALIE ACTUALLY MESSED THIS THING UP WORSE SO I WOULDNT TRUST HER WITH ANYTHING,</p>
<p>$3850 PLZ SEND IT TO MY BTC WALLET THIS IS OLD.</p>
