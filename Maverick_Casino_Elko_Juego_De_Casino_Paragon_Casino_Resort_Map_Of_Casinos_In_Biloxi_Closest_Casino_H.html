<p>Rees said that he is thrilled to join the company at what he called a “pivotal point” for the Hard Rock brand</p>
<p>Hard Rock International has begun work on its joint project with the Tejon Indian Tribe in California. The groundbreaking ceremony for the Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino Tejon featured a commemorative shovel groundbreaking and was attended by representatives of both Hard Rock and the Tejon Indian Tribe.</p>
<p>Described as an exciting day for the state, the ceremony is also a symbolic development for the tribe, which has been landless for more than 150 years. The new casino is a major victory for the Tejon, which, according to its chairman, Octavio Escobedo, is finally close to the “dream of self-determination through economic development.”</p>
<p>The casino hotel will create 2,000 construction-specific jobs and will be managed by the Penta Building Group. After its completion, the property is expected to create roughly 5,000 jobs, both full-time and part-time.</p>
<p>The Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino Tejon will also boast 150,000 square feet of gaming space. The casino is set to have 2,500 slot machines, 48 gaming tables and video poker. The property will also sport a multitude of dining options, a pool, a spa, a theater and 400 hotel rooms.</p>
<p>The casino hotel is expected to be completed within 22 months.</p>
