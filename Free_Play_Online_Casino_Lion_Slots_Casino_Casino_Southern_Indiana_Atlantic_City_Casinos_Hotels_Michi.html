<p>Hi Petronela</p>
<p>The sequence of events was this.</p>
<p>I opened the account and deposited 40 euros.</p>
<p>There was no facility to either accept or reject the bonus applied.</p>
<p>I didn't want any bonus applied as I know they come with excessive wagering requirements.</p>
<p>I spun maybe 1 or 2 low value spins and glanef at the balance and could see it was inflated so stopped and checked my spam e mails.</p>
<p>There was an e mail advising of introductory bonus.</p>
<p>I opened the 'chat' feature on the casino site and asked for the bonus to be removed. The chat operator said they couldn't as I had already spun a few reels.</p>
<p>I then asked the chat operator to close my account and they said they couldn't anf I had to e mail their support e mail.</p>
<p>I quickly just spun through the 40 euros to get rid of it as I knew I wouldn't be able to withdraw anything anf came offline.</p>
<p>I then e mailed the support asking that my account be closed.</p>
<p>The account remained open so the following day I e mailed again asking that t the account be closed.</p>
<p>Later this was responded to by an e mail from them saying they will do (future tense) but wanted to know why and alerting me to a 10 euro free bonus they had placed on my account.</p>
<p>I played that through and immediately thereafter in a couple of hours after rdeposited a further set of deposits totalling Â£700 plus GBP simply chasing my losses.</p>
<p>I only chose club lounge as they are not on gamstop and I have excluded on gamstop around 2 years ago for 5 years as knew I had a problem.</p>
<p>Next e mails from them were advising me I was now a Vip member and placing 30 euros in the account which I simply used in 30 seconds to get rid of it in anger and began again to ask for my deposits back which I would not have been able to deposit if my 2 earlier e mail instructions had been acted on when asked.</p>
<p>They have since agreed to close my account and suggest that I make a complaint to get the deposits after closure requests back.</p>
<p>I did that today and informed to wait 5 days for their response.</p>
<p>I didn't take a screenshot of my chat with them and no longer have access to the account.</p>
<p>I have kept my e mail s to them.</p>
<p>I don't hold any hope of getting the deposit s back as there is an argument that when the account wasn't closed upon request nobody twisted my arm to make me deposit.</p>
<p>The fact is I knew I would just keep depositing until the account was closed as I am compulsive which is why after 40 euros I asked twice to close it.</p>
<p>I therefore am not sure you can assist as seems to be sharp practice rather than dishonesty and I doubt they will have any moral difficulties in retaining deposits in this manner from a recovering addict.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Gary</p>
