    <h1>Grand Casino Hinkley Nugget Casino Wendover Mohegan Casino Las Vegas Casino Free Spin Prairie Wind C</h1>

<p>I have been playing at burningbet.com for about 4 weeks and had successfully verified my account. After getting a small profit paid out within 24 hours without any problems, I made higher deposits. My current profit of around 4000 euros should now be paid out. I made a withdrawal request for 400 euros every day and now the maximum 3 withdrawals are open.</p>
<p>After a few days without notification, I asked Live Support about the status of my payout, and they told me to contact the finance department directly at kyc@burningbet.com. I thought maybe there is still no proof because the payouts are higher, but then I received an email with the following reference:</p>
<p>Your game session has been sent to the game provider for review. As soon as we have received a response from your game provider regarding your gaming session and your bets, we will notify you immediately by email. mail and then your withdrawal request will be checked.</p>
<p>The review of your withdrawal request has been delayed until the game provider has officially responded.</p>
<p>An additional check will be carried out in accordance with Section 2.4.1 of the project rules: Finance may delay processing the payment request due to an additional check.</p>
<p>The verification time is 3-7 days.</p>
<p>I suspect that the payout should be delayed and also read in some forums that similar cases have occurred at other casinos of the operator, e.g. DozenSpins, in which the players are then delayed for several weeks.</p>
<p>Addition: I had a larger single win at a game by Pragmatic, so nothing unusual and from my point of view no reason for such an alleged test.</p>
