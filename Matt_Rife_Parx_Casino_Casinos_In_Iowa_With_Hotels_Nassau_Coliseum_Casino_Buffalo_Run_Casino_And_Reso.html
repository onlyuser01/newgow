<p>Playtech is doubling down on its efforts to onboard customers quicker and in a more sustainable manner. The company has teamed up with Checkin.com, an onboarding software supplier that will help facilitate the customer sign-up process, the company said in a press release.</p>
<p>Playtech Adopts New Customer Onboarding Technology</p>
<p>Checkin.com makes the process straightforward and pain-free for companies who are utilizing its powerful and secure user identification solution. The company specifically leverages AI and machine learning to make sure that customers are able to join gaming platforms in a seamless and intuitive manner, without having to jump through too many hoops.</p>
<p>Checkin.com also makes it possible to quickly phase out older user registration technology and replace it with the AI-driven solution provided by the company instead. The company already provides its solutions for more than 165 countries and ensures that the registration process is compliant with local regulatory prerequisites.</p>
<p>The software is capable of quickly scanning and analyzing consumer documents, such as passports, proof of address, biometry, ID documents, and more. Commenting on this partnership, Playtech SaaS commercial partnerships manager Mark Jones said:</p>
<p>Our SaaS program enables our operator partners to access the best, most innovative solutions to complement our wider range of services. We are very impressed with the technology behind Checkin.com and believe it is a highly relevant, effective solution for operators looking to deliver a smooth and secure onboarding process. Playtech SaaS commercial partnerships manager Mark Jones</p>
<p>Checkin.com Group deputy CEO Andreas Thim was similarly excited and welcomed the partnership on a similarly positive note. Thim said that his company’s offer has been instrumental in creating a strong onboarding process across numerous iGaming verticals.</p>
<p>“Playtech’s outstanding technological capabilities and well-deserved reputation for being the leading platform in the industry makes this partnership a great fit,” Thim concluded.</p>
