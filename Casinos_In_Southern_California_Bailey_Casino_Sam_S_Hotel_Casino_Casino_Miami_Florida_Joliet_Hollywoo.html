<p>4ThePlayer.com, an innovative iGaming developer, has released a new market communication in which the company detailed that it has received a transactional waiver to go live in New Jersey. The permit, which comes from the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement, will enable the company to roll out its products on some of the top-tier operators in the state.</p>
<p>4ThePlayers Set to Launch in NJ and the Other States</p>
<p>New Jersey is the first of many states to follow, the company assures, as it seeks to pivot towards the US market. 4ThePlayer has outlined several of the upcoming products that it will be releasing in the Garden State.</p>
<p>They include 9k Yeti, 6 Wild Sharks, and not least, 3 Secret Cities, which will all be arriving in the next several months. 4ThePlayer is confident that these games are all developed in a way that allows them to stand out from other similar propositions on the market and have been developed with a unique set of features.</p>
<p>One of those is Big Reel Portrait Mode which enables 4ThePlayer to enable portrait mobile play and create a more immersive experience driven by technological innovation. Commenting on this development, 4ThePlayer business development director Chris Ash said:</p>
<p>We are delighted to be granted our transactional waiver and to be live in the USA – this is a milestone for 4ThePlayer and our first step into the exciting US market. 4ThePlayer business development director Chris Ash</p>
<p>Ash confirmed that the team was excited to present these games in the US market and share them not only in New Jersey but in other states as well. 4ThePlayer has already been able to develop a number of iGaming products across the slot and table games vertical. 4ThePlayer’s games are already integrated with Gaming Realms, Relax Gaming, and Yggdrasil.</p>
