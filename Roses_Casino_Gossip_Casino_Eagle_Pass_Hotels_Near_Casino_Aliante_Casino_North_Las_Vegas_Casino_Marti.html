<p>Grammy-winning rockers Aerosmith are back in the saddle again for a Vegas residency that begins at Dolby Live at Park MGM on June 17, 2022. The stand is for three multiple-night runs, set to conclude on Dec. 11, 2022.</p>

<p>The Aerosmith: Deuces Are Wild show will see the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductees perform a total of 24 shows in June, July, September, October, November, and December. Tickets went on sale on March 31.</p>
<p>Deuces Are Wild, which takes its title from a 1994 Aerosmith song, first opened at Park MGM in 2019. It has become a part of the celebrations for the 50th anniversary of the band’s debut album in 2023.</p>
<p>The shows will feature a 90-minute live performance accompanied by unreleased audio and never-before-seen visuals from Aerosmith’s archives. The multimedia will display via a 12-screen media presentation produced by Oscar and Emmy-winning global visual effects studio Pixomondo.</p>
<p>New Tech, New Experience</p>
<p>The Aerosmith performances will be the first live concert experience presented in Dolby Atmos® at Dolby Live,” according to a news release.</p>
<p>“The sound is just so good in the [Park Theater]; it’s a whole ‘nother level, tone-wise,” Guitarist Joe Perry said. Perry also plays in the Hollywood Vampires supergroup with Johnny Depp and Alice Cooper, and reworked his guitar setup for the residency.</p>
<p>The only rust at Dolby Live is going to be on our van in the lobby! We are locked, cocked, and loaded!” Steven Tyler said in a statement.</p>
<p>The special VIP ticket package for Aerosmith allows fans to be seated at the onstage bar during the band’s performance. Regular tickets for the shows start at $75.</p>
<p>In announcing the Park MGM residency, Aerosmith adds its name to a long list of lineups who secured residencies as Covid-19 numbers waned in America, including Katy Perry, Silk Sonic, and Cheap Trick.</p>
<p>Aerosmith Back at It</p>
<p>In April, Aerosmith plans to release their next album, 1971: The Road Starts Hear. The album is an LP of demo recordings.</p>
<p>Aerosmith also recently sold its recorded music catalog to Universal Music Group (UMG). The deal goes into effect this year and includes future music releases, merchandise, and audio-visual content.</p>
<p>In the midst of the Aerosmith: Deuces Are Wild residency, the band will play its rescheduled 50th Anniversary Fenway show on Sept. 8, 2022.</p>
