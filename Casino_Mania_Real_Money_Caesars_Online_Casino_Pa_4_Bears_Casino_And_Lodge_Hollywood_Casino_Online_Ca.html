<p>Matchbook Betting Exchange announced this week it has hired the services of horse racing trainer Olly Murphy in a Brand Ambassador capacity.</p>
<p>Work to Get Horses into Races</p>
<p>The collaboration between Matchbook Betting Exchange and Olly Murphy will see the Stratford-upon-Avon-based horse racing trainer produce regular video and written content for the betting brand.</p>
<p>Commenting on his new collaboration with Matchbook, Murphy outlined the excitement to have the opportunity to “produce some innovative behind-the-scenes content” and be able to showcase the huge amount of work that “goes into getting a horse to the races,” including what working at Warren Chase Stables mean, an idea he has been keen on for some time.</p>
<p>As part of the collaboration, Murphy will be producing a behind-the-scenes style video titled ‘The Other Side of the Fence’ to showcase the effort it takes to prepare a horse for any particular race to fans of horse racing and players at Matchbook.</p>
<p>Murphy, who is coming on the back of his most successful season, ramping up over £1.1 million ($1.32 million) in prize money from 92 winners with a 17% strike rate, paid tribute to Matchbook’s support for British horse racing.</p>
<p>“Matchbook have always been exceptionally supportive of British Horse Racing, and I’m proud to be associated with this up-and-coming brand.” Olly Murphy, Brand Ambassador, Matchbook Betting Exchange</p>
<p>Hailed as the Next Generation Horse Trainer</p>
<p>Matchbook’s chief marketing officer Eric Hegarty also commented on the partnership, expressing his high regard for Murphy as “the next generation” trainer and one “earmarked for future success by some of the shrewdest pundits in the game.”</p>
<p>Hegarty continued by noting that working on the behind-the-scenes video series has been going on in the last few weeks as Matchbook aims to provide fans of racing with an all-encompassing idea of the industry.</p>
<p>“We aim to give racing punters an all-access view of what it takes to be a Racing trainer encapsulating a season-long journey from Olly and his team’s perspective.” Eric Hegarty, CMO, Matchbook Betting Exchange</p>
<p>Licensed by both the Alderney Gambling Control Commission and the Gambling Commission, Matchbook operates as a betting exchange model, using peer-to-peer technology to connect bettors and offer them deep liquidity and low commissions.</p>
<p>Among Murphy’s latest big winners was Copperless who won the Pertemps Network Swinton Handicap Hurdle Grade 3 event on May 8 2021 to win £56,950 ($68,150).</p>
