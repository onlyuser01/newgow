<p>Viola Doing Great in the Offense</p>
<p>Fiorentina has scored at least a goal in each of the last four games in all competitions. Further, these guys have scored at least one goal in each of the last four duels with Inter Milan.</p>
<p>This team’s top scorer is Arthur Cabral with 16 goals in 45 games this season in all competitions. Just behind him are Luka Jovic and Nicolas Gonzales. The latter is the man who put away two goals against Basel in the semifinal of the Europa Conference League last Thursday.</p>
<p>Defensively, however, Fiorentina’s players haven’t been too impressive lately. They conceded five goals in their last five games, but the fact is that this team does have a pretty decent defensive line. The evidence of this is that in Serie A, they’ve conceded 41 goals so far, which makes them the 6th-best team in terms of defense.</p>
<p>Inter Milan Going for Two Trophies This Season</p>
<p>Simone Inzaghi’s boys have made it to the Final of the 2022-23 Champions League. That game is currently No. 1 on their agenda, but you can be 100% certain that the Nerazzurri would love to win the Coppa Italia as well.</p>
<p>The good news is that they definitely have the manpower to pull it off. Their roster is way better than the one of Fiorentina, there’s no arguing about that. Still, the Coppa Italia Final is a single game, in which anything can happen.</p>
<p>Luckily for Inter Milan, there are several veterans on this roster who have plenty of experience with big games like the one on Wednesday – Edin Dzeko, Hakan Calkanoglu, Marcelo Brozovic, and so on.</p>
<p>Fiorentina vs Inter Milan Prediction</p>
<p>This is going to be a very close game as both teams will give their utmost on Wednesday. Still, we do think Inter Milan has better players than Fiorentina, which is what will be the decisive factor in the Coppa Italia Final.</p>
<p>Pick: Inter Milan to win &amp; over 2.5 goals</p>
