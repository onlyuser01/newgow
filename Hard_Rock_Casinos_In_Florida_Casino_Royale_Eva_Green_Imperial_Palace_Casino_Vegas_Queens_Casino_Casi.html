    <h1>Hard Rock Casinos In Florida Casino Royale Eva Green Imperial Palace Casino Vegas Queens Casino Casi</h1>

<p>THESE SCAMMERS STOLE MY MONEY. I registered in platincasino and successfully passed the verification (provided my passport and utility bill) Then I lost a considerable amount of money in them, and then I won. Next I asked for a withdrawal. But I did not receive money, but I receive a request for a statement from my wallet, which is normal. I sent them the bank statement and they rejected it. When I asked why they rejected it, they kicked me out of the support chat. Next, I got a letter asking for a selfie with my passport in hand, and I gave that to them, but they rejected that too. By the way, my documents in the account that were previously approved were already marked as rejected. I tried 10 times to contact and communicate with them to find the problem, why they either accept or reject my documents, when I applied again, they told me to provide a screenshot that my documents were rejected and I can see it in my account. I went back to my account to do it but they had already changed everything, again! So people just do what they want, not following any civilized rules in such companies. Anyway, I waited for them to finish reviewing my selfie with a document in my hands for several days, and when I went to see how things were going today, I saw that all my money, 371.21 euros, had disappeared from my account. And my selfie status was rejected again. When I wrote in the chat, they told me that they were not satisfied with the quality of my photo (in which everything is clearly visible and not blurred, absolutely all data is readable.) I can send proofs and attach my photos for you if you are interested, so that you can see for yourself because the photo quality is impeccable. What can be the quality of the photo taken by iPhone 12 pro max? I demand that all my funds be returned to me immediately, and I also ask that you lower the rating of this casino. They communicate very rudely with players, often close the support chat, and then they have to wait again for 1 hour until someone connects. I consider this casino the worst I have ever seen. They do what they want and rob the players without even explaining to them why it happened. To my question, where are my funds, I was answered, quoting: I have no information to help you! Check your rating for them because it's fake. My pfoto is attached for you.</p>
