<p>Itâ€™s time for the last game of the 2023 Eastern Conference Finals between the Miami Heat and Boston Celtics. The series is tied 3-3, so whoever wins tonight will win the conference title</p>
<p>Boston was 3-0 down at the start of the series, but the Celtics managed to make it 3-3. As a result, their confidence is sky-high ahead of Game 7, which is why itâ€™s no surprise oddsmakers see them as -312 favorites. But maybe the Miami Heat can upset the odds?</p>

<p>Miami Heat Players Need to Pull Themselves Together</p>
<p>The Miami Heat went 3-0 in the first three games of the Eastern Conference Finals. Unfortunately for them, the Boston Celtics won the following three games. In the previous game, Boston won by just one point, thanks to Derrick Whiteâ€™s buzzer-beater.</p>

<p>The loss in the final moment of Game 6 certainly left a bad effect on Miami. The worst thing is that in Game 7, theyâ€™re going to have an even tougher job as the series is moving to TD Garden. Still, the Heat did beat the Celtics in the first two games played in Boston. Can they do it once again?</p>
<p>Boston Celtics Doing Great Defensively</p>
<p>The main reason why the Boston Celtics won the last three games is that they improved their defensive game. In the last game, they conceded just 103 points, while in the two games before, they allowed under 100 each time.</p>
<p>The Celtics played great as a collective, with Jayson Tatum being their standout player. The 25-year-old forward recorded a double-double in each of his last five games. In Game 6, he scored 31 points, as well as recorded 12 rebounds and five assists.</p>
<p>Miami Heat vs Boston Celtics Game 7 Prediction</p>
<p>The Boston Celtics have the momentum after winning the last three games. We think itâ€™s very likely theyâ€™re going to win again. This time, itâ€™s possible theyâ€™re going to win by a much higher margin than in the last three games.</p>
<p>Picks: Boston Celtics to win and cover the spread; over to hit</p>
