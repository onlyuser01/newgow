    <h1>Casino At Niagara Falls Casino Erie Pa Frost Casino High Rollers Casino Rt 66 Casino Hotel Detroit C</h1>

<p>The three Detroit casinos reported monthly aggregate revenue of $106.14 million for the month of August 2022. The results were driven by slots and table games in the casinos with the total revenue from these two segments reaching $104.48 million while sports betting bringing in another $1.66 million in revenue for the surveyed period.</p>
<p>Once again, MGM managed to pull ahead, accounting for 48% of the total revenue, followed by MotorCity with 31% and Hollywood Casino at Greektown bringing up the rear with 21%.</p>
<p>Gaming Takes a Hit, Sports Betting Makes Recovery</p>
<p>Slots and table games revenue was down 6.9% during the month of August on annual basis. Revenue was also generally down from this year’s July results. Nevertheless, the year-to-date results through August 31 for the table games and slots gaming revenue were actually up 1.7% from the same eight-month period in 2021.</p>
<p>Looking at specific year-over-year results, though, all three casinos posted weaker results when compared to August 2021. MGM’s results were down 3.7% to $50.31 million, MotorCity was down 11.5% to $32.33 million and Hollywood Casino at Greektown was down 6.7% to $21.84 million.</p>
<p>This resulted in $8.5 million paid in gaming taxes to the state, down from the $9.1 million paid in August 2021. Even though sports wagering was still down, it was 32.2% better when compared to July’s results. Based on qualified adjusted gross receipts, the three casinos collected $701,876 for MGM, $382,147 for MotorCity, and $578,830 for Hollywood Casino at Greektown.</p>
<p>Total receipts from sports betting amounted to $11,003,753, the casinos said. Retail sports betting gaming taxes paid to the State of Michigan were $62,856, higher than in August 2021, the official report by the state said. Year to date, the three casinos have generated $3 million from sports betting for MGM, $2.8 million for MotorCity, and $4.9 million for Hollywood Casino at Greektown.</p>
<p>“The Michigan Gaming Control Board shall ensure the conduct of fair and honest gaming to protect the interests of the citizens of the State of Michigan,” the state said in a publication outlining the most recent results.</p>
