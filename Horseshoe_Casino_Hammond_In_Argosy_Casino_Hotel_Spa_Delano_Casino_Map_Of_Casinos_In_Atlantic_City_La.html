<p>The company revealed that it has become NOGA's latest member, allowing it to continue to grow and expand within the Dutch regulated gambling market</p>
<p>The leading supplier of compliance services and solutions powering the gambling vertical, ComplianceOne Group, announced that it has become the latest member of the Netherlands Online Gambling Association (NOGA). This marks an important achievement for the company as it enables it to continue growing its presence in the jurisdiction and reaffirms its commitment as a supplier of compliance solutions for the market in the country.</p>
<p>Currently, NOGA represents leading gambling companies that operate in the Netherlands and helps protect their interest. The Association already has a strong presence, given that globally-recognized companies such as Kindred Group, bet365, Flutter and Entain have already joined it. In addition to representing the interests of gambling companies, NOGA collaborates with stakeholders and suppliers to ensure a healthy, safe and attractive Dutch gambling market.</p>
<p>Peter-Paul de Goeij, NOGA’s managing director, spoke about the Association’s ongoing commitment to creating a Dutch online gambling market that is safe and sustainable. He explained that such a market requires the services of experienced compliance operators such as ComplianceOne Group. Goeij welcomed the company to NOGA and predicted that the extensive expertise it brings will boost the operations of NOGA members.</p>
<p>“Building a thriving, safe and sustainable Dutch online gambling market requires world-class compliance know-how, so I’m thrilled to welcome ComplianceOne Group to NOGA.“ Peter-Paul de Goeij, managing director at NOGA</p>
<p>The Membership Marks a Milestone Moment for the Company</p>
<p>The announcement comes on the heels of the opening of ComplianceOne’s dedicated Dutch office. The new location opened back in January 2022 which helped further propel the company’s presence in the regulated gambling market, allowing it to join forces with providers and operators that are seeking to expand in the Netherlands. As a result, ComplianceOne’s regulatory and operational compliance company, Diligence in Gaming, forged an important wide-range deal with the operator Smart Gaming.</p>
<p>“Joining the Netherlands Online Gambling Association is an important milestone for ComplianceOne Group as we look to further support our partners in the Netherlands.“ Mike de Graaff, head of regulatory services and assurance at Diligence in Gaming</p>
<p>Mike de Graaff, Diligence in Gaming’s head of regulatory services and assurance, explained that ComplianceOne’s membership with NOGA marks an important milestone for the company. At the same time, he spoke about the opportunities for the company to support its Dutch partners. Finally, Graaff explained that NOGA helps its members continue to grow and engage in new opportunities while the Dutch market continues to grow.</p>
