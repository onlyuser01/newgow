<p>Australia’s semi-elite basketball league. NBL1 has come to an agreement with Sportradar for a longstanding data and audio-visual partnership.</p>
<p>Sportradar to Cover All Competitions along with Victoria State Championship</p>
<p>An arrangement between Sportradar and the NBL1 has been struck for Sportradar to cover all national men’s and women’s Conferences in the NBL1 throughout the year and the State Championship held in Victoria. The deal includes the data and audio-visual rights to more than 1,500 games annually.</p>
<p>Sportradar is the number one provider of sports data and content to the betting industry, media companies, and sports federations. With the NBL1 deal, the company managed to secure the official rights to more than 1,500 Australian basketball games annually. It will supply them to distribution partners and other basketball organizations in its portfolio, like the National Basketball Association (NBA), who have worked with them for five years now.</p>
<p>David Edwards, Director of Sports Media and Partnerships, Oceania for Sportradar, expressed content for securing one of the most thrilling semi-professional leagues in the region. He explained the NBL1 is a springboard to the NBL, and as such, it is important for them to have a modern platform to display the talent and attract new fans.</p>
<p>Brad Joyner, NBL1 Chief Commercial Officer, asserted Sportradar’s approach is working well in today’s sporting environment as the league strongly relies on data and technology. This, alongside the provider’s experience in working with Australian sports and fans, was the reason behind selecting Sportradar as the NBL1’s official data partner.</p>
<p>Sportradar Reaps Success as It Renews Existing Alliances and Forms New Ones</p>
<p>This major step for Sportradar comes trailing the company’s expansion deal with the Major League Baseball (MLB) in February 2020. The agreement entails the launch of virtual baseball play. Prior to the agreement, Sportradar was the exclusive game statistics provider for the MLB for any territories outside the US where betting on sports is allowed.</p>
<p>The company monitors and analyzes sporting events and works with media companies, sportsbooks, and sports federations. They are the National Basketball League’s official integrity partner and their international media rights distributor and over the top technology provider as of recently.</p>
<p>Established in 2001, Sportradar spans 80 countries and is the official partner of UEFA, FIFA, NASCAR, NBA, NFL, NHL, and MLB. The company analyzes and provides data from 720,000 matches annually across 75 sports. In addition, the data analyzer offers integrity services in order to assist in safeguarding sports.</p>
