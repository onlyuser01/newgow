    <h1>Mohegan Sun Casino Wilkes Barre Ameristar Kc Casino Golden Dragon Casino Login Jackpot City Casino T</h1>

<p>Following the casino service industry enterprise license received by GiG yesterday, the company signed a two-year deal with Casumo subsidiary Mill of Magic to power the Pay N Play brand.</p>
<p>Casumo-Owned Pay and Play Casino Will Be Powered by GiG</p>
<p>The iGaming technology solutions giant GiG announced today a new partnership with the Casumo subsidiary Mill of Magic Ltd. Under the partnership, GiG will make its platform available to Mill of Magic, GiG Logic solution and data platform. GiG will power the new Pay N Play casino by Mill of Magic. The casino will be operating with a license from the Malta Gaming Authority (MGA). The duration of the current contract is set for a minimum of 2 years. The launch of the Pay N Play casino is expected in Q4, 2020. This means that GiG will start receiving revenue dividends from 2021 onwards.</p>
<p>Casumo CEO, Shelly Suter-Hadad expressed high hopes for the partnership. She said that the company is thrilled to expand its partnership with GiG aiming at the launch of the new Pay N Play casino. According to Suter-Hadad, the new partnership will diversify the company’s offering which will allow new ways for economic growth. In conclusion, she said that the two companies are working towards: “…bringing another distinctive brand and strong product to market later this year.“</p>
<p>GiG Keeps Focus on Growth</p>
<p>Here is what GiG CEO, Richard Brown said about the new partnership: “We are very pleased to continue our partnership with the Casumo group by signing them onto our platform for a new brand launch.” He continued by outlining that GiG have worked for several years with a sister brand – Dunder. Brown continued by saying that he is sure that the new partnership will bring success in the Pay N Play market. In conclusion, he said that GiG is pleased to be a part of the project.</p>
<p>GiG was founded back in 2012, but the company’s vision for the future hasn’t changed much. Aiming at opening the iGaming market and making it fair and fun for everyone is GiG’s main goal. Looking back a few years, in 2018, GiG entered the New Jersey market under a transactional waiver. Back then, the company provided the giant Hard Rock International (HRI) with its sportsbook and casino platform. This partnership was later strengthened in 2019. Back then HRI and GiG signed an agreement which allowed the sportsbook and casino platform by GiG to launch for HRI customers in Iowa.</p>
<p>Although GiG was operating under a transactional waiver in New Jersey, the company applied for a license back in 2018. As a result, yesterday, GiG’s subsidiary, iGaming Cloud received a 5-year casino service industry enterprise license (CSIE) in New Jersey. The license, granted by the Division of Gaming Enforcement (DGE) confirms that GiG is officially allowed to operate in the Garden State.</p>
