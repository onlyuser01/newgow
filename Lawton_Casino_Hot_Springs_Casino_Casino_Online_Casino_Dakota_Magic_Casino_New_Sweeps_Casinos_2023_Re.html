<p>Brendan Tinnelly is Sportradar’s new head of paid social advertising for ad:s, a dedicated multi-channel marketing platform developed by the firm. Tinnelly will lead a team of paid social media socialists to develop client campaigns and tap into ad:s potential for creating compelling marketing messages.</p>
<p>Paid Social Media Advertising Equals Growth</p>
<p>His know-how will be appreciated given his extensive background in this particular vertical. Tinnelly worked as part of Facebook’s team for seven years, switching several roles over the years, including three years as client solutions manager at the real money gaming division and then product marketing manager for global gaming at the company.</p>
<p>His role as part of the Facebook team has been instrumental in helping him understand how marketing campaigns and paid advertisements can help betting brands reach a global audience and see a strong return on investment.</p>
<p>Sportradar CPO for Sports Entertainment Rainer Geier welcomed the appointment and said that Tinnelly’s senior role as part of the Facebook team had made him a known face in the iGaming industry.</p>
<p>“We’re thrilled to have him onboard as we continue to evolve our ad:s offering, combining proprietary and gaming-specific technology, with the best strategic and executional talent in the sector.” Sportradar CPO for Sports Entertainment Rainer Geier</p>
<p>Tinnelly welcomed the appointment with equal zest and said that he had witnessed the transformative effect paid social media could have on sports betting operations.</p>
<p>Sportradar to Push Paid Advertising Notch Further</p>
<p>His work as part of the Sportradar team and access to ad:s will allow him to scale up that experience and turn it into actionable solutions for brands.</p>
<p>“Through ad:s; our leading betting-focused marketing solutions technology, Sportradar can help sportsbooks across the world achieve strong ROI for their businesses by driving meaningful fan engagement.” Sportradar head of paid social advertising Brendan Tinnelly</p>
<p>Sportradar has experienced some rejuggling at the top with the most recent appointment of Andrew Bimson as the company’s chief operating officer for North America. Sportradar similarly added Jim Brown, a former NCAA managing director of enterprise and risk management, as the company’s new head of integrity services and harm prevention in North America.</p>
<p>Sportradar remains committed to helping brands across a number of verticals that require actionable data from the world of sport. One of Sportradar’s main business interests has been the eradication of fraud from sports.</p>
<p>Thanks to the company’s fraud monitoring technology, a lot of progress has been made in this field over the past years.</p>
