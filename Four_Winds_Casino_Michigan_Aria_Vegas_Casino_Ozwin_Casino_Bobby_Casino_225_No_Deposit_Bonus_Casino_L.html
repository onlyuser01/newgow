    <h1>Four Winds Casino Michigan Aria Vegas Casino Ozwin Casino Bobby Casino 225 No Deposit Bonus Casino L</h1>

<p>I have been playing Netent games and testing there volatility and RTP and after playing thousands of spins I’m disappointed in how they play and payout.</p>
<p>Finn and the Swirly spin endless dead spins and when you do get a run pays such small returns. If you get the feature and get to the magic kingdom you know what your going to win at best before you’ve played it. If you get a high return prior to getting the key in the centre you will get a small return in the magic kingdom. If I played £50 .50p spins 8/10 I would lose it. If I doubled my money I was lucky.</p>
<p>Gonzos quest the feature never or rarely comes up getting the 3 dishes in a row. When you do get the free fall spins it hardly ever pays big. 9/10 I would lose my stake.</p>
<p>Starburst is a joke it’s no wonder so many casinos give you welcome free spins bonus on this game because you never win anything!! Just dead spin after dead spin</p>
<p>Aloha Clusters or what ever it’s called the same rubbish!! Waste of time and if you played for real money!</p>
<p>The reason I played Netent games a couple of years ago was they used to be quite decent and you could win That’s when not many casinos had them. Now every casino has them and I’m certain the RTP has gone way down to what it was they are just money makers for the casinos and themselves as they fleece you. It’s know wonder they just brought Red Tiger games for 220 million quid. Big profits from their games because of such poor returns for the players. When I said I have played and tested them playing 1000s of spins I mean it That’s the good thing about Casino Guru you can play and test these games for yourself in demo mode. Most casinos haven’t even bothered to upgrade the games to touch and auto play which is another gripe of mine.</p>
