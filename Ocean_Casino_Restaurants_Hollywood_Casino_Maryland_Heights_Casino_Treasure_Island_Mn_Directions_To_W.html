<p>Another supplier has been distinguished for delivering a product that has struck home with slot fans in February 2023</p>
<p>Push Gaming has become the latest company to win the Most Watched &amp; Most Streamed Slot Award in the Tier 2 Category for February hosted by GamblingNews and realized with the help of Casinolytics, an analytics firm that tracks slot streaming data.</p>
<p>The silverware is awarded to Push Gaming for the company’s Retro Tapes slot and crowns the efforts the supplier has been putting in delivering new and refreshing experiences across the board. Retro Tapes breaks the “slot mold” and creates a new gaming paradigm that has struck home with players and streamers.</p>
<p>The game features a Cluster Link mechanic, a Push Gaming original, and a whole lot of other cool symbols and payout opportunities including Wild Multipliers, Instant Prizes, a Magnet, and Extra Spins, which are in themselves novelty additions to the company’s portfolio of games.</p>
<p>Featuring a 10,000x highest observed win, and RTPS between 94.46% and 96.47%, this slot provides a fantastic experience for both desktop and mobile players. Push Gaming’s success in attracting the biggest audiences with its slot in February is the result of meticulous research and commitment to building games that are eye-catching and come with the underpinning mechanics that make them a worthy entertainment option.</p>
<p>Push Gaming principal game producer Amit Samji welcomed the opportunity to see the game distinguished by GamblingNews and Casinolytics and had this to add:</p>
<p>We’re delighted to see Retro Tapes win Most Streamed and Most Watched Slot in February. We really enjoyed creating this game and it’s great to see that players are loving it too! Push Gaming principal game producer Amit Samji</p>
<p>GamblingNews’ own head of partnerships Pras Sri was pleased to award the silverware at the Hippodrome Casino in London.</p>
