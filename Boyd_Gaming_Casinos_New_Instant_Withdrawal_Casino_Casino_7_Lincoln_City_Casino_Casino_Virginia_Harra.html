<p>Yes, oddsmakers are already looking to next October and taking bets on which team will win the MLB title.</p>
<p>In Las Vegas, the Westgate SuperBook has the Houston Astros with the shortest odds at 5/1 (implied odds of 16.67 percent). A $100 bet and a Houston title nets $500 come 12 months from now.</p>
<p>The Los Angeles Dodgers and New York Yankees follow at 6/1, and the Atlanta Braves (10/1) and Boston Red Sox (12/1) round out the top five.</p>
<p>Champion Underdogs</p>
<p>What’s it take to get a little respect? After thrilling viewers in a best-of-seven that will be talked about for decades – and be remembered as the first World Series to see the road team win in each game – the champion Washington Nationals are at 14/1 to repeat. That is implied odds of 6.67 percent, a $100 bet netting $1,400.</p>
<p>The Nationals have the sixth-shortest odds for 2020. But, of course, the champs certainly don’t care what Las Vegas thinks at the moment.</p>
<p>My whole life, I dreamed of being a big leaguer. And when you dream of being a big leaguer, you dream of winning the World Series,” Nationals Game 7 starter Max Scherzer said.</p>
<p>Though Washington is at 14/1 for the 2020 World Series, it’s a far shorter line than where they began the 2019 season. Oddsmakers had them around 50/1 to win the Commissioner’s Trophy – the fortunate bettors who took those odds netting $5,000 for every $100 wagered.</p>
<p>The William Hill sportsbook in West Virginia confirmed it took a $15,000 bet on the Nationals at 22/1 nearly a year ago. The ticket slip paid $330,000.</p>
<p>Regardless, the Nationals’ victory over the heavily favored Astros was what most sportsbooks needed. Houston entered the series as the largest favorite in more than a decade at 5/12 (-240).</p>
<p>MLB Odds</p>
<p>As for the rest of the league, after the top six shortest 2020 odds, it’s the Cleveland Indians at 16/1, St. Louis Cardinals at 18/1, and Philadelphia Phillies, New York Mets, Chicago Cubs, Milwaukee Brewers, Tampa Bay Rays, and Minnesota Twins at 20/1.</p>
<p>The longest odds for the 2020 World Series are on the Miami Marlins, Baltimore Orioles, Detroit Tigers, and Kansas City Royals – all at 1000/1. The line implies a chance of 0.1 percent. A $100 bet would net $100,000.</p>
<p>Title Droughts</p>
<p>The Nationals’ championship is the franchise’s first in its 50-year history that began as the Montreal Expos and moved to the US Capitol in 2005.</p>
<p>The Indians by far have the longest World Series win drought at 71 years, the tribe’s last championship coming in 1949. The Texas Rangers are a distant second at 59 years, and Brewers third at 51 years.</p>
