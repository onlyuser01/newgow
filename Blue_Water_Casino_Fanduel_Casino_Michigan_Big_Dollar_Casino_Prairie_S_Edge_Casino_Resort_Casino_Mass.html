<p>The Spelinspektionen, Sweden’s gambling regulator, has announced a new addition to its team. As reported by the inspectorate, it will welcome the experienced Kristina Geiger as the head of its department for operational support.</p>
<p>In her new position, Geiger will be a part of the Spelinspektionen’s management team. She will leverage her experience in management positions to help the inspectorate improve its operations.</p>
<p>Prior to joining the Spelinspektionen, Geiger served as the financial manager of the Norwegian State Museum of History. Before joining the Museum, she held positions at the Swedish Competition Authority, the Karolinska Institute and the Government. Her track record also includes a tenure as a national expert at the European Commission.</p>
<p>Geiger will assume office on August 7, Sweden’s gambling regulator announced.</p>
<p>Geiger Is Happy to Join the Authority</p>
<p>Camilla Rosenberg, the Spelinspektionen’s director general, welcomed the new appointee on board, praising her experience and knack for driving change.</p>
<p>We welcome Kristina to our team! With her on board, we get an experienced leader with the habit of driving change. Camilla Rosenberg, director general, Spelinspektionen</p>
<p>Kristina Geiger also commented on the matter, sharing her sentiments on joining the Swedish regulator. She said that she cannot wait to be a part of the inspectorate’s mission to govern gaming in the country.</p>

<p>Two weeks ago, the Spelinspektionen confirmed that Rosenberg will continue serving as the head of the inspectorate through October 2026. She originally joined the regulator in 2017, when the regulator was still called Lotteriinspektionen. Rosenberg retained her role when the operator changed its name in 2019.</p>
<p>Speaking of Sweden, a recent report showed that the local gaming industry has reached equilibrium. Despite what some may perceive as stagnation, the local gambling industry is still going strong while providing sufficient protection to its players.</p>
<p>In Q1 2023, the Swedish gambling industry reported revenue of $609.3 million, which was nearly identical to the one recorded in Q1 2022. State lottery and slots experienced a sales boost but their performance was insufficient to offset the losses other verticals recorded.</p>
<p>Last month, the Spelinspektionen was allowed to block payments from unlicensed operators. These new powers were granted to the authority in hopes of bringing down gambling harm rates and protecting local customers from harm.</p>
<p>While the country is known as a fairly strict market, it is still an attractive destination for many gambling companies, such as Playtech, which recently agreed to supply 10bet with content in the UK and Sweden.</p>
