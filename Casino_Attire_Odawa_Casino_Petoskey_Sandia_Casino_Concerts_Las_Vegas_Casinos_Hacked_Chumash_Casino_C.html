<p>Bovada Sports Review: What You Need to Know</p>
<p>Bovada is an operator with close to ten years in business. Originally started in 2011, the company launched as a full-service sportsbook dedicated to US players. The company quickly transitioned to cater to other tastes outside the world of sports betting, including poker and online casino.</p>
<p>Fast forward to 2020 and Bovada is the leading sportsbook in the United States outpacing any other offshore or mainland operator in terms of sheer user volume, betting handle, and general interest.</p>
<p>Bovada wasn’t always known under its current name. Back in the 2000s, the portal went by Bodog. After the passage of UIEGA in 2006, sportsbooks in the United States were shuttered, but Bodog decided to stick around, bringing it immense dividends.</p>
<p>However, in 2007, due to strong regulatory pressure, ownership of the company was transferred to the Mohawk Morris Gaming Group (MMGG) who are based in the Canadian Indian Territory.</p>
<p>The company is the present owner of Bovada, and it has been under MMGG’s skilled leadership that the brand has grown to a stature of prominent within the online sports betting community in the United States.</p>
<p>In 2011, MMGG decide to split the European and American traffic, tailoring the better part of Bodog as Bovada, a sportsbook that would only cater to US players moving forward. Meanwhile, players from Europe were redirected to Bodog.eu. It only took a few years for Bovada to establish itself as the leading brand in the United States and by 2014, most sports bettors agreed that Bovada’s supremacy on the online sports betting market was undeniable.</p>
<p>Bovada Sports: Markets and Available Bets</p>
<p>Bovada has an extensive selection of available markets based on current events in the world of sports. The sportsbook covers 27 disciplines ranging from golf to basketball to horse racing, motorsports, and every mainstream competition imaginable.</p>
<p>Bovada Sports always uses an intuitive left-hand side panel to list all Trending Events and give you a quick overview of which events are currently active and draw sufficient interest, and where you can place a bet.</p>
<p>Bovada Sports is clearly big on all American sports and US leagues, including the NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL, and MLS. The sports betting site makes sure to cover these markets extensively, offering early and competitive odds as well as good pricing.</p>
<p>Sports bettors can choose to adjust the odds format the way they think is best, which includes American Odds, Decimal Odds, and Fractional Odds. There are other filters that allow you to filter the sports calendar by Event or by Bet Type.</p>
<p>You can home in on a particular sports contest or perhaps pick from Game Lines and Futures if you prefer. The most popular betting types are Spread, Win, and Total, not counting the proposition bets that are individual to each event.</p>
<p>Is Bovada Available to US Players?</p>
<p>Bovada Sports is both a legitimate online sportsbook for US bettors to explore and also the most preferred betting site. There are at least several reasons why players from the USA trust Bovada time and again:</p>
<p>The sportsbook honors payouts as per the T&amp;C’s</p>
<p>Bovada covers all major sports betting events</p>
<p>The website is mobile-friendly and intuitive</p>
<p>Bettors may choose from thousands of bets</p>
<p>Bovada runs a 24/7 customer support line</p>
<p>For these reasons and others, Bovada Sports remains the leading website available to players in America today.</p>
<p>Bovada Banking Methods</p>
<p>Bovada uses a variety of banking options to make the user experience more convenient. One way to do this is to ensure that bettors have access to the best and quickest payment methods. For this reason, Bovada has a mixed bag of payment options that make all deposits and withdrawals quick and easy.</p>
<p>Bettors will get a chance to bank using credit cards such as Visa and MasterCard as well as various cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and BitcoinCash. Other payment options include e-checks, which are used to withdraw money from the website.</p>
<p>Deposits</p>
<p>Players may deposit with MasterCard, Visa, Bitcoin, or BitcoinCash. The maximum deposit amount will vary. For bank cards, it is $1,500, but you can deposit $5,000 with Bitcoin and BitcoinCash. As to the minimum deposit, it is $10 for cryptocurrencies and $20 for credit cards. All transactions take up to a few minutes to complete.</p>
<p>Withdrawals</p>
<p>Withdrawals are a little trickier as they may take a few days to complete. The good news is Bovada Sports has found a great workaround. Bettors can generally request cashouts using one of the following methods:</p>
<p>Bitcoin</p>
<p>BitcoinCash</p>
<p>Check By Courier</p>
<p>Wire Transfer</p>
<p>Voucher</p>
<p>Withdrawals with cryptocurrencies take up to 15 minutes and are FREE. You may withdraw up to $9,500. The other option is a Check by Courier which will take up to 10 business days to arrive. The check is limited at $100-$3000, and there is a 3% fee plus a $50 one-off fee.</p>
<p>Wire Transfers are similar to Check by Courier, but both methods are reliable and some bettors prefer them if they are a little crypto-averse.</p>
<p>Bovada Sports Betting Bonuses</p>
<p>Another huge part of the Bovada experience is the bonuses, which will come ready to offer you great value. Presently, Bovada supports several promotions available to sports bettors who are interested in growing their bankroll quickly and without any complications.</p>
<p>$750 Bitcoin Welcome Bonus</p>
<p>The first option features a 75% Bitcoin Welcome Bonus up to $750. To activate the bonus, all you need to do is make the minimum qualifying deposit and redeem the BTCSWB750 bonus code.</p>
<p>Once the bonus has been allocated to your account, you are good to go. The bonus is subject to a 5X rollover requirement on sports and horses. If you are not privy to Bitcoin just yet, Bovada has you covered with a dedicated page that explains how to purchase, use and bet with the cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>$250 Welcome Bonus</p>
<p>For FIAT users, Bovada Sports has prepared a 50% matched bonus up to $250, which will allow you to top up your bankroll just as well. The bonus amount will be credited within 30 minutes of activating the promotion.</p>
<p>To clear the bonus amount, all you need to do is stake the bonus amount 5X times as per the bonus’ Terms &amp; Conditions. It’s important to remember and not try to withdraw your bonus funds before you have rolled over the entire amount of the bonus, otherwise, your bonus will be forfeited.</p>
<p>What Are Bovada Dual Lines?</p>
<p>Becoming a member of Bovada’s sportsbook you must know about the so-called Dual Lines. Bovada offers very soft lines to users who want to have some fun and bet recreationally. Yet, if a customer is a well-seasoned bettor, he or she might trigger the Dual Lines feature.</p>
<p>In betting vernacular, these lines are known as “square lines” and “sharp lines.” This basically means that you get a set of more challenging odds and lines on occasion, especially if your account history backs it up.</p>
<p>The easiest way to check if you are facing Dual Lines is to always use an Incognito Mode browser and check Bovada’s lines on a game you want to bet on. This should usually display the square lines, i.e. the standard odds you can bet on. Each bettor who goes on a winning spree can expect to face somewhat more challenging odds.</p>
<p>Now, the question naturally comes down to whether this is far. Sports bettors have no complaints against the feature, as it allows Bovada to stay competitive. Of course, sharp lines take a lot of skill to master. Some bettors advise you to try and predict what Bovada thinks you are going to do next and what markets you are going to bet on and bet against them.</p>
<p>In a way, you are trying to Fade the Public, i.e. use a popular stratagem to bet against public perception and opinion. However, this time you will be betting against the sportsbook instead.</p>
<p>Bovada Sportsbook Has a Clear American Focus</p>
<p>Naturally tailored to the tastes of the American bettor, Bovada has a lot to offer. Players will be able to place bets on all events that are popular in the country, including the NFL, MLB, NBA, NHL as well as college sports, such as NCAAF and NCAAB. The XFL hit another unfortunate spell in 2020 and had to be shut down but prior to that, US bettors were very welcome to make their bets on the semi-professional football league.</p>
<p>While the domestic focus is important, there are tons of other markets you can bet on, including tennis, golf, and horse racing. European soccer is one of the most heavily covered events, but the sportsbook also features table tennis, darts, electronic sports, various motorsports, and more.</p>
<p>How Much Can You Bet Per Game?</p>
<p>Every sportsbook is free to determine its own betting limits and Bovada Sports is no exception. The sportsbook has set generous maximum bets per event, with the numbers varying based on interest and individual games. However, there is a good baseline you can use to compare and see what to expect.</p>
<p>Bovada presently accepts bets up to $5,000 on NFL and NCAA games and specifically sides. The bookmaker also accepts $1,000 on parlays, teasers, and totals. For spreads, the maximum is once again set at $1,000.</p>
<p>Most sports bettors agree that apart from allowing for fairly high staking limits, Bovada also offers fair pricing that allows players to make the most out of their big bets.</p>
<p>Bovada Sports Mobile App</p>
<p>Bovada Sports doesn’t offer a mobile app at the present moment. However, the sportsbook has been fully optimized for all devices, including iOS and Android smartphones and tablets, which allows players to bet on the go without having to worry about anything in particular. All bets, banking options, and customer support are available from a mobile device.</p>
<p>Bovada Sports: What Does Reddit Say?</p>
<p>Reddit has long been one of the safest and most easily verifiable sources of information. If you think someone’s opinion is too biased, you can always check their comments history and see if they have an agenda. Overall, though, Reddit offers some valuable insight that allows you to come to more informed choices and us to put together a more reliable Bovada Sports review.</p>
<p>Reddit users and bettors have generally been very positive about the website and what it has to offer. There have been some minor complaints about the Juice here and there, and some users have protested against the cashout feature.</p>
<p>However, we have found complaints about the banking system to usually be due to the user’s mistake of not reading the T&amp;C’s in full or being fully familiar with the cash out conditions beforehand. Here is what some Reddit users had to say about the website:</p>
<p>“ Only issue I’ve noticed with Bovada is they often times have more juice in their lines than other sites.” – TokinBlack</p>
<p>“Bovada has a huge market share – hence lots of complaints. But they’re just fine. If anything, they’re one of the most trustworthy sites available to Americans.” – DjBayko</p>
<p>“Speaking from experience, I’m Legend LVL 2 status. I’ve honestly never really had a problem on Bovada. The deposits are usually super-fast. Most time I get my payout with 2 days, sometimes as fast as like 12 hours. I would recommend looking into bitcoin though. Makes the process 1000 times easier.” – Pigman02</p>
<p>Some opinions are of course more shaded, and bettors may have had their mishap here and there. Overall, however, Bovada lives up to public scrutiny and establish itself as a trustworthy sportsbook to visit if you are a US resident.</p>
<p>Bovada Sports Customer Support</p>
<p>Bovada runs a dedicated customer support line available 24/7. Should you need help, you will be able to get it via email at [email protected] or at the toll-free phone line: 1-888-263-0000 or live chat. Most players prefer to hop in a live chat window, as it provides the quickest response and most commonly leads to the fastest solutions. If you prefer to start by looking somewhere else, the FAQ section will definitely come handy, as it already has an answer to the most pressing questions</p>
<p>Conclusion: Sportsbook Leader in the United States</p>
<p>With years of experience on the market, Bovada Sports is one of the most trusted online sports betting websites in the United States. Whether this is owing to the sheer visibility of the website or the genuine strive to provide you with competitive odds is for you to decide. Users, sports fans and bettors agree that Bovada remains one of their top destinations for sports betting in the USA.</p>
