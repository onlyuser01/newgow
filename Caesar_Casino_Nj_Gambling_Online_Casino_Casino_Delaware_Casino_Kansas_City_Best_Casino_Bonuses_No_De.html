    <h1>Caesar Casino Nj Gambling Online Casino Casino Delaware Casino Kansas City Best Casino Bonuses No De</h1>

<p>Dear mehrdad1341,</p>
<p>Thank you for your patience. Unfortunately, after a thorough review of the case and discussing the issue internally, we are rejecting this complaint as ‘unjustified’.</p>
<p>As you might know, the bonus you claimed was so-called ‘sticky’. This means that the initial bonus amount is considered non-cashable (it is deducted upon withdrawal). Unfortunately, this also means that such bonuses are considered active even after the wagering requirements have been met and there is a good reason why.</p>
<p>Imagine a situation where a player deposits $100 and gets $200 as a bonus. They now have $300 to play with. Let’s say that after finishing the wagering requirement (which is usually very low in this type of bonuses), the player is left with $250. If the bonus would end automatically, $200 would be deducted, leaving the player with just $50. Would the player be satisfied? Well, most players wouldn’t. Most players would prefer to continue playing with the $250 to get a chance to increase their balance. This is why after completing the wagering requirements, players need to decide when they want to cash out. We consider this system not to be very user-friendly but unfortunately, there’s no other way to end a bonus in the RTG software.</p>
<p>This brings us to the discussed situation. Casinos have the right to restrict certain games while playing with bonus money. This is because different games will have a different house edge. If the casino would allow players to use bonus funds on games with a small house edge, such as Blackjack, it would greatly increase the cost of the bonus for the casino.</p>
<p>For standard bonuses, we recommend casinos not to void winnings, but not count bets made on restricted games towards wagering requirements. This way bonus hunters can’t take the advantage of playing these games. For sticky bonuses, however, this wouldn’t help as the attached wagering requirements are often too low and the cost of the bonus is not reduced by the fact that players have to fulfill them, but rather by the fact that the initial bonus amount is deducted at the end. This way players can get a significant advantage by playing games with a very small house edge. If players would be allowed to do this, it wouldn’t be possible for the casino to offer these bonuses anymore.</p>
<p>We strongly believe that all casinos should enforce these rules by software so players are not able to play restricted games with an active bonus. Unfortunately, the vast majority of casinos, including ones using the RTG software, do not have such feature implemented, and the industry standard is to just list the restricted games in the Terms and Conditions. This is why we aren’t giving any major penalty for this at the moment.</p>
