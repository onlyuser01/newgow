    <h1>Columbus Casino Best Online Real Money Casino Casino Near Council Bluffs Casino Casino Montreal Mad</h1>

<p>Hello</p>
<p>I was playing on Mad Rush and won in two rounds. One amount was 150 euros and the other was 300 euros. I made the withdrawal of both amounts on January 19, yet only one amount was paid out on January 22 (150 euros). I have been in email contact with support at kyc@madrush.com several times about why they are not paying out the 300 euros I have requested. The money is still listed as processing so I cannot even take it back to play with. It's locked.... I have submitted verification documents and they were confirmed satisfactory in an email response.</p>
<p>Here is what they wrote in an email dated February 1:</p>
<p>Thank you for your kind patience in this matter.</p>
<p>Even though we fully understand the inconvenience caused and appreciate where you are coming from, we strive to process your withdrawal request as quickly and efficiently as possible.</p>
<p>We are currently investigating the case to better understand where the funds are located, and this involves other responsible departments that we need to hear from.</p>
<p>We want to emphasize that your money is safe and understand the trouble this causes.</p>
<p>As soon as we hear from the concerned department, we will contact you immediately.</p>
<p>Thank you for your cooperation and patience in the meantime!</p>
<p>If you have further questions or concerns, you're welcome to ask. We are here to help you!</p>
<p>Now my patience is running out. I have never experienced it taking this long to get paid out winnings. What makes me doubt that I will get the money is that they were able to payout 150 euros within 3 days from withdrawal, but not 300 euros.</p>
