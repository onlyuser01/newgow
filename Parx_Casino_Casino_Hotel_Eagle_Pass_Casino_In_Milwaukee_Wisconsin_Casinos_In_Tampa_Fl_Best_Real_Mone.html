<p>Bragg Gaming Group, a prominent developer and provider of online casino games, has struck a new content partnership with Caliente Interactive, a leading iGaming operator in the Mexican market. Thanks to this new partnership and owing to the necessary licenses owned by both companies, Bragg will see many of its games now arrive on Caliente Interactive’s platform in Mexico.</p>
<p>The alliance reflects Bragg’s strong ambitions for the North American market and its increasing footprint in the region. Thanks to the tie-up, Caliente Interactive players will have access to a number of Bragg’s games, including Golden Eyes, Fairy Dust and the Girl, and Egyptian Magic.</p>
<p>Caliente Interactive will, in fact, gain access to both games developed by Bragg and its partner studios which will together comprise an outstanding library for the operator to benefit from and bring to its own iGaming audiences. Commenting on this opportunity, Bragg Gaming Group Chief Executive Officer Yaniv Sherman said that the company was very happy to have secured this milestone.</p>
<p>Sherman spoke highly of Bragg’s own proprietary products and said that together with the premium third-party content that it can now bring to Caliente Interactive, Mexicanplayers will have access to some of the best and most innovative iGaming products worldwide.</p>
<p>"We have already made tremendous progress with our North American growth strategy, and we expect our success will continue to accelerate as we debut our new offerings in additional iGaming markets across this region," Sherman said with confidence. Mexico alone is on track to hit $814m in gross win from the iGaming segment according to H2 Gambling Capital, a research firm and consultancy, cited by Bragg.</p>
<p>Sherman said that Bragg and its proprietary studio, Atomic Slot Lab, are in a strong position to continue to dictate the iGaming narrative in North America and become a leading supplier in the region. Meanwhile, Bragg has been delivering on this promise, spreading its reach in places such as New Jersey.</p>
<p>The company teamed up with ResortsCasino.com and MoheganSunCasino.com in the Garden State to power both digital platforms with its iGaming products. The company also struck a content partnership with Caesars Sportsbook &amp; Casino, again covering the New Jersey market. Elsewhere, the supplier has been growing its European footprint with a content alliance with 32Red in the United Kingdom.</p>
