<p>Stakelogic has expanded its reach in the Baltic markets with a fresh content partnership that will now cover the Estonian and Latvian markets through local powerhouse OlyBet. OlyBet is an established and respected operator in the region and the iGaming sector, and it will now make it possible for local players to enjoy and access Stakelogic’s diverse selection of slots.</p>
<p>Classic and Modern Slots to Hit Shelves at OlyBet</p>
<p>OlyBet will go ahead with the full range of Stakelogic games that will be made available to players interested in accessing the supplier’s award-winning and highly praised games. Those titles include Mighty Joker Arcade, Hot 7 Hold and Spin, Ultra Joker, Hot Joker, and many more options that are part of Stakelogic’s native portfolio of classic slot gaming titles.</p>
<p>The deal will extend to Stakelogic’s latest releases with the supplier also delivering on its most innovative content options to local players in Estonia and Latvia. Some of these games include Hola Frutas, Wild Moon Saloon, and El Cowboy Megaways.</p>
<p>The deal will also cover the Super Stake mechanic which is a proprietary solution developed by the supplier in order to elevate its own signature style and deliver thrilling gameplay opportunities to audiences in targeted markets.</p>
<p>Through this mechanic, players can double their bets in order to increase their chance of hitting a bonus feature as they hunt for better wins as part of their regular gameplay. Stakelogic sales manager Neil Tanti said that the company was thrilled to be teaming up with OlyBet and deploy its product throughout Estonia and Latvia.</p>
<p>These are fast-growth markets where players now demand access to the best slots in the business, something that Stakelogic strives to provide with each game we release into our varied portfolio. Stakelogic sales manager Neil Tanti</p>
