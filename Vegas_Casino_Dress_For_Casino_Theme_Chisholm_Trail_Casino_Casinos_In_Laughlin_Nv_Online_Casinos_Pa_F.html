<p>The global digital sports platform, Fanatics Holdings Inc., announced that its online and retail sports betting subsidiary, Fanatics Betting and Gaming, soft-launched online and retail sports betting for customers in Connecticut. The soft launch comes after a deal between the company and the Connecticut Lottery Corporation (CLC), the official lottery in the state. Per that agreement, Fanatics Sportsbook was designated as CLC's exclusive sports betting partner for retail, as well as mobile wagering.</p>
<p>Sports fans across Connecticut will soon be able to tap into new thrilling retail betting experiences by visiting the CT Lottery's 10 retail locations. Those retail betting outlets will be revamped with new signage, as well as brand-new self-service betting kiosks from Suzohapp. Moreover, visitors to the retail sports betting locations will benefit from enhanced odds screens, a statement reveals.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the collaboration, retail sports betting outlets will feature odds provided by Fanatics Sportsbook for a wide range of popular sports, including baseball, tennis, basketball, professional and college football, boxing, MMA, golf and soccer.</p>
<p>Starting this week, different CLC retail betting locations around Connecticut will undergo the transition to the Fanatics Sportsbook. Such locations include Winners in Hartford, Manchester, Milford, New Britain and Waterbury, Sports Haven in New Haven and Aroogas in Shelton, among others.</p>
<p>Besides the retail betting, the agreement between the CT Lottery and Fanatics Betting and Gaming brings a mobile sports betting app. This week, the Fanatics Sportsbook will accept 2,000 online customers. Its soft launch comes in anticipation of its full launch planned for next week Monday, December 18, 2023.</p>
<p>The sports betting app is available for Android and iOS devices and promises exceptional experiences. The entry in Connecticut marks Fanatics Sportsbook's latest launch and represents the ninth state where the mobile app is available.</p>
<p>Sports fans and bettors alike in Connecticut will benefit from Fanatics Sportsbook's engaging options such as FanCash, the Fanatics loyalty program's currency that can be converted dollar-for-dollar into Bonus Bets. Moreover, using FanCash, bettors and sports fans can buy merchandise for their favorite teams.</p>
<p>Additional features the Fanatics Sportsbook offers include live streaming capabilities, powered by Genius Sports Limited. In fact, the sportsbook was one of the first to launch the unique live betting product, BetVision, which allows sports fans to wager while enjoying live streaming. Connecticut bettors can also benefit from Fanatics' leading search functionality which includes a search history, autocomplete, as well as links to related events, markets and leagues.</p>
