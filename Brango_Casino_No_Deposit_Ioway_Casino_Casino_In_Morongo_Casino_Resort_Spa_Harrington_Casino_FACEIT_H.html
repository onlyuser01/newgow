<p>The competitive format will be split into eight separate events held online with the first event starting on May 31. The event will feature a number of well-recognized esports entities, including:</p>
<p>Team SoloMid</p>
<p>Team Liquid</p>
<p>Complexity Gaming</p>
<p>100 Thieves</p>
<p>Gen. G Esports</p>
<p>More organizations, including the 76ers-owned Dignitas, Fnatic, Misfits, and G2 Esports are also coming into the competitive fray on Friday. Previously, FACEIT teamed up with T1 to host a quick tournament for Apex Legends, which attracted significant interest. The Mach-tournament featured a number of high-profile streamers. A Twitch tournament with a prize pool $100,000 was also held earlier this year.</p>
<p>Tyler “Ninja” Blevins, a Fortnite star, was paid $1 million to play Apex Legends and drive interest in the game, a report revealed. Apex Legends continued to break records and effectively surpassed Fortnite in terms of total simultaneous players. Some called the game “the new gaming gold rush,” with plenty of room left for the battle royale genre to develop.</p>
<p>Apex Legends secured excellent player base just a month within its release date, puling 50 million players in a record time, and displacing Fortnite as the hottest battle royale game. EA did, as previously stated, initiate a very aggressive marketing campaign that helped it build the numbers quickly and beyond recognition.</p>
<p>The marketing push definitely helped Apex Legends stay on top of the gaming charts, but it is the battle royale title’s own merits that have helped it remain relevant months after its release date.</p>
<p>However, not everything is well in paradise. Micro transactions for the game generated a reported $92 million in February, but the numbers performed comparatively poorly in March, when the game generated only $24 million from the sales of various goodies.</p>
<p>Now that he initial excitement has died down, a fair question would be – is Apex Legends really better than Fortnite?</p>
