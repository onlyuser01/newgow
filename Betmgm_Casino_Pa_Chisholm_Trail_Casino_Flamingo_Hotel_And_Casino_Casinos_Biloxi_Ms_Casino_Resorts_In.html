<p>The Casino Association of New Jersey (CANJ) made a press release revealing that Mark Giannantonio will take over as the organization’s new president. Giannantonio has over 35 years of industry experience, and his appointment is effective immediately.</p>
<p>The Organization Represents Atlantic City Casinos and Resorts</p>
<p>CANJ’s primary purpose is to represent the interests of the Atlantic City casino industry. The organization advocates for beneficial legislation, supporting Atlantic City’s growing tourism industry. CANJ represents most of Atlantic City’s high-profile casinos and resorts. It is currently involved in several initiatives and advocates against the ongoing smoking ban efforts in New Jersey.</p>
<p>Giannantonio is taking over the position of Joe Lupo, president of the Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino Atlantic City. He will be relocating to Las Vegas to manage the Mirage Hotel &amp; Casino, leaving him unable to fulfill his duties as CANJ president. Lupo expressed confidence in Giannantonio’s abilities and experience and named him a worthy successor.</p>
<p>Mark is a lifelong Atlantic County resident who cares deeply about this city and community, and I am confident he will be a great voice for the industry moving forward. Joe Lupo, president of Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino Atlantic City</p>
<p>Giannantonio Is an Experienced Professional</p>
<p>Mark Giannantonio lauded the efforts of his predecessor, noting that Lupo had performed an excellent job as a leader of the organization. He vowed to work for the benefit of Atlantic City and elevate it into a leading destination resort.</p>
<p>I have deep roots in this community, and I am ready to work together with the city and the state to continue to advance Atlantic City. Mark Giannantonio, CANJ president</p>
<p>Giannantonio has over 35 years of experience in the gambling industry and has earned the trust and respect of his fellow CANJ members. He was previously CEO and president of Tropicana Atlantic City and now leads Resorts Casino Hotel. Giannantonioa also holds several positions on advisory boards and committees at Stockton University and is part of the board of the Atlantic City Police Foundation.</p>
<p>Atlantic City Is on the Road to Recovery</p>
<p>The new president will have to navigate the region’s post-COVID recovery amidst the coming summer season. The gambling and resort industry recently experienced a minor shock due to ongoing strikes by casino workers. However, the issue was resolved amicably, with all nine casinos in Atlantic City accepting the Union’s proposal. Giannantonio’s Resorts Casino was among the last to agree to the terms of the agreement, but showed public support for his workers and expressed optimism that the sector could move forward.</p>
<p>The region has recently experienced a slow but steadily improving recovery. In Q1, the Atlantic City casino industry marked an increase of over 25% compared to 2021, and the results exceeded pre-pandemic levels for the first time. The favorable results were attributed to a packed event schedule and improved visitor sentiment.</p>
