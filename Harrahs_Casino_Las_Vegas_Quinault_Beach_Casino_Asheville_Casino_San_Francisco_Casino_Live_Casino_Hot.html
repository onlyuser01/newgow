<p>BetMakers, a company that focuses on the development of software and data analytics for the sports wagering market in Australia, has secured the talent of Anna Massion, an industry veteran who has worked on the executive level for several companies in the sector.</p>
<p>North American Pivot Gathers Momentum</p>
<p>Massion is joining the company as a non-executive director and she will offer advice on the overall strategy and direction for the company. Massion is also a non-executive director at Playtech, Artemis Strategic Investment Corp, and AGS. Her expertise in the gambling industry makes her a strong asset for the companies she weighs in on to advise on overall strategy.</p>
<p>She is also based in North America, and the United States in particular, which coincides with BetMakers’ ambitions to expand in the region beyond its native Australian market. The company has already been on the lookout for talent in the region.</p>
<p>Previously, BetMakers secured the services of the ex-Caesars Entertainment sports and online gaming director Christian Stuart who should help the company find its bearings in the fast-developing iGaming and interactive wagering market in the United States. Commenting on this appointment, Massion said that she was thrilled to be joining and contributing to BetMakers’ future success.</p>
<p>“BetMakers Technology Group is making a serious impression as a leader in the international B2B wagering world and I am especially pleased to be associated with the future development of that global growth story.” BetMakers non-executive director Anna Massion</p>
<p>Welcomed by BetMakers as the Right Person</p>
<p>Massion is just the latest in a string of appointments that feature other industry veterans who will assist BetMakers in bringing its proprietary technology on the US market and venture further up north in Canada. The news about Mission’s appointment was welcomed by BetMakers chairman Nick Chan who said that her knowledge of the gaming wagering and gaming technology would give the company the means necessary to realize its goals in the United States.</p>
<p>BetMakers currently has over 50% of its staff based in the United States as a clear pivot towards the North American market, which will allow Massion to work directly with some of the key people on the ground in the region. BetMakers signed a 15-year agreement with the New Jersey Thoroughbred Horsemen’s Association.</p>
