<p>AffPapa continues to sign one important partner after another. The company recently entered into a partnership with SBC, a media and events company, and now topping this off with an equally important alliance – this time with iGaming NEXT, a big disruptor in the iGaming industry.</p>
<p>This new strategic partnership will bring the two companies together and allow them to tap into their shared resources, networks, and expertise to deliver even better products to their target audiences, and the iGaming industry as a whole.</p>
<p>AffPapa is the author of some of the most interesting affiliate-centric events, including the iGaming Club which is currently underway in London, and more. iGaming NEXT is an equally well-represented company and a host of excellent industry events, one of which is set for June 20, 2023, in Valletta, Malta.</p>
<p>AffPapa has been selected to host the event to get things between the two companies underway, as well as allow them to connect, network, and explore new business ventures, along with the companies they target and service. Commenting on this opportunity, iGaming NEXT Managing Director Pierre Lindh had this to say:</p>
<p>"We are thrilled to be partnering with AffPapa, an organization that shares our passion for the iGaming industry and our commitment to building strong networks while working with integrity. This partnership is a perfect fit for both of our organizations, as we both have a bright future ahead of us and together, we can achieve great things."</p>
<p>The opportunity was met with a similarly positive sentiment by Levon Nikoghosyan, AffPapa’s very own Chief Executive Officer. Nikoghosyan was thrilled about the opportunity and added:</p>
<p>"Our strong partnership will thrust iGaming networking to a whole new level. I’m very delighted that this partnership is happening with iGaming NEXT, the company behind the most elegant and information-rich conference line in our industry."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, iGaming Club London has been a success with the 500 registrations quickly filled and the 200 or so seats sold, prompting the company into launching extra options late last week. Whatever is coming NEXT, it’s bound to be exciting as both AffPapa and its new partner will be involved.</p>
