    <h1>Bellagio Hotel Casino Casino In Milwaukee Wisconsin Silver Slipper Casino Buffet French Lick Indiana</h1>

<p>This has been an ongoing issue with the casino that dates back to November.</p>
<p>I deposited several times on the casino and on the last deposit won 1400EUR. I then went threw the verification procedure which was a complete nightmare. I sent them everything I could ... ID, selfie with ID, proof of address, bank statement, online screenshots, void checks, front and back of my debit card. The casino insisted that I send them a bank statement that contained the debit card number used to deposit on the casino. The only problem with thei request is that it does not exist. They had me call my bank (head office + branch manager) to request such a document and both told me that since it is not a credit card, the number will not appear on a statement. I tried to explain it to them, and showing them that the bank statement I sent them clearly shows the transaction made to the casino and my name, if they cross referenced it to the name on the card, they would be able to verify the payment method.</p>
<p>I have spent close to 5 hours of my time between calling banks, meeting with bank managers, and chatting to explain the problem to Slotwolf chat support only to have my documents rejected each and every time. They insist that I provide them with something that does not exist despite my complete cooperation to give them anything and everything else they want. I am a mother of 2 kids, one which is still an infant and I work as well, it's difficult fo me to make time to sort this out. I would have never thought that playing on a casino online on my free time would lead to such a nightmare when it came to getting paid.</p>
<p>The casino has now disabled my account. I noticed it when I tried loggin in this morning to once again chat to someone about my issue. I ask you here on this forum to help me find a resolution to this nightmare of an issue.</p>
