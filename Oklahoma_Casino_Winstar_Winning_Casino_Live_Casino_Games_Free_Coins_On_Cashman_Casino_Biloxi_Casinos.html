<p>Sports betting operator based in the CIS region Parimatch joined the international effort to provide support to Ukraine by launching a UAH30 million ($1 million) fund.</p>
<p>Funds for Ammunitions, Food and Medicines</p>
<p>The decision to provide the funds for defenders of Ukraine that are currently fighting against the invading Russian armed forces was announced in a LinkedIn statement on the official Parimatch profile, stating the company would “not hide away from the conflict.” According to the announcement, funds provided by Parimatch would be used for ammunition, food and medicines.</p>
<p>“In these difficult times for the country and the Ukrainian people, we must act as a united front and help each other and the defenders of Ukraine.” Parimatch</p>
<p>Founded in 1994 in Kyiv Parimatch with the ambition to become the biggest online sports betting firm in the CIS territories has grown ever since to become one of the country’s leading tech businesses and valued employers with more than 2,000 people on payroll is now prepared to help the country and its people.</p>
<p>“We are ready to cooperate with volunteer organizations, charitable foundations and private business, said Parimatch in the announcement, referring to the “total shortage of necessary goods and problems with distribution,” asking about “information on where to buy and how to deliver” goods that are much needed.</p>
<p>‘We Work Here and We Want to be Here’</p>
<p>Further, the company stated its operations continued in most regions and Kyiv despite some of its employees having to join the forces defending the country in any shape or form, including blocking telegrams from disinformation channels, serving as foreign media journalists, and volunteers to help with resettlement, food and logistics for all Ukrainian people.</p>
<p>“We have added the possibility of transfers in support of the Armed Forces of Ukraine on our website. We stay in Ukraine, we work here and we want to be here.”</p>
<p>Parimatch did not provide any information regarding the future of its Russian division spearheaded by Dmitry Sergeev the operator hired in October last year to lead the company’s pivot in the region. Many European-based businesses, institutions and organizations joined the international call for sanctions against Russia by cutting ties with Russian-based businesses and entrepreneurs.</p>
