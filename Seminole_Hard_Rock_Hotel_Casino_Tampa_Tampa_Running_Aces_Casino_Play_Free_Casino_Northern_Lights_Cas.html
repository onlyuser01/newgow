<p>Hölle Games has joined First Look Games, a platform dedicated to helping developers in the iGaming industry to market and bring their games to market quickly and reliably. Hölle Games focuses on the highly competitive online slot market in Europe and will benefit from the launch with First Look Games as it would be easier for the supplier to promote its products and bring them online with established companies in key markets.</p>
<p>Hölle Games Trusts First Look Games for Further Exposure</p>
<p>Hölle Games is already aware of the inherent challenges of bringing products to market successfully and has decided to trust First Look Games as a powerful facilitator of marketing efforts. Thanks to this tie-up, the supplier will be able to gain ground with operators in Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and Switzerland, which are the company’s core markets.</p>
<p>The supplier will be able to share information about its current and upcoming releases with a number of publishers and affiliate companies which have robust traffic and can spread the word about the company’s games. Hölle will be free to upload its titles, images, logos, and videos of the games being played directly onto the First Look Games platform.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Hölle Games will be in full control of its assets thanks to the FLG Studio Management Center, which is designed to let developers control what assets are available in what markets. The developer can also feed information to affiliates and provide them with additional tools to help boost the company’s reach.</p>
<p>First Look Games founder Tom Galanis welcomed the arrival of Hölle Games as the latest studio to join the platform and have the opportunity to gain further exposure with various audiences. Galanis added:</p>
<p>At First Look Games we understand the challenges that new studios face, especially when it comes to marketing, and that’s why we offer a special start-up package aimed at developers like Hölle Games that are in the process of building momentum for their business. First Look Games founder Tom Galanis</p>
<p>Hölle Games CEO and co-founder Robert Lenzhofer said that gaining exposure was important for any brand, and especially his company. Hölle Games remains focused on Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and Switzerland and is appreciative of the opportunity to work with a platform that will help boost the supplier’s reach.</p>
<p>“This is a breakthrough partnership for us, and we look forward to taking Hölle Games to the next level with the help of our friends at First Look Games,” said Lenzhofer.</p>
