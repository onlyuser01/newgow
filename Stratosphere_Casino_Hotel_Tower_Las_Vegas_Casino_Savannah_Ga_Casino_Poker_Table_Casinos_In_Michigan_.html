<p>Caesars Entertainment continues to expand the reach of its Caesars Sportsbook app after announcing its launch into a new state. On Wednesday the company confirmed that its Caesars Sportsbook app has gone live in Massachusetts.</p>
<p>The rollout comes ahead of the planned mobile sports betting launch. It was back in August last year when Massachusetts legalized sports betting, but the launch of its retail betting market was completed recently, on January 31, 2023. Now, the gambling regulator in the state is planning to launch the mobile wagering market at some point in March.</p>
<p>In anticipation of the upcoming launch, the Caesars Sportsbook app has gone live in Massachusetts, allowing eligible customers to download it. Customers that download the app can register and make deposits. What's more, the bettors can also benefit from a special sign-up offer, a statement released by Caesars reveals.</p>
<p>The special sign-up offer for the Caesars Sportsbook app can be accessed via users that enter a promo code "CZR1H." This, according to the company will grant them $100 in Bonus Bets which breaks down to "one $25 bet the day mobile wagering goes live and three subsequent $25 Bonus Bets on a weekly basis thereafter."</p>
<p>Besides its Caesars Sportsbook app, the casino-entertainment company plans to introduce one of the largest pari-mutuel and race simulcasting venues in the US. The Caesars Sportsbook at Raynham Park is expected to offer a 30,000-square-foot of space. Currently, the company is expecting approval from the gambling regulator in Massachusetts, the Massachusetts Gaming Commission (MGC).</p>
<p>Eric Hession, Caesars Digital's President, shared his excitement on the topic saying: "The launch of our mobile app is an excellent complement to the planned Caesars Sportsbook at historic Raynham Park." Finally, he pointed out: "We're confident this combination will deliver the most rewarding sports wagering experience in the Commonwealth, allowing us to treat all sports fans like royalty."</p>
<p>Once Massachusetts launches mobile sports betting, bettors in the state will be able to benefit from Caesars Rewards, Caesars Entertainment's industry-leading loyalty program. Bettors that place a wager earn Tier Credits that help build up Reward Credits.</p>
<p>Ultimately, those Credits can help the users gain access to unique Caesars Rewards Experiences. Such include getaways with a discount to different Caesars locations, unique experiences and even bonus cash within the Caesars Sportsbook app.</p>
<p>Besides the unique loyalty program, customers in Massachusetts will be able to benefit from a variety of options for deposit, user-friendly features as well as quick and secure payouts. Besides in-play betting options, the Caesars Sportsbook app offers a variety of markets that deliver engaging experiences for bettors.</p>
