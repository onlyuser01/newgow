<p>One of London’s landmark casinos, Hippodrome Casino, announced plans to expand its existing food and drinking options, adding three new dining facilities this summer.</p>
<p>Wider Growth Strategy</p>
<p>Hippodrome Casino, located nearby Leicester Square in the capital, is planning to offer players and visitors three new dining options on top of its already existing nine facilities, following the acquisition of an additional 2,400 square feet of space.</p>
<p>“The Hippodrome has long led the way in the casino landscape, and the next phase of our development strategy is focused on elevating our position as a competitive lifestyle brand by enhancing the guest experience.” Simon Thomas, Executive Chairman, Hippodrome Casino</p>
<p>With already eight bars and a steak house under its roof, Hippodrome Casino purchased the additional space and is planning to also redevelop existing areas as part of its wider growth strategy aimed at boosting the venue’s dining and entertainment offerings.</p>
<p>“Entertainment and hospitality are at the center of everything we do at The Hippodrome, and we can’t wait to add these three new concepts to our already extensive hospitality offering.” Simon Thomas, Executive Chairman, Hippodrome Casino</p>
<p>The New Venues</p>
<p>The largest portion of the redevelopment, 1,200 square feet, will be attributed to CrêpeAffaire, an all-day eatery serving French crêpes, as well as traditional coffee and deserts, already featuring in 13 locations across London. The venue will also play host during ‘Crêpe &amp; Cocktail’ evenings.</p>
<p>Chop Chop by Four Seasons, a modern style Chinese restaurant offering its visitors the Hong Kong-inspired dishes they enjoy at all Four Season restaurants, will be the second new dining option at Hippodrome Casino this summer.</p>
<p>Both CrêpeAffaire and Chop Chop by Four Seasons will be designed by Rachel O’Toole and will open doors this July, while the opening of the third venue, a cocktail bar featuring a subterranean theme, is expected to take place later this year.</p>
<p>“We’re delighted to be kicking off with the opening of CrêpeAffaire at The Hippodrome and look forward to working closely with its creative team on this very exciting new project,” added Thomas.</p>
<p>The Hippodrome Casino, which partnered with AI tech supplier SenSen Networks to implement the firm’s real-time gaming technology and improve the overall gaming experience, received the prestigious Casino of the Year award at the Global Gaming Awards London last month.</p>
