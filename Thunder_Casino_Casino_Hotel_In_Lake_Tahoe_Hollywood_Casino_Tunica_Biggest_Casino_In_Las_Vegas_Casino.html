    <h1>Thunder Casino Casino Hotel In Lake Tahoe Hollywood Casino Tunica Biggest Casino In Las Vegas Casino</h1>

<p>Hi! Thank you very much for answering ... although I am already desperate I am going to try to claim ... I tell you the full story ... last year I deposited 20 usd because I saw a promotion in skrill, then I lost and I did not play anymore. More than a month ago I received an email that gave me a bet of 5 usd in the Italian league, I bet it double and I was left with 5 usd of real money balance, from there I started to win and it was 944 usd. from the approximate amount of 50.60 usd try to verify my account, send many photos of my id, selfies, electricity bills, after more than a week I got an email that my account was verified ... there I put to charge for skrill and I cancel the withdrawal and I get an email that I need to do an additional verification by skype video call, which already seemed strange to me because in no other bookmaker they do this, then I made the video call. and today after about a month I got an email that blocked my account for violating the point of the terms and conditions 23.6 which would be ... "</p>
<p>23.6 Users are prohibited from allowing third parties to access and use their accounts. If it is discovered that a user has breached this rule, the User's account will be permanently closed and all their bets will be canceled. "I don't know where they found out that someone else used my account .. and incidentally as they say there they cancel all my winnings ... I mean ... they do not pay anything. I repeat that I sent many photos of me, of my ID, selfies with my ID, electricity bills, I put my real data, I came out on the Skype video call showing myself and my ID. With me, I have all the emails, photos of the account with my data, photos of the betting part, the recording of the video call of skype, a shame this bookmaker ... they are real scammers ... they only charge ... no They pay. ,,, I was researching on the internet and I found forums where sooooo many people denounce the same .. for example here in all languages https://es.trustpilot.com/review/www.bet2u.com?languages=all .... I forward all the mails and photos to the mail that you left me there Petronela, I hope you can help me.</p>
