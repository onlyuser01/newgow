    <h1>Diamond Jo Casino Hotel Casino Niagara Falls New York Usa Ocean Casino Nj Max Casino No Deposit Bonu</h1>

<p>Hello Team,</p>
<p>I have to share an update on my situation.</p>
<p>I informed the casino that I had raised a charge back request with my bank and the bank will block the amount and it won’t be usable by the receiver until further investigation. After hearing this the support rep mentioned that the funds will be added to wallet and me to withdraw the chargeback request. It is done now. I got the money in my wallet and I cancelled the charge back request with my bank. I am facing a different issue now while using said money that was added to my wallet.</p>
<p>The same money that was added to my wallet, I used it to bet on blackjack. The dealer on evolution table intentionally changed 3-4 cards burning cards mid hand and ended up changing those cards and dealing them to different players which were supposed to be dealt on my hands. long story short - 2 out of my 3 hands end up losing where it would have been high side bet payout hands if it were dealt accurately. I have raised a support ticket with the casino again (11577686-ticket number) I need that game video feed reviewed to undestand why the dealer changed the cards on my bets. Also, the dealer came in with no id and the pit allowed her by verifying the dealer over the PA system. All of this really sounds suspicious.</p>
<p>game details -</p>
<p>I was playing on 3 seats - 500 on main bets and 200 each of both sidebets (21+3 and pp) total bet of 2700 INR. Table name - Classic speed blackjack 22 table - game # Game number 11:49:39. (10/jan/2024)</p>
<p>All of this happens after I get my money added by escalating to such an extent, and that money was destined to be lost in bets. somehow I smell foul play. I really don’t know why those cards were changed and all of this happened on the live play and happend so fast I couldn’t compose myself to be able to record the screen at that instance.</p>
<p>is this something that can be investigated and can video feed from evolution gaming be obtained as proof of manipulation. Please help me and several other players who have been affected like me.</p>
<p>if you happen to need more details, please do let me know I would be happy to explain.</p>
<p>Warm regards,</p>
<p>Pavan</p>
