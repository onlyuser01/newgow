<p>The current agreement makes Casino Time the fifth Ontario operator to be powered by Gaming Innovation Group</p>
<p>Gaming Innovation Group (GiG), an iGaming company offering cloud-based product and platform services and performance marketing to its B2B partners, announced that it has completed an Ontario-oriented agreement with the local operator Casino Time.</p>
<p>GiG Pens Deal</p>
<p>The completion of this deal follows a Head of Terms agreement announced on November 30 last year. As previously discussed, GiG will provide its new Canadian partner with its award-winning platform, sportsbook and omnichannel solution.</p>
<p>Under the agreement, the brand should go live in the second quarter of 2023, making Casino Time the fifth regional operator to be powered by GiG. The supplier has been making impressive strides in Ontario ever since securing a license from the Alcohol and Gambling Commission of Ontario in July 2022.</p>
<p>Although not the first supplier to hit Ontario’s fresh iGaming market, GiG has quickly cemented itself as one of the most successful ones. The company’s commitment to using best-in-class technology in key functional areas, including player account management, trading and risk management and automated marketing has helped it find many new partners.</p>
<p>GiG’s reliability is something that many companies appreciate, which is why the supplier now has an extensive online and retail reach in the Canadian province.</p>
<p>Casino Time Thrilled to Go Online</p>
<p>Casino Time is a fresh joint venture of retail companies in Ontario’s Charitable Gaming sector. The charity model the brand uses, already popular among local retail players, will now be extended to the iGaming sector for the first time.</p>
<p>Casino Time’s chief executive officer and founder, D’Arcy Stuart, commented on the company’s planned online launch. He thanked the Ontario charities for their continuous support of his company and promised to create engaging experiences for the customers. As stated by Stuart, the company’s plans are to offer online bingo, slots, sports betting and live casino games to local customers.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Marcel Elfersy, Gaming Innovation Group’s chief commercial officer, said that his team is happy to support Casino Time and help the company make a foray into iGaming.</p>
<p>Combined with our commitment to expansion in complex regulated markets globally, we’re demonstrating that we are well positioned to power the needs and aspirations of land-based operators looking to enter the online space. Marcel Elfersy, CCO, GiG</p>
<p>GiG has been actively signing agreements with new partners. In January, the company announced two notable Europe-oriented Head of Terms arrangements. The first of them will establish a partnership between the supplier and a famous European land-based operator, while the second one will see GiG enter Swiss iGaming with an undisclosed company. The latter agreement was just confirmed by GiG.</p>
