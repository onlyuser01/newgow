<p>Spirits are High in Fiorentina’s Locker Room</p>
<p>Even though Fiorentina finished eighth in the Italian Serie A, its players have every right to feel good about themselves. They’ve improved their form just in time for the 2023 Europa Conference League Final.</p>
<p>They’re coming off back-to-back wins in Serie A, which saw them beat AS Roma 2-1 at home and Sassuolo 3-1 on the road. In both of those games, Fiorentina’s players showed real will and determination to win, scoring all of their goals in the second half, with four of those happening very late in the game.</p>
<p>Another interesting fact is that each of those goals was scored by a different player, showing that “Viola” functions as a true collective. Fiorentina is a great example of a team that’s more than the sum of its parts. Unfortunately for the Italian club, the fact is that the player quality is on the side of West Ham.</p>
<p>Some West Ham Stars Set to Shine on Wednesday</p>
<p>This hasn’t been the best season in the history of West Ham, but the Hammers still have a chance to make it memorable. They’ve got a chance to win their first trophy since 2000 when they won the now-defunct Intertoto Cup.</p>
<p>So, can they pull it off? Even though their recent form hasn’t been too impressive, the Hammers do have a fantastic roster with a couple of world-class players. Midfielder Declan Rice definitely belongs to this category. He’s an all-rounder who’s equally good on offense and defense.</p>
<p>When it comes to the Europa Conference League, West Ham’s standout player is Michail Antonio who’s scored seven goals in 10 games so far. It’s very likely he’ll feature in Wednesday’s game, mainly because another high-scoring West Ham attacker, Gianluca Scamacca, is out with an injury.</p>
<p>Fiorentina vs West Ham Europa Conference League Prediction</p>
<p>West Ham is the better team, but this is the final of the 2023 Europa Conference League, which is the most important game of the season for both teams. Fiorentina’s players are going to give their utmost, the result of which is that we could see the game go to extra time.</p>
<p>Pick: Fiorentina and West Ham to draw in regular time</p>
