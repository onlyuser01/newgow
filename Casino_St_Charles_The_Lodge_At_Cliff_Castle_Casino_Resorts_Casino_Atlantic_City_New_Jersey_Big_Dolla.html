<p>Although May was a busy month for licensees in Nevada, the reported gaming win could not surpass the result from May 2022</p>
<p>The gambling regulator in Nevada, the Nevada Gaming Control Board (NGCB), released its latest report, outlining the performance of nonrestricted gambling licensees during May. Judging by the recent report, last month marked another busy period for the licensees with their total gaming win hitting $1,289,036,827. The result marks another month with gaming win surpassing the billion-dollar mark. Moreover, the latest result gets the state closer to 30 consecutive months with revenue surpassing $1 billion.</p>
<p>Although last month was a busy period for gambling operators in the state, the result did not surpass the figures reported in May last year. Last year, the total gaming win reported by licensees in Nevada hit $1,300,009,088. A comparison to last month’s result shows that this year, the total gaming win decreased slightly by 0.84%.</p>
<p>Still, a fiscal year-to-date comparison shows an increase in the gaming win. For the fiscal year through May 2022, the total gaming win in Nevada was $13.4 billion. In contrast, for the corresponding period through May this year, the total gaming win hit $13,859,965,391, representing a growth of 3.80%.</p>
<p>A comparison of the collected taxes and fees in May shows a slight decrease when compared to the same period in 2022. This year, in May, Nevada collected a total of $84,267,252 in percentage fees. When compared to the $85.7 million collected in May 2022, this year, a decrease of 1.69% or $1,448,242 is observed.</p>
<p>Las Vegas Strip Posts the Highest Gaming Win in May</p>
<p>A breakdown of the $1.29 billion in total win reveals that the lion’s share was reported by Clark County. This isn’t surprising, considering that the County is the home to the gambling capital of the world, the Las Vegas Strip. Not unexpectedly, out of the different County regions, the Strip reported the highest gaming win of $1.12 billion. Yet, a year-over-year comparison to the result in May shows a decrease of just above 2%.</p>
<p>Downtown operators reported $73.7 million in gaming win last month, representing a 6.60% decrease when compared to May last year, while operators in North Las Vegas reported a gaming win decrease of nearly 5% to $24.2 million. Laughlin operators’ gaming win last month increased slightly by 0.58% to $47 million, while Boulder Strip operators’ gaming win increased by 1.49% to $89.8 million.</p>
<p>Washoe County, on the other hand, saw an increase of nearly 4% in its total gaming win last month to $90.8 million, while South Lake Tahoe operators reported an 11.27% increase in gaming win last month to $19.5 million. In contrast, Elko County operators reported a 10.81% decrease in total gaming win to $32.3 million last month.</p>
