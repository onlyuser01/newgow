<p>CT Interactive continues to march forward in European and global markets, with the prominent supplier of casino games negotiating yet another important deal in the Italian iGaming market. Thanks to its recent recertification in the jurisdiction, CT Interactive will continue to provide its distinct selection of games, and specifically its Hot Luck Jackpot product.</p>
<p>Now, the company has teamed up with The Ear, a platform that provides the leading online casinos all over Italy with various solutions and, moving forward, with the option to also introduce CT Interactive games to their offers. The supplier has created a number of excellent games that have become player-favorites over the years and have been a popular choice for many new and veteran players in iGaming.</p>
<p>Doctor Winstein, Monkey Kingdom, Clover Gems, Win Storm, and Fire Egg are just some of the options that players can play by the studio and enjoy excellent gameplay mechanics, interesting plots, many bonus features and symbols, and more. CT Interactive presently offers more than 200 games, holds18 licenses and certifications and is live with over 1,500 casinos.</p>
<p>Commenting on the latest opportunity for the company, CT Interactive Head of Business Development EMEA Milena Tsankarska said that The Ear is a prominent figure in the Italian iGaming market with more than 20 years in the iGaming world. She welcomed the opportunity to see CT Interactive thicken its ties and presence in the Italian market and said:</p>
<p>"For us, it is amazing that a company with such a long history chooses us as a partner who will contribute to the fulfilment of their goal – the best possible products for the Italian audience."</p>
<p>The Ear was similarly pleased to be adding CT Interactive and enhancing its own portfolio with the prominent supplier’s products. In a statement released by The Ear, the company said it could see why CT Interactive had been the recipient of so many awards in the industry. CT Interactive has been actively looking to expand its footprint, too.</p>
<p>The supplier has recently collaborated with SpinOro, an aggregation platform, to further boost its reach and connect with new audiences, partners, and players. The SpinOro partnership was signed in mid-May and it follows dozens of similar tie-ups since the beginning of the year where CT Interactive has sought to boost its reach.</p>
