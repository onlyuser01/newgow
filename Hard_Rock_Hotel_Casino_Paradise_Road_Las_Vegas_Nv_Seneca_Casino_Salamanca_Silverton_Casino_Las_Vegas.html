<p>The 5’ 3’’ mother of two allegedly assaulted her 6’ 6’’ partner, professional volleyball player Bobby Jacobs, in front of hotel security, who immediately called the police.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Stanton broke her silence via her PR team in a statement to US Weekly. She claimed she was “embarrassed and ashamed this happened” and apologized to hotel security and the Las Vegas Metro Police Department.</p>
<p>“Amanda is a gentle, respectful person who has never gotten physical with anyone under any circumstance. That evening she had a few drinks at a bachelorette party and when hotel security asked her and Bobby to quiet down, she got a bit rambunctious,” the statement said, while also describing the assault as “what [Stanton] thought was a playful shove.</p>
<p>“Despite Bobby explaining this was not an ill-intended shove, the police still had to do their job which Amanda completely respects and understands,” added the spokesperson.</p>
<p>Serious Potential Fallout</p>
<p>Las Vegas Metro said officers responded to a battery domestic violence call at approximately 3:15 a.m. Upon their arrival at the hotel room, another “physical altercation” allegedly took place between Stanton and Jacobs in front of police officers.</p>
<p>Stanton was arrested, transported to Clark County Detention Center, and later released. TMZ reports that the couple are still happily together and believe something may have been “slipped into her drink” during the party.</p>
<p>Domestic battery is really taken very seriously in Nevada so if convicted, Amanda could face up to six months in jail and $1,000 in fines,” Las Vegas Criminal Defense Attorney Cristina Hinds told Hollywood Life.</p>
<p>“She could also be required to attend six months of court-mandated classes. The problem is that if Amanda lives in Southern California, then she would have to travel back to Nevada every weekend to attend these classes,” Hinds added.</p>
<p>Concerned for Kids</p>
<p>Stanton finished fourth on Season 20 of ABC’s The Bachelor, before returning for the spin-off, Bachelor in Paradise, which she won. She became engaged to bachelor Josh Murray after the show, but they broke off their engagement in December 2016.</p>
<p>Murray took to Twitter on Tuesday to say he took no pleasure from the news of his ex-fiancée’s arrest, and was worried about her children.</p>
<p>“[I’m] sad actually, and concerned for the little ones like I’ve always been, not worried about all my scars — I hope she’ll get better for them, she can do it,” the former Bachelor wrote.</p>
