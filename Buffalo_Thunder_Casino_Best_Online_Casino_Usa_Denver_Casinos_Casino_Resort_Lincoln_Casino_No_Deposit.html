<p>The leading sports betting operator and globally recognized brand, William Hill, has announced a new partnership with Aston Villa Football Club, the famous professional football club from Aston, Birmingham, England. Under the terms of the new partnership, the leading sports betting brand was recognized as the football club's official in-stadium betting partner.</p>
<p>Thanks to the new deal, Aston Villa fans as well as sports fans will have the option to access unique engagement opportunities. The new collaboration will see William Hill bring different promotions and exclusive prizes. Moreover, Aston Villa fans will have the chance to get unique club merchandise as well as tickets and other offers.</p>
<p>The recent deal further expands William Hill's continuously growing presence. In fact, via the collaboration with Aston Villa, the famous brand will introduce betting facilities at Villa Park stadium, the home of the famous football club. This will deliver new and engaging match day experiences for sports fans and fans of the club.</p>
<p>Aston Villa's collaboration with William Hill will revolve over the two upcoming seasons. Still, the duo hasn't ruled out the possibility to extend their collaboration further in the future.</p>
<p>In a statement received via email, Nicola Ibbetson, Aston Villa Football Club's Chief Commercial Officer, shared her excitement. "William Hill are an industry leader, so we are naturally delighted to be welcoming them into Villa Park," she explained. Finally, Ibbetson said: "As one of the world's leading sports betting brands, their retail betting offering is set to enhance the matchday experience for Villa fans."</p>
<p>William Hill's Director of Media and UK Creative, Liam McKee, was also excited about the new collaboration. He said: "We're thrilled to be teaming up with Aston Villa and to be delivering our unrivaled retail betting experience, along with some exciting offers and opportunities, to Villa supporters."</p>
<p>In conclusion, McKee pointed out: "You can always count on Villa Park to provide a unique atmosphere and we look forward to adding to fans' matchday experience over the next two seasons."</p>
<p>Sports betting operators joining forces with football clubs isn't a new trend. In fact, only recently, William Hill announced a deal with Celtic FC. Similar to the deal with Aston Villa, the company confirmed it will deliver promotions, exclusive offers, as well as engaging experiences for Celtic's fans.</p>
<p>The partnerships come at a time when Britain is planning changes to its gambling regulations. Although the review of the Gambling Act was launched two years ago, it is yet to be finalized and has so far surpassed multiple deadlines. Club sponsorships with gambling operators are one of the changes that may be implemented but nothing cannot be confirmed until the government publishes the outcome of the review.</p>
