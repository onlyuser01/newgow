<p>Barcelona vs. Cadiz CF is played on Sunday, August 20, at Estadi Olimpic Lluis Companys. This is going to be the first time Barca is using this stadium as its home venue</p>
<p>Defending La Liga champion FC Barcelona started the 2023-24 season with a disappointing draw with Getafe on the road. A week later, Barca is playing its first-ever home game at Estadi Olimpic Lluis Companys at Montjuic Hill. This venue will serve as the replacement for Camp Nou while Europe’s largest soccer stadium undergoes reconstruction.</p>
<p>The stadium was built almost a century ago when the city of Barcelona was preparing for the Expo 1929. In the past, it served as the home venue for Barca’s city-rival Espanyol, meaning that these guys have played there many times in the past. However, they have never before been the home side at this stadium. Will their first game on Montjuic be successful?</p>

<p>Barcelona Needs a Win on Saturday</p>
<p>Barcelona is the reigning champion of La Liga, but defending the title is never easy. Plus, some of its main rivals (Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid) started the 2023-24 campaign in top gear. Barcelona did not do the same. Instead, the champs drew 0-0 with Getafe on the road in the opening round.</p>
<p>They were the dominant side in that game, keeping the ball in their possession for 75% of the time. They also made 14 goal attempts (in comparison, Getafe made only five), but none of those went in. What this practically means is that they were great in the midfield, but their forwards just weren’t precise enough.</p>
<p>Truth be told, Barca did play with 10 men on the pitch after Raphinha got red-carded. One of Getafe’s men also got sent off some 15 minutes later, so the two were level again. Speaking of red cards, Barca’s manager Xavi also got one, which is why he will miss the game on Saturday. Instead, it’s his assistant Oscar Hernandez who will be in charge of Barca’s tactics against Cadiz CF.</p>
<p>Can Cadiz CF Stage an Upset at Montjuic?</p>
<p>Cadiz CF defeated Alaves in the first round of the 2023-24 La Liga, with the only goal in the game being scored by midfielder Fede San Emeterio in the seventh minute of the game. After scoring the goal, Cadiz CF players switched their focus to defense, letting the opposition have the ball.</p>
<p>This was particularly the case in the second half, in which Cadiz CF had the ball for only about 38% percent of the time, making no shots toward the opposition goal along the way. They did well defensively against Alaves, but can they do the same against the mighty Barca?</p>
<p>Barcelona vs. Cadiz CF Prediction</p>
<p>Barcelona is going to attack throughout this game; Cadiz CF is going to defend. So, which tactic will work out in the end? We think Barca’s, although we doubt this team will hammer Cadiz CF. Instead, a win by one or two goals difference seems like the most probable scenario.</p>
<p>Pick: Barcelona to win &amp; under 2.5 goals</p>
