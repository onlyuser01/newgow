    <h1>Admiral Casino Games Biz Login Casino Games Online Real Money Saratoga Casino Agua Caliente Casinos</h1>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I deposited €20 at this casino on 01/30/2022.</p>
<p>I then wanted to pay out €200 on January 31, 2022. Since the payout was not processed after 3 days, I canceled the payout and continued playing with the €200 and landed at €2222.81. I then wanted to pay out €2200 on February 4th, 2022 (€22.81 were then still available on the account).</p>
<p>Today, on February 11th, 2022, my account balance was reset to €200 and the payout was canceled on the grounds that the max cashout is 10x the deposit because of the bonus, see Terms and Conditions.</p>
<p>Problem is now, the whole page is in German except for the terms and conditions</p>
<p>(But I have read that this must be the case if the site is in German, there are court judgments about it or even their terms and conditions state that these are available in other languages, but there aren't any) and the matter with the 10x max cashout will also be discussed not at</p>
<ol>
<li>General Bonus Terms &amp; Conditions listed which I have read but are described at the bottom under Other Terms.</li>
</ol>
<p>I find it very misleading and confusing</p>
<p>If I had known that, I would not have taken a bonus or, like in other casinos, I would not have been shown with the bonus that by activating the bonus you accepted the bonus conditions.</p>
<p>When I asked in the chat, I was then cheekily answered that this decision is final and is not checked. Also, I cannot see in my account that I have claimed a bonus because it only lists a deposit of €20.</p>
<p>Of course I recorded everything with a screenshot.</p>
<p>I ask for your help to clarify</p>
