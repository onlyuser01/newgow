<p>Hi, I just went through your complaint and I must say that I've read about a similar case many times. You can look at it from 2 angles: The first one is the one you mentioned - you asked the casino to close your account until the withdrawal is processed so they should do what you asked them for.</p>
<p>From the casino's perspective, they did nothing wrong. There's not such a rule that you need to keep the account closed whenever a player asks you to close the account until the withdrawal is processed. Would it be a great type of service? Of course! Is it obligatory for the casino? It isn't. The casino will simply say that it's your responsibility. You were the one who lost the money. They didn't force you to cancel the pending withdrawal...</p>
<p>There's another case that would completely change the situation. If you ask a casino to close your account, because of your issues with gambling, then they should close it without any possibility for reopening, but this isn't your case.</p>
<p>I'm thinking that your best option would probably be contacting AAMS since the casino is licensed in Italy. Many licensing authorities tend to protect the player in a way that they could decide that even if you asked the casino to reopen it, they shouldn't do it.</p>
<p>I understand Nick's decision - we can't punish the casino for doing something upon player's request and they didn't do anything controversial or predatory. They simply reopened your account when you asked for it. On the other hand, I believe that a great casino wouldn't allow you to reopen the account. I personally worked in a casino where you'd need to wait about a week for the reopening from the day when you asked for it. But that's not a standard behaviour. That's something extra that the casino does for its players to make them happier and to protect them.</p>
