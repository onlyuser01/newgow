<p>The Los Angeles Rams vs. Detroit Lions is a 2024 NFL Wild Card Round game that will take place at Ford Field on Sunday, January 14, with a primetime kickoff</p>
<p>The Los Angeles Rams vs. Detroit Lions 2024 Playoff game is a homecoming game for Matt Stafford. The Rams’ signal-caller is coming back to Ford Field for the first time since moving to LA in 2021 after spending 11 years in Detroit.</p>
<p>He probably won’t get a warm welcome from the Lions’ fans who have a new favorite – Jared Goff – who used to play for the Rams in the past. With his new team, Goff has been brilliant and is looking to take the Lions to the Divisional Playoffs for the first time since 1991. Will his former team crush his dream?</p>

<p>Los Angeles Rams Looking to Cash In On Their Good Form</p>
<p>The Rams finished the regular season on a 10-7 record, with seven of those wins happening in the final eight game weeks.</p>
<p>The only game they lost during that period was the one against the AFC No. 1 seed, the Baltimore Ravens, in a game played in Maryland. But the Ravens too struggled to beat them – they won only after overtime.</p>
<p>So, what have the Rams been doing well lately? They’ve been playing carefully on the offense, with QB Matt Stafford opting to make fewer risky passes than usual. The result is that in four of his last five games, he had zero interceptions.</p>
<p>We also saw him throw for well over 250 yards per game in most games this season. Even when his passes didn’t result in a touchdown, he still made it easy for placekickers to score field goals.</p>
<p>The Rams also did okay defensively, although there’s definitely room for improvement in this aspect. They’re among the top 10 worst teams in the NFL when it comes to opponent passing yards (231.1 allowed per game) and opponent passing TDs (1.4 conceded per game).</p>
<p>Is this something that should worry them ahead of the trip to Detroit? It definitely is! It’s because Dallas is the No. 3 team in the NFL in terms of passing yards.</p>
<p>Can Detroit Get to the Divisional Round for the First Time In 32 Years?</p>
<p>The Detroit Lions are favored to win on Sunday, with the bookies seeing them as 3-point favorites. The main reason is that the Lions were brilliant during the regular season. They won the NFC North Division, going 12-5 overall.</p>
<p>Their strongest weapon has been their passing game, with 258.6 passing yards on average. It’s no surprise given that their quarterback Jared Goff has been on form with his throws, recording a total of 30 touchdown passes.</p>
<p>Truth be told, he’s had a relatively easy job given that Detroit’s receivers have been sensational this season. Wide receivers Amon-Ra St. Brown and tight end Sam LaPorta scored 10 receiving TDs each, while another five players passed the end line at least once this season.</p>
<p>Apart from being good at passing, the Lions have also been dangerous running the ball, especially when David Montgomery or Jahmyr Gibbs get ahold of it.</p>
<p>Los Angeles Rams vs. Detroit Lions Prediction</p>
<p>This is one of the trickiest Wild Card Round games to predict as the Lions look more talented on paper, but the Rams have experience on their side. It’s really 50-50 if you’re asking us.</p>
<p>However, our Rams vs. Lions pick is going to be the Rams +3.0. The key reason for this is that these guys have been in brilliant form lately. They might not necessarily win, but we think they’re going to give the Lions a really hard time on Sunday.</p>
<p>Pick: Los Angeles Rams +3.0</p>
