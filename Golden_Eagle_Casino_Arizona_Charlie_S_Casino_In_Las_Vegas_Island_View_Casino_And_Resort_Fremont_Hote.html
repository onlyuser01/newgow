    <h1>Golden Eagle Casino Arizona Charlie S Casino In Las Vegas Island View Casino And Resort Fremont Hote</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I had opened an account on chips.gg a month ago and had been a regular player. I had deposited funds multiple times (30K+) and withdrew as well without any issue.</p>
<p>However, since 1-6 of November I have some large sum of deposit and withdrawal as I won good amount of slots and lost as well.</p>
<p>On 05th and 6th of Nov I won some bigger prizes. Initially I withdrew 10K from my winning and still kept 100$ in the account and later that day I deposited 2900$.</p>
<p>Later that night I won 6900$ and when I tried to withdraw the funds, I was getting an error saying that my withdrawal limit reached (even though their max withdrawal allowed per day is 50K$).</p>
<p>I waited out for next 24 hours since my last withdrawal and tried again and received same error message.</p>
<p>I went through their terms of service about withdrawal limit and it mentioned at certain cases they might request for KYC, so I went ahead and submitted my KYC as well.</p>
<p>Still there was no change. I also noticed that i was restricted from chatting in public chat on their website as well.</p>
<p>Finally I received response from one of their support team stating that my account has been restricted as their system flagged my account for multi account usage. I was surprised on this as I was only playing with my account. I said the same to them but they insisted that I was using multi accounts.</p>
<p>I later remembered that few days ago, I had forgotten password to my account and had ended up creating another account. But that was only for few hours and never used it again as I was able to retrieve my password from saved password log from my other device.</p>
<p>I have been playing with my actual account and never used that alternative account after that day, that is why I did not even recall it instantly when they pointed out about multi account flag.</p>
<p>What is interesting is that my temporary account I used was weeks ago and they never raised that concern or notified me about it earlier. Only when I won certain funds they went ahead and restricted my account. The didn't even restrict me from depositing the funds all through this time.</p>
<p>They said they are still investigating my case and have not given any final verdict but all this time my account remains restricted with very slow response from their team.</p>
<p>I would appreciate, if you can look into this and guide in resolving this concern.</p>
