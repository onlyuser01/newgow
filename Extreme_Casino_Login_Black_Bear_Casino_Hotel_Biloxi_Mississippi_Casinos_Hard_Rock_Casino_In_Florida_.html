    <h1>Extreme Casino Login Black Bear Casino Hotel Biloxi Mississippi Casinos Hard Rock Casino In Florida</h1>

<p>On 10/26/2022 I had a balance around $1600 and I played a slot called epic ape and I did a bunch of spins at $4 a spin. I ended up getting free spins and before they started I was at around $1450 and at the end of the free spins I was at around $2100. I did a spin after free spins and my balance went down to what it was before the free spins, around $1400. I didnt really understand what happened so I continued to spin and won free spins again. I won around $400 or $500 from free spins and when they finished I did a single spin and my free spins winnings were gone again. I left the game and went to the live chat and made a complaint, i was told there would be an investigation and it would be fixed %100 and not to worry. I left the chat and played a game called buffalo blitz and the same thing happened, I won free spins and won over $400 and when they finished I did 1 single spin and the free spins winnings were gone again. I reported it right away and this time I had a screenshot of the winnings and it disappearing. I was told this would be fixed and taken care of and not not worry, the chat operator told me not to play that game provider anymore which was playtech. It's been just almost 3 weeks and it still isnt resolved. The casino just keeps telling me they haven't gotten a response from the game provider. Something seems very shady here and I dont believe they are going to fix this. I did see this same thing happened to another player that posted on this website. Basically the casino took my winnings and and kept the bet money as well. So they only took my money and took away anything that was won.</p>
