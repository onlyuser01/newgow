<p>London-based betting platform with a passion for esports, sports, and gaming Midnite has beefed up its number of employees to 56 with the appointment of James McMath as the new head of communications.</p>
<p>Hunger for Growth</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the year, the ambitious company founded in 2018 by Dribble creators Wright and Daniel Qu added 35 fresh members to the team. Its fast crew expansion is explained through its effort to accelerate growth and “build a new era of wagering”. The entertainment platform “with epic ways to win for every type of fan” is ready to take its plans further. The $16 million raised during a series A fundraiser for Gen Z-focused esports betting apps was definitely an important stimulus for the company that exists “to bring fans together and enhance their interactions with their favorite games through the rush of winning money”.</p>
<p>Midnite is determined to continue to push boundaries and make excellent products that its users can enjoy in a responsible manner. The team is spread in all parts of the world, busy rethinking how things are done in the industry while placing fans and the community above everything else.</p>
<p>Luckbox Vet Expected to Support Midnite’s Goals</p>
<p>McMath spent the last four years as Luckbox’s head of communications as well as chief editor and media relations manager. In his new position at Midnite, he will be joining fellow Luckbox colleague Sujoy Roy, former director of esports between May 2018 and November 2019. Roy has been Midnite’s marketing director since April 2020 and he will be working together with McMath at scaling the revenue and user base of the website. McMath spoke about his appointment, expressing his delight to be joining the team at the “incredibly exciting time” as Midnite is still trying to become a critical player in the sports betting and esports industry. McMath is ready to bring his contribution to attracting fresh users and improving all proprietary products.</p>
<p>McMath is an experienced communications specialist with over two decades of experience under his belt working in journalism, public relations, investor relations, content creation, and editing. He has a proven track record of creating and applying corporate communication strategies, building traffic, and collaborating with stakeholders to boost company profiles.</p>
<p>Commenting on McMath’s appointment, Wright described it as “exciting times for our company”. He also expressed his thrill for having been able to “strengthen our team significantly as we aim to smash our growth goals for the year”.Midnite currently has a license issued by the Gambling Commission and it is pending approval from the Malta Gaming Authority. At the beginning of August, the regulator issued a notice of cancelation for DGV’s license because of a series of missed payments.</p>
