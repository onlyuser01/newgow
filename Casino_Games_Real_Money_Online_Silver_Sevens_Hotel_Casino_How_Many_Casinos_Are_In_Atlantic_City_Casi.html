    <h1>Casino Games Real Money Online Silver Sevens Hotel Casino How Many Casinos Are In Atlantic City Casi</h1>

<p>Pariplay, a NeoGames subsidiary and a leading aggregator and content provider, announced a new deal with the leading provider of premium casino games, Slotmill. The new collaboration sees Slotmill become the latest provider to join Pariplay's Ignite platform.</p>
<p>This further expands Pariplay's Ignite roster of partners while at the same time helping Slotmill tap into new markets. As an Ignite partner, the leading developer will benefit from scalable and easy access to markets where currently Pariplay operates.</p>
<p>What's more, Slotmill will also leverage the platform's global distribution network, creating further growth opportunities. The company will benefit from creating new games by using Pariplay's leading turnkey development framework.</p>
<p>While joining the Ignite platform will help the casino games provider expand its reach, it also complements its growth. In fact, by having Slotmill join Ignite, Pariplay further expands the number of leading developers available via its platform.</p>
<p>Johan Ohman, Slotmill's Founder, shared his excitement in a statement saying: "Pariplay's Ignite initiative gives studios the chance to focus on creating incredible content, which is something we pride ourselves on." He added: "The scope of our operations can be enhanced swiftly, as we can now take our content live in numerous regulated markets, allowing us to scale rapidly as we achieve success together."</p>
<p>Founded back in 2019, Slotmill is currently a premium provider of casino games for the iGaming industry. To ensure the success of its products, the company hired a roster of experts with solid industry backgrounds. Combining expert knowledge and technology, Slotmill's titles stand out with unique gaming features, quality graphics and engaging gameplay.</p>
<p>Slotmill is an MGA-licensed provider of casino games that focuses on delivering innovative titles. Currently, all of the games offered by the provider are backed by leading technology which delivers an unrivaled experience for online customers. All of Slotmill's games currently feature HD graphics and balanced mathematical models.</p>
<p>Callum Harris, Pariplay's Director of Partnerships, shared his excitement saying: "Expanding our Ignite program is an important goal for us, and we're delighted to welcome Slotmill into the fold." Last but not least, he revealed: "Its attention to detail, and focus on making immersive, lightweight games matches perfectly with our strategy, and we're confident they will be an excellent addition to our Ignite program."</p>
<p>The new collaboration comes after only recently, Pariplay announced a new exclusive deal with Reloaded Gaming. As a result, similarly to Slotmill, Reloaded Gaming joined the company's Ignite platform.</p>
<p>Before that, in November, the award-winning supplier and developer of slot games, Swintt, teamed up with Pariplay. Consequently, the leading developer joined Pariplay's aggregation platform Fusion.</p>
