<p>"IT’S ON," this is the message iGaming operator BetMGM is sending to audiences in its latest commercial campaign launched on Tuesday afternoon. The new campaign has reunited a respectable cast of starts, including the brand’s newest brand ambassador, Vanessa Hudgens, but the initiative also brings together Jalen Rose, Wayne Gretzky, Kevin Garnett, and Barry Sanders who will be happy to offer sports betting tips.</p>
<p>This campaign will reunite popular actors, athletes, and BetMGM’s own brand ambassadors who will participate in an episodic series, the press release informs. The first promotional material features a video with Jamie Foxx who roams around his Bellagio suite asking for sports betting advice from the aforementioned cast.</p>
<p>The campaign was developed by 72andSunny New York and it was directed by Peter Berg, known for his work on Ballers and Entourage. BetMGM VP of Brand Raymond Doyle welcomed this new opportunity and said that entertainment is at the very core of what BetMGM does. He added:</p>
<p>"We want this campaign to keep viewers on the edge of their seats in a way that's unexpected from the sports betting and gaming industry." Peter Hughes, the Creative Director at 72andSunny, also welcomed the opportunity to be shooting this campaign with BETMGM.</p>
<p>"IT’S ON" is about tapping your competitive side," he said. He explained that the idea of the first commercial was to demonstrate that you can have a meaningful conversation about sports betting with friends. The campaign is set to appear across broadcast, social channels, digital and OOH, the company confirmed in the press release.</p>
<p>Participants though will also seek to amplify the message using their own social reach and media following to make sure that they drive the BetMGM’s "IT’S ON" message home. There will be more video and promotional materials forthcoming throughout the year, as the campaign will focus on the beginning of the NBA, NHL, and NCAA tournaments as time get on.</p>
<p>The campaign has been launched with the idea that BetMGM is an entity that is fully committed to responsible gambling and education. BetMGM joined the American Gaming Association earlier this month to support Responsible Gambling Education Month. One of the best ways to address responsible gambling is to ensure that all members of staff are trained and aware of the best practices on this sensitive topic.</p>
