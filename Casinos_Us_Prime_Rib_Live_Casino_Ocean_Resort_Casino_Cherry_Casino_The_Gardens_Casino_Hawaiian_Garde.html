<p>Irish Luck review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Leaning heavily on vaguely problematic stereotypes about Guiness and leprechauns, Irish Luck is an Ireland-themed slot that focuses on the myths and legends of the islands.</p>
<p>Four-leaf clovers abound along with rainbows and fairy folk who haunt the remnants of ruined castles on the reel.</p>
<p>It’s a bright, light, and colourful setting. But one which feels very derivative and somewhat overdone.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The graphics are a little bit kitsch. The artwork feels like it was pulled from an illustrated storybook published in the 90s and the background is a rather bland looking child’s drawing of a landscape with a rainbow.</p>
<p>The animations are simple and the sound effects even simpler.</p>
<p>There is no background music, and no spin sounds. There are a few sound effects when a bonus symbol lands or a win occurs, but on the whole the slot lacks the atmosphere that even a basic soundtrack would lend it.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Irish Luck is played on a five reel grid with three rows. There are twenty-five win lines and a double or nothing gamble feature, which can be played at the end of any winning spin.</p>
<p>This is all pretty basic, but solid stuff. It won’t enchant players who are looking for something exotic. But if you like the basic slot format, this won’t disappoint.</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Leprechaun Scatter and the Fairy Scatter symbols.</p>
<p>There are two Bonus Games.</p>
<p>Three or more Leprechaun Scatter symbols trigger a picking game. Players receive one pick for each Scatter they trigger the bonus with. Each pick reveals either a fairy or a leprechaun.</p>
<p>Fairies award a multiple of the player’s bet. Leprechaun’s award ten free spins. During any free spins the player wins, the payouts are doubled as compared to the base game.</p>
<p>Landing three or more Fairy Scatters trigger another picking game. In this one, the player is presented with clover leaves. Each leaf has a symbol under it. The player turns over clover leaves until they make a matching pair of symbols. The player then receives a payout that is linked to the symbol they match.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 95.0%, which means players are decidedly short on luck for this game. Our yardstick for average is roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.01 up to a maximum of $/£/€15.00 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is high, which would make it a great match for our preferred slot machine strategies if the RPT were higher. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Irish Luck is a bit of a lame duck. It’s graphics feel cheap and derivative. No effort has been made in the animation or sound departments.</p>
<p>Nor have the team behind the scenes done a thing to make the game appeal. We like the high volatility, but it is paired with such a terrible RTP that it makes no difference.</p>
<p>The real luck of the Irish would prevent you from ever having to play this slot.</p>
