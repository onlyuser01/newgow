    <h1>Terre Haute Casino Golden Nugget Online Casino Pa Chandler Casino Clearwater Casino Lewiston Blue Ch</h1>

<p>Ok well thank you for all your help..what I don't understand is that I did not make multiple accounts with the same casino but their sister branches I did but I was referred by their chat to do so so I don't understand how is that in the wrong if they were telling me to do so in their chat and I don't know what other casinos they're connected to so it makes it hard for me not to know which casinos to sign up with and not if they're all connected and one way or another.. I would say that I made accounts with almost every casino that's on the US branch and I lost the phone that had all my information stored in it with all the casinos in my history with all of them having my passwords and username saved for easy login.and after losing my phone I had a couple of unauthorized transactions on some of my credit cards in the past that was more than 4 months ago but two different bank cards but I addressed that issue with the bank and took care of that but so far doesn't look like whoever found my phone has access to any more of my credit information other than all the stored pictures and stuff that I had in there my logins to my emails which I just recently changed like 3 weeks ago.so whoever has my phone shouldn't have access to anything else I believe but I don't think there would be making any extra accounts on the casino online without my knowledge cuz if they were it would show up under my email which they had access to before I change the password and I haven't seen any other accounts made under those emails. And it's ridiculous how this casinos expect you to take photos of your ID credit cards yourself holding your ID to send them verification for withdrawing but then later on all that is saved in my phone and when I lost it people had access to all that whoever found the phone at least which is kind of bad on my part because that is all my personal information and who knows what people could do with that. But since then after having a few unauthorized charges on two of my different bank cards I close those cards out and got new ones since then and haven't had any unauthorized charges since because whoever has my phone does not have my new credit card information. But like I said again I highly doubt it would try to be making new casino accounts using my information so the only thing I could guess that Drake casino is saying about multiple accounts is because I have an account with their sister branch VIP slots and gossip slots which I was recommended by their live chat to also join and check out what they have to offer so if that was a breach of their terms and conditions that was just a setup by them to be able to say I have multiple accounts and confiscate my winnings which is not cool at all makes me feel that I can't play any online casino cuz if one or the others connected they're going to try to say that I have multiple accounts and it makes me feel that I shouldn't open up any accounts with any casino because that might just be the case in the future where they say I have multiple accounts with their sister branches or their brand branches and they're just going to confiscate my winnings every time am I right?</p>
