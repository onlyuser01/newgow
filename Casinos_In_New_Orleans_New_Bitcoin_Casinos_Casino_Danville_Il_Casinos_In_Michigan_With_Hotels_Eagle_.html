<p>SoftSwiss is expanding its operations once more with the company receiving an official manufacturer stability license from the Hellenic Gaming Commission (HGC).</p>
<p>Effectively, the company is expanding its reach in European markets, with Greece as the target country. The A.1 Category license is there to allow the company to deliver its dedicated suite of B2B gambling services to partners in the country.</p>
<p>Expanding Coverage and Offering in Greece</p>
<p>This includes the aggregation platform powered by SoftSwiss. As per the license negotiation, SoftSwiss would be able to provide content in the next seven years from 12 approved studios, out of 170 studios currently available through the aggregation platform. SoftSwiss will only be authorized to push its products with recognized brands in the Greek market.</p>
<p>Commenting on these developments, SoftSwiss COO Andrey Starovoitov argued that the company had worked long and hard to ensure that it would qualify for a market entry. The B2B license would allow the SoftSwiss Game Aggregator to take off and bring much-needed experience and content to local operators and their players.</p>
<p>“Obtaining a Greek gaming license was the result of SoftSwiss’ long and hard work, which over the years has accumulated extensive experience and understanding of the iGaming market. Recognizing the needs of our clients, we are constantly moving towards development and finding new solutions.” SoftSwiss COO Andrey Starovoitov</p>
<p>The company was approved to begin delivering its products in the Greek market earlier this year. SoftSwiss’ ambitious breadth of operation has pushed the total number of employees in the company to over 1,000, making for a truly remarkable feat.</p>
<p>As of the time of reporting, SoftSwiss had been able to launch 59 online casinos in the three years previous, with over six billion bets handled monthly, and close to $400 million worth of transactions handled monthly. SoftSwiss is also a self-styled leader in the crypto gaming space.</p>
<p>The company has just signed a new studio to its aggregation platform with Hölle Games joining the list of suppliers. This makes for a total of 20 new suppliers that have been added over the past year.</p>
