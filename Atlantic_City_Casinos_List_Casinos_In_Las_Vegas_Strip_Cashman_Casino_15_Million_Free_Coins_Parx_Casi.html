    <h1>Atlantic City Casinos List Casinos In Las Vegas Strip Cashman Casino 15 Million Free Coins Parx Casi</h1>

<p>William Hill has been offering its players a taste of a new online casino experience since January 6, 2022, after the first of five popular titles from Real Dealer Studios launched with the gaming group.</p>
<p>Quality Content and Immersive Gameplay</p>
<p>The first title under the partnership deal between William Hill and Real Dealer Studios is bringing the cinema-quality content and immersive one-on-one gameplay of the game developer’s studio to new audiences across core William Hill and Mr Green casino brands.</p>
<p>“William Hill Group are delighted to partner with Real Dealer Studios to expand our portfolio of top content for customers and we’re very much looking forward to debuting their games on our network in the coming weeks.” Richard Atkinson, Global Head of Live Casino, William Hill Group</p>
<p>In January and February, a total of five game titles, Real Roulette with Sarati, Real Baccarat with Courtney, Real Fortune Finder with Holly, Real Auto Roulette, and Multifire Auto Roulette from Real Dealer Studios’ catalog, will be rolled out across both brands. Customers in the .com and .uk markets will have the privilege to be the first to taste the new gaming content.</p>
<p>“William Hill and Mr Green are both sites with a huge market presence in the UK and beyond. By teaming up with them, we’ll be able to further strengthen the Real Dealer brand by sharing a selection of top titles with a new audience who might not yet be familiar with our unique way of doing things.” Shane Cotter, Chief Product Officer, Real Dealer Studios</p>
<p>Best known for its games that feature professional actors in the role of the dealer, Real Dealer Studios’ games allow for a country-specific choice of dealer characters and introduce a new level of player engagement via fully localized gaming content relevant in each market.</p>
<p>Real Dealer Studios’ “auto” content features pre-recorded videos of gameplay that was captured in the developer’s studio to avoid the typical of Live Casino products noise and delay and provide premium video and audio to simulate a more personalized casino experience for the players.</p>
<p>“2021 was an incredibly successful year for Real Dealer Studios and we’re really happy to be carrying that momentum into 2022 by announcing our new partnership with the William Hill Group,” Cotter added.</p>
<p>William Hill’s acquisition saga is set to end soon after 888 Holdings expressed confidence earlier in the month the ongoing acquisition of non-US assets of William Hill is continuing as planned and the transaction will close in the second quarter of 2022.</p>
<p>The deal with the Gibraltar-based group followed the acquisition of William Hill by US casino giant Caesars Entertainment in 2020 and its decision to offload the brand’s operations and assets outside of the US.</p>
