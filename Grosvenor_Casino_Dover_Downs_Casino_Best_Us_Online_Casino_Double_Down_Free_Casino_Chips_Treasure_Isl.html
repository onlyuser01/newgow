<p>Monday, Evolution Gaming announced that it went live with three dedicated, brand-branded live casino tables for win2day. This online gaming platform is operated by Osterreichische Lotterien Gesellschaft GmbH m.b.H, holders of an exclusive license to conduct electronic lotteries throughout Austria.</p>
<p>Evolution and win2day developed the win2day-branded live dealers environment through their standing partnership. It features two Blackjack and Roulette tables. Evolution has been Austrian Lotteries' only live casino provider for many years. This agreement provides Evolution-powered live games such as Lightning Roulette or Immersive Roulette, which is available in both desktop and portable formats.</p>
<p>Evolution brands NetEnt and Red Tiger provide some of the online casino slots games to win2day.</p>
<p>Patrick Kittl, Product Manager Casino Games/win2day at Austrian Lotteries, gave an official statement about the new products. He stated, "At Austrian Lotteries our philosophy is to act responsibly, to always look to introduce innovation to better entertain our players, and to work in partnership. In Evolution, we have a partner that helps us to fulfill all of these commitments through their world-class portfolio of products. We are very excited to be extending our live casino offering with these new tables, developed and branded specifically for win2day players."</p>
<p>Evolution's Head of Business Development James Jones explained that win2day provides a wide range of classic lotteries, casino games and bingo games along with sports betting opportunities through one website. He added that the company is proud of the ongoing collaboration with win2day to provide more options to players. The new dedicated tables offer win2day " exceptional flexibility" in how their brand is represented online and how they engage their players.</p>
<p>Evolution has been expanding rapidly as 2021 draws to a close. A week ago, It announced the launch of its leading live casino games portfolio in Argentina's newly regulated online gambling market in the Buenos Aires Province. Evolution was the only live casino provider that went live in the new market on the first day.</p>
<p>Evolution is live with leading operator BetWarrior with an extensive range of world-class Evolution live dealer games available at www.betwarrior.bet.ar. The company's First-Person game range and over 100 online slots by NetEnt or Red Tiger extend the options. Evolution will also be joining other operators over the next few weeks. Operators will soon have access to additional live games from Ezugi, another Evolution brand.</p>
<p>The regulated online casino market is also operated by the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, in addition to the recently regulated Buenos Aires Province. The market currently features RNG games, including titles from Evolution's First Person line and NetEnt slots. Live gaming will soon be available in this market when regulations are in place.</p>
