<p>this is the chat between me and bitspinwin as they have continually denied m6 req7est to update my phone number in order to withdrawal my winnings because the ID i currently have has a different expiration date then the one used when registering with the website however its IS STILL A VALID FORM OF ID AND WAS USED TO UPDATE MY PHONE NUMBER MAYBE LESS THAN A MONTH AGO AND WAS GIVEN NO PROBLEMS, have more than cooperated sending them pictures of the ID separately from the pictures submitted of me holding up that same ID as well as reaching out to them via by email through their virtual chat on their app and by phone and still they keep singing the same old tune I want my money and I want my account deleted and I will never again bother with anything that has to do with my money online ever again:</p>
<p>I spoke with customer service via phone call and inform them I do not have the 2027 ID and did not know I had two different IDs with two different expiration dates and as it stands the one that I have is not expired and is valid I've submitted a picture of that ID separately from the photos I submitted of me holding that same ID up verifying my identity multiple times I am tired of begging you motherfuckers to change my phone number so I can get my money and delete my account and will be figuring out a way to submit a complaint and have it handled accordingly you guys are f<strong>*</strong>g garbage</p>
<p>the lady on the phone says she would be informing the team and apparently she didn't even f<strong><em>*</em>g do that because you guys keep singing the same old tune it's a valid f</strong><strong><em>g ID it shouldn't matter about the expiration dates when I registered with whatever ID I registered with eventually everybody's IDs are going to expire from the ones that was used when registering with the website and when that happens what are you going to do play this f</em></strong><strong>g same game with them? you're a f</strong>***g scam</p>
