<p>DAZN Bet’s platform will feature an extensive selection of safer gambling tools, allowing players to regulate their gambling behavior</p>
<p>DAZN Bet, DAZN’s sports betting division, has made a foray into Germany’s online betting market. Having secured a license from the Joint Gambling Authority of the Federal States (GGL), the brand will now offer betting products to sports aficionados in the country.</p>
<p>This confirms earlier rumors that claimed DAZN Bet had secured a license from the German regulator.</p>
<p>A joint venture by the sports media giant DAZN and Pragmatic Group, DAZN Bet is a fast-growing betting operator that seeks to engage fans with premium sports betting content. The betting platform’s expansion is in line with DAZN’s ambition to solidify its position as a powerhouse in the sports entertainment sector.</p>
<p>Starting mid-September, German consumers will be able to access DAZN Bet through DAZN’s official platform. Customers will be able to place wagers on their favorite teams and events across numerous professional sporting leagues. However, they would need a separate DAZN Bet account to play.</p>
<p>As an ever-evolving platform, DAZN will continue to enhance DAZN Bet with new products and markets as it seeks to “meet the needs and interests of consumers.” The company is bullish on offering premium sports entertainment to German audiences, enhancing the enjoyment of local fans.</p>
<p>DAZN Bet Is Committed to Offering Betting Responsibly</p>
<p>DAZN Bet is effectively the latest sportsbook to appear on Germany’s whitelist for sports betting operators. As a company entering Germany’s highly regulated market, DAZN Bet expressed its desire to cooperate with the German regulator and offer fair and safe gambling experiences.</p>
<p>To that end, DAZN Bet’s platform will feature an extensive selection of safer gambling tools, allowing players to regulate their gambling behavior. Customers will also be able to access information on safe betting, further protecting them from harmful gambling.</p>
<p>In addition to these tools, DAZN Bet will employ robust technology that identifies and addresses problem gambling behavior.</p>
<p>DAZN Bet’s managing director for DACH, Gabriel Vollmann, commented on the launch. He explained that DAZN Bet is an offer to DAZN users who wish to take their sports engagement a step further and fully immerse themselves in the action. Vollmann reiterated his team’s commitment to responsible gambling:</p>
<p>The close cooperation with the German authorities and the brand partnership with DAZN, reflect our commitment to be a safe provider in a regulated market where the player’s enjoyment is at the center. Gabriel Vollmann, MD DACH, DAZN Bet</p>
<p>In August, DAZN Bet secured the rights to stream every game from the Saudi Pro League to viewers in the United Kingdom.</p>
