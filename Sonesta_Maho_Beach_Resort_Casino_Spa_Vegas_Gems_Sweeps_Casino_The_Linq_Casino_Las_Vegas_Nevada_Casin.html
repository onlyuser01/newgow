<p>The company hopes its group of industry experts will help it adapt to growing regulatory complexities, significantly bolstering partnering businesses</p>
<p>Vixio, a global leader in regulatory intelligence services, has convened its inaugural Executive Advisory Board, bolstering its PaymentsCompliance product while providing cutting-edge regulatory insights to stakeholders within the payments sector. The company’s innovation-focused mindset and insights into the latest regulatory developments should substantially bolster its attractiveness and attract new partnerships.</p>
<p>Industry Veterans Will Pool Their Knowledge and Expertise</p>
<p>The new board comprises ten experts across payments and compliance disciplines. Roseanne Spagnuolo, Vixio’s chief product officer (CPO), will lead these industry veterans. The company hopes the board will offer diverse perspectives on the evolving market intelligence requirements of legal and compliance professionals, strategic development leaders, and executives engaged in regulatory and government affairs.</p>
<p>Vixio CEO Mike Woolfrey highlighted the company’s steadfast reputation and reliable, value-driven services, noting that the Executive Advisory Board represented a significant milestone in its mission to deliver the best possible experience to its growing customer base. He added that the new initiative would answer the increasingly complex regulatory challenges, elevating Vixio above the competition.</p>

<p>The board’s founding members represent leaders from distinguished financial and technology companies. Notable names include Jana Breitkopf from Mercedes Pay USA, Georg von Brevern from SumUp, Amy Brobow from Mastercard, Sylvie Calsacy from Worldline, and Nikki Eagers from Elavon / US Bank. The advisory board features many other technology and financial experts eager to lend their knowledge to this new endeavor.</p>
<p>Regulatory Compliance Remains an Enduring Challenge</p>
<p>With extensive experience in global compliance, regulatory affairs, and risk management, the inaugural board aims to foster collaboration in designing regulatory solutions tailored to the demands of the increasingly complex payments landscape. The gambling sector represents one of the most significant challenges, as partnering operators must navigate even stricter regulations.</p>
<p>Payments compliance Executive Advisory Board members were eager to pool their collective knowledge and expertise to help businesses remain at the forefront of their industry. Delivering cutting-edge content and industry-leading regulatory tools aligns with Vixio’s mission to help its customers remain compliant. The program’s transparency should be a significant boon to the company’s partners and provide lasting value.</p>
<p>This newest development further highlights Vixio’s focus on compliance. June saw the company unveil VIXIO Data Hub, its strategic planning and analysis portal offering live updates to relevant regulatory parameters. The Executive Advisory Board will be another invaluable tool, helping partnering businesses remain compliant and better prepared for expansion into new jurisdictions.</p>
