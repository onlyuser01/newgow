<p>Dear Stephen,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. Iâ€™m sorry to hear about your problem. I have checked bonus terms and conditions, and this is what I found:</p>
<p>"Bonus funds are valid for all slots (and scratch cards) by Betsoft and GS."</p>
<p>"The casino reserves the right to remove winnings and withhold withdrawals if a player has placed bets on games other than Slots and Scratch cards while the player has an active bonus balance."</p>
<p>"The following games are not eligible to play with the bonus and do not count towards wagering requirements: Blackjack in all forms, Roulette in all forms, and Poker in all forms."</p>
<p>Are you aware of placing any bets on roulette, while wagering your bonus funds? If you are, sadly, there is not much I can do to support your case at this time. I would strongly recommend reading all the T&amp;Cs carefully before you start playing to avoid any misunderstandings in the future. Casinos try to design their bonuses to be as attractive as possible, but the rules must always be followed.</p>
<p>We would like to see casinos implementing systems that would prevent players from placing bets on restricted games, but, unfortunately, this is not a standard practice yet. You were not stopped or blocked when you decided to switch games, and, as a result, you breached promotional terms.</p>
<p>Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is anything else, I could do for you in this matter, otherwise I will be forced to reject your complaint. Thank you for your understanding.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
