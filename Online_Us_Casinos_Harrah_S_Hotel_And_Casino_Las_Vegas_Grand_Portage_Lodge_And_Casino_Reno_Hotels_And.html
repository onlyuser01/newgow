<p>The organization tasked with the betterment of the global gaming industry through the establishment and application of standards and protocols celebrated its 25th Year Anniversary</p>
<p>The International Gaming Standards Association (IGSA) has recognized the original founding member of the organizaiton, Light &amp; Wonder. Commenting on the significance of Light &amp; Wonder to IGSA’s overall mission and dedication to making the gambling industry a better place, the organization’s president, Peter DeRaedt, said that Light &amp; Wonder has always been committed to the creation of higher standards for companies to follow no matter where in the world they are based.</p>
<p>The Leader in Imposing Technological Standards on Business</p>
<p>According to DeRaedt, Light &amp; Wonder played a crucial role in helping the entire organization progress by accessing advanced technological solutions that were the proprietary work of the founding member.</p>
<p>Early in the organization’s history, Light &amp; Wonder, which was known under another name back in the day, donated the Game Authentical Terminal (GAT) technology which became a core solution and quickly became a leading regulatory standard. DeRaedt also noted:</p>
<p>They were also the first to adopt G2S (Game to System) and have become its largest implementor. As an organization, we are grateful for their continuing and unwavering support. IGSA president Peter DeRaedt</p>
<p>This happens on the occasion of IGSA’s 25th Year Anniversary, which was welcomed by Light &amp; Wonder CPO Rich Schneider as well. According to Schneider, IGSA has done an outstanding job of ensuring and implementing global technical standards for the industry. Thanks to IGSA’s commitment and unflagging efforts, casinos today are held to a very high ethical and technological standard which affects everything, from progressive jackpots to player tracking to paying bonuses.</p>
<p>The industry may have looked different had it not been for IGSA’s commitment to building a better future for businesses and consumers, Schneider conveyed in his message and address to IGSA.</p>
