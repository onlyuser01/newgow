<p>A very lucky local man started the new year right. He won more than $6.4 million while playing Pai Gow Progressive poker on Saturday at the Flamingo Las Vegas Casino.</p>

<p>The Las Vegas Strip venue announced the large win via Twitter on Sunday morning. The total jackpot is $6,443,401.</p>
<p>The player won the game with a straight flush, according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal. The winning cards were the eight, nine, 10, jack, queen, and ace of spades, as well as a joker.</p>
<p>Typically, in Pai Gow Poker, players are dealt seven cards. After one draw, players must make a two-card low hand and a five-card high hand, each as high as possible.</p>
<p>A facsimile check held by the winner was made out to Thomas Evans Zanot.</p>

<p>The casino on Twitter simply identified him as “Thomas Z.” He reportedly resides in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>In the upper left corner of the check was the name of the corporate owner and operator of the Flamingo: Caesars Entertainment.</p>
<p>Security appeared beefed up on the casino floor after the win.</p>
<p>Recent Flamingo Winners</p>
<p>The Flamingo Las Vegas saw several other winners during the end of last year.</p>
<p>In November, another local, Brent Weiss of Las Vegas, won $465,945 while playing a Mississippi Stud poker game at the Flamingo.</p>
<p>It was a progressive jackpot, too. He won with a royal flush.</p>
<p>Also, in October, another player won $187,542 while playing Let It Ride poker at the Flamingo.</p>
<p>It, too, was through a progressive jackpot. The player won with a royal flush. The winner wasn’t identified.</p>
<p>Also in October, still another unnamed local won $288,024 at the Flamingo. It was also through a progressive jackpot.</p>
<p>The winning hand was also a royal flush. The local was playing Crazy-4 poker.</p>
<p>Future of Flamingo</p>
<p>Last year, rumors broke that Caesars Entertainment was thinking of selling the Flamingo. The rumored asking price was at least $1 billion.</p>
<p>Real estate investment trust (REIT) company VICI Properties has the right of first refusal on the Flamingo Las Vegas.</p>
<p>Caesars Entertainment never confirmed it was looking to sell the well-known Strip property.</p>
<p>Given its rumored condition, the Flamingo will likely soon need some renovations. The hotel was last improved in a $90-million renovation which was finished in 2018.</p>
<p>The Flamingo traces its origins to 1946. That was when gangster Benjamin “Bugsy” Siegel opened the property after spending $6 million. It was considered the first luxury hotel on the Las Vegas Strip.</p>
<p>The following year, Siegel was killed. The Flamingo has had a series of new owners over the decades. The original venue was demolished.</p>
<p>Famous Headliners</p>
<p>It was also well-known for its famous headliners that drew large audiences. Some of these stars included such luminaries as Judy Garland, Tom Jones, Ella Fitzgerald, Wayne Newton, and The Supremes.</p>
<p>Donny and Marie Osmond, as well as Olivia Newton-John, were among the more recent performers at the Flamingo.</p>
<p>The Elvis Presley film, Viva Las Vegas, was filmed partially on location at the Flamingo.</p>
