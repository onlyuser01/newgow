    <h1>Casinos In Indiana New Casinos In Las Vegas Seneca Niagara Resort And Casino Bally S Atlantic City H</h1>

<p>Dear Guro Team, I would like to express my indignation towards this betting site.</p>
<p>On June 22, 2023, I received a promotional email to make a deposit using the code RELOAD in order to receive a 75% deposit bonus. I receive this offer every Thursday. I followed through and deposited 60,00 BRL, securing a 75% bonus — a total sum that is subjected to a rollover of 1.335,00 BRL. I managed to secure a BIGWIN in the Book of Nibelungem game with a bet of 1,00 BRL and won 930,00 BRL. My balance was at R$1242,86 BRL and I had 35% left to fully complete the rollover. When I finally completed it, my balance instantly decreased to R$ 90,00 BRL. I sought out the support team who informed me that I allegedly violated the terms by placing a 5,00 BRL bet, despite 75% of my rollover bets being exactly 1,00 BRL. I only played one 5,00 BRL game where its minimum wager was just that. I was left very upset and helpless by this occurrence. Consequently, I refrained from depositing into Betboom for a while. On Thursday, August 24, 2023, an identical situation occurred, the balance I had managed to build up was again reduced to R$ 90,00 BRL. This seems like a tactic they employ and it feels as if they're misleading gamblers and exploiting nonexistent rules. So, Betboom, what did I do this time for you to sweep away my balance again? I sent them an email requesting my self-exclusion from this exploiting platform. What kind of bonus is this anyway? I use numerous betting sites and all the money we win in a rollover is totally ours. My ID: 26-430204.</p>
<p>Betboom, I am not your guinea pig — you cannot let me win, complete the rollover, and then redistribute my prize.</p>
<p>I urge all gamblers to steer clear from this platform as you'll inevitably fall into the same trap. You are not a trustworthy or honest casino. I have got all the necessary documentation and screenshots as evidence.</p>
