<p>The two-way deal will see REEVO power Livespins with content while distributing the streaming product to other operators</p>
<p>Livespins, a socially-charged slots platform, has announced a partnership agreement with the casino content developer and aggregator REEVO. As agreed, the latter company will provide its full slots portfolio to Livespins.</p>
<p>Livespins adds a social element to playing slot games, allowing customers to bet behind a streamer, brand ambassador or celebrity acting as a host. Multiple customers can wager in the same room and comment on the developments in a chat full of features.</p>
<p>Livespins seeks to make sure that bettors are enjoying themselves, whether they win or not.</p>
<p>The current deal marks the first time REEVO’s games will be available to Livespins players. Customers will now be able to experience engaging titles like Crazy Crocs, OktoBeerFest, Spartan Shields, Super Goals and Reels and Wolf Wild, among others.</p>
<p>At the same time, the deal will make Livespins available to operators powered by REEVO, further boosting the streaming product’s reach and popularity.</p>
<p>The Deal Is a Great Opportunity for Both Companies</p>
<p>Michael Pedersen, Livespins’ chief commercial officer, commented on the agreement with REEVO, saying that it is a very important one.</p>
<p>Not only does it allow us to add more quality content to our growing portfolio of slots for our streamers to access for their streams, but it also increases the distribution of Livespins to more operators than ever before. Michael Pedersen, CCO, Livespins</p>
<p>Pedersen added that streams depend on varied content. Because of that, his team is always prepared to go to great lengths to secure games from best-in-class iGaming providers, such as REEVO. He is certain that Livespins players are going to love the developer’s games.</p>
<p>The CCO concluded that his team is just as excited to see REEVO’s operator partners add Livespins to their lobbies.</p>
<p>REEVO’s head of sales, Petra Maria Poola, also commented on the matter. She praised Livespins for the freshness it brings to the gaming space, saying that her team will be glad to offer it to its partners.</p>
<p>We are also excited to be able to bring a fun, compliant streaming product to our operator partners for the first time. This will help us to continue to stand out as a game aggregator with a difference. Petra Maria Poola, head of sales, REEVO</p>
<p>REEVO is a company focused on developing and aggregating a rich selection of slot games. The company seeks to provide its clients with diverse suites of titles through a single API integration.</p>
<p>Livespins, meanwhile, penned a content agreement with Wazdan a month ago.</p>
