    <h1>Online Casino Apps Harrahs Casino San Diego Rivers Casino Resort Golden Gate Casino Hotel Bally S On</h1>

<p>Resorts World Las Vegas has teamed up with Hilton to utilize three of its brands in the currently under development integrated casino resort that will be located in the northern end of the Las Vegas Strip.</p>
<p>Hilton Breaks Its Record</p>
<p>Under the terms of the deal that is the largest multi-brand deal in Hilton’s history, the $4.3 billion integrated casino and resort located on the site of the former Stardust Resort and Casino, owned and operated under the Resort World brand of the Malaysian-based Genting Group, will feature three properties under the Hilton Hotels &amp; Resorts, LXR, and Conrad premium brands.</p>
<p>“With our commitment to redefining the luxury hotel standard in Las Vegas, it was only natural for us to partner with Hilton, a leader in the global hospitality industry”, Scott Sibella, President, Resorts World Las Vegas.</p>
<p>The three Hilton properties will offer in total 3,500 rooms, lots of facilities including a 220,000-square-foot pool complex with “seven unique pool experiences”, a 5,000 capacity theatre that would host celebrity and corporate events, meeting and events space, a spa and fitness centre, and an extensive collection of casual and fine-dining restaurants.</p>
<p>VIP Program Included</p>
<p>“Our strategic partnership with Resorts World Las Vegas underscores Hilton’s commitment to expanding our footprint and portfolio of exceptional properties. This will mark our largest multi-brand deal in company history, and we are excited to work with our new partners to create a distinct hotel experience in an unbeatable location for our future guests and Hilton Honors members”, Ian Carter, President, Global Development, Architecture, Design and Construction, Hilton.</p>
<p>The Hilton Honours program spreads across all 18 brands of the hospitality group, allowing guests of Hilton properties that are members to take advantage of a number of benefits, such as flexible payment options, exclusive discounts, Digital Key, and others.</p>
<p>Casino Operations Already Secured</p>
<p>The Hilton deal is announced just several days after Resorts World Las Vegas agreed a deal with Konami Gaming to task the gaming company with streamlining, managing and optimizing the resort’s gaming operations within its 110,000-square-foot casino, by utilizing its SYNKROS gaming technology system.</p>
<p>The dynamic SYNKROS system will provide the casino with marketing, communication, and tracking tools that are tailored towards player engagement through individual incentives, as well as real-time assessment and performance optimization of the casino operations through detailed reports and analytics, and Resorts World Las Vegas will be the first Strip casino property to harness the full suite of tools from this software.</p>
<p>On Schedule For The Grand Opening</p>
<p>The casino integrated Resorts World Las Vegas will consist of two towers, is scheduled to open doors in the summer of 2021 and development so far is on track for the planned day of opening.</p>
