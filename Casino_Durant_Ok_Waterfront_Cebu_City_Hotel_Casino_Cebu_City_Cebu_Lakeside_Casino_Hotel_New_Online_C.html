<p>GGPoker will offer online poker players in the Czech Republic the best it can offer to its global player database</p>
<p>GGPoker, the world’s largest online poker room, announced its partnership with King’s slots has recently resulted in a license issuance by the Ministry of Finance in the Czech Republic.</p>
<p>Plenty to Offer to Czech Players</p>
<p>Following the issuance of the license, GGPoker will launch in the Czech market via its GGPoker.cz website in the near future and offer online poker players in the Czech Republic to compete against its entire global player pool.</p>
<p>Marco Trucco, head of Europe for GGPoker outlined his excitement “to work with King’s slots” and extend GGPoker’s global reach to Czech players, promising them a lot in 2023 and beyond.</p>
<p>“We will have a lot to offer the market in 2023 and beyond, including WSOP satellites, massive tournaments, the most exciting cash games, exclusive promotions and more,” Trucco said.</p>
<p>Online poker players in the Czech Republic will become part of GGPoker’s global player pool, gain access to GGPoker’s software and offering and be able to compete in the largest poker tournaments in the market, as well as a variety of games running around the clock.</p>
<p>Partner’s 20-Year Anniversary</p>
<p>The majority shareholder of King’s Entertainment Group, Leon Tsoukernik, spoke on behalf of the group to express equal excitement about the “continued development” of its partnership with GGPoker on the global stage.</p>
<p>“As the leading casino and poker venue in Europe [and] home of WSOP Europe, it was only natural for both our companies to come together to introduce GGPoker to our local audience in the Czech Republic,” Tsoukernik added, stressing the timing of the launch which coincides with the 20-year anniversary of King’s Casino on the Czech market.</p>
<p>A subsidiary of Vestar Group, King’s Entertainment operates three land-based casinos in the Czech Republic – King’s Casino Rozvadov, Admiral Casino in Rozvadov and King’s Casino at the Hilton Hotel in Prague. GGPoker’s partner, King’s slots, is a subsidiary of King’s Entertainment Group.</p>
<p>Upon launch, GGPoker will offer its new players in the Czech Republic the poker room’s Welcome Bonus, its Honeymoon for Newcomers promotion to allow them to earn even more rewards, as well as its Fish Buffet loyalty program featuring regular cash prizes.</p>
<p>The Czech Republic is set to become the latest jurisdiction where the world’s largest poker room will be available, following in the footsteps of another European jurisdiction, Germany, after the State Administration Office of Saxony-Anhalt issued a license to GGPoker in December to allow it to operate online poker in the next five years.</p>
