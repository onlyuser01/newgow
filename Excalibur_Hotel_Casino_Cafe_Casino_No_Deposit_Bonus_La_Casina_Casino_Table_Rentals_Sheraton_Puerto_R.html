    <h1>Excalibur Hotel Casino Cafe Casino No Deposit Bonus La Casina Casino Table Rentals Sheraton Puerto R</h1>

<p>An ad featuring a retired NFL legend training to come back to the league and do something he hasn’t in his old role? Yes, please.</p>
<p>“Unprecedented” Field Goal Attempt</p>
<p>The campaign is called The Kick of Destiny, and every FanDuel gambler with a bet of $5 or more can win a portion of the $10 million in free bets. The live commercial will see Gronkowski attempting to kick a field goal at half-time. If he makes the kick, the eligible bettors will win a share of the $10 million.</p>
<p>Although Gronkowski’s legendary status in the NFL stems from his four Super Bowl wins as a tight end with the Patriots and Buccaneers, the commercial will show him trying to make the kick. Known for the “Gronk spike” and the “Gronk smash,” fans are eager for him to make the kick, so they can also have the “Gronk kick.”</p>
<p>I spent my career catching the ball, but I always knew I could kick it and now I’ll do it live in front of football fans everywhere during the Super Bowl. Rob Gronkowski</p>
<p>He also added that with $10 million in free FanDuel bets on the line, he is “training every day” to give fans what they want.</p>
<p>Winning a portion of that $10 million free bets is also a motivator to see the kick come to fruition, of course, not just Gronkowski making it. Also, with the minimum qualifying bet being $5, winning a share of the free bets during Super Bowl LVII, becomes an alluring possibility for many fans and bettors. That’s not all, however.</p>
<p>FanDuel Has a Lot in Store</p>
<p>FanDuel has prepared a series of promotional activities – both on the ground in Phoenix, as well as digital – in the run-up to the game. The Foot of Destiny – a signed replica of Gronk’s foot – will be available for fans to take photos with, and will be auctioned off after the Super Bowl ends.</p>
<p>Furthermore, fans over 21 will be given an on-site opportunity to make the Kick of Destiny themselves at the Super Bowl Experience, giving them a chance to win $25 at the FanDuel Sportsbook at Phoenix Suns Footprint Center. Probably no one should expect to see these kicks broadcast live on national TV, though.</p>
<p>Our first-ever Super Bowl commercial will be more than just a television spot – it will create a moment that will bring fans together, and give them something to collectively cheer for. Andrew Sneyd, exec VP of marketing, FanDuel</p>
<p>Sneyd also said that “anything can happen” during Gronk’s field attempt, adding to the hype.</p>
<p>The ad itself got its very own kickoff of sorts, with a 30-second teaser of Gronkowski as a car mechanic getting a call from his agent with the offer for The Kick of Destiny. Without being given a chance to accept or reject, Gronk is faced with a large poster of the campaign and says that he “better call Vinatieri.”</p>
<p>This is a reference to his old teammate Adam Vinatieri, a kicker for the Patriots. The campaign will follow Gronkowski’s journey, and this includes training for the kick. With the short ad referencing Vinatieri, and the press release mentioning a “legendary kicker,” it’s easy to infer that Vinatieri might also make an appearance in The Kick of Destiny campaign.</p>
