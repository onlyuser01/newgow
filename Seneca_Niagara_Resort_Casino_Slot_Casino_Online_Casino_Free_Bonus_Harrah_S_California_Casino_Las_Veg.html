<p>Alpha Eagle review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Alpha Eagle is themed around a rugged natural world and birds of prey.</p>
<p>Players will soar through mountain air and discover a world ruled by majestic eagles. Dodging snowflakes and rocky cliffs, they’ll learn the mysteries of this unforgiving avian realm.</p>
<p>Nature-lovers and those yearning to escape to the wild will especially enjoy Alpha Eagle’s breathtaking setting.</p>
<p>Win in the base game</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The rhythmic soundtrack has a chilled out retro vibe that brings to mind the opening montage from an ‘80s film. It might have been interesting if this slot incorporated ambient natural sounds like wind whistling through the mountains or the calls of birds.</p>
<p>The reels are filled with animal-related symbols, including feathers, talons, fish, owls, and, of course, eagles. An adorable hatchling eagle even makes an appearance, peeking out of the top of his egg.</p>
<p>The setting beyond the reels sets the naturalistic tone for this slot, with rocky mountains covered in snow and the pale winter sun in the distance. Snowflakes continuously fall, adding to the frosty atmosphere. Players will quickly be able to imagine the cold wind rushing through their hair as they swoop around the mountain peaks.</p>
<p>Overall, the soundtrack and graphics of Alpha Eagle create a cold world of birds of prey.</p>

<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all paying symbols.</p>
<p>The Stack’n’Sync symbol triggers the Stack’n’Sync feature in which the reel where the Stack’n’Sync symbol landed is copied to as many as 4 of the other reels, stacking them with matching symbols.</p>
<p>If players land the Golden Stack’n’Sync symbol, this will trigger the Stack’n’Sync feature and guarantee that all reels are stacked with high paying symbols and Wilds.</p>
<p>Big win with reels filled by the Stack’n’Sync feature</p>
<p>The Free Spins feature begins when players land 3 or more Free Spins symbols at the same time. For each Free Spins symbol that triggers the feature, 1 free spin will be awarded up to a maximum of 20 Free Spin symbols awarding 20 free spins.</p>
<p>Throughout the Free Spins feature, players have an increased chance of triggering the Stack’n’Sync feature.</p>
<p>The Eagle Link bonus is triggered by landing 3 Eagle Claw symbols at the same time in the base game. During this bonus, only Eagle symbols, Golden Eagle symbols, and non-paying symbols appear.</p>
<p>The first phase of the Eagle Link bonus is the collect phase, in which Eagle and Golden Eagle symbols are sticky on the reels. Players receive 3 spins and collect the Eagle and Golden Eagle symbols stuck on the reels.</p>
<p>The second phase of the Eagle Link bonus is the payout phase, in which all the Eagle and Golden Eagle symbols trigger the Eagle Link feature, connecting all Eagle symbols that have landed adjacent to Golden Eagle symbols or Eagle symbols that are connected to the Eagle Link. already.
