<p>Ahead of the upcoming launch of legal sports wagering in Massachusetts, the gambling regulator in the state is reportedly planning to introduce tough betting advertising regulation</p>
<p>As reported by Legal Sports Report, the gambling regulator in Massachusetts, the Massachusetts Gaming Commission, considered Thursday proposal for tough advertising regulations in the state.</p>
<p>MGC Reportedly Considers Restrictions for Betting Ads</p>
<p>The discussion comes ahead of the planned launch of retail sports wagering set for the end of this month. One proposal, which seems unlikely to happen at all, calls to prohibit sports wagering advertising for stadiums including TD Garden, Gillette Stadium, as well as Fenway Park. The specific proposal to restrict ads prohibits “employee or vendor of any sports wagering operator” from encouraging or proposing individuals to place betting wagers. At the same time, the newly proposed gambling restrictions do not forbid general advertising.</p>
<p>The debate regarding the proposal is still ongoing and the regulator is yet to approve or reject the change calling to restrict betting advertisements. Besides restricting gambling, the regulator continues to review applications for sports betting operator licenses Category 3. Recently, the MGC reviewed Betr’s license suitability, while the regulator is also planning to review applications from leading industry operators such as DraftKings and FanDuel, to name a few.</p>
<p>The proposal for the ban of betting ads in Massachusetts reminds of a bill that was introduced in New York which has a similar goal. The bill calls for the introduction of warning messages as a part of promotional materials for sports wagering or gambling. Such messages, the bill calls to include a warning that the gambling activity may result in harm. Introduced in January 2021, the proposal hasn’t gained much traction in New York and although it has passed the Assembly, it is yet to pass the Senate.</p>
<p>Ohio Faces Issues with Operators Breaching Betting Ad Rules</p>
<p>The efforts to restrict gambling advertising do not come as a surprise. Ohio, a state that only recently launched its regulated market has already seen breaches of advertising rules. The regulator identified gambling operators who advertised betting services to individuals under 21 which resulted in fines.</p>
<p>Consequently, the Ohio Casino Control Commission, the gambling regulator in the state, expressed it is disappointed to see operators breaching the rules about advertising. What’s more, a recent report revealed that fines for breaching advertising regulations for sports betting cannot be considered as the cost of doing business in Ohio. Still, the regulator is yet to introduce tougher measures against betting operators that breach the rules.</p>
