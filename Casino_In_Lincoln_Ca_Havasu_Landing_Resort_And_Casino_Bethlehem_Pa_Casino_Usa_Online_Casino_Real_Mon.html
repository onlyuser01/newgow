    <h1>Casino In Lincoln Ca Havasu Landing Resort And Casino Bethlehem Pa Casino Usa Online Casino Real Mon</h1>

<p>The leading iGaming company focusing on offering white-label solutions that power betting and online gambling operators across the globe, Soft2Bet, announced a new strategic partnership. Earlier this week, the company confirmed it joined forces with Hacksaw Gaming. Under the terms of the freshly minted partnership, Hacksaw Gaming's thrilling games are going to power Soft2Bet's popular brand in Romania, Don.ro.</p>
<p>The collaboration marks the debut of the iGaming supplier's games on the leading online gambling platform. As a result, Don.ro customers will be able to enjoy some of Hacksaw Gaming's popular titles, including RIP City, Le Bandit and Wanted Dead or a Wild, among others.</p>
<p>The online casino site is renowned for its portfolio of games, offering a wide selection of slot, live dealer and table games. Overall, Don.ro offers more than 1,200 games, catering to different demographics and promising exceptional experiences. Now, thanks to the partnership with Hacksaw Gaming, the online casino site will further grow its offering, delivering exciting entertainment.</p>
<p>George Wadsworth, Soft2Bet's Head of Casino, shared his excitement about the new deal in a statement. "Hacksaw is an obvious addition for Soft2Betâ€™s latest brand Don.Ro; the performance of the content reaches organic customers who are there for the thrill," he explained. Finally, Wadsworth noted: "We are ecstatic to add Hacksaw to our regulated offering in Romania."</p>
<p>Marcus Cordes, Hacksaw Gaming's CEO, was similarly thrilled. He outlined that the company entered a number of markets throughout 2023. "We are eager to keep this up in 2024," explained Cordes in conclusion.</p>
<p>The latest collaboration represents another important partnership for the duo. This is because Hacksaw Gaming and Soft2Bet first joined forces in 2020. Since then, the two companies have had a successful long-standing partnership that continues to expand to new markets. Soft2Bet's innovative, scalable platform and promotional tools, combined with Hacksaw Gaming's unique portfolio of games enable the two companies to grow their presence in different jurisdictions across the globe.</p>
<p>Back in December, Hacksaw Gaming expanded its presence in Canada and Croatia. At the time, the company confirmed it joined forces with Caesars Digital for the market in Ontario, Canada. Per that partnership, Hacksaw Gaming agreed to deliver its fan-favorite and popular games to customers of Caesars Palace Online Casino and Caesars Sportsbook &amp; Casino.</p>
<p>Additionally, the company clinched a European-facing deal by teaming up with Betsson Group. That deal saw the iGaming supplier agree to deliver titles for Betsson's Rizk brand in Croatia.</p>
