<p>Baha Mar Casino and Quick Custom Intelligence have partnered to provide QCI Slots at the luxury resort’s casino in The Bahamas</p>
<p>The new partnership inked between Baha Mar Casino, the largest and most luxurious casino in the Caribbean and San Diego-based Quick Custom Intelligence (QCI) started on February 21, 2023.</p>
<p>Baha Mar Casino Hitting the Refresh Button on Its Slots</p>
<p>According to the terms of the agreement, the casino’s current slot games will go through an upgrading process with the help of QCI’s platform. The latter is a data-based software that provides state-of-the-art technology for well-coordinated activities across all operations.</p>
<p>The QCI platform will work by optimizing Baha Mar’s casino slot product. This will be done by gaining a better understanding of its player interactions, learning which machines record the highest performance and ultimately bringing performance improvements across all available slot machines.</p>
<p>At the moment, the new QCI Slots product is still being installed throughout the property which features floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the beautiful Bahamian waters. The dedicated casino operations crew will initiate its training for the new product in the near future.</p>
<p>Baha Mar Casino’s senior vice president of casino operations John Zaremba has expressed their thrill regarding the inclusion of the fresh QCI Platform across their current slots. Zaremba also anticipated the impact that QCI’s Platform will have on the way they will be running their operations in the future while providing them with the necessary tools to “make strategic decisions on how to improve the gaming experience all around.”</p>
<p>QCI, “Honored” to Welcome Baha Mar Casino to the Community</p>
<p>QCI’s chief executive officer Dr. Ralph Thomas took the opportunity to welcome Baha Mar Casino into the QCI Community which currently comprises over 100 casino resorts and 4,000+ active users of their platform. Thomas added that Baha Mar Casino’s decision to choose the QCI Enterprise Platform is additional proof of how important it is for them to keep creating products that truly match the needs of their customers.</p>
<p>The gorgeous location in The Bahamas offers a wide plethora of guest offerings designed for all types of players including casual players and high-stakes rollers. The casino hosts more than 1000 slot machines, along with 18 table games and live sport betting options provided by William Hill.</p>
<p>Baha Mar Casino offers just the right mix of engaging gameplay, luxury, and eye-catching sceneries and it is joined by the Royal Blue Golf Course, the Baha Bay luxury water park, 2,3000 hotel rooms, over 45 restaurants and lounging rooms, a flagship spa, and dozens of luxury retail outlets which are all part of the integrated Baha Mar resort in Nassau.</p>
<p>Between January 22 and February 3, 2023, Baha Mar Casino hosted the PokerStars Players No-Limit Hold’em Championship.</p>
<p>Last December, QCI announced it would power Black Oak Casino Resort with its solutions.</p>
