<p>Leprechaun Carol review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Christmas time is here year-round in Leprechaun Carol, which, unlike many leprechaun slots, limits its ugly stereotyping of the Irish to the odd glass of fake Guinness on the reels. Instead, it has added a crust of Christmas cheer in the form of snow in the background and red costumes on the leprechauns.</p>
<p>Though in its defence, as a flimsy pretext for a holiday theme goes, it is still rather better than Atlantis Thunder: St Patrick’s Day.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>Few slots are quite as tastelessly garish as Leprechaun Carol. The rosy cheeked leprechauns on the reels look like hideous shopping mall decorations and everything else has the same plastic sheen as a novelty garden gnome.</p>
<p>The music is passable though, if a little saccharine and sleigh-bell heavy, and the animations are competently brought to life.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Leprechauns Carol is played on five reels with three rows each and twenty winlines between them.</p>
<p>There are a number of bonus games (detailed below) and features which inject a little variety into the game, allowing it to irritate the player in as many different ways as possible.</p>
<p>During the base game at random one of three features may be triggered.</p>
<p>The Scatter Nudge can add a third Scatter to reel five when there is a Scatter already on reels one and three. Some spins will include a giant 2x2 or 3x3 symbol, while others will have random number of Wilds added to the reels. After some random spins a picking game will be triggered that offers cash prizes.</p>
<p>These features may be a distraction for some and a welcome variation to others.</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter symbol.</p>
<p>The Scatter falls on reels one, three and five only. Hitting three Scatters will trigger one of three bonus games chosen at random.</p>
<p>The first Bonus is a simple picking game that allows you to turn over objects to reveal free spins, multipliers and permanent Wilds which will stick on the reels for all the Free Spins. When you turn over the Collect object the Free Spins begin. Any revealed spins and multipliers are then added to the basic starting numbers of 20 free spins and a x3 multiplier.</p>
<p>The second possible bonus is the Giant Symbol Bonus. This gives you three free spins with a randomly chosen 3x3 symbol on each spin. The first symbol appears across reels three to five and moves one space to the left each spin.</p>
<p>The third feature gives you 15 free spins with a x4 multiplier. The Scatter is then replaced on all reels by a Coin symbol. Every time you accumulate 5 or more Coin symbols, five spins are added to the player’s free spin total and the multiplier increases by one.</p>
<p>It is these various bonuses where the real winnings are to be had in Leprechaun Carol.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.59%, a fair bit over our yardstick of about 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.20 up to a maximum of $/£/€100.00 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of Leprechaun Carol is high, which works well with our preferred slot machine strategies. Our preference is for highly volatility slots, even when they are as ugly to look as this one undoubtedly is.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Leprechaun Carol has a decent return to player and high volatility, making it a great game to use our preferred slot strategies on.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, those mechanics are hidden under a horrible visual style.</p>
<p>If you can get past the visuals, some players will find something to like in the grab-bag of random and triggerable bonuses, but for most players, there are better options out there.</p>
