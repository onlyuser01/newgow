<p>Supplier of artificial intelligence (AI)-based marketing solutions Ibex.ai signed a partnership with online gaming technology and solutions provider Aardvark Technologies to further strengthen Aardvark’s industry appeal.</p>
<p>Personalization and Automation at Its Highest</p>
<p>The agreement between Aardvark Technologies and Ibex.ai will allow customers at the iGaming tech provider to gain access to Ibex.ai’s innovative customer relationship management (CRM) tools to help elevate its capabilities linked to the creation of distinctive marketing campaigns custom-made for each client.</p>
<p>Commenting on the partnership, Aardvark Technologies’ chief executive officer Simas Denisovas outlined the need for any business operating in the competitive iGaming sector to acquire new customers while “keeping hold of its existing ones.”</p>
<p>Ibex.Ai was exactly what we’ve been looking for as they have developed a system with a different approach to allow the maximum possible personalization and an extremely high level of automation which we think is crucial for our partners. Simas Denisovas, CEO, Aardvark Technologies</p>
<p>With a system built to meet the needs of a modern online gaming operator, Ibex.ai provides for increased customer retention and customer lifetime value (LTV) rates, utilizing 100% personalization and a high level of automation-based machine learning algorithms.</p>
<p>Using unique monetization-based calculations to maximize profitability, the system targets each customer with the most profitable offer at the right time via the correct channels to ensure a high level of monetization in a responsible way.</p>
<p>Shared Passion for ‘Cutting-Edge’ Technology</p>
<p>Thomas Aigner, head of Business Development at Ibex.ai, was delighted to partner with Aardvark Technologies as both companies “share a passion for using cutting-edge technology.”</p>
<p>This not only enhances the overall player experience but provides its partners with a level of personalization and automation which is fundamentally changing how their Marketing Teams will work, allowing them to scale more quickly in existing and new markets. Thomas Aigner, Head of Business Development, Ibex.ai</p>
<p>Founded by bookmakers with decades of operational experience, Aardvark Technologies seeks to provide solutions to the online gaming industry’s problems by delivering a platform for real-time administration of various betting management systems, powered by a transactions engine with capabilities of over 500 transactions per second.</p>
<p>Aardvark Technologies’ customers also have the support of a dedicated team of professionals operating out of the company’s offices in Lithuania and available round the clock to solve any issues that may arise with its partners.</p>
<p>AI-based CRM services provider Ibex.ai announced last month a free trial of its CRM capabilities for iGaming operators in an attempt to prove its offering is the best on the market, as well as engage with potential future customers such as start-ups that are currently operating within a limited budget and cannot allocate resources for their own CRM software.</p>
