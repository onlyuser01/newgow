<p>REEVO is continuing to expand in new geographies with the supplier and aggregator company adding yet another Latin American partner</p>
<p>The company has signed a new partnership with Vibra Gaming, a prominent supplier of innovative and reliable content, now joining REEVO’s library of games and enlivening the variety from which REEVO’s partners may choose.</p>
<p>Vibra Gaming to Strengthen REEVO’s Latin American Ambitions</p>
<p>Vibra Gaming has produced a number of established games, that feature popular characters Condorito and El Porto Rodrigo, Popeye El Marino. This has led to more excellent slots in the company’s library. The company is a GLI-certified supplier with a strong presence in the region, which makes it all the more important to REEVO.</p>
<p>By teaming up with the aggregator, Vibra Gaming will have access to hundreds of operators that may be interested in onboarding its games. The company’s API allows for quick integration of new partner and their deployment with the company’s network of operators. REEVO Head of Sales Petra Maria Poola was excited to welcome Vibra Gaming as the company’s latest trusted ally in a region that is evolving rapidly:</p>
<p>This partnership embodies our commitment to delivering unrivaled gaming experiences while empowering operators with the tools to differentiate and customize their offerings. REEVO Head of Sales Petra Maria Poola</p>
<p>Vibra Gaming CEO Ramiro Atucha was similarly excited about the partnership and he said that teaming up with REEVO was an important strategic goal for the supplier in its pursuit of further growth and opportunities.</p>
<p>REEVO Expands Portfolio of Games Steadily</p>
<p>“We’re very enthusiastic about working with them, as I’m sure it will also be very positive for players and operators alike,” Atucha added. REEVO has been steadily adding to the list of its supplier partners over the past weeks and months with the company securing similar partnerships with Barbara Bang Games and RubyPlay.</p>
<p>The company has been expanding rapidly by singling out tier-one suppliers and adding them to its single API to guarantee a strong effect with both gaming audiences and partner operators, as well as the new suppliers REEVO has been adding. Earlier this year REEVO also introduced games by Endorphina and AvatarUX, 3 Oaks Gaming, and many others.</p>
