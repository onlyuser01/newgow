    <h1>St Croix Casinos Juwa Online Casino Real Money Ocean Downs Casino Maryland Seneca Falls Casino Palac</h1>

<p>Hello casino guru, I am Chilean, I come to you with a complaint about this shameless casino, first they made me verify my account 4 times, yes 4 times, they asked me for a series of documents to verify it and since I had large amounts for withdrawal so I sent everything that they asked me by mail since there were many things they asked for, I sent it and it took them 2 whole weeks to tell me that my account had been blocked, they didn't tell me anything, they didn't notify me, they just blocked my account and to top it off they They kept my deposits and my earnings, I had spoken with an agent 1 day before my account was blocked and he told me that my documents were perfectly verified and that there would be no problem finally making my withdrawal the next day when the mail arrived that it had been verified, I was very happy because I could finally make my withdrawal and everything in order, but to my surprise I only received the email that my account was blocked with all my deposit and earnings, I mean, I don't know if it was a b URL of the agent who attended me or his supervisor gave him the order to block me from everything, I can talk to them in the chat because they never answer me, it should be noted that in the email they sent me it said that my account had been blocked, but they would the return of my deposits, which has been going on for 1 month without an answer, without any type of email with nothing to know how to do, they made it clear to me that they would give me that refund but I'm still here, without a refund and without answers, it's a horrible casino and My patience has run out, they are keeping my money and profit and that is unfair after having verified my account 4 times with all the documents they asked for, please help me.</p>
