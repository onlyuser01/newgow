    <h1>Casino Near Niagara Falls Bitcoin Casino Online Hotels Near Hollywood Casino Grantville Pa Taos Moun</h1>

<p>Okay, I just had the most confusing customer support experience:</p>
<p>[02:10:20] Visitor: Hello Dario! I heard my verification is done, is this true? :) Also, when can I expect my withdrawal?</p>
<p>[02:13:36] Dario: I will look into that now, I will be a few minutes!</p>
<p>[02:14:21] Dario: Yes **** its all uploaded and confirmed</p>
<p>[02:14:55] Dario: your weagerin is in zero so you only need to make a deposit to be able to make a withdrawal.</p>
<p>[02:16:26] Dario: I'm going to make you an offer so that you get an extra gift when you come back to play with us. By making a deposit of 15 I can add you x30 free spins</p>
<p>[02:16:34] Dario: What do you think about it</p>
<p>[02:18:19] Dario: Are you still here ****?</p>
<p>[02:18:37] Visitor: Hello</p>
<p>[02:18:44] Visitor: I have already made a deposit before.</p>
<p>[02:18:45] Visitor: In april.</p>
<p>[02:19:06] Visitor: So I should not need to make a deposit anymore, the withdrawal should be processed accordingly ðŸ™‚</p>
<p>[02:19:25] Visitor: That is what it says in your terms and conditions. [02:19:34] Dario: But bear in mind that it has been too long since your last deposit.</p>
<p>[02:19:45] Visitor: No.</p>
<p>[02:19:50] Visitor: This is unfortunately not true.</p>
<p>[02:20:03] Visitor: Your terms and conditions do not mention this, let me get this for you:</p>
<p>[02:20:41] Visitor: You must have made a deposit in order to withdraw any cash winnings. (Minimum deposit amounts as set in our cashier apply.)</p>
<p>[02:21:05] Visitor: This clearly means I should have made a deposit SOME TIME. No time limit is specified, meaning I should get my withdrawal.</p>
<p>[02:21:11] Visitor: This is from the exact bonus I used.</p>
<p>[02:21:27] Visitor: I will contact your license holder MGA if this is not processed, seeing as I am in the right here.</p>
<p>[02:21:59] Dario: As far i see in your account you already requested a withdrawal, which is pending in this moment</p>
<p>[02:22:13] Dario: so you need to wait to resolve this status in order to requested again</p>
<p>[02:22:58] Visitor: I did not request anything again - I just asked what is the process of my withdrawal. :) In the last conversation I was told it is in final review - is this true? :ðŸ™‚</p>
<p>[02:23:03] Dario: this is the amount of the withdrawal you requested EUR 240.00 with date 2023- 06-12 11:45:57</p>
<p>[02:23:42] Visitor: Yes. I know this :ðŸ™‚</p>
<p>[02:23:59] Dario: **** im informing to you how is the process and what do you have to do. Please note that in order to see your wagering you ned to make a deposit to be able for this</p>
<p>[02:24:13] Dario: in case you wanty to make it by yourself</p>
<p>[02:24:33] Dario: as i see in your account you already requested a withdrawal, now is pending</p>
<p>[02:24:43] Dario: so i can make a withdrawal if its already pending [02:24:50] Visitor: What wagering? I do not need to see any wagering. I just want my withdrawal to be processed, and I am fully entitled to this.</p>
<p>[02:24:55] Dario: do you understand this ****?</p>
<p>[02:25:07] Visitor: You are unfortunately making no sense.</p>
<p>[02:25:34] Dario: **** do you know what is the weagering? [02:26:02] Visitor: I have nothing to wager. Do you understand this? I was talking about the pending withdrawal - I completed the wager on that one.</p>
<p>[02:26:14] Visitor: And I am asking when I will get thtat pending withdrawal</p>
<p>[02:28:46] Dario: **** , as i told you you have a withdrawal which is pending , please try to understand that i cant change this status because is already processed</p>
<p>[02:29:01] Dario: i told you already your weagering is cero and you are able to make a withdrawal</p>
<p>[02:29:39] Visitor: I was talking about the pending withdrawal. I was told it is in the last review in the last chat - I was merely asking if this is true.</p>
<p>[02:29:50] Dario: after check your finance data, i saw you pending withdrawal and i cant change the status, it is already procesed , we need to wait until will be or done or canceled</p>
<p>[02:30:11] Dario: if its done you will receive the money in your account and also i confirmation about the transaction</p>
