<p>Hacksaw Gaming, an award-winning and highly-successful and innovative supplier of original content for online casinos, has established its footprint further in the Romanian iGaming market through a tie-up with MaxBet Romania.</p>
<p>The partnership allows Hacksaw Gaming to grow and expand its presence in the market a notch further, bringing an impressive selection of games to the operator’s library. Among those are games such as Wanted Dead or a Wild, Hand of Anubis and Dork Unit.</p>
<p>Players get to enjoy games by one of the most successful new developers that released its first game in 2019 and has been gathering momentum ever since, including awards at several distinguished events over the past years.</p>
<p>Hacksaw Gaming CCO Gabrielle Star commented on this fresh opportunity and said that it was a significant leap forward for the supplier. Star added:</p>
<p>"Romanian players have already demonstrated a thirst for our extensive portfolio of games, and we’re delighted to reach an even broader audience through this deal with a leading player in MaxBet."</p>
<p>MaxBet Romania Marketing Manager Alexandru Ghiurcau was similarly excited to be introducing this portfolio to the website. Hacksaw slots are some of the best, Ghiurcau noted, arguing that the operator would significantly benefit from the titles.</p>
<p>Over the past several months, Hacksaw has been actively consolidating its footprint in iGaming. The company has been able to expand not only geographically but also in terms of the brand it services in the markets it operates in.</p>
<p>Thus the supplier launched its games with BetMGM in Ontario, Canada which is celebrated as a huge success by the supplier. Back in Europe, the company also secured a business-to-business license from Spelinspektionen the Swedish gambling regulator as part of the reregulation of the regime.</p>
<p>Hacksaw Gaming is also powering and providing content to William Hill, another prominent operator that has picked the supplier as a trustworthy and innovative partner, and precisely what players need. Last year, Hacksaw Gaming made two big market launches – one in Italy and the other in the United States.</p>
<p>On balance, Hacksaw Gaming has been focused on growing its footprint internationally and establishing itself as a leading supplier in multiple jurisdictions. Hacksaw Gaming produces slots, instant win games, and scratchcards. The studio’s first game was a scratch card.</p>
