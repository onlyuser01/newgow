<p>A woman in Michigan, accused of stealing $700,000 from a casino was booked into the Van Buren County Jail last week. Charges against the woman claim she embezzled the money and her bond was set at a staggering $1 million. As reported by WOOD, the 38-year-old, Danika Young, is accused of stealing some $700,000 from Four Winds Hartford Casino.</p>
<p>According to investigators, the money was embezzled by the young woman that was found in neighboring Indiana. Reportedly, on July 30, 2023, in the afternoon, Young, took the money from the Hartford-area casino. On July 31, 2023, at a probable cause hearing an officer testified explaining that Young was a cash cage supervisor and was in charge of millions of dollars.</p>
<p>The officer that testified explained that the woman counted $700,000, then put them into a bag and took off. Young’s version of the event slightly differed as she claimed she received a call from an unknown number asking her to deliver the money to Gary, Indiana.</p>
<p>Although she was detained, the money hasn’t been recovered. It is currently unclear why the young woman would follow the instructions of this person. Similarly, law enforcement is yet to determine if other people were involved in the case.</p>
<p>Keeping in mind that she was detained in a different state, Young had to be extradited to Michigan. Reportedly she was also booked into jail and faces charges related to embezzlement by an employee of $100,000 or more. Young doesn’t have prior criminal offenses and hearings on her case are set for August 9, 2023, and August 16, 2023. If she is sentenced, the 38-year-old may face up to 20 years of prison time.</p>
<p>Money Is Still Missing</p>
<p>Judge Arthur Clarke explained that his main concern is that the $700,000 that was taken was not recovered. He outlined that if Young is released, the money may show up and she may disappear. Consequently, Clarke set the woman’s bond at $1 million.</p>
<p>“That $700,000 has not been located… My concern is if I release you and $700,000 would show up and you would be off to wherever and I would not see you again.“ Judge Arthur Clarke</p>
<p>On the other hand, Young’s defense explained that she was working at the Four Winds Hartford Casino for the last 16 years. The public defender also pointed out that she has a child. Hearings on the case continue this week and next week.</p>
