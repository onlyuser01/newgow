<p>Thor Infinity Reels is YG Masters’ latest slot game developed in collaboration with ReelPlay and offering players numerous opportunities to win.</p>
<p>Nordic Saga Unfolds in Yggdrasil’s Thor Infinity Reels</p>
<p>Yggdrasil and ReePlay are back with another unique slot experience inspired by Norse Mythology. In Thor Infinity Reels, players get to explore a battle-scorched world with numerous opportunities for big wins. This is the latest addition to the popular YG Masters program that is deployed utilizing the company’s dedicated GATI technology.</p>
<p>The gameplay is underpinned by Yggdrasil’s proprietary tech and math, and it boosts the gameplay experience further. In Thor Infinity Reels, you will meet all iconic heroes from the Norse Mythology for a shot at uncovering some divine fortunes.</p>
<p>The art, animation, sound, and overall ambiance will have you believing that you are caught in a deciding battle for the sake of existence. Thanks to GATI, players will have all sorts of great options regardless of their playstyle or budget.</p>
<p>Simple Start Building into Big Payday</p>
<p>The gameplay starts simple, with three reels displayed initially on the grid. Each spin, though, allows you to continue adding to the reels and expand on the layout, taking you closer to the potential jackpot payout.</p>
<p>Should a player reach the 15th reel, the bonus Jackpot Prize worth, 888x of your bet size will be triggered. If you want to make sure you enjoy smooth sailing on your way there, though, you should keep an eye out for the Hammer symbols.</p>
<p>Six of those will trigger the Jackpot Respins, which will award prizes for each symbol landed. Meanwhile, YG Masters makes it quite simple for partners to integrate the game into their own portfolios as the solution comes pre-configured and regulation-ready.</p>
<p>Pre-Configured Game for Partner Operators</p>
<p>This means that all partners can get access to the game almost at the same time and offer it back to players who ultimately have the final say whether a game hits the mark.</p>
<p>Yggdrasil, head of partner programs Stuart McCarthy, said he was happy with the release, adding: “Launching yet another title through our YG Masters program powered by GATI ensures that players will continue to be provided with flawless gaming experiences.”</p>
<p>McCarthy praised the gripping theme and progressive mechanics brought on display in Thor Infinity Reels and argued that Yggdrasil is now exploring to add more high-quality products as the year progresses.</p>
<p>ReelPlay CEO David Johnson joined the conversation arguing that Thor Infinity Reels demonstrates the studio’s strength and relying on tested mechanics. “Thor develops the bonus feature that has proven so popular in our Hypernova Megaways game and provides an Infinity Reels twist for a really stunning visual,” Johnson said.</p>
<p>He paid tribute to Yggdrasil and its GATI technology which makes it possible for ReelPlay’s products to continue reaching new audiences.</p>
<p>Yggdrasil has already had several successful launches this year. The company released Easter Island 2 and Viking Runs in collaboration with True Labs.</p>
