<p>Sportradar has acquired Fresh Eight, a marketing personalization platform, to strengthen its own digital marketing platform for sports betting businesses.</p>
<p>DCO Personalization to Optimize Investments</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Sportradar acquired marketing automation platform Fresh Eight to strengthen its own digital marketing services platform. The global sports betting and entertainment provider announced the deal Thursday, with the acquisition completed through Sportradar Management Ltd.</p>
<p>Through the deal, Sportradar will be able to offer dynamic creative optimization (DCO) personalization in both display and paid social. This service allows bookmakers to “fully optimize their media investments,” according to Sportradar’s statement. Fresh Eight’s technology also gives sports-centric businesses full control over the integration of sports betting content on their platforms.</p>
<p>This new deal is a welcomed addition to Sportradar’s ad:s Marketing Cloud platform, which provides sportsbooks and gaming firms with a powerful toolbox to effectively market and advertise their businesses. According to Sportradar, “the newly combined offering will widen the ad:s platform’s marketing channel access and enhance its overall performance efficiency proposition, built around reduced operator CPAs, higher ROAS and significant workflow improvements.”</p>
<p>Keep Growing and Innovating</p>
<p>As the gambling market keeps changing and expanding, Sportradar “must continually innovate and grow”, Carsten Koerl, the group’s CEO, declared. This acquisition will allow the ad:s platform to grow faster, thanks to Fresh Eight’s personalization technology.</p>
<p>Fresh Eight CEO and founder Andrew Sharland added that the company was created to focus on advertising efficiency and return on investment for gambling and media businesses globally. He noted that both companies share the same vision on AI and automation to change marketing in the wagering industry. “The combination of Fresh Eight’s machine decisioned personalization tools and Sportradar’s proprietary marketing technology and access to real-time sports and pricing data present customers with a compelling digital marketing offering,” Sharland said.</p>
