<p>Play’n GO, one of the biggest names in the iGaming industry, and a company certified in dozens of jurisdictions, has reported a new milestone in its 20-year history, with the supplier posting close to 250m rounds played in a single day across its titles.</p>
<p>This is a remarkable milestone, and it comes on the back of multiple expansion and content-injection deals with prominent gaming brands, including BetMGM and Betway, and not least the company’s advancement in the regulated iGaming market in the United States.</p>
<p>With more geographies adopting online casino gaming, Play’n GO has been able to deploy its games with more worthwhile operators and companies that have made it possible for the supplier to drive the most recent success story.</p>
<p>Play’n GO has also launched a number of initiatives of its own to ensure that it continues to be a preferred slot gaming provider amongst players and operators, including the most recent launch of its Network Leaderboard promotions.</p>
<p>Commenting on this recent success, Play’n GO CCO Magnus Olsson said that the company’s most recent milestone is a testament to the hard work that has gone into building unique and outstanding products across the board.</p>
<p>Play’n GO is a supplier known for titles such as Reactoonz, Raging Rex, Honey Rush, Hugo, Sweet Alchemy, and many other outstanding products that have been developed over the years. Today, the studio features more than 300 online games focusing on the best possible slot experience.</p>
<p>"Our titles continue to be extremely sticky with the millions of unique players who enjoy our games every single day, and with blockbuster titles like Gargantoonz still on the horizon in 2023 we may finish the year with more records set," Olsson added, confident that the future of Play’n GO will bring even more robust results.</p>
<p>Play’n GO has also pursued opportunities beyond its digital stomping ground and introduced a retail version of its acclaimed Book of Dead series with William Hill in the United Kingdom.</p>
