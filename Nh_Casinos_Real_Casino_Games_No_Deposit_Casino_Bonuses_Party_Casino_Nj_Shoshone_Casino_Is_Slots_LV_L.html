<p>Based in Costa Rica and sporting a fresh look, Slots LV Casino is a website where US players will find over 400 dedicated casino games. The casino comes with a huge $5,000 welcome bonus, great banking options, and the appropriate SSL encryption. With payment methods that let you cash out within three to five days, you are looking at an online casino that covers all bases, as confirmed in our own Slots.lv Casino review.</p>
<p>Slots.lv Online Casino has a fresh user interface and great mobile compatible platform, guaranteeing excitement on the go. The Slots.lv cashout is swift and the HTML5 technology that has gone in crafting the casino is definitely a catch. You definitely won’t find yourself in a shortage of great online casino games, with top studios such as Real Time Gaming, Bodog, and Rival Gaming offering some pretty riveting games.</p>
<p>Slots.lv Casino Pros and Cons: Is It Worth It?</p>
<p>Slots.lv definitely has a ton to offer. Players will find themselves picking from hundreds of games, great banking methods, and a user experience that all in all feels very satisfying. There are some specific features of this online casino that make it even more worthwhile visiting. So, let’s have a look.</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<p>A dedicated Bitcoin sign-up bonus</p>
<p>Over 400 quality casino games</p>
<p>A great number of promotions</p>
<p>Bitcoin banking, deposits and cashouts</p>
<p>HTML5-powered instant play</p>
<p>Specialty games including bingo and keno</p>
<p>Cons:</p>
<p>Wagering conditions become difficult</p>
<p>Some players may want more banking options</p>
<p>Who Is Behind Slots.lv Online Casino?</p>
<p>One of the reasons why Slots.lv was so quick to establish itself as a household name in the US gambling landscape is the company that operates the brand today, Lynton Limited Casinos.</p>
<p>You have heard of Lynton as the operator of other respected brands, including Ignition Casino and Bovada, which are two established flagship casinos that accept US players.</p>
<p>Today, though, Slots.lv enjoys a unique twist that allows USA players to access an experience that is worthwhile, offers a quick solution to common pet peeves in online gambling, and generally helps players have a great time playing at this online casino. Our Slots.lv Casino review starts with the welcome bonus.</p>
<p>Slots.lv Welcome Bonus</p>
<p>Now, most casinos probably settle for small bonuses. They offer you around $500 or $1000, but Slots.lv wants to give you more leeway. This online casino will allow you to claim $5,000 as your starter’s pack. With so much bonus money, you can really get extra value from your deposits, especially when the first deposit is matched by 200%.</p>
<p>So, $5,000 may look a bit too intimidating at first, but Slots.lv Online Casino has come up with a great way to let you claim the promo and not carry too much of a burden in terms of wagering requirements.</p>
<p>Simple as it is, this bonus allows you to claim up to $1,000 on your first deposit. The amount is matched by 200% and you simply need to use the HELLOSLOTS200 bonus code to trigger it. Once you do, the bonus will be credited to your account and you will have to subject both the deposit and bonus amount to a 35x wagering requirement.</p>
<p>It may be a little steep to complete this in a hurry, but there is plenty of time to do this, and remember, you get to accumulate Loyalty Points. For the remainder of the bonus sum, some $4,000, you will simply have to make eight (8) more deposits matched at 100% up to $500 each.</p>
<p>We like this approach, as Slots.lv Casino allows you to manage your money and claim the bonus in small, albeit helpful increments. The subsequent deposits are subject to the same terms and conditions. If you choose to go a different route and pick the Bitcoin promotion, you can even get more value right on the doorstep. The online casino will offer $7,500 in Bitcoin bonus funds, which definitely seems like a good choice.</p>
<p>Slots.lv Bonus and Promo codes</p>
<p>Clearly, Slots.lv Online Casino uses bonus codes. The casino uses the codes to help you keep track of everything that happens when it comes to your promos. The Slots.lv promo codes are very easy to claim, they require a modest deposit to claim and offer a great paying potential, making them one of our top choice. Just remember to quickly go through the terms and conditions and see if you are happy with the promo conditions first.</p>
<p>Promotions and Bonuses</p>
<p>For a well-rounded experience, Slots.lv Casino has made sure that you have quite a few things to look forward to. Naturally, the selection of promotions is one of those. And, while you won’t see flashy promos to distract you from your gameplay daily, you will definitely appreciate the gems that are available at the casino and help you make your experience more entertaining.</p>
<p>The Weekly Double Up</p>
<p>There is The Weekly Double Up that allows you to make a deposit and claim up to $100 matched at 100%. The rate is slightly better for Bitcoin depositors who can get up to $500 matched $200. The best part is that those are unlimited redemptions, which means you can keep going and claim more bonuses. Speaking of claiming the bonus, it’s very simple. You just have to follow several steps.</p>
<p>Go to your bonus menu and select The Double Up or The Double Up Bitcoin Edition Make the $10 qualifying deposit up to $100 or up to $500 based on the promotion Redeem the bonus once every week and play with bonus funds again</p>
<p>Totally Tuesdays</p>
<p>Another great promotion includes Totally Tuesdays which brings an opportunity to boost your rewards two-fold. The promotion is quite simple in nature. You simply get twice the amount of Rewards Points by playing the slots every Tuesday!</p>
<p>Refer and Earn</p>
<p>Keen to let your friends know about the Slots.lv Online Casino action? You can do so and benefit from bringing more people to the casino. The Refer a Friend bonus will grant you up to $200 and, for any first deposit placed with Bitcoin by your friends, you will get an additional $25. The referral program is unlimited meaning that the more loyal players you bring to the casino, the bigger your own benefits would be.</p>
<p>Stay Loyal with Slots.lv Casino</p>
<p>Slots.lv is all about the long-term and, as such, there is a MySlots Rewards program, which US players will appreciate as it offers various incentives to players. You will find a whole bunch of rewards awaiting. The casino will allocate different cash rewards, and surprise perks that will be made available to you as you continue to play.</p>
<p>The program is immune to level deterioration, meaning that you don’t have to keep playing to keep your standing in the community, giving you a fantastic opportunity to progress. You can not least redeem your points for real money, giving you another way to boost your game.</p>
<p>The Games Available at Slots.lv</p>
<p>With 400+ games to pick from, provided by some outstanding studios, US players will find themselves picking from some unique games you won’t be able to find elsewhere. Slots.lv Casino games feature a seemingly inexhaustible variety of slots, table games, live dealer games, video poker, specialty, jackpots, tournaments, and a brand-new section called fantastic features.</p>
<p>With the help of Real Time Gaming, Bodog, and Rival Gaming and a massive shift towards HTML5 technology, Slots.lv Online Casino has created one of the best portfolios of iGaming titles you have ever wished for. There are dozens of new additions and Slots.lv has really brought its “A” game in providing you with some unique gameplay solutions.</p>
<p>Best of all, the platform works in instant play and mobile form, making it very easy for you to pick a game and just play. Let’s take a closer look at what Slots.lv has to offer specifically.</p>
<p>Slots</p>
<p>It’s difficult to imagine an online casino that hasn’t packed a whole lot of slot games. In the case of Slots.lv, we are talking about 226 delightful slot games that you can enjoy for real money or just test the free demo version of. There are some delightful games, and as an additional courtesy to players, everyone can use filters to single out specific titles they enjoy.</p>
<p>For example, you can pick slot games based on the number of reels, whether they are a jackpot game, and exclusive slot, or simply considered popular or new slots. The game themselves are a real delight, as we often say. While casinos like Slots.lv have been a bit slow to adapt to new trends and release many new games, 2020 has definitely been a flagship year in terms of new slot games.</p>
<p>Slots.lv players can enjoy unique titles that no other casino can or has offered yet. Gold Rush Gus is a real catch, redrawing the slots experience for everyone. In this awesome game, you have a prospector who runs across a mine and only stops to tap the seams for precious metals.</p>
<p>This slot machine has a very flexible betting limit, unique visuals, and gameplay that you will want to come back and try again and again. As to the other great online slots at Slots.lv Casino, there are tons!</p>
<p>The freshest games include Lucky Wheel, Dragons Siege, Fairy Wins, Cyberpunk City, Caesar’s Victory, Multiplier Man, Reign of Gnomes, and others. Some games offer delightful jackpots, and you can win over $150,000 in titles such as A Night with Cleo.</p>
<p>In fact, there are over 56 jackpot slot games. While not all of them are progressive, you can find some pretty amazing payouts!</p>
<p>Progressive Jackpots</p>
<p>With close to 60 jackpot games, you are probably wondering – are these games worthwhile? Slots.lv Online Casino has made sure that all slots feel great to play and you definitely shouldn’t miss out on. In terms of the highest payout volume, you probably want to stick with the progressive jackpots. They usually include Food Fight ($776,000), A Night with Cleo ($150,000), 777 Deluxe ($48,000), Strike Gold ($50,000), and others.</p>
<p>These numbers are not fixed in stone, so you will often see them all over the place, especially when a new jackpot has been hit or, perhaps, a jackpot hasn’t been won in a while! There are 56 different games to try, and their number is growing, so don’t miss out.</p>
<p>Video Poker</p>
<p>There are 17 video poker games to pick from at Slots.lv Online Casino. That is a pretty good number and you will find pretty good payout percentages, too. Statistically, video poker offers hefty rewards, making it very easy for players to have a blast. Sure, there is a bit of a learning curve, but once you are past that, you will really unfold your talent. You can have your pick of the litter with games such as:</p>
<p>Bonus Poker</p>
<p>Deuces Wild</p>
<p>Double Jackpot Poker</p>
<p>Joker Poker 52 Hand</p>
<p>Jacks or Better</p>
<p>Naturally, there are other versions of video poker to try. You can play all of these games for free or with some pretty decent minimum bets. Once again, you can preview every individual game. The drawback here is that most of these video poker options require Adobe Flash Player to run, which is a bit of a no-no in our book.</p>
<p>Table Games</p>
<p>While Blackjack doesn’t get its own section, you will find nine excellent versions of the game listed under table games. They include Single Deck Blackjack, arguably the highest RTP game, Classic Single Deck, Perfect Pairs, Zappit Blackjack, and others. There are other table games that will definitely catch your eye, too. Slots.lv Online Casino successfully mixes various classic gems, such as:</p>
<p>Craps</p>
<p>Tri-Card Poker</p>
<p>Let’em Ride Classic</p>
<p>European Roulette</p>
<p>Baccarat &amp; others</p>
<p>The table limits are pretty decent and in line with the budgets of even more conservative players. Besides, you can always play in a demo mode first and have a look around. Remember, each game has a fantastic preview that drills the bedrock of the game and explains everything in great detail. You can learn and master new games without ever leaving Slots.lv Online Casino to look for a guide.</p>
<p>Fantastic Features Slots</p>
<p>Slots.lv Online Casino is upping the ante in 2020 by the introduction of a special series of games known as “Fantastic Features Slots.” They come with unique hero bonuses, jackpots, and awesome additional games where you will find more opportunities to win. This section is only just starting, so you can expect to find more outstanding additions, similar to Dragons Siege and Gods of Luxor.</p>
<p>Slots.lv Online Live Dealer Casino</p>
<p>The Live Dealer casino at Slots.lv is definitely a catch. You will be able to discover all popular and worthwhile table games that will come in the company of a great-looking croupier. The hosts and hostesses at Slots.lv will guide you right through the gameplay. You can choose from:</p>
<p>Live Baccarat</p>
<p>Live Dealer Blackjack</p>
<p>Live Dealer American Roulette</p>
<p>Live Dealer European Roulette</p>
<p>Live Dealer Super 6</p>
<p>The games can be played on the go and you can only play for real money. You will find the table limits very flexible, allowing you to play with as little as $1 – $5 per bet, and all the way up to $3,000, $5,000, and more. The table limits may be even more generous once you are a loyal patron at Slots.lv Online Casino and have attained a higher rank within the casino construct.</p>
<p>Slots.lv Banking Options</p>
<p>As all self-regulated casinos, Slots.lv Casino relies on a slightly different selection of payment methods that allow US players to deposit and withdraw at a good pace. The casino lists Visa, MasterCard, Bitcoin, and Bank Transfer as the available payment options for you to use.</p>
<p>There is not much of a downside to having a few deposit options, especially if you opt for Bitcoin. All deposits are processed in USD, making for a quick and easy way to play in your native currency.</p>
<p>Bitcoin makes everything easier, that’s for sure. You can still deposit with a bank card though, and place minimum deposits of at least $20. For withdrawals, you will go on the same merry-go-around, opting for the same payment options and being able to withdraw up to $2,500 every seven days. There may be some specific changes to the amount you can withdraw as per the payment option you use, so keep this in mind as well.</p>
<p>Safety and Security at Slots.lv Casino</p>
<p>Upholding safety and security standards is not always easy, but industry leaders such as Slots.lv Casino have done well. The casino self-regulates by introducing all necessary safety checks, including SSL encryption and a Random Number Generator (RNG) which will make sure that each outcome you get out of a game is completely unbiased and free of tinkering. The casino also has a lot of feedback posted about it online and the majority of players and reviewing services share our opinion that Slots.lv is a safe and secure online casino.</p>
<p>How Does Slots.lv Feel on Mobile?</p>
<p>Slots.lv Online Casino feels great on mobile, allowing players to benefit from almost the full portfolio of games. There may still be a few hiccups though, as the video poker section uses Adobe Flash Player still. Even with these extenuating circumstances, you will have access to 200+ slots, live games, and other worthwhile table games that are very much worth a shot.</p>
<p>Customer Support: Make the Most of the Help Center</p>
<p>The casino runs a great customer support service that you will definitely find easily and benefit from. The highlight is the help center. You will get comprehensive support chapters that will answer any question you may have about the casino, live dealer section, your own account, and security as well as bonuses and even Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Registered players can get in touch with customer support via live chat or by sending an email which will be processed within 24 hours. All live chat messages are instant and will be responded to within a minute.</p>
<p>What Do We Think About Slots.lv Online Casino?</p>
<p>Slots.lv Online Casino has a lot to offer to players. With a delightful variety of games and many of them at that, this casino stands well in the US gaming landscape. The addition of exciting new games and features has also contributed to consolidating its status as a trusted and worthwhile gaming venue.</p>
<p>The welcome bonus does appear a little steep at first, but thanks to the multiple deposit players can make, the wagering conditions are no longer a challenge. US players will be able to use any banking method they are comfortable with, whether this is credit cards or cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin Cash or Bitcoin.</p>
<p>More importantly, Slots.lv has extensive players feedback online, and you can always see for yourself that the casino is one of the most trusted and frequented online casinos that accept US players today.</p>
