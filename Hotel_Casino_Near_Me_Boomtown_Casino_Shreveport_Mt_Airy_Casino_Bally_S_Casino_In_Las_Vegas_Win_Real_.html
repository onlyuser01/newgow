    <h1>Hotel Casino Near Me Boomtown Casino Shreveport Mt Airy Casino Bally S Casino In Las Vegas Win Real</h1>

<p>I play small stakes. Maximum 20 euros per week. From time to time I have a smaller profit that I have had paid out to me so far.</p>
<p>I wasn't aware of what the casinos can charge and what Praise Casino has charged:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>confirmation of ownership;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bank statements showing the transfer of funds from a corporate account to a personal account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Last audited financial statements and bank statement of the company for the last 6 months;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Copies of invoices showing trading activity for sales and purchases.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For a stake of 20 euros and a profit of 100 euros, one cannot assume money laundering or terrorist financing. What is being demanded here even exceeds what the German tax office is demanding. The casino support team writes themselves:</p>
<p>"According to our terms and conditions, we may request additional documents to verify your profile."</p>
<p>The keyword here is "CAN".</p>
<p>My suggestion to pay me the money and then close my account was rejected on the grounds that it was not possible. However, last week Gslot Casino and Hejgo Casino paid me the money in the same situation.</p>
<p>This makes it quite obvious: The casino does not want to pay out the money, although it could.</p>
<p>I'm also doing this to warn German players. I was not aware of this BEFORE playing and WHEN depositing. With additional documents I thought of a re-proof of address or something similar. But not that I have to disclose my COMPLETE financial situation. Again: I play with 20 euros per week.</p>
