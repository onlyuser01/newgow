    <h1>Hard Rock Casino Bristol Brand New Sweeps Casinos Seminole Hard Rock Hotel Casino Fort Lauderdale Fl</h1>

<p>I will send it and I hope they solve it for me because I am already tired of waiting well first I comment that they withheld my payment in process of 7 thousand usdt for more than a month and then only returned the money to my cbet account later with the Gmail that they ask me for that the DNI that the last movements of my income I send them why do they want to make an excuse not to pay me in any way</p>
<p>Also, I didn't put in any bonus, anything strange that they want to invent.</p>
<p>Here I also leave you when they block me</p>
<p>I couldn't talk to support or anything then after a while I got on my phone and I was able to talk and it said thisThe truth is that this is a shame, well after a while I started trying small withdrawals because I heard that maybe you could withdraw little by little and well of all the withdrawals that were canceled I managed to withdraw only one million but only in withdrawals of 20 thousand 200 thousand etc on the day 500 thousand pesos but I slowly withdrew after 3 days and managed to get a million through astrplay I wanted to continue withdrawing little by little and they blocked me from withdrawing through astroplay the others that I did for crypto usdt etc they rejected them and then when it happens I kinda want to try to get out and I didn't have anything in the account</p>
<p>I also spoke with two streams, one sent me this when it is a lie..</p>
<p>. I also have a chat with another stream that promoted them saying that you robbed them. to many users</p>
<p>I also asked him to give me at least half but no response. I asked him to pay me at least a little bit but not even that.</p>
