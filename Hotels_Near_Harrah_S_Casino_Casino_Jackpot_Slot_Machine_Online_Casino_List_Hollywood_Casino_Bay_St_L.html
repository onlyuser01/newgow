    <h1>Hotels Near Harrah S Casino Casino Jackpot Slot Machine Online Casino List Hollywood Casino Bay St L</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I'm so stumped as to what else I can do. I always get the same answers from support.</p>
<p>2 weeks ago I earned around €6500 in credit and requested a payout</p>
<p>1x 4750€</p>
<p>1x 750€</p>
<p>and I still had about €1200 credit.</p>
<p>Shortly thereafter, I also received the request for documents for bank account, address and myself from KYC and uploaded them within a few minutes. Then later that evening I got the message "Login Account permabanned" and couldn't log in anymore. Support says because the documents weren't submitted within 30 days, which is bullshit as I uploaded all the documents a few minutes after receiving the email. This can also be verified with the confirmation emails.</p>
<p>The next day an email came from KYC with "cashimashi" as sender - this is another casino also operated by Gammix. There they demanded documents from deposits from 2021 to the cashimashi casino from a bank account that was canceled long ago, which means I no longer have access there. However, to avoid problems, I uploaded a final account statement that says "Account closed". I also uploaded a payslip as "Source of wealth". This has now been rejected several times.</p>
<p>I don't understand why I have to verify a bank account that was not used in connection with Wunderwins. I've been self-banned at Cashimashi Casino for a long time and the account I used at the time no longer exists. The account used for Wunderwins was in January 2023 and is a completely new bank account.</p>
<p>Does anyone have any ideas what else I can do here?</p>
