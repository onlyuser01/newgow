    <h1>How To Win At A Casino Motorcity Casino Hotels Near Wetumpka Casino Casa Blanca Hotel Casino 7 Mile</h1>

<p>The Branschföreningen för Onlinespel (BOS), a Swedish trade union for iGaming companies, recently found out that the state-owned operator promoted its products on a free TV channel in breach of local advertisement laws.</p>
<p>Svenska Spel Promoted Its Products on TV4</p>
<p>As reported by the BOS, Svenska Spel promoted its Keno and scratchcard products on the free TV4. This happened during a regular TV show where guests played Svenska Spel games on-screen. While not a direct ad, this can certainly be regarded as a promotion, the BOS argued.</p>
<p>As a result, the union contacted the local regulator, filing a complaint against Svenska Spel. According to the BOS, the promotions in question could be considered advertisements, meaning that they are in breach of Sweden’s advertisement laws.</p>
<p>Although TV4 considered the promotions in question to be sponsorship segments, the Swedish Press and Broadcasting Authority agreed that they constitute an advertisement and therefore should not be present on a free channel. As a result, the regulator asked TV4 to stop these segments. In addition, the TV channel now risks a fine for broadcasting and illegal advertisement.</p>
<p>Hoffstedt Praised the Authority for Taking Action</p>
<p>The BOS was delighted to hear the regulator’s decision. Gustaf Hoffstedt, the union’s secretary general, praised the outcome, saying that the regulator’s decision is a “victory for thousands of Swedes” who wish to gamble in a safe and regulated ecosystem.</p>
<p>Hoffstedt added that the rules on gambling advertisements are clear enough and define what constitutes advertising and what does not. Special schemes that try to circumvent the rules, such as Svenska Spel’s, will not go unnoticed, the secretary general warned. He noted that he is happy that the regulator is serious about upholding the rules.</p>
<p>Hoffstedt concluded that the Swedish Press and Broadcasting Authority’s decision demonstrates its desire to ensure a level playing field for all licensed gambling companies. Hoffstedt finally slammed Svenska Spel for shrewdly promoting its products in irregular spots, seeking to gain an edge over its competitors and maintain its monopoly.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in Europe, Circus accused TOTO of monopolist practices for similar reasons. The latter company was recently found guilty of securing premium advertisement slots and promoting its products ahead of the launch of legalized gambling in the Netherlands. This provided the company with an unfair advantage over its competitors.</p>
