    <h1>Yaamava Online Casino Gold Strike Casino Tunica Ms Plaza Hotel Casino Reviews Ameristar Casino Kansa</h1>

<p>A withdrawal method other than the one accepted for deposit has been declined.</p>
<p>They have my bank account verified. I did all the procedures you advised. My deposit method was credit card. All documents approved. The one who suggested that I change the withdrawal method was the specialist on the Guru website. I tried to withdraw through Bitcoin. They only accept withdrawal methods used in deposits. Now I put the bank details on the withdrawal and it is never accepted. I don't understand why if my documents were approved why don't they pay me right away. My God did you see? I read on the website that they take up to 14 days to make the payment. So ok!!! But take it from there that the payment is instant. That's a lie. I feel sorry for people who check the Guru site for reliability and find a good reputation there. From the first moment I accessed the spin samurai site it was complicated. I don't have time to spend days and days in the chat always trying to resolve it with a promise that everything is ok and the next day verify that the withdrawal was canceled by them and with lame excuses! Don't want to pay don't pay, but don't tell me that Spin Samurai is reliable!! Why do they accept deposit forms that are not accepted in the withdrawal? I've done everything they told me to correct account data and they always don't approve. Like this? If the account has been accepted for deposit, IT MUST BE ACCEPTED FOR WITHDRAWAL. Very unfair. But I will make the necessary assessments so that other people do not fall into fraud.</p>
