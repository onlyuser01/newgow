<p>A $10 million civil lawsuit was filed Friday against New Orleans Saints running back Alvin Kamara. The plaintiff is the alleged victim of a brutal predawn beating outside a popular Las Vegas Strip nightclub during the NFL Pro Bowl weekend.</p>

<p>Kamara, 27, Kansas City Chiefs cornerback Chris Lammons, 26, and two other men face criminal charges in connection with the incident, which occurred outside of Drai’s After Dark on February 5. Kamara is the only one named in the civil suit.</p>
<p>As first reported by KLAS-TV in Las Vegas Friday afternoon, the suit was filed by Darnell Greene in a Louisiana court.</p>

<p>The filing, which requests compensatory and punitive damages, was accompanied by still photographs isolated from the elevator’s surveillance video, along with a transcription of that recording. (The video itself was not part of the filing.)</p>
<p>Greene told Las Vegas Metropolitan police that he was waiting for an up elevator at the Cromwell Hotel &amp; Casino – Drai’s is on its roof – alongside the four suspects and some other people. When the elevator doors opened, according to the arrest report, Kamara placed his hand on the victim’s chest to stop him from entering the elevator. Greene said he removed Kamara’s hand, which got him shoved by the running back and then punched by Lammons.</p>
<p>Kamara then chased Greene down a hall and struck him “multiple times,” according to the suit, leaving him unconscious on the floor for over two minutes.</p>
<p>“At no point during the attack did Greene hit, punch, or push Kamara or any of his associates,” read the suit, which added that, immediately after the beating, “Kamara bragged about it with a member of his group, stating, ‘I connected with the [expletive]’s jaw so hard.’”</p>
<p>According to KLAS, police reviewed video of the incident, writing in their report that “the story is exactly like how [the victim] describes the attack.”</p>
<p>Greene continues to receive medical treatment for the injuries he sustained, according to his lawsuit. They include an orbital fracture on his right eye, which at the time was swollen shut.</p>
<p>Consequences So Far</p>
<p>Kamara was arrested on a felony battery charge after the Pro Bowl and was released after posting bond. Though battery is considered a misdemeanor in Nevada, authorities charged Kamara with battery resulting in substantial bodily harm, which is considered a class C felony. That means Kamara could face up to five years in prison if convicted.</p>
<p>Kamara was reportedly a no-show at an August court hearing in his criminal trial, which was pushed back to this month.</p>
<p>Considered one of the best all-purpose backs in the NFL, Kamara has made the Pro Bowl in all five years he’s been in the league. According to a report from the Nevada Current, authorities knew Kamara was a suspect in the case before the Pro Bowl started.</p>
<p>The NFL has yet to suspend Kamara or take any corrective action in response to the incident.</p>
