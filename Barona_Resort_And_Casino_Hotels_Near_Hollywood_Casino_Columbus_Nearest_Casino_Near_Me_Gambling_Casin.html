<p>The Slot Game Was Inspired by Ancient China’s Rich Heritage</p>
<p>David Mann, Swintt’s chief executive officer, acknowledged that ancient China served as an inspiration with its rich culture, artifacts and unique architecture. According to him, the company’s designers drew inspiration from this rich culture and “captured the most iconic aspects of this historic part of the world in our Jade Princess slot.”</p>
<p>Mann explained that the company’s premium slot title is easy to play and straightforward. He spoke about the popularity of Swintt’s premium slots that offer engaging and rewarding experiences via Free Spins and other features.</p>
<p>“The slot is built on the same fundamental principles of straightforward gameplay and easy-to-trigger payouts that have already made our Premium line-up so popular with fans, but also includes an engaging Free Spins feature that harnesses the power of sticky wilds to seriously boost players’ prizes.“ David Mann, chief executive officer at Swintt</p>
<p>Swintt’s Premium Slot Delivers Engaging Features</p>
<p>Besides the standard card symbols, Jade Princess players can also come across additional special symbols. Such include embroidered hand fans, ceremonial bowls, ancient tea sets. Additional rewarding symbols are Jade Princess, a dragon statue and a bonus scatter symbol that is presented as a lucky Chinese coin. The developer of the game explained that if players see three or more of those symbols during the base game, they will benefit from 12 Free Spins.</p>
<p>Whenever players trigger Free Spins, the game’s soundtrack, background and lights change, building up a celebratory mood. “Of course, this being a Free Spins feature in a Swintt slot, the upgrades aren’t merely cosmetic as the dragon statue will now lock in place for the duration of the feature whenever it appears on the reels,” explains the company.</p>
<p>Last but not least, Jade Princess players can also benefit from the game’s Risk feature. This functionality triggers a mini-game that grants the players a chance to increase their payout. Online players are asked to guess the color of a hidden playing card. Correct guesses can help the players double or even quadruple their payout. This function continues until a maximum win is hit or the player makes an incorrect selection.</p>
