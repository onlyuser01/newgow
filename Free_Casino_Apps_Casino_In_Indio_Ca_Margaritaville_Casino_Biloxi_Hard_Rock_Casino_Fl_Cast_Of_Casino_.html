<p>BetRivers Sportsbooks Launches in PA</p>
<p>Amid a restructuring bid that will see SugarHouse Casino re-brand as Rivers Casino Philadelphia, the company launched the BetRivers Sportsbook.</p>
<p>The permanent land-based sportsbook sprawls on 5,700-square-foot space and offers a range of amenities, along with a HD video wall that can stream dozens of games at once. To offer sports fans a complete control over the venue, there are 22 self-service betting kiosks as well as six betting windows, food venues and other amenities.</p>
<p>Launch of BetRivers at Rivers Casino.</p>
<p>BetRivers Sportsbook has cost the company $5 million and the property offers three time the space that the previous makeshift venue which hosted betting operations.</p>
<p>Commenting on the development, SugarHouse Casino General Manager Rob Long said that the newly-opened place will quickly turn into ‘every Philly fan’s preferred sports betting venue’.</p>
<p>Rush Street Interactive, the owner of SugarHouse, initiated a series of upgrades to consolidate its footprint across the U.S. The investment amounted to $164 million and it coincided with the arrival of legal sports betting in the U.S., reinvigorating the company’s efforts.</p>
<p>PlaySugarHouse.com to Become BetRivers.com</p>
<p>As part of the rebranding strategy the current PlaySugarHouse.com will become BetRivers.com in Pennsylvania. Previously, Wells Fargo Center received two sports lounges, one by the name of BetRivers.com and another one by the name of Rivers Casino Philadelphia Sports Lounge.</p>
<p>Both are complementary lounges to the BetRivers Sportsbook, the official press release specified. BetRivers.com has also teamed up with the Wells Fargo Center and specifically the Philadelphia Flyers, an NHL franchise.</p>
<p>Rush Street Interactive Mattias Stetz had this to say on the occasion of launching the latest sportsbook:</p>
<p>“We made sure the new BetRivers Sportsbook and the sports lounges at the Wells Fargo Center have everything Philadelphia sports fans need to have fun with their friends, enjoy the games and get in on the action.”</p>
<p>He further added that Rush Street has long proven itself as an established and sports fan-favorite fan. As a result, Stetz expected guests to enjoy the in-casino sportsbook as well as the sports lounges and the ability to place wagers from handheld devices.</p>
<p>The new sportsbook will operate from 10 AM until Midnight on Monday through Thursday, and until 2 AM on Fridays. On Saturdays, the sports betting action will start at 9 AM and stretch until 2 AM and as to Sundays, fans will be welcome to stay from 9 AM to Midnight.</p>
<p>To clear any confusion, Rush Street Interactive PA, LLC owns SugarHouse Casino. The company also operates the aforementioned BetRivers.com and PlaySugarHouse.com.</p>
