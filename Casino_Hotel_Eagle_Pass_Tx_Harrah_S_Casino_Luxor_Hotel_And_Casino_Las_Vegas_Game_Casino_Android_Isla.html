<p>888, one of the biggest gambling groups in the world, has just unveiled a major new addition to its leadership team. The company behind famous gambling brands such as William Hill, 888 and Mr Green announced the appointment of Per Widerström as its new chief executive officer.</p>
<p>Widerström will step into office on October 16 this year and will leverage his vast experience in iGaming to guide the company and capitalize on its current position. The new appointee boasts over 17 years of experience in the iGaming sector and will be an important asset to 888’s growth.</p>
<p>Prior to joining 888 as CEO, Widerström served as CEO of Fortuna Entertainment Group, another leading omnichannel entertainment company. Between 2006 and 2014, he had stints with a number of online gaming businesses across Europe.</p>
<p>As Widerström joins the company, Lord Mendelsohn will return to the role of non-executive chairman. The latter will ensure a smooth transition of responsibilities.</p>
<p>Mendelsohn Welcomed Widerström on Board</p>
<p>Mendelsohn, 888’s executive chair, welcomed Widerström to the company. He noted that the new appointee has been selected after an “extensive and comprehensive search process.” Mendelsohn explained that 888’s board unanimously agreed that Widerström was the “clear standout candidate” to lead the company, build on its success and generate value for its stakeholders.</p>
<p>Mendelsohn praised Widerström’s extensive experience in iGaming and an impressive track record of executing value-creation plans. The chair lauded the hire as an “energetic and inspiring leader” who will transform the company.</p>
<p>He [Widerström] has a strong and proven track record of driving growth and delivering transformation programs at multiple leading online gaming businesses, and the Board is very pleased to appoint someone with the skill set to deliver our objective to become a much stronger international multi-brand operator, leveraging our technology and data capabilities to drive an acceleration in growth. Lord Mendelsohn, executive chair, 888</p>
<p>Mendelsohn concluded that Widerström understands 888’s power and potential and will leverage this to grow the company.</p>
<p>Widerström commented on his new position, saying that he is very glad to join 888 as CEO. He noted that 888’s recent merger with William Hill solidified the former company as a world-class gaming company with an outstanding tech platform and exceptional team.</p>
<p>888 has a clear and attractive opportunity ahead of it and I am very much looking forward to getting started and working with the rest of the team to build on the strong progress already made and achieve the Group’s full and very exciting potential. Per Widerström, CEO appointee, 888</p>
<p>Speaking of changes to 888’s leadership, its director of business development, Yariv Lavi, recently announced his departure from the company. This followed the earlier exit of Shai Tabibian.</p>
