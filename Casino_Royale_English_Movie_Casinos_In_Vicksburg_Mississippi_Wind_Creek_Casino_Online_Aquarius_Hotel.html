    <h1>Casino Royale English Movie Casinos In Vicksburg Mississippi Wind Creek Casino Online Aquarius Hotel</h1>

<p>The Dutch online gambling operator will be the first to benefit from the provider's new cutting-edge Chroma Key Studio capabilities</p>
<p>The leading provider of premium live casino games, powering operators within the online gambling sector in Europe and around the world, Stakelogic Live, announced the launch of its cutting-edge brand-new studio with Bingoal.nl, a Dutch online gambling operator. The launch, announced Friday, makes the Dutch operator the first one to benefit from Stakelogic Live’s new studio.</p>
<p>The content provider’s new Chroma Key Studio leverages green screens that bring options for personalization and customization. Thanks to the collaboration, Bingoal.nl will be the first operator to leverage this technology, seeking to deliver unique live casino experiences to its growing customer base.</p>
<p>Located in the Netherlands, Stakelogic Live’s Chroma Key Studio will stream the games in Dutch. Currently, there are three games that can be streamed via the studio. Those include European Roulette, Absolute Blackjack, as well as 7 Seat Blackjack.</p>
<p>Only recently, Stakelogic announced a new content agreement with Starcasino. Per that deal, the leading provider agreed to supply a portfolio of its games for the operator, strengthening its offering in Belgium. As a result, Starcasino gained access to classic and video slots, along with live dealer titles from Stakelogic.</p>
<p>The New Deal Brings Excitement to Bingoal, Stakelogic</p>
<p>Dany Salmon, Bingoal’s casino product manager, spoke about the significant popularity of the live casino segment in the Dutch gambling market. He acknowledged the importance of that segment for the company and its efforts to deliver unrivaled casino entertainment for its players.</p>
<p>Finally, Salmon said: “Using Stakelogic Live’s Chroma Key Studio allows us to do this in a way that strengthens the relationship between our brand and the player – building trust and the association between players and Bingoal.nl as being the go-to destination for live content in the Netherlands.”</p>
<p>“Live casino is hugely popular in the Netherlands and as an operator, it’s important for us to stand out and deliver unique experiences to our players.“ Dany Salmon, casino product manager at Bingoal.nl</p>
<p>Olga Bajela, Stakelogic Live’s CCO, was similarly excited. She outlined that the launch of the Chroma Key Studio in the Netherlands represents a major milestone for the company. At the same time, she highlighted that the new studio enables Stakelogic to deliver branding opportunities for gambling operators who want to create unique customer experiences.</p>
<p>Bajela explained: “That this can be offered to multiple operators from a single table means this is infinitely scalable, benefitting both Stakelogic Live and the operators that partner with us.” Finally, she said that Stakelogic Live is delighted to see the debut of its new studio with Bingoal.nl, the first operator that will be able to leverage this cutting-edge technology.</p>
