<p>Sands China has announced it would build a hotel tower at Venetian Macau as part of its plans to extend the Cotai Expo exhibition center</p>
<p>In December 2022, Sands China announced it signed a $377 million brand licensing renewal agreement with Las Vegas Sands (LVS) for the upcoming three years.</p>
<p>The agreement that went into effect on January 1, 2023, will allow Sands China to use the fresh international trademark license agreement to offer its subsidiaries including Venetian Orient Ltd and Venetian Macau access to the brands trademarked by Las Vegas Sands.</p>
<p>Now, LVS’ Macau-based arm has announced it was getting ready to build a new hotel in accordance with its Cotai Expo Phase II expansion plans at Venetian Macau. The new facility would be added to the currently existing hotel structure and it would be part of a proposed expansion plan that was formulated last year.</p>
<p>The New Hotel, Part of the Cotai Expo Expansion Plans</p>
<p>The construction of the hotel tower has been, therefore, selected as a way of extending Sands China’s exhibition center Cotai Expo at its Venetian Macau subsidiary.</p>
<p>During an interview with Macau Daily News, Sands China’s president Dr. Wilfred Wong spoke about the Cotai Expo Phase II and the closeby French garden Le Jardin which were currently in a preliminary stage in terms of design and conceptualization. Wong explained that the new hotel would rise “above Sands Expo” while adding that the project was still pending official approval from the government.</p>
<p>An entire team of consultants with experience in the field are currently busy assessing the Le Jardin project which is expected to spread over 50,000 square meters. The new hotel tower that is likely to turn into “another landmark in Macau”, according to the company’s president, could include extra hotel rooms spread across approximately 18,000 square meters or 193,750 square feet.</p>
<p>The extra space would effectively supplement the current capacity for conferences and meetings, according to additional reports from Wong. The official also explained that the new facility would be used to cater to the needs of more business customers “as a result of expanding its MICE capabilities via Cotai Expo Phase II.”</p>
<p>Should a new hotel not be approved by the authorities, explained Wong, Sands China would not be capable to cope “with the demands of the convention and exhibition”.</p>
<p>The current hotel inventory in Macau encompasses roughly 12,000 rooms. At the start of the year, Las Vegas Sands published its Q4 2022 results, showing strong performance while revealing its plans for further in 2023.</p>
<p>Le Jardin to Become a World-Class Themed Garden</p>
<p>Located south of The Londoner Macau, Le Jardin is expected to become a world-class themed garden with plans of green space, a signature greenhouse, and plenty of additional amenities. Together, these amenities and options are expected to offer the locals year-round tourist attractions and quality entertainment options for residents.</p>
<p>Cotai Expo Phase II will be built next to the already existing Cotai Expo and it will be used as a fresh venue to host even more important global conventions, exhibitions, and big events.</p>
<p>The news concerning the new expansion projects came just before the Grand Opening of The Londoner Macau. Earlier in the week, Las Vegas Sands announced it secured a 99-year lease for New York Casino.</p>
