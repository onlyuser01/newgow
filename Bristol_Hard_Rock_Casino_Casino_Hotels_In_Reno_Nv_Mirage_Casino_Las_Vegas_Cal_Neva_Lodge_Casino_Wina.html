<p>New Mobile Sportsbook in New Jersey from Golden Nugget and Scientific Games</p>
<p>Scientific Games has launched a new mobile sports betting solution with Golden Nugget, a leading US gaming operator.</p>
<p>A Partnership as a Testament to the Power of OpenSports</p>
<p>Scientific Games, a world-leading games provider, and Golden Nugget, a leading US gaming operator, are launching a new mobile sportsbook in New Jersey.</p>
<p>The new Golden Nugget sportsbook roll-out in New Jersey will strengthen Scientific Games’ presence in the country. Later this year, Golden Nugget and Scientific Games will deliver the OpenGaming platform to Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Digital at Scientific Games, SVP and GM U.S., Cathryn Lai said that Golden Nugget’s launch in New Jersey is a significant milestone for the two companies and their collaboration which she believes will flourish as they go forward. Lai stated: “It serves as a testament to the power of OpenSports, which is ready to take the player offering in the Garden State to new heights.”</p>
<p>Recently, the two companies launched online casino games and online sports wagering in Michigan.</p>
<p>Golden Nugget Online Gaming president Thomas Winter, stated: “Scientific Games’ OpenSports platform has a well-deserved reputation for being robust and scalable, and our initial experience in Michigan, amid a very busy sporting period, has been positive.”</p>
<p>Last month Golden Nugget entered the NY market as it inked a 20-year partnership deal with Tioga Downs racetrack. The operator signals confidence that New York will have a regulated industry soon.</p>
<p>Scientific Games Strengthen Its Position on the US Market</p>
<p>As Golden Nugget migrates to Scientific Game’s sports wagering technology, the operator’s customers will have access to the OpenSports product suite and managed trading services from Don Best Sports. Users will enjoy a single iOS application, which will unite all Golden Nugget’s offerings.</p>
<p>Scientific Games continue to expand its reach on the US market. The company recently agreed on a 5-year extension to its deal with Tennessee Education Lottery Corporation. Under the deal’s terms, Scientific Games will continue to design games and offer them to retailers in the state, delivering high-quality trusted products for players to enjoy. As the collaboration continues, it will generate more funding for education in Tennessee.</p>
<p>The new sportsbook launch in New Jersey will allow players to enjoy whole new sports betting experience with innovative features such as Parlay Boosts, Quick Parlays, Bet Builder, Daily Enhanced Odds, Same-Game Parlays, Cash Out, and promotions like Next Bet On Us.</p>
