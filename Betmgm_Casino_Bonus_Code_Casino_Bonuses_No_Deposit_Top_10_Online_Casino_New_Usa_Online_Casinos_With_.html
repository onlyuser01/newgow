<p>Forbes’ list of the 14 Best Hotels in Las Vegas has named Red Rock Casino, Resort and Spa as the most worthwhile visit in the Silver State when looking for accommodation</p>
<p>The decision has surprised some but the ruling is a testimony to the hard work that the property has been putting in over the past months. The venue is located 12 miles from the Las Vegas Strip, but it still offers an exclusive experience to guests.</p>
<p>The property is known for its excellent amenities that easily rival those of the main Strip properties, which is one of the reasons why the hotel was distinguished with the high honor. Although the location may not be ideal to some, the exclusivity of the experience is coveted with reservations for the recently introduced Lotus of Siam going back months in advance, for example.</p>
<p>Red Rock Resorts, the operator of the property was pleased to have received the distinction. Red Rock has plenty to offer when it comes to overall guest experience with the gaming floor featuring everything you would expect from the casino including a sportsbook, poker room, and many popular casino games.</p>
<p>Yet, it’s the availability of diverse food and drink places and great resting options that really crown the Red Rock image as the best accommodation in Las Vegas you can book.</p>
<p>Red Rock Not the Only Distinction According to Forbes</p>
<p>Red Rock may be the prime choice when you are looking for good accommodation in Las Vegas, but Wynn Las Vegas is the best venue when it comes to luxury, Forbes believes. The publication has already awarded 24 five-star awards to Wynn Properties so far in 2023, with many of the company’s distinguished properties based all over the country, and even in Macau, and understandably – the Las Vegas Strip.</p>
<p>As to the best hotel design, the distinction went to MGM Grand and its Skylofts. In terms of pure amenities, though, it wasn’t Red Rock that won but once again Aria, another MGM property. Overall, the competition on the Las Vegas Strip is fierce and there is a clear seasonability as to who crowns the hospitality rankings each year. This is good for consumers who are just looking for the best experience possible.</p>
