<p>GG.Bet has been on an absolute tear lately, securing partnerships as a betting sponsor for multiple major Dota 2 events, as well as signing CS:GO’s Team Vitality as its international betting partner.</p>
<p>Dota 2’s Professional Gamers League (PGL) has entered its first partnership with a betting company for its biggest tournament – The International (TI). GG.Bet said it’s “proud to provide continued support for the development of the esports industry and to open up new opportunities for gaming fans” when announcing the partnership.</p>
<p>GG.Bet will be sponsoring the Regional Qualifiers, taking place September 3-17, the Last Chance Qualifier between October 8-12, and the Group Stage happening October 15 through 18. PGL CEO Silviu Stroie commented that PGL is “delighted that GG.Bet has become the first official betting partner for the first three stages of this year’s The International.”</p>
<p>GG.Bet CEO Dmitry Voshkarin also expressed the company’s delight at the solidified partnership with PGL, saying that this is also “an incredible opportunity for GG.Bet,” while also reminding us that is not the first sponsorship deal between the League and GG.Bet. However, it does mark a great milestone in the League’s history. On its part, GG.Bet will be working with esports influencers to create exclusive TI content, with upcoming videos, predictions, reviews and more, to be offered to fans and spectators.</p>
<p>GG.Bet Trusted Key Betting Partner</p>
<p>PGL Events and GG.Bet go a way back, with the pair extending their partnership back in April, with GG.Bet responsible for distributing esports events for PGL. Back then, the deal was signed just ahead of the PGL Regional Major Rankings events that then took place April 11 through 24.</p>
<p>This September announcement is the third month in a row where GG.Bet has been in the headlines with its partnerships. In July, GG.Bet was the exclusive betting partner for the PGL Major Arlington 2022 event, making it the second major PGL event for the Dota 2021/2022 season that GG.Bet was part of. It took place April 11 through 24.</p>
<p>Filling in the gap between the two PGL partnerships in July and this September one, was the August announcement of GG.Bet becoming Team Vitality’s (a CS:GO team) international betting partner. As per the agreement, Team Vitality’s player jerseys and social media channels will be carrying GG.BET’s branding for what remains of Season 2022, as well as for Season 2023.</p>
<p>GG.Bet is probably the strongest contender for the title of best esports betting brand in Canada, and with good reason. It has the trust of multiple teams, spanning multiple games and major tournaments.</p>
