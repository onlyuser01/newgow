    <h1>Cherokee Valley River Casino And Hotel San Bernardino Casino Black Hawk Colorado Casino Hotels Hardr</h1>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have had an unpleasant experience with Casoo casino too.</p>
<p>My winnings of $500 were not paid due unfair rules and false accusations.</p>
<p>I played "Summer Holiday" game with minimum bet of $1 .</p>
<p>They claimed I bet $20 while still wagering and on bonus.</p>
<p>I was certain I never bet $20 , simply cause I can't afford to, they even sent me screen shots of my high bets ! still I was not convinced.</p>
<p>Finally , I realized that maximum bet on above slot is $10 maximum ( not $20 ) unlike what they alleged, plus the history of my playing on that particular day disappeared one day later. They were happy to accuse me of frustration, they were even more twisted while announcing there final decision , no payments, do what you wish, complain to Casino Guru or any other casino body.</p>
<p>The summer Holiday game gives you the chance to replay the 15 free spins if you want, I did not impose it or fiddled with it, these are the game rules, : replay free spins, accepts the winnings or chose a mystery cash surprise in a box. I chose replay free spins.</p>
<p>Play at your own risk with certain casinos.</p>
<p>I have all the screenshots, emails and details, but I decided not to waste any more of my time on this. I never shared with with any Social media or press as I initially intended.</p>
<p>I believe the negativity and the false accusations will end up causing many players to play elsewhere.</p>
<p>I don"t care, they can keep my $500.</p>
<p>Regards.</p>
<p>Brillon.</p>
