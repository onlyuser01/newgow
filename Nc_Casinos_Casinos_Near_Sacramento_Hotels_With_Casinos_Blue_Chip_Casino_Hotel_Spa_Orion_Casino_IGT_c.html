<p>The gaming company powering lotteries and sports betting operators, International Game Technology (IGT), announced a new deal, allowing it to expand its innovative portfolio of content in Canada. The company revealed last week that its high-performing omnichannel Powerbucks games, as well as engaging and popular MegaJackpots games, are expanding in the country via a partnership with the Alberta Gaming, Liquor and Cannabis (AGLC) for its online gaming website, PlayAlberta.ca.</p>
<p>The latest launch helps IGT solidify its presence in Canada and allows its MegaJackpots and Powerbucks games to be available coast-to-coast across Canada, which is an important market within the North American region. Thanks to the launch, eligible players in Alberta can tap into exciting jackpots via popular games such as Wheel of Fortune Ruby Riches, Powerbucks Wheel of Fortune Exotic Far East, as well as MegaJackpots Cleopatra and Wolf Run.</p>
<p>The launch represents an important achievement for IGT as it expands further its high-performing omnichannel games to new audiences. At the same time, the collaboration helps deliver thrilling and engaging options for AGLC's customers.</p>
<p>David Flinn, IGT's SVP, Canada, South and Central America, shared his excitement in a statement. "IGT is thrilled to expand our wildly successful Powerbucks network to AGLC, now delivering the excitement of these omnichannel WAP jackpot games to players across all Canadian jurisdictions where online gaming is legal and regulated," he said.</p>
<p>Last but not least, Flinn pointed out: "AGLC players will have even more opportunities to win big rewards with the launch of IGT PlayDigital's MegaJackpots games featuring top-performing IGT themes. For AGLC, our wide area progressive games help differentiate its online casino, drive growth and provide the ultimate player experiences."</p>
<p>The recent partnership helps expand the reach of MegaJackpots, which is IGT PlayDigital's exclusive digital wide area progressive jackpot (WAP) network. On the other hand, the deal helps expand the global footprint of Powerbucks, which is known as the first omnichannel WAP game in the world that connects jackpots between machines from land-based venues with its online gambling counterparts.</p>
<p>The latest collaboration comes on the heels of another important partnership between IGT and AGLC. Earlier this month, the duo confirmed they joined forces for the replacement of 2,600 legacy Video Lottery Terminals (VLTs).</p>
<p>Per that deal, IGT confirmed it will replace those VLTs with "modern, high-performing IGT CrystalDual 27 VLTs featuring this new, in-demand game content." In other words, IGT's latest collaboration involving the delivery of Powerbucks games and MegaJackpots games helps further solidify its partnership with the AGLC, while bringing exciting experiences for the customers in the province.</p>
