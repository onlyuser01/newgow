<p>Offering the widest variety of content is key to ensuring that NuxGame’s operator partners are able to attract new players, a representative said</p>
<p>NuxGame, a leading provider of betting and gaming software, has strengthened its iGaming offering thanks to a new agreement. The company announced that it will onboard slots from FC FA Chai Gaming, diversifying its product library.</p>
<p>FC FA Chai Gaming’s captivating games will be integrated into NuxGame’s online casino offering, helping it boost its partners’ retention rates and audience reach. The new addition will also make NuxGame’s products more appealing to potential new operator partners.</p>
<p>FC FA Chai Gaming is best known for pioneering impressive slot games inspired and influenced by Asia. Its titles have distinct themes and atmospheres, helping the studio differentiate itself from its competitors. As a result, the integration will benefit NuxGame, strengthening its vast content provision with exceptional games.</p>
<p>Under the deal, NuxGame’s aggregation solution will be enhanced with over forty premium iGaming titles, including slots and arcades. These include player favorites such as Star Hunter, Money Tree Dozer and Chinese New Year, among many others.</p>
<p>The partnership agreement follows similar deals with other developers, including RubyPlay and Pascal Gaming, both of which injected games into NuxGame in May. The development is in line with NuxGame’s goal to continuously enhance its content library.</p>
<p>Content Is Very Important to NuxGame</p>
<p>Bar Konson, NuxGame’s head of sales and business development, commented on the agreement and highlighted the importance of content to his company. He explained that NuxGame is always seeking new content that will make its solutions more appealing to its operator partners and their players.</p>
<p>Offering the widest variety of content is key to ensuring our operator partners can attract new players and retain those already utilizing their platform. Bar Konson, head of sales and business development, NuxGame</p>
<p>Konson said that his team is delighted to join forces with FC FA Chai Gaming, praising the company for its cutting-edge games. He concluded that NuxGame’s team cannot wait to see how its partners and end customers react to the new content.</p>
<p>We are pleased to be working with FC FA Chai Gaming as it has a wide array of titles that are as entertaining as they are engaging, and we look forward to seeing the reception they receive from our clients and their playerbases. Bar Konson, head of sales and business development, NuxGame</p>
