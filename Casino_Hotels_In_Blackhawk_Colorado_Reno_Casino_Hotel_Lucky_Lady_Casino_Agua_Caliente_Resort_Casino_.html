    <h1>Casino Hotels In Blackhawk Colorado Reno Casino Hotel Lucky Lady Casino Agua Caliente Resort Casino</h1>

<p>A verification is not necessary because it was done at the beginning with the Schufa query. According to the employee's statement, the payment could therefore be made.</p>
<p>I have already made the 3 withdrawal request for 2 weeks, as they always wait 3-4 days and then get canceled for some strange reason. I know this from other dubious casinos, because with the method time is gained to persuade the player to continue gambling and lose everything. The reason was allegedly I had inserted spaces in the Iban, which is why the transfer could not be made.</p>
<p>I made extra scrrenshots to prove that there are no empty spots. So far it looks like a very dubious casino, as experience from the past shows, for example, that reputable casinos also transfer higher amounts within 24 hours. E.g. europacasino.</p>
<p>I will be patient a little longer and will report further. But I assume that it will be canceled again with any excuses.</p>
