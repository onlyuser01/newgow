    <h1>Turning Stone Online Casino Angel Of The Wind Casino Embassy Suites San Juan Hotel Casino Isle Of Ca</h1>

<p>Dear Christian,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint through our website. I’m very sorry to hear that you didn’t succeed to withdraw any of the winnings that you have accumulated during the bonus play. I checked the General Bonus T&amp;Cs, and this is what I found:</p>
<p>"10. The maximum allowable single bet with a bonus (until the wagering requirements are met) are:</p>
<p>Slots and Video Slots - $ 5 per bet or currency equivalent to $ 5.</p>
<p>Any other game - $ 30 per bet or equivalent in currency equivalent to $ 30.</p>
<p>Failure to comply with the rule may result in the removal of the winnings. "</p>
<p>I understand that you would prefer if the casino didn’t allow you to bet more than a maximum allowed bet during the bonus play, but, unfortunately, this is not a common practice. The system that accompanies every withdrawal and verification is not automated, and it might take few days. This is what happened in your case. You were not stopped or blocked when you have decided to increase your bet.</p>
<p>Sadly, there is not much I can do, to support your case at this time. I would strongly recommend reading all the T&amp;Cs carefully before you start playing to avoid any misunderstandings in the future. Casinos try to design their bonuses to be as attractive as possible, but the rules must always be followed. If you could specify for me which bonus did you play, and send me a link, that would help me to double-check all the relevant T&amp;Cs. Thank you very much in advance.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
