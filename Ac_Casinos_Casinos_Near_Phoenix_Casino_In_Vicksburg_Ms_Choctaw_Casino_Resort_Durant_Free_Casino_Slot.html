<p>The Irish-based sportsbook that operates in the UK and Ireland has strengthened its ties with the leading odds comparison platform, bringing its betting offers and odds found in odds comparison tables on all of oddschecker’s sporting event pages. The odds will be available on both desktop and mobile.</p>
<p>QuinnBet Will Be a Part of oddschecker’s Mobile App</p>
<p>The new partnership agreement will also see QuinnBet be incorporated by oddschecker’s mobile app. This will allow bettors to compare odds on the most popular sporting events in the UK and Ireland. The list includes soccer, tennis, golf, and horse racing, to name a few.</p>
<p>oddchecker’s managing director Jamie Pinner called QuinnBet a “valued partner” and a “great asset” to their platform. Pinner added that they were delighted to introduce their odds, product, and offerings to their own audience while expressing eagerness to keep working together with QuinnBet. The MD also explained that the new contract expansion is expected to help oddschecker reach “strong growth” in 2023 and from then onwards.</p>
<p>“The Partnership Makes Sense” for QuinnBet</p>
<p>The online sportsbook’s managing director Stephen Kelly called oddschecker “one of the top betting comparison platforms out there”. Accordingly, Kelly explained that the new partnership extension “makes sense” for them while expressing delight to keep working with their “great partner”.</p>
<p>Kelly also added that QuinnBet currently has “some of the most competitive odds” on the market, with special emphasis on a number of all-time bettor favorites including UK and Irish soccer and horse racing.</p>
<p>Established in 2017, QuinnBet specializes in offering betting options and odds on thousands of different markets on a weekly basis, covering both in-play and pre-match alternatives from a wide plethora of sports. The company also hosts a large number of Casino and Live Casino options, along with a dedicated Lottery product as a result of its integration with Lottoland at the end of 2018.</p>
<p>QuinnBet also aims to offer unique and fair customer incentives and the new agreement is meant to help it prove the “excellent value” that its customers can achieve when betting with them.</p>
<p>oddschecker is one of the leading odds comparison platforms in the industry and also a highly-appreciated sports betting destination used by millions of users. The iGaming publishing group hosts a versatile portfolio of products and it is backed by more than 200 experts based all over the world.</p>
