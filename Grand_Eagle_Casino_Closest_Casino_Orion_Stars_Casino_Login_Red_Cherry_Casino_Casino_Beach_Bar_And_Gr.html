<p>The online gambling exchange company Betfair has secured a strong representative in the face of the English National Hunt jockey Bryony Frost. Frost will join Betfair’s roster of brand ambassadors and will propagate the company’s brand.</p>
<p>Frost Joins Betfair’s Roster of Ambassadors</p>
<p>The deal will see the prominent jockey featured on Betfair’s racing podcasts, including the recently launched Cheltenham Roarcast, Weighed-In and Racing Only Bettor. Furthermore, each week Frost will share her thoughts on the latest developments in horseracing on Betting.Betfair’s site.</p>
<p>A promotional video shared on Betfair’s official social media reminds fans of Frost’s impressive horseracing achievements. Not only is she the first female jockey to win first place in King George VI Chase but she also boasts over 200 victories throughout her career including 6 grade one wins. In 2018 and 2019 Frost received the champion conditional jockey title, attesting to her skills.</p>
<p>As one of the gambling exchange’s ambassadors, Frost will join the likes of the 12-time champion trainer Paul Nicholls, the two-time champion jockey Ryan Moore and other horseracing experts such as Kate Tracey, Kevin Blake, Tony Calvin and Vanessa Ryle.</p>
<p>Betfair Is Delighted to Have Frost on Board</p>
<p>Laura-Jane O’Shea, the chief executive officer of Betfair, welcomed Frost to the Betfair family. O’Shea is delighted to have such an experienced athlete join the ranks of the company’s ambassadors.</p>
<p>O’Shea believes that Betfair and Frost share a lot of similarities, with both being innovators in their respective fields – just as Frost is a leading jockey, Betfair operates the world’s largest online betting exchange. The CEO added that she admires Frost’s work ethic and sense of play – more qualities that reflect Betfair’s vision.</p>
<p>O’Shea said that she is excited to have Frost on board and is sure that she will create amazing content that will not only help Betfair’s customers but will help to represent horseracing to the wider public and show how great of a sport it is.</p>
<p>Frost revealed that she is thrilled to join Betfair as a brand ambassador:</p>
<p>“I’m super excited to become a Betfair brand ambassador. This is a very important part of the season with all the spring racing festivals fast approaching and we have some really exciting plans over the coming months.” English National Hunt jockey Bryony Frost</p>
<p>With ambassadors as strong as Frost, Betfair will seek to grow its brand and reach new markets. The company experienced some setbacks in 2021 as it had to leave the Dutch market prior to the launch of the new regulations introduced by the Kansspelautoriteit. Not all is grim, however, as Betfair managed to conquer some new markets as well.</p>
