<p>Atlantis Thunder: St Patrick’s Day review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>It is wildly unclear what was going through the heads of Kalamba’s executive’s when they greenlit this Saint Paddy’s Day themed sequel to Atlantis Thunder.</p>
<p>While both Ireland and Atlantis are beautiful lands obscured by the mists and tides of the North Atlantic, one of them is an actual member of the EU and the other is a totally mythical sunken nation.</p>
<p>However, in Atlantis Thunder: St. Patrick’s Day, Neptune has donned a green top hat, all the sharks are knocking back Tullamore, and there are no sea snakes in the Atlantic.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The graphics are top notch. Well drawn and well animated, though perhaps a little cold and characterless.</p>
<p>Additionally, the reels do obscure the background in an odd way, since from the little flashes of life in the ocean around the game it looks like a lot of effort went into animating the largely invisible backdrop.</p>
<p>The sound effects are solid and the orchestral and choral score is pretty immersive, evoking the slow drifting currents of the under-ocean world more than the lively Donnybrook that is St. Patrick’s Day.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>The game is an any ways win system played on reels arranged in a 3-4-5-5-4-3 pattern. Crunching those numbers gets you 3600 ways which offers you plenty of lines on which to catch yourself a fish.</p>
<p>On top of the base game there is also a system of progressive Jackpots which are won by hitting a combination of Jackpot (Poseidon) symbols and Wilds.</p>
<p>Ten or eleven of these symbols combined on one spin wins the Silver Jackpot, twelve or thirteen gets you the Gold Jackpot and the Platinum Jackpot goes to anyone who hits fourteen or more Wild and Jackpot symbols in one spin.</p>
<p>4% of each bet is split between the three jackpots.</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Bonus symbol.</p>
<p>Some Wild’s come with x2 or x3 modifiers; these count as two or three symbols respectively for the purposes of both winning combinations and for counting towards Jackpot wins.</p>
<p>Hitting three or more Bonus symbols triggers a free spin bonus game. Based on how many Bonus symbols you hit you can get 8 to 20 free spins, which can be retriggered.</p>
<p>During the free spins all Wilds have x2 or x3 multipliers attached.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The maximum return to player of this game is a hefty 97.73%.</p>
<p>The game’s publishers do not specify how the various features affect the return to player, however the most likely case is that the minimum return to player of 96.66% is for the base game played normally and the maximum return to player will be for buying straight into the highest value bonus round.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested was $/£/€0.60 to $/£/€300.00. Though if you buy into the bonus games, this could be a lot higher.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is medium-high, which means it can work with our preferred strategies.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Atlantis Thunder: St Patrick’s Day is a visual treat, but the seaweed might not be as green as it looks on first brush.</p>
<p>The return to player is decent at its lower end, and very appealing if at its highest end, but without clear publisher confirmation it is impossible to know what version of the game will hook that 97.73% RTP.</p>
<p>The progressive jackpots are a major appeal of this game and if jackpot style slots are your bag, this might be as good a slot as any to fulfil that. Otherwise, we would suggest you go fish in a different pond.</p>
