    <h1>Columbus Ohio Casino Mega Ball Casino San Pablo Lytton Casino Hotels Close To Seminole Hard Rock Cas</h1>

<p>March 2018 I asked for my account to be closed because I couldn't control myself. I went almost a year without gambling. I got an email from FJ for a bonus and decided to try to login. I am assuming it wasn't closed because I had no issues getting into the site. . For about a year and a half I gambled off and on until I went to rehab in 2021. I did well until January 2022. In two months, I lost $75,000. March 2022 I asked again for FJ to close my account. I begged them not to open it back up. I also reminded them that it should have already been closed. They have ignored my complaint about not closing my account in 2018. My account has stayed closed since March 2022. There were a lot of technical issues during the two months that roulette and craps bets would win, but then say bets not accepted. The money that was wagered would be taken or my whole bankroll would go to 0. I would have to beg them to look at their logs and see my bets were taken. It happened about 10 times and I had to fight every time. I'm still not sure I got everything I was owed. After I closed the account, I asked for them to make sure there was no money owed to me. They replied there wasn't but I was given logs and the money lost vs the money taken didn't balance. My emails were being ignored so I decided to look into complaining. I saw complaints about self exclusion and realized that they should have kept the account closed. I contacted them again about closing my account and they ignored what I was asking and made it like I was asking to open the account. I have sent numerous emails and have finally decided to complain. Even if it doesn't get resolved, people need to know. The games on the site are great, but technical issues, bad customer service and a lack of taking gambling addiction seriously negates any positive.</p>
