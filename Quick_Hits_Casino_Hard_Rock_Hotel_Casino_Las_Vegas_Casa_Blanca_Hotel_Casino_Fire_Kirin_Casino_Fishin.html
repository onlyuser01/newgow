    <h1>Quick Hits Casino Hard Rock Hotel Casino Las Vegas Casa Blanca Hotel Casino Fire Kirin Casino Fishin</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I can see that you are a affiliate for Robet (Robet247.com). I would like to point out one thing regarding this site.</p>
<p>For their casino games, slots, they have lowered the RTP for the most popular slots from the provider "PlayNGo" to 84%. RTP is the "Return to player", which is the teoretical return for a player calculated on indefinite spins more or less.</p>
<p>The standard RTP that is set for all casino games out there is around 94-98%, so this is a considerably high difference. If you were to deposit 100â‚¬ on a site with 84%, you would be able to play for around 100 spins. If you were to have 96% instead, you would be able to play for around 1000 spins instead.</p>
<p>The difference is HUGE, and this gives the casino such an edge that they'll almost guarantee EVERY single player will lose their deposit.</p>
<p>I would like to ask you to check this one out, and think about if it's worth to promote this scummy casino. There are loads of other out there that are fair &amp; square.</p>
<p>Below you find a screenshot, to be able to see the custom RTP set by Robet247.com, you have to filter the network log for requests to PlayNGo, and you will find what they have set. Usually you can find this information from within the game itself, but they have hidden that as well.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Adam</p>
