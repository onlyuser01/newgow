<p>Dear Betroom24 Team,</p>
<p>I can agree that every player should read the bonus T&amp;Cs thoroughly before they activate any bonuses and make sure to follow all the rules to avoid disappointments like this, however, as my colleague Petronela mentioned we believe that if players were rewarded with a bonus available freely in their account or on the website, they fulfilled all the bonus wagering requirements and they gained their winnings fairly then they should receive the winnings.</p>
<p>We have this mentioned in our Fair gambling codex:</p>
<p>The player's point of view</p>
<p>If a player can claim a casino bonus, they assume it's theirs to play with. They have no reason to think that they shouldn't have received the bonus in the first place. This is why it is often very startling when they run into withdrawal issues because of this rule and its improper implementation.</p>
<p>Our position and recommendations for casinos</p>
<p>Casinos should only give bonuses to players who are allowed to get them according to the Bonus T&amp;Cs. And if the casino makes the mistake of granting a bonus to a player who shouldn't have received it, the casino shouldn't take it away from them. Instead, the casino should accept that it was their mistake and pay out the winnings to the player.</p>
<p>If there was a warning pop-up window informing the players that they are not entitled to a certain bonus or to be eligible for the winnings from the bonus they must deposit at least 100â‚¬ in clean deposits during the last 7 days before claiming the Friday Reload bonus then we will agree with your decision, but as far as I know, this was not the case.</p>
<p>We kindly advise you to reconsider your decision Betroom24 Team and we will appreciate it if you could pay the player their winnings.</p>
