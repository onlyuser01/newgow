<p>Penn National Rallies After Analyst Lifts Price Target to Another Street High</p>

<p>Penn National Gaming (NASDAQ:PENN) is rallying anew today, helped by an impressive financial forecast and more sell-side enthusiasm.</p>

<p>In a note to clients today, Rosenblatt Securities analyst Bernie McTernan boosted his price forecast on the gaming company to $90, the highest on Wall Street. As of Sept. 9, McTernan didn’t even follow Penn. He initiated coverage of the stock on Sept. 10 with a “buy” rating and an $80 estimate, meaning that in the span of three weeks, his price projection increased 12.50 percent.</p>
<p>Our test of the Barstool app, a successful launch in Pennsylvania with minimal external marketing and growth in the second weekend, suggests a lower probability of our bear case playing out, and now greater focus on the bull case,” writes McTernan.</p>
<p>His $90 price target on Penn stock is $5 above the next-closest estimate, and implies upside of 25 percent from where the shares trade at this writing.</p>
<p>Plenty of Catalysts</p>
<p>After the close of US markets Tuesday, the operator of casinos under the Argosy and Hollywood brands, among others, told investors its third-quarter earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and restructuring or rent costs (EBITDAR) and revenue will exceed Wall Street forecasts.</p>
<p>Perhaps as important, if not more so, is that an investor presentation released by Penn shows the new Barstool Sportsbook mobile app posted a 14 percent handle increase in its second weekend after notching $11 million the week prior. That with the company not spending anything on external marketing.</p>
<p>It’s unlikely that $0 advertising figure will continue over the long-term. But Penn’s ability to lure bettors to the new app on a cost-efficient basis is something the investment community could reward because customer acquisition costs are high in the online sports betting space.</p>
<p>“We believe this was a successful launch in an already established, competitive market,” said Rosenblatt’s McTernan. “Importantly, PENN was able to achieve these results without spending on external marketing due to their content-driven customer acquisition strategy.”</p>
<p>Don’t Forget Old School Casinos</p>
<p>While Penn expects iGaming and sports wagering to have material impacts on its top and bottom lines next year, the company is a new player in these still-nascent industries. These businesses have a multi-year ramp up ahead, meaning the operator still needs to execute its core competency of running land-based casinos.</p>
<p>The aforementioned financial outlook confirms EBITDAR and margins at Penn’s regional properties are increasing, and the company’s Las Vegas exposure is confined to just two venues – a positive at a time when Sin City is scuffling.</p>
<p>“Preliminary results show revenue is returning to the regional casino business faster than expected and at higher incremental margins,” said McTernan.</p>
<p>Penn runs 41 gaming properties in 19 states with Illinois, Louisiana, and Ohio among its largest markets.</p>
