    <h1>South Lake Tahoe Casino Casinos In Phoenix Traverse City Casino Red River Comanche Casino Bit Of Gol</h1>

<p>I've asked to close my account several times and have always been ignored. I kept making payments, which annoyed me afterwards. Then I asked for self-exclusion again, got no answer again, I paid in again and the account was also credited. I won a bit, suddenly I can't continue playing because the account was closed. I think it's cheeky to let me deposit and then the account is closed. I want my money back .Hi,</p>

<p>I've written several emails to close my account, but you kept letting me deposit. I still have credit and I want it back, you are very dubious</p>
