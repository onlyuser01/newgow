    <h1>Silver Oak Casino No Deposit Bonus Casino In Wheeling Wv Tachi Palace Casino Harrah S Casino San Die</h1>

<p>I am still working with my bank for them to send me the transcription of the message that Bank of Nova Scotia sent them as to why the check could not be accepted. A month ago, this is what Ignition told me via email and that is when I started speaking to a person at my own bank to see if I can get the information.</p>

<p>Hi Wendi,</p>
<p>Thanks for contacting Ignition Casino Customer Service.</p>
<p>We're sorry about the issues with your check. What we can offer is a Stop Payment to return the funds to your</p>
<p>Bovada account. Placing a stop payment on your check may include a $40 fee.</p>
<p>We won't issue another check as it may result in the same issues.</p>
<p>If you want to proceed with the Stop Payment, reply to this email with pictures of both sides of the</p>
<p>check with the word VOIDED o r a letter of the bank with the reject reason and we will process your</p>
<p>request. We can discuss other withdrawal options you may use once the funds are returned to your</p>
<p>Bovada account.</p>
<p>So they totally know this is an issue and obviously have encountered it before. I'm hoping once I can submit to them eveidence of this being their bank's issue, perhaps they will be open to another way of sending the funds.</p>
<p>Thanks again for your help!</p>
