    <h1>Las Vegas Casino Online Cherokee Nc Hotels Near Casino Golden Pony Casino Casino Shelbyville Riverro</h1>

<p>In light of the global COVID-19 pandemic, cashless solutions are making their way to more casinos. While it is unlikely to replace cash and chips completely any time soon, the new cashless solutions are gaining more popularity and offer unique features for both operators and patrons.</p>
<p>Boyd Launches Cashless Table Game Trial with Aristocrat</p>
<p>Aristocrat Gaming, part of the global games leader Aristocrat Leisure, together with Boyd Gaming announced on Wednesday the successful launch of a cashless payment solution for table games. The new solution, Boyd Pay Wallet, is powered by Aristocrat’s digital wallet technology and the field trial is being conducted in partnership with Genesis Gaming.</p>
<p>The field trial of Boyd Pay Wallet is taking place at Boyd Gaming’s Aliante Casino Hotel and Spa in Las Vegas, Nevada. By integrating into Boyd Gaming’s B Connected app, Boyd Pay Wallet will allow players to use their mobile devices to fund table games without the need to withdraw cash, redeem chips or tickets at the cages.</p>
<p>The Cashless Solution Offers Unique Functionalities, Reduces Risk</p>
<p>Once a table game player logs securely into the B Connected app, they can use the Boyd Pay Wallet to buy into the game and use traditional casino chips to play. Once the player decides to end their play, they can either collect the casino chips or use the app to transfer their funds directly to the cashless Boyd Pay Wallet and there’s no need for the player to visit a cage.</p>
<p>Moreover, Oasis 360 casino management system with TrackIT that is powered by Genesis enables players to wager using a QR code generated by Boyd Pay whenever a gaming session is started. This system also allows player redemption by using Boyd Pay Wallet which further enhances the cashless experience.</p>
<p>By seamlessly integrating TrackIT, Boyd’s digital player club card, Boyd’s mobile app and Boyd’s digital wallet, the operator can view the player’s activity. At the same time, this unique integration reduces risk, as well as costs and supports responsible gambling.</p>
<p>Boyd Remains Focused on Adding More Cashless Solutions</p>
<p>Boyd Gaming’s SVP and chief information officer, Blake Rampmaier, outlined that Boyd Pay confirms the company’s commitment to enhance guest experiences through technology. He said that the company is focused on adding more cashless wagering and contactless solutions together with Aristocrat to “drive mobile innovation in a secure and exciting environment for our patrons.”</p>
<p>“Boyd Pay is another example of our commitment to leverage technology to enhance the guest experience at our properties.” Blake Rampmaier, SVP and chief information officer at Boyd Gaming</p>
<p>The trial for table games complements cashless technology which was previously introduced for slot players at Boyd Gaming properties. The company has launched the cashless technology for slot players within its properties in Nevada, Indiana, Ohio and Pennsylvania. Moreover, guests in Nevada properties can also enjoy cashless payment solutions for non-gaming amenities.</p>
<p>Aristocrat Gaming’s executive vice president of customer experience solutions, Cath Burns, said that improving the guest journey through innovation is a main goal for the company. She added that Aristocrat remains committed to delivering best-in-class experiences for the operators, as well as guests via this innovative cashless technology.</p>
