<p>Information about Giropay casinos</p>
<p>Giropay is a German online payment system that lets customers safely buy products on the internet via direct transfers from their bank account. Many customers choose Giropay thanks to its simple method, which is similar to payment systems Secure Vault and Interac in the United States and Canada respectively.</p>
<p>Many online casinos have Giropay as a payment method and, if you're looking for one of those, it's crucial that you find a safe option. This page will help you do that, with information about each Giropay online casino, how to use Giropay once you've registered, and the bonuses offered by those casinos.</p>

<p>Giropay: Germany's leading online payment method</p>
<p>Deutsche Bank is the biggest bank in Germany, and it was from their retail arm, Postbank, that Giropay was founded in February 2006. Their purpose was simple: to provide a secure payment service to serve the growing online market.</p>
<p>It was a smart move. By May of the following year, Giropay users had put more than 100 million euros through the service. This had nearly doubled to €185 million the year after, and today Giropay processes over a million transfers a month.</p>
<p>The main reason for their success is their commitment to real-time instant transfers. Users can be confident that their money reaches the merchant straight away, which allows for the quick shipment of their item, or activation of a service.</p>
<p>Transfers are also extremely secure — they have to go through the user's bank to get permission: this often takes the form of two-factor authentication (2FA), or PIN-based access, and means that no bank details are shared with the merchant. Giropay also follows strict data protection rules and vows that all data transfers are SSL encrypted.</p>
<p>Giropay is recognized as a leading internet payment method today, reaching millions of German and Austrian users and serving the majority of the online market in the two countries.</p>
<p>Pros and cons of Giropay</p>
<p>Giropay users benefit from the tight security features mentioned previously. By simply acting as a conduit between the bank and merchant, they let the user's bank deal with the primary security process, and employ SSL encryption and data protection once the transfer takes place.</p>
<p>Their service is also free of charge for the customer. Giropay make their money from charging the merchant fees, so you won't have to pay a cent — the only fees you'll need to consider are those imposed by your bank, so it's worth checking these out before making the transfer.</p>
<p>You can also count on your payment arriving immediately — a great advantage if you're looking to play casino games right away. Giropay also offer customer support if the recipient claims not to have received the money: their online statement is legal proof of the transfer, and they offer help to the customer in the event of a dispute.</p>
<p>If you're based outside Germany and Austria, however, then Giropay isn't available to you unfortunately. This is a shame, as many more users could benefit from their quality service, but there are providers in other countries who offer similar methods.</p>
<p>Another slight negative is that payments are only guaranteed up to a certain amount. While this is subject to change in the future, it does mean that transferring a large amount via Giropay carries an element of risk: in fact, Giropay don't offer buyer protection, so if something does go wrong, you won't be covered.</p>
<p>Using Giropay in an online casino</p>
<p>Giropay's secure instant transfers are a great way to deposit money into an online casino, and, once you've found the best casino for you, you'll need to know how to make a payment and start playing.</p>
<p>To deposit money into a Giropay casino, it's necessary to open an account both there and with Giropay, if you haven't already done so — normally this only takes a few minutes for either registration.</p>
<p>When you're good to go, go to the casino's cashier and choose the Giropay payment option and the amount you wish to deposit, You'll then have to select your bank, which will take you to their login page, where you have to pass the security process.</p>
<p>Once everything is accepted, the casino should get the funds immediately, making them appear in your casino balance instantly. Now all that's left is for you to start playing your favourite games!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Giropay withdrawals aren't as easy to process. While it's possible to do so by following a similar procedure to above, not all Giropay casinos offer this option. For those that do, it's possible that you'll incur charges and the process could take several days.</p>
<p>Choosing the best Giropay casino for you</p>
