<p>Online gaming software distributor for the sports betting, casino, affiliate, and payment fields EveryMatrix has been given the green light to operate in West Virginia. The supplier first applied for a license in the state in December 2021, when it also tried to secure a Michigan license.</p>
<p>What Will the New License Mean for EveryMatrix?</p>
<p>As per the terms of the new license issued by the West Virginie Lottery Commission, the company will be able to supply its in-house gaming content developed by its talented teams at Spearhead Studios and Armadillo Studios to interested operators in the state. This will be accomplished through the supplier’s own integration platform for casinos called CasinoEngine. The engine will help EveryMatrix smoothly integrate its top-tier content and turn-key gaming solutions, expanding its reach in the country.</p>
<p>At the moment, the company is busy getting ready to go live by setting up a series of hosting venues and certifying all of its products. Its gamification services will enable operators to use a number of different configurations for managing their jackpots while adding more alternatives to standard sports betting scenarios.</p>
<p>The company’s Americas president Erik Nyman added that EveryMatrix also applied for additional state licenses in other regulated US markets for gaming and sports betting. He expressed his content and excitement about their efforts paying off while anticipating several deals with “large US operators” about to come to an agreement in the near future.</p>
<p>It Takes Time and Dedication</p>
<p>Nyman also acknowledged that becoming the number one provider of iGaming services for the North American market is a time-consuming process that requires a lot of patience and dedication. The new license for the Mountain State is just another small milestone in this direction, as was the case with the company’s investment in Jelly Entertainment, a new gaming studio purchased in March.</p>
<p>At the beginning of April, the supplier of gaming technology and content announced a new partnership deal with STRABAG Real Estate that would help it expand its development hub in Romania. The company also released JackpotEngine, a fresh product for its casino market just in time for the ICE London in April. Last May, EveryMatrix spread the news about its new ties with Swedish company LL Lucky Games AB.</p>
<p>During Q4 2021 as well as throughout the entire year, the provider reported a 26% growth in gross profit and a 23% rise in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization compared to 2020.</p>
