<p>No Casino in Petaluma, California till 2032 Under Deal with Dry Creek Pomo</p>

<p>The deal thrashed out with casino-averse Sonoma County officials, was done after the county agreed to waive its annual $750,000 payment from the tribe for 2020 and 2021.</p>
<p>The tribe has a revenue-share deal with the county for its River Rock Casino on its reservation near Geyserville, 45 miles north of Petaluma. But the casino was closed for two and a half months at the beginning of the pandemic, leading to considerable revenue loss.</p>
<p>The tribe’s ownership of 300 acres of land just south of Petaluma has long made residents jumpy. It has the right to establish a second casino resort in Sonoma County, the heart of California’s wine country, per an agreement with the state.</p>
<p>In 2005, it applied to the federal government to have the land taken into trust for gaming purposes. It has since suspended the application. But some locals remain uneasy that a casino remains a long-term goal.</p>
<p>Strategic Advantage</p>
<p>The River Rock has suffered since the 2013 opening of the Graton Casino Resort in Rohnert Park, which was also fiercely opposed by Sonoma County officials and local residents.</p>
<p>Owned by the Federated Band of Graton Rancheria, it’s the biggest casino in northern California, and cuts footfall to the River Rock from the Bay Area. A Petaluma casino would allow the Dry Creek Pomo to leapfrog the Graton Casino and potentially reconnect with that traffic.</p>
<p>The first deal between the Dry Creek Pomo and Sonoma County officials to stave off a casino came in 2006, shortly after Petaluma residents voted by an eighty percent majority to oppose the tribe’s plan.</p>
<p>The tribe and the county signed a memorandum of understanding that resolved several legal disputes related to the River Rock while nixing a casino in Petaluma until 2016.</p>
<p>‘No Plans for Petaluma Casino’</p>
<p>In 2015, a new agreement extended the prohibition to 2025. The River Rock was suffering the impact from the Graton resort, and the tribe was only too happy to sign a deal that reduced its payments to the county from $3.5 million per year to a minimum of $750,000. The 2015 deal would save the tribe tens of millions over the ensuing decade.</p>
<p>The tribe’s chairman Chris Wright, who does not typically speak to the press, said in 2015 there were no plans for a casino on the Petaluma plot. Among other things, it would be too difficult to get approval, he explained.</p>
