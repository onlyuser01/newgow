<p>Playson has released quite a few Egyptian-themed games over the years, giving players a thrilling gambling experience each time. Its latest release, Luxor Gold: Hold and Win sees the supplier go back to Egypt and give fans another taste of an iGaming staple. In our latest interview, Playson Product Owner, Anton Ivannikov explains the strength of Egyptian-themed titles and how Playson continues reinventing its product offering.</p>
<p>Your latest Hold and Win game see Playson head back to Egypt, can you explain why Egyptian-themed games have such an enduring appeal to players?</p>
<p>It’s no secret that the Egyptian theme has been hugely successful, not only in iGaming but across the entertainment industry. The theme has never failed to impress customers, with its magical allure, vibrant colors, and historical context making it very appealing to a wide range of consumers.</p>
<p>The theme of ancient Egypt has always been associated with various kinds of mysticism, adventure and of course, wealth – all of which can be seen in our latest release, Luxor Gold: Hold and Win. In the search for Luxor’s Gold, players will find themselves immersed in an atmosphere of luxury, with the title’s thrilling gameplay providing a sense of adventure.</p>
<p>With so many Egyptian-themed games on the market, how does a supplier like Playson keep things fresh?</p>
<p>While there are a lot of Egyptian-themed games on the market, we’re proud to say that our new title will still set us apart from the rest. It’s also unique to us, as it is the first classic Hold and Win game that uses the Egyptian design.</p>
<p>It’s important to give players something new, especially when you’re offering them a very familiar product. Even though the theme is the same, Luxor Gold: Hold and Win features an enthralling blend of audio-visuals including a range of distinct-looking symbols that give fans a fresh concept.</p>
<p>Additionally, our tried and tested Free Spins mode naturally elevates the title’s offering further, with the exciting mode rewarding players by utilizing only the highest paying symbols.</p>
<p>What are the titles’ standout features and are there any you wish to highlight?</p>
<p>It’s definitely our brilliant Treasure Chest feature, which lends players a helping hand by providing additional Bonus symbols to help them unlock the Bonus Game. With the inclusion of this feature, we’ve enhanced the title’s game modes, providing players with an alternative Hold and Win gaming experience.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Bonus Game equally delivers an elevated experience, with Mystery symbols producing huge in-game jackpots, giving players the chance to win a mouth-watering win worth 5,000x.</p>
<p>Will this game have a tournament or promotion to celebrate its release?</p>
<p>Last week we ran a Mysteries of Luxor B2B tournament available only to our partners, which gave the winner a two-person tour to Luxor in Egypt! We thought it’d be great to give people the chance to experience what makes the Egyptian theme such an attractive prospect and learn what makes the city of Luxor so iconic.</p>
<p>We have an exciting second half of the year planned with a host of captivating network promotions scheduled, so you can definitely expect Luxor Gold: Hold &amp; Win to be included in upcoming promotions. We’ll be introducing a breakthrough promotion that features a staggering prize pool in August, so make sure you keep your eyes on our socials.</p>
<p>Can you explain the success behind your Hold and Win titles?</p>
<p>The Hold and Win mechanic is clear and simple, making it easy to understand for a wide range of players, which allows different levels of consumers to enjoy them. Moreover, when you combine the simplicity of the mechanic with some cool features, it’s no surprise that these titles produce great engagement figures. This well-thought-out offering also keeps the rhythm of these games suitable for short mobile play sessions which is very important in this day and age.</p>
