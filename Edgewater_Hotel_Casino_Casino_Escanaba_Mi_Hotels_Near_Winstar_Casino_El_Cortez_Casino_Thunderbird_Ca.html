<p>Checkd Group, a collective of social media communities and products created by sports fans, announced a new addition to its ranks with the appointment of Dan Broda as Senior Product Manager.</p>
<p>‘The Right Person to Oversee Our Operations’</p>
<p>New Senior Product Manager Broda will be responsible for overseeing the deployment of the products developed by the group’s Checkd Dev division among which the rebuilt and proofed Sky Sports Fantasy Football platform in October last year.</p>
<p>Commenting on the appointment, Checkd Group managing director Adam Patton emphasized the importance of the “pivotal moment” that could define the group’s growth and the future of the sports betting industry as a whole, with the wave of sports wagering rollout in the US and developments on the group’s home market on his mind.</p>
<p>“The appointment of Dan, with his extensive background and industry knowledge, is a further sign of our growth ambitions around product development. In building on excellent foundations, we believe Dan is the right person to oversee our operations.” Adam Patton, Managing Director, Checkd Group</p>
<p>A former product owner at Sharp Gaming, Broda brings a wealth of industry experience to Checkd, gained at popular brands such as Coral and bet365. At the Entain-owned brand, Broda served as a racing trader, while at the Stoke-on-Trent-headquartered gambling operator he worked as a business analyst.</p>
<p>Eyeing US Sports Betting Market</p>
<p>Commenting on his new role, Broda paid tribute to Checkd Group’s “deserved reputation” of delivering products built around an “intimate knowledge” of the community of sports bettors to meet the needs of that community.</p>
<p>“With the US launch around the corner, this is a fascinating time to be joining an ambitious and fast-growing company and I look forward to helping delivering the best possible products to our customers and partners worldwide.” Dan Broda, Senior Product Manager, Checkd Group</p>
<p>Broda, as much as everyone at Checkd Group, is eyeing the lucrative sports betting market across the Atlantic and the opportunity for growth it represents.</p>
<p>Alongside developing new solutions for its high-profile media partners, the group’s Dev division is working on creating the products necessary for Checkd’s entry into US gaming jurisdictions, utilizing partnerships with tier-one operators.</p>
<p>While the group has been working hard to build products for its UK home market that will resonate with its audience and generate traffic, it has just launched a new US-centric sports betting website.</p>
<p>Earlier in the month, Checkd Group announced its nominations for the upcoming Digital City Awards 2022 in the categories Digital Marketing Campaign of the Year and Best Medium Digital Company.</p>
