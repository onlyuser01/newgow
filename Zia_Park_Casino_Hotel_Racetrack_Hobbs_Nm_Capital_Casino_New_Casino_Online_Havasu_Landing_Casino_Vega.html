<p>LAS VEGAS – Tens of thousands of gaming industry executives and officials are expected to converge on the Sands Expo and Convention Center this week for the Global Gaming Expo (G2E) 2019, which started Monday.</p>

<p>The annual industry trade show, presented by the American Gaming Association, comes at a time when the US gaming industry is going through an expansion period. While some states are focusing just on sports betting (see below), other states are looking to gaming to shore up finances, or simply just keep up with the Joneses, as their neighboring states expand or introduce new forms of gaming.</p>
<p>In addition to keynote speakers and discussion panels on such topics as tribal gaming, security, marketing, gaming leadership, and sports betting, the Sands exhibit hall will feature more than 380 booths from various vendors, including gaming technology companies, from around the world.</p>
<p>Last year’s G2E attracted more than 27,000 attendees and exhibitors.</p>
<p>Christie Headlines G2E Keynotes</p>
<p>Three star-studded keynote speakers have been lined up for this year’s Expo.</p>
<p>On Oct. 15, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie will talk about how his state challenged the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act and eventually won its case before the Supreme Court. That decision has set off a seismic change in the US gaming industry, as all 50 states are now able to legalize sports betting.</p>
<p>Currently, 13 states allow sports betting in some form. In addition, at least five other states, plus the District of Columbia, are in the implementation stages, and other states are still discussing legislation or awaiting a voter referendum next month.</p>
<p>National Hockey League Commissioner Gary Bettman will headline a panel Wednesday that examines how professional sports leagues like the NHL partner with sportsbooks and other gaming entities. Joining Bettman on the dais will be Joe Asher, CEO of William Hill’s US operations; Greg Carlin, CEO and co-founder of Rush Street Gaming, and Matt King, FanDuel’s CEO.</p>
<p>With so many new partnerships between leagues, teams, and gaming entities, it will be invaluable to hear the insights of our converging industries represented on a single stage,” said Bill Miller, AGA president and CEO.</p>
<p>Former race car driver Danica Patrick will deliver Thursday’s keynote, where she will talk about her transition from professional athlete to business professional and entrepreneur.</p>
<p>NCRG Wrap-Up</p>
<p>As G2E was getting underway Monday, a two-day conference on responsible gaming and addiction was winding down at the Sands.</p>
<p>The National Center for Responsible Gaming’s (NCRG) Conference on Gambling and Addiction was held in conjunction with G2E. Panel discussions held during the conference included a review of the National Gambling Impact Study Commission’s 1999 report and the need for online interventions for individuals with gambling and drinking problems.</p>
<p>Attendees also learned about the challenges new forms of gambling, such as eSports, are having on assessments and treatments. They also learned about a diversion court that’s been established in Nevada specifically to help those with gambling addiction avoid going to jail.</p>
<p>In addition, the group announced that starting in January, it will change its name to the International Center for Responsible Gaming, reflecting the true scope of the research into gambling addiction.</p>
