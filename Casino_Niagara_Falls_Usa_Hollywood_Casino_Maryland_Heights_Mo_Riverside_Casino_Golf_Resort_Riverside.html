<p>NASDAQ-listed digital gaming and sports entertainment company DraftKings has decided to expand its relationship with the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation. The two have agreed to bring DraftKings’s retail and online sports betting verticals to the people of Puerto Rico. The two products first need to be subject to a series of legal approvals and licenses prior to receiving the green light. The news follows DraftKings and Foxwoods’ launch of online gaming and sports betting products in Connecticut last October.</p>
<p>DraftKings’ Retail Sportsbook Will Open in the Upcoming Weeks</p>
<p>At the beginning of the year, Foxwoods and the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation announced their grand reopening plans for the mesmerizing El San Juan Casino. The new place will be called the “Foxwoods El San Juan Casino” and the costs for its upgrade included resort enhancements worth $137.5 million, along with the reopening costs of the highly popular Tropicoro venue.</p>
<p>The new DraftKings sportsbook will be located inside the freshly redeveloped El San Juan Casino and it will officially open over the course of the next few weeks. The sportsbook is still pending approval for a series of licenses as well as legal approvals. However, once all approvals are received in full, the venue will host a large video wall, along with full dining and bar services, six kiosks for bettors, and two over-the-counter windows selling tickets.</p>
<p>DraftKings will also supply the people of Puerto Rico with its iconic daily fantasy sports alternatives that can be currently accessed from 44 US states and six countries worldwide.</p>
<p>DraftKings, Foxwoods, and the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation – the Winning Trio</p>
<p>DraftKings set the ground for a strong relationship with Foxwoods and the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation more than a year ago. Their collaboration has been a great success ever since, thanks to their hard efforts of working together while sharing the same vision of offering customers “the very best”, according to DraftKings North America’s president and co-founder Matt Kalish. Foxwoods Resort Casino is the largest resort casino in the North American region.</p>
<p>The top-tier destination offers a remarkable experience thanks to its six state-of-the casinos, triple-A Four-Diamond hotels home to more than 2,200 rooms, a rich variety of restaurants to suit every taste, luxury spa services, award-winning golf courses, and free online casino games that can be accessed online at foxwoodsonline.com.</p>
<p>The Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation is an Indian tribe recognized by the federal authorities and located at one of the oldest Indian reservations in the US, Mashantucket, in the Southeastern part of Connecticut. Its chairman Rodney Butler considers the expansion of the DraftKings partnership to Puerto Rico at the fresh Foxwoods El San Juan Casino a great opportunity to create “unforgettable memories” for both sports aficionados and customers.</p>
<p>Given its impressively rich culture connected to sports, Puerto Rico is expected to fully embrace the safe, legal, and well-streamlined options of betting on sports via DraftKings’ new online and retail sportsbooks. DraftKings is the sports betting and daily fantasy partner of the National Football League, National Basketball Association, Major League Baseball, National Hockey League, Professional Golfers’ Association TOUR, and Ultimate Fighting Championship as well as an official daily fantasy partner of the National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing, so Puerto Ricans can expect the best sporting events to be coming their way.</p>
<p>The new expansion will be helping the company follow its top performance Q4 indicators and keep promoting its 2022 growth plans. In December, DraftKings became the most visible sportsbook across all US states according to an official YouGov poll.</p>
