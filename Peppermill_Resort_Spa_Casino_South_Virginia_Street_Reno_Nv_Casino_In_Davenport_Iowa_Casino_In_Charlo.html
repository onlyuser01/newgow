<p>L’Autorité Nationale des Jeux and the Belgian Gambling Commission will cooperate as they seek to reduce problem gambling</p>
<p>France and Belgium’s regulators have signed a new cooperation protocol that will see them share information and coordinate their regulatory activities. The authorities hope that this new alliance will help them promote safer gambling across the two countries.</p>
<p>As outlined in the document, l’Autorité Nationale des Jeux (ANJ) and the Belgian Gambling Commission (BGC) will cooperate on a strategic level. In addition to sharing data, the two bodies will probe the sector together and will compile collaborative reports.</p>
<p>In addition, the two regulators promised to keep each other updated on any regulatory amendments that may happen in the future.</p>
<p>The full collaboration agreement is available on the website of the BGC but, as of the time of this writing, the protocol is only available in French.</p>
<p>The document bears the signatures of Isabelle Falque-Pierrotin and Magali Clavie, chairwomen at the ANJ and BGC respectively. It was signed during the European Gaming Regulators Forum that took place last week.</p>
<p>France and Belgium Seek Further Regulation</p>
<p>The collaboration comes amid intense efforts to regulate gambling in the two markets. France, for example, has serious problems with problem and underage gambling and has been seeking new measures that would solve the issue.</p>
<p>To that end, the ANJ recently prohibited sponsorship campaigns featuring sports celebrities, hoping that this will lead to a decrease in harm. In addition, the ANJ places its licenses’ safer gambling plans under intense scrutiny, rejecting those that are deemed insufficient.</p>
<p>Gambling is very popular in France, bringing billions in revenues and millions in tax money. However, the high problem gambling rates are something that has concerned the ANJ for a long time now.</p>
<p>Just like France, Belgium seeks to limit the negative effects of gambling advertising. Because of that, the country will introduce a ban on advertising that is scheduled to kick off on July 1 and has the support of King Philippe and Justice Minister Vincent van Quickenborne. It will effectively prevent companies from actively advertising their products to the general populace, hopefully leading to a decrease in gambling harm.</p>
<p>The decision to crack down on ads in Belgium comes amid what many called a “tsunami of advertising.” Many customers have complained about being constantly bombarded by gambling ads, which is especially bad for vulnerable people.</p>
<p>Belgium has further plans to remove gambling imagery from sports fields starting in 2025 and banning sports sponsorship deals with gambling companies from 2028.</p>
