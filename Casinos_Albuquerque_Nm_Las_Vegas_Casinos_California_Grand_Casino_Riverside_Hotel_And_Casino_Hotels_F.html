<p>Good day, on January 8, 2024, I made 4 withdrawals, out of which 3 have been received and 1 of 800 has not arrived till today, January 17, and it's unknown where it has gone. Then, I made another withdrawal of 1000 euros on January 12, 2024, and yesterday on January 16, it was returned to my gaming account.</p>
<p>I contacted customer support via chat and they told me to wait a few hours before making another withdrawal. During the withdrawal process, the BIC code is missing. Meanwhile, I continued playing and my account balance is 3000 euros, but even today, January 17, during the withdrawal, the BIC code is missing. There is only the option to enter an IBAN and I haven't made the withdrawal because there would likely be problems tracking the transaction. Dear managers at ninecasino, how do you intend to proceed?</p>
