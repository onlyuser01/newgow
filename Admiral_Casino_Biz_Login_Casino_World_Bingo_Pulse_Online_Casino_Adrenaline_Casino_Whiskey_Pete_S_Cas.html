<p>Wednesday, October 7, the mobile gaming content developer Gaming Realms plc announced a multi-year partnership with the colossus NetEnt. Under the partnership, Gaming Realms will receive the right to license the most popular slot game by NetEnt of all times – Starburst. The company is going to create a new game that combines the classic features of Starburst with the popular Slingo grid mechanic. The new hit Slingo Starburst will emerge on the online Real Money Gaming market. Furthermore, the game is going to be available for download worldwide and is expected to launch in 2021.</p>
<p>“The stars truly aligned in the signing of this new deal, and we can’t wait to see what players make of this exciting collaboration,” -Gaming Realms</p>
<p>In a statement, the Chief Financial Officer of Gaming Realms, Mark Segal said that the company is thrilled to have secured the licensing rights to the Starburst brand. He outlined that the legendary slot game has already dominated the gaming industry for multiple years. “We’re confident that fans of Slingo and Starburst will enjoy our new collaboration, which will bring together the best features of both brands,” concluded Segal.</p>

<p>According to Andy Whitworth, Chief Commercial Officer at NetEnt, the partnership is a vital part of the company’s strategy to widen the reach of its portfolio and build brand awareness in new markets.
