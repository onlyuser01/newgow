<p>A rapidly growing US online sports betting brand has just entered into a strategic partnership to expand its payment options by offering a seamless funding experience for its players.</p>
<p>ACH Payments</p>
<p>MaximBet announced it signed a partnership deal with Global Payments Gaming Solutions to deliver its patrons a simple and secure method to fund their online gaming accounts and access winnings in real time via their smart devices.</p>
<p>MaximBet was introduced in April 2021 via a partnership between privately-held licensed sports betting and casino operator Carousel Group and media brand Maxim to launch an innovative sportsbook and iGaming brand and made its debut in Colorado in September.</p>
<p>Highlighting iGaming as “one of the fastest growing segments of the gaming industry,” Carousel Group Head of Payments, Risk &amp; Fraud Andrei Dinescu outlined the growing consumer demand for a “fast, secure and easy way” to start the gaming journey alongside the increasing number of states legalizing betting and gaming.</p>
<p>“Global Payments Gaming’s suite of igaming products provides the excellent user experience that our customers demand with the security and compliance needed to run a profitable online sports book.” Andrei Dinescu, Head of Payments, Risk &amp; Fraud, Carousel Group</p>
<p>By tapping into Global Payments Gaming Solutions’ ACH guaranteed services, MaximBet can now allow its players real-time funding and access to winnings via regular accounts.</p>
<p>President of Global Payments Gaming Solutions Christopher Justice outlined the consumer preference for “digital services and solutions” as iGaming demand is increasing in his comments on the agreement.</p>
<p>“Through the implementation of our iGaming solutions, Carousel Group can tap a multi-channel approach to provide patrons with the flexibility to the game from any location they operate in.” Christopher Justice, President, Global Payments Gaming Solutions</p>
<p>Global Payments’ VIP Preferred e-check network enables players to gamble at more than 500 brick-and-mortar and online gaming brands with no need to re-register their account, blending physical and digital gaming to drive a higher level of customer satisfaction and experience.</p>
<p>Scaling Operations</p>
<p>Following its Colorado debut, the online sports betting brand acquired market access in Ohio and Pennsylvania to add to a previous agreement with the White Mountain Apache Tribe in Arizona. Currently, MaximBet also has in place market access deals in Indiana and New Jersey and holds a license from the Malta Gaming Authority (MGA).</p>
<p>Carousel Group, a relatively young sports betting and gaming company, is offering a personalized betting experience for its customers built on proprietary technology and the deal with Global Payments will further increase its appeal.</p>
