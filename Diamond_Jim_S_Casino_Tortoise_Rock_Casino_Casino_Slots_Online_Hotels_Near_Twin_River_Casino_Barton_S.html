<p>Diving Deep for Huge Rewards</p>
<p>Players who are interested in retro slot game design and excellent soundtracks are going to appreciate the new release from OneTouch. The developer has used beautiful graphic elements, colors, animations, and chest, fish, treasures, mermaids, and ocean symbols to mimic the story of mythical creatures that live underwater. Players are invited to dive deep under the water and search for wins that could reach 10,000x the original bet.</p>
<p>The grid has the standard 5×3 layout and winnings can be generated on 30 fixed lines. Players can make bets ranging from 0.2 to 100 for a single spin. The slot also features a series of Wild and Scatter symbols, a Free Spins bonus round with multipliers, and a mesmerizing Crash Dive Feature.</p>
<p>Hitting a winning combo on the reels during the base game will trigger a sinking submarine that will boost the multiplier by 1. The maximum multiplier during the base game is set at x5.</p>
<p>Try Your Luck at the Sea Treasure Challenge</p>
<p>During the Sea Treasure challenge signaling the Free Game round, the maximum multiplier could reach a whopping x999. To launch the Sea Treasure Challenge, players must land a minimum of three scatters symbols on the reels, including the Evil Eye symbol. This symbol should be handled carefully as coming across three of these symbols will bring the Free Game to an abrupt end.</p>
<p>Crash Dive Feature Increases the Multiplier by up to x10</p>
<p>During the same Free Games bonus round, players can also come across the Crash Dive feature and enjoy a maximum x10 boost added to the multiplier. The company’s head, Madis Raus, expressed his excitement regarding the expansion of their “ever-growing video slot portfolio” with an excellent fresh title. He added that the game will allow players to enjoy a “surreal deep diving experience” while discovering smart features that will take them by surprise while beefing up engagement.</p>
<p>The game is available on Android and iOS devices. OneTouch’s one-of-a-kind content is widely spread in European and Far-Eastern markets, but the games have also reached players in Latin America and Africa. At the beginning of June, the supplier launched Raiden Medal Burst, another retro-style game inspired by the Raiden arcade games.</p>
