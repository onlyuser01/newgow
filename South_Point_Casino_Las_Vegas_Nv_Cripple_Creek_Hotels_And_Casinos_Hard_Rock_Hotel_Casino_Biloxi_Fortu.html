    <h1>South Point Casino Las Vegas Nv Cripple Creek Hotels And Casinos Hard Rock Hotel Casino Biloxi Fortu</h1>

<p>Update: well my withdraw says completed, but I NEVER GOT MY BITCOIN. SO HOW IS THIS COMPLETED!!??! I have spoken 2 live chat since this occurred on Tuesday, every day since then I've spoken 2 them as well as emailing support so they can address this and fix this immediately.. TO NO AVAIL. Live chat said I should have my withdraw if it says completed, but "Khole" if that is even a real name, assures me that they will get MY WITHDRAW TO ME &amp; get this fixed and sent to me asap, well that was Tuesday and its now Saturday. Morning. I only got a generic response from support on Wednesday stating that they transferred the info to the financial dept&amp;they'll get back to me asap.. well again NOTHING. So my 1st withdraw was messed up, so the New Management Team emailed me apologizing 4 the mix up, guaranteeing I'd recieve it by last week, that was the 1st withdraw which I had 2 resubmit which I did. Well this 2nd withdraw says "Completed". But shocker I also Never recieved it so how is it completed. Idk what the F is going on at this place but they obviously r screwing ppl over hard core, not to mention I have another withdraw that I requested the following day after the one that's showing completed and that is still processing,.</p>
<p>What the heck is wrong with these ppl?? I know what they r doing, they are purposely not getting back to me, purposely not sending my withdraw, so that way 30 days will lapse since I requested the withdraws and then at the 30 day mark they can void any withdraw request and the winnings that has been 30 days or longer. CAN U BELIEVE THIS, THEY DELIBERATELY MAKE YOU WAIT FOR COMMUNICATION 2 TRY TO RESOLVE THESE ISSUES FOR SO LONG SO THAT WAY THEY CAN come back &amp; SAY IT'S IN OUR TERMS AND CONDITIONS THAT ALL WITHDRAWS ARE VOID AT 30 DAYS or longer.. I'M SO PISSED OFF RIGHT NOW. I have all the emails showing proof of this bs from this site.. it's beyond me how they are allowed to even operate..</p>
<p>THEY R A SCAM PLEASE NEVER EVER EVER THROW YOUR MONEY AWAY AT THIS WRETCHED POOR EXCUSE 4 AN ONLINE CASINO. I honestly didn't want to get on here &amp; have 2 say all these negative things because I love their games, but what odds the point if you'll never be able to withdraw ur winnings, and their support staff as well as their financial dept MUST HONESTLY HAVE ZERO EMPLOYEES WORKING IN EITHER OF THE DEPTS, because u can't get in touch with anyone 2 save your life.. I'm going to copy and paste this review and blast it of every single review website..</p>
<p>My question is this???? Why would the"New Management " even bother emailing me 2 apologize about the mix up with the original withdraw, tell me2 resubmit it, which I did, and that way they will have me paid out by last week. WHEN THAT WAS A OBVIOUS LIE..!!I believe they did that just 2 buy then even more time so the 30 days lapses. I promise u that is what these thieves r doing.. it's utterly disgusting at this point..</p>
<p>Can some one please please help me.. My username is DarahR80..They r legit a total scam website.. seriously</p>
