<p>The government of Queensland has opted to evaluate Star Entertainment’s business after all. This follows the government’s decision to introduce new laws that prevent gambling crime in the first place.</p>
<p>Queensland Will Probe Star’s Business</p>
<p>The independent inquiry, announced by Shannon Fentiman, Queensland’s attorney-general, will evaluate whether Star Entertainment is suitable to hold a license. A few months ago, the gambling giant was found guilty of breaching multiple regulations in multiple Australian states. Notably, the company refused to follow the rules concerning gambling harm and money laundering. In addition, reviewers accused Star of working with shady Chinese billionaires and allowing them to run schemes at its venues.</p>
<p>Fentiman said that those allegations are something that the Palaszczuk Government takes very seriously. Because of that, the independent review will probe Star’s casinos in Brisbane and the Gold Coast. Its job will be to check whether the company has breached any laws. Independent experts will work alongside the forces of the Office of Liquor and Gaming Regulation, the Queensland Police and the AUSTRAC to determine whether Star breached any laws in the state.</p>
<p>Fentiman promised that the government will do anything in its power to uncover any fraudulent practices and introduce appropriate measures. If reviewers deem a casino unsuitable to operate, a provisional license will allow the venue to remain open.</p>
<p>The Oppositions Criticized the Government for Being Slow</p>
<p>The opposition in Queensland felt let down that it took so long to decide to evaluate Star’s business. Shadow Minister for integrity in government Fiona Simpson was unhappy that the state government was slow on the uptake and didn’t act earlier.</p>
<p>It’s so important that this inquiry is transparent it gets to the bottom of what’s been going on, but it is disappointing that it’s taken so long before there’s even been a starting point … here in Queensland. Fiona Simpson, Shadow Minister for integrity in government</p>
<p>Shadow Treasurer David Janetzki also addressed the matter. He confirmed that the allegations against Star’s business in New South Wales are concerning. Because of this, it is crucial to evaluate the company in Queensland as well.</p>
<p>Janetzki is firm that the inquiry should be independent and should maintain a high degree of transparency to help the government get to the truth. He pointed out that this is crucial to maintaining public trust.</p>
<p>Fentiman also added that the Queensland government will take in mind the results of the ongoing inquiry of Star’s business in New South Wales. The latter state’s regulator deemed the casino company unsuitable to hold a license and will announce its final verdict later this month.</p>
