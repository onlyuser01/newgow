<p>Bellator 294 is coming to Hawaii this Friday, with the main event of the evening being the Women’s Flyweight Championship fight between Liz Carmouche (c) and DeAnna Bennett</p>
<p>This is going to be the second time Liz Carmouche and DeAnna Bennett meet in the ring. Their first fight took place in 2020 when we saw Carmouche beat Bennett by a rear naked choke. Can she do the same three years later?</p>

<p>When, Where, and How to Watch?</p>
<p>Place : Neal S. Blaisdell Arena in Honolulu, Hawaii</p>
<p>: Neal S. Blaisdell Arena in Honolulu, Hawaii Date : Friday, April 21, 2023</p>
<p>: Friday, April 21, 2023 Time : ~10:00 PM ET</p>
<p>: ~10:00 PM ET How to Watch: Showtime</p>
<p>Liz Carmouche Is the Champ for a Reason</p>
<p>Carmouche is 18-7 in her professional career with eight wins by knockout, four by submission, and six by decision. When it comes to her losses, two happened by submission and five by decision. As of 2023, she’s still without a single loss by KO/TKO.</p>
<p>A fun fact about Carmouche’s record is that she’s without a loss since joining Bellator MMA, with six wins in a row. The last time she lost was in 2019 in the title fight for the UFC Women’s Flyweight Championship.</p>
<p>In fact, most of her losses happened to elite fighters. In addition to Shevchenko, we also saw her lose to Miesha Tate, Alexis Davis, and so on. Can DeAnna Bennett get on this list?</p>
<p>DeAnna Bennett Looking for Revenge</p>
<p>The outcome of this fight depends solely on how Carmouche performs. Everything is in her hands, that’s how much superior she is to her opponent. But even the best fighters have a bad day sometimes. If that happens, can DeAnna Bennett take advantage of the situation?</p>
<p>Bennett is not a bad fighter, although she’s nowhere near Carmouche. She is 13-7-1 with three wins in a row. However, before that, she lost three straight wins. Her last three wins each happened by a decision, while two of those aforementioned losses happened by a submission.</p>
<p>Submission is the method by which she lost to Carmouche the first time they met. Can the same happen again?</p>
<p>Carmouche vs Bennett 2 Prediction</p>
<p>Carmouche is the betting favorite for a reason. She’s much better than Bennett in all aspects, so anything but a win inside the distance would be a huge surprise. The only question, really, seems to be the way with which Carmouche is going to finish her opponent If we had to pick one, we’d go with another submission win.</p>
<p>Pick: Liz Carmouche to win inside the distance</p>
