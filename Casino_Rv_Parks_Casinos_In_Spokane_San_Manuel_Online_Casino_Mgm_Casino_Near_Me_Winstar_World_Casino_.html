<p>The industry has responded to the arrival of the White Paper which will now thrash out revised rules for the industry to abide by</p>
<p>The latest company to comment on this seminal moment in the UK gambling industry is Rank Group. The company has welcomed the proposals and the forthcoming process of consultation that will collect further input and feedback and arrive at solutions that best reflect the needs of consumers.</p>
<p>Rank Group Weighs In on Digital and Land-Based Changes</p>
<p>Rank Group called itself in support of “striking the right balance” between consumer freedoms and protecting individuals from gambling-related harm. The Group also said that it welcomed the commitment demonstrated in the White Paper and acknowledged that there have been significant changes to the gambling landscape over the past years.</p>
<p>Rank Group, which has 50 casinos, hailed the proposed changes for the land-based sector, which should give the company a more competitive outlook in the age of digital gambling. The Group confirmed that it would continue to keep in touch with the government and the UK Gambling Commission regarding the proposed changes and how they can contribute to the final framework outlined by the White Paper.</p>
<p>Rank Group also welcomed the idea of a statutory levy and said that the government has chosen the right approach in considering the “differing association of different sectors with harm and/or their differing fixed costs.”</p>
<p>Rank Group expects any changes to the gambling industry and its regulatory framework in the United Group to have a positive impact on the Group. Company chief executive John O’Reilly similarly noted:</p>
<p>The public policy changes set out by Government are a constructive set of measures for the future of our industry and provide a firmer foundation for us to invest in our business. Company chief executive John O’Reilly</p>
<p>Digital Pinch to Be Felt, Net Benefit for Group Anyway</p>
<p>O’Reilly explained that Rank Group would feel the pinch of digital regulation tightening but remained cautiously optimistic about the prospects that the changes revealed ahead of the land-based industry. In net terms, though, the Group stands to benefit, he noted.</p>
<p>“With public policy now set, attention shifts to the timeline for implementing these policy changes. Swift implementation of these much-needed reforms is vital for the land-based sector as we look to meet the needs of today’s consumers whilst continuing to uphold our commitment to safer gambling,” the executive concluded on an upbeat note.</p>
