<p>Madame Destiny Megaways review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>This slot is themed on the occult.</p>
<p>Players will be greeted by the beautiful fortune teller Madame Destiny herself. Adorned in exotic scarves and ornate bangles, she looks up from a crystal ball that players must click to enter her game.</p>
<p>Once players enter her caravan of reels, they’ll discover their fate. An array of mystic symbols stand guard in the reels, from black cats to love potions.</p>
<p>Players will find it easy to get into the mood of this magical game.</p>

<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The soundtrack is chiming notes and a haunting melody. It feels on theme but has a short turnaround time so some players may grow tired of it. For them, it is easy to turn the sound off.</p>
<p>Though the gorgeously illustrated Madame Destiny is present at the beginning of the game, she does not remain by the reels for gameplay, but rather only appears on the Wild symbol. This is a shame because her charismatic presence adds a lot to the slot’s theme. She is, afterall, its titular character, so it would have been nice to have her continue to host the game.</p>
<p>The setting is a darkened forest filled with stars and the silhouettes of trees. This creates a spooky atmosphere and a contrast for the warm, bright tones of the reels.</p>
<p>The reels themselves are in a caravan illuminated by swinging lanterns on either side.</p>
<p>The animal symbols are a highlight with a stern-looking owl and a cute black cat peeking out at the players. The candles and tarot cards are all lushly animated as well.</p>
<p>Overall, the graphics add an enchanting energy to this slot.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Madame Destiny Megaways is a six reel slot.</p>
<p>In this game, reels 1 and 6 may have as many as 7 symbols. Meanwhile, reels 2, 3, 4, and 5 may have as many as 8 symbols.</p>
<p>Spinning independently, the top row of reels 2, 3, 4 and 5 functions somewhat like a separate reel.</p>
<p>This game uses the Any Way Wins system, meaning that wins are awarded for adjacent matching symbols in any position on the reels, running consecutively from left to right).</p>
<p>The maximum number of ways to win is 200,704 in total.</p>
<p>This game uses a cascade feature, which means that whenever a player wins, the winning symbols vanish. The remaining symbols then fall down in the reels and any empty spaces are filled with fresh symbols.</p>
<p>The Ante Bet option means that players may choose the bet multiplier. The chosen bet value will change the nature of the game. For example:</p>
<p>x20 bet multiplier: normal play</p>
<p>x25 bet multiplier: chance to win Free Spins doubled and a greater number of scatter symbols will be on the reels</p>
<p>The feature is capped at a x5000 (maximum) bet multiplier: reaching x5000 during a Free Spins Round immediately ends the round, awards the win, and forfeits remaining free spins.</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter symbol. The Wild symbol will only appear on reels 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.</p>
<p>When players win a combination using a Wild symbol, their win is multiplied by 2.</p>
<p>Wild symbol doubles all wins</p>
<p>The Free Spins Feature is prompted by the Scatter symbol which may appear on any of the reels. When the Scatter symbol lands three or more times anywhere on the reels, the free spins round is triggered.</p>
<p>Prior to the free spins beginning, a Wheel of Fortune holding a number of free spins and a multiplier will appear. Players will watch the wheel spin and randomly assign a number of free spins as well as a multiplier that will be applied to the total win of every free spin.</p>
<p>The Free Spin feature can be re-triggered by landing three or more Scatter symbols. If re-triggered, the wheel of fortune will once again spin, and add to the current awards.</p>
<p>Players use special reels while in the Free Spins rounds.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.56% (up to 96.67% with Ante Bet), above our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.20 up to a maximum of $/£/€100 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is high, which makes it a great match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Full paytable for Madame Destiny Megaways slot</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We recommend this high RTP, high volatility mystic-themed slot.</p>
<p>The excellent strategy stats alone would make this game worth visiting, but the fun of the fortune telling theme makes it especially appealing.</p>
<p>Players will love the enchanted atmosphere and the varied bonus possibilities.</p>
