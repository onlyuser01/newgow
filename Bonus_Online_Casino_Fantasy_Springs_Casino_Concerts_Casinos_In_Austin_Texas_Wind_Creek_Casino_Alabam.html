    <h1>Bonus Online Casino Fantasy Springs Casino Concerts Casinos In Austin Texas Wind Creek Casino Alabam</h1>

<p>Sports Information Services (SIS), a leading multi-channel supplier of live betting services, has received the Gold Standards accreditation from the Esports Integrity Commission (ESIC), an association protecting esports from fraud.</p>
<p>SIS Is Committed to Offering Fair Esports Matches</p>
<p>The Gold Standards are ESIC’s higher level of accreditation. It was awarded to SIS for being a reliable supplier of betting events. The latter company is known to offer unmatched levels of integrity that provide esports bettors with exciting opportunities to wager on games such as CS:GO, esoccer and ebasketball. In fact, SIS is the first betting events supplier to receive this accreditation, following the update of ESIC’s criteria.</p>
<p>ESIC’s Gold Standard has a list of integrity and safety requirements that tournament organizers and companies in the esports sector must fulfill before receiving accreditation. To receive the Gold Standards, an entity needs to diligently maintain the highest standards possible for the benefit of all stakeholders.</p>
<p>Fortunately for SIS, its SIS Competitive Gaming division follows all practices outlined by ESIC and puts all the effort needed to ensure each esports event is fair. All of the company’s head-to-head matches, which are streamed from the company’s studio in the United Kingdom, are broadcasted through a secure platform that only licensed operators can use. All of the audience has been verified and the events are never streamed to the general public, thus reducing chat toxicity and risk.</p>
<p>In addition, the events are overseen by an experienced ESIC referee and an SIS trading team to ensure that no match is being fixed and no betting fraud is taking place.</p>
<p>SIS Competitive Gaming Had to Fulfill a List of Requirements</p>
<p>Here are the requirements SIS had to meet before receiving the Gold Standards accreditation:</p>
<p>First of all, SIS had to ban all types of communication devices in the gaming studios. In addition, the company had to ensure that at least three people from its team oversee each event. SIS was also required to check all of its employees’ backgrounds and ensure they have no criminal records.</p>
<p>As for the games, SIS must fix fair game settings for all games it streams. The company must also make sure that all players are of sufficient skills to compete professionally. Lastly, the supplier has to see all staff and gamers sign ESIC’s anti-corruption code.</p>
<p>Adam Conway, SIS’ head of esports and competitive gaming, said that his team is very proud to receive the new accreditation. He emphasized that it attests to his company’s standards when it comes to esports. Conway said that SIS Competitive Gaming’s partnering operators appreciate this level of integrity as it helps them engage customers with fair betting experiences of high quality.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ian Smith, commissioner at ESIC, noted that the new Gold Standards highlight the highest level of security in esports. Smith was glad to assess SIS Competitive Gaming and see that division meets all integrity requirements for accreditation.</p>
