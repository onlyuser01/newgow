<p>How to Play Double Double Bonus Poker</p>
<p>As the name of this Video Poker game suggests, Double Double Bonus is just like Double Bonus, offering an extra payout for different four of a kind combinations, but with little something extra. The game features various payouts for 5 different four of a kind combinations, compared to 3 different four of a kind combinations in Double Bonus.</p>
<p>This difference makes the strategy somewhat more complex, and increases the variance to 42.2, which is the highest among all the traditional Video Poker games. This increased variance translates into a requirement for around 40% bigger bankroll than you would need when playing Jacks or Better.</p>
<p>Full pay Double Double Bonus Poker paytable</p>
<p>The theoretical return of the full pay version is 100.07%, however, it is not available online, and these days you’ll find it’s also becoming rarer in land based casinos.</p>
<p>The most common Double Double Bonus game online is with a reduced payout for a Full House to 9. This decreases the overall theoretical payout to 98.98%. This version of Double Double Bonus Video Poker is available at most RTG and Microgaming casinos. Some of them even offer no deposit bonuses for Video Poker.</p>
<p>Microgaming Double Double Bonus Poker paytable</p>
<p>Even though the Double Double Bonus game is extremely attractive because of it’s higher payout for 4 aces and selected four of a kind combinations, I do not recommend playing it online, as it offers a very low RTP and the strategy is also more complicated than the one for some of the higher paying Video Poker games listed on this page.</p>
