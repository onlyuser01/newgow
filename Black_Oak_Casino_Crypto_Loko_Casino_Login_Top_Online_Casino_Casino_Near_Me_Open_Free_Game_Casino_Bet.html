<p>Sports betting brand and iGaming company BetMGM established a crucial partnership earlier this week, announcing a new alliance with the National Football League, NFL. This partnership consolidates the company’s footprint in the newly fledged single-event sports betting market in Canada and paves a road to sustainable long-term growth and recognition.</p>
<p>BetMGM officially launched operations in Ontario back in April 2022 and has been actively building up its presence in the province. Ontario is said to be the biggest iGaming and sports betting market in North America with close to 15m residents. BetMGM CEO Adam Greenblatt welcomed the opportunity to forge a stronger collaboration with the NFL in Canada as well.</p>
<p>"We're already seeing great interest from our Ontario customers and this collaboration truly elevates the BetMGMexperience," the executive said, optimistic about the company’s present results in the province, and also buoyant about what the future may bring. As a result of this partnership, BetMGM will be able to leverage NFL’s assets and intellectual property in Ontario.</p>
<p>This will enable the company to build strong marketing propositions across social media and other advertisement landscapes. As an added benefit, BetMGM’s brand will also be advertised across NFL’s own digital platforms in the region. BetMGM and NFL will work on exclusive experiences for fans in Ontario and make them readily available through the sportsbook’s platform.</p>
<p>NFL Canada Senior Director of Corporate PartnershipGavin Kemp welcomed the opportunity to be working with BetMGM. The company has a unique gaming platform and it will be an important part of the NFL’s future success in Ontario as both companies seek innovation and recognition in the market.</p>
<p>The present partnership is also a continuation of a similar arrangement struck across the border down South. BetMGM became an Approved Sportsbook Partner for the NFL in the United States last year, with the two companies building up on this complementing opportunity in the new market.</p>
<p>BetMGM has been active all over the entertainment and sports betting space. The company signed a partnership with Carnival Corporation in June and it became an official sponsor for Madison Square Garden.</p>
<p>Sports betting is going to be of increasing importance to sports leagues and franchises who have recognized the vertical’s true potential and stepped away from ossified concepts such as "integrity fees," focusing on lucrative partnerships that benefit business, consumers, and leagues at the same time.</p>
