<p>Pennsylvania Budget Crisis Keeps Online Gambling Hopes Alive, Michigan Introduces Bill</p>

<p>The Pennsylvania legislature is back in session this week, as lawmakers reconvene to resume squabbling about an ever-elusive budget agreement that could, eventually, legalize online gambling.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf branded a House budget plan “nonsense” this week, but the need to find a solution to an impasse has become more pressing than ever, and it keeps the possibility of legalized online gambling on the table. (Image: PA.gov)</p>
<p>Urgency is growing, though, as the state could go broke on Friday for the first time in its history.</p>
<p>Treasurer Joe Torsella and Auditor General Eugene DePasquale have warned that Pennsylvania does not have enough money to pay $860 million in bills due by the end of the week, and neither seems in the mood to authorize another short-term loan to give the State House an extension on its Friday deadline.</p>
<p>The legislature passed a $32 billion budget bill in June without an accompanying plan to pay for it. In late July, the Senate approved bipartisan budget funding bills that included, among other things, $200 million in revenues from online gambling.</p>
<p>Having failed to come up with a workable budget plan of its own, the GOP-dominated House rejected the Senate plan and went on vacation for the rest of the summer.</p>
<p>Online Gaming Absent</p>
<p>This week, the House returned with a fiscally conservative, Republican-backed plan that makes no mention of online gambling. The so-called “Taxpayers Budget,” which has been widely mocked, proposes siphoning funds from a range of accounts earmarked for the development of transit, ports, rails and infrastructure.</p>
<p>After previously pushing the state House to “get their act together,” Pennsylvania’s Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf has branded their latest idea “nonsense.” A vote on the plan scheduled for Tuesday did not materialize.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, if GOP House leaders are going to include gambling in an eventual budget plan, they favor a package that would include the authorization of video gaming terminals (VGTs) in bars and restaurants.</p>
<p>But while the Republican-led Senate can possibly stomach online gambling, it finds VGTs unpalatable, which suggests is a long way away from consensus.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Pennsylvania remains the state most likely to legalize and regulate online gambling next, if the state’s fiscal cliff somehow pushes disparate gambling interests together.</p>
<p>Michigan Next in Line</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Michigan could be the next state to give online gambling legalization a whirl. On Tuesday, State Rep. Brandt Iden introduced H 4926, which is due to be heard by the House Regulatory Reform Committee Wednesday.</p>
<p>The main obstacle for Michigan is the state’s mix of tribal and commercial gaming. Online gambling regulation must include tribal operators to have a chance at success, but to do that, Iden’s bill makes clear, would require tribes to renegotiate their compacts with the state.</p>
<p>Last year, a bill from Sen. Mike Kowall proposed that tribes would have to “renounce sovereign immunity” to be licensed, which was understandably unpopular and openly opposed by at least four tribal operators.</p>
