    <h1>Casino Boat Hollywood Casino Amphitheatre Casino In Manila Casino Themed Party 2023 Hollywood Casino</h1>

<p>Hello all casinoguru friends,</p>
<p>I tell you about my misadventures with 888 , in the hope that you can advise me what to do. On Monday 21 November I load 100 euros and start playing the genius slot. I state that I am not a regular player and I load very rarely. Well, that evening luck was on my side and with a top-up of 100 euros (without bonuses) I got a bonus and reached 4100 euros. I'm making a collection request. I receive an email confirming that my request is being processed. In the following days I receive an endless request for documents, under the pretext that I have logged in from a different country than that of registration. In fact, for work I'm in Kenya (country where 888 operates, among other things). After having fulfilled each request for documents, including passport, bank statements and photos of the card used, I receive an email confirming my verification procedure. On Thursday the 24th I received another email which on the one hand thanks me for verifying my account and on the other temporarily suspends my account because the country where I live does not allow the use of accounts registered in other countries and they suggest to close my Italian account and open one in Kenya. Here, from there the most total nothing, I continue to ask by email and by telephone what will become of my winnings, if it is possible to collect. I haven't received any more emails, the telephone operators, on the other hand, tell me to wait, despite every deadline they give me, it is promptly disregarded. At this point I wonder if I will ever receive my winnings. Do you have any advice for me? Do you think the fact that I played from a non-eu country could be a reason why they won't pay me? Thanks everyone in advance for the support</p>
