<p>Incentive Games is deepening its connection with BtoBet through the extension of its P2P portfolio of virtual games to BtoBet’s customers.</p>
<p>BtoBet to Now Offer P2P Incentive Games</p>
<p>BtoBet and Incentive Games have struck a new partnership with Incentive bringing its dedicated portfolio of P2P virtual sports games to BtoBet’s customers. The partnership will have a regional focus on Europe, Africa, and Latin America and feature numerous player-favorite titles, including Virtual League: Racing and Virtual-League: Penalties.</p>
<p>Commenting on this partnership, BtoBet chief marketing officer Sabrina Soldà said that Incentive’s F2P and P2P games would allow the company’s partners to reach out to new audiences and provide them with fresh products that are fit for mobile devices.</p>
<p>“Nowadays, F2P and P2P games are a key tool for all operators as they seek cost-effective and entertaining ways of driving their acquisition, retention, and engagement metrics,” added Soldà.</p>
<p>The present deal is a continuation of an already agreed-upon partnership with a focus on the same markets. Incentive Games, which focuses on developing mobile-friendly games, has spent considerable efforts to ensure that its titles run well for Opera Mini Extreme and a range of devices, operating systems, and browsers.</p>
<p>Driving Stronger Acquisition and Retention</p>
<p>Incentive Games CEO John Gordon pitched in the conversation, sharing his satisfaction with pursuing deeper ties with BtoBet. Through this new partnership, Incentive can continue to work on core markets that are important to the company, Gordon explained.</p>
<p>He praised Incentive’s ability to drive acquisition and retention through its unique gaming products. Gordon believes his company’s games will resonate with BtoBet’s partners. Incentive Games previously struck another partnership focused on the African market through an agreement with Betsson AB.</p>
<p>Incentive Games is developing a suite of F2P games to run on Betsson’s Betsafe Kenya brand. The company continues to create intuitive HTML5-friendly products that add to and empower the offers of numerous brands.</p>
