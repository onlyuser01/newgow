<p>iGaming expert Swintt has officially welcomed its second studio partner. The company has inked a deal with the famous Japanese provider Samurai Studio that will allow the latter two release games through Swintt’s product solution.</p>
<p>SwinttStudios Will Back Samurai Studio</p>
<p>The new agreement is a part of the partnership program of the fresh SwinttStudios initiatives. SwinttStudios is described as a game-changing initiative that allows boutique software providers to develop and distribute games within the profound Swintt framework. This way, Swintt’s partners can focus on the game’s theme and atmosphere while Swintt handles the rest. The initiative allows the slots giant to nurture innovation by supporting innovative studios with new ideas.</p>
<p>Samurai Studio is one of the few Japanese providers to reach a global audience. As such, it seeks to double down on growth and use Swintt’s distribution network and tools to reach new markets. The studio is owned by NatsumeAtari, a famous video game publisher. The renowned video gaming company opted to explore a new vertical and launched its first slots studio, Samurai Studio, in late 2020. As a company that has developed video games for over three decades, NatsumeAtari hopes to produce best-in-class atmospheric slots that will appeal to a broad range of players.</p>
<p>NatsumeAtari Continues Its Quest to Engage Players</p>
<p>Swintt believes its clients are going to adore Samurai Studios’ roster of titles.</p>
<p>David Mann, Swintt’s chief executive officer, noted that for a studio that has been around for only two years, Samurai Studio has produced content that is nothing short of impressive. However, he believes there is still room for growth and is looking forward to backing the innovative slots provider with SwinttStudios’ tools.</p>
<p>Mann said that SwinttStudios will “take the nuts and bolts of game logic and product delivery” off Samurai Studio’s hands and help the latter streamline its creative process.</p>
<p>This will enable them to make cutting-edge game development their main priority as our distribution network makes sure that the exclusive games they create via the SwinttStudios partnership program reach all the markets where they need to be seen. David Mann, CEO, Swintt</p>
<p>Mitsuhiro Koide, NatsumeAtari’s chief operating officer, also shared his thoughts on the agreement. He pointed out that his company’s goal has always been to deliver great fun to players. The developer hopes to deliver the same joy to slots players that it already provides to video gaming enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Koide is sure that the new agreement will help Samurai Studio focus on creating the best games possible.</p>
<p>By joining forces with Swintt for this exciting venture, our talented team of designers and developers can focus on creating the most immersive and enjoyable games possible while Swintt’s distribution solutions and in-depth industry know-how help us put our product in front of a brand new audience. Mitsuhiro Koide, COO, NatsumeAtari</p>
<p>In other news, Swintt was recently cleared for launch in the United Kingdom.</p>
