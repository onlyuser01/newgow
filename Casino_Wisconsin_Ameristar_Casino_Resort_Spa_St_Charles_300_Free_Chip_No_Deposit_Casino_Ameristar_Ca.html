<p>Detroit has a lot to thank its local gambling businesses for. After qualms about the higher crime rate around casinos in the city were disproved, the city and Michigan as a state have reasons to thank the vibrant industry for supporting various aspects of public spending through what has been one of the worst economic downturns brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic and the near-complete shutdown of businesses across the United States and the world.</p>
<p>IGaming Revenue Bolsters Ailing Public Purse</p>
<p>In this context, Detroit mayor Mike Duggan is optimistic about the future and presented a budget this week which is not going to miss any key deliverables, and iGaming is much of the reason why. The budget was aptly named “Return to Normal” and the $1.2 billion financial plan has benefited amply from iGaming revenue, Duggan told the Detroit City Council where the budget was read and submitted for approval earlier this week.</p>
<p>In delivering the budget, Duggan argued that slot machines and table games at casinos alone have contributed $26.6 million in the fiscal 2021 and this number is very likely to go up to $71 million in 2022.</p>
<p>This is mostly the effect of enabling online gambling referred to as iGaming that effectively allows casinos to begin introducing remote gaming options that are more convenient and arguably drive a significant chunk of the gaming revenue up. A total of three casinos have switched their online gambling platforms on delivering some robust financial results.</p>
<p>Detroit Casinos Prove Lodestars of iGaming</p>
<p>The three casinos in Detroit that answered the iGaming call include Motorcity, Greektown, and MGM Grand. All three properties had to operate under a huge strain brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic with shutdowns looming and restricted capabilities throughout most of 2020.</p>
<p>This began to change in 2021 when casinos were able to collect $1.26 billion in winnings, or twice the number from 2020. Out of this amount, the gross gaming revenue realized through internet gaming stood at $1.1 billion last year. Sports betting operations brought in $110.6 million in income compared to $1 billion for online slots and table games.</p>
<p>The total taxes on internet gaming revenue realized $268.3 million and Detroit managed to claim $59.35 million of that. Internet gambling has proven its viability in a hurry and even though fears about gambling addiction were raised, the impact the revenue has had in bolstering up the budget has made skeptics more lenient on introducing online gambling.</p>
<p>This is not to say that Duggan did not have to act presciently early into the pandemic, as the city had to muster up $350 million in overall cuts from the budget to balance its spending and outlast the nadir of the pandemic. Internet gaming has been a life raft but there is still work to be done, Duggan cautions.</p>
