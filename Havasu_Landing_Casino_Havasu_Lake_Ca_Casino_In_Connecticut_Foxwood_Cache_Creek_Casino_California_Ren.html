    <h1>Havasu Landing Casino Havasu Lake Ca Casino In Connecticut Foxwood Cache Creek Casino California Ren</h1>

<p>I have been gaming with Hellspin for a short time and when I felt myself slipping again I reached out to live support to ask to set my monthly deposit limit to $0.00. They advised that they sent it to the appropriate department for review. No follow up. I continued to deposit as I was weak. I then asked several more times in the days/week that followed as well as emailed support@hellspin.com along with my VIP manager eren@hellspin.com. I had even inquired with them as to why my depositing access was not cut off. It was either blatantly ignored or met with the same old "we've sent your request to the appropriate department for review". It wasn't until today when my losses have reached nearly thousands and thousands of dollars when I finally hit the breaking point and just told live chat I had a gambling problem that they finally instantly closed my account. This was an extreme measure that didn't need to be if they had just did what was requested. I knew how I was feeling and I knew it was about to get out of control and they let it happen. I was basically begging for them to not allow me to deposit for 30 days so I could catch my breath and they ignored my pleas. This is wrong on many levels and as much as I don't want to be "that guy" I can honestly say that I feel that this casino should reimburse me all money lost since the first communication to limit my depositing ability. Responsible gaming should be at the forefront of every single online casinos priorities. I'm saddened that it got to this point, not just because I lost a boatload of money but because I attempted to take the correct measures to ensure things didn't get to this point. They didn't listen..</p>
