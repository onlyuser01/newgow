<p>One of the fastest-growing cryptocurrency betting and gaming operators, Stake.com, announced that it launched the UK-facing platform Stake.uk.com.</p>
<p>Stake.com Launches UK-facing Operations</p>
<p>The new UK platform offers customers multiple opportunities such as casino entertainment, sports betting and virtual sports. Powered by TGP, Stake.uk.com is licensed by the UK Gambling Commission. The new platform is accessible from mobile, tablet and desktop devices. Moreover, the platform operates in line with the UK licensing regulations and offers responsible gambling tools. Those tools enable customers to take timeouts, self-exclude from the platform or set deposit limits.</p>
<p>Stake.com is a Crypto Gambling Foundation verified member, which means that it meets all necessary transparency and fairness requirements. It is important to mention that the UK-facing platform processes all payments in fiat currency, which is in line with the existing UK regulations. In other words, the platform won’t accept cryptocurrency transactions or payments.</p>
<p>The Company Continues to Grow On a Global Scale</p>
<p>Stake.com’s sponsorship manager, Dominic Rae, revealed that UK customers can now enjoy sportsbook, gaming and casino products via stake.uk.com. He acknowledged that the new platform offers access to multiple sportsbook markets and features odds coverage for unique sports events. According to Rae, consumers can also use multiple responsible gambling tools that help them enjoy gambling safely.</p>
<p>“Following a successful launch our UK-facing and licensed website stake.uk.com is now live, offering sportsbook, casino and gaming products to the UK.” Dominic Rae, Sponsorships Manager for Stake.com</p>
<p>It was back in 2017 when Stake.com first launched. Since then, the platform has grown significantly and by now it is processing more than 30 billion bets yearly. Moreover, it handles 5% of the global Bitcoin transactions, as well as 10% of the global Dogecoin transactions. Currently, the company’s core markets are Latin America and Canada. However, the recent UK launch is a part of Stake’s global growth strategy as the company plans to further expand on a global scale.</p>
<p>Looking at the UK, Stake.com announced a significant partnership with Watford FC just in time for the 21/22 club season. Celebrating the UK launch, the company unveiled an exclusive promotion for Watford fans dubbed “Stake x Watford First Goal Payout.” The company explained that under the promo if “the Hornets score first in any Premier League game and fail to win, Stake.com will still pay out on all bets on a Watford victory.”</p>
