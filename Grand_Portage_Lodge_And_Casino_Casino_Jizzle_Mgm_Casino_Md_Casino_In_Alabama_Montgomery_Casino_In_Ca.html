<p>Malta-based online casino brand Casumo teamed with leading gambling services provider for anti-money laundering (AML), fraud and responsible gaming Neccton to enhance its player protection.</p>
<p>Enhancing Player Protection</p>
<p>The announcement of the new business relationship between Casumo and Neccton confirmed the online casino acknowledged its need for expert assistance while dealing with regulatory matters. Casumo, which was heavily penalized by the UK Gambling Commission last year for significant failings in its social responsibilities and AML procedures, will now utilize Neccton’s solution Mentor.</p>
<p>“We’re really pleased to be partnering with Neccton as we continue to focus our efforts on responsible gaming. Casumo is constantly striving to provide the best possible customer experience in a safe environment, the mentor player protection software will allow us to reinforce this and proactively support our players.” Benjamin Pule, Head of Regulatory Compliance, Casumo</p>
<p>Based on artificial intelligence (AI), Mentor analyses player behavior in real-time and is capable of distinguishing patterns of problem gambling to help both the operator and the player to acknowledge the risk by notifying them. Going forward, Casumo players will be alerted once their gambling behavior shows signs of becoming problematic.</p>
<p>“We are delighted to welcome Casumo on board! We already work with so many of the world’s biggest gaming companies who recognize that our approach and our expertise is unique. We’re really excited to be bringing our value to the Casumo brand, and to helping their customers to play responsibly.” Dr. Michael Auer, Director and Head of Development, Neccton</p>
<p>Deployed across Europe and North America</p>
<p>Neccton’s multilingual, highly scalable, and easy to implement cloud-based Mentor solution exemplifies the company’s expertise in player tracking and is utilized by operators across European and North American gaming jurisdictions, including the UK, Sweden, Denmark, Switzerland, Germany, Italy, Spain, Norway, Finland, and Canada.</p>
<p>Austria-based provider of gambling regulatory services Neccton leverages over 15 years of experience in data science, AI and big data to provide a one-stop regulatory solution for online gaming operators, ensuring its customers are compliant over AML, customer relationship management (CRM), fraud detection, and responsible gaming.</p>
