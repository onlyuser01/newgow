    <h1>Who Owns Wynn Casino In Vegas Crosswinds Casino Morongo Casino Room Rates Casinos In Denver Colorado</h1>

<p>3 Oaks Gaming has signed a new important partnership with Hub88, a platform that is a subsidiary of Yolo Investments, and that provides platform solutions for the iGaming sector. 3 Oaks Gaming is a fairly new supplier and developer of casino games and marketing tools, and it has been securing one important commercial milestone after another.</p>
<p>3 Oaks Gaming Joins Hub88 Platform</p>
<p>Hub88 will have access to a range of titles provided by 3 Oaks Gaming, including but hardly limited to Hit the Gold, Green Chili, and Sun of Egypt 3, among others. Hub88’s network of partners has been growing rapidly, and operators will now have the opportunity to also benefit from some of the most worthwhile titles delivered by the up-and-coming developer of titles.</p>
<p>3 Oaks Gaming is happy to have added Hub88 as a partner, following collaborations with prominent iGaming companies such as EveryMatrix, iSoftBet and Parimatch, among others. 3 Oaks Gaming was founded in 2021 and it has been rapidly scaling up its production pace, reach, and presence with leading operators and in important markets.</p>
<p>Commenting on this opportunity, 3 Oaks Gaming managing director Sebastian Damian said that the company was thrilled at the opportunity to further expand its product offer. He added:</p>
<p>We continue to go from strength to strength and this collaboration is yet another example of the impact that our games are making on the industry. 3 Oaks Gaming managing director Sebastian Damian</p>
<p>Hub88 managing director Jose Micallef was similarly excited at the opportunity and said that the company was continuously looking to bring to its network of partners the most promising games and products. 3 Oaks Gaming makes a fantastic fit as part of this mission.</p>
<p>“Our platform now has a top-tier collection of slots available, and we look forward to bringing this impressive content to even more players,” Micallef said. As 3 Oaks Gaming’s clout continues to grow, the company has brought Krasimir Pankovski as its new head of sales. The company also secured a license to expand in Italy.</p>
