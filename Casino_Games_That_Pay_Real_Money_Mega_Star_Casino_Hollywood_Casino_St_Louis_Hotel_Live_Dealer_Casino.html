    <h1>Casino Games That Pay Real Money Mega Star Casino Hollywood Casino St Louis Hotel Live Dealer Casino</h1>

<p>Hello, I am sorry to warn you against these scammers. It will explain everything step by step. I see that it’s happened to other players 2 and i don’t understand how this things can happen repetitively.</p>
<p>The casino does not want to pay me my winnings of 320.000 HUF. In total, I left 1.400.000 HUF in the casino.</p>
<p>I've been waiting for a payment for a long time now and it's the same every time.</p>
<p>First, I ordered a payment on mastercard. I used the same method. I waited about 4 days. The money was returned back to the casino account. To make it funnier, they counted it as another payment and told me to turn again to be able to withdraw. After a series of messages from my side, I ordered it for a bank transfer. Same situation. Money back after 5 days. According to them, a technical error. Comedy and embarrassment I have already lost hope of getting my deposit back. Currently, I am waiting for the fifth time for the fifth day for payment, but I know that tomorrow will be the same. And the money is back in the account. I am hoping you can help me find a way to deal with them or file a lawsuit against them. Now actually i still have 2 withdraw, i will attache the pictures: 1 of 300.000 and 1 of 320.000 HUF and still have 780.000 HUF in ballance.</p>
