<p>The popular developer of iGaming content has extended its local presence in the Baltic market by signing with a prominent local operator</p>
<p>LV Bet, a company that provides both casino and sports betting products, has teamed up with Gaming Corps to strengthen its library of available games. The Swedish supplier will bring its premium games to the operator and allow players to experience some of the most worthwhile and exciting games there are.</p>
<p>Stealing Another March in the Baltics</p>
<p>Among the titles that LV Bet will have access to are such titles as Plinko, Slot, Crash, Mine, and Table, titles all of which will be integrated with the operator. Individual titles include Coin Miner 2, Luke E. Chance and the Book of Luck and Raging Zeus.</p>
<p>Gaming Corps CCO Danielle Calafato welcomed this opportunity and said that he was excited to see his company gain a further foothold in the Latvian market with one of the most prominent operators in the country:</p>
<p>This is a very significant step forward as part of our plans to bring our games to more and more players in Latvia. I look forward to working with LV Bet and offering our first-class casino and video games content to LV Bet’s players. Gaming Corps CCO Danielle Calafato</p>

<p>“This will allow us to further strengthen LV Bet’s online casino offering, and we look forward to what should be a very successful partnership,” Sobieraj concluded. This is the first time Gaming Corps has launched in Latvia after the company secured a license to operate in the jurisdiction late last month.</p>
<p>Gaming Corps has also been expanding with aggregators and individual operators. The company signed a distribution partnership with QTech Games, a platform focused on the emerging Asian market. In similar news, the supplier also inked a partnership to work with Coolbet.</p>
