<p>Juventus vs. AS Roma is arguably the most interesting Serie A duel of the last weekend of 2023. The game is on the program on Saturday, December 30, at Allianz Stadium in Turin</p>
<p>Juventus is the only team that seems capable of leapfrogging Inter to the No. 1 spot in the 2023-24 Italian Serie A table. The black-and-whites are in top shape right now – they’re without a single loss since September.</p>
<p>AS Roma hasn’t been as great, but Jose Mourinho’s men did beat the reigning Serie A champions AS Roma last weekend.</p>

<p>Juventus Needs to Keep Winning to Stay in the Title Race</p>
<p>Ahead of the 18th round of the 2023-24 Serie A, Juventus is sitting in second spot in the standings, with four points behind Inter Milan. The good news for the boys from Turin is that they’ve been playing fantastic soccer over the last couple of months, being undefeated since September.</p>
<p>Another thing going in their favor is that they’re without a single loss at home in Serie A this season. Further, they have a very good record against AS Roma at Allianz Stadium in Turin, winning eight of their last 10 duels.</p>
<p>What’s not going in their favor is that they’re going to miss many first-team players in Saturday’s game. Andrea Cambiaso is suspended, the same as Nicolo Fagioli. Further, Alex Sandro, Mattia De Sciglio, and Moise Kean are out with injuries, while Manuel Locatelli and Federico Chiesa are listed as questionable.</p>
<p>Can AS Roma Slay Another Serie A Giant?</p>
<p>AS Roma is fifth in the 2023-24 Serie A standings with an 8-4-5 record. In their most recent game, they defeated Napoli 2-0, which may seem like a great achievement. However, there’s a caveat – Napoli played without two players who got red-carded.</p>
<p>Before winning against Napoli, AS Roma lost 2-0 to Bologna on the road. And before that game, they drew 1-1 with Fiorentina. Knowing all this, it’s clear that these guys aren’t in great form. They probably know this, which is why they probably don’t plan to go for a win on Saturday.</p>
<p>Instead, we could see AS Roma “park the bus” in front of their goal and try to get themselves a point. Their coach Jose Mourinho is an expert when it comes to defensive tactics, so, who knows, it might work on them.</p>
<p>Juventus vs. AS Roma Prediction</p>
<p>Our prediction for Saturday’s Juventus vs. AS Roma Serie A game is that the home team will win. Juventus is just better than AS Roma even with all those absentees. They will probably win, but we’re not sure they’re going to score a lot of goals as the visitors are likely to defend with all they’ve got.</p>
<p>Pick: Juventus &amp; Under 2.5 Goals</p>
