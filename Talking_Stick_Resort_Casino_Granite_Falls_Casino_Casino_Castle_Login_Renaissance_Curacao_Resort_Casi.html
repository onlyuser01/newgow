<p>The dynamic and innovative iGaming company that is a part of NeoGames, Pariplay, expanded further the portfolio of partners for its Fusion platform thanks to a new agreement. On Tuesday, the company confirmed it inked a fresh agreement with ELYSIUM Studios, a leading provider of social, casino and video games.</p>
<p>The terms of the new partnership will see the game developer reach new markets and customers thanks asPariplay Fusion partner. Per the terms of the new deal, eye-catching content from ELYSIUM Studios will be integrated into the platform.</p>
<p>Such games include Sword King, ELYSIUM VIP and Spirit Hunters, among other hit games that will become available for Pariplay's network of partners after they are integrated into the aggregator's Fusion platform.</p>
<p>Sergio Jacob, ELYSIUM Studios' Chief Executive Officer, shared his excitement about the new deal in a statement saying: "We believe that we have created a portfolio of games that are truly unique, and which will appeal to a wide range of players around the world."</p>
<p>He explained that the collaboration with Pariplay will help the company expand its global footprint and team up with operators in new jurisdictions. Finally, Jacob said: "It is a landmark deal for us, and we look forward to putting our content in front of as many players as possible."</p>
<p>Enrico Bradamante, Pariplay's Chief Commercial Officer, also acknowledged the importance of the new collaboration. He said that the company plans to continue extending its reach while at the same time teaming up with leading studios that deliver exciting experiences for online players.</p>
<p>"ELYSIUM Studios does exactly that, with its range of titles that are highly polished and which carry influences from video gaming as well as online casino," explained Bradamante. In conclusion, he said: "It is exactly the sort of partner we are looking to bring on to the Fusion platform and I am sure we will enjoy a great deal of success together."</p>
<p>Details of the new collaboration emerged after recently, Pariplay inked a content deal with Betsson, a leading operator within the iGaming vertical. Announced in mid-February, the collaboration saw the operator gain access to a portfolio of content from Pariplay's Fusion platform.</p>
<p>Without any doubt, the Fusion platform's partners will benefit from the new collaboration by tapping into new games from ELYSIUM Studios. As noted, the deal will help the company reach new strategic markets, but it will also bring benefits for Pariplay. This is because the new collaboration expands further the content of the company's platform.</p>
