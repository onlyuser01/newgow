    <h1>Belterra Casino Resort Free Spins Casino No Deposit Excalibur Hotel Casino Indian Casino Near Me Mgm</h1>

<p>I have withdrawn with this casino online a few times recently. Never had any problems or complaints until I spent $3,000 in about 2 days and won a little over $5,200. I submitted my withdrawal request earlier in that day, the term say You must submit you're withdrawal request before 5:00 p.m. I was well before that. I spent that 2 days on and off almost constantly determined to get enough to buy this car I wanted. I was so excited to finally achieve my goal only to receive an email 2 hours later after I submitted my request that I needed to gamble more and bet higher and something about playthrough that is not on their terms or withdrawal conditions or anything anywhere. I've tried customer service since the 16th over and over and over asking why begging for my money back not threatening not anything derogatory and have received nothing except how can we help you everyday on the messenger they've not responded to my emails and my withdrawal that was normally processed every single day has not been processed has been sitting there for days not been touched because I tried to withdraw $4,000 right after they rejected it instead of $5, 000 which is their limit to see if I can get that but no one's responded my accounts not been touched it's not been you know tried to cash out like they were doing everyday it's just like I won the money they got my money and now I'm being ignored if they don't want to pay me the money I want maybe I could just get my money back I literally spent $3,000 in 2 days because that was my winnings that I had from our local casino there was a car I wanted I have two kids and no car and it's just really frustrating this is one of my absolute favorite casinos online I loved it I never had a problem until I actually won money I would have never have spent that much money had I not trusted them and they had always responded to everything before this.</p>
