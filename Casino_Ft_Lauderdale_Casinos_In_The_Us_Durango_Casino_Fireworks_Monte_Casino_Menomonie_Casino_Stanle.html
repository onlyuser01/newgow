<p>The fast-growing provider of content for the online gambling industry, Gaming Corps, announced a new European-facing partnership on Tuesday. The company revealed that it strengthened its presence on the Old Continent by teaming up with the iGaming operator in Romania, Stanleybet. Growing its list of partners, Gaming Corps agreed to provide the operator with its complete portfolio of games.</p>
<p>As a result, Stanleybet customers in the country will be able to access fan-favorite mine and crash games from Gaming Corps. Moreover, the deal involves the provider's pinko, table and slot titles, delivering engaging experiences. Such games include recent hits like Wild Woof, Book of Luck, Paddy's Payouts and Luke E.Chance. Additionally, players of the operator in Romania will gain access to fan-favorite games from Gaming Corps like Coin Miner 2 and Raging Zeus, among others.</p>
<p>For Stanleybet, the partnership will strengthen its offering, bringing new and entertaining games to its growing customer base in Romania. On the other hand, Gaming Corps will also benefit from the latest agreement by propelling the reach of its quality games and engaging with new customers.</p>
<p>Danielle Calafato, Gaming Corps' Chief Commercial Officer, shared her excitement about the latest agreement in a statement released on October 10, 2023. She explained: "Stanleybet has built its reputation across more than two decades in the gaming industry, and it is a pleasure for us to be able to supply them with our premium gaming content."</p>
<p>Calafato spoke about the importance of the regulated gambling market in Romania, explaining that the launch represents a major milestone for the company. "I very much look forward to offering our games to Stanleybet Romania’s players and I’m certain they will enjoy playing them," she said in conclusion.</p>
<p>Catalin Moise, Stanleybet Romania's Chief Operations Officer, was similarly thrilled regarding the latest collaboration. "We always aim to offer our players the most exciting and engaging games on the market, and Gaming Corps’ games portfolio certainly ties in with that," he explained. Last but not least, Moise pointed out: "I am excited by this partnership and look forward to working with Gaming Corps; a games developer which continues to produce original and successful games."</p>
<p>The agreement with Stanleybet in Romania follows another recent deal by Gaming Corps. Earlier this month, the company revealed it joined forces with Rhino Entertainment Group, a fast-growing iGaming operator. As a result of that deal, the iGaming content provider expanded further the reach of its games.</p>
