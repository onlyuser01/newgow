    <h1>Yavapai Casino Blue Water Resort And Casino Arizona Angel In The Winds Casino New Casino No Deposit</h1>

<p>The leading casino-entertainment company in the US and one of the most recognized operators, Caesars Entertainment, revealed it achieved double "A" score for its corporate transparency and performance on climate change and water security</p>
<p>The prestigious recognition came Friday by CDP, a non-profit charity that discloses what impact companies have on the environment. Last year, Caesars scored “B”, but this year, the company entered CDP’s annual “A list.” Caesars was among a short list of companies that were able to achieve a double “A” after 15,000 scored.</p>
<p>Caesars Reaches CDP’s “A” List</p>
<p>The CDP uses an independent and detailed methodology to assess the operations of companies. Each company is given a score between A and D-. The score itself is based on different factors that include management and awareness of environmental risks, showing best practices, environmental leadership including setting targets and more.</p>
<p>“Caesars Entertainment, the largest casino-entertainment company in the US, has been recognized for corporate transparency and performance on climate change and water security by global environmental non-profit CDP, securing a place on its annual “A” List,“ reads a statement released by Caesars Entertainment</p>
<p>Besides the recognition from the CDP, Caesars achieved another prestigious recognition recently. The operator was named one of the most responsible companies in America by Statista Inc and Newsweek. This marked Caesars’ fourth consecutive recognition. The gaming and entertainment giant explained that the recognition was based on “publicly available key performance indicators derived from CSR Reports, Sustainability Reports, and other reports as well as an independent survey.” Those indicators focused on Caesars’ performance in terms of environmental, social and corporate governance achievements. What’s more, as noted, the evaluation included an independent survey as well.</p>
<p>The Company Is Excited to Be Recognized for Its CSR Policies</p>
<p>The recent recognitions come as no surprise, considering Caesars’ People Planet Play framework that is a pillar of the company’s corporate social responsibility initiatives. For each of the components of the comprehensive framework the company sets different goals and ultimately seeks to “strengthen its overall CSR impact and contribution.”</p>
<p>“It’s our priority to continue to grow and develop new practices to build upon Caesars’ long-standing commitment to corporate social responsibility and we’re thrilled to have made it on the very small double “A” list for our transparency and commitment to fighting climate change and making our company and communities a better place.“ Heather Rapp, SVP of corporate social responsibility for Caesars Entertainment</p>
<p>Heather Rapp, Caesars’ SVP of corporate social responsibility, shared her excitement saying that the company is honored to be recognized for its sustainability and CSR efforts. She added that Caesars is excited to enter the short double “A” list of CDP. Finally, Rapp said that the company will continue to work on and improve practices related to corporate social responsibility.</p>
