<p>Bandits and Bounties Slot Review</p>
<p>Bandits and Bounties is a punchy slot game by Nucleus Gaming that features Wild and Stickies, a Special Wanted Symbol, and more to make the gameplay more exciting and fun. Coming with a five-by-three grid gameplay, and 20 paylines, the game will let you bet anything between $0.20 and $20 at an average payout rate of 97% which is well above industry standard.</p>
<p>There are tons of excellent bonus features, including The Sheriff’s Wild Boost, Sticky Wilds, and the Dead or Alive Free Spins adding to the thematic completeness of the game which is clearly determined to give you a proper welcome to the Wild West, the occasional lawlessness, and smoke-ridden saloons. If you ever wanted what it is to be a cowboy in the Wild West, Bandits, and Bounties will mostly help you figure it out under the close supervision of the mustachioed sheriff.</p>
<p>Theme, Storyline, and Graphics: It Pays Off to Live Outside the Law</p>
<p>Alright, so clearly this is a Western-themed game, big whoop! But it is a big whoop, and it is mostly owing to how careful Nucleus Gaming was in creating the entire world of its slot game. Bandits and Bounties is not just rich in its visual storytelling.</p>
<p>It adds small and exciting animations to really tie the entire experience together. Let’s start with the symbols. They are highly stylized and borderless, allowing the saloon in the backdrop to show. Even more importantly, the symbols are very thematic, with a bottle of whisky, a pair of cards, card suits, cowboy hats, the sheriff, and wanted symbols posted all over the place.</p>
<p>Look at the sides of the slot, you have typical Wild West scenery with wagons stopped in the desert, surrounded by cacti and a landscape punctuated by canyons and ridges. A really nice touch here is the way paylines are announced with a small explosion of light that highlights your win and a sheriff badge wild symbol that will have bullets flying for an added thematic effect.</p>
<p>In terms of visuals and even how these graphics are tied to the gameplay, Nucleus Gaming has done an outstanding job with Bandits and Bounties, turning the slot into a game that you will love and want to play!</p>
<p>Bandits and Bounties Slot Game Symbols and Payouts</p>
<p>The symbols here are another matter of thematic accuracy and artistic prowess, with each one designed to help you immerse yourself in the captivating world of Bandits and Bounties slot game. The symbols here include low and high-paying ones, of course.</p>
<p>The low ones are card suits, such as clovers, diamonds, clubs, and hearts, and the high paying ones are used to add thematic heft to the game, with the cowboy’s shoes, hat, a pair of cards, a crate with a whiskey and glass, two pistols crossing their barrels, and the sheriff himself.</p>
<p>In terms of payouts, players can get $300 out of five sheriff symbols and $120 out of five twin pistols, and it’s hardly all there is. More symbols here include the WANTED POSTERS which serve as Scatter Symbols and may trigger the Free Spins level, but there are also the Sheriff Badges which are the Wild Symbols, as well as Sticky Wilds. You may also enjoy the Stick and Respin feature for even more added value!</p>
