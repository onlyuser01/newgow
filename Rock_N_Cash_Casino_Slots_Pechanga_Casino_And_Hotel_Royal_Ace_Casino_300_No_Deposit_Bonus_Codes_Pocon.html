    <h1>Rock N Cash Casino Slots Pechanga Casino And Hotel Royal Ace Casino 300 No Deposit Bonus Codes Pocon</h1>

<p>The supplier of innovative content has struck a third prominent content partnership in the fast-developing Spanish iGaming market</p>
<p>Wazdan will be delivering its content to Versus and both of its online casino brands that operate as licensed entities in the country, the namesake Versus and Wanabet. This partnership reflects on Wazdan’s sustained momentum in the iGaming sector in Europe, and Spain in particular.</p>
<p>The company will deploy a number of its prominent titles which will be available across Versus online casino properties, to wit Magic Spins, 9 Coins, Grand Gold Edition, Sizzling Kingdom, Sizzling Eggs, Burning Sun, and others.</p>
<p>Wazdan Sees Spain as Core Market for European Success</p>
<p>This partnership comes with a number of additional solutions, besides the game suite, including free spins promotion which is designed to help bolster engagement for each of the two respective brands.</p>
<p>Wazdan is also going to deploy its Player Engagement Suite which features outstanding and player-favorite mechanics that translate into robust bottom-line results for operators. Among the mechanics and features that Wazdan will bring as part of this experience are Sticky to Infinity, Cash Infinity, and Collect to Infinity among others.</p>
<p>Versus is one of the top-performing online casinos in Spain, meaning that Wazdan will significantly strengthen its local presence and help collaborate with a trusted and prominent local gaming brand. Wazdan CCO Andrzej Hyla was similarly pleased with the development and hailed it as a major achievement for his company in the market:</p>
<p>It is always exciting for us to be increasing our reach in the Spanish market, especially when it is with one of the top online casino operators in the country. Wazdan CCO Andrzej Hyla</p>
<p>Wazdan has been building its momentum across the European market in the meantime. The company entered the Czech Republic through a partnership with Apollo Games. Another partnership was signed at the end of last year to strengthen the supplier’s presence in the Swiss market with Grand Casino Luzern’s mycasino brand benefiting from Wazdan’s excellent iGaming library of products.</p>
