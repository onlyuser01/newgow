<p>Sportradar has become the First Official Betting Data Partner for US Soccer, with the company now in charge of the distribution of the federation’s data and content. Sportradar is a well-seasoned veteran in this vertical and will help US Soccer leverage its data in the most impactful and meaningful way possible, driving both fan engagement and the opportunity to generate additional commercial value for the federation.</p>
<p>Apart from this, Sportradar will also utilize its Universal Fraud Detection System (UFDS), Intelligence &amp; Investigation (I&amp;I) Services, Integrity Audition, and EducationPrevention tools in order to ensure that the federation and the company work together to tackle match-fixing and sports betting fraud, which have been growing in sports betting around the world, the partners said in a press release.</p>
<p>As per the terms of the deal, Sportradar will be distributing the data both in the United States and in international markets. The company has been granted exclusive rights to the federation's data, which includes its collection, licensing, and distribution. The purposes of data distribution include sports betting, as Sportradar has a network of more than 900 regulated sportsbooks and 350 media outlets all around the world.</p>
<p>This will significantly strengthen US Soccer’s global pull and reach, and lead to improved viewership, monetization opportunities, and future growth. The deal also covers 111 matches per year and it includes both the US Men’s and Women’s National Team competitions.</p>
<p>Sportradar EVP, Strategic Partnerships &amp; Content Eric Conrad said that this partnership reflected US Soccer’s own commitment to bring the sport to a much larger audience and introduce fans to the experiences they desire and seek out.</p>
<p>"We know that when fans place bets on a game, their interest in the sport intensifies," Conrad said, adding that he was confident in Sportradar’s own contributions to leading to better value for US Soccer.</p>
<p>US Soccer is making a mark on global soccer with USMNT and USWNT both appearing in several high-profile competitions in the coming years, including the 2024 Copa America, 2024 Concacaf W Gold Cup, 2026 FIFA Men’s World Cup and 2028 Olympic Games in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>US Soccer VP, Business Ventures Ross Moses was similarly pleased with the opportunity to be teaming up with Sportradar. "It’s massive," Moses explained. He hailed Sportradar’s commitment to protecting sports integrity and added that the company will have a key role to play in the federation’s efforts to broaden and strengthen its demographic outreach.</p>
