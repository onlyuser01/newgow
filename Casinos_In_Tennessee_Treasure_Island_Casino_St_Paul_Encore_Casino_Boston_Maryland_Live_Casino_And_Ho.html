<p>The technology-driven provider of end-to-end iGaming and iLottery solutions and content, NeoGames S.A., revealed it signed a new agreement, allowing it to expand its offering to customers in Pennsylvania. Earlier this week, the company confirmed it joined forces with Scientific Games and agreed to deliver premium content from its NeoGames Studio for the Pennsylvania Lottery.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the new three-year deal, games from the company's leading studio will be integrated into Scientific Games' platform, allowing customers of the Pennsylvania Lottery to access unique and thrilling titles.</p>
<p>Per the new deal, Lottery customers in the state will benefit from NeoGames Studio's award-winning eInstant games. Judging by a statement released by NeoGames, the thrilling and engaging games are expected to reach customers in the state soon.</p>
<p>Hili Shakked, NeoGames Studio's Managing Director, said about the new deal: "Through this partnership with Scientific Games and the Pennsylvania Lottery, we are able to bring our premium eInstant games to a large new market of players." He outlined that this content agreement reaffirms the Studio's dedication to delivering engaging, innovative and unique games that cater to the lottery vertical. "We are confident that this long-term agreement will be a win-win for all stakeholders," explained Shakked in conclusion.</p>
<p>Currently, NeoGames' in-house games studio, NeoGames Studio, has nearly two decades of experience in delivering captivating eInstant games. The in-house games studio helped develop more than 250 games since it was founded and that number continues to grow. Now, thanks to the latest collaboration, the in-house games studio will be able to further expand its footprint in North America, reaching clients in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>It's no surprise that those efforts have captured the attention of the gambling sector with NeoGames securing many awards. Most recently, the in-house games studio's Desert Fantasy eInstant game was recognized as the Best New Game at the 2023 EGR North America Awards.</p>
<p>Drew Svitko, Pennsylvania Lottery's Executive Director, explained that the new collaboration with NeoGames brings excitement to the Lottery. He pointed out that the collaboration will boost its iLottery platform by delivering new titles.</p>
<p>"We are always looking for innovative ways to enhance the digital games experience for our valued players and NeoGames Studio has a content portfolio that is packed with entertaining experiences," added Svitko. In conclusion, he predicted that the collaboration and enhanced iLottery options will help engage with new audiences and boost the Lottery's mission to provide proceeds for important programs in the state.</p>
