    <h1>Palace Station Hotel Casino Las Vegas Bettendorf Iowa Casinos Ip Hotel And Casino In Biloxi Seneca R</h1>

<p>Dear Sandor,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. Iâ€™m very sorry to hear about your negative experience. You've become a victim of a scam casino. No fair online casino requires players to pay taxes in order to withdraw their winnings. Players usually must pay the taxes to the relevant financial institution in the country in which he resides, and never to the casino. In this case, the best option is to contact the police authority, not the Casino.Guru forum. We try our best to settle players' disputes, but unfortunately, we are powerless against such fraudulent schemes.</p>
<p>There is a service that could help you recover your lost funds - mychargeback.com in case you paid the tax by credit card, so I would recommend that you contact them to find out if there is any chance and, of course, contact your local police department.</p>
<p>I apologize for not being more helpful.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Kristina</p>
