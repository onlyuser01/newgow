<p>On Monday, BetMGM officially received approval from the Indiana Gaming Commission to launch a mobile sports betting offering in Indiana. This sports betting app is a product of Roar Digital which is the joint venture between MGM Resorts International and GVC Holdings.</p>
<p>While there is a lot of excitement pertaining to the addition of a fifth sports betting option in the state, the move was expected. After the state’s gaming commission announced that it has approved BetMGM’s application for a temporary vendor license it was rather clear that their entry into the market was inevitable.</p>
<p>The BetMGM mobile sportsbook will now be operating through a licensing agreement that Roar Digital signed with Belterra Casino Resort. This partnership with an entity in the state was one of the requirements laid out by the gaming regulator.</p>
<p>In addition to that, just like other online sportsbooks in Indiana, the BetMGM mobile betting app was required to satisfy a long list of other requirements that sought to address a number of issues. These include taxation, licensing terms and even the functionality of the apps. The press release that announced the approval confirmed that the sports betting service provider had met all of these requirements.</p>
<p>“BetMGM has substantially demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Commission that its mobile sports wagering operation meets the requirements of Indiana Code Article 4-38, the Commission’s Emergency Regulations, all of Commission Directives related to sports wagering activities,” reads a note from the executive director of the Indiana Gaming Commission.</p>
<p>Now, sports bettors in Indiana can enjoy more options as well as wagering opportunities on a vast range of markets across the United States as well as other parts of the globe.</p>
<p>The State of Indiana Sports Betting</p>
<p>Sports betting in Indiana has evolved immensely thanks to the entry of a number of big brands into the market. Some of the most notable names in this regard include DraftKings and FanDuel. Online gambling has also been on the rise and this has fostered a lot of growth in the gambling sector.</p>
<p>For now, the state’s sports betting market has also been bolstered significantly by the neighboring states of Michigan and Illinois. While both states have already approved sports betting activities, their markets are yet to go live. As such, sports bettors in both states have turned to the nearest options which happen to be in Indiana.</p>
<p>Still, there are many more developments coming to Indiana’s sports betting market in the near future. As it stands, two more operators, that is PointsBet and BetIndiana are expected to go live very soon – they currently hold temporary vendor licenses.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, BetMGM has several more launched planned across the United States. Indiana was the fourth state they brought their sports betting app to and they are currently eyeing more regulated markets. The neighboring state of Michigan is one of their primary targets.</p>
