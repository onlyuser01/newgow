<p>GAN Limited has revealed that it has completed the Ainsworth Game Technology Limited online gaming content to Churchill Downs Incorporated’s TwinSpires, through its dedicated SuperRGS aggregation platform.</p>
<p>GAN follows up on an earlier agreement with Ainsworth to obtain exclusive online rights over the latter’s online games. GAN’s acquisition of Ainsworth was motivated by the former’s desire to expand in the US gaming market, which is expected to continue growing and far outstripped the current sports betting vertical.</p>
<p>The full portfolio of Ainsworth games consists of over 70 unique titles, with more coming in the pipeline, although their number is not readily known to the public.</p>
<p>Ainsworth Pivotal for GAN’s Future Success</p>
<p>Following the acquisition, GAN is now able to provide leading operators with the content, including TwinSpires in Michigan. To this end, the company is using the dedicated SuperRGS solution that helps it distribute gaming software seamlessly while factoring in numerous consumer and business preferences. Speaking about the launch, GAN CEO Dermot Smurfit had this to say:</p>
<p>We are excited to launch our first major client of Super RGS and feature the leading portfolio of Ainsworth’s proven online titles. This is a key inflection point for Super RGS as we believe most iGaming operators in the US will become clients of our Super RGS in relatively short order. GAN CEO Dermot Smurfit</p>
<p>SuperRGS Is the Perfect Way to Distribute Content</p>
<p>Smurfit is confident that SuperRGS will play a key role in boosting the company revenue stream and also expand to new customer bases. Ainsworth Online general manager Jason Lim welcomed the news with equal confidence in the success of the future collaboration between the companies.</p>
<p>The integration with GAN has been a milestone to celebrate and a positive experience for all parties, Lim explained. The integration will allow more partners from iGaming states to benefit from Ainsworth and GAN’s products all throughout 2022 and beyond.</p>
<p>Lim added that B2C demand for the company’s products remains strong, and Ainsworth is looking to significantly scale up its production, although no exact number of how many new titles to expect was provided.</p>
<p>Ainsworth’s new distribution integration with GAN is only one of many positive events for the company, which wrapped up a successful FY2021.</p>
