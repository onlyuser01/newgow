<p>PointsBet Now Official Sports Betting Partner of the Indianapolis Colts</p>
<p>The global sportsbook operator PointsBet has announced a new partnership with the Indianapolis Colts. Under the partnership deal, PointsBet becomes an official sports betting partner of the NFL franchise. Moreover, under the deal, PointsBet receives the right for usage of Indianapolis Colts marks and logos.</p>
<p>The sportsbook operator will be able to access both brand visibility and sponsorship options across digital channels. The new partnership also named PointsBet as a presenting sponsor of the “Official Colts Podcast”. Furthermore, under the agreement with the Colts, PointsBet can now access and advertise via social media and mobile app.</p>
<p>Ensuring supreme experience for Indiana sports fans PointsBet is going to offer the best price on the market for all Indianapolis Colts games this season. According to the statement of PointsBet, Colts fans can now enjoy the innovative “Crowd Booster” promotion, which is highly popular among the clients of the sportsbook operator.</p>

<p>(@PointsBetIN) — PointsBet Sportsbook (@PointsBetUSA) September 24, 2020</p>
<p>Here is what, Johnny Aitken, PointsBet USA CEO said in a statement about the partnership: “PointsBet is thrilled to partner with the Colts, aligning with this great organization and its hugely passionate fanbase.” He outlined that PointsBet is the only sportsbook partner of the Colts and the Indiana Pacers and that the company is extremely proud of that.</p>
<p>Aitken deemed Indiana as a “fantastic sports state”. He added that PointsBet has prioritized its presence in the state and it looks forward to continuing to serve the sports bettors in Indiana this season alongside the great partner Indianapolis Colts.</p>
<p>Back in August, PointsBet revealed the locations of three new venues in Illinois and signed a multi-year partnership with the Indiana Pacers. With the most recent move, we can only say that the premier sportsbook operator is significantly increasing its presence in the state.</p>
<p>Focusing on the bigger picture, we see that PointsBet is committed to innovation and expansion. Earlier this month, the company signed a historic agreement with the Colorado Buffaloes. Under a first of its kind agreement, the betting firm signed a partnership deal with the University of Colorado and its NCAA franchise, the Colorado Buffaloes.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, two weeks ago, PointsBet entered the Illinois sports betting market and signed a deal with the Chicago Bears NFL team. The sports betting operator launched online, mobile and retail sports betting for fans in the Prairie State. But under the partnership with the Chicago Bears, PointsBet will offer exclusive market prices for the team’s games in Illinois. Keeping in mind the recent key partnerships, we can honestly say that PointsBet is a proactive company, focused on success and expansion.</p>
