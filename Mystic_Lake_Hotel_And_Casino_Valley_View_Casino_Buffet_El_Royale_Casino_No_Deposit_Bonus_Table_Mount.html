    <h1>Mystic Lake Hotel And Casino Valley View Casino Buffet El Royale Casino No Deposit Bonus Table Mount</h1>

<p>My account was officially closed as of 3/2021. I had gave up after they ran me in circles for nearly 6 months. It also makes no sense they paid me withdrawals multiple times without an issue until I win 35k. Below was my final response I received</p>
<p>3.6. You will be assigned a numerical Account ID. You may also be able to log in to your Account using your email address. You must treat your user Account ID and password as confidential and not disclose any part of them to anyone else. We have the right to disable any user Account ID, password whether chosen by you or assigned by us, at any time, if in our opinion you have failed to comply with any of the provisions of these Terms of Service. You are responsible for ensuring that no one else (particularly, but without limitation to, those who may share your internet connection) is able to make use of your Account ID (or email address) and password and you shall be responsible for all transactions that take place on your Account whether or not you knew or consented to such transactions taking place.</p>
<p>6.2. If, in our reasonable discretion, we determine that a player has engaged in fraudulent, unlawful, dishonest or improper activity (including, without limitation, the usage of a VPN, proxy or similar service that masks or manipulates the identification of your real location, the provision of false or deliberately misleading information or by making bets, wagers or poker play through a third party or on behalf of a third party), we reserve the right to immediately terminate or deny a player access to their Account. In such event, all Account balances (including both deposits and any winnings) shall be forfeited and we reserve the right to disclose information (including the identity of the player) to applicable parties including, but not limited to, banks, credit card companies and/or any person or entity that has the legal right to such information, and/or is taking legal action against such player.</p>
<p>6.4. Bonus programs are intended for recreational players only. Professional players or players considered, in our sole discretion, to be abusing the bonus system by any means may have bonuses revoked and be subject to further sanctions. Bonus abuse may be defined as (but not restricted to) clients cashing out for the purpose of re-depositing, depositing on top of an existing balance, or creating new Accounts that they are using themselves. Sanctions may be in the form of increased rollover requirements or loss of bonus privileges altogether for the offending Account as well as any linked Accounts. We reserve the right to restrict eligibility for special offers and bonuses when necessary. This includes but is not limited to placing geographic restrictions on match bonuses due to bonus abuse. Please refer to the Help section for further information regarding additional details concerning the eligibility, conditions, terms and usage of bonuses offered.</p>
<p>After careful review and analysis, we cannot assist you any further as Ignition Casino’s actions are in line with the Terms of Use you agreed upon when you created the account(s) on 12/10/2020. Given your withdrawals well exceed that of your deposit history, there will be no reinstatement of funds – which the DRO fully supports.</p>
<p>We thank you again for contacting the office of the dispute resolution and would like to remind you that by contacting the DRO, this ruling is final and it is at Ignition Casino's sole discretion with whom they choose to do business with.</p>
