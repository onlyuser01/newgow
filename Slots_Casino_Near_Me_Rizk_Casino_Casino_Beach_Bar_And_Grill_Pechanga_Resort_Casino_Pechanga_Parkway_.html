<p>SLOT V CASINO NAME CHANGED TO CRICV</p>
<p>Last October 2022 I signed up to slotv casino I am from India ... And somehow they transferred my account to cricv casino it's the same casino only name is changed .. from last October I am begging these guys to permanently ban me completely but they took advantage of my situation and addiction and kept me on their site saying they don't have option to ban me permanently they will say to just logout of my account and never log back in .</p>
<p>I have been telling them that I am a complete Gambling addict and even made them to close account but they are just playing in the past when I requested them to close my account they closed it when I ask them to reopen they would reopen within seconds so what's the point of self exclusion I have closed my account more than 10 times and they would reopen the next day when I asked sometimes they would even laugh at me in live chat when I ask them to close my account they would say that u will be back tomorrow again to ask to reopen ur account so y r u wasting my time like that ... In last 5 months they have given me a vip manager so whenever I ask them to close my account they will ask me to wait for 1 business days but they never permanently close my account due to this from last 1 year I have lost 5000 $ on this site . I need some kind of refund from this site they have completely spoiled my life</p>
<p>I don't have any work , I have lost everything on their site the worst part is from 1 year I asked them to ban me but they never did till today</p>
<p>Pls guide me and do something about this site</p>
