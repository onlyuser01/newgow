<p>Hi</p>
<p>Really appreciate the time and effort in responding to me.</p>
<p>I have just received the following email</p>
<p>Dear Mr. LastName,</p>
<p>We are writing regarding your recent withdrawal request placed at Las Vegas Casino.</p>
<p>We wish to thank you for your patience while we reviewed the documents provided and account information.</p>
<p>After finalising this review, it was concluded that your game play is in breach of the Terms and Conditions agreed upon registration.</p>
<p>We note that your play strategy was systematically applied in a pattern meant to create an unfair advantage and such, obtain winnings that are not legitimate and such, any outcome resulting from accessing our services is being considered as null, and any profits voided.</p>
<p>We concluded that the below-mentioned terms in the casino’s Clause of Use were breached:</p>
<p>C. Subordination to the Terms and Conditions and the Binding Effect Thereof</p>
<ol>
<li>By using the Site, registering at the Site, or by participating in one of the Services, You agree to be bound by and to act in accordance with the Terms and Conditions, as they may be updated from time to time, without any reservation.</li>

<p>E. Account Registration</p>
<ol>
<li>You further represent, warrant, acknowledge and undertake that (a) You will not use Your Account, and will not allow any third party to use Your Account, for any Prohibited Actions and/or perform any Irregular Playing Patterns, (b) in case You will perform any Prohibited Action the Company shall be entitled to disclose any and all of Your details and information to the relevant authorities, and to suspend Your Account (including freezing all funds deposited within) and void all bonuses, winnings and bonus winnings in Your Account.</li>
</ol>
<p>F. Prohibited Actions</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Without derogating from any other provision of these Terms and Conditions, if the Company determines that You are engaging in or have engaged in Prohibited Actions and/or Irregular Playing Patterns, or have attempted to do so, then the Company shall be entitled to close Your Account, withhold, seize and confiscate all funds in Your Account (including, but not limited to, any deposits and winnings in Your Account).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Prohibited Actions" shall mean illegal, unlawful, fraudulent, or other improper activities - including, but not limited to:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>• abuse in order to gain advantage to the detriment of other Player(s) and/or Us;</p>
<ol>
<li>"Irregular Playing Patterns" shall mean the following activities:</li>
</ol>
<p>• building a balance and significantly changing play patterns;</p>
<p>• on roulette, in the following cases: (a) covering 24 or more of the 37 available numbers;</p>
<p>The above-described actions were applied throughout your gameplay and systematically built the winnings which were later on placed in a withdrawal request.</p>
<p>The Terms you agreed to in order to be able to use the casino services clearly state this type of gameplay is deemed as irregular and not permitted, and if applied, any winnings obtained will be revoked.</p>
<p>Please note that these actions to undermine the casino’s simple rules and trespass into a restricted realm constitutes a severe infringement of our Terms and Conditions and it is within the player’s sole responsibility to ensure that the services are accessed in good faith, not with an abusive play pattern.</p>
<p>Considering the seriousness of the issue described, we ascertain that we must abide by the above-mentioned terms and proceed accordingly in revoking your winnings and refunding your deposits.</p>
<p>Please note that this is the final determination of the company and that your account will remain permanently blocked due to the breach in Terms.</p>
