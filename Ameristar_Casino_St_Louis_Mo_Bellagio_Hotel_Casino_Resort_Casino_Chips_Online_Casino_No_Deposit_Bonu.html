    <h1>Ameristar Casino St Louis Mo Bellagio Hotel Casino Resort Casino Chips Online Casino No Deposit Bonu</h1>

<p>GGPoker and King’s slots s.r.o have received the go-ahead to enter the Czech Republic’s online gaming market, bringing poker and gaming opportunities to local players. The license was awarded by the Ministry of Finance of the Czech Republic and comes after careful consideration of the applicants.</p>
<p>To make sure its brand is recognizable, GGPoker is launching under a localized domain extension, ".cz" which will focus exclusively on the market and help players find a new home to play online poker, the company said. The Czech Republic is both a hub for land-based poker and now pivoting even more heavily toward online play.</p>
<p>GGPoker, which is a global brand, promises players in the country to get access to round-the-clock gaming opportunities, which will include various tournaments and cash games, all underpinned and powered by the company’s robust software and platform.</p>
<p>Commenting on this opportunity, GGPoker Head of Europe Marco Trucco thanked for the opportunity to extend the company’s brand and product offering to Czech players with the help of King’s slots s.r.o. Trucco assured that GGPoker will bring much of new opportunities to players in 2023 and well beyond, including WSOP satellites, big prize tournaments, and more.</p>
<p>King’s Entertainment group majority shareholder Leon Tsoukernik was similarly pleased with the development to see the two companies come together for a pivotal development in the poker scene in the Czech Republic. He hailed GGPoker’s brand and said that he was looking forward to working closely with the card room in Europe.</p>
<p>"The timing of this launch is particularly significant as King’s Casino celebrates 20 years in the market and our business continues to grow from strength to strength," Tsoukernik said. GGPoker is already setting up shop, but the website is not immediately available to play on the market, the company explains in a press release.</p>
<p>The launch is set for the "near future," according to the latest update on the GGPoker’s blog. Once it goes live, though, GGPoker.cz is unlikely to lack players. In June, GGPoker added Ali Nejad and Jeff Gross to its team of ambassadors.</p>
