<p>The Luxemburg-based slot games provider Zitro has scored an agreement with the Spanish gambling operator KirolBet. The deal will see Zitro’s offerings launched in a new casino location.</p>
<p>Zitro and KirolBet Launch 88 Link in Galicia</p>
<p>As per the deal, KirolBet will launch Zitro’s 88 Link game in its gambling venue in Boiro, Spain. Thanks to this, local bettors will get to play the critically-acclaimed title on the venue’s Zitro Allure cabinets and enjoy a peak betting experience with high visual quality.</p>
<p>Zitro’s 88 Link – Daruma Mystery was just nominated for the “top-performing game from an emerging supplier” category during the Annual EKG Slot Awards, making KitolBet’s decision to collaborate with the supplier extremely timely and strategic.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the agreement is a great chance for Zitro as it increases the provider’s presence in Spain. This is an important step for the B2B company as it has been heavily focused on the Spanish-speaking world and the LATAM region in particular. Zitro already has its products launched in several markets and continues seeking expansion.</p>
<p>Zitro is Glad to Grow Its Brand</p>
<p>Zitro is excited to launch its signature title in KirolBet’s venue in Boiro. The company noted that 88 Link is a revolutionary title that packs many of Zitro’s numerous innovative features. The title makes use of multiway game mechanics combined with Zitro’s popular bonus mechanics. The provider hopes that the local bettors will enjoy playing the title on the state-of-the-art Allure cabinets.</p>
<p>Zitro’s commercial delegate, Angel Montes, commented that he is thankful to KirolBet for working together with the B2B company. Montes is delighted to see 88 Link grow in popularity in Galicia and is excited by what the future will bring.</p>
<p>A KirolBet spokesperson added that the pleasure is all theirs, and the operator is very excited to offer 88 Link to the bettors. They said that the novelty of the title really sells it to the public and manages to appeal to bettors of all tastes.</p>
<p>Zitro was founded in 2007 and is a company that seeks to “open a new chapter” in the international gambling industry. The B2B firm is committed to innovating in its field, which can be seen in its revolutionary titles that combine fresh ideas with cutting-edge technology. Today several hundred people work to make Zitro’s vision of a refreshed betting experience come true.</p>
<p>Zitro recently expanded its footprint in Latin America as it received approval from Buenos Aires’ gambling authority and launched its offerings in the jurisdiction through a partnership with Codere Group.</p>
