<p>Greentube Adding “Something Different” to the Portfolio with Cyber Wildz</p>
<p>Packed with eye-catching features and excellent winning odds, the sci-fi-themed game revolves around two main characters responsible for handing out generous multipliers. Set against a mesmerizing, futuristic-looking cityscape with neon lights as the main backdrop, Greentube’s new game has everything you need to put your spinning skills to the real test.</p>
<p>As described by the chief financial officer/chief growth officer Michael Bauer, Cyber Wildz has helped Greentube “bring something different” to their premium portfolio by offering players incredible win opportunities with the help of the well-developed multipliers. Praising the theme of the game itself, Bauer also spoke about the elevating features and the “funky and futuristic premise” that are expected to attract lots of sci-fi aficionados from all parts of the world.</p>
<p>Multiplier Wilds and Free Spins Feature</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the main focus falls on Kray-Z the Reaper and Y-Pout the Assassin, the two-game characters that will make some spectacular appearances on the beautifully designed 6 x 5 grid.</p>
<p>Once Kray-Z the Reaper, which represents the Multiplier Wild, is seen popping on a win line, players’ winnings are automatically multiplied by x2, x3, or x5. Landing at least two more Multiplier Wilds on just one line will cause the Multiplier symbols to multiply themselves and eventually reread players with some massive wins.</p>
<p>Managing to land two Free Spins symbols during just one spin will engage the Free Spins Feature. There, Kray-Z will team up with Y-Pout the Assassin and start taking over the dystopian city. During the Free Spins feature, a random multiplier between x1 and x7 will show up on a Special Reel placed in the upper section of the screen.</p>
<p>The duo will take the roles of either Local or Global Modifiers with the Special Reel values going up once they are seen landing, just to award multiplied wins that can go as high as x20.</p>
<p>Local modifiers work by influencing the number displayed above the special reel. Global modifiers work by influencing the numbers shown in the Special Reel. The number of free spins will also automatically go back to three once a fresh modifier is seen landing.</p>
<p>Players can also take advantage of the Bonus Buy feature in some jurisdictions. The feature can be engaged during the base game in exchange for 100x the bet. Players who opt for this alternative benefit from standard multipliers that can go as high as 7x. Players who choose to pay 200x the bet can initiate the bonus round using multipliers worth up to 70x.</p>
<p>At the start of the year, Greentube announced its intention to take the iGaming world by storm and revolutionize it with the help of Greentube Mynt, a brand-new technology stack meant to fuel gaming companies with the needed tools to generate and distribute their games.</p>
