<p>FSB, a leading multi-channel supplier to the sports betting and iGaming industries, has unveiled a new digital product ahead of the FIFA World Cup. Prior to the highly-anticipated soccer event, the provider launched a new Companion App that its partners and players can use.</p>
<p>FSB Launches New Companion App</p>
<p>The Companion App was praised as a “further enhancement to the company’s burgeoning retail product” and is expected to provide end customers with a higher degree of flexibility. FSB explained that its new solution will provide players with the ability to transfer retail bets to the digital space.</p>
<p>The new digital product will allow users to take a bet they have placed within an anonymous retail environment and onboard it onto a digital wallet app. The new tech requires nothing more than a smartphone device and helps end users digitalize their bets while disposing of paper tickets. Furthermore, this process is reversible so players can transfer their bets back to retail by using a unique QR code.</p>
<p>FSB also noted that the Companion App can be branded end to end per operator. Its purpose is to allow players to better track their bets using their mobile phones. This will make withdrawals much easier as well while allowing players to carefully explore their personal betting history.</p>
<p>The supplier said that the new product will be inaugurated by a few of its partners next week, just in time for the FIFA World Cup tournament.</p>
<p>The Supplier Wants to Cater to Its Retail Partners</p>
<p>Russell Colvin, FSB’s head of retail, spoke about the new product. He revealed that supplying the company’s partners and players with innovative and fun retail experiences is something he very much wants to deliver. To that end, the Companion App will help blur the divide between digital and retail betting, allowing the supplier’s retail community to join the digital space and understand how to bolster engagement.</p>
<p>My team and I have worked tirelessly this year to build up a contemporary, feature-rich offering that enables us to carefully curate a required retail offering for our growing, global client base. This hard work will continue into 2023 and beyond. Russell Colvin, head of retail, FSB</p>
<p>The launch of the new retail sports betting product will further boost FSB’s growing portfolio of betting products. Thanks to the efficiency of its solutions, the supplier currently has existing agreements with many notable companies within the sports sector.</p>
<p>For example, a week ago, FSB penned a deal with Abelson Info, a London-based provider of data and odds. A month earlier, the provider also teamed up with Olympic Entertainment Group and its OlyBet brand, agreeing to provide the latter with casino gaming solutions.</p>
<p>Three days ago, meanwhile, FSB reinforced its core team, naming Marc Burroughes as its new director of account management.</p>
