<p>Dear sardapoor1963,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. Iâ€™m sorry to hear about your second negative experience with RoyalSpin Casino. Please allow me to ask you a few questions to make sure I understand your situation completely.</p>
<p>Have you accumulated your winnings with or without an active bonus?</p>
<p>When did you last communicate with customer support, and what was it about?</p>
<p>Regarding the repeated closing and opening of your account, it is essential to note that closing an account is simple and has almost no impact - the player can re-open the account anytime, and the casino has no obligation to the player. On the other hand, self-exclusion does. If a player successfully makes a self-exclusion the casino agrees not to open this account or if yes only under particular circumstances (after the cooling off period and this cannot be done for players who are addicted/with a gambling problem). So if you did not request to close your account due to a gambling addiction, the casino may re-open your account on demand.</p>
<p>I hope we will be able to help you resolve this issue as soon as possible. Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards</p>
<p>Veronika</p>
