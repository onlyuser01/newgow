<p>The accusations come amidst the fierce competition for a coveted downstate casino license in New York</p>
<p>Nassau County officials have leveled accusations against Hofstra University, alleging that the institution is colluding with a competitor to sabotage the Nassau Coliseum casino bid.</p>
<p>Nassau County Executive Reveals Troubling Evidence of Hofstra’s Role in Casino Project Controversy</p>
<p>Nassau County Executive, Bruce Blakeman, held a press conference on January 17, revealing that there is evidence suggesting Hofstra’s collaboration with Hard Rock International, a key player in the bid to establish a casino in the Citi Field parking lots.</p>
<p>Blakeman cited a Newsday column, highlighting an email from a consultant to Steve Cohen’s bid office, indicating potential communication with Hofstra.</p>
<p>Blakeman expressed his deep concern, stating that they found the situation very troubling and hypocritical. He went on to suggest that there might be collusion or coordination on the part of Hofstra with another entity against the Nassau Coliseum bid, thus exacerbating the already contentious conflict.</p>
<p>To reinforce their allegations, Nassau County issued subpoenas to Hofstra, demanding documents related to any communication with Hard Rock Seminole regarding the casino project. The subpoenas, served by the county sheriff’s office, underscore the seriousness of the allegations.</p>
<p>Hofstra President Summoned as Nassau Coliseum Bid Hangs in the Balance</p>
<p>Hofstra University President, Susan Poser, has been summoned to testify before the county Legislature on Monday. In a statement, the university mentioned that they would adhere to the law in responding to the subpoena, while also dismissing it as another attempt to divert attention and hinder a fair and open process concerning the transfer of Nassau County land.</p>
<p>The Nassau Coliseum bid, potentially facing demolition to make way for the casino, has been entangled in legal battles, with Hofstra filing a lawsuit last April to block the project. A judge sided with Hofstra, nullifying the 99-year lease agreement, leaving the casino bid in limbo. Nassau County has since appealed the decision.</p>
<p>Amidst the allegations, Hard Rock International swiftly denied any communication with Hofstra related to Nassau. Jonathan Goldman, a spokesperson for Hard Rock, emphasized the company’s commitment to “integrity, honesty, and transparency.”</p>
<p>The casino competition in New York has intensified, with developers vying for three $500 million downstate casino licenses. The Nassau and Queens bids are seen as strong contenders, benefitting from less congested locations compared to proposals targeting Manhattan.Last week S&amp;P Global Ratings warned operators of significant financial risks, citing potential licensing fees as high as $1 billion each. Major players like MGM Resorts International, Las Vegas Sands, and Wynn Resorts are vying for the licenses, with proposed projects ranging from $2 billion to over $5 billion. Despite the financial challenges, experts see a strategic long-term gain for victorious operators, although the timeline for developments may extend into 2025.</p>
