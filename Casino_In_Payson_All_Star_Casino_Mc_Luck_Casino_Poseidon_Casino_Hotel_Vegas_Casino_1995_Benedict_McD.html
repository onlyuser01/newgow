    <h1>Casino In Payson All Star Casino Mc Luck Casino Poseidon Casino Hotel Vegas Casino 1995 Benedict McD</h1>

<p>The fast-growing developer of games and content for the online gambling industry and NeoGames subsidiary, Wizard Games, strengthened its senior-level team by announcing a strategic appointment. On Wednesday, the iGaming content provider revealed it hired the seasoned online gambling industry veteran with nearly two decades of experience, Benedict McDonagh. Joining Wizard Games, he was appointed to the role of Managing Director.</p>
<p>The appointment comes at an important moment for Wizard Games. This is because the company plans to continue to grow on a global scale and significantly expand its presence. Ultimately, Wizard Games is after becoming a leading provider of content and technology for the iGaming vertical, a statement reveals.</p>
<p>In his new role as Managing Director, McDonagh joins the company's C-suite. He will collaborate with the senior-level management team that is led by Adrian Bailey, who holds the role of Managing Director at Pariplay. Leveraging his extensive experience, McDonagh is expected to supercharge Wizard Games' growth and expansion and help it overcome new challenges and boost its footprint exponentially.</p>
<p>Sharing his excitement, he said: "Wizard Games has ambitions to make a major splash in regulated markets around the world and I'm delighted to get the chance to be a part of that story." Finally, McDonagh noted: "I aim to use all of the know-how I have accumulated in my career to take the studio to the next level, so that we can make a real impact with operators and players globally."</p>
<p>Bailey, Pariplay's Managing Director, was excited to see McDonagh join Wizard Games' senior-level team. "Our studio division Wizard Games continues to make great strides in regulated markets all over the world and this progress is down to the quality of people we are able to bring into the business," he said. Finally, Bailey explained: "Benedict's vast industry experience will provide great benefits for Wizard Games and we believe he will be a superb addition to the team."</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Wizard Games strengthened its senior-level team by hiring the expert Yoganand Aiyadurai. Joining the company, he was appointed to the role of Director of Game Technology early in February. At the time of the announcement, Aiyadurai noted: "I'm thrilled to be joining Wizard Games as it continues to make huge leaps in the industry."</p>
<p>Before that, late last year, Wizard Games announced another strategic appointment. The company confirmed it hired Simon Jagdhar for the role of Director of Game Studio.</p>
