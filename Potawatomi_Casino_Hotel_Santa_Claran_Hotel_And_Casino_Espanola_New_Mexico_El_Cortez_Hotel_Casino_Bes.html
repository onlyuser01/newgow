<p>Scientific Games signed an official deal with the leading game developers Big Time Gaming which allows the company to exclusively distribute BTG content in North America and other available jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Big Time Gaming’s Megaways and Megaquads Games Arrive on OpenGaming</p>
<p>On October 20, 2020 a deal between Scientific Games (SG) and Big Time Gaming (BTG) was struck, boosting BTG’s exposure and offering SG an opportunity to offer a unique product to gaming audiences and business clients. SG has already been able to secure similar deals with other industry leading companies, including NetEnt.</p>
<p>This contract marks the beginning of what both companies hope to be a lucrative partnership. Moving forth, SG has the exclusive right to distribute all of BTG existing and new content all across the globe. SG will roll BTG games in all of its markets, including the US, Canada as well as the UK and Europe.</p>
<p>BTG is known as one of the most innovative slot developers within the iGaming industry. With this new deal secured, the two companies expect to build on their partnership and continue providing reliable and feature-rich player engagement solutions to all their customers.</p>
<p>SG’s goal is to build additional market share across North America, the UK and Europe as the company has rights to distribute the widest range of content developed by BTG.</p>
<p>Megaways and Megaquads to Debut on OpenGaming</p>
<p>Amongst the games that will now appear on the OpenGaming aggregation platform are titles in the MEGAWAYS and MEGAQUADS slot series. The first is widely known already and the latter is a new project which is expected to bring casino gameplay to a new level.</p>
<p>BTG CEO Nik Robinson was excited to secure this partnership with Scientific Games. According to him, more players than even before will be able to access BTG’s content thanks to SG’s worldwide distribution abilities.</p>
<p>“Scientific Games are an important partner to us, and we had no hesitation in securing a significant deal that builds on the technology, distribution, and product capabilities across their ecosystem.” -BTG CEO Nik Robinson</p>
<p>Dylan Slaney, SG SVP Gaming, said he is glad to be able to work with BTG and highlighted the importance of the deal. Slaney hopes to strengthen the company’s OpenGaming offering significantly as BTG’s content is without a doubt amongst the most sought after in the iGaming industry, both from the standpoint of a business and consumer.</p>
<p>The goal Scientific Games has set for itself is to build the world’s most powerful aggregation platform with leading customers and game developers in all major regulated markets.</p>
<p>The partnership is expected to open a new chapter in OpenGaming’s development and allow Scientific Games to achieve its ultimate goal that is building the world’s leading iGaming aggregation content platform.</p>
<p>SG previously struck a partnership with BetMGM last week, expanding the company’s offer with a select variety of products available on the OpenGaming platform.</p>
