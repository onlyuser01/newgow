<p>The University of Cincinnati baseball program has been cleared of involvement in a sports betting scandal that led to the removal of two staff members</p>
<p>The University of Cincinnati’s baseball program has been exonerated from any involvement in a sports betting scandal that rocked the collegiate baseball community earlier this year.</p>
<p>UC Baseball Staff Cleared in Betting Scandal Probe</p>
<p>The investigation, initiated in May, focused on two secondary/Level III violations connected to sports wagering. Former assistant coach Kyle Sprague and director of operations Andy Nagel were relieved of their duties on May 17 due to their interactions with an individual later identified as Bert Neff of Mooresville, Indiana.</p>
<p>Neff, whose son was a member of the University of Cincinnati’s baseball team but left before the 2023 season, had placed suspicious bets on an Alabama-LSU baseball game at the BetMGM Sportsbook in Cincinnati. These bets, made in coordination with Alabama’s former coach Brad Bohannon, led to Bohannon’s subsequent firing and multiple states banning betting on Crimson Tide games.</p>
<p>Although Sprague and Nagel were found to have been in contact with Neff, the investigation cleared the University of Cincinnati baseball program of any wrongdoing. the University of Cincinnati’s statement emphasized that no evidence was found indicating that current or former student-athletes, coaches, or staff members had wagered on Cincinnati baseball or college baseball in general.</p>
<p>New Coach Takes the Helm Amidst Scandal Aftermath</p>
<p>The scandal had wide-reaching consequences for the University of Cincinnati’s baseball staff. Following the revelation of the violations, head coach Scott Googins chose to step down in June after a 24-33 record in the 2023 season. The university swiftly moved to fill the vacancy, hiring Jordan Bischel from Central Michigan as the new head coach. Bischel, who signed a six-year contract, expressed his commitment to leading the Bearcats into the Big 12 conference.</p>
<p>The university’s internal investigation was prompted by the suspicious betting activity surrounding the Alabama-LSU game and Neff’s involvement. Despite the challenges faced by the University of Cincinnati baseball program in recent months, the university and its newly appointed coaching staff are now focused on the upcoming season, eager to put this chapter behind them and focus on the game they love.</p>
<p>US college sports have been rocked by scandal after scandal in recent months. In July, NCAA President Charlie Baker disclosed 175 infractions related to sports-betting policies since 2018, with 17 ongoing investigations into potential violations. The investigations, flagged by a monitoring company, covered various incidents from minor bets to providing insider information. While specific cases remain confidential, notable incidents involving Alabama’s baseball coach and 41 athletes from Iowa universities have surfaced.</p>
