    <h1>Aria Hotel And Casino Casinos In Virginia Slot Machine Free Slots Casino San Diego Casino Winners In</h1>

<p>As a result, the company is now looking to launch its fully-fledged iGaming and betting platform in the city and state and bring its quality products to local audiences. Brazil is in the process of regulating its gambling market, and it has seen itself in no shortage of industry suitors.</p>
<p>Pixbet Ready to Fire from All Cylinders in Brazil</p>
<p>Pixbet will move forward with a launch that will see WeAreGame’s iGaming platform arrive in the country under the brand’s name. Specifically, Pixbet has received a First Stage Accreditation that is expected to be reaffirmed by regulators and allow the company to offer sports betting products. WeAreGame similarly welcomed this partnership and opportunity:</p>
<p>WeAreGame is proud to be the platform provider of Pixbet and we wish everyone at Pixbet the best of luck in further solidifying their position as a go-to brand for sports betting in Brazil. WeAreGame spokesperson</p>
<p>Pixbet is a prominent local name in the Latin American iGaming and sports gambling industries, as it already has ties with more than 15 sports clubs across Brazil alone. The company has touted itself as a brand developed by Brazilians for Brazilians and has reiterated many times over that it is looking to make a big impact on the local gambling ecosystem in the country.</p>
<p>Bringing a Number of Regulated Sports Betting Markets</p>
<p>The company’s decision comes at a time when sports gambling in Brazil is officially legal, but still in the process of having final details ironed out before it can become fully regulated. Meanwhile, Pixbet Sportsbook will commence with a product portfolio that features ten sports, including soccer.</p>
<p>WeAreGame is a proven and tested product as well and Pixbet expects to have a very smooth launch in Rio de Janeiro. Already, WeAreGame is helping a number of the brand’s products, including PixBet.tv, PixJogos, a free-to-play site designed to gamify audiences, and PixBet Fantasy 5, a fantasy soccer game run by the company.</p>
<p>The license was issued by Loterj, the Permanent Bidding Committee of the Lottery of the State of Rio de Janeiro, which is tasked with the issuance of licenses. Pixbet is not the first entity to have been licensed, however, with Loto Carioca getting the go-ahead by Loterj earlier this month.</p>
