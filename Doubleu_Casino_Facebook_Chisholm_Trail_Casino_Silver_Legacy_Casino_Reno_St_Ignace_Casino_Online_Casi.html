<p>Leading sports betting company 1XBet has inked an agreement with Lille Olympique Sporting Club, a professional French soccer club. The agreement will see 1XBet serve as the club’s official sports betting partner in Africa.</p>
<p>1XBet Joins Forces with the Famed French Club</p>
<p>The three-year partnership expands the operator’s presence in Africa. It will see 1XBet and LOSC Lille team up for various activations. In addition, the sports betting company will receive the rights to distribute LOSC Lille imagery, including the club’s logo and photos of its players. This will help 1XBet launch various promotional campaigns featuring the soccer team.</p>
<p>This deal, furthermore, consolidates 1XBet’s presence in professional French soccer. The betting operator has an existing agreement with Paris Saint-Germain FC, one of the most famous French teams. Right now, 1XBet serves as PSG’s partner for Asia and Africa but plans to extend this partnership starting the next season.</p>
<p>It is possible that the operator may also extend its agreement with LOSC Lille if their partnership proves to be fruitful.</p>
<p>1XBet Promises to Share More Good News by the End of 2023</p>
<p>1XBet’s director of affiliate marketing, Alex Sommers spoke about the new agreement with the soccer team and said that the new partnership is “great news” overall. He said that his team is “very pleased” by the opportunity to work with a club as “legendary” as LOSC Lille. Sommers praised the club for having a worldwide fanbase, as well as for its recent victories.</p>
<p>Most recently, in 2021, the club [LOSC Lille] became the champions of France, which is not easy because we all know what level of opponents contest this tournament. We want to offer Les Dogues fans the opportunity to get the most vivid emotions and a new online betting experience. Alex Sommers, director of affiliate marketing, 1XBet</p>
<p>Sommers added that 1XBet sees the new agreement as an important step in its global strategy to support professional soccer. He concluded that the company expects a lot of cooperation and promised sports fans that this will not be the last time that 1XBet brings good news this year.</p>
<p>Speaking about good news, in May, the renowned operator inked a key partnership with OG, one of the biggest and most influential esports organizations in the world. 1XBet helped OG produce premium new promo content and engage its fans with exciting esports betting opportunities.</p>
<p>Through its deals, 1XBet demonstrates that it cares for both traditional sports and esports and wants to appeal to all kinds of bettors. It is exciting to hear what new “good news” the operator has in store for this year.</p>
