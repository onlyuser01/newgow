<p>Mark your calendars, because BetMGM is set to break ground in the New York online betting market on Monday, January 17. This makes a fifth company that is joining the Empire State and launching its dedicated betting platform a little over a week after the industry received an official go-ahead.</p>
<p>BetMGM Set to Roll Out Along with Various Perks</p>
<p>BetMGM is in a great position to derive benefits from this partnership as it’s already an authorized sports betting partner for a number of franchises and sports landmarks. BetMGM is teaming up with the Madison Square Garden Arena and by extension the Knicks and the Rangers.</p>
<p>Not only that, but sports bettors will be able to benefit from the MGM Resorts M Life Rewards loyalty program which will be redeemable at MGM Resorts properties. This will create a perfect range of synergies between the hospitality and sports betting experiences which has long been BetMGM’s ultimate goal.</p>
<p>There are a number of properties in and around New York that make a lot of sense for sports bettors to visit. These include the MGM National Harbor in Maryland, the Borgata in New Jersey, and the Empire City Casino in Yonkers. Then again, there is the Bellagio and MGM Grand in Las Vegas for those that feel like going to Nevada.</p>
<p>Commenting on this announcement, BetMGM CEO Adam Greenblatt had nothing but praise for the upcoming move. The chief executive argued that the betting platform will be able to fully activate its synergies with the MSG and Empire City Casino, and added:</p>
<p>“A huge thank you to the New York Gaming Commission as well as to our entire BetMGM team who have worked tirelessly to bring this to fruition.” BetMGM CEO Adam Greenblatt</p>
<p>Sports fans will be able to collect various rewards and VIP experiences on-site at the Madison Square Garden Arena during the Knicks and the Rangers’ games and special events. All of this will create a more fulfilling experience that will be shared by sports fans and bettors.</p>
<p>BetMGM Readying Up for Full Synergies</p>
<p>With four operators launching on Saturday, January 8, BetMGM is keen to enter the space as well. BetMGM made a promise in 2020 that it will be one of the top three sports betting companies in the United States. Former Entain CEO Shay Segev even argued that BetMGM could easily top the American sports betting ecosystem.</p>
<p>New York has already proved a fertile ground for marketers as well as sports betting operators. With nine approved betting brands, there is no shortage of affiliates looking to offer their services in what is expected to be one of the top three biggest states in terms of sports betting volume. The Game Day and BestOdds were among the first to act, but so are others such as Catena and Better Collective.</p>
