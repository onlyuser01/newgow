<p>Sportsbooks in the US are tying up as many alliances with sports franchises and leagues as they can muster. The latest comes from Tipico, one of the leading betting agencies which have set foot in the country and is rapidly expanding, now through a partnership with MLS squad the Colorado Rapids.</p>
<p>Tipico Turns Colorado in Its Home State</p>
<p>Tipico has been tapped as the team’s official presenting sponsor during the Audi 2021 MLS Cup Playoffs. The news was immediately welcomed by Colorado Rapids executive VP &amp; general manager Pádraig Smith who said the team was delighted to be adding Tipico Sportsbook to its list of sponsors and supporters.</p>
<p>“We look forward to having Tipico onboard to help us elevate our fans’ experience during what we hope will be a very special playoff stretch.” Colorado Rapids executive VP &amp; general manager Pádraig Smith</p>
<p>Tipico has been investing heavily in Colorado. The organization opened a dedicated development center in the state that will support over 440 jobs. The move coincides with the sportsbook’s ambition to launch well across the United States and establish a footprint in every state.</p>
<p>This is the sentiment reflected in Tipico Sportsbook US CEO Adrian Vella’s words, commenting on the new partnership:</p>
<p>“With the opening of our new technology hub in Denver and the recent launch of our online sportsbook in the state, Colorado is starting to feel like home to the Tipico team.” Tipico Sportsbook US CEO Adrian Vella</p>
<p>Tipico will be the official partner for the pre-game Friendsgiving Tailgate initiative, which will be held at Western Conference Semifinal this Thursday against the Portland Timbers FC.</p>
<p>Engaging with Fans and Those in Need</p>
<p>The alliance will feature numerous additional activations, including ticket giveaways, seat upgrades, and an all-inclusive Tipico Terrace Club Box during playoff games featuring the Rapids.</p>
<p>Tipico is also adding 32,000 meals for the charity initiative hosted by the Rapids and Kroenke Sports Charities. The Thanksgiving Day Meal Program will be able to donate more than half a million meals this Thanksgiving.</p>
<p>Tipico is moving rapidly across the US, with the company launching iGaming operations in New Jersey earlier this month on top of an existing sportsbook platform. The company also secured market access deals in Iowa and Indiana in September, as Tipico continues to pivot towards regulated betting and gaming states.</p>
