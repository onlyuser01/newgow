    <h1>Ala Casino Betmgm Online Casino Casino Washington Dc Casinos Near Joplin Mo Seneca Niagara Casino Bu</h1>

<p>Hello everybody!</p>
<p>As some of you may have noticed, I'm in the process of excluding myself from all casinos! Apart from the fact that all casinos in which I am registered operate illegally on the Austrian market, my big problem is my gaming behavior! I believe that the majority of users who read the "Responsible Gaming" forum can understand very well what I mean by that!</p>
<p>I've already filed a few complaints here! I've had a lot of help here! But sometimes I have the feeling that the platform is not really conveying neutrally! I have a few questions and some of you may be able to give me valuable and useful tips based on your experience:</p>
<p>1.) Cura√ßao supervisory authority: there are countless emails circulating on the internet to which complaints can be addressed! I didn't get a reply from any of them! Either the email addresses are no longer up to date or the supervisory authority is just as corrupt as many of the casinos licensed in Curacao! I have asked Casinoguru several times to provide a valid email address! Was ignored every time! The platform thereby prevents complaints in Curacao! Does anyone have a valid email address or tips?</p>
<p>2.) no license in Austria: does anyone know what happens if I report a casino for illegal gambling in Austria! Will the authorities investigate? Is the casino held legally responsible by the authorities?</p>
<p>3.) I get 2-3 messages a day from casinos spamming me with ads! Blocking doesn't work! Unfortunately it is not possible to change your email address! Due to the European data protection regulation, the casino is liable to prosecution here, and penalties for misuse of the data result in very high fines! Anyone know where I can file a complaint here?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for the tips and help</p>
