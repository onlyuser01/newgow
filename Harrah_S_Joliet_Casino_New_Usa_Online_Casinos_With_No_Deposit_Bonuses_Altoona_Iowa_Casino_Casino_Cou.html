<p>JefeBet, the leading sports betting and media company focusing on bilingual coverage and products, and catering to Spanish speakers in America, has launched the JefeBet Podcast Network. This new initiative will allow the company to leverage its pool of network hosts, content creators and correspondents who will deliver on a number of pre-recorded content and material designed to engage even further with sports betting fans in the United States.</p>
<p>Jefebet is keen to celebrate Hispanic and Latino Heritage Month and to this end, the company is bringing a number of popular personalities, including Ozzie Guillén, Francisco Rivera, Majo Montemayor, Alex Stergios, and others who will appear on the JefeBet Podcast Network. All shows will be produced in Spanish and will focus on delivering insight into sports betting and fantasy sports trends, educate consumers and sports fans on general gambling trends, and outright celebrate Latino culture, entertainment, and lifestyle.</p>
<p>FSG Digital, the company which owns JefeBet, welcomed the opportunity that this new release offered. According to VP of Content Matthew Chambers, there was an exciting lineup being brought in for JefeBet Podcast Network, and that was truly exceptional. Chambers further noted:</p>
<p>"With their collective reach of over four million engaged followers across social channels, and paired with JefeBet’s own fast-growing digital footprint, we’re building the best and most influential network of Spanish-first content for the 64 million Hispanic and Latinos in the US and millions abroad."</p>
<p>Guillén is himself an ambassador for JefeBet and he was stoked to have the opportunity to be part of the launch of this new product. He said that JefeBet makes it possible to create a bridge between the various segments of sports, media, and entertainment. The majority of sports betting companies has been doing the exact same thing, but few have had the boldness to target Spanish-speakers and cater to what FSG has long identified as an underserved market.</p>
<p>There are many shows already lined up for people to enjoy. Those include the El Reporte Jefe, Titularescon Ale, El Munde de Guillén, and so many others. One of those will also be the Fútbol Premier, which will bring various updates about football around the world, including Premier League, Champions League, and not least, missives from the World Cup.</p>
<p>Jefebet has been fast-expanding in the North American market, covering Spanish speakers exclusively in a bold move that may have appeared a little risky, but succeeded owing not just to Jefebet’s first-mover advantage, but also to the company’s overall strong execution.</p>
