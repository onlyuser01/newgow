<p>The famous English football club based in Burnley, Lancashire, UK, Burnley Football Club, announced it renewed its agreement with BK8, the leading provider of casino gaming and sports betting entertainment. Announced Friday, the renewed collaboration keeps BK8 as the team's Official Training Wear partner.</p>
<p>Thanks to the new agreement, BK8 will benefit from increased brand exposure via Burnley FC's men's and women's training wear. Additionally, the betting and gaming company will benefit from branding via the team's digital channels and LED signage at Turf Moor.</p>
<p>According to a statement released by Burnley FC, the new collaboration was facilitated via Outlast Sports &amp; Entertainment, a leading provider of solutions that help operators and brands complete different campaigns.

Finally, he pointed out: "We are fully committed to fostering a strong, collaborative relationship and expanding this exceptional collaboration with the club and the brand."</p>
<p>The latest agreement builds upon an initial collaboration announced by the duo. Back in August, Burnley FC initially selected BK8 as its Official Training Wear partner.

Now, thanks to the renewed agreement, BK8 will continue to support different charity activities throughout the season.</p>
<p>Michael Gatt, BK8's EMEA Managing Director, was excited about the renewed collaboration.
