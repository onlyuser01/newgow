<p>As a member of the Association, ZEAL reaffirmed its support for the standards for responsible gambling and social responsibility set by the WLA</p>
<p>The leading online lottery company in Germany, ZEAL, has announced it has become the latest member of the World Lottery Association (WLA). Thanks to the new addition, the Association expands further its portfolio of members. Since it was founded in 1999, following the merger of the International Association of Lotteries and Lotto Organizations, the International Association of State Lotteries and Intertoto, to date, the Association has members from six different continents and 80 countries.</p>
<p>Helmut Becker, ZEAL’s CEO, shared his excitement saying that the company is delighted to become the newest member of the World Lottery Association. Admitting that the company holds a leadership position within the online lottery market in Germany, the CEO reaffirmed ZEAL’s commitment to security, as well as risk management and compliance.</p>
<p>“We are proud the WLA has accepted us as a member. As the German market leader for online lotteries, we take our responsibility in the areas of compliance, security and risk management very seriously and attach great importance to social commitments as well.“ Helmut Becker, CEO of ZEAL</p>
<p>Becker explained that compliance with the rules, social responsibility and commitments represent significantly important goals for ZEAL. Finally, ZEAL’s CEO said: “We are pleased to be a part of this important organization with immediate effect and to support the high standards of the WLA and its members.”</p>
<p>The Association Continues to Expand List of Members</p>
<p>Becoming a member of the WLA means that ZEAL commits to the Association’s established standards for responsible gaming and social responsibility. Additionally, as a WLA member, the company commits to risk management and other strategic priorities set by the WLA.</p>
<p>Recently, the WLA expanded further its list of partners by adding the leading geolocation and fraud prevention company, GeoComply. The membership, which was announced in February, marked an important milestone not only for the Association but for the geolocation and fraud prevention leader.</p>
<p>Expanding its membership list and involving stakeholders from the industry undoubtedly helps the WLA. What’s more, members of the Association help raise funds for different charitable causes. In fact, back in 2021, WLA members around the world helped deliver some $80 billion to charitable causes.</p>
