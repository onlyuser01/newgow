    <h1>Candyland Casino No Deposit Bonus Codes 2023 Big Dollar Casino Bonus Codes Casino Bus Near Me Caesar</h1>

<p>Hi Mam/Sir.</p>
<p>i will try to explain my issue/problem with videoslots short. even its start getting a very very very long story..</p>
<p>It all start in end oct 2021.. I received an email from Videoslots that i should verify a Visa-card there was attached to my account. i explain them that this visa card was my friends we have use twice because my own was broke and i was waiting my new to arrive ( his visa card was use month before and only i think it was 2 or 3 time)</p>
<p>videoslots inform me, that this was not allowed and i need to send them a letter of Consent fill out by my friend, picture of his visa card and copy of his id... ( to be honest i was not really aware of that, so i ofcause apologize and promis that this ofcause not will happend again...</p>
<p>all document was send to videoslots and all approved. my account was now open again.</p>
<p>i then start playing again with my new visa card which i use for all my deposit. in the end of november I win ( around 7,7K USD)..now videoslots again blocked my account, and want me to verify my account..</p>
<p>2 december i send them all my document, (at that time i still have my 7700USD at my account). i did not here anything, and 4 of dec i send even more document, and follow up on some stautus about my account..</p>
<p>same day 4 of december i receive the 1st email where videoslots thanks me for going through safety check and inform me that my visa card is now vertify and approved</p>
<p>2nd email i receive same afternoon 4 of dec. where videoslots again thanks me for going through safety check of my identity and now they are very happy to inform me that my identity is now verify and approved.</p>
<p>3rd email i receive same afternoon 4 of dec. where videoslots is very very happy again to inform me that my new visacard was approved as my withdraw methoid and all other visa card was remove from my account..</p>
<p>4rd email i receive same afternoon 4 of dec where videoslot inform me that all my document is now approved and my account is open again and ready to use..</p>
<p>(all email from videoslots i have saved)</p>
<p>now things going like that, that i playing for my 7.7USD and i am winning more so my balance is now more that 20K+USD. 9 of dec i make a withdraw of 10KUSD to my already approved visa card (This visa card they already approved 4 of dec)</p>
<p>i am now waiting 5+6 days for receiving the amount in my bank account.. i do not receive it and make follow up 14 of dec.</p>
<p>15 of dec i receive an email from videoslots that my withdraw is cancle/rejected.. (there is no explaination in the email WHY!!)</p>
<p>i therefor chatting with live chat to ask what is going on and she telling me that my account is now blocked and i need to verify my account.. i explain that i already have done all this less that 10 days ago.. anyway i send all the same document which they already had approved less that 10 days ago,,</p>
<p>now i dont here anything at all from videoslots.. i make 100 of follow up through december month and only answer i get, is to wait, there is no update.. this is how it goes throught dec and start of jan 2022.</p>
<p>surepricely 8 of jan 2022 i receive and email from videoslots where the say that they have made a manual withdraw of my money 20777,16 USD to my vis card account..( now the money is remove from vi videoslots account which i still have access to but can not play)my account just stating that i have to contact support service..</p>
<p>after have waiting 5+6 days again i follow up again where my money is since i still did not receive them in my bank account..</p>
<p>they only answer i get is that they are looking for my money and nobody can tell me anything.. only that i have to wait!!!. i make 100 of follow up by live chat and through email to support hole jan.. ALL with same replay that they still do not have any update and i have to wait!!!!</p>
<p>then (i think 4-5 of february i open my videoslots account again to make another follow up on live chat, and i now see that the full amount 20,777,16 USD again is in my videslots account... hmmm..</p>
<p>i then sending them an email what is going on and i got replay that videoslot have rejected my withdraw 3 of FEB!!!!! it took them 4 weeks to tell me that they have rejected this withdraw that they did manual 8 of jan..!!!!! and now!! here we go again!!!</p>
<p>in the same email where this guy (Kasper) tell me that they have rejected my withdraw 3 of feb.. he also tell me to make another withdraw again.. ( i am now asking him why he think videoslots will approve this withdraw when they just have rejected this withdraw they have made by them self...) and specially when my account is still blocked ( saying that i have to contact support)</p>
<p>now everything start again!! nobody can tell me anything and they only answer i get is. JUST WAIT FOR AN UPDATE...!! my problem is nobody telling me what is wrong and there is never any update.... i am not new in this gameing and i know what they doing!! my problem is i do not now what to do now...</p>
<p>we talking 20,777,16USD!!!!!</p>
<p>Hope you can give me some advise</p>
