<p>The year-on-year and month-on-month decreases failed to be offset by the slight increase in handle</p>
<p>The Rhode Island Lottery published information about the performance of the state’s sports betting industry in November. As it turns out, November wasn’t sportsbooks’ best month despite a slight month-on-month increase in bets.</p>
<p>According to the report, Rhode Island’s sportsbooks earned a total of $3.31 million in November. Unfortunately, this figure represents both year-on-year and month-on-month decreases that failed to be offset by the slight increase in handle.</p>
<p>For reference, the total handle recorded by the state’s three sportsbooks for the period was $48.3 million. This figure represents a 21% decrease year-on-year and a 5% increase compared to October 2023. However, the November revenue is still 25% lower than the revenue recorded in October, as well as almost 30% lower than the revenue recorded in November 2022.</p>
<p>Online Revenue Remained Much Higher</p>
<p>Rhode Island has two retail sportsbooks operated by Bally’s and a single online sportsbook operated by Caesars. In November, Bally’s Twin River Lincoln sportsbook, for example, recorded revenue of $488,920. The company’s Tiverton sportsbook, on the other hand, reported revenue of $348,253. The two locations accepted a total of $9.64 million in bets.</p>
<p>The retail sportsbooks were outclassed by the performance of Caesars’ online sportsbook. Reflecting the overall trends in America, the online book dominated Rhode Island and was singlehandedly responsible for $38.64 million of the total sports betting handle in the state. As a result, Caesars’ online sportsbook finished the month with a revenue of $2,576,027.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the fiscal year in July, Rhode Island’s sportsbooks have reported revenue of $14.69 million. This year-to-date result represents a dramatic decrease from the previous fiscal year.</p>
<p>However, the state’s sports betting industry was not the only one falling behind as casino gaming also performed suboptimally. Revenue from VLTs, for example, decreased by 1.5% YOY to $40.7 million, while table game revenue decreased by 5.5% YOY to $10.8 million.</p>
<p>The Rhode Island Lottery reflected the overall trend as sales dropped by almost 15% month-on-month to $23.5 million in November.</p>
