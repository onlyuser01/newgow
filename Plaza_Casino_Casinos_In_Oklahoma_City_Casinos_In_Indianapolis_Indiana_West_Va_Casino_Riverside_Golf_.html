    <h1>Plaza Casino Casinos In Oklahoma City Casinos In Indianapolis Indiana West Va Casino Riverside Golf</h1>

<p>I'm just going to put a random dollar amount in that section if it won't take my request without it however it will be incorrectand not applicable it's not a specific amount of dollars it's points I'm disputing. They won't give me my points for the missions I've already completed. I've contacted them multiple times over almost 2 weeks now and they keep giving me the runaround. They started acting shady when I started winning more. They keep trying to tell me it's in Beta so be patient but every other one of my friend's account updates no problems of course they don't have as much points as I do but it's wrong of them to not give me my points when I've earned them fair and square. I can but free chips and spins with my points. These are the missions I've already accomplished and have not been given credit for. Regardless of whether it's in "beta" which I doubt even that still as it's been awhile now, they could still go in and update my points. They used to be my favorite casino to play at too and I used to say the most trustworthy. That is until I started winning more.</p>
<p>Put Faith In It</p>
<p>Turn Around</p>
<p>10 out of 10</p>
<p>Feast On</p>
<p>Yo Ho Ho</p>
<p>I originally emailed them on April 1st about it I just checked the date on the email then subsequent emails followed of which I'll include a couple with the response I got, regarding Now I don't know about anybody else but I'm pretty sure that if they can advance, update my friends accounts when they've accomplished missions they can do mine is my way of thinking. By friends I'm referring to three different friends who all play at Yabby too and they've had no problems. I just don't think it's right or fair. A player shouldn't be penalized and singled out to not get earned points because they've won too much which is what the trend seems to be with them.</p>
