    <h1>Biggest Casino In America Tulalip Resort And Casino Casinos In Ny Mgm Grand Detroit Casino Casablanc</h1>

<p>Casino and gaming company, Luckia Gaming Group, not only managed to deal with the crisis in 2021 despite the Covid 19 pandemic, but it also fully recovered in the last quarter of 2021, matching similar sales volume figures from 2019. In 2022, the company is working even harder in order to maintain this upward momentum.</p>
<p>Positive EBITDA despite Restrictions</p>
<p>According to the last performance report released by Luckia, they managed to close the year 2020 with positive EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) amounting to €11 million ($11.95 million). Its turnover dropped by around 25%, from €583.6 million ($633.74 million) to €434 million ($471.29 million) due to the forced closures of its activities to help contain Covid-19.</p>
<p>José González Fuentes, president of Luckia, commented that the main reason behind its positive EBITDA during the difficult pandemic year was attributed to the implementation of strict expenditure and adjustment measures, as well as the positive performance of its online channel and the strength of the face-to-face business.</p>
<p>He added that whenever the companies were allowed to work, Luckia operated in a secure and effective manner adhering to all the tough limitations that had been imposed across the business.</p>
<p>Although they had a rocky start to 2021, Fuentes highlighted that the gaming company’s activity recovered rapidly in the latter half of 2021 as soon as all the restrictions were lifted. It was not long until the figures from their finance reports matched that of their pre-pandemic levels.</p>
<p>Increased Usage of Digital Channels</p>
<p>The president of Luckia reported that the Covid-19 crisis lead to the increased usage of digital channels by the players. Fuentes stated that they have an optimistic outlook for 2022 because of the social and tourism reactivation. Luckia’s team expects revenue to grow rapidly in the coming months.</p>
<p>In February 2022, Spanish multinational gambling companies Luckia, Codere and Sportium announced the foundation of the Association of Gambling Licensees of Castilla and León (ALACA). This was established in order to continue their regional administration collaborations with regard to the sustainable and responsible development of private gaming operations. Luis Miguel Cabeza de Vaca, director of institutional relations of Codere España, was appointed president of ALACA.</p>
<p>Prior to that, in November 2021, another gaming company named Luckia and Comar established the Galician Gambling Business Association (Asejuga).</p>
