    <h1>Mrgreen Casino Warhorse Casino Omaha Wild Casino Online South Point Casino Movies Colusa Casino Plan</h1>

<p>Savage’s infectious personality is just what Planet Sport Bet was looking for in an ambassador</p>
<p>Planet Sport Bet, a Planet Sport-owned sportsbook, has signed a partnership with former soccer professional and sports pundit Robbie Savage. The latter has been selected as the sports betting operator’s brand ambassador.</p>
<p>As a brand ambassador of Planet Sport Bet, Savage will participate in a variety of activations. He will also provide regular content throughout the new soccer season, sharing his thoughts on the latest developments in the sport.</p>
<p>In addition, Savage will promote Planet Sport Bet’s brand and will participate in various advertising and promotional campaigns.</p>
<p>A seasoned sports connoisseur, Savage will support the brand with his knowledge and fame. As a former soccer player with over 500 appearances, the pundit has an intimate understanding of soccer. Throughout his career, Savage has played for a number of high-profile teams, such as Leicester City, Derby Country and Birmingham City. He boasts 39 caps for Wales and currently serves as director of football at Macclesfield FC.</p>
<p>Planet Sport Bet, on the other hand, was launched in 2021 and is a part of Planet Sport’s betting &amp; gaming division.</p>
<p>Robbie Savage Has the All the Qualities Planet Sport Was Looking For</p>
<p>Robbie Savage commented on his new position, saying that he is looking forward to working with Planet Sport Bet. He said that the brand shouldn’t be underestimated despite being fairly new. He added that he trusts the brand since it is coming from the same team behind Football365 and TEAMtalk.</p>
<p>Planet Sport is a business going places and I’m delighted to being part of the team for the new football season. Robbie Savage, brand ambassador, Planet Sport Bet</p>
<p>Savage added that the upcoming campaign is going to be “a real cracker with many subplots along the way.” He promised to provide honest reviews of the events and share his opinions on betting odds and predictions.</p>
<p>Mike Grenham, Planet Sport’s managing director of betting, welcomed Savage to the Planet Sport family. The MD praised the new brand ambassador for always providing an honest, insightful and hard-hitting view of the latest developments in soccer. Because of his profound understanding of the sport at all levels, Savage is certain to appeal to Planet Sport Bet customers, Grenham believes.</p>
<p>The MD concluded that Savage’s infectious personality is just what Planet Sport Bet was looking for in an ambassador. Grenham added: “Though Robbie likes a laugh, he also understands the need to work in a responsible way when gambling is involved; that’s something very important to us too.”</p>
