<p>The woman died at the accident scene, according to the California Highway Patrol (CHP). On Thursday, Fresno County Coroner’s Office released her name. It is Khayriyyah Jones, the Fresno Bee reported.</p>
<p>The driver was not identified by CHP. He suffered serious injuries, police revealed. He was transported to a local hospital. Police did not have details on his condition as of mid-day Thursday.</p>
<p>Police believe the driver lost control of the vehicle while traveling south on the highway. It went down an embankment and overturned, CHP said. No other vehicles were involved in the crash, the report adds. The accident took place at about 8:30 pm. Officers continued to investigate the circumstances surrounding the crash on Thursday, CHP said.</p>
<p>The casino is located in Coarsegold, Calif. It is about 36 miles north of Fresno. The gaming venue is near Yosemite National Park.</p>
<p>Las Vegas Strip Fatal Crash</p>
<p>In an unrelated fatal accident, a 43-year-old woman died from her injuries in November 2020. That’s after the SUV she was in crashed into a wall at the Paris Hotel &amp; Casino parking garage located on the Las Vegas Strip.</p>
<p>Local TV station KLAS reported that Veronica Acosta was a passenger in the 2019 Chevrolet Trailblazer when the accident took place. Acosta resided in Riverside, Calif.</p>
<p>In total, three passengers in the SUV required treatment at Sunrise Hospital for injuries from the crash. Physicians tried to save Acosta, but she died later from “blunt force injury to the chest” suffered in the collision, KLAS said, based on a report from the Clark County Coroner’s Office.</p>
<p>Las Vegas Metropolitan Police later arrested the driver of the SUV for driving under the influence, KLAS said. He was identified as Scott Thomas, age 39, of Montclair, Calif., KTNV, another Las Vegas TV station, reported.</p>
<p>Motorcycle Fatal Crash</p>
<p>In another deadly accident, the victim of an Aug. 5 2021 Las Vegas motorcycle crash has died. The accident was at the Strat Hotel, Casino, and Skypod on Las Vegas Boulevard.</p>
<p>The motorcycle was heading south on Las Vegas Boulevard. When it got north of Bob Stupak Avenue, it collided with a Nissan Altima near the entrance to the casino’s valet area.</p>
