<p>Jho Low, now believed to be hiding in China, liked to shower celebrities with gifts and invite them to lavish parties</p>
<p>Several years ago, Kim Kardashian and Leonardo DiCaprio were interrogated by the FBI about their ties with Low Taek Jho “Jho Low,” a wanted fugitive. Low had a thing for celebrities and spent tons of embezzled money on expensive parties with famous stars and sponsored some of their gambling sessions.</p>
<p>Who Is Jho Low and What Is His Connection to DiCaprio?</p>
<p>As reported by Bloomberg, Jho Low fancied himself the “Mozart of the business world” and liked to party with stars and present them with lavish gifts. DiCaprio described him as a friend, which is not surprising at all considering that Low showered him with adoration and even financed his The Wolf of Wall Street movie.</p>
<p>Low claimed that his wealth comes from a generous patron based in Abu Dhabi. However, the truth was different as the billionaire was eventually found guilty of embezzling ludicrous amounts of money from the 1Malaysia Development Berhard government fund. Low eventually became a fugitive and is now believed to be hiding in China.</p>
<p>The 1MDB fund was founded by the former Malaysian PM Najib Razak, although many believe that it may have been Low’s idea. Razak was an accomplice for sure as he channeled a whopping $700 million toward his bank account, which eventually earned him 12 years in prison</p>
<p>When the FBI grilled DiCaprio, the famous actor suddenly found himself unable to remember many of the details surrounding his relationship with Low. He could not remember details about one of his former friend’s companies, nor the findings of the background check conducted by his managers when Low sponsored The Wolf of Wall Street.</p>
<p>Low Was Fond of Kim Kardashian</p>
<p>FBI documents reveal that Kardashian told the federals that she partied with Low on six occasions. The two of them first met in 2009 when the businessman paid the celebrity $50,000 to appear at his birthday in a Vegas nightclub.</p>
<p>He also gave her $250,000 to buy Kardashian a new white Ferrari as a wedding president for her marriage to Kris Humphries. Humphries, on the other hand, was the recipient of $100,000 Low gave him to buy fireworks for the occasion.</p>
<p>Low continued to support Kardashian and her husbands throughout the years and later presented her and Kanye West with a Jean-Michel Basquiat painting, which West ultimately declined. The now-fugitive also funded some of Kardashian’s gambling endeavors, including a Baccarat session from which she won $350,000.</p>
<p>Depending on how the investigation goes, however, Kim may be forced to hand some of these gifts over to the Department of Justice. This will apply if it turns out Low had used stolen money to purchase them.</p>
<p>The new findings resurged amid the current trial of Prakazrel “Pras” Michél, an ex-member of The Fugees. Michél was allegedly working with Low to fund money into Barack Obama’s 2012 presidential campaign.</p>
