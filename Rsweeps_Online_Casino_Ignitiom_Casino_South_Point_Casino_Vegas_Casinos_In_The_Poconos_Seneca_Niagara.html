    <h1>Rsweeps Online Casino Ignitiom Casino South Point Casino Vegas Casinos In The Poconos Seneca Niagara</h1>

<p>Dear Juanjose422,</p>
<p>Thank you for the update. I received a similar email from the casino too.</p>
<p>As we can see, the verification delay has a clear reason - your documents did not meet the casino's requirements before. However, the casino was able to verify your account. There is only one problem that allegedly caused this situation, and that is your legal threats. Therefore, the casino also needs to protect itself against future possible legal actions, and it could seem like a reasonable decision to refund only your deposits, close your account and put your account status and situation to the state before registration.</p>
<p>Now, please allow me to ask you a few more questions to clarify some of the circumstances and provide you with a suggestion to deal with your situation.</p>
<p>Were you aware of a fee before requesting a withdrawal? If not, are you aware that the casino has this information clearly stated in its "Banking" section, which is available for each player? Would you be able to accept this fee if the casino was willing to pay you the confiscated winnings via bank transfer? Did you already contact any authority regarding your issue, or do you plan to do it?</p>
<p>If possible, players should be paid using the payment method they used to deposit. However, the casino offers more options for a withdrawal, and I would like to ask the casino if it is possible to pay out the seized winnings using a different payment method. Your withdrawal was denied, and only your deposits were refunded. If the withdrawal was not processed, it means that the fee has not been deducted from the winnings yet, so it could be possible (if the casino is able and willing to do it) to withdraw them via another payment method without a fee. But I will discuss it with the casino, and when I have the relevant information, I will let you know.</p>
<p>Alternatively, in the meantime, are you please able to find information about NDA documents and think about an agreement with the casino about a solution for your issue in this way?</p>
