    <h1>Slotswin Casino Caesars Casino Silver Sevens Hotel Casino Las Vegas Casinos In Nh Graton Casino Ruby</h1>

<p>Before making this complaint I read your step by step i follow all your guidelines but it's to much for me already. I follow everything the casino support wants me to submit I talked to the my bank and gigadat and submitted everything they ask me to submit but. the last thing that's impossible to provide that they are asking is "The proof of your Interac account should depict email address linked to the bank account in your full name." I already submitted an e-statement, confirmation of transaction showing my name in the email, and the email address used in the transaction. i show them also the conversation between gigadat and the bank that they don't have anything to provide in what they ask but if they will be ask for transaction verification they can answer it but they insist for me to provide something that's not available.</p>
<p>This is my second withdrawal that and the first one has no problem so I keep on playing on their site because I prove at my 1st winning that online casino pay. and now this is what's happening I'm losing trust anymore in playing in other sites because of this. I lost already 60k cad but for them to pay 1000cad is very hard. I have all the copies of the requirements i submitted to them and every conversation of my bank and gigadat . it's almost 1Â½ months I thought I could use that money for my birthday but all it gave me was stress in complying with everything they need. I also have some conversation between me and their support group, but I didn't include it anymore it's only the same redundant conversation of the requirement that they cannot give me any sample of what they are referring to so that I could ask. I just attach the latest requirements that I submitted and you decide if it's not enough to prove my identity. It's always been a delaying tactics for them.its even hard to talk and explain to their support. I really need your help...</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>
