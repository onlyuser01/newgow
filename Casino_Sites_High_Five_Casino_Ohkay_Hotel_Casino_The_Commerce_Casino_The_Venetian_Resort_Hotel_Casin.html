<p>Anne de Kerckhove Joins 888 As Senior Independent Director</p>
<p>888 Holdings, a Gibraltar-based online gambling and gaming company, has appointed Anne de Kerckhove as a senior independent director.</p>
<p>De Kerckhove is a marketing, technology, and entertainment industry veteran with over 15 years of experience with some of the fastest-growing companies. She has been a non-executive director and chair of the nominations committee at 888 since November 2017, when she joined the group.</p>
<p>De Kerckhove is currently serving as the acting CEO of both Freespee and the London-based Iron Group. Freespee is a cloud-based collaboration tool that can be used for marketing, sales, and customer support. On the other hand, Iron Group is a technology firm that specializes in developing and investing in the digital subscription space.</p>
<p>She was previously the Managing Director EMEA for Videology, one of the largest online advertising technology platforms globally, where she oversaw the company’s growth into over 16 countries in just under three years.</p>
<p>De Kerckhove also serves on the boards of 7digital, WeMoms, and Snowite and is an angel investor and mentor for early-stage startups and entrepreneurial funds such as Metail, CRE, and Daphni.</p>
<p>Furthermore, de Kerckhove has held senior positions at companies such as Iron Capital, Reed Elsevier, and Influenced Gaming throughout her long and illustrious career.</p>
<p>CEO Brian Mattingley Welcomes De Kerckhove On Board</p>
<p>De Kerckhove joins 888 during a transitional period. Brian Mattingley, the company’s current acting chairman, will leave 888 in June to become Playtech’s new non-executive chairman. Mattingley will succeed Claire Milne, who served as Playtech’s acting non-executive chairman for two years while the organization searched for a permanent replacement,</p>
<p>The two companies have a history of cooperation. Just recently, Playtech and 888 teamed up for RNG and live casino games.</p>
<p>After more than 15 years with 888, Mattingley is due to quit on June 1, 2021. Mattingley joined 888 in 2005 and was the company’s CEO from 2012 to 2016. In 2019, he faced strong resistance to his re-election as chairman as some shareholders raised concerns regarding his length of service on the management board.</p>
<p>Mattingley will be succeeded by the former director of general election resources for the Labour Party Lord Jon Mendelsohn.</p>
<p>Mattingley lauded 888’s choice to appoint de Kerckhove as its new senior independent director. Her vast experience as an entrepreneur and investor, as well as her good track record on the Board and its Committees, he believes, makes her a valuable asset for 888 as the company continues to develop and achieve its strategic goals.</p>
<p>“I am delighted that she has agreed to take on the Senior Independent Director role,” he said.</p>
