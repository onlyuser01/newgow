<p>hi, i request you to look into this issue carefully, my account there is over a year old and verified what not.</p>
<p>recently ithis issue came that while playing on blackjack live table my account curreny goes to nit and after the hand is over it comes back to whatever my balance is, due to this i cant double down or split or buy insurance if i want to.</p>
<p>i have emailed to casino about 9 days ago. to which they said clear your cookies and catches we are not responsible for this, i did so and still problem persist, i again emailed then talk to support only for them to tell soory its software provider issue and we will get back once we have reply from them, i ask how much time its gonna take, to which they said stop playing in meanwhile when i m down around 15000 inr.</p>
<p>attaching screenshots of conversation over 50 emails have been exchanged but finallly they accepted prblem is there and make me wail to play any games.</p>
