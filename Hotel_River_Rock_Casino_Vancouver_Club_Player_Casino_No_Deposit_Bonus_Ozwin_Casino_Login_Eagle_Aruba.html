    <h1>Hotel River Rock Casino Vancouver Club Player Casino No Deposit Bonus Ozwin Casino Login Eagle Aruba</h1>

<p>Markor Technology has been granted a license approved by the Dirección General de Ordenación del Juego (DGOJ) and will, as a result, be able to deliver its aggregated iGaming content to local suppliers that choose to work with the company. DGOJ is the authority that issues licenses and regulates the industry and clearing all prerequisites with the watchdog is necessary for any company to start doing business in Spain.</p>
<p>Markor Brings Thousands of Games to the Spanish Market</p>
<p>Markor’s services will be available to any licensed gambling operator in Spain who seeks to add from the company’s more than 5,000 games of aggregated content. Markor prides itself on bringing titles from more than 70 distinct software providers, including the likes of Evolution, Red Tiger, NetEnt and Pragmatic Play. The platform has been consistently delivering excellent content thanks to its ability to attract top-tier platform providers. Markor Technology CEO Melissa Summerfield said:</p>
<p>Although we’ve only been in business for a couple of years, Markor Technology has already established itself as a reliable provider of game aggregation services in the iGaming industry – and the certification of our Spanish B2B platform will only strengthen this position further. Markor Technology CEO Melissa Summerfield</p>
<p>Among the games that are available at the aggregation solutions are such excellent choices as table games, live dealer options, keno, bingo, virtual scratch cards, and the all-time favorite genre, slots. Markor Technology has been also looking to actively secure more suppliers to its overall portfolio, to continue growing its overall game variety and compete with other aggregation solutions.</p>
<p>Markor’s Spanish groundbreaking move though is an important step forward for the company as it would allow it to rapidly scale its offer across the board and make its products available with even more players.</p>
<p>Summerfield said that the formal approval by the Spanish gaming authority was a significant step forward for the company which will now have the opportunity to offer local operators the opportunity to make a real impact by leveraging the thousands of select games that Markor brings forward.</p>
