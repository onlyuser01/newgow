<p>WeAreCasino, a fast-expanding casino aggregation platform has added another prominent partner to its ranks. Moving forward, players will be able to enjoy content by BETER Live. This is the live casino gaming division of BETER, a company that has been growing its presence in the world of sports, casino and live dealer content, games, and technology over the past games.</p>
<p>The company has also made seminal innovation in esports, bringing fresh widgets, features, and new ways to engage with esports fans. BETER Live will now have its games featured at WeAreCasino, which has welcomed the news as an exciting development that should lead to a fruitful partnership. According to WeAreCasino Head of Commercial and Sales, Rajendra Rowthu, the company is in for the long haul with BETER Live.</p>
<p>Rowthu praised BETER Live and called its products "flawless," offering a fresh take on the traditional live casino vertical. Part of this innovation has been captured by games such as Gravity Blackjack, which comes with a number of different features, such as multipliers and side bets.</p>
<p>BETER was equally pleased with the development. Company Chief Revenue Officer, Yori Arami, said that WeAreCasino is a leading aggregation platform and one that BETER was very happy to join. Arami expressed confidence that the product offered by BETER meets global standards.</p>
<p>"Our games are designed for a new generation of players who are always on the hunt for electrifying content, and that’s exactly what we see in WeAreCasino’s audience. I have no doubt that together, we will achieve even more amazing results," Amari concluded. BETER has been rapidly growing its footprint across all verticals.</p>
<p>Most recently, the company posted several prominent developments in esports, including a fresh partnership between the company and Bayes Esports. Previously, BETER added a dedicated iFrame solution for esports partners, which allows players to get faster real-time updates and be able to bet on esports events while in possession of all relevant facts and statistics.</p>
<p>Another big development for the company happened in October, when BETER confirmed that it had obtained a license from the Malta Gaming Authority, considerably expanding its international reach.</p>
