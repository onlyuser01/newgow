    <h1>Casino In Mesquite Casino In Wisconsin Dells Doubledown Casino Forum Dominican Fiesta Hotel Casino B</h1>

<p>The Boomtown and Margaritaville casinos in Bossier City, LA, are now licensed to offer sports betting. That brings the total number of legal Louisiana casinos that allow sports betting to nine.</p>
<p>Louisiana Advances Sports Betting Efforts</p>
<p>Ronnie Johns, chairman of the Louisiana Gaming Control Board (LGCB), said he had issued the licenses that will take effect Friday. Johns indicated that he thinks Margaritaville will open a sportsbook on Friday and Boomtown next Monday.</p>
<p>He added that five more licenses await approval by the State Police and Gaming Control Board and said he expects additional applications before the year ends.</p>
<p>Johns issued the first state gaming licenses last month to Harrah’s New Orleans and L’Auberge Casino in Baton Rouge. The Horseshoe Casino in Bossier City also received one, as did the Boomtown Casino in Harvey. Last week, licenses were granted to two Lake Charles casinos, Golden Nugget Casino and L’Auberge Casino.</p>
<p>The Golden Nugget and L’Auberge approvals mean that DraftKings will be able to open a sportsbook at both of the properties.</p>
<p>A DraftKings Sportsbook at the Golden Nugget covering 10,000 square feet is now being built. A temporary book is open, with 30 kiosks throughout the casino. DraftKings is the first operator to get LGCB approval for daily fantasy sport, which came this past summer.</p>
<p>The Paragon Casino is home to a ninth Louisiana-licensed sportsbook. However, it is managed by Tunica-Biloxi Tribe of Louisiana. This casino is not under the control of the Louisiana Gaming Control Board.</p>
<p>More Approvals Coming</p>
<p>Johns stated he will issue other licenses as soon he gets the OK of Louisiana State Police. They must approve each applicant’s application within the next week. Delays in the licensing process came as a result of a shift in resources to help Louisiana clean up after Hurricane Ida barreled through the area.</p>
<p>Louisiana’s 56 parishes approved sports betting last autumn. But, lawmakers had to put in place the framework to tax and regulate these wagers during 2021’s spring Legislative Session.</p>
<p>On-site sports betting, also known as betting parlors or sportsbooks, will become the new standard in betting on sports. They will be located at several of the state’s 20 riverboat casinos and land-based racetracks.</p>
<p>Johns claimed that it will be likely in 2022 before mobile betting options are offered by casinos.</p>
<p>The same timeline will apply to restaurants and bars looking to get sports betting kiosks for customers. This industry is controlled and managed by the Louisiana Lottery.</p>
<p>Parishes with voters who opposed the expansion of gambling will keep sports betting away. Caldwell, Catahoula, Franklin, Jackson, LaSalle, Sabine, Union, West Carroll and Winn parishes all rejected the idea.</p>
<p>Residents living within those parish boundaries cannot access mobile sports betting applications via geofencing.</p>
