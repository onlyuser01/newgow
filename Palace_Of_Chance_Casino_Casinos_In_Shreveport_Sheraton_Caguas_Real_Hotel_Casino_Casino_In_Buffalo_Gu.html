<p>The leading business-to-business sports betting platform provider of technology and services for the regulated gambling and betting industry, Kambi Group, announced a new strategic collaboration with one of the largest entertainment and gaming companies in Canada, Great Canadian Entertainment.</p>
<p>Details about the new collaboration were released last week and see the launch of Kambi's retail sportsbook solution for multiple Great Canadian venues in Ontario. The new multi-year deal will see Kambi provide its leading sportsbook for 10 such venues located in Canada's most populous province.</p>
<p>The venues that will benefit from Kambi's on-property sportsbook include the company's newest location, Pickering Casino Resort. According to a statement released by Kambi, the leading operator will benefit from a "high-performance retail sportsbook solution that includes state-of-the-art betting kiosks with fully configurable digital signage functionality."</p>
<p>Tony Rodio, Great Canadian's Chief Executive Officer, said about the recent partnership: "The addition of sports betting at 10 of our Ontario-based gaming destinations is an important new amenity, elevating the gaming experience for our guests."</p>
<p>He pointed out that Great Canadian is thankful to Kambi for the new partnership which designated the company as the first operator to launch this type of product in the regulated market in Ontario. Last but not least, Rodio thanked the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario, the provincial government and the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation for their ongoing support.</p>
<p>Kristian Nylén, Kambi's Co-founder and Chief Executive Officer, added that the company is delighted to join forces with Great Canadian for this sports betting partnership. He said that undoubtedly, Great Canadian is among the leading operators in Canada that offer unique gambling experiences.</p>
<p>"This underlines our position as the leading multi-channel sportsbook provider in North America and we are looking forward to working with the talented team at Great Canadian to deliver a market-leading sportsbook experience for its patrons," said Nylén in conclusion.</p>
<p>The Ontario-based Great Canadian is a company with a rich history. It was founded back in 1982 and by now it operates 25 gambling, entertainment and hospitality locations in Ontario, Nova Scotia, British Columbia and New Brunswick.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Kambi was founded more than a decade ago but that was enough for the company to prove itself as a premium provider of sports betting services around the globe. Currently, the company's clients include leading brands and operators such as Churchill Downs Incorporated, LeoVegas, Kindred Group, Rush Street Interactive and many more. Although the new partnership with Great Canadian is expected to have a minor impact on Kambi's revenue this year, the company expects to see a significant revenue boost by this deal in 2023.</p>
