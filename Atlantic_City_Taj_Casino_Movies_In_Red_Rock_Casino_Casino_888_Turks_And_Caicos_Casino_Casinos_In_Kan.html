<p>Week 18 brings us the final battle for the no. 1 spot in the AFC South division at the TIAA Bank Field Stadium in Jacksonville, Florida</p>
<p>Even though the Jacksonville Jaguars (8-8) have one win more than their divisional rivals, the Tennessee Titans (7-9), they still might end up without a playoff berth. In fact, it all comes to this – whoever wins the Titans vs Jaguars Week 18 game on Saturday will win the AFC South, thus getting to the playoffs.</p>

<p>Can Titans End Their 6-Game Losing Streak?</p>
<p>Not too long ago, the Titans looked like a team that was going to raise hell in the playoffs. After 10 games, they were 7-3 and it looked certain that they were going to qualify for the playoffs. However, since then, they’re 0-6 with a couple of shocking losses (e.g., the 19-14 loss to the Houston Texans).</p>
<p>If you’re wondering what happened to the Titans, the answer is injuries. A number of players in key positions got injured over the last couple of months. Some of them have made it back to the roster, which is great news. The bad news is that in the meantime, some others got on IR, most notably, their starting quarterback Ryan Tannehill.</p>
<p>It’s very likely Tannehill will miss the Week 18 game, which means that backup QB Joshua Dobbs will take the role of the signal-caller on Saturday. He made his first start as a Titan last weekend, when he went 29-for39 for 232 yards and one touchdown, while one of his passes got intercepted. Those aren’t too bad numbers, but his teammates just didn’t make use of his throws.</p>
<p>Still, to be fair to them, they did face one of the toughest defenses in the league – the Dallas Cowboys. This time, their job looks easier, but the trouble is that the Jags are going to be super motivated to get a win.</p>
<p>Jaguars to Cash In on Their Superb Form</p>
<p>The Jaguars are 4-0 since the surprising blowout loss to the Detroit Lions. When they lost 40-14 to the Lions, it seemed as if their playoff dreams are over. However, in their next game, they defeated the Titans, then went on to beat the Cowboys, Jets, and Texans.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for them, that wasn’t enough to secure the no.1 spot in the AFC South. They still need to beat the Titans to do so. Luckily for them, they look like a team that can do it.</p>
<p>Most of their key men are fit and ready for the Week 18 clash. More importantly, their crucial players are playing with confidence, which came after a couple of superb performances. Their QB Trevor Lawrence was nothing short of brilliant in December, throwing for three TDs against the Titans and four against the mighty Cowboys.</p>
<p>He did, however, fail to throw a single TD pass in the Jags’ final game of 2022 (vs Jets) as well as in their first game of 2023 (vs Texans). Is this something that should worry them?</p>
<p>Tennessee Titans vs Jacksonville Jaguars Prediction</p>
<p>The Titans’ strongest weapon this season is their defense. We think these guys have what it takes to tame Lawrence &amp; Co. The problem is that a good defensive performance probably won’t be enough for the Titans.</p>
<p>Their offense doesn’t look very sharp, especially not now that their starting QB is out with an injury. That’s why the only logical prediction is a Jaguars win, albeit minimal (probably by no more than a field goal).</p>
<p>Picks: Jacksonville Jaguars to win; under to hit</p>
