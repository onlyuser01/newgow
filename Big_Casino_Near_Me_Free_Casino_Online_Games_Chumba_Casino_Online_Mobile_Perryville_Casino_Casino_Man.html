<p>The “Think Like a Player” campaign will bring back a young version of Barkley using deepfake technology, encouraging basketball fans to sign up with limited-time promotions</p>
<p>FanDuel is employing increasingly creative methods to stand ahead of the competition and resonate with customers. The unique marketing campaign puts the leading sportsbook and fantasy sports operator at the forefront, appealing to generations of NBA fans. FanDuel has recently doubled up on such initiatives, fighting to increase engagement and brand awareness with frequent collaborations and special events.</p>
<p>The Promo Uses Cutting-Edge Technology</p>
<p>Attracting a high-profile NBA personality like Charles Barkley is a natural move for FanDuel, relying on the star’s candid and entertaining personality to reach new audiences. Barkley is a beloved basketball world figure, known for his on-court performances and role as a television analyst for TNT’s NBA coverage.</p>
<p>The “Think Like a Player” campaign will utilize deepfake technology to generate a version of Barkley from the 1990s called Young Chuck. The NBA legend will interact with his younger self, helping fans use FanDuel’s Same Game Parlay offerings. FanDuel EVP of marketing Andrew Sneyd was excited to launch the initiative and tap into Barkley’s substantial fanbase.</p>
<p>This campaign will… give us the opportunity to flex our creative muscle and demonstrate how we’re reaching our target audience in unique ways. Andrew Sneyd, FanDuel EVP of marketing</p>
<p>In addition to relying on Barkley’s popularity, FanDuel will entice new customers with a limited-time signup offer, giving them $150 in site credit just for making a first bet of $5. The operator also hinted at more bonus offerings coming throughout the postseason. Such aggressive marketing is becoming increasingly common as companies seek to increase their exposure in the dynamic US sports betting market.</p>
<p>FanDuel Doubles Down on Flashy Marketing Campaigns</p>
<p>The collaboration with Barkley is part of FanDuel’s broader media strategy. At the beginning of April, the operator expanded its partnership with The Ringer, a digital media company known for its sports coverage and analysis. Its audience predominantly consists of sports fans interested in daily fantasy sports and online sports betting, making the collaboration a natural fit.</p>
<p>The two companies will collaborate to create new sports shows and adapt several popular video podcasts for FanDuel TV. Their partnership should provide valuable exposure and engagement for both parties. The enhanced platform will also be the perfect place to showcase the “Think Like a Player” campaign airing throughout the play-in tournament.</p>
<p>FanDuel’s continued reliance on flashy, impressive promotional campaigns goes against industry trends but has so far netted mixed results. The operator’s Super Bowl LVII ad largely failed to justify the $7 million investment, garnering conflicting opinions from fans. However, FanDuel appears confident in such an approach and is seeking increasingly more creative ways to reach out and attract new users.</p>
