<p>Ahead of the launch of mobile sports betting in Massachusetts, the leading iGaming and sports betting operator, BetMGM, announced a new partnership. The company confirmed earlier this week that it has joined forces with the Boston Red Sox, the professional baseball team based in Boston, Massachusetts.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the new collaboration, the leading iGaming and sports betting operator was designated as an Official Sports Betting Partner of the team. The new collaboration marked the first sports betting deal for Red Sox. At the same time, the partnership is BetMGM's first deal with a sports team in Massachusetts.</p>
<p>The recent deal will see BetMGM benefit from signage at Fenway Park including on the ballpark's left field wall and the famous Green Monster. Additionally, the company will be able to offer unique VIP experiences via a designated suite at the stadium.</p>
<p>Not unexpectedly, the collaboration will also involve the digital channels of BetMGM and the Red Sox. Thanks to the new deal, co-branded content will be featured via the duo's social media platforms and digital channels. The latest deal builds further the positive relationship between MGM Resorts and the Red Sox as well. In fact, the duo previously inked a multi-year deal that saw MGM Resorts become the Official Resort Casino Partner of the famous professional baseball team.</p>
<p>Chris Kelley, the COO and President of MGM Resorts, shared his excitement in a statement saying: "As host of the annual Red Sox Winter weekend, MGM Springfield has become a destination for New England baseball fans." Finally, he explained that the company remains committed to offering responsible experiences for its customers in Massachusetts.</p>
<p>Troup Parkinson, Boston Red Sox's Executive Vice President of Partnerships, was also excited about the deal and explained that the team is delighted to team up with BetMGM. Moreover, he acknowledged that the deal comes ahead of a "new era of professional sports betting" in the state.</p>
<p>"Given our strong relationship with MGM Resorts, BetMGM was the clear choice to become the first sports betting partner of the club, and we look forward to them offering sports betting opportunities to our fans in a safe and responsible manner," said Parkinson in conclusion.</p>
<p>BetMGM's Chief Revenue Officer, Matt Prevost, added that the company is excited to deliver new and engaging experiences for fans of the Red Sox. He pointed out that the team has one of the most passionate fans in baseball. In conclusion, Prevost said: "We look forward to working together to elevate the gameday experience in Boston."</p>
