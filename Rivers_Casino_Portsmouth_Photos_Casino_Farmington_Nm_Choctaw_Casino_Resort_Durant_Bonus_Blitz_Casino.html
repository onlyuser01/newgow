<p>BetMakers’ MonmouthBets app will be the first regulated fixed odds betting app for horse racing in the US</p>
<p>BetMakers Technology Group, a betting technology specialist, has changed the game with the launch of its new MonmouthBets app. What makes the announcement so special is the fact that this will be the first regulated fixed odds betting app for horse racing in the US.</p>
<p>MonmouthBets Launches in NJ</p>
<p>Just after securing an extension of its partnership with kwiff, BetMakers once again made headlines with the announcement of its MonmouthBets app.</p>
<p>MonmouthBets has successfully secured the approval of the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement. It will start taking wagers ahead of the opening day of the upcoming Monmouth Park event, which kicks off tomorrow.</p>
<p>The races at Monmouth Park will run through September 10. However, they will not be the only fixed odds wagering options available on MonmouthBets. New Jersey players will also be able to bet on a variety of other tracks.</p>
<p>At first, players can expect to find betting markets for races at Tampa Bay Downs, Canterbury Park, Delaware Park, Hawthorne Race Course, Emerald Downs, and Century Mile, as well as the all-turf Monmouth at Meadowlands meeting.</p>
<p>The App Answers to Fans’ Demands</p>
<p>The launch of MonmouthBets seeks to capitalize on the increasing demand for fixed odds wagering on horse racing. BetMakers recently commissioned a survey into fans’ betting desires and found out that an astonishing 83% of US horseplayers would like a fixed odds betting option alongside the existing pari-mutuel wagering system.</p>
<p>The survey also revealed that two in three sports bettors would consider wagering on horse racing if fixed odds are available.</p>
<p>BetMakers isn’t new to fixed odds, having already distributed retail fixed odds in New Jersey in 2022. The company’s products enjoy international success, which it seeks to replicate in New Jersey.</p>
<p>BetMakes Is Excited to Provide Horseplayers with Fixed Odds Betting</p>
<p>BetMakers’ chief executive officer, Jake Henson, commented on the matter, saying that his team is looking forward to bringing fixed odds betting to digital horseplayers.</p>
<p>Fixed odds betting will help to form a healthy betting ecosystem for horse racing in New Jersey and beyond, with the transformative potential to provide a massive benefit to the entire racing industry. Jake Henson, CEO, BetMakers</p>
<p>Dennis Drazin, CEO and chair of Darby Development, which operates Monmouth Park, also shared his thoughts on the launch. He is excited to be able to provide fans with the ability to make wagering as convenient for horseplayers as it is for sports bettors.</p>
<p>We believe it will attract new customers, drive growth and increase handle significantly. Dennis Drazin, CEO &amp; chair, Darby Development</p>
<p>Last month BetMakers expanded GRN’s footprint in the UK and Ireland through a deal with 1/ST Content.</p>
