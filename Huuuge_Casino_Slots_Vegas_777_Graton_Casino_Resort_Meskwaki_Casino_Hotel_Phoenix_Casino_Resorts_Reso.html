<p>The NeoGames SA subsidiary has teamed up with the prominent Swedish gaming group, which will benefit from Pariplay’s extensive aggregated and original content</p>
<p>Moving forward Betsson will have access to Pariplay’s original products delivered through Wizard Games, and more than 14,000 other titles integrated as part of the Fusion platform and delivered by dozens of suppliers.</p>
<p>These third-party games will be integrated with Betsson’s existing operations in regulated markets, including in places such as Sweden, Denmark, and Spain, and other places of interest for the group where it has licenses in Europe.</p>
<p>The partnership marks another opportunity for Pariplay as the company seeks to continue growing its footprint in regulated markets. Betsson will provide the company’s full catalog of titles and integrate them along with a number of player engagement solutions designed to have an immediate impact on results and performance.</p>
<p>Pariplay VP of Sales Andrew Maclean said that his company was constantly trying to grow in important markets across Europe, which will now be possible through the alliance with Betsson.</p>
<p>Strengthening Breadth of Content with Fusion</p>
<p>Fusion will be able to reach Betsson’s players and offer them what the company believes is the widest range of titles with clear added value to both consumers and operators. “It is the next step in what I believe will be a long, successful alliance,” concluded Maclean adding that cutting-edge engagement tools are part of the offer.</p>
<p>Betsson supplier relations manager Laura Peretta was similarly pleased with the partnership and insisted that it would provide the company with a huge breadth of content from many well-established and proven studios in the industry. She explained:</p>
<p>The variety of content we now have access to is sure to engage our audience in the many established regulated markets in Europe and beyond that we are active in. Laura Peretta, supplier relations manager at Betsson</p>
<p>In the meantime, Pariplay has been expanding its presence through numerous partnership opportunities. The company similarly teamed up with BoyleSports to provide the operator with the same range of experience as it is now Betsson.</p>
<p>Pariplay also added Jelly Entertainment as one of the studios that are now part of its aggregation platform at the beginning of February. Pariplay similarly expanded its content variety with a Mancala Gaming partnership in January.</p>
