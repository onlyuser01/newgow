<p>The bookmaker will continue as the company’s “Good Morning Racing” series title sponsor, which is the live and daily festival preview show hosted by Racing Post, an SSG company. Paddy Power will sponsor the next 15 morning shows, which include every day of the Grand National festival, Royal Ascot, and naturally, the Cheltenham Festival.</p>
<p>SSG and Paddy Power Racing Experts Return Once Again</p>
<p>The Cheltenham Festival-focused shows will be hosted and attended by a number of prominent figures from the world of racing, including Paul Kealy, Jerry McGrath, Mick Fitzgerald, David Jennings, Kate Tracey, and Paddy Power’s own representatives.</p>
<p>To boost viewership and engagement, Paddy Power is also giving away £150,000 ($182,000) on Tuesday as part of its “Finders Keepers” campaign, coinciding with the start of the Cheltenham Festival. Punters need to be on their toes, however, as £5,000 will be dropped across random accounts with racing fans having only 15 minutes to claim their prize. Those punters who miss out on the big prize will be left with £500 ($600) – still not bad.</p>
<p>Commenting on this new opportunity, Spotlight Sports Group CCO Sam Houlding hailed the opportunity to build up on the robust partnership once again with Paddy Power. “Our daily and live Good Morning Racing shows are an essential part of our digital coverage surrounding racing festivals,” Houlding explained and added:</p>
<p>We’d like to think we bring to Good Morning Racing what Piers Morgan brought to Good Morning Britain, informative insights with unexpected outbursts. We’re looking forward to saddling up for another wild ride with the team this year. Spotlight Sports Group CCO Sam Houlding</p>
<p>Leveraging Familiar Technology for Better Results</p>
<p>He argued that bringing together Paddy Power and Racing Post’s experts would serve a wide-ranging audience and deliver important insights that will feel rewarding and meaningful to viewers and sports fans.</p>
<p>Good Morning Racing is one of the most popular series by the company, and it has been enjoying very strong engagement numbers since it launched last year. It was shared live across both Racing Post and Paddy Power distribution channels and leveraged SSG’s advanced mobile studio-to-film and stream live on-location technology and solutions, offering sports fans a truly rewarding experience across the board.</p>
