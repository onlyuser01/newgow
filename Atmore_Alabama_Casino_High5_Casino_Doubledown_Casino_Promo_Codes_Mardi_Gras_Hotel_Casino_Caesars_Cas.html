<p>Kambi Group plc will deploy its solutions for the land-based properties owned by Mohegan, named the Fallsview Casino Resort and Casino Niagara. Both locations will benefit from Kambi’s trusted sports betting solutions and market-leading platform.</p>
<p>This integration will extend to the full suite of sports betting technology that Kambi delivers for leading brands around the world and will help Mohegan establish its footprint as a leading operator and owner of casinos that focus on land-based sports gambling in the recently regulated iGaming and betting market in Ontario, Canada.</p>
<p>The integration is still subject to pending approvals, but the deal is expected to clear without any regulatory hiccups. The partnership should see 36 new kiosks installed across the Casino Niagara and Fallsview Casino Resort properties. Further plans have the Casino Niagara’s sports bar end up being converted into dedicated sports betting space.</p>
<p>The new retail sportsbook will feature a number of technological improvements across the board and power the sports betting experience for all visitors. The partnership is also a continuation of a previous partnership with Kambi for the Digital’s PlayFallsview online sportsbook which is currently operated by Mohegan in the province and powered by the trusted sports betting technology supplier.</p>
<p>Kambi CEO and Co-Founder Kristian Nylén noted that the partnership was an important step forward for the two companies. Nylén said that the partnership successfully builds upon the online betting collaboration the two companies have established previously.</p>
<p>"This exciting partnership enables Fallsview Casino and Casino Niagara to leverage their long-standing brands to provide their guests with a place to enjoy a leading sports betting product," Nylén continued. The collaboration was welcomed by Niagara Casinos President Richard Taylor who was also happy with the opportunity to bring Kambi as the tech supplier on-site for the Fallsview Casino Resort and Casino Niagara.</p>
<p>Taylor said that the land-based properties remained committed to helping Ontario develop its sports betting industry as a whole and confirmed that the company is working very closely with the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation and the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario to achieve just that.</p>
<p>This opportunity with Kambi will only allow the company to continue elevating the experience for everyone involved – from the business to the customers who come to the properties to place a sports wager on the outcome of their favorite sport.</p>
