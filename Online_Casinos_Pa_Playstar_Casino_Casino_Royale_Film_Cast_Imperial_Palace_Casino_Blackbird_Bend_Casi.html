<p>Show Me the Honey review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Show Me The Honey takes you inside the lives of the world’s most important pollinators. The symbols are all either bees, flowers, or Ace to Ten symbols written out in honeycomb hexagons.</p>
<p>The world created for this slot is very cute with bees wearing sunglasses and a Winnie the Pooh style vibe when it comes to hive design.</p>
<p>It’s an interesting theme well executed by Genii and has a pleasant sense of character.</p>
<p>Win in the free spins bonus game</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The presentation of the reels, with the symbols floating in the air against an empty sky is an interesting visual choice that would pay off better if the background were more interesting.</p>
<p>The symbols are a little tacky, if full of character. The main problem with the symbols is the overall colour scheme, which is oddly offputting for any player with human eyes.</p>
<p>One place Show Me The Honey does shine is in sound design. As well as the gentle background track, the spinning of the reels each adds a note to the tune, turning your spins seamlessly into part of the musical accompaniment.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Show Me the Honey takes its format from the larval stage of slot design: the standard five reels with three rows of symbols that is more or less the default in this industry.</p>
<p>Over these reels there are forty win lines, and a few simple bonuses to sweeten the honey-pot.</p>
<p>Gameplay video featuring free spins</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbols substitute for all other symbols apart from the Feature and Free Spin symbols.</p>
<p>If you manage to land three or more Feature symbols anywhere on the reels, it will trigger the Beehive Feature Game which will hand out prized proportional to your total bet.</p>
<p>Beehive bonus game activates if you hit at least 3 Scatters</p>
<p>Hitting three or more Free Spin symbols will land you 8 free spins for three symbols, 12 for four, and 16 for five. You can retrigger Free Spins again, and you can also trigger the Beehive Feature in the Free Spin bonus.</p>
<p>Additionally, you will receive some Random Wilds. The Random Wilds occur in the Free Spin and will turn a number of random symbols Wild on the reels before the wins are calculated.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The publisher has not made the return to player for Show Me The Honey public. This is a red flag and might be hiding a Queen Bee’s ransom in vigorish.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum of $/£/€0.40 per spin if playing all forty lines but you can bet as little as $/£/€0.01 per spin if you are willing to just play the one line. The maximum bet per spin on the site we tested was $/£/€50.00.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is medium.</p>
<p>Paytable for top paying symbols</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Given the lack of return to player information, Show Me The Honey is off to a rough start with us. We believe the player should have all the information before deciding what to play.</p>
<p>Given that on top of this, the volatility isn’t very high, making it a poor match for our preferred strategies, and given that the overall gameplay is not very exciting, most players would be wise to pass on this one.</p>
<p>What I would like to see more of is the intelligent sound design choices.</p>
