    <h1>75 Free Chip Funclub Casino Casino Mafia Movie Hollywood Casino Tunica Ms Riverside Casino In Laughl</h1>

<p>Good evening, of course I had identified my account normally without problems, I normally only gambled ... I had the account for years and I played once a month for 5 â‚¬, we are talking now for 15 years ago ... I made some withdrawals ... and because I asked for some moment a bonus a psychologist called me because they considered me addicted ... I laugh honestly.k they limited me because I told them by what criteria did this conclusion come out ?? It is an insult to my face, I am a very decent person, I have not given any such right .. I have an account in three companies for years and I have never had such problems .. and I do not accept anyone, let alone in an impersonal company, to talk to me like that and call me due to addiction ... and I re-account with this company now after 15 years I did identification normally they accepted my details my account was identified and the next day they send me an email saying that my account has been restricted .. them I say why they never gave me any explanation ... and I consider it very to very unacceptable behavior and also very severe punishment for no reason and not only from me I have heard it and from other people who excluded them like that without a serious reason ... no we are just gamblers, people who have a family, a job, dignity, we do not only deal with gambling. and they can not draw conclusions about a person they do not know..and not only that nor they get a phone call to discuss the issue ... to tell me why they have excluded me..to give me a chance to open my account to see if I'm addicted or not ... This can not continue to offend the company ... neither tax office nor court .... neither school nor church .... betting company is ... they have it understand or not .... ?? thank you very much</p>
