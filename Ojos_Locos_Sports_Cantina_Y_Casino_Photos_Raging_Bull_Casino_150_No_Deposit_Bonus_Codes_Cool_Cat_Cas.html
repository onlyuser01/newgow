<p>The latest content partnership between leading crypto casino Bitcasino.io and crypto gaming supplier OneTouch is a step forward for both companies.</p>
<p>Bitcasino Excited to Add OneTouch’s Products</p>
<p>Bitcasino.io owned by Coingaming Group and mobile casino developer OneTouch have tied up a fresh content partnership. As per the partnership, OneTouch, which is a company focusing on blockchain gaming, will provide Bitcasino.io with some of the best games part of its portfolio.</p>
<p>OneTouch features dozens of quality and intuitive titles developed specifically for the blockchain gaming segment. Bitcasino.io, founded in 2014, is the world’s leading casino focusing on cryptocurrency gaming.</p>
<p>Now, OneTouch will debut some of its most accomplished titles, including but not limited to live dealer versions of roulette, blackjack and baccarat. Bitcasino.io is a legitimate gaming operator with over six years of experience in the blockchain gaming industry.</p>
<p>Commenting on the newly-struck partnership, Ollie Castleman, OneTouch’s Head of Marketing, said that Bitcasino’s status as the leading crypto gaming specialist in the industry was an exciting opportunity for OneTouch.</p>
<p>According to Castleman, the partnership allows OneTouch to continue building in new and dynamic verticals.</p>
<p>Our unique mobile-first gaming suite has continued to go from strength to strength this year, and we’ve lined up an additional range of exciting product launches and operator deals for the coming period.</p>
<p>Bitcasino Director of Casino Tauri Tiitsaar expressed his satisfaction with the latest partnership struck between the companies. According to Tiitsaar, OneTouch is one of the fastest-growing suppliers of gaming products for the industry.</p>
<p>Their collection of slot and table games is impressive, Tiitsaar added. He further lauded the company for its proven and established track record in providing “fun, fast and fair immersive gaming experiences.”</p>
<p>Lastly, he added that Bitcasino.io had no doubt that the new products are going to be a “big hit” with the consumer base. OneTouch, in the meantime, has been working hard on establishing itself as a viable supplier in iGaming, with a specific focus on cryptocurrency gaming.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the company signed a partnership with Slotegrator, a company focused on distributing games across the world. Before that, in July, OneTouch also signed another partnership, with Revolver Gaming.</p>
<p>OneTouch appointed a new Head of Business Development &amp; Operations in the face of Petra Maria Poola who will be in charge of growing the company’s commercial network. She will help find new venues of growth and negotiate pivotal and strategic partnerships for her company.</p>
<p>Crypto gaming offers interesting outlets, including a Play-to-Earn type of games, which many estimate are the future of online gaming.</p>
