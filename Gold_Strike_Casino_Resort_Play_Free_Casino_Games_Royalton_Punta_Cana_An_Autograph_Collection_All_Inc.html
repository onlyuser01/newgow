<p>FeedConstruct has teamed up with the Ukrainian Association of Football for the new soccer season. The deal will allow FeedConstruct to acquire and distribute the exclusive data and video coverage of the country’s Premier League, and it is taking place as the Russian war on Ukraine which began in February continues.</p>
<p>Soccer Returns to Ukraine Despite War in the East</p>
<p>Commenting on this opportunity, Ukrainian Football Association’s Andrii Pavelko said that the restarting of the soccer season was a clear signal that the country will repel the Russian aggressors and win this conflict. Pavelko added:</p>
<p>Restarting football is a big step for the country. It’s a sign to the world that Ukraine can and will win. It’s also a sign to society that we are confident. Ukrainian Football Association’s Andrii Pavelko</p>
<p>The war followed almost a full year of mobilization of Russian soldiers across the Ukrainian border with Belarus and Russia, including in the occupied Donbas region. Since the war broke out, Ukraine has had to discontinue sports events until now, with Ukrainian forces advancing steadily in multiple directions in the East.</p>
<p>FeedConstruct CEO Artashes Sargsyan chose to focus purely on the business aspect of the deal and said that despite the challenging circumstances, Ukrainian soccer has demonstrated a strong will, and now, fans around the world, will have the opportunity to follow the competition through FeedConstruct’s offer.</p>
<p>FeedConstruct has confirmed that more than 200 matches will be shown through its solutions and the league will get the coverage it deserves as the first games are set to arrive. The war in Ukraine has had a toll on the gambling and sports industry as well.</p>
<p>The state regulator, KRAIL, has canceled the licenses of TBK, a company that is said to be operating 1xBet, allegedly a Russian-affiliated company. KRAIL also recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding with its Lithuanian counterpart for the exchange of know-how in order to strengthen AML and CTF practices.</p>
