<p>Washington Commanders Offense Looks Horrible</p>
<p>The Commanders are 1-4 in the 2022 season with a score differential of 90-128. They have one of the worst offensive teams in the NFL, for which many are blaming their new quarterback, Carson Wentz.</p>
<p>The former Pro Bowler has thrown six interceptions and taken 20 sacks in 2022, which makes him one of the worst QBs in the league. In fact, Matt Ryan of the Indianapolis Colts (Wentz‚Äôs former team) is the only signal-caller who‚Äôs worse than him in these two stats.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for the Commanders, it‚Äôs not only their quarterback who‚Äôs been below par in 2022. Their running game has also been dreadful, which is something that cost them the win in last weekend‚Äôs game against the Titans.</p>
<p>As I look back in super slo-mo on the game sealing INT for the #Titans ‚Äì it did appear that Wentz had Terry at his break on the quick slant before he was bumped off. Appears to be staring right at him. Didn't pull trigger if he saw it.</p>

<p>In the final moments of the game, Wentz &amp; Co. came to just two yards from the ends zone, but the Commanders just didn‚Äôt have anyone to take the ball over the edge. Instead, Wentz went for a throw, which ended up intercepted. Failing to score those six points cost them the game as the Titans won 21-17.</p>
<p>Chicago Bears Hoping for a Big Leap Forward</p>
<p>The Bears are 2-3 in the 2022 season, which is actually a fantastic record considering that were underdogs in four of those games. Quality-wise, they‚Äôre not an elite team, but their players have been very motivated this season.</p>
<p>They all seem to can‚Äôt want to get on the pitch to show what they got. Sometimes they do well, and sometimes they fail, but they never seem to back down. That kind of football philosophy might be exactly what‚Äôs going to get them to .500 on Thursday night.</p>
<p>We expect to see the 23-year-old quarterback Justin Fields to play well against the Commanders, knowing that this guy loves playing at Soldier Field. Since becoming Chicago‚Äôs signal-caller in 2021, he‚Äôs thrown for 1,209 yards at home, for 5 TDs and 7 interceptions.</p>
<p>These stats might not seem great, but it‚Äôs because he had a horrible time the last time he played in Chicago. It was in Week 3 against the Houston Texans when he threw for two interceptions and no TDs. His team won that game, but Fields probably feels as if he needs to right the wrong in Week 6.</p>
<p>Washington Commanders vs Chicago Bears Prediction</p>
<p>This is going to be a very close game, but we think the hosts will triumph. The Bears offense is going to do well enough, while their defense should be able to tame the Commanders.</p>
<p>Picks: Chicago Bears to win; under to hit</p>
