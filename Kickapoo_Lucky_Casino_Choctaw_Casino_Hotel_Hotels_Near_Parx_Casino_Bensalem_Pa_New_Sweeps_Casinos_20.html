Per the new deal, games from Pragmatic's Virtual Sports portfolio including Horse and Greyhound racing as well as Force 1 will be available for Vibra Gaming's clients.</p>

<p>In a statement released on February 7, 2023, Vibra Gaming's representative, Ramiro Atucha, said that the company is excited to add content from Pragmatic Play to its platform.
