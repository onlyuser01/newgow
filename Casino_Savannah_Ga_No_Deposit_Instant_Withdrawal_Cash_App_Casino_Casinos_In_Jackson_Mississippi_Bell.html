    <h1>Casino Savannah Ga No Deposit Instant Withdrawal Cash App Casino Casinos In Jackson Mississippi Bell</h1>

<p>888 Holdings, a company operating several gambling brands, recently completed the acquisition of the British operator William Hill. The former company followed this up with changes to its team and has now introduced an expansion of its own board of directors as well.</p>
<p>The Holding Expands Board to Nine Members</p>
<p>888 announced that it will be adding three new members to its board. Andrea Gisle Joosen, Andria Vidler and Randy Freer are all joining the company as non-executive directors with immediate effect. Following this, 888’s team will now have nine members in total.</p>
<p>All three appointees have years of prior experience in various companies and will bring valuable expertise to 888’s team. Lord Mendelsohn, the non-executive chairman of 888 Holdings, welcomed the three new directors.</p>
<p>“As well as further strengthening the group’s corporate governance structure, they each bring extensive and highly relevant skills and experience to our board which will be of significant benefit to the group as it delivers its long-term strategic objectives as an enlarged business post the completion of our acquisition of William Hill.”</p>
<p>The New Directors Bring Valuable Expertise</p>
<p>Joosen, for example, has years of experience as a director. She has served various companies, including Mr Green, a gaming brand now owned by William Hill. Joosen also has extensive experience as a non-executive director. She has previously served in this position during her time on Currys and Billerud’s boards.</p>
<p>In addition, Joosen has experience with various executive roles in media and technology. She has worked for numerous companies of various origins and is sure to quickly adapt to 888’s team.</p>
<p>Vidler, on the other hand, has long served in the marketing and technology sectors and will bring valuable insights to 888. She has held various positions in her decades-long career, with one of the most notable ones being the CEO of Tag EMEA.</p>
<p>Vidler also has notable experience as a board member during her time at Gamesys where she served as a chair of the ESG committee.</p>
<p>Lastly, Freer is the active CEO of The Freer Company – a business consultancy that offers valuable advice to its partners. He has also served as the CEO of Hulu, a subscription-based streaming service. His experience in positions of responsibility will greatly benefit 888.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that 888 Holdings may soon round up its team to ten members. The company is planning to add Ori Shaked, a famous gaming entrepreneur, to its board. However, his addition is still subject to various regulatory approvals.</p>
