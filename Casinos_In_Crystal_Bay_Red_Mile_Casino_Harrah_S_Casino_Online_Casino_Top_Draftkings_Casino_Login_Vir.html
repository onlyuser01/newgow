<p>You are in safe hands We guarantee that all sites listed on GamblingNews.com are safe, legitimate, and secure operators that will help bring out the best possible iGaming experience. We will never knowingly promote unlicensed or blacklisted websites that operate against jurisdictional laws. Each brand we review is always manually co-verified by an online gambling expert. Legal and regulated</p>
<p>SSL-encrypted</p>
<p>Secure and licensed</p>
<p>VirginCasino.com is one of the early entrants in the New Jersey iGaming space. The website launched in 2014 under the Tropicana Atlantic City license and is one of the most significant online casinos in the Garden State.</p>
<p>Powered by Gamesys Group’s proprietary software, there is a lot Virgin Casino can offer to players. The brand runs a generous selection of over 180 slot games along with many table game variants, bingo, and free titles to try.</p>
<p>The casino is highly regarded in the New Jersey gaming market and generates a fair bit of traffic, eliciting strong interest and offering generous promotions back. In terms of raw potential, Virgin Casino NJ has plenty to offer, and we study this and more in our dedicated review.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that Virgin Online Casino and Tropicana are sister sites, powered by the same software provider and sharing a lot of similarities in terms of a user interface, functionality, bonusing system, and more.</p>
<p>Virgin Casino Promo Code</p>
<p>Virgin Casino runs a generous selection of promotions that allows you to easily benefit from various offers that directly boost your bankroll and have a positive impact on your gameplay.</p>
<p>The casino is in the habit of delivering great personalized offers, including some that require a bonus code. The Virgin Casino promo code is usually available as a part of an affiliate website’s offer, but the casino may also extend it independently to individual players.</p>
<p>To make sure you are always in the know vis-à-vis promo codes, it’s best to subscribe to Virgin Casino Online’s offers which will be emailed to you directly. A promo code is not always there, but you will be able to find a great casino bonus at Virgin Online regardless.</p>
<p>$100 Sign-up Bonus</p>
<p>A promo code is great, but nothing signals loyalty to customers as a bonus that will help you consistently without the need for you to oversee every step or look for a dedicated string of numbers and letters.</p>
<p>The $100 Real Cash Back offer extended to new players will allow you to gain up to $100 of any losses generated at Virgin Online Casino slot games. All you need to do to qualify for this offer is to deposit at least $10.</p>
<p>Virgin Casino will save you any trouble as the cashback is paid in money that is immediately withdrawable and not subject to wagering requirements. It may take the casino up to three days to allocate the bonus into your account.</p>
<p>Overall, the bonus is an easy way for you to have a neat little fallback solution that allows you to quickly spring right back into action if Lady Luck doesn’t smile on you during your first session.</p>
<p>More Promotions</p>
<p>Virgin Casino naturally has plenty to offer in the bonus department, with generous promotions extended to players every day. The casino packs numerous treats that will help make your experience more entertaining and add value to your gameplay each step of the way.</p>
<p>While not all exclusive offers are styled as bonuses, Virgin Casino makes sure that there are plenty of options you can readily partake in. Players will be able to vie for a community jackpot worth at least $10,000 with $20,000 in additional prizes available for the rest of the players.</p>
<p>You will further be able to explore an outstanding array of promos, including but not limited to Daily Free Games, Refer a Friend, and a dedicated VIP Experience. One of the great things about Virgin Casino’s VIP program is that it has no attrition – your points do not decay over time.</p>
<p>As a member of the VIP program, you will be eligible for various rewards, including but not limited to ongoing bonuses directly related to the loyalty program, luxury gifts, various exclusives, and more.</p>
<p>You want to continue stacking up the native V Points to access more rewards, but generally, that is an automated process that shouldn’t be any troublesome.</p>
<p>Slots</p>
<p>Virgin Casino has gone a long way, and today, the casino has a generous selection of titles to treat you to. Players will be able to pick from numerous games that have been brought to you by the likes of NetEnt, IGT, and Williams Interactive Software.</p>
<p>The underpinning software also guarantees smooth overall gameplay, which is an additional incentive for players to try Virgin Casino. With over 230 games in the library, variety is not an issue.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Virgin Casino has focused on known player-favorite games creating a tempting and actionable selection of titles. Those include:</p>
<p>Asgardian Stones</p>
<p>Blood Suckers II</p>
<p>Dead or Alive</p>
<p>Egg’o’Matic</p>
<p>Gonzo’s Quest</p>
<p>Guns N Roses</p>
<p>There are many other slots you would want to try as well, and we believe Starburst, Conan Video Slot, and Finn’s Golden Tavern are just some of the many spot-on options here. The minimum bets start at $0.10 and go all the way up to $100 per slot.</p>
<p>You can test every game as a demo or play it for real money as long as you are 21 years of age. Best of all, players will have a spot-on selection of table games that really add spice to your next Virgin Online Casino session, promo code, or no promo code.</p>
<p>Oh, and if this means something to you, you will be happy to know that there are actually progressive jackpots in games such as Wonderland and Deal or No Deal, where you can win north of $200,000 depending on the current prize pool accumulation.</p>
<p>The casino has more to offer when it comes to slots, too. There are dedicated Megaways slots, and not least, Virgin Casino enjoys some exclusives that you will only find on the Gamesys platform powering Tropicana and Virgin.</p>
<p>Table Games</p>
<p>While most players go a little loopy for slots, table games are an indelible part of the online casino experience. You will have plenty of top-notch choices whether you are a budget player or want to roll with the high rolling action. Games such as European and American Roulette will provide you with plenty of entertaining gameplay right at the heart of Virgin Online Casino, which has taken proper care of its selection of titles.</p>
<p>You will find numerous classic casino gems, including Baccarat, Craps, Keno, Blackjack, and French Roulette. Owing to its unique gameplay features, French Roulette can be quite compelling when it comes to slashing the house edge and giving you a fair shot at winning yourself.</p>
<p>For those looking for even slightly more exotic options, there is Pai Gow Poker to try, and while the table games selection can use some work and there is no live dealer casino, you can still enjoy a spot-on experience. The single deck blackjack version offers you a great 3:2 payout, and the dealer stands on soft 17, making it easy to use various blackjack strategies to make your next session work.</p>
<p>Bingo and Free Games</p>
<p>Virgin Casino never misses an opportunity to make a dull moment more enjoyable. As a result, you can expect to find a fair few options that will impact your sessions positively. Having a quick one at 90 Ball Bingo is always fun, and you get to enjoy some free games as you go along. The betting range here is anything from $1 to $5 per single wager.</p>
<p>Video Poker</p>
<p>Video poker is another feather in Virgin Casino’s iGaming cap. The website runs numerous video poker options for you to try, including Jacks or Better, Triple Play Draw Poker, Five Play Draw Poker, and Double Bonus Poker.</p>
<p>The return-to-player (RTP) rate is anything from 99.59% to 99.98%, easily making video poker one of the most worthwhile games on the website. You will have many great choices to entertain here and be able to leverage some understanding and skill in trying to beat the house.</p>
<p>Banking</p>
<p>A hallmark of a great website is how quickly you can move your money around. Players will find Virgin Casino to have thought of that and more. Benefiting from its status as a licensed casino, the website can provide players with a number of quick and easy deposits and withdrawals.</p>
<p>Deposits</p>
<p>You will be able to deposit at least $10, and the maximum amount per transaction will be determined by each method:</p>
<p>Bank cards</p>
<p>Cash at 7-Eleven</p>
<p>Cash at the casino cage</p>
<p>Instant e-check (ACH)</p>
<p>Neteller</p>
<p>Online bank transfer</p>
<p>Skrill</p>
<p>Withdrawals</p>
<p>You can withdraw your money quickly by either visiting the Tropicana Casino in Atlantic City or picking from a number of remote payout methods, such as ACH, Check by Email, Neteller, and Skrill. The standard processing time is three business days, but it could take up to 10 days for a check to arrive, so keep this in mind.</p>
<p>Virgin Mobile Casino App</p>
<p>Virgin Casino brings you a dedicated mobile experience with all games and website features built using HTML5. The software makes it easy to access and browse the casino from any Android and Apple device, adding value to your gameplay experience.</p>
<p>Thanks to two dedicated apps available on the website, as well as on Google Play and Apple Store, you can further enhance your experience by using a dedicated app, which is readily available for download and can make your sessions a little more immersive.</p>
<p>Regardless of what mobile option you pick, you will have access to an intuitive and quick platform. Bank options and games will be readily available, and you will find the layout deeply satisfying and be able to play 24/7.</p>
