<p>The Responsible Gaming (RG) certification secured by NeoGames confirms that the operator met the responsible gaming standards set by the WLA for providers of lottery services and solutions.</p>
<p>NeoGames Meets WLA RG Standards</p>
<p>Ultimately, the Association’s RG certification seeks to reduce the impact and risks of problem gambling. To complete the RG certification, the iLottery operations from NeoGames went through an assessment. The process was completed by an independent monitor who sought to determine whether the company’s operations comply fully with the WLA standards for responsible gambling.</p>
<p>The assessment was completed within multiple different verticals including the evaluation of advertising and marketing communications, employee programs and research. Service and product development, as well as reporting and remote gaming environments, were also probed as a part of the assessment. Finally, the independent evaluation concluded that NeoGames’ operations and platform comply fully with the RG framework set by the WLA.</p>
<p>“The WLA is pleased to officially recognize NeoGames’ adherence to WLA Responsible Gaming Guidelines for suppliers, highlighting their corporate social responsibility practices and attesting that player protection is a core aspect of their operations.“ Mélissa Azam, CSR senior manager at the World Lottery Association</p>
<p>Mélissa Azam, the World Lottery Association’s CSR senior manager, shared her excitement about the latest announcement. She revealed that the Association is delighted to see that NeoGames’ iLottery operations comply with the RG requirements for lottery operators. Finally, Azam said that the certification reaffirms the company’s commitment to protecting players and adhering to corporate social responsibility policies.</p>
<p>The Certification Brings Excitement to NeoGames</p>
<p>Moti Malul, NeoGames’ CEO, was similarly excited about the RG certification from the WLA. He pointed out that the certification confirms the company’s compliance with the industry standards that seek to safeguard the consumers. Finally, Malul said: “Responsible gaming is deeply rooted in every facet of NeoGames’ operations, from our products to our services and our employees, this certification confirms our continued commitment to being a responsible iLottery supplier.”</p>
<p>“We are proud to have qualified for Responsible Gaming certification by the WLA, recognizing its importance to our customers and the demand for alignment with industry standards.“ Moti Malul, CEO at NeoGames</p>
<p>The recent certification marks a major milestone for the company. What’s more, the announcement comes on the heels of major collaborations that helped expand NeoGames’ presence. Back in October, the company joined forces with BetMGM in Michigan. Expanding its presence in the US, NeoGames agreed to provide the betting and gaming brand with leading iGaming solutions.</p>
