<p>The globally recognized gaming company, International Game Technology (IGT), announced a US-facing partnership extension, strengthening its growing presence in the regulated gambling market in the country. The company confirmed Monday it extended its existing partnership with the Rhode Island Lottery, the state agency that offers different gambling games including scratch-offs, lottery, iLottery and sports betting.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the new deal, the Lottery will continue to benefit from IGT's leading sports betting solutions. As a result, IGT PlaySports and William Hill US, its commercial partner, will power the Rhode Island Lottery's sports betting operations.</p>
<p>Thanks to the new three-year contract extension, William Hill US and IGT PlaySports will power statewide sports betting via the Lottery's Sportsbook Rhode Island app. Additionally, the duo will continue to supply technology and solutions for retail sportsbook locations at Bally's Tiverton Casino &amp; Hotel and Bally's Twin River Lincoln Casino Resort.</p>
<p>Joe Asher, IGT's President of Sports Betting, shared his excitement about the latest announcement in a statement released on April 10, 2023. He explained that the Lottery in Rhode Island was one of the first to introduce sports betting following PASPA's repeal. Moreover, Asher said that IGT is excited to continue to power the Lottery's sports betting operations and help it continue to grow.</p>
<p>He explained: "Rhode Island is home to very loyal sports fans who love following their New England-based teams." Finally, Asher said: "The enhancements IGT has made to the Lottery's sports betting platform and app provide fans with a convenient and intuitive player experience and yield strong returns that support the Lottery's commitment to generating revenue for good causes."</p>
<p>Besides powering the sports betting technology via PlaySports, IGT also has a partnership with the Rhode Island Lottery involving lottery products. Currently, the company is the exclusive supplier of instant tickets, iLottery, lottery, as well as video lottery services and solutions to the Lottery.</p>
<p>Mark Furcolo, Rhode Island Lottery's Director, said about the partnership extension: "As one of the first US lotteries to launch sports betting, Rhode Island Lottery is very pleased with the successful program we have built over the last five years, backed by IGT's world-class technology and William Hill's operator experience."</p>
<p>He explained that IGT recently made a significant investment in its sports betting platform and mobile app. Finally, Furcolo acknowledged: "These upgrades will enable us to maximize revenue and offer a solution that remains competitive among neighboring states in this dynamic, regional sports betting market."</p>
