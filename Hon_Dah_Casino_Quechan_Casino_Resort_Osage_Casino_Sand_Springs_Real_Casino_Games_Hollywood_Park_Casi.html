    <h1>Hon Dah Casino Quechan Casino Resort Osage Casino Sand Springs Real Casino Games Hollywood Park Casi</h1>

<p>I have deposited through a drink, a master card which is my own and a debit visa card which is my husband's. I have the aibans on both cards I can attach them as well as his ID card and mine. And he has a profile in palms. Bg. And he had written to them that I had deposited with his card. Both his and mine are verified. There is no third deposit card. I deposit only with these 2 cards and drink. I can send you debit cards, ID cards and bank accounts of both cards. My account is still locked in palms.bg. I thought that when my husband's card was verified, I could deposit it again. My last deposit that was accepted was through paypay. Before that I tried to recharge my account with my personal master card but I had no money in it and I recharged via e-pay. And they are trying to convince me that exactly my last deposit was made with another card. They can accept a deposit but cannot pay the money. Why didn't they lock my Account when I made the deposit and refused to accept my deposit. It is already clear to me that I will not see anything from them. At least only the deposit of BGN 30. To give me back. For 3 days in a row I send them an email with debit cards, bank accounts and ID cards. I write to them in a private chat and they answer me that my account is locked for an indefinite period of time and again they try to convince me that the deposit was made with someone else's card and for that it is locked I have violated the law. me to talk to them my husband to talk to them and I can give his number but no one called. They can check in the past how I deposited with what I deposited. They can check if some time ago and now I have sent a verification of the documents. I want them to apply them, I want them to tell me that my last deposit is with someone else's 3rd card, which is a master card ending in 3033, is mine personally.</p>
