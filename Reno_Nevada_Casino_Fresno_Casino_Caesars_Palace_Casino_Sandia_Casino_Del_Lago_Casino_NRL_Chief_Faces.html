    <h1>Reno Nevada Casino Fresno Casino Caesars Palace Casino Sandia Casino Del Lago Casino NRL Chief Faces</h1>

<p>The Australian Rugby League Commission chair and chief executive of Racing New South Wales Peter V'landys, who is currently in Las Vegas to advance talks on the NRL's expansion plans, referred to sports gambling as "entertainment" and compared it to going out for a meal</p>
<p>Peter V’landys is facing widespread criticism for these recent comments defending the National Rugby League’s (NRL) foray into the sports gambling market.</p>
<p>Recovering Addict Slams V’landys for Dismissing Devastating Impact of Gambling</p>
<p>V’landys’ remarks have drawn the ire of public health experts and individuals who have struggled with gambling addiction. Many argue that major sporting leagues, including the NRL, have become vehicles for promoting and normalizing gambling, thereby exacerbating the societal harm caused by the industry.</p>
<p>One recovering addict, Mark Kempster, expressed his outrage at V’landys’ comments, calling them “disgusting” and highlighting the devastating impact of gambling on individuals and families, reported The Guardian. Kempster, who had lost approximately AUD100,000 ($67,885) to sports betting, spoke from personal experience, emphasizing that for most people, gambling is far from entertainment.</p>
<p>Prof Samantha Thomas, a gambling and public health expert at Deakin University, criticized V’landys’ perspective, stating that sporting organizations have a responsibility to prioritize the health and social well-being of the community.</p>
<p>While V’landys has rejected claims that the NRL’s future is dependent on gambling revenue, Tim Costello, the chief advocate of the alliance for gambling reform, expressed his concern over V’landys’ intent to further entrench the league with the gambling industry. Costello described V’landys’ approach as appalling, particularly given the harm caused by gambling within the community.</p>
<p>Debate Rages as NRL Pursues Sports Gambling for Financial Gain</p>
<p>Despite the criticism, V’landys remains steadfast in his position. He sees the expansion into the sports gambling market as an opportunity to generate additional revenue for the NRL through broadcast subscriptions and partnerships with wagering operators. V’landys believes that if fans are betting on the games, they will be more inclined to subscribe to the broadcast.</p>
<p>The NRL’s plans to launch the 2024 season with two showcase games in Las Vegas have attracted support from Australia’s biggest sports gambling companies, who anticipate significant financial gains from increased broadcast fees, sponsorship deals, and gambling revenue. However, critics argue that the potential monetary benefits should not outweigh the potential harm caused by normalizing gambling within the NRL and the wider community.</p>
<p>As discussions and negotiations continue, it remains to be seen how the NRL will navigate the complex and contentious issue of its involvement with the sports gambling industry. The controversy surrounding V’landys’ comments serves as a reminder of the ongoing debate surrounding the intersection of sports, entertainment, and the promotion of responsible gambling practices.</p>
