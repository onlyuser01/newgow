<p>Secure and licensed</p>
<p>Ignition Poker is one of the newest US cardrooms opened in 2016 and brings a variety of opportunities to true poker players. The website is a part of the PaiWangLuo Network, an ecosystem in itself, and previously operated under the Bodog brand. Ignition Poker is geared towards American players exclusively and operates in nearly all US states.</p>
<p>Some states are an exception as Ignition Poker complies with local regulations and is not currently available to players in New York, New Jersey, Maryland, Delaware, and Nevada. These restrictions haven’t stopped Ignition from soaring to the top of the US player traffic and currently holds first place in terms of total players.</p>
<p>Having a vibrant community helps establish a range of skill and budget levels, keeping the entry-level low and most games soft, but also creating competition at the highest level for anyone looking to take their poker experience to the next level and win some real money.</p>
<p>Our Ignition Poker review explores the cardroom in detail and how Ignition Poker made it to the top of the US poker pecking order.</p>
<p>Ignition Poker Pros and Cons</p>
<p>Ignition Poker is proud to offer some of the most intuitive poker solutions American players can enjoy. While USA poker sites tend to be a little scarce, Ignition has stepped in to fill the space with a quality poker product that offers a variety of tournaments, growth options, and more. Let’s take a look at our overview of the pros and cons.</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<p>Highest poker traffic in the USA</p>
<p>Engaging Android and iOS mobile software</p>
<p>A 150% deposit bonus of up to $1,500 for US players</p>
<p>Web-based poker software for instant play</p>
<p>Accepts cryptocurrency and FIAT banking methods</p>
<p>Some of the fastest Bitcoin withdrawals</p>
<p>A dedicated offline software compatible with Mac and Windows</p>
<p>Live chat and 24/7 customer support available</p>
<p>Plenty of similarly-matched players to play against</p>
<p>A trusted brand name that guarantees the safety of your money</p>
<p>Cons:</p>
<p>No official licenses from a regulatory authority</p>
<p>Still some mixed opinions in the community</p>
<p>Is Ignition Poker Rigged?</p>
<p>Ignition Poker isn’t rigged. The website doesn’t have a license, but this hasn’t stopped the brand from establishing itself as a trusted operator in the USA. The card room is officially based in Costa Rica, which gives it some legal leeway to operate freely under current US laws in the majority of the states.</p>
<p>The only exception is the states that have explicitly asked to be excluded and Ignition has complied, i.e. New York, New Jersey, Maryland, Delaware, and Nevada. Other than that, Ignition is a safe and trusted cardroom.</p>
<p>Ignition Poker isn’t rigged nor can it be with thousands of players participating in multi-million tournaments and keeping a keen eye on all hands and discussing the website freely on community portals, such as Reddit and Cards Chat.</p>
<p>While a few years back, players could argue against Ignition Poker based on its novelty, today the brand has proven itself as a go-to online poker venue in the USA.</p>
<p>Ignition Poker Welcome Bonus</p>
<p>Ignition Poker offers a handy welcome bonus you will enjoy as soon as you enter the website. Players may pick from FIAT and Bitcoin deposit options to activate the Ignition bonus. The bonuses apply to both the casino and poker, and you can choose either. In the case of the card room, the bonus is matched by 150% up to $1,500 when you deposit with Bitcoin.</p>
<p>For FIAT deposits, the bonus amount is 100% up to $1,000. Both promotions are easy to claim as all you need to do is set up your poker account and click on the claim bonus funds. To unlock the poker bonus, you will need to start earning Ignition Miles, which are generated automatically as you join cash games and bet real money.</p>
<p>The poker bonus is unlocked in increments of $1 for every 30 Ignition Miles you earn through regular play. The bonus is credited directly to your cash balance and you can cash it out or continue playing with it if you prefer.</p>
<p>You have 30 days to unlock the full amount of the bonus before it becomes inactive and any unlocked funds are automatically forfeited.</p>
<p>Ignition Miles and How to Get Them</p>
<p>As explained before, Ignition Miles are awarded for every bet you place. You will receive a different number of Ignition Miles based on the amount and type of game you bet on. Here is a quick and handy breakdown:</p>
<p>15 Ignition Miles per 1 dollar of tournament fees</p>
<p>15 Ignition Miles per 1 dollar of cash games rake</p>
<p>1.5 Ignition Miles per dollar of buy-in for Jackpot Sit &amp; Go’s</p>
<p>Cash Games and Ignition Miles tend to be the two best choices you can make</p>
<p>Ignition Poker Tournaments and Freerolls</p>
<p>Sporting the biggest traffic in the United States, Ignition Poker has been able to show some breadth of the experience. The Ignition Poker tournaments are one of the biggest draws of the card room. The schedule is busy and it features a distinct selection of competitive poker opportunities that US players will certainly appreciate.</p>
<p>Tournaments run daily and they feature varying buy-ins and cash prizes. Players have attested that Ignition Poker has some of the best tourneys US players can find. You will get to choose from competitive events such as the:</p>
<p>Super Millions Poker Open</p>
<p>Jackpot Sit &amp; Go’s Tournaments</p>
<p>Sit-and-Go Tournaments</p>
<p>$150K Guaranteed Poker Tournaments</p>
<p>$2M Guaranteed Week</p>
<p>Mad Monday Tournaments</p>
<p>Wild Wednesday</p>
<p>The dynamic of the competitive events change quickly and it ultimately offers true poker fans an opportunity to enjoy themselves and win serious real money playing online poker. Some players cite Ignition as their favorite websites because of the low stakes for tourneys and Sit &amp; Go’s.</p>
<p>The tournaments will usually unfold at a pre-determined pace, but players agree that Ignition Poker allows you to play more hands per hour than other platforms in the United States. The events themselves will be available in every popular version of the game, including Pot Limit Omaha Hi/Lo, No Limit Texas Hold’em, and Pot Limit Omaha.</p>
<p>To get a good read of all current and upcoming events, you can just go to Tournament Schedule which is updated in real-time and offers a quick way to see what events are coming up next.</p>
<p>Ignition Poker Deposits and Withdrawals</p>
<p>Ignition Poker offers a great mix of FIAT and cryptocurrency payment options which make it easy for any US player to deposit, and more importantly – withdrawal. Presently, American poker aficionados can choose from a selection of banking methods.</p>
<p>How to Make a Deposit at Ignition Poker</p>
<p>Method Min Max Fees Success Rate Visa, MasterCard $25 $1,500 No fees 80-90% Bitcoin $25 $5,000 No fees 100%</p>
<p>Once you have set up your account, it’s time to make your first deposit. You can pick from several established options, including Visa, Mastercard, and Bitcoin. The minimum deposit amount you can place is $25 and the maximum amount you can deposit is $5,000.</p>
<p>Deposits are instant, allowing for a quick turnout and enabling players from the USA to play almost instantly after registering their accounts. There are no fees associated with deposits, so players can move their money around quickly.</p>
<p>All banking methods are safe and they offer the same level of convenience. MasterCard deposits may bounce sometimes, but Visa tends to clear through with a near 100% success rate.</p>
<p>How to Withdraw at Ignition Poker</p>
<p>To withdraw, you can rely on a number of pre-select payment methods, including Check, Bank Wire, and most notably Bitcoin. Once again, cryptocurrencies offer a quick and intuitive way of cashing out.</p>
<p>Method Min Max Fees Withdrawal Time Check $100 $3,000 $50 7 business days Bank Wires $1,500 $9,500 $50 + percentage 7-14 business days Bitcoin $25 $9,500 No fees &lt;24 hours</p>
<p>Withdrawals at Ignition Poker are no hassle at all. However, it helps immensely if players know what to expect in some detail. For example, you can request a Check withdrawal only if you have the minimum balance for it, i.e. $100. There always is a fee associated to check withdrawals, and it makes more sense to wait until you have won more.</p>
<p>Bank Wires have a long processing time, but they always arrive safely in your account, and many US players prefer to use this payment option as it’s both time-tested and provenly safe.</p>
<p>Naturally, Bitcoin is designed to be the most intuitive payment option, allowing you to benefit from a flexible banking method no matter what state you reside in.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that Ignition allows you to make around 3 payouts per month, but this should be plenty already.</p>
<p>Ignition Poker Download Software</p>
<p>Ignition Poker has a high-grade downloadable software that works with both Windows and Mac and allows for a slightly more immersive experience. If you love to grind games and want to have a more fulfilling experience, the poker suite is the right call for you.</p>
<p>Ignition works well with both Mac and Windows and allows you to play for real money from your desktop PC or Apple station. You will have access to the exact same features as you would from the instant play browser version or even mobile platform.</p>
<p>The poker website bets big on continuity and offering an omnichannel experience to give poker players the most in-depth experience. You can sit down and play at 15 tables simultaneously and enjoy 24/7 access to cash games.</p>
<p>Customer support is available around the clock and you can join any of the multi-million tournaments or $150K GTD tourneys. The software platform makes it easy to focus on the games and improve your play.</p>
<p>Does Ignition Poker Have an App?</p>
<p>Ignition Poker doesn’t offer a dedicated Android or iOS app. Nevertheless, you can play directly in your smartphone or tablet browser, enjoying the exact same experience as you would on any of the other platforms offered by Ignition. Players can have a fulfilling session and access the banking options, customer support, and tournaments. Some US players do love to play on the go, and Ignition is a perfect fit.</p>
<p>Ignition Poker Reddit Overview</p>
<p>One of the best ways to inform yourself about a poker brand is not by reading a review, as it turns out. Reddit and Cards Chat comments tend to be a trove of player opinions. Now, just because they are player opinions, it doesn’t mean there isn’t quite a bit of biased going both ways.</p>
<p>Some players who have had a string of bad beats often suspect foul play. Upon testing and examining Ignition Poker for our review, we simply concluded that Ignition Poker simply allows you to play more hands per hour than most other card rooms.</p>
<p>Players on both platforms have generally agreed that Ignition Poker has the best tournaments in terms of prize pools and technical execution. When it comes to cash games, it’s hard not to find around 800 players consistently participating on all buy-in levels.</p>
<p>Some players have called attention to the lack of license, but operating for close to four years now, Ignition Poker has been able to establish a sizeable footprint in the US poker community and more importantly, a reputation.</p>
