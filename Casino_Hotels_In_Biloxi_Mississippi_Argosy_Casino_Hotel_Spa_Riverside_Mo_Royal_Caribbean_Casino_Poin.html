<p>Incode, a company that specializes in the use of artificial intelligence to improve Identity Verification and Authentication, has signed a new deal in the gambling sector. Incode has transformed itself into an established leader for a number of industries that need crucial and highly-sensitive KYC, KYB, Age Verification, AML, and Passwordless Authentication, and it’s now bringing its comprehensive solutions to the gambling sector.</p>
<p>The latest partnership features MaxBet, a company that offers both sports betting and iGaming products, and that is one of the biggest operators in Eastern Europe. The partnership will have a significant impact on MaxBet’s operations as it would enable the company to come better prepared for the ever-changing regulatory and consumer landscape, with Incode facilitating a range of crucial processes and ensuring that there is no room for error.</p>
<p>Incode has a system that allows it to verify 4,600 different types of documents quickly and impeccably, which only takes seconds. The speed of this solution and its accuracy are quickly becoming a staple for the iGaming industry with MaxBet among the companies and early adopters to realize the importance of such solutions.</p>
<p>Incode focuses on both the onboarding stages – which require KYC and Age Verification checks, but also follows through with other solutions that are needed throughout a customer’s lifecycle with the platform, and thus ensures a robust and safe framework that will continually provide MaxBet with everything it needs to make the company’s overall product solid.</p>
<p>Commenting on this new opportunity Incode Technologies CEO and Founder Ricardo Amper welcomed the opportunity to see his company work with one of the most prominent operators in Europe. MaxBet is set to revolutionize the way it interacts with customers and how it guarantees that high industry standards are met.</p>
<p>"Working with one of Eastern Europe’s leading operators is a proud moment for the business. Incode’s biometric, Integrated Identity platform allows MaxBet to manage user identity journeys from onboarding and verification to orchestration and analytics all within a single platform," Amper added.</p>
<p>The news was similarly welcome by MaxBet Online Director Ninoslav Lazarević who said that his company has long realized the importance of a seamless identity verification process – not just in Serbia but also in the region. With the addition of Incode’s platform to MaxBet, the operator is ready to take on new challenges in the motley and disparate gaming landscape in the region.</p>
