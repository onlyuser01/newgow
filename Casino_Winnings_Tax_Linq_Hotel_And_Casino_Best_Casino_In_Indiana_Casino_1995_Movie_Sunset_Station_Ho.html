<p>Gambling.com Appoints Bergh as CSO</p>
<p>Gambling.com Group is reinforcing its executive lineup with the addition of Johannes Bergh as the company’s new chief strategy officer (CSO). Bergh will oversee Gambling.com’s expansion as it ramps up its growth strategy in multiple markets venturing out of its traditional bastions.</p>
<p>Bergh is a seasoned veteran with experience in Catena Media Plc where he worked as chief operations officer (COO) from January 2017 through July 2020. Under his direction, Catena was able to bring innovation to its products and integrate with new and challenging markets.</p>
<p>He brought up revenue to speed and, in 2019, Catena posted €103 million up from €40 million in 2016 from before he took the post. Gambling.com is confident that Bergh is the right pick for the job citing his expertise with performance marketing verticals in the industry.</p>
<p>According to Gambling.com CEO Charles Gillespie, Bergh is a top-pick for the company citing his vast experience. Gillespie has worked with Bergh in the past and he considers it fortunate to be able to do so once again at a time that is pivotal for the company.</p>
<p>Bergh will operate out of Dublin, Ireland, and he will focus on international websites and make sure that new growth markets are explored and pursued. The executive was keen to share his thoughts on the occasion of his appointment, praising Gambling.com Group’s expertise and its recent forays in the United States, among others.</p>
<p>“I am excited to bring my experience to the team and help the company grow in new markets such as the United States,” Bergh concluded.</p>
