<p>Wynn Las Vegas table game dealers will be joining the United Automobile, Aerospace, and Agricultural Implement Workers of America labor union through a unanimously agreed-on three-year deal.</p>
<p>The UAW Deal Will Improve the Work Conditions for Dealers</p>
<p>According to the dealers’ spokesperson, Kanie Kastroll, over 96% of them have voted in favor of joining the UAW, although no exact vote count was officially revealed.</p>
<p>“Union members deserve a contract that honors and respects our long years of loyalty and excellent service. The members have just secured that workers’ contract, and the peace of mind that comes with it, overwhelmingly,” the representative announced.</p>
<p>The new contract will ensure various benefits to the casino workers. One of the most notable ones is that under the UAW agreement, the Wynn Las Vegas table game dealers get to keep their tips and cannot have them forcefully taken away. This is a huge win for the employees as for a long time, Wynn Resorts’ usual policy has been that workers have to share 12 percent of the tips with their higher-ups.</p>
<p>This rule was originally established by Steve Wynn, Wynn Resorts’ founder himself, and has been a subject of various critiques and even lawsuits throughout the years. Both in 2013 and 2018, the case was taken to court.</p>
<p>In March, these disputes finally calmed down as Wynn Resorts agreed to reimburse current and former workers for the tips they had taken away. The company paid a total of $5.6 million to end the lawsuit, with each of the 1000 protesting dealers receiving around $4,170.</p>
<p>The monetary benefit of getting to keep their tips isn’t the only perk for the dealers. As members of the UAW, the dealers will experience a major relief to their shifts. According to the deal, the workers will now be working for a maximum of 60 minutes (previously 80) before taking a break for 20 minutes.</p>
<p>Supporting Workers’ Rights</p>
<p>Despite its name, the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America labor union has grown much outside of its original target demographics and currently covers many other industries. Just in the gambling sector, in Las Vegas, the UAW has a presence in Bally’s, Caesars Palace, Flamingo, Harrah’s, and MGM Grand.</p>
<p>Outside of LA, the UAW labor union has dealt with gambling operators in Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, and Ohio and represents the rights of over 10 thousand gambling workers.</p>
<p>Although the UAW will focus on dealers, other supportive roles in the gambling industry, such as staff, housekeepers, bartenders, and chefs, have their rights supported by the Culinary Union.</p>
