<p>The rules about the documents needed for verification prior to processing a withdrawal request can be found in the casino's Terms and Conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When verifying your account you must provide the following documents:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>copy of your passport or driver’s license in color with valid expiration date;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>copy of the credit/debit card in color that was used to replenish the balance (both sides). It is necessary to hide the middle 8 digits of the card and the CVV code</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>screenshot of your bank account with the following information:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bank account number / IBAN</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bank ID / BIC</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>screenshot of your electronic wallet, that was used to replenish the balance (with wallet number and personal data page)</p>

<p>if necessary, your selfie with a passport or driver’s license in hand</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>We may occasionally request additional information or details regarding any deposit made by you.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To ensure a secure and lawful gambling environment, the casino may request a copy of all payment methods used for depositing into your account. This procedure is in place to prevent money laundering and illegal activities. The casino's primary goal is to ensure that funds are disbursed to the rightful owner. We strongly advise players to provide the personal information requested by the casino before requesting a withdrawal. While we understand that this verification process may cause temporary inconvenience, it is typically a one-time requirement. Subsequent withdrawals should proceed more smoothly once the initial verification is complete.</p>
<p>Could you please advise how long have you been playing in the casino and how many payment methods have you used? Thank you.</p>
