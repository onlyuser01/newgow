    <h1>Best Online Casino Payouts Draftkings Casino Michigan L Auberge Casino Resort Lake Charles Avenue L</h1>

<p>ESA Gaming, a leader in the development of innovative content for the online gaming industry, has appointed a new head of game production</p>
<p>Moving forward, Josefin Uppeke will take over the new position as she helps the studio expand on its current development pace and focus. Uppeke is no chance of hiring either, sporting a significant industry experience herself.</p>
<p>ESA Gaming Boosts Production with New Talent</p>
<p>The addition of Uppeke is an important step forward as the company seeks to strengthen its production pace and line, and the new hire is uniquely qualified to do just that. Previously, Uppeke worked at Lucksome where she was the head of creative and game designer.</p>
<p>She also has experience working for some of the industry’s biggest studios, among which are Yggdrasil and NetEnt. Uppeke will be directly responsible for the EasySwipe portfolio, which is a new game series built on an extremely lightweight but powerful platform that allows them to appear on markets where connectivity may be an issue or not as well developed.</p>
<p>The EasySwipe portfolio has a heavy focus on mobile slots and crash games, and the company is expecting to see no fewer than 12 titles appear in this category in 2023. ESA Gaming is confident that Uppeke will add a lot to the overall development process and help the company push through in the European and African regions. Commenting on her appointment, Uppeke had this to say:</p>
<p>With plenty of new markets entered and the potential of its EasySwipe portfolio evident across regulated territories, I’m eager to get started and play my part in producing fantastic games for players to enjoy. ESA Gaming head of game production Josefin Uppeke</p>
<p>ESA Gaming head of marketing Thomas Smallwood was equally pleased to welcome Uppeke on board and said that her addition was an important step forward for the entire organization. Recently, BetBonanza signed a partnership with ESA Gaming, gaining access to the supplier’s products for its Nigerian operations.</p>
