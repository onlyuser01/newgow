<p>International Masters of Gaming Law (IMGL), the not-for-profit association comprising of more than 340 leading experts in worldwide jurisdictions involved in “most gambling sector developments and issues”, launched today a brand new magazine dedicated to gaming law.</p>
<p>Wide Range of Issues</p>
<p>IMGL Magazine replaces previous jurisdiction-related magazines and tackles issues such as loot boxes, mobile sports betting, UK Gambling Act 2005 review, fantasy sports, Indian and African regulation, and others in its first edition, in which North America features prominently.</p>
<p>“The IMGL Magazine sits alongside IMGL Masterclasses, Regional Conferences, Semi- Annual Conferences, including virtual conferences to offer the broadest array of educational opportunities in the gaming sector. The IMGL has and will continue to address the most timely (and sometimes the most challenging) issues in the global gaming industry.” Marc Ellinger, President, IMGL</p>
<p>North America</p>
<p>Developments in New York State and Hawaii and regulation of loot boxes in Canada are the three North American issues the magazine which brings together articles from authors residing on 5 continents addresses in its first edition.</p>
<p>“This first edition sets the standard for what will be a truly worldwide publication with global authorship and readership interested in gaming law. Gaming law issues, which arise in one jurisdiction, are often reminiscent of the discussions in another.” Simon Planzer, Editor in Chief, IMGL Magazine</p>
<p>Europe, Asia, and Australia</p>
<p>The debut edition of the IMGL Magazine focuses on several ongoing developments in Europe, including the opinion of the European Gaming and Betting Association on data flows in Europe post-Brexit, as well as an update on the ongoing review of the Gambling Act 2005 in the UK.</p>
<p>Asia is covered by an exploration of fantasy sports in India, Africa features a route map for regulation, while the New South Wales casino inquiry is the topic from Australia.</p>
<p>“In the IMGL Magazine, you will find high quality scholarly articles with equally high practical relevance from the four corners of the gaming world.” Simon Planzer, Editor in Chief, IMGL Magazine</p>
<p>The quarterly digital publication will be available to both members and non-members of the IMGL via partnerships with SBC Gaming, Clarion Gaming and the National Council of Legislators from gaming states. Its second edition is scheduled for the summer and Canada’s single-event sports betting legalization is likely to take center stage.</p>
