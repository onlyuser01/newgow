<p>We are stoked about the upcoming UFC Vegas 37 event as the Ultimate Fighting Championship has once again made sure to shortlist dozens of distinct fighters who will bring their A-game to the octagon at the UFC Apex in Las Vegas, Nevada this Saturday, September 18.</p>
<p>One of the preliminary card fights to keep your eyes peeled for is the bout between Montel Jackson and JP Buys. Posted at (-650), Jackson seems locked to be a winner whereas Buys will be taking up the role of an underdog in the clash. Already hardened in the UFC, Montel has a tremendous advantage over his opponent, but we should not dismiss Buys just yet.</p>

<p>Tale of the Tape Jackson vs Buys</p>
<p>Montel Jackson Stats JP Buys 5′ 10″ Height 5′ 5″ 135 lbs Weight 135 lbs 75″ Reach 67″ Southpaw Stance Orthodox 10-2-0 Record 9-3-0</p>
<p>UFC Has Been Unkind to JP Buys</p>
<p>JP Buys is not a fighter whom you should underestimate. With an overall track record of 9-3-0, he has posted some great results. The trouble here is Buys is a bit of a UFC outsider. He debuted in 2017 and has had three finishes, two of which resulted in a loss. His only hard-fought win is against Jacob Silva who is another middling fighter at best.</p>
<p>Buys though has a grout grappling technique which could give him the upper hand in a close fight. Yet, with too little data to go on now, the bookmakers have Buys’ performance at (+475).</p>
<p>Jackson Is a Rising Star in the UFC</p>
<p>Jackson’s overall record isn’t too different with ten wins and two losses. The difference here is that he has fought exclusively in the UFC which gives him a solid foothold in the promotion so far. In fact, Jackson has stacked up quite a few wins. He has only lost twice since he started fighting with a total of seven finishes.</p>
<p>His last fight against Jesse Strader was a success, completing it in 1:58. But even when he lost to Brett Johns before that in July 2020, Jackson went the distance for a fight-minute fight that was won by Unanimous Decision. He is not too rushed to bring in a win which is fine, but he has the qualities to outlast JP Buys in this one.</p>
<p>The only way Buys might win here is if he throws a surprise upset via KO/TKO which would be much unexpected. This fight should however finish within 2 rounds if you are interested in the totals. For the moneyline, we would suggest sticking with Jackson if you see any value in that.</p>
