<p>Information about ecoVoucher casinos</p>
<p>ecoVoucher is a prepaid payment method which is part of the same network of services as ecoPayz. It allows customers to make online payments in cash through buying a PIN from a bricks-and-mortar vendor, then entering it online in exchange for goods or services.</p>
<p>One of these services is playing on an online casino, and many ecoVoucher casinos support ecoPayz's voucher system as a payment method.</p>
<p>This article aims to show you how to find the best ecoVoucher casino, how to make an ecoVoucher deposit, the pros and cons of using this service, as well as how to find bonuses offered by these sites.</p>

<p>ecoVoucher – a convenient way of paying for online goods in cash</p>
<p>ecoVoucher first hit the market in February 2015 as an alternative to Ecocard's (now known as ecoPayz) prepaid card and digital wallet. Like ecoPayz, ecoVoucher is a trading name of PSI-Pay Ltd, a UK-based company regulated by the Financial Services Authority (FSA).</p>
<p>The concept of ecoVoucher appealed to a demographic of online users who preferred the security of paying in cash. They didn't need to share any bank details or open a new account: they just went to an ecoVoucher-affiliated store, paid the required amount in cash, and received a PIN in return. They then entered this number into the website they wanted to purchase from when they got home.</p>
<p>The appeal of ecoVoucher has extended far beyond its UK origin. By February 2020, it was available in the EU, Latin America, Africa, and Asia. Its website lists the following companies with ecoVoucher-friendly outlets:</p>
<p>Dundle</p>
<p>OffGamers</p>
<p>Voucher Webshop</p>
<p>Gueez</p>
<p>Common concerns about online security means that demand for prepaid cash vouchers like ecoVoucher is still high today. Thousands of outlets around the world offer the service, and it remains a popular choice for online casino players.</p>
<p>The pros and cons of ecoVoucher</p>
<p>Security is at the heart of ecoVoucher's service, and we'd call this the biggest advantage of using it. You don't have to share any banking info or personal information at any point: you simply pay for the PIN and enter it online. The one flaw to this plan is that you could lose the PIN, of course. If this happens, then it would effectively be the same as losing the cash equivalent, unless the store kindly issues you with another voucher.</p>
<p>ecoVoucher is extremely simple to use. All of us have bought stuff in a bricks-and-mortar store before, and entering 18 digits into a computer is hardly rocket science.</p>
<p>Another nice advantage of ecoVoucher is that it's free. The service makes its money through charging vendors commission for each sale.</p>
<p>On the negative side, ecoVouchers are only available in amounts up to $/€/£150, and users can use one voucher per transaction. For purchases higher than this number, ecoVoucher recommends using ecoPayz, which can handle higher amounts. This limit is pretty restrictive: surely this method is better for larger transactions as the user has personal control over his or her money?</p>
<p>It's also important to remember that ecoVoucher is only available in the three currencies mentioned: the US dollar, the Euro, and the British Pound. While these are three major tenders, they might not appeal to a lot of people, particularly in Latin America, Asia, and Africa, who prefer to use local money when paying in cash.</p>
<p>Finding the best ecoCard casino for you</p>
<p>ecoVoucher is available to use in many online casinos, with transactions taking just a couple of minutes once you have the PIN. Before you make a deposit, though, you'll need to find a trustworthy casino that treats players well and contributes to a great playing experience.</p>
<p>Casino Guru wants to help you find the best casinos possible, which is why we created an elaborate review and rating system. Our team has assessed ecoVoucher casinos to make sure they are up to scratch, and each one has received a special Safety Index. This rating is based on the following objective factors:</p>
<p>The number of complaints it has received</p>
<p>The size of the casino</p>
<p>The quality of related casinos</p>
<p>Points earned for positive qualities</p>
<p>Points deducted for bad behavior.</p>
<p>You can then find the ecoVoucher sites with the best ratings by clicking the 'Recommended' tab at the top of the page. We advise you to start with these on your casino search.</p>
<p>That said, some new casinos could be stars of the future; they just haven't had time to forge a reputation for themselves yet. Clicking the 'Newly opened' tab will show you the latest ecoVoucher-friendly sites.</p>
<p>You can also subject the list of casinos to other factors by using the extra filters further down the page. You may want to see casinos that offer games by a certain developer. Authentic Gaming and Booongo, for example, are popular with players, and you can find both of these by clicking their boxes in the 'Game provider' section.</p>
<p>Note: Other filters include sorting casinos by their language, mobile-friendliness, and whether they accept cryptocurrencies, so we recommend you take a look through these to get the best results possible.</p>
<p>How to make an ecoVoucher casino deposit</p>
<p>Once you've found your ideal ecoVoucher casino and signed up, then you'll want to know how to deposit money using this method.</p>
<p>The good news is that it's extremely simple and safe. Just do the following:</p>
<p>Go to an ecoVoucher-affiliated store and buy an ecoVoucher to the value of your desired casino deposit. Visit the casino's cashier page and choose 'ecoVoucher' on the list of payment options in the 'Deposit method' section. Enter the 18-digit PIN on your voucher when the payment screen appears. If correct, the voucher amount should appear in your casino balance immediately.</p>
<p>If you don't see the funds in there after a few minutes, then we recommend you contact ecoVoucher or your casino, both of which should have a customer service team available to help.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the nature of ecoVoucher makes it impossible to withdraw money from your casino. You'll have to use another payment method to do this.</p>
<p>ecoVoucher casino bonuses</p>
<p>If you've scanned down the page to find casino bonuses, then you may be in luck.</p>
<p>Many ecoVoucher casinos offer bonuses, and you could be about to find some available in your region. Deposit bonuses are probably the most common: these are free credit or spins that you get in exchange for a deposit. No deposit bonuses are less frequent but getting a freebie for just registering your details is a nice way to try out a new casino.</p>
<p>Start your search by heading to our list of casino bonuses and selecting the 'ecoVoucher' box in the payment methods section. You can reduce these down to certain types, too, by selecting an option in the 'Bonus Type' section. For no deposit bonuses, for example, choose that option from the list. You can also see these by heading to our list of no deposit bonuses.</p>
<p>All these offers should be relevant as of today, thanks to the Casino Guru team's hard work in keeping them updated.</p>
