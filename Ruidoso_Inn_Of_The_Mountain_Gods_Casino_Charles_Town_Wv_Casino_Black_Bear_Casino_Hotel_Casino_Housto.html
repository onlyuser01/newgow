<p>Dear St3v13b and Gasino.Guru team,</p>
<p>Thank you for inviting us to this conversation, I hope you're well. My name is Sebastian and I will be looking into &amp; assisting with the matter.</p>
<p>After looking into the process, I am able give this summary of what has happened. Please note that the user account has been open again since 29/12/2020 and the customer has been able to log in multiple times afterwards, so the case appears has been resolved by now, as far as I understand. This summary is intended to provide clarity and peace of mind.</p>
<p>We requested KYC from the customer in the form of ID, Proof of Address and Proof of Deposit showing the deposit made on 18/12/2020 as there was a name mismatch in our system, this was requested on 19/12/2020. On the same day we had to reject a picture of ID which had some of its details covered, and Proof of Address for being too old to be valid by our standards. The proof of deposit had not been received at this point.</p>
<p>On 20/12/2020, the next ID had to be rejected, as the picture was blurry. New Proof of address was left pending until we received an explanation for the address mismatch we noticed on it. The bank statement sent in as Proof of Deposit was rejected due to the account holder's name not being visible. At this point ID, explanation for address mismatch in Proof of Address and Proof of Deposit for the deposit made on 18/12/2020 are still required.</p>
<p>On 22/12/2020 We received the same blurry photo of ID which we had already rejected, it was rejected again. We also rejected a bank statement, as it did not show the deposit made on 18/12/2020 as requested. At this point no explanation for address mismatch has been received.</p>
<p>On 23/12/2020 we received a valid picture of ID and a good explanation for address mismatch and were therefore able to approve the ID and Proof of Address. The bank statement received, however, did not contain the requested transaction information and was too unclear to be read properly, so it had to be rejected and re-requested.</p>
<p>On 24/12/2020 we had to reject Proof of Deposit, as it did not show the requested deposit.</p>
<p>On 25/12/2020 we had to reject Proof of Deposit, as it was a November statement and did not contain the deposit from 18/12/2020.</p>
<p>On 28/12/2020 we had to again reject a Proof of Deposit document, as it did not show the account holder's name and bank account details. At this stage we also noticed that the user had opened another account on Caxino earlier (which is a breach of our Terms and Conditions) and requested explanation as to why he did that, so we needed both the Proof of Deposit and an explanation for opening multiple accounts in order to verify the user and reopen the account.</p>
<p>On 29/12/2020 we received a valid Proof of Deposit and approved it, then later that day received an explanation and approved it. The KYC process was finished and account reopened. Hopefully this explanation helped.</p>
<p>I would like to use the chance to reassure that none of this was done in bad spirit nor was our intent ever to cause any undue effort or inconvenience to the player, but as a MGA-compliant casino operator we must be vigilant when it comes to KYC and user details in general.</p>
<p>If there are any further questions regarding the matter, I would be more than happy to answer them here. I wish both St3v13b and the Casino.Guru team a most pleasant weekend.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Sebastian</p>
