<p>Super Group (SGHC) Limited, a leading betting and gaming company, has recently announced the resignation of John Collins from its Board of Directors, effective 31 December 2023. Collins’s decision to step down relates to his investment in a National Hockey League (NHL) team. However, Super Group stressed that the two parties did not have any disagreements regarding the company’s practices.</p>
<p>The Departure Should Not Affect Current Operations</p>
<p>Collins is currently the chairman of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board and a member of the Audit Committee of the Board. Jonathan Jossel, who joined the company in May 2022, will take up the former position, ensuring Super Group can maintain its operations without disruptions.</p>
<p>Collins has been an integral part of Super Group’s growth and an influential figure during a year marked by significant development for the company. His departure comes at a time of impressive growth. In its recent third-quarter report, Super Group disclosed revenue of €356.9 million ($381.4 million), a notable 16% year-on-year increase.</p>
<p>The company attributed this growth to its expanding operations in Europe, North America, Africa, and the Middle East, despite declines in markets like South/Latin America and Asia-Pacific. Neal Menashe, CEO of Super Group, highlighted the remarkable third-quarter revenue, record monthly active customers, and predicted further expansion within the global iGaming sector for the company.</p>
<p>Collins Will Leverage His Sports Management Expertise</p>
<p>Collins’s decision to step down from his position on the Super Group board likely stems from his increasing focus on his interests within the NHL. He joined the New York Islanders ownership group in July 2023 as the Operating Partner for the Club. Collins’s rich history within the League shows his enduring dedication to the sport, and he will likely continue with his contributions.</p>
<p>Collins is more than qualified for his management position with the Islanders, drawing on his experience as COO of the National Hockey League, President and CEO of the Cleveland Browns, and a senior executive at the National Football League for fifteen seasons. He has been responsible for some pioneering developments within the NHL, and his business acumen will be invaluable to the team.</p>
<p>Collins’s decision to focus on his involvement in the NHL marks a transition for Super Group, which continues its trajectory of growth and expansion in the dynamic betting and gaming industry. While Super Group loses a seasoned industry veteran, it has the talent to ensure enduring success. Meanwhile, Collins is now free to pursue his priorities.</p>
