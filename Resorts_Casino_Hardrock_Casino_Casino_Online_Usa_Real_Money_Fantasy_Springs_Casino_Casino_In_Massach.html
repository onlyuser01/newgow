<p>Play’n GO has released Hugo the Legacy, the sixth game in the iconic Hugo series, just in time to honor the troll’s 30th anniversary</p>
<p>Released by Play’n GO as a way of celebrating Hugo’s 30th anniversary and also to further prove its unparalleled commitment to creating emblematic, high-quality games with fully immersive action, Hugo the Legacy is expected to quickly turn into another big household name.</p>
<p>The three-toed troll has made a spectacular return, once again putting familiar faces from the series’ previous adventures straight into the spotlight, on the 7×7 grid. Continuing the action from the 2021-released Hugo Carts slot, Hugo the Legacy will follow Hugo asking his friends Fernando and Jean Paul to put an end to Scylla and Don Croco’s evildoings.</p>

<p>Overcharge Meter, Charge Feature, and Free Spins</p>
<p>To score a win during the base game, players need to focus on clearing the grid of all Dynamite, Gold, Legacy Cap, Diamond, Character, and Key symbols. Keeping Players tabs on the Overcharge Meter will let players generate juicy bonuses. Hugo, Jean Paul, Fernando, Don Croco and Scylla are the main characters that can influence the action on the grid and add more dynamics and excitement to the game.</p>
<p>Collecting 15 Charges will trigger the Charge feature, with the first Charge feature adding between five and eight wild symbols to the grid. For a second Charge, players get to see two to five low-paying symbols get upgraded into high-paying ones. The third Charge will have the Scylla character guard up to two wilds while destroying the rest as she summons her powers and applies them to the grid.</p>
<p>Finally, the fourth Charge will have Fernando turn a symbol type into a wild while the fifth Charge feature will have Jean Paul scoop up symbols and duplicate them to generate winning Clusters.</p>
<p>Collecting 35 to 50 Scylla and Don Croco’s symbols will unlock Free Spin tiers. As more symbols are cleared off the grid, the fresh thresholds will proceed to unlock a dynamic plethora of rewards with Free Spins as a theme.</p>
<p>During the Free Spins rounds, players can also opt for the Gamble feature where they can keep their current wins or take a chance and gamble while mirroring the storyline of the slot.</p>
<p>Play’n GO’s head of game retention, George Olekszy, called Hugo Legacy “a truly ambitious slot” that will reward fans with a series of intriguing references to characters found in the previous games of the series, ranging from the original Hugo game launched in 2016, Hugo 2 released in 2017, followed by Hugo Goal in 2018, Hugo’s Adventure in 2019, and the previously mentioned Hugo Carts slot from 2021.</p>
<p>Olekszy also spoke about Hugo the Troll’s 30th birthday, explaining the new release was a suitable means of honoring the iconic character’s intellectual property, multimedia franchise, and all related games.</p>
<p>In mid-July, Play’n GO announced it would continue its equally popular Merlin series with the newly released Merlin: Journey of Flame game. Earlier in the same month, the studio launched Fox Mayhem featuring free spins and a Prize Collection, right before it made its debut into retail gaming by launching Book of Dead via William Hill in the UK.</p>
