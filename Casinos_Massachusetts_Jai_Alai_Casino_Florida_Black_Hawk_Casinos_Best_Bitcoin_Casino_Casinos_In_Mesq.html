<p>Multi-channel provider of 24/7 live betting services, Sports Information Services (SIS), announced a new deal with the operator Go+bet. The new deal marks the entry of SIS to the regulated market in Poland and brings for the first time the company’s leading greyhound and horse racing content for customers in the country.</p>
<p>Per the terms of the new deal, Go+bet customers in Poland will benefit from premium horse racing content provided by SIS. Such content will include events from Ireland and the UK, as well as international events from Germany, Hungary, Spain, Saudi Arabia, Canada and Dubai. Additionally, the clients will benefit from horse racing content from Latin America, Mexico and the United States. What’s more, the deal will see the delivery of greyhound racing content from Mexican, Irish and UK events.</p>
<p>The new collaboration reaffirms the growing interest in live racing content observed in Eastern Europe. Bettors like the option of having regular short-term wagering opportunities. This caused a spike in interest which helped increase the popularity of horse and greyhound racing, resulting in operators delivering attractive proposals.</p>
<p>“We are delighted to have signed this deal with SIS as part of our continued aim to bring unique, high-quality content to our customers in Poland from all over the world, setting us apart from our competitors.“ Mateusz Banaś, chief operating officer at Go+bet</p>
<p>Mateusz Banaś, Go+bet’s chief operating officer, said that the company is delighted to deliver the leading content from SIS. According to him, this collaboration complements the operator’s goal to deliver unique and engaging content for its customers in Poland. “With races at any time of day to choose from, our position in the market in Poland is set to be significantly enhanced, and we’re confident our bettors will be excited at the betting opportunities that will be available to them,” said Banaś in conclusion.</p>
<p>SIS Continues to Expand Reach</p>
<p>Currently, SIS delivers content for more than 73,000 events every year via its 24/7 live betting channels. This data is delivered as an end-to-end solution and includes information such as graphics, markets, as well as live streamed data and pictures. Many operators find such an offering appealing as it creates a unique and engaging betting experience for their customers. Keeping in mind the recent agreement, SIS continues to expand its presence to new markets and audiences.</p>
<p>“Partnering with Go+bet is another important step forward in our efforts to expand across this emerging market and once again illustrates the ability of SIS to deliver cutting-edge and revenue-driving content to operators.“ Bartlomiej Michalek, commercial manager, UK and Europe at SIS</p>
<p>Bartlomiej Michalek, SIS’ commercial manager, UK and Europe, deemed the company’s collaboration in Poland a “landmark deal.” According to him, the Go+bet partnership helps the company expand its footprint in Eastern Europe and at the same time delivers unique frequent betting opportunities to new audiences. Finally, Michalek said that SIS is looking forward to the success the new collaboration will bring.</p>
