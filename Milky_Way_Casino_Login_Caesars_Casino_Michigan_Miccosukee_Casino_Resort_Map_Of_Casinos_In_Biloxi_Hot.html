<p>Tombstone RIP review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Tombstone R.I.P has a dark Old West theme.</p>
<p>Players saunter into a desolate Western town, encountering troubled heroes and blood-splattered villains. With a little help from these rugged cowboys, players might just make it out alive.</p>
<p>This game is a good fit for players who enjoy Western-themes, but feel in the mood for a gritty atmosphere.</p>
<p>Win with the xNudge symbol on a reel</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The ominous soundtrack brings to mind the climactic scenes of classic Western films. Players will feel like a cowboy standing his ground as he faces down a heartless outlaw. The reels spin with a subtle clicking that brings to mind a gun cocking.</p>
<p>Before players enter the game, they face a multiple-choice question about their life in the game world. Only upon answering correctly can they enter, establishing the harshness of this Western town.</p>
<p>On the ramshackled wooden reels, players will meet dusty cowgirls, grim cowboys, and even a man hanging from a gallows. All the characters are animated in faded gray tones that gives the game a world-weary look.</p>
<p>Behind the reels, players will see a bleak town that has no doubt seen better days. The mainstreet is dusty and the sunlight is pale, setting the scene for a fatal duel.</p>
<p>Overall, the animation and soundtrack establish a gloomy, dramatic atmosphere for this Western world.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Tombstone RIP has a 2-3-3-3-1 reel grid. The last reel is special in that each symbol counts as a double symbol, no low value symbols land on it, and it contains special symbols during bonus features.</p>
<p>Players are awarded wins for landing matching symbols in adjacent reels, starting from the leftmost reel and going to the rightmost.</p>
<p>Players can opt to take the Enhanced Bet option which will increase their bet with an additional 10%. This will change the way the game behaves by making payouts less frequent but bonuses more likely. The enhanced bet only affects the second reel, making it guaranteed to land at least one Scatter symbol.</p>
<p>Scatter is always present on reel 2 with the Enhanced Bet</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter symbol. This standard Wild symbol only lands on reels 2, 3, 4, and 5.</p>
<p>The Stacked Wild symbols always nudge to be fully visible on the reels. The Wild has a multiplier that increases by 1 for each nudge, and when multiplier Wilds combine their multipliers. These symbols will only appear on the middle three reels.</p>
<p>There is also a Reel Split Wild that can land on the middle three reels. Upon landing, this Wild divides itself, as well as the other symbols currently on the reels, into two halves.This doubles the number of symbols on the reels.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the xSplit Wild can only land on the final reel and it divides symbols to its left into 4 paths. If an xSplit Wild divides a Nudging Wild, it will double that Wild’s multiplier.</p>
<p>The xRIP feature is triggered when the total payout is below the base bet. During this feature, there is no payout.</p>
<p>There are two types of Scatter symbols (Hang Em High Scatters and Boothill Scatters) which lead to different versions of a Free Spins feature when players land at least 3 matching Scatters.</p>
<p>Hang Em High Free Spins grant the player 8 spins, during which the win multiplier is increased by landing Wild symbols (x1), Reel Split Wilds (x2), Split Wilds (x2), and Nudge Wilds (x1-x3). All Wilds remain in place until the Free Spins end.</p>
<p>Boothill Free Spins are the same as Hang Em High Spins with three key additions. Firstly, the player starts with 10 spins. Secondly, any Cowboy symbol landing on reel five is turned into a Wild along with all matching symbols on that spin. Thirdly, a random multiplier between x5 and x999 is added to one Cowboy symbol each spin before wins are calculated.</p>
<p>The plethora of Wilds and multipliers can result in enormous wins capped at x300,000 of players’ base bet.</p>
<p>Single spin big win in the Tombstone R.I.P. slot</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.08%, nearly exactly our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.10 up to a maximum of $/£/€50 per spin.</p>
<p>Tombstone RIP’s high volatility makes it a great match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Paytable for high paying symbols of the game</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We recommend this average RTP, high volatility Western-themed slot.</p>
<p>With reasonable RTP, and ample volatility, this game is a decent choice for mathematically-minded players.</p>
<p>The moody theme and unique aesthetic add further appeal for those who are in the mood for a darker version of the Wild West.</p>
<p>The plethora of bonuses ensures that players will stay on their toes and engaged.</p>
