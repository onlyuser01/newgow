<p>The fourth quarter of 2021 proved to be difficult for sports betting operators in Demark, according to new details released by the regulator in the country.</p>
<p>Sports Betting GGR Decreases in Q4 2021</p>
<p>New data released by Spillemyndigheden, the Danish Gambling Authority, reveals that sports betting revenues during Q4 2021 hit DKK 593 million ($88.2 million). This marked a significant 18.3% decrease when compared to the same period during Q4 2020. Although a significant fall was observed in the betting revenue during Q4 2021, the result was still better than the DKK 577 million ($85.7 million) in revenue reported during Q3, 2021.</p>
<p>Focusing on the bigger picture, the total gross gaming revenue (GGR) for the gambling industry during Q4 2021 hit DKK 1.69 billion ($250.8 million). This marked a decrease of 3.9% when compared to the DKK 1.73 billion ($256.8 million) reported during Q4 2020.</p>
<p>Online Casinos, Gaming Machines’ GGR Increases</p>
<p>A breakdown of the DKK 1.69 billion ($250.8 million) in GGR shows that online casinos were responsible for 43.31% of the GGR during Q4 2021. On the other hand, during Q4 2021 betting was responsible for 35.51% of the GGR. Gaming machines contributed by 16.12%, while land-based casinos’ share was 5.06% of the GGR in Q4 2021. On the bright side, despite the fall of betting revenue, gaming machines, land-based casinos and online casinos have all seen an uptick in their revenues during the fourth quarter of 2021.</p>
<p>During Q4 2021, gaming machines reported DKK 269 million ($39.9 million) in revenue. This marked a slight 0.9% increase when compared to the same period the prior year. However, online casinos have seen bigger growth during Q4 2021. Online casinos’ GGR for the last quarter of 2021 hit DKK 723 million ($107.3 million). The result represented a 7.2% increase when compared to the same period last year.</p>
<p>Land-Based Casino Revenues Increase</p>
<p>Without any doubt, the biggest increase in GGR was reported by land-based casinos. In Q4, 2021, land-based casinos have seen DKK 84 million ($12.4 million) in GGR. This marked a significant 21.9% increase when compared to the same period in 2020. Still, land-based casinos’ GGR during Q4 2021 did not surpass the DKK 98 million ($14.5 million) in GGR from Q3 2021.</p>
<p>Overall, during the full year 2021, Danish gambling operators have seen a total of DKK 6.2 billion ($920.5 million) in GGR. This marks a slight increase when compared to 2020 when the total GGR halted at DKK 6.0 billion ($890.7 million).</p>
