<p>Ensuring fairness and honesty in gaming, The Michigan Gaming Control Board was established in 1997 and is responsible for licensing and regulating the state's commercial casinos, as well as all online casino gaming and sports betting activity conducted in the state.</p>
<p>Michigan is home to three land-based casinos in Detroit, as well as many other casinos across the state which are operated by local Native American tribes, in accordance to compacts entered into with the state government. The MGCB doesn't have regulatory authority over the tribal casinos, which are regulated by the National Indian Gaming Commission, but is in charge of making sure that the terms of the state-tribe compacts are adhered to.</p>
<p>On December 20th 2019, a bill was passed authorizing the Detroit casinos and all tribe operated casinos to provide online gaming and sports-betting to the residents of Michigan. The first ceremonial wager was placed by Michigan Senator Curtis Hertel on January 22nd, 2021 and at the time of writing there are now 15 officially licensed online operators.</p>
<p>How to check a license</p>
<p>Only operators licensed by the MGCB can offer online gambling services in Michigan, and it is possible to check a company is operating legally by referring to the Licensed Internet Gaming Providers list. The list includes the all the names of the providers as well as direct links to their websites.</p>
