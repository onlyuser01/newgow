    <h1>Newest Casino Aquarius Hotel And Casino Laughlin Nevada Harrahs Cherokee Casino Nc Treasure Bay Casi</h1>

<p>i do understand the importance and have done it many, many times. However for me to send the credit card information and pictures four times only for them to continue saying they need it again. It is a scam and a stall tactic. I could post reviews for you here where twenty people are having the same problem.</p>
<p>here is another person with the exact problem I have copied for your reference.</p>
<p>‘As others have stated, I cannot get through the process of validating my account. I have sent in the information multiple times. The information they have requested has always been attached to my emails and they continue to email me back saying that they did not get some of the information, even though it is attached to my emails. It takes a minimum of 3-4 days for them to reply to my emails. I called customer service and they say that I am not able to reach out to the billing department any other way, only through email. I ask them to escalate my issue and nothing further gets done. In 3-4 days I just keep receiving an email that states they need information that I have already sent over to them. This has been an incredibly frustrating process. At this time all I have to believe is that they are scamming me. I have hope in that some people on here say they are getting paid out. Unfortunately, I have still not. I understand they are new, but I have sent my information in to confirm multiple times, so it seems like they are just giving me the run around.’</p>
<p>there are twenty more like that at the following link. All of these people don’t just wake up and decide to post validation issues with Reddog for no reason.</p>

<p>if you would like me to send you the emails privately with the pictures and the casino responses I will do that so you can see the absurdity and the delay. The pictures are crystal clear each time. I just don’t want to put pics of my credit card here but will send them privately. Let me know ?</p>
