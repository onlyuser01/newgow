<p>One of the biggest networking affiliate and gambling industry events is fast approaching with iGaming Club Amsterdam 2023 taking place on Tuesday, July 11, and Routy revealed as the gathering’s Bronze Sponsor.</p>
<p>Routy is a business intelligence solutions provider that works with affiliates and has a very narrow focus on the iGaming industry. The company has built a strong reputation for working with gambling companies, helping them design and execute powerful marketing strategies that are result and performance-oriented.</p>
<p>Routy is a distinct part of the iGaming industry, helping affiliates seamlessly integrate the firm’s solutions with various gambling platforms and deliver cutting-edge services in real time. Commenting on this opportunity, Routy Co-Founder Michael Filletti said:</p>
<p>"As proud sponsors of AffPapa’s renowned iGaming Club, we can’t wait to connect with the best in the business and fuel the excitement surrounding affiliation in iGaming. See you in Amsterdam."</p>
<p>iGaming Club Amsterdam 2023 comes shortly after the success of iGaming Club Malta, which took place at the same time as iGaming NEXT Valletta.</p>
<p>Since the event launched a few years ago, the iGaming Club series has been an important and powerful platform that has connected affiliates, businesses, and gambling companies interested in expanding their reach and expanding their understanding of what the best and most successful advertisement practices are.</p>
<p>AffPapa Head of Commercials Yeva Avagyan was similarly pleased with the opportunity to welcome Routy as the official Bronze Sponsor for the gathering. She promised that the exclusive event will be back in the Netherlands for a second year in a row, making a full circle since the iGaming Club launched.</p>
<p>The industry’s affiliate elite will be converging on the historic De Bazel Amsterdam next week to exchange know-how and expertise. In the meantime, the format has grown so big that AffPapa is constantly looking to expand by adding more seats.</p>
