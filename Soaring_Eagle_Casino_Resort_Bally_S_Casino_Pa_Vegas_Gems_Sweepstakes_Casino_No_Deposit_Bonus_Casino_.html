<p>The new American football league called XFL is expected to start in the USA on February 8th. This has become possible after a deal for integrity monitoring with sports data and technology provider Genius Sports.</p>
<p>The Partnership Will Protect the League from Illegal Sports Betting</p>
<p>According to a press release, the agreement has become a fact following a detailed 18-month research which involved gathering data, ideas and opinions from different football professionals and experts. There has even been a nationwide survey among more than 6,000 football fans.</p>
<p>During 2019, the XFL put to the test a wide range of rules and options for playing under game conditions on the field of play.</p>
<p>This year, XFL is also continuing to gear up by organizing a training camp in Houston where Genius Sports will hold integrity workshops with game officials, players and coaches. There they will have the opportunity to benefit from a tailored e-Learning platform that provides detailed explanation of the league’s regulations and rules.</p>
<p>“Sports betting is growing rapidly in the US and we are gearing up to be a good citizen and thoughtful participant in the marketplace,” commented Jeffrey Pollack, president and chief operating officer of the XFL.</p>
<p>“Our alliance with Genius Sports is an important first step and foundational element,” he added.</p>
<p>From Genuis Sports hope to help XFL employees get better understanding of the required level of betting on their games and establish a procedure for reporting potential issues, and provide assistance.</p>
<p>Following the procedure, XFL players, coaches, officials, team and league executives will have to report any rule breaches thus protectiong the start-up league from unregulated operations.</p>
<p>XFL’s Games Will Be Broadcast on ESPN and FOX Sports</p>
<p>In the United States, the XFL has landed a deal with ESPN and Fox Sports for a weekly broadcast of XLF’s games on ABC and Fox Sports as well as on cable on ESPN, ESPN2, FS1 and FS2.</p>
<p>Genius Sports also expressed their satisfaction from the partnership with the new league. The company’s managing director Steven Burton shared his opinion on the new partnership stating that the XFL has shown an exemplary commitment to protecting the integrity of its games.</p>
<p>He said they were proud to partner with such a dynamic league and look forward to helping the XFL benefit from increased fan avidity by engaging with the nascent US sports betting industry.</p>
<p>Genius Sports, has already been partnering with more than 100 leagues and sports federations, including golf’s PGA Tour, the NBA basketball league and the English Premier League. The company has also started a partnership with the governing body for Colombia’s leading football competitions in November.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the main supporter of XFL is the owner of the WWE Vince McMahon. He has invested in it almost $400m.</p>
<p>The XFL’s first game kicks-off on February 8th with Seattle Dragons against DC Defenders later the on the same day followed by Los Angeles Wildcats vs Houston Roughnecks.</p>
