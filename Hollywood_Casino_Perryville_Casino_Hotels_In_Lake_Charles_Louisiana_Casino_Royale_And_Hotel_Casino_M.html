<p>Welcome and thank you for contacting Casino Support Center. You are chatting with Ron H*** from our Live Chat support.</p>
<p>Hello, Mary</p>
<p>Hello I am trying to withdraw my winnings $300</p>
<p>I am sorry but your winning is removed by our withdrawals team.</p>
<p>My apologies, but it appears that our Finance Department found a discrepancy with your recent deposit(s)done with your debit/credit card. To help us resolve this issue, could you please send a bank statement, credit card statement or screenshot of your app/internet banking, identifying your confirmed deposits to payments@casinosupportcenters.com? Please highlight the deposit transaction(s) under review in your document and include your username and name of the casino.</p>
<p>Please note that a screenshot of your casino account or deposit confirmation email is not sufficient; it has to be a document from the debit/credit card used, issued by your financial institution. Thank you</p>
<p>I sent a bank statement</p>
<p>I have contacted casino GURU because I continue to provide everything you ask but continue to get the run around</p>
<p>You need to wait for there response.</p>
<p>I would love to give you more information but it's simply not available from Customer Support end. The one reviewing and approving transactions is our Finance Team.</p>
<p>My withdrew went from $300 to $225 when sign on bonus was 50 free spins on one game you choose,</p>
<p>So how do I contact finance team</p>
<p>Then what is the point of live help when there is no live help?? I will contact BBB or casino GURU lawyers I have read bad reviews after depositing my money only to be played. I'm the wrong one</p>
<p>Umm no more response to help hello do I need to restart live support again to wait an hour</p>
<p>There is no withdrawals amount in your account all amount is removed from your balance. You need to contact on the email for more information.</p>
<p>Do you have any other requests for me at this moment?</p>
<p>Good thing I took screen shots and documented everything I've sent and printed out everything</p>
