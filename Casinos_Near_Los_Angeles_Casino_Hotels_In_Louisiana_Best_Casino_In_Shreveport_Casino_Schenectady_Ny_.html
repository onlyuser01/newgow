<p>Piggy Bankers review</p>
<p>Piggy Bankers is a pig and money-themed slot from the team at Pragmatic Play. The slot is focused on two super-rich pigs and their mansion.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>Pigs have a long and well-documented history in online slot games. The popular Piggy Riches slots from NetEnt have established pigs in the slot world as pompous, rich animals that sneer at those beneath them. Pragmatic Play picked up this mantle with the Piggy Bank Bills slot and has continued with its sequel, Piggy Bankers.</p>
<p>In Piggy Bankers, a rich male and female pig are the center of attention. The game reels are set inside their bank with marble pillars and a luxurious red carpet filling the background. It is a really stylish slot design that helps establish the world that these pigs live in.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Piggy Bankers has a very basic setup. The game uses five reels and four rows, with 20 active paylines on each spin. Winning combinations are formed when players land three or more matching symbols across a payline, starting on the leftmost reel.</p>
<p>There is also a horizontal reel above the game grid that is key to unlocking some of the bigger wins in the game.</p>
<p>The slot’s gameplay is nearly identical on mobile devices, with the game making an effortless switch to smaller screen sizes.</p>

<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The aforementioned horizontal reel above the grid plays an important role in the slot’s bonus features. Banknote symbols displaying a multiplier can appear on any reel in the game. If a Stack of Wilds lands beneath a symbol, a payout is awarded. These payouts can reach up to x100.</p>
<p>Landing a Stack of Wilds also sees the Wild expand and trigger a respin. There are two types of Wild in the game, each with its own feature. The Lady Pig Wild moves one reel to the right on a respin and continues doing so until she is off the reels, while the Male Pig moves to the left. If the two Wilds are both active and they meet, and walk into one another in the middle of the reels, then they will launch the game’s free spins bonus, with five spins being rewarded.</p>
<p>The Free Spins bonus can also be triggered by landing a Free Spins symbol with Wilds beneath it on the horizontal reel. Five spins are given out, with Banknote symbols worth up to x1,000 appearing. If two Walking Wilds are active and bump into one another during the spins, they will split and create a multiplier.</p>
<p>It is also possible to buy your way into the bonus, depending on your location.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>Piggy Bankers uses a math model that Pragmatic Play has used in other slots The maximum win of the game is 10,000x your stake. The developer has given it a full 5/5 volatility rating, which fits the recommendations in our slot strategy guide. The RTP is 96.05%, which is around average.</p>
<p>Players can change the stake by clicking the +/- between spins. The minimum is $0.20 and the maximum is $240, which is a fairly average betting range that should accommodate most budgets.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Piggy Bankers is a volatile and enjoyable slot game from Pragmatic Play. The introduction of the horizontal reel creates some interesting gameplay, and the maximum win of 10,000x your stake is going to please most players. The Walking Wilds, Respins, and Free Spins bonus all help to make this an engaging and enjoyable slot.</p>
