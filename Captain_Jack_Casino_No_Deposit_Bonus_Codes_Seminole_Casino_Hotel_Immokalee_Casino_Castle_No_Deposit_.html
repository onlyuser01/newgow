    <h1>Captain Jack Casino No Deposit Bonus Codes Seminole Casino Hotel Immokalee Casino Castle No Deposit</h1>

<p>Casino game developer Novibet announced that it would soon launch its products in New Jersey and Mexico after partnerships with high-profile operators Caesars Entertainment and Big Bola. The deals continue Novibet’s North America expansion strategy.</p>
<p>The Company Already Has Significant Experience</p>
<p>The Malta-based game tech developer has been active in Europe since 2010 and has established itself as a leading iGaming provider. The company recently announced its intentions to go public through a merger with SPAC Artemis, which should complete during the second half of 2022. Novibet has also pushed hard to expand its business into North America, and the recent partnerships represent significant milestones towards that goal.</p>
<p>George Athanasopoulos, Novibet CEO, commented that the company’s progress in the USA was a top priority.</p>
<p>The expansion of our iCasino platform into new regulated markets, including in North America, is a major pillar of our growth strategy. George Athanasopoulos, CEO of Novibet</p>
<p>He added that the company planned to replicate its European successes by drawing on its significant market experience and expansive catalog of engaging iGaming content.</p>
<p>Novibet Will Launch in New Jersey by 2023</p>
<p>Novibet’s new multi-year market access deal with Caesars Entertainment will grant the iGaming developer access to the New Jersey gambling market. As part of the ten-year agreement, Novibet will manage branded online sports betting and casino services. An earlier ten-year deal with Caesars granted the company another US foothold in Pennsylvania, where it will operate its iGaming service.</p>
<p>The last hurdle the game developer will need to clear is obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals and licenses. If all goes according to plan, New Jersey and Pennsylvania gamblers will have access to the novibet.com website in 2023.</p>
<p>Mexico Is Another Prime Expansion Opportunity</p>
<p>The company’s other significant North American expansion milestone is the contract with Mexico’s Big Bola Casinos. The operator is one of the few gambling companies in the country licensed to offer OSB and iGambling services and manages 20 land-based venues. The new novibet.mx website should launch this year, and the two companies will share the generated revenue. This initiative will allow Novibet to tap the roughly $1 billion Mexican gaming market.</p>
<p>The Novibet CEO expressed his satisfaction with the recent partnerships, noting that the company would tailor its offerings to suit local preferences and help drive engagement and retention. He added that both deals would substantially increase Novibet’s reach and allow more players to experience its extensive games portfolio.</p>
<p>Novibet Aims at Canada</p>
<p>Novibet’s plans for the future are predominantly focused on branching out into Canada. The province of Ontario legalized online gambling earlier this year, and the game developer has already submitted a license application with the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario (AGCO). The company is already preparing to launch its OSB and iGaming platforms there by the end of the year. It likely hopes to secure a niche in a relatively new market with the potential to reach $2 billion by 2026.</p>
