<p>Itâ€™s time for the final round of the 2022-23 Premier League and the former champion Leicester City needs a win over West Ham (and a lot of luck) to stay up</p>
<p>Everton, Leicester, and Leeds â€“ only one of these three will stay in the Premier League for another season. Which one? Weâ€™ll find out on Saturday, May 27. If the 2016 EPL champion Leicester City is going to do it, the Foxes need to beat West Ham and see Everton fail against Bournemouth.</p>

<p>Leicester City Has No Other Option But to Go for a Win on Saturday</p>
<p>Leicester City is sitting in the 18th position in the Premier League ahead of the final round of the season. The Foxes are just two points behind Everton, the closest team from the safe zone. They also have a better score difference than the Toffees, meaning that if the two ended on equal points, Leicester would be placed higher in the standings.</p>

<p>In simple terms, this means that Everton must beat Bournemouth to stay up. A draw or a loss would give Leicester City and Leeds a chance to leapfrog them. The good news for the former champions is that theyâ€™ve got a better score differential than Leeds, so they donâ€™t need to worry about this team either. The only thing that should be on Leicester Cityâ€™s mind is getting a win on Saturday.</p>
<p>So, can they beat West Ham? They did it the last time they played. It was 2-0 at the London Stadium, but it happened in the first half of the season. Since the start of 2023, the Foxes have been abysmal. Theyâ€™ve won just one game since February 11, losing 11 games in all competitions, as well as drawing four.</p>
<p>The Hammers Donâ€™t Care Much About the Final EPL Round</p>
<p>The Hammers are currently in 14th position in the Premier League. In the worst-case scenario, West Ham would end up in 16th place. In the best-case scenario, these guys would finish the season in 12th place in the EPL standings.</p>
<p>Knowing all this, itâ€™s only logical to assume that the Hammers donâ€™t care much about Saturdayâ€™s game. Actually, their No. 1 focus at the moment is Europe. David Moyesâ€™ boys have booked their ticket to the final of the 2023 Europa Conference League. Theyâ€™re taking on Fiorentina in the Final on June 7.</p>
<p>Keeping their key men fit and ready for that game is crucial for the Hammers, which is why we could see Moyes keeping some big stars on the bench on Saturday. Jarrod Bowen, for instance, the man whoâ€™s played for West Ham in every single EPL game this season, might start from the bench. The same goes for Declan Rice, Tomas Soucek, and others.</p>
<p>Leicester City vs West Ham Prediction</p>
<p>Leicester City will win this game, weâ€™re pretty confident about this. However, weâ€™re not sure if thatâ€™s going to be enough to keep them in the Premier League for another season. Instead, we think itâ€™s more likely that Everton will stay up.</p>
<p>Pick: Leicester City to win</p>
