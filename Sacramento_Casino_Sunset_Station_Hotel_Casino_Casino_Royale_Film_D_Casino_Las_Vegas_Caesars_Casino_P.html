<p>The 5x5 slot will see players accompany the famous mythological hero on his journeys</p>
<p>Two weeks after the launch of Bill &amp; Coin, leading iGaming content supplier Relax Gaming has launched another cutting-edge game. The new slot is called Hercules Unleashed and, as the title suggests, will take players on a mythological adventure.</p>
<p>Hercules Unleashed Metrics</p>
<p>Rows: 5</p>
<p>Reels: 5</p>
<p>Paylines: 259</p>
<p>Volatility: High</p>
<p>RTP: 94%</p>
<p>Min/Max bet: 0.2/100</p>
<p>Max win: 10,000x</p>
<p>Join Hercules on a Legendary Adventure</p>
<p>The 5×5 slot will see players accompany the famous mythological hero on his journeys. Players will join the demigod as he tackles his famous labors and slays deadly creatures. Symbols include well-known monsters such as Cerberus, the Nemean Lion, the Hydra and the Cretan Bull.</p>
<p>The title boasts a variety of creatures, such as Relax’s Dream Drop mechanic, allowing them to win the Dream Drop Jackpot. A Jackpot Spin may be triggered randomly before a normal spin and includes only blank symbols and DD symbols on the reels. If players land on 5DD symbols, they will trigger the Dream Drop Bonus, allowing them to grab the RAPID, MIDI, MAXI, MAJOR or MEGA jackpots.</p>
<p>In addition to that, players can activate the Beast Slayer Bonus by landing on three or more bonus symbols. The bonus round expands the size of the game, upgrades the symbols and provides players with lucrative multipliers.</p>
<p>The bonus game also launches a re-spin feature that starts with three spins. The number of respins decreases on every spin but resets every time a winning symbol lands.</p>
<p>Relax Gaming Is Excited about the Launch</p>
<p>The release of this latest title was praised by Relax Gaming’s chief product officer, Shelley Hannah. Hannah praised Hercules as an iconic character that “has transcended many forms of entertainment through the years.” She is excited to launch Relax Gaming’s own take on this fabled mythological character and provide players with unforgettable gaming experiences.</p>
<p>If the great game artwork, engaging mechanics and gripping features weren’t enough to captivate players, we are confident the gargantuan Dream Drop Jackpot will be enough to pique their interest. Shelley Hannah, CPO, Relax Gaming</p>
