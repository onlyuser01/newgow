<p>Coingaming Group and Tron Foundation have teamed up to introduce TRX on the Coingaming-owned Bitcasino.io and Sportsbet.io.</p>
<p>Sportsbet.io and Bitcasino.io Partner Up with Tron Foundation</p>
<p>Coingaming Group, the company behind flagship crypto gambling platforms Bitcasino.io and Sportsbet.io has struck a brand-new partnership with the Tron Foundation. The Foundation represents one of the most popular cryptocurrencies used in crypto gambling, to name TRX.</p>
<p>As a result of the newly-forged partnership, the pair of gambling websites – a casino and a sportsbook respectively – will add TRX as one of the available payment options in their portals.</p>
<p>Tron believes TRX is a perfect fit for the online gambling space, as the cryptocurrency allows players and sports fans to make transactions instantly and without incurring any additional fees.</p>
<p>Welcome @Sportsbetio to join the #TRON ecosystem! Coming together is a beginning, staying together is progress, and working together is a success.</p>
<p>1 Million #TRX is waiting! Prepare to battle and be the Last Man Standing!</p>

<p>Another strength of TRX is that many iGaming developers have agreed to adapt their titles for TRX gameplay, including OneTouch, Evolution Gaming, Kalamba, and others. The other mainstream vertical is of course Bitcoin where Betsoft and Endorphina have been a few of the names to bring innovative solutions to the table.</p>
<p>Understandably, some cryptocurrencies have been perceived with mistrust, but TRX enjoys popularity.</p>
<p>Receiving the News – Tim Heath and Justin Sun</p>
<p>Commenting on the development, this is what Tim Heath, CEO of Coingaming Group, had to say:</p>
<p>“We always work hard to put our customers at the centre of the universe, and by adding TRX gaming we are once again at the cutting edge of what is possible in this space. We are particularly excited to offer a low minimum deposit threshold and zero transaction fees, ensuring Bitcasino.io and Sportsbet.io gaming can be enjoyed by even more players for the first time.”</p>
<p>Heath further explained that the Tron community has attracted some of the most open-minded individuals who are happy to embrace innovation. Players already using the services of Bitcoincasino.io and Sportsbet.io would certainly appreciate TRX as a payment option.</p>
<p>Not least of all, Sportsbet.io users are already familiar with TRX, as the sportsbook has given away estimated TRX 1 million.</p>
<p>Tron founder Justin Sun had this to say, welcoming the news on his own turn:</p>
<p>“One of the Tron Foundation’s core missions is to support growth by providing engaging, real-world use cases for TRX.</p>
<p>We’ve been aware of the market-leading gaming brands operated by the Coingaming Group for some time now; Bitcasino.io and Sportsbet.io are fantastic examples of what is possible when crypto-led products put the customer above everything else. It is genuinely thrilling to see another world-class brand open its doors to the TRX community.”</p>
<p>Most recently, Sportsbet.io signed a shirt sponsorship with Flamengo, one of the largest Brazilian soccer teams. The platform has been known for its involvement in soccer, specifically through CONIFA and Rosario Central ties.</p>
