<p>How online slots work</p>
<p>Online slots started as digital versions of slot machines you may have seen at land-based casinos or gaming halls. Since then, game developers have been coming up with creative themes, features, gameplay elements, and other characteristics that are making slots the most popular casino games on the internet today.</p>
<p>Traditional online slots are made up of reels with a range of symbols on them. You spin the reels and hope the symbols create a winning combination on an active win line. They may also come with special features, which are triggered either on random or by landing a certain number of special symbols. These most commonly include free spins or other types of bonus features.</p>
<p>Many modern online slots come with innovative gameplay elements, like cluster pays, in which winning combinations are created by clusters of symbols touching each other, as well as many other inventive features. With thousands of casino games created by hundreds of companies available, you can find pretty much anything.</p>
<p>Mathematics of online slots – house edge, RTP, and variance</p>
<p>Slot machines are configured to give the casino an advantage, also known as house edge. The average house edge of online slot machines is around 4%, which means that players lose 4% of the wagered amount on average in the long term. That said, the house edge can me lower or higher, depending on the specific slot machine and gambling website.</p>
<p>The RTP (return to player) – also known as payout ratio – is calculated as 100% minus the house edge and expresses the percentage of wagered funds players can expect to get back as individual wins, statistically. Games with a 4% house edge have an RTP of 96%.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, volatility (also known as variance) expresses how big and frequent individual wins are when playing a given slot machine. High volatility slots have a potential for large wins, but winning spins tend to be less frequent. On low volatility slots, you can win more frequently, but individual spins are usually smaller.</p>

<p>Strategies for real money slots play</p>
<p>Because of the casino's mathematical advantage over players, you cannot expect to be profitable playing slots in the long term. No strategy you follow can change that, so do not believe people or websites telling you that you can reliably win money on slots.</p>
<p>That said, there are things you can do to improve your chances of winning or minimize your expected losses. Check out our article about best slots strategies that can help you get better results. However, always keep in mind that you are playing at a disadvantage and should expect to lose money in the long term.</p>
<p>How to stay safe when playing real money slots</p>
<p>The best "strategies" to follow when playing slots for real money are safe gambling principles. Gambling can be dangerous if it gets out of hand, so it is crucial you approach it carefully and set preventive measures. Here are some of the most important things to keep in mind when playing real money slots:</p>
<p>Understand that playing slots is not a way of making money. You should see it as a form of entertainment that you pay for by playing at a disadvantage.</p>
<p>Only gamble with money you can afford to lose. Do not chase your losses nor play with borrowed money. Set a budget in advance and stick to it.</p>
<p>Do not play when in a bad state of mind nor under the influence or alcohol or drugs.</p>
<p>Watch out for symptoms of gambling addiction and take action if you feel like you might be at risk.</p>

<p>Bonuses offered by online slots sites</p>
<p>Gambling websites often offer bonuses and other promotions to new and existing players. Bonuses for new players are generally the most generous, as they are used to attract new players and give them an incentive to sign up and start playing.</p>
<p>Some bonuses are completely free, also known as no deposit bonuses. These are given to new players without requiring them to make a real money deposit. The two main types of free bonuses are:</p>
<p>Free spins bonuses – These consist of a certain number of free spins, which can be used on selected slot machines. This makes them popular amongst slot machine players. However, their shortcoming is that they limit which games you can play with them.</p>

However, their shortcoming is that they limit which games you can play with them. Free cash bonuses – These consist of free bonus funds added to your account.
