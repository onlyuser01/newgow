    <h1>Pin Up Casino Live Casino Pittsburgh Casino Boni Unibet Casino Pa Cortez Casino Sunmaker Casino Play</h1>

<p>Hello casino guru,</p>
<p>I've been playing at the online casino sunmaker since 2020. I'm fully verified, I've never had any issues with withdrawals. I was also able to play at sunmaker while on holiday abroad and deposit money, just like this year. At other casinos I could never register from abroad. At sunmaker, however, without any problems, also on my holiday in Slovenia from</p>
<p>07/25/2022 to 08/03/2022.</p>
<p>During this time I made several deposits. On 08/01/2022 I won 700 euros and requested a payout. Normally the processing takes a few hours, so I asked in the chat the next day if there were any problems. Answer : Playing from abroad is prohibited.</p>
<p>Question : Why was I then able to deposit money several times without any problems ?</p>
<p>Answer : We only saw that you were abroad when you made the payment.</p>
<p>I asked for a copy of the chat.</p>
<p>After that, sunmaker closed the chat without further information.</p>
<p>To date, no copy of the chat has come.</p>
<p>They then asked for proof of my address by e-mail, which I sent on 03.08. submitted and it was also verified.</p>
<p>In order to check sunmaker's statement, I paid in money again from abroad on 01.08 and 02.08. Although the chat said it shouldn't work, I was able to deposit money again without any problems.</p>
<p>I wrote that if it's forbidden and they cancel my 700 euros, I'll have to get my deposits from abroad back. I contacted the live chat again and also emailed support. To date I have received no explanation or any reply. In my account I can still see my request for payment of the 700 euros. It's only been 5 days today. Nevertheless, I'm already in touch today because sunmaker usually takes care of everything in a few hours, whether it's payments or verification. I expect reasonable communication. Why was I still able to deposit money or register abroad at all? Why has it worked abroad for the last two years (same country Slovenia) and now there are suddenly problems? Why is sunmaker asking for a new proof of my address, verified that on 03.08. and still not paying out my money?</p>
<p>Many thanks for your help</p>
