<p>The City of Buenos Aires is quickly welcoming a host of new operators and suppliers. Grupo Slots, an Argentine gaming company, has been able to launch its dedicated online and sports betting platform in the city, Jugadon.bet.ar late last week, introducing new forms of entertainment to local residents. The city is also the market with the largest potential in Argentina at this point.</p>
<p>A Launch That Was Long in the Making</p>
<p>The platform is powered by Gaming Innovation Group or GiG, which is also making an entry into the Argentinian gaming market, which is still in the process of regulating across different provinces. As the country is hashing out the minutiae, the City of Buenos Aires is already beckoning to operators and suppliers. GiG and Grupo Slots received a formal go-ahead to launch in the market back in March but have only brought their operations forward now.</p>
<p>Thanks to GiG’s dedicated solution and unique technological framework, Jugadon users are able to enjoy an impeccable experience that powers the entire time they spend at the platform. GiG’s expertise in creating and delivering compelling front-end solutions leads to a “smooth online player experience,” argues the group.</p>
<p>GiG CEO Richard Brown touched on the launch and the partnership with Grupo Slots, which GiG holds in high regard:</p>
<p>“Buenos Aires is a dynamic market, set to be one of the largest within Argentina with significant growth potential in the interactive space driven by regulation and growth of a digital online gaming penetration.” GiG CEO Richard Brown</p>
<p>Brown and GiG are also very proud to be among the earliest arrivals in the market, which would give them a foothold to continue building upon their operations. With over 20 locations in the country, Jugadon.com is a powerful ally to have as well.</p>
<p>Grupo Slots Happy with Developments</p>
<p>Grupo Slots general manager Juan Ignacio Torres was equally excited at the opportunity to be achieving what he called a “historic milestone,” i.e., introducing Jugadon in the City of Buenos Aires. Torres added:</p>
<p>“We built a great team with GiG and have developed a solid and safe platform that matches regulators specifications as well as Buenos Aires City’s market requirements.” Grupo Slots general manager Juan Ignacio Torres</p>
<p>The recent partnership is an expansion of a previous deal that Grupo Slots and GiG negotiated back in November. GiG agreed to provide Grupo Slots with a full online turnkey solution that the latter needed in anticipation of new launches in regulated iGaming markets. Pragmatic Play announced it was launching in the City of Buenos Aires last week as well.</p>
