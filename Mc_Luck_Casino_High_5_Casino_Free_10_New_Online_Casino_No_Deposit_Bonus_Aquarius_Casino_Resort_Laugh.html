<p>Inn our conversation with Bragg Gaming Group Director of Product Marketing Niklas Mravlje we speak at length about the company’s Atomic Slot Lab division, a North American land-based and iGaming casino content expert that has produced a string of memorable titles that resonate with player bases.</p>
<p>A well-represented company in the land-based sector, Atomic Slot Lab is now making a decisive step into the online space and is already a recognizable name owing to its signature titles and established lineage in the North American market. As Bragg Gaming Group navigates multiple global markets, and deploys its original FUZE™ gamification tool, Atomic Slot Lab continues to deliver outstanding content.</p>
<p>Q: Can we start by introducing Atomic Slot Lab? How is this supplier different from the other in-house content divisions under the Bragg Studios umbrella?</p>
<p>Atomic Slot Lab was created in January 2022 under the guidance and leadership of Doug Fallon, the Bragg's content director. The main difference to other studios under the Bragg Studios umbrella is that the Atomic Slot Lab team has a long and successful history of deploying games in the land-based space in North America, and specifically in Las Vegas, one of the most competitive gaming markets in the world.</p>
<p>That history of success, paired with the high-level technology Bragg Gaming brings to the table, turned this studio into an instant success, in high demand and popular with players.</p>
<p>Q: Bragg Gaming Group has recently expanded in both North America and Europe. How well-received have Atomic Slot Lab's titles been in the context of such different geographies?</p>
<p>Bragg has been expanding into North America (initially through the acquisition of Spin Games, which offered an already established distribution network in that market) since late 2022.</p>
<p>As the market is highly regulated and requires various levels of certification, we started to see the games go live in early 2023. Today, we are live in the four largest regulated US states, and the games have been received really well.</p>
<p>This high acceptance and quick deployment have been possible through the native connection of the Atomic Slot Lab games with the US market, a selection of handpicked partners like Bluberi, Incredible Technologies, and Sega Sammy Creation, which are all highly requested suppliers in the market as well, and of course thanks to the highly adaptive technology of Bragg Gaming.</p>
<p>Bragg has also been steadily increasing its footprint in Europe’s regulated markets, most recently Italy and Georgia. With the addition of the new studios, Bragg has experienced significant growth in established markets like the UK, the Netherlands, and Switzerland.</p>
<p>Q: You have been working hard on your FUZE™ gamification tool, which has gathered much momentum. Tell us more about the added entertainment delivered to players and why more companies seek it out.</p>
<p>Fuze™ is the only player engagement platform built for both casinos and sportsbooks. It</p>
<p>offers a set of tools that allows operators to offer a wide range of promotions and gamification features. With each integration Bragg does, this toolset is deployed as standard, and operators can use it as an out-of-the-box solution to create promotional features such as tournaments, quests, and free rounds. The toolset offers a variety of options, with around 20 different varieties of tournaments and quests available.</p>
<p>Beyond the toolset's applicability on Bragg’s exclusive games, it can also be used on the Bragg HUB for aggregated content or, more recently, as a stand-alone toolset for operators and platforms. Our Fuze™ functionality has been highly requested in the North American market in particular.</p>
<p>Q: Since Atomic Slot Lab is based in the United States, what have been the opportunities for growth in the iGaming industry in the country? Are you optimistic about the future and further expansion of the sector?</p>
<p>Absolutely. As mentioned earlier, Atomic Slot Lab’s history in the land-based market is very beneficial for the overall brand. In the North American market, games with deployments in the land-based environment already have a group of players familiar with the themes and mechanics who are excited to get the opportunity to play their favorite games online. Additionally, through that initial land-based deployment, we can pull learnings about the game, which can later be implemented in the online version of the game.</p>
<p>We see a lot of room for expansion for the studio and, of course, for our Powered by Bragg partners.</p>
<p>Q: What can we expect from Atomic Slot Lab for the rest of 2023?</p>
<p>We have quite an exciting rest of 2023 planned, with a total of five more games scheduled for release. Next up for us are Professor Big Win and Electric Jungle, both expected to be highly popular titles. In 2024, we are again stepping up by creating a game per month and some additional operator-exclusive or semi-exclusive titles on top. We are very much looking forward to growing the brand and bringing these games closer to more players who we know will love to play them!</p>
