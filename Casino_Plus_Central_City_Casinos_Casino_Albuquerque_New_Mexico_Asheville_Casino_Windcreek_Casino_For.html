    <h1>Casino Plus Central City Casinos Casino Albuquerque New Mexico Asheville Casino Windcreek Casino For</h1>

<p>On July 21 I made a withdrawal of 200 euros, that withdrawal was SUCCESSFUL (at first), it came to my card perfectly, what happened? that I see on my +200 card, and just at that moment it also put -200, and indeed, I arrived on July 29 (when it became effective) and I was automatically withdrawn from my card those 200 euros that were returned to the casino, THE TRANSACTION WAS NULL, I WAS GIVEN 200 AND I WAS TAKEN AWAY 200, I have complained many times and they say that the transaction was successful, indeed, it was successful, but they do not see that it was later null and I have disappeared from the bank those 200 euros to their Account, I HAVE ALL THE PROOFS ALL THE DOCUMENTS ALL THE MOVEMENTS, I show it and even so they keep denying me, my next step is to go to court, I do not plan to lose that money, I always have the truth ahead of me</p>
