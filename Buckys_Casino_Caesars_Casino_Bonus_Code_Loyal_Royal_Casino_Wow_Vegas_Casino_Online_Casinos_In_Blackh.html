    <h1>Buckys Casino Caesars Casino Bonus Code Loyal Royal Casino Wow Vegas Casino Online Casinos In Blackh</h1>

<p>Please do not think of playing in this casino. After having reopened my account and they asked me to do so, it turns out that when I had 2000 euros deposited (I only play American roulette) I was lucky enough to bet €50 on double zero and It came out for what I got 1800 This was on Thursday the 13th of this July.</p>
<p>Well, talking to the manager named Caroline, she tells me that according to my agreement, the withdrawals would be in 3 or 4 days maximum, remaining to pay me the 2000 that I withdrew, on Tuesday the 18th, which is today, or on Wednesday, July 19, which is tomorrow. .</p>
<p>She sends me an email today saying that between today the 18th and tomorrow the 19th they pay me the 2000 and that she is waiting for me to tell her finances if it will be paid today or tomorrow.</p>
<p>What is my surprise when I just received an email from Manager SpitFire Casino saying that before approving my withdrawal of 2000 they have noticed some irregularities in my game and winnings and that my account is under review.</p>
<p>This is something that some casinos use to avoid paying, but it just so happens that they cannot prove anything since there is no irregularity and thank goodness I made screens of all the biggest prizes, for example the €1,800 prize.</p>
<p>With this he made it clear that it is one of the worst casinos, as can be read on several websites, for example in Casino Guru, and that they are dedicated to defrauding users with comments of irregularities that do not exist.</p>
<p>I control screens where you can see the prizes won in the American roulette of Fits Person (Evolutions)</p>
