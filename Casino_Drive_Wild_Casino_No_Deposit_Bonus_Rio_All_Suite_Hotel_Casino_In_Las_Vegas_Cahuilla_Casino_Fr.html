    <h1>Casino Drive Wild Casino No Deposit Bonus Rio All Suite Hotel Casino In Las Vegas Cahuilla Casino Fr</h1>

<p>I accidentally deposited € 600 instead of € 60 at this casino! (01.29.2020)</p>
<p>Before I even made a shoot, I contacted the support via chat and asked for a chargeback of EUR 550.11 ...</p>
<p>In the chat it was said that I would receive a 10% deduction for non-implementation and someone would contact me! (As of January 29, 2020 1:14 PM)</p>
<p>After neither the money nor the advertised message from the support was received until the early evening, I decided to cancel the payment and continue playing ...</p>
<p>What a good decision I thought when I had 1600 € on the advert ...</p>
<p>I was happy and made another payment request for € 1500 at 17:34 GMZ</p>
<p>A little later came an email from the cashier team they needed documents which I promptly uploaded to the page! Jan 30, 2020 (12:31 am)</p>
<p>During the day I canceled the payment again because I wanted to split the money into the Skrill account and the ecopayz account !!</p>
<p>So there would still be 2 active payouts</p>
<p>One time 1000.11 EUR</p>
<p>And once 399.11 EUR</p>
<p>(As of 30.01.2020 9:15 UTC)</p>
<p>From now on I waited for verification and in the meantime I chatted and called by phone because after a processing time of 40h plus I was getting impatient!</p>
<p>Here I made a statement over the phone that I urgently needed the money because I still wanted to shop because I had already paid 600 instead of 60 as already mentioned at the beginning, whereupon a deposit limit was squeezed on the phone thought sensible and I would not repeat a wrong payment to the extent.</p>
<p>After the phone call I also received a self-exclusion, the deposit limit scolded itself</p>
<p>well and I had a choice to decide on the duration. (However, my payout would not be affected) and I should be patient as the process for self-exclusive players would take longer</p>
<p>Pissed off so bad I called again and wrote emails like that it was only a deposit limit was set with which right the stupid (****) makes decisions over my head because she was annoyed by me as a customer!</p>
<p>However, the self exclusion would now be and cannot be undone. Sauhauf Sauhaufe</p>
