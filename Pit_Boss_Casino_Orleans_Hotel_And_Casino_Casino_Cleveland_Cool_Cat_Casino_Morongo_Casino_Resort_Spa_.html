<p>Pragmatic Play has been providing slots to William Hill for six years</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play, a leading provider of iGaming content, has expanded its global footprint thanks to a partnership with another tier-one operator. As announced, the supplier has formed an alliance with William Hill, a subsidiary of 888 Holdings.</p>
<p>Under the agreement, Pragmatic Play will provide its new client with its live casino portfolio, powering its UK business with engaging live casino experiences. Many exciting live dealer titles will now be available to William Hill’s British audiences. This includes games such as roulette, blackjack and baccarat.</p>
<p>In addition to traditional games, Pragmatic Play will also supply its partner with a number of game show products, such as Sweet Bonanza CandyLand, Mega Wheel and the upcoming Vegas Ball Bonanza.</p>
<p>The current deal will expand the existing relationship between the two parties. For reference, Pragmatic Play has also been supplying slot games to William Hill in the UK since 2017. Speaking of slots, William Hill recently teamed up with Play’n GO to launch a retail version of Book of Dead.</p>
<p>The Two Companies Are Excited to Expand Their Partnership</p>
<p>888 Holdings’ global head of live casino, Richard Atkinson, commented on the new partnership, praising Pragmatic Play as a leader in live dealer products. He lauded the company as a forward-thinking supplier with a dedication to high quality.</p>
<p>Atkinson said that his team has enjoyed six years of fruitful partnership with Pragmatic Play and is excited to integrate the supplier’s live casino games into its platform.</p>
<p>We’ve worked closely together for six years and look forward to elevating our partnership further with the addition of Pragmatic Play’s Live Casino products as we both continue to grow. Richard Atkinson, global head of live casino, 888 Holdings</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Irina Cornides, Pragmatic Play’s chief operating officer, praised William Hill as a “huge global brand that needs no introduction.” She said that Pragmatic Play is happy about the opportunity to expand its existing relationship with the leading UK operator.</p>
<p>From traditional titles to vertical-spanning hybrid products, we’re immensely proud to create exceptional experiences, and can’t wait to deliver these to William Hill customers. Irina Cornides, COO, Pragmatic Play</p>
<p>In other news, Pragmatic Play recently strengthened its footprint in Switzerland via a deal with GAMRFIRST. Earlier, the company signed a major agreement with Bally’s Interactive, agreeing to supply live casino content to the global operator.</p>
