<p>Zeus God of Thunder review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Zeus seems to get far more slots about him than any other Greek God. Being the King is nice work if you can get it.</p>
<p>In Zeus God of Thunder, the game plays to just one of Zeus’ most famous traits: the lightning bolts. It rather ignores the promiscuity and habit of disguising himself as animals.</p>
<p>The background is evocative of Greek architecture and hints at Olympian heights, while the reels are largely decorated with generic symbols including – for unfathomable reasons – a lion. The gods move in mysterious ways.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The visuals appear to have been designed with great technical prowess but are poorly directed.</p>
<p>For example, the Background that appears at random behind symbols is used to trigger the bonus game but disappears into the mess of symbols in a way that makes the reels hard to read and robs the player of the growing tension of each symbol falling.</p>
<p>The end result is that the slot is initially quite pretty to look at but doesn’t hang together in the way a slot should.</p>
<p>The audio aspects are excellent with a strong and varied soundtrack of both music and sound effect cues.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Zeus God of Thunder is a five reel slot with four rows and thirty win lines.</p>
<p>The main spark of innovation is in the way the Bonus Wheels work (see below for full detail) and an Extra Bet feature can be activated, which increases the bet by 50% and increases the number of Backgrounds and Wild symbols in the base game and Free Spins available on the Bonus Wheels.</p>
<p>Beyond this, the gameplay is pretty typical and will not surprise any seasoned slot player.</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all other symbols.</p>
<p>If three or more symbols with the Background appear in adjacent reels and the same row, this triggers the Bonus feature. The player then gets a spin on the relevant wheel ("three in a row", "four in a row", etc…) and is awarded a bonus based on the spin’s outcome.</p>
<p>There are three possible Bonuses that can be won in the wheel. For the two lower-end wheels there is an additional symbol that wins you a spin on the wheel one "in a row" up.</p>
<p>The first bonus that can be won is Free Spins. More spins are available the higher the "in a row", from four to five spins for 3 in a row or six to twelve for the five to six reels. These numbers are higher if the player has the Extra Bet active.</p>
<p>The other bonuses are one spin with extra Wilds and or a selection of Jackpots that, like the free spins, are higher the more in a row the player hits and if the Extra Bet is active.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.05%, as close as makes no difference to our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.50 without the Extra Bet and $/£/€0.75 with the Extra Bet active. This goes up to a maximum of $/£/€75 per spin with the Extra Bet active.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is medium to high. This makes it a reasonable match for our preferred slot machine strategies, which target higher volatility slots.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Zeus God of Thunder is an interesting slot. The visuals and music are solid and the underlying maths is decent with an RTP of 96.05% and volatility in the medium to high range.</p>
<p>Another source of attraction for us is the system of Jackpots and Bonuses which is a fun combination and works to really elevate this game.</p>
<p>We strongly recommend this game.</p>
