<p>The 2023 Poker Stars Women’s Bootcamp starts on July 31, 2023, and will run through September 28, 2023. During that time, applicants will be able to take their first steps into the world of poker and gradually accumulate skills and strategies that can help them be more resilient and patient.</p>
<p>Overall, the Bootcamp has eight modules that focus on different aspects of poker. Besides learning strategies and skills related to poker, the inclusivity event can also help women become more decisive and improve their negotiation skills outside of the game.</p>
<p>The Event Helps Women Enter the World of Poker</p>
<p>Participants in the event will be able to access and learn from Poker Power instructors as well as the Poker Power Play app. PokerStars ambassadors, including Jennifer Shahade and Lali Tournier, among others, will also play a key role by delivering unique tips and insights.

<p>Putting learned strategies and knowledge into practice, women will play within the PokerStars Home Games. “The Bootcamp will lead to a crescendo tournament whereby a final table of recruits will win an all-expenses paid trip to EPT Cyprus this October to take part in the PokerStars x Poker Power Women’s Bootcamp Showdown to compete further for a special package to EPT Prague this December,” explained PokerStars.</p>
<p>“PokerStars shares our passion and commitment for the future of women in poker, so we are thrilled to be returning with our joint Bootcamp this year.“ Erin Lydon, president of Poker Power</p>
