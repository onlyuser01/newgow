<p>BetPARX, an established sports betting brand in Maryland, has teamed up with Playtech, a global leader in the provision of advanced gaming and betting platforms. Thanks to this partnership, Playtech will be able to deploy its advanced IMS platform, which now powers the newly launched betPARX mobile sportsbook and helps it run smoothly and efficiently.</p>
<p>This is an important next step for betPARX, which is looking to increase its presence in regulated sports betting markets with the Maryland launch fitting in this overall ambition. Apart from betPARX’s own achievement, Playtech is de facto launching in a fifth state with its advanced platform that allows sportsbooks to improve their performance and cater to local tastes.</p>
<p>Playtech VP of US Business Operations Jonathan Doubilet was excited about this new chance to see his company help betPARX with its forays in Maryland. It’s yet another proof of the company’s commitment to provide operators with the technology necessary to remain competitive, cater to their customers and generally create unique experiences that are worth everyone’s while.</p>
<p>Following the successful debut in Ohio, we are confident that our innovative solutions will once again deliver an unmatched sports betting experience in Maryland.</p>
<p>BetPARX SVP Interactive Gaming &amp; Sports Matthew Cullen was similarly excited to see this partnership shape up. He called Playtech’s technology one of the best and the tools it comes with precisely what the operator needs to deliver engaging and exceptional gaming experiences for its players.</p>
<p>BetPARX has been continuously strengthening its offer with the operator recently teaming up with EveryMatrix and expanding in Ontario, Canada earlier in the year to ensure that it remains a competitive and fast-growing brand in the competitive betting market.</p>
<p>Both companies are now focused on expanding their offering and footprint in the United States and North America. Playtech has also been offering solutions to the sports betting sector elsewhere. The company strengthened 10bet’s offering as well as that of DAZN Bet, a fast-growing operator of betting products, created with the blessing of the eponymous video on-demand and streaming platform, DAZN.</p>
