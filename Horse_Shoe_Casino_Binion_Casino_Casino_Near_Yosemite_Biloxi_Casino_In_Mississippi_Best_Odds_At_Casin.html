<p>GOS enhances Galaxy's operating system and the new features make it more attractive to existing and future partners</p>
<p>The world’s largest developer and distributor of casino table games, Galaxy Gaming, announced the launch of its next-generation game management system, the Galaxy Operating System (GOS).</p>
<p>Product of Extensive Table Games Progressives Knowledge</p>
<p>The launch of Galaxy Gaming’s new operating system is set to further enhance the attractiveness of the distributor of casino games, bonus systems and technology solutions to both the retail and online casino industry, introducing innovative progressive jackpot options, striking LED sensors and digital tracking.</p>
<p>Commenting on the launch, Todd Cravens, president and chief executive officer of Galaxy Gaming, noted that GOS is a product of the developer’s “extensive knowledge of table games progressives” which was paired “with a modern approach to table management systems” to come up with a “dynamic and scalable operating system.”</p>
<p>“We believe that this is greater than just a progressive system,” Cravens continued, outlining that GOS is “a full operating system designed to evolve with the industry,” the company’s partners, and most importantly, “with what players want.”</p>
<p>The world’s first Dynamic Progressive is set to blend with Galaxy Gaming’s most popular games and transform its renowned progressives by increasing pay alongside an exhilarating experience. In addition, the system supports digital tracking for Galaxy’s Roulette Up Progressive and Make’em All Progressive, as well as the Two-Way Dice Progressive.</p>
<p>Linking Tables on a Single Floor or across Several Casinos</p>
<p>The new operating system allows operators to run multiple jackpots on a wide range of table games with multi-game, tier and denomination progressive options. GOS also supports progressive jackpots with any of these configurations, linking multiple tables on a single floor or across several casinos.</p>
<p>The system also features vibrant sensors capable of instantly registering bets and allows for tables to be fitted with single, dual, or even triple progressive sensor bet spots. A modern UX not only supports these features but also allows for rapid deployment and streamlined field support, while the intuitive design of the dealer touch tablet and its easy-to-learn functions provide for a seamless jackpot procedure.</p>
<p>Designed as a full operating system, GOS is meant to continually evolve in line with advancements in hardware and software enhancements, and Galaxy Gaming is determined to present its next iteration of the system and its latest enhancements at G2E 2023.</p>
<p>Blueprint Gaming, a game studio in the UK owned by German’s Gauselmann Group, became a partner of the headquartered in Las Vegas Galaxy Gaming, after choosing Galaxy for its popular Side Bets features.</p>
<p>Aspers CasinoWestfield also recently teamed with the developer of casino table games to introduce its new 3 Dice Baccarat.</p>
