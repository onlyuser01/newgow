    <h1>Caesars Casino Michigan Potawatomi Bingo Casino Sweepstakes Casino No Deposit Bonus Red Dog Casino B</h1>

<p>Hi there!</p>
<p>Just to avoid a misunderstanding: is Gana 777 Casino the one you played in? Please take time to review it, then let me know. I'm quite convinced it is not the one.</p>
<p>Additionally, I feel it would be good to ask you whether you created a second account - did you?</p>
<p>Allow me to share our point of view when it comes to multiple account rules:</p>
<p>We accept that it is the responsibility of players to make sure that they don't create multiple accounts at the same casino. Not because we think it's the right way to do it, but because it's the industry standard, and we cannot penalize all casinos that don't enforce the 'one account per player' rule the way we consider best. However, we believe and hope that checking for duplicate accounts during account creation will become the industry standard in the future and players will be better protected.</p>
<p>In the meantime, each case should be considered separately. If the casino finds out that a player has created five separate accounts and claimed the full bonus amount on each of them, it is likely that this is a bonus abuser, and the casino has every right to penalize them. On the other hand, if a casual player mistakenly creates two accounts and doesn't even claim the bonus, the casino shouldn't penalize them just because it has a rule that can be used against them.</p>
<p>What about bonuses, did you take any?</p>
<p>I'll wait for your next update.</p>
