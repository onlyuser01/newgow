<p>Gaming Realms continues to deliver on exclusive gaming delights with the launch of its latest title, Slingo Superlinga, released in Romania</p>
<p>The new game has been launched in the Eastern European country with Superbet, a prominent operator in the local market in Romania. This game is uniquely developed for the operator, which is long-standing for Gaming Realms, and the rollout coincides with the return of SuperLiga.</p>
<p>Superbet Gives Itself a Seasonal Boost with Gaming Realms Slingo</p>
<p>The game itself has been created to captivate the joy of attending soccer games without actually leaving your home – or playing on the go, and not confined to a single venue. The title comes with numerous features and allows you to progress an increasing pay ladder.</p>
<p>This includes Wilds and Super Wilds, Free Spins for even more opportunities to win cash prizes, and more. Gaming Realms is using Slingo Superliga to demonstrate its ability to craft on-demand and bespoke gaming experiences that are designed to appeal to specific audiences and achieve a strong level of connection with their intended audiences.</p>
<p>Commenting on this new opportunity, Gaming Realms commercial account manager Ian Robson said that the company was very happy to continue working with Superbet and grow the Slingo family with a product that has been specifically tailored to the needs of the company’s player base. Robson added:</p>
<p>The release utilizes IP from Superliga, the leading football league in Romania, and will create opportunities for Superbet to cross-sell to players that are traditionally football fans. We are elated to be kicking off the football season with this release. Gaming Realms commercial account manager Ian Robson</p>
<p>Superbet head of gaming &amp; live casino Nick Yu was similarly pleased with the opportunity and what it meant for his company. He described the Romanian market as a highly-competitive one where differentiation matters a lot and where it’s crucial to continue innovating the experience in order to achieve a stronger presence.</p>
<p>Gaming Realms Determined to Continue Growing</p>
<p>Gaming Realms has been able to deliver on a strongly localized title that enjoys the popularity of SuperLiga and that will definitely give Superbet a strong start with the new soccer season, Yu concluded.</p>
<p>Gaming Realms has been busy growing its footprint in the region as well as the world. In Europe specifically, the company has been able to establish several important partnerships in Spain. One of those was with Goldenpark.es and the other – with SkillOnNet which tapped into the company’s Slingo offer to strengthen its content library in the country.</p>
