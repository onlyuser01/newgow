<p>The unexpected move drew significant criticism as opponents claim the Tribe attempted to distract the public from their true intentions and present online betting as a fait accompli</p>
<p>In a legal showdown, West Flagler Associates has petitioned the Florida Supreme Court to halt the Seminole Tribe’s plans for statewide sports betting, throwing a new curveball just as the Tribe announced the relaunch of its mobile sports betting app. West Flagler Associates argued that the Tribe’s statewide betting monopoly exceeded constitutional boundaries.</p>
<p>Opponents Have Already Rallied in Resistance</p>
<p>The legal maneuver comes shortly after the Seminole Tribe’s announcement that in-person sports betting would resume at its casinos in December. The US Supreme Court’s decision not to block a $2.5 billion compact between the Tribe and the state paved the way for sports betting in Florida, but the launch of Hard Rock Bets surprised most industry stakeholders.</p>
<p>The Tribe’s sudden move to reintroduce its mobile sports betting app led West Flagler Associates to file a new challenge. The petition contends that the Tribe overstepped its constitutional authority by expanding casino gambling without citizens’ approval. West Flagler Associates is seeking an immediate suspension of the off-reservation sports betting provisions.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of the distraction created by their carefully crafted announcement on 1 November, the Tribe has sought to… present a ‘fait accompli’ on 7 November. West Flagler Associates court statement</p>
<p>The group advocates for a return to the status quo of no sports betting statewide until courts issue final rulings in the ongoing court cases related to this matter. West Flagler argued that the relaunch would allow the tribes to make millions in profit despite the possibility of the court ruling against their monopoly.</p>
<p>Florida Sports Betting May Still Be Some Ways Away</p>
<p>West Flagler’s motion is the latest development in an epic two-year legal dispute regarding the 2021 gambling deal between Gov. Ron DeSantis and the Seminole Tribe of Florida. Commercial gambling interests led by West Flagler Associates opposed the Tribe’s monopoly from the onset, forcing it to suspend its wagering offerings shortly after its official 2021 start.</p>
<p>Gambling compact opponents claim that it violates the constitution by allowing the Seminole to offer gambling on non-tribal land. West Flagler has waged a protracted legal campaign in federal court, but the proceedings’ glacial progress likely emboldened the Tribe to relaunch their offerings and take control of the situation.</p>
<p>As legal battles unfold, the Florida Supreme Court finds itself at the center of a high-stakes dispute that could significantly impact the state’s sports betting trajectory. With both sides presenting their arguments, the court’s decision will be instrumental in shaping the landscape of Florida’s sports wagering industry and establishing the extent of tribal authority in gambling.</p>
