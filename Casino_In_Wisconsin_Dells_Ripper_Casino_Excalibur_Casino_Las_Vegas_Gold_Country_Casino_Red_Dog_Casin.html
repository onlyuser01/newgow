<p>Viant, a leading people-based advertising technology company, has released a new White Paper focused on the benefits of executing full-funnel marketing campaigns to stand out in the fast-evolving US sports betting market</p>
<p>The White Paper, “Full-Funnel Marketing Tactics for Casino &amp; Sports Betting Ad Campaigns,” focuses on the unique challenges that casino and sports betting marketers face in reaching new and potential sports bettors across numerous devices and media. To this end, Viant utilizes its dedicated people-based omnichannel Adelphic DSP that allows companies to create more impactful, targeted, efficient campaigns — and measure their impact.</p>
<p>Sign Up to Download the White Paper</p>
<p>Viant’s Adelphic DSP is designed to ensure marketers can sharpen targeting capabilities by onboarding first-party data of their high-value customers or leveraging third-party data partners to reach the right in-market customers with their campaigns.</p>
<p>To prove the return on investment for those campaigns, the company’s Advanced Reporting capabilities provide cross-channel measurement for in-app downloads and purchases as easily as in-person sales and visitations, covering both interactive and land-based sports wagering markets.</p>
<p>Viant’s White Paper also takes a deeper look at how sports betting is changing in the digital era, using Super Bowl LVII in February as an example. More than 113 million viewers tuned in to watch the Big Game, making it the second most-watched game in history.</p>
<p>In terms of betting activity, the Big Game attracted 50,000 bets per minute from 2 million active users for brands such as FanDuel. Super Bowl LVII was also the most bet-on event in history, according to information shared by MGM Resorts and BetMGM, in terms of sports wagering handle combining both the land-based and online betting verticals.</p>
<p>Viant saw examples of smart advertisement in the weeks and days leading up to the actual game, with DraftKings promoting its brand through a $500,000 prize pool campaign. This is just one of the many examples of adapting marketing that has been necessitated by companies that want to stay competitive.</p>
<p>Get the White Paper today to learn more about how Viant’s people-based advertising approach can help marketers execute and measure full-funnel campaigns in the rapidly evolving U.S. sports betting market.</p>
