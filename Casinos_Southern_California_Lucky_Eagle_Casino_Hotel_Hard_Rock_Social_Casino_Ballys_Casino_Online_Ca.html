<p>Bally’s Corporation continues to diligently follow the strategy to become the first truly vertically integrated sports betting and interactive entertainment company after the Standard hedge fund-led business announced the acquisition of free-to-play (F2P) game provider SportCaller.</p>
<p>“I am delighted to welcome SportCaller to Bally’s Interactive alongside Bet.Works and Monkey Knife Fight.” George Papanier, President and CEO, Bally’s Corporation</p>
<p>Another Piece of the Puzzle</p>
<p>The acquisition of one of the leading F2P game providers for sports betting businesses and media operators across the globe falls in line with recent deals Bally’s entered to acquire betting technology supplier Bet.Works and daily fantasy sports (DFS) operator Monkey Knife Fight (MKF), as well as the partnership deal with Sinclair Broadcast Group.</p>
<p>The deep technology and product expertise in the field of F2P SportCaller brings to Bally’s will complement with the technology stack from Bet.Works and will enable the company to offer its own F2P games this year.</p>
<p>“F2P products represent a core component of our interactive strategy to drive user acquisition to Bally’s ecosystem.” George Papanier, President and CEO, Bally’s Corporation</p>
<p>SportCaller’s product offering consisting of prediction, quiz/trivia, pay-to-play and bespoke and turn-key application games offered to businesses in North America, Europe, UK, Australia, LATAM and Africa, won the firm two Acquisition and Retention Partner Award recognitions in 2020, from EGR B2B and from SBC.</p>
<p>“SportCaller offers unique products and I am confident that its pioneering platform and deep international expertise will significantly contribute to our growing interactive platforms.” George Papanier, President and CEO, Bally’s Corporation</p>
<p>Player Acquisition and Retention Tool</p>
<p>Bally’s will utilize F2P games as a player engagement tool in states where sports betting is legalized, as well as in jurisdictions which currently do not allow wagering on sports, where Sinclair’s media reach will come into play and help expand Bally’s player database and provide excitement and fun for users of its sports betting app.</p>
<p>“Joining Bally’s is a milestone moment for the SportCaller team. I look forward to working with Bally’s talented team as we continue to create an innovative F2P product that engages sports fans on a global scale.” Cillian Barry, Founder and MD, SportCaller</p>
<p>SportCaller and its technology development center comprising of more than 40 technology resources will fuse into Bally’s Interactive division, while SportCaller’s product offering of more than 100 games across 30 sports in 37 countries and in more than 20 languages will significantly expand Bally’s international footprint.</p>
<p>Bally’s Corporation did not provide details regarding the financial aspect of the acquisition deal.</p>
