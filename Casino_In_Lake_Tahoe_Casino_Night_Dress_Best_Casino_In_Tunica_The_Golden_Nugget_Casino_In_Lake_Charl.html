<p>Stakelogic, a provider of slots and live dealer games has unveiled a major content deal with Paf. Under the agreement, the supplier will power the operator’s offering in several European regions. This agreement with a leading operator will help Stakelogic cement its position as a leading B2B company in Europe.</p>
<p>As per the deal, some of Stakelogic’s best games will become available to Paf clients in several regulated markets. This includes a selection of live casino games, such as Stakelogic Live’s freshly-launched Super Stake Blackjack. Other games include live roulette and game show-styled titles. The live casino games, streamed from Stakelogic’s studio in Malta, will become available to Paf customers in Estonia, Sweden and Finland.</p>
<p>In addition, Paf will adopt Stakelogic’s acclaimed slot games, which include fan favorites such as Super Bonus Wild, Runner 8 Runner, Bonus Runner, Super 6 Timer and Mega Runner. These games will become available to clients in Spain, Latvia, Estonia, Sweden and Finland.</p>
<p>The agreement between the two parties also covers Stakelogic’s suite of video slots, which include exciting titles like Cash Express, Wild Buzz, El Cowboy Megaways, Devil’s Trap and Star StaxxTM. All of these titles feature unique mechanics, such as Wilds, Multiplier and Free Spins, among others.</p>
<p>Quite a few of the games that Paf will now be able to offer to its customers also include Stakelogic’s proprietary and innovative Spin To Win mechanic. The feature in question establishes a Live Progressive Jackpot System that triggers every few minutes for a randomly picked player. The luckiest of gamblers can thus trigger the jackpot, which adds extra spice to the Stakelogic experience.</p>
<p>A Key Integration for Stakelogic</p>
<p>Representatives from the two companies commented on the new agreement. Eric Castro, Paf’s head of content, casino &amp; games, described Stakelogic as an “important provider for any operator” and praised its extensive portfolio. Castro noted that the Stakelogic games are engaging and entertaining and will help Paf differentiate itself from its competitors.</p>
<p>It’s integrations such as this that allow us to stand out from our competitors in the markets where we are active, and we look forward to seeing our players enjoy the thrills and excitement that Stakelogic’s games are renowned for. Eric Castro, head of content, casino &amp; games, Paf</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Olga Bajela, Stakelogic’s chief commercial officer, lauded Paf as an operator everyone has heard of. She noted that the agreement with the gambling juggernaut is a great development for her company.</p>
<p>The success of a studio is reflected in the caliber of its operator partners, and Paf is a renowned brand that knows exactly how to deliver compelling experiences to its players. The addition of our games to its lobby will allow it to elevate this experience further. Olga Bajela, CCO, Stakelogic</p>
<p>The current deal follows another exciting integration. Two days ago, Stakelogic also launched content in the United Kingdom thanks to an agreement with BetVictor.</p>
