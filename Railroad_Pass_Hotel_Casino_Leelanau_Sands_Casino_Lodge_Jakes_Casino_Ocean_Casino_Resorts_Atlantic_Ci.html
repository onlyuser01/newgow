    <h1>Railroad Pass Hotel Casino Leelanau Sands Casino Lodge Jakes Casino Ocean Casino Resorts Atlantic Ci</h1>

<p>Nobody reports that. In addition, the casino allows you to bet more, when it could limit your bet, just as it automatically withholds the bonus money or unlocks it for you by betting it x40 times.</p>
<p>It is a tactic to confiscate the profit of the players.</p>
<p>There are many complaints for the same reason on the internet, forums and others.</p>
<p>I cannot access the history because since that day it has not allowed me to enter the website.</p>
<p>I have written to the email info@curacao-egaming.com , I do not know if it is the correct site, reporting the case. I'm going to report where necessary, I'm not going to stop until I get my money back.</p>
<p>They also say that they returned my initial income. Why? They wanted to shut me up.</p>
<p>In addition, I have requested the reinstatement of those 60 euros of initial deposit and first they send me an email saying that it has been approved and then they tell me that my bank has rejected the deposit that they were going to make me. I have asked in my bank and it is a lie.</p>
<p>It is a common practice of this Casino.</p>
<p>I am a regular player of many web casinos, and many with a license in Curucao because I like live blackjack and I have never had such problems with any of them.</p>
<p>It is clear that from this incident I will only play on portals in Spain and I will report this incident in all possible forums.</p>
<p>I attach a photo where it clearly states that they come loaded with good news, that it has been approved. And then they cancel it.</p>
<p>I have read comments from other players on this portal and the same thing happens to them. Others have been waiting more than 3 weeks for the deposit in their account.</p>
<p>They keep the players' money. watch out!!!!!!!</p>
