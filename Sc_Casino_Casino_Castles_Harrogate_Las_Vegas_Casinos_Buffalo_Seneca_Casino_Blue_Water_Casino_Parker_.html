    <h1>Sc Casino Casino Castles Harrogate Las Vegas Casinos Buffalo Seneca Casino Blue Water Casino Parker</h1>

<p>THIS CASINO IS BULLSHIT!</p>
<p>*Be sure you don't have multiple accounts.</p>
<p>... I was kicked out of my home at the time. BAM my phone quit working. Acquired one and was checking an email from Lucky Tiger and went to login and my credentials were wrong. Plus it wasn't my phone so I had no saved info to use. So I hit forgot username, forgot password and typed in a new one. Began playing. This was November 2022. Mind you I've gotten email notifications from this casino on my original account for years now. Skip to present. I just won $450 on a ND bonus. Well it took me an hour to even get to play because now I DONT HAVE THE PHONÃ‰ USED WHEN I CHANGED MY INFO. so I hit forgot password, forgot username and changed it again back to my original info because now I have my original phone back. I go to withdraw and can't. I start a live chat with HEATHER and I'm told I have multiple accounts. No I don't! I explained to no avail. She just completely quit replying. Ended the chat. I called and explained again. Same answer. FYI... he tells me it's the same info on both accounts. Duh! I was trying to login. I wasn't trying to be sneaky. Sorry money is no good. You just have to use it for fun play and it was a nd bonus so you didn't make a deposit. WTF kinda shit is that? It was free from y'all. If it could be withdrawn our max is $100! OMG this has got to be a scam casino. I asked for a new ND bonus of $450 and I would meet the wagering amount of $1000 on that and then withdraw my winnings. I'm sorry. I can't do that. So now im screwed. They want you to deposit for their gain. When you withdraw you can't even get your winnings. This goes for anyone and everyone.</p>
<p>DONT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY. YOU GET NO REWARD.</p>
