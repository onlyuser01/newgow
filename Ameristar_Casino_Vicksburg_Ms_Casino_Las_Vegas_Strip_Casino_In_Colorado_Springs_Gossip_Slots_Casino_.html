    <h1>Ameristar Casino Vicksburg Ms Casino Las Vegas Strip Casino In Colorado Springs Gossip Slots Casino</h1>

<p>Dear Cheryl,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. Please understand this casino has a Very Bad reputation and operates with a Curacao license, which is not considered the best on market.</p>
<p>Also, the variety and accessibility of payment methods are not managed by the casino exclusively. Several factors as geolocation, and contracts with the payment providers and bank restrictions, all have a major influence. Therefore this doesn’t necessarily have to be the casino’s mistake. Not to mention that exchange rates are completely out of the casino’s hands.</p>
<p>Regarding the problem with games - I want to inform you that we cannot make a case solely based on what you are describing. Sometimes you might get lucky and sometimes not; that's how casinos and casino games work. I would recommend reading our article about Payout ratio (RTP): https://casino.guru/learn-about-games-of-chance-rtp-variance.</p>
<p>If you have more information that would help our case, please forward it to me. Unfortunately, at this time, if we don’t have any evidence proving that something unfair is going on, there is nothing we can do</p>
<p>I apologize, but in this case, if you have already played and lost all your funds, we are not able to help you and we don’t see any chance for a successful deposit refund. If there is any balance left, I would suggest you stop playing, withdraw your funds as soon as possible, and look for another casino with a better reputation.</p>
<p>I can only recommend you to do better research next time and play only in casinos licensed by the UKGC authority to avoid such situations.</p>
<p>Please let me know if there is any additional information that I have overlooked, but I’m afraid I will be forced to reject your complaint. Thank you in advance for your reply and understanding.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Kristina</p>
