<p>While the Seneca Nation secured an approval from the New York state Senate for a new gaming compact, its future remains uncertain, given that the Assembly needs to also greenlight it</p>
<p>The Seneca Nation is planning the renewal of its gaming compact with New York State and the negotiations continue to gain traction. Previously, the compact received the approval of the state Senate, yet, the Assembly would also need to vote and possibly approve the gaming compact.</p>
<p>In light of this, lawmakers from Rochester recently met with the Governor’s office to discuss their concerns regarding the planned renewal of Seneca Nation’s gaming compact and the potential of a casino located in the Rochester area, News10NBC revealed.</p>
<p>“Today, the Greater Rochester Majority Delegation met with representatives from the Governor’s office to discuss the Seneca Nation’s gaming compact renewal and proposed placement of a casino in Rochester.“ Assemblyman Harry Bronson</p>
<p>Assemblyman Harry Bronson explained that the Greater Rochester Majority Delegation is currently in talks with all involved parties regarding the gaming compact, including the Mayor’s office, as well as local stakeholders. Moreover, speaking on behalf of Rochester lawmakers, he outlined that any agreement between the Seneca Nation and New York state must be transparent and provide enough information.</p>
<p>“The Delegation is conducting full due diligence on this matter and is having conversations with all concerned parties, including local stakeholders, the County Executive, the Mayor’s office, and other government partners.“ Assemblyman Harry Bronson</p>
<p>Lawmakers, Concerned about the Impact a Casino Project May Have</p>
<p>One of the main concerns of the Rochester lawmakers is the potential impact of a casino project in the area. “We are particularly concerned about how this could affect the families we represent,” wrote Bronson.</p>
<p>The text of Seneca Nation’s gaming compact doesn’t explicitly state that a casino would be created. However, Bronson claimed that there is such an option for the market in Rochester. While this doesn’t mean that a casino project, if such gains traction at all, would be located within the city, it was still enough to raise concerns for the lawmakers from Rochester.</p>
