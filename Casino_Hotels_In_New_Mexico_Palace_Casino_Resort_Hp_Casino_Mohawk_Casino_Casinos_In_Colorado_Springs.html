<p>The leading international gaming and betting group that currently operates in Italy via the brand Planetwin365, SKS365, was recognized as one of the leading employers for 2024 in the country. Last week, the company confirmed it was recognized as a Top Employer 2024 in Italy by the Top Employers Institute for excellence in HR policies and strategies.</p>
<p>The prestigious acknowledgment represents the second time SKS365 has secured the certification, highlighting its dedication toward best workplace practices. Moreover, the certification reaffirms the company's effective policies for improving the working environment and ensuring the well-being of its employees.</p>
<p>To secure the certification, the Top Employers Institute analyzed data from SKS365's participation in the HR Best Practices Survey. There are some 20 different topics within the survey, including questions related to learning, work environment, diversity, equity and inclusion, people strategy and more.</p>
<p>David Plink, Top Employers Institute's CEO, commented on the topic in a statement. "Exceptional times bring out the best in people and organizations. And we have witnessed this in our Top Employers Certification Program this year: exceptional performance from the certified Top Employers 2024," he revealed.</p>
<p>Speaking about the employers on the list, Plink said that they are recognized for their efforts toward employee well-being and the development of their workforce. Recognizing their important efforts, he explained in conclusion: "We are proud to announce and celebrate this year’s group of leading people-oriented employers: the Top Employers 2024."</p>
<p>Brian Dean, SKS365's Chief People Officer, was similarly excited. "The confirmation of the Top Employers certification is a significant recognition of SKS365’s ongoing commitment to promoting and developing a people-centric corporate culture," he added. Finally, Dean said: "Being accredited again is in some ways, an even greater achievement than last year, given everything on the agenda of the company in 2023. As in sports, winning is challenging, but maintaining that success is even harder."</p>
<p>In the summer, SKS365 announced a partnership with G Games, the leading iGaming content supplier. Under the terms of the strategic partnership, G Games expanded the reach of its games by agreeing to supply them for SKS365's Planetwin365 brand.</p>
<p>Strengthening its brand, the company brought a number of high-quality and popular titles from G Games. Overall, more than 100 games from the iGaming supplier supercharged Planetwin365's offering, promising exceptional experiences and unrivaled entertainment. At the same time, the collaboration grew G Games' reach, allowing its titles to engage with new customers.</p>
