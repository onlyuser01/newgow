<p>It has been revealed that Gordon Ramsay has applied for a gaming trademark with the UK’s Intellectual Property Office.</p>
<p>Gordon Ramsay Applies for UK Trademark in Gaming</p>
<p>Gordon Ramsay’s name is attached to a huge media empire, with a wide range of shows under his belt. Now, he’s going to be moving into the online gaming realm, after it’s been revealed that he has applied with the UK Intellectual Property Office for a trademark that will cover casino, gambling and betting games.</p>
<p>Little else is known about his online gambling ventures but we’re excited to see what comes of this application. While it might seem like an unlikely pairing, plenty of other celebrities and media brands have launched online gaming products.</p>
<p>Online Bingo Brands</p>
<p>In the online bingo world, there have been a number of media companies that have launched sites. Sun Bingo is a site associated with the newspaper brand, while Heart Bingo has been created by the UK radio station of the same name. There is even a Say Yes to the Dress Bingo site, based on the hit TLC television show.</p>
<p>Each of these sites runs of different software, like Dragonfish and Virtue Fusion. However, they all feature similar products that allow players to enjoy slots and bingo games online.</p>
<p>So, it wouldn’t be outside of the realm of possibility for Gordon Ramsay to create a branded online bingo or casino site based on Hell’s Kitchen. In fact, “Hell’s Kitchen Casino” does have a nice ring to it.</p>
<p>Online Slots Potential</p>
<p>There is also the possibility that Ramsay could be looking to make an online slots game about himself. A wide of online slot titles are based on athletes and musical artists, including horseracing’s Frankie Dettori and rock ‘n roll legends like Elvis Presley and Jimi Hendrix.</p>
<p>Another possibility would be for the game to be based on one of his television series. Reality shows have spawned quite a few online casino games, including Love Island, X Factor and I’m A Celebrity; Get Me Out of Here.</p>
<p>There has never been an online slots game based on a celebrity chef before, though. So, we’re excited to see how Gordon Ramsay’s game will turn out.</p>
<p>At the moment, members of the gaming community can only speculate how Gordon Ramsay plans to integrate himself or his brands into the online casino or online bingo world, even though there are some possibilities that are more likely than others. Whatever he does choose, it will surely be a successful venture – just like every other enterprise he has pursued.</p>
