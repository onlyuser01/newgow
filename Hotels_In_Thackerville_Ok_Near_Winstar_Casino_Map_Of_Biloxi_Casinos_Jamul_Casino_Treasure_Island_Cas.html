<p>The two companies go back more than a decade with Kambi and Paf originally partnering in 2011 and having maintained a robust partnership ever since</p>
<p>As a result, the two companies are expanding their online sportsbook partnership once again as part of a newly-negotiated contract. This is essentially a renewal of the companies’ existing relationship and will see both Kambi and Paf continue to benefit from each other’s respective offer.</p>
<p>Kambi Expands on Decade-Long Partnership with Paf</p>
<p>Paf will continue to rely on Kambi’s stellar platform in the provision of leading sports betting solutions across its target markets in Europe. Paf is present in several high-profile jurisdictions across the continent, including Finland, Sweden, Latvia, Estonia, and Spain.</p>
<p>Paf also runs No Account Bet and Speedy Bet, which are sub-brands based in Sweden, and which are also benefiting from the Kambi technological expertise and prowess.</p>
<p>Commenting on this new chapter in the companies’ mutual relationship, Kambi CEO and Co-founder Kristian Nylén said that he was delighted to see the rapport extended. He added:</p>
<p>Paf was the first partner we signed when Kambi was founded and the fact they remain a Kambi partner to this day is a testament to the strength of our leading sportsbook technology.</p>
<p>Kim Johansson, chief gaming officer at Paf, welcomed the opportunity to see Kambi continue to play the important role it has for the past ten years for more years to come. Johansson said that Kambi’s betting clients and broad suite of great products have been instrumental in ensuring that the Paf brand and sub-brands remain competitive and continue to develop in key markets.</p>
<p>Kambi has been doing very well over the past several months. The company managed to initiate a share buyback program and enhance its long-term value and repaid the outstanding €7.5 million Kindred Group convertible bond.</p>
<p>Kambi Group Posts Strong Results and Continues to Deploy Tech</p>
<p>Kambi similarly saw very strong results during the first quarter of the year. Revenue for the company hit €44 million or $48.6 million for the three-month period ended on March 31, marking a gain on the results in the first quarter of 2022.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Kambi Group similarly entered into a partnership with Bally’s Corporation to help bolster the company’s digital arm, Bally Bet, and deploy sports betting and technological stack which Bally’s now wants to outsource. Bally’s will also obtain a license to a limited part of Kambi’s source code.</p>
