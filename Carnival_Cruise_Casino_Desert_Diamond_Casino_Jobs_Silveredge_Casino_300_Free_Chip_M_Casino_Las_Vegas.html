<p>Play’n GO’s commitment to responsible and safer gambling is unshakable as attested by the company’s latest award, the Safer Gambling Standard Gold** Award, which is granted to companies that are developing or have adopted a range of safer gambling measures intended at exceeding the social responsibility provisions of their operational licenses.</p>
<p>This silverware is a testament to the company’s ongoing commitment to provide not only some of the market’s best and most innovative games, but also to ensure that the Play’n GO’s titles are ultimately played in a safe and responsible way.</p>
<p>Play’n GO passed muster against a tight field of competitors and was judged by GamCare, which runs The Safer Gambling Standard initiative, and is an unbiased entity that focuses on only distinguishing genuine accomplishments in the realm of responsible gambling.</p>
<p>GamCare has created the standard to incentivize businesses to try and do better when addressing matters of social responsibility and responsible gambling in general. The distinction is an important accolade which is only awarded to companies that have a proven track record of ensuring that through their involvement in the gambling industry, they actively strive to protect consumers from experiencing gambling-related harm.</p>
<p>Addressing this significant moment in the company’s history, Play’n GO Co-Founder and CEO Johan Törnqvist welcomed the opportunity to see his company in a pole position to lead the industry towards "a safer, sustainable and more secure future."</p>
<p>"This award is the product of a wealth of work behind the scenes that often goes unnoticed and I’m enormously proud of everyone involved at Play’n GO," Törnqvist added. The executive assured that Play’n GO’s commitment to making gambling safer for everyone was unwavering and an ongoing mission, part of the company’s grander strategy and ambition for leading the way in the industry for others.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Play’n GO has continued to expand in new markets, with the company recently securing a B2B license from Sweden, as the company’s domestic market is currently in the process of passing and enforcing regulatory changes. Play’n GO was also cleared and approved to join another market recently, to wit Spain.</p>
<p>GamCare has been actively involved in helping guide the dialogue around problem gambling in the United Kingdom. The charity recently published an in-depth report on how the current cost of living crisis and its impact on gambling rates, participation, and consumer behavior.</p>
