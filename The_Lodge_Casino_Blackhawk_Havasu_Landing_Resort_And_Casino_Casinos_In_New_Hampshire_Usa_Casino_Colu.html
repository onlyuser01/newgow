<p>Kambi Group plc has confirmed that it will bring its advanced platform solutions to empower the online and retail sportsbook for Svenska Spel Sport &amp; Casino, which is one of the iGaming and land-based leaders in the gambling industry in Sweden.</p>
<p>Moving forward, Svenska Spel Sport &amp; Casino will benefit from Kambi’s Complete sportsbook product. The partnership accounts for the strict regulatory regime in the country, which expects from brands and platform providers to follow the Spelinspektionen-issued rules to the letter.</p>
<p>Kambi is also happy to see this partnership take place as it will most likely have a significant impact on the company’s bottom line with the earliest results of the tie-up to be seen in the second half of 2024.</p>
<p>Apart from using its own Complete sportsbook solution, Kambi is similarly bringing on board Shape Games, a subsidiary, which will be specifically tasked with optimizing Svenska Spel Sport &amp; Casino’s new sportsbook experience and its front-end in particular.</p>
<p>Commenting on this exciting launch for the company, Kambi CEO and Co-Founder Kristian Nylén said that Svenska Spel makes a perfect partner, as one of the most easily recognizable names in Swedish sports betting. He hailed the opportunity to now serve as the operator’s long-term sportsbook provider, which will bring dividends to both partnerships.</p>
<p>Calling this significant milestone, Nylén added that the tie-up with Svenska Spel Sport &amp; Casino would strengthen the company’s presence in what it considers a core market, help it grow organically, and signal to potential future partners its advantages.</p>
<p>Shape Games Chief Commercial Officer Morten Tonnesen was similarly excited to see his company collaborate so closely with one of the most formidable names in the Swedish iGaming and sports betting markets. Tonnesen assured that Shape Games will work to improve the sports betting user experience and leverage the company’s proven front-end tech to build the ecosystem that Svenska Spel players deserve.</p>
<p>Not least, Svenska Spel Sport &amp; Casino Head of Product Sports Betting Dan Korhonen wrapped up by adding that the shift towards a new platform has been a thorough and carefully weighed process that saw many other companies also vie for the spot of a sportsbook supplier. Yet, in the end, it was Kambi the decision went with.</p>
<p>"This partnership will further strengthen our offering. We look forward to launching our new Oddset sportsbook next year where focus will be on accommodating our customers on a new level," Korhonen wrapped up.</p>
