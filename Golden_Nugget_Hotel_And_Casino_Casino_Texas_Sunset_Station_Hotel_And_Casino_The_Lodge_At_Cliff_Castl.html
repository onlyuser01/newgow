<p>In a new report, the gambling regulator in Nevada released figures regarding the performance of nonrestricted gambling locations that offer slots, table, counter and card games</p>
<p>The gambling regulator in Nevada, the Nevada Gaming Control Board (NGCB) has announced its latest revenue report, outlining details regarding the performance of nonrestricted gambling locations across the state for June. Although it was a busy month for operators in the state, the total revenue reported by table, counter and card games, along with slot machines, saw a slight decrease year-over-year. Last month, the total revenue halted at $1.25 billion, representing a 2.44% decrease when compared to the corresponding period a year ago.</p>
<p>A breakdown provided by the NGCB reveals that slots’ revenue last month dipped slightly, while table, counter and card games’ revenue decreased by nearly 7%. Judging by the recent report, the total revenue reported by table, counter and card games this June halted at $409.6 million. A comparison to the same period in 2022 shows that this year, the revenue decreased by 6.53%. When it comes to slot machines, the revenue reported by nonrestricted locations in Nevada was $836.2 million, marking a decrease of 0.31%.</p>
<p>The quarterly performance, encompassing the three months between April and June 30, 2023, showed that total gaming revenue dipped slightly by 0.30% to $3.69 billion. While slot machines’ revenue for the period hit $2.6 billion, up by 1.54%, the revenue from table, counter and card games decreased by 4.18% to $1.14 billion.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the gambling regulator in Nevada issued a warning regarding a rise in scams targeting casinos. The latest scams involve people that pretend to be senior-level representatives of the casino management, trying to deceive employees to obtain large sums of cash. Only recently the aforementioned scheme resulted in losses of $1.17 million for one gambling operator.</p>
<p>Revenue for the Last 12 Months Marks an Increase</p>
<p>Focusing once again on the latest results, a comparison of the figures from the last 12 months through June 30, 2023, showed an increase in the total gambling revenue reported by nonrestricted casino locations in Nevada. Overall, the total revenue for that period hit $15.1 billion, representing a 3.25% increase when compared to the same period the prior year.</p>
<p>A breakdown of that result shows that slot machine revenue grew by 4% to $10.2 billion. On the other hand, an increase in table, counter and card games revenue was also observed which hit $4.9 billion, up by nearly 2% when compared to the same period last year.</p>
