<p>Richmond Raceway is the next stop in the eNASCAR iRacing Series with Will Byron coming in hot from his latest victory and Timmy Hill listed as a close second. No racer has won two events. With three more races left, the odds look promising for Hill and Byron to repeat their previous success.</p>
<p>Richmond Raceway Gets Underway on Sunday, April 19</p>
<p>eNASCAR iRacing is heading for the next event at the Richmond Raceway on Sunday, April 19. NASCAR was forced to turn to SIM racing after the regular season was suspended due to the COVID-19 outbreak, but things have gone quite well for the organization with some 1.3 million people happily tuning in to watch simulated racing.</p>
<p>Your weekend is booked!</p>

<p>Bar last week’s incident with Kyle Larson, who said a racial slur on live stream, prompting his team and sponsor to drop him, NASCAR’s reputation has been spotless, and the event a joy to watch.</p>
<p>Sunday will bring the Toyota Owners 150 Presented By Toyota event with a whole bunch of SIM drivers given very good odds to win. Will Byron and Timmy Hill are neck-and-neck for the first spot, with the odds favoring Bill slightly.</p>
<p>NASCAR iRacing Odds: Richmond Raceway</p>
<p>Racer Odds Will Byron +225 Timmy Hill +500 Garrett Smithley +1000 Dale Earnhardt Jr. +1200 Denny Hamlin +1200 John Hunter Nemecheck +1400 Ryan Preece +1400 Alex Bowman +1600 Parker Kligerman +1600 Landon Cassill +1800 Matt DiBenedetto +2000 Christopher Bell +2500 Clint Bowyer +2500 Michael McDowell +2500 Chris Buescher +3300 Joey Logano +3300 Kyle Busch +3300 Ross Chastain +3300 Bobby Labonte +4000 Bubba Wallace +4000 Chase Elliott +4000 Erik Jones +4000 Kurt Busch +5000 Austin Dillon +6600 Jimmie Johnson +6600 Ricky Stenhouse Jr. +6600 Ty Dillon +6600</p>
<p>Updated April 17, 2020</p>
<p>The odds paint a familiar picture. During Bristol, both Will Byron and Timmy Hill were posted at (+400), giving them a flip-of-the-coin chance to seal the title, and the sportsbooks weren’t wrong at all.</p>
<p>Byron jumped on the pedals to race through the pixelated finish line first on his simulated Chevrolet outpacing Hill and the runner-up, John H. Nemecheck.</p>
<p>Hill finished 3rd and Denny Hamlin, the driver to win the inaugural Homestead-Miami Speedway race, found himself in fourth place. To help you clear up your doubts a little, check out the eNASCAR power rankings as well.</p>
<p>All in all, this is to say that the elite of eNASCAR has been established with the three winners still given some pretty decent odds to make the finishing line first. Byron and Timmy Hill, however, are once again in pole position.</p>
<p>This time around Byron has (+225) and Timmy Hill is second with (+500). Interestingly, Namecheck is posted at (+1400) despite his lucky break with second place in Bristol. Once again, Sunday’s race seems tipped for some racing excellence as is.</p>

<p>Kyle Larson Gets Tossed Out</p>
<p>Following the Easter Break, the eNASCAR racing herd is leaner, after Kyle Larson had the misfortune to use a racial slur on live stream. This got him fired by Chip Ganassi Racing</p>

<p>Yet, the community was divided over whether Larson’s use of one specific word should cost him his career.</p>
<p>His suspension led to some opportunistic proposition bets from sportsbooks, with the bookies asking players to bet on whether a driver would use a racial slur during a race.</p>
<p>This is a bet that good taste would advise against.</p>
<p>Whom to Bet on for eNASCAR iRacing Richmond Raceway?</p>
<p>If you are looking for consistency, Timmy Hill might be one of those notable individuals to back. There are only three non-professional drivers who have entered in the esports race to try to take on the pros, and Hill is one of them.</p>
<p>Slick Bill or Timmy Hill?</p>
<p>Take a look at who sits atop the eNASCAR iRacing Pro Invitational Power Rankings: https://t.co/ItMxCG7no9 pic.twitter.com/gF3NhVMl7h — NASCAR (@NASCAR) April 16, 2020</p>
<p>He has been able to deliver consistently and even though he has only won once, his odds look very good at clinching at least one victory, so why not start with eNASCAR iRacing Richmond Raceway on Sunday?</p>
