<p>Peter's Universe review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>J M Barrie’s beloved children’s classic is familiar to most of us through the Disney classic and the long-running stage adaptations.</p>
<p>Now you can enjoy the story again in slot machine form, this time with a cyber-punk twist. A dystopian neon lit London is rendered in the background of the slot and a spaceship has taken the place of the pirate ship. Peter and Tinkerbell now sport hacker’s visors and the crocodile which haunts Captain Hook in the book is now a robot.</p>
<p>It is GameArt's great twist on a recognisable world, making the familiar new.</p>
<p>Win in the base game</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The graphics are a little weak. The look of the slot is a bit tacky and overbusy in the way many of Eyecon’s slot machines are.</p>
<p>But the animations are lively and easy to follow and accompanied by a very Peter Pan-style theme tune in the background.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>The gameplay set up is a little unusual with one hundred win lines spread over a five by four grid.</p>
<p>However, in practice, this really only brings the volatility of the slot down, compared to similar games with fewer winlines.</p>
<p>There is a gamble feature to spice things up and a few little bonus features described in full below.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol, with Tinkerbell’s face on it, substitutes for all other symbols except the Bonus symbol. In addition to this, all Wilds move one space to the left and trigger a free respin. These respins continue until all the Wilds have moved off the left of the screen.</p>
<p>Hitting three or more Bonus symbols in one spin will trigger the planet bonus. This gives you 20 planets to choose from, each of which has a randomised prize behind it (free spins, cash prizes, or wild reels). You are given four chances to choose if you hit three Bonus symbols, with the number of picks increasing by one for every extra Bonus symbol you hit over that.</p>
<p>Rules for the free spins bonus game</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.10%.</p>
<p>Due to the unusually high number of fixed win lines, the range of bet on the site we tested went from a minimum of $/£/€1.00 per spin (or $/£/€0.01 per line) up to a maximum bet of $/£/€100.00 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is medium, this is a little low for our taste. See our recommended strategies for more detail.</p>
<p>Paytable for Peter's Universe slot machine</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Peter’s Universe is a decent but somewhat uninspiring slot machine with a few nice bonus features that spice up the otherwise rather boring game play.</p>
<p>The cyberpunk-Neverland setting is Peter’s Universe’s main source of appeal for us, but with a very average return to player and medium volatility the drawbacks outweigh the allure.</p>
<p>We do not recommend this slot.</p>
