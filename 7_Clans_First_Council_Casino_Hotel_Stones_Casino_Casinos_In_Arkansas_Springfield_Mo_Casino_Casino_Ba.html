<p>The new CEO will spend several years shadowing Brincat before stepping into the office</p>
<p>The Malta Gaming Authority has unveiled a new major leadership appointment. As reported by the regulator, its Board of Governors has chosen Charles Mizzi to succeed Carl Brincat as chief executive officer.</p>
<p>Brincat’s departure from the MGA was announced in October when the outgoing CEO said that the decision to leave didn’t come easy.</p>
<p>According to MGA’s announcement, Mizzi will step into the office on January 26, 2024. The appointment comes as a result of the public call issued on October 30, 2023 and the following selection process.</p>
<p>Before joining the MGA, Mizzi served as the head of the Residency Malta Agency for five years. He played an important role in the organization’s ambition to solidify Malta’s reputation as one of the most reputable and desirable residencies by investment jurisdictions.</p>
<p>According to the MGA, Mizzi is a “dynamic and results-driven professional” who boasts extensive experience in operations management. These qualities, the MGA Board of Governors believes, make him a perfect fit for the authority. The MGA is convinced that Mizzi will build on the solid foundations laid by his predecessor and the rest of the team.</p>
<p>Speaking of Mizzi’s predecessor, before officially assuming responsibility as head of the MGA, the new CEO will spend several years shadowing Brincat. This step of the process will ensure a smooth transition at the helm of the authority, the MGA explained.</p>
<p>Mizzi Hopes to Build on MGA’s Successes</p>
<p>Mizzi commented on his new position, saying that he feels “honored” to have been given the opportunity to lead the MGA. He promised to work hard alongside the rest of the MGA team to build on past successes.</p>
<p>I am keen to build on past successes and, together with the team under the guidance of the Minister responsible and the Board of Governors, to strategically steer the Authority forward so that Malta’s already robust position in the field may be further strengthened, while delivering value to all stakeholders. Charles Mizzi, to-be CEO, MGA</p>
<p>Malta’s Minister for the Economy, EU Funds and Lands, Silvio Schembri, thanked Brincat for his exceptional service as CEO of the MGA. Schembri also welcomed Mizzi as the next head of the MGA, praising his vast operational experience and contributions toward major projects.</p>
<p>Schembri concluded that “Charles Mizzi is undoubtedly the right candidate to continue building on what the MGA has achieved so far.”</p>
