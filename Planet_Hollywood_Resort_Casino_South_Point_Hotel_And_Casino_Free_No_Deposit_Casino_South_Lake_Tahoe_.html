    <h1>Planet Hollywood Resort Casino South Point Hotel And Casino Free No Deposit Casino South Lake Tahoe</h1>

<p>The two companies are going to work together on the distribution of 24/7 sports and esports events</p>
<p>BETER, which has been growing in both the esports and sports vertical, has outlined its new partnership with BetConstruct to further deliver 24/7 events that will be promoted across both sports and electronic sports.</p>
<p>BETER Boosts Content Ties with BetConstruct</p>
<p>The latest collaboration is in fact an extension of similar tie-ups between the companies which have focused on enhanced experiences. Previously, BetConstruct and BETER worked on Live Casino solutions, which were introduced in 2022.</p>
<p>Now, the two companies are focusing on the esports and sports segment with BetConstruct accessing BETER’s in-house table tennis matches hosted under the Setka Cup and eFootball, eBasketball, and more.</p>
<p>There is also the CS:GO events that are running under the ESportsBattle banner, which will now be available throughout BetConstruct and will bring further opportunity for audiences to engage with the segment.</p>
<p>Setka Cup and ESportsBattle are some of the most popular events worldwide as well and are watched by 50 million people in 150 countries every month.</p>
<p>Commenting on this opportunity, BETER’s Yori Arami said that the company was very happy to have the opportunity to team up with BetConstruct and offer top-tier sports &amp; esports content on top of the already negotiated live casino services.</p>
<p>Confident in the Success of New Proposition</p>
<p>“Our in-house trading team ensures sustainability and high average margins. So, we’re confident that this collaboration will bring great results for both BETER and BetConstruct,” Arami said.</p>
<p>BetConstruct head of sports Tigran Meliksetyan was similarly pleased with the opportunity and partnership extension and said that the company was a top player in iGaming and it stands to benefit from further deepening its content ties with BETER and its award-winning products.</p>
<p>“We look forward to a long and prosperous partnership with BETER,” Meliksetyan said.</p>
