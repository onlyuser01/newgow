<p>The Celtics Have a Good Record Against the Bucks</p>
<p>In 2022, the Boston Celtics played nine NBA games with the Milwaukee Bucks, winning five of those. This includes their most recent duel, in which the Celtics triumphed 139-118. It happened on Christmas Day last year at TD Garden in Boston. Jayson Tatum recorded 41 points that evening, followed by Jaylen Brown with 29.</p>

<p>The two are Boston’s representatives in the 2023 All-Star game, which shows how good they’ve been throughout this season. Both are expected to do great on Tuesday evening, assuming they get to play. Tatum will play unless something unexpected happens, while Brown remains doubtful. He had to miss the last two games for a face injury, but we think he’s ready to make his comeback.</p>
<p>Giannis Ready for Another big Performance in Milwaukee</p>
<p>About a month ago, Giannis Antetokounmpo suffered a knee injury for which he had to miss five games. Without him on the court, the Milwaukee Bucks went 2-3. However, since his return, they are 10-0. Unsurprisingly, the Greek Freak was instrumental in the Bucks’ superb run, scoring a total of 373 points in those 10 games. He also recorded 10+ rebounds in nine of those games.</p>
<p>We expect him to do something similar on Tuesday evening, but will his input be enough for the Bucks to add an 11th win to their list? Giannis’ teammates will have to do better than usual, but we think they can pull it off. After all, the game is played on their turf, where they almost always show up.</p>
<p>The Bucks are the best home team in the Eastern Conference with a 23-5 record at Fiserv Forum. They are without a home loss since January 6, and the only thing that needs to worry them is that they lost both of their previous home games against the Celtics.</p>
<p>Boston Celtics vs Milwaukee Bucks Prediction</p>
<p>This is going to be a real spectacle with plenty of points on both ends. Giannis is going to do great as always, but it’s his teammates who need to step up in order to beat the Celtics. With the help of their fans at the Forum, we think they’re going to do it.</p>
<p>Pick: Milwaukee Bucks to win</p>
