    <h1>Ilani Casino Resort Ho Chunk Casino Madison Casinos Washington State Prairie Edge Casino Casinos Nea</h1>

<p>Since July 10th I have been trying in vain to receive my first payment of € 180 from Hyperino Casino!</p>
<p>My account was completely verified before I applied for payment (ID card, proof of address, verification with online banking by Trustly). I made my last deposits by credit card (most recently € 10 on July 13 via credit card). Of course, I also applied for the same payment method as for the deposit.</p>
<p>After I had requested a payment there for the first time on July 10, I received an email from Hyperino a short time later, asking me to send them a proof of my credit card - which I promptly accepted. Shortly afterwards I received another email from Hyperino saying that my payment was approved.</p>
<p>On July 14th, Hyperino received another email, stating that a payment to my Mastercard was not possible and the payment was therefore canceled and booked back to my player account - without any reason or information why. I was then asked by Hyperino to arrange payment to my bank account via bank transfer. (At the same time as Hyperino, I also requested a payment to the same credit card in another casino. However, I strangely received the money from the other casino quickly, without any problems.)</p>
<p>First, however, according to Hyperino, my identity had to be checked again (although this had been successfully completed for a long time) - whereupon, as requested, I sent an image of my current account statement via email and then requested a payment via bank transfer.</p>
<p>Without any reason or previous contact again, after receiving my account statement, the requested payment was canceled again. However, I did everything as requested by Hyperino myself and after all my documents had been sent despite a verified account. I then requested a payment again, which was also canceled.</p>
<p>Out of the blue, on July 18, they were again asked absurdly to send them proof that the credit card and bank account were linked - but there was never any mention that they were supposed to be! I immediately answered this and made it clear that the accounts are not connected to each other and there was never any talk of that. I also attached an extract from my credit card transactions and a proof of payment. Then I applied for the payment again and again it was rejected! After I received no answer from Hyperino and did not know what to do - since I had submitted a number of documents and did everything as requested and requested, I then requested a payment to my second bank account on July 19 and then directly proof of my bank account sent by email. This payment was also rejected and I received the message via email that I should request a payment to the previous bank account again. I did this again again! Suddenly after a long &amp; pointless delay this payout was approved on July 19th. However, I haven't received any payment since then! When asked via live chat on July 23, I was informed that the payment would be through and completed! However, I mentioned again that no payment was received because I asked my bank shortly beforehand! The employee gave me a snappy reply that it was complete on their part and they couldn't understand at all whether the money hadn't really arrived at me. Again, an account statement was requested from July 19 to July 23 and the chat simply ended - I experienced this situation at the time for the second time from the support at Hyperino Casino. Nevertheless, I immediately sent the account statement in the chat, to which a new employee replied. After I was pissed off after this behavior, I announced that I will turn to the MGA based on the facts. The employee only replied to me that because of this, he was no longer allowed to give me any information and should not be able to clarify the problem any further. Today is July 28th and I have not received the money from Hyperino, nor am I getting any decent help or answers at this casino. HELP PLEASE!!!!</p>
