<p>So I dont agree first of all I did not ask to reopen my account. I asked them after they said I won in a Pragmatic tournament if they could withdraw my money because I had a 3 months self exclusion. And since they said it could not be lifted I asked them to withdraw my money.</p>
<p>Then they said they could open my account. I was suprised because they said I was not allowed to open my account with a self exclusion still on it.</p>
<p>Because that was what I was told when I made the selfexclusion I asked the same day to take it off.</p>
<p>So their terms and conditions doesnt allow to take a selfexclusion off and you just need to wait the time you set it on. In my case 3 months.</p>
<p>So now they hide behind the fact I said yes at the question if I would like to reopen my account. But in fact they should have never offer me that or even open my account. I had requested the self exclusion because I didnt want to gamble anymore. And they lifted it after 2/3 days because I had winnings in my account and then I was foolish enough to deposit alot of money.</p>
<p>I still think Wizebets is wrong for opening my account. Their own t&amp;c, vip manager and chat support saids its not allowed to reopen a account when self excluded. And you have to wait when the cool off period ends.</p>
<p>They should had withdraw my money and kept my account closed. As I asked.. can you withdraw the money for me. But they opened my account and I could play again.</p>
