<p>From yet another rich plethora of sportsbook choices for Premier League soccer matches in 2021, BoyleSports seems to have found the recipe for success. After careful data verification and comparison, Oddschecker named the Irish sportsbook the “best place to be for a flutter” in 2021.</p>
<p>BoyleSports, the Go-To Destination for Top-Tier Premier League Betting</p>
<p>Founded four decades ago in 1982, BoyleSports is Ireland’s biggest and most successful independent sportsbook in history. With headquarters in Dundalk, County Louth, the company counts over 320 retail branches spread all over the country as well as the UK. BoyleSports is a constant and highly-praised presence in the world of online sports betting thanks to its top-notch Google Play and App Store apps packed with loads of online sports betting opportunities along with casino, gaming, poker, bingo, or lottery options.</p>
<p>Last August, BoyleSports became the official UK and Ireland Betting Partner of Newcastle United, a reputable English Premier League club. During the same year, BoyleSports managed to offer better odds on all win-draw-win types of markets for all matches part of the Premier League matches from January through December.</p>
<p>Thrilled, But Not Surprised</p>
<p>BoyleSports, which had previously claimed to be the number one sportsbook for Premier League bets, is now being backed by official data from the popular comparison site Oddschecker.</p>
<p>BoyleSports’ CEO Mark Kemp gladly received the news, but at the same time, wanted to reiterate that the independent report’s conclusions did not come as a surprise to them. On the contrary, Oddschecker once again acknowledged that BoyleSports shops, together with the dedicated mobile apps, hold the best value for Premier League bets in the country.</p>
<p>The future is expected to look just as bright in 2022, with the sportsbook planning another year filled with outstanding odds offered at the best value prices to all Irish soccer bettors using the BoyleSports shops all throughout the country. Their cool promos are only part of the appeal. At the moment, BoyleSports is displaying a promotion offering up to £33 ($44) in free bets to bettors. The promo is available on Oddschecker’s platform.</p>
<p>The comparison site that specializes in displaying top odds and offers from the greatest sportsbooks is currently managed by Bruin Capital. Bruin is an investment company from New York after Flutter Entertainment decided to put it up for sale last July. At the end of 2021, Entain officially returned Coral and Ladbrokes to Oddschecker after their removal in July 2020. Oddschecker was pleased by the return and expressed its eagerness to see its 2022 plans come to life together with the powerful brands.</p>
