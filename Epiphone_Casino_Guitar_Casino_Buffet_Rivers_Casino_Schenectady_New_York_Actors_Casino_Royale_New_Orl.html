<p>The B2B company teased that it plans to launch in the United States next</p>
<p>BeyondPlay, a fresh business-to-business provider of innovative engagement software to the iGaming industry, has made a foray into the lucrative North American market. As announced, the company has secured a B2B license to offer its products in Ontario’s fresh online gambling market.</p>
<p>Ontario launched iGaming back in early 2022 and quickly became a major market in the region, attracting countless B2B and B2C companies. Thanks to its new license, BeyondPlay will also be able to capitalize on the opportunities in the region.</p>
<p>The Gaming-Related Supplier License was issued by Ontario’s official gambling regulator, the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario (AGCO), greenlighting the local launch of BeyondPlay’s products.</p>
<p>The B2B company offers multiple next-gen community-oriented multiplayer and jackpot products. Its unique solutions can turn solo game sessions into enchanting multiplayer experiences, in line with the growing popularity of social gambling.</p>
<p>Operators can also leverage BeyondPlay’s Jackpot software to create exclusive in-house jackpots for their products. The customizability of the B2B company’s jackpots allows operators to tailor jackpots to the needs of their customers. As a result, BeyondPlay helps gambling companies channel more players toward their platforms.</p>
<p>In May, for example, BeyondPlay joined forces with Casumo to launch Casumo Jackpots, a bespoke multiplayer-oriented casino product.</p>
<p>BeyondPlay Is Excited to Launch in North America</p>
<p>BeyondPlay’s head of compliance, Andrii Grygorovych, expressed his company’s excitement to launch in Ontario. He said that the new license reflects the quality of BeyondPlay’s products, as well as its commitment to safer gambling.</p>
<p>We are honored to be officially registered as a gambling software provider in Ontario by AGCO, a testament to our unwavering dedication to compliance and responsible gaming. Andrii Grygorovych, head of compliance, BeyondPlay</p>
<p>Grygorovych added that his company has been quickly expanding in Europe, having secured several European licenses in recent months. The new license, however, will allow BeyondPlay to tap into an unexplored region. Grygorovych teased that BeyondPlay intends to pursue licenses in the United States next.</p>
<p>Having secured multiple European licenses in recent months, the Ontario market represents yet another step forward for BeyondPlay, one we intend to follow by entering multiple North American states in the coming year. Andrii Grygorovych, head of compliance, BeyondPlay</p>
<p>In Q4, BeyondPlay plans to launch its advanced content-agnostic Jackpot Management Software in Ontario.</p>
<p>In April, BeyondPlay secured $5.5 million in a Bettor Capital-led funding round.</p>
