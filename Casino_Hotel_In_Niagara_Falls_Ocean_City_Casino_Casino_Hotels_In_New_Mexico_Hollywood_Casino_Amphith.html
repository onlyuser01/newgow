    <h1>Casino Hotel In Niagara Falls Ocean City Casino Casino Hotels In New Mexico Hollywood Casino Amphith</h1>

<p>The Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) has been exemplary in the way it has protected local consumers from international casinos that continue to target residents in the Down Under even though they do not have the license to do so. In fact, online casinos are strictly prohibited in Australia, and as such, no operator may lawfully offer their gambling products in the country, or any of its states.</p>
<p>Regardless, mostly Curacao licensed operators have been actively trying to lure players by bombarding them with online promotions. The ACMA has made sure to limit the scope of operation for such companies, adding them to a blacklist that has more than 700 domain names already, and is constantly being added to and expanded.</p>
<p>Now, the Australian government has once again expressed concern over licensees based in Curacao which have been targeting Australians. The ACMA’s efforts have been ongoing with the latest such effort culminating in the regulator reaching out to Curacao’s government, asking it to intervene and take the necessary steps and ensure that Curacao eGaming Commission, the licensing authority clamps down on offenders, Curacao Chronicle reported.</p>
<p>According to the outlet, a letter has been sent to Curacao Finance Minister Javier Silvania on behalf of the ACMA, enclosing a list of Curacao gambling companies that have been found in violation of the country’s law. Australia has long cautioned operators that if everything else fails, the government would act proactively and reach out to overseas regulators.</p>
<p>The letter outlined other issues with the licensees, arguing that they were elusive when it came to fines, penalties, and most of all – accountability, hiding behind local trust officers, and using other techniques to make sure they stay beyond the reach of lawful enforcement.</p>
<p>Silvania has not left those calls unheeded and even prior to the arrival of the latest request by the ACMA, the minister had already been working actively to help ensure that Curacao is synonymous with trust when it comes to its online casino industry. The Netherlands has made a similar request from the government of the island, and all signs point to a profound change in regulation.</p>
<p>However, given the status quo, it may take a significant time to enforce any meaningful and lasting change. Curacao’s licensees are not always the most obedient ones, and many would simply choose to drop the licensing agreement and operate without a certification if push comes to shove.</p>
