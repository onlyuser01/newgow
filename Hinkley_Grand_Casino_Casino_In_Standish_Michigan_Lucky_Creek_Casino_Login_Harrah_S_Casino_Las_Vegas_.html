    <h1>Hinkley Grand Casino Casino In Standish Michigan Lucky Creek Casino Login Harrah S Casino Las Vegas</h1>

<p>I joined Voodoo Dreams in Jan 2021, since that time I have deposited a total of $9825. These deposits were made by either my credit card or Paysafe card. I had not made any withdrawals up until recently when I had some nice wins and made my very first withdrawal; from Voodoo dreams of $800. I made the withdrawal of $800 selecting the bank transfer option from the payout methods available.</p>
<p>Voodoo dreams contacted me via email and said that they had canceled my withdrawal and paid the $800 back into my players account. They said that bank transfers were not available (Even though they are clearly shown as a payment method on their website.</p>
<p>I tried to make the withdrawal via my credit but Voodo dream declined. Eventually, Voodo Dreams finally came clean and admitted they were forfeiting my $800.00 winnings from my Casino because I had used a company credit card for my deposits. They explained this was not allowed and was written in their terms and conditions and quoted clause 2.13 from their terms and conditions. The following is the dialogue that followed.</p>
<p>Hello Anthony,</p>

<p>Then My Reply</p>
<p>Hi Dora</p>
<p>Thank you for your email, I understand and am aware of what the rules are around the use of Credit cards at the Casino, I didn't think it would be an issue as I am the owner of the company "Tonys Transport Ltd", its is only a small business (myself and my three furniture movers) which has only 1 shareholder which is myself. The only person Authorised by the bank to use the credit card is me. It is my personal credit card, nobody uses it but me, it is the only Tonys Transport credit card and its the only credit card I own. It has my name "AJ (Antony John) D***" on the card and the statement for the card has my home residential address on the statement. Here is the link to my 100% shareholding in Tonys Transport on the NZ Government Business Directory Website. Directory. https://app.companiesoffice.govt.nz/companies/app/ui/pages/companies/2053445/shareholdings?backurl=H4sIAAAAAAAAAC2LQQrDMAwEf%2BNLDnmBKD31kkMh%2BYCwRBtIZFdaF%2Fz7mtDb7LAzV35pzLmclW0fFMqe37eziFKATdgloVclNewYl%2FQhFOsxwdmiFsd0QBLLly2rPNn0IHjTdBV9G3HQfVn%2BewWjxcNLq5f%2BAUscDuuDAAAA#</p>
<p>In light of the above information, I am clearly the only user of the Mastercard "AJ (Antony John) D***" ending 1770, and it meets the casino rules around credit cards that the card is "issued by lawful institutions and that legally belong to you solely" . The card is issued by a lawful institution and legally belongs to me solely. I would ask that you kindly review your decision to forfeit my winnings and payout my winnings of $800 . Thank you for your consideration of this matter.</p>
<p>Kind Regards</p>

<p>Hello</p>
<p>Can you please update me on this issue? I am relying on the winning funds to be paid out as none of the Casino terms and conditions were breached as you have assumed. I am the sole owner of the credit card account and the only authorized user of the credit card that's why my name is on the card. I have never had a problem with other online casinos where the same credit card is used and payouts have been made. You have forfeited my winnings based on the assumption the card is a shared card which I have clearly shown is not, so I kindly ask that you process my winnings asap.</p>
<p>Thanks and Regards</p>
<p>Antony D***</p>
