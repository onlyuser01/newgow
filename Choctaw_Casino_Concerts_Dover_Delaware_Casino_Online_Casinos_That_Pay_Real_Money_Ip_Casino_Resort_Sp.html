    <h1>Choctaw Casino Concerts Dover Delaware Casino Online Casinos That Pay Real Money Ip Casino Resort Sp</h1>

<p>The European Gaming and Betting Association has joined the choir of bodies, including the Betting and Gaming Council, to hail this year’s edition of Safer Gambling Week as a major success not just in the United Kingdom, but well across the Old Continent, Casino Guru News learned in an email press release shared with the publication.</p>
<p>EGBA has hailed the event as a major success and said that the responsible gambling awareness campaign that took place between November 13-19 had reached a record number of participants, hitting its mark of promoting responsible and safe gambling across many European countries.</p>
<p>EGBA Secretary General Maarten Haijer was stoked with what has been achieved in this year’s edition of European Safer Gambling Week. From Spain to Latvia, noted Haijer, many organizations joined efforts to ensure that audiences are better informed about responsible gambling.</p>
<p>"We’re encouraged by the increased participation and support from a range of stakeholders this year and we believe this reflects a growing recognition of the importance of safer gambling across Europe," Haijer added.</p>
<p>EGBA saw numerous stakeholders from across the continent join in the cause and amplify the message spearheaded by the organization to help educate the public on the problems of responsible gambling. The campaign utilized social media resources to ensure that it drives steady reach and engagement.</p>
<p>The organization reported that more than 160 partners had taken part, including various NGOs, trade groups, regulators, and operators. As a result, the campaign’s messages were heard across 20 regulated markets with 8m safer gambling messages delivered during this year’s edition and marking a notable 430% increase in the number of such messages from 2022.</p>
<p>The event also coordinated 18 local safer gambling events in various locations in Europe which allowed for different stakeholders to come together and broach discussions about how to make gambling safer across Europe and introduce standards that apply across state borders.</p>
<p>The campaign was delivered in 20 national languages with the ultimate goal being to improve overall accessibility. The United Kingdom was similarly happy with the results, as the campaign hit 50m social media impressions in the country alone, the BGC confirmed.</p>
<p>Casino Guru News also featured Safer Gambling Week extensively in our coverage, including in written and video format.</p>
