<p>Wynn/Encore Las Vegas Officially End Free Self-Parking Because of Sphere</p>

<p>Wynn Resorts, which owns and operates Wynn and Encore Las Vegas, on Friday announced the end of free self-parking starting Sept. 27, 2023.</p>

<p>That’s two days before the opening of the MSG Sphere behind the Venetian. And that’s no coincidence. When this very major concert venue opens with U2’s first Las Vegas residency, it will hold 18,600 spectators and give them only 304 spaces in which to park.</p>
<p>That wasn’t a typo. Nearly every Sphere ticketholder will need to find parking either at another casino resort or at the Fashion Show Mall, or not drive a car there at all.</p>
<p>Because it abuts the Venetian/Palazzo, which ended free self-parking in July, Wynn Resorts’ hand was forced. If it didn’t charge for self-parking, thousands of thrifty Venetian/Palazzo guests would park for free in Wynn/Encore spots, displacing its paying guests.</p>
<p>A press release from Wynn blamed only “nearby attractions” for the policy change. But that’s because no Las Vegas resort promotes competing attractions in its own press releases.</p>

<p>How Much?</p>
<p>Wynn and Encore will charge a flat $20 fee to self-park for nonresort guests. Parking will be free for the first four hours. This is generous, since other Strip resorts typically give guests one hour free (or three, if they’re local).</p>
<p>Parking at Wynn and Encore will remain free for all registered guests of the hotel and Wynn Poker Room, as well as for members of the Wynn Rewards program in the Chairman, Platinum, and Black tiers.</p>
<p>Valet parking will remain $40 per day for all.</p>
<p>Another way to think of this development is that Wynn Resorts is resuming paid parking. Its first dalliance with the concept came in 2017. But it reversed that decision two years later, appearing heroic in the process.</p>
<p>This time, there will be no heroics.</p>

<p>Final Five</p>
<p>This leaves only the Tropicana, Treasure Island, Circus Circus, Casino Royale, and Sahara offering free parking to everyone — though the Tropicana already charges for some of its better spots.</p>
<p>Casino Royale probably won’t remain on this list too much longer, since plans are being made to replace it with a 699-foot tower.</p>
<p>Free self-parking also remains available at the Fashion Show Mall, the Shoppes at Mandalay Palace, and Aria’s Shops at Crystals.</p>
<p>At least it does for now.</p>
