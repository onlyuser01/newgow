<p>Several key starters in the NFL went down with injuries in Week 3. Some potential waiver wire pickups for your fantasy football team in Week 4 include Miami Dolphins running back De’Von Achane, Los Angeles Chargers wide receiver Joshua Palmer, and Houston Texans wide receiver Tank Dell.</p>

<p>Three rookies to consider as waiver wire pickups in Week 4 include wide receiver Marvin Mims, Jr. (Denver Broncos), tight end Sam LaPorta (Detroit Lions), and tight end Luke Musgrave (Green Bay Packers).</p>
<p>Musgrave has not found the end zone in his rookie year with the Green Bay Packers. On Sunday, he caught six passes for 49 yards in a comeback victory against the New Orleans Saints.</p>
<p>LaPorta hauled in eight receptions for 84 yards and one touchdown for the Detroit Lions against the Atlanta Falcons in Week 3. He has 18 catches this season for 186 yards and has developed a bond with quarterback Jared Goff.</p>
<p>Mims, a rookie wide receiver with the Denver Broncos, hasn’t logged significant playing time (only 25% of all snaps) after Jerry Jeudy returned to the lineup. However, Mims has made a big impact when he’s running routes. Quarterback Russell Wilson targeted Mims only nine times this season, but he made seven catches for 195 receiving yards and one touchdown. He also returned a kick 99 yards for a touchdown in Week 3.</p>
<p>De’Von Achane (RB, Dolphins)</p>
<p>Achane didn’t play in Week 1 and saw limited action in Week 2 against the New England Patriots, rushing once for five yards. He exploded in Week 3 with four combined touchdowns in a 70-20 drubbing against the Denver Broncos.</p>
<p>Achane was the backup running back in Week 3 and outgunned starter Raheem Mostert. He rushed 18 times for 203 yards and two touchdowns. He also added four catches for 30 yards and two touchdown receptions.</p>
<p>ESPN ranked Achane sixth overall in fantasy football running backs. He tallied 51.3 fantasy points for ESPN PPR leagues after Sunday’s insane performance. Be wary, though. Achane is projected to only have 12.5 points in Week 4.</p>
<p>Joshua Palmer (WR, Chargers)</p>
<p>With wide receiver Mike Williams out with a season-ending knee injury and ACL surgery, Palmer moves up the Chargers depth chart once again from WR #3 to WR #2 behind Keenan Allen. Palmer filled in for Williams last season when Williams suffered a high-ankle sprain and missed a playoff game with a back injury, so this is familiar territory for the third-year wide receiver.</p>
<p>The Chargers selected Palmer, a standout from Tennessee, with a third-round draft pick in the 2021 NFL Draft. He tallied 33 receptions and scored four touchdowns as a rookie in 2021. He snagged 72 receptions for 768 yards and three touchdowns last season.</p>
<p>Palmer caught eight passes for 83 yards and one touchdown in three games this season.</p>
<p>Chargers rookie wide receiver Quentin Johnston could also see an uptick in playing time with Williams out. Johnston is a worthy addition if Palmer isn’t available and you want a teammate of Justin Herbert.</p>
<p>Tank Dell (WR, Texans)</p>
<p>Dell set a franchise record for the Texans on Sunday. He erupted for 145 receiving yards, the most yards in a game by a rookie wide receiver. He was targeted seven times and caught five passes, including one touchdown. In three games this season, Dell caught 15 passes for 251 yards and two touchdowns.</p>
<p>Dell played his collegiate ball for the Houston Cougars and remained in the same city to play pro ball. The Texans selected Dell with a third-round pick in the 2023 NFL Draft, and he’s already made an impact just three games into the season.</p>
<p>Waiver Wire QBs: Stroud, Winston, Hoyer</p>
<p>Two starting quarterbacks were dinged up in Week 3. Las Vegas Raiders starter Jimmy Garoppolo sustained a concussion on “Sunday Night Football,” and New Orleans Saints quarterback Derek Carr is nursing a right shoulder injury.</p>
<p>If Garoppolo doesn’t clear concussion protocol, veteran backup Brian Hoyer is expected to start in Week 4 against the Chargers in an AFC West divisional tilt.</p>
<p>Carr is currently week to week with an AC joint injury. Jameis Winston, the former starting quarterback of the Saints, is expected to replace Carr in the lineup. Winston and the Saints play an NFC South divisional game against his former team, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, in Week 4.</p>
<p>CJ Stroud from the Houston Texans emerged as the best rookie quarterback this season. Rookies Bryce Young (ankle) from the Carolina Panthers and Anthony Richardson (concussion) from the Indianapolis Colts missed Week 3 with injuries. Stroud helped the 0-2 Texans upset the Jacksonville Jaguars on Sunday. He threw 280 yards and two touchdowns in the 37-17 beatdown.</p>
<p>We drafted the right guy,” gushed tight end Brevin Jordan. “Man, he’s a leader. He’s a phenomenal player and a phenomenal guy with God-given talent. Dude, he’s unbelievable.”</p>
<p>Stroud is currently ranked #12 for all quarterbacks in ESPN’s fantasy football leagues. He made 121 passing attempts and has yet to throw an interception in three games this season. He didn’t complete any touchdown passes in his debut in Week 1, but he’s thrown four touchdowns in the last two games.</p>
