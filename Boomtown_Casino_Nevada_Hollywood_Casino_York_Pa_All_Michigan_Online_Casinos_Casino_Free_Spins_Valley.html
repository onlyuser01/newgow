<p>Bragg Gaming Group has officially announced its new president and chief operating officer. The role will be taken by Lara Falzon, who’s been a member of the company’s board of directors since March 2021. With this appointment, Falzon will help Bragg Gaming Group execute its growth strategies.</p>
<p>Bragg Looks Forward to Capitalizing on Falzon’s Knowledge</p>
<p>The company believes that Falzon is the perfect appointment because she has over 10 years of working experience in the field and has managed and structured multi-billion-dollar transactions.</p>
<p>Paul Godrey, the interim chief executive officer and chairman of Bragg Gaming, stated that her skillset and numerous accomplishments would help the company’s day-to-day operations as well as its strategic initiatives and financial growth plans. Godfrey went on to say Bragg looks forward to benefiting from her expertise and continuing its path towards global growth.</p>
<p>Falzon also commented on her appointment by saying that she’s excited to take up the role as she has evaluated the full potential of Bragg while being a member of the board of directors. She also noted that the company has already established a platform through which it will be able to deliver positive results and that she’s eager to contribute to Bragg’s long-term success.</p>
<p>Bragg has been expanding on various markets in the recent period and the two most notable developments happened in November and December 2021. Both of those developments were connected to its ORYX Gaming platform. In November, the platform was granted a supplier license in the UK, and in December, it was announced that it will provide content through White Hat Gaming.</p>
<p>Falzon Has Worked For Both NetEnt and Red Tiger Gaming</p>
<p>Before joining Bragg, Falzon worked as NetEnt’s operational CFO. NetEnt is one of the most respected software companies in the iGaming world. Not only that but she also worked as CFO of Red Tiger Gaming, which is another well-established game provider.</p>
<p>During her time at Red Tiger, Falzon was one of the key employees who navigated the company’s sale to NetEnt AB for a price of $315 million. Her sales expertise shined bright as she navigated NetEnt’s sale to Evolution for a price of $2.1 billion.</p>
<p>Her CV also includes working as a group financial controller at King and as Evoke Gaming Ltd operational CFO. King is the creator of the well-known Candy Crush franchise. Additionally, Falzon is a member of the Association of Chartered Accountants.</p>
<p>As Bragg’s new president and chief operating officer, she will oversee the company’s day-to-day operations and will help execute Bragg’s growth plans that will lead to greater success.</p>
