    <h1>New Casino In North Carolina Casino Cruise Myrtle Beach Casinos New Orleans California Hotel Casino</h1>

<p>Ohio will mark the beginning of Elys' journey in the US as other states are expected to follow suit in the future</p>
<p>Sports betting technology supplier Elys Game Technology announced it has received Gaming Labs International (GLI) certification for its kiosks and wagering system for deployment in Ohio.</p>
<p>Ready to Deploy Operations</p>
<p>The GLI certification to the GLI 20v2.0: Standards for Kiosks and GLI-33 v1.1: Event Wagering Systems for Elys’ self-service betting terminal (SSBT) as per the testing, inspection and compliance standards of the Ohio Casino Control Commission (OCCC) moved Elys closer to deploying its sports betting platform and kiosks in Ohio.</p>
<p>The certification of the company’s retail betting platform was hailed as “the foundational blocks” of Elys’ expansion throughout the US by Mike Ciavarella, executive chairman of Elys Game Technology.</p>
<p>“The U.S. market has grown significantly since the repeal of PASPA in May 2018 with about 37 states now allowing or having passed legislation to permit some form of regulated sports betting,” he said.</p>
<p>Ciavarella further noted that a company’s internal analysis, based on the assumption that the regulated market expands to 42 states by 2026, estimates that “the annual gross revenue in the US could hit approximately $10 billion in 2023 and could potentially reach approximately $16 to $21 billion by 2026.”</p>
<p>As Elys strongly believes that its addressable market in the US “can significantly outsize” its operations in Italy over the next few years, the focus of the company remains on “scaling value creation” for its long-term shareholders.</p>
<p>Kiosks’ Certification Key to Elys’ Strategy</p>
<p>With a focal point on the retail sports betting market that is largely under-served outside of land-based casinos, Elys is seeking to provide its small business partners such as neighborhood restaurants and bars with additional revenue streams, and SSBTs are central to its strategy implementation.</p>
<p>In November, Elys Game Technology received conditional Type C sports gaming proprietor licensure from the OCCC to commence betting operations in Ohio starting from January 1, 2023, for five years, pending further required certifications and licensing.</p>
<p>In anticipation of the license, Elys secured over 100 host locations for its retail sportsbook solution in Ohio partnering with local small businesses which showed an interest in the land-based sports betting platform Elys is offering, seeing it as an opportunity to offer socially interactive gaming to their patrons.</p>
<p>“The innovative distributed model architecture of our cutting-edge betting technology certainly should make its mark on the global gaming industry in the coming years,” Ciavarella concluded.</p>
<p>The Canadian-based technology supplier also moved to establish partnerships with small businesses in other US states, including BetDupont, Grand Central and Cloakroom Gentlemen’s Club in Washington, D.C., Top Hat Sports Bar &amp; Grill in Maryland and others, and will look to expand its operations into these states in the future.</p>
