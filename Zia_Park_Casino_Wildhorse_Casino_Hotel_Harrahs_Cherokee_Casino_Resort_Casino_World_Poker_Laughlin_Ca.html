<p>Troy Stolz, an expert who was a financial auditor with ClubsNSW specializing in anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing is reportedly planning to face Chris Minns, an NSW Labor leader for his marginal seat of Kogarah.</p>
<p>Stolz Criticizes Minns, Wants Meaningful Change</p>
<p>As reported by The Sydney Morning Herald, Stolz wants to take the position from Minns as an independent candidate that will help push the cashless gaming reform. He criticized Minns for not taking “any meaningful action on pokies” and at the same time acknowledged that those machines create significant problems for some consumers.</p>
<p>Stolz voiced his concern saying that clubs and pubs have long had a lot of power and an independent candidate needs to finally withstand them. Additionally, he pointed out that votes for Minns support “continued suffering and an open door for organized crime to keep doing what they are doing.”</p>
<p>Minns Is in the Pocket of Pubs and Clubs, Claims Stolz</p>
<p>Previously, Minns showed support for the proposed cashless gaming card but only for a trial. Although the proposed changes were supported by Karen Webb, NSW’s police Commissioner, as well as charities and unions, Minns failed to support permanent proposals for cashless gaming.</p>
<p>This got the attention of Stolz who claimed that Minns “is in the pocket of pubs and clubs.” What’s more, Stolz said that Minns isn’t working in the interest of local communities. According to Stolz, the time has come for politicians to stop doing what the pubs and clubs want and not supporting the communities that elected them.</p>
<p>“The days of politicians from both sides pretending to be doing the best for the community whilst giving pubs and clubs a free ride to feed off the misery, and misery money, of others must come to an end.“ Troy Stolz</p>
<p>The latest announcement comes after only recently, NSW RSL and Services Clubs’ CEO, Margot Smith, showed disapproval of the proposed cashless gaming card. She claimed that the proposal only focuses on money laundering and that it won’t be able to curb problem gambling.</p>
<p>Additionally, Smith called for a more balanced approach to the reform of gambling and warned that tough restrictions may bring unexpected consequences for the industry in the country. ClubsNSW and other organizations have also sided with Smith and protested the proposed cashless gaming cards.</p>
