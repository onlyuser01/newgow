<p>Melco Subsidiary Faces Delisting from Philippine Stock Exchange Unless It Significantly Ups Number of Public Shareholders</p>

<p>Melco Resorts and Entertainment (Philippines) Corporation has less than a month to increase the amount of its stock owned by the public — or it will be delisted from the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE).</p>

<p>The exchange released a memo on Tuesday warning that as of June 11 Melco’s Philippines subsidiary will be automatically delisted without the required changes.</p>
<p>Under exchange rules, at least 10 percent of a company’s stock needs to be owned by the public. The investing public only owned 3.9 percent of the subsidiary’s stock as of Dec. 10, according to the Manila Standard.</p>
<p>The company is currently under a six-month suspension imposed by the PSE. It started on Dec. 10, when exchange officials stopped the trading of Melco shares.</p>
<p>The issue involves a tender offer by MCO Investors Ltd. That company is Melco’s principle shareholder.</p>
<p>Last September, MCO was going to delist Melco voluntarily. But after complaints were voiced by smaller shareholders, MCO backed away from delisting.</p>
<p>A main contention was over the valuation for the tender offer — basically a proposal to sell back investments to shareholders for PHP7.25 (US $0.14) a share.</p>
<p>Melco officials also questioned the wisdom of remaining on the PSE. Last year, they complained the PSE listing did not help Melco find new revenue.</p>
<p>Despite the dispute, a tender offer went through and was completed on Nov. 29. It led to the upping of the number of shares owned by MCO.</p>
<p>As of last December, MCO had 5.462 billion common shares. That represents some 96.1 percent of the company’s stock.</p>
<p>Melco is best known in the Philippines for operating City of Dreams Manila resort casino located in Entertainment City. The $1.3 billion venue opened in 2014.</p>
<p>It includes six hotel towers and an 18,000-square-foot gaming floor. There are more than 1,600 slot machines and 360 table games.</p>
<p>Cyprus Expansion Underway</p>
<p>Melco Resorts &amp; Entertainment Ltd., which is listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange in the US, is the parent company of Melco Resorts and Entertainment (Philippines) Corporation.</p>
<p>Another Melco venue is scheduled to open on Cyprus in 2021. Known as City of Dreams Mediterranean, the company was to start construction on the $617 million casino resort last month.</p>
<p>When complete, it will include 100 gaming tables and some 1,000 slot machines. The casino is predicted to become the largest in all of Europe.</p>
<p>Last July, Melco opened a temporary casino on Cyprus. It features 242 slot machines and 33 gaming tables.</p>
<p>Hoping for Osaka</p>
<p>Melco is also vying for a gaming license in Japan. Company leaders are announcing high amounts they plan to invest there.</p>
<p>If Melco Resorts &amp; Entertainment were able to capture a license in Japan, CEO and Chairman Lawrence Ho says his company would be willing to invest more than $10 billion, GGRAsia reported.</p>
<p>The company appears most interested in opening a venue in Osaka, which is located on the island of Honshu. Initially, Japan is allowing only three new gaming resorts nationwide.</p>
<p>Currently, Melco operates three venues on Macau: City of Dreams, Studio City and Altira Macau. It also operates Mocha Clubs on Macau, which feature gaming machines.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Melco Resorts beat Wall Street expectations in the first quarter of 2019. The casino operator reported $1.36 billion in revenue — or $0.28 per share. That’s a 3.72 percent increase over the same three months in 2018.</p>
<p>The performance also represents the fourth consecutive quarter that the company beat expectations.</p>
