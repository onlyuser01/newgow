    <h1>Hardrock Casino Casinos In Myrtle Beach Winstar Casino Restaurants Directions To The Nearest Casino</h1>

<p>The leading betting and gaming company that owns and operates world-famous brands such as William Hill, Mr Green and 888casino, 888 Holdings, announced Monday it secured a senior-level hire. The company revealed that it selected Anna Barsby to serve as its new Chief Product and Technology Officer.</p>
<p>Barsby has years of experience as a digital expert and has led multiple digital integrations and transformations. Before joining 888 Holdings, she spearheaded transformative projects for global companies such as Halfords and Morrisons.</p>
<p>While a part of Halfords, Barsby held the position of Chief Information Officer (CIO) and helped the company achieve digital transformation. Her efforts with the company resulted in the integration of a new brand and service as well as a significant gain in market share.</p>
<p>Now, as a part of 888 Holdings, Barsby is expected to spearhead the transformative combination of 888 with William Hill. In her new position, she will play a pivotal role in the technology integration between the duo.</p>
<p>Ultimately, according to 888, Barsby is expected to deliver exciting new experiences by leveraging synergies. This plan is in line with the Group's announcement from its Capital Markets Day when the company revealed plans to reduce debt.</p>
<p>Besides being Chief Product and Technology Officer at 888, Barsby currently holds additional positions with other companies as well. She is currently a part of Cumberland Building Society, an organization that provides mortgages, savings and other financial services. With Cumberland, Barsby holds the position of a Non-Executive Director. On the other hand, she is also the Founder and Managing Partner of a management consultancy called Tessiant.</p>
<p>Itai Pazner, 888 Holdings' CEO, shared his excitement about the recent hire in a press release saying: "We are delighted to welcome Anna to our new executive leadership team, where she will play a pivotal role in driving forward the key area of technology integration as part of our transformational combination with William Hill."</p>
<p>He added that Barsby has extensive experience within the industry. Panzer said that with Barsby's leadership, 888 seeks to "unlock the significant potential of our two highly complementary businesses." Finally, he acknowledged that the Group is looking forward to the success the new appointment will bring.</p>
<p>The latest announcement comes after earlier this month, 888 announced it issued share capital as well as voting rights. The company revealed it "issued share capital consists of 446,331,656 Ordinary Â£0.005 shares with voting rights attached," explaining that one vote comes per Ordinary share. This announcement came under rules for disclosure and transparency of the FCA.</p>
