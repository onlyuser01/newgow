    <h1>Real Money Casino Games Aria Resort And Casino Las Vegas Nooksack Casino Fremont Hotel Casino Fremon</h1>

<p>Galaxy Gaming and John Wicks are more than happy to continue their collaboration in the coming years. To this end, the pair have agreed to extend their content partnership which began in 2019 and concerned John Wicks’ portfolio of table games and targeted distribution across the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>Building upon Successful Relationships</p>
<p>Now, the companies have secured a continuation of what has turned out to be a working relationship between the two, which will most likely result in an increase in key performance criteria across the board. However, the new tie-up allows Galaxy Gaming to leverage John Wicks’ unique gaming product in all licensed markets, which will significantly expand their reach with new and existing customers and players. John Wicks had this to say through a spokesperson:</p>
<p>“We are very happy to extend our distribution agreement with Galaxy Gaming, to incorporate our land-based distribution rights for North America, the UK, and Europe.” John Wicks</p>
<p>John Wicks thanked Galaxy Gaming for establishing a portfolio and a deep reach in key jurisdictions that will now allow more people to experience Wicks’ own products. Wicks remains motivated to continue expanding its market reach for a key element in its portfolio, Perfect Pairs.</p>
<p>Perfect Pairs Is Just a Beginning</p>
<p>Perfect Pairs is now a joint project by Galaxy Gaming and John Wicks which focuses on the idea of side bets as a way to innovate the traditional gaming experience. While some hardcore players argue that those side bets are not always in favor of the player, the popularity of these games and their captivating gameplay have not relented.</p>
<p>Galaxy Gaming CEO and president Todd Cravens said that the company was delighted to be further expanding its content reach.</p>
<p>“Perfect Pairs is already well-loved by operators and players, so we’re thrilled to enhance the game by pairing it with our progressive system and industry-leading service.” Galaxy Gaming CEO and president Todd Cravens</p>
<p>Galaxy Gaming has recently teamed up with Azure Gaming America to develop an interactive craps game.</p>
