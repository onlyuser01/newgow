    <h1>Circus Circus Casino Boomtown Casino Sloto Cash Casino Login Mystic Lake Casino Hotel The Big Casino</h1>

<p>You place 7000 in your gaming account plays at 400 SEK per print and win 42000 then there is still 919 left of the deposited 7000</p>
<p>Then pronto locks the payment of the winnings and suddenly wants to know where the customer has got 7000 from, he has finances to play for 7000 then the Customer can show salary specifics and proof that he has recently borrowed 10,000 and taken 7000 which he is deposited into his game account prove this</p>
<p>The casino in question did not deposit only when he wanted to withdraw the winnings that the casino has now retained and refuses to pay out</p>
<p>But paid out the remaining SEK 919 which was left of the 7000 invested SEK which he bet and won 42000 so pronto has taken the bet 6081 SEK + 42000 profit and closed the account</p>
<p>Now it has been found that the customer has also deposited 24,000 at an earlier time but lost everything then the casino did not react at all ...</p>
<p>Would like to add that the customer has admitted that he has a game addiction and has earlier this year closed down for 3 months Jan to March, yet the casino does not respond that he is wasting tens of thousands of kronor on the same day as their subsidiary</p>
<p>that ... the customer can lose 24,000 in less than a day deposit 6000 every o every two hours in the pronto game account ... Then no one wanted to investigate his deposits but now that he won 42000 the total stop pronto was kept deposited wagered money plus the profit 42000 now this must be reviewed and reported this is violation and theft</p>
<p>Then they refuse to disclose the chat history without blocking the customer to write in the chat Now this has been submitted to the Assignment Review Games inspection and the Police</p>
