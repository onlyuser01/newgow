<p>Unibet Casino is one of the most significant iGaming brands in the United States. While others only operate in one or two states, Kindred Group’s online casino has expanded to several jurisdictions in the USA. The company’s combined player base in Europe and the US is estimated at 15 million satisfied customers.</p>
<p>Today, Unibet has set up shop in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Indiana, and Virginia, and it is quickly planning its next expansion move in the constantly evolving iGaming landscape in the country. Iowa is one of the planned launches for 2021.</p>
<p>The company has a land-based partner in all jurisdictions, bar Virginia where the Unibet Online Casino has gone live as a remote gaming option only.</p>
<p>Unibet holds a prominent position in each of the iGaming markets it operates in, offering an extensive selection of casino games, a dedicated live dealer casino, a mobile-optimized user interface, and various bonuses.</p>
<p>You can deposit and cash out in a matter of seconds and enjoy fully licensed gaming brought to you by some of the best software suppliers in the industry. Read our full Unibet Casino review below to find more.</p>
<p>Where Is Unibet Casino Available?</p>
<p>Unibet has an extensive reach in the United States, and it’s already available in four jurisdictions to name New Jersey (NJ), Pennsylvania (PA), Virginia (VA), and Indiana (IN). Each casino skin is tailored to Kindred Group’s high standards for a player-favorite iGaming product.</p>
<p>The drawback here is that the online casino has still not gone live in Virginia or Indiana due to regulatory imperfections. With this in mind, we take a closer look at each market where Unibet currently runs a real money online casino.</p>
<p>Unibet Casino NJ</p>
<p>Verticals : Online casino, online sports betting</p>

<p>: New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement Land-based partner : Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino</p>
<p>: Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino Launched: June 2019</p>
<p>Unibet Casino has been right to pick New Jersey as the first state to launch into. Bringing overseas expertise, the casino has quickly caught up to the US gaming market, making it possible for the operator to launch iGaming in the state.</p>
<p>To consolidate its standing in the state, Unibet has teamed up with the New Jersey Devils as the hockey team’s official sponsor. The Unibet Casino bonus is a unique $500 sign-up match bonus and a $10 no deposit bonus.</p>
<p>Unibet Casino PA</p>

<p>: Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board (PGCB) Land-based partner : Mohegan Sun Pocono</p>
<p>: Mohegan Sun Pocono Launched: November 2019</p>
<p>With Pennsylvania showing an early interest in regulating all aspects of the gambling experience early on, Unibet successfully identified the Keystone State as a thriving potential market for further expansion. The launch of the casino product has come in partnership with the Mohegan Sun Pocono. The digital skin extends a warm welcome to new registrations and offers a portfolio of games that runs in the hundreds.</p>
<p>Unibet Casino Bonus – How Does It Work?</p>
<p>Unibet Casino will make it easy to claim your bonus. There are two parts to the Unibet Casino bonus, too. One is the no deposit offer, which you get quickly after registering, and the other one is the 100% match up to $500.</p>
<p>No Deposit Unibet Casino Bonus</p>
<p>Bonus Type: No Deposit Bonus Value: $10 Promo Code: UBCASINO10 Wagering Requirement: X1</p>
<p>The casino welcomes players with a $10 no deposit which is available immediately after registration. The bonus is activated with a promo code UBCASINO10 and will be credited to your account automatically. You have to subject the bonus to a 1x wagering requirement.</p>
<p>100% Match Bonus up to $500</p>
<p>Bonus Type: Match Bonus Value: 100% up to $500 Promo Code: UBCASINO500 Wagering Requirement: X25</p>

The minimum deposit amount you can place to qualify for the bonus is $10.</p>
<p>Games and Software</p>
<p>Unibet’s selection of games is outstanding, and it runs across every game genre that holds some appeal over players in the US. As a result, players will have no trouble navigating the rich portfolio of over 400 slot machines and numerous table and live game options.</p>
<p>To make browsing even simpler, Unibet Casino has split all available games into different categories, such as New, Live Dealer, Slots, Table, Jackpot, All Games, and more. You can further play around with the user interface layout and have it displayed in any way you prefer.</p>
<p>The casino’s portfolio is powered by some of the most trusted names in iGaming, including NetEnt, Bally, and Konami, which have all authored some outstanding products in the industry.</p>
<p>Slots &amp; Jackpots</p>
<p>There are plenty of slots to try your hand at playing at Unibet Online Casino. Powered by some of the best iGaming suppliers in the industry, the variety of games will run far and wide, bringing you some unique choices that are otherwise unavailable in the US market. Some of the leading games here include:</p>
<p>A Dragon’s Story</p>
<p>Anubis Wild</p>
<p>Asgardian Stones</p>
<p>Cleopatra</p>
<p>Guns N’ Roses</p>
<p>The variety is defined not just by the different themes of the available slot games but also by the unique mechanics used to power up the experience. Megaways are a popular segment as they provide players with new gameplay experiences.</p>
<p>You will find excellent choices, including Extra Chilli Megaways, Bonanza Megaways, Raging Bull Megaways, and others. Yet, there are many high-paying games by NetEnt, name Bloodsuckers II, Jack and the Beanstalk, and the Dead or Alive slot series.</p>
<p>If you are after jackpots, we recommend giving Divine Fortune a shot, as the game can really offer some sustainable payouts. Some of the biggest jackpots in Divine Fortune go past $200,000 and drop fairly frequently, making the game even more worthwhile to try your hand at.</p>
<p>To save you all the looking around for jackpot games, though, Unibet Casino has made sure to feature all progressives in a separate section. You will get your hand on the likes of:</p>
<p>Jackpot Jester 200,000</p>
<p>Lucky Luxury</p>
<p>Crystal Magic</p>
<p>Cleopatra Mega Jackpots</p>

<p>American Roulette</p>

<p>Four Card Poker</p>
<p>Texas Hold’em Plus</p>
<p>The table games offer flexibility and some degree of skill as they allow you to adjust your bet sizes, play according to a strategy, and generally enjoy a fulfilling gaming session. Some other options here include Mississippi Stud Poker, Let It Ride, French Roulette, Monopoly Big Spin, and others.</p>
<p>Video Poker</p>
<p>Video poker is another excellent game to try your hand at. The game provides a depth of experience that is driven by a skill element. Many players swear by video poker as the best game to play at any casino, and Unibet is no exception.</p>
<p>You will have access to several excellent options, including Jacks or Better, Bonus Poker Double Bonus Poker, and more. All games are developed by Game King, and you can bet as much as $1,000 per single hand.</p>

<p>Unibet Live Casino</p>
<p>There are many contributing factors to enjoying a wholesome and fulfilling gaming experience, and the live dealer selection a website can offer is definitely one of those.
