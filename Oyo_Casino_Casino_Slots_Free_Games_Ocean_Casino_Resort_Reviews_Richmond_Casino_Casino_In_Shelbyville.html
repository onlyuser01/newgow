    <h1>Oyo Casino Casino Slots Free Games Ocean Casino Resort Reviews Richmond Casino Casino In Shelbyville</h1>

<p>Hello, I would like to report a very serious problem that I think is happening to me with this casino.</p>
<p>I had already realized that the counting of money during the game was not correct. I won 12.55 and I was credited with a lower amount, but initially I thought it was me who was wrong, you want me to play with the automatic and you're a little distracted, but come on, the computer is very rarely wrong, I let it go.</p>
<p>Until the errors become really obvious, my credit is at 0.00 I win e.g. 12.- the calculation is easy and above all it allows me to continue playing.</p>
<p>From that "glaring" moment I immediately inform the assistance who ask me for all the information about what happened (timetable, bet, game, etc...) and tell me that they will forward the case to the competent office...days go by before I receive an answer and while I'm playing they write to me "we have credited you with the missing winnings.</p>
<p>For the first 5-6 times they played this "game" of crediting me with the money, I again made the mistake of trusting them and not checking carefully, also because they were small winnings of 10.00/15.00 euros...</p>
<p>however, I had the doubt that they were not credited to me because from the moment I was told, we credited your winnings, I checked my balance carefully, and the balance never had an unjustified "sudden" increase.</p>
<p>The problem of disappearing winnings persists and although I had asked to fix it, so as to be able to play in peace, a slightly more substantial win of about 72.- Euros disappears, same scenario, I write to assistance, give all the information they also ask for photos and videos of the problem, they demanded that I register the problem (but how can I do something like this? I log hours of play? But in any case I manage to do it and I guess the moment of the problem), I send everything and the answer is always the same. 'competent office.</p>
<p>Same method for solving the problem, after 7 days I'm playing, support contacts me and tells me we have credited your money, too bad the sum was 72.- Euros and my balance that day had never exceeded 40 .- EUR.</p>
<p>I immediately contact assistance and tell them that the money has not been credited to me ... they insist that they credited me the money 5 hours before they warned me, but little changed for me because I was sure it could not be because that day I did not have never exceeded an amount in my account higher than 40 Euros.</p>
<p>I insist but no way they say we have credited them to you. But how do you dispute? They tell you we have credited them and they also warn you 5 hours after the hypothetical accreditation that you cannot, for example, make a video since they warn you maybe record the next half hour because the warning arrives 5 hours after the hypothetical accreditation .</p>
<p>Since then I'm sure something is wrong in that casino so I really keep an eye on it. I check the balances meticulously and not even after 3 days the winnings disappear again.</p>
<p>But this time I change the system I inform the assistance, but this time I do the voice is big, I ask for all my money disappeared and never credited, I ask him to check me at that moment while I play free spins (I understood that the problem was often in the spins free) and I also record videos where you actually see the disappearance of my money and so I get the admission from the assistance that the money actually disappears from there it decides to double check well and it tells me that the system actually says they are credited but not are credited to the balance. Then they admit that the money disappears and is not credited to my balance.</p>
<p>At this point I ask you to notify me before crediting the missing winnings. But strangely this request was not possible!</p>
<p>So I decide not to play anymore and to leave my balance at 0.00 Euros until I see my credit, the final?</p>
<p>Tomorrow is 1 month that I continuously write to the assistance to find out when they give me back all my money and the answer is always the same, you must have a little patience it's not our fault but the game provider's, we are waiting for your reply, We will notify you as soon as we receive it!</p>
<p>I don't know what to do anymore, can you help me?</p>
<p>I also have videos that demonstrate what I'm saying as well as copies of many chats and emails that took place with assistance, if you need them I'll put them at your disposal.</p>
<p>I thank you in advance and, waiting for your kind reply, I send you my best regards.</p>
<p>Isabella</p>
<p>NB The currency is not CHF but Euros, I apologize but I didn't find it, it's definitely tiredness!</p>
