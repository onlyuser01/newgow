    <h1>Gila River Casino Casinos Near Orlando Sandia Casino Ti Casino Restaurants In Cosmopolitan Casino Lu</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have recently started playing at Lucky31 and started by setting a deposit limit of 150€ per month.</p>
<p>However there have been issues every since. I increased the limit to 250€ and it was pending 7 days according to my account. However after the time elapsed it disappeared and allowed me to deposit a lot more than that. I set the limit to 150€ again and I made one withdrawal of 1000€ and was able to continue depositing. I contacted Lucky31 about the issue and they said that this is intended behaviour since my 1000€ is included in the deposit limit. This was not true though, as I was able to deposit above the limit even before I made a withdrawal, and regardless I proved that claim wrong, because after I exceeded the 1000€ + deposits the limit still just didnt work. To this day I was able to deposit and the limit never kicked in. I urge the Casino Guru team to test this on their end with a test account, once you set a limit you can still make any deposit regardless of amount (its enough to click deposit, if it redirects to the payment provider it means the deposit is possible). I am attaching all relevant screenshots.</p>
<p>Thanks and happy holidays!</p>
