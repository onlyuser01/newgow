<p>Developer of virtual sports and betting solutions GoldenRace announced today it has recently signed a deal with Betsson Group to become the group’s first and only Virtual Games provider in Greece.</p>
<p>New Addition to Greek Portfolio</p>
<p>The agreement between Betsson Group and Golden Race will allow online players in Greece to enjoy the Virtual Sports and Games offering of the provider through an aggregator platform.</p>
<p>Commenting on the exclusive agreement, Betsson’s managing director in Greece Thanos Marinos outlined the operator’s focus on customer needs while seeking to “provide the very best entertainment.”</p>
<p>“Bringing in new and fresh content is a big part of what we do, and I would like to welcome GoldenRace to our product portfolio, which I am sure our customers will find as a great addition to our existing offering.” Thanos Marinos, Managing Director, Betsson Greece</p>
<p>GoldenRace has been live in the Greek online market since last year when it was granted an operational license and the new partnership with Betsson is set to further expand its footprint and contribute to its growth.</p>
<p>“The Greek gambling market is growing fast and offers exciting opportunities. We knew that when we first started operations in the country, and it is amazing to join forces with Betsson, to keep offering Greek players our leading virtuals.” Martin Wachter, CEO and Founder, GoldenRace</p>
<p>Affirm Presence in Greece</p>
<p>For Betsson Group, the partnership with GoldenRace will boost its product offering and affirm the operator’s presence in the Greek market, expanding on other initiatives the Malta-regulated gaming group has undertaken recently.</p>
<p>In April, Betsson became the Grand Sponsor of the International Cycling Tour of Greece by signing a deal with the tour’s operator, ΔΕΗ International Tour of Hellas. The tour, which took place from April 27 to May 1 was the first ever cycling tour for the country after 10 years of absence, placing cycling in the hearts of sports fans and seeking to establish the foundations of a cycling consciousness within the Greek society.</p>
<p>The first-ever cycling event sponsorship for Betsson Group ensured the gambling operator wide media coverage across Europe, the Middle East, New Zealand, Australia, Japan, China, Southeast Asia, India, South Africa, as well as North and South America.</p>
<p>In September last year, Betsson became the Official Betting Partner of EKO Acropolis Rally on its return to the World Rally Championship after eight years. As the sponsor of the event, Betsson was active with several initiatives for attendees.</p>
