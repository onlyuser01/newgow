    <h1>Red Stag Casino No Deposit Bonus Caesar Casino Nj Croco Casino Gemini Casino Casino In Memphis Cloud</h1>

<p>I was asked by the Risk and Payments team on Cloud Casino to provide more information to be able to withdraw my winnings. I knew I had been spending a lot on the site and expected to be questioned as to where the funds were coming from. I sent the required documents including bank statements and proof of an inheritance. My casino account had been restricted until the documents had been verified. I was told verification would take three working days. I have been in regular contact with the support team as it has now been eight working days since I sent off my documents. The support team respond quickly but have pre scripted responses such as " we will bring this issue up with our team and once we have a reply we will email you". Well they haven't emailed me with a response from the Risk and Payments team and I am still waiting. It's three weeks since I requested the first of my four withdrawals. In total amounting to Â£9,000. I no longer have access to my online account so my only form of contact is by emails. All of which I am saving should I need them to take this matter further.</p>
<p>This issue is making me Ill. I constantly check my emails and cry at the thought of my money being held back and being given no reason as to why. I trusted this site as it is regulated by English and Gibraltar licensing and it also had good reviews. I feel in have been fobbed off by the support team and don't see an end to it. It is so frustrating when you get the same messages back from the support team over and over again. There is no phone support so I just sit and wait for emails. There is no crime in spending my own money to play online and being able to prove I had the funds. But it is a crime not to refund money to me that was legitimately won.</p>
