    <h1>Online Casina San Manuel Casino San Bernardino Hankinson Casino Casinos In Deadwood South Dakota Fai</h1>

<p>Many regulated jurisdictions prohibit professional athletes from wagering on sports. That doesn’t mean sports pros can’t get rich in other ways though.</p>
<p>Bonnie Rivers, a running back for the Los Angeles Rams, has won a whopping $514,837 thanks to his poker skills. The player played Three Card Poker at the Caesars Palace casino in Las Vegas and won by a landslide.</p>
<p>As reported by KTNV, the athlete was in Las Vegas to celebrate his birthday and his mother’s. The now-24 member of the LA Rams won with a royal flush between his three cards and the three cards held by the dealer.</p>
<p>The spectacular victory earned the young player more than half a million dollars, which will be life-changing for him. Rivers disclosed that he plans to spend the money on a new house. The sum he won notably represents around 70% of his annual salary (around $705,000).</p>
<p>Caesars Entertainment congratulated the player on his spectacular victory, sharing news of his achievement on its social media channels.</p>
<p>The Young Player Had Quite a Journey</p>
<p>The jackpot winner joined his current team in September 2022 and by November 2022, he was welcomed into the Rams’ main roster. Rivers finished the season with 9 carries for 21 yards and 5 catches for 29 yards.</p>
<p>Prior to that, however, the young athlete faced some difficulties in finding a team.</p>
<p>In May, Rivers had a short stint as a free agent at the Arizona Cardinals, which quickly cut him. The player later moved to the Seattle Seahawks, where he stayed but for a few weeks.</p>
<p>The athlete was always passionate about football. He played college football at the Fresno State and has always been an avid player and sports enthusiast. Rivers went to Freedom High School in Oakley, California, where he proved to be a talented young star. As a senior in high school, Rivers rushed for 2,239 and scored 33 touchdowns.</p>
<p>Other Recent Jackpot Winners</p>
<p>In December, a woman grabbed the $1.68 million jackpot at Harrah’s Resort in Atlantic City after wagering no more than 5 dollars. This win turned out to be the largest progressive poker game jackpot and once again attested to the opportunities offered by Caesars Entertainment.</p>
<p>Around the same time, another woman won a jackpot of $175,000 from scratch cards. While the federal taxes brought her win to $124,250, the win was still quite impressive considering that the woman paid only a few bucks for a bunch of tickets.</p>
