    <h1>Mount Airy Casino Resort Downstream Casino Resort Hotel Xcite Center At Parx Casino Hollywood Casino</h1>

<p>I got sent 25 free spins in my email. I played them and completed the betting requirements. Then I got the $10 real money balance. With that I hit free spins I was at around 800$ when I got kicked out of the game..ok.no problem I thought this always happens. However when I opened the game again it never reloaded and didnt give me any winnings from the free spins. So that's really weird. So I went to online chat help. See at this point I didn't realize I had been given the 10$ real money, I thought I was still playing with bonus money as no prompt comes up when you completed the requirements. And it just switches over from bonus to real money which is terrible actually. You should let the player know in live time when they get the $10 real money because you will bet different with the real money. And when you don't know you just.keep betting like its bonus money and.then ur out all of a sudden and don't know why you didn't receive your $10. So I kept asking online support I didn't get the $10 man I swear I would have known. Yes you did he said very rude like I can see all your betting history and everything. Ok so then I started thinking ok well then my last spin I took would have been a real money spin. So this is were things start to change sides. Because the last spi I took I hit free spins yes you bet I did. And around the 6th or 7th spin up around 750$ I got kicked from the game. Ok no worries this happens. I go back Into the game nothing reloads, balance is down to a 1$. So I told support this and he says oh and played stupid. Like he.cant see my betting history or anything like he bragged about before. But this he couldn't see he said and tried to mislead me.every step of the way. And when I.fi ally.put.it all together he says wow I didn't realize you knew so much and are so aware,and that matters why because you take advantage of me like 1000s of others. And if the specialists are still working on such a minor issue with this slot how is this slot still being played as we speak it should be shut down right? Well its malfunctioned took someone's money and free spins from them, serious issue. So annoyed and she'll shocked at the service and lack of integrity and them not honoring there bonuses and rules and word. What a bad combination for a company that should love to see normal poor folk like us winning you k know they got enough thats forsure. Never enough hey. Pay me what you owe me and hurry up enough of the games.</p>
