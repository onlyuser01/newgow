    <h1>Casino Online Real Money No Deposit Online Casino Games No Deposit Casinos Games Lucky Eagle Casino</h1>

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>I made a deposit 300 EUR and on sports betting won 316.29 EUR, in total my balance is 616.29 EUR. My bets were on different Latvian football matches. I passed the verification process, and then in support chat, they informed that I had broken their T&amp;C and they are going to return only my deposit 300 EUR.</p>
<p>First of all, they said:</p>
<p>"Sports bets you have made are not fair", and when I asked about the point of T&amp;C, they provided:</p>
<p>"The event results declared by the betting company are the only grounds for calculations of bets and winnings. All claims to event results, date and actual time of an event beginning are considered together with the package of official protocols of corresponding sports federations."</p>
<p>In our next conversation, they provided another reason:</p>
<p>"Bets placed on the basis of previously known results will be refunded upon completion of an internal investigation by the bookmaker. For this period of time, all operations at the rate are suspended." and the point of T&amp;C:"Bets placed after an event had begun are calculated with the coefficient equal to "1"(except for Live-bets); the winning coefficient on them in multi bets is equal to "1". If a client places a bet on the event the result which is known to him, such bet will be cancelled. In this case the bookmakers company makes a decision after a special internal investigation. All actions related to this bet will be temporary suspended."</p>
<p>All in all, these are just a fictional reason to don't pay my winnings. Each time they provide a different reason. My bets in the betting history are still calculated according to match result with all the winnings.</p>
<p>What is strange I have still on balance 616.29 EUR but they ask me to withdraw an amount equal to my deposit 300 EUR and then they will close my account. If I were really breached the T&amp;C they would already cancel all my bets.</p>
<p>Another prove that they find the false reason to avoid paying winnings, my bets have been made on four different football matches and a few days before the matches. Do they really think I know all Latvian football matches results in one round?</p>
<p>I know what you more focus on casino complaints, but please try to solve this complaint as well and let's save some other sports betting player from SCAM betting site.</p>
<p>It is incredible how those betting sites with Curacao licence so easy without any reason don't pay winnings.</p>
<p>I really appreciate any help you can provide.</p>
