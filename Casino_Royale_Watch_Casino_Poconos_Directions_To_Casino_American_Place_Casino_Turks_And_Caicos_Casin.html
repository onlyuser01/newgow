    <h1>Casino Royale Watch Casino Poconos Directions To Casino American Place Casino Turks And Caicos Casin</h1>

<p>after 10 days my withdrawal was canceled ðŸ˜¡ and they sent me this email saying the following Hello,</p>
<p>We hope this email finds you well.</p>

<p>Regards,</p>
<p>I don't understand why they rate me like this when all I did was play the free kicks from the guru link, then for 7 days if I remember correctly they were giving away 25 daily shots by mail. After that make a first deposit of 10 euros with the first deposit bonus that the casino gives you, then deposit 25 euros with the bonus that they give you for the second deposit. After playing for a long time when I had 102 euros of available balance left, I only made the first withdrawal and this happened to me.</p>
<p>I want an explanation why this happens and if I do not request the return of my two deposits because it would be a scam to allow deposits but not withdraw.</p>
