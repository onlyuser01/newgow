<p>GambleAware’s “There, but not There” campaign aims to help women who experience gambling-related harm in the UK cope with the issue.</p>
<p>New Campaign to Raise Awareness about Women Gamblers</p>
<p>GambleAware is here for female problem gamblers. The “There, but not There” national campaign focuses on helping women aged between 18 and 54 and assisting them out of gambling predicaments. The campaign also wants to raise awareness for treatment options as well as the dangers commonly associated with the activity.</p>
<p>The campaign is part of the National Gambling Treatment Services‘ initiative this year to tackle problem gambling. According to a YouGov survey released earlier this month, some 10% of women experience gambling-related distress and harm. Meanwhile, the number of women self-excluding from gambling operators has reached 55,000.</p>
<p>To drive the message in, the campaign will broadcast on multiple channels. Those include social media as well as radio and print. GambleAware will try to sign women at risk of gambling-related harm to its National Gambling Treatment Services instead.</p>
<p>The campaign understands that women themselves tend to gamble less, and therefore gambling harm is likely to come from closed ones. However, GambleAware does not rule the possibility of women becoming addicted to gambling themselves.</p>
<p>Addressing the Problem Head On</p>
<p>Some 8% of women have shown gambling-related misconduct and this is an issue that needs addressing. The campaign is particularly focused on how immersive the activity is and how it could quickly go from a hobby to a problem.</p>
<p>“There, but not There” cites real examples of how gambling can lead to deterioration in the quality of life of female players. That includes disconnection and loneliness that arise from problem gambling.</p>
<p>Commenting on the success of previous campaigns and the current initiative, GambleAware Communications and Engagement Director Zoë Osmond has said she wants to make sure that women get adequate help in addressing gambling-related issues.</p>
<p>With more women suffering from gambling harm, says Osmond, the goal is to make sure that female players and victims of gambling harm receive the help they need and deserve.</p>
