    <h1>Casino Dania Beach Spin Casino Aliante Casino Las Vegas Casino In Ar Hard Rock Casino Hollywood Fl B</h1>

<p>so on Friday september 30 I tried to withdraw my winnings of 3.000 but with Bitcoin the max is 2500 so I tried to withdraw it after I completed all the requirements of bonus that I used. so I went to live chat and informed the agent that I just put in request for withdrawal. Two minutes later the agent informed me that I had played the progressive slots for one minute that my winnings would be voided. so than I received an email from management stating that they can see that I was playing game for one min so my winnings would be voided. and they even stated that they can see it was done unintentionally so they gave me my deposit back so at that point I was over brango and tried to withdraw my deposit but couldn't because I had to wager it and ended up losing it all its unfair because usually when a slot is off limits because of bonus if u click gake a error message comes up but since I was withdrawing. I. assumed u could play it and also there was no error message and it let me played I feel scammed by brango because I have put so much money into .brango for them to void my winnings because of a mistake on their side n my side</p>
