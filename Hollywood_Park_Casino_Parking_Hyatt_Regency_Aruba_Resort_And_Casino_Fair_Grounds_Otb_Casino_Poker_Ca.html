    <h1>Hollywood Park Casino Parking Hyatt Regency Aruba Resort And Casino Fair Grounds Otb Casino Poker Ca</h1>

<p>disputed amount can not be said exactly. First of all, I will say that their support is terrible. Felix, he was terribly unprofessional. Literally from 2 to 5 in the morning I tried to explain my problem to him, and he is the following. The bonus is great, I only played the money with it. was ready to tow. I decided to try my luck in other games as well. I made a few spins per game, minimum bet / it said 0.50 points /, which I later learned, exactly from Felix, that the bet was actually 1.25 euros, but this is not a problem. As I played, I did a few tricks on this game in question. The balance in my account showed 30 euros / plus some pennies / So I just clicked the button for re-spin, when I received a message that I actually do not have enough money. I look at the balance, it shows 0.36. I immediately wrote to the support, which happens around 2 o'clock, for example, our time. Whereupon Felix begins to explain to me how I played this money (not to mention what is the chance of this game of so many spins to lose everything). After each of my messages they were shown 'please wait, we are overloaded, we are trying to answer all /. I waited, waited, literally changed the page for a second, and now Felix had sent his last message and I was the disciple. Whereupon I try to reconnect, hoping it will be someone else. Emmy again. I write, I explain again.</p>
<p>'' from 30 euros with one spin worth 1.25, I have 0.36 left in my account ''</p>
<p>Well, no, he says that's not the case, thank God at least he gave me some time this time. So he starts quoting my bets. After wandering there, he told me that I could look at them myself. I asked him to wait, after I had been waiting for 2 hours. I come in and some games come out that absolutely didn't happen. Otherwise, it shows there, in a few seconds, some spins, again 1.25 bet. I connect again and tell him that I understand that it is hard to believe, since he writes it in black and white in his system, but I am neither crazy nor dumb and I know very well what, when and how I bet. And accordingly, this is a mistake on the site. Of course no result. What else impressed me / I uploaded a photo / Here 00:01:19; 1.25 pledge, balance: 58.30; balance then: 57.05.</p>
<p>Immediately next spin 00:01:22, bet 1.25; balance before: 1.25; balance then: 0.00</p>
<p>Is how it just happened I could not understand.</p>
<p>the next + 25e, which he explained to me, that I had already played my bonus and these were some 25 euros, which I don't know why they were added.</p>
<p>So the games that are described there are absolutely not true. Because my girlfriend and I can swear that the situation was completely different, as we saw it with our own eyes. Literally 30 euros, come on one more time and a message comes out that there are no funds. And even before he told me that I could see these things myself, and start explaining to me how much I had bet, I kind of realized that he wanted to tell me that I had raised the bet, which did not happen. And he will write to them.</p>
<p>The situation was disgusting, I contacted them to ask what was going on, because for a bonus I was happy and I was about to make the first deposit, in fact, so that I could withdraw this money. But the attitude, so that he did not care about a gram, did not try to understand the problem, the wait is now I want these 30 euros, and more. It lost me 3 hours, nerves and generally some nonsense, which is completely unnecessary for an amount like this. I wrote an email, before I interrupted the chat I told him that I would wait for someone to contact me, someone who could really help me in this case. I hope someone will pay attention and resolve the case, because the error is in the site, the system, the spins that are described, which do not really exist. I want compensation for the disgusting support, for the error on the site, for my lost time, for the lost nerves and for the potential lost personal funds.</p>
