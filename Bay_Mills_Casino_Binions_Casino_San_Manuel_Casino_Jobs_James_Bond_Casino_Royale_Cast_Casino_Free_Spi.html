<p>The leading provider and distributor of content, powering online gambling operators across the globe, 3 Oaks Gaming, continues to expand its portfolio of offering. On Thursday this week, the company announced the release of its latest slot game, Grab More Gold! â€“ the next part of its hit game Grab the Gold. Renowned as an action-packed title, Grab More Gold! delivers engaging gameplay and unique features such as Super Free Spins.</p>
<p>Players of Grab More Gold! are invited on a treasure-seeking adventure. 3 Oaks Gaming's new slot game grants a chance for mouth-watering payouts thanks to its wide range of features, including modifiers, free spins and collect symbols. The game uses standard card symbols between Jack and Ace along with other high-paying symbols.</p>
<p>Players of the 5x4 reel slot game can enjoy its cheerful soundtrack, crisp sound effects and quality graphics. Grab More Gold! offers quality animations, as well as features such as Auto Spin and Turbo Spin, elevating the excitement and thrill of the gameplay even further.</p>
<p>Yuriy Muratov, 3 Oaks Gaming's Chief Business Development Officer, shared his excitement about the recently released slot game. "Grab More Gold! is a captivating sequel to Grab the Gold!, which proved to be a real success for us earlier this year," he explained in a statement.</p>
<p>According to Muratov, the iGaming provider's new slot game is packed with unique features, creating engaging and unforgettable online gambling experiences while at the same time, granting a chance for huge prizes. Finally, he explained: "We are confident that this slot could be even more popular than its predecessor, thanks to its array of enchanting twists."</p>
<p>To activate Super Free Spins mode, players need to land at least two Scatter symbols along with a Super Scatter. Engaging in this feature grants the players Free Spins that offer a unique twist. According to 3 Oaks Gaming, in this mode, "the Money symbols transform into Super Money Symbols, boasting larger values and super-charged payouts."</p>
<p>The standard Free Spins round also comes with a twist in Grab More Gold! considering that players can advance to the next Free Spins level by capturing the Collect Symbol that may appear. Once this happens, the slot game grants the players 10 more spins along with a progressive multiplier that can go up to 10x. Thanks to the Free Spins round, players receive a boost for hitting a Grand Jackpot, which can award a maximum prize of up to 10,000x.</p>
