<p>Online sportsbooks see the Florida Panthers as the second-favorite to win the 2022 Stanley Cup, with the odds being somewhere in the ballpark of +525. It’s no surprise, knowing that the Panthers are 41-6-13 on the season, which puts them at the top of the Atlantic Division. What is surprising, however, is that they’re not seen as clear favorites in Thursday’s game against the Vegas Golden Knights.</p>
<p>Even though the Nevada-based franchise is coming off five straight losses, bookmakers think these guys could give the Panthers a run for their money. One of the possible reasons is that the game is played at T-Mobile Arena where the Golden Knights have all wins against this opponent.</p>

<p>Florida’s Forwards Need to Step Up</p>
<p>The Panthers have been in a fabulous run in March without a single loss in regulation since the start of the month. They did lose one game on penalties, while also winning one after overtime – they won their other five March games in regulation.</p>
<p>The trouble is that those two games that finished with a tie in regulation happened in the previous two rounds. First, the Panthers played 2-2 with the Los Angeles Kings, who then went on to beat them in a penalty shootout. Then, they played 2-2 again; this time, they tied with the San Jose Sharks. Luckily for the Panthers, they scored the winner in overtime.</p>
<p>Scoring just two goals in regulation isn’t something that happens regularly to the Panthers. Especially not in back-to-back games. After all, this is the highest-scoring team in the entire NHL with 248 goals in 60 games.</p>
<p>Is It Time for Vegas to Snap Out of Disastrous Run?</p>
<p>The Golden Knights lost all of their previous five games, even though bookmakers thought of them as the favorites in three of those. So, what happened? The most likely reason behind Vegas’ poor run is that this team’s been having serious problems with injuries. In fact, it’s likely that as many as eight Golden Knights players will miss Thursday’s duel with the Panthers.</p>
<p>As a result of their losing streak, there’s a chance that the Golden Knights could drop out of the top 4 in the Pacific Division. The thing is that the Vancouver Canucks are breathing by their necks with just one point fewer. That said, if Vegas loses on Thursday, and Vancouver wins, the two will swap their positions in the divisional table.</p>
<p>Florida Panthers vs Vegas Golden Knights Prediction</p>
<p>Even though the Golden Knights are desperate for wins, they seem not to have the quality to beat such as strong opponent as the Panthers. Nevertheless, it’s 100% certain Vegas players are going to give their utmost on Thursday, which could make things very interesting.</p>
<p>Picks: Florida Panthers to win but not cover the spread; over 6.5 goals</p>
