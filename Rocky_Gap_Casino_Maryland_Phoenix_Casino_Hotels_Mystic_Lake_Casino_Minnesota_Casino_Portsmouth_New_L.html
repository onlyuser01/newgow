<p>Forced to postpone its original 2021 launch date for a mobile sportsbook app in Colorado until today, leading European iGaming provider Betsson finally saw its plan come to fruition. In an interesting partnership with Dostal Alley, one of the pioneer casinos in Colorado, Betsson created and launched a new Business-to-Consumer (B2C) sportsbook app under its reputable Betsafe brand.</p>
<p>The New Colorado Sportsbook App Took a Lot of Preparation</p>
<p>Originally, the company announced its first launch plans in Colorado back in June 2020, once it obtained a decade-long market access deal with Dostal Alley Casino. Soon after, Betsson had to undergo a long and tedious process of preparation before being allowed to launch its new app in the Centennial State.</p>
<p>The company that scooped up five prestigious EGR Nordic Awards considered the “Oscars” of the virtual gaming sector had to conduct important technological and legal preparations for the app launch. The preparations spread over several months with hard work and dedication from the skilled product and technology Betsson crews that crafted teams a fully US-customized product.</p>
<p>The Betsson sportsbook also obtained a GLI 33 certification from Gaming Laboratories International. The certification that focuses on Event Wagering Systems was one of the primary requirements that the operator had to comply with to be allowed to provide online sports betting as a regulated operator in Colorado.</p>
<p>The new app will allow bettors to place their wagers across a wide plethora of available sports and sporting events while offering good odds, appealing promotions, and a rich selection of banking and betting options. The new Betsafe app can be downloaded on Android and iOS mobile devices and temporary visitors in the state are also allowed to use it.</p>
<p>The New App Also Introduced Betsson’s Proprietary Sportsbook</p>
<p>The launch of the new app is even more meaningful and important for the group as it enables it to introduce its new proprietary sportsbook to current iGaming operators in the country. The proprietary sportsbook is an essential piece of Betsson’s Business-to-Business (B2B) strategy in the US. Along with the official app launch, Betsson has also announced the opening of a brand new office in the downtown side of Denver.</p>
<p>The office will serve as regional support for the company’s B2B operations. The company has also recruited a new account director for the B2B wing. As for the B2C operations, they will be conducted from the same new office in Denver, with a new managing director to supervise the B2C operations already installed.</p>
<p>Betsson’s chief executive officer and president Pontus Lindwall called the release of the new proprietary sportsbook in the country “an important milestone” that will help the company expand its worldwide reach and strengthen its B2C and B2B operations.</p>
<p>After suffering heavy financial losses in Q4 of 2021, Betsson managed to end 2021 with a 4% overall revenue increase. In Mid-March, Betsson signed former soccer star Pontus Wernbloom as its brand ambassador.</p>
