<p>Betfred USA Sports announced the opening of Betfred Sportsbook, a retail sportsbook at the Silver Reef Casino Resort in Ferndale, Washington, operated in partnership with the Lummi Nation.</p>
<p>Boost to the Gaming Destination</p>
<p>The Betfred Sportsbook at the Silver Reef Casino Resort operated by the Lummi Nation is the newest sportsbook at the top-rated gaming destination in the Northwest, following the state’s legalization of sports betting.</p>
<p>Commenting on the news, Silver Reef Casino Resort’s chief executive officer Marty Sauvage could not hide his excitement “about opening and operating the sportsbook” with the casino’s partner Betfred.</p>
<p>“The sportsbook will be a fantastic new amenity for our guests and will enable us to continue delivering the premier gaming and resort experience in the Northwest,” Sauvage said.</p>
<p>Following the honorary first bet made by the former quarterback with 23 seasons in professional football Warren Moon, the Betfred Sportsbook will officially open to customers on August 31, 2022, at 1 p.m. local.</p>
<p>Utilizing 50 Years of Bookmaker Experience</p>
<p>On behalf of Betfred USA Sports, chief operating officer Bryan Bennett outlined that the company is looking forward to leveraging its five decades of experience as a bookmaker to make the Betfred Sportsbook at the Silver Reef Casino Resort “the go-to destination for sports wagering in the state.”</p>
<p>Founded by Fred and Peter Done in 1967, UK-based sports betting operator Betfred currently owns and operates over 1,400 betting shops in the UK, as well as online and mobile betting products in the UK and Spain.</p>
<p>Betfred recently became an official betting partner of Manchester United in the UK while the group’s wholly owned US subsidiary Betfred USA Sports is a sportsbook sponsor of the Denver Broncos, Cincinnati Bengals and Colorado Rockies.</p>
<p>“We’ve long been eyeing the state of Washington and are excited to enter the market in partnership with Lummi Nation and the team at Silver Reef Casino,” Bennett concluded.</p>
<p>The Betfred Sportsbook located in the space that was formerly occupied by the Portage Bay Bar is a contemporary sports betting venue, attracting sports bettors with multiple high-resolution video walls, multiple betting stations, self-service kiosks, and comfortable seating, while a high-quality sports pub will offer sports fans food and beverages to complement their betting experience.</p>
