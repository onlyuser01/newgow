    <h1>How Tall Is The Stratosphere Casino In Las Vegas Casino De Montreal Slots Casino Online Turtle Lake</h1>

<p>Dear Cheryl,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. Please understand this casino has a Questionable reputation and operates without an official license, which gives it a free hand when it comes to treating players.</p>
<p>Also, the variety and accessibility of payment methods are not managed by the casino exclusively. Several factors as geolocation, and contracts with the payment providers, and bank restrictions, all have a major influence. Therefore this doesn’t necessarily have to be the casino’s mistake. Not to mention that exchange rates are completely out of the casino’s hands.</p>
<p>Regarding the problem with games – the casino provides fake games, and we share this fact in the casino’s review:</p>

<p>I apologize, but in this case, if you have already played and lost all your funds, we are not able to help you and we don’t see any chance for a successful deposit refund. If there is any balance left, I would suggest you stop playing, withdraw your funds as soon as possible, and look for another casino with a better reputation.</p>
<p>I can only recommend you to do better research next time and play only in casinos licensed by the UKGC authority to avoid such situations.</p>
<p>Please let me know if there is any additional information that I have overlooked, but I’m afraid I will be forced to reject your complaint. Thank you in advance for your reply and understanding.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Kristina</p>
