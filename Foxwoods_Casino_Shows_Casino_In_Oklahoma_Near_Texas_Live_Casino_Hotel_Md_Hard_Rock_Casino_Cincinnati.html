    <h1>Foxwoods Casino Shows Casino In Oklahoma Near Texas Live Casino Hotel Md Hard Rock Casino Cincinnati</h1>

<p>From what I am reading this will come as no surprise to the moderators here at Casino.guru. I won a substantial amount from Heybets as new patron.</p>
<p>I made a deposit of $300 on Nov 14, and played a few games ultimately hitting a decent jackpot on Gates of Olympus and then quite a few smaller ones on various other machines. During this time, I was talking to my 'Host' Luke Jackson and he was keeping me abreast of my playthrough requirements and congratulating me on my wins.</p>
<p>When it came time to cash out I had asked Luke what kind of requirements they had for KYC...his response was 'you'll be fine, just fill out the request'. To which I did, and since have been bounced around, had random requests sprung up on me, and no given the silent treatment.</p>
<p>All of their requests for documentation, ID, proof of address were all submitted within 3 hours of their requests. I've spent every night since the jackpot with my laptop next to me in bed, insuring that no message went unanswered for as short a time as possible.</p>
<p>I have complied 100%, yet I cannot be given a simple answer as to when I can expect my payment....my 'host' now doesn't respond on Telegram nor the Heybets chat on their website. I have been incredibly patient, and understanding. I haven't been hostile or aggressive, and have refrained from using any vulgarities or slurs, and in response I get nothing...it's been crickets!</p>
<p>I am seeking your assistance in getting my funds as quickly as possible. Thank you for your help and consideration on this matter.</p>
