    <h1>Four Queens Casino Crocs Casino Carnival Casino Offers Casino New Hampshire Harrah S Casino Betti Ca</h1>

<p>Hi, I used my friends card for deposit with his permission as my card does not allow gambling deposits.</p>
<p>I have deposited on Betti.com and I am looking to make a withdrawal but they have asked for a picture of the card.</p>
<p>I have already sent proof of id and proof of address and proof of withdrawal method.</p>
<p>My friend is happy to sign a letter of consent and confirm I had his permission to use his card.</p>
<p>What should I do? I have looked online and some say if you say you used someone elses card you cannot withdraw and they will close your account. Can anyone confirm?</p>
<p>I have the letter of consent signed with a picture of the card and his id ready but need more advice before I send it.</p>
<p>Will appreciate any help greatly!</p>
