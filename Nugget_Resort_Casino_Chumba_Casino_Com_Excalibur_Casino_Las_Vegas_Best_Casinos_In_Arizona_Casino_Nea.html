    <h1>Nugget Resort Casino Chumba Casino Com Excalibur Casino Las Vegas Best Casinos In Arizona Casino Nea</h1>

<p>Swedish gaming company and casino operator LeoVegas has launched a proprietor live casino, which is part of the company’s broader push to dominate the online gaming vertical.</p>
<p>LeoVegas Launches LiveCasino.com as a Litmus Test for Future Brand Expansion</p>
<p>LeoVegas, a Swedish online casino operator and game developer, has launched its own live casino product now available at LiveCasino.com. The new website holds a license from the Malta Gaming Authority (MGA) and it will focus on multi-segment online gaming experience.</p>
<p>LiveCasino.com offers a number of live dealer games provided by Evolution Gaming, but features an exhaustive list of industry renown developers, to name NetEnt, Red Tiger, Play’n Go, Pragmatic Play, Microgaming, and others in the pipeline.</p>
<p>LeoVegas CEO, Gustaf Hagman, commented that the latest digital skin is part of the company’s effort to establish a more dominant footprint in the online casino gaming space.</p>
<p>Hagman didn’t hide the company’s ambitions to become a global leader in online casino gaming. With LiveCasino, LeoVegas will focus on creating a global hub for players who prefer games such as live roulette and blackjack, Hagman explained.</p>
<p>The website is authentic and developed on the company’s own proprietor software, giving LeoVegas full control over player management, engagement, and marketing. The new project will focus on English-speaking countries. Hangman had this to add about the company’s ambitions:</p>
<p>LiveCasino.com is now being launched globally in a number of English-speaking countries, and the ambition is to launch in several of the group’s locally licensed markets going forward. Given our ambition to take a position as the global leader in online casino, it is natural to offer a brand targeted at live casino.</p>
<p>Having full control over the website will allow LeoVegas to fulfill regulatory compliance measures as well as offer native payment solution based on the markets the brand intends to operate in. LeoVegas also plans to use the current launch as a stepping stone to a future multi-brand offering.</p>
<p>The company withdrew another brand from the English market earlier this year. On January 31, Royal Panda quit the UK market. It would be interesting to see if, in its reinvigorated push, LeoVegas will consider obtaining a license from the UK Gambling Commission (UKGC) for any of its upcoming brands.</p>
<p>LiveCasino.com has been developed and launched by the group’s in-house team, Brands of Leo, and the website will be operated by the team behind another successful iGaming brand, GoGoCasino.</p>
