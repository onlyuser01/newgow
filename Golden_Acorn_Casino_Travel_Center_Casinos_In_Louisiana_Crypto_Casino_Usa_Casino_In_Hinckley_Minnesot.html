<p>Future Anthem, a company that leverages AI and data science to improve the experience in the sports betting industry, has launched a pioneering product that is designed to deliver personalized experiences for sports bettors. The new product is built in a way that will help improve the player experience and predict player exit.</p>
<p>Power of AI to Elevate the Betting Game for STS</p>
<p>This new solution will now be launched with STS, Poland’s leading sportsbook, which also provides virtual sports and esports betting markets, and is presently the country’s largest and most recognizable brand. STS’ dynamic growth over the years has consolidated its position as the go-to betting operator for locals.</p>
<p>The new agreement between the company to see Future Anthem’s AI and data-driven product will help bolster engagement with existing STS customers and possibly attract more sports fans in the Polish market, who are looking to enjoy the best possible betting journey.</p>
<p>This new software will also have the opportunity to automate the bonusing and player communications, which will give the operator’s platform a more streamlined experience from start to finish. Future Anthem was able to put together the solution within 12 weeks of STS requesting the product.</p>
<p>Both companies have worked hard to ensure that the resulting product and its output are aligned with the Polish operator’s overall player strategy and long-term objectives.</p>
<p>Future Anthem Delivers a Product Capable of Driving Engagement</p>
<p>Future Anthem CPO Ian Tibot welcomed the opportunity to deploy highly personalized software that is designed to assist players in every step of the journey. Tibot argued that the personalized player experience delivered for STS was also a part of Future Anthem’s own strategy, and said:</p>
<p>Our vision has been perfectly complemented by the ambition of STS to commit to a real-time personalization roadmap and it has been a pleasure to work with such a forward-thinking partner. Future Anthem CPO Ian Tibot</p>
<p>STS CEO Mateusz Juroszek was also happy with this new partnership with STS and said that it was a chance to work with an established AI specialist and leader in the field.</p>
<p>“The partnership demonstrates our ongoing commitment to enhance every part of the player’s journey. I thank my team at STS who have worked in collaboration with Future Anthem to launch this partnership,” he concluded.</p>
