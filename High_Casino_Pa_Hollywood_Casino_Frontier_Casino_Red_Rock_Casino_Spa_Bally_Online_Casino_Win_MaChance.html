    <h1>High Casino Pa Hollywood Casino Frontier Casino Red Rock Casino Spa Bally Online Casino Win MaChance</h1>

<p>Hello, I won €650 there on February 11th and now I wanted to pay it out after winning there about 8 months ago. A document is said to have expired so I had to upload a new one. The document was accepted after 5 days and so I made a payment on February 16th, which was supposed to be processed after 24 hours. To date, this withdrawal of €400 has not been processed. And I couldn't even place the other 250, because you can only make one payout at a time and no more than €400 go.</p>
<p>meanwhile I don't think I'll get the money anymore and I'm just being stalled by the casino</p>
