    <h1>Caesers Casino Cash Frenzy Casino Admiral Casino Biz Login Soaring Eagle Casino Mount Pleasant Michi</h1>

<p>Scientific Games Corporation and OpenBet signed a deal to see the future implementation of advanced player performance bets by Wall Street Football on the OpenBet Arena sportsbook content platform.</p>
<p>The agreement between Scientific Games and WSF is a second major deal involving OpenBet. At the end of September, Endeavor Group Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: EDR) bought OpenBet for $1.2 billion from SG with the intention to combine it with the online sports content platform Arena to form OpenBet Arena. The resulting product still benefits from Scientific Games’ expertise, and the deal for the platform has not yet been concluded.</p>
<p>Currently, the content platform provides official live streaming video and data feeds for more than 45,000 sports events annually. The latest deal also allows the fans to make bets on the performance of individual players.</p>
<p>The new partner to OpenBet Arena, Wall Street Football, is expected to boost the user experience by providing unique betting options, such as WSF’s pre-match and in-play Under/Over Fixed Odds Bets. The bet is derived from a special WSF index, which uses historical data and the help of advanced statistical, actuarial, and financial AI models. As a result, players have the unique opportunity to bet on players’ performances before and during a game.</p>
<p>The Positive Reactions of Both Companies</p>
<p>The CEO and co-founder of Wall Street Football, Giovanni Bertoy has expressed his satisfaction in signing the deal and his optimism for the future. He also hinted at future deals which could see WSF featured on other platforms as well:</p>
<p>“Our sophisticated and advanced offering has resonated with operators worldwide, and we look forward to partnering with more sportsbooks and educating them on how we can propel their offering to a new level.” CEO and co-founder of Wall Street Football, Giovanni Bertoy</p>
<p>The vice-president of sports products at OpenBet, Nikos Konstakis, was also delighted by the deal and the acquisition at Arena:</p>
<p>“The Under/Over Fixed Odds Bets product is extremely accurate and provides sportsbooks with the confidence to offer such markets on individual performance.”</p>
<p>Since 2017, Wall Street Football has been the first B2B supplier of a platform for investing, betting, and trading on individual performances of football players. The Italian company employs a team with a diverse set of skills, ranging from former Google engineers to academics, mathematicians, data scientists, and AI experts.</p>
<p>The main asset of WSF is a fully automated mathematical and statistical model that uses the power of machine learning and AI for analyzing enormous amounts of data to forecast future player performances.</p>
<p>OpenBet Arena is the result of the aforementioned deal in September between Scientific Games and Endeavor. OpenBet, which has over 75 global customers, 24 sportsbooks across 12 states, is currently being sold to Endeavor for $1.2 billion, and the deal is likely to close in the second quarter of 2022.</p>
