<p>Playson, a prominent supplier of products for the online casino vertical, has signed a new partnership that will position the company more firmly into the Dutch iGaming market. This new development is realized with the help of Bingoal, a Belgium operator of casinos, with a strong presence in the Netherlands since 2021.</p>
<p>Thanks to this tie-up, Playson will be able to deliver some of its most prominent Hold &amp; Win titles to the market. The games that are launching initially include Wolf Power, Hit the Bank, Joker’s Coins, Royal Coins 2, and Lion Gems, the company informed in a press release.</p>
<p>The partners expect to see more titles added over the coming months as well, which will considerably expand the library of games available to local players but also further strengthen the two companies’ positions in the market. Playson is integrating its products with the help of Games Global.</p>
<p>Commenting on the partnership, Playson Sales Manager Golazin Rahattalab said that the Netherlands remains a key market for the company and that this partnership with Bingoal is a perfect opportunity for the supplier to further showcase its portfolio and strengthen Its presence locally.</p>
<p>The year has already started well for Playson, Rahattalab added, and said that the company hopes for a successful journey throughout 2023, not least with the help of Bingoal. Meanwhile, Bingoal Online Casino Product Manager Dany Salmon welcomed the addition of Playson products.</p>
<p>He said that the company had a solid reputation in the European casino industry and was very happy to see the Hold &amp; Win games along with other products find a place at Bingoal.nl.</p>
<p>"At Bingoal, we are always looking to work with the best suppliers in the industry and there is no doubt that Playson’s presence across Europe is growing rapidly," Salmon explained.</p>
<p>Playson has indeed been working hard on boosting its presence in European markets. The company agreed on a new partnership with Grand Casino Baden, a casino based in Switzerland, at the beginning of the year.</p>
<p>The company has also released a new game in February, Bozo Cats, a three-by-five grid slot featuring sticky wilds and free spins. In January, the company grew its library with the addition of Pirate Chest: Hold and Win.</p>
