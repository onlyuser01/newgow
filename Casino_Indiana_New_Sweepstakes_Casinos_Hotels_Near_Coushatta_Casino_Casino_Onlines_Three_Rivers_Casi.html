<p>With the warm-up tournaments now in the books, the WSOP Online Super Circuit Series start in earnest today, April 5.</p>
<p>Online Super Circuit Series by WSOP.com Get Underway</p>
<p>Starting today, the World Series of Poker (WSOP.com) is offering a new WSOP Online Super Circuit Series. The online competition is a replacement tournament for the regular WSOP Circuit stops in light of the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>To help fill the vacuum, the leading poker organization in the United States has decided to take its tournaments online in the states where it can legally do so, including New Jersey, Nevada, and Delaware.</p>
<p>The lockdown has also prompted WSOP.com to offer more generous prize pools which will sit well with poker players. Shutting down casinos around the country has also helped draw bigger Internet crowds, WSOP says, with many poker afficionados deciding to give the tournament a go.</p>
<p>The @WSOPcom Spring Online Championships are here with more than FOUR million in guarantees.</p>

<p>The Spring Series will now guarantee $4 million in prize purse, but the total amount paid out should exceed this forecast. In fact, the tournament is one of the largest that any US player has seen in the regulated poker market.</p>
<p>A total of 112 tournaments will be available through May 3. The warm-up events have already kicked off on April 1 with 12 tournaments ranging from $30 to $250. The official OC begins today, April 5, with three events on schedule, to name:</p>
<p>$30 NLHE ($30K GTD)</p>
<p>$215 NLHE Sunday Special Edition ($100K GTD)</p>
<p>$55 NLHE Sunday 50 ($50K GTD)</p>

<p>With multiple events taking place throughout the period, players of all budgets and skill levels will have the opportunity to join and try their hand. The $525 NLHE Main Event ($300K GTD) event will take place on Sunday, May 3.</p>
<p>WSOP.com has also made sure that any players that want to participate can deposit using a range of payment options, including Visa, Mastercard, Discover, PayPal, eCheck ACH and PayNearMe.</p>
<p>WSOP.com is not the only organization to have increased its online presence following the COVID-19 lockdown. Both PokerStars and partypoker are running a series of events. PokerStars in particular has two events planned for Pennsylvania and New Jersey, with the PASCOOP and NJSCOOP respectively.</p>
<p>The company is offering $2 million in guaranteed prize purse. At the same time, partypoker is also launching a competition today, April 5. The event will feature 17 events and $400,000 in guaranteed prize pool, not a bad opportunity for players after all.</p>
