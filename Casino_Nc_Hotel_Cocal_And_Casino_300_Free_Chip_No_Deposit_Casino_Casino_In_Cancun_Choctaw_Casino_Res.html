<p>VEGAS MUSIC ROUNDUP: Keith Urban Extends Residency, Adele Expected to Add More Shows, Drake Returns After 5 Years</p>
<p>Posted on: March 14, 2023, 02:41h.</p>

<p>Adele is about to announce more dates for her Caesars Palace residency, “Weekends With Adele,” a source tells Casino.org’s own Vital Vegas blogger Scott Roeben.</p>
<p>Rumors are swirling that Adele could get as much as $1.2M per show for the additional dates she is expected to add to her Caesars Palace residency. If true, that would beat Lady Gaga’s $1M per show at Dolby Live and just about double what Adele earns now. (Image: travelandleisure.com)</p>
<p>Exactly when the superstar will return after her current commitment concludes on March 25 remains up in the air. June is a possibility following comedian Jerry Seinfeld’s two-night stand on June 10. So is sometime between August through the first week of November. Adele may perform three times a week when she returns instead of twice.</p>
<p>Urban Legend</p>
<p>There’s no question that country superstar Keith Urban is extending his residency at Zappos Theater at Planet Hollywood Resort &amp; Casino. He’s adding the dates November 1, 3, 4, 10, 11, 15, 17, and 18. Tickets for the new shows go on sale Saturday, March 18 at 10 a.m. PT via ticketmaster.com/keithurbanvegas.</p>
<p>Members of The ‘Ville, Urban’s official fan club, will have access to a presale starting Wednesday, March 15 at 10 a.m. PT. Caesars Rewards members, Caesars Entertainment’s loyalty program, and Live Nation and Ticketmaster customers will have access to a presale from Thursday, March 16, at 10 a.m. PT until Friday, March 17, at 10 p.m. PT.</p>

<p>A limited number of additional tickets have also been made available for the following previously announced Urban dates: March 15, 17, and 18; June 16, 17, 21, 23, 24, 28, and 30; and July 1.</p>
<p>By the time Urban takes the Zappos Theater stage for those shows, it will probably be known as the Bakkt Theater, after crypto-currency company Bakkt Holdings. That naming rights deal was just announced last week.</p>
<p>Zappos, the formerly dominant shoe brand, is slowly being dismantled following the sale of the Las Vegas-based company to Amazon and the 2020 death of its retired CEO, Tony Hsieh.</p>
<p>More Shows</p>
<p>Drake will perform with 21 Savage at the T-Mobile Arena on Friday, September 1, as part of his “It’s All a Blur” tour, the first in five years for the four-time Grammy winner. Drake’s latest album, “Her Loss” — a collaboration with 21 Savage — debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 album chart last November.</p>
<p>Ticket sales begin on Friday, March 17 at noon PST through AXS.com.</p>
<p>Kenny Loggins headlines the Pearl at the Palms on Friday, October 6, on what he is billing as his final concert tour, called “This Is It.” Tickets go on sale Friday, March 17 at 10 a.m. via ticketmaster.com.</p>
