<p>The game perfectly illustrates why Light &amp; Wonder acquired Authentic Gaming, a representative of the former company said</p>
<p>Light &amp; Wonder and its Authentic Gaming subsidiary have teamed up to launch a new live game show in Europe. The unprecedented release is called 7’s on Fire LIVE and is a part of the former company’s 7’s on Fire franchise.</p>
<p>This will be the first Authentic Gaming game show to leverage Light &amp; Wonder’s franchise in Europe.</p>
<p>At first, the UK release will only be available to UK players of Light &amp; Wonder’s local partner, Sky Betting and Gaming. For two weeks, the show will be accessible on the latter company’s Sky Vegas and Sky Bingo brands, allowing their customers to try it out in advance. The game will be released to a wider operator network in the weeks to follow.</p>
<p>Authentic Gaming is excited to unleash the new game and is considering using other Light &amp; Wonder IPs in the future.</p>
<p>What the Show Is All About</p>
<p>7’s on Fire LIVE provides participants with multiple ways to win and allows players to place wagers on both fruit symbols and numbers. The show is designed to engage places and provide them with non-stop excitement. Inspired by the latest trends in gaming, 7’s on Fire LIVE offers a maximum win of 10,000x the initial bet.</p>
<p>7’s on Fire LIVE players can wager on symbols and multiply their bets by up to 500x or bet on numbers and multiply their bets by up to 777x. In addition, if the winning number matches the winning symbol, the player’s symbol winnings will be tripled.</p>
<p>A bonus round will provide players with additional chances to win by multiplying all wins by up to 7x.</p>
<p>The Launch Shows Why Light &amp; Wonder Forayed into Live Casino</p>
<p>Representatives from the two companies commented on the release with Authentic Gaming’s founder and chief executive, Jonas Delin, expressing his excitement about the launch. He described the release of 7’s on Fire LIVE as an exciting moment for his team and a testament to his company’s desire to innovate the live casino sector.</p>
<p>By combining the best of Light &amp; Wonder’s immensely popular IP with our ambitious development capabilities, we anticipate a strong reaction from UK players who will hopefully appreciate the alternative gameplay that is on offer. Jonas Delin, founder &amp; CEO, Authentic Gaming</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Light &amp; Wonder’s CEO of iGaming, Dylan Slaney, said that the new game “beautifully illustrates” why Light &amp; Wonder acquired Authentic Gaming, foraying into the live casino space. He noted that the new game will refresh the popular 7’s on Fire franchise while delivering exciting experiences to fans.</p>
<p>We’re thoroughly looking forward to unveiling more of these game show collaborations in the near future. Dylan Slaney, CEO of iGaming, Light &amp; Wonder</p>
<p>Speaking of Light &amp; Wonder, the company just agreed to aggregate DreamSpin content. Prior to that, the provider extended its licensing agreement with Warner Bros.</p>
