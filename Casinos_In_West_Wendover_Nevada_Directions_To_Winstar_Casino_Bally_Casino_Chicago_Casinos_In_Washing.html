<p>Goldfish Review</p>
<p>Theme and Visual Details</p>
<p>As you already guess from the slot name the theme is about pet fish. The reels of the game are set inside an aquarium with different kinds of fish swimming in the background. The symbols have a decent level of details but the slot lacks modern animations.</p>
<p>But even so the game has an attractive appearance thanks to the vibrant choice of colors. To make the slot even more fun to play the designers added a hip background music which perfectly flows with the game theme.</p>

<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>The gameplay in the slot is fast with fairly frequent payouts. As you spin the reels you feel a dose of excitement as you wait for some of the random features to be triggered. This makes the gameplay fun and full of suspense.</p>
<p>Bet size and payouts</p>
<p>Goldfish is a 25 winlines slot with 5 reels and 3 rows, but the bet size in the game can range from $0.35 up to $105 per spin. The extra $0.10 to $30 is added to the total bet size as a feature bet. The higher the feature bet is the higher the payouts can be in the bonus features.</p>
<p>The RTP value in the game is set to 96%. This is a medium variance slot which can produce low to medium payouts during base play. But when some of the bonus features are triggered players can expect some nice payouts to hit the screen.</p>

<p>Bonus features</p>
<p>The Wild symbol in the game is the Goldfish. It can land on all reels substituting for all game symbols, except for the Scatter Fish Food symbol.</p>
<p>The Scatter symbol can also land on all of the reels and once 3 or more of them hit the screen the Fish Food Feature is triggered.</p>
<p>In this bonus round you are presented with a full screen of Fish Food Cans. You will need to choose among them and match 3 or 4 in order to get a prize. If you manage to find three Turtle Food Cans the prizes will be higher.</p>
<p>Players can also trigger five random features at the end of every spin. If the Goldfish feature is triggered you will get 5, 8, 10, 15 or 20 free spins with a win multiplier of x2, x3, x5, x7 or x10.</p>
<p>The Purple Fish feature is a cash bonus where the Purple Fish blows three bubbles on the screen. Each bubble contains a number from 0 to 9 and the numbers will align themselves on the reels to form one number from 15 to 984. This number is then multiplied with the line bet forming the total payout of the feature.</p>
<p>In the Red Fish feature you will need to choose among the Castle, Clam or Chest bubble. The fish will kiss the chosen symbol increasing its value with each kiss. The maximum prize per kiss is set at 200 times the line bet.</p>
<p>Red Fish is waiting for your choice - Castle, Clam or Chest?</p>
<p>In the Green Fish feature you will need to choose among bubbles and each one will reveal an award. If you choose the "Award All" bubble all cash prizes are awarded. Each bubble can award anywhere from 10 to 500 times line bet.</p>
<p>If the Blue Fish feature is triggered the player is awarded with 3 Super Scatter spins. During these spins all symbols count as scatters forming wins regardless of their position on the reels.</p>

<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Goldfish is a very interesting slot which will surely keep you spinning for long sessions thanks to the many bonus features it has to offer. The gameplay is fun with lots of excitement on the reels and with the potential for some great payouts.</p>
<p>Some of the features can award smaller payouts to keep your balance from decreasing too quickly, but some like the free spins bonus can add a substantial increase on your account.</p>
