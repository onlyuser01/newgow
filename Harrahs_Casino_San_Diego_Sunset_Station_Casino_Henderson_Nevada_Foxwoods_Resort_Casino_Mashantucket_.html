<p>Constantinou outlined that the OKTO.WALLET will be embedded into the casino's mobile app and will offer safe and secure transactions. Moreover, he pointed out that OKTO offers responsible gambling tools such as age verification and KYC.</p>

He pointed out that such features "are vitally important to progressive brands like the Hippodrome." In conclusion, Constantinou said the Hippodrome is looking forward to collaborating with OKTO and the success the partnership will bring.</p>
<p>Licensed and regulated by the UK Gambling Commission, the Hippodrome Casino is an established cornerstone of West End life. As the biggest casino and entertainment venue in the country, the Hippodrome accepts millions of visitors every year.</p>
<p>Besides a casino, the venue offers amenities that include live entertainment, a rooftop terrace and a tea room. Additionally, visitors of the Hippodrome can enjoy the Heliot Steak House, which is famous as the best steak house in London.</p>
<p>OKTO's Chief Commercial Officer, Simon Dorsen, added: "The Hippodrome was the first to interpret changes in legislation bringing about a new style of UK casino that has put the venue firmly on the world map." He explained that the venue reaffirmed its leadership digitalization position by adding OKTO as a payment method.</p>
<p>Dorsen pointed out that OKTO.WALLET will be embedded within the venue's mobile app as payment method, which will expand the payment options for visitors.
