    <h1>Las Vegas Nevada Casino Casinos In Gulfport Ms Hollywood Casino Sportsbook Gulfport Casino Meskwaki</h1>

<p>Hello Tomas,</p>
<p>Yes you understood correctly. During my play-through I was betting $1 $2 &amp; $5 bets. Not exceeding set bet maximum for bonus.</p>
<p>Once Play-through was complete there was a visual with transaction showing funds took away, due to having won more then amount valid for play-through. At which point the money still left in the account should have not been under any restrictions. I left game checked account info to ensure play-through was complete and was at a little over $1,000 that was available for withdrawal. So I went back into same game and started wagering $10 &amp; $20 bets. I only wagered this amount about 10-20 games as I hit a bonus around the 9th spin which payed me $1,700 so I dropped wager back down. started wagering $5 per game until I hit $2,900. Once hitting this amount I requested withdrawal of $2,500 and kept remainder In account still betting $5 hands.</p>
<p>i closed game out and submitted my account verification to be able to get funds. Once complete went back into the game to continue playing with amount left in account. During which time Prima support emailed me saying they had to do a quick manual review by this time it was 4:31a.m MST. Then 8:40a.m which isnâ€™t quick as stated I was sent another email of denial of requested funds for withdrawal. Then another one at 8:42a.m 2 emails 2 different People. One person stated my deposit was returned and another person stated my deposit was placed back into my Prima player account. So for faster response time I went into Prima player account to open a chat session with a rep. Asked for a transaction history to show how I breached terms before play-through was complete. Was advised that I would have to email for that info. Realized that I was able to review transaction history my self under accounts tab. Once I pulled up and started going through it so I can print play history the account was blocked.</p>
<p>I still have not got a reply back from anyone at prima, even after requesting to speak with Management. They have cut all communication with me and even kept my deposit.</p>
<p>emails from Prima have been forwarded to email you provided, and photo of account being blocked was also sent.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>-AD</p>
