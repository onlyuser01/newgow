    <h1>Davinci S Gold Casino Embassy Suites San Juan Hotel Casino Raging Bull Casino No Deposit Bonus Top 1</h1>

<p>I have been trying to get my withdrawal processed for 3 days now.</p>
<p>I sent the required documentation off for verification and this was approved. I then had an e-mail saying that they had tried to pay my winnings into a bank account that wasn't even mine (had the wrong last 4 card digits) even though I had asked for a withdrawal using the correct card. Was told that the funds have been sent back to my account.</p>
<p>I logged onto my account and the 800 euros has disappeared and there's not even any log of them being there before so it's as if it was never there.</p>
<p>Spoke to an agent on the live chat and she said the same thing that was written on the e-mail I received and also suggested that I use an alternative method such as perfect money, however I have seen that people have been scammed using this method so will be avoiding it.</p>
<p>I have used the live chat feature 5 times and 3 out of 5 times it has been the same woman 'Emma', which I find strange. I'm glad I hadn't spent a load of money on here (maybe Â£50 max) but I just really want my winnings or failing that, just all my deposits back.</p>
<p>Please help me, if I don't receive anything I want to get this casino blacklisted and off the internet.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Nia</p>
