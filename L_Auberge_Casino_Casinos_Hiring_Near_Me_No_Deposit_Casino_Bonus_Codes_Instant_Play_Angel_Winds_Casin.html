    <h1>L Auberge Casino Casinos Hiring Near Me No Deposit Casino Bonus Codes Instant Play Angel Winds Casin</h1>

<p>The famous resort, mall and casino located on the Las Vegas Strip, Resorts World Las Vegas, announced a groundbreaking collaboration with Sightline Payments, the award-winning sports betting and casino gaming digital payments provider and software developer.</p>
<p>The collaboration was announced Wednesday and sees Resorts World launch the second generation of cashless technology, taking the user experience and convenience to a whole new level. Thanks to the new collaboration, the venue brings remote identity verification, biometric authentication, as well as a "single digital wallet."</p>
<p>With the new update, Resorts World significantly reduces the time for visitors' verification. Before implementing this innovative technology, visitors of the venue that wanted to use cashless gaming solutions needed to undergo a verification on-site via a member of the casino.</p>
<p>Now, thanks to the latest collaboration with Sightline, Resorts World is the first casino in Nevada to allow its visitors to leverage cashless technology to "enroll, verify, and fund from anywhere around the world in as little as a few minutes," the company explained.</p>
<p>Rick Hutchins, Resorts World Las Vegas' SVP of Casino Operations, shared his excitement in a statement saying: "We knew when we launched the Mobile+ and Play+ technology it would be an iterative process as we would continue to make enhancements and improvements along the way for our guests."</p>
<p>He explained that the new collaboration with Sightline significantly reduces the time for consumers who want to use cashless technology when visiting the famous resort. Last but not least, Hutchins said: "I'm thrilled we're at the forefront of simplifying the process for our guests by giving them more time to focus on what they came here to do: enjoy themselves."</p>
<p>Omer Sattar, Sightline's Co-CEO, said about the latest deal: "We applaud Resorts World Las Vegas for being so forward-thinking, for working so diligently to create the best possible user experience, and for driving the whole industry forward."</p>
<p>He pointed out that the new update takes the cashless technology to a new level while at the same time enhancing the experience for the visitors. Finally, Sattar said: "We look forward to working with Resorts World Las Vegas on future generations."</p>
<p>Resorts World's latest announcement comes after last year, the venue was the first on the Las Vegas Strip to introduce cashless payment via mobile devices for anything within the venue. Back in June, the venue implemented the technology which enabled visitors to shop at retail outlets, use table games and slot machines paying conveniently via their mobile devices. This was the result of a collaboration between Resorts World and Sightline once again. In addition, the Nevada Gaming Control Board's Technology Division, as well as independent testing helped push forward the innovative technology.</p>
<p>Similarly, the remote identity verification implemented recently comes after Sightline spearheaded the efforts to implement changes to the gaming regulations in the state.</p>
