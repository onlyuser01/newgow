<p>Barcelona’s top scorer Robert Lewandowski is playing against his old team on Wednesday, October 26. This is going to be the second time Lewa is taking on Bayern Munich as a Barca player. His first match against his former club saw him put on a bleak performance, the same as most of his teammates. The result was that Bayern beat them 2-0.</p>
<p>A month and a half later, the two meet again, but this time, the game is taking place at Europe’s largest sports venue, Camp Nou in Barcelona. With the help of their fans, Barcelona players need to go for a win on Wednesday. Otherwise, their Champions League dream may come to an early end.</p>

<p>Barcelona Needs a Win on Wednesday</p>
<p>With a 100% win record in the 2022-23 Champions League, Bayern Munich is sitting in the #1 position in Group C. Whatever happens in the final two rounds of the group phase, Bayern will not drop out of the top two. What this means is that it’s guaranteed the German champ will play in the knockout phase of the Champions League in 2023.</p>
<p>Bayern will play in the UCL next year, but what about Barca? We don’t know yet. Xavi’s team has four points after four rounds, which puts them in the #3 position in the group standings. They’re three points behind Inter Milan who are almost certainly going to beat Viktoria Plzen.</p>
<p>What all this means is that in order to stay in the competition for a spot in the UCL knockouts, Barcelona needs to beat Bayern on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Bayern Munich Just Loves Playing against Barca</p>
<p>The German team has a very good record in the Barcelona vs Bayern Munich duels, winning each of the previous five. Bayern’s score differential in those five games is 19-4. Obviously, Bayern’s players love playing against this opponent, so it doesn’t matter much that they won’t be too fired up in Wednesday’s game.</p>
<p>They don’t have much motivation to win, but this doesn’t mean they don’t care about this game. The clash with Barcelona is a great opportunity for some of Bayern’s youngsters to get valuable experience. That said, we expect to see coach Julian Nagelsmann give chance to players like Mathys Tel, Jamal Musiala, and Ryan Gravenberch.</p>
<p>Barcelona vs Bayern Munich Prediction</p>
<p>In the previous five Barcelona vs Bayern Munich duels, there was a total of 23 goals, which accounts for 4.6 goals per game on average. We think Wednesday’s game too will see goals galore. Barcelona has no other option but to try and attack from the very first moment. Bayern will also play offensively, as this team doesn’t seem to know any other way.</p>
<p>Picks: Barcelona to win; over 3.5 goals</p>
