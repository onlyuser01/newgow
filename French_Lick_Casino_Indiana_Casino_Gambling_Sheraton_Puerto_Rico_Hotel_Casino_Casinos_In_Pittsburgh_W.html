<p>Should you both have any further questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to address them.</p>
<p>Nick, you will get an email from our team as requested very soon.</p>
<p>While I completely empathize with the frustration and disappointment this situation may have brought upon you, I want to assure you that we deeply regret the outcome. Unfortunately, our hands are tied as we must adhere to the stringent guidelines set by our security department. Please understand that we prioritize the protection of sensitive data and the confidentiality of our strategies, which is why we cannot disclose detailed information about our investigation process.</p>
<p>Unfair gambling activity undermines the integrity of our platform and negatively impacts other players. Consequently, winnings obtained through such activities cannot be withdrawn, as they are considered to have been acquired unfairly. However, we do allow the withdrawal of the initial deposit to ensure fairness and transparency.</p>
<p>I would like to draw your attention to the official email you received from our security department, which clearly outlines the violation of our Terms and Conditions. Specifically, it states that engaging in fraudulent behavior, such as creating multiple accounts, using automated betting software, or participating in arbitrage betting, is strictly prohibited. In such instances, we reserve the right to take action to prevent these fraudulent activities, including canceling bets, closing customer accounts, and, if necessary, involving law enforcement.</p>
<p>I'm the Head Manager of the Customer Reputation team, and I wanted to personally address the issue you've raised. First of all, I apologize for the delay in addressing your concerns. It has come to my attention that the reputation manager responsible for handling your complaint deviated from our established guidelines. Rest assured, appropriate measures are being taken, including additional training, to ensure more efficient handling of similar cases in the future.</p>
<p>The complaint was reopened on the casino's request with the following message:</p>
