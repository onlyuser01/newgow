<p>As Brazil is finalizing its gambling framework, SBC Summit Rio is heading into its inaugural edition set to take place on March 5-7, 2024, and bring with it many opportunities for local and international gambling industry stakeholders. With more than 2,000 delegates expected to attend the Brazilian-focused event, SBC is creating the very basis of the future iGaming and sports betting ecosystem, that will touch on so much more.</p>
<p>The event will be hosted at the Windsor Barra Hotel in Rio de Janeiro, a five-star hotel that is fit for the purpose. SBC CEO and Founder Rasmus Sojmark welcomed the opportunity to see the inaugural event take shape and bring industry stakeholders closer together in what is poised to be one of the most exciting markets in the gambling world.</p>
<p>"The conference agenda, featuring the foremost experts of the region, serves as a gateway for delegates to tap into a wealth of information, strategies, and best practices. The Brazilian market, known for its dynamism and complexity, presents unique challenges and opportunities."</p>
<p>In terms of speakers and panels, the event will host more than 100 experts, including Paula Young, Head of Commercial Activations, and International Relations at SAF Botafogo, Andre Gelfi, Director of Instituto Brasileiro de Jogo Responsável (IBJR), which is an industry-led initiative, and many others.</p>
<p>The event will cover a number of panels and different tracks with a particular focus on the emerging and highly-promising Brazilian market, including Marketing Innovation, Sports and Media, Tech Innovation, Compliance, and Sports Betting Innovation. There will also be a Leaders track that will bring together the industry and cover the industry’s first foray in Brazil.</p>
<p>Each of the tracks has been carefully picked to address a particular hot topic in the industry and help attendees garner a stronger and deeper understanding of the region. Compliance will of course be one of the most hotly-discussed and attended topics and tracks, as it would help companies better understand how federal and state licenses work, and how far they can take their business in Brazil, and possibly Latin America as well.</p>
<p>Sports betting will be a huge topic as Brazil’s gambling ecosystem is more or less based on this vertical, and the Sports Betting Innovation track will bring answers to some hot questions such as the success of traditional sports, but also the emerging verticals of esports and micro-betting which have shown promise and are possibly the next big thing in the market.</p>
