<p>The lifestyle brand turned sportsbook, MaximBet, has launched its latest sportsbook that went live last week in Indiana. The Maxim brand has become a powerhouse in the sports betting space, offering an exciting mix of lifestyle and sports betting products that are now available to US players in two states, following the Indiana launch.</p>
<p>However, MaximBet is not going to stop here, the brand acknowledges, as it readies to fire up its products elsewhere, including in crucial iGaming and betting states, such as Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and some newer markets, such as Ohio and Iowa.</p>
<p>The company is also looking to push its reach by establishing operations in Ontario, Canada and it is backed by trusted partnerships with companies such as Kambi Group and White Hat Gaming which assisted the company with its latest forays in Indiana and will most likely be part of future rollouts.</p>
<p>MaximBet CEO and Founder Daniel Graetzer welcomed the opportunity to introduce local players to the MaximBet product in Indiana and said that the company was moving quickly to get the most out of the NFL season and ride the crest of the NHL, NBA, and college basketball season as they unfold.</p>
<p>"We're unwavering in our commitment to bring sports fans the greatest sports betting experience in the world, and that starts with premium content and a world-class betting environment," Graetzer noted. His company has joined efforts with others, including Genius Sports in September, to pursue a long-term sustainable strategy in North America.</p>
<p>In the meantime, MaximBet has remained fully committed to upholding the highest industry and safety standards in the United States by joining US Integrity to provide products that are reliable and trusted across the county. As to the Indiana launch, the move marks an important development for the company. Once again, Kambi’s state-of-the-art wagering options are being deployed to assist with risk management, sports betting, compliance, and more.</p>
<p>The company is also putting forward the Bet Builder feature and Teaser+ to provide players with the best possible experience. The sportsbook is also launching for Android and iOS and the rollout was welcomed by both executives at Kambi and White Hat Gaming. The former’s CEO, Kristian Nylén, said that the company was thrilled to go live once again and roll out with MaximBet in Indiana as the lifestyle sportsbook seeks to establish its presence.</p>
<p>White Hat Gaming CEO Phil Gelvan added that the two companies had much in common and a similar vision of the future. He outlined an ambitious plan for the future. "Our ability to help manage the PAM technology will enable MaximBet to continue focusing on their aggressive growth plans over the next year," Gelvan concluded.</p>
