<p>The leading omnichannel game supplier based in the United Kingdom, Reflex Gaming, announced Monday it secured a license from the gambling regulator in Sweden, Spelinspektionen. It was back in 2020 when the company first entered the market and started delivering its leading online slots. The launch brought hits such as Dublin Up and Desperate Dawgs, among other popular titles.</p>
<p>Now, thanks to the license awarded by the Swedish Gambling Authority, Reflex Gaming confirmed its plans to grow further within the regulated gambling market in the country. Securing the license marks an important step in that process as it enables the provider to continue to offer its growing list of video slot games for partners in the country.</p>
<p>Mat Ingram, Reflex Gaming's CPO, shared his excitement about the recent news in a statement released on April 24, 2023, saying: "We're thrilled that we are one of the first suppliers to be granted a Swedish license."</p>
<p>He explained that Sweden represents an important market for the company and acknowledged that its content was well-received by Swedish players. Finally, Ingram noted: "We're delighted that players will be able to continue to enjoy our games as we have a fantastic roadmap of content lined up for 2023 and beyond!"</p>
<p>Securing the license from Spelinspektionen comes ahead of a planned change for the market in the country. Later this year, the Gambling Authority is set to implement new rules related to the gambling sector, requiring all providers of solutions and games to secure a license, allowing them to continue their operation.</p>
<p>Although this is a major change for the market, it is unlikely to cause hassles for the operators and providers that have already established their presence within the regulated gambling market in the country. Still, Sweden is one of the European countries that has robust regulations when it comes to the gambling sector.</p>
<p>Only recently, the Gambling Authority awarded another license to a developer of games and software for the iGaming vertical. Last week, the popular developer of content for the online gambling industry, Stakelogic, announced it secured approval from Spelinspektionen.</p>
<p>At the time of the announcement, the company's CEO, Stephan van den Oetelaar, explained that Sweden represents an important market for the company. He added that Stakelogic is thrilled "to be among the first to secure a supplier license." Besides Stakelogic, Stakelogic Live, the company's live dealer subsidiary, secured approval from the gambling regulator too.</p>
