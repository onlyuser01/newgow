    <h1>Hialeah Park Racing Casino Waterview Casino Brand New Promo Codes For Doubledown Casino Twin Pines C</h1>

<p>Players will be able to wager during league downtimes, creating many opportunities for sportsbooks</p>
<p>Kambi’s esports solution subsidiary Abios has launched a brand-new esoccer experience for sportsbooks. As a result, the firm’s partnering betting operators can curate an “engaging all-in-one betting experience.”</p>
<p>Leveraging BETER’s robust real-time data, the new solution features live odds, real-time widgets and streams. Offering around-the-clock content, Abios’ esoccer allows sportsbooks to provide fans with a constant stream of action.</p>
<p>The new product seeks to fill in the gap during downtimes between matches in the soccer calendar, allowing players to enjoy soccer betting whenever they want. Abios noted that the power of esports can mitigate gaps between events or during travel times, providing engaging year-round action to sports aficionados.</p>
<p>Abios’ esoccer sits at the convergence between traditional sports and esports, combining the best of both worlds. The company’s esoccer is built on a game where professional players control one team each. Matches are 8 minute long, allowing players to enjoy fast-paced bets.</p>
<p>Abios Will Help Operators Attract Players</p>
<p>Abios’ founder and chief executive officer, Oskar Fröberg, commented on the release of the new product. He said that his team’s goal was to leverage Abios’ long experience in creating highly technical data-driven products and data visualizations to create “something unique.” Fröberg added that his team is very happy to launch escoccer and thanked BETER for its help.</p>
<p>Detailing the qualities of the esoccer product, Fröberg said:</p>
<p>Our real-time odds are highly automated and produced through 3rd generation trading. This creates higher uptime, better accuracy and odds less prone to human errors, which can improve quality significantly. Oskar Fröberg, founder &amp; CEO, Abios</p>
<p>Fröberg added that the esoccer streams and widgets further elevate the experience by allowing fans to see the matches and receive live statistics directly in the sportsbook.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, BETER Esports’ general manager, Evgeniy Bekker, said that esports contests fill the gaps in the sports calendar, providing new opportunities for gambling operators. Bekker also said that having access to quality data is paramount to creating immersive wagering experiences, which is why it’s important for providers to work alongside trustworthy data partners.</p>
<p>BETER has emerged as the reliable provider of live data, live streaming, and odds for esports, and it’s great to see that such companies as Abios using our official data to build out engaging products and experiences for its operator partners to offer to their players. Evgeniy Bekker, general manager, BETER Esports</p>
<p>Bekker concluded that he expects a long and fruitful partnership with Abios.</p>
