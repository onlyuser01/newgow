    <h1>Monarch Casino Stonewolf Casino Atlantic City Bus Casino Hotels With Casinos Mcluck Casino Vegas Wil</h1>

<p>I joined the site end of March, made a withdrawal on 31st March 22, was asked to send countless paperwork with I did on the 1st April… had email to say my withdrawal had been approved on 5th april- this was a £50 withdrawal.</p>
<p>I made another withdrawal on 7th April. For £85 again they needed more paperwork which I sent straight away, was advised they had the paper work.</p>
<p>was told that they advise 5 working days for a withdrawal to be approved then another 7 working days for it to "enter" your account.</p>
<p>my first withdrawal should have entered my account on 14th April.</p>
<p>I’ve contacted them numperous times to be told it’s been sent, and they want more paperwork.</p>
<p>im happy to sent this but there is a charge from my bank for a statement which I do not feel I should have to pay as this is their mistake!!.</p>
<p>I have countless emails and screen shots of chats I’ve had promising me this money should be in my account of of that day and still Nothing.</p>
