<p>Wazdan has extended its reach in the iGaming market in the United Kingdom through a new partnership with Kindred-owned 32Red, a prominent local casino operator and brand. As a result, the supplier will be able to deploy a range of its top-performing titles and games with the company and allow its players to access excellent games, such as Hot Slot: Mystery Jackpot Joker, 9 Coins, Hot Slot: 777 Crown, Dwarfs Fortune, and Burning Sun, among others.</p>
<p>Wazdan will also be adding more games in the future, including Power of Sun: Svarog, Sizzling Eggs, and Hot Slot: 777 Rubies which are bound to appeal to players at 32Red. All of the supplier’s games come along with various mechanics that are designed to boost engagement and offer players the opportunity to enjoy their game a bit further.</p>
<p>Some of the features that Wazdan has been deploying include but aren’t limited to the Cash Infinity and Hold the Jackpot bonus solutions which have become staples of the Wazdan experience. Commenting on this new content opportunity, Wazdan Chief Commercial Officer Andrzej Hyla said that the company was "extremely" excited to be joining efforts with 32Red to bring even more worthwhile games and content to the operator’s players.</p>
<p>"They’ve had consistent success in the market, operating to the highest standards and becoming one of the UK’s best-known gaming companies, so we’re delighted to be partnering with 32Red and delivering our quality portfolio of games," Hyla said,</p>
<p>Kindred Group Commercial Operations Manager Adam Newnham was similarly pleased with the new content opportunity. Newnham hailed the quality of Wazdan’s games and said that they are bound to strike home with 32Red’s players in the United Kingdom. The brand was delighted to be moving forward with this content tie-up and was prepared to follow up with even more content by Wazdan, Newnham said.</p>
<p>Wazdan has been making steady forays with its content over the past months. The company signed up a seminal partnership with Livespins to have its excellent games featured as part of the streaming experience on the platform. In the meantime, the supplier has also been able to grow its presence in Switzerland and the Netherlands through localized content deals.</p>
