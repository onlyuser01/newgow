<p>Former SVP at FOX Network Groups has detailed his Blok Sports blockchain-based sports betting project that will offer to make up for the shortcomings of traditional sportsbooks.</p>
<p>Mitchell Chun Sees Blok Sports as Better Future of Betting</p>
<p>Blok Sports founder and CEO Mitchell Chun has vast experience in the world of sports and now sports betting. A former SVP for Fox Networks Group himself, Chun’s Blok Sports solution promises to add more excitement to the betting landscape in the United States.</p>
<p>His app, which will allow friends to bet on sports against each other, is running on blockchain technology, a high-value but still underappreciated piece of tech in the United States and beyond.</p>
<p>In a recent conversation with LA Business Journal, Chun explained how his experience at the helm of a media sports group has helped him shape the type of betting experience he wants to see baked into Blok Sports.</p>
<p>In development since 2019, the platform is still a work in progress. It’s touted as a “wager-making solution” where friends get to bet against each other. Chun is banking on the underpinning blockchain which should add more transparency to ensure fairness.</p>
<p>Introducing the Building Blocks to Make It All Work</p>
<p>Next for Blok Sports is a token-based betting system, although it will come only after a F2P game for NCAA March Madness has been put in place. Chun sees the platform as a place people can make bets, amass points and win various prizes, outlining the availability of a social and a competitive experience.</p>
<p>Blok Sports successfully finalized a seed funding round, adding $1.3 million to its coffers which will allow it to scale up its offer and bring more hands-on deck. While not entirely clear who the investors were, Chun explained that they represented some important media and sports parties.</p>
<p>Blok Sports already faces a sizable competition out there, but Chun believes his product will stand its ground and provide a safer payment processing system and platform for consumers who are interested in casual sports betting, as well as betting in a more competitive form.</p>
<p>“There are a lot of risks associated with a traditional sportsbook,” Chun argued in front of the media outlet. Yet, he seems convinced that Blok Sports can solve those and more.</p>
