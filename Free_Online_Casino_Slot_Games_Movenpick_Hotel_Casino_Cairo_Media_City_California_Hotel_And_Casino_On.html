    <h1>Free Online Casino Slot Games Movenpick Hotel Casino Cairo Media City California Hotel And Casino On</h1>

<p>Caesars Entertainment and Rivers Casino are looking to solve the problem that the US casino industry is currently facing – a shortage of workforce in the sector. Both brands are looking to hire more people and have come up with different approaches to the problem.</p>
<p>Caesars Entertainment Will Host a National Day of Hiring</p>
<p>Shortly after Caesars teamed up with Henrik Lundqvist to promote its NY launch, the company is now looking to add more people to its team by hosting a national day of hiring on February 24. At this event, all potential team members will have the chance to learn more about the brand and the opportunities that would be available to them in the company.</p>
<p>Some of the benefits that future employees would enjoy at Caesars include paid time off, employee discounts, top-rated and affordable healthcare, as well as professional development. The company encourages all those who are planning to go to the event to dress professionally and bring a resume copy.</p>
<p>Matt Krystofiak, Caesars SVP human resources operations, shared a few words on hosting the national day of hiring by saying that Caesars is present all across the US and it encompasses numerous brands, including Horseshoe, Harrah’s, as well as Caesars Sportsbook, which recently partnered with MSU Athletics. Thanks to the company’s wide array of working fields, there will be many options for people looking to start their careers. He went on to say that by launching the national day of hiring, Caesars will build awareness of the benefits that it provides for its employees.</p>
<p>Rivers Casino Is Offering Free Courses</p>
<p>On the other hand, Rivers Casino has a different approach to the labor shortage in the US casino industry. Currently, the company is looking for table games dealers and is willing to hire 20 people and provide them with a six-week free course.</p>
<p>Apart from the 20 full-time employees, Rivers is also looking for 30 part-time dealers. As the company states, dealer schools usually cost around $5,000, but Rivers is more than happy to cover that expense for its future employees.</p>
<p>Training will start on February 14at its training center, which is located at 220 Harborside Drive, Suite 201, Schenectady. Classes will run from Monday to Friday from 7 pm to 11 pm. In order to participate in the course, all applicants need to be older than 21.</p>
<p>Once participants in the school pass the audition and obtain a license, they will be offered a full-time or part-time working position at Rivers. Shuttle bus service from the local CDTA blue line stop will be provided by the casino as well. Rivers noted that the candidates must be flexible for working hours, meaning that they must be able to work during holidays, weekends, and in various shifts.</p>
