<p>The new seven-year business-to-business A1 license in Greece complements the company's growth and allows it to expand further</p>
<p>The fast-growing provider for the online gambling industry, Soft2Bet, confirmed it continues its European expansion by securing a new license. On Tuesday, the company revealed that it has been granted a business-to-business (B2B) A1 license in Greece. The latest license complements Soft2Bet’s Greek expansion and comes after recently, the company secured two seven-year licenses from the Hellenic Gaming Commission’s (HGC) Gaming Supervision and Control Commission.</p>
<p>Thanks to the most recent A1 license, Soft2Bet can now deliver its betting platform services, gaming platform services and games to licensed business-to-customer (B2C) operators within the regulated gambling market in the country. According to the iGaming software developer, the license marks an important milestone in its expansion in Greece and ensures that it follows the highest international regulatory standards.</p>
<p>The fresh seven-year license reaffirms Soft2Bet’s commitment to expand in Greece while complying with the established regulations. It enables the company to forge long-lasting agreements within the market in the country, delivering its innovative and quality content and services to new audiences. Additionally, the license allows Soft2Bet to provide its supplier services to licensed operators in the European country.</p>
<p>Expanding the global footprint is an ongoing goal for the company which also seeks to grow its portfolio of technological solutions. Focused on innovation, Soft2Bet continues to develop engaging B2B solutions that bring efficiencies and benefits to the company’s partners.</p>
<p>Besides Greece, recently, Soft2Bet secured a license in Romania. Early last month, the company revealed that it secured a license to offer B2B products and services for customers on the market. The announcement came after Soft2Bet was awarded a license from the gambling regulator in Romania, ONJN.</p>
<p>The License Marks a Milestone for the Company’s Growth in Greece</p>
<p>While growth and expansion are ongoing goals for Soft2Bet, the company remains committed to offering supreme and unrivaled betting experiences for its partners and their customers as well. This is why the iGaming developer is proud to continue expanding its offering by bringing innovative solutions that stand out with efficiencies and build strong B2B bonds.</p>
<p>“Obtaining this license was a collaborative endeavor. Our interaction with the HGC exemplifies the best of partnerships.“ David Yatom, general counsel at Soft2Bet</p>
<p>Soft2Bet’s general counsel, David Yatom, explained that the latest license in Greece comes after an effective collaboration with the gambling regulator, the HGC. He explained that the new license reaffirms the company’s dedication to growing and expanding its presence. Finally, Yatom deemed the license as a significant milestone that comes amid other important achievements of the company in the last few months.</p>
