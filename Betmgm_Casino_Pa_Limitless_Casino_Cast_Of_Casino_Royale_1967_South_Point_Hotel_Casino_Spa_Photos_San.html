<p>Lost Relics review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Have you ever wanted to play Indiana Jones, rooting through trap-filled temples filled with ancient artefacts in search of something that will make your fortune? The bygone era of archaeological adventure serials may be over, but you can make your own in Lost Relics.</p>
<p>With a desert setting, Ancient Greek and Roman inflected designs on the reels and 1930’s explorer motifs in the background, Lost Relics has an exciting world with a ton of implied story behind it.</p>
<p>As expected, high quality visuals in a slot from NetEnt</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>A lot of what brings this slot to life is the detail in the designs. The steampunk mechanics of the Scatter icons, the dieselpunk visuals of the campground and the mythological resonance of Greek helmets and Roman bracelets rendered in a style more intricate that would have been possible back then.</p>
<p>The art style is augmented by the usual excellent design that NetEnt brings to most of their work. The animations are tasteful and varied. The music draws you in, and the sound effects do the job of building tension before a win and exciting the player after a win.</p>
<p>Big wins can come up quite easily in Lost Relics slot</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Lost Relics is played on a five by five grid onto which the symbols fall. If you get six or more of the same symbols in a group (i.e. touching vertically or horizontally – diagonals do not count) then you get paid. The larger the group, the larger the payout.</p>
<p>There is no cascade system, although in the free spins there is an element of one spin’s result affecting the next (see the section on "chests" below).</p>
<p>The gameplay is pretty simple, but it is also fast paced and varied, especially when you add in the wilds, bonuses and free spins...</p>
<p>Unlocking treasures in free spins bonus game extends your bonus round</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>There are a set of three random features which can be triggered after any winning spin. After a win on a reel, up to five of these events can be triggered per spin – with each event being a random one of the three features.</p>
<p>These random features are the Coin Win, Extra Wild and Extra Scatter events.</p>
<p>In a Coin Win one of the symbols from a winning combo changes to a coin which pays out between three and thirty times the bet.</p>
<p>With luck, Extra Wilds random event can boost your winnings on any spin</p>
<p>Extra Wild adds three random wilds to the board. Since you can have up to five events and they could all be Extra Wilds you can have a maximum of fifteen wilds added to the reel on any one spin.</p>
<p>In the Extra Scatter event, one of the winning symbols is converted to a Scatter.</p>
<p>One of 3 random features that can help you get a free spins bonus - Extra Scatter event</p>
<p>If you land three Scatters on one spin, you trigger the Free Spin bonus game. In this game, you receive ten free spins. During these spins, a chest is placed behind a grid of three by three times on the board. When the symbol on a tile is part of a winning combo, it is destroyed. The destroyed tiles remain destroyed until the chest is opened.</p>
<p>You open a chest by destroying all the tiles above it. When this happens, the chest opens and awards you a combination of additional free spins, sticky wilds and a number of coins which are added to your winnings for the free spin rounds.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player on Lost Relics is 96.30%. This is around the industry average.</p>
<p>The slot has medium volatility, paying out reasonably frequently. We prefer slots with higher volatility than this, as generally, our strategies work better with high volatility slots.</p>
<p>Lost Relics' paytable pays for 6 symbols, up to all 25</p>
<p>The largest bet per spin on the site we tested was £/$/€400.00 and the smallest bet per spin allowed is £/$/€0.20.</p>
<p>The maximum win per spin is one-thousand times your bet per spin.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Lost Relics is another beautiful addition to the NetEnt stable. If you enjoy that mix of ancient history and 20th Century archaeology you will probably get on with its style.</p>
<p>Behind the scenes, it has a reasonable return to player but is a little less volatile that we would normally like. Overall it is a nice game, but we would probably suggest something a little more in line with our recommended strategies.</p>
