<p>AYX, an Asia-focused sportsbook, has reinforced its exposure on the Italian and Spanish markets through partnership deals with AS Roma and Atlético de Madrid respectively. The company has negotiated marketing contracts, allowing it to enhance its advertising efforts in both countries according to local regulatory norms.</p>
<p>AYX Breaks Ground in Italy with AS Roma Partnership</p>
<p>With both Italy and Spain tightening the screws on gambling advertisements, AYX will have to play smart. In Italy, the company will use AS Roma’s branding power and bring its intellectual property to Asian social media channels while at home, the club will use LED displays to show AYX’s logo.</p>
<p>Commenting on this partnership, AYX CMO Steven Chang said that millions of users now stood to benefit from the unique growth opportunities presented by the deal. Growth is indeed what excites Chang who said that AYX’s association to AS Roma would give the company a fresh consumer-acquisition push.</p>
<p>Not least, AYX is focusing on Asia, a market of huge and often untapped potential. “This new partnership will open up new opportunities for strategic development and a mutual win-win, ushering in a new era for sports gaming and entertainment,” Chang concluded.</p>
<p>The partnership has been welcomed by AS Roma commercial director Giorgio Brambilla expressed confidence that through the partnership, the companies would be able to advance their commercial strategy globally.</p>
<p>AS Roma is not new in the Asian market either having previously collaborated with Allwin City.</p>
<p>Stronger in Spain</p>
<p>Another pivotal deal for the sportsbook has been signed with Atlético de Madrid in Spain, allowing AYX to break into the Spanish market and seek broader recognition and enhanced awareness. The partnership will last until June 2023, with the option for renewal, and feature various marketing activations.</p>
<p>Commenting on this partnership, Chang said that Atlético de Madrid had the right set of values to help AYX in its own pursuit of further growth, and added:</p>
<p>“Atlético de Madrid’s influence will reinforce even further our branding, which is absolutely a breakthrough for AYX.”</p>
<p>Not least, Chang said that AYX is committed to looking out and help with the further development of sports in the country. As to Atlético de Madrid, the soccer club is happy with the developments, as confirmed by the club’s commercial director Inigo Aznar who noted that adding AYX was an important step forward in the expansion of the club’s clout in Asian markets.</p>
<p>The partnership comes in the rather fraught context of Spain’s re-regulation of the market and tighter consumer-protection measures. The country is looking to create a new body that would harmonize gambling.</p>
<p>While self-exclusion in Spain has grown by 12% during the pandemic, the country’s online sports betting has been the biggest contribution in terms of gross gambling revenue (GGR) in the third quarter of 2020.</p>
