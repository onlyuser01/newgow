<p>According to a Monday note from Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd., Macau's gross gaming revenue (GGR) for the first 20 days of February was only 35% of that in February 2019. This period includes the Chinese New Year (CNY) holiday, which had seen a significant uptick in activity.</p>
<p>In 2019, the CNY was on February 5. It was a busy time for Macau's casinos. The lunar new year this year occurred on February 1. Traffic was slower this year, although GGR increased from its 2021 level.</p>
<p>Channel checks showed that Macau's GGR was MOP6.3 billion ($784 million) for February 1-20, with an average daily rate of MOP315 million ($39.15 million). According to Bernstein analyst Vitaly Umansky, this was down 65% compared to February 2019's average daily rate of MOP906 million ($112.6 million).</p>
<p>GGR for February 14-20, this year was down 57% week to week due to "seasonality after Chinese New Year holiday," according to the analyst.</p>
<p>However, February's performance was still 21% better than February 2021's average daily rate of MOP261 million ($32.44 million).</p>
<p>In reference to the ongoing testing protocols and other restrictions inbound travel to Macau as COVID-19 countermeasures, Umansky stated, "The Winter Olympics ended on Sunday (February 20), and there are hopes that China may slightly relax travel policy post-Olympics - but we do not see any near-term positive developments."</p>
<p>Mainland China has a largely unrestricted travel agreement with Macau.</p>
<p>The institution estimated that the average daily rate of Macau's VIP GGR in February was up 70% compared to January. However, Umansky pointed out that the high-roller segment had been reduced by 50% month-on-month in January 2022 and was down 45% from December 2021, with a lower-than-normal hold rate.</p>
<p>According to several statements from the city's casino operators, the collaboration between Macau casino operators and government-licensed VIP gambling promoters (also known as junkets) has been mostly suspended. Analysts have suggested that this has led to casinos taking on high-roller customers as direct-managed customers.</p>
<p>The Bernstein analyst estimates that the Macau market's monthly mass GGR had increased by 50% between January and February.</p>
