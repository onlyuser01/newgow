<p>Kambi Group has expanded its US footprint thanks to an Ohio-facing agreement with Miami Valley Gaming and Racing</p>
<p>Kambi Group, a leading global sports betting solutions provider, has agreed to power Miami Valley Gaming and Racing with its acclaimed sportsbook technology. The deal will help the operator enhance its new retail sportsbook ahead of launch.</p>
<p>Kambi Expands US Presence with Miami Valley Gaming Deal</p>
<p>As announced, the multi-year deal will see Kambi provide its tech to Miami Valley Gaming’s new land-based sportsbook in Ohio. The property, situated between Cincinnati and Dayton, will employ Kambi’s award-winning sports betting technology to offer its customers premium betting experiences.</p>
<p>Miami Valley Gaming and Racing is a joint venture between the famous racing operator Churchill Downs Incorporated and Delaware North. By leveraging Kambi’s tested high-performance sportsbook, Miami Valley Gaming will be able to augment its existing gaming floor. As a result, the operator will be able to leverage Kambi’s unparalleled Bet Builder tech and cutting-edge betting kiosks to engage bettors.</p>
<p>Ohio is a fresh market that Miami Valley Gaming and the companies behind it are keen to explore. The Buckeye State legalized sports betting just recently, officially launching its regulated sports betting market in January this year. As the seventh largest state in the country, Ohio promises to be a flourishing wagering market.</p>
<p>The Operator Wants to Provide Customers with Convenient and Intuitive Betting</p>
<p>Miami Valley Gaming’s president and general manager, Craig Robinson, spoke about the agreement with Kambi. He noted that his team has been working hard to create a sports betting offering that is both convenient and intuitive.</p>
<p>Robinson said that his team is now preparing to launch its new retail sportsbook in Ohio. Because of that, the president is glad to have Kambi’s backing and is delighted by the opportunity to leverage the provider’s best-in-class technology.</p>
<p>We look forward to adding another great amenity to our property, offering Miami Valley Gaming’s loyal customers a state-of-the-art sports betting experience. Craig Robinson, president &amp; GM, Miami Valley Gaming and Racing</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Kristian Nylén, Kambi’s co-founder and chief executive officer, said that his team is happy to join forces with Miami Valley Gaming in what he called an “exciting partnership.” Not only will this agreement supply the operator with the tech it needs, but it would also help the supplier further grow its US footprint, the CEO added.</p>
<p>As one of the most populous states in the US, Ohio presents a significant opportunity for those operators committed to delivering high-quality sports betting experiences and we are thrilled to bring our world-class sports betting technology to Miami Valley Gaming. Kristian Nylén, CEO, Kambi Group</p>
<p>As mentioned, Ohio just launched its sports wagering market. In the wake of the launch, Gov. Mike DeWine stated that he is determined to enforce the betting advertising rules.</p>
