<p>The international sports betting and gambling company Entain has extended its streaming three-party agreement with betting content and production services provider Sports Information Services and the Racecourse Media Group. The new deal is set to expire in 2026.</p>
<p>Entain Renews the Deal</p>
<p>For Entain, this renewal of this partnership is a part of its overall strategy of enhancing the retail experience for its clients and providing them with quality live horse racing content.</p>
<p>Andy Hicks, the managing director of retail in the United Kingdom and Ireland at Entain, shared that his company takes pride in showcasing exciting and engaging content and, in turn, providing customers with the best experience possible.</p>
<p>“This partnership will ensure our customers can enjoy high-quality content live from the most iconic horse racing events in the UK – and is a key part of our investment in digital services across retail,” Hicks said.</p>
<p>With the deal extended, Entain will continue powering its Coral and Ladbrokes brands with media feeds from 35 racecourses across the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>The company will also use the deal as a stepping stone to improve the overall quality of its sports betting terminals for its Coral and Ladbrokes brands, as well as invest in digital services that will help to synchronize its retail and online offerings.</p>
<p>RMG and SIS Are Glad to Continue Working with Entain</p>
<p>The chief executive officer of Racecourse Media Group, Martin Stevenson, is glad to extend the deal since RMG values the relationship it has with the betting company.</p>
<p>“We’re delighted our racecourses’ quality, core racing content will continue to be enjoyed by its [Entain’s] customers,” Stevenson said.</p>
<p>He added that Entain’s decision to commit to the partnership for the next five years attests to the strength of RMG and SIS’s offerings.</p>
<p>Stevenson added that both his company and SIS are looking forward to continuing working closely with Entain and bringing “market-leading horseracing to some of the UK’s most iconic betting brands.”</p>
<p>SIS is just as glad to continue collaborating with RMG and Entain. Its chief executive officer, Richard Ames, said that he was very pleased to extend SIS’s partnership with the latter, as all parties involved in the agreement have a shared mission of delivering prime value to racecourses and bookmakers.</p>
<p>“Through this latest deal, SIS remains a key component of the value chain that ensures the horse racing industry and bookmakers collaborate successfully, bringing entertaining experiences to bettors across the UK and around the world,” Ames concluded.</p>
<p>RMG and SIS had already extended their partnership as of June 2021.</p>
