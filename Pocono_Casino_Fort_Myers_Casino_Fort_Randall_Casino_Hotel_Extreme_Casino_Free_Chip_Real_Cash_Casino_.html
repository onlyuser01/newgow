<p>Super Group is bidding Alger farewell as it no longer needs a director of corporate communications, the ex-director said</p>
<p>Super Group, the holding behind the online gambling brands Betway and Spin, is parting ways with Alan Alger, its director of corporate communications. This marks the end of Alger’s long career with the company.</p>
<p>The announcement was made by Alger who spoke of his departure on LinkedIn and Twitter. He noted that his eight and a half years with Super Groups are now over and that he is now actively looking for new opportunities.</p>
<p>Alger became a part of Super Group in 2014 when he joined Betway as a PR manager. He served in this position for five years before being promoted to head of corporate communications and PR. In 2021, Alger was welcomed into Betway’s parent company and served as Super Group’s director of corporate communications for almost a year and a half.</p>
<p>The Group Doesn’t Need a Director of Corporate Comm Anymore</p>
<p>In his post, Alger provided further insight into his departure from the company.</p>
<p>After nearly eight and a half years of loyal service and wholehearted dedication to Super Group and its associated brands (including Betway), my time in the business has come to an end. Alan Alger</p>
<p>According to Alger, Super Group no longer needs a director of corporate communications. Speaking of the company, Alger wished its team all the best, noting that there are some great people working for Super Group.</p>
<p>Alger concluded his announcement by saying that he is “actively seeking opportunities.”</p>
<p>Since Alger noted that Super Group no longer requires a director of corporate communications, it is almost certain that no one will succeed Alger in the position.</p>
<p>Alger was instrumental in many of the latest Super Group developments, having helped the company go public on the NYSE.</p>
<p>Recent Super Group Developments</p>
<p>In other news, Super Group recently acquired Digital Gaming Corporation, expanding its presence in 12 US markets. This was a major deal for the company, which is bullish on augmenting its footprint in the United States. However, Super Group quickly decided to sell DGC’s non-core B2B division.</p>
<p>At the beginning of 2023, the NYSE-listed holding authorized a $23 million share buyback program, looking to regain its sold shares. The program has a flexible date set to December 31 and can be postponed or concluded earlier. What the company called a “modest share repurchase program” is expected to demonstrate the optimal use of cash in relation to different types of scenarios on the market.</p>
