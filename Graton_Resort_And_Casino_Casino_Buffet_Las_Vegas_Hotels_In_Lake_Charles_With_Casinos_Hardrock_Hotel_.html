    <h1>Graton Resort And Casino Casino Buffet Las Vegas Hotels In Lake Charles With Casinos Hardrock Hotel</h1>

<p>The supplier has become the latest to secure the coveted license from the Malta Gaming Authority, allowing it to pursue further growth</p>
<p>Under the conditions of an MGA license, ELA Games will be able to significantly scale its presence across Europe and jurisdictions that specifically recognize the country’s accreditation.</p>
<p>MGA Opens New Opportunities for ELA Games</p>
<p>MGA has become synonymous with good standards in the gambling industry, winning companies that operate under such permit a reputation for reliability and trustworthiness. ELA Games, which is a fairly new studio on the market, will be able to share its library of innovative, visually-rich, and mechanically-clever titles with new partners.</p>
<p>Among the titles that the company offers are such blockbuster options as Sugar Spins, Cash of Gods, Lucky Dwarfs, Vikings Wild Cash, Book of Meow, Detective Fortune, and others.</p>
<p>ELA Games business owner Mike Cini said has been highly receptive to this opportunity, arguing that his company was indeed happy to receive the Recognition Notice from the regulator. He added:</p>
<p>Malta is the leading iGaming hub in Europe and being authorized there will enable us to work even more closely with our operators and bring player engagement to the next level for our partners. ELA Games business owner Mike Cini</p>
<p>ELA Games Adds to a Series of Licenses</p>
<p>ELA Games has made a point of building products that offer an elevated experience to partner operators and are marked by distinct features that lead to better player engagement and retention.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, ELA Games also secured a license in Romania, positioning the supplier as a company that is looking to consolidate its presence in the European market first and foremost.</p>
<p>Similarly, ELA Games pursued an opportunity to make its games known through the EveryMatrix aggregation platform dedicated to making it simpler for the supplier’s games to reach new markets and audiences. Aggregation has been the way forward for many companies, not just ELA Games.</p>
