    <h1>Borgata Casino Hotel Bally S Chicago Casino Online Casino Singapore Casinos In Wi Casino Evansville</h1>

<p>I was playing only in sports pre game. Didn't touch the casino section at all. Also didn't use any sports bonus. I deposited 50€ and by winning bets I made them to 213€. Prior to that deposit I was playing normally again only in sports betting section (played also in casino some bonus money they credit me after deposits but only losing in the live casino). They also successfully allowed me to withdraw my money. But now they closed my account and seem unwilling to contact me further. Also on important point is that I am affiliated via oddsprat.nu a Norwegian casino/sports group that gets a commission from us the players for signing up to these sites. But the logic is if something unexpected happens, they should be on us the player side to help. They also seem unwilling to help. So I want to publically shame on them and advise you to avoid this Nordic group and if I am incorrect I expect an honest answer from their side too. Affiliate links generate you money but also responsibility! Hope slot palace really give a straight answer and tell me what hurted them from my side so much. Were my bets sharp? Well probably but I can ensure you these odds were general available and surely odds palace hadn't wrong odds in that essence. I am glad and happy that you give me the spotlight in these unfair time that me an ant have to face a multimillionaire company with all the legislation in its side. Thanks you nevertheless.</p>
