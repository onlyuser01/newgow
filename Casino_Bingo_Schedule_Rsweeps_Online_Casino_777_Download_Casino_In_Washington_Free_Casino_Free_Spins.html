    <h1>Casino Bingo Schedule Rsweeps Online Casino 777 Download Casino In Washington Free Casino Free Spins</h1>

<p>First let me start off by saying that I have requested a transcript of every live chat sense this has started and my email still hasn't not been sent a single one. After being told by agent and the screenshots show provided show the terms that I needed and did make my 1st deposit in the amount of 10 dollars for verification. The agent and also in the terms it states the the funds from the verification needed to be wager 1x through minimum prior to being able to request a withdraw. For crypto deposits it required the fund be wagered 3x through prior to request a withdraw. Prior having made the deposit of $10 dollars, my balance from $440.00. Having made that deposit with crypto I to the balance down to $400.00/ This made clear that the 10 deposited was wagered as well a 3 times that 10. And just to be sure I was covered as for a the wagering requirements for the verification deposited funds I left 20 still on the account and made the request to with 380.00. Withdrawal for $380 was rejected and the funds were not returned back to my balance as the now say they were voided. In a catch twenty-two the reason was terms violation for "mixing" funds. I did exactly move by move play by play what there live chat support agents also in black and white what there terms state need to be done in order to make a withdrawal and have it be from your first withdrawal having to still need to make a1timeverification deposit. what happened. This is what there terms stated and what the agent told me I needed to do to get my balance withdrawn. That was my 1st withdrawal after making my 1st deposit in order for verification to make that withdrawal I had to make a deposit of $10 1st period then in order to withdraw the money I had to wager through the deposit I had just made Or else I wouldn't be able to make the withdrawal. There was no mixing of funds and I would never try to go against the bonus terms or do anything that would jeopardize the Available balance and I was only doing what I was told I needed to do in order to make and process that withdrawal via the terms. Please get back to me as soon as possible so that way we can get this fixed as I have been told by live chat and by there pitboss and email support those fund are voided and that I have been mistaken and violated there terms. List In every email and ever live chat which there were 6 seperate live chat transcripts from individual agent who 5 out of the 6 just closed the chat and hung up on me, The last one gave me the common courtesy of not doing that. But none of them could or did answer me when I asked them what the procedure would be and where I went wrong in making the request and deposit. How would someone "properly" of withdrawn those funds. No one answered me. Because they know as do two of my good buddies who referred me to them know that that procedure and the process that followed was the exact way to cover all ends and make sure all terms are being met. Finally one of the last thing they said during the final and last live chat I had about 50 minutes ago was that the way would've been to make that deposit, do no wagering and requested the withdrawal of 440.00. I wish I am joking here but I am not. As this I know to be the procedure of some other types of welcome no deposit free spin pokies casinos out there. The real time gaming and there sister casinoextreme.eu for example. But see I was specifically told not just by my buddy's who've been through this process and successfully withdrawn but by there own live chat support and specifically in their terms I have provided screenshots of that any and all funds need to be wagered through once or 3 time depending on the funding source. They know i would've been glad to not of wagered anything and requested that immediately right away. The agent responded and said that this is the procedure because with that 10 dollar deposit the requirement the documents as well. And that when I caught him in a bold face lie because I have emails sent to other players and myself after having uploaded identity documents them asking and requesting the when take those files back and that as we are crypto depositors that there no need for identification documentation. He didn't hang up that chat but only responded back with your not getting the 380.00 refunded to your account. P.S I have more files to provide like the screenshots I was referring to and the emails as I was only able to upload 5 documents when sending this in. If they ever actually send my the transcripts of the live chat supports that I requested each and every time I had one I will happily send those ein too. People need to know that this is a bait and hook and one of the oldest tricks in the book that shade tree casino use to take advantage of player and or try to get of of having to pay out funds. And the exact type of crap that gives us hobbyist players and all online casinos a bad rep and look and this has to stop and they need to reimburse the funds ether</p>
