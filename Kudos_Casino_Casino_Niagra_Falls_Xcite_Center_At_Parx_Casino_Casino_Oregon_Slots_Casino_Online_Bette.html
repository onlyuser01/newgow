    <h1>Kudos Casino Casino Niagra Falls Xcite Center At Parx Casino Casino Oregon Slots Casino Online Bette</h1>

<p>Sports media group dedicated to developing educational platforms for the online casino gaming industry Better Collective continued to build on its team of executives with the appointment of Mikkel Munch-Jacobsgaard as Director of Investor Relations.</p>
<p>Experience in International Capital Markets</p>
<p>The appointment of Mikkel Munch-Jacobsgaard as Better Collective’s new Director of Investor Relations effective from June 1, 2022, will fill the void left by Christina Bastius Thomsen who decided to take a new role at the business as Head of Corporate Compliance and Sustainability.</p>
<p>Commenting on the new appointment, Better Collective’s chief financial officer Flemming Pedersen outlined the long-standing links between Better Collective and Munch-Jacobsgaard.</p>
<p>“In Better Collective we have known Mikkel for a long time, through our investor relations work, and have always been impressed with his knowledge of Better Collective’s business, the trends driving our industry and not least his deep understanding of the dynamics of the equity markets.” Flemming Pedersen, CFO, Better Collective</p>
<p>Munch-Jacobsgaard is set to bring to Better Collective vast experience from the international capital markets acquired while serving in Institutional Equity Sales roles at Danske Bank and SEB, where he leveraged his deep insights into the markets to advise pan-European clients on equity investments in the Nordic markets.</p>
<p>“In our management team we are convinced that Mikkel’s professional skills and personality is a perfect match for Better Collective and our ambition to further build strong relations to our external stakeholders.” Flemming Pedersen, CFO, Better Collective</p>
<p>As for Munch-Jacobsgaard, he has been following closely the developments at Better Collective since the initial public offering (IPO) the company conducted back in 2018 and has acquired a deep understanding of the company’s business and the industry trends during that time.</p>
<p>Munch-Jacobsgaard is the latest addition to Better Collective following in the footsteps of the appointment of Adam Rosenberg as Head of Marketing &amp; Communications in the US in February, who was hired to leverage his experience across digital marketing, branding, and communication in technology, esports, and sports betting industries, as well as lead the group’s efforts in the US.</p>
<p>Focus on M&amp;A</p>
<p>In March, Better Collective forked out €21.4 million to acquire Canada Sports Betting (CSB) ahead of the official market launch in Ontario and get its hand on CSB’s information related to sports betting operators which currently accept Canadian customers.</p>
<p>In April, Better Collective parted with €105 million for the acquisition of Futbin, a platform with a focus on video gaming and esports assets linked to the FIFA titles and, according to Better Collective, the leading esports brand for all things FIFA.</p>
