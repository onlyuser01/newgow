    <h1>Casino Starfield Casino Shawnee Ok Casino In Northern California Free Casino Bus Trips Near Me Direc</h1>

<p>Hello. Casino accuses me of something I didn't do. They canceled my winnings and they not gonna give it away. They blocked my account in accordance with rule 10.1.</p>
<p>"During the use of the Services provided by Dozenspins, users shall not:</p>
<p>-Register and use additional/duplicate accounts</p>
<p>-Engage in fraudulent or criminal activities. "</p>
<p>I only have one account, I did not register other accounts. Moreover, I played in this casino 1 time. This is my first conclusion. I do not understand what fraudulent or criminal actions they are talking about. It's absurd.</p>
<p>I went through several verification stages. I sent personal documents, photos, statements and even videos from my computer screen.</p>
<p>The casino cancelled my winnings in accordance with rule 11.6. They wrote that my violation led to damage to the company and so they confiscated my money. They didn't explain how I hurt the company. I believe that such an accusation is illegal and the casino is not entitled to take my money.</p>
<p>I think this is a serious charge and the casino should provide evidence if they believe me guilty. I insist that I did not violate the rules of the casino. I don't understand how to prove my innocence and get my win. I'm asking for your help.</p>
