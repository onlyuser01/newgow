    <h1>Desert Diamond Casino Glendale Az Online Casino List Lucky Coins Casino Mirage Hotel Casino Casinos</h1>

<p>I put the $500 withdrawal in right after I fulfilled the wagering requirements and ask them if there was anything else I needed to do before I could withdraw and they said I needed to make it deposit of at least $25 and even though I was reluctant to do that I guess I was plus enough at that point already that it was worth the risk to me so I deposited $25 put in the $500 withdrawal and I still had a couple hundred left so of course I went back and started playing and one like 650 more and was still in the middle of playing and my balance went to zero at that point so I'm like what the hell and went back to chat with customer service again and that's when they told me there was $100 Max cash out on my bonus and I swear to you I can't be 100% positive because sometimes I get in a hurry and overlook stuff but I'm pretty positive there was no Max cash out on that and if there was my balance would have went to 100 as soon as I had wagered the 35 times or whatever it wouldn't wait until I put in a withdrawal for 500 and was playing for I don't know how long after that before they took the rest of my money you understand what I'm saying wouldn't it of went down to 100 because I've had similar situation where I wasn't paying attention and got a bonus that had a Max cash out of 100 and as soon as I hit the waging requirements my balance of like 1400 went straight down to 100 just like it disappeared in this case.</p>
