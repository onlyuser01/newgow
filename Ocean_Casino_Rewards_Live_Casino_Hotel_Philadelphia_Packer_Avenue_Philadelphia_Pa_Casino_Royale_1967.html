    <h1>Ocean Casino Rewards Live Casino Hotel Philadelphia Packer Avenue Philadelphia Pa Casino Royale 1967</h1>

<p>Thank you for your post.</p>
<p>We would like to reassure you that, contrary to your view about our reluctance to pay out, we are happy for our players to be successful and, once our security procedures have been satisfied, we are pleased to be able to make payments.</p>
<p>Upon reviewing your account we can see that you had requested three withdrawals of R14000 on 13/11/2023, and at the time of your request we then asked you for additional information regarding your mobile phone bill.</p>
<p>We have various flags and triggers for customer activity requiring us to request customer additional information due to the activities and deposits made to your Spin247 account using your mobile phone.</p>
<p>Because of our licence we have a responsibility to our regulators, as well as to other parts of the business community to ensure that our players are genuine, and that they are using legitimate payment methods. We take our regulatory responsibilities seriously and therefore we have in place a number of internal procedures and controls to help prevent any potential abuse of the gaming system. This includes being alert to the possibility that some players may unfortunately attempt to defraud their mobile phone or credit card providers.</p>
<p>On review of the information which was received from you and applied to your account we identified some inconsistences with the document you provided which raised concerns regarding the legitimacy of the documents, and as such the decision has been made to close your accounts and void your withdrawals.</p>
<p>The possibility of this happening is detailed in the following terms and conditions:</p>
<p>Section 5: Deposits</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You may make a deposit by credit card or debit card. Card deposits are charged from the customer card directly on deposit. In addition, we may offer you a facility to top-up your Account by applying a charge to your mobile phone bill or mobile phone pre-pay account. We reserve the right to withdraw or limit any payment facility at any time and without notice. You may not use this facility if doing so is in breach of the terms of your mobile network operator agreement. If we are advised by your mobile network operator of your non-payment or misuse of this facility, or if payment is withheld by your operator or we reasonably suspect your non-payment or misuse of this facility, we may ask you to provide evidence of payment to your network operator and, if you have not been able to provide this for a period of 12 months or more, we reserve the right to close your Account. You will lose any amounts deposited and will not be entitled to withdraw any amounts in your Account if your Account is suspended in these circumstances.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We may at any time offset any positive balance in your Cashable Credit Account against any amounts owed by you to us including, but not limited to, any fraudulent chargebacks and any bad debts related to your non-payment of your mobile phone bill.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Section 8: Withdrawals</p>
<ol>
<li>We reserve the right to void bets and refuse or withhold a withdrawal where we have any reasonable grounds for closing your Account (see Section 9 below), including where there is evidence of "suspicious activity" (see Section 12 below). In particular, if we suspect fraud or fraudulent activity on your part, or any of your deposits are charged back to us as a result of (alleged) fraudulent use, or loss, of your credit or debit card, we reserve the right to refuse or withhold a withdrawal from your Account and, if necessary, to lawfully collect any payments owed by you. It is your responsibility to provide correct bank details for winning payments. We will make reasonable efforts to contact you to obtain correct bank details.</li>
</ol>
<p>Section 9: Closing and Suspending Accounts</p>
<p>Our Rights to Close and Suspend Your Account</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We reserve the right to close or suspend an Account in any of the following circumstances:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where we have requested additional information relating to identification or proof of payment of a phone bill and the Player has failed to provide such information</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where we are legally obliged to do so; and/or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where we reasonably suspect "suspicious activity" (see Section 12 below).</p>
</li>
</ol>
