<p>888 Launches New High Roller Tournament, The Dragon</p>
<p>888poker has added to its multi-table tournament schedule with the new Dragon high-roller event. The first Dragon will be launched this Sunday, November 3, and it will run every month. It is an exciting new addition to 888’s already exciting tournament schedule.</p>
<p>The buy-in for The Dragon will be $1,050, and there is a $200,000 guaranteed prize pool. Players will start out with 50,000 chips and the blinds will increase every 12 minutes. Rebuys will also be available while late registration is taking place.</p>
<p>If $1,050 is a bit too expensive for your budget, there are satellites available. Throughout the month, players will be able to take part in satellite tournaments that cost as little as 50c.</p>
<p>In that event, you can win entry into a $16.50 sub-satellite which can provide you with access into a $109 buy-in event. There, five seats will be guaranteed for The Dragon. On top of all this, there will be two special satellites that offer additional entries into the event:</p>
<p>15:31 GMT: a $109 buy-in event with 20 seats guaranteed</p>
<p>16:41 GMT: a $215 buy-in event with 10 seats guaranteed</p>
<p>888poker has made is very easy to make your way around the lobby, if you’re interested in playing in The Dragon. Simply visit the tournament lobby and click on The Dragon tab, where you’ll find the full satellite schedule.</p>
<p>One of Many Exciting Sunday Tournaments</p>
<p>At 888poker, Sundays are full of exciting tournaments with huge prizes up for grabs. These are just a few of the events that you’ll be able to take part in, along with The Dragon:</p>
<p>The Whale: $530 buy-in with a $150,000 guaranteed prize pool</p>
<p>The Sunday Challenge: $109 buy-in with a $20,000 guaranteed prize pool</p>
