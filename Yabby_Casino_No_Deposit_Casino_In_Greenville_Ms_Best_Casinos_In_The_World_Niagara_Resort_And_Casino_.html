    <h1>Yabby Casino No Deposit Casino In Greenville Ms Best Casinos In The World Niagara Resort And Casino</h1>

<p>I've been trying for hours to get someone to help me. I deposited â‚¬25 with my Mastercard. After a very short time I just made â‚¬1100 out of it. I really would have loved to have paid them out. After all, that's a lot of money and there are actually people who can really use a profit like this.</p>
<p>Shit is only when you then happily click on payout and all that is displayed are 40 different handicapped virtual coins. It might all be money in some form, but not everyone uses or owns or whatever some crypto shit.</p>
<p>If you deposit with Mastercard and it says "use the same payment method as you used for the deposit" everywhere, it's actually very confusing, don't you think.?? After a moment of desperation and about 2 hours after a "please wait" from the shittiest customer service ever, I thought to myself, maybe it can be converted somehow, so I'll somehow have it paid out in bitcoin and then make â‚¬ out of it again. Extremely stressful and complicated and it's probably more of a method for the candidates who come here to wash.</p>
<p>But also here is the next construction site, which is understandable from the aspect just mentioned: You can really only take out exactly that if you have also paid in with it. Jo what do you do there now with a bank card and a long row of any coins.????</p>
<p>So now I'm wondering which idiot came up with the idea that you can deposit with Visa/Mastercard/Ewallet but there's nothing about it in the crappy payout?!</p>
<p>In the meantime, my 1100 â‚¬ profit is about 7 hours ago, of the money there are now 470 â‚¬ left is still a decent amount and the only thing - I've tried to communicate with you half the day - from the responsible side : I heard from Casino-Z Support and its amazing staff.</p>
<p>"Please wait."</p>
<p>The last guy who voted me in support, told me to "hold up a moment" 1!!!! fucking hour ago.</p>
<p>Tell me are you still fine????</p>
<p>I deposited MY money there, it's been lying on MY game account for hours, because some chump thinks it's cool to cheat the customer a bit and write his customer service at the top of his homework book, always ignore the screen and only answer every 2 hours, NOT THE HERE ANOTHER REVISED. I have no choice but to annoy you so that yallah is done here.</p>
<p>Without exception, everyone from support is absolutely too incompetent to verify my shitty account with ID and co and to suggest a goddamn solution for a payout other than "waiting". What am I waiting for boy?! That a carrier pigeon brings me my money?! It can't be that damn hard. Every other casino manages to verify and pay out within an hour. So you're really a very special club, we can all clap a round.</p>
<p>I'm reading reviews on here that say I've been waiting for weeks. !!!</p>
<p>You can't be serious, can you? Are you kidding us all? There can still be a lot of license stamps on the website, but that's maximum shit, at its best.</p>
<p>Honestly Top Casino but that is absolutely not possible. I also expect that you will manage to solve my problem within the next day.</p>
<p>Whatever bullshit you guys pull off, I'm absolutely not in the mood to be chasing you for two weeks now to do your job. I'm just angry right now. Don't ever get phone support, you'll only get shouted at the way you work. Just absolute crap.</p>
<p>So little aggression let out after my fantastic day. Now can you please get that one guy who actually does something for you to solve this ridiculous problem</p>
<p>thx for your support ðŸ˜‰</p>
