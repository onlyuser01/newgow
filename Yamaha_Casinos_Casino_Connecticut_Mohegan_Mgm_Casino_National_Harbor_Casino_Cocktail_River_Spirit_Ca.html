    <h1>Yamaha Casinos Casino Connecticut Mohegan Mgm Casino National Harbor Casino Cocktail River Spirit Ca</h1>

<p>What do you think of a casino whose customer service is as competent as a piece of toast?!</p>
<p>I don't see any provider on the website below, no license either, here at Casino Guru a provider is listed that I have never heard of. In the casino at the support I asked several times who the provider of this casino is, apparently they don't know themselves who they work for, the lady from the support says to me, the provider is on the website although I wrote several times that there is no provider and also no license, then she refers me to the e-mail address of the casino I should ask by e-mail.</p>
<p>This casino is identical to Rabidi NV casinos in terms of presentation, support expertise, constant server errors and Book of Dead reel spins and I am very sure that this casino is operated by Rabidi NV.</p>
<p>That would not be a problem in and of itself, but I am blocked by the provider because the constant problems in one of the casinos from the provider were getting on my nerves and the support at the time did not understand that I just wanted a normal account block and I didn't feel like discussing it any further and got banned because of gambling addiction because casinos always react directly to something like that, which was the case. So I am not allowed to play in any Rabidi NV casino.</p>
<p>If I continue to deposit money in this casino and if I should be lucky and win, if my assumptions are correct, I will only have problems with the payout and will never get my winnings paid out anyway. Is it too much to ask to have a provider and license visible at the bottom of the casino's website?</p>
<p>I am guessing that the provider listed here at Casino Guru is not that of the casino. At least for the players in Germany.</p>
