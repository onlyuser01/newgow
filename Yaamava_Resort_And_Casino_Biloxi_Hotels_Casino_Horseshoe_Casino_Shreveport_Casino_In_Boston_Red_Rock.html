<p>Regarding deposit bonuses, it is always necessary to read the terms and conditions of the given bonus in detail. There are several options for winnings:</p>
<p>the type of bonus is that you get a deposit bonus, but first you play with your own money. If you win while you still have your own money in your account, you can request a withdrawal, withdraw all your winnings and have the remaining bonus money in your account withdrawn (sometimes it's automatic, some are done by customer support). However, if you lose your own money, play with a bonus and subsequently win, the amount of possible withdrawal is usually limited to a certain amount, or X times the deposit. the type of bonus is that you deposit money and right from the start you are subject to a limit that says the maximum amount you can withdraw</p>
<p>Also, be aware that sometimes you may only have a small bonus balance in your account and make a deposit without the bonus. Although you will be playing with your own money, many casinos may claim that since you still have bonus money left in your account, you are subject to the max win rule. This happens surprisingly quite often, so it is always necessary to cancel the bonus, or in some casinos to make a withdrawal, for example a smaller limited win, this often cancels the bonus on the account and then make a deposit at the moment when the withdrawal is confirmed and there are no bonus funds left on the account means.</p>
