<p>Pirate Kingdom Megaways review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Pirates are a popular outlaw figurehead, and one that gets plenty of play in slot machines. The idea of hidden treasure and high-seas adventure is a heady one, that attracts many players to games like Pirate Kingdom Megaways.</p>
<p>With an ocean setting and suitably piratical probs as symbols on the reels, this is the slot all wannabe swashbucklers will be looking to play.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>With its flotsam and jetsam of barrels in the background and a sail ship bearing down, Pirate Kingdom Megaways does an excellent job of giving players a peek at their pirate fantasy.</p>
<p>The reels include treasure chests and hardy seamen as symbols and the soundtrack is a mix of moody strings, waves, and cannon fire.</p>
<p>The animations tie this all together, making for a nice audio-visual experience that is original but familiar in equal parts.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Pirate Kingdom Megaways uses a Megaways system for the base game.</p>
<p>The Megaways system used here is borrowed on license from Big Time Gaming. It uses an any way wins system to determine payouts. This means winning symbol combos must be on adjacent reels going to the right and starting from reel one.</p>
<p>During each spin, the size of the reels is randomised. Each reel gets between two and seven symbols. This results in the number of win ways falling between 64 and a maximum of 117,649.</p>
<p>There is also a fun bonus that can be bought into by impatient players, but no gamble feature. Overall the gameplay is solid, if not especially new or innovative.</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols. Wilds can come with a x2 multiplier up to a maximum of three times in one spin. The multipliers stack, so three x2 multipliers mean that the winning.</p>
<p>The Bonus is triggered when four or more cascades are triggered in one spin. The player gets 8 free spins, with an additional 2 for each additional cascade after the fourth. During the Free Spins, four cascades in one spin add an additional two spins to the total.</p>
<p>There is a maximum of 22 free spins each time the Bonus is triggered.</p>
<p>During the first free spin, a multiplier of x1 is applied. At the end of each spin, the multiplier increases by one. The multiplier applies only to subsequent wins.</p>
<p>During free spins, whenever a reel lands with seven symbols on it, then that reel is locked as a seven symbol reel. The reel still spins but it will have seven symbols on it for the remainder of the Bonus.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.20%, a little over our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.20 up to a maximum of $/£/€40.00 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is high, which makes it a great match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Buying directly into the free spins results in higher volatility but, depending on your jurisdiction, it also reduces the RTP to between 95.72% and 96.12%.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Pirate Kingdom Megaways is a rollicking seaborne adventure with pirates, sunken treasure, and musket shot.</p>
<p>The theme is fun, the visuals and music are engaging, and the gameplay is everything you’d expect from a slot with the Megaways branding in its name.</p>
<p>The strongest plus for this slot though is the above average RTP (96.20%) and the high volatility. This combination makes it a great slot to use with our slot strategies.</p>
