<p>Gaming operator bet365 has signed an agreement with SIS (Sports Information Services) to allow the gambling company to stream 49’s Original Live Draw on its platform worldwide.</p>
<p>The Streaming Agreement Will Be a Boon to Both SIS and bet365</p>
<p>49’s is the flagship product of UK-based betting service supplier SIS. It is a fixed-odds live numbers draw where players have the potential to win a large sum with a small stake in a pick 6 from 49 format. The product has been active for over 25 years and has retained its popularity. Frequent draws feature a team of popular presenters who can engage with betters directly via 49’s website or through the brand’s social media channels. Over 1 million unique players visit the game’s official website, which receives frequent updates with various statistics, draw odds, and information on presenters.</p>
<p>Both entities have expressed hopes that the deal will be mutually beneficial. A bet365 spokesperson cited the agreement as an “important move” that was part of the company’s commitment to providing industry-leading services. The operator praised 49’s live draws as a time-tested product that successfully engages a significant number of players and would help “deliver incremental revenues” and further grow the bet365 brand.</p>
<p>SIS Head of Product Proposition, Jessica Mills, called the deal a “natural progression in our journey to diversify and grow the product and brand.” This agreement marks the first time 49’s live draws will be officially available as live streams. Mills was optimistic that the high-quality production of the live draws and the opportunity to win large sums with a small bet would appeal to bet365’s worldwide audience.</p>
<p>This deal is the second time SIS has partnered with bet365 this year. In March, the two companies made a five-year deal for SIS’s full complement of greyhound races. The two deals with bet365 are part of an ongoing effort by the UK-based betting service supplier to expand globally. SIS products are now available on five continents through an ever-growing number of partners.</p>
<p>These include bet365, Betway, BetVictor, Betfair, Admiral, Meridianbet, William Hill, Unibet, SkyBet, Paddy Power, and PointsBet. To aid its expansion plans, SIS recently made two key appointments for Head of Competitive Gaming and Head of Racing Trading. The company has put high hopes in its trading and competitive gaming products, which are gaining popularity.</p>
<p>Among SIS’s newer offerings are live broadcasts of H2H esports events such as e-soccer, CS:GO, and e-basketball, which contribute to the betting supplier’s goal to provide its partners with short-form betting events every 3 minutes.</p>
