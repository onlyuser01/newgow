    <h1>Wind Creek Casino Wetumpka Casinos In Tennessee Ballys Casino Atlantic City Osage Casino Tulsa Casin</h1>

<p>Hello, the casino is a scam. I registered there around 1-2 months ago and I didnt use any bonuses. I checked on your site that Polish players are allowed and during registration there was a possibility to choose Poland from the list so I thought it was fine to play there. But they stole almost all the money from my account.</p>
<p>I deposited in total around 1000-1500 euro. After winning some I wanted to withdraw 1000 euro and then strange things started. After a few days of no reply to the withdrawal, I asked on the chat if they want me to send any documents or anything. They said to give them my phone number and they will phone call me. They didnt want any documents, I told them several times that I can send them documents for verification but they didnt want it. Every time they just said that they had internal procedures and I needed to wait and it will be over soon.</p>
<p>I got info that other polish players are having issues too. After 2 weeks my nationality was changed from Poland to Australia on their website. And then they confiscated all my money and left only the last deposit which was around 250 eur. From 3200 euro they gave me 250 euro back, which they allowed me to withdraw without any verification.</p>
<p>I talked to other polish players, one of them has been playing there for almost a year with no issues, they have been withdrawing his money before with no issues, he went through verification, confirmed his address and everything. But suddenly, they scammed all polish players for no reason.</p>
<p>As I said before, I havent used any bonuses and they didnt want me to verify my account, they just simply scammed me. Can you help the players somehow?</p>
<p>I want to let you know that the owner of Uberlucky is also the owner of Betzerk casino. Can you please link them together, so the rating score will have impact on both casinos? Because I heard that they are closing Uberlucky casino soon and will leave Betzerk open.</p>
<p>Do something about this case, they cannot scam people like that.</p>
