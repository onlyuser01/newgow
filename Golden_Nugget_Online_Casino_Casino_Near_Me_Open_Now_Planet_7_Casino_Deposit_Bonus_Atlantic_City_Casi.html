    <h1>Golden Nugget Online Casino Casino Near Me Open Now Planet 7 Casino Deposit Bonus Atlantic City Casi</h1>

<p>I deposited â‚¬10 at the casino and got the promised 100% bonus. I managed to increase the balance to â‚¬50 and at some point I went to check how much recycling balance was left and it showed â‚¬281.</p>
<p>I played more and when I checked the recycling balance, it hadn't decreased at all. I asked Spinnalot's Chat support about it and they answered that recycling the winnings obtained with deposit bonus money does not reduce the required Wagering balance, but only playing with deposit money and the balance won with it reduces the wagering balance.</p>
<p>Quite a special rule at this Casino ðŸ˜‰ .. in a way, the deposit bonus has no value, the winnings have to be made with deposit money. I think the bonus terms that apply to recycling are a scam.</p>
