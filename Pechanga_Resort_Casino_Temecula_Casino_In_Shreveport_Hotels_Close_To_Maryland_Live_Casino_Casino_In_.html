    <h1>Pechanga Resort Casino Temecula Casino In Shreveport Hotels Close To Maryland Live Casino Casino In</h1>

<p>Dear Dale,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your withdrawal problem. Have you been provided with any list of required documents for the account verification? I have checked general terms and conditions, and this is what I found https://www.alwaysvegas.eu/en/terms:</p>
<p>"Possible criminal or suspicious actions may be reported to the appropriate authority. When called upon to do so Players may need to produce certain verification documents when transacting with the casino in withdrawals or deposits. Proof of such could be clear photo identification, proof of address, credit card copies and purchase declaration forms. This requirement is to validate the security of our players and in compliance with Gaming regulations."</p>
<p>Please understand that KYC is a very important and essential process, during which the casino makes sure that the money is sent to the rightful owner. None of the serious and licensed casinos takes KYC lightly. I would suggest contacting the casino and find out what documents exactly are required and provide them in best possible quality, in correct format and as soon as possible. If all the data is correct, there should be no reason for the casino to delay your withdrawal. Additionally, if there’s any relevant communication, please forward it to petronela.k@casino.guru. I hope we will be able to help you to resolve this issue as soon as possible. Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
