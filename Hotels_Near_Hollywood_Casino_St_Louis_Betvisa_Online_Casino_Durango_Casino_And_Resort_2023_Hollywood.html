<p>Wager Score and Cincinnati Bengals have teamed up to promote safe and responsible gambling in the newly launched regulated sports gambling market in Ohio. Both establishments are committed to making sports betting for local sports fans fun and risk-free by raising awareness for the activity and advising on best practices.</p>
<p>Wager Score has launched a dedicated "Donâ€™t Fumble Your Finances" campaign which is designed to educate people about sports betting and help consumers recognize and endorse responsible gambling practices. Wager Score uses an advanced platform that can quickly alert users to excessive spending when participating in online sports betting, the company said in an email press release.</p>
<p>The platform is capable of driving educational insights that help improve the overall understanding of sports gambling. Wager Score thus instructs users how to spend their money carefully and bet responsibly. Commenting on the latest partnership opportunity, Wager Score Founder Bo Grey said that his company relied on state-of-the-art technology to implement robust harm reduction measures.</p>
<p>Wager Score, therefore, provides bettors with a free preemptive tool that addresses problematic gambling behaviors before they even manifest themselves. "To see it come to life with the Bengals' support to protect the next generation is truly amazing," Grey said, expressing high hopes for the newly launched gambling market in Ontario.</p>
<p>He further added that his company will help Gen Z to take responsible gambling into their own hands and make smart decisions about their betting activity across the board and set new industry standards. Wager Score and Betfred are also donating $100,000 to the Charles Oakley Foundation as soon as 1,000 bettors register with Wager Score and place a bet with Betfred.</p>
<p>Commenting on this development, Betfred COO Bryan Bennett hailed the product offered by Wager Score and said that it was a powerful tool to help improve responsible gambling in the emerging market.</p>
<p>Bennett recognized the partnership with Wager Score as a "slam dunk" for his company. Meanwhile, Cincinnati BengalsVP and CMOBrian Sells were similarly pleased with the opportunity. He said that the Bengals will work closely with Wager Score to help promote important safeguards in the burgeoning sports gambling industry in the state and ensure that the team helps protect the financial health of the local community.</p>
<p>"This partnership will empower sports fans with resources that can help protect their financial health and mitigate risks of problem play," Sells concluded.</p>
