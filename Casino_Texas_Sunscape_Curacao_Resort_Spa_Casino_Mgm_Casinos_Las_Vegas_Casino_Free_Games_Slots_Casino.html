    <h1>Casino Texas Sunscape Curacao Resort Spa Casino Mgm Casinos Las Vegas Casino Free Games Slots Casino</h1>

<p>Yes I had open an account with silver edge then I had lost my phone and had to open another account because I couldn't access any of my information due to everything being linked to my Gmail in which I could not access!! &amp; So I opened a new account and I played on two bonuses which I went through the playthrough bonus on and had a remaining balance of $999.00 in which I requested a wire transfer on... I then contacted the casino via live chat they told me to close the other account that I had to contact them through support on their email and so I did that and I went to the support link as advised by the live chat and I sent them three separate emails requesting the closure of the other account... That was on October 1st and then I went back be alive chat and ask them about a deposit and if everything was okay now and good to go they told me to go ahead and make the deposit and then to come back and ask them for a bonus and so moments later as advised by live chat I went and made my deposit and I won immediately which gave me a balance of over $5,000... I then went to request a withdrawal and then I receive a phone call today and text messages from multiple telephone numbers telling me that I am not eligible for withdrawal first they said that it was because of the multiple accounts and they ruled that out now they're saying it's because I mix wagered and it's just one thing after another when I did nothing but exactly what they told me to from the beginning and tried to follow all the rules (and then make it even crazier one of the men that we could just start over together..me and him and wanting to give me a fresh clean balance with a great new deposit he said) I do not know what else to do it's one thing after another I did everything that I was told and informed to do I went above and beyond trying to contact them this is a very misleading and disheartening situation to have been so excited to win and then to be told you can't have anything!1 Please help with this matter and thank you for your time...ï»¿</p>
