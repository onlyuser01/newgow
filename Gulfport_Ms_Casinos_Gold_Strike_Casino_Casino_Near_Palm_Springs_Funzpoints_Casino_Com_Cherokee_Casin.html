<p>Bet365 has launched Non-Runner No Bet markets for all Cheltenham Festival races, allowing users to wager with confidence</p>
<p>Gambling giant bet365 has announced that its Non-Runner No Bet (NRNB) markets for this year’s Cheltenham Festival are now live. Extra markets were launched today, January 30, allowing punters to place safe bets on every single race of the racing event.</p>
<p>Bet365 Provides Players with Much-Needed Safeguards</p>
<p>The launch follows the success of earlier NRNM and Best Odds Guaranteed offerings. Such markets have been available on the Champion Hurdle, the Queen Mother Champion Chase, the Ryanair Chase, the Stayers’ Hurdle and Cheltenham Gold Cup since the beginning of the month. In the wake of high player interest, bet365 decided to extend the offering to cover all 28 races.</p>
<p>The Non-Runner No Bet is a fairly simple concept where players’ bets are voided if the horse they have wagered on does not show up for any reason. This provides customers with an important safeguard, allowing them to bet with confidence. In addition, NRNB markets often have attractive prices.</p>
<p>In addition to the NRNB offering on every race, bet365 announced that it will also be offering multiple boosts on selected horses ahead of each event.</p>
<p>Cooney Provided Extra Insights</p>
<p>Patrick Cooney, bet365’s horse racing guru, commented on the launch of the new betting markets. With the Dublin Festival at Leopardstown just around the corner, Cooney believes that there could not have been a more perfect time to launch NRNB markets on all 28 Cheltenham Festival races.</p>
<p>Of course, all 28 standard Ante Post books will remain open until the Festival many prefer the all in run or not angle of Ante Post betting, so we will also keep that option available too. Patrick Cooney, horse racing guru, bet365</p>
<p>Cooney added that people tend to have a favorite horse. However, they are rarely certain which race to back it in. This is where NRNB is a very useful concept, as it allows bettors to wager without worrying that their pick might not show up for a particular event. In addition, Cooney advised punters to have multiple entries, thus boosting their chances to land a winning bet.</p>
<p>As a final piece of advice, bet365’s horse racing guru said:</p>
<p>Gaelic Warrior is perhaps the horse with the most options, we have an NRNB price for him in six different races, and are currently laying him in all six! Patrick Cooney, horse racing guru, bet365</p>
<p>In other news, two weeks ago, bet365 was named the official betting partner of the boxing match between Chris Eubank Jr and Liam Smith, which took place on January 21. During that game, the operator’s brand was prominently promoted.</p>
