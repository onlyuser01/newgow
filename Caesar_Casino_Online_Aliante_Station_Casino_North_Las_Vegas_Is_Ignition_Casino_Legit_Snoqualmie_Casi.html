<p>Fishing for More Riches</p>
<p>The new game caters to the needs of Bog Bass Bonanza aficionados who are already familiar with the fishing-themed game as well as newcomers who would like to conquer the waters in search of riches while wearing the shoes of a skilled, jolly-bearded fisherman. The action on the reels is fast-paced and both Pragmatic Play and its partner studio Reel Kingdom managed to create yet another masterpiece of its kind.</p>
<p>Displaying large, bright, and colorful rods, flies, floats or table box symbols, the new slot preserves the mesmerizing aquatic theme and overall feeling of coolness and amiability. The background music is on point and perfectly complements the visual elements.</p>
<p>Free Spins Round and Golden Wilds</p>
<p>To enter the Free Spins Round, players must match a minimum of three scatters. Hitting three, four, or five scatter symbols, they reward 10, 15, or 20 free spins. When two scatter symbols land anywhere during the base game, there is a possibility that the third scatter is tied to the screen with a hook, ready to activate free spins. Coming across the Golden Wild symbols can bring players even juicier catches during the bonus round. Here, players are able to climb one level after the other and unlock the massive multipliers along with a max win capped at 10,000x.</p>
<p>When fish symbols land during the free spins round, they display a cash money value. When fish symbols and regular wild or golden wild symbols land simultaneously, their values are scooped up together and awarded to the player. When only fish symbols land without wilds in sight, their values get added to a prize net seen on top of the grid. On each upcoming spin, random fish are seen escaping the pot, gradually subtracting from the respective value.</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play’s chief operating officer Irina Cornides called the new release “yet another thrilling bonanza of big bites.” Irina also praised the big win potential of the game and its sense of fun that is now an undeniable part of the series that includes Big Bass Bonanza Megaways, Big Bass Splash, Christmas Big Bass Bonanza, and Bigger Bass Bonanza, together with the excellent multipliers and additional features.</p>
<p>The company is continuing its expansion worldwide. In October, Pragmatic Play also signed a deal with operator Atlantis Games in Peru. before that, at the end of September, Pragmatic Play expanded its European Union reach by opening a studio in Bulgaria.</p>
