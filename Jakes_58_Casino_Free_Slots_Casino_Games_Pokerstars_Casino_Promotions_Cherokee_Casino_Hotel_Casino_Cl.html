    <h1>Jakes 58 Casino Free Slots Casino Games Pokerstars Casino Promotions Cherokee Casino Hotel Casino Cl</h1>

<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>I've been spending the last few days constantly writing to support and I sometimes get answers that make me more dissatisfied!</p>
<p>I made a deposit of ‚Ç¨50 WITH NO bonus on Friday and I had some great hits on the last few euros. Up until then everything seemed to be going well and the casino made a great impression on me. In the end it was ‚Ç¨1300 of which I requested ‚Ç¨500 to be paid out. As of 02/25/2023 the payout of ‚Ç¨500 is pending and hardly ever touched or processed!</p>
<p>I confirmed my data and verified everything during the payout and received a successful confirmation of the verification by email! On Wednesday there was another KYC verification to confirm my account data, which was then confirmed directly on Wednesday evening. Supposedly everything should be processed after 48 hours, but the amount of 500 ‚Ç¨ is still outstanding.</p>
<p>A similar email came yesterday that everything was verified and the payout should be processed within 48 hours. In my opinion, this is all just delaying tactics, nothing will happen and I am so annoyed that I even put any money in this casino. Since I've been waiting for the ‚Ç¨500, I've deposited ‚Ç¨300 again. Does anyone have similar or the same problems and can tell me what else I can do?</p>
<p>I don't want to admit that a casino in DE is approved that can actually deduct such a scam! I would like to believe that you will pay it off, but it all seems as if they have no intention of doing so and unfortunately I can't say anything positive about it üôÅ</p>
