<p>Cai Hong Slot Review</p>
<p>Cai Hong is a 2018 RTG release with an interesting Oriental theme at the center. The 5 x 3 game relies on the idea that rainbows bring good luck and fortune to those who come across them. The slot rewards players with as many as 33 free games with x15 multipliers during the Scattered Rainbows feature, along with wild symbols that can double the payouts and a maximum win of 5,000 the bet.</p>
<p>Theme, Storyline, and Graphics: Experience the Rainbow’s Good Fortune</p>
<p>Translated to “rainbow”, Cai Hong is, as mentioned earlier, the main element of this Chinese-themed slot by the reputable studio known for its quality releases over the years. The game which is fully optimized for Android and iOS mobile devices also focuses on the smiling God of Wealth who is ready to bestow all the riches upon new players.</p>
<p>As the main storyline, players are carried over the mesmerizing rainbow and introduced to some cool rewards there. The rainbow does not only represent the backdrop behind the grid but it has also been designed as the main scatter in the game, leading take punters to the main bonus round. The graphics elements consist of standard symbols inspired by the beautiful Asian culture, with plenty of realistic detailing work added to them to create an excellent appearance on the grid. The reels are packed with dogs, tigers, roosters, oxen, and rabbits, representative of the Chinese years, next to the Caishen god.</p>
<p>The overall design is that of a good-looking game, better than the average in the industry, with some room for improvement with emphasis on the design of the playing card symbols. The game’s symbols are set against a sky full of clouds on transparent reels that appear to be magically floating down across the soothing backdrop. The grid is surrounded by an authentic oriental red lattice frame which is appealing to the eye.</p>
<p>Cai Hong: Game Symbols and Payouts</p>
<p>The reels count 30 fixed pay lines. This means all of the lines are simultaneously active. When a minimum of three identical symbols run in an unbroken sequence across a line starting with the utmost left, players score a win.</p>
<p>The low-paying symbols are represented by the standard playing card symbols (As, Ks, Qs, Jx, 10s, and 9s). The top wins are scored when the animals populating the reels are seen landing across a line together with gold coins. For example, five tiger symbols pay 750 while the same five tiger symbols together with the gold coins symbol pay 1,500. The golden ingot is the highest-paying symbol during the base game.</p>
<p>The wild is represented by the God of Wealth. It works by replacing all of the other symbols while doubling the value of all win-lines generated by it. While the wild does not come with a specific value, it helps players complete extra combinations, especially since it is a stacked wild symbol. This means it has the potential of filling any random reel he is seen landing on.</p>
<p>Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>Adding even more to the specific Asian mood, the tinkling soundtrack nicely complements the rather mechanical sound effect sounds heard as the reels are spinning. The animations are very basic, with symbols seen coming to life once a win is scored on the grid.</p>
<p>Cai Hong Gameplay</p>
<p>The gameplay is smooth and rather unassuming, with a standard betting system as part of most of RTG’s online video slots. Cai Hong gives players the opportunity to select their desired line bets ranging from $0.01 to $5 on all 30 fixed lines. In other words, the resulting bets can range between $0.30 to $150. No matter if players start off with a smaller budget or they can afford to wager more, the game should be equally engaging for all players.</p>
<p>As a rule of thumb, the higher the bet, the higher the potential wins scored by players, with individual wins paying $50,000 during standard spins. However, during the free spins feature, the 15x multipliers will make a great difference. The game can pay up to 50,000x the line bet for just one spin. This is the equivalent of $250,000 as the higher jackpot limit.</p>
<p>The available symbols pay left to right, with the exception of the scattered rainbow symbols that pay any direction. Wins scored on different lines will be added together. Any wins generated by the scatter rainbows will be multiplied by the total bet, then added to the line wins. The latter will be multiplied by the chosen bet per line and only the highest win per paid line will be paid to players.</p>
<p>Players can use the simple commands, tabs, and buttons to pick their bets spin the reels, choose the highest bet possible, automatically spin the reels, consult the game help menu to familiarize themselves with the exact paytable, toggle between regular and double speed, or consult the game history, disable and enable space to spin, along with the splash screen and the intro video.</p>
<p>Cai Hong: Free Games Feature with Bonus Picks &amp; Bonsu Picks</p>
<p>The game introduces players to two relatively standard features, which might sound like an insufficient number for some players. Nonetheless, together with the generous multipliers, the game is very likely to become the favorite of many fans of the genre.</p>
<p>Free Games Feature with Bonus Picks</p>
<p>When a minimum of three scatter symbols are seen showing up anywhere during the base game, players automatically trigger eight free games with an x2 multiplier. To retrigger the feature, players must keep an eye on at least three more scatters appearing anywhere during the free games round. All new retrigger episodes will add 15 free games to the current feature while maintaining the current multipliers unaltered. The free games will be played at the chosen lines and bet corresponding to the triggering game.</p>
<p>Bonus Picks</p>
<p>Prior to the free games feature, two, three, or four bonus picks will be handed in exchange for three, four, or five triggering scatter symbols. The bonus picks feature will then ask players to take their pick from five charms with three coins each. Once a player has chosen a charm, they will soon learn the prize they have won, ranging from a pair of multipliers (x5, x8) and three bundles of seven, 10, and 15 free games. The charm prizes will further boost the free games or multiplier.</p>
<p>Final Thoughts</p>
<p>With a comfortable level of variance, a popular rainbow/Cashen God theme in place, excellent features, and generous multipliers, Cai Hong by RTG is worth a spin or two. Fans of penny games can start their wagers at $0.01 per line and cross their fingers for a massive win.</p>
