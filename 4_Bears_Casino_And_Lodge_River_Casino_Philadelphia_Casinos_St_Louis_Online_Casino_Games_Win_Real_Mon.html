    <h1>4 Bears Casino And Lodge River Casino Philadelphia Casinos St Louis Online Casino Games Win Real Mon</h1>

<p>Dear Richard,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem, but please understand that most casino don’t accept deposits from 3rd parties. The casino clearly states this fact on the banking page (https://jackwin.co.uk/en/page/termsandconditions):</p>
<p>"4.2. The name on the card or the bank account or any other payment method used to deposit to your Account should be identical to that of the Account holder. If we identify that funds have been deposited to your Account from a third party, we reserve the right to immediately return the deposit back to the source and void any winnings that have arisen from such a deposit. Any charges levied by the banks and/or payment gateways may be deducted from the reversed amount. If we have reason to believe that the transaction may not have been authorised by the owner of the applicable card/bank account/other payment method (for example, if we believe the payment card is stolen) then we may immediately suspend your Account, and may refer the incident to the relevant authorities."</p>
<p>Do I understand correctly that by the joint account you mean that your name is stated as the official account owner together with your partner? Or is the only account owner your partner and you have the permission to use it?</p>
<p>Would you be so kind and forward any relevant communication between you and the casino to kristina.s@casino.guru? Alternatively, you can post it here.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Kristina</p>
