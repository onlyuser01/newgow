<p>The latest addition to the fantasy lineup features a DraftKings-run contest covering the eNASCAR Bristol Motor Speedway this Sunday.</p>
<p>DraftKings Adds eNASCAR Fantasy Contest</p>
<p>After successfully introducing a Counter-Strike fantasy game, DraftKings is now adding an entirely new product for the eNASCAR series. With Nevada giving an official go-ahead to both competitions as official events to place wagers on, the interest in the segment is quickly rising even among mainstream sports and racing fans.</p>
<p>This Sunday, April 5, the eNASCAR series will be returning at the Bristol Motor Speedway, and players will have an opportunity to place their bets through DraftKings on a new daily fantasy sports (DFS) contest.</p>
<p>Ready, set, go ahead and take your shot at over $300K in prizes.</p>

<p>In terms of interest, the event seems well-poised. Last week’s race saw 1.3 million people tuning in to watch on FS1 and FOX. For the Bristol race, the same broadcast venues apply, but you can supplement your options by downloading the Fox Sports App as well.</p>
<p>DraftKings eNASCAR Contest: Rules</p>
<p>The rules of the new contest are very simple. Players will be asked to build a six-member racing team with the cap set up to $50,000. To calculate points, DraftKings will use a very simple system whereby:</p>
<p>1 st place gets 46 points</p>
<p>place gets 46 points 40th place gets 4 points</p>
<p>There are some additional rules as well, such as a place differential condition listed at +/- 1-point, fastest laps listed at +0.5 points and laps led listed at +0.25 points. The place differential bet is based on how many positions a racer gains based on his original starting position.</p>
<p>So, if a racer on your roster starts in the 20th slot but finishes 5th, you will get one point for each difference in positions. Conversely, if your racer has done worse than their starter’s position, you will lose points based on the difference.</p>
<p>How to Choose Which Drivers to Buy?</p>
<p>With the eNASCAR series being purely show events and not having much to do with drivers’ actual skill behind the wheel (although this statement takes some criticizim), picking a correct bet is a challenge.</p>
<p>Yet, the process itself is simple enough. Just register a DraftKings account and enter the fantasy contest by choosing from one of the confirmed drivers for the Bristol Motor Speedway tomorrow.</p>
<p>The eNASCAR iRacing Series at Bristol</p>
<p>Presently, DraftKings has listed 24 racers to help you build your own racing lineup. The cheapest you can purchase is Jimmie Johnson ($5,000) and Timmy Hill ($10,700) is the most expensive, owing to his recent victory.</p>
<p>Each racer will have to go through 50-lap heats to determine their starting positions before joining the main 150-race on Sunday. All selections will be locked at 1 PM ET, so make sure you have adjusted your bets by then.</p>
<p>While DraftKings may choose to extend the contest in future, the current event only applies to the Bristol Motor Speedway.</p>
