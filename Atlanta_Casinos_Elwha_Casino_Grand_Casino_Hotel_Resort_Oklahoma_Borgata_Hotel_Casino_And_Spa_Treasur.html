<p>YOU NOT GOING TO BELIEVE THIS</p>
<p>Gareth Thomas, Casino Support</p>
<p></p>
<p>hi still did not receive my wire. its 3pm here end of day. today is the 7th working day</p>
<p>Hello Jay</p>
<p>send the details acct number routing number and bic and i will tell you if it is correct</p>
<p>i never have issues like this</p>
<p>Send us bank statement from 28.9 till today and we will check</p>
<p>i already sent my bank statement. you have it will all my other documents</p>
<p>Jay send us the requested bank statement so we can check what is going on with your withdrawal</p>
<p>i sent it once .. you have it. no other casino asks for bank statements why do you</p>
<p>I sent it.. you have it</p>
<p>Because you have claimed you have not received your withdrawal and in order for us to check since it is over due date we have to check your bank statement</p>
<p>Not the one you had sent for your withdraWal</p>
<p>But one from 28.9 till today</p>
<p>i just looked at it online. not received.</p>
<p>Okay then send us bank statement from 28.9 till today to support@nevada777.com and we will check for you</p>
<p>Online statement works too</p>
<p>this months transactions won't show until next month</p>
<p>i will not show an online statement.. its none of any ones business</p>
<p>except mine</p>
<p>a bank statement will not show a deposit from a wire</p>
<p>Let me see what finance will say but most likely you will have to provide a bank statement</p>
<p>It shows all the movements towards you bank account even the wire transfers</p>
<p>i already did. this is rediculous.</p>
<p>Yes you did that on 28,9</p>
<p>We need statement from 28.9 till today</p>
<p>once it hits my bank chase it shows immediately</p>
<p>i do not give out online bank statements</p>
<p>Let me see what finance will say</p>
<p>it takes all other casinos 2 to 3 days in my account but with you guys something is wrong</p>
<p>Jay every site is different my friend</p>
<p>I cannot speak for the others</p>
<p>Sorry</p>
<p>well maybe someone on your end inputted the numbers incorrectly</p>
<p>Nothing is put incorrectly, finance had advised me it may experience some delay</p>
<p>are you sure it was a wire or did you mail a check</p>
<p>It is a wire transfer</p>
<p>why a delay?</p>
<p>Unfortunately it is not something up to us but rather up to the payment processor the only thing they told me is that there might be a delay with it</p>
<p>i never had a situation like this ever in 9 years</p>
<p>Im sorry for the inconvenience it should be with you soon</p>
<p>another casino with a payment processor issue</p>
<p>Sorry about that Jay</p>
<p>well it would have been nice of you to let me know about a delay with your payment processor 3rd party i guess.. great</p>
<p>i really need this money as well as the other that was taken from me</p>
<p>I understand you my friend and if it was up to me it would have been straight to your account</p>
<p>I will make sure we chase them so they can do what they need to do asap</p>
<p>I am really unhappy now. and very disappointed that nevada777 was hiding this from me</p>
<p>To be honest with you Jay it is the first time I hear for that delay too so basically what you know is the same thing we know</p>
<p>This information has not been delivered to us in advance, hence you would have know for it</p>
<p>time to change payment processors. I belong to many casinos.. they use 3rd part processor also.. paid immediately</p>
<p>Told finance the same thing my friend, its unacceptable for them to do that to us as well, as you can imagine if you have delayed withdrawal then somebody else would have too</p>
<p>do you have any siste sites</p>
<p>this has happened top me with one other casino but it was a lot of money</p>
<p>No other sister sites</p>
<p>ok i have choice...but I am expecting my money asap</p>
<p>Im gonna try to resolve this asap</p>
<p>Once I got any news I will make sure to update you</p>
<p>i can't believe it is happening</p>
<p>New message!</p>
<p>I believe you, my honest reaction was the same</p>
<p>THIS ISN'T RIGHT!</p>
