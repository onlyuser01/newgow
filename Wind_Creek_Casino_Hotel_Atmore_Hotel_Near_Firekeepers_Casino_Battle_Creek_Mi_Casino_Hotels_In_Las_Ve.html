    <h1>Wind Creek Casino Hotel Atmore Hotel Near Firekeepers Casino Battle Creek Mi Casino Hotels In Las Ve</h1>

<p>Buenas tardes,</p>
<p>I recently had a problem with an online casino, "Sportium".</p>
<p>They give me a bonus of €30 to play in the casino, I use it with live roulette, I raise the capital up to €1770. I call customer service to make sure of the rules and to be told the limitation in time to spend the bonus. That night I called customer service three times, because as the capital increased with the prizes I wanted to make sure that I met the casino's requirements to be able to release the bonus and get the cash, which was a maximum of €500.</p>
<p>In the second call, the support girl tells me that I have 24 hours to continue playing, that is, it was Monday 12.12.22 around 11:00 p.m. and they gave me time until Tuesday at 11:59 p.m.</p>
<p>As I keep playing and raising the winning capital, I make another call to make sure of the limit and the girl, another person, informs me that I have until Wednesday night at 11:59 p.m.</p>
<p>I take a 5-minute break, it was already around 12:15 p.m. on Tuesday.</p>
<p>When I go back to the page, to my surprise, the playable capital being €1770 had disappeared from the account, just as I say. there was €5 from another promo that did not interest me.</p>
<p>I call them the next day to see what has happened and try to get my account restored and they tell me that the conditions of the bonus put an end to its use on Tuesday at 00:00. How?</p>
<p>but if I crossed the zero hour barrier from Monday to Tuesday and continued playing, I understood then that they had fooled me and they had seen that I was capable of getting the bonus prize that consisted of multiplying €30 x 30 times with plays, In other words, playing for a value of €900, (some astronomical requirements), but I already had more or less 50% of the requirements covered and with the playable capital of €1770 it was very easy for me to get my prize.</p>
<p>Conclusion, I have been blocked in roulette. They do not give me the reason in the support. I feel cheated, they have acted like gangsters, scammers.</p>
<p>For all this, I turn to you who are experts and I would like to know if my case can be resolved satisfactorily, returning me to the point where they cut me off with the bonus and capital to be able to finish playing said bonus with the capital that I had accumulated, nothing less that from €30 to €1770. A feat!</p>
<p>Do you think you can intercede to solve it?</p>
<p>I thank you in advance for your attention.</p>
<p>Sincerely.</p>
<p>Jose R<strong><em>* A</em></strong> 'S<strong>*</strong></p>
