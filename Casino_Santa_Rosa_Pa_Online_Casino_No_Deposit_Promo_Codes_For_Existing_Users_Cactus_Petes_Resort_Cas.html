<p>Rory Mcllroy given best odds (+700) to win 2020 Masters</p>
<p>Both Jack Nicklaus and Ron Mintz back the golfer</p>
<p>A handful of underdogs, including 2019 runner-up Xander Schauffele might contest the title</p>
<p>As the golf world is on pause, analysts and sportsbooks predict that Rory Mcllroy will seal victory in the 2020 Masters scheduled for November.</p>
<p>Mcllroy Still Listed as +700 Favorite to Win 2020 Masters</p>
<p>Rory McIlroy remains in the lead for the 2020 Masters title, ahead with (+700) and followed by Jon Rahm who is a heavy second, but still a fair stretch away from Mcllroy with his (+1400). With the current golf season on hiatus, events are expected to return in the middle of November.</p>
<p>The official date is set for November 12 through November 15, with the main question now being if this out-of-season event would affect in any way the players’ chances to win the 84th edition of the Masters?</p>
<p>Odds to Win the 2020 Masters</p>
<p>Golfer Odds Rory Mcllroy +700 Jon Rahm +1400 Brooks Koepka +1600 Justin Thomas +1600 Tiger Woods +1800 Dustin Johnson +1800 Bryson DeChambeau +2800 Xander Schauffele +2800 Hideki Matsuyama +2800 Patrick Cantlay +2800</p>
<p>Does Rory Mcllroy Play Well in the Fall?</p>
<p>One of the main questions is whether the sudden shift of the season would allow for establish talents to shine once again. Based on current form – prior to the coronavirus golf cut-off – Mcllroy was doing quite well.</p>
<p>"He seems to play better in the fall. As you know, he's won the Tour Championship a couple times. Played in Atlanta, very similar conditions. I think this scheduling will be to Rory's favor."</p>
<p>-Jack Nicklaus on the November Masters favoring Rory McIlroy, (via GC Morning Drive) — Ron Mintz (@MintzGolf) April 9, 2020</p>
<p>He managed to complete 7 events, won 1 and finished top 10 six times. His total earnings reached $3,832,721, making him a strong favorite to look forward to. Here is how Mcllroy did in the last seven events this season.</p>
<p>Arnold Palmer Invitational – T-5 th</p>
<p>WGC-Mexico Championship – 5 th</p>
<p>Genesis Invitational – T-5 th</p>
<p>Farmers Insurance Open – T-3 rd</p>
<p>DP World Tour Championship – 4 th</p>
<p>WGC-HSBC Champions – WIN</p>
<p>Zozo Championship – T-3rd</p>
<p>Besides, according to Ron Mintz, Mcllroy also seems to play better in the fall, giving him a natural advantage. Jack Nicklaus, another respected golf analyst, also tipped Rory Mcllroy as the most likely winner of the upcoming 2020 Masters and PGA Championship.</p>
<p>What about Justin Rose?</p>
<p>You would be surprised not to see Justin Rose in the top 10 for the upcoming 2020 Masters. Yet, there is a good reason for that. Rose missed out several top 10 finishes and generally showed declining performance he wasn’t able to pick up on before the abrupt season cut-off.</p>
<p>Yet, Rose has a lot of time to practise and given the fact he’s English, he might be accustomed to this time of the year better when it comes to golfing. It’s interesting to note that the players given the best odds to win this year’s edition of the event are not any of the last five champions. Tiger Woods raised to victory in 2019 and a year before that, the title was captured by Patrick Reed.</p>
<p>Overall, this year’s edition will be an entirely new beast with a lot of unknowns waiting to happen. Xander Schauffele is another strong pick to consider, though, as he was a runner-up to Woods in 2019.</p>
