<p>Thursday Night Football of NFL Week 3 brings us an AFC clash between the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Cleveland Browns. This is going to be the 139th edition of the Steelers vs Browns rivalry, which has been dominated by the Steelers who lead the overall series 79–61–1.</p>
<p>Although the Steelers vs Browns rivalry has been going on for more than 70 years, the Pittsburgh franchise became the dominant force only in the 21st century when Ben Roethlisberger was their quarterback. With Big Ben calling the signals, Pittsburgh went 26-3-1 against Cleveland.</p>
<p>However, Big Ben is no longer the Steelers QB and his replacement, Mitch Trubisky, hasn’t been great in 2022. Does this mean the Browns are going to beat them in Week 3? To see what we think, just keep on reading.</p>

<p>Pittsburgh Fans Don’t Like Trubisky Very Much</p>
<p>The Steelers are 1-1 after two weeks of the 2022 NFL, which was kind of expected. They started the season with a win over the Cincinnati Bengals. They beat the AFC champions 23-20 after overtime in a game in which luck was on their side (for instance, Cincinnati missed an extra point in the last moments of the regular time). In Week 2, they weren’t as lucky – the New England Patriots beat them 17-14</p>
<p>The loss didn’t come as much of a surprise. What surprised everyone is that the Steelers fans did not give warm welcome to their new QB Mitch Trubisky in his home debut. Instead, they booed the guy on several occasions.</p>
<p>It sure didn’t help, and Trubisky had a pretty disappointing game. He threw for one TD (in the fourth quarter), while also getting one of his passes intercepted. On top of that, Trubisky got sacked three times in that game.</p>
<p>All Eyes on Nick Chubb</p>
<p>With QB Deshaun Watson suspended, the Cleveland Browns do not look very dangerous passing-wise. Jacoby Brissett just isn’t the kind of quarterback who can win games on his own. This explains why the Browns have been focused more on rushing.</p>
<p>And their rushing game was brilliant in Week 2, with running back Nick Chubb scoring three touchdowns. It sure seems like a fantastic performance, but not all fans are pleased with him. The thing is that he scored his third TD against the Jets when it was under 2:00 minutes left on the stopwatch.</p>
<p>His TD gave the Browns a 13-point lead, but it also gave the Jets an opportunity to attack. And they took the opportunity – they scored two TDs in the remaining 1:40 minutes, winning the game 31-30.</p>
<p>We at GamblingNews.com are Team Chubb. We think he did his job brilliantly; it was the Browns defense that ruined everything. We expect Chubb to perform equally well in Week 3, while Cleveland’s offense just needs to step up.</p>
<p>Steelers vs Browns Prediction</p>
<p>The Browns defense needs to take things more seriously. Luckily for them, in Week 3, they’re facing a sort of anemic Steelers offense led by Trubisky. They should be able to keep them to under 20 points.</p>
<p>When it comes to the Browns offense, we’re certain they’re going to do great rushing-wise, with Chubb probably scoring at least one touchdown.</p>
<p>Picks: Cleveland Browns to win and cover the spread; under to hit</p>
