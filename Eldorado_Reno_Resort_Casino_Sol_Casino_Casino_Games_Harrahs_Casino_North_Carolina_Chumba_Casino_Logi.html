<p>Dear georgeflas,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. I checked the responsible gambling section and I found this:</p>
<p>"5. Limits</p>
<p>5.1. Set a limit</p>
<p>Deposit limits are part of our Responsible Gaming Policy and can help you to control the amount you spend. You can choose to implement a daily, weekly, or monthly limit. Alternatively, you can choose to implement a combination of these limits for extra control.</p>
<p>We recommend that members set a limit on the amount of money they spend. You can do this simply at ‘My Account’ and then ‘Responsible Gaming’ by inserting an amount in one or more of the ‘Daily Limit’, ‘Weekly Limit’ or ‘Monthly Limit’ boxes. It is a good idea to give yourself a budget. This means that if you start to play more than you want to, you will be alerted.</p>
<p>If you set a deposit limit, any request by you to increase or remove that limit will not take effect for 24 hours. This is to give you a chance to have a period of time which will allow you to reconsider whether you really want to raise your deposit limit. If you make a request to lower your deposit limit before the relevant period has ended or to set a limit, this request will take effect immediately. You may also want to set Wagering Limits which will allow you to control the maximum amount you agree to wager in each time period."</p>
<p>I also tested the deposit limit and you clearly receive a notification that you will be able to change your deposit limit after 24 hours. Please, see here:</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there aren’t unified regulations that would be applied to all casinos, and player protection tools are managed by the casino exclusively. Some casinos have a wide variety of responsible gambling tools but none of them is mandatory, and unfortunately, some casinos operate without them completely. Furthermore, casinos have free hands when designing their player protection tools and you were clearly notified about how this tool works.</p>
<p>If you feel like you need better protection, you can always reconsider opting for self-exclusion, but we are not in a position to force casinos to change deposit limits to fit each player's individual needs.</p>
<p>Please let me know if there is any additional information that I have overlooked, but I’m afraid there is nothing more we can do here.</p>
<p>Thank you very much in advance for your understanding.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Kristina</p>
