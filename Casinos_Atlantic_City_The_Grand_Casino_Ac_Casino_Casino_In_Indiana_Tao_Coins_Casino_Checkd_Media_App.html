    <h1>Casinos Atlantic City The Grand Casino Ac Casino Casino In Indiana Tao Coins Casino Checkd Media App</h1>

<p>Checkd Media, an operator of one of the largest sports betting communities in the UK, announced today that it appointed Michael Scott to a newly created role as Head of Organic Media.</p>
<p>Internal Change of Business Structure</p>
<p>The appointment of Michael Scott is part of the company’s efforts to build on its recent successes by investing further into SEO, and coincided with an internal business split of the company into Performance Media (Paid) and Organic Media. As part of the split, Dylan Casey was promoted to Head of Paid Media, while former senior SEO executive Ollie Dickinson stepped up as SEO manager.</p>
<p>Michael showed in his last role his strategic ability within organic search and leadership skills in fronting a team that delivered strong results. As a Group, we are devoting increased resources to SEO and this appointment is a signal of our intent in this area as we continue to increase our reach among our target demographic of sports fans.” Alex Beecham, Managing Director, Checkd Media</p>
<p>The former SEO lead at Manchester Airports Group’s digital arm, MAG-O, Michael Scott will be responsible for conversion rate and traffic optimization across the company’s Footy Accumulators, The Winners Enclosure and Oddschanger core websites. “Checkd is an innovative, vibrant company that already has incredible influence across its channels. My aim is to lead a strategy that further increases traffic, to build on the successes already gained and to focus on growth for the future. It is a fantastic time to be making the move and I can’t wait to get going,” he asserts.</p>
<p>Record Revenues</p>
<p>Established in 2012 as a social media marketing and technology business in Manchester, UK, the Checkd Group, which consists of two businesses, Check Media and Checkd Dev, experienced significant growth recently, posting record revenues across the board.</p>
<p>Checkd Media seeks to fuel growth mainly via business partnerships and has signed long-term partnership deals with several tier-one sports betting operators, including Betfair, Sky Betting and Gaming and SKB, as the new 2021/22 soccer season is already underway.</p>
<p>Checkd Dev expanded operations by creating bespoke builds for some of the high-profile media companies in the UK and is now planning an expansion into US markets to take advantage of sports betting opportunities there.</p>
<p>In July, Checkd Group received industry-wide recognition after winning in two of the categories at the 2021 iGB Affiliate Awards. With more than two million in audience, Checkd Media won the Best Use of Media award, while Checkd Dev won the Innovation Award for the re-launch of its Footy Accumulators Betting Hub app.</p>
