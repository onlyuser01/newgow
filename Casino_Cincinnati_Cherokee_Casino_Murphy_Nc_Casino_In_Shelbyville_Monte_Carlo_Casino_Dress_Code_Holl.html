<p>CasinoBeats Summit 2022 is on the cards with the date of the event set for May 24 and 26. With one of the biggest industry pow-wows around the corner, it’s fair to say that most of the igaming world’s elite will be in attendance. The event will feature 2,000 delegates and take place at the InterContinental in St Julian, Malta.</p>
<p>With over 160 speakers, there will be a lot to see, try and do for all people in attendance. The event is hosted out of what CasinoBeats describes as the leading hub for interactive gaming, Malta. The hosts will welcome Genesis Global CEO Ariel Reem, JOI Gaming CEO Eric Olders, Bally’s Interactive Adi Dhandhania, Glitnor Group CEO David Flynn, and others.</p>
<p>The opening keynote will be delivered by Malta Gaming Authority CEO Carl Brincat followed by roundtables about markets in Canada, the United States, Japan, Africa, Latin America, Brazil, India, and others.</p>
<p>There is a number of experts who are prepared to take questions from delegates to better understand those markets, including Dilanti Media CEO Johan Styren, Bragg Gaming Chris Looney, BetMonsta CEO Dolan Beuthin, and others. The discussions after that will focus on protecting consumers in key jurisdictions, such as the United Kingdom and Sweden which have been known to focus on creating a safe gambling industry to serve as an industry benchmark for emerging markets.</p>
<p>Global Casino track will also focus on the Netherlands and Germany on May 26. Both markets were recently (re)regulated and they have provided some unique market conditions, which can now be explored by delegates at CasinoBeats Summit. Commenting on this opportunity, SBC founder and CEO Rasmus Sojmark, whose company hosts the summit, said:</p>
<p>"With the CasinoBeats Summit’s Global Casino track, we will meet that demand for knowledge by providing insights from a selection of leading experts on markets around the world, who will be sharing information on topics including regulatory developments, local player tastes, and how to identify the best opportunities."</p>
<p>There will be more discussions with a fair focus put on new generation slots and online casinos and how leadership and marketing shape a better product and a better industry. There will be 40 suppliers to help steer the discussion and demonstrate how far development efforts have gone.</p>
<p>CasinoBeats Summit 2022 expects its delegates who will be initiated into some of the most significant changes in the industry over the past year.</p>
