<p>The fast-growing innovative sports technology company, Genius Sports Limited, announced it extended its partnership with bet365.</p>
<p>Genius Sports Extends Existing Deal with bet365</p>
<p>A statement released by Genius Monday reveals that the company inked a long-term extension of its collaboration with bet365, agreeing to deliver high-quality official data for thousands of events. Under the extended partnership, Genius will provide its exclusive portfolio of official data rights for bet365. This portfolio includes leading sports leagues such as the NFL, AHL, CFL, the Premier League, NASCAR and more.</p>
<p>“Genius Sports Limited, the official data, technology and commercial partner that powers the ecosystem connecting sports, betting and media, has clinched a long-term extension of its official data partnership with bet365,“ reads a statement released by Genius Sports</p>
<p>Currently, Genius is designated as the official data partner of the Mid-American Conference. As a result, the company explained it will offer “the first and only official data feed for betting on NCAA sports” for bet365. Last but not least, the partnership extension will see the duo benefit from Genius’ innovative betting products backed by its tracking and augmentation technology called Second Spectrum.</p>
<p>The Extension Brings Excitement for Genius</p>
<p>Sharing his excitement about the latest announcement, Genius’ CEO, Mark Locke, said that the partnership extension with bet365 reaffirms the company’s goal to offer innovative and engaging betting products for its customers. He acknowledged that there are thousands of events from different sports leagues every year. Locke added that the new collaboration will deliver high-quality data for bet365. In conclusion, he predicted that the collaboration will create immersive and first-of-its-kind experiences for millions of sports fans in different betting markets around the globe.</p>
<p>“Expanding our partnership with bet365, the largest sports betting brand in the world, demonstrates our commitment to delivering the most innovative and compelling products for our customers.“ Mark Locke, CEO of Genius Sports</p>
<p>Earlier this year, bet365 and Genius expanded their collaboration to include additional streaming solutions. This helped bet365 develop more diverse content while at the same time strengthening the duo’s B2B relationship. More recently, Genius inked a strategic exclusive data and integrity partnership with the Australian Professional Leagues. The announcement came last week and saw the company become the exclusive Official Data Partner of the Isuzu UTE A-League Men and the Liberty A-League Women. At the same time, Genius agreed to protect the integrity of sports under the terms of the deal.</p>
