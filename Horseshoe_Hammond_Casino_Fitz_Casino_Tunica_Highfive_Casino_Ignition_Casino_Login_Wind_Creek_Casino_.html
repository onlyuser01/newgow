<p>The leading operator's new festive promotion promises to make five customers millionaires if it snows in London on Christmas morning</p>
<p>The leading betting and gaming operator that is recognized around the globe, Betfred, announced the launch of its first-ever Christmas advertisement, promoting a special festive draw. Released on Monday, the new advertisement promotes Betfred’s special holiday £5 million ($6.2 million) giveaway. Ultimately, the campaign seeks to make five Betfred customers millionaires this Christmas.</p>
<p>To create the new ad, Betfred collaborated with the leading creative and production agency, Zút. Not unexpectedly, the advertisement features the popular Christmas song “Let it Snow,” as it tells the story of different people who are all asking the same question: “Will it snow this Christmas?”</p>
<p>Although the new ad was released Monday, the giveaway promotion is available from November 10, 2023. Sports fans, bettors and online gamblers who want to participate in the giveaway will have until December 24, 2023, to opt into the draw. Additional entries, up to 100 per person, can be secured for every £1+ wager placed on Betfred.com.</p>
<p>Betfred’s new festive giveaway will make five customers millionaires this Christmas, given that it snows on Christmas day. The operator’s festive promo will give five prizes, £1 million ($1.2 million) each if there is snow lying at London Heathrow Airport weather station on December 25, 2023, at 9 am. According to the advertisement, the winners of the special holiday promo will be selected and notified on January 14, 2024.</p>
<p>The Festive Draw Brings Excitement to Zút, Betfred</p>
<p>Matt Thompson, Zút’s creative director, explained that the company wanted to create a special campaign that makes people smile just in time for the holiday season. He explained that Betfred’s debuting Christmas ad featured a popular soundtrack and people who wore colorful costumes, underlining the cheer and joy the holidays bring.</p>
<p>Thompson added that the advertisement was the result of a collective effort. “We worked closely with the Betfred team at all stages of planning and production and having their expertise was vital. We’re all really proud of this campaign – now all we need is snow,” he said in conclusion.</p>
<p>“With all the brilliant sport at Christmas, we wanted to add some extra excitement for our customers.“ Joanne Whittaker, CEO at Betfred</p>
<p>Joanne Whittaker, Betfred’s CEO, added that the company wanted to deliver more excitement for its growing customer base. “Our team came up with the idea of our biggest-ever giveaway, which then prompted our first-ever Christmas advert,” she added.
