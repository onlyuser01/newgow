<p>Local media outlet Village Soup reported that the Maine Gambling Control Board has introduced a new virtual program to help people voluntarily ban themselves from gambling in Maine casinos. Previously, people had to go to a casino or another designated location to fill out the form to ban themselves. With this new virtual option, individuals can register from the comfort of their own homes.</p>
<p>Maine’s Gambling Control Board Works to Provide Resources for Those Affected by Problem Gambling</p>
<p>Self-exclusion is an action that individuals can take to ban themselves from entering all casinos in Maine for one year, three years, five years, or even a lifetime. According to the state’s Gambling Control Board, 79% of Mainers gambled in the past year, with 2% spending money at a casino weekly or more often.</p>
<p>It is important to note that 1% of US adults are estimated to meet the criteria for severe gambling problems, and another 2-3% experience mild or moderate gambling problems that can affect their personal and professional lives.</p>
<p>Steven Silver, the chairman of Maine’s Gambling Control Board, said that while gambling can be fun and entertaining, it can also be harmful to some people. Therefore, the Board wants to make sure that they have the proper resources and services in place to help their fellow Mainers.</p>
<p>The virtual program introduced by Maine’s Gambling Control Board is a positive step in the right direction towards raising awareness and providing resources to those struggling with problem gambling. By making self-exclusion more accessible and convenient, more people can take action to protect themselves from the harms of gambling. It is important for individuals to know that they are not alone and that help is available.</p>
<p>Expert Highlights Gambling Addiction Is as Serious as Drug Addiction</p>
<p>Lori Manson, the problem gambling services coordinator with AdCare Educational Institute in Augusta, believes that self-exclusion can be an effective way for some people who suffer from gambling problems to avoid the temptation of casino gambling.</p>
<p>However, only a small percentage of people who experience gambling problems will seek help. Many people are not even aware that gambling can be addictive in the same way that drugs are.</p>
<p>Research has shown that gambling disorder is like substance use disorder in the way it affects the brain and body. It is important for individuals who are struggling with problem gambling to know that they will not be judged and that there are resources available to help them rebuild their lives.These resources are particularly important considering the fact that the Maine gambling market is set to expand even further this summer. The state is set to introduce sports wagering, pending the establishment of a legal framework by the Maine Gambling Control Unit.</p>
