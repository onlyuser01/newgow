    <h1>Buffalo Run Casino And Resort Augmented Reality Casino Free Doubledown Casino Codes Real Money Casin</h1>

<p>while i am playing on authentic gaming Aspers casino my balance disappeared and could not rebet and 3 winning numbers came out cost me missing winnings 3100€.</p>
<p>i was betting number 12 with 5 neighbouring numbers total bet 313 €</p>
<p>after a lost i try to rebet but no balance .after winning number shown my balance was back .i went to chat to upload screenshots of my bets and the disappeard balance 2 more winning numbers came out .after casino investigation the provider replayed like this :This game round was cancelled because one of the security requirements were not met. In details, the dealer spun the wheel too quickly after the previous winning number and did not wait the required time (so the players can conveniently place their bets).</p>
<p>This is a dealer's mistake and we truly apologize to you and your end user. Unfortunately the stakes were not accepted due to the above mentioned reason and we do not have any record of the player's betting attempts to calculate the potential winnings.</p>
<p>I hope you will accept my sincere apologies that we've caused confusion and for the inconvenience.</p>
<p>1-the game was going as usual i did not see what he is saying i remember i waited more than one minute (normally they spin every 30 seconds)to make the bet not knowing my balance was disappeard .the site cant be put in fullscreen so everything was difficult to see .</p>
<p>2-to calculate my potential winning he just had to look into my last bet .</p>
<p>roulette is very hard to beat and when we can win the tricks come in .i dont know how many excuses i have heard till now.it is a shame .the playier win ,pay out period no need to walk around the issue .a win is a win like a loss is a loss.</p>
<p>the casino should provide the provider of my last lost bet and demand to refund 713€ for number 12 .</p>
<p>provider speaks about security reason caused the issue lol.i have seen many things happend at authentic gaming were they just with out a pause just spin the ball .i have seen once the ball jumped out of the wheel the pitboss just picked it up and putted back in the wheel while the round continued .so please dont fool us .</p>
