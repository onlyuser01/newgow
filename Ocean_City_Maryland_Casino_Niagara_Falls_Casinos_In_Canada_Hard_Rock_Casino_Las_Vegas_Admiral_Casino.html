<p>The Miami Dolphins vs. New York Jets is the only Week 12 game scheduled for Friday, November 24, 2023</p>
<p>The Dolphins vs. Jets Week 12 game is on the program this coming Friday at MetLife Stadium. That’s where the Jets destroyed the Dolphins the last time they welcomed there.</p>
<p>The hosts were brilliant running the ball with five rushing TDs. The visitors did okay rushing-wise, but their passing game was horrible. But there’s a caveat – they were without QB Tua Tagovailoa in that game.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to Friday, November 24, 2023, and Tagovailoa is ready to destroy Miami’s AFC East rival. A win on Friday would keep the Dolphins in the No. 1 spot in the division. A loss, however, could result in the Buffalo Bills leapfrogging them.</p>

<p>All Eyes on the Miami Dolphins Offense</p>
<p>The Miami Dolphins are 7-3 in the 2023 NFL, scoring 30.5 points per game on average. That’s the highest average of all the teams in the league. However, their offense hasn’t been too productive lately, scoring just 34 points in total in their last two games.</p>
<p>Should this worry them ahead of the Dolphins vs. Jets Week 13 game on Friday? We think it should. The Jets are good defensively and the game is played on their turf.</p>
<p>Miami’s quarterback Tagovailoa is used to playing in sunny Florida, but in Week 13, he’s playing in New Jersey. The temperature in Miami is going to be around 80°F, while in East Rutherford, it’s forecasted to be somewhere in the ballpark of 45°F.</p>
<p>The good news, however, is that it’s not going to be a rainy day, nor will there be strong winds on Friday in NJ.</p>
<p>New York Jets Determined to End Their Losing Run</p>
<p>The New York Jets are 4-6 on the season, but three of their four losses happened in their last three games. Further, the last time they won, they did it against their NY rivals, the Giants, after overtime.</p>
<p>The reason behind their poor run is that they’ve been horrendous offensively. Quarterback Zach Wilson has been awful, which is why he got benched for Friday’s game. The Jets’ third-string QB Tim Boyle will take his place against the Dolphins, which probably won’t be much of an improvement.</p>
<p>Introducing the man who will save the season. His talent completely outshines Zach Wilson’s.</p>

<p>After all, Wilson and Boyle are only playing because Aaron Rodgers got injured in the first game of the season. Speaking of Rodgers, we could see him make a comeback in January, but only if the Jets make it to the postseason. So, can they do it?</p>
<p>They probably won’t win the AFC East Division as they’d need to leapfrog both the Bills and the Dolphins. But do they have a chance to get a wild card entry to the 2023 Playoffs? Sure, they have. However, for that to happen, they’d need to win a few more games.</p>
<p>Miami Dolphins vs. New York Jets Prediction</p>
<p>The Miami Dolphins are 10-point favorites against the New York Jets, which we think is just too much. Tagovailoa probably won’t throw for too many TDs at MetLife Stadium.</p>
<p>Plus, the Jets’ runners might do well on Friday. They probably won’t do well enough to win the game, but they can definitely help the Jets avoid a blowout loss.</p>
<p>Picks: New York Jets (+10)</p>
