<p>West Ham has never managed to qualify for the Champions League in its 127 years long history. However, the Hammers might do it this season. They’re now sitting in the #7 position in the English Premier League but moving three spots up in the standings doesn’t seem impossible.</p>
<p>The reason for that is that West Ham’s schedule in the remainder of the EPL season looks relatively easy, starting with the Everton game on Sunday.</p>
<p>By beating struggling Everton, West Ham would improve its chances of making the Top 4. Right now, the odds on that scenario are set to +6000, but they’re likely to shorten if the Hammers win against the Toffees in Round 31.</p>
<p>So, will they do it? Online sportsbooks seem to think so. To see what we think, make sure to read our West Ham vs Everton prediction until the very end!</p>

<p>The Power of West Ham’s 12th Player</p>
<p>With an average attendance of 57.942 per game, West Ham fans are among the most loyal in the Premier League. In fact, there are only two teams (Arsenal and Manchester United) with a higher average attendance than West Ham.</p>
<p>Knowing this, no one should be surprised that the Hammers have been hammering the opposition at London Stadium. In fact, this team is 8-3-4 in the Premier League this season, with only one home loss in 2022.</p>
<p>West Ham is expected to record another home win this Sunday when they’re taking on the league’s worst away team. Everton is 1-3-9 on the road this season with all wins in away matches since the start of the year.</p>
<p>Everton Still Haunted by Relegation Fears</p>
<p>The Toffees have finally put an end to their horrible losing streak. After losing four straight EPL games, they defeated Newcastle on March 20. The score was 1-0, which may not seem impressive, but at least, they got themselves three points.</p>
<p>As a result, they now have three points more than Watford, the closest team from the relegation zone. It’s not much, but Everton has played two games fewer than that team. Unfortunately, the Toffees have some pretty tough matches coming up in the Prem, which is making them worry about their future.</p>
<p>As if that wasn’t enough, their injury problems are yet to go away. Ahead of Round 31, there are at least four Everton players with fitness concerns – Andros Townsend, Tom Davies, Fabian Delph, and Donny van der Beek.</p>
<p>West Ham vs Everton Prediction</p>
<p>The Hammers have a wonderful chance to get to the Champions League, but for that, they need to win many more games. The good news is that their schedule looks easy, with five of their eight remaining EPL matches being against teams from the bottom half of the table.</p>
<p>One of those is Sunday’s game against Everton, which West Ham needs to win in order to keep the Champions League dream alive.</p>
<p>Pick: West Ham to win; over 2.5 goals</p>
