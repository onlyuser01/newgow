<p>The prevention of these strikes will provide Las Vegas with the peace of mind it needs ahead of the Super Bowl</p>
<p>Las Vegas businesses have successfully negotiated with the disgruntled hospitality workers and bus drivers, preventing two strikes that would have jeopardized preparations for the Super Bowl. This will provide some breathing space to the city’s businesses ahead of the highly-anticipated event.</p>
<p>The Culinary Union was negotiating with multiple casinos and had threatened to strike on Monday. However, the walkout was canceled thanks to agreements with Downtown Grand Hotel &amp; Casino and Golden Nugget Las Vegas Hotel &amp; Casino.</p>
<p>As things stand now, Virgin Hotels Las Vegas is the last local property where Culinary Union workers are yet to secure contracts. Ted Pappageorge, the union’s secretary-treasurer, recently commented on the matter, saying that his team has decided to give the latter property some more time to reach an agreement with its workers. He explained that the Culinary Union expects a resolution on a new contract in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>For reference, the Culinary Union recently achieved victories at a number of Strip and Downtown casinos, securing five-year contracts across multiple properties.</p>
<p>Bus Drivers Refrained from Striking Too</p>
<p>In the meantime, Las Vegas bus drivers and mechanics also reached a last-minute agreement and decided to forgo their strike.</p>
<p>For reference, Transdev, the firm behind the Regional Transportation Commission (RTC) of Southern Nevada’s public bus service, and the Amalgamated Transit Union (ATU) Local 1637 had threatened to strike after failing to reach an agreement for multiple months. Luckily, the two bodies managed to score a deal, although it is yet to be approved by all union members.</p>
<p>In any case, the prevention of this strike will provide Las Vegas with the peace of mind it needs ahead of the Super Bowl.</p>
<p>The Super Bowl Is Just Around the Corner</p>
<p>As the Super Bowl looms, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell issued a stern reminder to all 32 teams, reminding them of the league’s strict gambling policies. The commissioner emphasized the importance of maintaining the event’s integrity and ensuring a frictionless and fraud-free game.</p>
<p>In the meantime, sportsbooks continue to shy away from offering non-game bets, such as whether pop sensation Taylor Swift will appear at the event to support her boyfriend, Travis Kelce, and the Kansas City Chiefs.</p>
<p>For reference, the 58th edition of the event will see the Kansas City Chiefs challenge the San Francisco 49ers in a game set to take place on February 11 at Allegiant Stadium in Paradise, Nevada.</p>
