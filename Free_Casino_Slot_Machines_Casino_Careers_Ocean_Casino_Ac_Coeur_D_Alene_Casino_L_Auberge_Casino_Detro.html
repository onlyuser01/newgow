<p>In October, significant revenue losses were disclosed by the Michigan Gaming Control Board, with each casino experiencing downturns ranging between $5 million and $7 million</p>
<p>The month-long strike by 3,700 workers across MGM Grand Detroit, MotorCity Casino, and Hollywood Casino at Greektown is taking a toll on Detroit’s gaming scene. As a result of the ongoing labor dispute, temporary closures have been announced, impacting valet services and various amenities at all three establishments.</p>
<p>Detroit Casinos Face Service Disruptions and Revenue Plunge Amidst Strike Fallout</p>
<p>Despite the casinos remaining open, the absence of valet services has forced patrons to use self-parking garages exclusively. MotorCity Casino, facing additional challenges, has seen closures in high-limit table games, first-floor slots, poker rooms, D.TOUR Spa, Lacquer Gift Shop, and the radio bar.</p>
<p>Hollywood Casino at Greektown has adjusted its services, reducing restaurant hours and impacting beverage offerings. While the strike has led to a decline in revenue, the resolve among striking workers remains high.</p>
<p>The Michigan Gaming Control Board revealed substantial revenue losses for October, the month when the strike began. Each casino reported losses ranging from $5 million to $7 million. The market shares for October were 46% for MGM, 31% for MotorCity, and 23% for Hollywood Casino at Greektown.</p>
<p>The financial impact is evident in the October revenue figures, showing an 18% drop in revenue compared to the previous month. The three casinos collectively reported $82.8 million in revenue, with MGM leading at $37.3 million, down 19.6%, followed by MotorCity with $25 million, down 22.8%, and Hollywood Casino at $19.4 million, down 11.7%.</p>
<p>Detroit Casino Council Keeps on Fighting for Workers’ Rights</p>
<p>Taxes paid to the state and city also decreased significantly, with a total decline of $3.9 million compared to October 2022. The workers’ strike, which began on October 17, has affected not only gaming revenue but also retail sports betting, which recorded a 23% decline in handle, dropping to $18.1 million.</p>
<p>The impact on retail sports betting revenue is substantial, with a 46.9% year-over-year decrease. The MGM Grand Detroit saw the most significant decline, recording just $4.7 million in handle, a 51.1% drop from October 2022.</p>
<p>As the strike continues into November, the future looks challenging for Detroit’s gaming industry, with potential greater losses anticipated in the coming months.</p>
<p>The Detroit Casino Council, representing workers from five different unions, is advocating for improved healthcare, better wages, job security, and fair workloads. Kimberly Rector, a MotorCity worker, conveyed that they feel appreciated outside because there is a lack of appreciation inside and they will keep on striking until they achieve what they want, reported Fox 2 Detroit.</p>
