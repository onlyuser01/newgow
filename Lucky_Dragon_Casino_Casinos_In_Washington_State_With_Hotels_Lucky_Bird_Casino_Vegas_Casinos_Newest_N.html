    <h1>Lucky Dragon Casino Casinos In Washington State With Hotels Lucky Bird Casino Vegas Casinos Newest N</h1>

<p>I had recently registered and a total of 450 euros (100 and 350) commissioned a payout. The 100 euros were paid without any problems, for the 2.</p>
<p>Disbursement I should submit ID and account statement for verification.</p>
<p>I had done both and on the same day my identity card copy was not accepted because I had scanned this and you accept no scanned ID cards at Bob. An indication of this can not be found on the bobsleigh website, however, there is only "Please send us your ID card, front and back.</p>
<p>Only after 5 requests to the support I received the information that I should submit a cell phone photo of the ID.</p>
<p>Since I had annoyed me in the meantime on the bobsleigh club, I have my account blocked and in advance the payment of 350 euros in order.</p>
<p>Have told the support again that I would have no interest in a future participation in the game and asked for payment of the open 350 euros and sent this mail my photographed ID.</p>
<p>The answer from Bob:</p>
<p>Documents sent by mail attachment will not be accepted, I would have to do this through my account, which is impossible as I said, because I had the self-lock completed. Now again contacted the support and asked to unlock my account, and all the questions you have answered!</p>
<p>Now a week has passed, the account activation has not happened until today!</p>
<p>Warning to all casino friends: Never play at Bob Casino !!!!</p>
