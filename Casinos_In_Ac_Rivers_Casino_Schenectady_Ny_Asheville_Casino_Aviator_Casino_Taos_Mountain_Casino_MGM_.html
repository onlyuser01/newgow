<p>Thousands of Solar Panels have been installed in the Springfield, Massachusetts Casino.</p>
<p>The Solar Panels to be Launched in January 2020.</p>
<p>MGM Springfield, the top casino resort in Massachusetts, has had thousands of solar panels installed at its resort casino in Springfield. The panels will become operational in January, 2020.</p>
<p>From the company explained that these 3,000-panel solar canopy panels have been placed on roof deck of the eight-floor garage in the 2-million square foot casino’s premises located in downtown Springfield.</p>
<p>The aim of installing the panels is to produce more than 1,600 megawatt hours of electricity to power approximately 10% of the site where, apart from the casino, are located a hotel and an entertainment complex.</p>
<p>The panels are expected to decrease the complex’s yearly carbon emission by about 410 metric tons.</p>
<p>According to the Republican newspaper of Springfield the panels are actually a part of a bigger energy efficient strategy of MGM, which involves harvesting rainwater in cisterns for irrigation, installing low-water fixtures and LED lights, and bulging electric vehicle charging stations.</p>
<p>MGM and Invenergy Partner in Installing a Solar Array Near Las Vegas</p>
<p>Last year, MGM, along with Invenergy –a developer of sustainable energy solutions – installed a 100 megawatt solar array close to Las Vegas.</p>
<p>The facility that is built on 640 acres will contain nearly 336,000 solar panels and is expected to start functioning by the end of next year.</p>
<p>It will produce electricity enough for 27,000 households for a year. MGM will buy the all the electricity genereted by the facility to power its 13 premises in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the construction of the project will ensure employment of 350 workers whereas the facility itself is expected to generate nearly $20 million of sales and property tax revenues.</p>
<p>Since 2015, Invenergy has partnered with ten more companies on different projects for renewable energy thus helping to save over 1,100 megawatts of electricity.</p>
<p>Renewable Energy – a Priority for American Businesses</p>
<p>“It’s really a strong, strong project. We’re really proud of it,” senior vice president and chief sustainability officer for MGM Resorts Cindy Ortega commented on the new project.</p>
<p>Jim Murren, chairman and CEO of MGM Resorts International also commented on the importance of the company’s environmental performance. He said that protecting the planet is a vital part of MGM’s business plan. Furthermore, he added that he considers it the company’s responsibility to find innovative ways where they can use clean energy to power their resorts.</p>
<p>“As a company we care deeply about how we use our resources. This array will be a new source of clean energy that will help power our Las Vegas resorts,”concluded Murren.</p>
<p>MGM is by far not the only U.S. business actively using renewable energy. Last year, the giant Amazon announced the launch of its biggest wind farm located in Scurry County , Texas.</p>
<p>Amazon Wind Farm Texas has more than one hundred 300-feet turbines. and according to the company the wind farm is able to generate more than 1 million additional MW hours of clean energy every year.</p>
