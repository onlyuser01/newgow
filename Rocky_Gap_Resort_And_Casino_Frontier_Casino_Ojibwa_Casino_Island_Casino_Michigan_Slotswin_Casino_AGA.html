<p>Rumbolz boasts a colorful track record that saw him rise “from a busboy to the c-suite,” the AGA said</p>
<p>Two days after naming an ex-Washington Commanders executive as SVP of strategic communications, the American Gaming Association (AGA) has elected Michael Rumbolz as its new chairman.</p>
<p>Rumbolz currently serves as the executive chair of Everi Holdings’ board. As chair of the AGA, he will succeed Hard Rock International Chairman and Seminole Gaming CEO Jim Allen. The new appointee’s term is set to begin in January 2024.</p>
<p>Rumbolz boasts a colorful track record that saw him rise “from a busboy to the c-suite,” the AGA said. His career spans across all levels and aspects of the gaming industry with experience encompassing gaming equipment manufacturing and distribution, hotel and casino operations, casino financial technology, iGaming and compliance.</p>
<p>Some of the hire’s most notable prior positions include time as chief executive officer of Everi Holdings, member and chair of the Nevada Gaming Control Board and chief deputy attorney general of Nevada.</p>
<p>Rumbolz’ predecessor, Allen, played a key role in the industry’s impressive post-COVID recovery and the war on illegal gambling. The new hire will be responsible for maintaining the existing momentum and reinforcing the industry.</p>
<p>Rumbolz Will Be a Valuable Asset to the AGA</p>
<p>Rumbolz commented on his new position, expressing his gratitude about the opportunity to help shape gaming’s future. He promised to leverage his new position to build on the progress his predecessor made.</p>
<p>From stopping illegal gambling to evolving responsible gambling, the AGA is tackling transformational issues and I am eager to build on the progress made during Jim’s tenure. Michael Rumbolz, chair, AGA</p>
<p>Bill Miller, the AGA’s president and chief executive officer, welcomed the new hire on board, praising him as “an industry legend in his own right.” Miller is certain that Rumbolz’ prior career has taught him all the skills needed to make him an invaluable addition to the AGA team.</p>
<p>Mike’s career as an operator, manufacturer and regulator is unparalleled and will be vital to driving meaningful progress on industry priorities. Bill Miller, president &amp; CEO, AGA</p>
<p>Miller also commented on Allen’s departure, thanking him for his exceptional service and help in maximizing the AGA’s impact on the industry. The CEO described the outgoing chair as a “trusted advisor” and said that he is thankful for his partnership.</p>
<p>Allen also shared his thoughts on the matter, saying that the AGA is poised for reshaping the industry under Miller and Rumbolz’ leadership. He concluded: “Our industry and this association have never been stronger. I am immensely proud of our success over the last two years accelerating gaming’s recovery while defining and advancing new priorities.”</p>
