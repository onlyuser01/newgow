<p>Gaming Corps, a leading developer of original gaming and iGaming content, has been cleared for launch in the Netherlands. This will allow the company to expand its presence in Europe.</p>
<p>Gaming Corps Greenlit to Launch in the Netherlands</p>
<p>As announced by Gaming Corps, the provider will be allowed to launch its full content portfolio in the Netherlands. The company can now either directly power operators with its exciting games or do so through an aggregator. The provider will, therefore, be able to expand its agreements with some of its existing partners that operate in the Netherlands and ink new ones with local operators.</p>
<p>The move marks a further step in Gaming Corps’ international expansion. Launching in new markets has been a key part of the company’s growth strategy, which is why the developer is thrilled to offer its entire gaming portfolio to players in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>Dutch players will now get to enjoy Gaming Corps’ rich selection of gambling games. The company boasts a diverse portfolio that features slots, mine, crash and table games among others. Some of the best titles that will hit the Dutch market include games such as Penalty Champion, Tikiz N Juice, Stormy Witch, Coin Miner, Jet Lucky 2, Skyliner and Cat Ching.</p>
<p>Gaming Corps also emphasized that it is firmly committed to safer gambling.</p>
<p>A Few Companies Have Shown Interest in Gaming Corps Content</p>
<p>Juha Kauppinen, the chief executive officer of Gaming Corps, spoke about the launch in the Netherlands. He noted that the approval is an important step for his company, which always seeks to foray into new markets. According to Kauppinen, each new jurisdiction Gaming Corps launches in provides it with a whole new audience to engage with content. Because of that, the company loves it when it clears all regulatory requirements to enter a new country.</p>
<p>The CEO said that that expansion stimulates Gaming Corps to continue rolling out exciting content. He is happy that numerous operators in the Netherlands have already expressed interest in adopting Gaming Corps content. Kauppinen promised to share more news when such an agreement has been reached.</p>
<p>In other news, Gaming Corps recently introduced its content in the Belgian iGaming market, supplying Casino777.be, a local online casino operator, with content. A month earlier, the supplier also agreed to add content to SOFTSWISS’ platform.</p>
<p>In October, Gaming Corps reinforced its production team with the appointment of Connor Blinman as the company’s new head of content. His task now is to continue Gaming Corps’ winning strategy while boosting productivity.</p>
