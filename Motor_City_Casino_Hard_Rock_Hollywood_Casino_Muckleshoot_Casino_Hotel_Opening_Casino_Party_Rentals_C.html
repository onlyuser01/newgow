<p>New Orleans Saints, Las Vegas Raiders Look To Stop Skids On ‘NFL Sunday’</p>

<p>The New Orleans Saints and the Las Vegas Raiders have both been giving subpar performances this NFL season. As they get ready to take the field again today, they face teams that could continue to cause trouble.</p>

<p>The Saints face the L.A. Rams without the domination they had in previous seasons. The only good news is that the Rams aren’t too much better.</p>
<p>The Raiders, who the Saints blanked a couple of weeks ago, will face the Denver Broncos for the second time. Although the Raiders won that game, they did so behind a lethargic Derek Carr, who only put up 188 yards and no TDs.</p>
<p>Saints Still Trying To Define Team</p>
<p>Both the Saints and the Rams have disappointed in big ways this season. The Saints’ 19 turnovers are the most in the NFL so far this year, and ties for the most the team has had across 10 games since 2014.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the Rams have had difficulty on defense. They haven’t recorded a sack in three straight games, and have just one pick in their last seven games.</p>
<p>New Orleans will have the return of wide receiver Jarvis Landry, who could boost their offense. However, that’s only if Andy Dalton, their go-to QB once again, can find his rhythm. He’s 141 for 217 passing attempts for 1,559 yards and 11 touchdowns, but he also has seven interceptions.</p>
<p>On the other side, QB Matt Stafford has been able to find his receivers more often. He has gone 195 for 285 for 1,928 yards, picking up eight touchdowns along the way. However, his eight interceptions have been costly.</p>
<p>The Saints are now 3-7 with a 2-4 record at home. The offense averages 22.2 yards per game and has only averaged 24.7 points against per game defensively.</p>
<p>The Rams, at 3-6, have recorded just one road win. The offense averages 16.4 per game and has given up an average of 22.2 points per game defensively.</p>
<p>These two teams have met 77 times, including two postseason matchups. The Rams have the lead, winning 43 of them.</p>
<p>That’s not enough for the sportsbooks, though, which have the Saints in front. The over/under of about 39 is too high, unless both Dalton and Stafford have a good day.</p>
<p>Raiders Desperate For Another Win</p>
<p>Las Vegas has the historic dominance of their matchup with the Broncos. They’ve taken 70 of the 126 games, including the last five in a row. Most recently, they held on to beat Denver when they played at Allegiant Stadium on October 2.</p>

<p>QB Russell Wilson has not been the same as when he was with the Seattle Seahawks. He’s dealing with an injury that doesn’t want to go away. But he has also had to contend with an offense that hasn’t given him much support.</p>
<p>The Raiders should give a greater role to running back Josh Jacobs, who is usually solid on the ground. If he gets help from his offensive line to create holes, he becomes a wrecking ball. However, that has been an issue lately.</p>
<p>Las Vegas had the opportunity to win several games, but blew it. They’re at the bottom of the AFC West, one spot below the Broncos, looking up with many more doubts than certainties about the future and the present.</p>
<p>The only good news is that they already proved themselves once against the Broncos. They’ll try to show that the victory wasn’t a fluke.</p>
<p>The sportsbooks aren’t convinced that they will, and Denver comes in as the favorite. The Broncos haven’t been able to put up the points this year, except in their game against the Raiders, and a repeat is coming today.</p>
