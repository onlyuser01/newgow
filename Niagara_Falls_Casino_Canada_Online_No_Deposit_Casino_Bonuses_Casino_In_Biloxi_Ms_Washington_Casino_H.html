<p>Tottenham vs Chelsea is the only Premier League game scheduled for Sunday, February 26, 2023. The duel between two London-based teams will take place at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium</p>
<p>Although it’s not the fiercest rivalry in England, Tottenham vs Chelsea is a London derby, and such, duels between these two are always interesting. Sunday’s game too is supposed to be very exciting, as both teams pack a lot of talent on the roster. However, the Blues just haven’t been showing it. Maybe that changes this weekend?</p>

<p>The Spurs are Flying High and They Wanna Keep on Doing It</p>
<p>Antonio Conte’s men are currently fourth in the Premier League, but there are several teams that could overtake their position in the foreseeable future. Newcastle, for example, have just one point less, as well as a game in hand.</p>
<p>Knowing this, the Spurs just need to keep on playing well in order to stay in the Top 4 and get themselves a place in the Champions League next season. The good news is that their form is great with three wins in their last four EPL games.</p>
<p>They did suffer an embarrassing 4-1 loss to Leicester City two weeks ago, followed by a 1-0 loss to AC Milan in the Champions League. However, since then, they’ve rebounded with a 2-0 win over West Ham in the Prem.</p>
<p>There are some problems, though, over in Tottenham. They got at least three injured players ahead of the clash with Chelsea, most notably, their first-choice goalkeeper Hugo Lloris. Fraser Forster has taken his place, but with him between the sticks, the Spurs conceded five goals in three games.</p>
<p>It’s Really High Time for Chelsea to Start Winning</p>
<p>Since Todd Boehly bought Chelsea, the club spent more than $600 million on transfers. During the January transfer window, the Blues signed a dozen new players, some of whom are real superstars – Enzo Fernandez, Mykhailo Murdyk, Joao Felix (loan), and others.</p>
<p>However, despite splashing out huge amounts of money, Chelsea haven’t been great in 2023. In fact, it’s been just the opposite. The Blues have won only one game this year, while drawing four, and losing five games. Their most recent loss happened to bottom-placed Southampton who beat them 1-0 on Chelsea’s turf.</p>
<p>Despite all this, Boehly still seems to have faith in manager Graham Potter. In fact, there are rumors that the American businessman is ready to invest even more money, possibly even spending another $60 million to sign Neymar.</p>
<p>Tottenham vs Chelsea Prediction</p>
<p>Chelsea really need to start playing better soccer. Not losing to Tottenham is a must, but we doubt they can beat the Spurs who are in much better shape than them right now. That said, we think a draw is the most likely outcome.</p>
<p>Pick: Tottenham and Chelsea to draw</p>
