<p>Anaxi and Caesars Sportsbook &amp; Casino will provide an elevated gaming experience to players worldwide with a new partnership</p>
<p>Anaxi and Caesars Sportsbook &amp; Casino announced they have joined forces to offer an extraordinary online gaming experience to players worldwide.</p>
<p>Anaxi Will Bring World-Class Digital Gaming Content to Caesars Casino Library</p>
<p>Caesars Sportsbook &amp; Casino, one of the fastest-growing iGaming operators in North America, has an online casino presence in various states, including New Jersey, Michigan, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Ontario. The new partnership with Anaxi will add to Caesars’ online casino game library, providing its customers with an elevated gaming experience.</p>
<p>Anaxi, the brainchild of Aristocrat, was officially launched at G2E in October 2022, and it brings an extensive catalog of world-class digital and mobile products to the iGaming industry. With Anaxi’s global content studios and Customer Experience Solutions (CXS) team, players can connect seamlessly from their mobile devices to the casino floor, showcasing world-class content via one seamless experience. Cath Burns, EVP of Anaxi, commented on the collaboration with Caesars:</p>
<p>Our commitment to both guest and operator entertainment experiences are at the heart of everything we do, and great partnerships of this kind are the driving force in continuing to move our industry innovations forward. We are excited for this collaboration as Anaxi brings iconic titles to the Caesars empire. Cath Burns, Executive Vice President of Anaxi</p>
<p>According to Matt Sunderland, the SVP of iGaming at Caesars Sportsbook &amp; Casino, Aristocrat is renowned for producing world-class content, and they are thrilled to be one of the first to incorporate Aristocrat’s latest Anaxi game content into their platform. Sunderland believes that the combination of this new content with Caesars’ innovative platform will offer players the most exceptional experience possible in the industry.</p>
<p>In 2023, Anaxi will launch several iconic Aristocrat titles on Caesars Sportsbook and Casino, giving players access to some of the best online gaming experiences.</p>
<p>Aristocrat’s Anaxi Division Expands Through Acquisitions and Partnerships</p>
<p>Aristocrat rebranded its online RMG division as Anaxi, forming the third business unit of the Aristocrat Group in October 2022. The move supported Aristocrat’s growth strategy, which included creating a dedicated online RMG unit and pursuing opportunities like mergers and acquisitions.</p>
<p>Anaxi quickly delivered on that promise with the following acquisition of Roxor Gaming, which provided Anaxi with content publishing technology and remote game server operations, advancing its growth in the iGaming vertical. Aristocrat also signed a multi-year partnership with the NFL’s New England Patriots to expand its brand reach. In February 2023, not long after Anaxi was officially launched, it announced another major milestone – it signed a strategic partnership with sports betting giant BetMGM.</p>
