    <h1>Nevada Casinos Embassy Suites By Hilton San Juan Hotel Casino Catskills Casino Hardrock Casino Hampt</h1>

<p>I deposited just fine via Bitcoin. Lost then accepted a bonus chip they offered followed all the rules to a T because I have made withdrawals before from other casinos where they were voided I’m talking much bigger amounts. Anyway talked to chat agent or several and they kept telling me the same thing keep trying or clear your cache and log back in try it again. Did that several times and still says the same thing. Obviously I havnt broken any rules because the chat agent would inform me that I can’t withdraw. I know I didn’t as well because once again what I mentioned above. Getting pretty sickening all these online casinos can get away with taking your money in seconds. But when it comes to payouts big or small it’s like pulling teeth. Or they hope you just get frustrated in waiting so damn long for a payment that you play your balance out. Anything else you need let me know, as all the information I provided is 100% true I shoulda read more reviews before making a deposit but somewhere down the line it seems like every online casino is guilty of this one time or another. Either pay up or shut down. It’s only a $100 you can’t pay that out without waiting a month or more shouldn’t even be accessible online.</p>
