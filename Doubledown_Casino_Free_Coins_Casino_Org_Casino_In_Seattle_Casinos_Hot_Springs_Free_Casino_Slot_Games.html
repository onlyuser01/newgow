<p>The agreement extends Caesars’ already tight relationship with the NFL that saw the gaming company become the league’s official casino sponsor earlier this year.</p>
<p>The deal, which includes in-stadium signage and branding, Eagles Legends appearances, and email and direct mail marketing, will further enhance Caesars Entertainment’s already existing exclusive marketing deal with the National Football League,” according to a statement.</p>
<p>Financial terms of the pact with the Eagles weren’t disclosed.</p>
<p>The marketing accord with the Eagles is arguably a coup for Caesars, because Harrah’s, located in the Philadelphia suburb of Chester, is one of several gaming properties in or around the City of Brotherly Love. The Parx, Rivers, formerly the Sugarhouse, and the Valley Forge Casino Resort are the other nearby gaming venues.</p>
<p>Local Ties</p>
<p>As sports betting has boomed in Pennsylvania, operators and teams with footprints in Philadelphia, the state’s largest city, are moving to form partnerships. Last month, the Eagles and Unibet revealed an agreement permitting the online gaming company to display its logo at Lincoln Financial Field. However, Unibet isn’t allowed to advertise sportsbook services at the Eagles’ home turf.</p>
<p>In October, the NBA’s Philadelphia 76ers and the Parx Casino partnered to make the gaming group the “Official Winning Partner of the Philadelphia 76ers.” Under terms of that agreement, Parx pays bonuses to bettors using its mobile application and online platform corresponding to Sixers’ wins. Harrah’s is the official casino partner of the NBA franchise.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Rivers, then still known as SugarHouse Casino, announced a deal with the NHL’s Philadelphia Flyers, making the operators the official sportsbook partner of the team and its home arena, the Wells Fargo Center.</p>
<p>Operators’ interest in partnering with Philadelphia’s professional franchises comes at a time when sports betting is taking off in the Keystone State. In October, the last month with readily available data, Pennsylvania’s sports wagering handle swelled to $241.2 million, a 24 percent jump from September.</p>
<p>Sportsbooks are still opening across the state, and the Cordish Companies – Live! Casino is slated to open in Philadelphia sometime next year.</p>
<p>Harrah’s-Eagles Details</p>
<p>Harrah’s Philadelphia will sponsor the Eagles’ drive summary and the team’s “Scratch and Win” game in its mobile app.</p>
<p>The casino will also have a branding presence in select email campaigns to the Eagles fanbase, as well as in the Eagles Pro Shop, located at Lincoln Financial Field,” according to the statement. “Casino guests will also enjoy commemorative Eagles Caesars Rewards cards, co-branded apparel and gifts, and Philadelphia Eagles-branded table games.”</p>
<p>Under the terms of its original deal with the NFL, Caesars is a casino sponsor, and that agreement does not pertain to daily fantasy or sports betting marketing opportunities.</p>
<p>The operator of the famous Caesars Palace is also involved with planning for the 2020 NFL Draft, which will take place on the Las Vegas Strip in advance of the Oakland Raiders’ move to Sin City.</p>
