<p>Only 17 reigning NFL champions failed to make the playoffs in the 56 years of the Super Bowl era. Will the Los Angeles Rams be the 18th? Their chance of qualifying for the postseason is just 1% according to the New York Times, even if Sean McVay’s boys manage to win all five of their remaining games in the regular season.</p>
<p>The Las Vegas Raiders – the Rams’ next opponents – are in a slightly better position. Their chance of making the playoffs is 13%, but only if they can keep their good run going. They’re looking for their fourth straight win on Thursday night when they’re coming to SoFi Stadium to take on the reigning champs.</p>

<p>Las Vegas Raiders Determined to Win the Week 14 TNF Game</p>
<p>After a slow start to the season, the Las Vegas Raiders are playing great. They’re on a 3-win streak, although two of those wins did happen in overtime. It started with a 22-16 win over the Denver Broncos in overtime (after 16-16 in regulation), followed by a 40-34 (34-34) win against the Seattle Seahawks. Last Sunday, we saw them defeat the Los Angeles Chargers 27-20.</p>
<p>The reason behind their success in the last couple of weeks is that QB Derek Carr and WR Davante Adams have finally clicked. In the previous three games, Carr threw for seven touchdowns in total, four of which were caught by Adams.</p>
<p>Their defense has also been good, which isn’t surprising when they got such big names as Chandler Jones and Maxx Crosby on the roster. Both of these defensive ends will be in the spotlight in the TNF game when their job is going to be to stop the Rams’ runners on each flank.</p>
<p>Don’t Expect Too Much from Los Angeles Rams’ Offense</p>
<p>As revealed on Monday, the Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford is out for the season with a spinal cord contusion. The Rams aren’t looking for a new QB, given the fact that no elite signal-caller is likely to agree to a deal with a team that’s almost 100% certain to miss out on the playoff action.</p>
<p>As a result, their starting QB in the TNF game of Week 14 is going to be Bryce Perkins, a 25-year-old QB who made his first-ever NFL start last weekend. It happened in the game against the Seattle Seahawks which his team lost 27-23. Perkins went 13-for-23 throwing for one TD and two interceptions.</p>
<p>With him as the QB, the Rams probably won’t get much from their passing game. The trouble is that their rushing game hasn’t be great in 2022 either. They rank 22nd in the NFL in rushing TDs per game and 30th in rushing yards.</p>
<p>Las Vegas Raiders vs Los Angeles Rams Prediction</p>
<p>This game seems like a perfect storm for the Raiders. Everything is going in their favor at the moment, which is why anything but an easy win for the visitors would be a major surprise.</p>
