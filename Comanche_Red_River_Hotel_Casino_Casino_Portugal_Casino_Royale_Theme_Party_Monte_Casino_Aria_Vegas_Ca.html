    <h1>Comanche Red River Hotel Casino Casino Portugal Casino Royale Theme Party Monte Casino Aria Vegas Ca</h1>

<p>Dear nikowein1980,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting this complaint. I'm really sorry to hear about your issue. Please understand that KYC is a very important and essential process, during which the casino makes sure that the money is sent to the rightful owner. As they don't have the luxury of being able to physically see all of the players and check their identification and documents, this is the only way gambling establishments are able to complete the verification procedures. None of the serious and licensed casinos takes KYC lightly and it might take a few working days to complete this thorough process.</p>
<p>Moreover, I have checked the casino's Terms and Conditions, and this is what I found:</p>
<p>2.4 We can ask you to prove your identity, especially the age and country of residence. These measures are required before your first funds withdraw and can be repeated to make sure that you comply with our policies. In some cases the Casino may require verification of a player via live video call (Google meet). Decision about such video call is made at our own discretion. In case we find that you fail to meet requirements, determined by these Terms &amp; Conditions, we can limit your access to the website or suspend the Player Account.</p>
<p>Is it possible that your account has been suspended temporarily until your documents are verified? Could you please advise which verification documents you have already provided and when exactly did you send the last one? Have you provided all the required documents as soon as possible and in the correct format?</p>
<p>I hope we will be able to help you to resolve this issue as soon as possible. Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Veronika</p>
