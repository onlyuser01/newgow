<p>Las Vegas Resort Fees Increase Again, Caesars Palace and Rio Raise Charges</p>

<p>Las Vegas resort fees are on the rise again. Despite widespread backlash on social media, Caesars Entertainment is joining rival MGM Resorts in going against the critics and upping the add-on charges.</p>

<p>Caesars Palace has increased its daily resort fee from $39 to $45. With taxes: $51.02.</p>
<p>The casino operator says the rate hike is for its namesake property to fall in line with other luxury Strip properties where $45 is the norm. They include The Venetian and Palazzo, Wynn and Encore, Bellagio and Aria.</p>
<p>The Rio All-Suite Hotel and Casino is also upping its daily resort fee from $32 to $35. With taxes: $39.68.</p>
<p>Caesars reached a deal last month to sell Rio to New York-based Imperial Companies. Under the arrangement, Caesars will continue operating the casino resort at a cost of $45 million in annual rent for a minimum of two years.</p>
<p>Fees Galore</p>
<p>Caesars hadn’t raised its resort fees at any of its Las Vegas casinos since 2017. The casino giant is set to be officially acquired by Eldorado Resorts early next year.</p>
<p>But unlike at Sands’ Venetian and Palazzo, and the two Wynn properties, Caesars continues to charge for both self and valet parking. Such luxuries are included at the Sands and Wynn resorts. MGM also charges for parking.</p>
<p>Las Vegas resort fees are defended by casinos as affording guests such amenities as in-room and resort-wide Wi-Fi, local and toll-free calling, fitness center access, boarding pass printing, and newspaper services.</p>
<p>Resort fees – sometimes disguised as a “destination fee,” “venue fee,” “concession fee,” “amenities fee,” and “facilities fee” – “all come down to greed,” one Casino.org commenter opined. “They are nickel and diming. Greed.”</p>
<p>Frequent Sin City visitor Tim Adelin said he’s taking the ever-growing charges out on employees.</p>
<p>“We no longer tip and assume the resort will properly pay the server out from the outrageous prices they now charge us,” Adelin explained. “That is the employee’s problem with the employer now. It is no longer the customer’s problem.”</p>
<p>Congress Intervention</p>
<p>Late last month, legislation was introduced to Congress that would require hotels to include all fees in the advertised price of a room. Aside from government taxes, the rate would need to be inclusive of all mandatory add-on charges like resort fees.</p>
<p>Other non-mandatory charges – parking, for instance – wouldn’t need to be included, as someone without a car won’t be forced to pay for a space.</p>
<p>“Consumers should be able to enjoy their vacation without being ripped off and financially burdened,” bill sponsor Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson (D-Texas) said. “This bill would require that the prices advertised by hotels and online travel agencies must include all mandatory fees that will be charged to a consumer, excluding taxes.”</p>
<p>Nevada US Rep. Dina Titus (D) – whose district includes the entire Las Vegas Strip – said she supports such legislation to “allow consumers to make wise purchasing decisions,” but would want to make sure the casinos’ perspective is considered.</p>
