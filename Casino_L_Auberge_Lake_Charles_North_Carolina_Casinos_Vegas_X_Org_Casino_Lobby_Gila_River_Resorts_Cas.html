    <h1>Casino L Auberge Lake Charles North Carolina Casinos Vegas X Org Casino Lobby Gila River Resorts Cas</h1>

<p>Dear Tuscani090283 and Dexterbet casino representative,</p>
<p>What happened in this case, is happening only to several percent of the players who converted the bonus, and the amount after the conversion is less than the maximum withdrawable amount.</p>
<p>For these players, it is easy to assume that when bonus balance was transferred to real balance, it meant that wagering was over and the balance was also capped (it actually wasn't), and these players may choose to continue to play as with real money. (and I cannot blame these players because it is truly confusing)</p>
<p>The basic argument of the casino is that the player should read the terms and conditions before playing.</p>
<p>However, at the terms and conditions is also written:</p>
<p>We may revise these terms of use at any time by amending this page. You are expected to check this page from time to time to take notice of any changes we made, as they are binding on you. Some of the provisions contained in these terms of use may also be superseded by provisions or notices published elsewhere on the website.</p>
<p>You may not realize it, but General Terms and Conditions have 18 pages (Word standard size - Arial 11), + we also need to consider Bonus terms and conditions + 15 pages, so together, we have 33 pages here (something over 13000words)</p>
<p>Considering that the average reader will read 13,000 words in 43.3 minutes when reading at a speed of 300 words per minute (wpm). Based on your answer, you recommend the players read the terms before they start to play if we consider that you may change them anytime. You are asking players to spend 45 minutes reading before they want to use your website. This is a very big disadvantage if there are casinos where players don't need to read the terms, and these casinos proactively prevent them from ending up in wrong or confusing situations.</p>
<p>Now I want to mention what our safety index means.</p>
<p>The casinos with the highest safety index are those where players don't need to be worried about terms and conditions, and they can entirely focus on playing because these casinos proactively prevent players from situations (like this) where players can be confused and make a wrong decision based on an incorrect assumption.</p>
<p>Because of that, we need to penalize the case, even though the casino acted according to the terms and conditions.</p>
<p>For the casino, I would like to suggest:</p>
<p>The best solution is to cap and convert the bonus money into real one immediately after the wagering. So the players will get right amount of real money right after the bonus wagering is complete.</p>
<p>However, if you insist on withdrawing the bonus monies:</p>
<p>After the wagering, leave the money as bonus money in the player's balance. When the wagering is complete, show a popup to the players where you inform these players that the wagering is complete; however, warn them that they must make a withdrawal to convert the money into real money.</p>
<p>(nice to have - if the player finishes the wagering with an amount lower than the maximum withdrawable amount and decides to play with this amount, show to this player a popup message when he reaches the threshold for the maximum withdrawable amount with a warning that more money is not possible to withdraw.</p>
