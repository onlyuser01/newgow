<p>The famous family-friendly resort in Las Vegas, Nevada, Circus Circus Las Vegas, announced the launch of new lower prices for its entertainment amenities. The venue confirmed on Monday that the lower prices will apply to all of its entertainment offerings, including the recent additions, The Garage, as well as Axe IT Up.</p>
<p>The lucrative promotions will apply to the The Adventuredome Theme Park and Midway as well, providing a variety of entertainment options for the visitors. The announcement about the latest lucrative opportunity comes at a time when the property has undergone an extensive revamp, resulting in significant improvements.</p>
<p>The new lower prices come just in time for Summer. According to a statement released by Circus Circus, the lower prices will be valid starting from July 5, 2023, through Labor Day. The leading entertainment and casino location explained that "park-goers may enjoy 25% off wristbands during "Kids Happy Hour" from Adventuredome opening until 2 p.m. Monday through Friday." For visitors that are not interested in rides, the venue offers a $40 play card at Midway which grants them an additional $10 in play credits for free.</p>
<p>On the other hand, visitors to The Garage, which is next to the Adventuredome, can enjoy unique "Birdly" virtual reality, as well as full-swing video simulators that offer golf, as well as other sports including baseball, soccer and more. Additionally, The Garage offers mini-bowling alleys, delivering another form of entertainment.</p>
<p>The other recent addition at Circus Circus, Axe It Up, brings exciting experiences for people interested in axe throwing. At Axe It Up, visitors can participate in games including standard bullseye and Bottle Crush, Zombie Crush, Tic-Tac-Toe, Duck Hunt, and more. Judging by the recent statement from Circus Circus, this entertainment destination accepts anyone aged 12 and over and rates per person start at $15.</p>
<p>Visitors of Circus Circus can also enjoy the venue's world-famous indoor amusement park, The Adventuredome. The entertainment location offers improved park features and enhancements, including rides for all ages such as El Loco rollercoasters, Canyon Blaster, Sand Pirate, NebulaZ and more. The Adventuredome also offers an 18-hole miniature golf course and a rock-climbing wall, among other amenities.</p>
<p>Shana Gerety, Circus Circus' senior vice president of operations, shared her excitement about the recent announcement. "We're looking forward to providing our guests with a summer full of affordable family fun and entertainment," she said. Finally, Gerety pointed out: "We hope our lower prices will enable guests to enjoy our expanding offerings and various property renovations."</p>
