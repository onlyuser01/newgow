<p>Jake Paul: Bio and Professional Background</p>
<p>Jake Joseph Paul, nicknamed The Problem Child, was born January 17, 1997, in Cleveland, OH. Currently 24, he is a social media influencer and professional boxer. Paul is 6‚Äô1‚Ä≥ tall and has a reach of 76 inches. His current record is 3 wins with 0 losses.</p>
<p>Paul‚Äôs amateur career started in 2018 when he and his brother, Logan Paul, fought Olajide Olayinka Williams ‚ÄúJJ‚Äù Olatunji, also known as KSI, and his brother, Deji Olatunji. Olatunji was defeated by Paul in the fifth round via a technical knockout (TKO).</p>
<p>The Problem Child‚Äôs professional boxing debut was in January 2020. He fought against British YouTuber Ali Loui Al-Fakhri, aka AnEsonGib, in Miami. After 2:18 in the first round, Paul won the fight via TKO. In November that same year, as a part of the Mike Tyson vs Roy Jones Jr. exhibition match, Paul fought Nate Robinson.

<p>From MMA to Boxing: Bio of the Chosen One</p>
<p>Woodley, nicknamed The Chosen One, was born on April 17, 1982. Currently 39, he is 5‚Äô9‚Ä≥ tall and has a reach of 74 inches. Although he doesn‚Äôt have a boxing record, his MMA record is 19-7 with seven knockouts.</p>
<p>It was in 2009 when Woodley started his professional MMA career. Several years later, in 2016, he became the UFC Welterweight Champion. Woodley defended that title four consecutive times, but then in 2019, lost it. In July of this year, ESPN revealed that although the upcoming fight would be Woodley‚Äôs first boxing fight, it certainly won‚Äôt be his last. Preparing for the fight, The Chosen One has been training with Floyd Mayweather Jr., as well as Pedro Diaz and Eric Brown.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, Woodley‚Äôs significant MMA background will come in handy when he faces Paul. On the other hand, The Problem Child is younger than Woodley, which may also impact the result of the fight. Whatever the case is, the Jake Paul vs Tyron Woodley fight on Sunday will be quite exciting.</p>
