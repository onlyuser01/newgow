    <h1>Osage Casino Ponca City Ok Best Atlantic City Casino Casino Games Slot Machines Valley Forge Casino</h1>

<p>Hey Curwyn,</p>
<p>In the years I've been with the casino I've seen the validation process go from a minor inconvenience to a minor hassle, it's true. Every time someone comes up with a new way of getting around things it gets more difficult for everyone ourselves included. As Petronela said, it's done primarily for player security. An account someone can't benefit from is an account not worth bothering with, it's a fairly effective deterrent and we go through great pains to assure the player themselves are the only ones in the whole wide world who can cash out from their account.</p>
<p>The fact that there are excellent reasons behind it doesn't make it any easier to take care of, I'm well aware. Your documents are currently listed as "incomplete" which for all intents and purposes is the same as having none at all. I'm going to go ahead and send you an email from my personal email account and we can work together until we get that money in your pocket, where it belongs.</p>
<p>Your current balance reflects your requested withdrawal amount, go ahead and re-request it and if it gets denied in the interim request it again until you and I get this authorization process sorted for you.</p>
<p>Best wishes, I look forward to working with you, and be sure to check you inbox for my email.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Nick and Slots Garden</p>
