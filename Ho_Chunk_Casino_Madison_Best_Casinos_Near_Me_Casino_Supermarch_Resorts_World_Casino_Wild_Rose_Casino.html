    <h1>Ho Chunk Casino Madison Best Casinos Near Me Casino Supermarch Resorts World Casino Wild Rose Casino</h1>

<p>Dear Dianne,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. Before we’ll contact the casino and ask for their standpoint, could you please forward emails or screenshots showing that you have sent a request for the self-exclusion? My email address is petronela.k@casino.guru. Did you specify in that request for how long you wish your account to be suspended and the reason why?</p>
<p>I have checked the Responsible Gambling section on the website, and this is what I found</p>
<p>https://www.alwaysvegas.eu/en/terms:</p>
<p>„1.13. The player accepts any and all game results shown by the Casino software or website as true. Any disputes regarding the outcome of games played will be decided by results from the game server, and these will determine the final decision of the Casino. If for any reason the player is not totally satisfied with the terms and conditions laid out before them, then the player is within their rights to discontinue playing and remove the software from his/her computer. Furthermore, a player who is unsatisfied with his/her personal gaming experience at the Casino and wishes to close their account, bears responsibly for manually closing or freezing said account from within the Casino software and to remove any software associated with the casino from their computer or mobile devices."</p>
<p>Is this support@alwaysvegasemail.com the email address that you have sent your email to?</p>
<p>I hope we will be able to help you to resolve this issue as soon as possible. Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
