    <h1>Blue Dragon Casino Rancheria Casino Usa Casino Seven Mile Casino In Chula Vista Casinos In New Mexic</h1>

<p>The developer of exceptional slots is looking forward to expanding its presence in the Greek online gambling market</p>
<p>Leading provider of iGaming content Spinomenal has unveiled a new content partnership with Betshop.gr, a Greek operator of casino gaming and online sports betting. Under the agreement, Spinomenal will supply its new ally with exciting and flashy games.</p>
<p>The content will be integrated into Betshop’s offering through Light &amp; Wonder’s OpenGaming aggregation platform. As a result, Greek players will get to play Spinomenal’s well-designed games that sport engaging features and remarkable graphics.</p>
<p>Some of the hit titles that will make it into Betshop’s platform include popular games such as Majestic King, Book of Demi Gods II, Book of Rebirth, Wolf Fang and Poseidon’s Rising. Greek iGaming enthusiasts will be able to access the revolutionary Spinomenal Universe series and immerse themselves in fantastic fictional universes full of well-known characters.</p>
<p>The deal will solidify Spinomenal’s footprint in Greece. The company already has a presence in the region, having previously signed an agreement with the local operator Stoiximan.</p>
<p>Betshop Is Happy to Expand Its Offering</p>
<p>Lior Shvartz, Spinomenal’s chief executive officer, commented on the agreement with Betshop, saying that the company is looking forward to growing stronger in the country. He said that his team is looking forward to seeing how Greek players react to the new additions.</p>
<p>We pride ourselves on creating a portfolio rich with immersive titles and we cannot wait to bring these to Betshop’s casino players. Lior Shvartz, CEO, Spinomenal</p>
<p>Massimiliano Cerfoglia, Betshop’s chief product officer, also commented on the matter, saying that his team is delighted to welcome Spinomenal to the Betshop family. He believes that the provider’s content will be a great addition to the operator’s selection of games.</p>
<p>The addition of these masterfully designed titles will undoubtedly enhance our players’ gaming experience. At Betshop, we strive to offer top-notch entertainment, and this collaboration aligns perfectly with our commitment to providing a diverse and immersive gaming environment. We look forward to a successful partnership with Spinomenal. Massimiliano Cerfoglia, CPO, Betshop</p>
<p>In April, Spinomenal further expanded its list of partners, inking a partnership deal with Betsson. The high-quality slots provider powered the operator with games such as Book of Demi Gods 2, Queen of Ice, Book of Rebirth and Majestic King, among others. In February, Spinomenal also agreed to support ELA Games’ new slot project.</p>
<p>Betshop, on the other hand, onboarded titles from ESA Gaming thanks to an agreement it signed in September 2022. The move helped the company enrich its offering, providing fans with a vast selection of games.</p>
