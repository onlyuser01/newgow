    <h1>Deposit Bonus Online Casinos Central City Colorado Casinos Riverside Casino Laughlin Lake Tahoe Casi</h1>

<p>On July 19th, I requested a withdrawal for $3,000. However, due to withdrawal limits, I had to break my withdrawal into two parts. I requested one for $2,000 via Coindraw, which was purported to be the fastest withdrawal. Then the remaining $1,000 I submitted as a Bitcoin withdrawal request. I reached out to the customer service team several times after July 19th, requesting any updates on when I could expect my payout. Initially, I was told 3-5 days for the Coindraw withdrawal, and then 14-17 business days later for the Bitcoin withdrawal. After 3 days, the customer service team started telling me that Coindraw was undergoing corrective maintenance, delaying my payout for a few days.</p>
<p>Then on July 26th, I received the attached letter from the payouts department, saying that Coindraw was down, that my withdrawal request was canceled, and to please re-request it via Bitcoin. So I canceled the Bitcoin withdrawal request as well, and submitted a Bitcoin withdrawal request for $2,500.</p>
<p>I reached out to Customer Service, asking them when I could expect it, and attached the letter I had received. I was told that it would take 7 business days to be approved, and another 7-10 business days for payout.</p>
<p>On the 7th business day, I saw that the payout was approved. Customer service again said that it would take 7-10 business days for the payout to be sent.</p>
<p>On the 7th business day, I asked if I would receive the payout, and was told "no, but keep waiting until the 10th business day before escalating." Same response on the 8th day and the 9th day.</p>
<p>On the 10th business day, which was Thursday, August 17th, I again asked if I could expect payout that day. I was told that it would be escalated, and that I would receive an update in 24-48 hours. I clarified that it was "calendar hours," and not "business hours." This was confirmed, meaning that I would get an answer sometime between Friday and Saturday, the 18th and 19th of August.</p>
<p>On the 18th of August, after 24 hours had elapsed, I asked for an update, and was told that I would have an update 48 hours after the escalation. So I reached out again on Saturday, after 48 hours, and was told that I would receive an update within 2-3 business days of the escalation, not 48 hours.</p>
<p>On the 3rd business day after the case was escalated which was Tuesday, August 22nd, I again reached out. I was told there's no update yet, but I would receive an email once there's an update on the escalation. I was reassured that I would receive my winnings, and that I just had to wait longer.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, I was told that on Tuesday my payout had been marked for payment, and that it usually takes 24-48 hours to receive the funds once it is so marked. This would have indicated a payout on Thursday, August 24th. Instead, I was again told that I would have to wait longer.</p>
<p>During this, I had some communication with the payouts team via email. In each of the emails, I got the same message: It's been sent to a 3rd party vendor for payment, and they are delayed. We can't tell you who the vendor is for security reasons, we can't tell you when to expect payment. Just have to keep waiting.</p>
<p>I've received essentially the same email from the payouts team each time I reach back out to them.</p>
<p>I've attached all communication I have saved, including a few of the customer service chats that I remembered to email to myself, and the emails I've received from the payouts team.</p>
<p>Today, August 31st, is the 20th business day and the 28th calendar day since my withdrawal request was approved, and only 30 minutes ago did I get the "please keep waiting" email from the payouts team.</p>
