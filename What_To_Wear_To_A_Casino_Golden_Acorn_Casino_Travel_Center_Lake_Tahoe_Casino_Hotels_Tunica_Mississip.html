    <h1>What To Wear To A Casino Golden Acorn Casino Travel Center Lake Tahoe Casino Hotels Tunica Mississip</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Here Bet365 was deposited on May 11, 2021, two deposits of 2000 pesos at the same coupon of 2000 pesos. A total of 4000 pesos was deposited through OXXO. That same day I communicated with them via chat and they told me that there was no problem, that I would scan the bauchers and send them to the email they provided me. I did it immediately. I received an email confirming receipt. A few days passed, nothing was credited to my account. I contacted them again via chat. Apart from the fact that they have me waiting to check everything that happened, they ask me the same questions again, they end up asking me the same thing to send the scanned bauchers to the same email so that the corresponding department is in charge of solving the problem and they are sent again . This last time the same thing happened, I contacted them, after waiting for them to review all the information and they asked me to do exactly the same, and I do the same every time, but they do not solve anything. This account was opened because they accepted OXXO as a means of deposit. This last time the excuse they gave me was that as it was SPEI there was some detail and so they were doing me the favor of seeing where that money was left. What is not clear to me is that they are the ones suggested by the establishments for deposit. They are supposed to be safe or endorsed by them that is why they are on their page. OXXO fits me and that's why the account was opened. We have been waiting for more than 20 days for them to resolve this issue and to give me this money and they do not give me a solution. This is my complaint. Thanks</p>
