<p>In light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the annual Global Gaming Expo Asia was postponed to 2022. Organizers of the event which was planned for this November revealed that G2E Asia will return in August 2022.</p>
<p>G2E Asia Postponed to August 2022</p>
<p>The first time when the Global Gaming Expo (G2E) Asia was held was back in 2007. Since then, the event has been organized annually in Macau as a trade fair showing the latest of the casino industry. Unfortunately, due to the global COVID-19 pandemic, G2E Asia was last held in 2019 in person.</p>
<p>This year’s G2E Asia was planned for May. However, due to the ongoing pandemic, the event was postponed. While it had to take place between November 9 and November 11, now, G2E Asia was postponed once again.</p>
<p>“Global Gaming Expo (G2E) Asia – the marketplace for the Asian gaming and integrated resort industry – will return to the Venetian Macao, from August 30 – September 1, 2022,” reads a statement released by G2E Asia Team</p>
<p>In a statement to visitors, partners and exhibitors released on Monday this week, the organizers of the event said that it will return in August next year. G2E Asia’s new dates are set from August 30 through September 1, 2022. As usual, the event is planned to take place at the Venetian Macau.</p>
<p>According to the organizers, one of the main reasons behind postponing the 2021 event is the COVID-related disruptions. Moreover, the organizers acknowledged that travel restrictions continue to be in place across the Asia Pacific.</p>
<p>“Thank you for your continued support of G2E Asia and we look forward to seeing you in 2022,” said G2E Asia Team</p>
<p>Last but not least, the G2E Asia team said that this year’s edition was shifted to 2022 to ensure the high expectations of the show are met. Besides announcing the change for this year’s event, the organizers have placed a countdown timer, showing how many days, hours and minutes are remaining until G2E Asia 2022.</p>
<p>Vaccination in Macau Continues</p>
<p>According to data released by Reuters COVID-19 tracker, so far, Macau has recorded 77 COVID infections and 0 COVID-related deaths since the start of the pandemic. Focusing on the COVID-19 vaccination, Macau has administered at least 739,977 vaccine doses. If every person has received 2 vaccine doses, the administered doses would be enough to vaccinate 57.8% of the population. However, this data doesn’t confirm how many people have received two COVID-19 doses.</p>
<p>Looking at recent vaccinations, we see that Macau has administered an average of 4,259 doses each day last week. If that vaccination rate continues, 31 days would be needed to vaccinate another 10% of the population.</p>
