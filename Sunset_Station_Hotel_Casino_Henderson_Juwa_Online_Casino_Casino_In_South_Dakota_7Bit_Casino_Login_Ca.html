<p>The first fully immersive betting and transactional platform, SB22, expanded further its global presence after announcing a new deal. Earlier this week, the company confirmed it signed a new partnership with Puerto Rico-based sports betting potential operator, ZingSports.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the new deal, customers of the operator in Puerto Rico will tap into different sports betting options such as free-to-play, as well as real-money wagering. Still, it's important to mention that those options are subject to the relevant licensing and regulatory approvals that are pending.</p>
<p>Thanks to the new deal, ZingSports is expected to benefit from accessing an innovative sports betting platform that offers state-of-the-art features such as a Player Account Management (PAM) solution that is built in. Additionally, the platform has AI-driven promotional capabilities which help deliver unique and engaging experiences for the customers.</p>
<p>Besides the platform, the deal is expected to deliver different sports betting options for ZingSports customers. Such offers would include soccer, football, baseball and basketball, among other popular sports. This is further complemented by a variety of markets such as player props and in-play wagering options.</p>
<p>Vladimir Jovanovic, SB22's Chief Operating Officer, shared his excitement about the deal in a statement saying: "ZingSports is an ideal partner and has a lot of creative ideas for fan engagement and acquisition. " Finally, he pointed out: "We are looking forward to combining their ideas with our technology and showcasing our collective efforts."</p>
<p>Vik Shrestha, SB22's Chief Commercial Officer, shared the excitement of Jovanovic saying that the company is delighted to ink this new partnership with ZingSports which will help deliver the company's leading technology and solutions to customers in Puerto Rico. "Our goal is to provide the best possible experience for sports betting fans in the region," said Shrestha in conclusion.</p>
<p>The deal with SB22 brought excitement for ZingSports as well, judging by the comment of the company's CEO, Jerry Foley, who said: "We are thrilled to partner with SB22 and launch a modern and differentiated sports betting offering in Puerto Rico." In conclusion, the CEO said that the partnership will enable the company to deliver supreme sports betting experiences for its customers.</p>
<p>Details of the new partnership come after last week, SB22 announced it hired the services of Keith Wall. The former Vice President of Sports Betting Commercial at FanDuel joined the company as its new strategic advisor. Overall, Wall brings more than 15 years of experience and is expected to deliver strategic guidance for SB22 in his new role.</p>
