<p>Flutter Entertainment is introducing Nancy Dubuc and Holly Koeppel in non-executive roles to boost gender and diversity.</p>
<p>Koeppel and Dubuc to Step in Non-Executive Roles</p>
<p>Flutter Entertainment continues to work on its diversity and gender balance by bringing Nancy Dubuc and Holly Koeppel in non-executive director roles on April 29 and May 13, respectively. Koeppel and Dubuc will be replacing now outgoing Divyesh Gadhia and Peter Rigby.</p>
<p>Dubuc is a well-seasoned media veteran with ties to A&amp;E Networks, where she served as chief executive and shaped most of her career between 1999 and 2018. She is also the current CEO of Vice Media Group.</p>
<p>Koeppel is employed with British American Tobacco, AES Corporation, and Arch Resources in non-executive positions. She previously served at American Electric Power. Koeppel also holds a non-executive position at Vesuvius that she will be leaving on May 12.</p>
<p>Flutter Entertainment has stayed ahead of events realizing the need for a more diverse and merit-based workplace. After the merger with The Stars Group (TSG) in 2020, this process has become only stronger.</p>
<p>Company chairman Gary McGann has said that Flutter already has an actionable board renewal program it’s putting in practice. Dubuc and Koeppel’s enrolment is part of that strategy, McGann said, and Flutter was looking forward to seeing them join.</p>
<p>Gadhia and Rigby Helped Establish Brands</p>
<p>As to the departing executives, McGann expressed his gratitude to Gadhia and Rigby, who both had been instrumental in managing the company’s brands and assisting on various levels to help polish them to perfection.</p>
<p>Their legacy lives on, McGann added. Rigby was particularly involved with Paddy Power and Betfair and shaped much of those two brands’ identity during his seven-year stint. His contributions to the Risk Committee and then the Remuneration Committee were spot-on, McGann explained.</p>
<p>Flutter Entertainment has been busy of late. The company has reiterated its commitment to responsible gambling by suspending credit card payments in Ireland. Just at the final stretch of last year, Flutter secured the buyout of a $4.2 billion stake buyout from FanDuel.</p>
