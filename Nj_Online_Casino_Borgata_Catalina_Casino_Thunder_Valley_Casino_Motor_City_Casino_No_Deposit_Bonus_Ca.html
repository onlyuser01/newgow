<p>The launch of proprietary iCasino builds up on the success of Hard Rock Digital’s sportsbook</p>
<p>Hard Rock Digital’s acclaimed Hard Rock Bet app is now live in New Jersey, allowing local players to experience unforgettable gaming experiences. According to the announcement, the app’s features will also improve the experience of visitors of Hard Rock’s land-based properties in the state.</p>
<p>Hard Rock Bet is a platform that is available to both desktop and mobile users. The latter can also download a dedicated app available on Android and iOS. Hard Rock Bet notably boasts intuitive UI and fast payouts, ensuring frictionless experiences for the players.</p>
<p>Hard Rock Bet integrates multiple online casino offerings, an online sportsbook and a loyalty program. In addition to allowing customers to play digitally, the new app is designed to improve the experience for existing Hard Rock enthusiasts and visitors of the Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino in Atlantic City.</p>
<p>Hard Rock’s new app will inaugurate the company’s proprietary online casino, building up on the success of its proprietary online sportsbook. For reference, the Hard Rock Bet sportsbook is already available to players in Arizona, Indiana, Ohio, Tennessee, and Virginia.</p>
<p>Last but not least, Hard Rock Bet users will enjoy an enhanced Loyalty Rewards experience, allowing them to accumulate points and credits and exchange them for rewards. The online program will be synchronized with Hard Rock’s land-based rewards programs, where possible.</p>
<p>An Important Milestone for Hard Rock</p>
<p>Hard Rock Digital’s chief executive officer, Marlon Goldstein, commented on the launch, calling it an “important milestone” for the company. He praised the launch of Hard Rock’s proprietary iCasino, saying that his team is very proud of its in-house online casino and sportsbook.</p>
<p>We are incredibly proud of these proprietary products and are excited to bring this elevated experience to New Jersey to entertain our players like no one else can. Marlon Goldstein, CEO, Hard Rock Digital</p>
<p>Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino AC’s president, George Goldhoff, also commented on the matter. He welcomed Hard Rock Bet to the Garden State, saying that it will provide guests with an upgraded gaming experience.</p>
<p>This new platform will allow us to better engage, entertain, and reward our guests with a best-in-class experience however and whenever they play. George Goldhoff, president, Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino Atlantic City</p>
<p>A few days ago, on the other hand, Hard Rock opened a new Rocksino property in South Dakota. In the meantime, the company prepares to launch its Rockford property in 2024. Further expanding its international presence, the company is also working on the construction of its first venue in Canada.</p>
