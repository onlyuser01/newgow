    <h1>Casino Machine Mandalay Bay Resort Casino Swinomish Casino Lodge Free Casino Game Casinos In Deadwoo</h1>

<p>The complaint was reopen based on the player's e-mail:</p>
<p>"Hello Nick, I apologize for not responding sooner but I just received the email conformation. to answer your questions the documents uploaded and verified were a proof of identification- age majority card accepted and verified Oct 28, 2022, proof of address verified and accepted Oct 28, 2022, and proof of deposit (I had to prove the account and deposit were mine and from my account) verified and accepted Oct 282022. after I did everything, they asked they then needed a real time selfie of me holding up my identification to allegedly prove its me despite me verifying everything I after a lot of hesitation provided this selfie on Nov 3, 2022, and it was verified that same day. I spoke to the live chat representative on that day and that's when they claim that I had multiple accounts that was the new issue. They claim even if I only have one account in my name if someone else uses the same IP address or device to log into their own account (which no one has because I know literally NO ONE that uses this specific casino and I had already proven to them that everything was registered in my name and verified by their team) even if someone uses the same Wi-Fi IP its classed as a duplicate account. I spoke to them last on Nov 3, 2022, and that's what I got .... Its honestly bullshit my current account balance is $123237.52 CAD all my winning were done by an actual real money deposit and LITERALLY NO BONUS WAS EVER USED ACCEPTED OR REDEEMED ... What do I do? What can I do?"</p>
