<p>The company confirmed it secured online sports betting market access deals in Pennsylvania, Kentucky and Colorado, along with iGaming market access in Pennsylvania</p>
<p>The fast-growing sports gaming and sports media company, Betr, announced ambitious plans for the year ahead. Today, the company confirmed it anticipates expanding across the United States after securing several sports betting market access agreements.</p>
<p>Betr’s beta product, referred to by the company’s co-founder Joey Levy as V0, is currently live in Ohio, Massachusetts and Virginia. However, the leading betting company said that it plans to roll out V1 of its Sportsbook product in several states ahead of the start of the 2024 NFL season.</p>
<p>The ambitious plans for expansion in the sports betting sector across the US include launches in Pennsylvania, Kentucky and Colorado, three states where the company secured market access for its sportsbook. Additionally, in Pennsylvania, Betr secured iGaming market access, paving the way for its first launch within the online casino sector.</p>
<p>In a statement, Betr confirmed it joined forces with Cordish Gaming Group, securing market access to the iGaming vertical in the state. Still, it’s important to note that prior to launching Betr Casino in Pennsylvania, the company needs to secure approval from the state’s gambling regulator.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Betr’s online sports betting market access to Kentucky was facilitated via a deal with the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians. Previously, the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians acquired a stake in Betr which has increased.</p>
<p>Finally, teaming up with Boulter Developments granted Betr access to the online sports betting market in Colorado. Similar to the previous market access agreement, this one is also subject to approval from the gambling regulator, the Colorado Division of Gaming.</p>
<p>An Exciting Year Ahead for the Company</p>
<p>Joey Levy, Betr’s CEO and founder, revealed that there are exciting times ahead for the company considering the upcoming launch of its V1 Sportsbook and Betr Casino, planned for this year. He also spoke about Betr Picks, the company’s leading real money fantasy sports product.</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to announce our new market access partnerships for Sportsbook and the introduction of Betr Casino in 2024 ahead of our V1 Sportsbook launch.“ Joey Levy, founder and CEO of Betr</p>
<p>Ahead of the 2023 NFL season, Betr rolled out Betr Picks which is now live in more than 20 different states. “Through the success of Betr Picks, we have validated that our playbook of simpler and more intuitive user experiences built for casual fans on the product front, and original short form video built for the next generation of sports fans on social media on the distribution front, are winning strategies for rapidly and efficiently scaling a new real money gaming business in the US,” explained Levy.</p>
<p>He outlined that the company anticipates replicating the success of Betr Picks for its Betr Casino and Betr Sportsbook throughout 2024 and beyond. Finally, Levy said Betr expects to have a solid foundation for four separate business units, including Betr Sportsbook, Betr Casino, Betr Fantasy and Betr Media by the end of the year.</p>
