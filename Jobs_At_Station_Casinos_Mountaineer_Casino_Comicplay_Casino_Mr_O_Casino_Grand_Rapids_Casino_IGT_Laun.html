<p>International Game Technology (IGT)’s acclaimed Wheel of Fortune has now rolled out the first branded casino in New Jersey</p>
<p>IGT and BetMGM have set up the Wheel of Fortune Online Casino in the Garden State to provide fresh experiences that pivot around a familiar game and experience.</p>
<p>Spin the Wheel in a Dedicated Branded Casino</p>
<p>Commenting on this new opportunity, BetMGM CEO Adam Greenblatt said he was excited to see the Wheel of Fortune Online Casino arrive in the New Jersey market and offer novel real money experiences built around a beloved and player-favorite game.</p>
<p>Greenblatt didn’t miss to mention that the new casino will be one-hundred per cent mobile compatible making it an easy and fun experience across the board, saying:</p>
<p>We have a great alliance with Wheel of Fortune and IGT and look forward to offering our players innovative and diverse selections of gaming options. BetMGM CEO Adam Greenblatt</p>
<p>The news was naturally welcomed by Sony Pictures Television EVP of game shows Suzanne Prete who was excited to see the Wheel of Fortune reinvented in so many ways, not least – through IGT’s dedicated slot series.</p>
<p>Now we’re excited to see BetMGM build on that success and take an innovative approach to bring the game to more players by launching the brand’s first online casino in the US. Sony Pictures Television EVP of game shows Suzanne Prete</p>
<p>IGT CEO digital &amp; betting Enrico Drago was similarly excited to see a brand new casino dedicated to the Wheel of Fortune slots launch on one of the biggest iGaming markets in the United States. Drago thanked BetMGM for the opportunity to team up and work together on this new chapter of the game franchise’s evolution which brings it to players in a fresh and exciting way.</p>
<p>Now, players have access to a dedicated casino where they get to enjoy their favorite Wheel of Fortune slots games, and this is great, Drago concluded. In the meantime, the land-based versions of Wheel of Fortunes have been making people rich, with regular players winning seven-figure prize pools across the country.</p>
<p>On its own, Wheel of Fortune is an impressive brand. It has earned seven Emmy Awards and a Daytime Emmy for Outstanding Game/Audience Participation Show. The game is produced by Sony Pictures Television, a Sony Pictures Entertainment Company, and it has proved overwhelmingly popular with land-based and online casino players as well as with TV audiences across the United States.</p>
