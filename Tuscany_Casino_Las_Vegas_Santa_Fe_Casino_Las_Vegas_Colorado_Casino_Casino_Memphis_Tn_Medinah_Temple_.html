<p>The casino and sportsbook B2B platform supplier Soft2Bet has been approved by the Danish gambling regulator and will receive a license, enabling it to supply operators in the local market.</p>
<p>Soft2Bet Is Approved for Demark Launch</p>
<p>The supplier license will permit Soft2Bet to power betting companies in Denmark with its rich suite of various slots games, poker, blackjack, bingo and roulette, among others. Furthermore, Soft2Bet will be allowed to provide local operators with its proprietary sports betting platform.</p>
<p>Soft2Bet spokespeople explained that entering the Danish market is the first step of many toward the provider’s goals of expanding across the world. The company envisions scaling its business up and launching its offerings in various key regulated markets.</p>
<p>The current move reinforces Soft2Bet’s presence in Northern Europe. The supplier already has a pre-existing license to offer its products in Sweden. Soft2Bet secured this license in 2019 and will likely continue to establish a strong foothold in the region.</p>
<p>The Company Says This is a Monumental Milestone</p>
<p>Peter Christian Noer, the head of country team for Soft2Bet, spoke extensively about the Denmark launch and the company’s vision for the future.</p>
<p>For Noer, the license acquisition is a “monumental moment” for the supplier. He pointed that this is a key point in Soft2Bet’s history since the Danish regulator is known as one of the strictest ones out there. In Noer’s words, the approval attests to the huge amounts of effort put in by the team and the company’s devotion to meeting all the deadlines and requirements. Noer is thankful for everyone’s hard work and is delighted to have achieved this key milestone.</p>
<p>Since Soft2Bet’s offerings are already faring good in Sweden and have been doing well for the past two years, Noer is convinced that the company will be able to replicate the same success in the Danish market.</p>
<p>Speaking about what the company has planned next, Noer explained:</p>
<p>“We now look forward to launching our innovative iGaming brands on the Danish market that have proven successful in other jurisdictions because of their state-of-the-art features, unique game supply, and strong player protection tools.” Soft2bet head of country team Peter Christian Noer,</p>
<p>Noer concluded by once again thanking his team for its uncompromising dedication in achieving this great milestone. He said that everyone should be proud of what they’ve achieved together. Noer also used the opportunity to thank the Danish regulator for its patience, positivity and willingness to help Soft2Bet out in its quest to get a supplier’s license.</p>
<p>In mid-2021 Soft2Bet managed to acquire two Maltese gaming licenses for two of its subsidiary brands – YoyoCasino and Campobet.</p>
