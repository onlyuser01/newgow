    <h1>Silver Legacy Resort Casino Reno Nv Bally Casino Best Casino In Colorado The Linq Hotel Casino Vegas</h1>

<p>To whom it may concern.</p>
<p>Hi there.</p>
<p>I am exceptionally disgusted with Rich Casino at the moment. I have been a loyal customer up until now; but after my experience this evening, I would no longer like anything to do with them.</p>
<p>On Sunday, 16 August, I made a deposit of R350 - which qualified me for 7 days worth of rewards, known as Road to Rome. Upon depositing, I noticed that my balance was not R350, but R338.47 and I had not played. (please see evidence of deposit and game history attached).</p>
<p>I was told to not play until the issue was resolved and would be reimbursed for any rewards missed. I then contacted the live chat to see how far the process was as I would like to play. I was then addressed by someone named Dan - the rudest assistant I've ever come across.</p>
<p>He did not understand what my concern was and when I asked him to put me through to someone else, he said no and have terrible attitude. This completely put me off of the site entirely. When I mentioned Casino Guru and how I'd be complaining, he couldn't have cared less. Besides the issue of my deposit, I would like Dan to be personally dealt with to prevent this type of unacceptable treatment in the future.</p>
<p>Although R350 is not far off from R338.47, it is the concept. I have now lost that, as well as my rewards and cashback! Not to mention the pathetic service.</p>
<p>I have also attached screenshots of the conversation between myself and Dan.</p>
<p>I hope this matter with be resolved as quickly as possible. Thank you for your time. I appreciate you.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Friendly Gambler</p>
