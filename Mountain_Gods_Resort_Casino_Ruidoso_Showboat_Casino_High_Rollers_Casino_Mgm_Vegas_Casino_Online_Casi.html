<p>The supplier of leading odds for the esports vertical has invested further into its recently expanded Trading Hub in Lima, Peru as it pursues further growth in the competitive video gaming vertical</p>
<p>Oddin.gg has decided to spend more on its Trading Hub as it envisages greater demand for the esports betting product and odds it offers, with coverage of events in the Western Hemisphere growing significantly. The investment further reflects the growing demand from specific regions, such as the United States, Canada, and Latin America as a whole.</p>
<p>Oddin.gg Doubles Down on North American and Latin American Expansion</p>
<p>The company sees the expansion of its Trading Hub as a way to bring greater efficiencies and close the gap in time differences to European time zones. The Trading Hub in Peru will support the European Trading team. There are 50 traders who cover more than 15 competitive gaming titles, including Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, League of Legends, Call of Duty, Dota 2, Valorant, and many others.</p>
<p>Oddin.gg has been growing its presence globally at a strong pace with the company teaming up with more bookmakers that have been keen to continue expanding and growing their presence in the esports vertical, bringing tighter and more robust coverage of esports events and tournaments globally, and with an increased focus on the Latin American and North American markets.</p>
<p>Oddin.gg CEO Vlastimil Venclík has hailed the opportunity to further strengthen the trading capacities of the company and commented:</p>
<p>We see tremendous interest in esports betting in the United States, Canada, and Latin America as evidenced by our recent visits to events in Las Vegas, San Diego, New York, and Buenos Aires. This reaffirms our decision to expand into the American time zone and educate the market about betting on esports. Oddin.gg CEO Vlastimil Venclík</p>
<p>Oddin.gg Enjoys Commercial Success as Esports Betting Interest Grows</p>
<p>The executive was confident that the new office in Lima, along with the continued investment, will allow the company to realize its long-term goal to expand its product offering in the United States, Canada, and Latin America.</p>
<p>Presently, Oddin.gg collaborates with more than 250 brands and provides a comprehensive esports betting product that features odds.
