<p>Oscar Rivas and Ryan Rozicki: A Fair Fight or a One-Sided Bout?</p>
<p>Taking a look at the odds you may almost think that there is not much reason to back Rozicki or even tune in to watch. Posted as the heavy underdog at (+500) his chances of success are marginal. That is if you look at Rozicki in terms of his career relative to Rivas, but what about Rozicki the fighter?</p>
<p>Rozicki is a cruiserweight fighter who will be taking on a heavyweight and this is definitely something we ought to mention here. Yet, the Bridgerweight champion is decided to add to his titles and take on a worthy challenger.</p>
<p>Rozicki is young and he has claimed the WBC International Silver and the NABA Canadian cruiserweight titles in his career so far. He is an impressive fighter precisely because he has never lost in his professional career so far, making him a promising boxing prospect.</p>
<p>He is sitting at 13-0 and has clocked in 13 knockouts as opposed to Rivas’ 19 out of 27 victories and a single loss as a matter of fact. Then again, Rivas’ single loss was to Dillian Whyte, a legend by himself.</p>

<p>Oscar Rivas vs Ryan Rozicki Pick</p>
<p>It will be a real stretch betting on the underdog here with his (+500). However, this is precisely what we think is going to happen. Rozicki has no intention of slowing down and he has repeatedly proven his worth. Sporting 13 KOs to his name he will give Rivas a good run for his money. Put simply, Rivas cannot let Rozicki punch him.</p>
<p>Rozicki is also well-versed in fighting super heavyweights back in his amateur years and while not every fight was a win he is trained to take on professional boxers in this category. We definitely want to see him as the WBC Bridgerweight world champion, a first in the history of the game.</p>
<p>We don’t think the fight will go the distance, though, and believe Rozicki will bring it home with another T/KO.</p>
