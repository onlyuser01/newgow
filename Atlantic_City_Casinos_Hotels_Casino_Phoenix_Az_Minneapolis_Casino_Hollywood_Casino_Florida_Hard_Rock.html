<p>For another year in a row, Scientific Games is joining its industry peers in a campaign to raise awareness about the risks of child lottery play and to discourage adults from giving lottery tickets as presents to the underaged.</p>
<p>Lottery Play Poses a Threat to Children, a Research Finds Out</p>
<p>Gaming and lottery supplier Scientific Games will take part for the third consecutive year in the “Gift Responsibly. Lottery Tickets Aren’t Child’s Play” holiday campaign initiated by the National Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG). The campaign aims to educate the public about the risks of children engaging in lottery play during the holiday season.</p>
<p>Scientific Games has been participating in the initiative since 2018 together with Canadian, US, and international lotteries, as well as other non-lottery organizations and members of the NCPG. The North American Association of State and Provincial Lotteries (NASPL) and the World Lottery Association (WLA) have shown their support for the campaign.</p>
<p>“The Responsible Gambling Holiday Lottery Campaign educates communities that lottery tickets, the form of gambling with the broadest participation, are not child’s play.” Keith Whyte, Executive Director, NCPG</p>
<p>“Gift Responsibly. Lottery Tickets Aren’t Child’s Play” has been running every December since 2002 and was created by the National Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG) and the International Centre for Youth Gambling Problems and High-Risk Behaviors at McGill University in Canada following research, which showed that early childhood gambling experiences can be harmful to the individual.</p>
<p>Carla Schaefer, vice president responsible for gaming for Scientific Games, is at the forefront of the company’s strategy to popularise responsible lottery gaming. Schaefer is in close cooperation with Lottery Group stakeholders to work on products and programs that promote healthy lottery play. According to Schaefer, social responsibility, integrity, and transparency are at the core of the company’s business strategy. She adds that lottery games are created to be played by adults and prompts everyone to share this message at all times.</p>
<p>“The Responsible Gambling Holiday Lottery Campaign is a great way to encourage responsible gambling by gifting lottery tickets responsibly only to adults.” Jeffrey Derevensky, Director of the International Centre for Youth Gambling Problems and High-Risk Behaviors</p>
<p>Genius Sports and Scientific Games Enter in Data Partnership</p>
<p>Scientific Games Corporation recently announced its agreement with Genius Sports Group, under which Scientific Games would be able to provide its customers with access to Genius Sports Group’s official data for over 170,000 events each year through the OpenSportsTM platform.</p>
<p>As part of the deal, users will now be able to take advantage of content from the English Premier League (EPL), NASCAR, Italian Serie A and German Bundesliga, and also of FIBA basketball and FIVB volleyball leagues.</p>
