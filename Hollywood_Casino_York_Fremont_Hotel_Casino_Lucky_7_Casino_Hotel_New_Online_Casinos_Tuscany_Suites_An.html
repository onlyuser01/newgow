    <h1>Hollywood Casino York Fremont Hotel Casino Lucky 7 Casino Hotel New Online Casinos Tuscany Suites An</h1>

<p>Hei</p>
<p>I have a big problem and i hope you can help me out somehow. I want to make a complaint but johnvegas casino is not on the list. However- A few days ago i played at john vegas casino. I deposited 2 times. The second time without using a bonus. I was lucky and won 700€. Someone tried to hack me and had suddenly access to my email adress. In another casino the hacker played my balance to zero. I was shocked, tried to change every password etc. However i wrote to john vegas casino if they could limit or close my account because i was scared to loose my money. They did. I had not verified at this point, it was my first time playing there. I contacted the casino and they told me to send all the documents. I did. Then they asked me if I want to reopen my account or if they should proceed with the winnings and when this is done i can still reopen. I said i would like to have my winnings first. They told me thats not a problem. I gave them bank dates too and today i recived a 100€ payment. I didnt understand why i only got 100€. So i wrote live chat again. They told me that they wont reopen my account and keep winnings. I just got my deposit back.</p>
<p>However it doesnt went how they said they will do it. I am very frustrated because i really need this money.</p>
<p>Does someone know what i can do? I have every email they send me where they told me to get my winnings without any problem</p>
