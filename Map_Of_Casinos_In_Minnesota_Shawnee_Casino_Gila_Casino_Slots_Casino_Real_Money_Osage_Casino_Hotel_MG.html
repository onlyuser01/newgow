<p>MGM Resorts International continues with its step by step re-opening of its gaming properties across the states, as the casino operator announced today it will resume operations at MGM National Harbor in Maryland June 29, followed by the re-opening of Borgata Hotel Casino &amp; Spa in Atlantic City a week later, July 6.</p>
<p>MGM National Harbor</p>
<p>MGM National Harbor, the luxury resort and casino located in the heart of the nation’s Capital Region, will re-open on Monday, June 29, after it had been shut down for more than 3 months amid the ongoing health crisis and the coordinated effort to curb the virus spread.</p>
<p>Ahead of the public re-opening, there will be a hosted, invitation-only event at the property located across the Potomac River from Washington D.C., MGM pointed out in the announcement. The casino resort’s amenity offerings will be limited at the beginning as the casino operator is planning on opening additional venues further down the road.</p>
<p>“As we enter this next phase, we are proud and excited to begin getting our employees back to work and to continue working with our local business partners. The health and safety of our guests and employees is our top priority as we plan for our reopening, and we look forward to welcoming everyone back for some much-needed entertainment.” Jorge Perez, President, MGM National Harbor, Regional Portfolio President, MGM Resorts</p>
<p>MGM Borgata Hotel Casino &amp; Spa</p>
<p>MGM’s Borgata Casino resort in Atlantic City will re-open for guests a week later, despite casinos in New Jersey being allowed by St. Gov. Phil Murphy to get back to business effective July 2, two days before the July 4 celebrations. Much alike in the re-opening of its gaming property in Maryland, MGM will host an invitation-only event at Borgata, prior to the re-opening for the general public.</p>
<p>“We are proud to be part of this resilient community that has remained strong and caring during these challenging months. When we reopen our doors, we do so with excitement to welcome back our employees and guests, and with an unwavering commitment to their health and safety. Summer is a special time in Atlantic City, and we look forward to playing a part in offering some much-needed entertainment.” Melonie Johnson, President, Borgata Hotel Casino &amp; Spa</p>
<p>Borgata will also not have all of the resort’s amenities open from the beginning, as restaurants and other non-gaming areas are scheduled to be phased in over the next few weeks, when there is more clarity as to how business levels and health and safety regulations effectiveness are unfolding.</p>
<p>So far MGM Resorts re-opened 5 Las Vegas properties, with one in Mississippi and one in Ohio scheduled for July 1 restart. There is no clarity regarding when MGM Springfield in Massachusetts and Empire City Casino in New York will also resume operations. In all the gaming and hospitality properties the casino operator re-opened, MGM’s 7-Point Safety Plan is strictly being followed.</p>
