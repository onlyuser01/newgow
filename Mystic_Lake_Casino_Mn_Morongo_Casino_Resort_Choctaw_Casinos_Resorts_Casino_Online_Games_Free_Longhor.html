<p>Sportzcast’s unique scoreboard sports data system will now reinforce Genius Sports US and global data offering as part of an acquisition deal struck between the two companies.</p>
<p>Genius Sports’ Acquisition of Sportzcast Opens Access to Scorebot</p>
<p>Genius Sports is going to acquire Sportzcast Inc, a US-based supplier of scoreboard data systems, the company announced on Monday.</p>
<p>The financial details of the agreement have not been revealed, but Genius will now move in control of Sportzcast, the company’s assets and intellectual property (IP) products, and become the operator of the ‘Scorebot’ solution.</p>
<p>Scorebot is a solution that empowers intuitive sports betting solution by issuing real-time game data in an accessible format on-site at event venues’ scoreboards. Presently, the system has 194 unique and customizable iterations and has been implemented across 6,000 sports venues across the world.</p>
<p>According to Sportzcast President Michael Connell the Scorebot solution is crucial to the success of sports events across 400 US colleges and universities, and has been successfully implemented with 50 live sports streaming services.</p>
<p>Scorebot has multiple applications and serves across multiple verticals, including sports production, tools used by coaches to direct strategy, sportsbooks, and broadcast, among others. All the information is presented in a universal data format to facilitate ease of use and accessibility.</p>
<p>Benefiting from a Global Distribution Network</p>
<p>Genius Sports is happy to secure Scorebot along with Sportzcast’s other assets as it would allow the company’s own data solution to grow and enhance the data’s relevance to the US market as well as elsewhere in the world, said Genius Sports CEO and co-founder Mark Locke.</p>
<p>“This acquisition is yet another milestone in GSG’s rapid, continued growth. We are excited to continue executing on our strategy by leveraging Sportzcast’s incredible technology to scale our streaming and media businesses and bolster our core data products,” Locke had to add.</p>
<p>Connell agreed that the acquisition by Genius will allow Sportzcast to reach its full potential and spread globally with a solution that is able to leverage actionable sports data. Genius’ strong distribution network would allow Sportzcast to grow, Connell concluded.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Genius Sports has been revving up its footprint with numerous partnerships and alliances. Most recently, the company teamed up with the American Hockey League (AHL).</p>
<p>Just at the beginning of the month, Genius Sports has teamed up with Scientific Games, allowing the latter to benefit from Genius’ LiveData and LiveTrading services. Another notable partnership came in November when Genius became the official sponsor for the Liga MX.</p>
