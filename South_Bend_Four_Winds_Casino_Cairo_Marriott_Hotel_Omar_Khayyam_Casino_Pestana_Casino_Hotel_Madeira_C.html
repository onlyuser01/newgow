<p>$1 million will be guaranteed across 50 events at the first-ever Pennsylvania Championship of Online POker (PACOOP)</p>
<p>PokerStars PA to Launch Championship of Online Poker</p>
<p>Things just keep getting better for poker fans in Pennsylvania. First, the launch of online poker went off without a hitch a few weeks ago. Now, PokerStars has announced that the first-ever Pennsylvania Championship of Online Poker (PACOOP) will be held from November 30 to December 16.</p>
<p>There will be a $1 million guarantee across all of 50 of the events in the PACOOP, which is sure to attract plenty of players from across the state. A wide range of buy-ins will be available across the series, from $30 to $750. If that sounds a little bit too rich for your blood, you can take part in satellites from just $1.</p>
<p>The main event will take place on December 15. It will be a $300 buy-in event, and there will be a $100,000 prize pool.</p>
<p>Before the Main Event begins, players will be able to take part in a depositor freeroll. 25 Main Event tickets will be awarded, worth $7,5000.</p>
<p>A second chance freeroll will also run every day. Every play who fails to make the money in any event, will be able to enter these events. During each freeroll, $1,250 in satellite tickets will be awarded.</p>
<p>“The Championship of Online Poker, or COOP, is one of our most prestigious events and we’re proud to give Pennsylvania its own. Players in PA have already shown their excitement for PokerStars so we took things to the next level with a $1 million series guarantee and plenty of ways to get in on the action.” said Matt Primeaux, the President of FOX Bet, the sportsbetting section of PokerStars.</p>
<p>It sounds like plenty of excitement is in store for all players who take part in the PACOOP. We’re going to see all sorts of action, as PA players duke it out for the top prize in the Main Event.</p>
<p>About PokerStars’ Championship of Online Poker</p>
<p>PokerStars’ World Championship of Online Poker was originally launched in 2002, and has been a successful series for over a decade. This year, the WCOOP became the biggest online tournament in the brand’s history.</p>
<p>Over the course of 20 days, the site awarded over $104 million to players around the world, surpassing its $75 million by a long shot. Over 1.2 million players took part, so there are certainly high hopes of the first-ever PACOOP.</p>
