<p>Indiana to welcome first mobile betting sportsbook with Rush Street Interactive</p>
<p>RSI is teaming up with French Lick Resort for digital wagering</p>
<p>The Indiana Gaming Commission yet to approve the welcome bonus</p>
<p>Rush Street Interactive has teamed up with French Lick Resort and applied for a mobile betting license in Indiana. The Indiana Gaming Commission has given the go-ahead for the project.</p>
<p>Illinois to Welcome First Mobile Betting Facility</p>
<p>Illinois has introduced mobile wagering with Rush Street Interactive and French Lick Resort. As a result, residents of the state will now be able to make digital wagers and avoid the counters if they prefer. Rush Street Interactive will offer online wagers via BetRivers.com, a sportsbook designed to cater to mobile bettors.</p>
<p>This marks a continuation of previous efforts to bring sports betting in the state, with the industry officially launching in August and in time for the new NFL season. The news changes will favor mobile gamers specifically, as they don’t expect a player to come and physically register at a casino as is the case in most other jurisdictions in the US that allow mobile wagering.</p>
<p>Sports Betting Bonuses for Online Players in Indiana</p>
<p>Indiana players will also benefit from a $250 first deposit bonus that is still subject to approval by the India Gaming Commission. The only condition imposed on mobile bettors is to be within the state’s borders, which will be ensured with the help of a geolocalization technology. All participants must be of the legal age to gamble, i.e. 21.</p>
<p>Rush Street Interactive president Richard Schwartz commented on the development, emphasizing on the auspicious moment to launch the event:</p>
<p>“What better time to launch than in the height of football season, the start of baseball playoffs and just before basketball returns?”</p>
<p>Schwartz added that his team was well-aware of bettors’ preferences and specifically the ability to be able to place wagers remotely. States such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and New York have all focused on providing sports fans with remote betting options, Schwartz noted, and in all states Rush Street has been successful.</p>
<p>To achieve this goal, the company has used scalable and reliable technology allowing it to offer on-par customer service and swift payouts, he concluded.</p>
<p>A French Touch</p>
<p>Rush Street Interactive debuted the French Lick sportsbook in September, offering 3,000-foot space and a number of LED video walls, as well as additional TVs to offer fans a good retail experience. The sportsbook comes with eight self-serving kiosks. Yet, the true staying power of the brand will be derived from the mobile offer, the team says.</p>
<p>Schwartz said that Rush Street’s arrival in Illinois is tantamount to ‘making history’ in the state. ‘We are proud to expand our trust into Indiana,’ Schwartz said.</p>
<p>He also thanked the Indiana Gaming Commission for giving a vote of confidence to French Lick, with which Rush Street has been pleased to collaborate. Now, Schwartz said, the team hoped that the same trust would be extended to online betting.</p>
