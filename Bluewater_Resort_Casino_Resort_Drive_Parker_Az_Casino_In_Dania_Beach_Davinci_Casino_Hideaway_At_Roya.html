    <h1>Bluewater Resort Casino Resort Drive Parker Az Casino In Dania Beach Davinci Casino Hideaway At Roya</h1>

<p>Novibet and LeoVegas, two international betting operators, as well as Grupo OKTO and Pay4Fun, two online payment solutions providers, are the newest IBJR members</p>
<p>Leading gambling industry operators, including Entain, Flutter, Betsson and Betway, among others, recently founded the Brazilian Institute of Responsible Gaming (IBJR). The prime objective of the new organization is to engage in meaningful dialogue for the establishment of a sustainable regulated gambling market in Brazil. While its members deliver extensive experience and contribute to the dialogue, the country is on its way to establishing a sports betting regulatory framework.</p>
<p>Now, the IBJR confirmed that it expanded further its member list, by adding four new companies. As a result, LeoVegas, Novibet, Grupo OKTO, as well as Pay4Fun became members of the Institute. The new members, two international betting operators and two online payment solutions providers expand further the IBJR’s list of partners which now includes 13 members.</p>
<p>The four new members join leading gambling industry operators with a global presence, including Entain, Flutter, Bet365, Betsson, Betway, Yolo Group, as well as KTO Group, among others. Ultimately, by expanding its list of partners, the IBJR seeks to “expand the group’s activities and expertise to create a sustainable Brazilian market.”</p>
<p>Expanding Members’ List</p>
<p>André Gelfi, IBJR’s CEO, acknowledged that the latest companies that join the Institute are trusted and have a strong presence within the betting vertical. Additionally, he explained that the four new IBJR members bring valuable international experience. Finally, Gelfi said that the companies and the IBJR share a mission to contribute to the dialogue for creating a fair, safe and sustainable regulated market in Brazil.</p>
<p>“The new members are companies of great prestige in the betting sector, have international expertise in regulated markets and identify with the IBJR’s mission of collaborating with society for a regulated, fair, sustainable market that prioritizes sporting integrity and player safety.“ André Gelfi, CEO of the IBJR</p>
<p>As noted, OKTO Group is one of IBJR’s new members. The company has a strong presence within the online gambling and betting vertical since it was founded in 2019. Its leading solutions currently power the operations of companies of different sizes around the world.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Pay4Fun is a company that is based in São Paulo. Offering an e-wallet, or virtual wallet, among other payment solutions, the company has been growing its presence since 2018.</p>
<p>Two international betting operators, LeoVegas and Novibet, have touched down in Brazil already. Novibet has a rich history of operating within strategic markets across Europe. Acknowledging the potential of Latin American markets, the company recently expanded to Brazil, Chile and Mexico, among other key markets for the region.</p>
<p>While Novibet entered Latin America recently, LeoVegas did that back in 2019. Since then, the company has been offering sports betting, as well as live and online games for customers in Brazil.</p>
