<p>Rumors swirl that Caesars could be hosting the NFL Draft on April 23. Officials reportedly meeting on November 26 to reveal the location. No official confirmation has come yet.</p>
<p>Caesars Forum Potentially the Host of the NFL Draft</p>
<p>The National Football League (NFL) will reveal the location of the NFL Draft on November 26 when they’ll reportedly announce The Linq Promenade and the Caesars Forum as the likely venue for the event. The information has been revealed by people close to the matter, but relevant parties, including the NFL and Caesars, have refused to comment.</p>
<p>The NFL Draft, starting on April 23, is – without a doubt- the highlight of the off-season when 255 players will be introduced to different NFL franchises. Each player will appear in front of a crowd wearing a new jersey or a hat of the team they will be representing, and then shake hands with NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell.</p>
<p>On the occasion, Caesars Entertainment Corp. – which just approved a 17.3 billion acquisition by Eldorado Resorts – will be revealing a brand-new Caesars Forum facility sprawling on 550,000 square feet.</p>
<p>The Draft will be live-streamed throughout the entire duration of the event, which lasts through April 26. Meanwhile, Caesars expects to accommodate as many as 10,000 people on-site, sources have said, offering access to excellent facilities, such as ballrooms, ready rooms, and specifically designated locations for the teams.</p>
<p>Planning Ahead – Clark County Commission Steps In</p>
<p>Planning an event of the dimensions of the NFL Draft has its challenges. For this specific reason, the Clark County Commission is expected to hold a meeting in December and coordinate the event with the Public Works Department and Metro.</p>
<p>The size of the NFL Draft could possibly necessitate the closure of Flamingo Road and redirecting traffic. This is not an unprecedented challenge for Clark County, as the Public Works Department and police have been in the habit of coordinating multiple events throughout the years.</p>
<p>While rumors have intensified all the big names involved have declined to comment, including the NFL, and Caesars Entertainment which was voting on the acquisition deal in a meeting on Friday.</p>
<p>The Silence of the Lambs</p>
<p>While none of the above information has been officially confirmed, there have been some hopes that Commissioner Goodell would shed light about the upcoming NFL Draft on January 17, when he will be attending Preview Las Vegas held at Wynn Las Vegas.</p>
<p>Caesars is definitely shaping up to be a good choice for the NFL Draft. Not least of all, the companies recently signed a deal, with Caesars becoming an official partner for the league.</p>
<p>And specifically, the partnership focuses on entertainment events, and allows the use of NFL’s intellectual property in casinos, for example, although not in clear connection to sports betting and wagering.</p>
<p>Not least of all, Caesars has 20,000 hotel rooms in the vicinity of the new Forum thanks to a number of MGM properties, including:</p>
<p>The Mirage</p>
<p>Bellagio</p>
<p>Aria</p>
<p>Park MGM</p>
<p>MGM Grand &amp; others</p>
<p>Even then, Caesars may prove in shortage of square footage. Last year’s NFL Draft brought around 600,000 people to Nashville, Tennessee, and this year might be even busier with the anticipated arrival of the Las Vegas Raiders, one of the top franchises in the league.</p>
