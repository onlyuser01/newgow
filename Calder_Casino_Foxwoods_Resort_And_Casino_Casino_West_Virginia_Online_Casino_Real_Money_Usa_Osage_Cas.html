    <h1>Calder Casino Foxwoods Resort And Casino Casino West Virginia Online Casino Real Money Usa Osage Cas</h1>

<p>My bank and Interac would not give out false information and between the them they have more than enough proof. They are simply refusing to pay me my money and in doing so they will lose more customers and their rating will drop. I read the complaints against them and they are almost all for refusal to pay claiming the documentation is not good enough. I know I will never risk my money at a Casino with no integrity and inferior customer service like theirs. Leaves a lasting impression and its not a good one.</p>
<p>I cannot give them a screen shot showing the time and my name on it and I believe this is one of their excuses for not allowing me to withdraw my money.</p>
<p>I not only sent them the letters from my bank but also forwarded them two emails for both dates they asked for from Interac which included the time, date and was addressed to me so my name is on it and the amount. They also don't want the letters I downloaded from my bank which are 100% legitimate and I sent it the only way I could. I saved it and then uploaded it to their site</p>
<p>Well to be honest they change from day to day as to what they claim to require. They are not consistent at all and no matter what I have given then it is never good enough or they want something else.</p>
