<p>Sports betting and gaming technology company Parimatch announced changes within its structure to accommodate a new supervisory role of the board and switch to dual executive management. The overhaul of the corporate leadership was needed with regards to new commercial opportunities, the company explained.</p>
<p>Joint CEOs Syrotian and Liashko Replace Portnov</p>
<p>Parimatch announced today its chief executive officer Sergey Portnov would be no longer serving as Group CEO and will be serving as Chairman of the Board, while the company is shifting to a dual CEO structure, appointing senior partners Roman Syrotian and Maksym Liashko as the firm’s joint CEOs.</p>
<p>“A dual CEO structure is a logical move and consolidation of the company’s growth directions. We know our areas well, and we will do everything to implement the company’s plans to enter the next level of development.” Maksym Liashko, Co-CEO, Parimatch</p>
<p>According to the information provided by the gaming technology company, Maksym Liashko will be tasked with responsibilities related to day-to-day finance and compliance oversight of the company, while technology, marketing, and product development units at Parimatch will be under Syrotian’s management and leadership.</p>
<p>Restructured Board</p>
<p>Joint chief executive officers Syrotian and Liashko will also continue to perform the duties of directors at the board and will be joined by currently serving as chair at Parimatch Foundation Katerina Belorusskaya and Marek Šmrha as non-executive directors.</p>
<p>“Updating the company’s structure and creating a board is an indicator of Parimatch’s maturity and readiness. Now is the best time for such changes. I am sure that this will strengthen the brand’s strategy and will allow the large ship that is Parimatch to move along the route more rapidly.” Sergey Portnov, Chairman, Board of Directors, Parimatch</p>
<p>Parimatch made history in March by becoming the first operator to receive a sports betting license in Ukraine, after the country passed the new gambling law in August 2020. This was achieved in wake of the company’s other accomplishment of obtaining an online gaming license back in February.</p>
<p>Seeking to expand across sports and jurisdictions, Parimatch teamed with Serie A record titles holder Juventus SC to launch a new digital campaign built around the football team’s most popular faces to improve its brand awareness, while a month earlier appointed Brazilian professional esports player Marcelo Augusto David as its new Global Esports Ambassador.</p>
