<p>Ahead of National Suicide Prevention Month, a new report reveals that there has been an uptick in the people affected by problem gambling who seek support</p>
<p>The initiative seeking to promote responsible gambling among gamblers in Ohio, Ohio for Responsible Gambling, confirmed that an increase is observed in the number of people calling for help regarding problem gambling. On Tuesday, the organization revealed that the number of calls from people in need of help with problem gambling has increased by 70% year-to-date when compared to the corresponding period last year. The increase once again alerted clinical professionals about the dangers of gambling-related harm.</p>
<p>The latest announcement comes at a time when sports betting is blooming, not only in Ohio but in neighboring states as well. The worrying statistics emerged ahead of National Suicide Prevention Month, featuring initiatives this September. In light of this, Ohio for Responsible Gambling once again reminded players, their families, as well as health experts to be on the lookout for early signs of problem gambling.</p>
<p>Spotting the Early Signs of Problem Gambling Is Crucial</p>
<p>Derek Longmeier, the Problem Gambling Network of Ohio’s executive director, acknowledged that amid the growth of the popularity of sports betting, people need to understand the importance of setting limits. He outlined that detecting excessive gambling early is crucial, explaining that behavioral changes such as betting more than you can afford or seeking for the excitement of wagering big sums can be counted as red flags.</p>
<p>“With sports betting now legal, we need everyone to understand the risks and learn about setting limits.“ Derek Longmeier, executive director, Problem Gambling Network of Ohio</p>
<p>Additionally, Longmeier said that people affected by at-risk, or problem gambling may hide or lie about how much money or time they spend gambling, engage in loans or cut costs for vital expenses like food or rent and use them for gambling. Another red flag could also be a sudden drop in work performance, warns the executive director of the Problem Gambling Network of Ohio.</p>
<p>“Research tells us that of those experiencing a gambling disorder, up to 38% will consider suicide.“ Tony Coder, executive director of the Ohio Suicide Prevention Foundation</p>
<p>Tony Coder, the Ohio Suicide Prevention Foundation’s executive director, spoke about the clear connection between gambling activities and mental health. Citing research, he said that people affected by problem gambling are more vulnerable to suicide, with up to 38% considering such actions. Coder noted that this percentage is the highest out of any form of addiction. Finally, he encouraged anyone experiencing problem gambling to ask for treatment and support.</p>
