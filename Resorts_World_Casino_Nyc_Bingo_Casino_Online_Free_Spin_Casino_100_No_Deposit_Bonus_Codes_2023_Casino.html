    <h1>Resorts World Casino Nyc Bingo Casino Online Free Spin Casino 100 No Deposit Bonus Codes 2023 Casino</h1>

<p>Deposited 75€ on 2021-12-31 with 200% bonus 20x wagering requirement. Got through the wager and ended up with 2000€.</p>
<p>Made a withdrawal request on 2021-01-01 of 2x 1000€. After this I got my account fully verified after submitting my documents.</p>
<p>On 2022-01-12 they cancelled my withdrawals and confiscated the funds. I of course asked them about this since they did not send me any emails or notify me in any way about the situation. They said to me in the live-chat that I have played some prohibited games like jackpot games, which I do not have done.</p>
<p>Now I know the terms and conditions of this bonus and the games I can play with the bonus balance and I have not played any of those prohibited slots. I also asked which slot I have played then, but they did not answer me.</p>
<p>There is no gaming logs available at their site to see which slots I have played, but I have played at their site with a bonus before and on other Mirage corps other sites enough to know the bonus terms.</p>
<p>That being said I would like Ovitoons to return my money they took and let me withdraw it.</p>
