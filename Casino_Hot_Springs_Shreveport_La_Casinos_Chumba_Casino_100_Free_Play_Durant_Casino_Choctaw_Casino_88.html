    <h1>Casino Hot Springs Shreveport La Casinos Chumba Casino 100 Free Play Durant Casino Choctaw Casino 88</h1>

<p>Live Solutions, the preeminent supplier of casino table games platforms, has signed a new partnership with SOFTSWISS, an established provider of overall iGaming software</p>
<p>The partnership will bring a number of Live Solutions’ products featured in its Casino Floor Live portfolio to the SOFTSWISS Game Aggregator and distribute it across the latter’s content hub.</p>
<p>SOFTSWISS Boosts Live Solutions Exposure</p>
<p>With more than 13,000 games by 180 providers under its belt, the SOFTSWISS content aggregator is a massive product that enables companies to quickly pick from an ever-growing library of gaming opportunities. This latest partnership further fleshes out the available choices by adding solutions such as Blackjack, Roulette, Baccarat, Fan Tan, Dragon Tiger, and Craps to the list of available options.</p>
<p>The fact that they come as live games is also a clear boon. Live Solutions brings real-life casino tables through advanced high-quality video streaming and features more than 3,500 table hosts who run the action in 45 languages.</p>
<p>Live Solutions argues that its products transcend and defy the traditional live casino experience which relies on table hosts live streaming. In the company’s case, interaction is encouraged, and Live Solutions makes sure that players feel close to the action.</p>
<p>The already robust product portfolio will now get a further nudge along through the powerful SOFTSWISS aggregator reach. Live Solutions CEO Jean-Pierre Houareau praised the opportunity to further consolidate his company’s reach in new iGaming markets and with fresh audiences.</p>
<p>He explained that his company already provides top-quality games and launching into new locations or with fresh audiences is precisely the nudge-along that his company needs and precisely what SOFTSWISS can deliver on.</p>
<p>Partnership Meant to Boost Both Companies’ Reach</p>
<p>SOFTSWISS Game Aggregator partner managers team lead Nikita Keino was pleased with the opportunity to add yet another prominent provider of casino content and let the Game Aggregator solution distribute the products to interested players.</p>
<p>“And we are sure that the integration with Live Solutions, whose games stand out for their quality and ability to engage players, will bring exciting experiences for both parties and the iGaming business,” he concluded.</p>
<p>SOFTSWISS previously grew its aggregator platform with the addition of MGA Games. The company is also the first mainstream iGaming supplier and developer to also introduce Bitcoin support for online gaming.</p>
