<p>Australia’s biggest wagering and entertainment company Sky Racing World (SRW) announced it has expanded its portfolio of international racing with the launch of Malaysian Thoroughbred racing.</p>
<p>Enhancing Product Portfolio</p>
<p>Launched at the end of September, the addition of Malaysian Thoroughbred racing to SRW’s racing portfolio enhanced the already impressive thoroughbred offering of the Kentucky-based distributor of international horse-racing content.</p>
<p>The subsidiary of Tabcorp is already providing its North American customers with access to racing events from Australia, New Zealand, Korea, Japan, Singapore, South Africa, Argentina, and the Caribbean and remains the leading digital source for premium tipping content and live video broadcasts from markets in the Southern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>“We are delighted to introduce the simulcast of Malaysian Thoroughbred racing to North American players,” said David Haslett, chief executive officer of SRW, who believes that the addition from the “historic Selangor Turf Club” to the simulcast portfolio of the company would serve to further SRW’s goal of “offering punters a diverse selection of markets to enjoy.”</p>
<p>Michael Fong, chief executive officer of Selangor Turf Club, also commented on the announcement, adding that the Club was more than happy to “simulcast its races to a new market segment in North America” while bringing racing from Malaysia to “international trends and standard.”</p>
<p>“We are happy to provide punters in North America with an additional race venue to wager and thank Sky Racing World for their support,” Fong concluded.</p>
<p>Racing Entertainment on Saturday Nights</p>
<p>Following the addition of Malaysian Thoroughbred racing, racing punters in North America can now place wagers on a variety of options, including Win, Place, Exacta, Daily Double, Trifecta, Superfecta, Pick 3, and Pick 4 on the meets from the famous Selangor Turf Club in Kuala Lumpur which will take place weekly, and predominantly on Saturday nights.</p>
<p>SRW will have all races streamed live on its new app, online on the company’s website and across major advance depositing wagering (ADW) platforms, while the website will also provide fans of thoroughbred racing with access to past performances and picks.</p>
<p>Recently, SRW moved to commingle its wagering pools in the US and the UK via an agreement with Arena Racing Company that will leverage ADW to provide racing fans in the US with access to the company’s UK pool, as well as punters in the UK to wager on greyhound races in the US.</p>
<p>Besides showcasing SRW’s portfolio of greyhound racing in the UK, commingling the pools is expected to improve liquidity for bettors on both sides of the Atlantic.</p>
