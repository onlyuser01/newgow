    <h1>Vicksburg Ms Casinos Ameristar Casino Black Hawk Colorado Winstar Online Casino Casino In Tn Golden</h1>

<p>So I made a permanent self-exclusion without reopening, which was simply deleted the next day.</p>
<p>Here are Scatterhall's T&amp;Cs where you can see how they break their own rules and they don't care at all about player protection.</p>
<p>Thank you for your complaint. I am very sorry to hear about your negative experience. I checked the terms and conditions and found the following:</p>
<p>"7.5 SELF EXCLUSION</p>
<p>7.5.1 You can choose to exclude yourself from playing games on our website for a definite or indefinite period of time. In the event that you decide to exclude yourself permanently or indefinitely, you will not be able to access our gaming services through the Website. Once the self-exclusion is in effect, you will only be able to log in after the period has expired and after contacting customer service.</p>
<p>7.5.2 During your self-exclusion, whether for a definite or indefinite period, you will not receive any marketing material from us.</p>
<p>7.5.3 A self-exclusion implemented by means of this clause will only be removed at your request with a 7-day cooling-off period or after the specified duration of the self-exclusion period.</p>
<p>7.5.4 Any request to extend the self-exclusion period will be effective immediately upon receipt of the request.</p>
<p>7.6 Please note that we do not have access to any self-exclusions or restrictions that you may have imposed on other gambling operators and as such it is your responsibility to inform us of any self-exclusion you wish to implement on your account. In addition, each limit applies only to the brand related to the query you are currently registered with and does not include any additional websites managed and/or owned by us. If you have self-excluded due to gambling problems we will close your account for all our other brands and the outstanding withdrawable balance will be refunded to you.</p>
<p>7.7 Notwithstanding the foregoing, we reserve the right to close your account for responsible gaming measures if we determine, in our sole and absolute discretion, that your activity involves any form of gambling addiction. However, we accept no responsibility if you continue to use our website with the intention of circumventing the measures that we make available to you. Therefore, it is your own and full responsibility to contact us if you feel it would be best to put a limit on your activity and/or account.</p>
<p>7.8 If you request self-exclusion, you agree to provide complete and accurate personal information now and in the future so that your access/use of the Website and Services may be restricted. If you choose to self-exclude, we will use all reasonable efforts to ensure that we comply with your self-exclusion. However, by agreeing to self-exclusion, you accept that you also have an obligation not to attempt to circumvent self-exclusion. Accordingly, we accept no responsibility or liability for any consequential consequences or losses, for whatever reason, that you suffer or suffer as a result of starting or continuing to play via additional online accounts where you have changed registration details or provided misleading, inaccurate or incomplete information provide details or otherwise attempt to circumvent the agreed self-exclusion. If you self-exclude yourself from a site operated by Zeus Lightning NV because of gambling issues, this applies to all other brands. As a self-excluded player, you should not open another account with any other website during the selected period. Should you open another account with any website operated by Zeus Lightning NV, we reserve the right to close it immediately without prior notice and void any winnings. Any remaining real money balances will be refunded but are subject to an administration fee of up to 10%.</p>
