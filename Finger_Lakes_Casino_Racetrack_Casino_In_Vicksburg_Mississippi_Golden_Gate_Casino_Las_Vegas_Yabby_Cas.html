<p>The award-winning developer of innovative online casino games, Hacksaw Gaming, has further expanded its presence in the Greek iGaming market through a link-up with N1 Casino, a respected local operator.</p>
<p>Thanks to this partnership, both parties are set to benefit. N1 Casino will introduce a range of high-quality slot games, such as Wanted Dead or a Wild, Hand of Anubis and Drop’em, among others, which will all strengthen the operator’s gaming library. In the meantime, Hacksaw Gaming will benefit from establishing its footprint in yet another market and pursuing further geographical and demographical growth.</p>
<p>Hacksaw Gaming CEO Marcus Cordes has welcomed the news of seeing the company expand in yet another European market and broaden its reach in the region. He called Greece an important market for the supplier’s further growth, and added:</p>
<p>"Today’s news marks another signal of our intentions as we continue to expand in regulated markets and showcase our games to newer and newer audiences."</p>
<p>N1 Casino was similarly pleased with the partnership, calling the addition of Hacksaw Gaming titles a milestone in its journey to secure a stronger pull with local players. A representative for the casino said that the entire organization was confident in the future success of the collaboration and what it would mean for players.</p>
<p>Hacksaw Gaming has come a long way since it launched in 2019, when it focused chiefly on the development of scratch cards, but rapidly progressed to innovative slot content in the years that followed. Today, the company is one of the preferred and fastest-growing suppliers for some of the world’s biggest casino brands.</p>
<p>The supplier recently expanded in both Romania and Italy through partnerships with local operators, establishing a firmer foothold in Europe as a whole. Apart from pursuing active growth in Europe, however, the supplier has been very successful in establishing its presence across the pond in North America.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Hacksaw Gaming teamed up with Rush Street Interactive and the latter’s BetRivers brand in West Virginia, United States. This partnership was building upon the existing ties between the operator and supplier in Ontario, Canada where Hacksaw Gaming is also providing games to BetRivers.</p>
