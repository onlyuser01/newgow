    <h1>Beau Rivage Resort Casino Beach Boulevard Biloxi Ms Potawatomi Hotel And Casino Casinos In Austin Te</h1>

<p>SUZOHAPP, a leading gaming, amusement and sports betting products provider, has made a foray into Ontario, thanks to an agreement with Great Canadian Entertainment (formerly Great Canadian Gaming Corporation). The deal will see SUZOHAPP supply the land-based casino company with its best sports betting machines.</p>
<p>SUZOHAPP to Inaugurate Sports Betting Machines in Ontario</p>
<p>SUZOHAPP, which produces and distributes high-quality gambling equipment, will launch its state-of-the-art sports betting terminals in ten Great Canadian locations across the Canadian province of Ontario. As a result, the provider will greatly expand its presence in North America, allowing it to capitalize on the fast-growing Ontarian market.</p>
<p>The launch of SUZOHAPP’s product in the province notably marks the first time in-person sports betting machines will be available to local bettors. As a pioneer, the provider is well-positioned to benefit from the growth of the sports betting vertical.</p>
<p>The ten locations where Great Canadian will add SUZOHAPP sports betting terminals are the following: Casino Woodbine, Elements Casino Brantford, Elements Casino Flamboro, Elements Casino Grand River, Elements Casino Mohawk, Great Blue Heron Casino &amp; Hotel, Pickering Casino Resort, Shorelines Casino Belleville, Shorelines Casino Peterborough and Shorelines Casino Thousand Islands.</p>
<p>Great Canadian Wants to Expand Its Sports Betting Offerings</p>
<p>As an Ontario native, SUZOHAPP’s president, Sim Bielak, is especially excited about the launch of the company’s machines at local casinos. He is sure that this agreement with Great Canadian Entertainment will provide lots of opportunities for both companies. Bielak said that he is happy with his company’s progress in the sports betting market and hopes that SUZOHAPP will continue to be a valued hardware partner of casino and sports betting companies.</p>
<p>Tony Rodio, the chief executive officer of Great Canadian Entertainment, also spoke about the agreement. He noted that the addition of SUZOHAPP sports betting terminals at 10 Ontario venues is a major growth effort on his company’s side.</p>
<p>The addition of SUZOHAPP sports betting terminals at 10 of our Ontario destinations is another effort in our commitment to investing in our facilities and further enhancing the integrated gaming and guest experience we provide. Tony Rodio, CEO, Great Canadian Entertainment</p>
<p>Rodio thanked SUZOHAPP for their help in launching retail sports betting. He also thanked the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation, the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario and the provisional government for their indispensable aid.</p>
<p>On the same note, Great Canadian just teamed up with Kambi Group in a multi-year sports betting-oriented agreement. Under the latter deal, Kambi will provide the casino company’s venues with its critically-acclaimed sports betting solutions.</p>
