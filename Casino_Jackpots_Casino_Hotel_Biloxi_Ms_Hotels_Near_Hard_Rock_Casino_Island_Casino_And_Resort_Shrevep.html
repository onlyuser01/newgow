    <h1>Casino Jackpots Casino Hotel Biloxi Ms Hotels Near Hard Rock Casino Island Casino And Resort Shrevep</h1>

<p>Hello.</p>
<p>I registered with this casino on September 20, 2023. I deposited 500 euros to start and claimed the High Roller bonus. I completed the wagering requirements for the High Roller bonus, initiated a withdrawal, and submitted the necessary documents for KYC verification. The documents passed the verification process.</p>
<p>I continued to play with both RAW cash and bonus funds. Additionally, I had two larger withdrawals that were approved, and I received the funds. Since my last withdrawal, I deposited 600 euros in RAW cash, then increased it to 800 euros and initiated another withdrawal. However, this withdrawal was rejected, and they asked for a selfie with my ID card and proof of the source of the deposited money because they do not believe it was obtained from legal activities.</p>
<p>I explained that I am a digital content creator who works as a freelancer. I do not have contracts with clients. I usually provide invoices to my clients, and they transfer the payment based on the invoice. I sent them an invoice for one of my clients and an official Revolut bank statement that confirms I received the money from my client. Therefore, my income is legal. I cannot provide any other documents. I pay taxes as an individual in my country, following the appropriate laws.</p>
<p>Furthermore, what they are asking from me seems surreal because I used the money I won in the casino to deposit and essentially played with that. Therefore, any illegal activity is out of the question.</p>
<p>This is nothing more than them trying to avoid paying me this amount because I am a smart player who has won more than lost, and they are citing arbitrary reasons to withhold the payment.</p>
<p>I would like to request the assistance of casino.guru. I have played at many casinos recommended by casino.guru, and none of them have treated me this way, accused me of cheating, or questioned the legality of my income.</p>
<p>I have attached screenshots of the money movements in my casino account.</p>
