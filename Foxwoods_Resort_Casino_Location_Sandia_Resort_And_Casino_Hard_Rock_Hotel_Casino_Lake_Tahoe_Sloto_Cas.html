<p>Betixon has become the latest supplier to plant its flag in the fast-developing Dutch iGaming market. The company, which specializes in the delivery of leading online casino content and gameplay through numerous high-performing games, has received an official go-ahead from the country’s regulator.</p>
<p>Dutch Market Welcomes Betixon</p>
<p>As a result, Betixon will be able to introduce its portfolio of products, and not least Age of Halvar, Reign of Zeus, Wild Wolf, Boots of Luck, and Bok of Sheba, to local audiences and partners brands. All of these solutions are tailored for an unmatched mobile experience that will make it easy for players to access the products on the go and free of any restraints. Betixon CEO Lior Cohen had this to say:</p>
<p>“We will be going live with our first operators shortly and looking forward to partnering with more as we establish Betixon as a leading content provider in the Dutch market.” Betixon CEO Lior Cohen</p>
<p>Betixon has a reputation for developing cutting-edge mobile games and has clawed a good share of the European market in countries such as the United Kingdom, Italy, Romania, Lithuania, Estonia, and most recently, the Netherlands.</p>
<p>Betixon will be adding its PowerUpSpins mechanic that introduces “power-ups” triggered during regular gameplay sessions to add up a little more excitement to the overall pace of play. Betixon is debuting three PowerUpSpins games between December and the first quarter of 2022.</p>
<p>The company has paid attention to both the social and real money elements of the gaming experience introducing the spinXP feature, which creates more opportunities to engage with consumers and help them explore new products. Betixon has hinted that it will be delivering exclusive and branded content, subject to negotiations with partners in the market.</p>
<p>Regulatory Framework for the Future</p>
<p>Commenting on this milestone, Cohen said that the Netherlands presents a tremendous opportunity for everyone in Europe. With the market having a bit of a rough start, adoption has been tremendous, and Betixon is hardly the only brand competing for an entry.</p>
<p>However, Cohen believes that the regulatory framework established by regulators will now allow consumers and businesses to realize the market’s full potential. He added:</p>
<p>“Our slots have been designed to deliver an exceptional player experience on mobile, and each game is packed with eye-catching graphics and animations that we combine with smart math and mechanics to ensure players are entertained with every spin.” Betixon CEO Lior Cohen</p>
<p>Betixon and Cohen outlined their future plans with us in the GamblingNews podcast. It’s good to see them deliver.</p>
