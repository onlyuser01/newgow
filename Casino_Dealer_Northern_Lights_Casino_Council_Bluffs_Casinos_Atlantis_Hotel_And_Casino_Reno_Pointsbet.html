    <h1>Casino Dealer Northern Lights Casino Council Bluffs Casinos Atlantis Hotel And Casino Reno Pointsbet</h1>

<p>Galaxsys, a rising star in the iGaming industry, has signed a partnership with one of the best established gaming operators in the online casino vertical</p>
<p>As a result, Galaxsys will move forward with its 25 fast and skill games and deploy them across Betsson Group brands, strengthening each operator’s respective offering and adding more value to players and audiences looking for innovation.</p>
<p>Betsson and Galaxsys Launch Stronger Content Library</p>
<p>Both the company’s Fast Games and Skill Games portfolio are already well-established in the industry, allowing Galaxsys to remain flexible and deliver experiences that are tailored to player expectations and needs.</p>
<p>Among the genres of games featured by Galaxsys are such excellent options as mines, crash, plinko, and instant games, with the portfolio growing at a rapid pace. Betsson Group currently features more than 20 brands in its library, which means that Galaxsys’ games will be available at places such as Betsafe, NordicBet, JallaCasino.se, StarCasino, and the eponymous Betsson.</p>
<p>Commenting on this opportunity, Galaxsys SVP of sales and business development Gil Soffer said that this was a very important opportunity for the company, and praised Betsson Group as a pioneer gaming entity that has spurred innovation industry-wide. Soffer added:</p>
<p>We share the same pioneering company spirit as Galaxsys is a major force in the provision of fast and skill games to more discerning digital players. Galaxsys SVP of sales and business development Gil Soffer</p>
<p>Soffer was joined by Betsson supplier relations manager Laura Peretta who was equally happy with this opportunity and the chance to see the group’s brands secure access to another up-and-coming studio’s portfolio.</p>
<p>“Galaxsys has demonstrated that they are a forward-thinking supplier of games that appeal to a growing cohort of players looking for different and faster gaming experiences,” Peretta added.</p>
<p>Galaxsys Ready to Introduce More and Better Features</p>
<p>She added that Betsson was now looking forward to seeing how players and audiences will receive the games and what whether they would enjoy the new additions.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Galaxsys has been looking to expand its reach in new jurisdictions, with the supplier firmly committed to building upon its offer and ensuring that its products are known to bigger audiences. Galaxsys obtained certification in both Colombia and Greece.</p>
<p>Galaxsys has also been working on making its products more appealing through the introduction of new features, such as Lightning Bonus and Leaderboard, which are designed to significantly boost engagement and retention for players across the board.</p>
