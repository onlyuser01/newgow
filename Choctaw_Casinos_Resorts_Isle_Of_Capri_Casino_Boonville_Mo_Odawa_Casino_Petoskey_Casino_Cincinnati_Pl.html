<p>McGregor punches a pub patron in the face for refusing a drink of whiskey</p>
<p>Irish police have opened an investigation</p>
<p>McGregor is preparing to meet new challenges</p>
<p>McGregor is being investigated for hitting a patron in a pub in Dublin, Ireland, ahead of future fights. UFC President Dana White comments on the case.</p>
<p>McGregor Hits a Man in a Pub Over Whiskey</p>
<p>Conor McGregor, a professional UFC fighter with a long history of unprovoked violence, made headlines once again. According to eye-witnesses and CCTV camera, Mr. McGregor attacked a man at a pub in Dublin, Ireland.</p>
<p>The incident took place on April 6 when Mr. McGregor had lined up glasses at the bar, inviting all patrons to take a sip from Proper Twelve whiskey he had bought. One of the patrons refused to accept the drink, which seemed to provoke Mr. McGregor who landed a punch in the man’s face.</p>
<p>https://twitter.com/iheartmindy/status/1162008438773207040</p>
<p>CCTV revealed that the UFC fighter was ushered outside the pub by people he was with at the time. A case was lodged with the Ireland’s Director of Public Prosecutions to investigate the confrontation, but no formal charges or arrests have been made so far.</p>
<p>Commenting for the press, Irish police said that the case was investigated and there was no official position against Mr. McGregor.</p>
<p>McGregor Continues to Break Laws</p>
<p>The latest tantrum is just one in a line of multiple charges the Irish has faced so far. In April, 2018, he attacked Khabib Nurmagomedov, smashing a bus window in the process. He was briefly facing felony charges, but that didn’t come to pass. Yet, the UFC issued a formal reprimand, fined McGregor $50,000 and banned him from fighting for six months.</p>
<p>Speaking of the man’s antics, McGregor assaulted a fan who tried to take a photo of him, smashing his phone in the ground. Charges were brought against him and he was arrested in Miami, where the incident took place, but the fan later withdrew his claim and let him go.</p>
<p>In the case of Nurmagomedov, McGregor has a bone to pick as he lost to him in the ring, which has prompted particular hostility on the part of the Irish.</p>
<p>A Retired Man</p>
<p>McGregor has 26 professional fights, but he has already called it quits – once, for a week. Posting an official statement on Twitter, he had this to say:</p>
<p>“Hey guys quick announcement, I’ve decided to retire from the sport formally known as ‘Mixed Martial Art’ today. I wish all my old colleagues well going forward in competition. I now join my former partners on this venture, already in retirement. Proper Pina Coladas on me fellas!”</p>
<p>Yet, shortly after this message was published, McGregor said that he would rather get back in the thick of it. Volatile and indecisive, McGregor is stepping back in the ring in hours.</p>
