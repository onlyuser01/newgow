<p>PokerStars and Oracle Red Bull Racing have freshened up their partnership just in time for the start of the F1 season</p>
<p>Last August, PokerStars and Oracle Red Bull Racing announced they would continue their sponsorship partnership to release a fresh Red Spade pass after the first one was launched in March of the same year. Then, Formula 1 fans were allowed to take part in a series of free rolls for a chance to scoop up a limited edition pass that would bring them event tickets, extra fan benefits, and exclusive access to F1 experiences.</p>
<p>Now, the two parties have announced an extension of their agreement for the 2023 season, marking their second year with a fruitful collaboration. Accordingly, PokerStars will keep promoting its international brand using Formula 1 after it agreed to continue to sponsor the Oracle Red Bull Racing team.</p>
<p>Right in Time for the New F1 Season</p>
<p>The extension of the agreement was officially secured right in time for the official start of the fresh F1 season last weekend. Oracle Red Bull Racing’s Max Verstappen with support from its Team Partner Honda won the pole position, closely followed by Sergio Perez who came in second at the Bahrain Grand Prix.</p>
<p>According to the joint statement issued by the two parties, PokerStars will make a comeback to racetrack while ready to hand out even more rewards for F1 aficionados, share promotions, fresh content, and competitions for the chances to win “unforgettable experiences at some of the season’s most hotly anticipated races.”</p>
<p>PokerStars will use its official YouTube channel to present never-before-seen footage behind the scenes during important races. PokerStars Red Spade Pass which was a big hit last year will also be making a comeback this year, letting PokerStars players enjoy unique experiences.</p>
<p>PokerStars’ Embrace the Race program consisting of race weekend rewards is also part of the partnership extension. The program features a brand-new Chicane Cash Drop, along with Spin &amp; Go Races, Odds Boost on Sports bets, and even a Casino Weekend Races Leaderboard.</p>
<p>The PokerStars Partnership, an “Ace Move for the Team”</p>
<p>As explained by Red Bull’s team principal, Christian Horner, their partnership with PokerStars has represented an “ace move for the Team.” Horner spoke about PokerStars’ commitment to innovation and entertainment which he called a “winning formula” that rightfully matches their own set of values in F1.</p>
<p>The same high-coverage F1 partnership helped the operator of some of the most popular online poker sites have its brand be exclusively featured on strategic locations including drivers’ race suits and pit crew helmets, Red Bull 19 car’s halo, the inner cockpit, and the rear wing end plate.</p>
<p>Flutter’s director of partnerships, public relations, and consumer engagement, Rebecca McAdam Willetts, called their first year of collaboration “an incredible first year” while expressing delight to enter the 2023 season with additional rewards, extra content, and even more engaging experiences meant to propel their partnership even more. Willets also praised Oracle Red Bull Racing’s ethos and vision which have helped the two partners reach audiences with similar views and passions.</p>
