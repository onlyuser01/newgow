<p>Ho-Chunk Casino Killing Trial Delayed By Prison Coronavirus Outbreak</p>

<p>The trial of a septuagenarian charged with fatally stabbing a fellow senior citizen outside the Ho-Chunk Casino in Baraboo, Wisconsin is on ice. That’s after an outbreak of coronavirus in the prison holding the accused.</p>

<p>Robert Pulvermacher is alleged to have killed 88-year-old Harold Johnson after the older man tried to collect a small gambling debt.</p>
<p>Parking lot surveillance video showed the two men entering Johnson’s vehicle on Jan 13, 2019 but only Pulvermacher got out. He returned to the Ho-Chunk casino where he reportedly stayed for a further seven hours.</p>
<p>Johnson’s body was discovered the next day, still inside the car.</p>
<p>Authorities launched a manhunt for Pulvermacher, who was detained on January 23 after being caught breaking into a business in Madison. Since then, he has resided at the Waupun Correctional Institution, where he is serving a sentence for an unrelated crime.</p>
<p>Prison Lockdown?</p>
<p>Local ABC affiliate WKOW reports that Pulvermacher was scheduled to appear at a hearing last June 3. But prison officials would not comply with a judge’s order to produce the suspect because the entire facility was in quarantine as a result of an outbreak of COVID-19.</p>
<p>Then, a scheduled hearing for an October 27 came and went, still with no appearance from Pulvermacher.</p>
<p>According to court filings, the prisoner could not be released because he was “in isolation” for at least ten days, and the reason for this could not be divulged.</p>
<p>Correction Department documents seen by WKOW indicate “isolation” is not a word used to describe disciplinary measures.</p>
<p>Pulvermacher’s court appearance has been rescheduled for December 1, but Johnson’s family, desperate for closure, is skeptical that he’ll make an appearance.</p>
<p>“I am not expecting that is going to happen on December 1 either, because of the COVID issues in Waupun,” Lori Udelhofen, Johnson’s daughter, told WKOW.</p>
<p>We did want him in the courtroom for sentencing because we wanted him to have to face our family and all of the people he hurt so deeply,” she added.</p>
<p>Pulvermacher has an extensive criminal history, and once escaped from a federal prison where he was serving a sentence for robbery and weapons charges. He was recaptured a week later.</p>
<p>Another Ho-Chunk Attack</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on Wednesday a woman was found guilty of felony aggravated battery after she attacked and robbed a man at the Ho-Chunk Baraboo back in 2016.</p>
<p>Thirty-year-old Chia Chang’s 68-year-old victim was so savagely beaten he required eye surgery to repair a torn retina.</p>
<p>Chiang had been scheduled to appear in court in 2018, but had twice failed to attend. She reappeared in September 2019 trying to cash phony checks at a branch of the Wells Fargo bank.</p>
<p>She claimed she did not remember attacking her victim with a coat hanger at the Ho-Chunk and that she had an alcohol problem and suffered from blackouts.</p>
<p>Chiang was banned from entering any gambling business and from having any contact with the man she attacked. She was fined $200 and ordered to undergo alcohol and drug counseling.</p>
