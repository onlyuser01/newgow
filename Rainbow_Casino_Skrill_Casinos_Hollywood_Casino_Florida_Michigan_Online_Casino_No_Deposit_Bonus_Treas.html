<p>Three suspects are facing charges of attempted murder with a deadly weapon and several other counts. That’s after a man was knifed this week in a room at Las Vegas Strip’s MGM Grand.</p>

<p>The unnamed male victim met one of the suspects, identified as Faith Bennett, early on Monday. He told Bennett he would pay her $300 for a sex act, according to Las Vegas TV station KLAS.</p>
<p>He and Bennett then went to a hotel room on the property’s seventh floor, which was registered to a second woman, identified as Monica Juarez.</p>
<p>Man Fondled Woman</p>
<p>While in the room, the man allegedly touched Bennett’s genitals. Bennett became furious with the man, and scolded him that touching her vaginal area was “off-limits,” KLAS reported. She then ordered him to leave the hotel room.</p>
<p>Bennett allegedly had a switchblade in her possession, but it was unclear if she or Juarez stabbed the man, police said.</p>
<p>The third person arrested, Nicholas Laws, told authorities he went into the hotel room to calm down the situation after the argument broke out.</p>
<p>The wounded victim, who was described as being in his 50s, made his way to a nearby elevator. He later was found on the hotel’s fifth floor and was transported to University Medical Center for treatment of his wounds.</p>
<p>Later, a housekeeper found the knife used in the stabbing hidden under a bed in the seventh-floor room.</p>
<p>The three suspects left the hotel at about 7:30 a.m. on Monday. They entered a taxi, which drove them to an apartment complex near the intersection of East Katie Avenue and Algonquin Drive, KLAS reported.</p>
<p>They soon were apprehended at the apartment complex by Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department (LVMPD) officers. None of the trio would discuss details about the reported stabbing with police.</p>
<p>Numerous Charges</p>
<p>In addition to the attempted murder charge, Bennett, Juarez, and Laws were each charged with battery with a deadly weapon resulting in substantial bodily harm, conspiracy to commit battery with a deadly weapon resulting in substantial bodily harm, conspiracy to commit murder with a deadly weapon, and harboring a felony offender.</p>
<p>The three appeared in local court later in the week. Each was released on bond.</p>
<p>One of the conditions set by a judge for their release is that none could contact the victim.</p>
<p>Each suspect was told to next appear in court on November 1.</p>
