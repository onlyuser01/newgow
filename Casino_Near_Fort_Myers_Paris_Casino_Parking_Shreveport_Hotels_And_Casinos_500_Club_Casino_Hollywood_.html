    <h1>Casino Near Fort Myers Paris Casino Parking Shreveport Hotels And Casinos 500 Club Casino Hollywood</h1>

<p>On Wednesday, Maryland Sports Properties, owned by Playfly Sports, revealed that it had signed a multi-year partnership with PointsBet USA. This is an inaugural partnership for the betting industry, as PointsBet is the first operator to team up with the Big Ten Conference. This alliance will lead to fan-facing in-game and campus activations, as detailed by the press release.</p>
<p>The partnership will similarly feature signage around and across Maryland’s XFINITY Center and Capital One Field at Maryland Stadium to boost awareness for PointsBet as well as address popular issues such as problem gambling. PointsBet will seek to educate Maryland students, staff, and fans on the dangers of compulsive gambling as well as explain responsible gambling.</p>
<p>PointsBet and Maryland Sports Properties is sitting on top of more information about the future of the tie-up, including a philanthropic component, which is not yet revealed. Through the partnership with Maryland Athletics, PointsBet will help drive the narrative on sports betting education, with over 32 states and the District of Columbia accepting sports wagers in some capacity.</p>
<p>Delivering Vital Information about Sports Betting and Responsible Gambling</p>
<p>PointsBet’s involvement with collegiate organizations dated to at least 2020 when the company managed to become the official sports betting operator for an NCA Power 5 athletic department that is the University of Colorado Buffaloes. Commenting on the present success, PointsBet USA CEO Johnny Aitken said:</p>
<p>“Investing in the University of Maryland athletics program expands our ability to impact local communities and the greater DMV region while also connecting PointsBet with alumni that remain actively involved in reverence to their alma mater.” PointsBet USA CEO Johnny Aitken</p>
<p>Aitken sees sports betting education and responsible gambling as two pivots of the brand’s future strategy in securing a bigger share of the fast-developing US betting market. He didn’t miss to commend the university as a high-profile and storied institution.</p>
<p>Maryland executive associate athletic director and chief strategy officer Brian Ullmann reaffirmed the mission statement of the university and its new partner, arguing that the institution would seek to educate student-athletes on responsible gambling and betting, not least benefiting from its status of leaders in the Big Ten Conference in their region. PointsBet’s assets will naturally be featured across Maryland’s digital channels to boost awareness for the campaign and alliance.</p>
<p>Commenting on this sign-up, Playfly Sports Properties COO Craig Sloan added that the partnership would allow both PointsBet and Playfly to elevate their respective brands and achieve broader recognition as well as fulfill important milestones in preparing sports fans and college athletes for a future in which sports betting plays a central part.</p>
<p>PointsBet has been present in Maryland thanks to a partnership with Riverboat on the Potomac, a licensed satellite facility that offers horseracing, among other entertainment options.</p>
