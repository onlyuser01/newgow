<p>Ahead of the planned opening of its $75 million horse racetrack and entertainment venue in Ashland, Kentucky, Sandy’s Racing &amp; Gaming has announced a new collaboration with the globally recognized betting and gaming company, bet365. Known as a joint venture between the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians and Revolutionary Racing Kentucky, Sandy’s Racing &amp; Gaming anticipates opening the doors of its venue at some point this autumn.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the new agreement, bet365 will expand its footprint in the United States. Per the new deal, the betting and gaming company is expected to bring exciting offers and promotions for customers in Kentucky. Similar to its other betting operations, the sportsbook is expected to offer live betting, same-game parlay bets, as well as options for streaming different events.</p>
<p>Through the partnership with Sandy’s Gaming &amp; Racing, bet365’s Kentucky operations will mark the sixth state where the company offers its services. The multi-year partnership comes after recently, the state’s regulator, the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission (KHRC), greenlighted bet365’s temporary sports betting license. Along with the leading betting company, other betting behemoths such as DraftKings, FanDuel and BetMGM also secured licenses ahead of the launch of legal sports betting in Kentucky.</p>
