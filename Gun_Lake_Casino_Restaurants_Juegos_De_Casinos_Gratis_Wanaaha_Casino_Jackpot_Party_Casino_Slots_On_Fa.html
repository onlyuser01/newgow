    <h1>Gun Lake Casino Restaurants Juegos De Casinos Gratis Wanaaha Casino Jackpot Party Casino Slots On Fa</h1>

<p>I am writing this to you as a forewarning that I will be taking this matter further and have screenshots and paperwork to forward on to legal representatives to prove you have not acted in the professional manner as you should. I have also contacted a journalist who is more than interested in my story. I have done nothing wrong as far as I am concerned – you had plenty of time to act before I wanted to withdraw but you did not do so as you were probably hoping that I would lose as most of us gamblers eventually do.</p>
<p>You (Gamdom) originally accused me of - collusion, exploitation of loop holes and deliberate cheating, and said I was blacklisted from other casinos too – based on 3rd party information received by your fraud team.</p>
<p>All of which is a fabrication on your behalf. Does this not constitute a breach of my privacy too? Have you not privacy standards to adhere to?</p>
<p>Speaking of privacy I (and friends/family etc) have been barraged by phone calls and messages which you deny are you but seem unlikely to NOT be. I have all that filed too.</p>
<p>Then I am informed of this - "According to the Anti Money Laundering and Anti Financial Crime Regulations.... we are in the unpleasant position to freeze your account and disable the withdrawal option, as per international AML standards indicate."</p>
<p>You have changed your accusations against me at least three times – this is just the latest.</p>
<p>My account remains open and fully operational EXCEPT for the ability to with draw – so I can continue to play at your casino and play the exact games that you have accused me of cheating on (I just did with your full knowledge and of course I lost some of the balance you owe me)</p>
<p>I googled what you should do as a respectable casino if you actually did suspect me of money laundering and it is not what you have done and the reason you have not acted accordingly is because you are just trying to get out of paying what is legally a legitimate win. They come too far apart and infrequently for me to just lay back and say- sure just take my winnings.</p>
<p>I deposited and played on your casino in good faith. I played expecting (as most people would) to be paid if I won. I was not inspecting this treatment and nor do I deserve it.</p>
<p>If I do not get paid my money soon – I will be forced to take this further and I can sling as much mud at you as you have to me.</p>
