    <h1>Casino In Oklahoma Diamond Jo Casino Dubuque Iowa Drake Casino No Deposit Bonus Hollywood Casino Onl</h1>

<p>A month ago, on the 5th of august, I’ve played the game Razor Shark at Luckynova casino. I was playing for some time until the moment I got the bonus round finally. A couple of good rounds in, the game suddenly terminated in my browser. Complete black out of the game, waiting and restarting did not re-continued the game. All was gone. Played bonus spins, as well as upcoming ones. As you might understand, this was extremely frustrating.</p>
<p>I’ve turned to the Casino immediately and they’ve investigated the issue. Quote from the agents: "The issue was identified by the related team and they hardly working on your request." and "It appears that the problems you experienced were a result of recent updates. We’ve identified the source of the issue, and we’re working hard to implement a fix as soon as possible. Everything should be resolved by the nearest time. Once it gets sorted out, we’ll reach out and let you know."</p>
<p>Now one month further in time I hear nothing but that I have to wait and that they can't do anything more for me. They say they're waiting for the gaming provider (Push gaming) to answer. Since the high value spins and the fact that they're completely silenced regarding my issue, it's starting to look really shady. Played bets, entered bonus round, technical failure and no solution whatsoever... Only pointing to people that cannot give updates.</p>
<p>The individual agents are friendly but they keep you off as much as they can and just say it's out of their hands and refer to departments or the gaming provider.</p>
<p>Please help me here. Whether it's with Lucky Nova or Push Gaming. They're failing big time on the issue. I have a lot of chats/emails to share if necessary.</p>
