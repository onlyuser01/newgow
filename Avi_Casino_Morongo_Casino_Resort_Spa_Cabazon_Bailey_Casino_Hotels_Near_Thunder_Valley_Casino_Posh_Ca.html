<p>Following approval by the NJDGE, Amelco will bring its full suite of products to New Jersey, a sixth state for the company.</p>
<p>Amelco Receives Go-Ahead to Launch Full Product in NJ</p>
<p>Amelco is all cleared to launch in New Jersey with the company announcing that its full offer has been cleared for a roll-out in the Garden State and ready to power up betting offers.</p>
<p>The company is set to obtain NJ Department of Gaming and Enforcement’s (DGE) approval, allowing Amelco to add its gaming platform and proprietary Player Account Management (PAM) systems to its sportsbook product in the state.</p>
<p>This puts the number of states where Amelco has operations up and running to six, including Colorado, Indiana, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Tennessee. Previous to the latest approval, Amelco has been involved with Flutter Entertainment and The Stars Group’s sportsbooks in the Garden State.</p>
<p>Now that Amelco has permission to run its entire product line, the company is looking at bigger things. Amelco head of USA Brandon Walker said that the company was delighted to bring its full armory in support of New Jersey customers following the repeal of PASPA.</p>
<p>“We’ve worked closely with the DGE to make sure this product is perfect for the NJ market, and it’s been hugely rewarding to have developed our product with the guidance of one of the US’s true pioneers in bringing online betting to the states,” Walker added.</p>
<p>New Jersey Drives Billion in Sports Handle Monthly</p>
<p>He commended the company’s existing products and said that a new deal was imminent. Amelco’s choice of market is no chance event either. New Jersey proves to be one of the most tempting markets despite the high number of brands competing in it.</p>
<p>With the Garden State’s monthly results reaching $1 billion in sports betting handle, there is plenty of room for new companies to break ground. The company has teamed up with Conduet for its full-scale New Jersey deployment and customer support will be handled within the state, the press release concluded.</p>
