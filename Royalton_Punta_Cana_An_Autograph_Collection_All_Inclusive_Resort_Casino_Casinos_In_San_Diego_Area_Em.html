<p>Tiger Woods is the betting favorite for this week’s Hero World Challenge in the Bahamas despite not playing a competitive round of golf in nearly eight months. Credit the so-called “gamble-oholics” — the swarm of golf fans who bet on him to win whenever the 15-time major winner tees it up — Tiger referred to in 2018.</p>

<p>Played at the ultra-exclusive Albany golf course in New Providence, the tournament benefits the Tiger Woods Foundation, which supports programs that improve the health, education, and welfare of children.</p>
<p>Seventeen players among the 20-person field are ranked inside the top 30 in the world. The exceptions are Woods, Justin Rose, and Lucas Glover, all of whom received special invitations.</p>
<p>Woods hasn’t played a tournament round since April 9 when he withdrew during the third round of the Masters due to injury. Tiger subsequently underwent ankle fusion surgery.</p>
<p>Tiger says his ankle pain is gone and he’s excited to compete. Asked if he thinks he can still win, the 82-time PGA Tour winner answered, “Absolutely.”</p>
<p>Hero World Challenge Odds</p>
<p>On Wednesday, BetMGM revealed to Casino.org that Woods represents its biggest liability for the Hero World Challenge. Woods is responsible for about 16% of its betting slips and 8% of the money wagered on the tournament.</p>
<p>The book isn’t overly concerned with a potential Woods victory, however. To get as much action on Woods as possible, the book has lengthened Woods’ odds despite the flurry of bets on the 47-year-old.</p>
<p>Woods’ odds have gone from opening at 40/1 to 66/1. On the current line, a winning $100 bet would net $6,600.</p>
<p>Woods has never won at Albany, but Viktor Hovland has. The two-time defending champion has the overall shortest odds this week at just 4/1.</p>
<p>Hovland, the fourth-ranked player on the planet, is on nearly 9% of the BetMGM bets and is responsible for 22% of the money bet.</p>
<p>Bettors also like Cameron Young. BetMGM says Young is its second-largest liability behind Woods. Young accounts for over 24% of the Hero World Challenge handle. His line has shortened because of the action from 25/1 to 18/1.</p>
<p>After Hovland, Scottie Scheffler, the world’s top-ranked player, has the second-shortest odds at 9/2 (+450). Scheffler has finished second in each of the previous two Hero World Challenges. Scheffler is on 5.4% of the BetMGM tickets but is responsible for just 3.5% of the money wagered.</p>
<p>Rounding out the top five in terms of shortest odds are Collin Morikawa at 15/2, Max Homa at 8/1, and Justin Thomas at 14/1.</p>
<p>A best-case scenario for BetMGM would be a victory from Keegan Bradley, Jason Day, Brian Harman, Justin Rose, or Sepp Straka. Each of those players has generated less than 1% of the handle.</p>
<p>Rusty Woods</p>
<p>Woods said he “loves playing” and is excited to be back.</p>
<p>What drives me is that I love to compete,” Woods said. “There will come a time, I haven’t come around to it yet, fully, that I won’t be able to win again. When that day comes, I’ll walk.”</p>
<p>As for this week, Woods is managing his expectations.</p>
<p>“My game feels rusty. I haven’t played in a while,” Woods conceded. “I’m excited to compete and play, and I’m just as curious as all of you are to see what happens because I haven’t done it in a while.”</p>
