    <h1>Downstream Casino Joplin Mo Lake Worth Casino Show Boat Casino Diamond Jo Casino Worth Raging Bull C</h1>

<p>Dear Alprince2001,</p>
<p>Thank you for contacting us. I have checked the casino’s website for options to close an account and unsubscribe from all correspondence with the casino and its services, and this is what I found https://driftcasino.com/en/info/terms:</p>
<p>"8.4. Self-Exclusion</p>
<p>8.4.1. If you feel that you are becoming addicted to gambling, you should consider limiting your access to your account. We have measures in place to ensure that as soon as your self-exclusion request is processed, you will no longer be able to play at Avento MT Limited and you will not be able to access your account until your period of limitation has elapsed. Please make sure to withdraw all the funds held in your account prior to making a self-exclusion request. For further information on withdrawals, please refer to Section 5 of these Terms and Conditions. Should you still have a balance in your account after requesting self-exclusion, our Customer Support team will pay out any remaining funds. We retain the right to request all the necessary documentation for this purpose. Any self-exclusion due to the reason of addiction shall extend to all accounts held by you with any website owned by Avento MT Limited. Where a player is self-excluded on one of our websites and registers on another website owned by Avento MT Limited during the said self-exclusion period, we retain the right to immediately close the account and return any deposits minus any amount which has already been withdrawn by you.</p>
<p>Should you have any questions you may contact our customer service at support@driftcasino.com"</p>
<p>I would recommend sending an email including all the relevant information to the abovementioned email address. In this way, you’ll have proof of such action. Specify in the request for how long you wish your account to be closed and clearly state the reason why. Additionally, email "Subject" should be clearly marked and easily recognizable as casino support receives many requests per day hence, if it’s visibly marked you stand a better chance to have your request granted as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Lastly, I would also recommend contacting your payment provider/bank since you don't share your payment details with the casino directly but with the payment processor. To put it another way, blocking your casino account may not be enough if your bank details have been compromised.</p>
<p>Please, let me know if you need any assistance and keep me updated. Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
