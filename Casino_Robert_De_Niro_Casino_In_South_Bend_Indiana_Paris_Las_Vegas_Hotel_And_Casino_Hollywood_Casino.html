    <h1>Casino Robert De Niro Casino In South Bend Indiana Paris Las Vegas Hotel And Casino Hollywood Casino</h1>

<p>I have told the operators that I have gambling problems and gambling addiction before, but they still open my account again, I have lost over 2735 euros and they are everything from loans. If they care about gambling problems, why did they reopen my account even though they know I have a gambling problem? I have told all casinos, www.hellocasino.com. www.casimba.com, dreamvegas.com, spinrider.com, but still I could play at casinos there.</p>
<p>After my account was opened I could play at all their casinos, they tell me that I have not even had an account at casinos with them. So it is clear that they have deleted all old chats with me and my old account, I ask them how is it possible that you let me play even though you know I have a game problem but they deny that I have ever had one account at one of their casinos, but I have a screenshot where the chat opens my account.</p>
<p>I have had gambling addiction problems for a long time so I have written to all casinos to shut me down and that I have gambling problems so they can not possibly know about them.</p>
<p>they can not say that I have not had a cone with them when they open a new account with them.</p>
<p>I have taken a loan to play here, it hurts my body every day, I can not sleep or eat. I have a gambling problem and they take full advantage of it. Please help me because they do not respect me a bit, maybe they can respect you.</p>
<p>Luckily, I took a screenshot of the chat</p>
