<p>Dear ΘΩΜΑΣ,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. Please understand, that we can’t penalize the casino for taking away your privilege receiving further bonuses. I have checked terms and conditions, and this is what I found https://casino.netbet.gr/help/terms-and-conditions/terms-conditions:</p>
<p>"26.26 The NETBET reserves the right</p>
<p>to designate a Player "Hunter Premium"</p>
<p>if at the sole discretion of the judge that the player has abused</p>
<p>promotional programs offered by NETBET (including</p>
<p>and promotional programs of our business partners), including, but</p>
<p>not restrictively, in the following cases:</p>
<p>26.26.1 The Player uses only</p>
<p>bonus coupons to play from his Account.</p>
<p>26.26.2 The amount corresponding to the bonus coupon</p>
<p>exceeds the total deposits of the Player.</p>
<p>26.26.3 The Player plays or attempts to play with</p>
<p>more than one bonus per 24 hours.</p>
<p>26.26.4 The Player bets € / $ / £ 200 or</p>
<p>more on a premium coupon without having made any deposits into his</p>
<p>Account.</p>
<p>26.26.5 The Player participates in the games exclusively</p>
<p>with the use of bonuses, while withdrawing from his Account all the</p>
<p>minimum deposits that gave him access to the promotions, or</p>
<p>26.26.6 The Player repeatedly uses a</p>
<p>promotion.</p>
<p>26.27 When NETBET has designated a Player</p>
<p>as a "Premium Hunter", the Player will no longer benefit from promotional bonuses and NETBET reserves the right</p>
<p>to seal or cancel his Account and any</p>
<p>transactions related to the Account."</p>
<p>I’m not claiming that you’ve abused your privilege in the past, only suggesting that it might be a possible reason. Could you please forward all the relevant communication between you and the casino to petronela.k@casino.guru? Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards, Petronela</p>
