<p>The prominent supplier and developer of established online casino content, 7777 gaming, has revealed this week that it has expanded its offer to the Georgian market. A total of 100+ games will now be available to local partners, the company has confirmed in a press release shared on its LinkedIn profile, via email, and on its official website.</p>
<p>Georgia is an important jurisdiction to 7777 gaming as it bears many similarities to other markets in which the supplier has been operating. One notable resemblance is how close Georgia is to the Balkans where the company has had success in supplying local companies with the products that they need to differentiate their offers. Romania has been one of its target markets over the past months.</p>
<p>Something similar is expected to take place in Georgia as well. Locally, casino brands will have the chance to significantly strengthen their libraries and propositions. 7777 gaming is the author of many different game genres, including slots, table, instant win, keno &amp; bingo titles. The company is similarly developing themed games and experiences to offer even more worthwhile opportunities to players.</p>
<p>Some of its most notable games are Club Mr. Luck, Bucks Detective, Zeus Quest, and Crystal Palace Joker. The partnership was hailed by Elena Shaterova, 7777 gaming’s own Chief Commercial Officer, who was also excited about this move into the Georgian market.</p>
<p>She called it "the next logical step" in the company’s expansion. "We look forward to partnering with the online operators in Georgia, that would like to differentiate on the market and win the hearts and the minds of their players with innovative, creative, and engaging games such as ours," Shaterova said.</p>
<p>7777 gaming has been growing its international footprint rapidly. Although the company has a very clear and established presence in the Balkans, it has been developing rapidly elsewhere as well.</p>
<p>The supplier teamed up with Offside Gaming in Chile and Ecuador, allowing it to further expand its reach. The company has not relied only on single-brand injections and partnerships, agreeing to establish aggregation partnerships as well in a bid to strengthen its positions in regulated markets. Most recently, a tie-up like this was signed up with 1GameHUB.</p>
