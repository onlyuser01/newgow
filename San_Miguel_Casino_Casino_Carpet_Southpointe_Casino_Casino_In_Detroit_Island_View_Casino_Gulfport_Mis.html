<p>How do cashback bonuses work?</p>
<p>A cashback bonus is a percentage rate, usually around 5-25% of total net losses for a given period or from a given game, which is credited back to your account.</p>
<p>Sometimes it’s in the form of real money, but more often it will be in the form of a bonus credit. You will need to rollover the bonus again. In contrast with free spins or deposit bonuses, you will need to rollover it fewer times (max. 10-times). Individual conditions between casinos can, of course, vary. A maximum cashback amount is also often specified.</p>
<p>The cashback amount is usually calculated from your deposit. So, the winnings from no deposit bonuses do not qualify for a cashback. Many casinos also require players to have a balance of either zero or less than $5, for example. So if you deposit $2,000 and lose $1,000, you won’t qualify for a cashback. A cashback bonus can't be combined with any other bonuses. Therefore, when you are clearing your deposit bonus, you do not qualify.</p>
<p>We will explain it all with the following examples. An imaginary casino offers a weekly cashback of 20% with a €50 limit.</p>
<p>Player A - In the last week the player lost €200, therefore 200 x 0,2 = €40 will be returned to the player’s account</p>
<p>Player B lost €400. The player should get a bonus of €80 (400 x 0,2), but because there is a maximum limit set, only €50 will be returned to their account.</p>
<p>Special variants of cashback bonuses</p>
<p>Top up bonus is the exact opposite of a classic cashback bonus. You have won, and in addition, you get a bonus from your net winnings for a given time period, or from a given game. However, the bonus percentage is lower, most often 3-10%.</p>
<p>Even rarer is the bonus on total bets. In this case, you get a fixed percentage from your total bets in a game. It doesn’t matter if you won or lost. With this bonus, you can get decent sums, as wins and losses aren’t netted. If you can find a bonus on total bets through short term promotions on a certain game, do use it.</p>
<p>The same recommendation goes for any type of cashback bonus, since it is always a net gain for you. Cashback bonuses lower the casino’s advantage - that’s why it is an important factor in finding the ideal casino for you.</p>
