<p>Stakelogic Live has further expanded the reach of its live casino solutions by teaming up with One Casino for the delivery of its advanced studio platform and environment</p>
<p>Moving forward, One Casino will be the second operator to benefit from the Chroma Key Studio, an exciting concept that allows operators to significantly increase the quality of the products they end up offering to their customers.</p>
<p>One Casino Gets Serious Live Casino Boost with Chroma Key</p>
<p>One Casino is now set to transform its live casino vertical and experience with the help of the Chroma Key Studio, which is focused on the Dutch market, and has been one of the most important ones to live operators. Previously, Stakelogic Live launched its solution with 711.nl in August.</p>
<p>Thanks to Stakelogic Live’s flexible solution, operators are able to introduce their branding onto table games such as Absolute Blackjack and European Roulette, making the experience more captivating and worthwhile for both the operators involved as well as their players.</p>
<p>One Casino is happy to be benefiting from this same technology and treatment, providing it with the same level of tailored experiences, brand recognition and personalization that make live casino experiences even more noteworthy. One Casino runs powerful mobile and desktop casinos that make it possible for the brand to stay competitive and deliver innovative and hard-hitting solutions to its audiences.</p>
<p>Olga Bajela, CCO at Stakelogic Live, has welcomed the opportunity to see the Chroma Key Studio introduced to yet another prominent partner brand. Bajela added:</p>
<p>The studio empowers operators with unmatched table customization, facilitating unique and immersive player experiences. We extend a warm welcome to One Casino to our Chroma Key Studio, as it embarks on delivering captivating and deeply branded experiences to its players. Olga Bajela, CCO at Stakelogic Live</p>
<p>Appealing to the Dutch Player Bases with Live Casino</p>
<p>She was joined by One Casino CEO Mark Schram who was similarly excited to strengthen his brand’s live casino experience in the Netherlands, a country that clearly appreciates this type of content and is ever keener on growing it across the board.</p>
<p>“Harnessing Stakelogic Live’s Chroma Key Studio empowers us to achieve this, forging a connection between our brand and our players. This step strengthens confidence and reinforces One Casino’s position as the ultimate hub for live content in the Dutch market,” Schram said.</p>
<p>This new deal comes shortly after Stakelogic appointed Dejan Loncar to the role of Head of Live Casino, succeeding Richard Walker.</p>
