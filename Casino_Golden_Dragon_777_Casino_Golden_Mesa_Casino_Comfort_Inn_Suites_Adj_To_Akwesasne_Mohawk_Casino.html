<p>The leading provider of content for the iGaming industry, Wazdan, confirmed that it was shortlisted in eight categories within the Women in Gaming Diversity Awards. The iGaming developer revealed that it has been nominated for six different team or company awards such as Best Diverse Place to Work, Diverse and Inclusive Team, Company of the Year, Employee Wellbeing Award, B2B Excellence, as well as Excellence in Customer Service.</p>
<p>Besides the aforementioned nominations, Izabela Słodkowska-Popiel has been nominated for The Outstanding Mentor Award, while Magdalena Wojdyła has been shortlisted for Excellence in Customer Service – Supplier Award. The nominations reaffirm Wazdan's efforts toward diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), a framework that many gambling industry companies dedicate efforts.</p>
<p>Michal Imiolek, Wazdan's CEO, shared his excitement about the recent announcement in a statement. He said: "We pride ourselves on being a forward-looking, diverse workplace and we're incredibly humbled to be shortlisted in no less than eight categories at the Women in Gaming Diversity Awards." Finally, he noted: "It's a fantastic event that celebrates the work that women do in our industry, and congratulations to all those nominated."</p>
<p>The nominations follow a positive momentum gained recently by Wazdan. In fact, the company was recently shortlisted for other famous iGaming industry events such as the EGR B2B Awards, CasinoBeats Game Developer Awards, as well as SBC North America Awards.</p>
<p>Women in Gaming Diversity Awards launched more than a decade ago, back in 2010. The awards seek to recognize organizations and individuals for their "outstanding devotion to enhancing equality, diversity and inclusion." This year's Awards are scheduled to take place on June 8, 2023, at a glamorous ceremony that will be taking place at The Savoy Hotel in London, UK.</p>
<p>The nomination comes on the heels of another important announcement from Wazdan. Recently, the company confirmed it signed a content deal with 8888.bg, a popular gambling operator in Bulgaria. Per the terms of the collaboration, Wazdan expanded the reach of its content in Bulgaria. In fact, the collaboration marked the fifth deal with a Bulgaria-based operator.</p>
<p>Teaming up with 8888.bg, Wazdan agreed to deliver many fan-favorite games for the company. As a result, customers of the operator gained access to popular titles such as Fortune Reels, 9 Coins, Magic Spins, and more engaging games from Wazdan.</p>
<p>Before that, late last month, the company signed a partnership with Bally's Interactive. The collaboration saw Wazdan deliver its portfolio of games for the company's online gambling brand Vera&amp;John.</p>
