    <h1>Niagra Falls Casino Bjs Casino Mainstreet Casino Casinos In Alabma Tennessee Casino Slottica Casino</h1>

<p>Casino Slottica has stopped making withdrawals!!!!!!!! 14 days have passed since the funds were not withdrawn, the casino itself cites difficulties with visa and mastercard methods. Previously, on this site, I withdrew funds, there were delays, but for 14 days this would be the first time. I believe that this casino, under the guise of some difficulties, simply deceives me and does not withdraw funds !!!!! They don’t provide me with other withdrawal methods, it’s impossible to withdraw to crypto wallets, not to some other ones !! They explain that now there are such difficulties everywhere, and here I do not agree with them, because where I play, I take them out everywhere and there are no such problems. My profile is verified, I have withdrawn funds on this site more than once. I also have a personal personal Manager whose name is Maxim, and so this very personal manager does not give any terms for solving such a problem, only for 14 days I hear the same thing. I ask you to intervene in this situation and evaluate such actions. When communicating today with the Manager, I frankly admitted that I believe that I was simply deceived and reluctantly carry out this conclusion. I think if the site is good and values its reputation, then in this case they will look for a way out of this situation, but what I see is that Casino Slottica is not trying to solve this problem. There are no reasons for not giving away the winnings, and there cannot be! And besides, in this casino there are no other methods for me to withdraw funds. I ask you to look into this situation immediately. This could be considered a scam! From the site of Casino Slottica!!!!!</p>
