<p>I'm having trouble downloading the bookmaker Winbet in question</p>
<p>a hell of a serious attitude and a lot of wrongdoing on their part.</p>
<p>After having verified my account and successfully completed a bunch of checks and documents, I received a message in the email so you can see for yourself what its employee is clearly and legibly quoting -</p>

<p>(WinBet Online) Aug 27, 17:01 EEST Hello, radi1811! We're writing to let you know that your account has been successfully verified and you can now download unlimited downloads. A bank card ending in 3559 has been verified but remains blocked on deposits on our site as unfortunately we no longer accept deposits with foreign bank cards. You need to use your own means of payment for both deposit and withdrawal. Please note that a card ending in 4011 is verified but remains blocked until it is verified in all accounts.</p>
<p>First they say that I can withdraw, but in fact, finally I can't .. withdraw my own money and keep my money in the account with the excuse that it was deposited with a debit card which is owned by my grandfather in other accounts, but this is my business. does not concern me at all after I have sent all the documents needed to verify my account and all completed declarations, and I am not directly affected by who else deposited with the same card after I made my last deposit at the cash desk and not my problem at all is played after me all my immaculate, I agree that I have no guilt in this case.</p>
<p>I just want the money that is rightfully mine, I am not mistaken by who else has deposited with my grandfather's card and I cannot guess who it is to go looking for him to verify his account.</p>
<p>As for my case, I am terribly affected by their behavior, their attitude towards clients, and their attempt to keep my money, which is rightfully my own, and they refuse to pay them to me from their online site.</p>
<p>My username is radi181.</p>
<p>I hope that the competent measures are taken and my question is considered, because I am terribly affected by their attitude and that they do not want to pay me the amount that is still in my account. The amount is 199.90 BGN.</p>
