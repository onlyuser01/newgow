    <h1>River City Casino Hotel St Louis Potowatomi Casino Phoenix Casino Hotels Parker Az Casino Islandview</h1>

<p>The fresh alliance forged in February between FBM Digital Systems (FBMDS), the company that wishes to become the primary supplier of customized technology for the iGaming industry, and Entain, one of the most successful gaming and sports betting groups on the planet, will expand on five continents.</p>
<p>70+ FBMDS Games to Reach Global Markets</p>
<p>The company, which is fully committed to boosting its portfolio of products, increasing client satisfaction, and creating better overall experiences for players, wishes to harness Entain’s network to support its growth in a number of markets in Europe and the LatAm region. The freshly sealed strategic content distribution agreement will lead to the global distribution of a rich portfolio consisting of more than 70 FBMDS popular online casino games.</p>
<p>The list will include slots like Aloha!, Neptunian Riches, Royal Trucks 243 Ways, Roman Adventure 50 Lines, Fruit Picnic and Viking Journey, along with table games like Jacks or Better, Deuces Wild, Sic Bo Macau, and Blackjack Bonus. The same portfolio will also feature a series of video bingo games like Multi Mega Bonus, Golden Metropolis, Power Pick Lotto, and Catch the Gold, among others.</p>
<p>All games were introduced to the public during the prestigious ICE London 2023 event under “disruptive decor and engaging game displays.” The FBM and FBMDS’ booth displayed the “Play like a champion!” motto and invited guests to get acquainted with the eye-catching casino universe as envisioned by the company.</p>
<p>Sustainable Growth for Both Brands</p>
<p>The new alliance is expected to generate exciting growth possibilities for both parties. FBMDS, which has already proven its rich know-how from its many years of operation in the brick-and-mortar gambling segment, will help Entain use its impressive network of successful brands to cover FBMDS’ primary operating markets.</p>
<p>At the same time, Entain’s network will introduce FBMDS to different player profiles ready to be conquered in new markets, including Spain, Portugal, Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico. These are the priority markets included in the new content distribution contract.</p>
<p>Entain holds licenses to operate in dozens of countries spread across five continents. At the start of the year, the group announced an acceleration of its exit plans from several unregulated markets where the idea of domestic regulation was no longer in the books.</p>
<p>During the same month of January, MGM Resorts was reportedly considering a takeover bid for Entain, the company that is currently worth £8.9 billion ($11.1 billion). Several years ago, the same US giant offered around $10 billion to take over Entain.</p>
