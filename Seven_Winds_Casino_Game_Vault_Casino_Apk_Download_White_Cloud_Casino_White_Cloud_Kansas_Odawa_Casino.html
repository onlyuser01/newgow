    <h1>Seven Winds Casino Game Vault Casino Apk Download White Cloud Casino White Cloud Kansas Odawa Casino</h1>

<p>Hello Michal, I'm not sure how much I'm supposed to contact the casino with the open complaint I have, but anyway, you are being assignee to my case so I don't know what else to say to the Casino, other than I still have not received my payment in my coinbase wallet receive account, I sure hope that the casino follows thru with my payment, I really like Raging Bull Slots and see that they have a good reputation, so hopefully you can help me receive my payment, and if they cannot do it by bitcoin, I will be glad to have any optional payment method, and so my deposit was a bitcoin deposit of $32, no coupon of any kind used, so I hit a jackpot and have no requirements to play through etc no max payout, just a money deposit and I don't like all the coupon restrictions, so I'm getting to where I don't even want to use them, bit once in a while, but nor this time, and hoping the casino will do the right thing, because they are a legit and good casino, but their responses are very slow, so, will you now be contacting the casino, Raging Bull Slots on my behalf? Thanks for taking my case! I have been patient waiting for this payment, and I sent my receive bitcoin address again to them, the last time I contacted them was as you can see on my replies was March 28th like 4:58 am and have had no word back as of 11:30pm Sunday night April 02/23 when I sent my Coinbase bitcoin wallet bitcoin address to the casino to send my bitcoin payment, thank you, and I'm hoping you will be my guide to getting my payment and hoping all comes out well, and I hope the casino continues having a good casino reputation, Thanks again, Doyle F</p>
