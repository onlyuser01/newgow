    <h1>Beau Rivage Casino Casinos In Minnesota With Hotels Casino Bonus Ohne Einzahlung Mill Casino Vegas C</h1>

<p>Dear Level Up,</p>
<p>the expression you used " if this need arises" does not find any valid justification in the closure of a regular game account, necessity by virtue of what then? I also add that the contractual clause you cited appears to be exclusively vexatious as a serious casino that respects itself closes a gaming account only if it has well-founded evidence of fraud and not for futile reasons , otherwise this recall turns out to be illegitimate and in contrast with the basic rules of the online game that provides TRANSPARENCY AND FAIRNESS and with world democratic principles regardless of what the casino writes on a gaming contract (the casino could also write that donkeys fly and I accept it, but we know that donkeys do not fly until proven otherwise and therefore this contract would be void in all respects!), facts which in the present case are totally lacking. Closing a game account simply for the fact that a player wins is contrary to these principles and therefore it is to be considered an illegitimate fact and subject to reporting to the Government Authority of Curacao, which I will do in the near future. The rules apply to everyone, including players and casinos, and must respect the principle of fairness which is the basis of any democracy worthy of the name. Finally, I congratulate you on the excellent figure you are making in front of thousands of players, not only with the undersigned who reads you. Petronela can you please indicate me the email (s) of the regulatory bodies where I can report this modus operandi ? GCB? Minister of Justice and Finance? I've already written to Gaming Licensing. Mine is purely a matter of principle, I can play elsewhere on sites that are much better and respectful of their customers. Thank you.</p>
