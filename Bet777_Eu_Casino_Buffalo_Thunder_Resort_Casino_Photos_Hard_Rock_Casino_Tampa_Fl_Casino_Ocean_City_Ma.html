<p>Online sports betting and casino gaming company Rush Street Interactive (RSI) announced today a new arrangement for its BetRivers.com and PlaySugarHouse.com brands with former NBA star Joakim Noah.</p>
<p>Match Made in … Chicago</p>
<p>Chicago-based RSI and the former Chicago Bulls player Noah agreed to a brand and content partnership deal that will see the popular player provide weekly videos and other exclusive content for BetRivers. Videos will feature basketball reactions and commentary on his life, as well as his involvement with charities.</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to have a former Chicago Bull join our BetRivers family. Joakim Noah will bring his love, passion, and knowledge of basketball to help create a more engaging betting experience for our players.” Richard Schwartz, CEO, RSI</p>
<p>Noah’s involvement under the agreement will include his presence across various media outlets at multiple locations of the BetRivers brand where he will be available for interviews and to create “on the scene” videos for fans. He will also feature through BetRivers’ marketing campaign on television, radio and advertising billboards.</p>
<p>“Joining with BetRivers to create content for Chicago and beyond is a great way to connect with fans and to spread the word about Noah’s Arc Foundation and the positive impact we can have on the city’s youth. I look forward to joining the team to enhance the betting experience while sharing my passion for basketball.” Joakim Noah</p>
<p>Established in 2010 by Noah and his parents, prominent tennis player and former world #3 Yannick Noah and former Miss Sweden and renowned sculptor Cécilia Rodhe, Noah’s Arc Foundation uses sports and art to reach out to kids and give them opportunities to create positive changes with themselves and within their communities.</p>
<p>Positive Effect Outside of Illinois</p>
<p>With a huge fan base among the “Gator Nation” having won two NCAA Championships in 2006 and 2007 with the Florida Gators, Noah’s involvement with RSI will also have a positive effect on the operator’s brand awareness outside of Chicago and Illinois, especially in the light of the ongoing NCAA March Madness.</p>
<p>The exclusive content deal with the former Chicago Bull Noah is the latest development around RSI and the operator’s efforts to boost its brands’ awareness nationwide since entering 2022. In mid-January, the online gaming and sports entertainment firm hired former professional baseball manager and player Bobby Valentine in a brand ambassador capacity.</p>
<p>The former New York Mets manager agreed to participate in the creation of the exclusive network and social media content for the BetRivers and PlaySugarHouse brands, including a weekly Major League Baseball video, podcast, TV, and radio interviews.</p>
