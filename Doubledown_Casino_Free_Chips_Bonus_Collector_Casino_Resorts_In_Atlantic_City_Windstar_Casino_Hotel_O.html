<p>Bragg Gaming is expanding its geographical reach with a new license from the Bahamas. The company is officially a certified supplier of iGaming products under any market covered by the Bahamas moving forward which will effectively allow it to provide its products in the country.</p>
<p>Bragg is fast-expanding its reach of products, with its latest moves in the Netherlands and Greece proving a success. Both of these markets have tough regulations in place which means that suppliers must go above and beyond to comply with a regulatory framework that puts consumers first.</p>
<p>Commenting on this opportunity, Bragg CCO Chris Looney said that the country offered a unique opportunity for the suppliers to expand its footprint and strike home with new demographics:</p>
<p>“This latest license award furthers our global growth strategy and for a market that is one of several that we expect to go live in over the balance of this year.” Bragg CCO Chris Looney</p>
<p>The company recently posted its full-year results for 2021 expecting an even better 2022 ahead. The supplier has been actively focusing on pursuing new markets opportunities and delivering products through a targeted approach that allows it to analyze whether demand for its products would justify the investment.</p>
<p>So far, the company’s strategy has been to focus entirely on markets that have to do with clear-cut regulation. While some companies have remained hesitant about the Dutch and Greek markets, Bragg has decided to put its money where strong industries thrive based on established and unambiguous rules.</p>
<p>In February, Bragg appointed Lara Falzon as its new president and COO as the company seeks to respond to its growth ambitions.</p>
