<p>Betfred Group’s wholly-owned American subsidiary Betfred Sports has teamed up with We-Ko-Pa Casino Resort in Arizona to provide a mobile sports betting app. The sportsbook that currently operates more than 1,500 betting shops across the United Kingdom had previously launched in Arizona at the end of January. Now, their branded app will provide bettors from any part of the state with the opportunity to make seamless bets using their devices.</p>
<p>Betfred Customers to Place Bets on Professional and College Sports Events</p>
<p>All Betfred Sports customers who will use the new app compatible with Android and iOS devices will get access to a large number of options for college and professional sports events. They will also receive updates in real-time on a number of available bets ranging from parlays, straight and in-play bets, or teasers. Newcomers will be rewarded with a $3,000 welcome bonus package when registering a new account within the app. Last October, Betfred Sports partnered with the Paragon Casino Resort in Louisiana by launching the Draft Room sportsbook inside the resort.</p>
<p>Betfred’s partner SCCG Management will assist the sportsbook and secure its access to the sports betting market in Arizona within the We-Ko-Pa Resorts. SCCG Management is a consultancy company that handles everything from iGaming to sports betting and marketing, affiliate marketing, and more.</p>
<p>We-Ko-Pa Casino Resort Will Host a New Retail Sportsbook</p>
<p>At the moment, the We-Ko-Pa Sports &amp; Entertainment Sports Bar is hosting a sports betting station running Thursday through Sunday. According to the new agreement, the two groups will build a new retail sportsbook that will be hosted by the We-Ko-Pa Casino Resort. The sportsbook venue may open its gates to customers at the end of the summer.</p>
<p>Betfred Group was founded by the Done brothers five and a half decades ago. Betfred USA Sports was created in 2019 in Las Vegas and its main goal was to penetrate the American market for sports betting. Last September, Betfred USA expanded its partnership with Paysafe with the Income Access tool.</p>
<p>Betfred USA Sports is the sportsbook sponsor of the Colorado Rockies and the Denver and it currently holds a license to operate in several US states, including Colorado, Arizona, Louisiana, and Iowa. At the moment, Virginia and Nevada are pending their official licensing approval.</p>
