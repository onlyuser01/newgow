    <h1>Caesars Palace Hotel Casino Clams Casino Musician Casinos In Tulsa Oklahoma Empire City Casino Yonke</h1>

<p>Hi there</p>
<p>I have tried everything to get this casino talking, but they no longer respond to my inquiries.</p>
<p>I am registered as a gambling addict with Mirage Corporation, which means that I should not be able to register with any of the online casinos that they own - including Goldenline Casino. Still, Goldenline let me register with exactly the same personal information that is provided to Mirage Corporation. They refuse to be owned by Mirage Corporation despite being the owners of their website. I have sent the casino the email that I once sent to Mirage Corporation, just as I have also sent them a confirmation from Mirage Corporation showing that they have excluded me from all of their online casinos. After I posted this, I have not heard from the Casino, and if you contact them on live chat, they just think it's my own fault and I could just stop playing. I actually agree with them, but it's not easy to stop when you're addicted to gambling, and it was precisely to prevent myself from gambling that I once asked Mirage Corporation and to exclude myself.</p>
<p>I do not believe that Goldenline casino lives up to the rules regarding responsible gambling and that I am therefore entitled to be reimbursed for the loss I suffered by gaining access to their casino.</p>
<p>If desired, I can of course forward all emails in the case. I have attached the confirmation from Mirage Corporation. Be aware here that when I address them it is regarding another casino, but that is the case subordinate.</p>
