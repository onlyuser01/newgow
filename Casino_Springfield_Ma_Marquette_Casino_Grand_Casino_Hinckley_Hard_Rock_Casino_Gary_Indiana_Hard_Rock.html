<p>NASCAR has introduced FanDuel, one of North America’s leading sportsbooks and gaming companies, as its Authorized Gaming Operator, as part of a new multi-year partnership. NASCAR has been looking to raise its profile with new and existing fans, and this tie-up with FanDuel makes it possible to embark on new activations and engagement opportunities.</p>
<p>FanDuel will focus on promoting betting to crowds and also raise the competition’s profile with the brand’s existing consumer base. Commenting on this opportunity, NASCAR Managing Director of Sports Betting Joe Solosky said that the organization was very happy to partner with a sportsbook that brings best-in-class gaming and called the alliance a huge win for NASCAR and motorsports fans.</p>
<p>"We can’t wait to work with FanDuel to deliver our fans more engagement opportunities and expand our sports gaming offerings," Solosky added. FanDuel Strategic Partnerships VP Clifton Ma was similarly pleased to see this partnership shape up. He hailed NASCAR’s commitment to drive stronger and better engagement with fans and create more worthwhile and memorable experiences for everyone involved.</p>
<p>"We’re thrilled to partner with the premier racing organization in North America and continue to grow its presence in the sports gaming space," Ma added. FanDuel is of course also following consumer trends. NASCAR’s profile has been rising on its platform and among its users, with the overall turnover between 2021 and 2022 notching up a 70% increase.</p>
<p>FanDuel has indeed turned its gaze to NASCAR and followed the competition more closely. This new collaboration will allow both organizations to work together and truly attempt to raise the profile of the sport together in what is shaping up to be a mutually beneficial relationship.</p>
<p>Both FanDuel and NASCAR have been happy to work on their partnership with the partnership also featuring FOX analyst and racing legend himself, Clint Bowyer, who is now going to serve as a FanDuel Ambassador.</p>
<p>NASCAR has already become a member of the American Gaming Association and its Have A Game Plan initiative designed to curb problem gambling and promote healthy consumer behavior. Meanwhile, FanDuel is already present in 19 states which means that NASCAR fans from all over the United States will have the opportunity to place a wager at great odds moving forward.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, NASCAR also selected PrizePicks as the organization’s official Fantasy Sports Partner.</p>
