<p>Commenting on this new opportunity, Nuvei Chair and CEO Philip Fayer welcomed the partnership expansion with 888 and said that the company was determined to assist 888 in its global push, in the United States and beyond. Fayer said that deposits and withdrawals are critical to winning customers in the United States and worldwide, adding:</p>
<p>"Optimizing card payment acceptance is a key component of the cashier experience, and Nuvei has decades of experience supporting operators to maximize their revenue growth."</p>
<p>Thanks to this new tech, 888 players can cash out their money instantly, making for a seamless cashier experience. This is facilitated by the Nuvei Instant Bank Transfer, which is the first payment method in the United States tailored to the needs of the iGaming industry to allow for account-to-account deposits and payouts that happen instantly.</p>

<p>"Nuvei has a rich heritage of enabling iGaming operators to maximize their payments’ performance in regulated markets across the globe," Klivitzky concluded. 888 is continuing to strengthen its operations in the United States, as the company appointed a new Chief Executive Officer recently, with Per Widerström set to assume the role on October 16, 2023.</p>
