<p>Reactoonz 2 review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>The Reactoonz franchise is built around a mix of cartoon monsters many of which have quirky effects on the base gameplay. Reactoonz 2 is thematically very similar to the first one, most of the changes are under the hood in the more complex gameplay.</p>
<p>But for anyone new to the franchise, the little blob-like aliens should be enough to charm you into enjoying the strange and wonderful world they inhabit.</p>
<p>Big wins usually follow filling the Quantumeter to level 3 or 4</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The graphics are one of the key selling points for this Play'n GO's slot. Though they are by no means the only one. All the symbols are tiny aliens, each of which are given as much unique personality as can be crammed into such simple limbless creatures.</p>
<p>The various parts of the screen are all fully animated. The background is a swirling vortex of space colours, the indices around the main reels are surrounded by crackling electricity, glowing lights, or moving meters. The effect is one of constant action, especially once the reels kick off with their complex dance of features and symbols.</p>
<p>The music is a little repetitive in a way that grinds, but the other sound effects are so numerous and charming that unless players leave the game idle on their screens, they shouldn’t have any trouble with it.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Reactoonz 2 expands on the gameplay of the previous iteration of the series. The reels make up a seven by seven grid. Any group of five or more symbols connected horizontally or vertically is a winning group. The bigger the group, the bigger the win.</p>
<p>A cascade feature means that any winning combination is removed from the reels while more symbols drop down from above to replace them.</p>
<p>After each cascade, new winning combinations can be made and removed. If this happens, it triggers another cascade.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>There are three kinds of Wild symbols. The Charged Wild, Energoon Wild, and Electric Wild all substitute for all other symbols. The main difference is in how they come to be on the reels.</p>
<p>An additional symbol, the Uncharged Wild can become an Electric Wild if next to a winning combination or if a Wild pair explosion goes off. Uncharged Wilds appear at random during regular spins. All other Wilds are awarded as part of the bonus systems.</p>
<p>Neighbouring Electic Wild symbols explode after the last cascade, leaving ony Wild symbols behind.</p>
<p>The first bonus system is the Fluctometer which is assigned a random one-eyed monster every spin. If the player gets eleven of that monster in winning combinations that spin, the Fluctometer reaches full charge and adds one, two, or three Electric Wilds to the reels.</p>
<p>Each winning symbol that is part of a group with an Electric Wild adds one "charge" to the other meter: the Quantumeter. The Quantumeter has three levels. Over 55 charges activates level one, releasing four Energoon Wilds onto the reels. If the player gets over 85 charges, then the player gets a 2x2 Energoon Wild.</p>
<p>Level 3 on Quantumeter awards the 3x3 Gargantoon Wild symbol</p>
<p>If the player gets the Quantumeter to level 3, they get a Gargantoon Wild added to the grid. Level 3 triggers a single 3x3 Gargantoon Wild. There is also an extra level 4, which adds a x2 multiplier to all Gargantoon Wins.</p>
<p>After each cascade is finished, the Gargantoon Wild breaks up into first two 2x2 Wilds, then nine 1x1 Wilds. This makes for huge wins and is more or less the equivalent of a Bonus Feature in other games.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.20 up to a maximum of $/£/€100.00 per spin. This is a good range, though real penny-pinching players may need to go elsewhere for their kicks.</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.20%, a little over our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is high, which makes it a great match for our preferred slot machine strategies, especially when combined with the above average RTP. Our slot strategies target the highest possible combination of volatility and RTP.</p>
<p>Full paytable for Reactoonz 2 slot</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>With its charming visuals and varied Gameplay, Reactoonz 2 grabs the attention right away. Great sounds design and a highly energetic animation style keep that attention going. Some players might initially be put off by the complexity of the various features. But in practice this proves simpler that it looks with it all boiling down to just one pair of metrics that the game tracks for the player.</p>
<p>But what really makes us want to stay and play the game is the high volatility, coupled with a solid RTP.</p>
<p>We highly recommend this slot.</p>
