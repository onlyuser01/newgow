    <h1>Hotels Near Winstar Casino In Oklahoma Choctaw Casino Near Me Atlantic City Boardwalk Casinos Best C</h1>

<p>I play the slot game on Leon name Piggy tab. The game is keep tab the piggy bank untill it's broken and got a jackpot. While tap you will get some and lose some but it's okay for me. And then i keep tapping,tapping,tapping untill it's broken and money came out from piggy BUT there is no money came in my account and i don't know what happen so i chat with cs but he said this can't prove that i win jackpot. I must have bet id on my play history. BUT when i check,i see nothing. There is no bet id that show money came in for jackpot BUT i see with my own eye that piggy is broken already so i want to know what happen and need the right answer from them. But the same cs keep asking for bet id so i decide to play this game again and taking video to cs with the same situation,piggy is broken 2nd time!!!as attached!!but no history in my account again. I send vdo to cs but he reply me the same for bet id and didn't give me the reason of what i see for 2 times!</p>
<p>To win the jackpot,piggy must broken. And it's broken 2 times already which i see with my own eye but nothing in my history. I need a good reason what happen and pay compensate that i should get for this kind of situation.</p>
