<p>For the time being, Kortman will serve as the Group’s interim chief financial officer. He assumes the post starting immediately and succeeds former CFO Johan Wilsby who announced his resignation on May 15 and has now passed on the reins.</p>
<p>New CFO to Guide Kindred Group as Company Seeks Permanence</p>
<p>Patrick is an important insider who is well-versed in the company’s inner operations. He has worked closely with the financial department, executive team, and the board of directors, and is familiar with the company’s ethos and shared goals.</p>
<p>In this new position, Kortman is bound to continue bringing value to Kindred Group and its future operations, interim CEO Nils Andén said, signaling resolve and confidence in the future. Andén stated:</p>
<p>I am very pleased that Patrick has agreed to take on the role as Interim CFO at Kindred. Patrick knows Kindred very well and has a vast experience from the financial sector, and he will continue to bring great value to Kindred’s financial operations, to the wider Executive Team, and to the Board as we continue to focus on the strategic review. Kindred Group interim CEO Nils Andén</p>
<p>The appointment of Kortman comes with two additional temporary roles, to wit that of Usha Ganesan as interim chief finance operations officer and Neil Banbury as interim chief commercial &amp; marketing officer. Andén said that he was happy to see the Group continue to operate on a strong foothold, guided by its best and brightest.</p>
<p>Kindred Group Strengthens Operations Across the Board</p>
<p>Previously, Maris Catania, a leader in responsible gambling, announced her leave from the company. The Group, though, has been able to continue and deliver strong results. Recently, the Group was nominated as a top employer in Sweden, holding the distinction for a second year in a row.</p>
<p>Although the company has been projecting strength, it is also facing a small exodus of top-level executives without any further clarifications. The Group is also said to be looking to sell parts of its business, but no further information has been made public regarding this as well.</p>
