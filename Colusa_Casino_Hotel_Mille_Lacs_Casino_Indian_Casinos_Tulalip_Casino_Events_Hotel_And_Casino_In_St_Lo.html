<p>As a result, any businesses that use Nexiux Solutions will be able to leverage Loqate’s state-of-the-art technology and improve player ID verification rates, which are important both to the commercial success of businesses but are also mandatory for ensuring that consumers are protected, and fraudulent entries are shut down as Loqate allows companies to process player address data accurately and correctly.</p>
<p>Loqate is already capable of verifying address data for 250 countries and territories in the world, making it a powerful ally to any company that is looking to strengthen its integrity and onboarding processes in the iGaming and online sports betting industry.</p>
<p>Nexiux Solutions is keen to leverage its own cutting-edge technology with additional third-party solutions that bolster the overall product offering and positioning and make it a more worthwhile product for partner businesses. Commenting on this partnership Nexiux Solutions head of products Rob Verdia commented:</p>
<p>We have built our powerful platform so that it is agile and modular, which allows us to easily integrate solutions from the best providers in the business and that is exactly what we have done with Loqate. Nexiux Solutions head of products Rob Verdia</p>
<p>Verdia noted that player onboarding is an important part of the customer journey and that Nexiux wanted to make sure that it makes it frictionless. The addition of Loqate is an important step in this direction.</p>
<p>“It is partnerships such as this that ensure our product and service offering remains at the cutting edge, providing a superior foundation from which our operator partners can build their online sportsbook and casino brands,” he added.</p>
<p>Big Boost to Operators Seeking to Strengthen Their Offer</p>
