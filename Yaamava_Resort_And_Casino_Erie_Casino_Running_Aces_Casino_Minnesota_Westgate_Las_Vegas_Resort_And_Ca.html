<p>Online gaming group Betsson AB announced its efforts to expand in South America received a boost after signing a strategic agreement to form a joint venture with Big Bola Casinos in Mexico.</p>
<p>Collaboration to Gain Public Trust</p>
<p>Betsson Mexico, the new sports betting and iGaming brand of the Stockholm-listed gaming operator will be offered to players in the country via one of the nation’s federally approved gambling operators under the strategic agreement reached between the parties.</p>
<p>“We are really excited to start this collaboration with Big Bola as we believe they are well suited to help us understand the market better and ensure that our offering not only fits the Mexican culture but also earns the public’s trust.” Jesper Svensson, CEO, Betsson AB</p>
<p>Launched in 1995, Big Bola Casinos employs 1,800 people and operates 20 land-based casinos across the country, including in the state provinces of Santa Fe, Veracruz, Puebla, Sinaloa, and Mexico City DF, offering a variety of slot and live table games, bingo halls, and sports betting. It is perceived by the public as one of the leading gambling groups nationwide.</p>
<p>“Our vision is to provide the best customer experience in the industry and I’m confident that we will manage to replicate this success in Mexico too.” Jesper Svensson, CEO, Betsson AB</p>
<p>According to the agreement for the joint venture, Betsson and its new strategic partner plan to launch the new sports betting and iGaming brand Betsson Mexico by the end of the trading year.</p>
<p>“We are happy that Betsson Group has chosen to partner with us for their operations in Mexico. We believe that our market expertise and their knowledge and experience about online gaming will result in an outstanding product for Mexico.” Emilio Quiros, Director, Operations, Big Bola Casinos</p>
<p>South America Presence</p>
<p>The latest agreement with Big Bola is part of Betsson’s efforts to expand in South America which saw the operator launch the Betsson Colombia sports betting brand after the acquisition of Colombian-based operator ColBet in the summer of 2020.</p>
<p>In addition, Betsson set up new ventures in Brazil and Argentina in expectation of the upcoming launch of regulated iGaming markets in both Latin American countries. Last month, daily fantasy sports operator Scout Gaming launched fantasy games in Brazil in partnership with Betsson.</p>
<p>Betsson’s commitment to safer gambling and social responsibility in the areas where it has operations was confirmed by the establishment of a “goodwill fund” in Mexico, under the group’s corporate social responsibility trust BetssonOne. The operator is adamant it will continue on the path set forth with launches in Colombia and Kenya.</p>
<p>Big Bola Casinos, much like Betsson which supported various initiatives in Malta, Sweden, Hungary, Georgia, and Estonia during the pandemic, believes support for local communities is crucial to operations and will ensure the Fundación Big Bola continues to provide funding for children and youths in Mexico.</p>
