    <h1>Windstar Casino In Okla Station Casinos Soboba Casino Hotel Diamond Reels Casino Mt Airy Casino RAW</h1>

<p>The iGaming supplier will leverage its aggregation solution to deploy its fleet of player-favorite slot games with the respected local operator</p>
<p>RAW iGaming will deploy its content and games through RAW Arena, the dedicated aggregation arm of RAW Group, and make sure that SKS365 players now have access to some of the best products the company has brought to market.</p>
<p>RAW Brings Bespoke Features to Italian Market with SKS365</p>
<p>SKS365 operates Planetwin365 online casino which will now offer players innovative features such as SuperSlice and SuperTracks, with Lucky McGee’s SuperSlice Swirl and SuperTracks Railways slot games respectively.</p>
<p>Both of these features are unique and innovative additions to the rich family of slot gameplay pioneered by RAW iGaming with the sole objective to introduce players to new and worthwhile experiences across the board. Commenting on this partnership opportunity, RAW CEO Tom Wood said:</p>
<p>We’re so delighted to start our RAW Italian adventure with one of the top operators’, SKS365. Amazing to see the SuperSlice dedicated category for Planetwin365 customers and for the continued introduction of RAW to the Italian market. RAW CEO Tom Wood</p>
<p>The opportunity was hailed by SKS365 Chief Commercial Officer Troy Cox who was also pleased with RAW’s innovative focus on high-quality games, which fits the operator’s own ambition for the Planetwin365 brand and is precisely what players have come to expect.</p>
<p>“We believe in the growth of non-traditional games and we are confident that RAW’s SuperSlice titles will gain wide acclaim both among our new and most experienced players,” Cox concluded.</p>
<p>RAW iGaming signed its first clients in December 2022 and made fast strides in acquiring and securing new partnership opportunities, positioning its offers with ever-greater audiences. In January, RAW signed a content alliance with First Look Games, and the company’s efforts to expand its footprint have been continuous ever since.</p>
