<p>Wazdan has outlined its plans for the first quarter of 2023, which will prove a busy period for the company</p>
<p>As one of the leading and most innovative game providers in the iGaming sector, Wazdan is planning to continue on a busy production schedule that will see the company build upon its success of the past year and launch a series of excellent titles into the early months of the new year.</p>
<p>Wazdan Details Ambitious Release Roadmap and Incoming Products</p>
<p>The company has already launched the Power of Sun series, to name the Power of Sun: Svarog slot game released earlier this week. The company is also planning to continue tapping successful game series, one of which is the Hot Slot franchise which the company noted was one of its top-performing collections of products in 2022.</p>
<p>The company will also seek to capitalize on retro themes in its upcoming games and releases, including games such as Hot Slot 777 Stars. Wazdan is planning to launch Hot Slot: 77 Rubies next month, with the game featuring four jackpots and the Magic Respin feature for even better player engagement.</p>
<p>More titles will follow, though, with Hot Slot: Great Book of Magic, Hot Slot: 777 Coins, and Hot Slot: 777 Cash Out already available and prepared to drive player interest and better engagement. There will be more titles coming down the road as well, with more innovative mechanics featured.</p>
<p>ICE London to Feature All of Wazdan’s Upcoming Titles</p>
<p>The company is planning on the release of Mystery Kingdom: Mystery Bells on March 30 which will come with the Hold the Jackpot bonus round and not least – the Cash Infinity mechanic, which the company argues is a strong player-favorite. Wazdan CCO Andrzej Hyla hailed the roadmap and said that the company was thrilled to deliver such impactful products and changes to its portfolio over the next three months.</p>
<p>“After a year of unprecedented commercial success, we feel even more committed to continuing to provide our slot users with an outstanding offering that pushes the boundaries within the industry,” Hyla noted.</p>
<p>For an inside scoop on the new releases, Wazdan also welcomes interested parties to ICE London held from February 7 through February 9. Wazdan is exhibiting at stand N7-420.</p>
