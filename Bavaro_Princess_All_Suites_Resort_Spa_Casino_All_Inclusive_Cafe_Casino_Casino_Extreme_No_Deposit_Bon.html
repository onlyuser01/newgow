    <h1>Bavaro Princess All Suites Resort Spa Casino All Inclusive Cafe Casino Casino Extreme No Deposit Bon</h1>

<p>World records are set almost every day and frankly, you can have a record set for pretty much anything. One such record is for the world’s largest orgy, which supposedly took place in 2006 and involved 500 people.</p>
<p>Another attempt to get even more bang for one’s buck fizzled out with a planned five-day festival of the carnal senses called Sin City 8 ultimately not taking place in 2018, because not enough people showed up.</p>
<p>The event was originally planned to have as many as 1,000 people coming together for the world’s biggest romp, but a few setbacks, including venues turning down the group saucily called Menage Life after the owners found out what the whole thing was actually about.</p>
<p>Yet, Menage Life confirmed back in 2018 that they were able to host “a fairly good event,” all things considered, although the numbers were rather low in the end, with 375 people participating.</p>
<p>The World’s Biggest Orgy – The One That Actually Happened</p>
<p>Orgies are supposed to be a private affair – an exclusive club of sexually adventurous, healthy, and confident people. By no means should they be advertised as something to aspire to, and yet – searches for the world’s bigger orgy have been quite frequent.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, it’s been very hard to pick one good example. The Menage Life group which tried to set the record with 1,000 fell short by more than 700 people, begging the question if there were even enough strangers who would get together in bed – even if it’s for the sake of record-setting.</p>
<p>But don’t worry – there are those who have tried and succeeded.</p>
<p>The clear winner when it comes to the largest orgy that has ever taken place and we know for a fact it did is the fittingly called 500 Person Sex and it’s an adult movie shot in Japan. The movie is 130 minutes in length and directed by Yukitsugu Tsuchiya, and it was released on May 4, 2006.</p>
<p>The video was immediately dubbed “the biggest group sex orgy video” ever recorded, and it definitely made waves. The filming involved 250 couples who were exclusive and the organizers did not expect the couples to swap partners.</p>
<p>500 People Sex, legitimately the world’s biggest orgy in modern history, depicted scenes of foreplay, various sexual intercourse, and mutual masturbation, among others. Saucy!</p>
<p>World’s Biggest Orgy – Final Word</p>
<p>Although the idea of promiscuity is tantalizing to both men and women, the exclusivity surrounding the social contract around sex is still a powerful and valid deterrent to engaging in sex with just anyone.</p>
<p>It’s surprisingly hard to hear about orgies that take place on a scale of hundreds of people, and sometimes even dozens of volunteers would not really be easily available. Whether people feel shame or regret or are only fantasizing about these sex parties without actually being willing to act on these fantasies is difficult to say.</p>
<p>Even sex-positive communities such as Menage Life have fallen short of fulfilling their ambitious goal of bringing enough people together to have at it. Why? Who knows.</p>
<p>FAQ</p>
<p>What is the world’s largest orgy? The world’s largest orgy took place in Japan in 2006. It was part of an adult movie directed by Yukitsugu Tsuchiya and it involved 500 people and 250 exclusive couples. An attempt to improve on this record fell short in 2018. Are there more planned world record orgies? World orgies happen every year, but many of them are private. The most prominent organization that is trying to host such events is Menage Life, which posts updates about sex parties frequently. Can I participate in an attempt to set an orgy world record? Yes, some organizations will allow you to try and participate in an attempt for the world’s largest orgy. However, you may be asked to provide STD and STI screens, including HIV testing before you are allowed to participate. There are very specific social and safety contracts involving men and women at such events, so be prepared to follow the rules de rigor.</p>
