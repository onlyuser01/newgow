<p>Supplier of iGaming content and slots in particular, White Hat Studios, has gone live in the state of Pennsylvania through rollouts of its product portfolio with Borgata and BetMGM. The two operators are the first to benefit from access to White Hat’s titles, and offer them to local players in the Keystone State, the company said in a press release shared via email.</p>
<p>Pennsylvanian players will have access to branded games, such as Deal or No Deal, Ted, and The Goonies, among many other excellent choices. More games that are developed by White Hat Studios to be immediately-recognizable hits include Blackjack Players Choice, Wolf Legend Megaways, and Bankin’ Bacon.</p>
<p>This rollout follows similar launches in other places in the country, notably the company’s first-ever launch on US soil in Michigan. White Hat Studios is not going to stop here either, as the company wants to quickly secure positions in other relevant gaming markets where iGaming has been legalized, to wit New Jersey, Connecticut, and WestVirginia.</p>
<p>White Hat Studios CEO Andy Whitworth was optimistic about the future of the company and the United States in particular. He spoke of the mutual benefits that these partnerships in the Keystone State now helped establish.</p>
<p>On the one hand, players gain access to some of the leading slot games, Whitworth explained, while the iGaming market in Pennsylvania enjoys a greater variety of products with a proven track record. Much of this is also owing to the nature of branded slots.</p>
<p>"The branded titles we have at our disposal are a sure-fire way to attract a new audience, while the mechanics incorporated into our games take the overall narrative of a slot beyond the classic model, introducing players to new and improved experiences," Whitworth concluded.</p>
<p>BetMGM Director of Gaming Oliver Barlett was happy with the partnership and said that the company was excited to bring this unique content to the state. He noted that White Hat Studios' content had already made its mark on Michigan, and BetMGM expected the studio’s titles to deliver the same outstanding results in Pennsylvania as well.</p>
<p>White Hat has been able to launch with a number of operators in Michigan already, including Caesars, FanDuel, WynnBet, DraftKings, and others. The supplier entered Michigan in July 2022. White Hat Studios’ slots also quickly topped Eilers &amp; Krejcik Gaming’s January report with numerous games. This is a remarkable achievement after only six months in the market.</p>
