    <h1>New Instant Withdrawal Casino Boomtown Casino And Hotel In Reno Nevada Harrah S Casino San Diego Cou</h1>

<p>Seeking to better protect lottery consumers, the Netherlands Gambling Authority, Kansspelautoriteit (KSA), announced it launched a new investigation.</p>
<p>Dutch Gambling Regulator Launches New Investigation</p>
<p>The regulator unveiled that the investigation is the result of lottery operators “increasingly adding online game elements to their offer.” Probing into mixing lottery with online gambling, the KSA vowed to take enforcement actions if it finds any violations of the existing regulations or license conditions.</p>
<p>“The Gaming Authority (KSA) sees that lottery providers are increasingly adding online game elements to their offer. The KSA recently started an investigation into this. The KSA takes enforcement action if the law or permit conditions are violated,” reads a statement released by the Kansspelautoriteit</p>
<p>Currently, gambling games in the Netherlands are classified as less risky games and high-risk games. Casino games, slot machines and online games of chance fall under the category of high-risk games, while lotteries are classified as less risky games.</p>
<p>KSA Remains Committed to Protecting Consumers</p>
<p>Under the current gambling regulations, licensees that offer lottery games cannot offer them online. Using the internet, lottery operators are allowed to “sell participation certificates” also referred to as raffle tickets, the KSA explained. However, the regulator pointed out that “offering a game linked to a lottery online is prohibited.”</p>
<p>A prime reason for separating gambling games as risky and less risky is gambling harm. Ultimately, the KSA seeks to protect the consumers, which is why it enforces rules and ensures licensees comply with their license conditions. According to the KSA, people who are interested in less risky games such as lotteries may not engage in risky games, unless invited. The gambling regulator acknowledged that if users are pushed to risky games they may be impacted by gambling addiction.</p>
<p>“Important objectives of the KSA are consumer protection and the prevention of gambling addiction,” explained the Netherlands Gambling Authority</p>
<p>The announcement about KSA’s investigation comes after the regulator warned licensees about the use of “promotional games of chance.” Last week, the Authority reminded gambling operators that such games are regulated by the Code of Conduct for promotional games of chance. It said that while no specific permit is needed, operators must still abide by the existing regulations.</p>
<p>Before that, the KSA reaffirmed it continues the fight against offshore brands and the illegal exploitation of gambling machines. The regulator confirmed it checked 35 locations for possible illegal gambling activities. The checks were completed in different regions such as The Hague, Utrecht and Rotterdam, as well as the provinces of North Brabant and Limburg.</p>
