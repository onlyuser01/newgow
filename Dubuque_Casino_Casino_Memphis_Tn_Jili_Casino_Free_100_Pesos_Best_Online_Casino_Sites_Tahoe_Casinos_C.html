    <h1>Dubuque Casino Casino Memphis Tn Jili Casino Free 100 Pesos Best Online Casino Sites Tahoe Casinos C</h1>

<p>On November 4, 2019 I made a deposit of 25 euros with my Skrill wallet to access the 50 free spin promotion without betting requirements.</p>
<p>Promotional code: WOLF</p>
<p>I played the 50 free spin in the indicated game and then bet on other games.</p>
<p>The result of the bets was a profit of 87.25 euros.</p>
<p>Totaling 112.25 euros in my account, money that was withdrawable (25 euros deposit + 87.25 profit).</p>
<p>On November 4, 2019, I requested the withdrawal of 112.25 euros and the casino system did not allow me to do so, an error screen appeared, and the money was still in my casino account.</p>
<p>At that time I assumed that the error was about .25 cents, so I tried again with 112 euros.</p>
<p>This second request appeared with the message "in process." About 5 hours later, I logged into my casino account to see the status of my application, and I see "canceled"</p>
<p>This is where my claim started with the casino to get an explanation about the canceled request.</p>
<p>It is important to mention that the request was canceled and the money had not returned to my casino account. My account was still without funds.</p>
<p>In the chat they did not know how to answer what had happened, I waited for hours and they replied that they were waiting for the payment department's response.</p>
<p>Finally, they asked me to send a screenshot of my skrill account, and I did so, exposing my confidential and private information, to show them that I had not actually received the money.</p>
<p>They sent me a screenshot of an excel form apparently, where a single line was seen and said that 112.25 euros was deposited in my skrill wallet.</p>
<p>They told me they were going to check again.</p>
<p>I sent them an email and had no response.</p>
<p>I contacted the chat on November 5 and they could not give me an answer on the case either.</p>
<p>Now, when writing this claim I entered my account, and they modified the transaction data that appeared to me as "error", which makes me think that obviously they don't want to take responsibility or make the deposit that corresponds to me.</p>
<p>They operate in bad faith by changing the messages of the transactions</p>
