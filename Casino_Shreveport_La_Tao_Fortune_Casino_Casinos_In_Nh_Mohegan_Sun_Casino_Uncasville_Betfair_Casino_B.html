    <h1>Casino Shreveport La Tao Fortune Casino Casinos In Nh Mohegan Sun Casino Uncasville Betfair Casino B</h1>

<p>Betr, the prominent online sports betting operator that recently launched its real money sportsbook offering in Virginia, announced an important partnership. Betr confirmed Thursday it joined forces with the marketplace technology and media company that caters to the betting sector, WagerWire.</p>
<p>The duo forged a new technology integration and media partnership that is expected to elevate the experiences for sports fans and bettors alike. Thanks to the new collaboration, Betr will benefit from WagerWire’s proprietary tech that delivers options for selling and buying active sports bets.</p>
<p>The innovative functionality is also available for fantasy sports and it will be integrated into Betr’s platform. Once this happens, bettors will be able to trade inside WagerWire and Betr’s mobile applications, delivering elevated thrill and exciting new experiences.</p>
<p>Additionally, the collaboration will help extend the duo’s media divisions. This will complement the exponential growth Betr Media and WagerWire Media Network have seen recently. Overall, Betr’s media division has surpassed 1.3 billion, while WagerWire Media Network surpassed 250 million impressions on social media in the last 10 months.</p>
<p>A true testament to the potential of the media divisions of the two companies is that they were both finalists at the 2023 Hashtag Sports Awards within the Best Sports Betting Content category. Reaffirming the leadership of Betr’s media, the company secured a win from the aforementioned awards. Now, by teaming up, the media divisions of WagerWire and Beter will focus on developing original video series, among other upcoming activations and projects.</p>
<p>The New Deal Brings Excitement to Betr, WagerWire</p>
<p>Joey Levy, Betr’s CEO and founder, revealed that the company is delighted to join forces with WagerWire. He spoke about the perspective that the two companies share, explaining that it represents a unique opportunity to deliver unrivaled experiences for sports fans by leveraging innovative products. “We are looking forward to integrating their technology into our new V1 sportsbook platform being built on top of the recently acquired Chameleon platform, which remains on track to go live next year,” said Levy in conclusion.</p>
<p>“We have great admiration for what Joey Levy, Jake Paul and the entire team at Betr have accomplished as both a gaming operator and media company.“ Zach Doctor, co-founder and CEO of WagerWire</p>
<p>Zach Doctor, WagerWire’s co-founder and CEO, shared Levy’s excitement. He explained that secondary markets have been gaining popularity in trading cards, concert tickets and fashion.</p>
<p>According to Doctor, WagerWire delivers innovative technology that can bring unrivaled experiences for customers. He outlined that wagering on sports should bring the same level of thrill and excitement as sports themselves. Finally, Doctor reiterated that WagerWire is delighted to join forces with Betr and revolutionize the betting vertical.</p>
