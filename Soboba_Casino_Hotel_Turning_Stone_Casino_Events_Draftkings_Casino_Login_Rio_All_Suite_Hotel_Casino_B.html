<p>White Hat Studios has launched its range of online casino products with Caesars Sportsbook &amp; Casino in Pennsylvania</p>
<p>The partnership allows both companies to benefit from their operations in the United States. The supplier will be able to expand its acclaimed titles in one of the fastest-growing iGaming markets in the United States whereas Caesars will grow its footprint with local gamers in the state.</p>
<p>Expanding Pennsylvanian iGaming Momentum with White Hat</p>
<p>The operator is happy to add many of the supplier’s top-performing titles, including Almighty Buffalo Megaways, Deal or No Deal Megaways: The Golden Case, ted, and other branded games that have been developed by White Hat Studios and are the company’s signature style.</p>
<p>Among those are also White Hat titles that were developed as branded titles for Caesars, including Blackjack Player’s Choice, American Roulette, and Multi-Hand Blackjack.</p>
<p>White Hat Studios CEO Andy Whitworth welcomed the opportunity to see the company’s supplier license pay off by setting up a new content alliance with a prominent operator such as Caesars. Whitworth said:</p>
<p>We truly value our partnership with Caesars and are thrilled to have taken the collaboration to the next level by launching together in the state of Pennsylvania. White Hat Studios CEO Andy Whitworth</p>
<p>Whitworth said that his company was very much determined to team up with Caesars and continue working with the prominent operator and brand in the Pennsylvanian iGaming market.</p>
<p>“We’re thoroughly looking forward to seeing Caesars’ customer base in Pennsylvania experience our slots and table games that continue to attract the attention of casino players across the US,” the executive added.</p>
<p>Continuing to Grow Together Across the United States</p>
<p>The news was naturally welcomed by Caesars Digital SVP of iGaming Matthew Sunderland who was similarly chuffed to see White Hat Studios’ top-performing and high-quality content make it to the operator’s library of games.</p>
<p>This is not the first time the two companies have worked together in the regulated iGaming market in the United States. The pair previously collaborated on a similar content alliance in Michigan, another high-performing and regulated iGaming market.</p>
<p>White Hat Studios is also the author of Almighty Buffalo Megaways, which was celebrated as the Top Performing New Online Slot at the 2023 Eilers &amp; Krejcik Gaming Awards.</p>
