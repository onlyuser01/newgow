<p>PUBG Corporation, the masterminds behind the namesake battle royale game, PLAYERUNKNOWN’S BATTLEGROUNDS (PUBG) , has announced a series of moves designed to bolster the competitive communities and esports scene.</p>
<p>PUBG is already forging ahead backed by South Korean broadcaster OGN in North America to bring even more impressive esports competitions to the fore. So far, reception has been somewhat modest, but the company has gone all in.</p>

<p>Following the $100 million investment by OGN, PUBG Corp. are now outlining the next step in the development of the North American National PUBG League (NPL) and PUBG Europe League (PEL), kicking off in May.</p>
<p>PUBG Corp. will release a series of in-game items branded with the participating teams logos, which will fetch teams 25% of the revenue, similar to the Battle Pass solutions used by other companies, including Valve and Epic Games in order to boost overall tournament prize pools.</p>
<p>PUBG Corp. is also investing in housing and out-of-pocket expenses for the teams, helping participating organizations to offset some of the expenses that weigh down upcoming powerhouses lacking the financial backing.</p>
<p>To guarantee a steadier stream of proceedings, global event partners will also be allowed to sell branded items, offering 25% back to teams. There will be a special item for the Global Championship, proceedings of which will be allocated to the prize pool.</p>
<p>Richard Kwon, CMO, PUBG Corp. commented on the importance of esports organizations determined to compete in PUBG:</p>
<p>We are nothing without our teams and players, so it’s critical that we develop these programs to support our competitive scene and help teams build their brands.</p>
<p>In addition to building a popular esport that caters to our PUBG fanbase for years to come, we want to create a financially viable environment for players to sustain themselves and profit from their hard work,” Mr. Kwon added.</p>
<p>Is PUBG Esports Sustainable?</p>
<p>There has been some doubt about the future of PUBG as an esports, particularly with the decision of several high-profile esports organization to withdraw their rosters from the game, including Evil Geniuses, OpTic Gaming and G2 Esports.</p>
<p>In all instances, the esports outfits have described the future of PUBG esports as uncertain. Similar concerns have been confirmed by viewership data collate by The Esports Observer and Esports Charts (ESC).</p>
<p>PUBG Corp., on the other hand, haven’t betrayed so much as a shadow of doubt. It’s true that the game is not enjoying the same popularity when it comes to full-blown esports, but community involvement has been steady, from North America to the Southeast Asia (SEA) region.</p>
<p>While PUBG Corp. continuous to invest money back into the esports community, there’s still a chance for the game to establish itself. Still, 2019 seems to be the year which will decide which way the game sways – towards higher viewership and esports opportunity or off to gradually petering out.</p>
