    <h1>Revel Casino Atlantic City Northern Quest Casino Hotel Harrah S Casino Joliet Medinah Temple Casino</h1>

<p>Dear Casino Guru,</p>
<p>What you believe does not necessarily mean that rules should be imposed on operators this way.</p>
<p>What you are asking is something that needs to be available from the platform software and it's not something that we have any control over it directly or imposed on us from MGA, so this makes your statement biased and un-ethical, to some extent even questionable! ... with your verdict, you are directly telling all the players that they can claim a bonus and play on any restricted game as they would still get all their winnings, and this is truly defamatory.</p>
<p>Having said that, we are fully inline with the Malta Gambling Authority when it comes to our terms and conditions and imposing such behaviour is truly unacceptable and un-professional.</p>
<p>We have clearly not restricted any bonus to the player, as your gambling codex is stating in part 6 about Restricted bonuses in certain countries, in-fact, your codex does not even mention anything about restricted games.</p>
<p>Also, our terms and conditions are available from anywhere on the site + our emails for the player to access, thus not hiding them to the player. The player is quite an experienced gambler and he is fully aware that bonus terms will apply when claiming bonuses. Even if he was not so experienced, the terms &amp; conditions are still accessible from everywhere!</p>
<p>When a player registers, it is mandatory for him to accept our terms and conditions before he can deposit, claim bonus or even open an account, thus legally binding him to follow such terms in their entirety.</p>
<p>I kindly ask you to asses closely this situation before rushing into such damaging conclusions.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Richard</p>
