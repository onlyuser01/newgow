    <h1>Empire City Online Casino Lauberge Casino All You Can Eat Crab Legs Casino Rivers Casino Portsmouth</h1>

<p>No, this is my third and last one. I think the casino is having money problems because yesterday one of the customer service people said something about the payout being delayed "a little" because the amount was so high. This casino is just PATHETIC!!!</p>
<p>YOU WILL ACCEPT MONEY WITHOUT A DOUBT!!!! But the second thing is that support claims, at least for me, that it has no contact with the "responsible department" that processes the payouts.</p>
<p>The last time it was about €4,000, but I have already given up my belief in the payout. This time it's just pathetic how EMIRBET is doing. I mean, they once said that I had to wait so long because many winners were just getting their payouts, aha and then what am I?</p>
<p>Then another lady, Eva or something like that, said that our employees were working so hard and that I should be patient and then the woman said, I would like to thank you for not minding being patient for so long ....</p>
<p>I'm just going to write down everything here that they deducted from me BECAUSE of €5,000. I also believe that the email support address: support@emirbet.com is dead, I have already written 3 emails to them, the first was on November 4th, the second on November 6th, the last one yesterday or the day before yesterday, now it is I dont care too.</p>
<p>The customer service, without shit, IS COMPLETELY POINTLESS + CAN'T GET ANYTHING DONE + CAN'T GET ANYTHING IN ORDER + JUST HOLDS YOU DOWN AND they should actually get rid of it.</p>
<p>What good is a customer service that writes to me but doesn't process my tickets?</p>
<p>I can also count the dots on my blanket if I worked like they do.</p>
<p>I can ONLY ADVISE AGAINST PLAYING THERE. I've already said goodbye to the prize.</p>
<p>Maybe you're luckier than me, I don't have any strength left either, Toni.</p>
<p>I feel completely RUSTED.</p>
<p>With that in mind, I wish you all a wonderful weekend!</p>
