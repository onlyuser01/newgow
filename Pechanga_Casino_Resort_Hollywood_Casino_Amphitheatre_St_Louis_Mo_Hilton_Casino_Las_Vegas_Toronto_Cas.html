<p>The National Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG) partnered with the Massachusetts Council on Gaming and Health (MACGH) to host the 2022 National Conference on Gambling Addiction and Responsible Gambling. The 36th iteration of the event took place on 20 – 22 July in Boston and gathered over 600 individuals. Industry representatives, responsible gambling advocates, and members of organizations for gambling harm prevention, education, and treatment gathered to discuss the future of responsible gaming.</p>
<p>DraftKings Thanked the NCPG for Their Efforts</p>
<p>Gaming operator DraftKings was one of the conference’s key sponsors. The operator released a video thanking the NCPG for its continued commitment to fighting problem gambling. DraftKings congratulated the organization on its 50th anniversary and acknowledged it as one of the prime advocates for responsible gaming.</p>
<p>Christine Thurmond, the senior director responsible for gaming at DraftKings, noted that the NCPG was the preeminent authority in the US on advocacy, prevention, education, treatment, recovery, and research on gambling harm.</p>
<p>To the leadership and staff at the NCPG, thank you for your tireless efforts. Christine Thurmond, senior director responsible gaming at DraftKings</p>
<p>DraftKings senior responsible gaming manager Julie Hynes added that the NCPG would continue to provide guidance and leadership. The DraftKings responsible gaming ream wishes the council another successful 50 years of being a staunch advocate for player protection.</p>
<p>The Operator Expressed Continued Commitment to the Cause</p>
<p>Thurmond and Hynes attended the 2022 National Conference, representing the operator. According to DraftKings communications manager Suzanne Trainor, the company’s responsible gaming team related their newest approach to the unfamiliar challenges posed by the rapid growth of sports betting in dozens of states. She expressed gratitude to the presenters at the event and noted that DraftKings continued to promote research in safe play to expand its knowledge base.</p>
<p>Zach Flores, another responsible gaming team member, drew attention to DraftKings’ State Council funding program, which aimed to support all state affiliates of the NCPG. The operator reaffirmed its commitment to the cause, noting that responsibility for safe gambling had shifted from the player to a shared commitment between individuals, regulators, academics, and other stakeholders.</p>
<p>We’ll continue to see responsible gaming grow in leaps and bounds… as the gaming landscape changes and technology advances. Julie Hynes, senior responsible gaming manager at DraftKings</p>
<p>Hynes expressed hope that DraftKings would see many similar partnerships in the future, both within and outside the industry, in its mission to promote player safety.</p>
<p>The Conference Hosted Multiple Initiatives</p>
<p>The Boston conference concluded successfully on 22 July. This year’s primary focus was on sports betting. As a result, the exhibition brought together sports and gambling stakeholders in its “Safer Sports Betting Summit.”</p>
<p>Operator PointsBet recently partnered with the NCPD for joint research examining how online gambling providers deal with problem gambling. Conference attendees had to assume the role of a gambling operator and deal with fictional clients demonstrating potentially problematic gaming behavior. The results of the initiative will be announced in September 2022.</p>
