    <h1>Northern California Casinos Las Vegas Resort Casino Casino Party Decorations Gambling Casino 7 Clan</h1>

<p>Light &amp; Wonder’s CEO of gaming has previously worked with Nejad and said that he cannot imagine a better fit for the company’s team</p>
<p>Light &amp; Wonder, a leading cross-platform global games company will expand its leadership team with Niaz Nejad as its new managing director of gaming for the Americas. As announced by the supplier, Nejad will be joining its ranks later this year, following the conclusion of her non-compete period.</p>
<p>Nejad brings a whopping 25+ years of experience to the company. Prior to her current appointment, she served as Aristocrat Gaming’s senior vice president and head of marketing for the US and Canada. During her time at Light &amp; Wonder’s competitor, Nejad led Aristocrat’s overall brand and marketing strategy. She was also responsible for inspiring the team to produce more creative and innovative products.</p>
<p>Before joining Aristocrat Gaming, Nejad served as the chief operating officer of the Alberta Gaming, Liquor and Cannabis Commission. In that position, she guided the commission’s provincial gaming and cannabis strategic direction, as well as its corporate portfolio, digital transformation and revenue forecasts.</p>
<p>Light &amp; Wonder also noted that as a member of the Alberta Gaming, Liquor and Cannabis Commission, Nejad was responsible for maintaining over $1.4 billion in annual-net revenues from various gambling verticals. The revenue streams included slot machines, video lottery terminals, lottery tickets and electronic bingo – verticals that Nejad had to sustain through the right policies, development and marketing.</p>
<p>Light &amp; Wonder Welcomes Nejad on Board</p>
<p>Light &amp; Wonder is certain that Nejad will be a great addition to the company, thanks to her vast experience in the gambling industry. The company noted that she has an impressive track record of driving double-digit growth.</p>
<p>Siobhan Lane, Light &amp; Wonder’s chief executive officer of gaming, welcomed the new appointee to the company. He noted that this will not be the first time he has worked with her:</p>
<p>I have had the pleasure of working with Niaz within our industry for many years, and I know her values, industry and business experience, as well as her people-centric leadership approach are the perfect fit for our team. Siobhan Lane, CEO, Light &amp; Wonder</p>
<p>Lane added that Nejad will play a key role in Light &amp; Wonder’s expansion in the Americas and beyond. He said that she is the perfect addition to the team and that he is certain she will steer the company in the right direction.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Light &amp; Wonder teased that it is considering a second listing in Australia, following its listing on the NASDAQ.</p>
<p>At the beginning of March, the company released its official Q4 2022 results, highlighting the success of its restructuring efforts.</p>
