<p>It’s no secret that since the passing of Las Vegas Sands’ late chairman and CEO, Sheldon Adelson, the company has been acting a little more daringly insofar as online gaming goes. Now, the Nevada-headquartered casino giant is taking a decisive step forward by investing in Huddle Tech Inc, a newly-formed company that is the result of Huddle Gaming and DeckPrism Sports forming a new entity committed to the online gaming market in the US. The investment follows the 2021 sale of the company’s real estate portfolio in Las Vegas for the significant sum of $6.25 billion.</p>
<p>Through this partnership, Las Vegas Sands is also dipping a toe into the expansive online gambling sphere which it avoided for so long. The company has not revealed the size of its investment, adding to the mystery, but LVS seems committed to Huddle Tech Inc, nevertheless.</p>
<p>Thanks to this investment, Huddle Tech would be able to improve services for its existing clients but also provide the company with the financial means to continue developing its best-in-class products and technological suite. LVS is confident that Huddle Tech could one day help iGaming companies make a leap towards "the future of odds-making and managing trading services."</p>
<p>This is Huddle Tech’s own area of expertise which lies in creating trusted solutions for trading, risk management and odds feeds for iGaming operators. On the other hand, DeckPrism is a company that focuses almost exclusively on in-play or live betting markets for a number of high-profile American sports, to name NCAAF, NBA, NCAAB, NFL, NHL, and not least, MLB.</p>
<p>Rob Goldstein, the new chairman and CEO, has been laser-focused on growth as he confirmed on the occasion of the investment. While the company plans to continue investing in the land-based segments in both Singapore and Macau, albeit "withdraw" from Japan for the immediate future, there are other avenues of opportunity to explore.</p>
<p>Domestic development opportunities should not be overlooked, Goldstein stated. A statement was also released by Huddle Tech Inc CEO Francesco Borgosano offered more clarity. The long-term strategy remains unchanged – and that is to create a technological solution that will best serve the needs of operators.</p>
<p>Product differentiation, efficiency, and innovation are all part of the ambitious goals that Huddle Tech has laid ahead for itself. The investment from Las Vegas Sands should help it achieve just that.</p>
