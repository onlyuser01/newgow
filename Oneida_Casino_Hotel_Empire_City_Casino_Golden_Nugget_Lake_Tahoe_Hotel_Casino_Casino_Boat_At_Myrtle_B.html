<p>Las Vegas police have arrested a second woman accused of drugging a man at a Las Vegas Strip casino and stealing his expensive Rolex watch. This is the fourth man to make a similar claim this year.</p>

<p>Police last week arrested Ashley Trahan, 33, of Las Vegas, and booked her into the Clark County Detention Center, according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal.</p>
<p>Trahan is accused of committing grand larceny. She has been released from jail and is due in Las Vegas Justice Court in June for a hearing. Prosecutors early this week had not decided whether to pursue a case against her.</p>
<p>A man staying at the Aria Resort and Casino on March 29 said he was at the Lift bar at 3 am when he began talking with a woman who identified herself as Kayla, police said.</p>
<p>The man had a conversation with her about a gambling machine he was playing at the bar. He got up to use the restroom. He left his drink at the bar.</p>
<p>The man told police that when he returned to the bar he “had a hard time walking and believed he had been drugged.”</p>
<p>The man and women went to his hotel room. He told authorities there were no discussions about “trading sexual favors for money,” police said.</p>
<p>He woke up at 11 am to discover that his $40,000 Rolex was gone. He said $400 in cash and a $183 casino ticket were missing from his pockets, the newspaper reported.</p>
<p>Previous Arrest Warrants</p>
<p>Police later stopped Trahan on suspicion of speeding in a school zone in the Southern Highlands community. Authorities discovered she had previous arrest warrants in a case involving attempted murder and attempted robbery, the newspaper reported.</p>
<p>Police questioned her about the incident at the Aria and showed her a surveillance photo taken at the resort on the morning of the incident. She at first denied she had been in Las Vegas at the time. She then conceded she was the woman seen with the victim in the surveillance image, the newspaper reported.</p>
<p>Trahan said the man was a lawyer and that she had his business card at home. She denied drugging him. She said he took a narcotic on his own, police said.</p>
<p>$127K in Stolen Watches</p>
<p>Another Las Vegas woman recently was arrested two separate times in similar incidents.</p>
<p>Windy Rose Jones, 23, of Las Vegas, is accused of drugging men at the Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas on two different occasions and stealing their expensive watches. The Cosmopolitan towers over the older Jockey Club on the west side of the Strip.</p>
<p>One man’s watch was a $37,000 Audemars Piguet Royal Oak. The other watch was a $45,000 Rolex Daytona.</p>
<p>Jones had been released from jail and was awaiting a court date in those incidents when a third man said she stole his $45,000 Rolex, police said.</p>
<p>The man said this occurred during a night of drinking that started at the Wynn Las Vegas on the Strip and included a stop at an off-Strip hookah lounge. The man told police he woke up in the valet area at the Venetian Las Vegas. He said he suspected she drugged him.</p>
<p>The Venetian is on the east side of the Strip where the now-demolished Sands Casino once stood.</p>
