    <h1>Best Atlantic City Casino Foxwoods Casino Restaurants Emerald Casino Silverado Casino Oaklawn Racing</h1>

<p>Dear Casino Guru,</p>
<p>Last night (the 5th of April), I was playing some slots on iWild Casino. I was playing The Dog House Multihold and struck a lucky bonus round, where I won â‚¬84.85 (424x).</p>
<p>However, when I returned to the base game, the amount was not credited to my account. Instead, an error popped up, stating that I had to restart the game. So I did. I was again returned to the bonus round, which was resolved for the same amount. Again, I returned to the base game, and I was not credited the amount I won.</p>
<p>I instantly reached out to live support. They asked for the betting round ID from my game history, which I could not retrieve as the data displayed on my Game History-page is incomplete.</p>
<p>Here, I've selected dates 05.04.2023 to 06.04.2023 - clearly, some bets are missing between 05.04.2023 23:51:26 and 06.04.2023 01:24:48.</p>
<p>When I select 06.04.2023, these entries appear, clearly proving I was playing The Dog House Multihold at the time the issue arose.</p>
<p>The two bets on The Dog House Multihold you see, are bets I made just after the bonus round was resolved, to see if that would fix my account balance.</p>
<p>Be aware, that since I'm in Denmark and iWildCasino operates from Ireland, the game history is 2 hours behind my local time.</p>
<p>I asked live support if it was okay to continue playing, while this issue was being resolved. They confirmed that this was in order - I cannot prove this part, as iWildCasino won't give me transcriptions of conversations I had with their live support (even though they're obligated to, and have this information available, under the data protection law).</p>
<p>iWildCasino finally sent the game round for review, and they state the following:</p>
<p>"We have reviewed the rounds and inform you that the rounds have been automatically canceled as the rounds have been postponed. According to the rules of paragraph 12 of the bonus rules of the casino, the transfer of bonus rounds is prohibited: 12. Delaying any game round in any game, including free spins features and bonus features, to a later time when you have no more wagering requirement and/or performing new deposit(s) while having free spins features or bonus features still available in a game is prohibited."</p>
<p>This is not true, as I resolved the bonus round at the same moment I won it. My guess is, that they interpret the fact that the game gave me a server error, and prompted me to restart the game, as "postponement", which I think is unfair.</p>
<p>I have no way to prove through my Game History that I made this bet, as the data is incomplete on the casino's part, but there are some bets missing from my history.</p>
<p>I hope this can be resolved, as I'm a bit frustrated with the lack of help and understanding on the casino's part.</p>
<p>I'll be happy to provide further information and help in this matter.</p>
