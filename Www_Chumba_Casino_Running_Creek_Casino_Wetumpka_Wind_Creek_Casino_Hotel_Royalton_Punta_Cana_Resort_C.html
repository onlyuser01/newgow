<p>Financial details about the transaction were not released but AI confirmed that it is expected to close by the end of this year</p>
<p>Omni-channel gaming company Affinity Interactive (AI), confirmed it has entered into a definitive agreement to sell one of its Nevada properties. The company said Wednesday that its affiliates have agreed to sell Rail City Casino to affiliates of Truckee Gaming.</p>
<p>Rail City is a popular gaming and wagering venue located in Sparks, Nevada. It is famous for offering engaging and entertaining games and has become a leading gaming destination in western Nevada. The venue has nearly 415 slot machines, as well as a keno lounge. Overall, Rail City Casino’s gaming floor is some 24,000 square feet, but the location also offers dining options such as Ale House American Café.</p>
<p>“As part of the Affinity Interactive family, we expanded our offerings and capabilities, allowing us to continuously enhance the Rail City experience for our valued customers and gaming enthusiasts.“ Andrei Scrivens, chief executive officer of Affinity Interactive</p>
<p>Andrei Scrivens, AI’s chief executive officer, spoke about the company’s goal to offer engaging experiences for its growing customer base. According to the company, the sale is in line with its goal to strengthen its core business and boost its growth.</p>
<p>AI Remains Focused On Growth</p>
<p>It was back in November when AI confirmed the promotion of Scrivens to CEO. Before becoming the company’s lead, he held the role of chief financial officer since 2019. The appointment coincided with planned growth for AI and it is likely that the new sale will further accelerate the company’s plans.</p>
<p>Although AI confirmed that it has entered into a definitive agreement for the sale of Rail City Casino this week, the transaction is expected to be completed by the end of this year. It’s important to mention that the sale is subject to customary closing conditions, as well as the relevant regulatory approvals. Financial details regarding the sale were not disclosed publicly.</p>
<p>Currently, AI leverages innovative technology that helps combine online media platforms with its popular casino located in Iowa, Missouri and Nevada. Throughout the land-based and online gambling vertical, the company has 1 million customers. This reaffirms the potential of AI for further growth and places the company in a unique position for expansion within new iGaming and betting markets.</p>
