    <h1>Golden Heart Casino Barstool Casino Pa Jackpot Junction Casino Hotel Siloam Springs Casino Mgm Grand</h1>

<p>Hello Casinoguru team,</p>
<p>I recently tested Shadowbit Casino and made a deposit with a deposit bonus. Of course, I informed myself in advance about the bonus conditions in order to comply with them. After successfully playing through the bonus, I was able to request a payout of 900 euros on November 27th, 2022. I quickly uploaded my verification documents so the process would not be delayed. The next day the withdrawal was canceled as the casino insisted on another document. I'm supposed to take a picture holding my ID card with a note that says "Hello Shadowbit Casino+current date". I uploaded this and requested a new payment. The document has been confirmed, however the payout is unchanged since 11/28/2022. Withdrawal method corresponds to the deposit (crypto wallet). I contacted support via the contact form, but received no response. I then contacted the live chat several times (at least 7 times) due to the long payout waiting time. I was always put off that it could take a while and I had to wait ("The payout is being checked"). I wonder what is being checked for so long. Today is the 12th day and the withdrawal has still not been processed... . I'm starting to get the feeling that the casino isn't serious and won't pay out, even though it belongs to the Dama NV group. I just can't get any further at this point... .</p>
<p>Would it be possible for you to contact the casino and clarify the situation? I would be very happy to receive any kind of feedback.</p>
<p>Thank you for your help and you great helpful website!</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>
<p>Pavel</p>
