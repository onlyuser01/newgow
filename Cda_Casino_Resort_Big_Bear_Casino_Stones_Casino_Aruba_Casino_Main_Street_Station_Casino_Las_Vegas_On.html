<p>OnAir Entertainment promised its clients and stakeholders that it is taking this matter very seriously</p>
<p>Several days ago, live casino specialist OnAir Entertainment was accused of corporate espionage. The company is now seeking to combat these allegations and prove them wrong.</p>
<p>For reference, the allegations stem from Ivans Ivanovs, the company’s former senior product owner. Ivanovs accused OnAir’s game portfolio lead, Igors Veliks, of maintaining user access to Playtech’s internal systems for a whopping two years.</p>
<p>Veliks was a former Playtech Euro Live Technologies employee who failed to relinquish access to the company’s internal systems following his exit.</p>
<p>In his post, Ivanovs accused the company of a severe lack of professionalism, saying that unethical practices are commonplace. According to him, the OnAir leadership was fully aware of what was happening but did nothing to stop it.</p>
<p>However, OnAir Entertainment is bullish on tackling these allegations head-on and clearing its name. In a statement initially provided to NEXT.io, the company pledged to investigate the claims and do something.</p>
<p>The OnAir Entertainment Group is committed to maintaining the highest standards of integrity and professionalism. OnAir Entertainment statement</p>
<p>OnAir Hired an Independent Investigator</p>
<p>The company explained that it has hired the services of an independent investigator who will conduct a comprehensive investigation of the company’s business and see if the allegations are correct.</p>
<p>OnAir Entertainment promised its clients and stakeholders that it is taking this matter very seriously, which is why “immediate and decisive action” will be taken. The live casino specialist also promised to provide regular updates on the findings as the investigation progresses.</p>
<p>As the investigation progresses, we will provide updates as appropriate, while respecting the confidentiality and privacy of all parties involved. OnAir Entertainment statement</p>
<p>NEXT.io also spoke on the matter with Playtech. OnAir’s competitors told the news outlet that it would also conduct its own investigation to see if it can identify any potential instances of IP infringement.</p>
