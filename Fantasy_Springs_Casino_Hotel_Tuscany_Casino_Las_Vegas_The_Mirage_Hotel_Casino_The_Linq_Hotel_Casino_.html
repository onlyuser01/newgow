    <h1>Fantasy Springs Casino Hotel Tuscany Casino Las Vegas The Mirage Hotel Casino The Linq Hotel Casino</h1>

<p>I had already lost 366 USD in coins.game casino, and on 28. July i informed them by email that i was an gambling addict, and that i had lost 366$ which came from loans i could not afford to lose, and asking for a possible refund because those funds were intended to pay bills. Both in the text and the topic of the email was clearly texted with Gambling addiction. They even replied the email where i did write back again that i lost due to my addiction. This confirms that they have seem and processed my initial email informing that i am a gambling addict and that i had lost more than i could afford.</p>
<p>On 1. August it was payday, and i deposited my whole paycheck and lost everything which is a total of 1565 USDT, which the casino should not have been allowing since i already did inform them about my gambling addiction and i had lost funds i could not afford.</p>
<p>I did write an email to them about the above matter, and now they closed my account on last wednesday but they told me they do not provide refunds, so the dispute is why they did not close the account in first place when i informed them about my addiction, so i never could have deposited and lost my whole pay-check.</p>
