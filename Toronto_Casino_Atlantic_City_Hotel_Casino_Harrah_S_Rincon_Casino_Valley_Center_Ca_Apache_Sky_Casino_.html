<p>The global gaming content and technology company that publishes mobile games, Aristocrat Leisure Limited, announced a senior-level appointment on Monday. The company revealed it appointed Sally Denby as its new Chief Financial Officer (CFO).</p>
<p>The recent appointment is effective immediately, according to a statement released by Aristocrat but is subject to relevant regulatory pre-approvals. Although this is a new senior-level position for Denby, it is certainly not her first important role with the company.</p>
<p>Being a part of Aristocrat for seven years, she held different senior-level finance leadership roles. Most recently, Denby was the company's Deputy Chief Financial Officer. She was appointed to the position of Deputy CFO back in February 2022 and now, she is marking her way up the ranks to CFO of the company.</p>
<p>Trevor Croker, Aristocrat's CEO and Managing Director, said about the recent appointment: "I am thrilled to appoint Sally Denby as Chief Financial Officer of Aristocrat and welcome her to our executive leadership team." He explained that Denby has a proven track record with the company and is also a proven finance specialist and leader.</p>
<p>Croker added: "Sally's cultural impact, deep engagement with our operating businesses and understanding of our obligations as an ASX listed company further add to her credentials." He outlined that during her tenure as Deputy CFO, Denby collaborated with the company's management team and helped during the transition period from the past CFO back in April.</p>
<p>According to Croker, Denby was selected following a "comprehensive global search." This quest pinpointed her as the main candidate for the role which will further complement the company's ongoing growth. Finally, Croker said: "I congratulate Sally on her appointment and look forward to her ongoing contribution to Aristocrat."</p>
<p>Before joining Aristocrat, Denby was a part of the Australian media company ninemsn. During her tenure with the company, she held the position of Finance Director for nearly 2.5 years.</p>
<p>Before that, Denby was a part of GE Capital A&amp;NZ where she served for nearly two years as Chief Financial Officer. Her professional background includes other leadership financial positions with GE Capital A&amp;NZ and GE Commercial Finance A&amp;NZ.</p>
<p>Aristocrat's latest announcement comes after last month, the company strengthened its senior leadership team by nominating Bill Lance as a Non-Executive Director. Although he was nominated, Lance needs to be elected by the company's shareholders. This approval is expected to be granted in February at Aristocrat's Annual General Meeting.</p>
