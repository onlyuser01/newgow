<p>Online gaming and sports betting company FSB announced Tuesday it obtained GLI 33 certification from Gaming Laboratories International for its sports wagering offering having successfully completed a pre-compliance product testing against the standards of the GLI 33 Event Wagering System.</p>
<p>“Gaining GLI 33 certification is another milestone for FSB.” Dave McDowell, CEO, FSB</p>
<p>Products Integrity-Compliant</p>
<p>Acquiring certification from GLI ahead of the planned entry into the US sports betting market is a proof FSB products comply with the highest integrity standards in the industry and will help the company speed up the process of regulatory approval for each individual state.</p>
<p>“We are delighted to have received Gaming Laboratories International GLI 33 certification for our sportsbook platform, proving that we are meeting the highest integrity standards ahead of our debut in the US market.” Bob Akeret, Vice President Operations, North America, FSB</p>
<p>The recently appointed VP of Operations whose role would be to fine-tune the platform and technology supplier’s product and service offering for the North American market, as well as assist the company’s business development team in localizing retail and digital online sportsbook technologies, further noted that the process of certification for the company was straightforward and quick, once again proving the technical capacity of FSB’s “highly evolved platform”.</p>
<p>“We see huge potential for our various products and services in the US and this certification gives us the platform to prove our technologies can meet the exact needs of operators and players across North America. It all points to an exciting 2021.” Dave McDowell, CEO, FSB</p>
<p>Business Focus Switch</p>
<p>Earlier this year, FSB announced its plans to enter the gaining speed US sports betting market and leave the woes from 2019 behind. The online gaming and sports betting operator suffered significant setbacks with its UK operations related to its dealings with third parties, which led to a hefty fine slapped by the gambling regulator.</p>
<p>In August, the Gambling Commission launched an investigation into FSB Technology (UK) Limited following the operator’s decision to voluntarily suspend operations at its Blackbet website. The suspension of the website came shortly after FSB had suspended another white label partner, 1xBet, due to a media report alleging illegal advertising practices.</p>
<p>In January this year, another partner of FSB Technology, online bookmaker Black Type, drew the regulator’s attention after going into administration, and only added to FSB’s regulatory woes.</p>
<p>For these third party failings, FSB had to settle with the UK Gambling Commission a hefty £634,300 financial sanction in May.</p>
