<p>Just outside of Montreal, Canada, on the south shore of the St. Lawrence River resides an 8,000 strong community of Mohawk (North American Indian) people. It is known as Kahnawake, and is home to the Kahnawake Gaming Commission.</p>
<p>Kahnawake Gaming Commission is responsible for licensing and regulating all gaming and gaming related activities which operate from the Kahnawake territory.</p>
<p>Note: The Kahnawake license is a popular choice for new businesses as it is less expensive and relatively easy to acquire in comparison to other jurisdictions.</p>
<p>What is the Kahnawake Gaming Commission and what does it do?</p>
<p>The commission was originally established on June 10, 1996, making it one of the oldest regulators in the world, and first introduced regulations governing interactive gaming on July 8, 1999, in accordance with section 35 of the Kahnawake Gaming Law.</p>
<p>The regulations are designed to ensure that all interactive gaming and gaming related activities carried out within or from the Mohawk Territory of Kahnawake smeet several basic criteria, namely:</p>
<p>to provide a lawful basis for the regulation and control of interactive gaming based in or offered from within the Mohawk Territory of Kahnawake</p>
<p>to ensure that interactive gaming is conducted responsibly, fairly and honestly</p>
<p>to prevent interactive gaming from being associated in any way with crime or criminality</p>
<p>to ensure that the operators of interactive games treat players fairly; that they pay winners promptly and that all information related to player accounts is held in the strictest confidence</p>
<p>to protect persons under the age of eighteen (18) years and other vulnerable persons</p>
<p>Various types of online gambling are regulated and licensed by the KGC, including poker, casino and sportsbook betting.</p>
<p>The KGC also has the ability to appoint third-party "Approved Agents" to help it to carry out functions with regards to gaming sites. An example of this might be investigating an applicant's suitability to offer interactive gaming services, or the testing and auditing of a licensee to ensure that they are compliant and able to continue operating. Scout Intelligence Inc, Triton Canada Inc, Gaming Associates Europe Ltd and eCOGRA are just some of the agents approved by the KGC.</p>
