<p>Hi,</p>
<p>from may 2023 i have problem with my account on lottoland.co.uk. i was active playaer and I play slots the most. There was a tournament with spinomenal slots. I uad win few times on that slots. I passed KYC verification, I send them my passport, few proof of address and proof of funds from two paying methods. I try to get as many as possible ticket for final prize draw (and i had 41 entries). One day before that draw lottoland blocked my account (my account was suspended) and asked me to contact support team. Because of very busy time in my work I have call them in july. I was connected with some person from departament which take care about gambling. I have answered all question because all money was mine. I even send them my payslip. I work full time but as well i have additional funds from completly different income. I get something after dead of family member. The person from support team unblocked my acvount and set for me loose limit. After that i have load my accound with some small amount of money but i have win muvh more and play with that what i win. And after that i get message that my account was again blocked. I call to lottoland and asked about my bonus funds and about my account. When i gove them my details the women hung up. When i tried to call again for few days, few times they never answer. Today i get email that i can play because my account is unblocked but i cant play any of ruby games, red tiger, yggdrasil. Most of provider when i try to start display me message that game is not avaiable or there is error. I never spend more money that i can, i never get any loans for playing and i have no pressure for that because i even didnt contact them super fast but after around month. I only think its very unfair to blocke me before i could take a part in draw or get 41 pounds of bonus and later after win some money they blocked me again. And now Iâ€™m unblocked but i cant play.</p>
