    <h1>Bspot Casino Casinos Near Atlanta Ga America Star Casino New Online Casinos Usa Real Money Casino Ga</h1>

<p>Now there you go right there . " In regards to the Halloween bonuses, we found that the player claimed the 3 prizes for their deposited amount, however they did not claim the Daily prize. We have received screenshots at a later date illustrating an attempt to open a deposit prize on a date on which they had not deposited, the 25th of October." That whole paragraph is what makes you guilty of a terms breach .</p>
<p>According to the halloween bonus terms . Deposit today and claim for 6 consecutive days that follow . If you took anytime to look at my screenshots you would have seen that . So i have a case . I was cheated and your statement just proved it .</p>
<p>Regarding the withdrawal . There was real funds in my account also still at the time the free spins were played . So you guys had no excuse . The fact that the 5day term is in "faqs" does not make it a binding term anyway cz its not in the terms i agree to in my initial agreement upon sign up . So in that instance you should have it in the "bonus terms " menu irrelevant of what you say . Those are the terms that are agreed to by any player and any law will see it the same way .</p>
<p>Im not the only player with this issue . In fact if you go look around on social media i can create quite a following about this exact issue . A term cannot be listed in frequently asked questions because only having an issue will you use faq to resolve it .</p>
<p>Casino Guru with regards to you guys . Loads of respect but if you dont see the issue here then this is not going to work attatched you can see the terms we agree to with our sign up . No 5 days mentioned .just a deposit needed is mentioned . Which is normal procedure . Also the bonus terms i agreed to stating 1 deposit claim for 6 days . Thats all evidence . So what happens now . They gave me a 250 bonus chip today . But im sorry that does not cut it . I was treated very badly but clearly im not the issue .</p>
