<p>Nederlander World Entertainment promises to debut the latest Broadway show, King Kong, at the IR</p>
<p>US-based casino and hotel brand, Hard Rock International, has introduced a concept for the anticipated Integrated Resort in Japan which was approved in 2018. The full-scale model was introduced during the Hokkaido IR Showcase last week.</p>
<p>Hard Rock International Introduces IR Japan Property Model</p>
<p>In 2018, the government of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe voted the go-ahead for an Integrated Resort (IR) project, which will accommodate a number of international casino brands in a bid to turn the country into a sweet spot for gaming in Asia.</p>
<p>Last week, during the Hokkaido IR Showcase, an event offering an opportunity to brands to introduce their projects, Hard Rock International revealed their full-scale model of the Integrated Resort as the company envisioned it.</p>
<p>Hard Rock had emphasis on accessibility by adding a touch of its own signature work to the model. Based on the concept by Hard Rock, the IR would be connected with Chitose International Airport by monorail. The main hotel building was of course revealed as Hard Rock’s guitar-shaped building soaring in the midst of the resort.</p>
<p>Hard Rock International Chairman and CEO Jim Allen used the opportunity to express his satisfaction with having the opportunity to reveal the concept:</p>
<p>We are extremely excited about the prospect of introducing our Hard Rock family to the people of Hokkaido, Japan with this world-class entertainment resort.</p>
<p>In a truly forward-thinking style, Hard Rock featured an authentic Ainu village, offering visitors a chance to familiarize themselves with the culture of the indigenous Ainu people and turn the trips to the city of Tomakomai into educational as well as amusing getaways. More companies have been openly excited at the prospect of bringing their offer to Japan, including MGM Resorts.</p>
<p>Hard Rock is bringing a piece of the homeland with it, introducing a New York Yankee experience a well as a Rock’n’Roll Hall of Fame focusing on Japanese and Asian artists. Hard Rock is equally committed to maintain the security of the resort, introducing a number of safeguards and social recognition software intended to bar unsavory characters from entering. To sump up, the four key points of the resort include:</p>
<p>New York Yankees Experience</p>
<p>Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts</p>
<p>NEC</p>
<p>Music Rock’n’Roll Hall of Fame</p>
<p>Nederlander World Entertainment</p>
<p>In the case of Nederlander, the partnership will secure Broadway Theatre spectacles to Japanese audiences, including the exclusive rights to debut the latest show, King Kong, the press release stated.</p>
<p>Robert Nederlander Jr., chairman and CEO of Nederlander Worldwide Entertainment, highlighted the ongoing partnership between the two companies:</p>
<p>Nederlander Worldwide Entertainment has a long history of working in Asia, and we are extremely excited about partnering with Hard Rock International.</p>
<p>The opening of the first of Japan’s resorts is unlikely to happen before 2024 some experts estimate. Despite the timeline, companies are hurrying up to make a move on the Japanese market. Some experts even suggest that the country’s resorts will prove a godsend for an alternative iGaming vertical – esports.</p>
<p>With the passing of a law legalizing competitive video gaming in the country, and even plans to field an Olympic team, this is not a far-fetched idea in the slightest.</p>
