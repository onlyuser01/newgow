    <h1>Buffalo Casinos Norfolk Casino Atlantic City Casinos On The Boardwalk Casino St Charles Arizona Casi</h1>

<p>Hello, on October 29th I made a payment of 2500â‚¬, so I had to verify my payment method (3 different credit cards). My problem now is that 2 of these 3 credit cards are virtual cards from Revolut. I have already sent a number of pictures of the cards and also a card confirmation from Revolut on which all my data is visible and it says in black and white that these are my cards. And everything is constantly rejected I should send pictures of the cards and the back should be signed... although I have already described my situation at least 10 times in the chat and said that these cards are virtual. Today I took pictures of the cards again with another cell phone because Revolut doesn't allow screenshots and sent them in directly in the chat. If that's still rejected now, I don't know what to do anymore. Please help me...</p>
