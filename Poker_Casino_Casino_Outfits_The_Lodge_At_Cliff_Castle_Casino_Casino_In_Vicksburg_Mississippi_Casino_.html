<p>Scientific Games announced on November 23 it has reached an agreement for the sale of 600 TwinStar VLTs to Western Canada Lottery, with delivery expected by the end of 2020.</p>
<p>First-Class Gaming Experience</p>
<p>Gaming technology supplier Scientific Games Corporation (SC) and Western Canada Lottery Corporation (WCLC) announced on Monday that they have entered a deal for the sale of the 600 TwinStar video lottery terminals. The dual-screen VLTs are expected to be delivered before the end of the year and will be installed in Saskatchewan’s VLT spots.</p>
<p>WCLC expressed its desire to offer an improved “first-class gaming experience” to its customer base, which will be made possible through the purchase of SC’s TwinStar monitors.</p>
<p>Featuring dual 24” high-resolution screens, with touch control, an immersive audio system, and dynamic monitors, the VLTs will promote four games: Spartacus, Nostrovia, Bonus Sevens Wild, and Bier Haus.</p>
<p>Scientific Games Executive Vice President and CRO Bob Parente said the company holds in high regard its partnership with the lottery company and “[looks] forward to the opportunity of providing WCLC with more innovative products and services in the future,”</p>
<p>Scientific Games Struggles in Q3</p>
<p>At the beginning of November, Scientific Games reported a net loss of $111 million in the third quarter, from $855 in sales revenue in Q3 2019 to $698 million for the same period this year. In the third quarter last year, SC generated $18 million in net income. A debt re-measurement which led to a $24 million loss also affected the group, compared to a $19 million profit in 2019.</p>
<p>The gaming company said in a statement that the Covid-19 pandemic has impacted business and disrupted sales, due to coronavirus-related restrictions and fewer players.</p>
<p>However, SC’s third quarter results were up 29% compared to the second quarter, mainly due to the company’s growth in the digital gaming sector and a bigger product portfolio. Cash flow grew by $11 million from last year’s $62 million, as a result of SC’s focus on balancing costs and improving its business strategy.</p>
<p>“Looking ahead, our team will remain highly focused on driving operational efficiencies, further bolstering our liquidity and strengthening our balance sheet. My overarching focus is to improve the balance sheet through operational and business process improvements.” Michael Eklund, Executive Vice President and CFO at Scientific Games</p>
<p>SC Unveils OpenGaming Portfolio</p>
<p>Scientific Games and German operator Löwen Play GmbH announced on November 19 they have finalized the terms of the launch of SC’s new OpenGaming System (OGS), which will allow the casino provider to develop its content and offerings.</p>
<p>OGS provides seamless game integration to operators and offers player management tools, more than 2500 games, and dynamic features.</p>
<p>Löwen Play, similarly to WCLC, will have access to SC’s games, including 88 Fortunes, Spartacus Megaways, and Jin Ji Bao Xi.</p>
