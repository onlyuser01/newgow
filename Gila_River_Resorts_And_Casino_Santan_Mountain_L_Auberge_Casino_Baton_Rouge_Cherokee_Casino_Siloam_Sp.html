<p>Gaming technology and services provider Scientific Games was awarded a new, five-year contract by Atlantic Lottery to continue serving as the lottery’s primary instant game partner.</p>
<p>Five More Years</p>
<p>The new contract with Scientific Games will ensure Atlantic Lottery players in the provinces of New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador continue to enjoy the supplier’s high-performance Scratch’N Win games</p>
<p>Commenting on the development, president of Americas &amp; Global Instant Products for Scientific Games, John Schulz, approved of the “strong business approach” displayed by Atlantic Lottery in its choice to collaborate with an instant games provider “that uses analytics and insights to support continued growth across the entire game portfolio.”</p>
<p>“We are honored to continue our good work together to entertain Atlantic Lottery players in New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland and Labrador,” Schulz concluded.</p>
<p>Instant games form one part of Atlantic Lottery’s product offering as the operator established itself as one of the most innovative in Canada, also enticing players with numbers games and sports betting, while returning all of its profits to the provinces to provide funding for essential services such as health care, education, infrastructure and others.</p>
<p>Multi-Faceted Partnership</p>
<p>On behalf of Atlantic Lottery, vice president of Lottery and Living Lab at Atlantic Lottery Maureen Wojick explained that the operator “solidified its long-term partnership with Atlantic Lottery” after proving its value in “delivering strong and responsible sales growth” for the lottery’s Scratch’n Win games and helping the lottery top its previous year by 9.8%.</p>
<p>“We are focused on using the company’s analytics and insights to create a Scratch’N Win game portfolio that continues to drive performance while entertaining our players with exciting games,” Wojick added.</p>
<p>Dating back to 1983, the partnership with Scientific Games provides Atlantic Lottery with its integrated central gaming and iLottery system empowering the operator to offer draw, instant-win, sports betting, online casino and digital instant game content across both retail and digital channels.</p>
<p>In addition, Scientific Games is providing the retail technology that powers Atlantic Lottery’s self-service kiosks in New Brunswick and Newfoundland and Labrador, as well as the operator’s player account management and subscription services.</p>
<p>Last month, Atlantic Lottery and Scientific Games announced a retail modernization project that will bring the tech supplier’s Wave point-of-sale technology across the lottery’s network of nearly 3,000 retailers to enhance the player experience.</p>
<p>Responsible for more than 70% of global sales of instant lottery games, Scientific Games is the world’s largest creator of instant games and primary provider to nine of the top 10 lotteries worldwide.</p>
