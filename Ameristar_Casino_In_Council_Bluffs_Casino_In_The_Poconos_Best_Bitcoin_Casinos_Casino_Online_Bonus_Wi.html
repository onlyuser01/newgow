    <h1>Ameristar Casino In Council Bluffs Casino In The Poconos Best Bitcoin Casinos Casino Online Bonus Wi</h1>

<p>iGaming aggregator Relax Gaming has launched a partnership with sportsbook and online casino operator Pinnacle in another step towards the expansion of its distribution network. The news comes on the heels of a similar collaboration as last week Relax unveiled a deal with online casino brand 1win.</p>
<p>According to a company press release, Relax, which offers a diverse selection of over 1,500 in-house games and third-party content, had already provided titles such as Money Train 2, Snake Arena and La Fiesta to Pinnacle’s players as part of the agreement. The company’s portfolio includes games by premium providers such as ReelPlay, Kalamba Games and Fantasma Games.</p>
<p>Growth Period Spurs Series of Partnerships</p>
<p>Over the past year, Relax has struck a series of partnerships with leading suppliers and online casino operators such as NetGaming, MrQ and Roobet, making good use of a period of robust growth. Pinnacle, for its part, has had its fair share of newly-established collaborations too, including an agreement with Denmark-based gaming company North Esports.</p>
<p>The deal with Pinnacle comes as Relax celebrates its 10th anniversary this year, marking a decade of service to the online casino industry. Relax has tied up important strategic partnerships with Big Time Gaming to tap into the latter’s Megaclusters mechanic and saw one of its flagship games, Iron Bank, receive a SOTW accreditation.</p>
<p>Moving forward, Relax Gaming will be looking to expand its reach further, with seven new offices within the next 12 months opening doors.</p>
<p>Relax Chief Commercial Officer Daniel Eskola lauded the new partnership as the result of his company’s high-quality portfolio and its ambition to deliver the best casino games to the market. “Pinnacle is a fast-growing industry name and we are excited to be providing the operator with a wide variety of content that has proven to boost customer engagement and retention,” he said.</p>
<p>Pinnacle’s Steve Wells, Head of Casino and Games, welcomed the deal as part of the operator’s ambitious growth plan and commended Relax for providing “some of iGaming’s most exciting and engaging products”.</p>
