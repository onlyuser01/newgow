    <h1>Metropolis Illinois Casino Orion Star Casino Wild Casino 100 Free Spins No Deposit Seneca Buffalo Ca</h1>

<p>Previously, withdrawals were quick, within a few minutes. This is how Casino Z, now Spinbetter, gained trust.</p>
<p>When the client, trusting the casino, began to make deposits for larger amounts and apply for larger withdrawals (several thousand), problems began. The casino approves (approves) the withdrawal, the funds hang in the air for about a day, then they are returned to the casino. The support service answers only one thing: wait. The casino hopes that the client will continue the game and lose the funds that he submitted before the withdrawal. It happened twice already.</p>
<p>Currently, a request for payment was submitted several times within three days - and after a few hours the funds are returned to the casino.</p>
<p>There is still no successful withdrawal</p>
