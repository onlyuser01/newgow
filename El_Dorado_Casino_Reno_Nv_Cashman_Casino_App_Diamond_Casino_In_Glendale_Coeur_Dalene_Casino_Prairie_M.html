    <h1>El Dorado Casino Reno Nv Cashman Casino App Diamond Casino In Glendale Coeur Dalene Casino Prairie M</h1>

<p>I was given a $25 cashback bonus on a deposit I had made. I had $0 in my account when I received it. Max cashout was $125. I fulfilled all of the playthrough while doing it all on Table games. I submitted my withdrawal on Jan. 4, 2020. I have received zero communication from e-mail and live chat is a joke. They tell me different things every time I talk to some one. I have submitted my verification documents as well. When I requested withdrawal, a live chat person told me they would reach out to me for my bitcoin address, they never did. They told me to use the wire transfer request as there was no bitcoin option for me, they assured me it would work. Nothing.</p>
<p>Below is only e-mail I received telling me of requested withdrawal.</p>
