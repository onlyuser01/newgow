<p>Leading content automation and personalization provider BETEGY will continue to expand after the company received an undisclosed amount of funding from Yolo Investments Ltd, which will assist the company in achieving global growth acceleration. The deal runs in the millions of euros, but no exact confirmation of the sum has been offered.</p>
<p>BETEGY’s Potential Is Only Beginning to Unfold</p>
<p>Yolo Investments now has a non-controlling stake in the company. The two companies will work together to realize some of BETEGY’s immediate priorities. BETEGY CEO Alex Kornilov commented on the latest funding round and the implications thereof.</p>
<p>Our system’s innovative approach has enabled us to be the first in the industry to bring the instant creation of data-driven visual content for all communication channels, including social media, TV production, retail, paid acquisition, SEO, sports media, and affiliate marketing. BETEGY CEO Alex Kornilov</p>
<p>Kornilov argued that BETEGY is able to build unprecedently deep personalization of visual marketing campaigns that have a true bearing on business and resonate with audiences instantaneously. “We’re very proud to be partnering with one of the iGaming industry’s most innovative and dynamic companies for our next stage of growth, and we can’t wait to get started together,” Kornilov concluded.</p>
<p>Yolo Investments is the brainchild of Tim Heath, an entrepreneur, who has an extensive experience in gaming, blockchain, and fintech. The investment in BETEGY is not left to chance either, as Heath has recognized the potential of BETEGY, which has already won EGR and SBC Awards and nominations.</p>
<p>Essentially, BETEGY makes it possible for broadcasters and operators to build data-driven marketing campaigns in a matter of seconds, which can reduce costs for such operations tenfold. Heath himself welcomed the opportunity and argued that there are significant synergies between Yolo Investments and BETEGY’s ecosystems.</p>
<p>Instant Marketing Campaigns Generated at a Click</p>
<p>BETEGY’s technology is changing the way sports data is visualized by users, he added. With demand for content growing ever-stronger, BETEGY’s solutions come at an important time for the industry, delivering precisely what is needed and demonstrating a new way of doing business.</p>
<p>Yolo Investments. is already using BETEGY’s products for some of its own companies and products, including Sportsbet.io, a leading sports betting company that accepts cryptocurrencies as wagers and deposits.</p>
