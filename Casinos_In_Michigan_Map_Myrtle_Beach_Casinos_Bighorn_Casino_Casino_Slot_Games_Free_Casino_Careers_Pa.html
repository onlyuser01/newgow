    <h1>Casinos In Michigan Map Myrtle Beach Casinos Bighorn Casino Casino Slot Games Free Casino Careers Pa</h1>

<p>Good day! As a Parimatch casino player, I strongly disagree with the accusations of the casino and with the confiscation of my funds in the amount of $449.29.</p>
<p>I'll go to the details.</p>
<p>On December 19, I made a deposit of 1590.00 USD. Unfortunately, luck was not on my side, and as a result of gaming activity, my account balance amounted to 449.29 USD.</p>
<p>On December 21, I received a message from the casino about the need to go through the verification procedure, providing a passport photo and a selfie with a passport. On the same day I sent the documents to the casino.</p>
<p>On December 22, the casino asked me to send a photo in the best quality, on the same day - on December 22, I fulfilled the casino's requirement.</p>
<p>On January 10, I sent a document confirming the payment for electricity.</p>
<p>On January 14, I sent a photo with a passport in my hands.</p>
<p>On February 3, at the request of the casino, I sent a photo with a passport against the background of correspondence with the Parimatch casino support service.</p>
<p>And on February 9, the casino debited my funds in the amount of 449.29 USD, pointing out my violation of clause 80.4 of the casino rules.</p>
<p>On February 9, I sent a claim to the casino with a request to provide the following information: what exactly the casino suspects me of and provide evidence of my guilt. But the casino refused to provide information on my request.</p>
<p>I also declare that no violations were committed on my part, during the verification I followed the instructions of the casino in everything, during the game I was guided by the documents of the casino.</p>
<p>I am ready to provide you with documents sent to the casino for verification. Also I am ready to pass any additional check.</p>
<p>I hope for your help in returning the debited funds in the amount of 449.29USD.</p>
