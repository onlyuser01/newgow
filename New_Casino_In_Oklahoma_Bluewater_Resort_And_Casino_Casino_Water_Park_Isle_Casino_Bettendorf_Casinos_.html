    <h1>New Casino In Oklahoma Bluewater Resort And Casino Casino Water Park Isle Casino Bettendorf Casinos</h1>

<p>Yes i followed procedure of submitting mine and his documents as requested by yeti. I was not denied access to play due to the fact that he made the deposit from his account number funding me. Once i sent all documents all was in order to withdraw when amount was low between 4000 and 12000. After few hours it was sent back to my yeti funding and the consultant informed me to please withdraw to 047 after receiving all documents knowing that it is not my account number. I continued playing and my amount increased and i won the jackpot of R25k at which point i requested a withdrawal, the next morning i received an email from Yeti to advise that my Proof of address was not acceptable and that i should upload a utilities bill as proof with i sent through that same morning with they acknowledged was acceptable and approved.</p>
<p>It was later that afternoon when i received the email after being force logged out of the account stating that they are not processing my withdrawal request.</p>
<p>I did make 2 cash deposits and received deposit bonuses for both but i played through the wager requirements on each and funds were transferred into my cash account.</p>
<p>I believe that the only reason why Yeti casino has decided to suspend my account and refuse to process my withdrawal is due to the amount which I won which is unfair practice on their part, there were numerous interactions between myself and their consultants regarding this very issue why was this not Flagged at that point. I believe that Yeti should without prejudice reinstate my account and process my withdrawal for the amount of my winnings which I played for and won fair and square and therefore am entitled to receive.</p>
<p>Thanking you kindly and awaiting your response.</p>
