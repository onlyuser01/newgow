<p>Good news for the Swedish state-owned gambling company Svenska Spel as it has extended its agreement with the Swedish soccer association, Svensk Fotboll, for seven more years. The new deal will see the two parties collaborate on various activations.</p>
<p>Svenska Spel and Svensk Fotboll Renew Partnership</p>
<p>The relationship between Sweden’s national lottery operator and the soccer association began almost three decades ago. Since signing their first agreement in 1994, the two parties have been inseparable with Svenska Spel always providing invaluable funding to amateur soccer teams and aspiring professionals.</p>
<p>With the deal extended, Svenska Spel will assist the soccer ecosystem financially and assume the responsible mission of promoting diversity, inclusivity and equality – something that has been a key focus of Svensk Fotboll in recent times.</p>
<p>As a testament to Svenska Spel’s commitment to the cause, the operator has promised to provide monetary support to the Tipselit program and help for the development of the next generation of female soccer athletes.</p>
<p>Additionally, Svenska Spel will work with Svensk Fotboll in other activations that will help to encourage diversity, equity and inclusion and will discourage harmful fraudulent practices such as match-fixing.</p>
<p>The renewed agreement is set to expire in 2028.</p>
<p>The Organizations Are Excited to Promote Inclusivity and Support Sports</p>
<p>Håkan Sjöstrand, the secretary-general of SVFF, commented on the extended deal. He said that he is glad to have Svenska Spel support Swedish soccer and is delighted by the operator’s long-term devotion. Sjöstrand added that Svenska Spel’s prolonged sponsorship provides the association with a strong foundation to continue to reinforce and advance Swedish soccer.</p>
<p>Sjöstrand continued by mentioning the importance of SVFF’s goals of promoting diversity and curbing match-fixing:</p>
<p>“The long-term perspective in Svenska Spel’s commitment to Swedish football has and will mean a great deal and it feels good that together we will continue our investments in areas such as equality, diversity and counteracting match-fixing.” SVFF secretary-general Håkan Sjöstrand</p>
<p>Patrik Hofbauer, the chief executive officer of Svenska Spel, also spoke on the continued collaboration between the two parties. He pointed out that the two have worked together for almost thirty years now and that Svenska Spel takes pride in being the biggest sponsor of Swedish soccer across all levels. He added:</p>
<p>“We continue to contribute to the development of Swedish football. At the same time, we secure long-term values ​​for Svenska Spel’s brand and business. It is a large and important investment for us.” Svenska Spel CEO Patrik Hofbauer</p>
<p>Svenska Spel has always been keen on supporting sports and has recently decided to lend its aid to esports as well. In September 2021, the company teamed up with Esportshall to nurture grassroots esports.</p>
