    <h1>Online Casinos Pa Casino Detroit Casinos Hot Springs Fremont Hotel And Casino Bspot Casino Wildblast</h1>

<p>I have used this casino for 2 years. Deposit weekly. Diamond status player. Top status.</p>
<p>they were really good. Personal vip contact was always helpful and fair. Then one day my account dropped status . 2 lower than what I was. 10 percent cash back was daily. Then changed to weekly . Then changed to monthly and lowered it to 5 percent. They didn’t issue me my entire redeemable comp points and there excuse was that they didn’t have to follow the old casino’s terms and conduction. I was not informed they were taking it over. I wasn’t warned. They say they did but I have no evidence of that. They changed the terms and conditions to suit them. I didn’t win anything after they took over. I have lost thousands. Tens of thousands. I asked for my vip free spins . 100 spins . If I deposit a certain amount during the week I get the spins Tuesday Friday Saturday. They locked my account because I got upset about not getting my vip bonus. They say it’s protocol that they can’t activate my account again for 6 days when I didn’t agree to that. And won’t issue me my vip bonus. Which I deposit knowing I would get that. I had over 115,000 comp points redeemable and they gave me 70,000 and they told me that’s all I was getting. I have evidence of all my deposits. All my bonuses. I asked for a refund of my recent deposits because i was unaware that I wouldn’t get my bonuses . I wouldn’t deposit if I new that and they said it’s not possible. They have been sneaky changing rules and bonuses. To drop me down 2 statuses and take my redeemable points off me is just shocking. I want them to refund the 55,000 dollars I’ve deposited in the last 2 years. I want to be compensated. They literally robbed me.</p>
