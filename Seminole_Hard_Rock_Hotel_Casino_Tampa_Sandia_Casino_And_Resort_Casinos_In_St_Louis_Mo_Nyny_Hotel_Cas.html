    <h1>Seminole Hard Rock Hotel Casino Tampa Sandia Casino And Resort Casinos In St Louis Mo Nyny Hotel Cas</h1>

<p>White Hat Studios has struck a content partnership deal with PlayEagle.com, expanding the reach of its products and gaining a firmer position in the US iGaming market. With a big focus put on interactive online casinos of late, suppliers and operators are doing their best to secure a better share of this burgeoning market.</p>
<p>White Hat Studios Expands Content Reach</p>
<p>White Hat Studios’ branded titles are now available in Michigan and will be further adding to the dedicated content developer’s reach in the highly-promising North American market. White Hat Studios specializes in the development of a number of excellent gaming options, including jackpots, full house, and slots.</p>
<p>White Hat Studios already has a number of established titles that have become player-favorite choices, including Deal or No Deal, Peaky Blinders, and Ted as some of the most notable branded options. They are bound to be particularly popular with players in Michigan as they have been with most of North America where White Hat Studios is already up and running.</p>
<p>PlayEagle.com is owned and operated by the Saginaw Chippewa Indian Tribe of Michigan and it owns a number of land-based properties, including Soaring Eagle Casino &amp; Resort and Saganing Eagles Landing Casino &amp; Hotel.</p>
<p>White Hat Studios VP sales &amp; marketing Daniel Lechner welcomed this partnership opportunity and said:</p>
<p>The Michigan market has been incredibly strong since its launch over a year ago. This, combined with a strong catalog of games, sets PlayEagle.com up nicely to continue taking their fair share of the state’s igaming market. White Hat Studios VP sales &amp; marketing Daniel Lechner</p>
<p>Excellent Addition to Existing Casino Content</p>
<p>Lechner welcomed the current content partnership as a long-term and fruitful opportunity. Soaring Eagle Gaming director of iGaming and sports betting operations CG Griffus was pleased with the new content partnership, saying that White Hat Studio’s content has proven “extremely popular.”</p>
<p>Griffus confirmed that Soaring Eagle Gaming was determined to actually strike the partnership and add these games to its existing offer. “We can’t wait to roll these games out and are very excited about where this partnership will go,” Griffus concluded.</p>
<p>White Hat Studios appointed Andy Whitworth as its new chief executive officer back in March. The company further expanded its content reach and clout in the regulated market by signing up a partnership with DraftKings.</p>
