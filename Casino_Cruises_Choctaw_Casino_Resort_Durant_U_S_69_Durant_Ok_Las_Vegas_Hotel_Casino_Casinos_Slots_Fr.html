<p>Fanatics Sportsbook is now committed to growing its regional footprint in the United States, as the company follows up on recently acquired licensees in regulated sports betting markets</p>
<p>Owing to licensure approval from the Maryland Lottery and Gaming Commission, Fanatics Sportsbook is now available across the State of Maryland, as the brand is undertaking its beta testing. Previously, Fanatics launched a pilot in Massachusetts.</p>
<p>All Systems Go in Maryland as US-Wide Expansion Commences</p>
<p>The company can offer mobile sports betting across the entirety of the state, and this is part of Fanatics’ ambition to take over the world of sports betting with as many as 15 states planned for launch ahead of 2023’s NFL season.</p>
<p>Apart from launching in Massachusetts and Maryland, the company has already set up shop with its mobile sportsbook in Tennessee and Ohio, signaling an ambitious roadmap for the company. The company’s recent purchase of PointsBet’s assets for $150 million certainly helped raise the company’s profile and strengthen its technological footprint.</p>
<p>Still, Fanatics has a long way to go before it can come even close to the reach and clout of BetMGM, to speak nothing of FanDuel and DraftKings. Meanwhile, its main competitors are pushing in other verticals with online casinos becoming increasingly important for company revenue.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, not everything has been going on smoothly. For one, a marketing attempt in Ohio that tried to overlap the Fanatics apparel store and sports betting bonuses was criticized by regulators, as it was seen as irresponsible and potentially targeting underage individuals. Fanatics is entering as the state’s 10th operating license and it is fairly late to the part.</p>
<p>Regardless, the company is confident that its products may find a home in the market, going up against Betfred, SuperBook, Barstool Sportsbook, Caesars, and others. The fate of PointsBet is still unclear, but the brand is also one of the operating licensees in the state, although it may be merged with Fanatics operations before long.</p>
<p>Fanatics is working with FedEx Field, the home of the Washington Commanders, which is the sportsbook’s in-state brick-and-mortar partner, allowing it to offer mobile sports betting products in the jurisdiction.</p>
