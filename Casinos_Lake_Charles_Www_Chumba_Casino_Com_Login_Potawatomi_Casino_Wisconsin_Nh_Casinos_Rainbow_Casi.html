<p>BtoBet, an iGaming and sports betting platform and services provider, has teamed up with Ngnatat Sarl Trading, a Cameroon-based omnichannel operator. Thanks to this agreement, BtoBet will be able to expand its footprint in the African country.</p>
<p>As per the deal, BtoBet will power Ngnatat Sarl Trading with its state-of-the-art sportsbook and PAM platform. The African operator will leverage BtoBet’s solutions to boost its Bet237 gambling brand and make it more appealing to local bettors. Notably, the deal will affect both Bet237’s retail and digital operations.</p>
<p>Following the partnership deal with BtoBet, Bet237 will be able to diversify its content. It will add premium sports betting content that covers the biggest athletic events in the world. Additionally, Bet237 will be able to use BtoBet’s managed trading services for full trading and risk management.</p>
<p>This agreement is made possible by STM Gaming, BtoBet’s official partner for the continent.</p>
<p>Online Gambling Is on the Rise in Africa</p>
<p>STM Gaming’s co-founder and chief executive officer, Alessandro Pizzolotto, shared his observances of the African market. He remarked that the strong GDP growth in sub-Sahara countries implies that the iGaming industry will continue to grow.</p>
<p>Although these countries are more used to traditional brick-and-mortar casinos, many people have now seen the benefits of playing online. Pizzolotto noted that mobile money helped to usher in an age of online betting and operators are now seeking to capitalize on the trend.</p>
<p>When commenting on the deal between BtoBet and Ngnatat Sarl Tradin, Pizzolotto said the former has grown to be one of the best suppliers in Africa.</p>
<p>Throughout the years BtoBet has proven itself as the leading sportsbook platform supplier for Africa, with its technologies meeting the local scenario’s requirements, which differ greatly from those of more mature markets. Alessandro Pizzolotto, CEO, STM Gaming</p>
<p>BtoBet’s Flexibility Fits the Local Market</p>
<p>Sabrina Soldà, the chief marketing officer of BtoBet, confirmed Pizzolotto’s words. She praised her company’s cutting-edge platform for its flexibility. Because of it, she noted, BtoBet continues to help its partners rise above their competition in the demanding African landscape.</p>
<p>Soldà also added that BtoBet’s localized approach adds a higher degree of customization and takes in mind numerous factors:</p>
<p>Furthermore, our localized approach, whereby we tailor our solutions to reflect not only the technological differences differentiating one country from another but also from a content perspective, enables our partners to deliver a bet stimulating experience to their players, eventually leading to the brand’s greater market share. Sabrina Soldà, CMO, BtoBet</p>
<p>A few months ago, BtoBet received approval from the Spillemyndigheden to launch its offerings in the Danish market.</p>
