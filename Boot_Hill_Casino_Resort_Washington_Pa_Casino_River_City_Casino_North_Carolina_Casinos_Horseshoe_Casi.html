<p>The terms of the new collaboration effectively grants Oddin.gg access to the esports market in the Balkans, further expanding the reach of the leading provider.</p>
<p>MaxBet and Oddin.gg Sign New Deal</p>
<p>Details of the new collaboration emerged Wednesday. Under the terms of the new deal with Oddin.gg, MaxBet will benefit from the provider’s iFrame solutions.

Those jurisdictions represent strategic markets where MaxBet has already established its casino and online betting services. At the same time, the company plans to further expand into Africa, which is a market that holds significant potential.</p>

He pointed out that MaxBet is a brand that has already established its presence in Eastern Europe after operating for two decades. Moreover, Suchar added that Oddin.gg is delighted to provide its leading iFrame solutions which will help MaxBet and at the same time acknowledged that the deal represents the company’s entry into the Balkans.</p>
<p>“We are extremely excited to be able to help them with our iFrame offering, and also to start providing our services in an entirely new market – the Balkans.“ Marek Suchar, co-founder and managing director of Oddin.gg</p>
<p>According to Suchar, Oddin.gg was on the lookout for finding a reliable partner in the region and MaxBet filled in perfectly that position. Finally, he predicted that the collaboration will bring benefits for the two companies, as well as the fans in the region.</p>
<p>“MaxBet has been constantly growing, and we are always on the lookout for new ways to improve our offerings.“ Darko Živanov, CEO at MaxBet</p>
<p>Darko Živanov, MaxBet’s CEO, added that the company is continuously growing and delivering innovative offerings is a part of its long-term goals. He pointed out the collaboration with Oddin.gg marks a “logical step,” as the company will benefit from premium esports betting services. Živanov pointed out that the esports industry continues to grow not only for the region but on a global scale.
