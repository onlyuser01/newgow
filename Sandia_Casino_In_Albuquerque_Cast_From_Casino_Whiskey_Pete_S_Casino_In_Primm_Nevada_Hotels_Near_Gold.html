    <h1>Sandia Casino In Albuquerque Cast From Casino Whiskey Pete S Casino In Primm Nevada Hotels Near Gold</h1>

<p>Two of the biggest casinos in the state of Massachusetts and a slot parlor faced a setback in August and dipped from the heights that they reached in July. Combined, the three operators generated around $92 million in August revenue, which is lower than the $95.74 million July revenue.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the Massachusetts Gaming Commission stated that the revenue share that the state will receive for the month of August will be $26.15 million. That is a slight dip from the revenue that it received in July, which was $27 million. The share that the state receives is from various taxes and fees that slots and casinos generated. July was a record-breaking month and even though August resulted in a smaller revenue, it is still way above the monthly average ($21.84 million) that all three facilities had since they opened.</p>
<p>Encore Boston Harbor Was the Leader in Revenue</p>
<p>The number 1 spot in revenue was occupied by Encore Boston Harbor. The Everett casino, which recently signed the dotted line on a legal battle concerning its property value, generated a total of $57.86 million gross-gaming revenue (GGR) in August. Slot machines contributed to $32.4 million and table games contributed to $25.4 million.</p>
<p>These numbers are the second-highest for the casino, trailing only behind the record-breaking revenue that it made in July, which was $59.07 million. The state will receive 25% of Encore’s revenue in August, which totals $14.46 million.</p>
<p>MGM Springfield had a total of $21.8 million in revenue in August and slots were the main revenue generator, with $17 million. The 25% in taxes and fees that the state of Massachusetts is due equals $5.45 million.</p>
<p>Plainridge Park Casino also had a decent run, as it followed up on its July numbers. July was the best month in terms of revenue since Encore’s opening in 2019, while August was its second-best. The slots parlor in Plainville had a total of $180 million in wagers in August and recorded a revenue of $12.73 million. That means that 92.93% of the wagers were winning wagers by the players and hence, Plainridge Park Casino has the best payout percentage of all three operators.</p>
<p>Sports Betting Was Also Approved in Massachusetts Recently</p>
<p>Thanks to the US Supreme Court’s decision to dissolve PASPA, the laws on this industry were loosened throughout the state. In July, the House voted in favor of legalizing sports betting in Massachusetts (156-3), something that was long overdue, according to a bipartisan parade of representatives.</p>
<p>Rep. Dan Cahill commented on the legalization back then with a few simple words. He said that people should be allowed to have fun and that is exactly what sports betting will provide them.</p>
