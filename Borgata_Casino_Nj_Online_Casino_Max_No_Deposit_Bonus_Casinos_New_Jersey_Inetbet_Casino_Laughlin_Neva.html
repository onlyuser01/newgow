    <h1>Borgata Casino Nj Online Casino Max No Deposit Bonus Casinos New Jersey Inetbet Casino Laughlin Neva</h1>

<p>I am sorry I could not be of more help on this occasion.</p>
<p>Additionally, you have made a large number of bets that have breached the rules. As the casino acted in accordance with its terms and conditions regarding this, and considering all of the above, I am afraid there is nothing further we can hope to achieve and the complaint will now be rejected.</p>
<p>We also believe that the rules should be displayed prominently in the specific terms for the promotion. Although this is not exactly how the casino has presented its bonuses, there is a link to the relevant terms provided, and in particular, the max bet rule is highlighted within the terms to make it stand out.</p>
<p>Instead of checking for terms breaches at the point of a withdrawal request, we believe that it is best when the max bet rule is enforced by the casino software, but this is not currently the industry standard and we can't penalize the casino for not operating in this way.</p>
<p>After further review of all of the information provided, I am afraid I must inform you that we can assist you no further with this case.</p>
