<p>Sumsub has launched a new dedicated full cycle verification, anti-fraud and compliance solution tailored specifically for the needs of gaming operators and platforms which will help strengthen partners’ offers and ensure that they operate legally while upholding the highest industry standards required by their license, Casino Guru News learned in an email press release.</p>
<p>Specifically, the platform has made sure to leverage compliance and boost revenue throughout a player’s lifecycle, and provide partners with a holistic verification solution that doesn’t stop at user onboarding, but continues with fraud prevention, and compliance as mentioned. There are four main pillars on which the new solution has focused, with the company citing Player Onboarding as its first step in delivering this 360-degree experience.</p>
<p>Sumsub is equipped to ensure that onboarding runs smoothly, covering KYC/AML, proof of address, and age of verification, all of which is carried out effortlessly and without any issues. The platform also uses Fraud Prevention which helps operators ward against bonus abuse, affiliate fraud, account takeovers, scams, and more. Reputation and fraud-related losses are significantly reduced owing to this particular pillar.</p>
<p>Commenting about this opportunity, Sumsub Co-founder and Chief Innovation Officer Jacob Sever has explained the significance of this all-in-one solution that addresses specific market and industry needs.</p>
<p>"Gaming operators are overwhelmed with the need for separate solutions such as verification, bonus abuse prevention and player risk analysis," Sever added.</p>
<p>Sever acknowledged that there were solutions that tried to do this as well, but he also cautioned that those companies were not specialized in the gaming industry, meaning that they still miss out on some key areas that gaming operators and platforms need to have fully met.</p>
<p>Players also suffer from such solutions as the customer journey in gaming is different than that in other industries. However, Sumsub’s Full Cycle platform is "fully customized to the industry, player geographies, and user profiles in gaming," Sever noted.</p>
<p>The solution also features the Player Risk Profiling and Analytics module which will flag suspicious activities and analyze behavioral patterns. Not least, Sumsub is equally committed to Responsible Gaming (RG) Compliance which enables operators and platforms to spot risky gambling behavior more easily and stay compliant with industry standards for responsible gambling in the first place.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Sumsub and Casino Guru launched an AML &amp; KYC course to help educate industry stakeholders about the industry-specific requirements in so far these two areas are concerned.</p>
