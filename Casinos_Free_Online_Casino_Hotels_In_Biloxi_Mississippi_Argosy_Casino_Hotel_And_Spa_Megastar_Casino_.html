    <h1>Casinos Free Online Casino Hotels In Biloxi Mississippi Argosy Casino Hotel And Spa Megastar Casino</h1>

<p>Livespins, a company that has completely transformed the way slots are played and streamed, has now expanded its number of supplier partners with the addition of Wazdan Games, a prominent studio and developer of iGaming content, Casino Guru News learned in a press release shared via email.</p>
<p>As a result of the partnership, Wazdan Games will now be available through Livespins’ powerful social live-streaming platform which is focused on connecting audiences with gaming and brand ambassadors. Through this tie-up, streamers will be able to play Wazdan Games on stream and allow players to participate in the action as well.</p>
<p>Livespins already has a portfolio of fantastic partners, including companies such as Relax Gaming, iSoftBet, and Yggdrasil. The company will now involve audiences with games provided by Wazdan, including Burning Sun, Hot Slot: 777 Rubies, 9 Coins, Power of Sun and others.</p>
<p>More games will be arriving as well. The way Livespins works is simple. Streamers will pick a slot and play. Audiences will be able to place a wager on the outcome of a streamer’s spin of the reels for example. The product is integrated through a dedicated interface with popular operators.</p>
<p>Most of the casinos that support Livespins games do so through a dedicated category on their website. Viewers need not go to great financial lengths in order to participate either. Rather, they can adjust the size of their own bet independent of what the streamer is betting – or other viewers are wagering.</p>
<p>Livespins has been particularly successful in recent months, having established a significant presence in the iGaming sector, through partnerships with Yolo Group (the company behind Bitcasino.io), Mansion Group, WynnBet, and Bitstarz to name just a few.</p>
<p>Livespins CCO Michael Pedersen commented on this opportunity and said that he was excited to see Livespins grow its unique offer with the addition of Wazdan. "It really is changing the game by providing an entirely new way to experience the online casino," Pedersen said.</p>
<p>Wazdan CCO Andrzej Hyla was similarly pleased with the deal. He hailed the integration with Livespins as an important milestone for his company and said that the company will have the opportunity to leverage its products in a responsible and sustainable way in the long term.</p>
<p>"It also provides a huge opportunity to showcase our games and unique engagement-boosting features to new audiences and the next generation of players," Hyla wrapped up.</p>
