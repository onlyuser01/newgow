<p>Ohio to Give Five COVID-19 Vaccinated Residents $1M Each Through Special Lottery</p>

<p>The state of Ohio will turn five residents into millionaires starting in two weeks, and their shot at a $1 million prize is just that — a COVID-19 vaccination shot.</p>

<p>Gov. Mike DeWine (R) made the stunning announcement Wednesday night. Starting on May 26 and every Wednesday after that for the next five weeks, the Ohio Lottery will conduct a drawing of adult residents of the Buckeye State who have received at least one dose of a vaccine.</p>
<p>And, yes, the person whose name is drawn – provided they were vaccinated before the drawing took place – will receive $1 million.</p>
<p>“Now, I know that some of you are now shaking your heads and saying, ‘That Mike DeWine, he’s crazy! This million-dollar drawing idea of yours is a waste of money,’” DeWine said during his COVID-19 briefing. “But truly, the real waste at this point in the pandemic — when the vaccine is readily available to anyone who wants it… is a life that is lost now to COVID-19.”</p>
<p>The money for the “Ohio Vax-a-Million” drawings will come from federal funds given to the state from COVID-19 relief packages.</p>
<p>Additional details will come out starting on Thursday, the governor added.</p>
<p>COVID-19 Vaccination Rates Dropping</p>
<p>As the rate of COVID-19 vaccinations has dropped in the past month, states have looked for creative ways to entice the holdouts to get a shot.</p>
<p>In Kentucky earlier this week, Gov. Andy Beshear (D) announced adults who get a shot at a participating Kroger or Walmart would get a free play for a Kentucky Lottery Cash Ball 225 drawing.</p>
<p>Ohio, according to data from the Johns Hopkins University of Medicine Coronavirus Research Center, has seen its seven-day average daily vaccinations go from 140,532 on April 11 to just 52,205 on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Across Ohio, nearly 9.2 million doses of vaccines have been administered, and nearly 4 million people are completely vaccinated. That equates to roughly 34 percent of the state.</p>
<p>Roughly, that means about 5.2 million Ohio residents have received a shot. Some of those are children, as the Pfizer vaccine has been approved for kids as young as 12 years old.</p>
<p>DeWine, though, isn’t keeping the kids out of the fun. While they cannot win a $1 million prize, the governor said kids who have received at least one dose will be entered into a separate drawing. Over a five-week span, the state will award five full-ride scholarships to a state university.</p>
<p>The state will create an electronic portal that will allow eligible kids to register for the drawings.</p>
<p>Ohio Vax-A-Million Draws Variety of Viewpoints</p>
<p>DeWine’s COVID-19 lottery plan drew a mixed response on social media.</p>
<p>Some, like Josh Mandel, Ohio’s former state treasurer, and a fellow Republican, used a popular Oprah meme to chide DeWine.</p>

<p>Others said the state could spend $5 million in taxpayer funds in better ways. For example, the money could go toward helping small businesses affected by COVID-19 shutdowns and restrictions. Or, Ohio could provide aid to a lot more individuals.</p>
<p>Wow, I didn't think I could be anymore disappointed in government. Help poor people impacted by covid… nah, let's have a lottery, cause the first one has helped the schools so much. — Dan (@tinysmalls45) May 12, 2021</p>
<p>However, there were several who saw the idea as a creative way to encourage more people to get a vaccine. Even if felt like something out of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.</p>
