<p>Leap Gaming’s team will now become a part of IMG ARENA with Leap CEO Yariv Lissauer becoming senior director &amp; general manager</p>
<p>Sports betting data specialist IMG ARENA has concluded its acquisition of the high-end virtual games provider Leap Gaming. The agreement was originally announced in December 2022 and is expected to further popularize the former company.</p>
<p>By acquiring Leap Gaming, IMG ARENA has also acquired the company’s cutting-edge games and solutions, including its 3D motion capture technology. The products, IMG said, will be combined with official IPs from the company’s vast roster of rightsholder clients.</p>
<p>The move will help IMG ARENA unlock new revenue streams for its sports betting clients by providing operators with an enhanced content portfolio.</p>
<p>Following the closure of the deal, Leap Gaming and its team of 50+ people, including Yariv Lissauer, are now part of IMG ARENA. Lissauer, formerly serving as chief executive officer of Leap, has now been appointed as senior director &amp; general manager at IMG ARENA.</p>
<p>Leap Gaming supplies solutions to 120 sportsbooks all over the world. Acquiring the company will greatly expand IMG’s footprint. The current merger is the culmination of IMG ARENA and Leap Gaming’s relationship.</p>
<p>IMG ARENA Will Enhance Its Offer</p>
<p>Freddie Longe, IMG ARENA’s president, addressed the now-concluded deal. He noted that the new acquisition will help his team enhance its sports betting offer.</p>
<p>The addition of Leap Gaming to our sports betting content portfolio will enable us to enhance our offer to sportsbooks and lead the way in shaping the future of sports betting entertainment. Freddie Longe, president, IMG ARENA</p>
<p>Longe concluded that IMG ARENA is looking forward to unlocking new forms of fan engagement and additional revenue streams.</p>
<p>IMG ARENA specializes in delivering live streaming and data feeds for more than 45,000 sports events each year. In addition to that, the company supplies on-demand virtual sports products and front-end solutions, such as its UFC Event Centre. Some of the company’s clients include notable sporting leagues, such as the UFC, DP World Tour, PGA Tour, MLS and the FA.</p>
<p>IMG ARENA Is Suing Stats Perform</p>
<p>In a fairly recent development, IMG ARENA took Stats Perform to court over unauthorized soccer data collection. According to the former company, its competitor breached the data collection rules by unlawfully collecting data during Austrian, Czech, German, Greek, and Swiss soccer matches.</p>
<p>According to IMG ARENA, Stats Perform is behind an unauthorized network of data collectors or scouts who obtained real-time data from games that are covered by IMG Arena’s exclusive soccer license.</p>
<p>IMG ARENA estimates the damages at $1.6 million.</p>
