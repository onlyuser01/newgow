<p>The Indonesian Basketball League (IBL), announced it strengthened its integrity operations by expanding its existing partnership with Genius Sports, a globally-recognized and trusted integrity partner of more than 150 sports leagues and federations around the world. The new extended partnership, announced Tuesday, will see the IBL better tackle match-fixing threats.</p>
<p>This will be achieved via the launch of a robust integrity program. Under the program, Genius will supply IBL with specialist forensic insights and data for the global betting activities on its events. Genius' Bet Monitoring System will play a key role in the process by analyzing real-time odds movement.</p>
<p>Additionally, the system will compare those movements with "cross-referenced with predictive algorithms to automatically detect and flag any suspicious activity," a statement released by Genius Sports reveals. The company's team of integrity analysts will contribute to this process by analyzing the reports for the League's events. The IBL will also receive detailed reports regularly.</p>
<p>As a part of the broader efforts of the IBL, more than 300 of its coaches, players and officials have been provided with educational workshops led by experts. These workshops help underline the League's efforts toward integrity and teach about the dire consequences of match-fixing threats such as disclosing internal information.</p>
<p>Genius Sports' Head of Sports and Broadcast, APAC, Mohamed Feizel, said on the topic: "Sports must remain highly vigilant and proactive in their fight against match-fixing." He added: "We're honored to be the Official Integrity Partner of the IBL and supporting them in the delivery of a comprehensive program that combines round-the-clock monitoring with educational services to safeguard their competitions."</p>
<p>As noted, the aforementioned collaboration represents an extension of Genius' partnership with the IBL. The duo had a long-term data partnership signed that involved the use of Genius' basketball data collection system called FIBA LiveStats. The unique technology is used for every IBL game courtside and helps deliver official play-by-play statistics that can be used by stakeholders around the world.</p>
<p>Junas Miradiarsyah, IBL's Chief Executive Officer, was similarly delighted about the expanded partnership with Genius Sports. "This collaboration is a proactive effort for the league to continue to safeguard the transparency and competitiveness of our competitions," he said.</p>
<p>Finally, Miradiarsyah noted: "Monitoring and education are vitally important to protecting the IBL and we're pleased to be working with Genius Sports who are the trusted integrity partner to hundreds of sports leagues worldwide."</p>
