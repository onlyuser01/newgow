<p>The Czech lottery operator Allwyn was recently awarded with UK’s fourth National Lottery license following months of legal hurdles. Now, the company will reinforce its board with new members who will support the transition of lottery responsibilities from Camelot to Allwyn. Both of them were identified and invited to Allwyn with Audeliss Executive Search’s help.</p>
<p>Sharon Doherty Believes Allwyn Can Create a More Modern Lottery</p>
<p>As announced by Allwyn, Sharon Doherty and Victoria McKenzie-Gould will be joining the company as independent non-executive directors. Their crucial expertise will help with the implementation of the lottery specialist’s transition plan.</p>
<p>Doherty is the chief people and places officer at Lloyds Banking group. Prior to joining the latter, she held executive positions at big tech and telecommunication companies such as Finastra, Vodafone and BAA Heathrow Airport. Her executive career saw her greatly expand Vodafone’s business which is a valuable experience that will help her assist Allwyn. As a part of Allwyn’s board, she will work closely with the lottery company’s chief people officer and chief social value officer.</p>
<p>Doherty said that she feels delighted to join Allwyn and help it with its transformative digital process. She is glad to be responsible for an organization as influential as the National Lottery and believes Allwyn can improve it by harnessing hi-tech solutions.</p>
<p>I believe there’s so much potential to create a bigger, better, safer and more appealing National Lottery by embracing the power of digital. Sharon Doherty, independent NED, Allwyn</p>
<p>Victoria McKenzie-Gould Noted That the Lottery Is a National Treasure</p>
<p>McKenzie-Gould, on the other hand, is very experienced when it comes to working with investors. She is currently serving as the corporate affairs director at Marks &amp; Spencer and is responsible for digitalizing the company’s business. Previously, McKenzie-Gould worked as PM Tony Blair’s special adviser. She also held leadership positions at various leading companies including Tesco and Britvic.</p>
<p>The appointee is well-familiar with the corporate sector and has the experience needed to help Allwyn with a seamless lottery transition. As an independent NED, she will alongside Allwyn’s chief compliance, risk and security officer and corporate affairs director.</p>
<p>McKenzie-Gould noted that the National Lottery is not just a lottery but a national treasure as well. According to her, Allwyn has a great plan to reinvigorate the lottery and build upon the existing offerings and products.</p>
<p>My immediate focus will be on supporting the implementation of Allwyn’s detailed transition plan allowing us, in turn, to ensure the customer is firmly at the heart of the lottery, able to enjoy an exciting and safe experience when we hit the ground running in February 2024. Victoria McKenzie-Gould, independent NED, Allwyn</p>
<p>Justin King, Allwyn’s chairman, said that the team is excited to have the two women on board. He believes that their skills will be of great help to the operator’s transition efforts.</p>
