    <h1>Adrenaline Casino Cass Lake Casino Ac Casinos Viejas Casino And Resort Bluelake Casino Raging Bull S</h1>

<p>I deposited $30 and I won. I tried to request a withdraw of the winnings but it stated I needed to upload some documents to verify my identity. The site then lead me to another site named hoyoo where I was to upload my ID and a selfie picture. When it was approved it said to press the continue button when I did - it lead me to a web page that no longer functions- it was an error page. Strange so I peddled back to the original ragging bulls website and it still I needed to verify my identity - It continued to do this several times and several times I uploaded until I realized I was going in circles. I reached out to CS they said to upload the documents to an email and send - I did. This morning I awoke and checked the account - the funds are no longer in the Ragging bull account. The transaction history states that the funds have been approved for withdraw by the manager- I checked my debit card - there has been no funds deposited. I contact CS they looked into it and stated that there is a discrepancy with my deposit and now they want a document of my statement showing the deposit amount to them- and that the email of the confirmation receipt that they sent me on the day that I deposited doesn't count as proof of the deposit. Fine I go to my cash app account because that is the card and account that I used to deposit the money - and the transaction is not there anymore!!! I don't know what is going on but I deposited the money legitimately and they have records of the deposit - I have screen shots of the records from the ragging bull site along with the email that they sent and hopefully cash app can help me get the record of the transaction because if there was no transaction then how would I have had any credits to play the slots and win all that money?? I feel like they are trying to scam me somehow so that they don't have to pay me what I won. I'm so upset - this is not ok and it's not right to be taking people's money like this. Please help me.</p>
