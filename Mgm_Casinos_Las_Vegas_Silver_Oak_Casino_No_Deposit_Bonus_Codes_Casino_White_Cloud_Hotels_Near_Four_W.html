<p>A new study launched by the University of Exeter seeks to determine if ketamine can help people affected by gambling addiction</p>
<p>Details of the new study emerged on Thursday last week. The new study will be led by Celia Morgan, an Exeter researcher and professor of psychopharmacology. The University of Exeter supports the new study which is funded by a grant from the leading biotechnology company that develops new solutions for treating addictions, Awakn Life Sciences.</p>
<p>University of Exeter Launches New Research</p>
<p>Ultimately, the new study will probe into whether a small dosage of ketamine can help down the positive reinforcement that gamblers experience. At the same time, the first-of-its-kind study will seek to determine if this process can help decrease the urge to gamble for gamblers. According to the University of Exeter, the participants in the study need to meet three criteria: they need to be above the age of 18, need to be fluent in speaking English and need to gamble regularly.</p>
<p>“The new research aims to investigate whether ketamine’s influence on human memory can be used to break down the positive reinforcement associated with gambling addictions while also preventing the urge to gamble,“ reads a statement released by the University of Exeter</p>
<p>The participants in the study will go through a screening process before they engage in the experiment. Besides health-related questions, the participants will undergo physical tests as well. Overall, the experiment will last for 30 days and participants in the project will receive vouchers as a form of compensation.</p>
<p>A First-Of-Its-Kind Experiment</p>
<p>As with other addictions such as the ones to drugs, alcohol or food, memory plays a key role in the positive reinforcement that is associated with the action. By using an anaesthetic drug such as ketamine, in small doses, the study will seek to determine if this positive reinforcement toward gambling addiction can be altered.</p>
<p>“The study is the first of its kind in the world. Gambling problems devastate lives and we urgently need new treatments.“ Celia Morgan, professor of psychopharmacology with the University of Exeter</p>
<p>The lead professor of the new study, Morgan, explained that the experiment is the first of its kind. She pointed out that problem gambling destroys the lives of the people affected which is why a revolutionary form of treatment is needed. The professor added that it is a privilege for the University of Exeter to lead this important study. Finally, Morgan said that she hopes the new experiment will help develop new treatments for people affected by problem gambling.</p>
