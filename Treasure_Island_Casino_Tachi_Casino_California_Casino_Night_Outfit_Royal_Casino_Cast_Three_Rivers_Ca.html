    <h1>Treasure Island Casino Tachi Casino California Casino Night Outfit Royal Casino Cast Three Rivers Ca</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I did not know that this applies as they said in their emphasis and clarification:</p>
<p>(Kahuna) - Emphasis added for clarity.</p>
<p>Please note that the 10% rule applies to the balance, not the deposit value. Therefore, the deposit of 50 euros is not the factor in determining the bet size.</p>
<p>If the balance is 40 euros, the bet size needs to be adjusted to 4 euros to comply with our rules.</p>
<p>I have always deposited €150 each and played with bonuses 50% at least. andd played with 5€ until my balance was 0€. If I had known that I would have to change my bet from 4 euros then to 3 euros then to 2 € because my credit value is 40 € or then 30 € or then 20 € I would have done this too,</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this simplified text that you gave as an example is not in the bonus conditions! Every player understands that. If you look at the 10% clause or €5 value, players assume that they mean the lower value with the real money or bonus money, these conditions apply. For example, a €150 real money deposit with a 50% bonus would be worth:</p>
<p>Real money150€ : 10% clause or 5€ max bet rule value = (150€ 10% = 15€) max bet rule 5€ would be the lower value</p>
<p>and at this bonus of 50% with a deposit of 150€</p>
<p>Bonus balance €75 10% clause or €5 max bet rule value= (€75 10% = €7.5) max bet rule if the smaller value (€5) was less than 10%</p>
<p>but as i told you before, this is not a nice limitation when the 10% is permanent on every current balance after every spin.</p>
<p>This is correct as I can see in your game history as I received a screenshot via email, I played the previous games when I fell below a value of €50 playing a bet of €5 but I assumed that was the starting amount or the bonus amount at the beginning of it 105 or 5€ max bet rule does not apply to the permanent value of the balance after each spin it applies.</p>
<p>In this regard, I also find it a clear impertinence, as it also says in their BONUS CONDITIONS: Repeated misuse can lead to the termination of the account and confiscation of credit. "</p>
<p>Then why are they giving me deposit bonuses after 2 unknowing breaches of these bonus terms and conditions? So that they confiscate my winnings! I would have accepted a lot more an email because I violated bonus conditions and my account was closed, but it is worse to simply confiscate the money after the wagering and how is it still possible to play with a bonus in your casino and the pay out winnings?</p>
<p>because the terms and conditions say winnings can be confiscated from the following bonuses!</p>
<p>purely theoretically in the future not at all anymore because profits are confiscated now and every time one makes 1-2 times a mistake and the remaining future profits can always and will always be confiscated.</p>
<p>you will be punished for the future always and every time because this right is permanent.</p>
<p>For this reason I will no longer play at Kahuna and you lose a player and please change the BONUS CONDITIONS and write it correctly with a small example as you named it here so that future players are warned and understand this rule, otherwise players and you will lose they don't get their money back it's unfair.</p>
<p>And I also wanted to tell you that my winnings in this deposit bonus of 50% real money deposit of 150 € the smallest balance of 75 € was in the game and the max bet rule is 5 €. since the smallest value there is lower than your 10% clause</p>
<p>and each deposit bonus is separate and cannot be compared to any other bonus, i regard my winnings as legal as i have not broken any rules for this bonus.</p>
<p>The previously used bonus that is correct, I made a bet of €5 with a credit value of €50 because, as I mentioned to you above, I did not know that my credit value after each spin was subject to the 10% clause or €5 max bet rule are valid</p>
<p>have a nice friendly day to you</p>
<p>Kind regards, Thomas h.</p>
