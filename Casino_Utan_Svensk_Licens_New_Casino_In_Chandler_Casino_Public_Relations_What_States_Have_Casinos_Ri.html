So am talking every day with support and we a spinning in circles it was obviously some kind of confusion ! And today a was informed from live support that first they need to processed my first 2 withdrawals and then the 3 one. The first withdrawal was almost 2 week ago and I received the money ..the second withdrawal request was one week ago and i received the money! But in the casino system in my account the withdrawals are still pending! And like a said i received the money from 2 precious withdrawals! I explain that to support that I received the money and that my 2 previous withdrawals are successful processed and that the money are in my bank account. I send them a print screen from my online banking showing that received the money from my 2 first withdrawals..but no help am still been told that I need to wait my first 2 withdrawals to be processed..and then they will send the 3 one!! So help please!! If you need I can send you additional the print screen to confirm that I received the money from the 2 previous withdrawals. Thanks!</p>
