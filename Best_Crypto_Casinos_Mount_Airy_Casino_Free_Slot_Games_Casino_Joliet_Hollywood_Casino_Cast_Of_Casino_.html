    <h1>Best Crypto Casinos Mount Airy Casino Free Slot Games Casino Joliet Hollywood Casino Cast Of Casino</h1>

<p>To explain everything here again with the proofs i have:</p>
<p>I played at 500 casino a long time ago, put an all in and should have gotten around $3100, however it was pulled from the site during the spin due to a rounding error. When I contacted support at the beginning, it was difficult for me to get through and was just ignored, at some point the owner answered me and said yes, that's very unlucky, but if we pay you off it would be a lose-lose situation for us.</p>
<p>When I then said that they had already paid many other people for the bug, they said that wasn't true, when I then showed proofs, they said that it was something different, even though it was completely the same situation.</p>
<p>I later said that it was a bug on your part and that it wasn't my fault because I placed the bet, if I had lost I would have accepted it, but I bet and therefore the profit from your bug is also the "rounding bug". " stopped me from doing it, so it's your fault.</p>
<p>then they denied for a while that it was a rounding bug, then I showed a video proof of the bug and also the bug again, of all things, from the currency BUX in $ where you can see exactly that it was a bug from them. then they finally admitted it and said it wouldn't change anything etc.</p>
<p>At some point I was just ignored and blocked. when i asked other admins from other casinos they just said it was stupid arguments from the owner and they paid me out.</p>
<p>I've added some screenshots in the attachment, including how the owner talked about the rounding error a year ago, which supposedly should be fixed because something wasn't right. So that means he didn't even inform the users about it.</p>
<p>then another picture where you can see the rounding error well, I deposited a $100 gift card which exactly 166,600 BUX are the equivalent of $100 but in the system are only $99.99 in $. (clearly a bug of 500 caisno)</p>
<p>and finally an email from the crazy time providers who should check the case where it says that the bet was placed and rejected because I didn't have enough balance (although I just had it, you can also calculate in the picture)</p>
<p>And by the way, that was also the manslaughter argument from the owner that I supposedly lie and never had enough balance, although it speaks against him. (" Tell me more how we're the bad guys here" )</p>
<p>all unnecessary lies and excuses from the casino, and why? because they just wanted to talk their way out of the situation.</p>
<p>In addition, the owner insulted me unnecessarily several times as a idiot and so on ðŸ˜€</p>
