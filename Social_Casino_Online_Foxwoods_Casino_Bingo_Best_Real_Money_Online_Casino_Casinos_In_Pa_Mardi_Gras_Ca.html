<p>The study sheds light on the gambling activity that unfolds during such high-profile events and their aftermath. Its findings will help the British regulator make better-informed decisions and remain in touch with the ever-changing global gaming landscape. Analyzing these interactions will help the commission enhance its regulatory measures and promote responsible gambling practices.</p>
<p>Impressive Participation Yielded Reliable Results</p>
<p>The UKGC commissioned fieldwork and data collection company Yonder Data Solutions to examine the gambling activity during and after the 2022 FIFA World Cup. Yonder’s approach involved contacting individuals who engaged in betting during the tournament. Respondents answered questions about their gambling behaviors and attitudes over the preceding four weeks.</p>
<p>The study yielded valuable insights by re-contacting the same people in March to uncover any changes in their gambling behavior. 811 individuals participated in both surveys, forming a solid foundation for the research’s conclusions. Such data will be invaluable in the UKGC’s efforts to promote safe gambling during similar high-profile events.</p>
<p>The World Cup Had a Significant Impact on Bettors</p>
<p>According to the UK regulator, the data revealed several notable trends. Compared to the 12 months used for previous surveys, respondents reflected on the period since the world cup. However, average gambling participation increased. Although wager amounts dropped significantly, the higher-than-average engagement signifies that high-profile sports events can efficiently onboard and retain gambling customers.</p>
<p>The UKGC also examined the results according to its Path to Play framework, determining that most World Cup bettors engaged with gambling to add excitement to the game, often choosing to participate due to influence from friends. These findings mean participants are less likely to wager “For the Money,” making them less at risk of problem gambling.</p>
<p>This reinforces the view that betting on the World Cup was more of a social experience than normal football betting. UKGC report</p>
<p>Despite the prevailing social aspect of World Cup gambling, it led to continued betting engagement for a third of participants, demonstrating its potential status as a “gateway” event. Gambling harm data was inconclusive, prompting the UKGC to consider additional research as the 2023 FIFA Women’s World Cup final is just around the corner.</p>
<p>By engaging in such investigations, the UKGC continues to equip itself with actionable insights to protect bettors and address potential challenges in the gambling landscape. The regulator’s efforts reflect its commitment to maintaining a balanced and transparent gambling sector that prioritizes consumer well-being and responsible gambling practices.</p>
