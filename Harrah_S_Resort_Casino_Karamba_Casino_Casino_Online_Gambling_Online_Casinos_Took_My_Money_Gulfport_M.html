    <h1>Harrah S Resort Casino Karamba Casino Casino Online Gambling Online Casinos Took My Money Gulfport M</h1>

<p>I received a sign on free chip of $40 and the play through was 50x. I had completed it and cashed out my $100 max cash out. I then sent in the request verification information. $ days later I was approved for the verification. I deposited $15 with bitcoin for the withdraw and I then checked my account. I seen the withdraw was reversed and my $15 deposit had a bonus attached to it. I then contacted the support team and they said that I needed to send in $35 to make the $50 deposit for the withdraw. I read the terms and conditions and it was 50% of my free chip. Which would have been $20. They then said I forfeited the game which I never did cause I wouldn't. At that time they said that they were wrong I never forfeited it was cause I didn't finish the play through. I stated that I had cause I cashed out and had checked and the bonus said completed. We went back and forth for over an hour. I said that I wanted to get the new bonus off my account that I didn't authorize it. They said faience put it on there cause that was the remaining amount of play through I needed to completed the first bonus. I said that I want to with draw my $15 and they said with an active bonus that the system wont allow it. I asked then how did I cash out from the first bonus if it was incomplete. I asked to speak to faience and they told me that faience has no contact with players I have to go through customer support. So I decided to play the new bonus and I won. I then looked at my transactions after talking to the team again to verify I completed it. My transactions said I forfeited the new bonus. I saved the transcripts of my communications with them and I also recorded our conversations. This is a complete scam and I want people to know what they are doing, If I would of sent more money like they wanted at first I believe that they still would have said that I never completed it. Also on the transaction report it says I lost for the first bonus not that it was incomplete. Please help me. I have no way of contacting any one but the same people over and over.</p>
