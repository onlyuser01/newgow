    <h1>Everygame Casino No Deposit Bonus Casino Durant Poconos Casino Tropica Casino Royal Caribbean Casino</h1>

<p>EvenBet has decided to significantly strengthen its content library with the addition of the prolific developer</p>
<p>KA Gaming is a studio that has developed close to 500 games and continues to develop new experiences for the iGaming industry, with many titles falling in the fish and shooting games category as well.</p>
<p>EvenBet Secures KA Gaming to Pivot Strongly Towards Asia</p>
<p>As a result of this new tie-up, both companies will be seen benefiting. EvenBet Gaming will significantly expand the available titles it has to offer players and KA Gaming will get a springboard from which it can launch its hundreds of products globally.</p>
<p>KA Gaming is also a prominent and trusted developer of games in the Asian iGaming market and it has consistently delivered outstanding titles across many important categories, such as online, land-based, and mobile slots, all underpinned by robust omnichannel experiences.</p>
<p>The studio is also a significant addition to EvenBet’s existing library of games which already features more than 1,000 games from leading suppliers across the world. KA Gaming is bringing close to a 50% increase in this overall capacity, giving the aggregator a significant boost.</p>
<p>Moreover, the studio is prepared to provide EvenBet partners with excellent player retention rates and lifetime value as its titles are developed following marketing trends and consumer behavior. All titles are optimized for maximum engagement, retention, and enjoyment.</p>
<p>EvenBet Gaming CEO Dmitry Starostenkov said that KA Gaming has a unique approach to casino games which will now help the company further expand its own reach with existing and new markets. Starostenkov spoke about the Asian pivot the companies are now setting together:</p>
<p>Securing this deal to add the company’s content to our own gaming platform is great news for our operator customers, particularly those in Asia considering KA Gaming’s existing standing in this part of the world. EvenBet Gaming CEO Dmitry Starostenkov</p>
<p>KA Gaming commercial manager David Charnley was similarly pleased with the opportunity and said that partnering with EvenBet Gaming was a significant opportunity for the developer to reach new operators and players with what is excellent content through and through.</p>
<p>“EvenBet has produced an innovative poker and gaming platform, and we truly believe players will appreciate the exciting titles that we have to offer,” Charnley concluded.</p>
