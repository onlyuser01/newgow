<p>Games Global has signed up a partnership with a new dedicated studio and developer, OROS Gaming. Moving forward, OROS Gaming’s products and titles will be part of Games Global’s network of operators and developers, with the studio helping the aggregator improve its overall offer and variety.</p>
<p>OROS Gaming Becomes Latest Addition to Games Global</p>
<p>OROS Gaming originally started as a company that focused almost exclusively on the land-based casino sector, but it has made strides into the iGaming industry, and successfully at that. Bringing popular titles on the online market has been definitely welcomed by operators and aggregators. The partnership was hailed by OROS Gaming founder Ryan Cuddy who said that the company was aware of the importance that operators put on their players.</p>
<p>That is why, Cuddy said, the company makes sure to take care of players in a way that allows partner brands to show their customer bases that they are appreciated and cherished. Cuddy assured that OROS Gaming is keen to expand its portfolio in partnership with Games Global and raise the quality bar and standard on the platform.</p>
<p>OROS Gaming commenced its journey in iGaming with 9 Bass and Chilli Inferno and is continuing to build up its portfolio which will be growing even more with Games Global’s reach and market penetration. The studio has already a good track record for building compelling games that stand out by virtue of their graphics and game mechanics.</p>
<p>OROS Gaming has been delivering on such excellent titles as Chili Inferno, its Link&amp;Win and WinBooster mechanics, and more titles, such as Quick Cash for even more worthwhile iGaming experiences. All of the studio releases so far have been able to innovate its internal development practices and offer players and partner operators slightly different gameplay options.</p>
<p>OROS Gaming Determined to Take Good Care of Players</p>
<p>OROS Gaming has leveraged its experience in the land-based sector to better create products that address the needs of customers directly and efficiently. Commenting on this partnership, Games Global CPO Andrew Booth said:</p>
<p>It’s a thrilling time for both Games Global and OROS Gaming. We’ve seen great results from their initial releases and are excited to see how their innovation delivers. We’re looking forward to discovering what’s in store as we look towards 2023 and beyond. Games Global CPO Andrew Booth</p>
<p>Games Global is able to distribute the games through its newly launched Games Global PLUS content distribution solution.</p>
