    <h1>Hilton Aruba Caribbean Resort Casino The Mirage Hotel And Casino In Las Vegas Nevada Casinos In Aust</h1>

<p>I opend an account at Thunderbolt Casino...no problem. Start playing, take up bonusses, deposit money, playing, deposit money and so going on. I won 10 000.00 in July 2020 and asked the casino to pay out the winnings on various chat rooms. I was informed that I need to submit certain documents which I did...on various occasions. One of the documents was a photo of my Id.</p>
<p>Everytime when I asked for the payout, I received congratulations on my big winnings and reasured from the "consultant" that the documents is received and all is well. Then I received an email stating they want a colour copy of my aswell as my husbands..why my husbands I don't know. Which by the way I send. And everytime when I got worried for not receiving any emails or confirmation on the date the payment will be done, I get a "please email the documents asked for" or the documents is received and they are busy with the verifying of it. "This will take 5 to 7 days" to complete and that I will be emailed when this is done....no reply...no emails. And so it carried on. I took screenshots of each and every chat between me and the various"consultants"...for the record. I have each and every emails send from my email adress to them...for the record. Once I was asked to confirm my email adress, date of birth and full name via the chat room, which I gave. Matter of interest...when I complete the registration form, I only registered on my account just as Connie and not all the long boere names I am carrying with me. Out of the blue this morning 21/7/2020, I received email stating my winning is denied since I have 2 accounts. For what reason will I have to accounts? After insisting to receive copies of these 2 registrations and dates and amounts transfering to each of these 2 accounts, I was only told that they now closed 1 account. Why, if, and if I had 2 accounts, did they not asked me which 1is the correct 1? Because there is no other account. And suddenly I was blocked on all the chat rooms..no emails from my side whent through to documents@thunderboltcasino.com or support@thunderboltcasino.com Yet, the very first documents I had to submit they received. Yet, when I go to the support chat room, there support email adress is there to use. I took this to a legal entity that will deal with this. I also informend Thunderbolt that I will go on facebook, twitter, instagram and all other media enteties to worn people to stay away as far as possible from this casino! What an eye opener!</p>
