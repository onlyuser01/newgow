    <h1>Tropicana Hotel And Casino Mazatzal Hotel Casino Lucky Casino Casino Estoril Grand Lake Casino Fanat</h1>

<p>US e-commerce and online sports giant Fanatics appointed industry veteran Andrew Kleiman as VP of retail operations for the company’s sports betting and gaming arm. Kleiman announced his new appointment via his LinkedIn profile and received warm goodbyes from his former colleagues at fantasy sports operator FanDuel.</p>
<p>Fanatics Prepares to Launch Its Sportsbook Project</p>
<p>In his new position at Fanatics, Kleiman will use his decades of experience to assist the company’s burgeoning entry into the sportsbook industry. The company has grown substantially since its early days as a basic e-commerce dealer and has become one of the leading licensed merchandise businesses. Fanatics has also branched out into the NFT and sports collectibles businesses and is currently preparing to launch its sportsbook.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Fanatics announced that they had filed a patent application for a new sportsbook app. The company also allegedly expressed interest in acquiring sports betting company Tipico and has applied for operating licenses with regulators across several US states. Despite plenty of speculation, the exact date of Fanatics’ entry into the sports betting market is yet unclear. However, recent key hires indicate a serious commitment to creating a viable and competitive product. In 2021, the company hired former FanDuel CEO Matt King to head its online sports betting and gaming division. With Andrew Kleiman, Fanatics is bringing another experienced professional on board.</p>
<p>Kleiman Is a Retail and Management Expert</p>
<p>Kleiman has a relatively short history with the gambling industry, owing to his three years at FanDuel, where he worked as senior director of operations and senior director of partner relations. However, his total experience with retail and management spans nearly three decades and encompasses multiple industries, making him a neat fit for Fanatics’ multi-faceted business endeavors.</p>
<p>Education-wise, Kleiman graduated from Emory University in 1995 with a bachelor’s degree in Psychology and Anthropology. He spent the next few years in the hospitality and food service industries. At one point, he worked as operations director for Compass Group, the world’s largest contract food service company. In September 2015, Kleiman signed up with Empire Office as VP of operations. The company is a leading US office furniture dealer and helped Kleiman expand his already significant experience, as he oversaw over 500 million dollars in sales a year and partnerships with over 300 manufacturers. May 2019 was Kleiman’s first official entry into the sports betting industry as he began work for FanDuel, followed by his recent hire at Fanatics.</p>
<p>The New VP Will Support Fanatics’ Sportsbook Ambitions</p>
<p>As VP of retail operations at Fanatics, Kleiman will be able to use his know-how to help the e-commerce and online sports giant enter a highly competitive market dominated by industry heavy hitters such as DraftKings, BetMGM, and Caesars.</p>
<p>Fanatics appears determined to staff its sports betting and gaming arm with industry veterans and certainly has the funds and reach to challenge the current market leaders. The company has already attracted two senior management figures from FanDuel, and their confidence in the project bodes well for its future success.</p>
