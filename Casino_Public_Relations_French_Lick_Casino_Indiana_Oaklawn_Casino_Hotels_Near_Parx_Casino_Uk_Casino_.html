    <h1>Casino Public Relations French Lick Casino Indiana Oaklawn Casino Hotels Near Parx Casino Uk Casino</h1>

<p>I just gave Comic Play Casino a second try, because I wanted to like it. There slot selection is very good, and the promotions seem very competitive.</p>
<p>I decided on the promo where I deposited $50 (although somehome I ended up needing a $60 deposit....That should have been a big clue) and received 150 spins on CashBandit3. I really wanted to focus on the validity of the promo spins and had a good familiarity with this slot.</p>
<p>In 150 spins at .25/spin, I won a whopping total of $9.18. Pretty miserable with paltry wins few and far between. But what I couldn't believe is in 150 spins I never matched the three bandits for free spins. This is a slot where the free spin ratio is relatively high. Delighted with my $9.18 windfall, I decided to see what they would do with trigger-happy Santastic. I barely had interest after the Bandit fiasco but set $1.25 bets with $69 to play with. It was as obvious a joke as the Bandit slots with 3 total triggers, and a total of 3 free spins which won less than $3.00. What a joke for this slot, as iprobably played it 15 times and Santastic almost overwhelms with triggers, and usually string you along for a Hell of a ride before breaking your heart.</p>
<p>I'm a psychologist and I play slots every as a stress related. I have set aside a "not insignificant amount" I spend every week. I'm mot delusional to expect to be retiring from hitting a SHINY jackpot. But I respect natural odds stacked against me, that's part of the allure. But it pisses me off when it isnt enough that a casino (a lot of times specific games) has big odds in their favor, yet handicaps a player in a shamelessly crippling way. It seems Comic Play Casino is the ultimate squeeze casino. I wouldn't try it agai for a 5000 of their worthless free spins. So far, my worse online slot experience.</p>
