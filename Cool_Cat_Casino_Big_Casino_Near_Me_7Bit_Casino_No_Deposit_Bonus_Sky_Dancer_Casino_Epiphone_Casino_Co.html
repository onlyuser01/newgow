<p>Award-winning online casino intelligence platform OPTX has signed a partnership with Viejas Casino &amp; Resort, a prominent land-based resort based in Southern California, which will now benefit from a streamlined software and solution to manage its day-to-day activities.</p>
<p>OPTX Becomes Latest Solution Provider for Viejas Casino &amp; Resort</p>
<p>Viejas Casino &amp; Resort will have access to a range of the company’s features, including Slots, Slots AI, Slot Dispatch, Player Development AP, Connect, and Player Development products that will help it significantly improve the property’s operations.</p>
<p>Property general manager Jim Wild has welcomed the opportunity to work with OPTX and has offered additional detail into why the company made a perfect partner for the casino. Wild said that the team at Viejas Casino was constantly on the lookout to improve the customer experience and offer players new and exciting ways to enjoy.</p>
<p>At the same time, the property is equally interested in boosting profitability and overall performance. There is a “well-defined operational value” that the OPTX’s products bring to the property, noted Erich Hans, Viejas CFO. Among those are operational efficiency, business agility, and a single system for multiple departments.</p>
<p>This will lead to better integration and consolidation of operations on the management level translating into an optimized day-to-day running of the property, Hans added, saying:</p>
<p>Being able to replace multiple operating systems with one integrated platform is exactly what we needed to make the intelligent and rapid decisions the fast-paced gaming industry requires. Erich Hans, Viejas CFO</p>
<p>The slot team will benefit greatly from the OPTX Dispatch solution, said Dennis Woods, VP of slot operations at the property.</p>
<p>Leveraging Data to Drive the Necessary Business Insights</p>
<p>Meanwhile, OPTX co-CEO Brooke Fiumara was similarly thrilled with the opportunity to work with one of the leaders in the casino industry in North America. It’s more than just the raw data, Fiumara said, arguing that OPTX’s products offered the functionality for operators to successfully leverage it.</p>
<p>“We are excited for the Viejas team to experience the OPTX advantage,” Fiumara concluded, commenting on the partner. OPTX is a powerful solution for land-based properties in the United States and beyond as it helps create actionable recommendations for casino operators and guides them to achieve better results while leveraging their own unique offerings.</p>
<p>What OPTX brings is the in-depth business insight that helps guide properties toward their desired results with “no actionable player missed,” OPTX adds.</p>
