    <h1>Do Disney Cruises Have Casinos Metaspins Casino Diamond Jo Casino Dubuque Planet Hollywood Resort Ca</h1>

<p>Just a week ago, the two top 2022 French Open favorites were Novak Djokovic and Carlos Alcaraz. However, neither of them has made it to the final. Alcaraz got knocked out of the tournament by Alexander Zverev, while Djokovic lost to Rafael Nadal in the quarterfinal.</p>
<p>As a result, Nadal is now the odds-on favorite to win the trophy in Paris. If he pulls it off, it’s going to be his 14th French Open title, as well as the 22nd time he’s won a Grand Slam title. That sure sounds like good enough motivation for the Spaniard to give his best.</p>
<p>Although the worst seems to be behind him, Nadal’s road to the trophy isn’t going to be easy. The next obstacle on that road comes in the form of Zverev, with whom he’ll meet on Friday, June 3.</p>

<p>Nadal Celebrating His 36th Birthday</p>
<p>Nadal takes on Zverev on his birthday. On Friday, June 3, the Spanish legend turns 36. In the tennis universe, that’s advanced age, but Rafa has no plans to back down. It’s no surprise he’s not thinking about retirement when his form has been brilliant in 2022.</p>
<p>What needs to worry him though is his fitness. This year, we saw him struggle with several injuries, most notably the rib injury he suffered at the Indian Wells which kept him sidelined for six weeks. Further, upon returning to the court, he also suffered a foot problem – apparently, that’s the reason why he lost in Round 2 of the Rome Open in the build-up to the French Open.</p>
<p>However, since arriving in Paris, he’s been nothing short of brilliant. Even though oddsmakers didn’t put too much faith in him, he proved them wrong in the quarterfinal. That’s where he destroyed Novak Djokovic in four sets, showing no signs of any physical issues.</p>
<p>Can Zverev Upset the Odds (Again)?</p>
<p>Although he’s sitting in a high position in the ATP Rankings, Zverev isn’t seen as someone who’s likely to win a Grand Slam tournament this year. In fact, online bookmakers expected him to exit the 2022 French Open in the quarterfinal.</p>
<p>The odds on Zverev were as long as -455 against Carlos Alcaraz, but the German player managed to beat him 3-1. The big question is can he do the same against another Spaniard?</p>
<p>Nadal vs Zverev Prediction</p>
<p>Rafa is just two matches away from winning his 22nd Grand Slam title. If he pulls it off, he’ll make a strong claim on the tennis GOAT status. Further winning this tournament would also mean moving up one spot in the ATP Rankings.</p>
<p>To win the 2022 French Open, he first needs to win against Zverev on Friday. He’s favored to do so, although it’s not going to be easy, considering that Nadal is probably feeling jaded after spending over four hours on the court in his previous two matches.</p>
<p>Picks: Rafael Nadal to win; over 36.5 games</p>
