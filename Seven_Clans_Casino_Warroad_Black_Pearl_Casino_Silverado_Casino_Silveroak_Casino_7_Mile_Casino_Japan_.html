<p>Japan’s government will request venues that host gambling operations to introduce facial recognition software to help businesses root out people who suffer from various forms of addiction.</p>
<p>Japan’s Gambling Renaissance: Fighting Addiction with Technology</p>
<p>Since late 2018, Japan has been stepping up its efforts to build a future for the gambling industry. The country’s efforts have been successful under the rule of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe who acknowledged the economic windfall of a legalizing casino industry.</p>
<p>As a result, the country will welcome a dedicated Integrated Resort (IR) project which will host a limited number of individual casino brands. The move is designed to open Japan towards a new source of revenue and compete with local hubs such as Macau and Jeju Islands.</p>
<p>The country’s hoping to attract regional customers from other Asian countries where gambling is under various restrictions, including places such as China. Amid the talk to build the Integrate Resort (IR), a new issue has been brought forth – introducing adequate gamblers protection practices.</p>
<p>Controlling Gambling Addiction with Facial Recognition in Japan</p>
<p>On Thursday last week, Japanese authorities asked gambling businesses to introduce facial recognition system that would allow them to better track restricted gamblers who experience addictive behavior and have been excluded from the industry.</p>
<p>This is just one of the measures that government and businesses will use to combat gambling addiction. At first, the measure will apply to racetracks and pachinko parlors, but that will later be expanded to cover gamers in the Integrated Resort (IR) to open after 2020.</p>
<p>Most forecasts put Japan’s future IR for 2024, which is still a long way off. No destination has been chosen to date, although Osaka has been one of the primed destinations for introducing the Integrated Resort (IR).</p>
<p>Osaka has been the most bullish region in Japan trying to claim the multi-billion project, although as many as 25 other prefectures are also hoping to land a deal, although none has really pushed as hard and as determinedly as Osaka.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Japan is continuing to roll out measures that are designed to specifically help people who are at risk of becoming gambling addicts. Consultation offices are planned across various regions where people can go freely and seek assistance, similar to NGO help lines in the West.</p>
<p>Japan is pushing both with legalizing the industry and creating the conditions that would allow people to play in complete safety.</p>
