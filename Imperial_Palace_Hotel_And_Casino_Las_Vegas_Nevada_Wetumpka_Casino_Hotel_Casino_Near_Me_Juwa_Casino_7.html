    <h1>Imperial Palace Hotel And Casino Las Vegas Nevada Wetumpka Casino Hotel Casino Near Me Juwa Casino 7</h1>

<p>Signed up to casino intense and filled all forms and particulars including email and phone verification. Once all good used my VISA card and put my particulars in making an initial first deposit of $70.00. Did no good, made another for same amount of $70.00 and never went very good a 2nd time... Not the issue, the issue arose when I spoke to live chat about sign up bonuses or something of the like and upon giving my user name was told the casino doesn't take players from my country (Australia)... I said well after time taken within up, being verified twice by emq and phone still not picked up then making two deposits totalling 150 dollars and then be told I cannot play! I feel I'm well with my right to ask for my money back and some compensation as negligence shown by casino for letting this happan and allowing me to make deposit and play for some time when I should not have been...</p>
<p>Funds refunded back to my card used which J should never had been allowed in first place I think fair!</p>
<p>Imagine had I won something extraordinary and one you ever only hear about some lucky person that's never themselves and told I couldn't play living in Australia! Talk about spying! Definitely a law suit for sure but 150 bucks I think I'll just ask and hope they wave funds and not know they ever existed like any other casino that deals with so many zeros that having one after the 1&amp;5 not big enough to waste time ticking over more by the minute than my request for a refund!</p>
