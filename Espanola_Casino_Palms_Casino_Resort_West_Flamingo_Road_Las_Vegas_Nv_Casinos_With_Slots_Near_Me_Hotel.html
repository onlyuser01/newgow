    <h1>Espanola Casino Palms Casino Resort West Flamingo Road Las Vegas Nv Casinos With Slots Near Me Hotel</h1>

<p>It’s time for the first Derby della Madonnina of the 2022-23 season of the Italian Serie A. Named after one of the symbols of the city of Milan – the statue of the Virgin Mary at the top of the Milan Cathedral – this is a local derby between AC Milan and Inter Milan.</p>
<p>Although both teams used San Siro a.k.a. Stadio Giuseppe Meazza as their home ground, AC Milan is named the home team in the Derby della Madonnina that will take place on Saturday, September 3. What this basically means is that AC Milan fans will get more tickets for this game than those supporting Inter Milan.</p>
<p>With the help of their fans, I Rossoneri definitely look capable of doing well this coming weekend. After all, they are undefeated at home since January. What needs to worry them, however, is that they don’t have a great record against their city rival, at least not in the 21st century.</p>

<p>Serie A Champions Love Playing Home</p>
<p>AC Milan is the reigning champion of the Italian Serie A. The red-and-blacks won the title in the 2021-22 season when they went 26-8-4 (W-D-L), collecting a total of 86 points (two more than Inter Milan). What’s interesting is that they won more points on the road than at home last season.</p>
<p>This season, it seems it’s going to be the other way around. So far, they are 2-2-0, with two wins at home and two draws away. At San Siro, they destroyed Udinese 4-2 in the first round and won 2-0 against Bologna in round 3.</p>
<p>On the road, they drew 1-1 with Atalanta in the second round and played a goalless draw with Sassuolo last Tuesday. It was a disappointing result for I Rossoneri who came to Sassuolo bearing the role of the favorite. They did have the ball in their possession, but their attacks just seemed too anemic. That’s something that needs to worry them ahead of the clash with Inter Milan, a team that’s famous for its scoring prowess.</p>
<p>Inter Milan Playing Elite Soccer at the Moment</p>
<p>I Nerazzurri are 3-0-1 in Serie A this season with their only loss happening against Lazio in Rome. It was a disappointing loss, especially knowing that they were the ones to dominate the game. They had more goal attempts than Lazio, as well as kept the ball in their possession for longer than the rivals. Still, it was Lazio whose players were more clinical.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, this doesn’t mean Inter Milan players aren’t good in the offense. On the contrary, they have some amazing players in the final third, including Lautaro Martinez, Edin Dzeko, and Romelu Lukaku (who’s still doubtful for Derby della Madonnina).</p>
<p>They look even stronger in the middle of the pitch, which is why we expect to see them have the ball in their possession for most of the time in the AC Milan game. That said, they probably aren’t going to allow their rivals create too many goal chances.</p>
<p>AC Milan vs Inter Milan Prediction</p>
<p>Inter Milan has a better roster than its city rival, which is something that’s likely to play a crucial part in Saturday’s Derby della Madonnina. The black-and-blues are going to dominate the game from the very start, probably putting away a goal or two, while also keeping their net intact.</p>
<p>Picks: Inter Milan to win; under 2.5 goals</p>
