<p>Hacksaw Gaming, a premium supplier of slots, scratch cards and instant win games to the online gaming industry, has penetrated the Colombian gaming market thanks to a new partnership agreement with Betplay.</p>
<p>The new agreement will see Hacksaw Gaming provide a selection of its best casino games to the operator. As a result, Betplay will secure access to some of the supplier’s most acclaimed hits. This notably includes the provider’s flagship title, Wanted Dead or a Wild, as well as a number of chart-toppers such as Chaos Crew and Stack’em.</p>
<p>Hacksaw Gaming said that its debut in the Colombian gaming market represents a major milestone for the fast-growing supplier. It follows Hacksaw’s recent launch in Lithuania and will further solidify the company’s international presence.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the company also expanded its presence in Italy through a content agreement with NetBet, expanding the company’s footprint in Europe.</p>
