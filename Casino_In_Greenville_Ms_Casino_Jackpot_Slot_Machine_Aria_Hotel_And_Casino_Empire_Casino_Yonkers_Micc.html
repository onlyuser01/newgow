<p>Verstappen’s car failed him last weekend, which is why he ended outside the podium for the first time this season. The Red Bull Racing driver, however, is expected to bounce right back to the top with a win at the 2023 Japanese GP. His car problems are over, while his desire to win is unquestionable. This explains why he’s a -350 favorite to win on September 24. Will he do it? Let’s find out!</p>
<p>2023 Japanese Grand Prix Odds</p>
<p>Moneyline Odds Max Verstappen -350 Sergio Perez +1100 Lando Norris +1400 Carlos Sainz +1800 Charles Leclerc +1800 Lewis Hamilton +1800 George Russell +2500 Oscar Piastri +2800 Fernando Alonso +5000</p>

<p>Max Verstappen Is Determined to Get Back to the Winning Track</p>
<p>Fifteen races have been run thus far in the 2023 Formula 1 season. Twelve of those were won by the reigning champ, Max Verstappen. In two of the three races that he failed to win, he finished second, right behind his Red Bull Racing teammate Sergio Perez. However, in the most recent race, both of them finished outside the podium.</p>
<p>Verstappen finished fifth, which is actually a pretty decent success as he had some big problems with his car during the qualification. In fact, he did poorly on Saturday, booking the No. 11 place on the grid. He also had some tire problems during the race, which is why it’s actually a great success that he managed to finish in the top 5.</p>
<p>Can Someone Upset the Odds Again?</p>
<p>Ferrari’s Carlos Sainz Jr. was the one who won the race last week, can he do it again? The Japanese GP odds suggest that he cannot. He’s in the shared fourth place on the list of favorites, with the F1 odds of +1800, the same as Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton. That said, Sergio Perez (+1100) and Lando Norris (+1400) seem more likely to challenge the No. 1 spot on the podium.</p>
<p>When it comes to Hamilton, the legendary British driver used to be discussed as one of the best F1 competitions in history. However, he’s been without a win in almost two years. Maybe it’s time for that to change? Probably not, although we could see him finish on the podium on Sunday, which would be his fifth time this season.</p>
<p>2023 Japanese Grand Prix Prediction</p>
<p>Max Verstappen will win the Japanese GP on September 24. He’s the best driver in F1, as well as someone who’s got the best car and the best team to support him. The blunder at Singapore last weekend was nothing but a glitch and the Dutchman will get back onto the winning track ASAP.</p>
<p>Pick: Max Verstappen to win</p>
