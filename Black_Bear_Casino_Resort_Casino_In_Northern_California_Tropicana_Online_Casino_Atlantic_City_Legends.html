<p>Catena Media’s search for its top job continues with trusted insiders stepping in to take the reins and preside over the company’s expansion push in 2021. Chairman Göran Blomberg has stepped in as an interim CEO as of Thursday.</p>
<p>Blomberg Steps in as Interim CEO to Guide Catena Forth</p>
<p>Catena Media has appointed Göran Blomberg as interim chief executive, taking the reins over from the incumbent Per Hellberg who no longer takes the position as of Thursday, the company said in a press release.</p>
<p>Blomberg is no chance pick either with the executive having served as part of Catena Media Board of Directors since May 2019, and having contributed continuously to the world’s leading affiliate company success.</p>
<p>Blomberg has 30 years of management experience and he has served as CFO and board member at ICA handlarnas Förbund, bringing a lot to a company whose culture he is familiar with already.</p>
<p>He stepped in as chairman of the board in May 2020 and has remained in the post ever since. While Blomberg pursues his duties as interim CEO, he will be replaced by Öystein Engebretsen, who will step in as Chairman.</p>
<p>Engebretsen is another Catena veteran. He joined the Board back in October 2018 and his experience encompasses numerous executive positions, including as member of the Board at INSR Insurance Group ASA and Scandi Standard AB.</p>
<p>Optimism Reigns in Catena Media’s Outlook</p>
<p>Engebretsen said that he was satisfied with Blomberg’s appointment which has been voted unanimously by the Board, adding:</p>
<p>“Göran Blomberg has solid experience and brings more than 30 years of managerial experience to the role in a public listed environment. This makes him a good fit with Catena Media for the transition period.” -Catena Media Board of Directors</p>
<p>Bloomberg himself was excited at the news, arguing that organic growth and potential strategic acquisition will dominate the coming months and years. Catena has driven steady forays in both the United States and Japan, and AskGamblers has been a pillar in the European gaming markets.</p>
<p>There is a lot to be done judging by Blomberg’s official statement, but it all seems to fall in line with Catena’s main strengths and further development of business opportunities. Catena will focus on strengthening its financial position as well as operational efficiency, and seek to leverage BI and AI for more scalable business operations, Bloomberg noted.</p>
<p>The Board of Director has taken a good while looking into potential CEOs. Yet, Catena is keen to bring a person onboard who can help the company go through what it describes as “an even more profitable growth phase.”</p>
<p>While the hunt is on, Catena has appointed trusted insiders to preside over operations in 2021 which will be pivotal for legalized gambling markets globally.</p>
