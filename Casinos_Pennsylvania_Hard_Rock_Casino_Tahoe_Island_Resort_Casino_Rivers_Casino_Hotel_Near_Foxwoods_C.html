<p>EveryMatrix has tapped Carlo Cooke as its new commercial director for the aggregation product. Cooke is stepping in the position as head of SlotMatrix, the company’s casino content aggregation platform which is distributing iGaming titles to all partners linked to the network.</p>
<p>EveryMatrix Seeks to Scale Innovation and Performance</p>
<p>As head of this unit, Cooke will seek to consolidate the aggregator’s standing in the industry, sign up new contracts, and continually grow the existing portfolio. He’s a valuable addition to the team as he brings experience from a range of past employments.</p>
<p>Cooke helped shape the product line in places such as Red Tiger and All41 Studios. He has honed an appetite for the B2B side of the business and has worked in numerous positions that allow him to now execute his duties as commercial director for SlotMatrix.</p>
<p>SlotMatrix CEO Mathias Larsson welcomed Cooke and said that he would be looking forward to seeing the aggregator grow and consolidate its presence in important markets:</p>
<p>“We are happy to bring Carlo Cooke on board in a management role for our newest division.” SlotMatrix CEO Mathias Larsson</p>
<p>Larsson explained that SlotMatrix has been a significant part of the B2B landscape and has been able to create a vibrant portfolio of third-party products that ultimately benefit involved in the ecosystem – from consumers to suppliers. Larsson thanked Cooke for joining and said:</p>
<p>“We plan to capitalize on its existing success, and Carlo will have a crucial role in further expanding our footprint and accelerating our commercial growth. Welcome on board!” SlotMatrix CEO Mathias Larsson</p>
<p>Executives Happy with the New Hire and Appointment</p>
<p>Cooke expressed his satisfaction to be a part of the EveryMatrix team. He said that joining a tier-one iGaming platform was something he had been looking forward to and would collaborate closely with colleagues in the company to bring further innovation for the brand.</p>
<p>“SlotMatrix is the largest casino aggregator in the world, and I’m positive that, together with its talented team, we will bring the product to new heights,” he said outlining a bright future for SlotMatrix.</p>
<p>Recently, EveryMatrix invested in Jelly Entertainment, an iGaming studio that will help the company strengthen its own expertise in developing signature games under its own banner. The company similarly reported strong Q4 results for the full financial 2021.</p>
