    <h1>Juegos De Casino Gratis Tragamonedas Las Vegas Nevada Casinos Casino In Mesquite Nevada Cepheus Star</h1>

<p>Kalamba Games has secured a milestone supplier license from the Malta Gaming Authority (MGA), one of the biggest global regulators in iGaming and sports gambling. As a result, Kalamba will be able to offer content to operators which recognize MGA as a valid licensing agreement.</p>
<p>MGA is presently a powerful gaming body that is recognized by many national bodies and regulators in Europe, although most countries require operators and suppliers to have a license from their own gambling bodies as well.</p>
<p>Creating Tailored Experiences for New Markets</p>
<p>Kalamba has a total of 50 titles to offer to players and has a dedicated promotional platform by the name of BullsEye. BullsEye exemplifies Kalamba’s dedication to delivering on an outstanding user experience, making it easy for operators to benefit from a range of experience-enhancing solutions, such as leaderboards, metagames, progressive and mystery jackpots, tournaments, and a predictive CRM platform to help with the management.</p>
<p>The supplier is licensed to operate in a number of markets already, including some of the strictest jurisdictions, including Spain, Sweden, Italy, the Netherlands, Croatia, and Portugal. Kalamba co-founder and CEO Steve Cutler commented on the move and the Bullseye platform saying:</p>
<p>“Being granted an MGA license is an important milestone for us as we continue our growth strategy and bring innovative new content and promotional tools to regulated markets.” Kalamba co-founder and CEO Steve Cutler</p>
<p>Licenses Open up Access to New Customers</p>
<p>Cutler is convinced that BullsEye provides partners with the tools they need to improve engagement and increase conversions. The platform also excels when it comes to adjusting to various jurisdictional demands, which are increasingly important as markets become more strictly regulated.</p>
<p>Previously, Kalamba Games secured a license in Greece, marketing yet another important market for the company. While Kalamba has mostly appeared in the news with its licensing agreements, the company has been expanding its product portfolio on the back of entering new markets and gaining access to new customers all the same.</p>
