    <h1>Igntion Casino Everygame Casino Classic Colusa Casino Hotel Jakes Casino Popular Online Casinos N1 C</h1>

<p>Hello dear casino guru team,</p>
<p>I have a problem with the n1casino.</p>
<p>My friend valued me on 28.11.2019 at this casino and has made on his account the first 2 deposits because he still owed me money.</p>
<p>I played and won with the time 10000 € I always wanted to withdraw on my own account but this was always denied. Furthermore, after the live chats said this I should deposit something from my account and it would work.</p>
<p>I did that and sent n1casino all the documents.</p>
<p>When I sent them a screenshot of the first transfer and wanted to pay out the whole amount (€ 9500) they confiscated my whole profit after a short time. (I would have violated the terms and conditions).</p>
<p>Is there somehow a possibility how I can still come to my profit?</p>
<p>Would be a pity for the money and ask for help.</p>
<p>Mfg Martin</p>
