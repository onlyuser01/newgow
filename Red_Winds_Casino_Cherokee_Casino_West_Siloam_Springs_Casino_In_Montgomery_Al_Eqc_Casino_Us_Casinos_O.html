<p>Evolution is deploying the latest of its customer-centric solutions, with the company’s Ruby Lounge now up and running. This dedicated studio production floor is tailored to the needs of ComeOn Group and the company’s numerous brands across the iGaming industry, including in some of the most heavily regulated markets, such as Sweden and Denmark.</p>
<p>Ruby Lounge Elevates ComeOn’s Live Experience</p>
<p>As a result, the Ruby Lounge will be available exclusively to ComeOn online casinos, including over 18 assets. ComeOn Group players will have access to Live Roulette and Live Blackjack tables served by dedicated live dealers.</p>
<p>ComeOn Group described the Ruby Lounge as a “brand within brands,” allowing it to position its live experience better and create memorable gaming sessions. Effectively, the company is pushing for more customized and authentic experiences that will help it set itself apart from other live dealer offers.</p>
<p>The two companies go back to 2013 when ComeOn and Evolution first signed an agreement. Commenting on this partnership, ComeOn Group CPO Cristiano Blanco said:</p>
<p>“The Ruby Lounge extends choice and entertainment, offering an exclusive, premium, vibrant and exciting live gaming experience. Once again, Evolution has proved what great partners they are. The Ruby Lounge has such a strong identity yet works with all our brands.” ComeOn Group CPO Cristiano Blanco</p>
<p>Evolution Continues to Deliver Unique Products</p>
<p>Evolution has been working closely with GameOn for years to ensure that each new release is justified and serves both companies’ long-term goals. Evolution commercial manager Erland Hellstrom explained:</p>
<p>“The end result is magnificent, and early statistics suggest ComeOn Group players absolutely love the whole look and feel of this premium environment with its world-class live casino games.”</p>
<p>Evolution has been active all over the world. In January, the company went live with Unibet in New Jersey, expanding its dedicated suite of live games in the Garden State. Around the same time, the company also added its Live Lightning Roulette. In November, ComeOn introduced several C-level changes to meet the growing demand for online gaming and the company’s desire to meet and exceed customer expectations.</p>
