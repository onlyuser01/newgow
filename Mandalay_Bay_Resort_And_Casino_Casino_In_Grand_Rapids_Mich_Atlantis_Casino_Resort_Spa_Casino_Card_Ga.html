<p>EEG Set to Become First Esports-Focused Sportsbook in US through New Jersey</p>
<p>New Jersey will soon welcome Esports Entertainment Group, which will run the Garden State’s first dedicated esports-focused sportsbook.</p>
<p>EEG Draws Closer to New Jersey Launch with DGE License Pending</p>
<p>Esports Entertainment Group (EEG) is making a strong push in New Jersey, seeking a license from the state Division of Gaming Enforcement. With the Garden State among the first to endorse esports betting, EEG has timed its entry bid well.</p>
<p>The pandemic hit sports heavily, suspending all competitions and leaving sportsbooks with no other option than to venture into exotic markets, competitive video gaming being one thereof. Today, EEG is in charge of both esports events as well as various gambling products.</p>
<p>EEG already has a presence in Malta, the United Kingdom, and New Jersey, working ahead of the hoped-for official license and launch. New Jersey did a lot of the heavy-lifting in 2020, allowing wagers to be placed on various esports contests, including Call of Duty and League of Legends.</p>
<p>Grant Johnson, CEO of EEG, said that the company is hoping to become the first fully esports-focused sportsbook in the United States, with New Jersey offering some of the most relaxed measures on competitive video gaming contests.</p>
<p>Esports Betting Interest Expected to Be High</p>
<p>Johnson is confident that there will be enough interest as well, as the United States has a sizable chunk over the esports segment. There are some 211 million esports players in North America alone with an estimated 2.6% year-over-year growth, Newzoo reports.</p>
<p>According to Interpret, a data analytics company EEG’s work cited, over 50% of all esports fans in the United States are willing to engage with esports betting, and will.</p>
<p>“We are ready to move quickly with our esports-focused wagering platform rollout once the DGE permits us to do so, which we expect in the second quarter this year.” -EEG CEO Grant Johnson</p>
<p>Johnson believes that New Jersey is a good entry-point for EEG as well, as the state is currently the most liberal when it comes to esports. It’s also the largest betting market in the United States, overtaking Nevada, a traditional bastion of all things wagering.</p>
<p>Stakeholders will be kept updated about the company’s progress, Johnson added. Meanwhile, EEG has already been working on establishing its footprint in the United States, teaming up with the Philadelphia Eagles in December 2020.</p>
<p>New Jersey played host to the VIE.gg CS: GO Legend Series Tournament in August last year, the first of many events to exemplify the link between esports wagering companies and traditional esports leagues and competitions.</p>
