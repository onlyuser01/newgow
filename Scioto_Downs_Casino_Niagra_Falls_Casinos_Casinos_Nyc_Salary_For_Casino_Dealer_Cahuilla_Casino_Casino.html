    <h1>Scioto Downs Casino Niagra Falls Casinos Casinos Nyc Salary For Casino Dealer Cahuilla Casino Casino</h1>

<p>I registered with a casino called CASINOIN around May.</p>
<p>I have made deposits seven times since then.</p>
<p>It was only after my seventh deposit that I could make a withdrawal, and when I applied for it, I was asked for KYC verification.</p>
<p>As this is also demanded at other casinos, I had been submitting what they asked for in the same way, but every time I submit something, they ask for new documentation and the verification process is not ending.</p>
<p>The following are the documents that have been asked for so far.</p>
<p>①Driver's License</p>
<p>②Residence Certificate</p>
<p>③Selfie with Driver's License</p>
<p>④Selfie with Driver's License and a screenshot of the live chat</p>
<p>⑤Selfie with Residence Certificate</p>
<p>⑥Payment history from JETON to CASINOIN</p>
<p>⑦Payment history from VEGA to CASINOIN</p>
<p>⑧JETON profile section</p>
<p>⑨VEGA profile section</p>
<p>⑩Complete transaction history from VEGA since May in PDF. (Including all non-CASINOIN transactions)</p>
<p>⑪Complete transaction history from JETON since August in PDF (Including all non-CASINOIN transactions)</p>
<p>Despite submitting all of the above, they are asking additional for:</p>
<p>・Selfie with an ID other than a driver's license</p>
<p>・Complete transaction history from JETON since August (with all transactions open)</p>
<p>However, because I do not possess a passport, I asked what other legitimate proof of identity I can provide besides my driver's license and passport? (Apparently, the residence certificate won't do.)</p>
<p>Yet I did not receive a proper response to this; instead, I was simply told to send a selfie with some other proof of identity.</p>
<p>In addition, they're asking for "the full transaction history from JETON since August" with all transactions open. Unlike the VEGA wallet, there is no way to convert transaction history on JETON to PDF, so I am currently in the process of sending screenshots one by one. It took me quite a bit of time to prepare ⑪, but now they are asking me to prepare and send the documents with all transactions open, leaving me puzzled.</p>
<p>(I've explained to the casino that JETON lacks a feature to convert to PDF.)</p>
<p>I have been exchanging daily and being asked for new documents, so I am in a situation where my work time is also being chipped away. I am troubled by these exchanges that have no end in sight.</p>
<p>I have never been asked for so many identity proofs at other casinos, so I thought it might be a malicious refusal to pay, and I am becoming neurotic being asked for new documents daily, so I came to consult here.</p>
<p>Is it normal to have to submit such a vast amount of documents to complete the first withdrawal?</p>
<p>Moreover, what should I do moving forward?</p>
