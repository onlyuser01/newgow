<p>Global sports betting data and content supplier Genius Sports Group (GSG) announced today it entered into a deal with one of the largest online betting and gaming platform providers in Italy, Microgame S.p.A.</p>
<p>Live Data and Trading Services</p>
<p>Under the terms of the deal, GSG will supply official in-play sports betting content to over 25 licensed sportsbook brands in Italy which currently utilize the Microgame platform solution, Intrabos, offering them the opportunity to leverage GSG’s renowned and customizable LiveData and LiveTrading services.</p>
<p>The partnership with GSG will ensure all current and future business partners of Microgame have access to GSG’s official sports data and pricing from some of the most exciting sports leagues in the world, such as the English Premier League and LigaMX, Euroleague basketball, FIBA and FIVB competitions, as well as NASCAR.</p>
<p>Jack Davison, chief commercial officer at GSG, noted that the company invested heavily in Italy in the recent years in terms of hiring personnel, product development and official rights acquisitions.</p>
<p>“Partnering with Microgame, another respected supplier in the region, is expected to further our local reach and will enable over 25 new sportsbooks to unlock additional in-play engagement and revenues.” Jack Davison, CCO, Genius Sports Group</p>
<p>GSG’s efforts to establish its product and services in Italy did not go unnoticed, as the betting data and content supplier was named Italy’s best Sports Betting Supplier at the 2020 EGR Italy Awards.</p>
<p>Improve Content and Reliability</p>
<p>For Microgame and its broad market customer base including brands such as Goldbet, Betflag and Betalang, the partnership with GSG represents an “important step” for the further development of its sportsbook, Marco Castaldo, chief executive officer at the company outlined.</p>
<p>“Adding the Genius data service will further improve top-quality event coverage for our customers, ensuring a better player experience and additional revenue opportunities.” Marco Castaldo, CEO, Microgame</p>
<p>The live data and trading services deal with Genius Sports is part of Microgame’s ongoing efforts to upgrade its sportsbook systems and boost content and reliability for its existing B2B clients.</p>
<p>Genius Sports was quite active on the partnership front, having entered into multiple data partnerships in February alone. At the beginning of the month, GSG signed an exclusive data deal with Superstar Racing Experience (SRX) to utilize official data of the racing series.</p>
<p>It then went on to renew an existing deal with Australia’s Hungry Jack’s National Basketball League (NBL) to cover the capturing of live team and player statistics and power the website and social media of the league.</p>
<p>Just recently, GSG partnered with WynnBet in a multi-state deal to allow the sports betting brand of Wynn Resorts to utilize Genius’ live sports data.</p>
