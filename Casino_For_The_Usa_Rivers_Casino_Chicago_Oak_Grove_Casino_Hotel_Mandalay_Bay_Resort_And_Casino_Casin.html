    <h1>Casino For The Usa Rivers Casino Chicago Oak Grove Casino Hotel Mandalay Bay Resort And Casino Casin</h1>

<p>Dear Petronela,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your quick reply. I did quickly realize Crypto Fair Play Casino's trustability was questionnable. However it was too late, I had already made my first deposit after stupidly an affiliation website (that was also promoting famous online casinos... which is why I tried that one casino I had never heard of, my mistake).</p>
<p>FYI, I did contact the casino and they finally sent me an email saying the following:</p>
<p>"This address is not associated with your account.</p>
<p>As you can see there is another deposit of another player on the 2021-01-24 10:37"</p>
<p>I replied that the address I sent the BTC to was the one initially associated to my casino account (I do have pictures of the address and my deposit as you saw), therefore that it was there mistake and that I ask for quick reimbursement. Since then, I received no reply whatsoever and strangely enough, the BTC address assigned to my account has changed.</p>
<p>I do own a Binance e-wallet, I will try to contact them and inform them about the issue. I am afraid however that they cannot do anything as the transaction clearly went through.</p>
<p>I believe only this "casino" whose reputation is very questionable can help, but they probably won't as it surely is a scam.</p>
<p>Any possible help from your side would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Aymeric</p>
