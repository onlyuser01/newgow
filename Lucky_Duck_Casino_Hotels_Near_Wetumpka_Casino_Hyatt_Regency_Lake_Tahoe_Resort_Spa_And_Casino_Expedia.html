<p>Low6, a company focusing on adding gamification to the sports viewership experience, and Sportsbet.io, a company that provides multi-currency sports betting opportunities, have teamed up to develop a three-phase commercial partnership.</p>
<p>Announced in an official press statement, the pair will seek to introduce a dedicated "Sportsbet.io Clubhouse" experience developed by Low6 for the upcoming FIFA Qatar World Cup 2022. This Clubhouse should help sports fans interact throughpersonalized content and opportunities, chat, and various gamification rewards.</p>
<p>Low6 will enjoy Sportsbet.io’s full trust in galvanizing community members to engage with the platform in a cost-efficient way that adds value to the business and creates fond experiences for fans. Low6 has extensive experience in building communities and adding value to sports betting engagement, which fits perfectly with Sportsbet.io’s broader ambition to bring fans closer to the action.</p>
<p>Low6 builds its proposition on the idea that sports fans would love to interact with other "like-minded sports fanatics." The Clubhouse experience for the upcoming football competition is only a start, as the companies note. Sportsbet.io and Low6 will seek to replicate the experience across numerous other sports they know are appreciated by their own consumers basis, including horse racing, MLB, NBA, NHL, NFL, Premier League, Ligue 1, and many more.</p>
<p>Low6 CEO Jamie Mitchell welcomed this opportunity. "It’s been a whirlwind few months as we onboard more and more operators who are looking for something more than a cookie-cutter approach to iGaming and gamification," the executive said.</p>
<p>Sportsbet.io already leads the way when it comes to building a great online sports betting experience. Now, the company will benefit from Low6’s own expertise in incentivizing Millennial and GenZ customers into playing. YOLO Group, the company behind the Sportsbet.io brand, was similarly pleased with the developments.</p>
<p>Director of Sportsbook Joe McCallum said that Sportsbet.io has been constantly striving to establish itself front and center in the sports universe. He argued that Low6 understands how to create a world-class customer experience and that Sportsbet.io is happy to work with the company on that journey.</p>
<p>"This is an exciting partnership with a forward-looking company that can help Sportsbet.io remain ahead of the competition," McCallum noted.</p>
