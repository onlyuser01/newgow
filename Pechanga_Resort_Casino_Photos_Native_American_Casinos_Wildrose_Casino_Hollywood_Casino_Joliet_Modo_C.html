<p>Best regards, this com too u at mystake today answer from mystake</p>
<p>came from guru casino to me. I want to cooperate with you but you refuse to tell me what I have done wrong? What suspicious matches have I played on? I have deposited a total of 3686 Euro and have 3288 Euro in my account now. I have lost 440 euros. How then have I been able to play on suspicious bets? If I had bet 1,000 euros and won 10,000 euros, then you can expect something, but as I said, I am down 400 euros. in addition, I have pictures of my account that is registered with you and other pictures of the games I bet on and a picture of my account with you where it says that I have 3288 euros. sometimes you get the feeling that you might not get your money paid out and then I have to have proof so I know what I'm talking about. i have bet on european football, nba, asian football, nhl and swedish bandy on ice and world cup football, i don't know messi, neymar or any players where you suspect me of suspicious gamesðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š even i'm minus 400 euros. first it was my card that was blocked due to fraud there you have my evidence with the police report and from the bank and it's strong evidence and now I'm suspicious of suspects what, now I don't understand anything but I'm starting to suspect some other things that I myself have been deceived by you, I have read about you and you have a rating of 7.6 out of 10 at casino guru and that is a good rating, that is why I chose you this time and that Swedishplayers are welcome all my deposits are approved with my bank id and my personal code . All of a sudden now I'm suspicious bets??? this means my money is lost have played on other curacoa betting sites and have never been treated this way, how could I influence big teams or players in Europe, USA etc??ðŸ˜Š this feels strange to me? what matches is it about??? I want to cooperate with you but it seems that you do not want to do this, if I have now made suspicious bets, then you must be able to prove this to me if you have a rating of 7.6 on mystake and welcome Swedish players. now now i am very worried because i have lost 3288 euros for nothing or i can say this i feel like i have been cheated and robbed of my money by you i can't affect any matches what i know like i said don't know messi or neymarðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š I know you have your rules in curacoa but you must be able to cooperate with me and talk about which suspicious matches or teams I have become suspicious bets for? because otherwise it is the case that I have been cheated by you of 3288 euros. as I said, I put in 3686 euros, so I'm minus 400 euros, it feels strange with suspicious bets, if I had bet 1000 euros and won 10000 euros, then you might get banned. I hope you will open my account so that I can continue to play deposit and withdraw money with you but you must also be able to cooperate with me as you did with casino guru and convince me, have opened accounts on other curacoa betting sites and there has never been a problem like this after kyc verification i know i have not made any suspicious bets i have bet for many years but never been robbed or cheated by any company and mystake with 7.6 out of 10 is very good rating. I thought it was about my blocked card, this was about that, so I got all the papers from the police and the bank, but all of a sudden I'm accused of suspicious bets??? now I don't understand anything. it's nice to know that I haven't done anything like that and glad for it but now I want you to cooperate with me and be honest only played 1 month with you. tell me exactly which matches or suspicious bets and teams that I am suspected of as I said I am 400 euros minus with you and someone who makes suspicious bets wins big money and does not lose 400 euros? I am waiting for an answer from you as you can answer casino guru so you can answer me with. otherwise I feel robbed and deceived by you at mystake. I hope you understand me. I want to cooperate with you and hope you want it too and I expect an answer. unfortunately cannot give away 3288 euros for something that I have not done, if I have made suspicious bets then I have done something wrong and something gross. hope you will answer me soon. because I will not give up. etc. Ã¶zkan....thanks for ure help so far radka</p>
