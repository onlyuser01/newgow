<p>Top urgent!explanation,refundation settlement.2nd attempt.to rcve.explanation!!!!</p>
<p>Good evening ,</p>
<p>Kind remainder on below:</p>
<p>First of all ,good afternoon I will try to be as much as polite as i can.</p>
<p>Acc id:11***376</p>
<p>Yestrday around 09 UTC +1 i have opted for bonus 500%and purchased amount of 220eur,pls check bank statement and ams banking as conf.(cards has 4d secure)</p>
<p>Secondly this card is linked /used with Google account which means I have made purchases with the same dozen times wo issues.</p>
<p>As you can see FM screenshots finds were instantly deducted FM the card and still after 31 hrs FM purchase funds are not credited to account.</p>
<p>Key point to consider:</p>
<p>-Requesting involvement of accounting n legal department of your house.</p>
<p>1.You are 'spinning'my money already 31 hrs.Immagine 100 clients like me per day?</p>
<p>2.Your promotion details are not clear,nor anywhere were stipulated that processing time take FM 1min to 24hr as advised FM your support .Already passed 31 hrs</p>
<p>3.insted depositing money to your house ,could deposited elsewhere.</p>
<p>4.In case you hv processed as common alredy deducted funds,with bonus acc would be disposable 990eur to play</p>
<p>5.insted my balance is 0.</p>
<p>6.I deposited money to play UCL quilifier game n intended to put all in .</p>
<p>To shorten 'quote'around 5.4</p>
<p>7.when i saw that you are not funded my account i played above match with local bookmaker,deposited funds with cc,available immediately .</p>
<p>Match was won!!!</p>
<p>8.in case you insist i ll provide you bank deposit to local bookmaker,champion leage game ,win,account details n all to prove that i ment to play above with 990 euros which should be available.</p>
<p>9.Never have experienced cc funds which were deducted are not credited to acc. With any other bookmark.</p>
<p>10.direct loss from not processment is cca 5.4k euros,</p>
<p>11.every bookie have rules ,but that there is rule also bookmakers hv to follow.</p>
<p>Considering all you are facing IBAS PROCESSING cuz of direct n indirect cost,</p>
<p>'spinning money's,withholding funds,lost revenue etc.</p>
<p>Not to mention bad publicity which i am quite sure you want to avoid</p>
<p>Suggest politely to adhere to above issue promptly n adequatelly .</p>
<p>Many tnx in advance</p>
