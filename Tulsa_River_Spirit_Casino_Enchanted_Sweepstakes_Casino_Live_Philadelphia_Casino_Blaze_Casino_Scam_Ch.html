    <h1>Tulsa River Spirit Casino Enchanted Sweepstakes Casino Live Philadelphia Casino Blaze Casino Scam Ch</h1>

<p>Hi, in my case I deposited €25, started playing and won a prize of €1,100.</p>
<p>When I went to withdraw my maximum amount, I put €500, after 2 days they rejected my refund and lowered it to €250.</p>
<p>I tried the refund again with €250 the next day I checked the refund and they had lowered it to €100 and on top of that €150 has disappeared. Right now I have €2,900 in total and they refuse to pay me. They have told me that I can only withdraw €100 and it turns out that I try to deposit more money so that they let me withdraw more money and they have tried to make 2 equal charges to pages of dubious reliability.</p>
<p>I think it's a scam and they don't pay anything, not even 10 times your deposit. Because they say they pay you 10 times your last deposit but if I deposit €250 they say I can't get more than €250</p>
