<p>Nate Diaz Era in the UFC Ends on September 10, 2022</p>
<p>It was summer 2007 when Nate Diaz inked a deal with the UFC. Since then, he fought a total of 26 UFC fights, winning 15 of them and losing 11 times. Diaz’s overall pro-MMA record is 20-13.</p>
<p>Nate is an absolute legend of the UFC, who’s fought against almost all the superstars competing in the welterweight and lightweight divisions. Among those are Connor McGregor, Anthony Pettis, Leon Edwards, and many others.</p>
<p>Apart from being famous for his fighting performances, Diaz is also famous for his life outside the octagon. He’s a vegan and an advocate for cannabis. Diaz is also outspoken about the fighter salaries and was often seen complaining about Dana White’s reluctance to give him a big payday.</p>
<p>Some MMA analysts believe that his beef with the UFC boss is the reason why Diaz got to fight one of the toughest opponents in his last fight in the promotion.</p>
<p>Is Khamzat Chimaev Really that Good?</p>
<p>The short answer is yes, Khamzat Chimaev really is an amazing fighter. He is 11-0 in his professional career with 10 finishes so far (6 by KO/TKO and 4 by submission).</p>
<p>Chimaev joined the UFC in the summer of 2020 and is 5-0 since winning the Performance of the Night bonus in four of those fights. In his most recent fight, he beat Gilbert Burns by unanimous decision. He was the better fighter in that bout but the Brazilian just kept on refusing to surrender.</p>
<p>That fight showed that Chimaev’s Achilles’ heel could be his stamina. The Chechen fighter wasted his energy performing some possibly unnecessary wrestling moves, which could’ve cost him the win. If he does the same on Saturday, Diaz might very well take advantage of it.</p>
<p>Chimaev vs. Diaz Prediction</p>
<p>Khamzat Chimaev is a more skilled fighter than Nate Diaz, but it’s the American veteran who’s got more experience. Diaz loves fighting big fights and winning this weekend would mean sticking it to Dana White.</p>
<p>That said, you can be sure that Diaz is not going to surrender; he’s going to fight until the very end. The question is whether the end means getting put to sleep by Chimaev? Oddsmakers sure think so, giving extremely short odds on Borz. Still, we feel that betting that an upset is going to happen is the right thing to do.</p>
<p>If you think that Diaz to win is too much of a longshot, a better alternative might be to focus on rounds. We should see the fight lasting for at least 15 minutes.</p>
<p>Pick: Nate Diaz to win; over 3 rounds.</p>
