    <h1>Sedona Az Casino Emerald Queen Casino Casino Brango 1000 Free Spins Casino Niagra Buffalo Bills Casi</h1>

<p>Dear Petar,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m very sorry to hear about your negative experience. I have checked general terms and conditions, and this is what I found https://freakyaces.com/en/terms_and_conditions/:</p>
<p>„Due to legal regulations Freaky Aces casino games are not available to players from the following territories: Belarus, Bulgaria, France, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Portugal, Singapore, Spain, The Kingdom of the Netherlands (Netherlands, Curacao, Aruba, Bonaire, Saba, Statia and St Martin), Turkey, Ukraine, United Kingdom, United States."</p>
<p>Could you please confirm that you haven’t used a VPN (Virtual Private Network) to alter your location, when opening the account. Your confirmation is essential for this case and I’m not asking this to get you in trouble, I’m just trying to understand how the casino handles its own rules.</p>
<p>I have checked the email from the casino, and it seems that you have been accused of opening duplicated account. To the best of your knowledge, is there a possibility that someone else from your family members or neighbors has opened an account from the same IP address or device as yours?</p>
<p>Looking forward to hearing from you.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
