    <h1>Silver Sevens Hotel Casino Hilton Aruba Caribbean Resort Casino Hoosier Park Racing Casino Casino By</h1>

<p>Hi Radka,</p>
<p>My case is quite complicated as it has been ongoing with SpiderVegas and that case got rejected as the License Holder dismissed it. Afterwards it turned out that they simply where not their licensor/holding ties with the casino at all.</p>
<p>As the owner of Billionvegas is the same owner as of SpiderVegas I sent my complaint over to them and of course they did not respond on it. So I reached out to the License Holder of them they claimed to be licensed with. During that process the casino removed DiamondMarketing N.V. from its T&amp;C like it was never written in it (instead of releasing an update) and in this process the casino also reached out to me offering me a bonus if I drop my case and said they are not linked to DiamondMarketing N.V.. But when I rejected their offer they slandered me and threatened me with a lawsuit if I did not drop the case. The biggest joke is that they never will sue me as they know that they will get exposed then.</p>
<p>Anyway as we passed a while the License Holder finished its investigation and confirmed my claim even though the casino was denying it about who is the owner of the casino and now I am in my country getting advise from a lawfirm on how to shut them down with all their involved parties and get my money back with a compensation claim.</p>
<p>And while the casino is still operating they are now using the same fraud(actually its called forgery) by setting the Antillephone logo on their website to trick players. You see thats worth a 0.0 as score in my opinion as players should never try to join them.</p>
<p>Of course I can provide you the mails in private to review them as this is something I can not share on the platform here.</p>
