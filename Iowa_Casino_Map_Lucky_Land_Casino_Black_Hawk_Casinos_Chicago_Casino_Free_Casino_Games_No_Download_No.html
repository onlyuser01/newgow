<p>Renewing their long-term collaboration designates BetVictor as the title sponsor for eight WST upcoming events throughout the 2023/24 season</p>
<p>The leading online gaming and entertainment operator, BetVictor, unveiled details Monday regarding a new sponsorship agreement. The company confirmed that it renewed its long-term collaboration with World Snooker Tour (WST). Under the new collaboration, BetVictor was designated as the title sponsor for a total of eight WST tournaments within the 2023/2024 season.</p>
<p>Similarly to previous collaborations between the duo, the culmination of the partnership will result in a significant bonus for the best snooker player. Participants in the upcoming tournaments will collect points within a leaderboard for the BetVictor Series Rankings. This will grant them a chance to secure a staggering £150,000 ($191,000) bonus prize following the last WST event planned for February.</p>
<p>Sam Boswell, BetVictor’s head of sponsorship, was excited about the latest collaboration with WST. He explained that the company is thrilled to continue its engagement with WST, becoming the title sponsor for eight events and announcing the popular bonus race that will award one player with a significant bonus. Finally, Boswell said: “We are looking forward to some great drama on the table over the next 12 months.“</p>
<p>“We are delighted to continue our long-standing sponsorship of Snooker with eight BetVictor titled tournaments and of course the BetVictor £150,000 bonus race, which has been incredibly popular with players since its creation in 2020.“ Sam Boswell, head of sponsorship at BetVictor</p>
<p>WST Is Excited to Continue to Collaborate with BetVictor</p>
<p>Steve Dawson, WST’s chairman, outlined that the Tour has collaborated with BetVictor for many years. He deemed the company as an outstanding partner and supporter of the sport, while at the same time said that the WST will be excited to continue to collaborate with the company for the 2023-24 season.</p>
<p>Dawson spoke about the growing audience snooker has around the globe. Finally, he said: “The 2023/24 season will be fascinating on the table and we are joining forces with BetVictor to enjoy every match.”</p>
<p>“We have worked with BetVictor for many years and they have been an outstanding partner for our sport, so we are thrilled to continue working with them on a wide range of tournaments during the 2023/24 season.“ Steve Dawson, chairman of the WST</p>
<p>Overall, the sport is estimated to have an audience of some 500 million people around the globe that continues to grow. Now, the new collaboration will help promote further the popularity of sport while delivering an exciting bonus opportunity for the participants in WST’s events.</p>
<p>As noted, the latest sponsorship builds further the positive momentum between the two companies. In the latest WST season, the winner within the BetVictor series managed to secure the hefty £150,000 ($191,000) bonus after a dramatic and intense race. The final event met Robert Milkins and Shuan Murphy. Beating Murphy 9-7, Milkins secured the bonus prize.</p>
