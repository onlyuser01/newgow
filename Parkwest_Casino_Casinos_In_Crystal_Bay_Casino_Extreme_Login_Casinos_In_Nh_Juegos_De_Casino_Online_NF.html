<p>NFL Inks a Deal with Four Approved Sportsbook Operators</p>
<p>The National Football League (NFL) announced on Monday that it inked agreements with FOX Bet, BetMGM, PointsBet, and WynnBET. Under the latest deals, the four operators became Approved Sportsbook Operators for the 2021 NFL season. Additionally, the four operators are now eligible to purchase NFL in-game commercial units as well as other select NFL media inventory.</p>
<p>It was back in January when the NFL announced the first-ever agreement with casino operator Caesars. Initially, the deal excluded wagering, however, the NFL expanded the agreement with Caesars in April and also added FanDuel and DraftKings to its list of approved operators.</p>
<p>Under those deals, FanDuel, DraftKings, and Caesars have exclusive right to leverage NFL signage within the sports betting category. Furthermore, the trio can leverage their Approved Sportsbook Operator status to secure premium NFL advertising during games and activate retail and online sports betting. The League explained only the seven sportsbook operators will be permitted to purchase the select NFL advertising and media inventory.</p>
<p>The Deals Will Boost Responsible Gambling Efforts</p>
<p>The NFL is committed to protecting the integrity of the game and its fans, which is why the operators agreed with the League to adhere to the NFL’s integrity policies. Additionally, the seven operators are going to collaborate with the League, sharing information and advocacy to support responsible gambling efforts. “All operators will also license Official League Data from the League’s Official Data provider – Genius Sports,” explained the NFL.</p>
<p>“We are pleased to announce this select group as Approved Sportsbook Operators.” Nana-Yaw Asamoah, VP of business development, NFL</p>
<p>NFL’s VP of business development, Nana-Yaw Asamoah said that the League is pleased to unveil this select group of Approved Sportsbook Operators. He outlined that together with the three Official Sports Betting Partners, the League will engage fans in innovative ways this season. Asamoah said that at the same time, the engagement will be responsible, while “the sports betting landscape continues to evolve.“</p>
<p>Only recently, the NFL revealed that it expects some $270 million in revenue for the year to be generated from deals with betting operators and casinos. NFL’s vice president, Christopher Halpin, who was recently interviewed by the Washington Post unveiled that that number may surpass $1 billion by end of the decade.</p>
