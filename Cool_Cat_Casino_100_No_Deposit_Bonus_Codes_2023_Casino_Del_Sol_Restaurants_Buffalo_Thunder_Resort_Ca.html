<p>Rocky Mountain Gaming hopes to capitalize on the influx of people and cater to the needs of players seeking loose slots and personal service</p>
<p>Rocky Mountain Gaming has signed definitive deals with Minter Holdings and G Investments, allowing it to acquire the operating assets of two major casino properties. The agreement, if approved by Colorado’s gambling regulator, would add Johnny Nolon’s Casino and Colorado Grande Casino to Rocky Mountain Gaming’s portfolio.</p>
<p>Johnny Nolon’s Casino is one of the original casinos in Cripple Creek. Acquiring it and the Colorado Grande Casino will allow Rocky Mountain Gaming to dominate the town’s legendary gaming district. The two properties the latter company set out to acquire have a total of 400 gaming devices and 7 hotel rooms. In addition, Colorado Grande Casino operates Maggie’s Restaurant on its premises.</p>
<p>For reference, both properties are managed by David Minter through Minter Holdings. Minter is the sole owner of Johnny Nolon and the majority owner of Colorado Grande’s operating assets.</p>
<p>Rocky Mountain Gaming is the brainchild of David D. Ross, Michael J. Gaughan III and Joseph J. Canfora and is a venture that allows them to explore gaming opportunities in the United States. The first two men have worked together for over three decades in senior management for a number of influential casino companies. Canfora, on the other hand, is a casino veteran with over four decades of experience in the gaming and hospitality industry.</p>
<p>Minter Is Optimistic about the Properties’ Future</p>
<p>Canfora commented on the new venture with Ross and Gaughan, saying that he was surprised when they first invited him to return to the Cripple Creek market. After he thought about it for a while, Canfora realized that Johnny Nolon’s and Colorado Grande present a unique opportunity to conserve the old Cripple Creek atmosphere local players love.</p>
<p>Ross also commented on the matter, saying that the local market has been growing fast thanks to companies like Golden Nugget. This has attracted new players to Cripple Creek, revitalizing the local industry. Ross concluded that his team hopes to capitalize on the influx of people and cater to the needs of players seeking loose slots and personal service.</p>
<p>David Minter also commented on the matter, saying that he is proud of Johnny Nolon’s Casino and Colorado Grande Casino’s progress over the past few years.</p>
<p>While other casinos were coming and going and changing owners, we were a constant in this town. I look forward to seeing what Rocky Mountain Gaming CC brings to these casinos I love so much.</p>
