<p>BETER has revealed a fresh partnership with Betlive, allowing the two companies to bolster their respective footprint in the Georgian iGaming market. BETER, which provides leading solutions for gaming and betting, has been ramping up its activities recently, across numerous markets.</p>
<p>The new partnership will focus on providing Betlive with sports and esports content for what the companies describe as “next-generation” players. The selection will include both traditional esports titles, such as competitive video games as Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, but also a number of simulated sports, referred to as eFootball, eBasketball, and more. The virtual sports addition to BETER’s portfolio was introduced only recently in October.</p>
<p>This collaboration further expands on Betlive’s offer by imbuing its platform with BETER streams, data, and odds. Betlive will further benefit from BETER’s streamlined delivery of products. BETER has a dedicated Client Console that will make managing all the data streams and additional management tools smooth for Betlive.</p>
<p>Mutual Appreciation Shared by Both Companies</p>
<p>Through BETER’s feeds, players have 24/7 access to betting events as they unfold in real-time. Commenting on this partnership, BETER CEO Gal Ehrlich said:</p>
<p>“We are very pleased to have delivered a solution that truly meets Betlive’s specific requirements. We vitally understand and satisfy our clients’ needs so that they, in turn, can deliver a trustworthy solution to their clients.” BETER CEO Gal Ehrlich</p>
<p>BETER recognizes this collaboration as a way forward for the company in the Georgian market and has described the alliance as mutually beneficial. Betlive sports product senior manager Tstone Mdivani welcomed the opportunity and said the entire company was excited to be working with BETER.</p>
<p>“We are convinced that BETER will provide our customers with a premium betting experience whilst helping us to increase our revenue thanks to a significant number of new betting opportunities that are available 24/7.” Betlive sports product senior manager Tstone Mdivani</p>
<p>BETER has similarly specialized in other experiences as well, including iGaming products such as live casino games.</p>
