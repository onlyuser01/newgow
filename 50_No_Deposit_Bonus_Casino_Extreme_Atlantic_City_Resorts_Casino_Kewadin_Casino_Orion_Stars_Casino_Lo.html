<p>Operating within different gambling markets requires licenses, especially on the Old Continent. With one of the strictest gambling-related laws, Norway’s market is closely monitored by local authorities. Back in 2019, the country’s Lottery Authority, Lottstift, urged Trannel International Limited, a company owned by one of the biggest gambling operators in the world, Kindred Group, to discontinue its offering for customers in the country.</p>
<p>Trannel, the company behind the brands Unibet, Mariacasino, Storspiller and Bingo, disagreed with that decision and filed an appeal which was consequently rejected by the Ministry of Culture and Equality, as well as the Lottery Board in January 2020 and March 2020 respectively. Then, in February 2022, Lottstift issued a notice of a compulsory fine against Trannel while in June the same year, the Oslo District Court confirmed the legality of the Authority’s decision to implement a suspension against Trannel.</p>
<p>After that, the Lottery Authority imposed a compulsory fine of NOK 1.2 million ($108,600) per day against Trannel. At the time, the gambling watchdog said that the fine would be valid until the operator discontinues “the illegal gambling offer in Norway.” Not unexpectedly, Trannel filed a complaint against the fine which was rejected by the Ministry of Culture and Equality, as well as the Lottery Board. Now, the Borgarting Court of Appeal also rejected Trannel’s appeal, siding with the Lottery Authority in the country and effectively putting an end to years-long legal battles.</p>
<p>Lottstift Urges the Company to Exit Norway</p>
<p>The Borgarting Court of Appeal’s decision was announced only recently, and it confirms that Lottstift was right to ask the company to withdraw from the gambling market in Norway. Anette Trettebergstuen, the country’s Culture and Equality Minister, explained that the latest court decision acknowledges that “the Norwegian exclusive rights model is in accordance with European Economic Area (EEA) law.” She also spoke about the result of the lawsuit, explaining that it comes as no surprise.</p>
<p>“The result is not exactly surprising, as this lawsuit joins the series of several other lawsuits in the gambling field where the state has been fully supported each time.“ Anette Trettebergstuen, Culture and Equality Minister in Norway</p>
<p>The Lotteries and Foundations Authority’s director, Atle Hamar, also commented on the topic. He explained that the latest court decision confirms that the Authority was correct to impose a suspension against Trannel. Given the court’s decision, Lottstift anticipates seeing the company “withdraw completely from the Norwegian market,” said Hamar in conclusion.</p>
