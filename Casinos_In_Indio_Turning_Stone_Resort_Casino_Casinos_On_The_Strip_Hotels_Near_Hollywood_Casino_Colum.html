    <h1>Casinos In Indio Turning Stone Resort Casino Casinos On The Strip Hotels Near Hollywood Casino Colum</h1>

<p>On 2/26/22 I emailed miamiclubcasino.im the following:</p>
<p>My Name Is Joseph Michael K<strong><em>-H</em></strong> I don’t have an account with you, but someone who has stolen my identity, my ID’s and used my credit cards / bank cards and has created an account(s) under my information, I would like to know who, how, and when did someone create accounts under this email j***7@yahoo.com without my acknowledgement, I just got home from Afghanistan from my deployment of 15 months, and I see my cell phone has been stolen, Wallet. Etc. My bank accounts have all been compromised. I see your company has been involved in this bank mess. Your company has allowed someone who has stolen my name, my ID's, my credit cards, and used them within this company and or game. I’m so far that I can calculate $488.00 at a loss just from miamiclubcasino.im. I'm also dealing with 6 other companies as well. Totaling at about $2,092.79. Investigators are investigating final details now, as well as my banks. What are my options? I was able to recover my phone thanks to an apple feature "Find my Device" and the perpetrator failed to delete your miamiclubcasino.im info. All my email passwords have been changed, which took the investigators 3 days working with yahoo to gain access to my compromised emails. Everything is a complete mess.</p>
<p>I have provided a incident report, final copy will be sent to me in 2-3 days. I would like to know how we go about getting my money back from all these unauthorized transactions?</p>
<p>Last 4 of CC’s have been compromised and used without my acknowledgement.</p>

<p>William casino risk management at Miami Club Casino Sent this email to me on March 3, 2022. It has been 17 business days since that email was sent to me. As mentioned in William‘s email the deposit of $488 has been refunded to your credit cards generally it takes 7 to 10 business days before the amount is reflected on your account I have attempted numerous times to contact them via chat all the state to me is that my refund has been processed I was informed about a week ago for me to contact them back on 25th of March if i yet haven’t received my refund so that they can look into the refund status a little more further. I attempted to contact them today via chat and they basically stated to me that there is no further information they could provide me they processed the refund and they closed or ended the chat. I need some mediation, and or some guidance in reference to what’s really going on here! when will I get my refund back from these unauthorized transactions? why is it taking so long to get the refund back to my account? Please help me resolve this because I’m not getting anywhere‘s every time I contact them asking for a status update.</p>
