<p>The provider of quality testing and assessment services for lottery, iGaming and land-based operators around the world, Gaming Laboratories International (GLI), announced its plans to strengthen its South African team via a newpromotion. The company unveiled it promoted Pierre Otto to the role of General Manager, South Africa. Although it was announced recently, the promotion is subject to regulatory approval, a statement released by GLI reveals.</p>
<p>Devon Dalbock, GLI's Chief Operating Officer, EMEA, shared his excitement about the recent announcement saying that the company is delighted to have Otto in charge of its team in South Africa. "His diverse range of experience is incredibly valuable, both to our clients and to our employees," added Dalbock. Finally, GLI's Chief Operating Officer, EMEA noted: "He is a proven leader with the knowledge, skill, and vision to help our clients successfully navigate the industry's exciting future across Africa."</p>
<p>Overall, Otto was a part of GLI for more than five years. Before joining the company, he held strategic roles with other gaming-related businesses such as Scientific Games. At the time, he held the role of Senior Sales Manager. Otto's professional tenure includes an Operations Director role for WMS Gaming Africa as well.</p>
<p>Additionally, he also held strategic roles with Sun International. While he was a part of the leading gaming and entertainment company, he most notably was in the role of Technical Manager at The Carousel Casino.</p>
<p>In 2017, he first joined GLI. Throughout his professional tenure with the company, he held different management-level roles such as Compliance and Quality Manager, as well as Engineering Manager. Before being promoted to General Manager, South Africa, Otto served as Senior Engineering Manager. His strategic senior-level roles and dedication enabled him to accumulate significant experience in the South African region. This, in turn, is expected to help him with his new role.</p>
<p>The recent promotion comes after only recently, GLI unveiled multiple senior-level appointments. Back in May, the company confirmed it selected Martin Britton for the role of Chairman, EMEA, while James Boje was selected for the role of Managing Director, EMEA. What's more, GLI named Mackenzie Haugh as Chief Delivery Officer, while Dalbock was appointed to his current role as Chief Operating Officer, EMEA.</p>
<p>Each of the appointed experts brings unique and extensive experience to GLI. Ultimately, the appointments seek to help the company grow further within strategic regions and expand its global footprint.</p>
