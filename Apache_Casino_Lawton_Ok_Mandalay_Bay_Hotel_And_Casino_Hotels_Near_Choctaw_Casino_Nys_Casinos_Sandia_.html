    <h1>Apache Casino Lawton Ok Mandalay Bay Hotel And Casino Hotels Near Choctaw Casino Nys Casinos Sandia</h1>

<p>On Saturday, July 15th, I entered a promo code and received 50 free spins of 2 rubles each. These earned me 168 rubles. I then went on to play in Sweet Bonanza Live, placing a bet of 160 rubles. I hit a multiplier of x44, bringing my balance up to a total of 7219.80 rubles. Out of curiosity, I decided to request a withdrawal, and a pop-up told me to call their phone line. After calling, I was asked to wait a few minutes for them to check my account. They confirmed a balance of 7219.80 rubles and informed me that to withdraw it, I would need to make a deposit equal to my balance and wager thrice the deposit amount, which totals 21,659.40 rubles. I questioned this and detailed my understanding: that I should make a deposit equal to my balance, wager it three times, then withdraw. They confirmed that was correct.</p>
<p>I called them again on Sunday, to confirm once more that I should deposit 7200 rubles and then wager it three times. Again, the answer was yes. So, I made the deposit, bringing my total balance to 14,379 rubles. I then began playing the slots, with my balance eventually reaching around 57k. When I called to ask if I had wagered three times the deposit, the operator told me I actually needed to wager three times my total balance, making a wager of 43k. This surprised me, as I had been misled by their operators twice. I was very dissatisfied with the casino staff's deception but still proceeded to gamble up to 23k.</p>
<p>The final balance came to 52,604 rubles. When I called the operator again, they stated that I had completed the wager and only needed to pass verification, which could take up to 72 hours. However, when the casino called me today, they informed me that I had violated rule 26.3. Apparently, I had mixed my real funds with the winnings from the free spins, leading to my winnings being forfeited. They only left my initial deposit of 7200 rubles and the 7200 rubles I won from the free spins. This, they claimed, was "meeting me halfway". I want my full winnings of 52,604 rubles to be given to me.</p>
