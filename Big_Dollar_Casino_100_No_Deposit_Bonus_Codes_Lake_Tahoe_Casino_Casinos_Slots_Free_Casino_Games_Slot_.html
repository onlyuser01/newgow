<p>House of Fun Slot Review</p>
<p>House of Fun slot by Betsoft Gaming is a five-reel and 30-payline slot game released by the studio back on December 29, 2011. Yet, the appeal of this slot has not subsided over the years, with players coming back for seconds. The RTP is admittedly a little dated with only 94.96% in theoretical return that players may expect, but this is not such a huge deal when you factor in the 44.52% hit rate and all the other cool features that make this game so much fun in the first place. Without further ado, let’s dive into the world of the House of Fun slot game with our review.</p>
<p>Theme, Storyline, and Graphics: Prepare to be Amazed</p>
<p>House of Fun is not so much about fun, as it’s about an eerie mansion decked out with all sorts of ominous-looking portraits and chandeliers that will send chills down your chill. A couple – Jane and Paul – and their dog seem to be on the threshold of this haunted place as they look at the reels and produce all sorts of unexpected outcomes.</p>
<p>The symbols include a gargoyle and a door handle shaped like a smiling demonic feline, along with a handful of pudgy characters who have treacherous looks. A teal-color-eyed cat is also one of the symbols, and there is also a mystery box. The slot itself is cast against the outside of the horror-story-inspired mansion, with its gothic fences and bare trees that loom over the grid, adding to the foreboding.</p>
<p>Yet, for all of its dour-looking design elements, House of Fun slot by Betsoft is designed to bring you great times, and fill the reels with winning combinations, never mind the sense of horror that seeps through the game all over!</p>
<p>House of Fun Game Symbols and Payouts</p>
<p>House of Fun slot has plenty of excellent symbols that you will definitely enjoy. The biggest payout comes from the pudgy-looking stout bloke with a sort of tomahawk haircut and waistcoats who grins back at you.</p>
<p>The gargoyle is also there and will pay 2.00 for every 5x, along with the ominous kitten who will also add 2.40 payout for every 5 symbols. A guy in a tom-hat who vaguely resembles a trickster magician of a sort will fetch you 4.80 per 5 symbols, and the portrait of what is supposedly a previous owner of the mansion hangs on the walls offering 1.20 payout for every 5 symbols. Of course, these numbers are calibrated for the minimum bet.</p>
<p>The magician would otherwise pay you 1,860 for every five symbols you get, and the pudgy guy along with what we may only assume is a sibling of his would both grant you 2,325 payday. There are excellent game features to speak of as well, but we will broach those in a little bit. Now, let’s take a look at the sounds and animations of the House of Fun slot game!</p>
<p>Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>Although House of Fun may have some mileage, the game still stands the test of time and offers polished graphics that appeal to modern audiences. Players will find a game that is carefully crafted and fully capable of bringing worthy gameplay to players today. From the eerie sounds in the backdrop to the fateful clicking of the reels, this is a slot that may feel a little scary at first, but it quickly becomes a fun experience, nevermind the name of the game, House of Fun, and the setting that are clearly in stark contrast.</p>
<p>House of Fun Gameplay</p>
<p>House of Fun will be a little less streamlined when it comes to its gameplay owing to the game’s age. We found the user interface to be a little less intuitive, using an additional menu to let you calibrate the bet size. This is not too bad as it opens up more space on the grid, but it is a bit of a dated approach as most modern slots prefer to let players use a “+” and “-“ to calibrate their bet sizes effortlessly. That said, House of Fun will let you bet anything between 1.50 and 465.</p>
<p>House of Fun Features: Free Spins, Mad Click Me, Bonus Round</p>
<p>Of course, House of Fun slot comes with its own brand of excellent features to make the experience fun and rewarding across the board. There are three distinct special sauce features that we would like to briefly discuss here.</p>
<p>Jackbox Free Spins: The Jackbox Symbols will come in handy on reels I, II, and III, offering you a chance to trigger free spins! There is a 3.00 instant award when you do, and the size may change based on the betting level. Plus, during the free spins, the center reels become wild, to help you craft winning combinations and leave a winner.</p>
<p>Mad Hatter : Remember the crafty-looking magician we spoke about? Well, his name is Mad Hatter, and he is part of the special features that House of Fun comes with! Players will trigger the Mad Click Me bonus feature which is activated with three adjacent mad Hatter Symbols. You will then be able to click on the special symbols until you have revealed the Collect Symbol, scooping up everything you have amassed in the round.</p>

Bonus Round: There is also a dedicated bonus round that really rounds off the variety of exciting features you may explore in House of Fun slot. The bonus level will ask you to pick a door which may lead Jane and Paul out of this scary place. But as you plot their escape, mind that some choices are better than others, resulting in bigger wins on the reels!</p>
<p>Final Thoughts: Horror Filled with Fun</p>
<p>House of Fun is clearly a title that is meant to be spooky from the start, contrasting its macabre design and setting with an optimistic and grotesque name. We think it works and that Betsoft Games have built an endearing experience that is still fun for those who are faint of heart and may be reluctant to plunge into the bowels of the cavernous mansion. Make no mistake, albeit there are a few scary characters you may encounter, the potential for big wins is there and waiting for you to fulfill it.</p>
