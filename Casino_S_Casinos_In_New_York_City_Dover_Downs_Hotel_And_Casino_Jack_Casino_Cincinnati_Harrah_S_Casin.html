<p>NSW Liquor and Gaming, the state’s gambling regulator, has issued fines of AU$60,000 plus costs to Betchoice, trading as Unibet. The enforcement action was taken after the regulator discovered that illegal gambling promotions have been offered to residents in the state and investigated the company.</p>
<p>A final ruling was reached on May 22, with the Sydney’s Downing Center Local Court convicting the entity of breaching the state’s gambling laws. According to NSW Liquor &amp; Gaming, the issue concerned specific promotions published under the Unibet brand that invited residents to take part in gambling activities and open an account.</p>
<p>The promotions promised something described by the regulator as "price push," which is essentially slightly improved odds for the recipients of this promotion – usually for a limited period of time. The issue, argues the regulator, is that such gambling ads are prohibited.</p>
<p>Companies may not use bonuses as a way to entice new customers or bring them over to discover a company’s products. This extends to any form of inducement to open a betting account, the regulator explains in its official statement.</p>
<p>Commenting on the case, NSW Liquor &amp; Gaming Executive Director Regulatory Operations &amp; Enforcement Jane Li said that to the regulator’s mind, Unibet had "clearly" offered such bonuses to potential customers, giving them a reason to open an account.</p>
<p>Li reminded operators of the obligations they had towards consumers and as part of the regulatory framework in the state, touching on the implications for consumer safety as well:</p>
<p>Betting operators have an obligation to ensure that all advertising complies with NSW laws on gambling advertising. Inducements are known to increase the risk of gambling harm, so any breaches are taken seriously.</p>
<p>Li did not hesitate to recall a previous case involving Betchoice when the company was fined AU$48,000 in 2021 when it breached betting laws.</p>
<p>As a result of the latest events, Betchoice is now ordered to pay two fines of AU$30,000 and also cover the regulator’s costs. NSW has been actively looking to protect consumers in its jurisdiction with the regulator recently ordering pubs and clubs to take down or mask outdoor signage that suggested gambling was available on their premises, all part of a broader gambling reform in the state.</p>
