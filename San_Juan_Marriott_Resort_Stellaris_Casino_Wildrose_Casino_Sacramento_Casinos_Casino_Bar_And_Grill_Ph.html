    <h1>San Juan Marriott Resort Stellaris Casino Wildrose Casino Sacramento Casinos Casino Bar And Grill Ph</h1>

<p>That's a nice try however, I reserve the right to change my mind. I have opened and closed both accounts several times over the years and the casino never stated: self exclusion any of those times nor did the casino owe me 800.00 dollars in Kudos rewards.</p>
<p>Nowhere can Self Exclusion be found.</p>
<p>Sat 11/23/2019 3:46 AM</p>
<p>Please close my account and under no circumstances are you to reopen it. Not if I ask, God above</p>
<p>asks, do not reopen...</p>
<p>I will close my Kudos account after i have lost the Monthly Kudos due and owing me.</p>
<p>You can figure up how much ill receive, credit now and ill lose in a few minutes then you can close it</p>
<p>too or i will wait until first day of next month.</p>
<p>Once it's closed same deal, never reopen..</p>
<p>The percentage of player win is set to the point a player cant win shit..No, the RNG, it works fine, it</p>
<p>generates losing combinations without fail.</p>
<p>I can't, No I won't continue handed over my money with little to no chance to win. Thats exactly how</p>
<p>it is...</p>
<p>Enjoy my money until its gone, you will never see another dime from me.. If I were you, I couldnt live</p>
<p>with myself..</p>
<p>You have engaged in a course of conduct knowing the house edge is greater than Land based</p>
<p>Casinos, and other online gaming.</p>

<p>Good afternoon,</p>
<p>As you are aware I have been a player in good standing for many years. I play both Inetbet and</p>
<p>Kudos Casino.</p>
<p>I have recently requested you close my Inetbet account and as soon as I receive my monthly Kudos, I</p>
<p>plan to close this account as well.</p>
<p>Now I will tell you why:</p>
<ol>
<li>RTG doesn't offer slots with preset Return to Player Percentages allowing you the Casino to</li>
</ol>
<p>decide between, ( Unless manipulated by the Casino ) 91-95 and /or 97.5% return to player</p>
<p>percentages, which Inetbet does not publish for any of the RTG slot games nor does Inetbet publish</p>
<p>the flip side "House Edge"</p>
<ol>
<li>Very Low "Hit Frequency", 3% if that..</li>
</ol>
<p>3, Long Term Predictability, " The Law of Large Numbers", my time in play, support my contention</p>
<p>the actual percentage of return to my play is far less than the lowest Return to Player Percentage of</p>
<p>91%..I understand the longer i sit and spin the more I will lose over time but I lose every time and</p>
<p>that is where we have a problem.</p>
<ol>
<li>Short Term Volatility- I have not one time Hit a Major Random Jackpot, or any type of large</li>
</ol>
<p>winnings for that matter.</p>
<ol>
<li>I have reported technical issues and years later I am still waiting for an answer. The games freeze</li>
</ol>
<p>in mid-play. Lost connections during play.. Only to be told, "There's Nothing Wrong Here", Wtf... did</p>
<p>you think I expect you to openly admit a system malfunction or system failure ??</p>
<ol>
<li>Inetbet doesn't hold a license to operate nor does Inetbet post RNG certifications.. Why ???</li>
</ol>
<p>You look at things from my point of view.. Either the Universal :Language Mathematics, Theory of</p>
<p>Short Term Volatility, Long Term Predictability, The Law of Large Numbers, The Gaming Developing</p>
<p>Company 91-95 or 97.5 % RTP, somehow does not apply to me or I am the UNLUCKIEST Mother</p>
<p>Fucker on Planet Earth ????</p>
<p>Or the final possibility. most probable The Unlicensed, Unregulated No RNG Certification Publishing</p>
<p>Inetbet has engaged in a course of conduct designed to beat me out of my money.. Which is more</p>
<p>likely true ???</p>
<p>My only recourse, other than Never Depositing another dime, taking our opinion and beliefs and</p>
<p>posting them all across the Web which I intend to do.. That's not a threat.. Its a Fact.. You have the</p>
<p>right to rebut my contentions.. If you have the time and resources to dedicate to locating and</p>
<p>offering your rebuttal..</p>
<p>Good Day</p>
<p>Oh yeah, go ahead and close Kudos.. Wtf do I care about free money I am only going to lose ??? I</p>
<p>don't..</p>
<p>WR</p>
<p>Followed by my email dated 11/27/2019 therein I state:</p>
<p>Wed 11/27/2019 10:34 PM</p>
<p>You owe me my monthly Kudos, on roughly 3000.00 dollars losses and after doing the</p>
<p>math i expect Ill want to collect the more than 500.00 dollars owed me.. So, I'll be</p>
<p>expecting to see them and access them come the 2nd of December which if I'm not</p>
<p>mistaken is the first business day of the next month.</p>
<p>I do have the right to change my mind.. They are due and owing..</p>
<p>Whit Ratliff</p>
<p>WR</p>
<p>Do you deny owing me the Kudos ?? Did I not deposit and lose approximately 3000.00 dollars for the month of November, 2019 ??</p>
<p>Did I not hold a Level 6 ??</p>
<p>Nowhere do I say "Self Exclude", Actions speak much louder than words and yours speak volumes..</p>
<p>Lets not forget the fact the casino continued to accept my money on deposit. It just dawned on me you also owe me Kudos for week ending 29th of November as well.</p>
<p>Sun 11/24/2019 1:52 AM</p>
