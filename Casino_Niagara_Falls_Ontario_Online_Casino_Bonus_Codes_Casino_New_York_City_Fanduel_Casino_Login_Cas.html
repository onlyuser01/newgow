    <h1>Casino Niagara Falls Ontario Online Casino Bonus Codes Casino New York City Fanduel Casino Login Cas</h1>

<p>Dear Sir / Madam,</p>
<p>I am writing to you to raise an issue about: Casino</p>
<p>The issue that I have experienced was: The Casino unfairly closed my account when I requested to make a Withdrawal of winnings, with the excuse of linking my account o another account in another casino, Coral Casino and linking my account to a GAMSTOP Account. They decided then close the account and block all the winnings and only refunding deposit.</p>
<p>It is evident that if I have never won I could have spent thousands and Gala Casino would have never made any checks in the account. The account has at least 6 months and until I requested a withdrawal it was ok to keep feeding them with money. It shows how committed this company is with filling their pockets with money and only doing checks to accounts when convenient, even that the UK law is clear that for any deposit checks must be done to an account to verify a user. Not in this casino. I had my account closed in other big-name casinos and they all paid my winnings, as fair as taking money is paying when a gambler wins.</p>
<p>According to the UK Government Guidance and Advice for online gambling operators about using fair terms and practices states that casinos will be breaking the Consumer Rights if they "Deny customers access to their own money or place maximum limits on the amounts they can withdraw -including their deposits and winnings earned from their deposits"</p>
<p>They voided £734,70 from my account. The account had been previously verified and I was allowed to deposit and play since March 2020. Meaning they were allowing me to deposit and were taking my money until and if I ever would win. I would like to get my winnings It is only fair. How is the law or Gamstop helping or protecting anyone if they allow casinos to take the money and only verify users when it is convenient to them?</p>
<p>The consumer laws and Gamstop should be there to protect the gambler and not to be one more tool for Casinos to rip off costumers.</p>
<p>It occurred on: 16/09/2020</p>
<p>This meant that They have Kept £734,70 from my winnings.</p>
<p>And this not only affects me but the thousands they allow to make deposits and might never find out that if they try to withdraw their money they will get blocked and their winnings confiscated.</p>
<p>The consumer laws and Gamstop should be there to protect the gambler and not to be one more tool for Casinos to rip off costumers.</p>
<p>On the 21/09/1980 I contacted the Costumer Service to verify the status of my funds deposit to the account of £60,00 that is what they are willing to pay me, to request that since they are keeping my winnings I would like a full refund of my other Gala Group accounts, that because I have had bigger spendings they don't seem to have connected to my GAMSTOP registration conveniently and requested the total refund of £930,00 that I have spent gambling on the group while registered at GAMSTOP and have had no reply. Since they are not willing to be fair on paying my winnings I am demanding the refund of my funds since it is not fair that they would keep taking money from me until having to pay winnings. The accounts have the same details registered and it is not fair that they keep abusing me like this.</p>
