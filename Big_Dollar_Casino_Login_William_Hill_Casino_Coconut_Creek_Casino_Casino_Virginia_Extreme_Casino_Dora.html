<p>The sponsorship agreement will see DoradoBet’s logo appear on the front of FedeFut players’ official jerseys</p>
<p>DoradoBet, a leading Latin American sportsbook and online casino gaming operator, has signed a sponsorship agreement with the Federación Nacional de Fútbol (FedeFut), Guatemala’s national soccer federation. As a result, the gambling company will commit to supporting the sports federation and its national teams.</p>
<p>Under the agreement, DoradoBet will sponsor all national teams. This, according to José Osorio, DoradoBet’s general manager, includes the women’s soccer teams which have been growing at a very rapid pace.</p>
<p>As agreed by DoradoBet and the FedeFut, the gambling company’s logo will appear on the national teams’ players’ jerseys, spreading awareness of the brand.</p>
<p>The agreement with the betting operator was announced at a recent press conference. FedeFut players and staff attended the event where the sponsorship was officialized. Representatives of the federation welcomed DoradoBet as a sponsor, saying that they are glad to be working with the company.</p>
<p>FedeFut Is Happy to Have DoradoBet on Board</p>
<p>Max Solorzano, FedeFut’s assistant general administrative secretary, shared that his team is delighted by the opportunity to work with national and international companies that truly care for Guatemala soccer.</p>
<p>Solorzano expressed his desire to work with such companies to continue building the future of Guatemalan soccer teams. He concluded that the FedeFut is committed to supporting teams across young and old categories.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, José Osorio, the general manager of DoradoBet Guatemala, said that he just as is excited about this partnership. Osorio noted that DoradoBet already has an extensive presence in Latin American sports and is glad to join the FedeFut as a sponsor.</p>
<p>Osorio said that being able to sponsor the federation fills his team with hope as it will help them contribute to the national sport.</p>
<p>Other LATAM Gaming News</p>
<p>In other LATAM-oriented news, several operators just banded together to form the Brazilian Institute of Responsible Gaming. The operators in question are bet365, Flutter, Betsson and Betway, who will work together with all sectors of society to promote safe and responsible gambling.</p>
<p>This follows another major development for Brazil, which saw the formation of the Brazilian Association for the Defense of Sport Integrity, the country’s first sports integrity body. The ABRADIE, as it is known, already has the backing of several high-profile sports betting operators.</p>
<p>In terms of agreements, Novibet recently penned a Brazil-facing deal with Fortaleza. Earlier this month, XSA Sports secured a content boost from Pragmatic Play. At around the same time, NuxGame solidified its LATAM presence through an agreement with Monnet.</p>
