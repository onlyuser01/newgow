<p>Zombie FC Slot Review</p>
<p>Zombies and soccer probably don’t go well together – that is until you get yourself a shot at Woohoo’s thematic take on the zombie apocalypse which features, well, zombies who are playing the beautiful game. Does it work? Well, there is only one way to find out, and Zombie FC slot sets out to do just that.</p>
<p>The 5×3 slot offers a massive variety of built-in features leading to a 96.48% RTP. You get to enjoy a low-volatility and thematic slot that will help you have fun. With a handful of multipliers and plenty of free spins to come along your way, you have many ways of approaching this game and having a blast.</p>
<p>Theme, Storyline, and Graphics: Torn Limbs and Spilling Brains</p>
<p>Theme is not something that Zombie FC slot takes lightly. The slot comes with a touch of gritty realism as the mix of professional soccer and the undead is taking on a new form by Woohoo choosing to follow in the footsteps of soccer fandom. In other words, you will see zombies cheering and celebrating their successes, referees taking out a blood-soaked yellow and red card, and cheerleaders chomping down on soft bits of humans.</p>
<p>The symbols in the game are also thematic, with player shirts and soccer balls. When you win, you will get the sum displayed on your screen with a splash of blood going across the screen as well to add to the immersion. Zombie FC will be playing in the stadium, but you will also get to visit the Locker Room while enjoying the free bonus spins.</p>
<p>Zombie FC is layering the theme with various visuals that are coming at the right time to introduce you to a worthwhile and fun experience across the board. With the graphics clearly a blast, let’s take a look at some of the symbols and overall payouts and what to expect there!</p>
<p>Zombie FC Slot: Game Symbols and Payouts</p>
<p>So, what of the actual game symbols and payouts you wonder? Well, there are several options here, and they are all thematically fit as well as functionally sound. For starters, you have 243 ways to win, which is good, and frankly one of our favorite payline counts. This makes it easy to track the wins triggered when you have two symbols adjacent to one another.</p>
<p>The payouts also work from left to right and you have low and high-paying symbols. The low ones are the soccer shirts themselves, and the zombie player, fan and manager avatars tend to pay a little more. The captain will pay you $30 for five of those symbols, which is actually neat. Another way to look at it is that the Zombie FC captain will be paying you 12x of your total bet which is a decent rate.</p>
<p>Then, you have the Scatter Symbol, which is of course shaped like a Trophy. This one will fetch you a $625 payday for five symbols, which is pretty neat. You also trigger the free spins feature with the scatters for an added level of fun. Not only that, but Zombie FC incorporates a Tumbling Reels Feature.</p>
<p>What this means is that every time a winning combination is formed, you will get to have another crack as the symbols will disappear and be replaced by others, possibly winning symbols as well. Plus, players will also benefit from the Expanding Wild Symbol which is a referee zombie looking sternly at the players.</p>
<p>As to the free spins, you can get a total of 25 of these, which is definitely worth it, and not only that, but each consecutive win you get will also add to a multiplier for a maximum of 10x. This is pretty decent! It may be the zombie apocalypse, but at least it’s lucrative.</p>
<p>All joking aside, Zombie FC’s game symbols and payouts are excellent, entertaining and add value to the core gameplay. Although the RTP may not necessarily be the highest in the industry, there is plenty to keep you engaged!</p>
<p>Zombie FC Slot Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>We have already touched on this, but Zombie FC is a really well-designed slot game. Woohoo has evidently spared no effort in building a theme that feels and plays rewardingly across the board. The animations are apt and frankly – gripping. There are many little details that are created with not much fanfare, but that fit right in with the overall look and feel of the game making it so rewarding to begin with.</p>
<p>Zombie FC Slot Gameplay</p>
<p>Zombie FC offers quick, familiar, and intuitive gameplay. The game will be very familiar to any traditional slot out there, making it very easy for you to find your bearings. You can bet anything from $0.5 to $100 and take advantage of the auto and quick play features designed to further adjust the pace of play. It’s easy to adjust the bet size as well making it smooth sailing from start to finish.</p>
<p>Zombie FC Slot Features</p>
<p>To quickly recap the features, players can expect to find plenty of actionable and worthwhile additions to the core gameplay. There are the Tumble Reels we mentioned, which are inspired by the Cascading Reel feature and will essentially offer you a second chance to win even more by simply placing a bet, winning it, and having the reels spin again for free.</p>
<p>The Free Spins level is particularly cool, as you will not only get a chance for up to 25 free spins, but also benefit from stacking multipliers. And, if this wasn’t enough, then you will be very happy to hear that the slot actually features an Expanding Wild, which boosts the chance of producing a successful outcome.</p>
<p>Final Thoughts</p>
<p>If there is one thing that Wohoo Games shows us, it’s that the apocalypse will be turned into entertainment. Zombie FC slot is a well-designed and cleverly thought-out slot that does feel and play like a rewarding and neat game from the very start. The graphics in this game are not just a veneer – they are a carefully developed feature that complements an already action-packed gameplay to provide you with one of the best zombie slots experience ever!</p>
