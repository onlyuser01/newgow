    <h1>Hard Rock Biloxi Casino Waterloo Casino Live Casino Hotel The Lodge At Turning Stone Resort Casino L</h1>

<p>Good afternoon, I contacted support again and they asked me to try to verify and again it gave an error.</p>
<p>Couldn't I send the information via email and have you check the KYC manually? Because the system won't let me complete even the first step of KYC</p>
<p>The casino responds to emails, but he didn't understand that I can't get past PART 1 OF KYC.</p>
<p>They sent me this email yesterday:</p>
<p>We hope this email finds you well. We are writing to resolve the issue with the KYC (Know Your Customer) documentation submitted.</p>
<p>Our team has carefully reviewed the documents you provided during the KYC verification process. Unfortunately, we noticed some discrepancies or inaccuracies that prevented us from successfully completing the verification.</p>
<p>To proceed with the KYC verification and ensure the accuracy of your account information, we request that you resubmit the necessary documents following the guidelines below:</p>
<p>Proof of Identity: Provide a clear and legible copy of a government-issued identification document. This could be a passport, driver's license or national identity card. Make sure all details including your full name, date of birth and photo are clearly visible.</p>
<p>Proof of address: Submit a recent utility bill, bank statement, or official document that shows your name and home address. The document must be dated within the last three months.</p>
<p>Photo Verification: Along with the other documents, we require a selfie of you holding the same government-issued ID used in step 2 and a handwritten note (write your username, current date, and BC.GAME). Make sure your face and identifying details are clearly visible.</p>
<p>Please take extra care to provide accurate and up-to-date information during the resubmission process. This will speed up the verification and allow us to complete the process efficiently.</p>
<p>Once you have collected the correct documents, you can submit them through the website's verification tab.</p>
<p>We understand that accurate KYC verification is essential for account security and compliance with regulatory standards. Rest assured that all information you provide will be treated securely and confidentially in accordance with our privacy policy.</p>
<p>If you encounter any difficulties or have any questions about the resubmission process, please do not hesitate to contact us.</p>
<p>Thanks for your cooperation and understanding. We hope to complete your KYC verification immediately to ensure a safe and seamless gaming experience on our platform</p>

<p>Compliments,</p>
<p>BC.GAME Team</p>
<p>But, I can't go through part 1 of KYC, the way to solve this problem in my opinion would be for me to send the documents manually, I send the ID, they approve, so I go to do my self, they refuse, they say my age does not meet the requirements</p>
