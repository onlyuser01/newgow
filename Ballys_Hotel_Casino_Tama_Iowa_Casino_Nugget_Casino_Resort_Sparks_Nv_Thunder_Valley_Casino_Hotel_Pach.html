<p>The agreement will help Blueprint Gaming expand its presence in the United Kingdom, Spain and other high-priority markets</p>
<p>Blueprint Gaming, a leading British gaming studio, has agreed to supply DAZN’s gambling division, DAZN Bet, with content. The new partnership will see the latter company onboard some of Blueprint Gaming’s best slot games.</p>
