    <h1>Foxwoods Casino Restaurants Best Rated Online Casino South Point Hotel And Casino Las Vegas Fort Lau</h1>

<p>Thank you Enzo Casino representatives for the explanation.</p>
<p>As I explained before we dislike two rules which causes a lot of problems and anger a lot of players:</p>
<p>"Irregular play" includes, inter alia:Placing total bets equal to or greater than 30% of the value of the deposit currently in play. Using Martingale, double-up and similar systems and strategies. If a player's accumulated deposit amount does not exceed €200, player will be entitled only up to X10 last deposit. This maximum payout will be enforced also in cases where the player made additional deposits which were deemed at the sole discretion of the Casino to have been made in order to exceed the €200 accumulated deposit amount.</p>
<p>But these rules are predatory only in combination with real money play.</p>
<p>Because Barbara breached these rules with bonus play we are on the casino side here. (The casino is still punished that they have these predatory conditions in their terms but that does not concern this case)</p>
<p>We appreciate that despite the fact that Barbara breached T&amp;C's the casino allowed her to withdraw part of the winnings.</p>
<p>After this point, something happened, if Barbara already knew what she should not to do, why then again cancelled the withdrawal and made the same mistake again?</p>
<p>Encouraging a player to deposit to raise a VIP level, well, you can do that, but with a combination of rule:</p>
<p>Placing total bets equal to or greater than 30% of the value of the deposit currently in play.</p>
<p>It might be very unethical in case your support didn't explain the risks.</p>
<p>Suggestion for the casino:</p>
<p>If a player's accumulated deposit amount does not exceed €200, player will be entitled only up to X10 last deposit. This maximum payout will be enforced also in cases where the player made additional deposits which were deemed at the sole discretion of the Casino to have been made in order to exceed the €200 accumulated deposit amount.</p>
<p>This rule can be easily substituted by putting x10 max win rule to all your bonuses.</p>
<p>"Irregular play" includes, inter alia:Placing total bets equal to or greater than 30% of the value of the deposit currently in play.Using Martingale, double-up and similar systems and strategies.</p>
<p>It is much better to substitute this rule with some fixed value for bonus play like €5 and for real play don't use such a predatory rule.</p>
<p>Martingale or different strategies doesn't work so you don't need to limit them (€5 max bet is fixing the double up issue)</p>
<p>I know that probably this is not in your power but at least think about it.</p>
<p>Barbara: Do you still have some of the chats where the casino support encourage you to deposit?</p>
<p>Enzo Casino: Do you still have chat where your support guy explained to Barbara what did she wrong and how she should play?</p>
<p>Please send me everything relevant what you have to: matej@casino.guru</p>
<p>On Monday we have a meeting where we discuss about complicated or uncertain cases. I want to take this case there.</p>
