<p>The Las Vegas Metro Police Department has identified Anthony Wrobel, 42, as the shooting suspect. Law enforcement says he is 5’9″, approximately 200 pounds, and remains at large.</p>
<p>“Wrobel is considered ARMED and DANGEROUS,” Metro Police tweeted Sunday night. According to authorities, Wrobel showed up to the company picnic at Sunset Park around 6 pm local time. He approached a table where several executives were sitting and proceeded to open fire.</p>
<p>Witnesses said they heard several gunshots. One woman was killed, and a man was transported to Sunrise Hospital and Medical Center, where he remains in critical condition.</p>
<p>Police said Wrobel’s car was found at nearby McCarran International Airport, but he has not been located. Metro didn’t say if they believe the suspect has taken a flight or not.</p>
<p>Anyone with information is asked to contact Metro Police at 702-828-3521 or homicide@lvmpd.com.</p>
<p>Sin City Shootings</p>
<p>Las Vegas has been marred by shootings as of late, the worst, of course, being the October 1 massacre that killed 58 people.</p>
<p>2017 was the deadliest year on record for Las Vegas murders, with 264 shooting deaths. Even without the mass shooting, 206 homicides still would have set a new murder record.</p>
<p>Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo said the murder rate increase is due to the city’s growing population. The Las Vegas metropolitan area — which includes unincorporated areas of Clark County — has an estimated population of more than 2.2 million, with about 633,000 living within the city’s specific boundaries. A recent spate of MS-13 gang murders has put an already uneasy city on high alert.</p>
<p>Workplace Violence</p>
<p>Metro Police said Sunday’s shooting was not random, but a deliberate and targeted attack. The homicide victim is reportedly a female in her 50s, and an executive at The Venetian.</p>
<p>Wrobel was reportedly a casino dealer at the Strip resort. Per Heavy.com, he also filed for bankruptcy in 2010, declaring more than $300,000 in debts while earning roughly $2,900 a month.</p>
<p>Police said the victims were seated at a park picnic table when Wrobel approached and shot them. “Those employees were having a picnic when the suspect arrived on scene,” the Las Vegas Metro Police Department said in a statement.</p>
<p>The agency added, “This is an isolated incident. This is an act of workplace violence. The individuals at the table were the targets of the shooter.”</p>
<p>Property records show that Wrobel has been a Las Vegas resident since at least 2003.</p>
