<p>Betfred USA Sports has announced a partnership renewal with US Integrity for ongoing brand growth across regulated markets</p>
<p>The wholly-owned American subsidiary of Betfred Group which operates more than 1400 betting shops and online and mobile products across the UK and South Africa has decided to extend its lucrative partnership with US Integrity.</p>
<p>The two started collaborating in 2020 when the sports wagering monitoring company started to provide the sportsbook with its top-tier integrity monitoring services. According to the terms of the expanded agreement, US Integrity will continue to assess large volumes of data to reveal any suspicious betting patterns, irregular contest levels, and officiating.</p>
<p>Integrity and Compliance with State Laws, “of the Utmost Importance”</p>
<p>Using the voice of its chief operating officer Bryant Bennet, Betfred explained that its ongoing interest as a regulated sportsbook is to see that the integrity of its betting offerings and its compliance with all state regulations is maintained at an all-time high.</p>
<p>The representative also spoke about US Integrity’s “proactive approach to maintaining integrity” which is expected to keep playing an essential role in discovering all types of wagering anomalies.</p>
<p>By using US Integrity’s premium monitoring services and proprietary dashboard, Betfred will promote its ongoing brand growth across an even larger number of regulated sports wagering markets in the US, as explained by Matthew Holt, US Integrity’s chief executive officer and co-founder.</p>
<p>Betfred’s recorded success in recent years has already helped it go live in 10 states, including Arizona, Louisiana, Colorado, Washington, Iowa, Pennsylvania, and Maryland. Official launches in Ohio, Virginia, and Nevada were announced earlier in 2023.</p>
<p>Using US Integrity’s state-of-the-art services, Betfred will make sure that its operations will remain uncompromised while all player wagers will be 100% fair across all these markets as well as the new ones it will soon enter.</p>
<p>US Integrity to Keep Providing Conflict-Free Compliance Solutions</p>
<p>The company will continue to offer conflict-free, leading insights, and compliance solutions to all clients while looking for a similar commitment to integrity as shown by Betfred, which perfectly aligns with their own values.</p>
<p>CEO Holt further explained that these partnerships are meant to safeguard the integrity of sports betting and improve the one-of-a-kind proprietary tools used for detecting anomalies developed by US Integrity.</p>
<p>The Las Vegas and New York-based company has support from investors such as SeventySix Capital and Las Vegas Sands while also partnering with important professional sports leagues and collegiate conferences and reputable regulating bodies and operators.</p>
<p>In April, Betfred announced it would offer odds on The World Putting League Championship, together with DraftKings, another high-profile sportsbook.</p>
