<p>The agreement will see the ex-president’s name removed from the iconic property as Bally’s maintains its ambitions for a New York casino license</p>
<p>The Trump Organization has relinquished its lease to operate the Trump Golf Links Ferry Point, a city-owned golf course in the Bronx. After a prolonged battle with the city, the former president agreed to sell the lease to the Bally’s casino chain in a deal worth tens of millions of dollars. This move marks the removal of Trump’s name from the golf course, ending much contention and public debate.</p>
<p>The End of an Era</p>
<p>The Trump Organization had secured a 20-year lease to operate the golf course in 2015. However, this agreement became a focal point of controversy, with former mayor Bill de Blasio seeking to cancel it in the aftermath of the Capitol riot. After years of legal battles and negotiations, Trump’s lease will be transferred to Bally’s.</p>
<p>According to the new agreement, the lease with the Parks Department will end on 21 September, allowing the property’s smooth transfer. This deal marks the end of an era that saw Trump’s name prominently displayed at the Bronx golf course for years. The New York Parks Department was hopeful that the new owner would maintain the venue’s dedication to quality and take good care of the property.</p>
<p>We are supportive of the transfer of the Ferry Point Golf Course to Bally’s, and we are confident they will deliver a high-quality golfing experience to New Yorkers. New York Parks Department statement</p>
<p>The gambling operator plans to change the course’s name to Bally’s Links, finally ending the controversy over the highly visible “Trump Links” rock formation visible from the Whitestone Bridge. Bally’s additionally agreed to purchase 17 more acres near the site, which it will donate to the Parks Department pending state approval.</p>
<p>The Property Is Perfect for Casino Development</p>
<p>While Bally’s plans to keep the golf course open, the operator has significantly more ambitious plans for the property. The company is pursuing one of the coveted New York casino licenses, hoping its plans for a high-profile gambling establishment will surpass the competition. Trump Links’ proximity to a vital highway and distance from dense residential areas make it perfect for such development.</p>
<p>Industry insiders believe the deadline for the final New York casino license bids expires by early 2024, giving Bally’s sufficient time to complete the purchase and ensure compliance with local regulations. Even if the company fails to obtain a license, the golf course should remain a sound investment, generating a yearly profit between $2.5 million and $5 million.</p>
<p>Bally’s is making a multimillion-dollar bet that the property will aid its pursuit of the valuable New York City gaming license, adding an exciting dimension to the future of this location. The operator already has impressive development plans, which will see the property’s complete transformation. Although this deal signifies the conclusion of a contentious chapter in the course’s history, Bally’s Links may yet expand its legacy.</p>
