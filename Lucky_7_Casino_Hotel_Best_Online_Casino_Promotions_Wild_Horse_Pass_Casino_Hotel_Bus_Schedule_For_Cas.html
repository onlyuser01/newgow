    <h1>Lucky 7 Casino Hotel Best Online Casino Promotions Wild Horse Pass Casino Hotel Bus Schedule For Cas</h1>

<p>Richprize</p>
<p>Right so I deposit €680 euro in a short space of time…. Over a few days I managed to win €2030 euro total.</p>
<p>This is valid money and no rules broken and no wagering needed everything 100% complete. I have some screen shots of evidence to prove it.</p>
<p>I was firstly messed around with KYC even after they had emailed me to say I was fully verified throughout my account.</p>
<p>They still sent 4 further emails asking for picture that they already approved.</p>
<p>Withdrawal supposed to take 1-3 days.</p>
<p>I had waited all week for 5 separate withdrawals totalling €2030</p>
<p>Even though straight away it said</p>
<p>"CASHOUT accepted".</p>
<p>They ignored my live chat messages and ignored 7 polite emails.</p>
<p>I eventually had an email from Victoria a VIP manager. This is what she had said to me -</p>
<p>" Dear Thomas,</p>
<p>I trust this message finds you well. My name is Victoria. I’m a VIP manager at RichPrize casino.</p>
<p>I regret to inform you that, due to a temporary backlog in processing payments, your withdrawal has experienced an unexpected delay. I understand how this can be distressing, and I want to offer a solution that ensures you continue to enjoy the entertainment we provide.</p>
<p>To avoid any further inconvenience, I would like to offer you the option to process a partial withdrawal of €700,</p>
<p>while the rest of the funds will be returned to your balance. This will allow you to explore a wider range of entertainment options in our casino, with the exception of sports betting, which will be temporarily restricted.</p>
<p>I understand that this may not be the ideal situation, but I hope it provides you with a more enjoyable gaming experience while we work diligently to resolve the payment processing backlog. Your satisfaction is important to us, and we aim to make your time with us as enjoyable as possible.</p>
<p>If you wish to proceed with this option, please confirm your decision, and I will promptly process the partial withdrawal. If you have any questions or require further assistance, please do not hesitate to reach out.</p>
<p>Thank you for your understanding and continued support. We are committed to ensuring your experience with us remains positive.</p>
<p>Warm regards,</p>
<p>Victoria "</p>
<p>So firstly she did not promptly send any money at all like stated.</p>
<p>Secondly why can she send €700 but not the €2030 I’ve been waiting for?!</p>
<p>Thirdly why was sports betting restricted for me only when it looks fine to me - why can I not play on that?</p>
<p>Here comes the best bit - I then reply to her email asking if after she sends the €700 and returns €1330 back to my casino balance, can I request that €1330 again? Her reply was "yes you can after you wager it all on slots of course!"</p>
<p>Are they joking me? They wanted me to wager my own valid winnings that for some reason they don’t want to give me a single bit of?</p>
<p>Does not make sense at all. My total deposits to this casino was €680. So for her to want to send me €700 but not the rest tells me that they did not want to pay me the winnings/profit.</p>
<p>On the morning of Friday 13th October 2023 I received a nice friendly welcome email from a Julia Richy from Richprize…. only to shortly after that to receive a not so friendly email stating the following -</p>
<p>" Dear Tom,</p>
<p>I hope this message finds you well. We appreciate your continued support and trust in our casino.</p>
<p>We must inform you that we have made the difficult decision to exercise the right reserved under our Terms and Conditions to terminate your account effective immediately.</p>
<p>Please rest assured that any deposits made to your casino account will be promptly refunded to the bank account from which they were initiated.</p>
<p>We are committed to ensuring a smooth and trouble-free process for your refund. The full amount of your deposits shall be refunded back to your bank account within a few working days.</p>
<p>We appreciate the time you've spent with us and wish you the best in your future endeavours, both in and out of the gaming world. "</p>
<p>There’s no reason why they did not pay my winnings and why they decided to block my account completely. Really disgusting thing to do.</p>
<p>I have only received a partial refund of my deposits also. £200 / whatever that equals to in euros is still missing and not been refunded.</p>
<p>I am here to get my winnings paid to my bank account. €2030 which is rightfully mine.</p>
<p>I have attached a bunch of screenshots of evidence here.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
