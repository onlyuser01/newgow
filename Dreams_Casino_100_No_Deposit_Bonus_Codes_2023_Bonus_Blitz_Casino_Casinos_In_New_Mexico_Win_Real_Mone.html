    <h1>Dreams Casino 100 No Deposit Bonus Codes 2023 Bonus Blitz Casino Casinos In New Mexico Win Real Mone</h1>

<p>I was playing on a deposit bonus when a customer service representative from Kats casino called me said that he could add my balance back to $100 if I played down to under $1 so I played the remaining $16 quickly to get the $100 not realizing it was a scam. The agent did not say this would prevent me from cashing out. When I hit the playthrough $329 was removed my balance was dropped to $100 it was at that point I learned my withdraw limit was also set to max at $100. This is the first time I have requested a withdraw with Kats casino so I have not cashed out any bonus and I have made cash deposit. If this is a rule why have a representative call and apply the funds? That seems a little sketchy. At most casinos if you add try to add a coupon back to back it will say deposit required. If I wasn't going to be able to withdraw the $100 then why did the casino remove the $329 when I reached playthrough. Last thing needs to be looked at they say no fees to withdraw winnings but that is not true they charge $30 for bitcoin. I just want this casino to deposit my $100 as they took the other 329 of my winnings and justify it by saying played 2 bonuses in a row but fail to mention previous bonus was part of a cash deposit bonus and that the casino called me on the phone and offered me this bonus. I have requested my withdraw about 5 times now and after about 48hrs 100is on my account but I am not playing it I am waiting for the casino to do the right thing.</p>
