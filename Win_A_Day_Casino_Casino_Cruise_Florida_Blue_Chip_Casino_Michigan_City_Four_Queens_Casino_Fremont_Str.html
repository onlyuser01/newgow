    <h1>Win A Day Casino Casino Cruise Florida Blue Chip Casino Michigan City Four Queens Casino Fremont Str</h1>

<p>Hi there</p>
<p>I had a £10 free chip which I played through the requirements.</p>
<p>i got to the £110 withdrawal limit as was told I can withdraw £100 and £10 would be removed for the free chip.</p>
<p>I was then told to deposit Bitcoin as it could be faster to withdraw.</p>
<p>only once I said this did the operator say I’d failed to meet a bonus requirement which was using more than 3 bonus in one week.</p>
<p>I explained that I’d not been told this and the bonus was issued in my account.</p>
<p>Ive checked all the t&amp;cs and cant see anything.</p>
<p>i don’t know whether this operator just wanted me to take a different offer as she kept saying I could get another bonus.</p>
<p>Ive contacted them today and they’ve said my withdraw is approved and pending and ID a will take upto 72 hours to clear and then the withdraw will be 5-18 business days depending on what I used to deposit .</p>
<p>So now I’m confused and really can’t see any issue with this withdrawal</p>
<p>thank you</p>
