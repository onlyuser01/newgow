<p>The 2022 RBC Heritage is teeing off on Thursday, April 14 at Harbour Town Golf Links in South Carolina. Steward Cink is the man who won the event last year, but online sportsbooks don’t see him as a serious candidate to do it again.</p>
<p>The main reason is that in the 2022 event, the entry list is packed with elite golfers – Justin Thomas, Collin Morikawa, Cameron Smith, and many others.</p>

<p>Top Favorites to Win the 2022 RBC Heritage</p>
<p>An interesting thing about the RBC Heritage is that surprises often happen in this tournament. For example, the odds on last year’s winner were +12500 before the start of the event. Stewart Cink shocked the world in 2021 by winning the RBC Heritage by four strokes from Emiliano Grillo and Harold Varner III.</p>
<p>Are we going to see another upset this weekend? WE might, although oddsmakers think the most likely candidate for the trophy are Justin Thomas, Collin Morikawa, and Cameron Smith. These three are the only participants with the odds on under +2000.</p>
<p>Justin Thomas was one of the top favorites to win the last weekend’s tournament – The Masters 2022 – but he failed to do much. He finished in tied eighth place. This week, he has a chance to bounce back by winning the 2022 RBC Heritage, where he’s the #1 favorite.</p>
<p>Just behind him in the list of RBC Heritage favorites is Collin Morikawa, who did okay last week, finishing fifth. Although he is yet to win an event in 2022, Morikawa has been playing well since the start of the year. Plus, he seems to love the type of terrain as the one that awaits him at Harbour Town Golf Links.</p>
<p>The #3 favorite to win the 2022 RBC Heritage is Cameron Smith, who finished tied third at The Masters, but whose credentials give him every right to dream big.</p>
<p>2022 RBC Heritage Sleepers to Watch Out for</p>
<p>Sungjae Im is one of the golfers you need to pay attention to. The South Korean is coming off an impressive performance at The Masters, where he finished tied eighth. Although he could’ve done even better, finishing in the top 10 is a great success. This goes especially for the fact that this is his fifth top 10 finish of the season.</p>
<p>Matt Kuchar is another underdog you should be aware of. The guy finished in a tie for the second place at the Valero Texas Open earlier this month, which is proof of his decent form. Further, Kuchar seems to love playing on this course, the evidence being that he’s already won the RBC Heritage once. It happened in 2014, while he also finished second in 2019.</p>
<p>2022 RBC Heritage Predictions</p>
<p>Collin Morikawa seems to be in top shape, both physically and mentally. His enthusiasm, combined with his determination to win an event ASAP might prove crucial this week. Plus, with the odds of +1400, Morikawa sure looks like an interesting pick.</p>
<p>Pick: Collin Morikawa</p>
