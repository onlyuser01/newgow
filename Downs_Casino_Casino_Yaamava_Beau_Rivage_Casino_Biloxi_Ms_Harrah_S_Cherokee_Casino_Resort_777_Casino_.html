<p>The American Gaming Association (AGA) has updated its dedicated Commercial Gaming Revenue Tracker with the latest results for November 2022. The results continued to improve on an annual and monthly basis, with the total gross gaming revenue registered in the month reaching $5.02bn. This was a 2.4% improvement from November 2021.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the total gross gaming revenue registered from January through November 2022 stood at $54.93bn, a massive improvement of 13.5% from the period from January through November 2021.</p>
<p>When comparing the monthly results between 2022 and 2021, this year’s table games actually registered a 7.2% drop in the overall gross gaming revenue. Taking the year-to-date- results, all segments surged. iGaming gross gaming revenue was up by 36.4% to $4.54bn. Sports betting gross gaming revenue was up 65.4% at $6.56bn.</p>
<p>Table game gross gaming revenue stood at $9.07bn, an improvement of 14%. Slot gross gaming revenue at $31.40bn was up by 5.4% overall. The November 2022 results were the 21st consecutive month of growth in the gambling industry in the United States, an important metric, indicative of the robust recovery of the sector.</p>
<p>The sports betting, casino games, and iGaming sector pulled together $5.02bn as noted above. However, it was not all good news for the entire industry. In fact, some 10 jurisdictions marked declines in their year-over-year revenue growth in November, the AGA’s Commercial Tracker noted.</p>
<p>On the plus side, 21 jurisdictions pulled ahead in their monthly results, underpinning healthy growth. The two-digit results are not in themselves seen as a huge surge in the overall performance, but they are definitely consistent indicators that the legalization of gambling across the United States has been contributing to stronger results, bigger tax revenue, and stronger regulated market channelization, as well as a sign of ongoing recovery from the pandemic.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Nevada saw its monthly gambling revenue drop by 7.6% from November 2021. This comes despite an increase in visitation numbers for Las Vegas by 4.9% on a year-over-year basis. Other notable declines to take place in November 2022 include the DC sports betting market which shrank by 14.7%, down from the first 11 months of 2021.</p>
<p>Mississippi lost 3.7% in monthly results and South Dakota’s gambling revenue shrank by 1%, both compared to the first 11 months of 2021. The remainder of the jurisdictions seemed to do well when comparing the results they scored from January through November 2022 to the results over the same period a year earlier.</p>
<p>AGA’s tracker reported that iGaming operations in states such as Michigan, New Jersey, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and Connecticut remained very strong in November 2022 with a revenue record of $458.4m, or up 33% from November 2021.</p>
