<p>In today’s MyBookie Sports review, we will take a detailed look at one of the best-known and established sportsbooks of our time. The website is considered one of the top-ranking online sports betting sites in the United States and for a good reason.</p>
<p>Apart from offering thousands of possible events to bet on, MyBookie.ag runs extensive promotions, posts early and competitive odds, and provides an impressive variety of bonuses designed to boost your bankroll.</p>
<p>As one of the leading bookmakers, MyBookie has a remarkable functionality and offers great deposit and withdrawal limits. You will find a variety of useful payment options. For further details on MyBookie Sportsbook, have a look through the rest of our review.</p>
<p>Who Is MyBookie.ag?</p>
<p>MyBookie is a relatively new sportsbook launched in August 2014. Since it arrived, MyBookie has been consistently improving on its offer and offering a quality sports betting product as indicated by the variety of odds and available competitive markets.</p>
<p>The company’s servers are based in the Canadian Indian Territory, allowing the company to safely manage consumer data and MyBookie Sports itself is based in San Jose, Costa Rica. MyBookie accepts US players and has done so since it launched under today’s name.</p>
<p>The only real blemish on the website’s name is their shift away from BetOnSports.com, although some executives transitioned from the latter to MyBookie.ag today. Nevertheless, the bookie has used the opportunity to start fresh and they have done so.</p>
<p>MyBookie Sportsbook’s ratings have been steadily climbing throughout the years and today, many sports aficionados hold the website to be one of the go-to places to make a sports bet if you are based in the United States.</p>

<p>MyBookie Withdrawal Verification</p>
<p>MyBookie Welcome Bonus and Promotions</p>
<p>MyBookie Sports Pros and Cons</p>
<p>With several years of operations already, the bookmaker has been able to do well in some areas and not as much in others. Overall, the experience is balanced and the pros far exceed the cons these days.</p>
<p>What We Think Is Great</p>
<p>Early and competitive odds</p>
<p>Sports-specific markets</p>
<p>Great deposits system</p>
<p>Verification for withdrawals</p>
<p>Great variety of bonuses</p>
<p>MyBookie Sports consistently publishes some of the earliest and fairest odds. The bookie has been delivering an extensive variety of events, covering all mainstream competitions, but also running a number of interesting, sports-specific proposition bets.</p>
<p>One key area MyBookie has improved in is the banking system. The banking &amp; deposit options page today is much more user friendly than at any other point, displaying all the information sports bettors need to make an informed choice and know exactly when they can expect their money to arrive or show up on their balance in the bookie.</p>
<p>There has been a steady adoption of cryptocurrency solutions as a way to expedite payments as well as a deposit helpline and a section called Important Reminders, to clarify any ambiguity in the banking terms.</p>
<p>There is still some bias against the payouts, but referencing customer opinions, we are confident that these have been solved and further improvements are coming.</p>
<p>What Can Improve</p>
<p>Payouts can sometimes be a little slow</p>
<p>You could say that MyBookie.ag started on the wrong foot. When the company arrived, it used a dated user interface and the payouts took a while. It wasn’t until 2016 when the company started to pick up a little steam and attracted some of its most loyal community members, some of whom have been with the website for over four years.</p>
<p>Because of previous complaints, the website now needs to walk a little further to convince the community that it has solved its issues with delayed payment. Upon examining the cashier section and testing ourselves, though, we can confirm that the results are satisfying and MyBookie Sports honors payouts in the specific time frames stated on the website without delays.</p>
<p>MyBookie Sports Betting Software</p>
<p>MyBookie.ag has shaken off the old and clunky look, coming with a brand-new user interface, marked by high-functionality, spacious layout, and great accessibility. Sports bettors will find navigation quick and simple, allowing a great desktop and mobile experience both.</p>
<p>The sports betting software is developed internally, offering the sportsbook full control over how to best tweak the user interface and features available. In purely designer’s terms, the website has a useful and beautiful UI, allowing players to pick from multiple betting markets.</p>
<p>What Markets Can You Bet On?</p>
<p>Speaking of available markets, sports bettors will have a shot at over 30 different betting options in the root categories, and then thousands of additional options as they focus on a particular sport. You can pick from multiple mainstream competitions, including:</p>
<p>NFL</p>
<p>NBA</p>
<p>Golf</p>
<p>MMA</p>
<p>Horse racing</p>
<p>Boxing</p>
<p>Motorsports &amp; others</p>
<p>The entire selection is easy to navigate as each root category will provide you with sub-markets to pick from. Clicking on MMA, for example, will bring up the available betting opportunities divided between UFC Lines, UFC Upcoming Events, MMA Specials, and Conor McGregor Specials, who only recently retired again.</p>
<p>The selection is often dynamic with the events that get the most action pushed to the very top in the top left corner. As of the time of the review, MyBookie had quite some great options, including:</p>
<p>PGA</p>
<p>Boxing</p>
<p>UFC</p>
<p>NFL</p>
<p>Entertainment</p>
<p>Politics &amp; specific events</p>
<p>MyBookie offers some of the earliest but also most accurate odds, too, giving sports bettors sufficient time to pick the best markets and better yet, have enough time to consider their wagers.</p>
<p>The added functionality of the user interface is a huge plus, as you can browse through the entire offer without ever experiencing a technical malfunction, something MyBookie is often cited for.</p>
<p>In terms of bet types, there is once again, an impressive variety, with so many excellent match winners, futures, and propositions available.</p>
<p>MyBookie will run entertaining bets that will create value for you, asking you to guess the next President of the United States, predict the PGA Masters or Super Bowl winner, or simply try and call if we will have a Triple Crown winner this year.</p>
<p>Types of Bets You Can Place</p>
<p>Players may choose from a variety of different market archetypes. You are welcome to pick your favorite market and place a wager accordingly. Presently, you can choose from the following markets, which may vary across different competitions:</p>
<p>Straights</p>
<p>Totals</p>
<p>Moneylines</p>
<p>Puck lines</p>
<p>Futures</p>
<p>Props</p>
<p>Live Betting</p>
<p>Parlays &amp; others</p>
<p>Available Payment Methods at MyBookie.ag</p>
<p>MyBookie offers sports bettors a good variety of banking options to make the most of each payment.</p>
<p>You will have access to a transparent banking section where all maximum and minimum deposits and withdrawals will be displayed, you will see all fees – if such apply – noted down and have other useful information to make sure you are completing each financial transaction quickly and without any additional hassle.</p>
<p>To help you find out more about the MyBookie payment option, we have taken a closer look and reviewed all existing methods.</p>
<p>MyBookie Deposits: Quick and Simple</p>
<p>Deposits at MyBookie are quite straightforward and simple. You will be able to pick from a mix of trusted options, including MasterCard, Bitcoin, Person2Person, Visa, Litecoin, and BitcoinCash. Just review the information and pick the method that suits you best.</p>
<p>Deposit Method Limits Processing Time MasterCard Min $45 / Max $2,500 Immediate Bitcoin Min $45 / Max $10,000 Immediate Person2Person Min $100 / Max $500 2-4 business days Visa Min $45 / Max $2,500 Immediate Litecoin Min $45 / Max $10,000 Immediate Bitcoin Cash Min $45 / Max $10,000 Immediate</p>
<p>To make things even simpler, you can expect a high clearance rate from all bank cards available at MyBookie, with the acceptance rate close to 100%. In other words, MyBookie will be able to quickly process your deposits and any bounce back will be noted down at no additional cost to you. But the good news is now deposit bounce should happen at all.</p>
<p>Person2Person is another payment method many sports bettors find handy. This is a reliable option popularized in the past which most betting veterans are familiar with and comfortable using. It often makes payments perceivably safer, although MyBookie has strict standards to ensure the individual safety of all transactions.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrencies are another popular method of depositing. You will have quick and easy access to payment solutions, such as Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, and of course Bitcoin. All cryptocurrencies offer you a generous minimum and maximum deposit at $45 and $10,000 respectively.</p>
<p>Get a BitPay Card for Easier Banking</p>
<p>If you yearn for slightly easier banking options, most consumers recommend obtaining a BitPay card. This is an easy way to convert your Bitcoin into FIAT currency, which saves you the trouble of finding a way to turn your winnings into US dollars. That is what players think of BitPay in combination with MyBookie’s Bitcoin banking:</p>
<p>The BitPay card is awesome. It doesn’t seem like they take anything off the market exchange rate either so you truly get fair conversion value. If you’re willing to use it like a debit card for purchases, then the card is basically free. Fees only come into the picture if you want to withdraw cash at an ATM.</p>
<p>Withdrawals at MyBookie.ag Are Hassle-Free</p>
<p>Previously the topic of heated discussions, MyBookie has managed to introduce a reliable selection of withdrawal options customers can benefit from.</p>
<p>If you love to bet on sports and want to make sure your money is transacted quickly and safely, picking the right cash out option matters. MyBookie allows you to cash out between $25 and $5,000 per transaction, eliminating most fees, and guaranteeing quick turnaround.</p>
<p>Withdrawal Method Limits Processing Times Bitcoin Min $25 / Max $5,000 24 hours eCheck Min $50 / Max $3,000 5-7 days Person to Person Min $500 / Max $5,000 5-7 days</p>
<p>Though MyBookie.ag seems to offer only a handful of payout options, they are all quick and reliable. The downside to some of the FIAT money cashouts are the associated fees and perhaps the processing time. However, you can always expect from MyBookie Sports to honor a request for withdrawal without any hassle.</p>
<p>MyBookie Payout FAQs</p>
<p>Are there any fees applied to MyBookie.ag withdrawals? MyBookie.ag charges to fees on Bitcoin withdrawals. However, you will need to pay up to $100 on eChecks and up to $160 on Person to Person. How much money can I withdraw from MyBookie in one transaction? You may withdraw up to $5,000 per transaction with Person to Person and Bitcoin and up to $3,000 with eCheck. How long does it take to withdraw money from MyBookie Sports? Withdrawals are usually completed within 24 hours for Bitcoin, but it may take up to 7 business days for other, conventional banking methods.</p>
<p>MyBookie Withdrawal Verification</p>
<p>One particular aspect of the MyBookie cash out experience is the requirement for verification. It’s through this mechanism that the sportsbook assures that all bettors get to enjoy a safe betting environment. The withdrawal process is thankfully very simple. Here are the few steps you need to follow when requesting a cash out from MyBookoie.ag:</p>
<p>Log into your MyBookie account Navigate to the Cashier section Click on the Payout option Comply with the phone verification pop-up Enter the 4-digit code to proceed</p>
<p>To verify your identity, you will also need to be prepared to present specific documents, such as a government-issued ID, utility bills or card copies, or bank statements. These documents are requested at the discretion of the sportsbook and are a normal part of the KYC and AML compliance process.</p>
<p>MyBookie Bonuses &amp; Promotions</p>
<p>MyBookie runs one of the most impressive selections of bonuses and sports betting promotions geared specifically towards the needs of sports aficionados. There is a good choice of sign-up and cash bonuses, rebates, referrals, and reload options. Presently, bettors are welcome to choose from:</p>
<p>50% Sports Sign Up</p>
<p>10% Cash Bonus up to $200</p>
<p>25% Sports Reload up to $500</p>
<p>8% Horse Rebate</p>
<p>250% Referral Bonus</p>
<p>50% Sports Sign UP</p>
<p>The bookmaker has two individual welcome bonuses to make sure you start your sports betting journey with extra cash. The offer is very simple. You need to make a deposit that will then be matched by 50% and grant you up to $1,000 on your first deposit. Bettors will then have to rollover the bonus 10x times. To claim the bonus:</p>
<p>Deposit : $45 or more</p>
<p>: $45 or more Use promo code: MYB50</p>

Once again, you will need to deposit $45 to activate the bonus and also use the 200CASH bonus code. Bet on your favorite sports with a bit of a boost right now.</p>
<p>Deposit : $45 or more</p>

<p>Sports bettors who need a bit in the way of extra funds will enjoy the 25% reload bonus that brings up to $500 bonus cash. To active the bonus, you just deposit $100 and place the MYB25 bonus code. Now, all you have to do is roll it over 5x times.</p>
<p>Deposit : $100 or more</p>
<p>: $100 or more Use promo code: MYB25</p>
<p>8% Horse Rebate</p>
<p>For anyone who loves horse racing, there are special treats awaiting at MyBookie. The 8% Horse Rebate comes with a simple 1x rollover requirement and it’s granted automatically.</p>
<p>250% Referral Bonus</p>
<p>Bringing a friend over will allow you to claim a sizeable boost to your bankroll with up to $250 in bonus funds coming your way. The sports referral bonus comes with a 5x wagering requirement, which is easy to complete.</p>
<p>The Loyalty Program</p>
<p>The Bookie Points Reward Program is one of the highlights of the bookmaker’s experience. MyBookie offers you redeemable VIP Play and VIP travel experiences. The bookie points are accumulated at a different pace, and specifically:</p>
<p>Bet Type Bookie Points Straight Bets 1 Parlays (2 – 15 Teams) 2 Teasers 1.5 If Bets 1.5 Reverse Bets 1.5</p>
<p>You will receive your free play options based on the Bookie Points (BP) you have amassed, according to the following table:</p>
<p>$10 free play redeemable for 110 points</p>
<p>$20 free play redeemable for 220 points</p>
<p>$50 free play redeemable for 550 points</p>
<p>$100 free play redeemable for 1100 points</p>
<p>The VIP experiences are redeemable upon reaching the BP threshold. Visit the “Loyalty” section of your MyBookie account for exact details.</p>
<p>Customer Support</p>
<p>You can get in touch using one of several trusted methods. MyBookie will allow you to connect using popular methods such as live chat assistance, phone call or simply emailing via the contact page.</p>
<p>Getting in touch is easy. You can simply place a call on the US toll-free land-line 844-866-BETS (2387) or jump in a live chat with customer support. You will hardly need to wait long for a live agent to come to your rescue and many people actually prefer this way.</p>
<p>If you are in no particular hurry, you may find the last method the handiest, as it would allow you to just send an email through the contact form in the Contact Us section of the sportsbook.</p>
<p>What does Reddit Think about MyBookie.ag Sports?</p>
<p>No sports betting website can truly pass muster these days unless it has been judged by Reddit. MyBookie’s Reddit threads are often heated, but they have been invaluable in determining whether you can trust the bookmaker.</p>
<p>On the one hand, you have every reason to believe in this bookie. The lines have been juiced and there are various odds boosters to provide you with additional value. The website’s props are very fair, allowing payers to benefit further and bettors have been very happy with the customer support at the website.</p>
<p>Some users have said that the website was good, but it took “forever” to get paid, citing the verification process as the main issue. However, verifying your identity is stated in the Terms &amp; Conditions of the website, which should not be overlooked.</p>
<p>Overall, what will make an impression on you is that even if opinions are a little contrasted, i.e. “they will always pay you, albeit somewhat reluctantly,” the majority of sports bettors agree that MyBookie.ag is a solid betting agency. True, there are some rough edges to polish still, but this seems the farthest anyone would go in commenting on MyBookie outside of sharing their satisfaction with the website.</p>
<p>Conclusion: Is MyBookie What You Need?</p>
<p>In a word, yes. MyBookie.ag Sports is a legitimate operator where you can find and one of the largest, too. There are hundreds if not thousands of markets to pick from and a great way to convert your Bitcoin withdrawals into US dollars without any fees.</p>
<p>The website has one of the best sports betting software in the United States, and we recommend them as a decent bookie to call your new betting home or use just for value betting opportunities.</p>
