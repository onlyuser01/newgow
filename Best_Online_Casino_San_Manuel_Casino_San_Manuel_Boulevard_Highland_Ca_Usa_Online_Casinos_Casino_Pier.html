    <h1>Best Online Casino San Manuel Casino San Manuel Boulevard Highland Ca Usa Online Casinos Casino Pier</h1>

<p>Playson is reinforcing its position in the European market through a partnership with the newly launched MerkurXtip, an online casino operating in the Czech Republic. This partnership will enable Playson to deliver its prominent selection of games to the casino and features some excellent player-favorite titles such as Legend of Cleopatra, Sevens &amp; Fruits: 20 Lines, and Book of Gold Classic.</p>
<p>Playson Delivers Award-Winning Content to MerkurXtip</p>
<p>The casino, owned by Gauselmann Group, is looking to quickly become a recognizable brand on the Czech Republican market and create memorable experiences for players of all backgrounds. MerkurXtip will focus on slots, but also roulette games, and then again move into other realms of the experience, such as sports, poker, and sports betting.</p>
<p>Playson will give a good boost to the property which will spend the initial stages of the rollout focusing on slot experiences as they are recognizable player-favorite options with more content coming down the road. Playson is also happy to be consolidating its presence in Central Europe, a market that has demonstrated its potential and has been able to attract some of the biggest iGaming players over the last years.</p>
<p>Playson sales director Blanka Homor welcomed the opportunity to strike another deal in the region, as the company seeks to continue gathering momentum across Europe:</p>
<p>We’re delighted to have reached another deal that sees us develop in one of the industry’s fastest growing markets. Expanding in Central Europe is an important and strategic target for us, we are hoping to reach more agreements with regulated operators across the area. Playson sales director Blanka Homor</p>
<p>Both Companies Are Happy with the Deal’s Potential</p>
<p>MerkurXtip head for the Czech Republic Jan Dobiáš was similarly pleased with the partnership. Dobiáš welcomed the opportunity to be adding another prominent and noteworthy casino game supplier to its ranks.</p>
<p>“Our Czech Republican platform just launched and having Playson on board ensures that our product offering is outstanding from day one,” he added. Playson recently entered the iGaming market in Ontario, Canada, expanding its presence significantly.</p>
