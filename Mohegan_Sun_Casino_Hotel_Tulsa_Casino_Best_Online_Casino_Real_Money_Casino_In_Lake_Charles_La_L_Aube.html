<p>The newly created online gambling operator Bet Seven Online has selected Intelitics to power the performance marketing platform for its SuperSeven brand.</p>
<p>SuperSeven Affiliate Program to Benefit from Intelitics’ Platform</p>
<p>Bet Seven Online has chosen analytics platform provider Intelitics to power the performance marketing platform for its SuperSeven brand. Bet Seven Online was established in 2020 by industry veterans and its first brand is SuperSeven. It aims to provide players with a unique collection of RNG and live casino content, alongside the gamification features.</p>
<p>The upcoming SuperSeven Affiliate Program will benefit from Intelitics’ data-driven premium product package and modern platform. Bet Seven Online will use it to run all affiliate and paid media activity of the program including real-time media campaign overseeing and player tracking.</p>
<p>Moreover, SuperSeven’s publisher partners will have access to real-time data and analytics through the product package and platform. They will also make use of flexible pixel tracking allowing them to effectively manage their own campaigns and monitor their performance in a timely manner.</p>
<p>“We decided to partner with Intelitics as we put great value and importance on the ability to analyze campaigns. Providing publishers partners with real-time data within our affiliate platform has been a priority, and with Intelitics we can do this.” Hanna Dahl, Head of Affiliates at SuperSeven</p>
<p>Dahl added that Intelitics will also help the operator offer its affiliate partners a modern back office including features such as media options, as well as important stats and data through a single point of access. On the other hand, this will allow SuperSeven to build strong partnerships with affiliates.</p>
<p>SuperSeven Gains Momentum After Signing With Gaming Innovation Group</p>
<p>In October 2020, Bet Seven Online signed a multi-year partnership with Gaming Innovation Group Inc. (GIG) to provide SuperSeven with GIG’s technological platform. Under the agreement, SuperSeven will hold an independent license and remain the exclusive owner of its intellectual property. The partnership is expected to have a positive effect on GIG’s revenues from H2 2021 onwards.</p>
<p>Allan Petrilli, Vice President of Sales at Intelitics, shared his excitement about the project with Bet Seven Online. Petrilli added that Intelitics will provide the platform and products required to operate SuperSeven’s affiliate program and paid user acquisition.</p>
<p>Intelitics’ VP said that the platform features an intuitive design for both operators and affiliates plus unrivalled access to real-time data. These features give operators and affiliates the ability to track how their campaigns are performing and make adjustments, if necessary.</p>
<p>Intelitics has been recently granted a license by the Colorado Division of Gaming. As a result, the company is heading into the Centennial State and North America in general.</p>
