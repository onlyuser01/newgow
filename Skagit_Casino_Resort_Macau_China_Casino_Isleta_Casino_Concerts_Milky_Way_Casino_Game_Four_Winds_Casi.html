<p>Gaming Corps, a Swedish-based iGaming developer, has been greenlit for launch in Gibraltar. After securing approval from the Gibraltar Betting and Gaming Association, the developer will be able to offer its products through the Relax Gaming platform.</p>
<p>Gaming Corps Receives Gibraltar License</p>
<p>Gaming Corps will capitalize on its new license and will launch its full suite of iGaming titles in the country. As a result, local customers will get to try some of the developer’s best games. The developer has a rich suite of games, varying in genres. Customers in Gibraltar will be able to try out traditional Slots and Table games as well as Crash and Mine-styled games.</p>
<p>The launch will expand Gaming Corps’ global iGaming footprint and will also reinforce Relax Gaming’s presence in Gibraltar. Expansion has been one of Gaming Corps’ top priorities this year, as attested by the numerous strategic deals the company has sealed.</p>
<p>Speaking about the current deal, the chief executive of Gaming Corps, Juha Kauppinen, said that he is delighted that the company successfully received approval from the Gibraltar Betting and Gaming Association. He noted that customers in the region will now be able to try out the Swedish developer’s games.</p>
<p>Kauppinen said that his team is looking forward to engaging customers in Gibraltar. He added that this is all made possible by the great collaboration with Relax Gaming and thanked his teams for their hard work.</p>
<p>The Developer Is Steadily Expanding</p>
<p>For example, in August, Gaming Corps teamed up with Hub88, which agreed to distribute the former company’s games across several key European and Asian markets. As a platform boasting over 80 providers, Hub88 is the aggregator of choice of many operators, making it a perfect partner for Gaming Corps. The agreement was praised by Gaming Corps’ head of commercial, Danielle Calafato, who said that her team is thrilled to join forces with Hub88. She said that launching in more Asian countries is an important milestone for the company.</p>
<p>Earlier that same month, Gaming Corps’ portfolio also went live on SkillOnNet’s platform in a deal that saw its game launch with another top-tier supplier. Calafato shared her thoughts on this deal as well, saying that it is in line with the developer’s “ambitious plans” to bring cutting-edge titles to operators. She noted that Gaming Corps is bullish on making best-in-class content that suits gamers’ and operators’ needs.</p>
<p>Two months prior, the developer inked yet another similar deal, this time with the famed Glitnor Group.</p>
