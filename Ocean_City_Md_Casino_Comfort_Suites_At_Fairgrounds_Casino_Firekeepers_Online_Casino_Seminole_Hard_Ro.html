    <h1>Ocean City Md Casino Comfort Suites At Fairgrounds Casino Firekeepers Online Casino Seminole Hard Ro</h1>

<p>Hello, I made a profit of around €65o -700 from the 25 free spins at Tangier Casino. This was reduced to approx. 28.00 as an amount to be paid out.</p>
<p>I wanted a little more and played it up to around €120 and then didn't gamble away half of it again. My last balance was about 63€. The next day when I wanted to make a deposit of €10 to claim my winnings, I couldn't log in, nor was the live chat available. The following message appears when you register:</p>
<p>"Tangiers Casino is currently undergoing maintenance. We are constantly working to improve our services for you. Please be patient, it will be back online shortly."</p>
<p>To my astonishment not only with Tangier, but also with Winnerama and Lucky Draw (I know that the 3 belong together). I also opened an account there.</p>
<p>I can access the casinos, but when I try to login my account (with username and password) the maintenance text comes up. That means: I CANNOT DEPOSIT ANYTHING and therefore CANNOT request a PAYOUT and this at all 3 casinos.</p>
<p>I then wrote an email to Tangier as follows:</p>
<p>HI, I would like to know how long the maintenance will last.</p>
<p>Access has been blocked for the entire morning, isn't it funny???</p>
<p>SINCE APPROX. 07:00 AM.</p>
<p>Tangiers Casino is currently undergoing maintenance.</p>
<p>We are constantly working to improve our services for you.</p>
<p>Please be patient, it will be activated again shortly.</p>
<p>I'm curious about her explanation.</p>
<p>Best regards</p>

<p>No Answer!!</p>
<p>next mail:</p>
<p>what about the account???</p>
<p>No Answer!!</p>
<p>next mail:</p>
<p>Hello, I have just one question:</p>
<p>Why have I not been able to log into my account for over a week?</p>
<p>The same applies to WINNERAMA and LUCKY DRAW:</p>
<p>Welcome back.</p>
<p>Tangiers Casino is currently undergoing maintenance. We are constantly working to improve our services for you. Please be patient, it will be activated again shortly.</p>
<p>I have not received a reply to a message from me.</p>
<p>Maybe it works now.</p>
<p>Warm greetings</p>
<p>No Answer!!</p>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I wrote to them the day before yesterday and haven't heard from them.</p>
<p>Why is my account still blocked?</p>
<p>How about feedback?</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>
<p>B.S***</p>
<p>finally ANSWER!!</p>
<p>Hello there,</p>
<p>Thank you for contacting us,</p>
<p>We have double checked on your account and we can see that it is indeed currently disabled, please contact security@tangierscasino.com to check on the status of your account and get further assistance with your inquiry.</p>
<p>kind regards,</p>
<p>support team</p>
<p>Mail from me to security@tangierscasino.com</p>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I should contact her.</p>
<p>I would like to know why my account access is blocked, not only at TANGIER CASINO but also at LUCKY DRAW and WINNERAMA.</p>
<p>Why is she writing "maintenance" and not her account has been banned for that reason, how ridiculous!!!</p>
<p>They only annoy potential customers and are not worthy of such a large provider.</p>
<p>What's next?</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>
<p>Barbara S***</p>
<p>By the way, this is what I got as an answer:</p>
<p>TNG Feedback!!!</p>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Thank you for contacting us.</p>
<p>We have reviewed your account and would like to inform you that it has been closed due to several inconsistencies found in it. Please note that this decision is irrevocable.</p>
<p>We wish you the best of luck for the future.</p>
<p>I wrote another email about the bonus.</p>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>thanks for the fast reply.</p>
<p>What a ridiculous justification.</p>
<p>What happens to the bonus I've earned?</p>
<p>Request for feedback.</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>
<p>B.S***</p>
<p>as usual, no ANSWER!!</p>
<p>I don't really care about the money, I think it's incredibly unfair to treat potential customers like that.</p>
<p>As a player, there are a lot of rules to follow, it can't be; that the casino closes the account at will without any explanation and does not even let you know. I'm curious what you can achieve.</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>
