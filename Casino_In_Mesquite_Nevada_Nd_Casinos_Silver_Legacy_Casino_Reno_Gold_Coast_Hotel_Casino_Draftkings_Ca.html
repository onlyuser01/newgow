<p>The latest Chicago-based division of the famous New York Stock Exchange-listed fuboTV live streaming platform Fubo Gaming is pending approval to launch Fubo Sportsbook in Ohio. The sportsbook will become the official mobile sports wagering partner of the Cleveland Cavaliers. In the context of the much-anticipated HB29 bill regarding the legalization of sports wagering in the state having been finally signed in December, the new market access deal sparked a lot of interest among bettors and betting companies.</p>
<p>At the moment, January 1, 2023, is the most probable launch date for sports wagering in the state, with many voices calling an early launch prior to the start of the 2022 NFL season in September a mere fantasy. Fubo Sportsbook is also waiting for a series of regulatory approvals to launch in the Buckeye State.</p>
<p>What Cavs Fans Can Expect from Fubo Sportsbook</p>
<p>The new agreement between Fubo and the Cleveland Cavs is not completely unexpected since the two companies have already signed a previous marketing partnership last October. According to the marketing deal leading up to the launch of the mobile platform in the state, the Cavs and Fubo Gaming will keep promoting their partnership using the co-branded signage visible on a variety of marketing assets, including radio game programming and team television.</p>
<p>Fubo Sportsbook’s betting platform will provide Cavs supporters with fully customizable, highly engaging, and interactive experiences on game-day. The new mobile sports betting platform relies on state-of-the-art technology, high connectivity, and entertaining features for unique and unparalleled experiences for fans.</p>
<p>The new agreement is expected to create and promote a sports betting marketplace for locals who support the team and other players’ supporters spread across the state. Fans will also enjoy a new sports lounge measuring 3,000 square feet downtown at the Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse.</p>
<p>The lounge will become the go-to game-day “it” destination for supporters, drawing fans in with plenty of incentives and exclusive bonuses part of the Fubo Sportsbook offerings, on top of the standard amenities and advanced technology. Cavs fans will also get the chance to comfortably watch live NBA games and other exciting sports events in real-time straight from the lounge.</p>
<p>The Ohio Market Access Deal Is a Big Step Forward for Fubo</p>
<p>The Fubo Sportsbook platform is a pioneer in mixing a sports betting platform with immersive live TV streaming that was launched in Q4 2021. The platform is currently live in Arizona and Iowa.</p>
<p>According to Cavaliers and Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse CEO Len Komoroski, the new partnership is a natural step of the current collaboration with Fubo Gaming. At the same time, Fubo Gaming’s president Scott Butera called the chance to penetrate the Ohio sports betting market with the Cavs by their side a “major step forward.”</p>
<p>The 2016 NBA Championship winning team is renowned for its continued interest in creating the most innovative and entertaining experiences for its supporters. Once the new agreement becomes official, Fubo Gaming will get access to an incredibly appealing base of customers ready to take advantage of Fubo’s integrated sports wagering and streaming options.</p>
<p>The company is also undergoing a series of other significant changes, with former Chief Operating Officer Sam Rattner resigning from his position at the beginning of January. However, the changes in the board of directors have not stopped the company from carrying on with its growth plans.</p>
<p>On the contrary, Fubo Gaming is expected to penetrate new markets in the upcoming months after going through similar regulatory approvals or legislation enactments, depending on the targeted jurisdictions. The Ohio deal is Fubo Gaming’s seventh agreement that grants it access to a new market in the US, after Texas via the Houston Dynamo Football Club, Arizona, Iowa, Indiana, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey.</p>
