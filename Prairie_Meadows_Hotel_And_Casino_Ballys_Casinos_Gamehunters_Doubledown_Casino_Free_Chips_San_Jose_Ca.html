    <h1>Prairie Meadows Hotel And Casino Ballys Casinos Gamehunters Doubledown Casino Free Chips San Jose Ca</h1>

<p>Dear petronela, i have forwarded all the requested evidence regarding this case.</p>
<p>I want to give a complete summarization so all the facts come forward.</p>
<p>I opened an account in gamdom in 2021. After losing alot i requested a permanent ban. Where i clearly state the following:</p>
<p>« close my account forever. I want to forever selfexlude from gamdom. I also state never to play at their site again»</p>
<p>I immidialtly got a reply from samantha from gamdom clearly stating that my account is now banned. They even concluded that i should get gambling help.</p>
<p>With this request i was completely sure i was safe so i would not be able to deposit again. I have done this on all the major casinos. None of them have ever allowed me to play again.</p>
<p>Fast forward to 2023. I request to open my account with the exact same details: my email which is: U<strong>t.p</strong>*ar@gmail.com at gamdom. And after confirming that i can play to gamdom in matter of minutes my account was opened. I lost almost a total of 33000 usd.</p>
<p>I tried to solve this matter with gamdom first hand as they clearly breached the rules of selfexlusion.</p>
<p>After numerous emails back and forth we have not resolved the issue. I will also forward all the emails i have had with them back and forth.</p>
<p>The reason we are in this mess is due to gamdom completely ignoring my permanent selfexlusion. I ask casino Guro to look at the way i am selfexluding myself in the copy of my email to gamdom. I am 100% clear in my message. I am also clearly suffering from addiction and loss and ZERO enjoyment from gambling.</p>
<p>I will not make assumptions against them since they are one of the biggest online casinos but they have put forward alot of different conclusion regarding this case. I have since start got the sense that they will say anything to rest this case, respectfully gamdom.</p>
<p>At first it was due to refund policy. To that my answer was the following: We would have never talked about the refund policy if gamdom took the responsible gaming part seriously and not open a permanentely selfexluded account.</p>
<p>After that they told me that my account wasnt permanentely banned the first time. In order for me to permantely bann myself i had to request this a second time. To that my answer was the following. None of the information regarding that i had to write this a second time comes forward in the email from samantha back in 2021. Samantha clearly writes that i am banned. I mean i am writing that i selfexlude myself forever from gamdom shouldnt such a crutial information come in the email she sends to me. I mean no player in their right mind would ever think about stating the same banned email twice when support from gamdom already confirms my request.</p>
<p>They state that i accepted to open my account again with support before playing. To that my answer was the following. As one of the biggest and trusworthy casino, gamdom should have strict rules on selfexlusion to actualy establish a safe environment for their players. Clearly a problem gambler will say yes just to gamble. Thats why a permanent ban is of most importance so that mess like this doesnt happen. What i say or think should never mean anything when i requested to selfexlude forever from the casino and beeing confirmed by the casino themself that infact my account was completely banned.</p>
<p>Gamdom is clearly failing to asses the seriousity in this case. That i closed my account forever. I am clear as a day in my email to them in 2021 and i am clearly showing them that i am suffering. Their support confirms my request and tell me to seek help for gambling issues.</p>
<p>As a last note here gamdom. If you think i am some sort of guy who exploits stuff like this i can tell you first hand that in my 12 years of gambling this is my first official complaint in casino Guro. Never in my life have i ever complained about selfexlusion. I am just a gambling addict who has lost millions in many different casinos which is okey. But it is not okey when the casino has made a huge error in protecting me in regards to responsible gaming. So please get your act togheter and refund my deposits.</p>
