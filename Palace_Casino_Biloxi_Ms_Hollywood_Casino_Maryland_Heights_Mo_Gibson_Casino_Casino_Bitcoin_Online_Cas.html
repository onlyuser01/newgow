<p>The 2020-founded online casino brand owned by Videoslots, Mr Vegas, continues to expand its European presence. The online casino confirmed it secured a Sports Betting License from the Swedish Gambling Authority (SGA), Spelinspektionen. Thanks to the license, Mr Vegas can now offer sports betting services to customers in the country. The license awarded by the SGA is applicable for the next five years and marks the maximum duration for such a license in Sweden.</p>
<p>Currently, Mr Vegas offers a plethora of online gambling options. Now, with the recently secured license, the brand will diversify its offering, bringing options for sports fans and bettors alike. Dedicated to innovation, efficiency and simplicity, Mr Vegas offers sports betting within the same platform that powers Videoslots and promises exceptional experiences.</p>
<p>Although Mr Vegas remains a "casino-first brand," the addition of sports betting options seeks to boost the experiences for its growing number of customers. Ultimately, the move is expected to attract not only seasoned but recreational bettors as well. Similar to the iGaming experiences the brand offers, sports bettors can expect engaging entertainment.</p>
<p>Ulle Skottling, Videoslots' Deputy CEO, was excited about Mr Vegas' latest achievement. "We’re ambitious but realistic with our sportsbook goals. It’s a very competitive market and a complex product to develop in-house, so we’re pragmatic," he explained in a statement. Finally, Skottling pointed out: "For us, the key is to expand our offer and satisfy our loyal players."</p>
<p>Back in December, Mr Vegas' parent company, Videoslots, confirmed it extended its casino license in Sweden. At the time, the company announced that the gambling regulator in the country extended its license through 2028. This effectively enables Videoslots to continue operating in the market.</p>
<p>Initially, the company secured a license back in 2019 when Sweden first legalized iGaming and gambling. Given the license extension, Videoslots is getting closer to operating for a decade in the country.</p>
<p>Upon announcing the news, Skottling acknowledged that the license extension complements the company's growth. "We remain strong in business and compliance, and we welcome the SGA's recognition and ongoing confidence in our practices. The decision supports our plans for 2024," he explained at the time.</p>
