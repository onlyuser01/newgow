<p>UFC 274 is packed with exciting fights, especially on the main card. In addition to the two title bouts – Charles Oliveira vs Justin Gaethje and Rose Namajunas vs Carla Esparza – there are a few more that deserve your attention.</p>
<p>One of those is the Michael Chandler vs Tony Ferguson fight. Why is it so exciting? Because Bellator legend Michael Chandler is trying to prove himself in the UFC, where his record is 1-2. His opponent too is trying to improve his record – Tony Ferguson is coming off three straight losses.</p>
<p>That said, their fight at UFC 274 means the world to both fighters. The one who wins could resurrect their career. The loser? He might start thinking about retirement.</p>

<p>Is Michael Chandler Good Enough for the UFC?</p>
<p>Michael Chandler is an absolute legend of Bellator MMA, which is where he used to hold the Bellator Lightweight World Championship. He won the title on three occasions, defending the championship belt three times as well.</p>
<p>Then in 2021, he decided to move to the UFC. In his promotional debut, Chandler defeated Dan Hooker by TKO, earning himself a Performance of the Night bonus. The win, as well as his impressive Bellator portfolio, put him in the position to challenge the title.</p>
<p>It was May 2021 when he went toe to toe with Charles Oliveira in a fight for the vacant UFC Lightweight Championship. Unfortunately for Chandler, he lost the fight by TKO.</p>
<p>The same year, he got another opportunity to prove he belongs in the UFC. It was November when he fought Justin Gaethje at UFC 268. Once again, he failed. Gaethje beat him by unanimous decision.</p>
<p>Is It Time for El Cucuy Resurrection?</p>
<p>It wouldn’t be an overstatement to say Tony Ferguson is one of the legends of the UFC. In 2017, he won the UFC Lightweight Championship. However, he was later stripped of the championship belt after an injury prevented him to defend the title.</p>
<p>He made his comeback in 2018, winning against Anthony Pettis. Then, in 2019, he defeated Cowboy Cerrone. Both of those fights were crowned the Fight of the Night by the UFC.</p>
<p>Thanks to his impressive comeback, Ferguson was given another shot at the title. Unfortunately, this time he didn’t take it. Instead, Justin Gaethje defeated him by technical knockout. That’s when problems started. A series of injuries and mental issues wreaked havoc on Ferguson’s performances inside the octagon, causing him to lose another two fights – against Charles Oliveira and Beneil Dariush.</p>
<p>Michael Chandler vs Tony Ferguson Prediction</p>
<p>Oddsmakers see Chandler as a clear favorite to win this Saturday, but we think Ferguson mustn’t be underestimated. Although he’s been having all sorts of problems in recent times, El Cucuy remains one of the finest fighters in the division. That said, backing him to win at UFC 274 sure seems like an interesting proposal.</p>
<p>Pick: Tony Ferguson</p>
