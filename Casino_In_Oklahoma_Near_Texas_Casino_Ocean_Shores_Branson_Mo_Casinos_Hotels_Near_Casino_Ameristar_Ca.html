<p>Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte, North Carolina is where the Week 15 duel between the Atlanta Falcons and Carolina Panthers will take place on Sunday, December 17</p>
<p>The Atlanta Falcons vs. Carolina Panthers Week 15 game is a clash between two teams that pundits thought weren’t going to do much in the 2023 NFL season.</p>
<p>They were right about the Panthers who are 1-12 this season. However, the Falcons are doing alright with a 6-7 record and a decent chance of making the postseason. This, however, is possible only if they get back onto the winning track after losing to divisional rivals last weekend.</p>

<p>Atlanta Falcons Going for the .500 Record</p>
<p>The Atlanta Falcons are 6-7 on the season, which puts them in third place in the NFC South. Luckily for them, the two teams sitting above them in the divisional standings – the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and New Orleans Saints – have the exact same record.</p>
<p>The bottom team in the division is Carolina, which means that Atlanta’s chances of getting to the top of the NFC South would increase significantly if they won on Sunday.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for them, in their most recent game, they lost to the Bucs by just four points. They came very close to winning that game, in fact, but Tampa’s final drive of the game resulted in a touchdown.</p>
<p>But Tampa is a much better team than Carolina, which is why Atlanta’s players have every right to feel good about the upcoming weekend. This goes especially because they’ve already defeated the Panthers once in the 2023 season.</p>
<p>It happened back in September when we saw them win 24-10. It was during the time when the Falcons still had some hopes of doing alright in 2023. Their hopes are now completely gone.</p>
<p>It’s Already All Over for Carolina Panthers</p>
<p>The Panthers are 1-12 this season, with their only win happening in Week 8 when they defeated the Houston Texans 15-13. It wasn’t an impressive win, but at least, they did it at home, which is where they play this coming Sunday.</p>
<p>This, however, doesn’t mean they have the right to hope for a good result against the super-motivated Falcons. Their form has dipped significantly since that win, especially when it comes to offense. They scored fewer than 15 points in five of the six following games.</p>
<p>In their most recent game, the Panthers scored just six points – from two field goals – which is their worst offensive performance in over a year.</p>
<p>Atlanta Falcons vs. Carolina Panthers Prediction</p>
<p>Led by rookie QB Bryce Young, the Panthers just do not seem capable of scoring many points on Sunday. But what about their defense?</p>
<p>They haven’t been as bad as their offensive team, but we doubt they can stop the Falcons. Sure, they didn’t impress last weekend against the Buccaneers, but Desmond Ridder and Co. definitely seem capable of destroying the Panthers’ defense.</p>
<p>Pick: Atlanta Falcons -3 (-113)</p>
