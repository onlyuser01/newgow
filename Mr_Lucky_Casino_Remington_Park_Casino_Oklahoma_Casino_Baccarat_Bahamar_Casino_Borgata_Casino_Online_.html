    <h1>Mr Lucky Casino Remington Park Casino Oklahoma Casino Baccarat Bahamar Casino Borgata Casino Online</h1>

<p>Relax Gaming, an iGaming developer of content and supplier of unique industry-first products, is teaming up with German slot developer Apparat Gaming. As a result, the developer will be featured as part of the Powered by Relax platform, which is a unique content distribution partnership enabling Relax Gaming B2B’s customers to gain access to fresh titles.</p>
<p>Apparat Gaming to Spread Its Wings Across Europe</p>
<p>In turn, Apparat Gaming will have the opportunity to introduce its gaming products to new audiences and make sure that its product portfolio is known to players from all across Europe and beyond. Apparat Gaming has a Malta Gaming License and has launched on the market in July 2021. Presently, the company employs 15 team members and it offers what it describes as iGaming “with a German accent.”</p>
<p>The developer has unique titles such as Pharaoh Princess, 40 Sevens, Total Eclipse, and Fruit Storm. The company is also planning to introduce its products to a number of established and licensed German operators.</p>
<p>According to the press release, Apparat Gaming is planning to maintain a steadfast production pace of six new titles each month through the end of 2022. The company will get a further boost by taming up with Relax Gaming to distribute these forthcoming games as well.</p>
<p>Simon Hammon, Relax Gaming’s chief product officer, and an insider said that Apparat Gaming can expect a monumental year, citing the legalization of the German market and the potential the market holds. While some, such as Kindred Group, bowed out of Germany, others are doubling down.</p>
<p>Relax Gaming is delighted to be a part of this journey and we can’t wait to see how the relationship develops. I’m sure they’re going to be very happy with the incredible reach we’ll be able to offer them. Simon Hammon, Relax Gaming’s chief product officer</p>
<p>Bringing a German Touch to iGaming</p>
<p>Apparat Gaming co-founder &amp; director Thomas Wendt was also happy with the developments, sharing his enthusiasm about what his studio can bring to the mass iGaming market in Europe:</p>
<p>We’re confident that the games we’ve developed, as well as the ones we have just around the corner, will appeal massively to a wide player base across Europe. Apparat Gaming co-founder &amp; director Thomas Wendt</p>
<p>Germany is just a litmus test. Apparat Gaming has its sights on the entire continent, confident that its unique content paired with Relax Gaming’s distribution capabilities will make that German touch in iGaming known to all players across the continent.</p>
