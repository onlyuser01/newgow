    <h1>Casino Near Traverse City Casinos Florida Online Casino Canada Atlantic City Casino Hotels South Poi</h1>

<p>How can I ever trust a Casinoguru review? ðŸ˜€ Especially now, with such an obvious scam that is so incredibly bold and obvious at least now. Well, I can deal with the fact that my money is not paid out to me. What I can't accept is that the site can just get away with it. Isn't it possible to contact the providers of the games that their offer is being used for illegal purposes? On the one hand, this can't be good for you because it damages your reputation. And it will certainly not be in your interest from a legal point of view that brazen fraud is being carried out here?</p>
<p>Could anyone from Casinoguru, since they have much more reach, contact Push Gaming, Relax or Pragmatic Play and inform them that these sites are operated illegally? The providers in particular, who are paid for, surely have more information about the owners and operators of the homepage?</p>
<p>All I ask is that this whole disaster doesn't just end with a "poor rating". But the casino guru at least takes care that this doesn't happen again and that at least an attempt is made that the operators here are prosecuted in some way...</p>
