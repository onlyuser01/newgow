<p>There’s No Place Like Rome</p>
<p>Fans of Ancient Rome-themed games will get a fresh taste of the fallen glory of the empire which used to be the center of the world. The action is set in a sumptuous Ancient Roman arena with large and sturdy columns, fierce lions, and valuable coins hidden around every corner, ready to be grabbed.</p>
<p>The grid counts five reels, three rows, and 25 paylines and it is set up into Legion Gold to nicely alight with the winning combinations. To land a win, players must match between three and five identical symbols along a line, starting with reel number one.</p>
<p>The game counts eight regular paying symbols that are spread into four low-paying symbols and four high-paying symbols, joined by a wild symbol, a scatter, and the mouth-watering Gold Coins.</p>
<p>Players who land a line of five regular J-A royal symbols receive twice the amount of the bet. Landing five dog, horses, eagle, or bear symbols brings players 8x to 20x the stake.</p>
<p>Legionnaire armored Bearer wild symbols are found on all reels and they can land in stacks, filling up the entire reel. These symbols replace all non-special pay symbols and they carry the same value as the growling bear symbol when making a winning line on their own.</p>
<p>The multiplying Wild symbols in the game are represented by the Gold Coins while the untamed Lions are the Scatters.</p>
<p>Don’t Mess with the Roman Troops!</p>
<p>The Roman troops are not only beyond number, but they are also determined to hunt all golden coins in the new game with cool dynamics and straightforward action on the reels.</p>
<p>Players who land a minimum of three Lion scatter symbols trigger the Mega Free Spins round. When engaged in it, they can land a Mega symbol on any location on the reels. Landing six Coin symbols or a single Mega Coin symbol anywhere on the reels will activate the Gold Re-Spins.</p>
<p>Play’n GO has also included an innovative progress feature where players’ lives are counted. New players receive three lives to get started during the Gold Re-Spins. Provided no coins land during any of the re-spins, players lose a life.</p>
<p>Speaking about the new release, the company’s head of game retention George Olekszy has emphasized the fusion between the game’s narrative and its spectacular features meant to send players straight into a Roman soldiers’ march.</p>
<p>Play’n GO started the year by inking an agreement with Kindred-owned brand 32Red for the UK market, right before launching Pilgrim of Dead, an Egyptian-themed game part of the popular Dead series.</p>
