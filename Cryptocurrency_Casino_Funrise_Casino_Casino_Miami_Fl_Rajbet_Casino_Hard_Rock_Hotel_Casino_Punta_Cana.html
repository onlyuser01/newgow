    <h1>Cryptocurrency Casino Funrise Casino Casino Miami Fl Rajbet Casino Hard Rock Hotel Casino Punta Cana</h1>

<p>I submitted 3 deposits over the last few days. That is the max number i was allowed make, The first was on Dec 9th for 350€, the other tow December 11, and 12th, both for €500. I was asked for multiple documents, all of which i provided and they were all verified by about Dec 10/11. I have been in frequent contact with them about when my withdrawals would be processed, but they have kept telling me to be patient. This was frustrating for me, as i had another €1500 on my account that i also wanted to withdraw, but could not until these first withdrawals were processed.</p>
<p>So, today, the usual happened to me, I gambled away the 1500€ on my account, which is what Ohmyspins were obviously hoping would happen. I then contacted them telling them repeatedly that i had a gambling problem, i would self exclude and my 3 pending withdrawals processed. The first person i said this to told me I want allowed self exclude until my withdrawals were processed, then abruptly ended the chat. The next person, told me she would close my account but would not answer me about my withdrawals being processed and sent to me. She then closed my account abruptly leaving me not knowing where i was with regards the withdrawals. And the last person o contacted would not answer me when i asked him of my withdrawals were safe, that they would be sent to me.</p>
<p>Thats is why i am here. What do i do about this. I just want my withdrawals processed and sent to me. This feels like i am being robbed by them</p>
