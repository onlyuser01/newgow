    <h1>Fort Lauderdale Hard Rock Casino Casino Royale Vesper Lynd Four Winds Casino South Bend Photos Harra</h1>

<p>Dear Casino-Guru Team,</p>
<p>after a profit of 15,000 EUR I tried to withdraw the money. Unfortunately, the online casino makes a withdrawal as difficult as possible. I don't think this approach is fair at all.</p>
<p>Many online casinos are known to use delay tactics. Customers have to live with that now, even if that's not fair.</p>
<p>But what's particularly bad about this casino: They don't offer loss limits or gaming limits. After making my profit, I reported to the live chat and asked if it was possible to set a loss limit. The casino replied to me with:</p>
<p>[15:07] Alina: Unfortunately there is currently no way to set limits. The mechanism is under development.</p>
<p>This is not at all acceptable from my point of view and should, in my opinion, lead to the online casino being blacklisted. I've done my research by now and this online casino has many other sister casinos. So it can't be that you don't have the technology yet.</p>
<p>Since I have a gambling problem and I always gamble away my winnings without limits, this online casino is not acting responsibly at all. Responsible gaming is not an issue at all at this online casino.</p>
<p>Since I gambled away my entire winnings of 15,000 EUR, it would only be fair if the casino would at least reimburse me for my stakes (approx. 1000 EUR) out of goodwill and in terms of player protection.</p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to read my report.</p>
