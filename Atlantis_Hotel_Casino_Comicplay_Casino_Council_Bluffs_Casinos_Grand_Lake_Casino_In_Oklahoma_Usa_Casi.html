    <h1>Atlantis Hotel Casino Comicplay Casino Council Bluffs Casinos Grand Lake Casino In Oklahoma Usa Casi</h1>

<p>Recently tried some free spins and then a deposit and I win and try to withdrawal I sent in all verifications and asked about issues I continued playing with additional funds for multiple days up and down then this evening I was locked out of my account. No message ect I tried live chat and was responded with a quick casino has the discretion to close any account they wish which quickly dissapeared as well as the chat bubble. Tried to reconnect on live chat and it now only goes straight to email form. This is some of the worst service of any casino I've ever seen and now seeing all these horror stories starting to think they need to be audited or boycotted. Very unimpressed and I wont be going away without voicing my nightmare as far as I can. Will definitely not be coming back and it seems that they should</p>
<p>be pulled from certain country markets if this is the level of service they provide</p>
