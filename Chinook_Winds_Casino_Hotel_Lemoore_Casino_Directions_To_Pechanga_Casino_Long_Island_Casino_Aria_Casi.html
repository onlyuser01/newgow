    <h1>Chinook Winds Casino Hotel Lemoore Casino Directions To Pechanga Casino Long Island Casino Aria Casi</h1>

<p>I read positive reviews of exclusive on a few review sites, and I was excited to try it out. Please believe me when I say that those positive reviews are FALSE. It has taken me close to a month to withdrawal, and I have had to put up with more nonsense than at any other casino I have played at.</p>
<p>Dec 6th - I signed up for an account, and took advantage of a new player welcome bonus (I don't recall, but I believe it was 200% of first deposit). I deposited $33.50 via credit card, and began playing. I got very lucky, and hit a big bonus. I then noticed that the max withdrawal was 10x my original deposit. This is fine, since most bonuses come with such restrictions.</p>
<p>Dec 6th - I received an email noting that all new players must verify their account with a phone call, and upon doing so would receive a 100% cashback bonus of first two deposits.</p>
<p>Dec 7th - I called and verified my account over the phone. I was not given the verification bonus, and still have not received it (it is now January 2nd).</p>
<p>Dec 7th - I requested a withdrawal of $330 and received the long list of items that need to be provided to make a withdrawal. Note that while you can deposit with bitcoin on Exclusive YOU CANNOT WITHDRAWAL with bitcoin until you become a VIP player, or something along those lines. This makes no sense at all. If the casino has the ability to take deposits in bitcoin, then they have the ability to pay-out in bitcoin. For new players, bank wire is THE ONLY available withdrawal option. I would advise all players to only play at casinos that have a variety of withdrawal options. There are many very good casinos that offers bank + crypto withdrawals.</p>
<p>Dec 10th - I sent in all of the documentation required to proceed with my withdrawal. I did not hear a single thing back until December 16th. I did not even get a quick response to let me know the casino had received my documentation. The amount of personal information that Exclusive requires is high, and the very least they could have done was confirmed receipt.</p>
<p>Dec 16th - I FINALLY get a response, telling me that I need to submit three additional items of personal information to proceed. One of the items was a picture of the credit card that I had deposited with. I ALREADY PROVIDED THIS TO THEM. The second item was a picture of a voided check and the third was an additional form (some sort of credit card verification document). This was the first I had heard about #2 and #3. Why wouldn't they tell me these were needed on the first round of requirements?</p>
<p>Since I was very frustrated, I told them that I wouldn't be providing the additional information, that they could keep the money (my winnings), and that they could close my account.</p>
<p>Dec 17th - I receive an email that the documents are part of their terms and conditions (still don't know why they didn't just include them in their initial request) and that if I would like to close my account I could contact their support team</p>
<p>Dec 18th - I reply stating that I will proceed with withdrawal, and I provided the three additional personal items that they requested. I did not hear anything until I reached out on December 23rd.</p>
<p>Dec 23rd - I reached out to get a status update and let Exclusive know I was not pleased with their customer service or the length of time this was taking. They respond stating that they've received the documentation but in order to keep my account active, I would have to respond letting them know that (1) I would like to keep my account active (2) the issue is resolved (3) I authorize all purchases. This is absurd, considering I sent in my final documents AFTER stating I wanted to close my account and that included in those documents were TWO credit card authorizations forms. I responded letting them know this.</p>
<p>Dec 26th - I get ANOTHER email along the lines as the last, asking that I confirm (1) I consider the issue to be resolved (2) I have no claims against Exclusive Casino --ummm, what?--- and (3) I authorize all purchases made. I once again reply to appease them and get my withdrawal. But, this is literally ridiculous. It is clear that this company does whatever it can to stall withdrawals. I warn anyone that reads this that in many cases when casinos use tactics to delay withdrawals that are this ridiculous, it is because they don't have the money to payout winners.</p>
<p>Dec 30th - I get an email stating that my documentation has been checked and my account is ready for withdrawals. THIS IS 23 DAYS AFTER FIRST REQUESTING A WITHDRAWAL!!! I respond with a thanks, but request that my withdrawal be allowed in bitcoin since the length of time since I requested withdrawal has been unacceptable. I still have not received a response.</p>
<p>Jan 1st - I log on, and request withdrawal (for the second time). Again, bank wire is my only option. In the comment section, I once again request withdrawal in bitcoin. I am sure this will be ignored. Upon requesting withdrawal, I AM TOLD IT WILL TAKE ANOTHER 7 DAYS.</p>
