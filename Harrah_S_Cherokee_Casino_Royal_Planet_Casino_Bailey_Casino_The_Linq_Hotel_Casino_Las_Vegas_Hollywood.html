<p>Dual Play Roulette is notably the first Evolution Dual play game to be available at an MGM property in North America.

The immersive experience provided by Evolution Dual Play Roulette allows online players to get a genuine casino experience no matter where they are. Thanks to its qualities, the title was voted Best UK Table Game Product at the British Gaming Awards.</p>
<p>The new game will be available to customers of BetMGM and Borgata Online Casino in New Jersey. The launch comes ahead of Borgata Hotel Casino and Spa’s 20th anniversary. The MGM Resorts-owned brand is known for its diverse selection of gambling offerings, luxurious hospitality facilities and high-quality dining options.</p>
<p>The brand’s online division just handed a $2.4 million jackpot to a lucky customer.</p>
