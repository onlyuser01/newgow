<p>Rob Gorodetsky, a high-profile gambler who was spending thousands on sports and luxury cars was sentenced to more than two years in prison. After a federal investigation, prosecutors found that Gorodetsky was involved in a $9.6 million fraud.</p>
<p>High-Profile Gambler Sentenced over Fraud, Gets 28 Months in Prison</p>
<p>Rob Gorodetsky, once a high-profile gambler who drove expensive cars and was betting thousands on sports is now facing more than two years in prison. During a Thursday hearing in the Dirksen Federal Courthouse, Judge Elaine Bucklo sentenced the man to 28 months in prison over wire fraud.</p>
<p>Charges against the 28-year-old Gorodetsky were filed last year in January. Prosecutors accused him of scamming one investor with $9.6 million between 2014 and 2018. Once the charges were filed, it was not long before Gorodetsky pleaded guilty. With that in mind, the investor’s name was not publically revealed but the court’s filing described him as an eye doctor from New Jersey, who happened to be the father of one of Gorodetsky’s girlfriends.</p>
<p>Before hearing his sentence, Gorodetsky apologized for his actions. He said that he cannot make this right regardless of what he says or does. Although Judge Bucklo acknowledged that Gorodetsky is really young, she stressed that he was involved in a “massive, massive fraud”.</p>
<p>What Led to Gorodetsky’s Sentence?</p>
<p>Back in December 2017, USA Today posted an article describing Gorodetsky’s lifestyle as a high-profile gambler. While he was 25 at that time, the media described him as “one of the most compelling and controversial, albeit largely unknown, figures in sports“. Furthermore, USA Today even asked if “this is the future face of sports gambling?“</p>
<p>According to Chris Gair, Gorodetsky’s defense attorney, the profile which was revealed by USA Today led to the downfall of his client. Once the article was released both the FBI and the Nevada Gaming Commission have launched investigations.</p>
<p>Consequently, what federal investigators have found was wire fraud involving millions of dollars. While presenting himself as a successful market trader, Gorodetsky convinced one investor to give him more than $953,000. This happened between February and July 2014, while Gorodetsky assured the investor that the profits from the investment will be shared.</p>
<p>He then invested approximately $215,000 and used the remaining amount for personal expenditures. By July 2014, the money which he invested decreased to $72,000, but he assured the investor that the amount has grown to $2 million.</p>
<p>Additionally, Gorodetsky convinced the investor into giving him another $8.74 million which he would then use for sports wagering. This happened between July 2014 and November 2017. However, prosecutors found that Gorodetsky used more than $2.2 million of the money for entertainment, traveling as well as expensive cars, and jewelry.</p>
