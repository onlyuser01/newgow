<p>DragonFall review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Dragon eggs are the main feature of DragonFall. Each egg is beautifully designed to look shiny and Game of Thrones-like. The large grid is reminiscent a little of matching games like Candy Crush. These associations are clearly deliberate design choices, pushing it towards a blended look: a gamified fantasy land.</p>
<p>If you enjoy seeking treasures deep beneath the earth where dragons nest on hoards of loot, then this might be the game for you.</p>
<p>Win with a Wild symbol with multiplier</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>DragonFall’s graphics are excellent, a pleasant background of treasure is lit by animated dragon flames.</p>
<p>The animations are smooth and clear and work well with the pseudo-3D look that the design team settled on. The elements are all elegantly and intelligently designed.</p>
<p>The music for DragonFall owes a lot to great fantasy soundtracks filled as it is with bass drums and chanting voices. It serves perfectly to create the high-fantasy atmosphere that the setting demands.</p>
<p>Win in the base game</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>DragonFall is played on an eight by eight grid. Symbols fall from above and five or more identical symbols connected to each other vertically and/or horizontally result in a winning cluster. The more symbols there are in a winning cluster, the bigger the win.</p>
<p>There is a cascade feature in which winning symbols are removed from the board and all symbols fall down with empty spaces at the top being filled by new symbols. These cascades continue until there are no more winning combinations on the board.</p>
<p>There is also a Colossal Symbol Modifier. This modifier feature can appear at any time and expands a random symbol to take up a larger block of symbols. Wilds cannot be converted by this modifier but all other symbols can.</p>
<p>Randomly appearing feature - Colossal Symbol Modifier</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols. The Wild also pays out like a scatter symbol and three or more Wilds anywhere on the reels trigger the free spin bonus.</p>
<p>When a Wild is part of a winning cluster, instead of being removed during the cascade, the Wild simply moves to an adjacent spot on the grid then stays in place when the other symbols drop.</p>
<p>Wilds also apply the current active multiplier to any win they are part of. Once a win is calculated, the multiplier is increased by one.</p>
<p>If the player uses the Bonus Bet, the next spin is guaranteed to include at least three Wilds and will trigger the Bonus game.</p>
