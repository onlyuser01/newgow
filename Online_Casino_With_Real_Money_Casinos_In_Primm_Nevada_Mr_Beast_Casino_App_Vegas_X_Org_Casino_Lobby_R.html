<p>The launch with DraftKings is hailed as a statement of intent for NeoGames' North American ambitions</p>
<p>Provider of iLottery and iGaming solutions NeoGames SA announced today that its subsidiary, Pariplay, signed an agreement with DraftKings to launch content in New Jersey.</p>
<p>Starting in New Jersey</p>
<p>The new content deal with DraftKings will allow Pariplay to make its mark in the growing North American online casino market, starting in New Jersey and expecting to expand into Michigan and West Virginia later on.</p>
<p>“DraftKings is a brand that needs no introduction, with its massive presence across North America and global stature,” commented the president of NeoGames, Tsachi Maimon, outlining that launching content with the Boston-based operator serves as “a huge statement of intent” for Pariplay’s and its parent’s expansion plans in North America.</p>
<p>The agreement will see content developed by Wizard Games, NeoGames’ in-house casino games studio, become available for online casino players with DraftKings in the Garden State. Players will get access to the hugely popular title, Spirit of Mustang, as well as other successful games localized for the US market.</p>
<p>The launch will also include a large selection of top-performing third-party titles and content available exclusively through Pariplay in a collaboration that is set to become the latest major step made by the aggregator in North America.</p>
<p>Featuring thousands of game titles developed by industry-leading game studios, and a suite of back-office conversion and retention tools aimed at enhancing player value, Pariplay’s Fusion platform established its presence across North American markets and is now seeking to consolidate its position as the leading aggregation platform on the continent.</p>
<p>Further Expansion on the Cards</p>
<p>With licenses to provide its games in New Jersey, Michigan, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Connecticut, NeoGames is planning to expand Pariplay’s presence with DraftKings in these jurisdictions in the future, pending agreement, licensure and regulatory approval.</p>
<p>Pariplay content is already available in Michigan with BetMGM Casino after NeoGames and the online gaming brand teamed last year to bring titles such as Spirit of Mustang and Wolf Riches to players in the state.</p>
<p>Outside of North America, NeoGames continued strengthening its position in European markets such as Sweden, where it signed a distribution deal with ATG to provide the sports betting and gaming operator with its Fusion aggregation platform, Wizard Games-developed and selected third-party titles.</p>
<p>Last month, NeoGames launched its sports betting and lottery solution for the first time in Brazil, following an agreement with Intralot do Brasil signed in June last year to introduce iLottery and sports betting solutions via Intralot’s Loteria Mineira.</p>
