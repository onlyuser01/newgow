<p>3 Oaks Gaming has picked a new head of sales in the face of Krasimir Pankovski. Pankovski will step into his new position at one of the fastest-growing distributors of iGaming content, and he makes a great fit given his extensive background in the industry. Pankovski is no chance hire, and the man has been around the industry for more than 15 years now.</p>
<p>Pankovski Steps in New Position to Boost Company Reach</p>
<p>His professional path has taken him across a number of prominent companies, including Entain and PokerStars, and he has worked with GGPoker, among others. He is well-versed in every aspect of the industry as it is and has had the chance to see it evolve over the course of many years.</p>
<p>3 Oaks Gaming has been building up its offer at a rapid pace which has in turn boosted the company’s managerial needs. 3 Oaks, which is a fairly new name in the market, has been able to quickly position itself as a market leader that is capable of delivering titles at a nearly unmatched pace while attracting some of the best professionals in the industry.</p>
<p>Commenting on this new hire, 3 Oaks Gaming managing director Sebastian Damian welcomed the new opportunity and paid his compliments to Pankovski:</p>
<p>The addition of Krasimir to the 3 Oaks Gaming team is fantastic news for us and really highlights that we’re more determined than ever to make our mark on the iGaming industry. Sebastian Damian, managing director at 3 Oaks Gaming</p>
<p>Excellent and Experienced Person for the Position</p>
<p>Damian added that the team at 3 Oaks Gaming is looking forward to benefiting and learning from Pankovski’s expertise and seeing how he would help drive the company’s reach. Pankovski himself seemed happy at the opportunity:</p>
<p>I’m really excited to join 3 Oaks Gaming, and will do my utmost to build on the company’s notable growth and take our offering into new territories. Krasimir Pankovski, head of sales at 3 Oaks Gaming</p>
<p>Pankovski also paid praise to 3 Oaks Gaming’s content and assured that the company had all the markings of a great content supplier and was impressed with how fast it has been able to move forward. He is now going to help it take its product to even greater heights, the veteran concluded.</p>
<p>Speaking of distributional successes, 3 Oaks Gaming recently signed a partnership with EveryMatrix negotiating content distribution through EveryMatrix’s powerful aggregation platform, CasinoEngine.</p>
