<p>Light &amp; Wonder, Inc continues to expand its content reach through its partnership with Rush Street Interactive. The latest focus of the two companies’ efforts is the regulated Mexican market where RSI’s brand, RushBet, is already up and running. The partnership will enable Light &amp; Wonder to further help RSI streamline its content and deliver on great iGaming options.</p>
<p>Light &amp; Wonder to Power Content for RSI in Mexico</p>
<p>Part of this effort will be bolstered through the delivery of in-house and third-party games thanks to Light &amp; Wonder’s OpenGaming ecosystem. The games will be rolled on the RSI’s brand which is operated as part of a collaboration with Grupo Multimedios, the company’s local partner which helped RSI break ground in Mexico.</p>
<p>The first titles provided through the OpenGaming solutions will include Big Time Gaming’s Bonanza Megaways and Dragon Palace by Lightning Box, 888 Fortunes, and Marvelous Mouse. Another worthwhile addition is Hypernova Megaways by ReelPlay, which is the studio behind the INFINITY REELS mechanic.</p>
<p>This is yet another opportunity for local players in Mexico to experience and enjoy iGaming. Light &amp; Wonder has had success worldwide by delivering its advanced iGaming solutions. The latest entry into the Mexican market is a continuation of this business model.</p>
<p>Light &amp; Wonder LatAm commercial director Tatiana García Barrenechea welcomed the partnership and said:</p>
<p>Light &amp; Wonder is honored to enhance its partnership with RSI, a proven and respected force in the gaming industry, to take content into Mexico for the first time. Light &amp; Wonder LatAm commercial director Tatiana García Barrenechea</p>
<p>Barrenechea added that this expansion was focused on one of the most important markets in the Latin American markets and that it was an important opportunity for the company as it seeks to establish itself as a leading aggregator and supplier of iGaming solutions in this particular region.</p>
<p>Through the powerful localization of popular titles, Light &amp; Wonder believes that it has a strong claim on the LatAm market, and this is evident by its most recent partnership with RSI for the region.</p>
<p>RSI Confident in This New Content Partnership</p>
<p>RSI CEO Richard Schwartz welcomed the addition of Light &amp; Wonder content and praised the company as a global leader in the delivery of such solutions. He added:</p>
<p>We are excited to be able to bring top-class, highly popular casino games to players in Mexico and we look forward to further expanding the catalogue of games for players in the country in the coming months. RSI CEO Richard Schwartz</p>
<p>RSI is committed to gradually expanding its own clout in the Latin American market which dovetails nicely with Light &amp; Wonder’s own stated goals, giving both companies a firm standing in the market.</p>
