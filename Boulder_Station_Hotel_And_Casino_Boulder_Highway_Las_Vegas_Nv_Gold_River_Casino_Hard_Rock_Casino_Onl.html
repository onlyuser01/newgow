<p>As sports betting in New York is picking up a lot of momentum, advertisement has become another hot button for stakeholders. Thankfully, Google has updated its US Gambling and Games advertisement rules to offer guidance at a time when marketers are eager to push their clients’ brands in the newly fledged betting market in the Empire State.</p>
<p>Quick Amendments to Google’s Advertisement Guidance</p>
<p>As a result of the change introduced by the search engine and tech company, agencies can now promote sportsbooks products in New York legally and do so in compliance with clear-cut rules set out by the company and in line with the statures put down by the New York Gaming Commission.</p>
<p>Google had updated the rules on January 7 ahead of the Saturday launch last weekend. Clarifying the rules, Google explained that the Google Ads Gambling and Games policy rules came into effect on January 8 for New York.</p>
<p>However, the ads that appear must come from certified partners, which are licensed to run their business legally in the Empire State. So far, there are nine entities, only four of which have launched.</p>
<p>Google already has a process in place that allows licensed operators to start pushing their marketing campaigns in a bid to secure a greater share of the market. The four entities operating on the market include Caesars, BetRivers, DraftKings, and FanDuel.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Bally’s, BetMGM, PointsBet, and WynnBET are still not certified partners as they are pending launch. Google has been particular about the way it regulates gambling advertisements in the United States.</p>
<p>Tech Giants Face Criticism over Gambling Ads on the Internet</p>
<p>The tech giant has chosen a “rolling basis” approach whereby it enables such advertisement in states where specific gambling activity is regulated. Twitter, on the other hand, allows advertisers to push more aggressively on its platform, although all gambling ads must include a disclaimer.</p>
<p>Facebook issues “written permission” to advertisers who want to promote their gambling ads on the platform, although, the social media giant has been criticized for offering some of the most unsatisfactory screening.</p>
<p>All three tech companies have come under scrutiny and criticism at one point or another over permitting gambling advertisement. Facebook was recently named in a lawsuit that alleges “illegal gambling conspiracy.”</p>
<p>Google, in the meantime, has played close to the chest, following developments on a state-by-state basis. When Florida reversed its permission on sports betting in the state, Google acted quickly and suspended all advertisements related to this activity.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the company has challenged local authorities. In one such case, Google managed to strike down a penalty issued to the search engine in Italy, with the company’s arguments standing in court.</p>
