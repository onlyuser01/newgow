<p>Wild Falls review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Coming some forty years after the California gold rush, the Klondike gold rush had a very different feel. In the mid-1890s, swarms of prospectors ventured into the inhospitable north of the Yukon with equipment to pan the icy rivers for gold.</p>
<p>Wild Falls adapts this setting, placing the reels on a Canadienne waterfall and, perhaps a little abstractly, boxing the water bourne gold into wooden chests which fall onto the reels from the river above.</p>
<p>The theme makes for a pretty setting and is a nice change from the many gold rush style games that take you underground into mines.</p>
<p>Win with 4 top paying symbols</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>Play'n GO is one of those sites that puts a lot of effort into their slot’s front end, so naturally, Wild Falls is lovely to look at. The symbols are done in a clear, thematically unified style, and have every bit as much character as the background into which they are integrated.</p>
<p>The animations are complementary to the style as is the music which is a nice little banjo track that kicks up a gear whenever something exciting happens.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Wild Falls has a five reel, three row base game with twenty win lines and four bonus features (see below for details).</p>
<p>Some of the bonuses are integrated into the main gameplay offering a welcome change of pace and keeping the gameplay fresh and exciting.</p>
<p>While breaking no new ground, Wild Falls is an example of a slot that does all the basics well.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol, substitutes for all symbols and acts as the Scatter symbol. Rather than being a part of the spinning reels, Wild Falls has a gimmick where Wilds – in the form of treasure chests – drift down the river in the background, over the waterfall and come crashing down into place on the reels from above.</p>
<p>Any time one or two Wilds land on the reel, it triggers a Rapid Respin feature. Wilds are held in place while the respins occur. If no new Wilds land, the respins end.</p>
<p>Rapid Respins - base game feature with chests as sticky Wilds</p>
<p>If you get three Wilds on the reels either in one spin or during a respin, the River of Gold feature is triggered. When this occurs, respins are triggered. Instead, the current Wild’s move down one space between each respin until all the Wilds have dropped off the bottom of the reels. New Wilds can still land on the reels extending this bonus.</p>
<p>Free spins bonus - River of Gold</p>
<p>Gold Rush is a random feature which adds multipliers of 2x, 3x or 5x to all chests. Additionally if you trigger the River of Gold with three Gold Rush chests you can trigger the Super River of Gold in which the multipliers remain in place. This is where the really big wins can occur.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.50%, which is a little bit higher than the average we use of 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested had a minimum level of $/£/€0.20 per spin. At the other end, the maximum bet per spin was a decent sized $/£/€100.00. This is a pretty decent range, though micro players might be better looking for something with a little more granularity in the pennies range.</p>
<p>The volatility of Wild Falls is as high as the Rocky Mountains that watch over the game. This is great news as it makes Wild Falls an excellent match for our preferred strategies.</p>
<p>Top symbols paytable and winlines configuration</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Wild Falls is a good looking slot with plenty going for it under the hood.</p>
<p>The main draw for us is the RTP which comes in above our cut-off of 96% and the high volatility which goes great with our preferred strategies.</p>
<p>On top of this, however, Wild Falls is a really great gaming experience with visuals, music and gameplay that works together to make a great slot. All adding up to a strong recommendation from us.</p>
