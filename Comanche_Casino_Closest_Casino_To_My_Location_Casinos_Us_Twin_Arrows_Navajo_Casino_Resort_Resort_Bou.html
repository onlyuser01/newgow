<p>The betting and gaming industry leader reaffirmed its dominating position in its home Polish market, maintaining its impressive 2023 momentum</p>
<p>STS Group’s H1 trading results revealed a remarkable increase in net gaming revenue and impressive growth across most metrics. These stellar financial results underscore the company’s potential ahead of the upcoming Entain acquisition as the gambling giant focuses on the Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) region. The deal should significantly bolster STS’ growth potential and help it establish itself as a regional leader.</p>
<p>The Operator Still Has Untapped Potential</p>
<p>According to STS’ official H1 financial results, net gaming revenue skyrocketed by 17%, rising from PLN 296 million ($68.98 million) to PLN 346 million ($80.63 million). Robust performance across most verticals resulted in group-wide revenue reaching PLN 299 million (69.70 million), up 14% year-on-year. These metrics maintain the company’s previous trends, indicating further growth potential.</p>
<p>Net profit rose significantly compared to H1 2022, settling at PLN 97 million ($22.65 million) for a 57% increase. Adjusted EBITDA didn’t lag far behind, exceeding last year’s results by 35% for PLN 157 million ($36.67 million). STS Holdings president of the Management Board Mateusz Juroszek was content with the results, hoping for further growth.</p>
<p>We assume that in the second half of the year, the activity of our players will be higher, which should have a positive impact on our operational and financial indicators. Mateusz Juroszek, STS Holdings president of the Management Board</p>
<p>Other metrics saw STS’ betting handle reach PLN 2.3 billion ($536.96 million), a 5% increase from 2022. H1 active users settled at 412,000 with 109,000 new registrations and 72,000 first-time depositors. These figures indicate robust player onboarding and retention as the operator continuously updates its catalog of titles to maintain engagement.</p>
<p>Strategic Decisions Yielded a Positive Change</p>
<p>H1 marked significant business developments for STS Group. The company strategically shifted its focus to concentrate on the core Polish market while discontinuing its overseas activities in the United Kingdom and Estonia. This strategic move allowed STS Group to fully harness the potential of its home region, where it has firmly established itself as the clear market leader.</p>
<p>STS Group’s impressive financials set the stage for an exciting transformation. The company is currently in the process of integrating into the Entain portfolio of brands. This move marks a significant milestone for STS as it aligns with one of the industry’s leading players. Juroszek noted that the two companies shared a common ambition and vision for the future and would fully leverage their shared values.</p>
<p>The publication of STS Group’s H1 trading results underscores the operator’s commitment to excellence and innovation in the betting and gaming industry. With its strong market position in Poland and its strategic alignment with Entain, STS Group is well-positioned for a bright future of growth, expansion, and continued success in its home region and beyond.</p>
