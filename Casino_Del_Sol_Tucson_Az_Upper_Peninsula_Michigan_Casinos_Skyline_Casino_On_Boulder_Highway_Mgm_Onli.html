    <h1>Casino Del Sol Tucson Az Upper Peninsula Michigan Casinos Skyline Casino On Boulder Highway Mgm Onli</h1>

<p>The new partner is Mancala Gaming, an up-and-coming studio, and developer of compelling titles built to appeal to new audiences and boost engagement across iGaming for partner operators.</p>
<p>Mancala Gaming Sets to Conquer Global Markets with Pariplay</p>
<p>Thanks to this integration, Mancala Gaming will now have the opportunity to distribute its titles across Pariplay’s network of partners which are focused on injecting frequent content updates from Fusion.</p>
<p>Mancala brings many worthwhile options to the fore, including Candy Clash, Fruit Collector, Séance: Mysterious Attic, and so many others. Players are treated to a true variety of titles that are built with a specific emphasis on appealing to Generation Y and Millennial players, thus breaking the iGaming mold and introducing new experiences and concepts globally.</p>
<p>This global ambition will now be further realized with Fusion’s help which will empower Mancala’s reach in new markets and existing key jurisdictions. Pariplay director of partnership Callum Harris hailed the opportunity to add fresh games as the company seeks to expand on the 80+ suppliers and 14,000 titles already present in its portfolio. Harris added:</p>
<p>Mancala Gaming’s offering certainly fits the bill, with its portfolio of titles that have a proven appeal to demographics our operator partners might find harder to reach. Pariplay director of partnership Callum Harris</p>
<p>He welcomed the opportunity to be signing with the studio and confirmed that Pariplay was very much excited about what the future held. Mancala Gaming CCO Emiliano Sanchez was equally stoked to have the opportunity to see his company’s products launch with Fusion and Pariplay.</p>
<p>Pariplay and Mancala Confident in Common Success</p>
<p>He welcomed the opportunity to provide what he described as quality content to Pariplay and added that operators and their players are set to benefit from outstanding games. Through this tie-up with an industry-leading aggregation platform, Mancala Gaming is capable of reaching new player bases and consolidating its presence in existing ones.</p>
<p>“We are excited to see how our player-first slots content appeals to players at Pariplay’s operator partners all over the world,” Sanchez concluded. Pariplay has signed a string of similar partnerships in the meantime.</p>
<p>The company has grown its platform offering with Kirion earlier in January. Pariplay also set out to conquer global markets with Resorts Digital in New Jersey.</p>
