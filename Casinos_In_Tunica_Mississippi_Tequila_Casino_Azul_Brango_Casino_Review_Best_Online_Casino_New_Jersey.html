<p>Caesars Offers ‘Transformational Value’, Sports Betting Spinoff Possible Before Year End</p>

<p>Caesars Entertainment (NASDAQ:CZR) is likely in advanced talks with William Hill (OTC: WIMHY) on a joint venture that would see the operators spin off a combined online casinos and sports wagering business, perhaps as soon as this year, according to an analyst.</p>

<p>Roth Capital analyst David Bain says the two companies have been in talks for “some time” on a 50/50 partnership that would combine Caesars’ iGaming and sports betting segments with William Hill USA. The Caesars Palace operator already owns 20 percent of the British bookmaker’s US operations.</p>
<p>Checks cite negotiations for ownership structure/splits are in advanced stages, with a mindset of a likely spin off before the end of this year,” said Bain a note to clients. “Of course, there are risks to the time line, including delays in the final throes of talks and overall market conditions.”</p>
<p>The analyst adds that even if the transaction is pushed out to the first quarter of 2021, that time would still beat investor expectations and be a “transformational catalyst.”</p>
<p>Bain rates shares of Caesars “buy” and has a $75 price target on the name, implying upside of about 33 percent from where it currently trades.</p>
<p>Unlocking Caesars’ Big Value</p>
<p>Talk of Caesars separating its online gaming and sports betting segments dates back more than a year. Soon after revealing a takeover offer for Caesars, then Eldorado Resorts CEO Tom Reeg noted a spin-off of those units was possible because markets didn’t fully appreciate those businesses, and such a move would unlock shareholder value.</p>
<p>Reeg now runs the “new Caesars.” On the combined company’s first earnings conference call last month, he said a decision on the fate of the iGaming and sports wagering units could be announced before the end of 2020.</p>
<p>This idea of a joint transaction with William Hill is gaining momentum for multiple reasons, including the UK-based company running all of Caesars’ domestic sportsbooks, it’s status as the third-largest player in the fast-growing US online sports wagering market, and the notion that the investment community doesn’t adequately value William Hill’s US business.</p>
<p>Bain, the Roth Capital analyst, believes a separation of Caesars’ online casino and sports betting units is worth $38 a share, and internet gaming alone is compelling for investors because, in a more equal partnership, William Hill could profitably leverage the more than 65 million Caesars Rewards members, potentially converting some of them into online customers.</p>
<p>Fantastic Earnings Forecast</p>
<p>Bain projects a total addressable market (TAM) of $9 billion for US sports betting and $4 billion for iGaming in 2025. The analyst acknowledges that market share and valuation discount assumptions for Caesars in these arenas relative to rival DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) “could prove conservative.”</p>
<p>Excluding a spin-off, the analyst says Caesars stock is worth $73, citing better-than-expected business trends and strength in the company’s regional portfolio.</p>
<p>“We forecast 3Q20 regional earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and restructuring or rent costs (EBITDAR) at $397 million versus consensus of $372 million, and Las Vegas at $66 million versus $76 million consensus,” said Bain.</p>
<p>He says Caesars’ ability to outperform peers in the current quarter is being driven by consistent customer demand and cost-cutting initiatives, as well as Total Rewards members driving Las Vegas occupancy rates higher compared to other Strip operators.</p>
