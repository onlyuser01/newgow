<p>PragmaticPlay, an established casino supplier across multiple verticals, including slots, virtual sports, and live casino content, has struck a new partnership with ComeOn Group that will now see the studio deliver its Live Casino solutions to ComeOn.nl in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>The partnership is part of a multi-faceted arrangement that will see Pragmatic Play strengthen its presence in the prominent market while ComeOn’s local brand continues to gain momentum by bringing local players fresh and worthwhile experiences. The Dutch iGaming market has been of particular significance to both companies.</p>
<p>This arrangement features the Chroma Blackjack solution which is now live with ComeOn.nl and which also features a branded Dutch-language table that will add to the distinctiveness of the offer and allow the operator to secure an even stronger foothold in the highly-competitive local market.</p>
<p>The Chroma solution is designed in a way to allow for better customization that is tailored to the needs of partner operators and specific audiences. This way, Pragmatic Play can offer more differentiation to each of its partner casinos and allow them to build products that are crafted specifically to meet their customer bases and regional preferences.</p>
<p>This partnership has elicited responses from Pragmatic Play COO Irina Cornides who welcome the opportunity to see the company’s product live with yet another brand in the market and in such a distinct manner.</p>
<p>"We’re delighted to build on an already strong partnership with ComeOn to include a branded Dutch-language Blackjack offering for their players in the Netherlands," Cornides said. This partnership was also welcomed by ComeOn.nl CPO Cristiano Blanco who was similarly pleased with the opportunity and delighted to add a unique live dealer experience that was a dedicated Dutch-language Blackjack experience.</p>
<p>Blanco spoke highly about the Chroma solution and the value that it added to brands, and Dutch audiences in particular. It’s a safe and protected environment for people to enjoy their favorite games safely and reliably.</p>
<p>"We look forward to continuing our collaboration with Pragmatic Play and seeing the positive results of the Chroma solution," Blanco assured. Pragmatic Play has in the meantime expanded its presence internationally, with the supplier growing its regional print in North and South America as well as Europe.</p>
<p>In the Latin American region in particular, the company teamed up with Brazilian iGaming operator Vem Betar and Mexican operator Vivelo24.</p>
