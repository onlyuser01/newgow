<p>The latest deal marked the entry of RubyPlay into the United States and its first endeavor within the social casino sector</p>
<p>The innovative business-to-business (B2B) iGaming content developer, RubyPlay, announced a new important partnership Wednesday. The company confirmed it entered the United States for the first time, thanks to a new content distribution deal with the fast-growing social gaming operator, Yellow Social Interactive (YSI). In addition to entering the US, the latest collaboration marked an important milestone for RubyPlay as it represented its foray into the social gaming vertical.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the new collaboration, the iGaming content supplier agreed to deliver more than half of its engaging portfolio, powering YSI’s operations in different US states. The new deal saw RubyPlay and YSI collaborate for the optimization of the iGaming provider’s games to a social setting. This included changes related to the look and feel of each game, making it suitable for the social casino vertical.</p>
<p>As a result of the collaboration, YSI customers will be able to tap into thrilling social games that offer two different types of in-game currency, Sweepstakes Coins and Gold Coins. Those games offer risk-free gaming entertainment but at the same time, grant a chance for further engaging and exciting experiences via redeemable real-world prizes.</p>
<p>Dr Eyal Loz, RubyPlay’s CPO, revealed that the company is delighted to join forces with YSI for this exciting deal. “This partnership not only marks our first entry into the US, but also underscores our commitment to delivering innovative, responsible and engaging gaming experiences,” he added. Finally, Dr Loz said that RubyPlay was focused on adapting its content to the social vertical and it is looking forward to providing engaging social casino experiences.</p>
<p>“We are absolutely thrilled to embark on this exciting journey with Yellow Social Interactive.“ Dr Eyal Loz, CPO at RubyPlay</p>
<p>Yellow Social Interactive Plans Further Growth</p>
<p>Currently, YSI is popular as a fast-growing operator within the social gaming vertical. It has the ambition to become a leader within the iGaming sector, offering unrivaled entertainment. Undoubtedly, the new deal with RubyPlay will further complement that goal, especially considering that the iGaming provider anticipates expanding its presence across the US.</p>
<p>Recently, RubyPlay expanded once again the reach of its games by inking a partnership with REEVO. Announced back in August, the collaboration saw more than 80 engaging games from the provider become a part of REEVO’s aggregation platform. This enabled the iGaming content provider to reach new players and deliver unrivaled experiences.</p>
