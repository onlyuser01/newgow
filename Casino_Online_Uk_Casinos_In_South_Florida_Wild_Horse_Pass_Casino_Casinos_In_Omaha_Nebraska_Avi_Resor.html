<p>The leading technology solutions provider, empowering the online gaming and sports betting industry, Continent 8 Technologies, announced its plans to open a new Curacao data center. Confirmation about the plan came Tuesday with the company confirming that it will open the data center at some point this month, expanding its global footprint further.</p>
<p>Labeled as a strategic site expansion, the initiative comes at a time when the Curacao Gaming Control Board, the gambling regulator for the island, is implementing a transformative change for the gambling market. The complex process includes revision of its license procedure applicable for iGaming operators in the region.</p>
<p>Thanks to the new Continent 8 Technologies Curacao data center, operators across different jurisdictions would be able to benefit from the company's range of solutions and services. Both new and existing operators will be able to tap into Continent 8's best-in-class managed hosting solutions, cybersecurity features, as well as its unique network of more than 100 locations within four continents.</p>
<p>Nick Nally, Continent 8 Technologies' Chief Revenue Officer, commented on the topic in a statement, explaining that the company is proud to deliver fast, effective and reliable solutions to its growing number of partners. "We realized an opportunity and we had to move fast to ensure operators have the very best hosting solutions," he added. Finally, Nally pointed out: "With the changes being made in Curaçao with regards to online gambling licenses, strengthening the application process to attract a wider range of operators, those looking to seek a license can be assured that they can capitalize on leading services and solutions from Continent 8."</p>
<p>Michael Tobin, Continent 8 Technologies' Founder and Chief Executive Officer, shared Nally's excitement and explained that the company has been providing compliant hosting solutions around the globe for regulated gambling markets in the last 25 years. "Thanks to our experience, regulatory knowledge, and market-leading solutions, we have become the trusted infrastructure partner to the industry," he added. Finally, Tobin said: "Our move into Curaçao comes at a time when operators and suppliers need infrastructure solutions they can rely on, and this is exactly what we have built our name and reputation on."</p>
<p>The latest strategic initiative complements the company's growth in important regions such as Latin America and the Caribbean. Currently, Continent 8 Technologies has four open sites for those regions. Yet, the company hinted at plans for further expansion next year with the opening of more locations.</p>
