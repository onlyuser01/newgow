<p>The provider of unique games, powering the online gambling industry, 7777 gaming, announced a new partnership, allowing it to significantly expand its reach in two important jurisdictions. The company announced Monday it joined forces with the recognizable and trusted iGaming operator, NetBet. Under the terms of the freshly minted content agreement, 7777 gaming agreed to supply a portfolio of its games, powering the operator's offering into two strategic markets.</p>
<p>Per the new deal, NetBet's operations in Malta under the Malta Gaming Authority (MGA), will benefit from more than 40 certified games from 7777 gaming. Those games would become available to NetBet.com, expanding the operator's offering and promising to deliver unique online gambling experiences.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the latest collaboration sees 7777 gaming propel its presence in Mexico, a strategic market for the Latin American region. Thanks to the deal with 7777 gaming, NetBet's clients on NetBet.mx will be able to tap into a wide range of casino games from the leading iGaming content supplier.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, the new collaboration helps strengthen 7777 gaming's global footprint. In Mexico, NetBet's customers can engage with some of the provider's fan-favorite and top-performing games that have already proven their popularity in other markets across the globe. Similarly, through NetBet.com, 7777 gaming titles such as Zeus, Sea of Treasure, Club Mr. Luck and Cash 100, among others, would be able to reach new customers.</p>
<p>Elena Shaterova, 7777 gaming's CCO, commented on the topic in a statement released on November 6, 2023. "We are thrilled to go live with NetBet in their operations under the MGA jurisdiction and in Mexico, further expanding our reach with this world-class operator," she explained.</p>
<p>According to Shaterova, the latest collaboration reaffirms 7777 gaming's dedication to delivering unrivaled experiences to iGaming customers across the globe. Finally, she said: "After commencing our collaboration with NetBet in Romania earlier this year, we are confident the players will be delighted by the quality and variety of our offerings in the MGA jurisdiction and the Mexican market as well."</p>
<p>The deal with NetBet comes on the heels of another partnership announced by 7777 gaming recently. Late last month, the company confirmed it joined forces with Magicbet, a leading operator in the regulated gambling sector in Bulgaria.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the new agreement, 7777 gaming agreed to supply more than 100 games that are approved and certified in the country, powering the offering of the operator. Similarly, to the most recent agreement, the deal with Magicbet helped propel the reach of the iGaming provider's engaging portfolio of casino games.</p>
