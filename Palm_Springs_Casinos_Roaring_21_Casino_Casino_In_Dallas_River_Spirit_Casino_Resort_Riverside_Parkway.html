<p>Livespins, an innovative livestreaming gaming service that allows players to bet behind their favorite streamer or brand ambassador, has further diversified its content library thanks to a deal with 4ThePlayer. The latter company is a beloved developer of iGaming titles whose products will be integrated into Livespins’ product.</p>
<p>Under the agreement, Livespins’ streamers will be able to use 4ThePlayer’s games in their streams, allowing audiences to re-experience the studio’s titles. The streaming product adds a social element to online casino gaming, allowing players to bet behind streamers and discuss each spin in a live chatroom.</p>
<p>Livespins allows each player to select their own bet value and number of spins. In addition, the aforementioned chatroom comes packed with emojis and reactions, further reinforcing the shared experience.</p>
<p>Some of 4ThePlayer’s slots that will be available to Livespins’ streamers and players include hits such as 5 Doggy Dollars, 9K Kong in Vegas and 4 Secret Pyramids, among others. The games sport innovative mechanics that are sure to engage Livespins’ customers.</p>
<p>4ThePlayer is a disruptive gaming brand founded by a team of iGaming experts. Thanks to the agreement with Livespins, 4ThePlayer will join a list of partners that includes many notable suppliers, such as iSoftBet, REEVO, Relax Gaming, Wazdan and Yggdrasil.</p>
<p>4ThePlayer’s games are available in many markets, including in Michigan where the supplier recently secured a license.</p>
<p>The Deal Will Strengthen the Two Companies</p>
<p>Henry McLean, 4ThePlayer’s co-founder and commercial &amp; marketing director, commented on the new deal. He noted that live streaming is a phenomenon that is taking iGaming by storm. Because of that, his team is happy to join forces with Livespins and capitalize on the trends in a safe and responsible way.</p>
<p>Everything we do is about delivering the best player experience – so much so, it’s in our name – and we can’t wait to see Livespins’ streamers fire up the reels on our suite of slots and showcase them to players who can also join in by betting behind the action. Henry McLean, co-founder and commercial &amp; marketing director, 4ThePlayer</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Livespins’ chief commercial officer, Michael Pedersen, said that his company is committed to providing innovative experiences to players. In addition to that, Livespins provides a new format for studios to showcase their games.</p>
<p>Pedersen praised 4ThePlayer as a studio that exceeds expectations. He added that the new partnership is sure to channel more players toward 4ThePlayer’s games.</p>
<p>The studio has quickly made a name for itself by developing slots that not only meet but exceed player expectations, and our streamers will now be able to leverage this phenomenal gameplay to level up their broadcasts and create thrilling, action-packed broadcasts that also introduce 4ThePlayer to a much bigger audience than ever before.
