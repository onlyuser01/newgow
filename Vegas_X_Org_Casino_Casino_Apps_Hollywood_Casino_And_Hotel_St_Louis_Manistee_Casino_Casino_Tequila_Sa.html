<p>Salzburg vs Bayern Munich is going to be the first match in the Champions League playoffs for the Austrian side. Salzburg got to Round of 16 after finishing second in their group. As a result, the Red Bulls now have to take on a team that finished in the top spot in its group. The team in question is German heavyweight Bayern Munich.</p>
<p>Oddsmakers think of Bayern as the #2 favorite to win the 2021-22 Champions League, with the odds of +375. That said, they don’t think Salzburg will be able to stop Bayern from advancing forward. Still, even though the German team is worth four times as much as Salzburg, the Austrians do have some aces up their sleeves. Let’s see if they can use them to get a good result on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Attack is the Best Defense for Salzburg</p>
<p>Salzburg is a team that failed to score in only two games in 2021. Further, Salzburg is without a single home loss in almost a year. As Wednesday’s game is played at Red Bull Arena in Salzburg, it’s safe to say that Salzburg players are planning to go all-in on the offense.</p>
<p>They will have the support of their fans to do so. According to the club, all tickets for the Champions League clash with Bayern have been sold days ago. What this means is that a big majority of 31,895 fans at Salzburg’s stadium will be rooting for the home team.</p>
<p>Knowing all this, it’s evident that Salzburg has the motivation to score as many goals as possible. But do these guys have the quality to do so? Well, they did score against Bayern in both of their previous two Champions League meetings.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for them, they also conceded a lot of goals. The games finished 6-2 and 3-1 in Bayern’s favor.</p>
<p>Neuer is Out for Bayern Munich</p>
<p>Bayern’s goalie Manuel Neuer will miss Wednesday’s game due to an injury. He also missed Bayern’s last Bundesliga game. Played last Saturday, the game saw Bochum score four goals against the German champ, who had Sven Ulreich between the posts.</p>
<p>It was Ulreich’s second game of the year. The first one was also a failure. A few weeks ago, he played as Bayern’s goalie against Borussia Monchengladbach and his team lost 2-1.</p>
<p>On the bright side for Bayern, all of their key forwards are fit and ready for the match. This includes Bayern’s best player, Robert Lewandowski. The Polish striker has been in sensational form this year, scoring seven goals in the five games he’s played in 2022.</p>
<p>With him on the pitch, Bayern will be able to fight back even if Salzburg’s attackers manage to score a goal or two.</p>
<p>Picks: Bayern Munich to Win; Over 3.5 Goals</p>
