<p>Game of Thrones Review</p>
<p>Theme and Story Line</p>
<p>"In the Game of Thrones, you either win or you die," says Cersei Lannister early on in HBO’s hit TV show. The downside for losing at the Game of Throne slot machine is less severe. However, it is still a pretty tough game to beat.</p>
<p>Using the iconography created for the TV series, the Game of Thrones slot uses the warring of the major houses of Westeros as its central theme with the choice to pick a house during bonus rounds to affect your possible winning combos.</p>
<p>If you’re a fan of the TV show or books this might be the slot for you. If you can’t tell your Baratheons from your Lannisters, don’t worry, most of the characters can’t either.</p>

<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>Using the art created for the show this slot is pretty gorgeous to look at, with great attention paid to the details (even the font is classy).</p>
<p>Ramin Djawadi’s fantastic theme tune for the TV series plays on a loop as you go. If you do get tired of it, you can mute the music, but why would you?</p>
<p>The animations are nicely designed, especially the maps and coins in the gamble feature. And the reels are smooth and high definition.</p>
<p>All in all, it is one of the nicest looking slots we’ve played in a long time.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>The central gameplay is a standard five reel, 243 way win where symbols must appear in any location in neighbouring reels to win. The first symbol must be on the first reel.</p>
<p>To this is added a gambling feature that allows you to flip a coin up to four times playing double or nothing each time. Each time you win, you move further down the map. It should be noted that this will not affect your RTP, but the more you gamble the higher your variance.</p>
<p>There is also an opportunity to pick your bonus should you hit it (see below for the details of the bonus games).</p>
<p>These features add a nice variation to the pace of the game.</p>

<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Game of Thrones game has two special symbols in addition to the standard Ace to Jack and the four main houses: Targaryen, Stark, Lannister and Baratheon.</p>
<p>The first of these symbols is the Wild symbol. This has the Game of Thrones logo on and is stacked so when you hit with it you often hit multiple winlines at once.</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols, except for the Bonus symbol, which is an image of the Iron Throne. This has a couple of rules associated with it. First of all, it plays as a scatter symbol. If you hit just two, you receive a randomly determined cash prize. In our test play we've encountered a win of the bet amount or the bet multiplied by 2 or 3.</p>
<p>If you hit more than two bonus symbols, there is a payout on it as a scatter symbol and in addition to this, the bonus round is triggered. In the bonus round you are given the option of four different houses. You can choose fewer spins with a higher multiplier and a small stack of higher value symbols or you can get more free spins with a lower multiplier and larger stacks of lower value symbols.</p>

<p>Once you’ve picked your bonus the free spins begin. You can retrigger further spins during the bonus round allowing for some massive wins when they do arrive.</p>

<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The bet sizes are surprisingly limited on this game with a choice of two coin sizes and between 1 and 10 coins.</p>
<p>Reports of the RTP vary from 95.01% to 95.5% which may be the result of the different choices of bonus.</p>
<p>The variance on this game is very high though, so expect long periods of watching your coins slowly deplete with the occasional big win.</p>

<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>This is a good looking slot machine from Microgaming with a fun gamble feature and an interesting choice mechanic for its bonus.</p>
<p>The RTP is a little below the industry average, but we like the high variance.</p>
<p>Overall it is an excellent gambling experience.</p>
