<p>Michigan State is seeing part of its casino properties lower their gambling age to 18 starting today. All five Kewadin Casinos properties based in the Great Lakes State are going to allow younger individuals to enter their tribal properties and participate in a range of experiences, including slots and table games.</p>
<p>Kewadin Casinos Reduce Gambling Age to 18</p>
<p>The gambling age has been a controversial topic for many with states mostly split on at what point casinos become viable to individuals. The consensus is 21 but it’s slowly being tackled in favor of business decisions and a growing need for younger generations to be introduced to the industry.</p>
<p>Commenting on this decision, the Sault Tribe of Chippewa Indians explained that the option has always existed for the properties to lower the gambling age to 18. The tribe decided to act now though. Kewadin Casinos CEO Allen Kerridge said:</p>
<p>“The decision to now lower the gaming age limit to 18 is a decision that gives all legal adults access to our gaming properties. Currently, several of Michigan’s tribal casinos allow legal adults to gamble at their casinos and this change will allow us to be consistent and competitive with those casinos.” Kewadin Casinos CEO Allen Kerridge</p>
<p>Previously, the age was 19. Even though admittance on-site is allowed for gamblers aged at least 18, the tribe has no remit to change the gambling age that regulates online casino and sports betting, which is set at 21 years of age by the Michigan Gaming Control Board and will remain intact.</p>
<p>Underage Gambling a Threat But Not a Problem</p>
<p>However, there are other issues that would need to be addressed, but the Kewadin Casinos already have experience with this. Underage drinking was long considered a real danger, but Kewadin Casinos managed to handle their 19 customers safe and away from alcoholic beverages. The same caution will be exercised in the case of those who are 18 and visit the casino to gamble.</p>
<p>All Kewadin employees, and especially the bartenders, are trained under a TIPS system that allows them to spot potential underage drinkers. In addition, all patrons must undergo a verification check at the entrance, and those aged 21 or younger are tracked on the casino floor to ensure that no underage drinking takes place there.</p>
<p>Kewadin Casinos run several properties with combined 2,000 slots, 25 table games, various amenities and dining experiences, hotels, and more.</p>
