<p>NASCAR and BetMGM signed a multi-year partnership yesterday.</p>
<p>A Multi-Year Partnership between NASCAR and BetMGM</p>
<p>Tuesday, August 11, the sports betting leader BetMGM and NASCAR announced a key partnership. Under the multi-year partnership, BetMGM becomes an Authorized Gaming Operator of NASCAR. Moreover, BetMGM will be allowed to create and promote NASCAR sports betting experiences available for racing fans across the U.S. market. The partnership allows BetMGM to offer pre-game sports betting as well as live sports betting experiences.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as a part of the agreement, BetMGM will have rights to NASCAR marks and promote NASCAR on its mobile application, retail sports books, website as well as social media channels.

<p>BetMGM also set a plan to expand its bet types throughout the NASCAR season. Among the currently explored options we find driver matchups, top-finishing drivers, stage winners as well as bets tied to the number of the winning car and others.</p>
<p>According to NASCAR‚Äôs press release, starting from 2021, BetMGM will launch live betting. The market leader BetMGM also launched a special promotion in celebration of the partnership with NASCAR. In its press release, NASCAR outlined that it has seen a significant growth in its sports betting with a growth turnover of some 1,300%.</p>
<p>The Sports Betting Giant BetMGM Continues to Grow</p>
<p>NASCAR Gaming Managing Director, Scott Warfield commented on the subject by saying: ‚ÄúPartnering with a best-in-class operator like BetMGM positions NASCAR to build on the positive energy and momentum we‚Äôre seeing around gaming and in particular the live in-race experience.‚Äù Warfield expressed his excitement to have such ‚Äúiconic brand on board.‚Äù He outlined that with BetMGM, NASCAR will expand its offering and increase its engagement with the fans.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôre excited to work with the NASCAR team to build immersive sports betting experiences that 21st-century racing fans crave,‚Äù said BetMGM‚Äôs Chief Marketing Officer, Matt Prevost</p>
<p>Prevost did not miss to say that with the unique technology by BetMGM and the iconic NASCAR races a superior betting experience will be created for racing fans across the U.S.</p>
<p>But the recent partnership is not an unexpected move by BetMGM. Over the last few months, the company signed two more key partnerships. Earlier this month, BetMGM teamed up with PGA TOUR which features the best golf players around the world. Under the partnership, BetMGM became an official betting operator for the PGA TOUR. The company received rights to use PGA TOUR marks and advertise within TOUR media and TOUR partner platforms. Furthermore, BetMGM will be able to distribute highlights to users who placed bets.</p>
<p>Back in July, BetMGM signed a partnership with the Denver Broncos. Under the partnership, BetMGM became an official sports betting partner for the three-time super bowl champions.</p>
