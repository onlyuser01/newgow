<p>Kambi Group’s esports betting data subsidiary, Abios, has inked an agreement with Bayes Esports, a provider of official esports live data. The new agreement will see the latter company power the Kambi-owned firm with its premium real-time data from some of the most popular esports titles.</p>
<p>Bayes to Power Abios with Data</p>
<p>As per the agreement, Bayes will provide Abios with data from Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, Dota 2 and League of Legends tournaments. Thanks to its agreement with various tournament organizers, Bayes will also enhance Abios’ offering with official data from event companies such as Beyond the Summit, Dreamhack, ESL Gaming and LoL Esports.</p>
<p>The data will help Abios enhance its offer and improve its critically-acclaimed odds feeds and esports wagering widgets. The two companies hope to provide customers with fast top-quality real-time official data. This, according to Abios, will allow the company to usher in new premium esports betting features such as same-game parlays, player propositions and flash markets.</p>
<p>Organizers that work with Abios will be able to get a share of the streaming revenues thanks to Bayes Esports’ revenue-share system.</p>
<p>Abios Will Enhance Its Offer</p>
<p>Bayes Esports’ chief executive and managing director, Martin Dachselt, spoke about the agreement with Abios. He said that he is glad to supply such an important esports company with Bayes’ official live data. Dachselt said that Bayes remains committed to providing best-in-class data and helping the esports sector grow.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Oskar Fröberg, chief executive officer of Abios, said that his team is delighted to ink an agreement with Bayes Esports. He added that Abios can’t wait to enhance the esports ecosystem with improved odds and esports betting widgets. Fröberg also said that Abios’ official esports data sources allow it to provide quick and reliable odds feeds that help esports fans and bettors read the game.</p>
<p>Fröberg concluded that he is looking forward to launching new visualizations that report the data in a seamless manner and help enhances customers’ esports betting experience.</p>
<p>Abios recently penned a similar agreement with another esports data provider. In late August, the company struck a partnership deal with BETER, a leading next-gen betting content provider. BETER agreed to power Abios with its all-in-one esoccer and ebasketball solutions, helping the latter company offer enhanced odds feeds to fans of virtual sports.</p>
<p>Bayes, on the other hand, agreed to work with Sportsflare and provide the Tiidal Gaming Group subsidiary with its esports odds and data.</p>
