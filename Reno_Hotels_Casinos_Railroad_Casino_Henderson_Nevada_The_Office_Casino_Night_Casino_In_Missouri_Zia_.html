<p>Relax Gaming, a company that creates unique online gaming experiences for the iGaming sector and aggregates content from third-party studios, has added Trigger Studios as its latest partner. As a result, Trigger Studios’ content will be integrated with the former’s Silver Bullet platform, which is a gateway for both operators and developers to discover new opportunities.</p>
<p>The integration marks a seminal moment in the development of Trigger Studios, a company that was founded in 2022 and has come a very long way since. Trigger Studios has focused on making its product the most entertaining it can be for gaming audiences and has achieved a superb level of engagement through what the company has described as innovative maths.</p>
<p>Trigger’s most recent release, Phoenix Up Cash, complements the company’s existing portfolio, which will now be presented with Silver Bullet partner operators, a range of tier-one brands that are interested in scaling their content by adding trustworthy and reliable brands.</p>
<p>Commenting on this new partnership opportunity, Trigger Studios Co-founder Job Spiero said that the company was indeed very proud to be now a part of the Silver Bullet content offering. He argued that the very fact Relax Gaming would consider adding a new studio to its list of partners is indicative of the hard work that has gone into bringing the studio’s product where it is today – in a limited amount of time.</p>
<p>"At Trigger we work to excite players so that they will not be bored for a moment, taking them to new places as part of the game experience. For this, we have created challenging mathematics that enhances our content and keeps players engaged as they wait in anticipation of the next event of the game," the executive said, confident in what the future may bring for his company.</p>
<p>The partnership was naturally welcomed by Relax Gaming’s own Director of Casino Products, Shelley Hannah, who saw in Trigger Studios as an important and worthwhile partner to be adding and achieving further growth across the iGaming segment. Relax Gaming already offers more than 4,000 games for the online casino segment.</p>
<p>Relax Gaming has been no stranger to developing excellent games and making good business choices. Not that long ago, the company teamed up with AboutSLOTS to craft a "Game of the Year" product.</p>
