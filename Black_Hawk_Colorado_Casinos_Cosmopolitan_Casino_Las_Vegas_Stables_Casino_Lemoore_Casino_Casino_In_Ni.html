<p>MGM Resorts International, one of the leading casino and hotel chains in the United States, has been rocked by a significant “cybersecurity issue” that prompted the shutdown of various computer systems across its properties.</p>
<p>MGM Resorts Faces Major Cybersecurity Crisis, Impacting Multiple States</p>
<p>The incident, which began on September 10, has rattled the hospitality and gaming industry. The extent of the impact remains uncertain, affecting reservation systems and casino operations in multiple states, including Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, New Jersey, New York, and Ohio, according to Brian Ahern, a spokesperson for MGM Resorts. The company has asked its customers to make telephone calls in order to sort out hotel reservations. In the statement, the company further indicated that the problem was still ongoing, but it confirmed that its casino gaming floors were functioning as usual.</p>
<p>In response to the crisis, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) announced its awareness of the ongoing situation but refrained from disclosing any specific details regarding the nature or scope of the incident. This lack of information has left many concerned about the potential ramifications.</p>
<p>MGM Resorts, in an official statement, acknowledged the presence of a “cybersecurity issue affecting some of the company’s systems.” To address the problem, the company has initiated a thorough investigation with the assistance of external cybersecurity experts. The exact nature of the issue remains undisclosed, but the statement mentioned that efforts to safeguard data had necessitated the shutdown of certain systems.</p>
<p>MGM Resorts Takes Drastic Steps as Website Goes Offline Amid Cybersecurity Crisis</p>
<p>As a consequence of the incident, the company’s website was temporarily taken offline. To mitigate the disruption, MGM Resorts provided telephone numbers for customers to reach the reservation system and individual properties, ensuring that guests can still communicate and access essential services.</p>
<p>In addition to the website outage, customers attempting to log on to the company’s BetMGM website in Nevada reported difficulties. This widespread disruption has left patrons and investors concerned about the potential financial impact on the company.</p>
<p>MGM Resorts operates an extensive portfolio of hotels and casinos, including iconic properties like the MGM Grand, Bellagio, Cosmopolitan, Aria, New York-New York, Park MGM, Excalibur, Luxor, Mandalay Bay, and Delano in Las Vegas. The company also manages properties in China and Macau, making it a global player in the hospitality and gaming industry.</p>
<p>While MGM Resorts has not released further details about the incident, it is working diligently to resolve the issue and protect the integrity of its data.</p>
