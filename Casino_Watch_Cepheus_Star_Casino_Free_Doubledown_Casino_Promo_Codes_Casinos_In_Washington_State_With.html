    <h1>Casino Watch Cepheus Star Casino Free Doubledown Casino Promo Codes Casinos In Washington State With</h1>

<p>Lets come to the point, don't try to confuse a users with your affiliate marketing wording. First of all you are mentioning that I have submitted two set of documents which is false but for a second if I submitted two documents then is this a crime? Of submitting Like pan card with aadhaar card, voter ID card etc.</p>
<p>Did you try to get clarification from users? Or present your view I thinks there is something glitch in my Google drive therefore you found two set of documents. It's not a big issue sir. He practical after all we are human not a god who don't do mistakes.</p>
<p>I am still ready to submit entire document from initial level as I can't loose my winning amount and won't. If you have any confusion and need clarification we can do the needful as well. Furthermore we can also conduct a conference video call with license regulatory as well to prove you that I have alive and submitted my real documents instead of another.</p>
<p>Have I confirm my name? If answer comes no then how did you justify?</p>
<p>Did I attempt live selfie caption kyc verification? If answer is Yes then how a third person change his/her face to someone face over live face caption high end security?</p>
<p>Did I submitted all the details like name, DOB, address? If answer comes no then how could you failed my KYC?</p>
<p>Did you confirm or try to confirm my name prior of KYC process or during the process of verification? Is answer comes no then it's is breached of code of conduct.</p>
<p>Did you request me for any type of pendency or further investigation prior of account block? Is answer is no then it's a clear sign of scam that when user wins some amount and try to withdraw you cancel their withdrawal request and ask for documents. Once he submitted documents you start your marketing tricks to restrict users for withdrawing.</p>
<p>Waiting for your legal and postive response.</p>
