<p>The Rise of Shadows Hearthstone expansion continues to release new cards. The latest arrivals are Legendary minions that come with quite a few neat abilities. Judging by their stats, they will certainly come handy once the new meta and the expansion hit.</p>
<p>New Hearthstone Cards: Blastmaster Boom</p>
<p>Whoâ€™s ready to have a blast? Blastmaster Boom comes as a worthy successor of Dr. Boom and ready to contribute to the Warrior deck in the latest Hearthstone expansion, Rise of Shadows Just like Dr. Boom before him, Blastmaster Boom will be able to call forth the Boom Bots.</p>
<p>Blastmaster Boom will summon Boom Bots based on how many Bombs your opponentâ€™s deck has. Some preparations will be necessary here as you will have to use cards such as Seaforium Bomber to shuffle cards into your opponentâ€™s deck.</p>
<p>You can further use the Wrenchcalibur weapon card which will insert a Bomb into the deck every time you inflict a hit, or failing that, you can simply rely on good old Clockwork Goblin who will be a valuable ally on the field of battle, especially if you are looking to burden your enemy with a few bombs neatly tucked away in their deck.</p>
<p>With this in mind, Blastmaster Boom shouldnâ€™t have too much trouble summoning a handful of Boom Bots to wreak havoc alongside him. Question is â€“ can you really go wild with this card and amass your army of bots?</p>
<p>Donâ€™t forget that any attempt to have your Boom Bots removed or destroyed will automatically inflict between 1-4 damage to your opponent for each Bot you have on the playfield.</p>
<p>Now, that is a blast.</p>
<p>Heistbaron Togwaggle</p>
<p>So far as new cards for Hearthstone go, Rise of Shadows will offer us distinct opportunities. Heistbaron Togwaggle is waltzing in to bolster the Rogueâ€™s Legendary roster.</p>
<p>Togwaggle allows you to obtain a fantastic treasure if a Lackey is on the board, and as to the treasure itself â€“ itâ€™s the cards you usually get from Marin the Fox who summons a chest that needs to be gunned down for the spoils.</p>
<p>Now, the only drawback with Marin was that he cost quite a bit to set up and a fair bit of effort to obtain the loot thereafter. It was a hassle and not one worth the bother when playing at the higher levels of the game.</p>
<p>Unlike him, though, Togwaggle will be able to obtain the tempting treat very early and as soon as a Lackey has been summoned. That makes Togwaggle a prime favorite for claiming priceless loot and turning the tide of the fight.</p>
<p>The League of E.V.I.L. will never be defeated! Take a look at what treasures Heistbaron Togwaggle has unearthed ðŸ‘‘ #RiseOfShadows Full Card Gallery: https://t.co/ti2cm24jrM pic.twitter.com/si0sniy1lH â€” Hearthstone (@PlayHearthstone) March 26, 2019</p>
<p>Rogues are a purely offensive class and they will need to pull off the play that involves a Lackey and Togwaggle rather quickly, which can be difficult against an expecting opponent.</p>
<p>Keeper Stallandris</p>
<p>Enter Keeper Stallandris, Rise of Shadowsâ€™ newest Druid Legendary card. Hearthstone has created a beautiful concept art for each deck, but if one truly stands out, thatâ€™s the druids. Stallandris allows you to add copies to your hand of the two choices that a Choose One spell card produces.</p>
<p>Played at a very low mana cost, you can combine Stallandris with any Choose spell, and especially Wrath which will allow you to draw a card and damage an opponent. This is a great way to keep the pressure on and playing with cards at no cost.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can hold back from using the effects and save them up for when they are needed the most.</p>
