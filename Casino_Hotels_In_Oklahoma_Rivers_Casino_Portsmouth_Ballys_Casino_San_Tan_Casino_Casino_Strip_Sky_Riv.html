    <h1>Casino Hotels In Oklahoma Rivers Casino Portsmouth Ballys Casino San Tan Casino Casino Strip Sky Riv</h1>

<p>Supplier of software-driven technology and printing solutions TransAct Technologies Incorporated has been selected by the operator of Sky River Casino in Elk Grove, California, to provide slot machine printing solutions.</p>
<p>‘Superior Performance and Features’</p>
<p>TransAct will provide its Epic Edge TITO printer to all 2,000 slot machines available on the gaming floor of the casino that was developed for the Wilton Rancheria Tribe by Boyd Gaming. Sky River Casino’s floor which is operated by Boyd is also featuring 80 table games.</p>
<p>Chris Gibase, senior vice president of Boyd Gaming, outlined Sky River Casino’s commitment to providing “the best customer experience” and explained that Epic Edge’s “superior performance and features” were the main drivers behind Boyd’s decision to select TransAct as the supplier of the slot machines’ printing solution.</p>
<p>Boasting an unsurpassed 300 DPI resolution that allows for maximum ticket readability and acceptance by bill validators, the Epic Edge is also providing USB and serial connections on a single board, with the dual interfaces offering support for the full range of new and legacy games via a single printer and also reducing the need of excess printer inventory.</p>
<p>Bart Shuldman, chief executive officer of TransAct Technologies, also commented on the agreement with Boyd Gaming and Sky River Casino, delighted to support the casino’s commitment “to giving guests a top-notch gaming experience” and outlining Epic Edge as the technology that meets perfectly the needs of the casino.</p>
<p>Product, Service, Spare Parts, Accessories</p>
<p>Operating under its BOHA!, AccuDate, EPICENTRAL, Epic, Ithaca, Printrex brands, Nasdaq-listed TransAct Technologies has sold over 3.3 million printers and terminals globally, catering to the needs of its partners from a wide range of industries, including food service, point-of-sale automation, oil and gas, besides casino and gaming, by not only providing the products but also world-class service, spare parts, and accessories to support its installed product base.</p>
<p>Since opening its doors to the public in August, Sky River Casino has been striving to exceed expectations and bring to its guests an elevated gaming experience, as well as unmatched food and dining options at its twelve unique restaurants and five bars.</p>
<p>As part of the commitment to its patrons, Sky River Casino introduced a cashless gaming option in partnership with Konami Gaming earlier in October, seeking to further enhance the type of experience players get.</p>
<p>For those slot players who do not feel comfortable using the cashless option, Sky River Casino is also featuring Everi Holdings’ CashClub Wallet digital solution, ensuring seamless and frictionless payments for slot play.</p>
