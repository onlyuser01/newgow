<p>The leading business-to-business iGaming solutions provider, WA.Technology, gears up for another successful year with the appointment of a seasoned expert. Earlier this week, the company confirmed it selected Sander Koch for the role of Chief Strategy Officer (CSO).

<p>In his new role as CSO, Koch will oversee the company's global growth strategy. He will be in charge of processes that ensure WA.Technology will meet its planned goals throughout 2024 and beyond.</p>
<p>Moreover, Koch will play an important role in guiding WA.Technology's business transformation efforts.

<p>Tim Scoffham, WA.Technology's CEO, shared his excitement about the latest senior-level appointment. "Sander's blend of industry knowledge and strategic vision is a perfect match for WA.Technology's objectives," he explained in a statement. Finally, Scoffham said: "We are excited to have him on board and are confident that his leadership will propel WA.Technology towards accelerated growth across the world."</p>
<p>Koch was similarly excited and added: "As I step into the role of Chief Strategy Officer at WA.Technology, I'm thrilled about the opportunity that lies ahead for this exciting chapter in the company's story." According to the new CSO, his appointment comes during an important time for the company.</p>
<p>He said that it is delightful to join such a seasoned team of experts. Last but not least, Koch pointed out: "I see this as a chance to make a significant impact, drive our collective ambitions, and be part of something groundbreaking in the industry."</p>
<p>Currently, Koch holds a Master of Science in Business Economics from Erasmus University Rotterdam. He also completed the Global Creative Leadership Program at THNK - School of Creative Leadership. He is a recognizable leader and has a track record as a strategic advisor.</p>
<p>Before joining WA.Technology, Koch was most recently a part of Arthur D. Little in Dubai where he served as a Partner. His professional background includes important roles with Oliver Wyman, while he also co-founded Novo Management Consultants.</p>
