<p>Triple-layered ad fraud protection for brands, agencies and ad networks TrafficGuard has inked a new agreement with RavenTrack, an online gaming affiliate.</p>
<p>TrafficGuard Inks a Deal with RavenTrack</p>
<p>TrafficGuard and RavenTrack have formed a new partnership to help betting brands and advertisers spend less on affiliate marketing by avoiding fraud. To that end, TrafficGuard will leverage its full-funnel multipoint Affiliate Protection Product to analyze end-users engagement, intent and propensity. As a result, the company will provide brands with a transparent view of their advertising activities, which they can use to boost their returns.</p>
<p>TrafficGuard’s affiliate product is equipped with customized filters that help makes sure affiliates do not overstep operators’ terms and conditions. As per the current deal, TrafficGuard’s solution will be integrated into RavenTrack, thus helping brands and advertisers who use their software get optimized results.</p>
<p>The new deal comes in response to the massive growth online gambling and sports betting has experienced. Currently, estimates believe that about a quarter of the global population likes to wager on sports in a market that may yield as much as $127 billion a year by 2025.</p>
<p>Affiliate marketing is a strategy that many brands use to quickly grow their customer base. However, the aforementioned growth has created a very competitive market that has, unfortunately, become the home of many scammers. And it is TrafficGuard’s purpose to prevent exactly these scams. The solution is able to stop many types of invalid traffic, including anonymized traffic, cookie stuffing and domain spoofing.</p>
<p>TrafficGuard Fights for a Healthier Digital Space</p>
<p>Matt Sutton, TrafficGuard’s chief executive, noted that the huge boost the iGaming industry experienced amid the pandemic allowed many “bad actors” to join the fray. However, TrafficGuard is there to put a stop to this and is more than willing to mitigate the damage by the fraudulent activities.</p>
<p>Through our Affiliate Prevention and integration into RavenTrack, we want to enable the brands and advertisers using their market-leading software to get their optimized and accurate ROAS with the right data, at the right time. Matt Sutton, CEO, TrafficGuard</p>
<p>Sutton noted that TrafficGuard’s solutions exist to help affiliate platforms such as RavenTrack deliver positive business outcomes to their customers.</p>
<p>Adam Rowley, RavenTrack’s managing director, added that his company acknowledges the need for accurate tracking. Because of that, his team is delighted to join forces with TrafficGuard and further boost the quality of RavenTrack’s products.</p>
<p>Our clients already reap the rewards of our fraud prevention tracking, and the partnership between RavenTrack and TrafficGuard will see our customers benefit from TrafficGuard’s premier expertise across ad networks, especially supporting customers in the global gaming and sports betting arenas, thereby helping us further our mission of ensuring the best possible performance for our customers. Adam Rowley, MD, RavenTrack</p>
<p>TrafficGuard recently unveiled a similar solution for social media. TrafficGuard Social is aimed at eliminating fraud from platforms such as Facebook. The solution will roll out in 2023 and will expand to cover the most popular social media platforms.</p>
