<p>EPIC Risk Management, the leading problem gambling awareness and harm minimization organization in the US and the UK, unveiled multiple initiatives during this year's Safer Gambling Week. The Safer Gambling Week started on Monday, October 17 and will continue until Sunday, October 23, 2022. During the one week, government structures joined forces with operators to raise awareness of responsible gambling tools and encourage responsible play.</p>
<p>Considering that one of EPIC Management's main goals is to prevent gambling harm, the organization unveiled a schedule packed with different activities and initiatives. As a result, the organization said it will organize "a mix of education sessions in schools, delivery of programs in professional sport and speaking opportunities at key industry conferences and seminars."</p>
<p>Dan Spencer, EPIC's director of safer gambling, commented on the topic in a statement released on October 17, 2022. He said: "There are a number of reasons why institutions should always keep safer gambling and player protection at the forefront of their thinking."</p>
<p>Spencer explained that problem gambling can have a significant impact on consumers, as well as companies, that may breach their license conditions. "Most organizations will also feel that they have a duty of care, welfare and conscience to protect employees and customers as a matter of public health, taking into account the implications on wider society," he added.</p>
<p>During the Safer Gambling Week, EPIC's UK-facing activities include education sessions for children under age 14 in eight different schools. The organization explained that the schools will include state, as well as private secondary schools.</p>
<p>Additionally, EPIC will present "lived experience presentations to two English professional sports clubs." The gambling awareness organization unveiled it will participate in different safer gambling seminars organized in London, as well as Amsterdam and Melbourne.</p>
<p>On the other hand, EPIC's US-facing activities include gambling harm awareness seminars. The group revealed it will conduct multiple such seminars for student-athletes at the three NCAA college campuses in the US.</p>
<p>In Australia, EPIC's initiatives will include hosting a round table. The gambling harm minimization group will sit down with leading sports organizations and discuss methods to identify gambling harm. Another initiative organized by EPIC will be a free online webinar that will share lived experiences. Above all, EPIC explained that "lived experience will be at the heart of all" of its events.</p>
<p>Although EPIC has planned multiple initiatives, the leading gambling harm minimization organization reiterated its mantra that safer gambling "should be a 24 hours a day, 365 days a year aspiration."</p>
