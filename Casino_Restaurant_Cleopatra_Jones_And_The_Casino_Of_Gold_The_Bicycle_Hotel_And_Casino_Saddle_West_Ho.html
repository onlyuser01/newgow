    <h1>Casino Restaurant Cleopatra Jones And The Casino Of Gold The Bicycle Hotel And Casino Saddle West Ho</h1>

<p>I withdraw the money, receive an email that withdrawal is being processed, then receive an email a few hours later to tell me that the withdrawal has been cancelled. They claim 'technical problems' with my bank, however, I contacted them and they say no deposit has been attempted.</p>
<p>They sent an email telling me I need to use a different account, but to do this they want me to make another deposit. They have also listed several banks that I am not allowed to use to make a deposit. Thgis all sounds very dodgy to me. I have made many deposits with the card I use, and have made one successful withdrawal. I have spent thousands at that casino and want to withdraw $550, and they won't allow it.</p>
<p>Please Help</p>
