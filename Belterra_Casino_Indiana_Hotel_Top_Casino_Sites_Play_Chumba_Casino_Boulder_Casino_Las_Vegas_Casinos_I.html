    <h1>Belterra Casino Indiana Hotel Top Casino Sites Play Chumba Casino Boulder Casino Las Vegas Casinos I</h1>

<p>Hi Nick</p>
<p>Thank you for responding so promptly. I really hope you will be able help me.</p>
<p>ACCOUNT VERIFICATION</p>
<p>My account was fully verified on August 20th. Verification was confirmed by an agent who was assisting with the process and checking my documentation, and the verification status on my profile was updated to reflect this.</p>
<p>HOW I ACCUMULATED THE WINNINGS?</p>
<p>First, on August 19, I deposited R300 and lost it all. On the same day, I spoke with an agent to find out why I hadn't received a bonus. He stated that the R400 minimum deposit amount was required to qualify for a bonus and that I had missed my bonus for my first deposit and could only be issued a bonus on my second, third, and fourth deposits as a result.</p>
<p>I then made my second deposit of R400 shortly after my conversation with the agent and received a bonus of 100% of the deposit amount, on top of which I won. As a result, all of my winnings were the result of a combination of my money and their bonus.</p>
<p>THE LAST TIME OF CONTACT</p>
<p>I just spoke with an agent via live chat a few hours ago. I contacted them four times yesterday alone. The reason for this was to try to contact different agents to see if I would receive the same feedback, and as expected, the feedback and reasons for my withdrawals being rejected were different. Some claimed that the payment had already been processed on their end and that finance was waiting for my bank to accept the payment, while others claimed that my information was incorrect. These were the same reasons I have been getting all along.</p>
<p>When I asked for proof that payment had been approved on their end, they said they couldn't provide it and couldn't explain why. With every request or query I've filed, they've asked for my banking information and a statement, which I provided a couple of times at first before realizing I was being played. I did this over 12 times almost every day with different agents for two full weeks, until I was either ignored or told to wait for the Casino Manager, who would contact me via email.</p>
<p>I understand you advise that I should wait at least 14 days for verification or withdrawal to be processed. However, with all due respect, I must disagree that your recommendation is appropriate for my context, given my recent experience with the Casino. If waiting that long was what I needed to do, I believe reasonable efforts would have been made to communicate that clearly to me. Instead, we just kept going around in circles.</p>
<p>I hope I've given you enough information to work with and that you'll be able to help me get my money back.</p>
<p>Your assistance is greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Mbuso</p>
