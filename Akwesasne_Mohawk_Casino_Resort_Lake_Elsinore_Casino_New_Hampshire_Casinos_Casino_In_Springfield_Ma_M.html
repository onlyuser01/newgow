    <h1>Akwesasne Mohawk Casino Resort Lake Elsinore Casino New Hampshire Casinos Casino In Springfield Ma M</h1>

<p>I was recently try this casino, Locowin and got a welcome bonus of 125 euro (made a deposit 125 euro) in total 250 euro. I played a lot of Nettent slots, which you can honestly play in every casino with a bonus. My favourite is Twin spin. In the end I fullfilled my wagering requirements and made a withdrawal of 1000 euro. On top of that I didn't had to use my bonus money as I still won all my winnings with my real balance.</p>
<p>After they asked me to verify my account, I have sent all the required documents. I have just received in e-mail that I breached the bonus conditions because I wasn't able to play the game 'Twin Spin' with my bonus money.</p>
<p>Now this is my problem. I do understand that there are T&amp;C coming with a bonus, but what I always do is scan them. Never ever did I see the slots they exclude, apparentely there is a huge list that you can't play. My problem is that there is no player that is reading all the pages of T and C and I am sure this is a common problem with this casino. Have you ever heard of a casino that is not allowed any slots to play with a bonus? I havent and I have visit over a 100 casinos already and NEVER have I faced this problem. I know this is going to be a very hard case as the T and C are what it is. But honestly, which casino is giving restrictions to slot games, maybe in waggering but never to play the slots</p>
<p>On top of this I didn't do this on purpose, I was just playing and had a good time. A violotion of the terms is a big word for someone who didnt know about it. The casino should restrict players with a bonus to play those games. The list of restrict slots is that big that you easily make a mistake, as it is not a test, they should lock down those games.</p>
<p>I have never ever experienced something like this and it makes me furious that its very easy for a casino to take its players for granted and not give any warning before opening slots with Any restriction. they should protect their players and block them plus nobody is really reading all the terms and conditions and they know it.</p>
<p>I find it very hard to let this go because I also didnt play with my bonus amount, so basically the winnings are mine and should have just pay out.</p>
<p>worst casino ever played with surrealistic terms and conditions and because I am sure I am not the only who happened this, it feels like a scam</p>
