<p>Max Holloway’s Resurrection Starts on Saturday</p>
<p>Max Holloway is 23-7 with four of those losses happening in the last seven fights. But there’s a caveat. All of those defeats happened to elite fighters. He lost three times to the UFC Featherweight champion Alexander Volkanovski, while the fourth loss happened to Dustin Poirier.</p>
<p>What’s interesting is that all of those defeats happened by decision, meaning that Holloway did not get himself embarrassed in any of those fights. The same goes actually for all of his fights in the UFC, in each of which he fought until the very end.</p>
<p>This guy’s not great on the floor, but he’s one of the greatest strikers in the world. In fact, Holloway is the record holder for the most significant strikes landed in the history of the UFC. He averages 7.24 strikers per minute, which is more than two times more than his next opponent.</p>
<p>Arnold Allen Hoping for That Great Leap Forward</p>
<p>The Englishman is 19-1 in his professional career with his only loss happening in 2014. It was a decision loss, and since then, he’s 12-0. In his last two, he won by KO/TKO each time, but before that, most of his wins came after the final bell. He also has four wins by submission, but the most recent of those happened in 2018.</p>
<p>Allen hasn’t fought as elite fighters as his next opponent, but he did a couple of big fights. In his most recent fight, for example, he defeated Calvin Kattar by technical knockout. His opponent injured his knee in round 2, but before that, Allan was the one who was dominating. That said, he 100% deserved to win that fight.</p>
<p>Max Holloway vs. Arnold Allen Prediction</p>
<p>Arnold Allen is a smart fighter with plenty of weapons in his arsenal. Unfortunately for him, his next opponent is even better. Holloway might not be as well-rounded as Allen, but his striking ability is just way superior to his next opponent. We think he’s going to outbox Allen and win the fight by decision.</p>
<p>Pick: Max Holloway to win by decision</p>
