<p>AstroPay Selected as One of the Sponsors of the Pinnacle Cup III</p>
<p>AstroPay, a provider of alternative payment solutions, has expanded its presence in esports by inking an esports sponsorship deal with the gambling operator Pinnacle.</p>
<p>The agreement will see AstroPay as one of the sponsors of the Pinnacle Cup III – a professional gaming tournament in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. The event is co-sponsored by Pinnacle and the esports data platform GRID and will be organized by the production company Relog Media.</p>
<p>As one of the sponsors, AstroPay will use its technology to enhance the viewer experience for Pinnacle Cup III’s audience.</p>
<p>The Pinnacle Cup III is the third iteration of the Pinnacle-sponsored CS:GO tournament. With a prize pool of $100,000, the event attracted players from all over the world. A total of 160 esports athletes divided into 32 teams have taken part in the third Pinnacle Cup. The tournament is an international event and will welcome people from numerous regions.</p>
<p>The Pinnacle Cup III was originally announced in October 2021, with the operator planning to host the event between November 8 and 23. However, various circumstances forced Pinnacle to rethink its schedule and postpone the tournament until early 2022.</p>
<p>The tournament began on March 14 and will wrap up on March 29. The latest match saw Tricked Esports defeat ECSTATIC in the quarterfinals of the playoffs and secure its place in the semifinals. The next game is between Team Vitality and SKADE and will begin soon.</p>
<p>Esports enthusiasts can watch the action live on the TEBTV Twitch channel where the tournament is streamed in three languages. Alternatively, fans can opt to view the championship on Pinnacle’s official YouTube channel.</p>
