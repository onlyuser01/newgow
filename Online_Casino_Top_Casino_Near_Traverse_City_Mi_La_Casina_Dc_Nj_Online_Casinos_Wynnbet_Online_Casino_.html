    <h1>Online Casino Top Casino Near Traverse City Mi La Casina Dc Nj Online Casinos Wynnbet Online Casino</h1>

<p>Hello, I want to complain about this operator Casbit Group NV Several casinos operate under them. All their casinos operate under their license. All casinos have the same license:</p>
<p>License</p>
<p>GLH-OCCHKTW0709012021</p>
<p>Licensee:Casbit Group NV</p>
<p>I have requested the closure of casinos due to a game problem, I requested a closure from their company's casino:</p>
<p>trueflip casino</p>
<p>justbit casino</p>
<p>But despite that, they didn't ban me from all their casinos. And I managed to lose MANY THOUSANDS OF EUROS.</p>
<p>Their terms also state:</p>
<p>This is User's first registration. I have not self-excluded from any gambling website in the past 12 months. I'm aware and acknowledge that Lala.bet sets certain limitations to the maximum prizes that can be won per day/week/month and/or can be withdrawn per day/week/month</p>
<p>i.e. if I had ever won I wouldn't have won because I've been excluded from their group.</p>
<p>In Junglew's terms of use, they talk about "we" the company "casbit group nv" in the terms of use there is a mention:</p>
<p>point 7</p>
<p>In case you want to be temporarily or permanently self-excluded and stop betting or gambling for a set time, please contact our customer support agent via email. On receipt of an email request for account closure, the requested account and any linked accounts will be placed on our first stage, a 24-hr cooling off period which will disable your account or accounts, allowing no gambling activity. Once this time has passed; while your account or accounts remain closed, a customer support agent will inform you of the 1-week, 1-month, 6-month and permanent self-exclusion available. There will be no variation in these time periods. To proceed with this process, we will require an email response. If we do not receive a response within a further 24 - hrs, your account will be reopened and confirmed by email.</p>
<p>I made the first blocking request to justbet casino due to a game problem (chat) July 2023, I have no proof of this and the casino does not agree to send my GDPR information.</p>
<p>I made another blocking request to trueflip casino on August 18, 2023.</p>
<p>after this I was still able to lose thousands of euros to lalabet casino and jungliwi casino.</p>
<p>On 04.10.2023 I sent a new blocking request to junglewin casino and they answered me "a vip agent will contact you" and MY ACCOUNT IS STILL NOT CLOSED. How is possible? Even though I reported a game problem they still didn't shut me down. I demand a refund of the deposit from all accounts.</p>
<p>this chat was sent to true flip casino on 18 August 2023.</p>
<p>this has been sent to junglewin casino on 10/4/2023</p>
<p>answer:</p>
<p>the account is not CLOSED I HAVE LOST MORE THAN 400e</p>
<p>HELP!!</p>
