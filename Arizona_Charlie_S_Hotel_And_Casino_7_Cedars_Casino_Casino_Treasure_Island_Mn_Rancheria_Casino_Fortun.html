    <h1>Arizona Charlie S Hotel And Casino 7 Cedars Casino Casino Treasure Island Mn Rancheria Casino Fortun</h1>

<p>The leading provider of unique and highly engaging games for the online gambling industry, 7777 gaming, announced a new deal, helping it expand its global presence. The company joined forces with the global award-winning casino games aggregator Alea earlier this week. As a result of the new content partnership, 7777 gaming's entire portfolio of content will become available via the aggregator's platform.</p>
<p>The collaboration represents a major step for the iGaming developer as it helps it significantly expand the reach of its content to new operators. This, in turn, is expected to help 7777 gaming titles reach new audiences around the world, helping further popularize the developer's portfolio that surpasses 100 casino games.</p>
<p>The content agreement with Alea comes as no surprise, considering the company's leadership position as a casino games aggregator. Currently, the company's aggregation platform offers more than 10,000 games.</p>
<p>Similar to other aggregators, Alea enables seamless integration via a single API. This method helps minimize the need for technical maintenance and cuts the fees for the deployment of casino content. As a result of the collaboration, Alea's partners will be able to tap into 7777 gaming's popular casino games.</p>
<p>Eduard Verdaguer, Alea's Games Manager, shared his excitement in a statement saying: "The 7777 gaming portfolio is an eclectic mix of games that are bound to appeal to different players." Finally, he explained: "This collection of games will serve as a great addition to our platform and we look forward to offering these titles on our platforms soon."</p>
<p>Without any doubt, the collaboration with the leading casino games aggregator will boost 7777 gaming's growth. Additionally, the recent partnership complements similar integration deals inked between the company and globally-recognized aggregators such as iGT PlayDigital, Hub88, 1x2 Network and EveryMatrix, among others.</p>
<p>Asya Raykova, 7777 gaming's Account Manager, was similarly excited about the partnership with Alea. She said that the company is delighted to join forces with the award-winning casino games aggregator. Last but not least, Raykova said: "The global reach of this partnership will allow us to continue pushing the boundaries of what is possible with an online casino and bring more games to market through various distribution channels."</p>
<p>Recently, 7777 gaming expanded its content reach via a deal with the gaming, fintech and blockchain company, Yolo Group. Under the terms of the collaboration, the leading provider of games saw 25 of its popular titles go live with Yolo Group's brands Sportsbet and Bitcasino.</p>
