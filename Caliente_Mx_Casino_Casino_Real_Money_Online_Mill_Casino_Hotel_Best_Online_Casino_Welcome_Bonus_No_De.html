<p>Aztec Gold Megaways review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Aztec Gold Megaways borrows its imagery from South American civilisations that existed before the Columbian Exchange. But it turns that imagery into a fantasy setting with some Mike Mignola style art and a god-like emperor-priest.</p>
<p>It puts one in mind of the Hellboy comics or Disney’s Atlantis, but with real Inca flavour.</p>
<p>Can you decipher the ancient myth, and find the City of Gold? That’s the story to unravel in this slot.</p>
<p>Three main features of this slot are Megaways system, cascade win system and any-way win system</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>As is often the case with slots built on the Megaways licence, Aztec Gold is beautifully rendered. The software (and no doubt the investment spent licensing it) often seems to inspire the graphics departments of the slot studios that use it. The reels combine the boxy style of Aztec pictograms with the more cartoony style of modern cell animation. The result is something that just oozes adventure.</p>
<p>The accompanying animations are detailed, and attractive. A winning combo triggers a proper light show, and everything is brilliantly coordinated with the music and sound effects.</p>
<p>The soundscape is all jungle sounds, pipes and drums, and the sound of rumbling stone mechanisms.</p>
<p>All in all, this is a slot with wonderful visual design and atmospheric sound.</p>
<p>Big win in the Aztec Gold Megaways slot</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Aztec Gold Megaways uses the Megaways system, which randomises the number of symbols on each reel every spin. Here, the six reels can have up to seven symbols on them and a minimum of two. This makes for a range of win ways from 64 to 117,649.</p>
<p>Winning combinations are removed from the reels and new symbols drop in from above. Any new winning combinations from this cascade count towards the player's winnings for the spin.</p>
<p>There are a set of jackpots and a bonus game, which keep things interesting, though no gamble feature.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter symbol.</p>
<p>Five or more Scatters on the reel trigger Aztec Gold Cash Respin Bonus. Scatters come with a multiplier number on them or the word Mini, Major, or Mega.</p>
<p>During the Respin Bonus, all Scatters remain locked in place. The player gets three respins. Everytime a new Scatter lands on the reels, the number of remaining spins resets to three. At the end of the respins, the multiplier numbers on the Scatters will be added up and applied to the player’s bet per spin.</p>
<p>The Mini, Major, and Mega Scatters are worth a x30, x100, and x1,000 multiplier respectively.</p>
<p>Full paytable for Aztec Gold Megaways slot machine</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 95.99%, more or less spot on our yardstick for average, which is about 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.10 up to a maximum of $/£/€100.00 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is medium-high, which makes it a good match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility, so there are better matches out there. But this one is solid.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>With a beautiful front end, Aztec Gold already holds a lot of appeal to your average player. The production value feels present in everything from the heft of the reels as they spin to the soundtrack music.</p>
<p>Behind the scenes it puts out a respectable 95.99% RTP and medium-high volatility. And a range of gameplay features that should satisfy the average punter.</p>
<p>We recommend this slot wholeheartedly.</p>
