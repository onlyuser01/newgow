<p>iGaming content provider BGaming and cryptocurrency-based platform Stake.com have agreed to partner for the launch of a new slot game powered with player analytics data. The new game has a Western theme in place and it is called Wild West Bonanza. It leverages player preferences and delivers customized player experiences.</p>
<p>Personalization, a Critical Factor for Growth</p>
<p>BGaming’s product owner brand exclusive games Alexandr Shavel referred to personalization in gaming as the “key driver” for growth in the future, especially in the context of the over-saturation and high levels of competition in today’s iGaming market. He also expressed the company’s delight to further expand its partnership with Stake, while taking the time to express his “gratitude for trust and openness regarding the collaboration.”</p>
<p>Wild West Bonanza is the company’s third personalized game created in partnership with Stake. It relies on BGaming’s refilling reels mechanic. Its designers primarily focused on the needs of slot streamers who exploded in popularity on Twitch and other similar streaming platforms online. Stake representatives enthusiastically spoke about the new deal, saying it has been “a pleasure working with BGaming to make this game a reality.” They also mentioned their Originals games, adding their excitement to be sharing their creative input for the creation of fresh games with game providers. Since the new slot’s quality has already exceeded all expectations, Stake is convinced that the game will perform well on the platform.</p>
<p>Bonus Round with Random Win Multiplier Up to x100</p>
<p>The new game has a mouth-watering bonus round featuring a random win multiplier of up to x100 along with a maximum payout of x15000 the bet for a single spin. The slot also introduces players to features selected based on players’ preferences data, while incorporating a series of eye-catching elements. The list includes an attractive UX/UI, dynamic animations, and cool sound effects, and allows slot streamers to enjoy simple interaction to make their streams even more fun.</p>
<p>Only registered Stake players can access the new slot. At the beginning of July, BGaming launched a sequel to the Lucky Lady Moon slot, adding the exciting Megaways mechanics to it. The game also featured the same refilling mechanic as Wild West Bonanza, along with Free Spins, wilds, scatters, and multipliers up to x25 the bet. The month before, the company announced the extension of its European presence through a new partnership with Platincasino. The leading supplier currently runs a network consisting of more than 550 partners spread all around the world.</p>
