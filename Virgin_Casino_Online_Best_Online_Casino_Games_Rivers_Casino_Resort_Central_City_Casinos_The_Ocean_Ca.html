<p>The leading content provider for the iGaming industry, Pragmatic Play, announced a donation to the only wildlife sanctuary in Gibraltar. The company revealed Tuesday it donated £6,850 ($8,070) to the Alameda Wildlife Conservation Park, a small wildlife park situated in the Botanic Gardens in Gibraltar.</p>
<p>The recent donation will help support the Alameda Wildlife Conservation Park's new North American turtle exhibit. Pragmatic Play's donation will fund the refurbishment of the turtle exhibit's ponds. Those ponds need filtered water that is constantly running to ensure the well-being of their inhabitants.</p>
<p>Julian Jarvis, Pragmatic Play's CEO, commented on the topic in a recent statement. He said: "As the only wildlife park in Gibraltar, the AWCP fulfills a crucial part in the protection of rare animal species, and we’re extremely proud to be able to support the restructuring of its outdoor spaces and turtle ponds."</p>
<p>Jarvis pointed out that up to four different turtle species will be housed in a pond thanks to the company's recent donation. In conclusion, Pragmatic Play's CEO said that the company is looking forward to "establishing new ways to support the conservation group moving forward."</p>
<p>Founded back in 2002, the Alameda Wildlife Conservation Park is a home for animals confiscated by customs, as well as unwanted exotic pets such as the cotton-topped tamarin. Besides sheltering exotic animals, the park seeks to raise awareness of the importance of protecting endangered species.</p>
<p>The wildlife park shelters not only tropical species. It is home to three different species of North American turtle such as map turtles, the famous snapping turtle and yellow-bellied sliders, a unique species of turtle that lives for more than 70 years.</p>
<p>One of the goals of the AWCP is to conserve endangered species in the wild. This is why the park participates in different projects that help threatened species survive in the wild. The park also partakes in captive breeding programs, that are significantly important for the survival of endangered species.</p>
<p>Only recently, Pragmatic Play unveiled plans to attend and sponsor the G&amp;M News Mercosur Summit, a prestigious iGaming industry event set to launch on August 31 and run through September 1, 2022, in Puerto Iguazu, Misiones, Argentina.</p>
<p>Before that, Pragmatic Play grew its footprint in Brazil via a deal with the operator Smashup. The collaboration saw the company provide its complete slot, live casino and virtual sports portfolio for customers of the operator in Brazil. Aside from Pragmatic Play expanding its global footprint, the new collaboration will also help Smashup grow its presence in the region.</p>
