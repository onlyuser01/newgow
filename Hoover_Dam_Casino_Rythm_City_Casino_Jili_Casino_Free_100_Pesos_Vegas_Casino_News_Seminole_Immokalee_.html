<p>Dear ar5hh,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. Iâ€™m sorry to hear about your problem. Please allow me to ask you a few questions, so I can understand the whole situation completely. Could you please advise if there was some notification that all the winnings will be voided in case you cancel the active bonus? I understand that it would be ideal if the casino checked with the player if he's aware that in case of the bonus being cancelled before completing the wagering all the winnings associated with it will be cancelled too. Unfortunately, this is not a common practice yet. It is nothing unusual that if you cancel the bonus, the entire balance is voided as it was accumulated with the bonus funds.</p>
<p>Looking forward to hearing from you. Thank you in advance.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
