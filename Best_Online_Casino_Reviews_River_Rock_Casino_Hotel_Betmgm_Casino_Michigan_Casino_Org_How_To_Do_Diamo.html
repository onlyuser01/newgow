<p>There’s exciting news for sports bettors in New Jersey as the first peer-to-peer sports betting exchange in the US, Prophet, announced it opened pre-registration for customers ahead of the exchange launch.</p>
<p>Pre-Registration with Perks</p>
<p>ProphetExchange.com, the New Jersey-based website that will allow sports bettors to set prices for other users’ bets, as well as place bets on their own, is now open for pre-registration, offering an enticing match-up bonus for everyone.</p>
<p>The progressive match-up bonus that is part of the company’s first crowd-funded campaign under the motto “Exchange The Love” will increase with an increment of $25 for every new 500 customers who open an account with the sports betting exchange.</p>
<p>According to Prophet CEO and co-founder Dean Sisun, “Exchange The Love” campaign is the perfect way “to reward everyone who joins Prophet at the pre-registration stage,” as the company is “gearing up for its full consumer launch in its home state of New Jersey.</p>
<p>An exchange grows stronger with more active users – more liquidity equals better prices – which is why we wanted to create a campaign that allows users to help each other while also being incentivized for doing so.” Dean Sisun, CEO and CO-Founder, Prophet</p>
<p>In essence, the progressive match-up bonus means that when the pre-registration closes and there are 5,000 people registered at the sports betting exchange, all 5,000 new customers will receive $250 of deposit match-up bonus upon their first deposit, Prophet CEO Sisun explained. “The more people that come on board now, the more everyone gains,” he concluded.</p>
<p>NJ Launch Slated by the End of 2021</p>
<p>ProphetExchange.com is launching in New Jersey via a multi-year market access deal with Caesars Entertainment announced in July, under which the casino giant and the peer-to-peer sports betting exchange agreed for the launch of the innovative sports betting product, betprophet.co, initially in New Jersey for the 2021 NFL and college football season, followed by a launch in Indiana in 2022, as well as future rollouts to additional US states.</p>
<p>Headquartered in the New Jersey, Prophet was co-founded in 2018 by CEO Dean Sisun and COO Jake Benzaquen, who brought together a team of experts to develop a product that was not available in the US, a peer-to-peer sports betting exchange over desktop and mobile.</p>
<p>Prophet’s first license was obtained in the UK as betting exchanges lack in popularity in the US. Unlike sportsbooks, which obtain their odds from oddsmaker technology providers, sports betting exchanges offer betting lines obtained from one customer to another.</p>
