    <h1>Lago Resort Casino In Seneca County Turtle Creek Casino And Hotel Cool Cat Casino 150 No Deposit Bon</h1>

<p>The casino went down for maintenance the week after my withdrawals were made. When it went back online the casino was owned by a new company.</p>
<p>I continued playing with them and won more money that is still pending. Out of curiosity I went to check on my pending withdrawals and the ones I had made before the new ownership did not appear on the pending withdrawal section. I asked chat about them and they were not able to see them neither. They were supposed to get back to me via email but never have</p>
<p>At the moment there is 1600+2000 withdrawn to my Muchbetter account that is no where to be found. I also have 4700 withdrawn via crypto that is pending.</p>
<p>Please help me</p>
