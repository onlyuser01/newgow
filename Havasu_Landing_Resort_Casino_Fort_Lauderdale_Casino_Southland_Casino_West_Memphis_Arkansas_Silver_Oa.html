    <h1>Havasu Landing Resort Casino Fort Lauderdale Casino Southland Casino West Memphis Arkansas Silver Oa</h1>

<p>I have been playing in this casino for a few days and invested quite a bit of money. It came time to withdraw $900 cdn and they are giving me incredible difficulty. I have supplied all of the documentation required and they are not satisfied. This is what they required when I tried to make a withdrawal " We need not new one deposit, we need the confirmation of your deposit in the amount of 50 CAD made on June 29, 2022 01:36:38 with the amount, date, time and your name visible" . I provided this information in several different forms then they wanted an official document from my bank showing the deposit, I also provided them with this. (Which I have never had to do at any online casino)</p>
<p>They want the time of the transaction which my bank does not track or have (I have sent them a copy of an email chain with the bank explaining this). I play in many online casinos including others Skycrown are affiliated with and I have NEVER been asked for a transaction time. As well nowhere in their Proof of Payment Policy does it say they require the transaction time nor the other information. (see below). I have provided them with everything except the time of the transaction which is impossible to get.</p>
<p>Proof of Payment</p>
<p>Screenshot or photo from online bank, bank statement, Skrill page, etc. showing the deposit. Must display the company name. Must display the amount paid.</p>
<p>It seems this casino takes money easily but makes it so difficult to make a withdrawal, maybe to make people give up and walk away?? I wont do that. I dont believe this casino is operating with honesty and good intention.</p>
<p>Any help you can give me will be appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks so much</p>
