<p>Gossip pays out sometimes but they are as crooked as can be I have played and spent more $$ on gossip more then anybody on this platform or the entire world it all depends on your win loss rating whether they will pay you or not any they cheat in an incredible amount of ways and just when I think I have all there cheating figured out they dupe me again a few minutes ago I was in a bonus and it knocked me out of the system and when I logged back on it didn’t take me where I left off and it does that when your about to get a decent payoff I’m never going to knock the guru but the rating for gossip is dead wrong and there sister / vip slots and there’s one other are garbage I have more screenshots of cheating on gossip then you can imagine I have over 70k screenshots from my play because I document everything I know more about these casinos then ANYBODY on the planet and it cost me about 250k in 3 years of research but I’m hoping soon I will pass this valuable information I have to put these cheaters to rest and save hard working players from being cheated unfortunately they all cheat in one way or another it’s too easy not too the best thing is not to play in on limited time now and have the $$ to finish my research because if and when I do find a legitimate online casino I am going to leave them a gift and a lot of valuable information about what there competitors are doing every online casino will win without cheating that’s a fact however there’s an infamous word called GREED = POWER and they will be sorry when the end comes and they have to pay the piper ✌️🤷🏼‍♂️🙏🏻</p>
