<p>Delasport, a global iGaming software solutions provider, has forged a new strategic partnership with sports betting operator FansBet. The supplier will arm the latter company with solutions, allowing it to capitalize on its Maltese business-to-customer license.</p>
<p>The FansBet Group already has a strong presence in many regulated jurisdictions. The company, which has a player-first approach and always strives to provide its fans with exciting betting experiences, will greatly benefit from the agreement.</p>
<p>Under the deal, Delasport will become FansBet’s iGaming platform supplier. As a result, FansBet will receive access to the provider’s acclaimed solutions, helping it boost its offerings. The operator will therefore be able to leverage its Maltese B2C license to bolster its products with Delasport-powered sports betting, PAM and casino solutions. Delasport will also provide FansBet with a range of engagement tools, such as betting tournaments, spinning wheel games, missions and others.</p>
<p>Delasport’s forte is providing operators across the world with an all-in-one white label iGamming solution. Thanks to the efficient technology it offers, the company has cemented its position as a premier sports betting and casino supplier, which is further attested by the White Label Supplier of the Year award it received this September. This is not the only award Delasport received this year as it was also named Online Sportsbook Provider of the Year at Sigma Europe this month.</p>
<p>As a global company, Delasport will be able to power FansBet’s offerings in multiple markets. Both companies share the same passion for sports betting and want to provide end customers with the best wagering experiences possible.</p>
<p>FansBet Is Excited to Have Delasport’s Backing</p>
<p>The supplier’s chief executive officer, Oren Shwartz, spoke about the new deal, saying that his team is glad that FansBet chose Delasport as its new iGaming provider. Shwartrz is sure that the company’s solutions will help FansBet cement its leadership position in the markets where it operates.</p>
<p>I am confident that our premium package of Sportsbook, Casino, PAM, and Managed Services will help FansBet dominate its markets, engage players in novel and exciting ways, and experience rapid progress as a result. Oren Shwartz, CEO, Delasport</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Enda Gaffney, FansBet’s chief executive officer, reaffirmed his company’s intentions of providing customers with best-in-class experiences. He is sure that the Delasport agreement will enhance the operator’s product offering, helping it live up to its own standards.</p>
<p>With the help of our new cooperation with Delasport, we will be able to keep our end of the bargain and demonstrate our dedication to high standards everywhere. We are eager to see what the future holds for our business and our players as a result of having access to new markets. Enda Gaffney, CEO, FansBet</p>
<p>The British arm of FansBet is operated by Argyll Entertainment, which is a part of the EEG family. Because of that, some people are slightly concerned about the future of the brand’s business in the United Kingdom following the closure of SportNation and RedZone.</p>
