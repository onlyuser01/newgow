<p>The leading gaming and sports betting operator, BetMGM, announced the launch of next-generation and improved sports betting features for its application, bringing unrivaled experiences. The company confirmed details regarding the improved app last week and its launch comes just in time for the 2023-24 football season, offering bettors new options such as enhanced same-game parlays and a free $100,000 survivor pool, among others.</p>
<p>As noted, one of the highlights of the app includes a free $100,000 survivor pool, allowing players to enter a free-to-play Survivor Pool that features a grand prize of $100,000. Per the rules, all BetMGM customers are allowed one entry for free via the app and can select one team that will win each week. "Once a winning team is selected, they cannot be picked the remainder of the season. The last customer(s) standing will take home the jackpot," explains a statement released by BetMGM.</p>
<p>Additionally, the improved BetMGM app marks the return of 8-Bit Barry, a new free-to-play game featuring the operator's Celebrity Ambassador, Barry Sanders. Bettors and sports fans alike can participate in the game every week and secure prizes such as same-game parlay insurance tokens, bonus bets, odds boost tokens and more.</p>
<p>BetMGM's sports betting app brings enhanced first-bet offers for new customers as well. The app offers two different options for first-time players during this football season. Such players can either bet $10 on any football game and instantly receive $200 in bonus bets or place up to $1,500 on their first bet and have the money paid back in the form of bonus bets if their bet is a losing one.</p>
<p>Adam Greenblatt, BetMGM's CEO, shared his excitement about the improved app. He pointed out: "We developed our state-of-the-art sports betting platform to feature a variety of ways sports fans can engage." Additionally, Greenblatt noted: "The next generation of the BetMGM app is a giant step forward in the sports betting experience, increasing the level of entertainment before, during and after games."</p>
<p>The improved sports betting app delivers an exclusive team partner hometown odds boost. This feature, fueled by BetMGM's team partnerships, offers an exclusive 50% live odds boost token for sports bettors. The leading betting operator explained that such wagers need to be placed in the states for specific teams, such as the Tennessee Titans, New York Jets, Detroit Lions, Denver Broncos, Baltimore Ravens and Arizona Cardinals.</p>
<p>Another important feature offered by BetMGM's app is Same-Game Parlay+, an engaging option that enables bettors to combine same-game parlays to create "one super parlay."</p>
