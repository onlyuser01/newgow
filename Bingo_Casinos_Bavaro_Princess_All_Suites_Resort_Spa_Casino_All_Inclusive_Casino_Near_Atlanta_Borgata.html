<p>Comscore, a global media measurement and analytics firm, has posted interesting insight into the use of social media, to wit Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram by the gambling and lotteries industries in the United Kingdom. The results showed that the companies from the sector were able to reach 29 million people on the three platforms, with 15.5 million actions generated cross-platform.</p>
<p>Camscore offered a detailed breakdown of which UK properties across the two sectors had performed best, basing the insights on data collected in January 2023. The analytics firm noted that despite the challenges of the past years, and the pending regulatory review that will enact widespread changes in the gambling framework of the country, the industry continues to grow and engage with more people.</p>
<p>The company took into consideration three main factors for ten prominent gambling brands in the country, including actions, actions per cost, and audience or followers.</p>
<p>Top Properties Actions (CP) Actions Per Cost (CP) LiveScore 13,211,629 9,437 Paddy Power 1,114,716 912 PokerStars 185,528 947 Bet365 191,041 106 Sky Bet 151,739 612 William Hill 103,937 140 Dream Team 95,198 421 Andyâ€™s Bet Club 79,869 250 Bad Man Betting 67,045 139</p>
<p>The Comscore data is viable for the leading entities in the market, but also other companies which are looking to revitalize their own social media presence and standing in a bid to elicit a stronger engagement with their followers. Not all have been that successful, though. For example, Dream Team has a massive following of 3,613,671 accounts but it has elicited only 95,198 actions.</p>
<p>Dream Team is the entity with the second-biggest following from the sector, but it still trails the companies in second and third place in terms of actions, Paddy Power and Poker Stars who had 1,114,716 and 185,528 actions to their names respectively. The company to successfully elicit the most actions and drive the strongest audience numbers during the month was LiveScore which stood at 4,212,046 followers and 13,211,628 actions.</p>
<p>The actions metric applies to the number of followers the companies had in January at the time when the data was collected. Actions refer to reactions, comments, retweets, favorites, loves, and shares, Camscore explained in the press release.</p>
