<p>Los Angeles Rams vs Kansas City Chiefs is the biggest game of Week 12. This is a clash between the reigning Super Bowl champions (Los Angeles Rams) and one of the biggest favorites to win the Lombardi Trophy in February (Kansas City Chiefs).</p>
<p>Even though bookies see the Chiefs as huge favorites in Sunday’s game, we believe this is going to be a real thriller of a game. The Rams might be 3-7 in 2022, but we know they tend to show up in big games. Plus, they seem to love playing against Kansas City.</p>

<p>Sean McVay’s Men Need to End Their Losing Run ASAP</p>
<p>According to the New York Times, the Rams chance of making the playoffs is just 3%. They are 3-7 on the season, coming to Arrowhead after four straight losses. In those four games, we saw their offense play anemic football, scoring no more than 20 points per game.</p>
<p>That wouldn’t be that horrible if their defense was better. Last season, it was their strongest point, but in 2022, the Rams are conceding 22.7 points per game. That makes their defense 17th in the league.</p>
<p>The good news for them is that the Chiefs are even worse when it comes to the defense. The bad news for the Rams is that the Chiefs are much, much better in the offense.</p>
<p>The Chiefs are fantastic in the offense, scoring 30.0 points per game. That makes them the no.1 offense in the league. Thanks to Patrick Mahomes (QB), Travis Kelce (TE), and others, the Chiefs have been able to win eight games this season, while losing only two.</p>
<p>They didn’t, however, cover the spread too many times this season. In their most recent game, they defeated the Los Angeles Chargers by just a field goal.</p>
<p>The reason behind this is that the Chiefs’ defense hasn’t been as impressive as their offense. In fact, with 23.3 points conceded per game on average, their defense ranks 21st in the league.</p>
<p>Los Angeles Rams vs Kansas City Chiefs Prediction</p>
<p>The Rams are fantastic in 2022, especially in games played at Arrowhead. That said, we expect them to win on Sunday, although not by a huge margin. Right now, the spread is set to 15.5 points, which we think is way too much.</p>
<p>Picks: Kansas City Chiefs to win but not cover the spread; over 44 points</p>
