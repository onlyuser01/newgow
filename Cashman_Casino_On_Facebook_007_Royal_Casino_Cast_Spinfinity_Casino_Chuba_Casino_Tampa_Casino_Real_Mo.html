<p>Information about craps casinos</p>
<p>The roll of dice has fascinated humans for millennia, ever since we fashioned the first primitive versions out of animal bones.</p>
<p>Craps is one of the most popular modern-day dice games, and a casino is often the setting for it. Traditionally, this has been on the green craps table in a bricks-and-mortar casino, but the digital age has led to online casino versions of craps becoming more prevalent.</p>
<p>This page is dedicated to helping you find the best online casino sites that allow you to play online craps for real money.</p>
<p>With the help of Casino Guru's review and rating system, you'll learn how to pick out the top craps sites according to which features they offer, whether it's a generous bonus or a wide range of games.</p>

<p>The best online craps casinos reviewed and rated by experts</p>
<p>Looking through every casino that offers online craps gambling is an exhausting process: in many cases, you have to register just to get an idea of what a site offers.</p>
<p>Casino Guru has done the hard work for you by reviewing and rating each site according to strict, objective criteria. Our team of experts has considered several important factors to arrive at a special Safety Index rating, so you can get an accurate summary of each casino at a glance.</p>
<p>That way, you can just start with our list of recommended sites, so that you have the best chance of an enjoyable experience.</p>
<p>Here are some of the things we look at when reviewing an online casino, whether it has craps or not.</p>
<p>Terms and conditions While it's crucial to know the T&amp;Cs of a casino you sign up for, actually reading through them is a tedious process. We've taken the time to study the small print and pick out what we don't like to warn you. Better to be safe than sorry! Casino size and revenue It's a simple fact that a casino with high revenue levels is more likely to pay out big wins. They're also less likely to fold and take your money with them. Customer service Treating players well should be an absolute minimum for online casinos, but it's surprising how many sites neglect this. We'll root out those who have a bad reputation for this and let you know. Positive aspects We don't want to focus just on the negatives. Good things that casinos do will also feature in our rating.</p>
<p>Note: If you'd like to know more about our assessment process, then our How we review casinos guide will give you the lowdown on the whole procedure.</p>
<p>How to choose the best online casino for craps</p>
<p>We've spoken about how our casino rating and review system will allow you to locate the sites that our team of experts recommends. You can see these when the 'Recommended' tab is selected on this page, and we advise you to start your casino search with these.</p>
<p>But you may want to apply other preferences to the list, so that you can pinpoint the casinos that match your own personal taste.</p>
<p>Some players love new casinos, for example, and selecting the 'Newly opened' tab will show these.</p>
<p>Here are some other important filters you can also apply.</p>
<p>Deposit method Good casinos should have plenty of payment methods for you to choose from, but you can make sure you get only those with your preferred provider by using this filter. Note: You don't have to play online craps casinos for money, of course. Our free craps games page has several options for you to choose from without you needing to deposit a cent. Game provider While there are relatively few craps providers out there, you may want craps sites to also have slots games by the likes of Red Tiger or Microgaming. This filter will help you find those. Currency If you prefer to make your deposit in your local currency to save conversion fees, then this filter will let you select your preference. Licensing Authority Established licensing authorities like the Gambling Commission (GC) and the Malta Gaming Authority (MGA) are proof that the casino subscribes to quality standards. You can find the craps casinos that hold them here.</p>
<p>How online craps works</p>
<p>Traditionally, craps was a game where you simply bet on the outcomes of two six-sided dice.</p>
<p>Players take it in turns to roll, and the game is divided into two parts. The first, known as the 'come-out', involves the player (or 'shooter') rolling the dice, the outcome of which determines whether the game continues into a second part, known as 'the point'.</p>
<p>Online craps is just a digital version of the classic game, but there are several variations from the original. Some of these include bonus games and features which involve extra challenges, while others are just a virtual graphic of a player throwing two dice from a cup.</p>
<p>Many versions also feature a classic Craps table that players use in real-life casinos. Like roulette, this has different betting areas for players to place their chips when betting. There's also a long section where the 'shooter' can roll the dice.</p>
<p>Craps strategies</p>
<p>Craps is a dice game and therefore a game of chance. As such, luck plays a huge role and it's almost impossible to come up with an effective strategy.</p>
<p>That said, there is one way of limiting the amount we lose: responsible gambling measures. Following these important principles may not land you huge wins, but it will help you guard against heavy losses and potential problem gambling behavior in the future.</p>
<p>Note: Our How to gamble safely page has a detailed summary of safe gambling measures we should all take, and we recommend that every player reads it before playing for money.</p>
