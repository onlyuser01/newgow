<p>Leader in data and AI technology Stats Perform announced today its existing partnership with Bayer Leverkusen has expanded to include access to Edge Analysis for the football club from the top-flight German Bundesliga.</p>
<p>Dynamic Insights into Opponents</p>
<p>Edge Analysis, a sophisticated match preparation tool, utilizes unique AI models powered by tracking and event data to provide predictive insights with regards to pre- and post-match analysis, as well as deliver objective performance evaluation on all opponents.</p>
<p>“We are delighted to be enhancing existing processes currently in place at Bayer 04 Leverkusen, and supporting them with access to unique insights delivered through our patented AI models that can only be found in Edge Analysis.” Stephan Hanke, VP, Sales in Europe, Stats Perform</p>
<p>Edge Analysis uses over 100 AI-driven key performance metrics (KPIs) to deliver dynamic insights complemented with video within seconds, operating within 8 patented AI models. The platform provides insights related to a team’s playing characteristics, in-play changing shape and formation, ball progression patterns, as well as individual player’s contribution to the creation of goal-scoring opportunities.</p>
<p>Besides event data from Stats Perform, the platform provided for Bayer Leverkusen would include integrated tracking data provided by the official German Bundesliga data provider Sportec Solutions.</p>
<p>Predictive Analysis Is the Future</p>
<p>Marcel Daum, co-trainer analyst in the Sport Department at Bayer Leverkusen, noted his previous experience with the team at Stats Perform during his 14th year in professional football and welcomed the addition of the Edge Analysis platform.</p>
<p>“Edge Analysis enables us to take the step from descriptive analysis to predictive analysis, which I think is the future of performance analysis in football. This is what makes Edge Analysis different from other industry tools, and it was the main factor in our decision to work with the platform.” Marcel Daum, Co-Trainer Analyst, Sports Department, Bayer Leverkusen</p>
<p>The most sophisticated football analysis tool provided by Stats Perform is already utilized by football clubs from the French Ligue 1 and Italian Serie A. In France, Stade Rennais, the club which achieved Champions League qualification for the first time in its history during the 2019/20 season, used the Edge Analysis platform throughout the whole historical season for the team and its fans.</p>
<p>Last year, Stats Perform entered into a data partnership with the Women’s Tennis Association (WTA), and signed a 10-year distribution deal with the European Handball Federation (EHF), to affirm its position as a global supplier of AI sport solutions.</p>
