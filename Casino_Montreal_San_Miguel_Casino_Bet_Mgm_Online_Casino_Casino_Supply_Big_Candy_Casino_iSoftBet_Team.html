    <h1>Casino Montreal San Miguel Casino Bet Mgm Online Casino Casino Supply Big Candy Casino iSoftBet Team</h1>

<p>IGT PlayDigital brand iSoftBet has struck a new landmark partnership with Lowen Play, an established company in the German brick-and-mortar gaming business. iSoftBet, though, will be deploying products with Lowen Play’s Spanish online casino platform, to wit LowenPlay.es. This platform is built entirely to cater to the needs of Spanish players who are interested in accessing games by top-tier operators.</p>
<p>iSoftBet to Launch Games in Spain with Lowen Play</p>
<p>Lowen Play has been available on the Spanish market since early 2021 and has been gradually growing its momentum and footprint in the country. The latest partnership with iSoftBet will help improve the company’s standing and add excellent products by a company that has been able to penetrate some of the most challenging European markets in recent months.</p>
<p>Commenting on this partnership, iSoftBet head of business development Lars Kollind welcomed Lowen Play’s well-established business model in the casino gaming space and said this opportunity would enable iSoftBet to pursue further expansion in the Spanish market.</p>
<p>Kollind and iSoftBet will be looking forward to positive feedback from the Spanish entry and assess how their products are received. In fact, Lowen Play’s offer has so far enjoyed good reception by local players. Meanwhile, Lowen Play head of operations Sera Klimper added that the company had big hopes for the iSoftBet portfolio of games, hoping the products will be well-received by the company.</p>
<p>IGT finalized the acquisition of iSoftBet earlier in July. The company purchased iSoftBet to continue building up its digital footprint for the price total of €160 million and has been ambitiously looking to grow its reach in new markets.</p>
<p>iSoftBet has continued to release ambitious slot games, with Aztec Gold Mines and Rise of the Genie in recent weeks. iSoftBet remains committed to scaling its offer across Europe and helping tier-one partners establish a stronger foothold in the important markets through the firm’s regulation-ready and player-favorite games.</p>
