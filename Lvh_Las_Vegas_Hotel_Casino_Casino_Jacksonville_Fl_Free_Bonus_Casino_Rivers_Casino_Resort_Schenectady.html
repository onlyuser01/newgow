<p>With not one word written, NFL star Tom Brady’s book is already a bestseller. On Thursday, the Patriot’s quarterback announced he was penning a tome on helping people live healthier lifestyles and it went to No. 1 in two categories on Amazon.</p>

<p>The TB12 Method: How to Achieve a Lifetime of Sustained Peak Performance is Brady’s attempt to show people his revolutionary approach to his training and exercise regimen that he claims decreases the risk of injury while extending peak performance for any athlete. He also is going to weave in his own story about how it has personally helped him.</p>
<p>Simon and Shuster is the publisher and has a Sept. 19th release date. The cost is $29.99 for a hardcover, $14.99 for a Kindle edition.</p>
<p>Shortly after the news of the proposed book broke, Amazon reported that it was tops in both the Best Seller category and Sports and Outdoors.</p>
<p>Book Details Revealed</p>
<p>The book has been nicknamed, “The Athlete’s Bible,” and the author reveals principles behind his approach to how he eats, exercises and lives.</p>
<p>It also maps out more effective approaches to strength training, hydration, nutrition, supplementation, cognitive fitness, recovery, and other lifestyle choices that dramatically decrease the risk of injury while amplifying and extending performance, as well as quality of life.</p>
<p>Brady took to Instagram to tell people this book isn’t just for athletes.</p>
<p>“So for anyone who’s ever wondered why I feel better today than when I was 25, I’ve got something for you,” Brady wrote. “Whether you’re a high school, college, or pro athlete, a coach, a farmer, an executive, a teacher, a doctor, a student, a parent, a graphic designer, ANYONE – I know the methods in this book can be a blueprint to better understanding how to maintain peak mental and physical fitness for the rest of your life.”</p>
<p>Building Fitness Empire</p>
<p>This is the second writing effort from the future Hall of Famer. He penned a cookbook last year that despite a $200 price tag, sold out its first printing. The manual showed his very strict and specific diet, which eliminates most meat and is 80 percent vegetables.</p>
<p>It is part of a website that Brady and his trainer, Alex Guerrero, started that incorporates all facets of health he believes are vital to his success.</p>
<p>There is a section on fitness that has everything from $140 weighted vests to $90 medicine balls. Another area is nutrition where budding athletes can subscribe to a meal service for $68 a week.</p>
<p>Also available are $40 for a box of 12 protein bars or a $54 can of protein powder. The two even promote a section on brain exercises to help with age-related cognitive decline.</p>
<p>Guerrero is not without controversy, however. The Federal Trade Commission filed a complaint against him in 2004 for misrepresenting himself as a doctor on an infomercial that was selling a nutritional supplement that he claimed cured people with terminal diseases.</p>
<p>He settled with the agency a year later, paying a fine and agreeing not to promote the product.</p>
