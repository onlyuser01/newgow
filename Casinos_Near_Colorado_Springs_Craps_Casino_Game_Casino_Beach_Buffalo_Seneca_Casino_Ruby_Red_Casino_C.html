<p>Hi Kamil,</p>
<p>I hope this email finds you well.</p>
<p>We regret to inform you that we had to block your account due to several, repeated breaches of our Terms And Conditions:</p>
<p>3.4.a Sportsbook platform reserves the right to cancel and refund bets placed by players which are reported by our external provider as professional players, where any collusion or arbitrage betting patterns are detected, this will also lead to a permanent and final ban.</p>
<p>3.25. In case of suspicion of unfair wrestling, the Sportsbook platform reserves the right to refuse any bet in general or any part of it, thus making the questionable bet invalid (in these cases, the payment is made with a factor equal to "1") or completion of proceedings or up to 31 calendar days</p>
<p>3.26. Clients are allowed to bet only as individuals, group bets are not allowed. Repeated bets on the same results/winners from the same or different customers may subsequently be declared invalid. Even after the official result of the competition/athletes is already known, the Sportsbook platform may consider the indicated bets invalid if it considers that the Clients act in collusion or as a syndicate, or the bets considered were made by one or more Clients within a short period of time. The betting company also has the right to refuse to accept bets or to count already made bets as invalid if they are made from different game accounts from the same IP address.</p>
<p>We will refund you the last 400 Euro in deposits to your BTC address - 12RNpT7ViiUvurVhwSAnDWDWJMiZJKhmQG</p>
<p>This decision is permanent and irreversible.</p>
<p>We wish you all the best.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Tom Johnson</p>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>This is what I received today from Chipstars. Unfortunatelly , bad opinion at trustpilot was confirmed today. They steal money ot their customers. This is real SCAM casino . Of course, I didn't broke any point of this terms&amp;conditions . If I was a cheater , they never bring me my part of deposits back. This is nonsense. You can't promote casino like this , there is many many other gambling websites which are fair in front of their clients. You have to help clean this enviroment from the scamers like Chipstars. In the opposite your opinion among players will be worst and worst.</p>
<p>Don't you think they should give me back my whole deposits ? WHy only part ? I was cheater or not ? Or maybe one time I was fair and later I cheated them ? This is a big nonsense.</p>
