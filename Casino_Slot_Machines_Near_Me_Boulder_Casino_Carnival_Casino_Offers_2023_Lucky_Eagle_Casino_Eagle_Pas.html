<p>CEO of the freeplay and real money sports betting game provider talks about player acquisition in the fast-growing US market</p>
<p>Daniel Kustelski, currently CEO of Chalkline, has previously run a sportsbook and an ADW. He has a clear understanding of how hard it is to build and retain a healthy player database. Daniel shared his perspectives on customer acquisition in “Phase Two” of sports betting in America with Gambling News.</p>
<p>Q: What’s working in acquisition right now, and how will strategies and tactics change over time?</p>
<p>Localization is table stakes to play, and personalization is delivering outsized returns.</p>
<p>The first phase of “sports betting in the USA” was really about market access and getting products up that worked, period.</p>
<p>What we’re seeing now in phase two, if you will, is a sharper focus on the player. What they like, introducing new products and helping the market mature in a way that’s consistent with other markets.</p>
<p>What that means from an acquisition perspective: give the players what they want.</p>
<p>Favorite teams, favorite bets, favorite experiences. The books that are “listening” to players are personalizing and starting to get traction.</p>
<p>Q: Do you see demand for acquisition tools coming from established players in the industry?</p>
<p>Absolutely. If there’s something that will help a book get ahead, they’ll do it.</p>
<p>Established players have a lot on their plate, there’s no doubt about it. New states rolling out, technology demands, local regulations and so on.</p>
<p>That said, new players drive the perceived success of every quarterly report. As long as that number continues to grow, most operators feel they’re ‘directionally correct’.</p>
<p>Q: How has consumer and social behavior shaped the vision for Chalkline?</p>
<p>The past year has driven screen time through the roof, and that’s the biggest trend in consumer behavior. More people consuming more content and more ads.</p>
<p>For social media, we have seen new channels and new educational opportunities. You can quickly lose a day watching ‘sports betting explainer videos’ on Tik Tok.</p>
<p>For ad tech, we are seeing new ways to deliver personalized ads and products to a range of consumers. We’ve always been fans of our friends at Fresh8 and their marketing automation platform, and they’ve really taken personalization to the next level.</p>
<p>Q: With much of the media focus on B2C brands, what is the opportunity for B2B platform plays like Chalkline?</p>
<p>Games-as-a-Service platforms like our BettorGames are offering an additional set of tools to operators and media companies during the customer land grab that’s happening right now.</p>
<p>Having run a book, I can tell you this: innovation is hard when you’re settling bets and managing customer service.</p>
<p>Product calendars take a back seat to the day-to-day responsibilities of managing customers, regulators, etc.</p>
<p>What we see from several of the start-up platform plays, like ourselves, is that we’re filling in important gaps in the ecosystem as the iGaming industry grows out in a number of directions, at a pretty rapid pace.</p>
<p>Q: How do you see the next several years playing out in the US sports betting market?</p>
<p>It’s going to be pretty interesting. We are going to see more regulated states and more states offering more gaming products.</p>
<p>We think you’ll see online casino regulation take off pretty quickly.</p>
<p>Also, on the player side, we’ll see more conversations about responsible gaming, player protections and best practices for player education.</p>
<p>All of this is particularly important and welcome.</p>
<p>Q: Do you foresee new entrants emerging in the US market?</p>
<p>Absolutely! We often say: “It’s the first quarter of sports betting in America.”</p>
<p>Look back a year and who saw Bally’s putting together a lot of the pieces of a full iGaming offering? But they’ve done exactly that.</p>
<p>I think they’re a good example of how quickly a group with capital and a vision can start putting together a plan. And it’s early days. We’ll see more entrants soon.</p>
