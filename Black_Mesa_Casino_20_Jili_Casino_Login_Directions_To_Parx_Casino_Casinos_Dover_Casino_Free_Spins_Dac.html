    <h1>Black Mesa Casino 20 Jili Casino Login Directions To Parx Casino Casinos Dover Casino Free Spins Dac</h1>

<p>I deposited 225 euros at dachbet on October 28th, 2022 with a 100 percent bonus.</p>
<p>it is the 4th welcome bonus.</p>
<p>CODE:DBETWEL225</p>
<p>https://dachbet1.com/de/promotions/welcome-package</p>
<p>After successful implementation, I applied for a payment of 2253 euros on October 28th, 2022.</p>
<p>Then I received an email that I had to pay 8 percent fees because I had a different payment recently:</p>
<p>Dear Jorg,</p>
<p>As per our site's general rules, section "3. Account and Personal Information", point 3.13.1 Multiple withdrawals performed within a 30-day time frame will be charged with a fee of up to 8% of the withdrawal amount.</p>
<p>With regards to the above, your current pending withdrawal is subject to 8% fees</p>
<p>So I decided to cancel the payment and apply again later.</p>
<p>I then applied again on November 29, 2022 for the payment of 2253 euros.</p>
<p>a few days later i got the message when i logged into my casino account:</p>
<p>your payout was declined because bonus manipulation was detected.</p>
<p>I didn't get my deposit of 225 euros back, as is usually the case.</p>
<p>Since I only played 1 game with my bonus (which was allowed according to the bonus conditions) and never changed the stake or the game, I did not commit any bonus manipulation from my point of view. That's why I'm submitting this complaint.</p>
<p>When I applied for the payout for the first time, they wanted to pay me out with - 8 percent fees and now all of a sudden I should have committed a bonus manipulation.</p>
<p>it's not my first withdrawal and i'm fully verified.</p>
<p>with the 2nd welcome bonus DBETWEL250 75 percent up to 250 euros I deposited 300 euros on October 24th, 2022 and the payout of 2250 euros was successfully carried out.</p>
<p>with this bonus i played the same game as with the 4th bonus (where i was suddenly accused of bonus manipulation)</p>
<p>and also exactly the same use that I have never changed</p>
