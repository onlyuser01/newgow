<p>Pragmatic Play, the top-tier iGaming content developer has decided to expand its portfolio and finally launch its first sportsbook, following plans to become the one-stop-shop for all operators in the gaming industry. The new sportsbook will take the provider’s vertical count to five, with live casino, slots, virtual sports, and bingo already in the bag.</p>
<p>What Will Pragmatic Play’s Sportsbook Offer?</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play’s vice president of sportsbook Gareth Crook believes the new vertical will nicely accentuate the company’s aim to become the leading content provider in the sector. The company’s sportsbook vertical team has spent several months working hard to build a new product that will rely on a single application programming interface.</p>
<p>The interface will use templates to provide excellent betting experiences to worldwide players. The new platform will provide customers with targeted sports betting content that will perfectly match their location with the help of a special content management system. Customers from all parts of the world will be able to freely access the platform thanks to the multi-language translation service that Pragmatic Play will incorporate into the sportsbook.</p>
<p>Sports aficionados will access a great variety of sporting events, competitions, and different markets in all parts of the world, including big events like the English Premier League, the National Football League, the National Basketball Association, and the Association of Tennis Professionals.</p>
<p>Will the New Vertical Rise to the Expectations?</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play’s new sportsbook vertical launch can be considered a late entry into the market. However, the company’s experienced team is expected to have a critical contribution to ensuring its success. The new vertical will be powered by industry veterans and executives with dozens of years of experience under their belt working for important Business-to-Consumer operators.</p>
<p>Plus, several markets worldwide have already expressed their interest in the new product, which is another good indicator of its potential success. In February, Pragmatic Play managed to double its live casino offering through new speed baccarat, baccarat, and blackjack tables, while partnering with BPlay as a way of further growth in the Argentinean and Buenos Aires markets.</p>
<p>The company’s chief business development officer Yossi Barzely considers the launch of the sportsbook an “incredibly proud moment”, adding that Pragmatic Play is interested in adding new verticals provided they can help them make a difference. By introducing the new sports betting vertical to its portfolio, the provider will get closer to its goal of offering an all-inclusive solution for all iGaming operators.</p>
<p>Will Pragmatic Play’s new sportsbook vertical manage to replicate the success of its online casino products with hit titles like Wolf Gold and Dog House? Could the decision spread the supplier a little too thin across all verticals? It remains to be seen.</p>
