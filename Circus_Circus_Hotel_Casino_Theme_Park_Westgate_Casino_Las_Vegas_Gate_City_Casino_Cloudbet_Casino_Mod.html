<p>Data management, video streaming, and integrity services provider Genius Sports has extended its pre-existing deals with operators BetMGM and Entain.</p>
<p>Genius Sports Expands Its Agreements</p>
<p>As part of the expanded deals, Genius Sports will offer its two partners new National Football League data feeds, engagement solutions, and sportsbook offerings.</p>
<p>Genius Sports’ chief executive officer, Mark Locke, has spoken on the renewed and expanded deals. He revealed that deals with important partners such as BetMGM and Entain are what has kept Genius on the top of its field for over a decade.</p>
<p>“I’m thrilled that we are expanding our historic agreement to connect millions of sportsbook customers in the U.S. and worldwide with our premium NFL offering, powered by the highest quality official data,” Locke said.</p>
<p>BetMGM’s chief executive officer, Adam Greenblatt, revealed that the operator truly relies on Genius Sports for one of the best data feeds in the whole industry. Greenblatt believes that the combo between Genius Sports’ data and BetMGM’s unique platform and the user interface is a force to be reckoned with. Greenblatt is sure that the partnership will help the two parties deliver a best-in-class gambling experience to the customers.</p>
<p>Pursuing Market Expansion</p>
<p>The new extended deal builds on Genius Sports’ presence in the sports market. The data management company has had over ten years of collaborative relations with Entain and its subsidiary brands Ladbrokes, bwin and Coral. The newly expanded partnership will see Genius Sports renew its efforts of providing the best data to important sports leagues.</p>
<p>Some of Genius Sports offerings cover the Euroleague Basketball, the English Premier League, the Liga MX as well as Colombia and Argentine’s soccer leagues. It just partnered with GNOG which gave the latter access to some of the data manager’s exclusive services.</p>
<p>As BetMGM was recently named as NFL’s officially approved sportsbook, the extended partnership will see Genius Sports providing NFL data as well. This will include official statistics, official betting data feed, and next-gen stats. Genius Sports will provide a full offering that updates news on player acquisitions and provides both pre-match and in-game betting.</p>
<p>BetMGM is owned by MGM Resorts and Entain. The operator is quickly expanding its presence on the US market and is extending its reach to states that have freshly launched sports betting markets. The gambling operator recently got a license for operating on Wyoming and Arizona’s sports betting market that just launched in September. As licenses are still limited, BetMGM will have a tremendous opportunity of establishing and differentiating itself ahead of its competitors. More recently, BetMGM entered South Dakota’s market through recent market-access deals.</p>
