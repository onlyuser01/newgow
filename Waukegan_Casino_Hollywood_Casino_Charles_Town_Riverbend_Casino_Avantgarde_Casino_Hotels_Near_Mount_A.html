    <h1>Waukegan Casino Hollywood Casino Charles Town Riverbend Casino Avantgarde Casino Hotels Near Mount A</h1>

<p>The casino offers bonuses for deposits, in total I have deposited €110 (40+20+50) and the casino has given me a 100% bonus on the first and third deposit and 50% on the second, that is, an extra €100! !</p>
<p>Playing I have managed to reach €370, I have proceeded to withdraw money and I have observed that I could only collect 50 and that is what I did! For the rest, there was a sentence on the right saying, active bonuses! So I decided to deactivate the bonuses...what was my surprise?? When deactivating those bonuses, they withdrew the €312, the account was left at zero!</p>
<p>They tell me that neither money is connected to those bonuses and it cannot be recovered, that this money has already been lost!</p>
<p>What I can do?? It is very unfair, I understand that they can take away the extra received, but also my deposits and the profits generated? That is abusive!!! It should be possible to rectify it somehow or reach an agreement...</p>
