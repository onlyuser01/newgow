    <h1>Carnival Casino Offers 2023 Rio All Suite Hotel Casino Reviews Ocean Casino Spa Brand New Sweeps Cas</h1>

<p>I am writing today in hopes that you will assist me in obtaining my recent jackpot winnings from Everygame Casino.</p>
<p>I was incredibly fortunate enough to hit the big $67k jackpot while playing the Mine All Mine slots on Everygame Casino last Saturday night (one week ago). I was absolutely overjoyed and overwhelmed by this win because it is literally going to change my life. The last two years have been a living nightmare for me after suffering a stroke, losing my high-paying job, being homeless, having my fiance almost die in a car accident...and the list goes on. We have hospital/doctor bill collectors calling every day, all day and night. And we are also currently living in a tiny rented home that isn't compatible at all with my fiance's wheelchair mobility/needs.</p>
<p>This money will finally enable us to move into a larger, handicapped accessible home and also give us an opportunity to pay off some of our bills and stop the constant harassment from the collectors.</p>
<p>Sadly, though, our excitement and joy has turned into even more stress, frustration and worry because Everygame Casino has not responded to even ONE of my repeated attempts and pleas for them to simply answer me about what my next steps are and how I can retrieve my winnings.</p>
<p>I joined the casino earlier this year in February, and in March, I needed to verify my account in order to be able to use certain forms of payment (credit cards) and also have them remove the deposit restrictions that were on my account at the time. They told me to send pictures of my photo ID and proof of address, which I did, and then my account was verified and all restrictions lifted.</p>
<p>Since March, I've deposited a a good amount of money into the casino in hopes I would win big and get a new lease on life and a second chance to be happy again. I never had any issues redeeming bonuses, getting my birthday bonus last month, depositing from various credit cards and losing my hard earned and limited money to them... but now, when it's time for ME to actually collect money from THEM, instead of them taking money from me, my account has now been mysteriously UN-verified and I'm being completely ignored??</p>
<p>I have not received even one word of response from any department within the casino.... not even an automated response acknowledging my messages. Absolutely nothing. Complete silence. Not one word... which leaves me nothing else to believe but that they are a total scam site that steals money from their loyal and trusting customers, and has no intention of honoring my winnings.</p>
<p>I was told by a live chat representative right after my win that all I had to do was verify my account again and play through the $2k bonus requirement I had at the time, and then my winnings would be free and clear for me to withdrawal.</p>
<p>But sadly that has not been the case at all... I actually played more than the $2k requirement they demanded since then (and I'm so mad at myself for doing that ughhhh) but fortunately I still have a full $60k sitting in my account... but I'm unable to withdrawal it and it's only available to put back in for them to steal.</p>
<p>I am so crushed, defeated and heartbroken... I was so relieved and excited a week ago and really believed things were turning around for us, but it's just more disappointments and deadends. So, thank you in advance for any assistance you can provide.</p>
<p>Also, I received an email this morning from Everygame Casino News informing me that I placed #61 in their Flower Power promotion and my winnings are a $75 cash bonus and to go to the cashier online to redeem it. So, they can contact me no problem about placing in their contest and winning $75, but they are continuing to completely ignore me (it's been 9 days now) about my $67,000 win??? Unbelievable.</p>
