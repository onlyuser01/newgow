    <h1>Atlantic City Casinos Map Free Casino Wind Creek Casino Bethlehem Bay 101 Casino San Jose California</h1>

<p>Made 3 deposits using crypto currency and while I did not click on any bonus a bonus with wagering requirements was added each time. I met the wagering requirements by just playing slots and decided to withdraw the 190.00. I was informed the withdrawl would take 5 days to go through their accounting department. After 5 days I received the following email, "Hello,We hope this email finds you well.Kindly note that your withdrawal was declined and the winnings voided since your account is in breach of our Terms and Conditions item 2.5.7. Bonuses offered by our casino are intended for genuine recreational players only. Abuse of any bonus offer will not be tolerated. We reserve the right to investigate, cancel, suspend or lock any account if bonus abuse is suspected. If an account is confirmed to fall under the Bonus Abuse category, we reserve the right to void all winnings generated on the account. Examples of bonus or promotion abuse, but are not limited to: claiming free bonuses that exceed a 3:1 bonus to deposit ratio (free bonuses include but are not limited to Free Spins, Calendar bonuses, Scratch Card bonuses, Tournament prizes, Race prizes, Mailer bonuses, Goodwill bonuses awarded by account managers, etc.)The account has been labeled as a bonus abuser and in consequence the funds have been voided." In no way did I abuse anything and upon trying to clarify this with their support all the agent could do was repeat that to me over and over when I asked for specifics of how I could possibly have abused anything when all I did was deposit money, they automatically applied the bonuses and play slots. Upon further review it seems like this casino is 100 percent a scam I wasn't able to find one story of someone having a successful withdrawl from winning. They also have obviously fake planted reviews littered throughout Google. Avoid this company they are evil scammers and I feel dumb for having been scammed by them.</p>
