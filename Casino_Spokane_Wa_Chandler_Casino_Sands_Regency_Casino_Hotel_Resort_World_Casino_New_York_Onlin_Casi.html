<p>The new office location is expected to help propel Honore's growth within the African region</p>
<p>The leading platform provider and technology company powering land-based, online casino and sports betting operators, Honore Gaming, expanded further its global footprint after opening a new office. On Tuesday, the company confirmed it grew further its presence in the African market by opening a new state-of-the-art office.</p>
<p>The new office, Honore Gaming said, is located in Dakar, Senegal’s capital. The state-of-the-art office facility will play a pivotal role in the company’s expansion in the region. Moreover, it will enable Honore Gaming to continue to grow its footprint and provide more operators within the gambling vertical with its leading technology and solutions.</p>
<p>Christophe Casanova, Honore Gaming’s COO, shared his excitement about the latest announcement. He explained that the company is excited to expand further its presence in Africa by opening its new office location in Senegal.</p>
<p>“We are delighted to open an office in Senegal we continue to establish ourselves as the leading technology and platform provider in Africa.“ Christophe Casanova, COO at Honore Gaming</p>
<p>Casanova deemed the market in the country an important one for Honore and its partners. He acknowledged that the new office will help support the growth of the company and the services and solutions it delivers to online, as well as land-based gambling operators.</p>
<p>Honore’s COO added that the new office complements the positive momentum gained by the company by joining forces with new brands and operators within the African market. Finally, Casanova pointed out: “Our platform and suite of solutions have been designed specifically for Africa, allowing operators to deploy sportsbook and casino experiences that not only meet but exceed player expectations.”</p>
<p>To celebrate the opening of its new office in Dakar, Honore planned a ceremony. Besides employees of the company, including senior-level team members, representatives of Lonase, the country’s National Lottery operator, also attended the prestigious event. Further elevating the festive spirit, Youssou N’Dour, a popular singer from Senegal was also a part of the ceremony.</p>
<p>Currently, Honore Gaming has established a strong presence within the African region. Operators that offer online gambling, sportsbook services and even land-based operators within the region benefit from the company’s leading solutions. Primarily, the company focuses on French-speaking jurisdictions such as Senegal and Chad for example.</p>
<p>However, in addition to French-speaking markets, the new office in Senegal is expected to help the company enter new African markets, including English-speaking ones. At the same time, the company confirmed it is exploring other options for further expansion around the globe.</p>
