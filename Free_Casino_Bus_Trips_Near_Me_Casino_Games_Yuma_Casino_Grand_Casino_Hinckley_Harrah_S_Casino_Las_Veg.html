    <h1>Free Casino Bus Trips Near Me Casino Games Yuma Casino Grand Casino Hinckley Harrah S Casino Las Veg</h1>

<p>Hello! I would have to perform this since December 26, 2023, so I have written an email to monkaji at a specified email address that is on their own page under the self exclusion tab. I wrote that I would like to shut myself off from their site forever for games on their sites, but a few days later I get an email that mity mail could not deliver, as a game addict I didn't think much of it at first, at first I panicked a bit and didn't know what to do, I ended up playing on monkaji and gambling away even more money that I couldn't afford to lose. I break down and write once more to monakji to shut me down, but the same thing happens, my mail does not deliver. now I have tried all of them to unsubscribe me 2 times on the referred email that is on their site. it ends up being another relapse where even more money is gambled away. I need 1 more time to write to the specified email then I get the same message again that the email is not delivered, I panic and don't understand what is happening! now i have lost so much money and just want my account to be suspended as i already wanted on december 26th. i panic and start looking around the internet for another alternative email address for monkaji, i find one that i test, i send off an email explaining my situation and the whole picture of what's going on! I will also state that I think this is incredibly wrong of them to have a misleading email address on their website that does not work. i requested my deposits from 26th december 2023 to be refunded to my account as i find that this responsibility lies with monkaji and i would not be able to play on their site and lose this money if they did not give me the wrong email address. finally i got a response from them, but then only a response that my account has been closed, they totally ignore me about an answer why they have a wrong email address on their website and totally ignored me about my request for a refund on my. deposits. I wrote an email asking why they are ignoring all this, these emails have not been answered either! i am very unusually treated and still wish to contact monkaji with an explanation and an apology and a possible refund of my deposits from 26th december 2023! WARNING!!</p>
