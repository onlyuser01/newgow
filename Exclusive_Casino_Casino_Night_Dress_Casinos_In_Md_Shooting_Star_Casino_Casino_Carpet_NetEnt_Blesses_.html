    <h1>Exclusive Casino Casino Night Dress Casinos In Md Shooting Star Casino Casino Carpet NetEnt Blesses</h1>

<p>NetEnt continues with its quest to feature more Megaways titles on its portfolio, reinventing a beloved classic, Divine Fortune, as a Megaways title.</p>
<p>Divine Fortune Becomes Latest NetEnt Title to Feature Megaways</p>
<p>NetEnt’s classic Divine Fortune will now enjoy a fresh lease of life with the Megaways mechanic baked into the very fabric of the company’s unique slot experience. Divine Fortune is the latest of NetEnt’s long list of games to enjoy the addition of the transformative Megaways experience, which complements the release of Twin Spin Megaways earlier in November.</p>
<p>Divine Fortune comes with a hefty jackpot opportunity as well as 96.09% potential return-to-player (RTP) rate and a Greek Mythology theme. The game has it all, but now, thanks to the Megaways mechanic players will experience no fewer than 117,649 chances to win.</p>
<p>The game’s immense potential is boosted by the 4502x multiplier and a host of other features designed to bring joy every step of the way. There are the Falling Wilds Re-Spins and Wild-on-Wild Expansion Feature, Free Spins, and more.</p>
<p>Commenting on this experience, NetEnt Chief Commercial Officer Andy Whitworth had quite a few great things to say about the company’s newfound interest in Megaways titles. Whitworth argued that Divine Fortune now stands to benefit immensely from the combination of features, giving players a new way to win.</p>
<p>“Divine Fortune is one of the most popular titles in NetEnt history and it’s great to reignite the game with the thrilling addition of Megaways. Twin Spin Megaways is our best release so far in 2020, but early data from Divine Fortune Megaways shows that it might not be for long.” -NetEnt Chief Commercial Officer Andy Whitworth</p>
<p>Twin Spin Megaways and Feature Adoption</p>
<p>NetEnt already has experience with the Megaways feature, which long eluded one of the leading gaming providers. Now, though, the company is catching up quickly on what it considers to be a worthwhile addition to its gaming lineup.</p>
<p>Earlier in November, NetEnt re-released Twin Spin, adding the Megaways to the title in a bid to begin the long-and journey towards a brand-new feature. Originally created by Big Time Gaming (BTG), Megaways has quickly become a byword for excitement and a completely reimagine slot layout grid.</p>
<p>Twin Spin features just as many paylines, although the Megaways allow for a different number of maximum winning combinations. NetEnt seems to have gone with the maximum available option, adding it on top of multipliers, free spins, and other worthwhile gamification features.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, NetEnt has been quite busy. It recently launched Red Tiger Games in Pennsylvania and rolled proprietor live dealer baccarat. The company’s interim results have remained strong with the company showing resilience despite a rather tumultuous 2020.</p>
