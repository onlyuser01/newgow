<p>Illusionist Criss Angel Straightjacket Stunt Gone Wrong Underlines Dangerous Life of Las Vegas Performers</p>

<p>Criss Angel is today’s Harry Houdini, and like the man who inspired his work, the 49-year-old Las Vegas entertainer is no stranger to a straightjacket. But during a performance of his signature show “Mindfreak Live!” late last week at the Luxor, Angel blacked out during a straightjacket escape that took place just 15 minutes into the show.</p>

<p>Medical staff quickly attended to the famed headliner, and he was rushed to nearby Spring Valley Hospital and treated for dehydration. And just one night later, Angel was back on stage, doing the same stunt successfully.</p>
<p>Risky Business</p>
<p>But the incident underlines the reality that, “illusion” or not, what many Las Vegas entertainers (and others around the world) are willing to do for impact does come with inherent dangers.</p>
<p>“I really take risks with what I do onstage to bring to the public the most spectacular, amazing, mind-blowing, revolutionary magic experience you could possibly have,” Angel told Robin Leach of the Las Vegas Review-Journal a few days later. “I felt so bad that they canceled the show after I blacked out. I wanted to come back to do another show immediately.”</p>
<p>Critics of Angel panned the blackout news as yet another stunt to garner publicity. The New York native dispelled such claims and said that’s “absolutely ridiculous.” Rather, Angel insisted that poor eating and a lack of sleep was to blame.</p>
<p>Heading Back East</p>
<p>According to the Review-Journal, Angel has reached a contractual agreement with Foxwoods Resort Casino in Connecticut to begin a new show that will kick off next November.</p>
<p>Originally from Long Island, New York, the Foxwoods show will put Angel back on the East Coast, just 80 miles north of Manhattan. The entertainer has been stationed in Sin City since he launched “Criss Angel Believe” back in 2008, in conjunction with Cirque du Soleil.</p>
<p>But he’s never lost his love for New York. One of his most memorable career-defining moments came in 2002 in Times Square, when he spent 24 hours shackled in a phone booth-sized water torture cell.</p>
