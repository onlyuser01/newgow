    <h1>Hallmark Casino Nugget Casino Sparks Nv Duluth Casino The Mill Casino Hotel Rv Park New Orleans Casi</h1>

<p>In July, Bragg Gaming announced it would introduce its business-to-business gaming technology and content provider subsidiary Spin Games to the state of Connecticut. Now, the NASDAQ-listed group has announced that its content is live with one of Ontario’s top operators, Rush Street Interactive (RSI).</p>
<p>What Does the New Deal Mean for Bragg and RSI?</p>
<p>The launch of Bragg’s content on RSI’s online website and mobile app in the Canadian province represents an expansion of the agreement between the companies in North America. The same agreement features a few of Bragg’s games that have reached RSI platforms accessed by players in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey.</p>
<p>The new partnership expansion also marks a pioneering move in the dynamic between the two companies. The North American dual use of Bragg’s Remote Games Server technology from the Spin games division and the Oryx Gaming division has been done with the help of unitary integration. RSI players that access the BetRivers.ca platform will get the chance to play five exclusive games. The list includes the hit title Egyptian Magic created by Atomic Slot Lab studio, which is Bragg’s proprietary studio. More than 20 other exclusive titles belonging to Bragg’s partner and proprietary gaming studios are waiting to be introduced to the gaming market in Ontario in the next few months.</p>
<p>Both Companies are Thrilled About the Expansion</p>
<p>Bragg Gaming Group’s chief executive officer Yaniv Sherman expressed the company’s excitement about expanding its partnership with RSI, calling it “one of the premier iGaming operators in the Americas”. Sherman also mentioned the inclusion of the Canadian province into the agreement with the help of the BetRivers.ca brand. He added that Ontario is expected to grow into one of the most important iGaming markets in the North American region, further explaining why the new deal with RSI is likely to “play an important role” in the company’s development strategy in North America.</p>
<p>RSI’s chief executive officer Richard Schwartz had a similar speech, adding their players will benefit from additional top-tier content from one of the most reputable providers on the planet. Schwartz emphasized the company was on a clear mission to put its players first. Rush Street Interactive is a premier iGaming operator in Canada, and also a common presence in the LatAm region and the US. Bragg Gaming Group was launched in 2018 and has continued to grow its business in North America, Europe, and Latin America.</p>
