<p>The provider of quality games, powering the online gambling industry, Play'n GO, announced the release of a new sci-fi-themed slot game called Invading Vegas Las Christmas. The latest addition to the iGaming provider's growing portfolio fuses successfully sci-fi, Las Vegas and Xmas themes all in one, promising to deliver unique and rewarding experiences thanks to a wide range of features.</p>
<p>The release of Invading Vegas Las Christmas comes after the massive success Play'n GO's Invading Vegas enjoyed earlier this year. At the same time, the video slot game comes ahead of Christmas and perfectly fills the gap between other such themed slots like Naughty Nick's Book and Xmas Magic. Complementing the growing portfolio of Play'n GO's sci-fi-themed slots, Invading Vegas Las Christmas joins the likes of Captain Xeno's Earth Adventure and Sparky &amp; Shortz Hidden Joules, among other slot hits.</p>
<p>Magnus Wallentin, Play'n GO's Games Ambassador, was excited about the recently released 5x3 reel slot game. "Weâ€™re really looking forward to players getting their hands on the next installment of Invading Vegas and getting into the holiday spirit, too," he explained in a statement. Wallentin praised the company's growing portfolio of games, outlining that it offers a wide range of titles that stand out with unique themes and different genres.</p>
<p>"However, when we get to merge two, in this case Sci-Fi and Xmas, it adds a really exciting challenge for the team," he added. Finally, Wallentin said: "The many features combined with the amazing designs are certain to set Invading Vegas: Las Christmas as a favorite for fans this holiday season."</p>
<p>Invading Vegas Las Christmas features vibrant colors and cheerful background music that perfectly matches its holiday theme. While the reel is presented at the center of the screen, the background portrays a destroyed Las Vegas covered with snow. Play'n GO's new slot game features standard card suits along with special holiday-themed high-paying symbols.</p>
<p>Players of Invading Vegas Las Christmas can tap into the game's Free Spins round by landing three Scatter symbols on the reels during the base game. Initially, this grants them 12 free spins. During this game mode, online players can unlock the title's Lock On Respin and Walking Wild features as well.</p>
<p>To trigger the special Lock On Re-spin mode, players need to land a full stack of any matching symbols or wilds on the first two reels. It's important to mention that there should be no matching symbols on the third reel in order to activate this mode. Once the mode is activated, players can hit mouth-wagering prizes by locking on and winning thanks to re-spin.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Invading Vegas Las Christmas also offers Walking Wilds. Stacked Wilds that land on the third reel during the Lock On Respin mode can transform into a Walking Wild. "This covers the whole reel and moves one reel to the right and every other reel gets a re-spin. Once the Walking Wild leaves the reels, the feature ends," explains the iGaming developer.</p>
<p>The engaging feature can also be activated during the standard Free Spins mode. The difference in such a case is that the reel moves to the left instead of the right.</p>
