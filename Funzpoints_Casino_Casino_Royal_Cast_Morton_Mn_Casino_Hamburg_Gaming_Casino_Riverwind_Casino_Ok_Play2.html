    <h1>Funzpoints Casino Casino Royal Cast Morton Mn Casino Hamburg Gaming Casino Riverwind Casino Ok Play2</h1>

<p>I joined this casino at the beginning of March. On the 8th March I decided to cancel my account as I believed I was betting too much. In live chat they advised to send a request via email, which is what I did. I sent an email to suppor­­t@­p­l­ay­­24b­­et.com (copy of email attached) asking for my account to be closed. Based on the Responsible Gambling policy my account should have been closed from that point and yet I didn’t receive a response and my account was left open.</p>
<p>As my account was not blocked, I then deposited a further €589.</p>
<p>Point 14 of the casinos Ts&amp;Cs states to cancel the account state "close my account" in an email, which is what I did (copy of T’s &amp;Cs attached), however, as mentioned my account was not closed.</p>
<p>The casino has now blocked me from my account (as of 3rd April) for asking too many times where my withdrawal was (it arrived two weeks late). I can’t access my deposits on my account and so I have attached Copies of my bank statements showing the deposits to the casino made from 9th March - 23rd March attached.</p>
<p>In addition, the casino also breached their Ts&amp;Cs on data protection. Recently the casino had a technical issue with withdrawals and rather than send an email direct to me to update me on the withdrawal, they sent an email to 8people asking for our IBAN/SWIFT numbers. This meant 7 other people now had my email address. The casino gave my personal email address out to other people (third parties) without my consent. A few people both email actually responded to this email providing their banks details. (Copy of email attached)</p>
<p>It states in the casinos Ts&amp;Cs "we are bound by the Data Protection Act of the law of Malta. Play24bet will protect your data collected and respect your privacy in accordance with applicable laws". "Play24bet prides itself on keeping your privacy and will not under any circumstance disclose your data to third parties" (copies of Ts&amp;Cs attached)</p>
<p>I asked the casino if they would refund me the deposits I made after I asked for my account to be closed, minus my withdrawal amount, which would be €449 (€589-€140), because of the Data Protection breach and the fact my account should have been closed following my email on the 8th March.</p>
<p>Please can you help?</p>
