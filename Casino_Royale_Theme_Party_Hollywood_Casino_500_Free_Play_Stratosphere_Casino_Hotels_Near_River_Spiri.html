<p>Betr, the latest innovator and first mover in the micro sports betting space, has launched a new partnership with Prizeout, a payment service company. This partnership is exclusive and it names Prizeout as the sole withdrawal method available for players’ free-to-play winnings.</p>
<p>Betr Adds Prizeout as Cashout Option</p>
<p>Betr is building a brand-new concept around sports betting where players can bet on specific moments in the outcome of sports events, leading to a more approachable way to engage with sports gambling, according to its founders.</p>
<p>The platform is also backed by Jake Paul, an online sensation who has been very active in the sports and betting communities in recent months. His decision to team up with Joey Levy, a known face in sports gambling has given rise to Betr, which is also coming to the Australian market.</p>
<p>Betr is looking to secure market access in the United States leveraging its free-to-play platform pending all necessary regulatory approvals. In the meantime, the platform has made it clear that Prizeout will be their preferred way of withdrawing funds form, transforming winnings into digital cards to spend on various outlets that accept this form of payment.</p>
<p>This only covers the period during which Betr allows for free-to-play winnings. In the future, Prizeout will be included as part of the available real money withdrawal options, but for the time the solution will remain as the sole option while those regulatory finalizations last.</p>
<p>Prizeout founder David Metz was excited about this new collaboration, and he said that this partnership will be a step forward for both companies Metz added:</p>
<p>Their innovative platform is the perfect match for our technology, with both parties working together to deliver a unique betting experience that aims to give users more for their money. Prizeout founder David Metz</p>
<p>Cashing Out Real Rewards from F2P Winnings</p>
<p>Prizeout makes transactions quick, simple, and free of any hidden charges. Once a transaction is approved, the digital cards are delivered right away and they are up for spending across more than 1,000 national and local merchants, the company informs on its page.</p>
<p>Betr head of product Alex Ursa also welcomed the opportunity to empower consumers in this way. According to Ursa, Betr welcomed the opportunity for players to have the chance to get a real chance to cash out their winnings and benefit from them.</p>
<p>“Our partnership with Prizeout will give our users another way to win, and we look forward to taking this next step with them,” Ursa wrapped up.</p>
