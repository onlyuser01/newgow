    <h1>Casino Spokane Riverwalk Casino Vicksburg Prairie Meadows Casino The Ocean Casino 7 Feathers Casino</h1>

<p>Hello CasinoGuru ,</p>
<p>I'm making this complaint as I see that what is happening to me has happened to other players...</p>
<p>So as a start, I registered on Rolletto on February 1st ,2023 after reading that Rolletto has a Good Review here ,but didn't read about players comments ( should have!! )</p>
<p>I firstly made my account to be verified before making my first deposit.</p>
<p>Once my account has been verified so I made a deposit of 207,04€ using Litecoin and with bonus of 250%..</p>
<p>So I had to wager more than 21k€.</p>
<p>With a lot of luck, I successfully manage to beat wager and instantly made withdrawals in 2 parts as per their terms and conditions, players are only allowed to withdraw 7500€ per week...</p>
<p>About 2 or 3 days later, my withdrawals have been rejected and after exchange with Livetchat support ,it was on my side cause there system doesn't allow to upload documents of more than 2mo.. so ,I agree that one of the photo of my ID which was larger than 2mo , I took a screenshot of it and sent it...</p>
<p>So, I've been asked to sent again documents and only photos..</p>
<p>What I successfully manage to do this time and receive that account has been verified..</p>
<p>And there here we go...</p>
<p>Withdrawals have been returned to my rolletto account because now I've to send selfie with I'd and paper with written information ( name of casino, my username, current date ,).</p>
<p>I did so and account has been verified and once again I made withdrawals..</p>
<p>...which has been rejected one more time because I've to send selfie video with Id...</p>
<p>I did it again, and video been approved yesterday 9/02/2023 and I was thinking that my winnings will be paid as they clearly stated to my while discussing about this with Livetchat...</p>
<p>Nope... Withdrawals have been canceled one more time!!! And can't make anymore a cashout... I've screenshot of that too!!</p>
<p>And now they want my WhatsApp phone number, which I already gave them because it's my registered phone on my rolletto account...</p>
<p>So as consequence, after reading so many bad reviews against them from player here and elsewhere, I just inform them about what I was going to do ( complaints to Curaçao Gambling Commission, Complaints to CasinoGuru and other Gambling sites ).</p>
<p>So, Casinoguru , as I've all the discussions and exchange with them if needed, I hope you'll help me cause , I just want Rolletto to stand by their terms and conditions and pay me my winnings accordingly as I 've requested them. And to respect 7500€ per week.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance Casinoguru to have a look into this for me please .</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
