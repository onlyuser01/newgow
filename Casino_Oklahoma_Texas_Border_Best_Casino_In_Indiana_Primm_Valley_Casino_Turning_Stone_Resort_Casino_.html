    <h1>Casino Oklahoma Texas Border Best Casino In Indiana Primm Valley Casino Turning Stone Resort Casino</h1>

<p>The first game that will make it into Relax’s Silver Bullet platform is LooneyPop</p>
<p>Leading iGaming provider and aggregator Relax Gaming has formed a new alliance with AvatarUX. As a result, more “thrilling titles” and player engagement mechanics will be added to the former company’s cutting-edge Silver Bullet platform.</p>
<p>AvatarUX is a fairly new game studio that launched its first game back in 2019. Since then, the provider has gone from strength to strength, releasing one good game after another. What makes its content stand out is, among other things, the refreshing PopWins mechanic.</p>
<p>The unique feature won the Game Mechanic of the Year accolade at the CasinoBeats Game Developer Awards this year, further attesting to the quality of AvatarUX’s work. In addition, the company won Slot Supplier Rising Star at the EGR B2B Awards in 2022 and grabbed two wins at the CasinoBeats Developer Awards in 2023.</p>
<p>AvatarUX recently built upon its PopWins success, introducing MultiPop and StickyPop, two new spins of the beloved mechanic.</p>
<p>Overall, AvatarUX has cemented itself as a promising emerging brand. With innovation being at the core of its philosophy, the company continues to roll out games with outstanding visuals, exciting features and robust math models.</p>
<p>The first game that will make it into Relax’s Silver Bullet platform is LooneyPop with more to be provided to Relax and its operator partners at a later date. AvatarUX will leverage Relax Gaming’s world-class portfolio of operators to grow its footprint, profiting from Relax’s unrivaled speed to market.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, AvatarUX recently joined REEVO’s aggregation platform as well.</p>
<p>Relax Welcomed AvatarUX to the Silver Bullet Family</p>
<p>AvatarUX’s chief executive officer, Nicola Longmuir, praised Relax Gaming as “one of the most esteemed content aggregators” in the market. He called the partnership a “great milestone” for his team and added:</p>
<p>The collaboration will allow us to extend our footprint in regulated jurisdictions and help us expand our distribution to new markets and target new players. Nicola Longmuir, CEO, AvatarUX</p>
<p>In the meantime, Relax Gaming’s chief product officer, Shelley Hannah, lauded AvatarUX as the developer of “unique titles and mechanics.” She said that her company is happy to welcome the developer to the Silver Bullet family.</p>
<p>We are delighted to add them as our latest Silver Bullet partner and we know operators will be eager to showcase their portfolio of games. Shelley Hannah, CPO, Relax Gaming</p>
<p>Speaking of Relax Gaming, the company recently added Endorphina to the Powered By Relax platform.</p>
