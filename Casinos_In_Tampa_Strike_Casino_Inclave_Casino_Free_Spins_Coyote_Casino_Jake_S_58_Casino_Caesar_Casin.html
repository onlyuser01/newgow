<p>It’s on. Well, actually it was never off. The NASCAR Cup Series continue as a new event is next on the circuit with the Bristol Motor Speedway hosting the Bass Pro Shops Night Race this Saturday, October 18.</p>
<p>The evening race promises to be plenty of fun as Kyle Busch comes in the lead with (+400) followed by Kyle Larson (+450) and Denny Hamlin who is third with (+600). Now, the moneyline is always a bit difficult to get, but we have featured a few more odds, including those tipped to finish Top 3 and Top 5 in the race. Let’s have a look.</p>
<p>Odds to Win Bass Pro Shops Night Race (2021)</p>
<p>Driver Moneyline To Finish Top 3 To Finish Top 5 Kyle Busch +400 +130 -175 Kyle Larson +450 +150 -155 Denny Hamlin +600 +200 -115 Chase Elliott +800 +270 +100 Joey Logano +1000 +330 +140 Kevin Harvick +1100 +370 +150 Ryan Blaney +1500 +500 +200 Kurt Busch +1500 +500 +200 Brad Keselowski +1600 +550 +230 Martin Truex Jr. +1800 +600 +260 Odds at DraftKings as of September 17, 2021</p>
<p>Coming in as Favorite, Kyle Busch is Facing Tough Competition</p>
<p>The Bristol Motor Speedway will offer plenty of challenges to all drivers. The top 10 drivers on the list are definitely looking at a tight competition with Kyle Busch leading the pack posted at (+400).</p>
<p>As a shorter track, Bristol gives Busch an edge as he is traditionally a driver that deals with these short distances in a more composed manner, easily positioning himself ahead of the pack. The conditions of the raceway are already familiar to him and he is in no way going to be surprised by the time of the race, which is set for 7:30 pm ET.</p>
<p>In fact, he is one of the most experienced drivers here giving him a good chance of winning. Then again, he hasn’t won in four seasons with his last victory going back to 2017. Busch has three wins in the race, which definitely places him as someone to watch out for. He also has the most leads in the last seven races with over 640 laps, so there is that. Busch also averages 98 mph at Bass Pro Shops Night Race, based on his last three wins.</p>
<p>Who May Pose a Threat to Kyle Busch on Saturday?</p>
<p>Naturally, one question remains. If Busch has posted such a consistently good driving record, is there anyone to really come between him and a Saturday win? Well, Kyle Larson may not be as successful in the race and he has in fact not won it even once, he is still ahead of the pack. Larson also has five Top-6 finishes this season making him a consistently good driver this season. He also placed four of those in the Top 3, which gives him a good chance at Bristol.</p>
<p>Larson will probably place in Top 3 just as well, but if you are looking for a somewhat shot, we recommend turning your eye to Joey Logano (+1000). He has achieved seven Top 10s this season in 11 Bristol Motorway starts, which does mean something.</p>
<p>He is also proving to be a good and consistent driver this season. Then you have Chase Elliott who is posted at (+800). Since his All-Star Race win in July, Elliott has been doing a fine job, and Bristol Motorway could recreate the conditions he needs for yet another win.</p>
<p>As things stand, Kyle Busch is definitely not the only contender for the title. If we are looking at the moneyline, though, we would say to go with him if you don’t want to risk too much. If you are looking for a mid-range risk, you can still do Elliott or Logano to win.</p>
