<p>Dear Desheen59 and Casino Guru members</p>
<p>First and Foremost, we would like to thank you for your feedback</p>
<p>Desheen59, we have had a look at your withdrawal queries and can confirm that the amounts processed are correct as per the Casino’s Terms and Conditions which you have agreed to.</p>
<p>With regards to your first withdrawal:</p>
<p>You won 4.14mBTC (on a free bonus) which you played up to 21.44mBTC, you thereafter went on to complete a withdrawal, at which point the system prompted you to forfeit the bonus amount of 4.14mBTC in order to complete a withdrawal of 17.30mBTC. From the 17.30mBTC the most you can receive is 10mBTC (as per the Casino’s Terms and Conditions) I do see that this amount has been paid to you and it is correct.</p>
<p>With Regards to your second withdrawal:</p>
<p>You made a deposit which is required ( as per the Casino’s Terms and Conditions) to be paid for the First withdrawal which was won of a set of free spins as stated above, You did not claim a match bonus on the deposit made and had already played the deposit down to a nil balance, You then contacted my Support Team asking for a match bonus, This was explained on chat why a match bonus cannot be credited at that point, however as a goodwill gesture my Support Team had credited a Free Bonus of 26mBTC to your account, which was then played to a balance of 102mBTC and withdrawn,</p>
<p>Now referring to the Casino’s Terms and Conditions on both withdrawals mentioned above, All Free Bonuses, Free Spins, Loyalty Point Claims and Tournament wins carries a maximum withdrawal of 10mBTC which can be found here - https://www.cryptothrills.io/terms-and-conditions</p>
<p>Should you require any further explanation, please contact my Support Team and we will arrange for a Support Manager to have this explained to you telephonically</p>
<p>Kind Regards</p>
<p>Crypto Thrills Support Team</p>
