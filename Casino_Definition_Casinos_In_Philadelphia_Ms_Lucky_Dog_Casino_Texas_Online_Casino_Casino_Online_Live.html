    <h1>Casino Definition Casinos In Philadelphia Ms Lucky Dog Casino Texas Online Casino Casino Online Live</h1>

<p>They have as well closed my account access once I questioned the casino about this and they would end the chat reluctant to answering the question provided to the customer service representative, when asked to speak to a manager supervisor or pit boss they would reply with we don’t have one on duty. Please try again later and then end the chat. I don’t know any casino regardless, if it’s online or if it’s a storefront that does not have a manager on duty or a superior manager over their position. Everything leads to the prime example of a fraudulent company acting as a reputable online casino. They also have sister casinos under the same "curaçao license" such as black lotus casino, Asia lotus casino, lucky Creek Casino, big dollar casino, treasure mile casino, grand eagle casino, mandarin Palace. They all are run and owned by the same company. I was suggest not affiliating with this company or any other website under this license. I have taken the steps to report these so called casinos through Internet, crimes division in the USA, as well as through their government. Complaint website. This should not be allowed in the USA as online gambling is illegal in 80% of the states. There are only a few states in the United States that allow this type of online gambling entertainment. New Jersey, New York, Michigan, or a few of those states, and I’m sure they wouldn’t be allowed to run under their countries license as the USA would not be able to govern against such license. The majority of the sites on your website that you guys recommend or as well and indeed websites that run exactly as mentioned and I don’t know how you guys back such companies as it is very illegal and should not be recommended to anybody in the United States as there could be many consequences on both sides, the player and the casino. I would recommend also looking into the majority of these casinos mentioned on your website, and there allowance as a gambling website in the United States. I live in Alaska, and no gambling is allowed in the state of Alaska period. Online or on the streets. I will be pursuing this company and litigation against this company as they have created a scenario that I could’ve possibly been charged Felonise due to playing their games. This is a giant issue in the United States from outlying countries to profit off of unknowing individuals while advertising criminal situations and involvement. I thank you for your time and the check up as to my issue with this company. If you could make this known to your superior officer that this is a high priority issue that should be looked at immediately for not only yourselves, but as players like me as well it’s unconstitutional and absolutely absurd the outcome that could possibly come from this deeply research these so-called casinos before recommending them to people who’s at risk.</p>
