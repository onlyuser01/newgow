<p>The World Series of Poker (WSOP) is committed to introducing more people to the game and part of this experience is making sure that people out there know about poker in the first place. To help fulfill this ambition, WSOP has launched the #RoadToTheTable campaign and it has announced the identities of 14 content creators who will share their passion for poker with their fans.</p>
<p>Each of the names on the list is a prominent social media personality with sizable followership on platforms such as Twitch, YouTube, Instagram, and others. They will all face off in a poker tournament in December, but getting there will be accompanied by various activations and a lot of fanfare.</p>
<p>WSOP general manager of app Guy Ceder is hoping that by striking partnerships with those select individuals, their fans will find poker to be a more appealing game to join and play themselves. Evidently, the #RoadToTheTable campaign is all about boosting public awareness. Commenting in a press release, Ceder explained:</p>
<p>"We hope that everyone involved will enjoy playing poker as much as we do, and that the influencers’ journey towards becoming legendary poker players will inspire their audiences to explore the game too, both virtually and with real-life decks and chips."</p>
<p>The list of participants is quite notable, with personalities such as Jay Mendoza, Lauren Fitzmaurice, and Stephania Ergemlidze all joining in the fun. They are not all, as WSOP plans to have a big showdown involving a lot of notable personalities who are now working hard to hone their poker skills and bring their best game to the table in December.</p>
<p>But they don’t get to do this on their own. In fact, every participant in the #RoadToThTable will be trained by a professional poker player who will open them up to the secrets of the game and show them how to rapidly improve their game. Each influencer got a "mystery box" which had a video message that they had been invited to join the campaign.</p>
<p>As complimentary gifts, WSOP has also sent luxury chips and cards. One of the influencers to be drafted for the campaign, Zack TTG said that he was thrilled to be part of the World Series of Poker campaign. Even though he admitted to being quite new to the game of poker, he assured his followers that he would do his best to win as much as he can playing against other influencers.</p>
