<p>Newcastle welcomes Liverpool at St. James’ Park on Sunday, August 27 in what might be one of the most interesting duels of Round 3 of the 2023-24 season of the English Premier League (EPL)</p>
<p>Newcastle vs. Liverpool is one of the most exciting duels of the third round of the 2023-24 Premier League. The game is taking place at St. James’ Park in Newcastle where the hosts have suffered only two losses within the last 12 months. What’s got to worry them is that one of those happened against Liverpool.</p>

<p>A Big Season is Ahead for Newcastle</p>
<p>Newcastle is playing in the Champions League for the first time in 20 years, where the Toons have moderate ambitions. Their No. 1 goal for the 2023-24 season is to do well in the EPL, but can they do the same as last time when they finished fourth?</p>
<p>There’s a lot of skepticism going on as Eddie Howe’s team hasn’t any spectacular signings. The Magpies did, however, sign a couple of decent players during the summer transfer period, most notably, Sandro Tonali (from AC Milan), Harvey Barnes (from Leicester City), and Valentino Livramento (from Southampton).</p>

<p>But it wasn’t just about signing new players this transfer window; the Geordies also sold a couple of players. Allan Saint-Maximin is the most notable departure, who moved to Al Ahli SC of the Saudi Pro League. Further, Chris Wood moved to Nottingham Forest, while several players got released on free agency.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Newcastle has been doing alright since the start of the season. In Round 1, the Magpies destroyed Aston Villa 5-1, while in the second, they lost just 1-0 to the mighty Manchester City on the road.</p>
<p>Liverpool’s Troubles in the Midfield Continue</p>
<p>During summer, a number of midfielders left Liverpool who used to play a key role for this team last season. The best example is Fabinho, who played 36 of the 38 Liverpool’s Premier League games last season. Further, Jordan Henderson and James Milner – the former captain and vice-captain – also left the club, along with Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Naby Keita, and Fabio Carvalho.</p>
<p>The Red did bring a pair of midfielders to close the gap in the center of the pitch – Dominik Szoboszlai and Alexis Mac Allister. That’s not enough, which is why coach Jurgen Klopp had to put Cody Gakpo in the midfield. Sure, the Dutchman is a jack of all trades, but the fact is that his natural position is in the front three.</p>
<p>To make things even worse, Mac Allister got a red card in the previous game, meaning that he won’t be in the protocol on Sunday. What this means is that we’ll probably see 20-year-old Harvey Elliott in the starting XI.</p>
<p>Newcastle vs. Liverpool Prediction</p>
<p>In August 2023, Liverpool is a team that’s incredibly lethal in the attacking department, decent in defense, but horrible in midfield. Newcastle, on the other hand, looks equally good in all areas, with its midfield being its arguably strongest spot. That said, we think the hosts are going to control this game, not allowing the Reds to create too many goal chances.</p>
<p>They have a very bad record against Newcastle, with only two wins in the last 10 years, with the more recent of those happening in 2015. However, things have changed a lot since, and Newcastle now looks capable of getting a good result on Sunday.</p>
<p>Pick: Newcastle to win &amp; under 2.5 goals</p>
