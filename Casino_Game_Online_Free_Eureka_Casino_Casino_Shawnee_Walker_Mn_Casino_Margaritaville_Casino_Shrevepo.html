<p>Sports data and technology company Sportradar announced today it signed a partnership with Bowl Season, one of the greatest and longest-running traditions in American sports, to become its official partner starting from the 2022-23 season.</p>
<p>‘Expertise in Creating Immersive Experiences’</p>
<p>As an official partner of Bowl Season, the post-season of college football that promotes the grand tradition of the bowl system and its values to student-athletes, Sportradar will act as an advisor to the organization as it is exploring ways to benefit from the sports betting space in a responsible and thoughtful manner.</p>
<p>Nick Carparelli, executive director at Bowl Season, outlined that Sportradar’s “expertise in creating immersive experiences for sports fans” is exactly what Bowl Season needs.</p>
<p>“Sportradar will be a great resource to Bowl Season, playing a major role at our Annual Meeting this coming spring and educating our membership on their wide array of services. We’re thrilled to partner with Sportradar and look forward to working with them.” Nick Carparelli, Executive Director, Bowl Season</p>
<p>Sportradar will assist Bowl Season in identifying ways to take advantage of a variety of commercial opportunities that will allow the organization to participate in the overall value chain.</p>
<p>The sports technology business will also sponsor Bowl Season’s Annual Meeting, looking to educate its membership on the evolution of the sports betting industry and the potential benefit from expanding Bowl Season’s partnership to include Sportradar’s Integrity Services. Just days ago, Sportradar reported a record number of match-fixing signals in 2021.</p>
<p>“Millions of sports fans look forward to Bowl Season each year. We see untapped potential in the collegiate sports space, and this multi-faceted partnership will help the organization enhance an already exciting experience for their fans and reach a broader audience.” Ed Blonk, Chief Commercial Officer, Sportradar</p>
<p>Expanding College Sports Offering</p>
<p>The new partnership builds on Sportradar’s commitment to its partners and customers for an expanded college sports offering, following the acquisition of leading coaching, scouting and analytics collegiate sports platform Synergy Sports in 2021. The platform has a history of being a trusted provider to college teams since 2007.</p>
<p>Last year, Sportradar continued with the efforts in collegiate sports by entering into integrity partnership agreements with multiple college athletic conferences. Sportradar also launched its Direct-to-Consumer OTT platform in a college sports partnership.</p>
<p>In February, Sportradar announced a foundational partnership with the United States Football League (USFL), a new professional football league in the US, to develop the league’s data collection and delivery systems, including those for the league’s related business, with a focus on sports betting advertising during the league’s telecasts. Sportradar also became the USFL’s official sports data and integrity partner.</p>
