    <h1>Hotels Near Foxwoods Casino Ct Casinomax Casino Treasure Island Casino Minnesota Horseshoe Casino Co</h1>

<p>So it's an uncomfortable situation if the casino ignores you in such a serious matter and you have already sent 3 emails. Did you try to ask what the problem is and why your account is not closed yet ?</p>
<p>Anyway, I was going to recommend a complaint, but I see that you have already managed to file one. I also have to add that the casino is on the blacklist and operates without a license, which is not the best choice of casino. Have you seen it yourself?</p>
<p>Anyway, if you manage to close the account, will you let us know ?</p>
