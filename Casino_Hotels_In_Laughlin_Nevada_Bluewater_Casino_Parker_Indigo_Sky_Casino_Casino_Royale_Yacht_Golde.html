<p>The globally-recognized gaming company powering sports betting, lottery and iGaming operators, International Game Technology (IGT), announced a new collaboration, extending its offering in Alberta, Canada. Earlier this week, the company confirmed it has successfully introduced a new ten-game set for Alberta Gaming, Liquor &amp; Cannabis (AGLC), the government agency tasked with the regulation of recreational cannabis, gambling-related activities and alcoholic beverages.</p>
<p>The collaboration between the duo launched in April 2023 and will see the replacement of some 2,600 legacy Video Lottery Terminals (VLTs) for the AGLC. IGT will replace those with "modern, high-performing IGT CrystalDual 27 VLTs featuring this new, in-demand game content," a statement reveals.</p>
<p>The new collaboration spans across the whole province and is expected to elevate the experience for AGLC's customers, delivering compelling new game sets. At the same time, the partnership represents an important milestone for IGT as the company continues to expand its presence in the province and boosts the positive momentum gained in Alberta.</p>
<p>More than 2,000 VLTs within the AGLC network are expected to benefit from IGT's first CrystalDual game set. This will bring quality content and supreme entertainment for the users. "In addition to compelling content, IGT supplies the province with VLTs, commercial casino cabinets, the INTELLIGEN central system and a variety of IGT PlayDigital games," explained IGT.</p>
<p>David Flinn, IGT's SVP Sales, Canada, Central and South America, acknowledged that the collaboration represents an important achievement for the company, which is delighted to expand its presence in Alberta. "IGT's studio team carefully curated AGLC's localized game set to help the Lottery achieve peak player engagement and maximize revenues," he said.</p>
<p>Last but not least, Flinn pointed out: "The combination of leading hardware and player-favorite games such as Cash Eruption, Big City 5's and Ocean Magic positions the Lottery for continued growth and pairs perfectly with the other IGT products and services that have powered AGLC's operations for years."</p>
<p>The latest announcement comes after only recently, IGT was recognized for its diversity, equity and inclusion efforts. The company revealed that it won the "Diversity and Inclusion" category from the 2023 Women in Gaming (WIG) Diversity &amp; Employee Wellbeing Awards. The award is a testament to the company's dedication to ensuring it offers a workplace that is diverse and at the same time, opposes any form of discrimination.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, IGT signed a licensing agreement with Sony Pictures Television for the rights to the famous Wheel of Fortune brand. Under a 10-year deal, the company secured exclusive rights for the brand for iLottery, iGaming, as well as gaming and lottery.</p>
