<p>In fact, some $4.5 billion will be going down on regulated gambling markets across North America. The assessment was made by Macquarie analyst Chad Beynon who took a look at sports betting handle in the country and what drove results over the past few days.</p>
<p>Big Handle Goes Down on Specific Rounds</p>
<p>The first two rounds of the tournament colloquially known as March Madness were responsible for 70% of the sports wagering handle last week, he said. The Sweet 16 games are also usually the biggest contributors when it comes to the amount wagered on the event.</p>
<p>Beynon explained that the Sweet 16 and Elite 8 games, a total of 12 games, contribute around 55% of the total amount bet on the sport. Then again, the Final Four and Championship tend to generate between 40% and 50% of the total handle, with the betting action clearly focusing on the beginning and end of the event for the most part.</p>
<p>The analyst claimed that 30% of the total amount bet in legal markets in the United States would be driven by the tournament in March. The number would fall off to 10% of the total betting handle in April, when the tournament is wrapping up with the Championship game on April 3.</p>
<p>Macquarie also took note of how much money the sportsbooks were able to retain – that is the money not paid out as winning wagers. According to the analyst, the hold rate is 7% in the first two rounds of the event. Beynon argued that bettors’ obsession with betting on “totals” was a good way for operators to retain a bigger amount of money.</p>
<p>Bettors Tempted by “Over” to End Up with “Under”</p>
<p>He explained that 67% of the games went “under” which effectively means that sportsbooks managed to pull ahead on bettors who mostly stuck with the “over” choice of the two. Macquarie’s target is a bit of a far cry from what the American Gaming Association has said the total betting handle on March Madness would be.</p>
<p>According to the trade group, people of the legal gambling age in the United States are expected to bet a total of $15.5 billion on the outcome of March Madness games.</p>
