    <h1>Hollywood Casino West Virginia Online Games Casino Vblink Casino Palace Casino Resort Tulalip Casino</h1>

<p>Hey everyone,</p>
<p>This is Jack Jelinek from Winaday, hoping all is well.</p>
<p>I'd like to provide with an official statement on this unfortunate event of player's funds being stuck, as we see the case summary being slightly off. So just to reiterate:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the player withdrew $400 on Dec 13, having selected BTC address as a preferred method of withdrawal</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in less than 24 hrs, on Dec 14, her winnings were processed and sent using BTC address submitted by the player (tsx id proving my words can be provided upon request)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the player contacted us requesting us to reverse the payment, and send to another Bitcoin address instead claiming an 'unsupported asset' was used (errr, would anyone consider BTC an 'unsupported asset'?!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>morever, crypto transactions cannot be simply 'reversed' but as her BTC address was associated with her Cashapp account, our helpful support would still bend over backwards to have provided the player with a step-by-step how this could have been arranged (i.e. by rejecting BTC deposit on Cashapp's side and providing it with a different BTC wallet address)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the player apparently did as advised, trying to re-route the winnings from Cashapp to Coinbase, which is the moment when things became complicated BUT with our end no longer being involved</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>this additional transaction has been pending ever since due to low fee, leaving Cashapp to be blamed (by paying 5 sat/B when standard fees are ~200 sat/B)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>another helpful advice came from our end to check with Cashapp to increase the fee to which the player hasn't responded, leaving the tsx pending as of the time of writing</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>TL;DR</p>
<p>We paid the player in time, even provided several helpful above-standard advices to reinstate the situation and are no longer involved in process of the funds being stuck between two player's ecash accounts, while the ONLY chance to remedy the situation is an intervention on Cashapp's side to increase the low fees causing this transaction to be stuck</p>
<p>Wishing player luck while dealing with Cashapp helpdesk, finally arranging the payment of player's winnings to be settled ðŸ¤ž</p>
