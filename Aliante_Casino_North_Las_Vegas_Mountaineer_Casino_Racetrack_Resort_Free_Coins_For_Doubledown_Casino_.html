    <h1>Aliante Casino North Las Vegas Mountaineer Casino Racetrack Resort Free Coins For Doubledown Casino</h1>

<p>I entered a game and began playing with a balance of 121000</p>
<p>I made a couple of spins with a stake of 200. This was pre-set when I entered, and on the first game they deducted 100000 in one go, after which I continued with the 200. I didn't notice this as the game didn't send the usual insufficient balance message.</p>
<p>The game's betting record clearly shows a correlation between the initial 100000 and the following 200, with a difference of 17 seconds, which in my opinion makes it impossible for me to have started betting an incredible amount and lowered the value for the next game. I also don't think the system would have done this automatically. I made a complaint during the game, submitted the records, but the casino's support team insists that I did it.</p>
<p>And finally today they responded that it was done by me, and the casino can't offer any solution.</p>
<p>Can you help with this problem?</p>
<p>I will attach the images of the transaction in question</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
