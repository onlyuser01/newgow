    <h1>Arizona Casino Resorts Scottsdale Casino Ip Casino Biloxi Ms Casino Hack Casino Card Game Riot Games</h1>

<p>Riot Korea, a subsidiary of Riot Games, has banned a number of accounts and introduced measures to combat illegal esports gambling websites linked to wintrading and griefing of LCK players.</p>
<p>Wintrading Targeted in New Riot Games Sweep in Korea</p>
<p>Riot Games’ Korean subsidiary is stepping up its efforts to combat illegal gambling in its flagship game, League of Legends, following a controversy surrounding illegal esports betting sites that have been offering markets on professional players’ solo queues.</p>
<p>The measure is part of a broader campaign against griefing and wintrading and a pivot of Riot’s culture against abuse of any sort.</p>
<p>The issue with wintrading was identified recently, leading to the suspension of overseas accounts on December 8 and Riot Korea setting up a hotline on December 9, encouraging teams to step up and post tips on any players who may have been wintrading for illegal gambling websites.</p>
<p>Earlier today, Riot Korea said that it is rolling out a new software upgrade to deter use of prohibited third-party software, adding:</p>
<p>“Wintrading and illegal gambling on solo queue matches are unacceptable in any circumstances. We’ll make sure to do all we can to prevent such actions.” -Riot Korea</p>
<p>Wintrading, Griefing and a Chinese Link</p>
<p>In an official statement, Riot Korea said that it has identified a number of illegal Chinese esports gambling websites that have tried to influence the outcome of LCK professional players’ games and in doing so, they have used Korean accounts illegally.</p>
<p>Riot stepped up its efforts in identifying 10,000 accounts with a similar MMR as professional players and pinned down those showing suspicious activity by illegally playing from overseas, suspending them right away.</p>
<p>The company is also suspending the use of special third-party software that makes it easier for high-ping players to reduce latency. High-ping is the result of using VPN to join Korean servers illegally, and now the third-party programs used to cushion this ping will be targeted by Riot.</p>
<p>Last but not least, a special hotline has been set up to allow anyone who suspects players trying to win trade, to be reported. Riot Korea welcomes any reports on suspicious activity that merits a closer investigation.</p>
<p>This hotline will focus exclusively on wintrading whereas other issues such as verbal abuse and behavioral actions will have to be reported through the established gaming channels.</p>
<p>Clamping Down on Illegal Gambling</p>
<p>Illegal gambling has been taken very seriously by developers worldwide, especially after Valve, the developer of CS: GO, faced a class-action lawsuit for allegedly facilitating underage gambling with “skins,” for not suspending third-party websites the company didn’t own nor had any interaction with.</p>
<p>Valve continued to face lawsuits in the years after from overzealous parties who continued to shift the blame on the developer. However, these difficulties have set a precedent that neither Riot nor other big game publishers are willing to face on a repeated basis.</p>
<p>Cracking down on this wintrading circle is a first for Riot, which has been focusing heavily on eradicating abuse and the use of third-party software for the purposes of cheating.</p>
