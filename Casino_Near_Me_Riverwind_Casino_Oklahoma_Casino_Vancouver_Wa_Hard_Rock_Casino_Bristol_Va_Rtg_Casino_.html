<p>FanDuel Casino is looking to bolster its presence in the iGaming vertical and online casino segment. To do so, it needs the help of skilled marketing agencies, and Mischief @ No Fixed Address is the creative agency that will join FanDuel as the brand journeys towards more visibility in this particular vertical of the experience.</p>
<p>Preparing for the iGaming Expansion in the US</p>
<p>Recently, DraftKings co-founder and CEO Jason Robins urged lawmakers to act more decisively and make more confident strides towards the full-scale legalization of online gambling in the United States. This was interpreted as a rallying call for companies, especially DraftKings’ competitors, including FanDuel, to prepare better for what may follow soon.</p>
<p>Even though New York was rumored to be legalizing iGaming before long, this seems to have been put on the backburner. Regardless, engaging with online casino players will define how well companies do once the industry is launched officially.</p>
<p>FanDuel and Mischief will seek to establish the brand as an indelible part of the iGaming experience, appealing to both male and female players, as the vertical has historically seen interest from both groups. By taking its casino industry online, the United States will access an unprecedented level of gross gaming revenue which will then translate into solid tax income for state coffers.</p>
<p>Mischief will work to ensure that FanDuel has “fertile” opportunities for new customer engagement and cross-sell opportunities throughout its businesses and assets. Commenting on the partnership, FanDuel VP of casino brand strategy Daniele Philips said:</p>
<p>We’re entering uncharted territory as more and more states begin to welcome online casinos, and as FanDuel Casino introduces and acquaints itself to people across North America, we want to do it in an unexpected way that is so distant from category conventions. FanDuel VP of casino brand strategy Daniele Philips</p>
<p>FanDuel Excited about the Future of iGaming</p>
<p>Mischief co-founder and chief creative officer Greg Hahn welcomed the opportunity to work with FanDuel and the casino brand and said that the company is looking to create an “unmistakable edge” for the iGaming portal. He praised FanDuel for the company’s successful positioning in the market.</p>
<p>Presently, FanDuel Casino operates in nearly all licensed iGaming states, including Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Michigan, and New Jersey.</p>
