<p>Matthew Muscat’s new position as the Videoslots chief finance officer (CFO) is the first news headline for the leading operator for 2023</p>
<p>A strong finish in 2022 was one of the best foundations to build upon for this year’s roadmap but making sure you have the right people in the top positions doesn’t hurt either.</p>
<p>New CFO to Kick Off 2023</p>
<p>This marks Muscat’s top position at the company so far, climbing from the head of finance to becoming a finance director, and now – CFO for the company. Muscat has been at Videoslots since April 2019, so his huge career progress has taken him less than four years in total at the leading operator’s company.</p>
<p>Muscat’s previous experience was with the sports betting company Bethard Group, where he was a senior finance manager. Going even further back, his experience in finance only shows itself enriched, with additional specialized capabilities in accounting and auditing. So, his background is diverse, and his experience at Videoslots has only added to that.</p>
<p>“Matthew has been a huge asset to the finance team at Videoslots and his dedication made him a stand-out candidate for the role of CFO” said Ulle Skottling, deputy chief executive officer at Videoslots said. This sentiment carries a lot of weight, as Videoslots has been growing and evolving as a company very well lately.</p>
<p>“The finance team here is a hugely important part of how the company operates and my job will be to ensure that we make things as smooth as possible for all our partners and customers” Muskat himself commented on his promotion at the operator. He added his gratitude for the trust indebted to him with this new position.</p>
<p>Videoslots Had a Strong 2022</p>
<p>2023 is a potentially big year for Videoslots, and management preparations aren’t limited to the new CFO. A new chief operating officer was appointed last August in the face of Eamonn Faulkner. He is a veteran with momentous experience from companies such as Betfair and DraftKings, and his style of problem-solving meshes perfectly with Videoslots.</p>
<p>The Pennsylvania launch of the Mr. Vegas brand is slated for this year, so that’s a big source of expectations for execution. This comes in partnership with Caesars Entertainment, which will serve as the market entry point for Videoslots. The joint venture marks a fantastic opportunity for Videoslots to expand its market reach.</p>
<p>In that train of thought, the leading operator has also gained a good foothold in Italy through its partnership with Stakelogic, where some of Stakelogic’s content will be available on Videoslots, solidifying the presence of both companies in the overall European gambling market. That’s not all for Videoslots, however.</p>
<p>The partnership with MGA Games in the Spanish market was also made late last year, with the Videoslots Casino game catalog growing even more. This also helps boost MGA’s global presence, so it’s a safe bet to assume this one also goes in the good folder for both companies.</p>
