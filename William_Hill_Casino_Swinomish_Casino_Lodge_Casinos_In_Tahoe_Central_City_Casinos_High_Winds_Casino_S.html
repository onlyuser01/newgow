<p>Stakelogic Live has announced that it is looking to significantly expand its workforce in Malta, starting today. The company is looking to hire more than 100 game presenters. Scaling up its business, the Stakelogic is looking to launch more tables which is why it will need highly trained dealers. Moreover, with this move, Stakelogic Live plans to solidify its presence as the number one live casino content provider in the world.</p>
<p>“We believe that the quality of our game presenters is a major factor in what sets our live casino content apart from our rivals and that is why we are looking to work with the absolute best dealers in the business.” Anthony Sammut, head of Stakelogic Live</p>
<p>Stakelogic Live’s head, Anthony Sammut, said that the recent recruitment drive reaffirms the company’s commitment to the live casino vertical. Moreover, he stressed that Stakelogic Live is planning to take the live casino market by storm “in the exact same way as we have done with our modern video slot and classic slot games.”</p>

In conclusion, Sammut urged people who think that may fit as game presenters to get in touch.</p>
<p>Stakelogic Continues to Grow</p>
<p>Currently, Stakelogic Live offers multiple table games such as blackjack, roulette, baccarat, as well as game shows. Each table has a luxurious background and it is run by a highly trained dealer.
