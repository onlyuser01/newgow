    <h1>Odawa Casino Resort Casino In Queens Ca Casinos Goldie S Casino Cash Frenzy Casino Enteractive Recei</h1>

<p>Yolo Investments, a venture capital firm, has provided a crucial equity investment to Enteractive – a leading iGaming company focused on customer retention and reactivation solutions.</p>
<p>Enteractive Will Scale Its Business</p>
<p>The exact size of the funding was not publicly disclosed but the companies shared that it sits at “several million Euros” for a non-controlling interest equity stake. Enteractive will use the money to enhance its offerings and grow its business worldwide.</p>
<p>Enteractive believes that human interaction is irreplaceable. It focuses on solutions that allow operators to connect with their users on a personal level, helping companies build long-lasting relationships with their clients and improve brand loyalty. Enteractive partners with numerous operators in various markets across the world. Thanks to its care, bettors can receive special attention, helping them to trust the operators they play with.</p>
<p>Mikael Hansson, the founder and chief executive officer of Enteractive, shared that he is delighted to have Yolo Investments as a part of the Enteractive family. He remarked that the venture capital firm has been doing great work in supporting innovative iGaming companies, encouraging novelty, and meeting new ideas with “a good portion of enthusiasm.” Hansson is convinced that Yolo Investments’ help –both financial and advisory – will be of great help to Enteractive and will help the company accelerate its growth.</p>
<p>Yolo Investments Trusts in Enteractive’s Vision</p>
<p>Yolo Investments is a venture capital firm founded by the entrepreneur Tim Heath. As someone well-versed in the gambling, blockchain and fintech industries, Heath understands the importance of Enteractive’s mission and its benefits to the sector. With years of experience in the sector, the founder is delighted to support promising high-growth companies.</p>
<p>Heath explained that Yolo Investments’ team adores creative businesses that add value to their partners. As one such company, Enteractive is a “natural fit” for the Yolo Investment network, he said. Heath pointed out that countless betting operators struggle with retention and reactivation and that includes many of Yolo Investments’ own partners. Because of that, his team sees “significant opportunities to build synergies” by helping Enteractive develop into a global industry leader and reach more markets.</p>
<p>In December last year, Andrew Foster, Enteractive’s chief business officer, attended the SBC Summit for North America and spoke extensively about the prospects of iGaming companies setting up businesses in the region. He emphasized how crucial player retention is to survive in one of the world’s most competitive markets, lauding the importance of Enteractive’s solutions to anyone who wants to make it.</p>
