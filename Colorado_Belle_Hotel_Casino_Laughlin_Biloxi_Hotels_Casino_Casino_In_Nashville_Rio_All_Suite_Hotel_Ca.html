<p>The self-described “king of online sportsbooks” BetMGM has reinforced its foothold in Mississippi by expanding the offerings of its MGM Resorts International’s Beau Rivage by introducing on-site mobile betting.</p>
<p>BetMGM Adds On-Site Mobile Betting to Beau Rivage</p>
<p>The addition of on-site mobile sports betting will allow visitors to use their mobile devices to bet on pre-game, in-play, futures, and parlay betting options while in the casino.</p>
<p>Adam Greenblatt, the chief executive officer of BetMGM, spoke on the implementation of the BetMGM app to a new venue. He revealed that the whole BetMGM team is thrilled to expand its business in Mississippi and is glad to diversify the betting offerings at the Beau Rivage casino.</p>
<p>“Beau Rivage is one of the great entertainment destinations of the region and a perfect place to bring our platform to new customers as we continue to expand throughout the South,” Greenblatt said.</p>
<p>This will mark another Mississippi venue that has implemented the BetMGM application. BetMGM’s also introduced on-site mobile sports betting to the Gold Strike Casino Resort soon after launching in the Tunica-based casino.</p>
<p>Travis Lunn, the president and chief operating officer of MGM Southeast, mentioned that Beau Rivage “is proud to be the first Coastal Mississippi casino resort to offer mobile sports betting for customers.” He added that the BetMGM app will not only offer a wide variety of offers and betting options but fans can also benefit from the M life Rewards loyalty program.</p>
<p>BetMGM’s application can be freely downloaded throughout the whole of Mississippi. Yet, bettors in the state can only use it in the two currently approved venues, thanks to a novel state-of-the-art geolocation solution. Additionally, users of the BetMGM app can participate in the M life Rewards loyalty program that gives players exclusive promotions and discounts for all MGM Resorts venues throughout the United States.</p>
<p>BetMGM Continues Its Growth Through Strategic Deals</p>
<p>BetMGM has had a strong year, sprinkled with a myriad of strategic partnerships, deals, and acquisitions. To name a few of its most recent partnerships, BetMGM recently signed a content deal with Aspire Global’s leading aggregator and content provider, Pariplay. Almost at the same time, the operator also inked an agreement with Madison Square Garden Sports Corp and Madison Square Garden Entertainment to expand its presence in New York. In October, BetMGM had the opportunity to expand its pre-existing deal with Genius Sports.</p>
<p>Furthermore, BetMGM’s partnership with the Gila River Hotels &amp; Casinos in Arizona allowed the former to launch its first retail sportsbook on the state’s fresh sports betting market. In Ohio, on the other hand, BetMGM reinforced its offerings by launching a horse betting mobile app.</p>
<p>BetMGM’s growth has been further supported by the company’s strategic choice of brand ambassadors. A few days ago it penned a deal with the NFL Running Back Chris Johnson. Earlier than that, the operator appointed the NBA legend Kevin Garnett.</p>
