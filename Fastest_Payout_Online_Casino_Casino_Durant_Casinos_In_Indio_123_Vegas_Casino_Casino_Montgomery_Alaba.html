    <h1>Fastest Payout Online Casino Casino Durant Casinos In Indio 123 Vegas Casino Casino Montgomery Alaba</h1>

<p>On March 18, 2022, efbet blocked my husband's account, the reason being that the account was charged with foreign funds for the second time, after a conversation with them in the chat and on the phone we were told that the profile will be viewed by a management team and after 10 working days they will decide whether to unblock the account and the funds. This is actually the situation. We topped up the gaming account through an epay account, which is in my wife's name, but the registered cards and accounts in it belong to my husband. On 15.03.2022 they demanded verification of the account again, we wrote in the chat to ask why, they said they wanted verification of the epay account, we explained to them, the account and mine are there but the funds we deposit are with my husband, I asked them in the chat explicitly whether this is a problem, and whether it will lead to any problem if we deposit so, their answer was that we need to send profile photos, last transaction and a photo of my ID card. Nobody explained to us that if we deposit they will block our account, again I say that I explicitly asked them about a problem if we deposit with the account, but they did not say that there will be, they just demanded the documents. We sent everything necessary and it was verified again. Accordingly, we continued to deposit with this account after we were not told that there would be a problem. On March 18, 2022, we wanted to withdraw an amount of BGN 2,800, but he returned it to us several times, after which he dumped us and we could not enter anymore because the account was blocked. We received an email that the account was blocked and is being reviewed by a management team because it was loaded for the second time with foreign funds and they warned us, I do not remember having such a warning, and provided that a few days earlier we they were asked if there would be a problem if we deposited in this way and they did not tell us that there was such a thing. The situation is absurd. When we spoke to them on the phone, we explained that a few days earlier we had talked to their colleagues in the chat and explicitly asked them if continuing to deposit a profile with their feet would lead to a problem and they did not tell us that such a problem would occur. that if we knew that such a thing would occur, we would not deposit it like that, and that due to the incompetence of their colleagues who did not inform us what would happen, now the account is blocked. Chats are not sent to the post office, we asked them if they keep chats to view them and see the conversation from 15.03, they told us that they do not keep chats, which is absurd. The account has more than 1000 BGN loaded with the epay account, these are multiple deposits, as they do not allow to be charged with foreign funds, why didn't they block the account after the next deposit. I asked them how they could accept our deposits without any problems and block us if they tried to withdraw. There was no answer to this question. They said that the account can be unblocked, but it may not be, we asked what happens to the money in it, they would sit in the account, we then asked to order the amount on the epay account and if they want to unblock the account, they said no can. I asked what the situation was then, we will burn with BGN 2,800 and over BGN 1,000 deposits, they told me that if the account is not unblocked, yes. The situation is absurd, given that this is due to the incompetence of their support in the chat. We will simply not leave them like that and we will seek our rights to the last.</p>
