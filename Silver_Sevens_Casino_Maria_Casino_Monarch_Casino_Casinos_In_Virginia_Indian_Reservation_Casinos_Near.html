<p>Maxima Compliance, which is a part of the ComplianceOne Group, will provide Gaming 1 with a rich selection of customized compliance services that are carefully selected to best suit the supplier’s products.

<p>Following this agreement, Gaming 1 and its partnering operators will be able to benefit from Maxima Compliance’s regulatory expertise. This will allow them to quickly and seamlessly roll out Gaming1’s content across many states with varying regulatory requirements.</p>
<p>As a part of the prestigious ComplianceOne Group, Maxima Compliance is a firm that has all the tools at its disposal to help companies adhere to regulations in all the jurisdictions where they operate. Maxima Compliance recently opened a new office in the Netherlands, further expanding its global presence and positioning itself to capitalize on the growing Dutch market.</p>

<p>Maxima Compliance’s vice president of technical compliance services, Sergio Suárez García, spoke on the new partnership. He noted that his team has long been working together with Gaming 1 and is excited to take this partnership to the next level.</p>
<p>García said that his team is looking forward to further expanding the deal with Gaming1 and grabbing the opportunities waiting in the dynamic US market.</p>
<p>Thibaut Collard, Gaming 1’s chief compliance officer, pointed out that Gaming 1 has employed Maxima Compliance’s services for several years now. The latter company’s professionalism convinced Gaming 1 to also select it as its compliance partner in the US. Collard said that his team seeks to offer its partnering operators the best compliance support and is sure that Maxima Compliance will be able to provide just that.</p>
<p>We want to offer our operator partners the best compliance support in the US. Alongside Maxima Compliance, we’re confident we can deliver. Thibaut Collard, CEO, Gaming 1</p>
<p>Gaming 1 is excited about the US launch. Last summer, the company managed to scoop five awards at the Malta iGaming Excellence Awards and will now seek to replicate this success in the NA region.</p>
