    <h1>Avi Resort Casino Photos Cincinnati Casino Mystic Lake Casino Fire Keeper Casino Casino Royale Offer</h1>

<p>I registered with Video Slots and as requested I had to send my verification documents to the Security/Verification team, this was done approx 18th September 2020.</p>
<p>I uploaded my UK driving licence and utility bill which clearly showed my full name, date of birth and address. Within a few hours these documents were approved and my account was active. A few weeks later I then also uploaded my Visa Debit Card to fully verify the account again this was accepted.</p>
<p>During this time I made 5 deposits and one small withdrawal, my loss stands at Â£2136. During this time I was registered with Gam-Stop, but I was still able to successfully open an account, get the account verified, deposit, play and withdraw.</p>
<p>During the time of playing with VideoSlots, I made many general enquires to customer support via live-chat and email. To discuss my account I went through full security questions due to Data Protection Laws.</p>
<p>I informed Video Slots roughly around three weeks a go now, that I was registered with Gam-Stop and therefore should not have been permitted to gamble, I also explained I am classed as a vulnerable person and under the care of local hospital services. I sent my official email to them and since then made several visits to customer support via live chat and keep getting told it's under investigation and a resolution will take place within a few days. Although the support was friendly, the constant false promises to resolve and refund the deposits still have not taken place. The whole situation is making me extremely unwell and since this has happened my doctor has now doubled my medication due to the extreme stress this is putting on me and my family.</p>
<p>With such highly recommended reviews across the web with Video Slots, I honestly though this incident would be dealt with in a much more professional manner.</p>
<p>I am therefore requesting my deposits are refunded and no further marketing material is sent to me via email or text messages.</p>
