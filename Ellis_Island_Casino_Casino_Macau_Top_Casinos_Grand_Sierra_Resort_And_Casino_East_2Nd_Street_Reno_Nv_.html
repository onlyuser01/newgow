<p>Octoplay, a developer of casino games, has announced the launch of a second dedicated studio to help it boost production capacity</p>
<p>The new studio, Penguin King, is joining Super Hippo, which is the original game development arm launched under Octoplay’s umbrella. Super Hippo has already launched the Symbols Pays Anywhere games that are slowly making their way through the iGaming industry as bringers of innovative experiences.</p>
<p>Octoplay Brings Second Studio Online</p>
<p>Twice as Nice, Hot Harvest, and Pearly Shores are just some of the games that Super Hippo has developed. Now, Penguin King intends to do some catching up with its first game already announced.</p>
<p>Salmon King is an upcoming slot title that will be developed in-house by Octoplay, leveraging the company’s technology, and distributing it through a dedicated Remote Games Server to make it easier for partners to access the game and for players to have smooth gameplay from the start to finish.</p>
<p>Octoplay plans on having two games per month delivered, one from each studio, but the company may reassess this pace of development in case there is a strong demand for its products and underpinning commercial success. So far, the company feels confident in the potential of its products and future.</p>
<p>Octoplay CEO Carl Ejlertsson confirmed that the company and its new studio are all about bringing players the desired format that will make it possible to enjoy new experiences as part of the iGaming ecosystem. Penguin King is all about that. There are more brands coming from the company as well, Ejlertsson confirmed:</p>
<p>will be one of several Octoplay brands that will provide operators with proven content tailored to individual markets, ensuring guaranteed commercial results.</p>
<p>Octoplay is presently regulated by the Malta Gaming Authority. The company is also regulated in Romania where it successfully secured a license in 2022. Octoplay made its debut in iGaming with three launches back in November, when the company introduced the aforementioned Pearly Shores, Heavy Anchor, and Hot Harvest.</p>
