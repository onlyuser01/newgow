<p>A rise in the number of gamblers trying to self-exclude themselves from gambling websites followed an increase in online gambling during the pandemic in the UK.</p>
<p>As Online Wagering Rises So Does Self-Exclusion Registration</p>
<p>During the pandemic, an increase in online betting was registered, along with more gamblers trying to exclude themselves from online gambling. In February, GamStop, the national self-exclusion scheme in the UK, has recorded a 21% increase in people trying to block themselves from such websites.</p>
<p>According to GamStop, the rise of gamblers registering to self-exclude follows the rise of online wagering at the end of last year, which could indicate that as more people go online to gamble, an increasing number of vulnerable players choose to block themselves from gambling sites altogether.</p>
<p>GamStop Chief Executive Fiona Palmer said that she urges anyone who has registered for the self-exclusion program to seek professional help. She said that awareness of self-exclusion schemes and blocking software has increased in the past year. However, it is important to continue to promote the scheme and reach the most vulnerable players.</p>
<p>Recently, GamStop signed its first-ever partnership with a Premier League Club, Crystal Palace FC. Under the deal, the club’s teams will share information about GamStop’s services on all of their media channels.</p>
<p>GamStop Recorded an All-Time High in Registrations This Year</p>
<p>Almost 200,000 people have signed for the service of GamStop, and on February 22, the scheme recorder an all-time high, reaching a record number of 326 new registrations within one day of its launch. Although gambling disorders are predominant in male gamblers, GamStop has recorded an increase in registered women. The scheme has recorded 50,000 women who have self-excluded recently. There are overall 71% male and 29% female players, and 59% of the people who use the service are between the ages 18 and 34.</p>
<p>In January 2021, 49,328 people out of 177,038 tried to gamble but were stopped due to their GamStop registration. The service allows gamblers to exclude themselves from online gambling for some time. The organization commented that “the blocking software is not a silver bullet.”</p>
<p>Membership in a Scheme Is a Condition in Great Britain</p>
<p>In its submission, GamStop said there had been a rise in the number of black-market website links for betting operations that are not in the blocking service. Membership in a scheme is a prerequisite for operators in Great Britain.</p>
<p>Peer Aid Project Manager Matt Blanks started betting when he was 11 years old. He lost more than £700 000 and tried to commit suicide. He stated that being able to block himself from online operators has saved his life. He said that self-exclusion gives the gambler a moment to pause and ensures him/her that it’s not possible to place a bet during the urge. He concluded that the time to reflect is what makes the difference.</p>
