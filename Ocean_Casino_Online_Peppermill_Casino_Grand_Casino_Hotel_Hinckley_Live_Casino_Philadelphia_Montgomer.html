<p>Buffalo Bounty Slot Review</p>
<p>Buffalo Bounty is a 5×3 video slot released by Dragon Gaming in 2021. The game focuses on the mesmerizing open plains part of the American West that are packed with exotic animals and wild nature scenery. With an RTP set at 96.03%, fun and engaging gameplay meant to keep players on the edge of their seats with each new spin, and plenty of bonus rounds and excellent mechanics waiting to be unlocked, Buffalo Bounty can quickly turn into the favorite of many fans of the genre.</p>
<p>Theme, Storyline, and Graphics: Meet The Animals of the Wild West</p>
<p>The game has found its inspiration in the Great American Plains. The storyline gradually carries players back in time, to a time and place when the buffalo had no problem roaming around freely and the elks were wandering across the virgin lands of the region. As the game unfolds, players are invited to start exploring the rich landscape and come across the beautiful nature and all the wild animals that live in the unspoiled wilderness.</p>
<p>As expected, the wild animals are the main characters and they are highly visible on the reels thanks to the excellent 3D graphics used by the makers of the game. They are used for marking the symbols of the civilization that grew into the new world. The main question players need to answer once they set foot into the game is whether they are courageous enough to explore the journey on the frontier.</p>
<p>The reels are, therefore, packed with a series of lifelike symbols representing eagles, buffalos, pumas, foxes, and deer, part of the theme and artwork that immediately catch the eye and attention of new players looking to enjoy yet another quality video slot by the popular gaming studio. The backdrop welcomes players to the beautiful mountains, trees, and rivers of the land waiting to be discovered along with all its hidden riches.</p>
<p>Buffalo Bounty: Game Symbols and Payouts</p>
<p>The slot counts five high-paying symbols that are represented by the wild animals: fox, deer, buffalo, eagle, and puma. The buffalo is the highest-paying symbol in the game and it also represents the only symbol that will generate a 10x payout once two identical symbols are seen popping on the same payline. Players who land three buffalo symbols get a payout of 25x while four identical buffalo symbols attract a 75x win. Finally, seeing five buffalo symbols pop on the pay lines generates a 150x payout.</p>
<p>The low-paying symbols are represented by the cards: diamonds, hearts, spades, and clubs. Players get a payout of 10x for matching three identical Diamond symbols, 25 for four matching symbols, and 50x for five symbols. The same payouts are offered for matching club and spade symbols.</p>
<p>Landing a minimum of three eagles and puma will trigger payouts of x20x, 50x, and 100x, respectively. The fox and deer symbols reread players with 15x, 40x, and 75x wins for matching three, four, or five identical symbols.</p>
<p>Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The amazing design of the Western landscape and the wild animals there is nicely complemented by the old, Spaghetti Western tune that perfectly blends in with the action and storyline. All the animated symbols and overall artistic depictions of the landscape complete the experience for players.</p>
<p>Buffalo Bounty Gameplay</p>
<p>Once the game is finished loading, players are invited to click the “+” sign in the lower left-hand corner, select “i” and take a look at the paytable to find out everything they need to know about the symbols’ values. The provider has also created a detailed review of all the rules. Players are allowed to remove the soundtrack and sound effects within the game using the volume symbol. They can also select Quickspin mode and let the game naturally follow its course while they are given more freedom. It is also possible to select Autoplay mode by clicking or tapping the button next to the Spin tab. Players are allowed to take their pick 10 up to 1,000 reel spins.</p>
<p>To set up their total wagers, players must adjust the amount with the help of the “+” and “-” symbols located just beneath the reels. Once a budget has been effectively chosen for the respective gaming session, players need to click or tap the play button and start enjoying the game.</p>
<p>Buffalo Bounty: Free Spins, Wild Symbol Upgrade, Expanding Wolds, x4 Multipliers &amp; Bonus Game</p>
<p>The game has different game features players can keep a close eye on to significantly boost the size of their wins. For starters, to engage the free spins round that consists of 10 free spins, players have to land three matching buffalo skull symbols. Landing more scatter symbols will lead to a larger number of free spins being granted to players. For example, coming across three scatter symbols will bring players three upgrades.</p>
<p>There are four available upgrades players will need to take their pick from. The first one is the Wild Symbol upgrade which turns puma, eagle, or buffalo symbols into wild symbols while the reels are still spinning. The second upgrade automatically turns the same symbols into Expanding Wild symbols, whereas the third upgrade grants players even more free spins as well as multipliers that can go as high as x4 the stake.</p>
<p>Players can also play a bonus game while engaged in the free spins round. During the bonus game, players can scoop up a 200x instant win.</p>
<p>Final Thoughts</p>
<p>If you are looking for a Western world-themed game with untamed animals and beautiful flora sceneries, you are going to enjoy Dragon Gaming’s Buffalo Bounty video slot. The game is played on a 5×3 grid with flawless design and 10 fixed pay lines. The excellent theme, storyline, and modern-day gameplay are prone to satisfy both brand-new and seasoned slot players.
