    <h1>Planet 7 Casino Login Pearl River Resort Casino Belterra Casino Ohio Pechanga Resort Casino Temecula</h1>

<p>On the 18/08 i deposited $30 &amp; yes claimed a bonus. Over the next few weeks, i played out that bonus. Building my funds at one point up to $1k, losing near all of it and so on. Then on the 20/09 i won $1200. Was refused initially my withdrawal as i hadnt sent in all docs to verify account. Did all that, and was then asked to send photo of a card not registered and no longer in use, that was not used for this deposit either. When i explained and queried why this was needed, when in all info, it only requested photo of the card used in casino, was told because i had made 2 deposits months earlier with it. After sending in highlighted bank statements to prove card was mine, it was obvious by their reply that their 'in depth' reviews of docs was rubbish. I have delivered every piece of documentation that they wanted and have been continually given nothing but the run around. my first withdrawal request, upon them refusing it, I was told it would be in my casino account within 48 hours yet it was never returned to my account. then I won more money, that they are claiming was then the money that was returned. They finally then came back to me and said that all of my money had been voided and my $30 original deposit was given back to me because, the original bonus back in August, they clai I had broken terms &amp; conditions and they said that it said the $1,200 that I had won came from the bonus in august. On looking through my history there is no proof of that at all but upon asking them for the actual documentation they have that proves this they keep refusing me saying its in my history, which its not.</p>
<p>I would be happy to send all emails pertaining to this to you if that would help?</p>
