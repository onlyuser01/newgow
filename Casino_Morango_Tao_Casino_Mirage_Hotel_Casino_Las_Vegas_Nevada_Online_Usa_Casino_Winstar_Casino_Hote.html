<p>The new appointee boasts an impressive track record that includes various positions at multiple notable companies</p>
<p>Global gaming and sports betting leader Entain has reinforced its board with the appointment of Amanda Brown as an independent non-executive director (NED). The experienced appointee has years of experience in corporate leadership roles and is a valuable addition to the team.</p>
<p>Brown will officially join the team on November 8, also becoming a member of Entain’s Remuneration Committee.</p>
<p>The new appointee boasts an impressive track record that includes various positions at multiple notable companies. She was most recently chief human resources officer at Hiscox. During her time at the company she also served as a member of its senior leadership team but stepped down in 2022.</p>
<p>In addition, Amanda is currently a NED and Remuneration Committee chair of Mitchells &amp; Butlers, as well as a NED and chair designate of the Remuneration Committee at the Manchester Airport Group.</p>
<p>Her previous experiences include time as a NED and Remuneration Committee chairperson at Micro Focus International.</p>
<p>Entain’s new hire also boasts a degree in English from Reading University.</p>
<p>Gibson Welcomed Brown to the Entain Family</p>
<p>Entain’s chairman, Barry Gibson, welcomed the new hire on board, praising her experience in business and board positions. He said that he trusts her ability to help Entain’s board and help Entain enact its corporate strategy.</p>
<p>On behalf of the Board, I am delighted to welcome Amanda to Entain. Amanda brings a wealth of international business and board experience. I am confident that her skills and expertise will further enhance the Board’s ability to support and oversee the delivery of our strategy. Barry Gibson, chair, Entain</p>
<p>Entain’s official announcement concluded that there are no details to disclose for Amanda Brown under Listing Rule 9.6.13. The company also noted that she currently does not own any Entain ordinary shares.</p>
<p>Recent Entain Developments</p>
<p>In other news, Entain’s chief executive officer, Jette Nygaard-Andersen, recently teased that the tie-up with MGM Resorts is unlikely to be permanent. Her statement caused industry experts to suggest that a possible MGM takeover attempt of Entain might be on the table.</p>
<p>Nygaard-Andersen’s statement came just after Entain announced its plans to downscale Unikrn amid changing priorities and regulatory headwinds.</p>
<p>At the beginning of this month, on the other hand, Entain completed its $100 million acquisition of Angstrom Sports. The deal, according to the company, will help the casino giant “unlock significant opportunities” in the US market.</p>
