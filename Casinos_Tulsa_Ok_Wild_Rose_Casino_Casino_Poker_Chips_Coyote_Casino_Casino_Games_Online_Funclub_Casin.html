<p>I wouldn't ask you if those bonuses were free ones if I had this information previously. Thank you for answering. I have checked the general bonus terms and conditions, and this is what I found (here):</p>
<p>"Unless otherwise stated, the max cash-out for all no-deposit bonuses can’t surpass 1 times the sum value of the bonus redeemed. All free chips valued at or below $100 will have a cash-out limitation of no longer than, nor less than, $100.</p>
<p>Welcome courtesy bonuses have a maximum withdrawal amount of $100.00 for all NEW players."</p>
<p>"The Player may not redeem multiple no-deposit bonuses. Free processor offers are meant merely for our regular faithful customers and you should have an active depositing account unless otherwise stated in order to cash-out on a free chip offer. Should a Player redeem one no -deposit bonus and then be subsequently offered another one, the Player must make a real money deposit for the Player into their account in the interim in order to be eligible to redeem the second no-deposit bonus.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>The Player has the right to just one free chip between deposits; any winnings caused by multiple free chips will be null. For instance, should two free processors be redeemed by a Player in a row, they are not going to have the capacity to get any winnings by playing on said processor created. They are free to enjoy the games on the site however."</p>
<p>To conclude, If your winnings were accumulated from a No Deposit bonus purely, you would be entitled to a maximum withdrawal of $100. However, if you redeemed multiple free bonuses in a row, you won't be entitled to any winnings, unfortunately. Please let me know if there is any additional information that I have overlooked, but I’m afraid I will be forced to reject your complaint as unjustified. I wish I could be of more help. Thank you in advance for your reply and understanding.</p>
