    <h1>Double U Casino Harrahs Cherokee Casino Nc Magic City Casino Miami Tampa Casino Hotel Green Bay Casi</h1>

<p>deposited 10.40 with them using Wise for bank transfer. They reflected on account just 10 and when i got in toch with them to ask for the 0.40 missing and why they applied just 10 but not 10.40 they said 1st that they round it up because of the conditions of the promo (if they admit that they round it up that means that they didnt recieve round ammount , but not round amount - which is really indirect confirmation of the fact they got 10.40 not 10) , then the story turned that they got 10 and not 10.40 and i should contact Wise to ask for the missing money, basically telling me in the face that i am liar .I spoke with a manager and few of the support staff , with the manager checkign himself on the issue and then confirmng that they got just 10.</p>
<p>So what sort of casino comopany is that - where the support staff and managers lie directly in ur face - calling u a liar , where money get missing in misterious ways , they break trust and any claims for fairness and openess are out of window, . I would like my money back with compensations for the past time they had them , i want compensations for emotional damage of being called liar , for the wasted time and effort chasing my money trying to find out what happened, why the manager and the support staff lied in my face after multiple checks they did on their systems. I dont care is just 40p - money is money, they are mine , i didnt know they round the sum and didnt got the 40 back on my account. casiino supposes to be trustworthy, honest and open , White hat are not a small company . and that is breakage of their UK gambling license. If they can do that with 40 p what stops them to do it with 400 pounds or 4000? they stole from me 40 p , but whats their customer base... imagine 40 p stolen from 2000 customers .. aint small lump.. i will report them to UK gambling comission for investigation as well as Cyber division of London police for the theft ,</p>
<p>attaching the chat log with them over the matter , emails ffrom them , and the best bit is the email from Wise .</p>
