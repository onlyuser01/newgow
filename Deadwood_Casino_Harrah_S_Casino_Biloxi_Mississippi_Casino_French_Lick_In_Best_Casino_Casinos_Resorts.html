    <h1>Deadwood Casino Harrah S Casino Biloxi Mississippi Casino French Lick In Best Casino Casinos Resorts</h1>

<p>PlayStar has secured access to another state after New Jersey and the operator of iGaming brands is preparing to run another foray into Indiana through a link-up with Caesars Entertainment.</p>
<p>The company is extending its existing partnership with Caesars through which it will now be able to deploy its iGaming brand to the Hoosier State, subject to regulatory approval, and without an exact date when this launch may happen.</p>
<p>PlayStar Continues to Expand in US iGaming Vertical</p>
<p>The company is still awaiting regulatory go-ahead, but it seems confident that it will be able to launch in the region. Following the company’s New Jersey entry, PlayStar is keen to add Indiana and Pennsylvania to the list of markets where the company is able to do business legally. Two more state activations will significantly expand the company’s footprint.</p>
<p>PlayStar has made its plans for the iGaming sector in the United States evident even before launching in New Jersey. The brand and operator are keen on accessing every regulated jurisdiction in North America and rapidly scares its consumer base as iGaming is becoming more popular by the day.</p>
<p>PlayStar chief business development officer and company co-founder Adam Noble welcomed the opportunity to be teaming up with Caesars in pursuit of realizing this long-term plan. He explained:</p>
<p>We are delighted to have joined forces with Caesars once again, providing us access to Indiana which is forecast to be a thriving online casino market, subject to future legalization PlayStar chief business development officer and company co-founder Adam Noble</p>
<p>Noble cautioned that it’s still early days to properly gauge the impact the PlayStar brand has in New Jersey, but the early results have been reassuring and positive. Indiana’s market access, even prior to full regulatory approval, is important to the company, Noble continued.</p>
<p>It will make it possible for PlayStar to continue expanding and standing “shoulder to shoulder” with its peers and other iGaming companies seeking to secure growth in the United States. PlayStar has also teamed up with a number of companies to ensure that its launch in New Jersey was a success.</p>
<p>PlayStar Trusts the Best Partners in the Industry</p>
<p>PlayStar joined forces with Gaming Innovation Group, Light &amp; Wonder, and IGT PlayDigital among others. The company also turned to Xpoint as its preferred geolocation specialist to ensure that it remains compliant with regulatory expectations and delivers a stellar experience to consumers.</p>
