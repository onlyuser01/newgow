<p>Playtech, one of the world’s most reputable gambling tech companies, has gained exclusive rights to The Million Dollar Drop in the US and retained its Deal or No Deal Bingo rights for additional five years. As a result, the company has strengthened its partnership with Banijay Records.</p>
<p>Playtech’s Goal Is To Deliver The Best Gaming Experience</p>
<p>With the new agreement, Playtech will use The Million Dollar Drop (internationally known as The Money Drop) to expand its influence in the US. This comes on the heels of the launch of the company’s two modern live casino facilities in New Jersey and Michigan.</p>
<p>Sasha Uman, the director of live business development at Playtech, stated that as part of the growth in the US, Playtech is dedicated to delivering the highest level of live casino experience. That is precisely what the company is aiming for with the Benijay partnership.</p>
<p>Uman also said that The Money Drop Live offers a unique gaming experience. Everyone at Playtech is thrilled to introduce the localized Million Dollar Drop in the country and thus solidify its spot as a leader in live gaming entertainment both in the US and globally.</p>
<p>The Money Drop Live is one of Playtech’s top live game shows, and it offers an exciting and engaging format. The brand will be leveraged across the Playtech bingo markets in the next couple of months.</p>
<p>Deal or No Deal Bingo Is Another Massive Achievement</p>
<p>Apart from securing the rights to The Million Dollar Drop, Playtech also retained exclusive rights for Deal or No Deal Bingo for five more years. This gameshow proved to be a massive hit as it became one of the most successful gameshow formats of the 21st century so far.</p>
<p>Angus Nisbet, Playtech’s managing director of digital bingo, stated that Deal or No Deal Bingo is always at the top when it comes to bingo rooms’ performance. That is why Playtech is happy to continue providing its partners and their respective customers with such a unique gaming experience.</p>
<p>Banijay Brand’s Lex Scott also shared a few words. He said that both the Money Drop and Deal or No Deal Bingo are iconic titles that have a huge following, and that is why Benijay is eager to see how will these two brands grow “into new product verticals.”</p>
<p>Scott also added that Banijay is happy to extend its relationship with Playtech, and since Playtech is a leading supplier, it is more than capable of expanding The Money Drop in the US.</p>
<p>Back in December 2021, Playtech also strengthened its European position after it opened a new live studio in Zurich, Switzerland.</p>
