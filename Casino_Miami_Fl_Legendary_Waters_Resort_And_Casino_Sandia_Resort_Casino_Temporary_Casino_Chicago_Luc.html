    <h1>Casino Miami Fl Legendary Waters Resort And Casino Sandia Resort Casino Temporary Casino Chicago Luc</h1>

<p>Evoplay will run its Endless Summer Network Tournament counting three tournaments with a €120,000 ($130,000) prize pool between June 13-August 22</p>
<p>June has been quite busy for leading provider Evoplay known for its groundbreaking, mobile-first gameplay options. Just last week, the company announced that it won the prestigious Slot Game Provider of the Year award during the SiGMA World Americas. During the same week, the provider inked a LATAM-oriented content agreement with Sportingtech.</p>
<p>A week before that, Evoplay launched the X-Demon Bonus Buy slot and scooped up the Bronze medal in the Business-to-Business Marketing Campaign category during the EGR Global Marketing &amp; Innovation Awards 2023.</p>
<p>On June 13, Evoplay kickstarted its much-anticipated Endless Summer Network Tournament with Seaside Days, the first of the three tournaments meant to boost operators’ engagement numbers.</p>
<p>The first tournament ended on June 22 and it will be followed by the Island Getaway tournament which will run between July 14 – July 25 and the Sun-Kissed Party tournament available between August 9 and August 22.</p>
<p>Available to All Casino Operator Partners</p>
<p>The “radiating” events are expected to help all participating operators significantly improve their main casino metrics thanks to the irresistible prize pool capped at €120,000 ($130,000). Evoplay encourages all of its casino operator partners to invite their audience “to dive into an ocean of thrilling gameplay as our hottest games take part in the tournaments!”</p>
<p>The provider also expects the summer tournament to be used as a powerful incentive for slot aficionados to engage in their preferred titles from them while focusing on getting on top of the leaderboard and collecting the cool rewards waiting for them.</p>
<p>Iconic Evoplay games and fresh releases including Hot Triple Sevens, Penalty Shoot-out, Patrick’s Magic Field, Mega Greatest Catch, Fruit Super Nova, and Rio Nights are all part of the games available in the three tournaments.</p>
<p>The Recipe for Success</p>
<p>Evoplay seems to have found the recipe for marketing success. The 2023 summer tournament is just one of the numerous similar events launched by Evoplay in the past years that helped the provider scoop up its prestigious marketing awards.</p>
<p>The company’s chief executive officer, Ivan Kravchuk, spoke about the exciting tournament, expressing Evoplay’s delight “to let out the sunshine and give back to its players and our operator partners.”</p>
<p>Kravchuk also expressed confidence in their highest-performing games’ ability to trigger better engagement metrics for casino operators while enticing players with appealing cash prizes.</p>
<p>Participating brands can expect to significantly increase their total number of users while reaching higher bet amounts and total gross gaming revenue.</p>
