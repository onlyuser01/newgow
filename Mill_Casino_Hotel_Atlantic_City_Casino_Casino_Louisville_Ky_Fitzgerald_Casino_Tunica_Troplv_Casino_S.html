<p>Our Shakhtar Donetsk vs RB Leipzig prediction is that this is going to be a fantastic game. It just has to be because these two are battling for a spot in the next stage of the 2022-23 Champions League. If the Ukrainians win, they will qualify for the knockouts. If the game finishes in a draw or RB Leipzig wins, the German team will advance.</p>
<p>So, whatâ€™s going to happen on Wednesday in Warsaw? To see what we predict, read out Shakhtar vs Leipzig preview until the end!</p>

<p>Shakhtar Donetsk Has Already Achieved a Lot in the UCL</p>
<p>Even if they donâ€™t win on November 2, the Ukrainians will play on the continent in 2023. This is because, in the worst-case scenario, theyâ€™re going to finish third in Group F, which guarantees a spot in the UEFA Europa League.</p>
<p>Of course, they would love to stay in the Champions League, but thatâ€™s a big ask. The thing is that Shakhtarâ€™s roster in 2022 is way weaker than it was before. After Russia started the war on Ukraine, almost all of Shakhtarâ€™s foreign players left the club. In fact, the 21-year-old attacker from Burkina Faso, Lassina Traore, is the only non-Ukrainian player who decided to stay put after the war broke out.</p>
<p>Lassina Traore will STAY at Shakhtar Donetsk for the next season at the very least</p>
<p>Heâ€™s one of three foreign players at the club (heâ€™s the only one who has stayed that was part of the club since pre 24/2)</p>

<p>Nevertheless, despite having one of the least valuable rosters in the Champions League, boys from Ukraine have managed a lot this season. Their current record in the UCL is 1-3-1, with their only win happening against RB Leipzig on the road. They defeated the Germans 4-1 in the first round. Can they do the same in the final round of the group stage?</p>
<p>RB Leipzig Want to Continue Playing Great Soccer</p>
<p>After a poor start to the 2022-23 Champions League season, RB Leipzig entered a winning streak â€“ they won their previous three games. As a result, theyâ€™re now three points ahead of Shakhtar Donetsk, meaning that if they donâ€™t lose, they will advance to the next phase of the competition.</p>
<p>That doesnâ€™t seem too hard to achieve, especially knowing that RB Leipzigâ€™s players have been phenomenal over the last couple of weeks. We saw them beat Real Madrid on October 25, Bayer Leverkusen on October 29, and so on.</p>
<p>Shakhtar Donetsk vs RB Leipzig Prediction</p>
<p>Shakhtar Donetsk is playing its home games in the UCL at Stadion Wojska Polskiego in Warsaw. With the support of their fans, they are without a loss in the Polish capital, and we think the same may remain until the end of the campaign.</p>
<p>The question, however, is whether they can beat RB Leipzig. We think they can if they make their chances count. RB Leipzig will play with third-string goalie (Orjan Nyland) on Wednesday, meaning that Shakhtarâ€™s offense should have a relatively easy job.</p>
<p>Picks: Shakhtar Donetsk to win &amp; over 2.5 goals</p>
