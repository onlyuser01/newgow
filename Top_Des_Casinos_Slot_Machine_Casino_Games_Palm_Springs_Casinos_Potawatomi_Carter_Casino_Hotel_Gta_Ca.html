    <h1>Top Des Casinos Slot Machine Casino Games Palm Springs Casinos Potawatomi Carter Casino Hotel Gta Ca</h1>

<p>Hello good afternoon.</p>
<p>Yes, looking only from above and perhaps not understanding what I question with certainty, but see what it is about.</p>
<p>First of all, at no time was I told that such 350 free spins were referring to this, so much so that I got the information that the received spins were related to the mission prize of the fourth day of offers only 5 days later. I kept questioning the prize and they only said that they would check when they had already given me the spins, and betano has a confusing bonus program, where they always give me free spins without even explaining why, there is no criteria for them, this was never communicated to me. However, that's ok, I accepted that, however IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE for such rounds to be to compensate for what I expose because I STILL WOULDN'T HAVE THE RIGHT TO THE 100 FREE SPINS and the FREE SPORTS BET OF 100 BRL, since I HAVE NOT COMPLETED IT YET FIVE MISSIONS to be entitled to them.</p>
<p>See well:</p>
<p>The promotion started on 06/06/2023, ending on 06/12/2023, with one daily promotion and on 06/12/2023 two, accounting for 7 offers and users who completed at least 5 offers would win the final prize 100 free spins and 100 BRL in sports betting.</p>
<p>The offers on the 06th, 07th, 08th were completed without problem, the one on the 09th was the one that gave the problem and on the 10/09th they gave me the 350 free spins to fix this, the mission prize of the 09th. THERE IS HOW I RECEIVED THE 350 FREE SPINS IN COMPENSATION FOR THE FINAL PRIZE BECAUSE I HAD NOT EVEN COMPLETED 5 MISSIONS. That is, until then I would EVEN be entitled to the final prize, being entitled only to the daily mission prize, which in this case was the prize that was compensated for the 350 rounds.</p>
<p>What I claim is the final reward for completing 5 quests, this was not given to me. The 350 rounds are to compensate for the prize on 06/09/2023, which was the 4th mission I completed and I did not receive the prize and the completion was not counted, then I received the 350 rounds as a prize but the 350 rounds were not counted completion of the offer, therefore, when completing the mission on 06/12/2023, only 4 missions were completed out of the 5 required in the system. If I received the prize of 350 rounds, it was because I completed the offer on 06/09/2023 that was a problem, if there were 4 completed missions out of 5 needed for the final prize, it was because they did not count the completion of the offer on 06/09 /2023. Did I explain?</p>
