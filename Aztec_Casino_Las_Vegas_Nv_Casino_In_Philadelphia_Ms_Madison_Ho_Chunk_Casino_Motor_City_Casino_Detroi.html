<p>Earlier this month, new parent company JC Hospitality and partner Virgin Hotels announced that the 1,500-room property would fully cease operations for an expected eight months to renovate and re-brand the resort as Virgin Hotels Las Vegas. Now, the ownership group is extending an offer to employees who vow to return when it reopens, which is slated for January 2021.</p>
<p>In a release, JC Hospitality CEO Richard “Boz” Bosworth says the company has launched an employee retention program titled “Stick Around and Come Back” for its 1,850 workers. The chief executive says those who return when Virgin Hotels Las Vegas is complete will receive a bonus of up to 10 weeks of pay in one lump sum.</p>
<p>While many employees are sure to find work elsewhere, those who want to work in the new Virgin Hotels Las Vegas property will not be required to interview again for their previously held jobs,” Bosworth explained. “The ownership group and operating partners are committed to paying them to return and we want them to return.”</p>
<p>The offer stands for all full and part-time workers, union and non-union employees.</p>
<p>Keeping Band Together</p>
<p>Bosworth added that during the closure, employees will be afforded various benefits, including wellness workshops, continuing education classes, and even social mixers.</p>
<p>The Hard Rock Las Vegas re-do cost has escalated from an initial $150 million to $200 million. The rooms will be renovated, casino floor enlarged and upgraded, conference space expanded, and new restaurants opened. Most notably, the large guitars outside the resort are exiting the exterior stage.</p>
<p>The project is Virgin founder Richard Branson’s debut into the gaming industry. It was a long time coming, the billionaire and philanthropist said.</p>
<p>“Las Vegas has always held a special place in my heart,” Branson explained. “I’ve always felt that Virgin Hotels will thrive there as well. I’m looking forward to Virgin Hotels painting the town red.”</p>
<p>Union Welcomes Employee Deal</p>
<p>Culinary Union spokesperson Bethany Khan told the Las Vegas Review-Journal that JC Hospitality’s offer to give retained workers a bonus isn’t the standard in the Las Vegas gaming industry, but something her labor group works to achieve.</p>
<p>With a union contract, workers have many protections on the job. They are treated with respect,” Kahn said. “When workers know they are valued, they can provide the highest quality of service and hospitality.”</p>
<p>Hard Rock/Virgin Las Vegas originally planned to remain partially open during the transformation. But Bosworth explained that after more thorough review, it simply wasn’t feasible and would have delayed the full overhaul.</p>
<p>“An approximate eight-month closure would be most efficient and ensure a timely opening prior to January 2021. We might be ready in October, but construction is an imperfect process,” he stated.</p>
