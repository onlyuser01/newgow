<p>Pragmatic Play is a huge gaming content company that provides a variety of slot games and live casinos. Last year Pragmatic managed to expand several partnerships with different iGaming and gambling brands such as Betway, Kindred Group, and Casumo. The company is finally extending its Live Casino portfolio to Betway.</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play Expand Partnership with Betway</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play, a major gaming content company, has extended the company’s relationship with one of the UK’s giants in iGaming, the operator Betway. The existing relationship featuring Pragmatic Play’s slot games was quickly expanded to include the supplier’s selection of live casino goods.</p>
<p>Betway will be able to showcase the whole range of live dealer games to the company’s customers. The addition will include fan favorites such as Blackjack Azure, roulette games, and Pragmatic Play’s own first gameshow-style live product.</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play’s entire live dealer lineup is broadcast from a state-of-the-art, custom-designed venue in Bucharest, showcasing cutting-edge 4K video technology and enhanced sound systems.</p>
<p>The deal emphasizes the capability of expanding the multi-product offering of Pragmatic Play, with operators being able to quickly and easily integrate additional verticals through the single API solution of the provider.</p>
<p>VP of commercial strategy and operations at Pragmatic Play, Bhotesh Maheshwari, said: “Betway has only been a customer for a few months, and we’re already enjoying a fantastic partnership.”</p>
<p>Maheshwari continued by stating that Betway’s operators will be able to showcase a multitude of games designed for all sorts of players.</p>
<p>Marketing &amp; operations director at Betway, Paul Adkins, praised Pragmatic Play for the company’s terrific addition of games to Betway’s portfolio and live casino products. He added that including new verticals from Pragmatic Play’s API was very easy, and he was eager to see the growth and progress of both businesses through continuous mutual collaborations.</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play’s Other Recent Partnerships</p>
<p>Last year Pragmatic Play announced several partnerships with other gambling businesses. On December 1, Kindred Group-owned brand Unibet was given access to the live casino portfolio.</p>
<p>The company’s portfolio of games such as Blackjack, Roulette Azure Tables, Baccarat, and Speed Baccarat turned out to be a tremendous success for Kindred.</p>
<p>The current relationship between Kindred and Pragmatic Play, according to the head of gaming at Kindred, Cristiano Blanco, has benefited both parties.</p>
<p>Another partnership that Pragmatic Play struck last year was with Malta-based operator Casumo. Pragmatic Play’s slots and live casino items have been since available for Casumo via direct incorporation as part of the partnership extension.</p>
<p>Casumo previously had to rely on a third party to access Pragmatic Play’s slot content, but now the company has full access to Pragmatic’s portfolio of slot games.</p>
<p>Director of gaming at Casumo, Jacqui Gatt, made a comment stating that the partnership with Pragmatic Play was a step in the right direction for the company and its brand.</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play continues to grow. Currently, the company produces up to 5 new slot games every month and provides a live casino and bingo games on top of the existing portfolio of slot games.</p>
