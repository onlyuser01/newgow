<p>Betfred, a privately owned sports betting company, has announced the appointment of Kresimir Spajic as the company’s Chief Executive Officer in the United States. Spajic, a seasoned veteran, is stepping at the helm of Betfred USA to bolster the local entity’s footprint as the company is undergoing a period of rapid expansion.</p>
<p>The company is already present in ten states in the country, and Spajic will now be personally tasked with pursuing its long-term strategic objectives, which are focused on growing the company’s footprint and building its presence with audiences in important jurisdictions such as Ohio, Colorado, and Nevada, the Betfred outlined in a press statement.</p>
<p>Betfred founder Fred Done welcomed the appointment of the new executive and said that Spajic arrived at the position at an important and exciting time for the company.</p>
<p>The appointment was welcomed by Betfred Group Chief Executive Joanne Whittaker who was happy to see another hard-working individual join the US division as it seeks to expand its operations and take the business to the next level – something that Spajic’s experience will contribute to.</p>
<p>Spajic himself is an industry veteran who has worked long and hard in the gambling industry. He has held various positions across the industry and with Apollo Global Management, Great Canadian Entertainment, Rush Street Interactive, Bwin, Hard Rock International, Borgata Hotel Casino &amp; Spa, among others.</p>
<p>As a trained professional, Spajic is also a graduate of the SDA Bocconi School of Management in Italy and the University of Neuchâtel in Switzerland. He also graduated from the De Montfort University in England and is now excited to be joining the team at Betfred.</p>
<p>"I am looking forward to working with our exceptional domestic and global talent and partners," the new Chief Executive for US operations said, and added that he will work closely with the team to build a sustainable model for the vast and important market.</p>
<p>Betfred has been doing well in the United States, with the sportsbook determined to continue scaling up its presence locally. As the country begins to move forward with various forms of regulation, and most notably sports betting, a prominent brand such as Betfred has the opportunity to secure a fair share of the market.</p>
<p>Outside of the United States, Betfred encountered a bit of unpleasantness this summer after it was handed down a £3.25m penalty from the UK Gambling Commission.</p>
