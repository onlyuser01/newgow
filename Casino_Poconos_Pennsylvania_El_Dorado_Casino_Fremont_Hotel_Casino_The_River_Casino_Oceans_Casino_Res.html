<p>Unity Game Reviews</p>
<p>this place is nothing more than a scam I do not recommend it at all and would never recommend this place I've wasted more than 80 hours playing the games this place developed and has put out for us to fall victim to. Now ive only played slot rush which when i was allowed to cash out bye the games rules, only then was i aware of a 8 day count down. After those 8 days then another count down started up and im not lieing when i te you it says "there are too many applicants for this award and needs to be reviewed bye the staff" now this statement was after the 8 days so i emailed the company any only response was "youll get paid".</p>
<p>So me believing everyone will keep there word my search engine then introduced me to two more games developed bye unity games which were blackjack 21 &amp; lucky chip spin. I downloaded each game and began playing each one. The slot rush only has two cash out tickets available,which are $500.00 &amp; $1,000.00 dollar tickets. On blackjack 21 they have limit tickets meaning you can only cash out with $200.00, $300.00 ,$500.00, $1,000.0, $3,000.00 &amp; $5,000.00 dollar tickets. You can only cash out when you have any of these totals in cash on the blackjack 21 game. The lucky chip spin game is set up with similar cash out tickets. The cash out tickets on this particular game are $300.00,$500.00,$800.00,$1,200.00&amp;$2,000.00 then they have 3 more that starts at $500.00,$777.00 &amp;$10,000.00 dollar cash out tickets. They have and never has had any intention of paying the people they lie too and trick into downloading and playing there game that rhey swear they payout on. Its a massive waste of anyones time and something needs to be done about it. As of todays date Monday April 11 2022 Ive (Chris Gray) have lost over 80 hours of actual play time over a four week span and was owed over $3,000.00 bye this company and never ever received a dime. NOT ONE DAMN PENNY, and the only reason i ever played this game is because i was promise bye the developers themselves that i would indeed without any problems that i would in fact receive any winnings that i posted in game apps. to which ive posted in order at times i won</p>
<p>slot rush-</p>
<p>Here on slot rush i turned in</p>
<p>only one ticket in the sum of</p>
<p>$500.00 dollars</p>
<p>Blackjack 21-</p>
<p>tickets &amp; amounts of my winnings</p>
<p>on this game are as listed</p>
<p>$200.00 dollar ticket &amp;</p>
<p>$300.00 dollar ticket &amp;</p>
<p>$500.00 dollar ticket &amp;</p>
<p>$1,000.00 dollar ticket</p>
<p>So in the game of blackjack 21 I turned in a</p>
<p>total of four tickets totaling up to.</p>
<p>$2,000.00dollars</p>
<p>Lucky Chip Spin-</p>
<p>Tickets &amp; amounts of my winnings</p>
<p>on this game are as listed</p>
<p>$300.00 dollar ticket</p>
<p>$500.00 dollar ticket</p>
<p>So in the game if Lucky chip spin I turned in a</p>
<p>total of two tickets totaling up to.</p>
<p>$800.00dollars</p>
<p>Bringing my total winnings and total</p>
<p>earnings and total im owed to $3,300.00dollars</p>
<p>THEY MUST PAY !! IN SOME WAY OR ANOTHER !!</p>
<p>Unity Game Development Company is a god awful disrespectful P.O.S. good for only lieing dreadful untrustworthy( &amp; more words ive not listed but way worst than i have listed) company unity games or whatever they call themselves with only a email to contact of</p>
<p>to which ive reached out to more than 4 times only to receive only one reply which was over a month ago to which it read only" youll get paid " again another lie</p>
<p>So anyway as of Monday April 11 2022 at 11:04 pm I Chris Gray have not been paid in any kind of way at all the $3,300.00 that im (Chris Gray) is owed bye Unity Game Development Company.</p>
