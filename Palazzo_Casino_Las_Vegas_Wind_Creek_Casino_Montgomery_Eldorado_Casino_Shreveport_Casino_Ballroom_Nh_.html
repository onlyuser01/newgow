<p>Gaming operator Codere has become one of the primary sponsors of the Argentinian football team Atlético River Plate. The revised agreement will give the team a significant economic boost. In exchange, Codere’s logo will move from the sleeves of the team’s shirts to the front – a position previously occupied by Turkish Airlines.</p>
<p>River Plate’s Partners Include High-Profile Companies</p>
<p>The agreement with Codere will substantially fill River Plate’s coffers. The gaming operator previously paid $2 million a year to have its name on the sleeves of the team’s jerseys. Now that the gambling company is moving its logo to the front, the sum will become $3.5 million. The sponsorship deal will last until mid-2025. The contract with the Spanish company will also provide additional income according to River Plate’s performance. The extra amount ranges from $300,000 to $50,000 and will be awarded if the team wins a major cup or league. The new main sponsor will premiere on 7 August in River Plate’s match against Independiente.</p>
<p>With the departure of Turkish Airlines as the team’s main sponsor and their replacement with Codere on the chest, the jersey’s sleeves will feature travel insurance company, Assist Card. Amazon Prime Video, Konami simulation football game PES, and sports fan voting app Socios.com round out the names on the shirts.</p>
<p>The newly extended agreement received high praise from Atlético River Plate president Jorge Brito, who stated that having such a prestigious international brand as the primary sponsor was a source of great pride for the team.</p>
<p>Codere is a sponsor that we already know and with whom we have gone through a very important journey. Jorge Brito, President of Atlético River Plate</p>
<p>According to Brito, the closer relationship between Codere and the team would help the two strengthen each other and deepen their mutual trust.</p>
<p>Codere Continues to Expand Its Latin America Presence</p>
<p>Codere’s newest sponsorship investment further cements the company’s position as one of the largest operators in Argentina. Head of sponsorships at Codere Carlos Sabanza stated that the company was proud to be involved with the team. He noted that they would continue to promote the Codere brand together and provide the Argentine public with quality entertainment.</p>
<p>At Codere, we are convinced that this will continue to be an even more fruitful alliance and that we have made a winning bet by joining our paths. b, head of sponsorships at Codere</p>
<p>Sabanza also drew attention to the company’s growing social responsibility. The operator is one of the most influential in Latin America and regularly launches sponsorship initiatives. Earlier this month, Codere donated $300,000 from its football betting proceeds to NGO “She Wins.” The funds will help empower women through sports and education.</p>
<p>The company also continues its #CodereConEllas campaign, which features in-depth digital meetings with women involved in soccer like athletes, administrators, and technicians. They share how it feels to work in this predominantly male-dominated sport and highlight the challenges and difficulties they had to overcome to make a place for themselves.</p>
