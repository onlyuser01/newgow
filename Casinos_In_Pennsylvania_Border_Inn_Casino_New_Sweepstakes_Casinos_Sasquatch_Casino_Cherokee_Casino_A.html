<p>Alderney is a rocky patch of land, but it still brings home the bacon despite choppy seas and least than favorable weather conditions. Much of this is credited to the Alderney Gambling Control Commission which has been able to provide international gambling operators with a regulatory regime that enables them to operate globally.</p>
<p>The latest results by the commission demonstrate its ability to generate important economic windfall, with the 2021’s results sitting at £2 million. Owing to its unique economic status outside the European Economic Area and European Union, Alderney has been able to mostly avoid the negative effects of Brexit.</p>
<p>It has continued to provide regulatory and licensing services to a host of gambling websites with global ambitions and has been hailed as a valuable contributor to the local tax purse. Chairman Lord Faulkner said that Alderney presented an important source of revenue for the island but also Bailiwick as a whole.</p>
<p>And that’s not all. According to Faulkner, the iGaming industry is yet to reap bigger benefits as the world is opening up to online gambling and welcoming it. Faulkner added that Bailiwick has benefited greatly because of interest from some of the biggest gambling companies in the industry.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, policy and finance deputy chairman Ian Carter has praised the hard work put by the Commission with the official commending the efforts that the regulator has dedicated in order to ensure that Alderney will continue to reap the benefits of licensing gambling operations.</p>
<p>This comes at the same time as the commission has been to demonstrate an unflinching commitment to the highest ethical standards. This, Carter said, made Alderney a behemoth on the "global gaming arena." Part of the profits realized this way will go into furthering the reach of the commission and attracting new opportunities through online gambling.</p>
