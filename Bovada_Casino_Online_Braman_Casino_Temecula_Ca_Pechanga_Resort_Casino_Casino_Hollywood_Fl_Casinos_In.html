<p>B2B esports odds feed provider Oddin.gg announced last week that it received gaming license application approval from the regulator in New Jersey.</p>
<p>DGE Approves Oddin.gg’s Application for a Gaming License</p>
<p>Last week, Oddin.gg revealed that the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement (DGE) accepted its submission for a gaming license application. The submission is in line with the Casino Control Act and effectively allows the company to offer their esports betting solutions to operators in New Jersey.</p>
<p>“We have reached the first milestone in our US market strategy.” Vlastimil Venclik, CEO at Oddin.gg</p>
<p>Oddin.gg’s CEO, Vlastimil Venclik, deemed the recent announcement as the company’s first milestone for the US market. He explained that Oddin.gg plans to rapidly expand its US presence. According to Venclik, the company’s existing network of partners will help it grow on the US esports betting scene.</p>
<p>“There will be more announcements coming soon. Stay tuned.” Vlastimil Venclik, CEO at Oddin.gg</p>
<p>Oddin.gg’s CEO acknowledged that the popularity of legal esports betting has been continuously growing in the US. Additionally, he explained that Becky Harris, former chairwoman of the Nevada Gaming Control Board and current senior advisor of the board undoubtedly boosted Oddin.gg’s vision to “become the thought leader for our licensed US partners.” In conclusion, Venclik explained that further announcements will be released soon.</p>
<p>NJ’s Esports Betting Market Continues to Grow</p>
<p>The DGE has been responsible for regulating the operations of sportsbooks as well as approving sportsbook technology. It was back in June 2021, when lawmakers in New Jersey approved a bill, paving the way for esports betting. But before launching its services, each operator must receive a relevant vendor’s license.</p>
<p>Only recently, Esports Entertainment Group (EEG), the leading online esports entertainment company, received approval to start its operations in the Garden State. This made EEG the first esports betting operator that has received a transactional waiver, allowing them to start their operations.</p>
<p>Besides its entry in New Jersey, Oddin.gg recently inked a key deal with BetU, the world’s first play-to-earn sport betting game. As a result, BetU named Oddin.gg its esports betting provider for odds feed, and “opening up the world of esports betting to BetU’s global customers.” Before that, Oddin.gg inked a key deal with the sports betting platform Novusbet. As a result, Oddin.gg will provide its esports betting solution for the platform.</p>
