    <h1>The Pass Casino Lake Elsinore Casino Walking Stick Casino Palace Casino Resort Biloxi Hotel Planet H</h1>

<p>Let me start by saying I fully understand what a "max cashout" usually means. The only reason I was prompted to ask for clarification is because a previous issue where they admitted to making an error in mixing up "Max win from free spins" and "max winnings" which resulted in me having 2200$ voided. That was partially resolved through an agreed settlement amicably resolved because they had coded or worded it wrong. To avoid a similar situation, I decided to double check this time around.</p>
<p>Note, I asked these questions BEFORE any winnings from this instance occured.</p>
<p>On a prior, same bonus, I got lucky and had winnings from free spins exceeding the cashout limit, upon finishing the wagering requirement, the extra balance reverted to 300$ (the max cashout limit). However, that is usually the behavior of what you call "Max winnings" or "max einnings after wagering requirements". Max cashout most often does not interac with your balance, but will only allow you to withdraw up to that limit. So that begged the question to me "When they say max cashout, do they actually mean max winnings?". So I asked.</p>
<p>I wasn't satisfied with both, perhaps how I asked my question and the answer provided. So I clarified again with a question less open to interpretation.</p>
<p>When I asked "Or will I have to withdraw and redeposit?". The answer only explained the "max winnings" portion, which I was already aware of, having just witnessed it. "Due to the cashout limit" to me here essentially means "this is what the cashout limit does, therefore means". But as I said, that wasn't clear enough for me. So I asked again in a way that leaves no ambiguity as you can see in my screenshot.</p>
<p>I asked if the funds will be free to play and winnings eligible after the wagering requirement and was answered "Yes and all other winnings"</p>
<p>I only did not withdraw after meeting the wagering requirement (balance woukd have been about 200$ I guess at the time), BECAUSE I was answered this.</p>
<p>Otherwise, as I have always done in the past, I would have withdrawn and redeposit and have the same effective result.</p>
<p>Note that, all winnings above the 300$ cashout limit were accrued after the wagering requirement, which I SPECIFICALLY asked ahead of time time if the winnings would be eligible and was told yes.</p>
<p>Had I not been instructed that, my winnings would be eligible. The only reason they are voided is from what I was instructed.</p>
<p>Also of note, in this instance, I do not gain any unfair advantage from not withdrawing before the cashout limit, as there was a winnings limit, all play is effectively the same, withdrawn or not. Although, that is not the the basis of my complaint, as I understand that rules are rules. It does however shine light on the fact the refusal to pay up is not a matter of gaining an advantage through their CSR mistake, but the other way around where the CSR mistake is costing me.</p>
<p>I kept all screenshots public, as I do want the public to see for themselves, regardless of the outcome.</p>
