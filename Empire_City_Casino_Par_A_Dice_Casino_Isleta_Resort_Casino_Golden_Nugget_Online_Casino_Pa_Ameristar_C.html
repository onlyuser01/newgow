<p>Although a ban on gambling sponsorships in sports is looming and certainly going to kick in in the next couple of years, clubs and teams in the United Kingdom continue to seek out sponsorships with established bookmakers in the country. The Premier League club Burnley has become the latest to confirm a fresh sponsorship deal with W88, a local sports betting and casino gaming brand, with the company acting as an official shirt sponsor throughout the 2023/2024 season.</p>
<p>Burnley is of course not alone. Chelsea, Everton, and Brentford have all embraced such partnerships to some extent despite the scathing criticism of club loyalists and fans. Moving forward with Burnley, however, the W88 logo will now be visible on both the men’s and women’s first teams’ shirts in the upcoming Premier League campaign and the club’s return.</p>
<p>Burnley has introduced W88 as a renowned brand in an official press release, confident in the success of the partnership over the coming season. The soccer club insisted that W88 shares its own ethos for integrity, excellence, and trust, and all of that would translate into better customer experiences.</p>
<p>Apart from W88’s logo appearing on Burnley’s teams' shirts, the bookmaker will also have its assets visible at Turf Moor, which is Burnley’s home stadium. W88 has confirmed that it is going to engage with local community projects and initiatives as well. As to what the club thinks Burnley director Stuart Hunt assured fans that the move was a carefully-considered one, and said:</p>
<p>"Following lengthy discussions, we are pleased to confirm W88 as our front-of-shirt sponsor for the upcoming season. As a newly promoted club, a partnership such as this plays a significant role in helping us to compete in the Premier League."</p>
<p>He hailed W88 as a company that has already established successful partnerships with Premier League clubs in the past, and argued that the bookmaker had good ideas about how to develop such partnerships to the benefit of all parties.</p>
<p>W88 Business Development Manager Hilly Ehrlich was similarly pleased with the opportunity. Ehrlich said that his company was very passionate about Premier League soccer and that it was a great opportunity to see this new partnership between the organizations take place.</p>
