    <h1>Wildfire Casino Casino In South Bend Davincis Gold Casino Foxwoods Casino Login Foxwoods Casino Conn</h1>

<p>Spotlight Sports Group (SSG) has announced a strategic partnership with Sky Bet through which it will develop, host, and maintain a micro-site for the latter. The new site will feature SSG’s technology and Sky Bet’s Fan Hope Survey with YouGov. Apart from the main survey, fans will be able to vote on the new season in a mini-survey.</p>
<p>The New Micro-Site Will Drive Soccer Engagement</p>
<p>The new micro-site will showcase results from soccer teams from the English Premier League and Championship. Customers will be able to engage with the platform as the user experience will be enhanced with in-depth team analysis, best bets for upcoming games, previews of new signings, as well as season-long RequestABet. These services will be provided by SSG’s soccer experts.</p>
<p>Daniel Smith, the head of UK and Ireland sales at SSG, commented on the latest development by saying that the new site demonstrates SSG’s “industry-leading tech,” as well as its capabilities in terms of content creation and its array of proprietary data. He added that it is a real pleasure to be working with one of the UK’s leading operators ahead of the new soccer season, which is set to commence in August.</p>
<p>Smith ended by saying that this is set to be a major season, especially because the World Cup will begin in November and the goal at SSG is to provide customers with tech and content and help them be more creative.</p>
<p>Andrew Mook, the head of marketing strategy and planning at Sky Bet, stated that Sky Bet is excited to be partnering with SSG. He noted that SSG’s efforts for the Cheltenham micro-site, which was developed for Sky Bet earlier this year, proved that the customer experience can be boosted and that is exactly what Sky Bet aims to gain with this partnership.</p>
<p>SSG Recently Partnered With LiveScore Group</p>
<p>The world-leading content and media company has been quite busy in the recent period. At the start of July, SSG announced that it entered a strategic multi-year partnership with LiveScore Group. With the deal, LiveScore Group’s Virgin Bet and LiveScore Bet will be able to use Superfeed and ingest content from numerous international horse races.</p>
<p>The Racing Post content, which is available via Superfeed, will provide LiveScore Group’s two brands with racing coverage of over 60,000 races each year.</p>
<p>All of the efforts made by SSG in 2022 didn’t go unnoticed. The company was nominated for two awards at the 2022 SBC Awards, which are set to take place in September in Barcelona. SSG was shortlisted for Sports Data Product and Sports Affiliate of the Year.</p>
<p>Alan Davis, SSG’s head of B2B marketing, shared a few thoughts on the nominations. He said that both categories in which SSG is nominated represent distinguished parts of the business and acknowledged the fact that they “add to what has already been a strong year.”</p>
