    <h1>Dreams Casino 200 No Deposit Bonus Codes Sunland Park Casino Chukchansi Casino Coarsegold Livingston</h1>

<p>Yggdrasil, a leading supplier and publisher of online casino games and slots, has introduced Gold Fever, a slot game by AceRun, which is joining the innovative studio’s YG Masters program. AceRun and Yggdrasil previously introduced Book Hotfire in 2022 as part of the library and have been trusted partners ever since.</p>
<p>The game has designed an innovative gameplay in which players will step into the role of gold-obsessed miners and excavators who blast their way through rocks and mountains in the hope of securing a big score. Commenting on this new opportunity, Yggdrasil Head of Product and Programs Stuart McCarthy said:</p>
<p>"One of the standout features of the YG Masters program is the diversity and breadth of our content and we’re very pleased to roll out AceRun’s newest launch, Gold Fever."</p>
<p>The slot runs on a traditional three-by-five grid and players will be walked into the bowels of a mine where they will find all the tools a miner needs to excavate the precious metal. There are all sorts of tool symbols, dynamite, and even the proprietor himself, who runs the entire show. There is a big 1,080 multiplier to add to your good fortune as the mechanic will multiply your win potential significantly.</p>
<p>In addition, Gold Fever features Free Spins. The freebies are triggered with the dedicated Scatter Boxes, which you will need three of in order to enter the bonus level. The entire gameplay in Gold Fever is straightforward and rewarding, making for a highly-entertaining end product.</p>
<p>As a whole, Gold Fever is based on GATI, a technology stack that Yggdrasil deploys with partners and provides them with a regulation-ready and preconfiguredproduct. The stack is used to assist partner studios to cut development costs and benefit from rapid distribution thereafter.</p>
<p>Speaking of this latest release, AceRun Head of Development Jeroen van derHeijden added that his company was very happy to explore what he saw as a "hugely popular mining theme" and add the company’s own flavor to the genre.</p>
<p>"We’re excited about the potential of Gold Fever and further harnessing the power of the YG Masters program," Van Der Heijden concluded. Previously, Yggdrasil announced the launch of its Bugs Money slot, developed in collaboration with Reflex Gaming.</p>
