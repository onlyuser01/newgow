<p>Fly Cats Dream Drop review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Players will join a gang of especially cool cats with Fly Cats Dream Drop.</p>
<p>On a breezy New York rooftop, players will find a stage filled with felines ready to perform. If they can keep up with these urban kitties, players might just get to join the show.</p>
<p>This slot is the perfect pick for players who are in the mood for a touch of whimsy.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The soundtrack of Fly Cats Dream Drop is a meandering piano melody that brings to mind a distant carnival. Given that the cats are wearing ensembles associated with hip hop culture, it comes as a surprise that the soundtrack didn’t match this theme.</p>
<p>Occasionally, the sound of old-fashioned record scratches upholds the theme of this somewhat better. Players may also notice the distant sound of airplanes, adding to the rooftop atmosphere.</p>
<p>Among the cat characters, players will meet a chilled out black cat holding a can of spray paint, a grey cat holding a basketball, and a fluffy white cat wearing a golden crown and smoking a cigar.</p>
<p>The reels themselves are built into an outdoor stage with speakers on either side. Behind the reels, players will see the rooftops of other brick buildings as well as the distant silhouette of a feline statue of liberty.</p>
<p>Overall, the soundtrack and animation create an imaginative world of city cats.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Fly Cats Dream Drop is a five-reel, four-row slot, with 40 win lines.</p>
<p>The maximum win for this slot is 5,000x the player’s total bet.</p>
<p>The swift pace of the gameplay ensures that Fly Cats Dream Drop remains engaging.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Bonus symbol.</p>
<p>If players land a Mystery symbol on any reel, the Mystery respins feature begins. Mystery symbols have the special ability to transform into matching paying symbols.</p>
<p>If players land at least 3 Bonus symbols, the Sticky Wild Free Spins feature begins. The number of free spins awarded depends on the number of Bonus symbols that triggered the feature as follows:</p>
<p>3 Bonus symbols = 6 free spins</p>
<p>4 Bonus symbols = 8 free spins</p>
<p>5 Bonus symbols = 10 free spins</p>
<p>Whenever players land a Bonus symbol during the Free Spins feature, an additional free spin is awarded and the multiplier associated with all Sticky Wilds increases by +1.</p>
<p>The Dream Drop Bonus begins when players randomly score a ball through a hoop during a jackpot spin prior to a base game spin.</p>
<p>During the Dream Drop Bonus, there are 5 Jackpots that players can win: Rapid, Midi, Maxi, Major, and Mega. Players are presented with 15 options from which they will make selections until they find 3 matching Jackpots. Once they find these 3 matching Jackpots, the prize is awarded.</p>
