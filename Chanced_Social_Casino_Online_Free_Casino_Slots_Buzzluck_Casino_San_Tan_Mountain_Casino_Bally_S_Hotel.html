    <h1>Chanced Social Casino Online Free Casino Slots Buzzluck Casino San Tan Mountain Casino Bally S Hotel</h1>

<p>Spidervegas.com is breaking its T&amp;C and that affects the players from that countries bad as they always lose from this casino even its a bug/fault from the casino.</p>
<p>Article 2.3 Registration on SpiderVegas is not authorized for residents or citizens of the following countries: USA, Cura√ßao, Malta, Netherlands, Israel, Cyprus, Spain; Iran, North Korea.</p>
<p>However as a Dutch player you are able to create an account, in fact you will even see the country code number +31 by creating an account. If you only fill the address details without selecting a country ( which you can do by mistake if you use 'tab') you will be able to create an account and deposit and play and do everything you need. In fact on their website they even show iDeal which is a Dutch payment processor, which hints at they accept Dutch gamblers which is not. I don't know if its a casino bug but if they say unauthorized and you can play and lose or win money its a big deal.</p>
<p>Because of that T&amp;C breach I discovered my agreement is not valid I had with the casino and all deposits should be treated as undue payments and I expect Spidervegas to refund my deposits fully. I hope that CasinoGuru can help in this matter to get this resolved as this casino does not reply on my mails regarding this matter.</p>
<p>I did send an mail to certria@gaminglicenses.com but did not get any update from them. I do see that this casino set an IP block, however I still would like to see a refund of my deposits as I was able to join this casino something that should've not been the case and then I would neither win or lose from this casino.</p>
