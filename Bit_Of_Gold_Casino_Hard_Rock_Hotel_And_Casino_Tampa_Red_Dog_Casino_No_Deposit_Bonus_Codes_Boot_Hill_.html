<p>Days before the launch of the regulated iGaming market in Ontario, the Responsible Gambling Council (RGC) announced that its RG Check Accreditation Program is now a part of the requirements for operators that plan to launch their services. In a statement released Tuesday, the RGC congratulated the government in Ontario, iGaming Ontario (iGO) and the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario (AGCO) for supporting the responsible gambling efforts just ahead of the market launch planned for April 4, 2022.</p>
<p>RG Check Accreditation Program</p>
<p>RGC’s program was created back in 2010. The program was the result of consultations involving operators, players and policymakers that have experienced gambling harm. Land-based casinos in Ontario have already used the responsible gambling program.</p>
<p>Now, new operators that enter the iGaming market in the province will adhere to the program that seeks the highest standards of responsible gambling. According to the RGC, the program’s accreditation process “helps gambling venues and iGaming sites evaluate, monitor and manage all aspects of their RG strategy and operations.”</p>
<p>Ahead of the online gambling market launch in Ontario, RGC vowed to continue its collaboration with the government and iGO regarding the RG Check accreditation program. Ultimately, the Council is also planning to introduce additional measures that will boost the responsible gambling framework in the province.</p>
<p>The Program Helps Operators and Consumers</p>
<p>RGC’s director of standards and accreditation, Tracy Parker, revealed that it is exciting to be able to minimize gambling harm with the help of the program. She explained that the program will ensure that all operators have a “common approach to monitoring and assessment and provide a fair and transparent process.” In conclusion, Parker predicted that RGC’s collaboration will continue to bring improvements to the market in Ontario.</p>
<p>“The RG Check team is excited to make a contribution to a comprehensive RG framework with clear, evidence-based and impactful player protection measures that minimize potential harms associated with gambling.” Tracy Parker, director of standards and accreditation at RGC</p>
<p>RGC’s CEO, Shelley White, added that “RG Check is a clear and tangible signal of the government’s commitment to making public protection and sustainable play a priority and a key part of creating a culture of responsible gambling here in Ontario.” She outlined that RG Check is a proven program that is already in use by different jurisdictions globally.</p>
<p>“We are extremely pleased to be partnering with RGC on this initiative.” Martha Otton, executive director at iGaming Ontario</p>
<p>iGaming Ontario’s executive director, Martha Otton, revealed that it is exciting to join forces with the Council for this initiative. Otton pointed out that the program consists of nine standards as well as 48 criteria that “measure the scope and effectiveness of operators’ RG programming.”</p>
