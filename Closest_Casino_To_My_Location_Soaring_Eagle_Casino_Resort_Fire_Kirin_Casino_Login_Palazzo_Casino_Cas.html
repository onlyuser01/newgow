<p>Roulette is one of those games that have been around for over 300 years, and yet, it continues to surprise with the depth of its experience. There have been hundreds of books, fellow websites, and statistics that try to pinpoint the most successful roulette strategy that works and chart a general guide to roulette to use as a fallback solution. And, they all reach the same conclusion: there are no best roulette strategies.</p>
<p>Yet, long-term testing and a hands-on approach to roulette have shown that while you can match the casino advantage in the short-to-mid term, the inherent house edge will always get in the way. This is no reason why you shouldn’t stick with a roulette betting system that has proven efficacy even if chance will inevitably have the final say in how much you end up winning. Before you start playing real money roulette at an online casino, be sure to read through our guide below.</p>

<p>What Are the Most Successful Roulette Strategies?</p>
<p>Over the years, players and mathematicians have come together to find ways to defeat statistical probability in a game of roulette. Many have come with betting systems, mostly altering previously-discovered paradigms, but in any case, the majority of roulette strategies ended up disappointing and even costing players.</p>
<p>As a result, over the centuries, several types of roulette betting systems have emerged, proving their consistency and overall reliability. Today, you have not one but six such systems to choose from. The systems we know work for a fact today are:</p>
<p>Each of them has some specificity that makes it a preferred choice to some players. It may be a matter of being used to playing with one strategy or just a desire to mix things up and try to get an edge.</p>
<p>Either way, all of these strategies seem to do a pretty good job of providing you with a reliable betting sequence that has a very good chance of generating small incremental profit with no added risk.</p>
<p>Where do all roulette strategies fail? They are not fool-proof, and you will have to know when to call it quits, collect your winnings, and walk away. If you are looking to better differentiate between the available betting systems, we recommend considering the systems as progressive and non-progressive.</p>
<p>We will talk about this in a minute, but first, let’s see if there is one roulette strategy that works and allows you to win without having to watch over your back so often.</p>
<p>Does Any Roulette Strategy Work in the Long-Term?</p>
<p>Effectively, you would want to know what the most profitable roulette strategy is. This is a good attitude towards the game. After all, if you are going to wager real money, you might as well want to know what your chances of succeeding are.</p>
<p>However, casinos definitely won’t let you win as easily or even consistently. The house edge can throw a notorious spanner in the works pretty much at any point, and finding a betting system that works 100% is simply not an option.</p>
<p>Then again, you can always offset many of the risks by playing smart and betting small. Most players run into trouble if they bet too much at the beginning that they cross the table limit and cannot recover their losses.</p>
<p>While long-term success may be out of the question, this doesn’t mean that you can make do with the cards you have been dealt in the short term. Betting small means that you have more leeway, and placing Outside Bets gives you an almost 50% chance to win a selection.</p>
<p>Some betting systems allow you to make as many as ten bets before you do not stand a chance of recuperating your wager and any losses thereof. Overall, there is plenty of wiggle room you can navigate in, even if things do look a little overwhelming at first.</p>
<p>The best roulette strategies will always make a solution attainable but, to use another gambling metaphor, make sure to not overplay your hand.</p>
<p>Progressive Roulette Betting Systems</p>
<p>The first type of roulette strategy is the so-called progressive system. They are quick and easy to understand and often preferred by players who are new to the game or new to strategizing about roulette altogether.</p>
<p>Martingale</p>
<p>Some popular choices here include Martingale and Fibonacci, both of which are considered staple roulette betting systems. The one to take precedence is Martingale, naturally, as it’s much easier to comprehend.</p>
<p>Martingale essentially tells you to bet a unit and then double after every loss. Assuming you are playing at a table with a $2,000 betting limit and a minimum bet size of $1, your progression if you lost 11 times in a row, would look like this:</p>
<p>Losing 11 times in a row is not very likely to happen, but there is a slim chance that eventually, it would. Martingale allows you to register an incremental profit of $1 per successful bet, so you would need to arm yourself with patience.</p>
<p>Fibonacci</p>
<p>Another popular choice is Fibonacci. Fibonacci is a mathematical sequence that you can find in nature. This roulette strategy may look a little more complicated to comprehend, but it’s just like Martingale, a sequence of numbers you follow religiously. Here is what it looks like:</p>
<p>The system may appear a little riskier than Martingale, but here is the plot twist – it really isn’t. If anything, Fibonacci is the type of roulette strategy you ought to stick to if you are really keen on staying safe.</p>
<p>Inverse Martingale or Paroli</p>
<p>Another variation of a popular roulette strategy is the Inverse Martingale or Paroli. Here, you would want to double your bet after every win, which statistically makes it slightly safer than the traditional system.</p>
<p>The system is once again best tailored to outside bets, as you need the highest possible statistical chance to win, which is nearly 50% with most outside bets. Now, some versions of the game, such as American, may have a slightly steeper edge, so consider this as well.</p>
<p>D’Alembert</p>
<p>No roulette strategies guide would be quite complete without referencing to D’Alembert. D’Alembert is another progressive stratagem, and only this time players will not pursue aggressive stake hikes.</p>
<p>Instead, you bet in flat amounts. The first step is to pick a betting unit. Usually, around 0.50% of your total bankroll as long as that fits the minimum betting limit. In this strategy, you want to increase or decrease your bet size by one unit depending on whether you have won or lost. Here is an example:</p>
<p>Round 1 – Bet 1 – Win</p>
<p>Round 2 – Bet 1 – Lose</p>
<p>Round 3 – Bet 2 – Lose</p>
<p>Round 4 – Bet 3 – Lose</p>
<p>Round 5 – Bet 4 – Win</p>
<p>Round 6 – Bet 3 – Lose</p>
<p>Round 7 – Bet 4 – Lose</p>
<p>Round 8 – Bet 5 – Win</p>
<p>Round 9 – Bet 4 – Win</p>
<p>This is just one way to look at D’Alembert. The principle is pretty simple – progress slowly, either up or down.</p>
<p>So long as you have money left, you are not likely to ever hit the table limit, which means you can take D’Alembert to low-limit tables, too!</p>
<p>Labouchere</p>
<p>Labouchere is another fun roulette strategy to factor in. It basically tells you to take an amount you wish to win and break it down into multiple bets. Once again, you are not very likely to run out of betting room for having reached the threshold.</p>
<p>Here is how it works. Let’s say you want to be $10. All you need to do is split this amount into multiple individual amounts you are willing to bet. Here is an example:</p>
<p>To start, you take the leftmost and rightmost numbers, and in this case $3, and bet it. If you lose, you add the number on the right side of the sequence, so it looks like this:</p>
<p>If you win, however, you will simply cross out the numbers on the left and right that you just used to bet with, like this:</p>
<p>How you order the original sequence is entirely up to you, which gives you a lot of flexibility and say in what happens next!</p>
<p>Non-Progressive Roulette Strategies</p>
<p>Non-progressive roulette betting systems are exactly what they sound like. You will no longer need to worry about upping the ante after every bet you have placed. These strategies are anti-climactic, and they want to keep you safe while winning more.</p>
<p>James Bond</p>
<p>This is a very simple flat system where you don’t have to increase the value of your bets. It was actually designed by Ian Fleming, the father of the James Bond franchise. Remember when you asked if there are the best roulette bet combinations?</p>
<p>According to Ian Fleming, there are. You will basically want to make the same bet after every spin, which is:</p>
<p>$14 on 19-36</p>
<p>$5 on 13-14-15-16-17-18</p>
<p>$1 on 0</p>
<p>Now, this seems a little risky since you are not going to stick with the regular Even/Odd bets as well. This strategy is far riskier because it takes in luck more so than the other strategies here.</p>
<p>The main issue is the house edge which will inevitably play a role. However, even if you ended up losing, your losses are not very likely to be too high.</p>
<p>Roulette Strategy Fallacies</p>
<p>Naturally, there are some fallacies that have been romanticized and taken as true through repetition. Yet, this doesn’t make them any truer, nor does it give you an edge over the casino. There are clear-cut mathematical rules that say otherwise.</p>
<p>Some people argue that clever calculations and analysis of the numbers that have already been played will give you a better understanding of what numbers are most likely to appear next.</p>
<p>Years of experience have taught manufacturers and casinos how to work out the blemishes in production and create a roulette table that is completely unbiased and, therefore, impossible to predict.</p>
<p>In other words, instead of looking for an ultimate solution in terms of roulette strategy, you need to acknowledge the deficiencies of the proven betting systems and play to their strengths. To make this easier for you, we have collected some of the fallacies that are commonly associated with roulette strategies.</p>
<h1>1 There Are Lucky Numbers</h1>
<p>You may be convinced that some numbers are definitely better than others when it comes to roulette. Yet, there is absolutely no evidence to support this. If you took 10,000 spins of the wheel, you should get a perfectly asymmetrical result, with no specific number favored heavily over another.</p>
<h1>2 You Can Predict the Next Pocket Win</h1>
<p>There are some anecdotal stories where scientists tried to gauge the speed of the wheel and thus have a good idea of which sector of the wheel the ball would land. However, thinking you can bring the equipment to cheat in a real casino setting is a little over the top.</p>
<h1>3 The Games Are Rigged</h1>
<p>No, the games are not rigged, nor can they be. So long as you stick with reputable casino brands and establishments, the fairness of the outcomes should never be an issue. All games are audited by independent third parties to add safety to the overall offer.</p>
<h1>4 There Are Best Bet Combinations</h1>
<p>In theory, there are betting combinations that are more likely to occur than others. Broadly speaking, outside bets are the best ones to place. If you try to run the inside bets, though, you ought to realize that you will be taking on a disproportionate amount of risk compared to any potential gains.</p>
<h1>5 All Roulettes Are Similar</h1>
<p>While the roulette wheel is certainly similar across different game versions, the house edge isn’t. While all games will settle for the same wheel, more or less, there may be an added zero (0) that makes the house edge slightly more unfavorable. Players are best advised to play European or French Roulette, as they offer the best house edge.</p>
<p>So, What’s the Most Profitable Roulette Strategy?</p>
<p>This will ultimately come down to how many times you have won. This is a uniquely personal experience because it takes into consideration the system you use, the time you have spent on it, and your own bet size. In essence, all roulette strategies we have listed here will be worthwhile and powerful allies when you take your game to the casino. If you feel like you’re ready to try one of the strategies, head on over to our recommended real money casinos.</p>
