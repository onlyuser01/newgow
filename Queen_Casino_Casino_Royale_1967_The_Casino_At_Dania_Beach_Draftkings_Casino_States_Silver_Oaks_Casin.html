    <h1>Queen Casino Casino Royale 1967 The Casino At Dania Beach Draftkings Casino States Silver Oaks Casin</h1>

<p>please note that my first name is Vicki not Virginia &amp; I'm in Kansas not Missouri!</p>
<p>Slots Garden owes me $2400 from 2 seperate w/draws!</p>
<p>I have several Live Chat Transcripts, my Transaction History &amp; Gmails to submit to back up my claims &amp; prove my w/draw requests are for legitimate wins!</p>
<p>KEY IMPORTANT DETAILS</p>
<p>DEC 01 - Deposited $30 via CapFed Visa Debit w/ SANTASMONTH Coupon &amp; lost it all!</p>
<p>Recvd LOYALTY Chip of $18. Completed Playthrough &amp; Requested MaxCO of $100 via BTC.</p>
<p>DEC 04 - Deposited $30 via CapFed Visa Debit w/ COMEBACK250 Coupon.</p>

<p>DEC 05 - Requested $2300 Withdraw via BTC.</p>
<p>DEC 17 - Canceled $800 Withdraw Requested DEC 04, Lost it All.</p>
<p>LAST TRANSACTION TO DATE.</p>
<p>During these 21 days since winning I have been told I cannot be paid via BTC because I didn't deposit w/ BTC &amp; must send my Bank Details for a WIRE TRANSFER!</p>
<p>After days of refusing to give in to their request, which I did because a few years ago I had requested a Bank Transfer for a withdraw from Raging Bull &amp; was denied it becuz my bank , CAPFED, supposedly didn't do International Wire Transfers(not true) &amp; they tried forcing me to go Crypto if i wanted my $$ &amp; my $$ ended up back in their bank &amp; not mine! I sent them emails &amp; Live Chat explaining that very situation to them &amp; they still demanded I provide the details &amp; my bank statement if i want my $$! I sent it ALL several times &amp; yesterday I got an email &amp; was told by Live Chat that CapFed isn't one they send Wire Transfers to &amp; they now are DEMANDING I CHANGE BANKS or OPEN A 2ND ACCOUNT AT A BANK ON THEIR LIST if I want paid!</p>
<p>AIN'T HAPPENING, GURU!!!</p>
<p>Please help me either get it put back on the Visa I deposited with or in my BTC Wallet!!! I have spent a fortune at many of their sites &amp; my wins are well-deserved &amp; legit!!
