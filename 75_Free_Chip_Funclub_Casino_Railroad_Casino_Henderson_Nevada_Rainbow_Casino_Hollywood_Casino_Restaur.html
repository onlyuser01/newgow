    <h1>75 Free Chip Funclub Casino Railroad Casino Henderson Nevada Rainbow Casino Hollywood Casino Restaur</h1>

<p>The two companies expanded their deal to a second US state after the success they saw in New Jersey</p>
<p>One of the world’s leading real-money gaming suppliers and developers of casino content, Design Works Gaming (DWG), has announced it expanded its partnership with the gaming and entertainment industry giant, Rush Street Interactive (RSI). Under the terms of the freshly minted deal, DWG agreed to supply its portfolio of content for RSI’s BetRivers brand in Michigan.</p>
<p>The strategic announcement helps further expand the reach of DWG content. In fact, the recent launch marks the second US state where RSI offers games from the leading iGaming developer. Initially, the duo signed a similar deal for the regulated gambling market in New Jersey.</p>
<p>Now, thanks to the freshly minted partnership extension, BetRivers customers in Michigan will be able to tap into Break the Bounty LuckyTap, 10X Fortune and Double Fancy 7s slot games, which have been integrated with the OpenGaming platform from Light &amp; Wonder. Moreover, the duo confirmed plans to introduce additional titles for players in the state soon.</p>
<p>In addition to the expanded deal with DWG, RSI confirmed a recent senior-level hire. The company revealed it hired the services of Eric Althaus, a casino industry veteran with significant experience, for the role of general manager at Rivers Casino Philadelphia.</p>
<p>The Two Companies Are Delighted to Expand Their Collaboration</p>
<p>DWG’s CEO, Troy Zurawski, shared his excitement about the latest collaboration. He acknowledged that the company’s expectations were surpassed after the initial launch with RSI earlier this year. Zurawski added: “RSI knows their player base inside and out and together we’ve been able to provide casino games we know are going to resonate with their customers keeping them engaged and entertained.” Finally, he said that DWG is excited to see its content reach new customers in Michigan.</p>
<p>“Since we first launched with RSI earlier this year, performance has far exceeded our expectations.“ Troy Zurawski, CEO of DWG</p>
<p>Richard Schwartz, RSI’s CEO, was also excited about the expanded partnership with DWG. He explained that the content from the leading iGaming developer resonates well with the quality offering the customers of the BetRivers brand are used to. Finally, Schwartz said that the company is thrilled to expand its offering for BetRivers customers in Michigan.</p>
