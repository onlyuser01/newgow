    <h1>Red Rock Casino Rooms Casino Madison Wi Skydream Casino Aliante Hotel And Casino Grand Z Casino Love</h1>

<p>This casino is the biggest fraud in the market. Supposedly, payouts take between 7-21 business days.</p>
<p>If you have any inquiries via email, you don't get any response.</p>
<p>The live chat is completely useless. The chat immediately gets closed off the moment you ask a question.</p>
<p>You never get an answer to your question. For instance, I asked under which license the casino operates. Response: it's all on the site. And then the chat is closed off without any further messages. Inquiries about the progression status are answered each time with the same response. Between 7-21 days, the payout is in progress. What nonsense. They will never pay out the money. I've done some research and the address the casino provided doesn't even exist. It's horrendous. You'd just love to jump through the chat and grab the person responding. It makes you so angry! No casino in the world takes more than 7 days for a payout. Then why do they come up with 7-21 business days?</p>
<p>Is anyone else also having this issue? How can we put a stop to these fraudulent gangs? They simply should not exist. Deposits appear in 2 seconds. Withdrawals, you never get at all.</p>
<p>Perhaps we could reach them through their payment providers? Maybe through the game providers? There must be a way to reach the people behind this.</p>
