<p>Dear Campa171,</p>
<p>I understand your frustration, but please bear in mind that every bonus can have its specific rules or conditions, some bonuses are a limed offer for a couple of days or any other special occasion. Some bonuses can be offered specifically to a certain player, this is solely up to the casino which bonuses are offered and to who they are offered. Not all these situations can be and are covered in the main Bonus T&amp;Cs or General casino T&amp;Cs, thus we always strongly advise all players to read the terms and conditions carefully before claiming any bonus.</p>
<p>I can empathize with you that the casino has really not fairly accused you of multi-accounting, but as I mentioned previously this has been clarified and even the casino in their response wrote that this was not the reason why your winnings have not been paid. It was because you have not made a deposit of at least €20 or equivalent on the website within the last 30 days. When you request a withdrawal only then a full review of the requirements and the player's gameplay is done, so only after this review can a final decision be made if the player is or is not entitled to their winnings.</p>
<p>Sadly, in this case, even you wrote that you didn't fulfill the condition of a deposit of at least €20 or equivalent on the website within the last 30 days we can't disagree with the casino's decision.</p>
<p>Due to the aforementioned reasons, this complaint will now be rejected. Thank you for your understanding, I am sorry we could not be of more help on this occasion. Please do not hesitate to contact us if you run into any issues with this or any other casino in the future.</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Michal</p>
