<p>Nigeria vs. South Africa is a semifinal game of the 2024 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON). The match is on the program on Wednesday, February 7, 2024, at Stade de la Paix in Bouake, Ivory Coast</p>
<p>Nigeria is the top favorite to win the 2024 AFCON, which is no surprise as this team has won each of its last four games without conceding a single goal. However, the Super Eagles still havenâ€™t played against such a giant slayer as South Africa.</p>
<p>Bafana Bafana have already defeated a couple of real heavyweights, most notably, Morocco. Can they add another win to their portfolio?</p>

<p>Super Eagles Want to Keep Their Good Run Going</p>
<p>In Nigeriaâ€™s first game at the 2024 AFCON, Equatorial Guinea managed to hold them to a 1-1 draw even though the Super Eagles were the ones to attack with all they had throughout the game.</p>
<p>They didnâ€™t let the result upset them as evident from the fact that they then went on to win the next four games, keeping a clean sheet each time.</p>

<p>In the group stage, we saw them win the tournament host Ivory Coast, as well as Guinea Bissau. Then, they beat Cameroon 2-0 in the round of 16, with both goals scored by Ademola Lookman whoâ€™s pushing hard in his conquest for the AFCON MVP award. Atlantaâ€™s winger was the one to score the only goal in the quarterfinal game against Angola.</p>
<p>Heâ€™s been great so far, but the best thing for Nigeriaâ€™s fans is that their team isnâ€™t a one-man army. Super Eagles have plenty of amazing players on the roster, including Napoliâ€™s Victor Oshimen, Fulhamâ€™s Alex Iwobi, and others.</p>
<p>Can Bafana Bafana Slay Another Giant?</p>
<p>South Africaâ€™s AFCON campaign started with a 2-0 loss to Mali. However, in their second game of the tournament, Bafana Bafana defeated Namibia 4-0.</p>
<p>Then, they drew 0-0 with Tunisia in a game in which they were +250 underdogs. It was their first game of the knockout stage when they really upset the odds. They entered the round of 16 duel with Morocco as +625 underdogs but ended up winning the World Cup semifinalists 2-0.</p>
<p>They were incredible defensively in that game, working hard as a collective to keep Morocco far away from their goal. South Africans did something similar in the semifinal game with Cape Verde. Even though they were on the back foot throughout the match, they ended up winning by penalties after 0-0 in regulation.</p>
<p>Nigeria vs. South Africa Prediction</p>
<p>What we predict to see in the 2024 AFCON game on Wednesday is that Nigeria will be the team to attack through the game, with South Africa building a wall in front of its goal.</p>
<p>The good news for Super Eagles is that with players like Lookman and Oshimen, they should be able to tear down Bafana Bafanaâ€™s defensive wall.</p>
<p>Pick: Nigeria</p>
