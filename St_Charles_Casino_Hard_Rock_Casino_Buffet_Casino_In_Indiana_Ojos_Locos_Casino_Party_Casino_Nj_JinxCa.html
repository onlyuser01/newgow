    <h1>St Charles Casino Hard Rock Casino Buffet Casino In Indiana Ojos Locos Casino Party Casino Nj JinxCa</h1>

<p>Hello Kristina,</p>
<p>may i disagree with you just a little bit in a polite manner? ðŸ™‚</p>
<p>Before I start - please, check this Pelican casino review on Casino.Guru.</p>
<p>Do you see the information in the red? "Fake games"</p>
<p>Aside of the fact that the title you chose for this complaint is a bit humiliating, it also doesn't express the essence of this issue. Your assumption is that my problem is low RTP of their games; partially correct, but if taken isolated, inherently wrong ðŸ™‚ Please note that I have been playing slots for a decade, while I also have a tiny bit better understanding of the IT side of things than an average player, thus I am aware e.g. of techniques how to spot fake games.</p>
<p>I have sent you one proof of their games to be fake in the attachment when posting this complaint - if you need more, I can send more, but all of them will be the same level of (un)intelligibility like the original one. It is completely understandable if you don't understand it completely (or at least what it represents) if you are not IT savvy; therefore I would like to encourage you to ask one of the IT guys there in casino.guru for assistance. I'm sure that together you will come to similar conclusions like me (as well as like the mentioned 3rd party where i verified my words).</p>
<p>In short, every honest casino site that wants to host a provider's slot games on their site is required to "connect" the player with the official server (maybe there are also other possible channels or ways to implement this - but all of them must be legit and official). Thanks to this, you could check if you are communicating with a game hosted on a server with officially known domain while you play.</p>
<p>To be exact here, legit Novomatic games are hosted on servers with domain like nrgs-b2b.greentube.com.mt, (there are also few slightly different ones, but there is always included the "greentube" somewhere in the domain). You could check in my screenshots that the domain on the jinxcasino is something like cdn.sslgames.net. This domain is also the same like the one where NetEnt games are hosted - this makes the situation 10x more eyebrow-raising ðŸ™‚</p>
<p>To make it even simpler - imagine that you somehow manage to steal graphics and overall engine of a slot software provider and you would create literally the same game(s) on your own computer, and you would run your own casino with that games. They would look exactly the same, but you would have 100% control over every aspect of the gameplay (for example, you could set RTP to 0% anytime you want; or add a new winning symbol of a fat pink unicorn into a game containing only fruit symbols).</p>
