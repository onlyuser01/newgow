<p>CT Interactive Dives into the Swiss Market Once Again</p>
<p>As a supplier, CT Interactive has been enjoying surging popularity in Europe, seeing both its classic and innovative titles strike home with a diverse range of audiences. This new opportunity in Switzerland further allows the company to stay focused on providing quality iGaming product and allow partners in local jurisdictions to grow their engagement and retention rates organically through innovative content.</p>
<p>CT Interactive is similarly prepared to further capitalize on the constantly-expanding market in Switzerland, offering a range of partners exciting products to deploy with their customer bases.

Commenting on this new opportunity, CT Interactive head of CRM Silvia Hristova said:</p>
<p>We are thrilled to bring our exciting games to the Swiss players also through this exciting partnership.

CT Interactive head of CRM Silvia Hristova</p>
<p>Hristova said that the supplier was very happy to have this opportunity to enter another exciting partnership and ensure that Swiss players have access to outstanding content as they play locally. In the meantime, CT Interactive has been enjoying strong global growth and expansion.</p>
<p>CT Interactive Looks Well Beyond Switzerland</p>
<p>The company teamed up with Sazka – Allwyn International earlier this month, agreeing to deploy its content with yet another esteemed partner. Similarly, the content supplier has been growing its offer in Italy with a BetFlag partnership.</p>
<p>Europe has been a focal point of CT Interactive’s ongoing efforts, with the company also providing its products to Favbet Online Casino in Croatia. Beyond the region, CT Interactive has also tied strategic content alliances in Latin America, another surging market and opportunity for CT Interactive to deliver outstanding games.</p>
