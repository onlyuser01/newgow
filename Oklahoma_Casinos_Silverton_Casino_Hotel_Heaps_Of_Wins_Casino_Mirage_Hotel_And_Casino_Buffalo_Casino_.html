    <h1>Oklahoma Casinos Silverton Casino Hotel Heaps Of Wins Casino Mirage Hotel And Casino Buffalo Casino</h1>

<p>Blondel Cluff, held the role of a chair of the National Lottery Community Fund for two years until her early resignation dating back to last summer. As a result, Paul Sweeney was appointed to the role of interim chair on August 1, 2023, for a 1-year contract or until a permanent chair is appointed, whichever is sooner.</p>
<p>Now, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) initiated the search for a new National Lottery Community Fund chair earlier this week. Details regarding the job position were released publicly by the DCMS. January 10 marked the opening date for applications with the deadline for submission of applications set for February 7, 2024, at 11:59 PM. The first interviews are expected to start on April 17, 2024, but the DCMS confirmed that the aforementioned timelines may be subject to change.</p>
<p>The search for a permanent chair of the National Lottery Community Fund comes after recently it launched its new strategy, “It starts with community,” setting a number of objectives through 2030. Under the new strategy, the Fund anticipates distributing some £4 billion ($5.1 billion) of funding by 2030. This funding will provide vital support for different community projects. Throughout 2023, the Fund made nearly 14,000 grants, representing one grand for every 7 minutes.</p>
<p>The Vacant Role Represents an Incredible Opportunity</p>
<p>The new chair of the Fund is expected to have a deep understanding of the charity and community sectors. According to the criteria for the role, the successful candidate must have “a track record of strategic leadership in civil society, public service, or business,” along with pristine interpersonal and communication skills. Additionally, the preferred candidate for the chair role should demonstrate commitment to the Fund’s mission, among other relevant requirements.</p>
<p>“This is an incredible opportunity to Chair a high-profile UK public body that places social connections and community activities at the heart of creating healthier, happier lives and a flourishing society,“ reads the description of the role released by the DCMS</p>
<p>The remuneration listed for the Fund’s chair position is £40,000 annually in exchange for two working days per week. The term of the contract is listed as four years which is not uncommon considering that the former chair was appointed in February 2021 for a contract that was expected to run through February 2025.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Brigid Simmonds, the chair of the Betting and Gaming Council, confirmed her plans to exit the organization. Simmonds confirmed she will step down effective from April 20, 2024. The vacant role will be filled by Michael Dugher, who will step in as the new chair of the BGC, effective from April 21, 2023.</p>
