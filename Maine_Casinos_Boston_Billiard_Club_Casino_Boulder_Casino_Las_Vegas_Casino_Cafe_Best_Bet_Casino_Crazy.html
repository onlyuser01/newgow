    <h1>Maine Casinos Boston Billiard Club Casino Boulder Casino Las Vegas Casino Cafe Best Bet Casino Crazy</h1>

<p>To summarize - you have already played on the "old" website, and the casino has not paid your winnings and has asked you to start playing on the "new" site, which should credit your winnings. This is correct?:</p>
<p>I played on the old site, and had the value of over $300 dollars in my account, I don't remember the exact real money balance amount.</p>
<p>After the site changed the money was gone from my account, I contacted them and they sent me this message.</p>
<p>(Log in and you will see your balance.</p>
<p>Please note that the new site is in EURO so we have converted your available balance.)</p>
<p>They added 250 euros to my account, and a bonus of another 250 euros to my account.</p>
<p>When trying to make a withdrawal it said that my funds were insufficient and appeared with â‚¬0.00,</p>
<p>I contacted the site again and was told that I had to complete the bonus requirements in order to request a withdrawal.</p>
<p>I contacted them again and mentioned that the balance I had before the site changed was real money, and that I didn't have any bonuses, that they had added this bonus to my account.</p>
<p>Then they told me to contact the old provider and pass their old URL that they would have to pay my earnings.</p>
