<p>Prominent online sports betting operator Betr has officially launched its real-money sportsbook product in Virginia. This expansion marks Betr’s third venture into real money online sports betting, following successful forays into Ohio and Massachusetts. The move hopes to leverage Betr Media’s success, engaging sports fans to drive users to the gambling product.</p>
<p>The Launch Marks 2023’s Third Major Expansion</p>
<p>Following successful rollouts in Ohio and Massachusetts, Betr is expanding its footprint in Virginia, bringing a world-class sports betting experience to the state’s residents. The operator’s app is now available on the iOS and Google Play stores, giving sports fans a novel way to engage with their favorite teams.</p>
<p>The popularity of Betr’s media offerings should provide a robust foundation for its Virginia debut. According to the company’s previous estimations, 20% of its media audience organically converted to its real-money gambling product, with additional onboarding efforts increasing that number. Betr founder and CEO Joey Levy noted that the launch’s strategic timing would bolster its impact and bring in new users.</p>
<p>We are thrilled to continue expanding our online sports betting business by launching in Virginia just in time for the NFL season. Joey Levy, Betr founder, and CEO</p>
<p>According to Levy, the Virginia launch would be the last debut of the company’s V0 product as Betr’s V1 Sportsbook nears completion. He was optimistic regarding the state’s potential market, highlighting its active fan base across collegiate and professional sports. Although Virginia marks Betr’s last planned expansion in 2023, the operator is preparing to take the following year by storm with its new and improved product.</p>
<p>The Company Maintains Its Focus on Innovation</p>
<p>Betr currently operates its OSB product V0, which will continue to serve Ohio, Massachusetts, and Virginia. This beta version of the sportsbook gives users a taste of what Betr can offer while allowing the company to gather valuable insights and feedback from its user base in available jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Looking ahead to 2024, Betr has ambitious plans for its V1 OSB product. This upgraded offering will deliver a fully-featured sportsbook with extensive betting options and sports coverage. Betr’s commitment to innovation and customer satisfaction remains at the forefront of its mission as it prepares to launch V1 in the first half of 2024.</p>
<p>A robust product roadmap and a user-centric approach perfectly position Betr to thrive in the dynamic and competitive world of online sports betting. The company’s successful Series A2 funding provided it with the necessary capital to compete with industry heavyweights, and its newest expansion means the future looks bright for Betr and its customers in Virginia and beyond.</p>
