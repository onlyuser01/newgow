<p>Hi Veronica,</p>
<p>thank you for the quick reply! Sorry been busy with Christmas !</p>
<p>So I originally won $900 and requested the withdrawal on November 9th.</p>
<p>After waiting, and speaking with the customer service I was asked to send an email to risk management as my account was in arrears. This was on November 15th, I was told they would return my email no later than 2-3 business days.</p>
<p>I emailed them again on November 20Th, i finally got a reply back from "Katie" asking for my bank statement. I emailed her back right away with the documents she requested.</p>
<p>After no response I emailed them again multiple times on November 21st with no response. Finally on November 22nd I got a reply asking where the banks statements for March and April with account ending in ****.</p>
<p>I replied back to Katie stating I didn’t have a bank account with those numbers, never have. I email her a few more times with no response till the 27th. I have now lost $200 by playing in the time I was waiting and was requesting my withdrawal now for $700. The email now i received was "I have reviewed the deposits made with xx8504, multiple transactions were made with this card. Each transaction had consistent IP network hits, confirming that there is no indication of any unauthorised access. The security of your devices within your household is your responsibility and this includes who does and does not have access to your mobile/PC and credit card information.</p>
<p>I can reverse part of your withdrawal to clear your total arrears of $549 and can then release the remainder of your withdrawal."</p>
<p>So I reply back right away stating that the dates they have for those arrears I was in the hospital delivering my son who was stillborn. So it couldn’t have been me or my family as we were ALL at the hospital.</p>
<p>No response back again, I sent another email on dec 1, dec 2, dec 5th. Finally I got a reply on the 5th from Katie "Hello Jessica,</p>
<p>As mentioned in my previous email, I can reverse part of your winnings to clear your arrears.</p>
<p>Then the remainder of your withdrawal can be released. Are you happy to do this?"</p>
<p>She ignored everything I had explained to her and had zero empathy.</p>
<p>So as of today they will make me pay the arrears of over $500 if I want any of my 700 winnings.</p>
