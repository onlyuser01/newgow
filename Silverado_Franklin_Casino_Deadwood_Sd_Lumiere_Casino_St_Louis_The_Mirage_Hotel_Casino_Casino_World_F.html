<p>More betting rules were approved almost a month after the state passed the first batch of regulations</p>
<p>North Carolina online sports betting inches closer to reality as legislators complete a final rulemaking step. The North Carolina State Lottery Commission, the state’s gambling regulator, continues to push for a smooth and frictionless launch.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the commission approved another set of rules for online sports betting in the state. This came almost a month after the regulator greenlit the first batch of rules, outlining some of the rules operators and players will have to follow.</p>
<p>The commenting period for the previous rules package was closed on November 27. The rules were approved by the Sports Betting Advisory Committee, adding a small change that prevents marketing affiliates from using net sports betting revenue as a compensation method. However, that rule was eventually taken out of the NC betting rules package. In addition, a measure that would have prevented sportsbooks from securing stadium naming rights was removed as well.</p>
<p>Operators Can Apply by December 27</p>
<p>The gambling regulator will now deal with the operator applications. According to the North Carolina State Lottery Commission, there are currently 14 gambling operators applying for a license in the state. Companies can apply for a license by December 27.</p>
<p>Under North Carolina’s gambling rules, online sports betting operators will have to form partnerships with local entities. A number of influential companies have already secured agreements with local sports organizations. These include Bet365, which teamed up with the Charlotte Hornets, ESPN Bet, which will work together with the Quail Hollow Club and FanDuel, which penned an agreement with the PGA Tour.</p>
<p>Other organizations that can serve as partners to online sportsbooks include the Carolina Hurricanes, the Carolina Panthers, Charlotte Motor Speedway, Charlotte FC, NASCAR, NC Courage and North Wilkesboro Speedway.</p>
<p>The NC Lottery was unable to provide a potential launch date for sports betting. According to the body’s deputy executive director of gaming compliance and sports betting, Sterl Carpenter, the launch will not happen in time for the Super Bowl. Other experts have suggested that the launch may not happen in time for March Madness either.</p>
<p>In any case, under North Carolina’s gambling legislation, betting must launch by June 14, 2024, at the latest. According to regulators, more accurate news about the launch date of sports betting may be provided after the end of the application process.</p>
