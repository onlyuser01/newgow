<p>MGA Games, a developer of slot games, video bingo and table games, has forayed into Colombia thanks to its agreement with Betfair. Under its deal with the operator, the supplier will power its product offering with its acclaimed titles.</p>
<p>MGA Games Makes a Foray into Colombia</p>
<p>MGA Games is famous for producing games that are fully localized for the markets where it operates. As a result, players in Colombia will now be able to access the studio’s exciting titles through the Betfair platform, MGA Games announced in a LinkedIn release.</p>
<p>A few of the developer’s titles are already available to local audiences, including hit 5-reel slot games such as Castle Slots, Gold Mermaid by Renata Gonzalez, Golden Throne, Lucky Dragon and Wild Africa.</p>
<p>All of the aforementioned titles are designed for mobile devices, allowing customers to enjoy them on the go. In addition, the aforementioned games leverage MGA Games’ proprietary Triple View system, allowing users to enjoy smooth and high-quality gaming experiences. Furthermore, MGA Games’ titles offer incredibly fast download speeds that allow players to get to playing in no time, skipping the drag of waiting.</p>
<p>Betfair will, therefore, enhance its portfolio with games that are sure to attract new customers. It will join the list of operators partnering with MGA Games, which includes many notable companies. Some of the developer’s most recent partners include Fair Play Casinos and the Italian aggregator Microgame.</p>
<p>The Developer’s Sales Director Is Excited about the Deal</p>
<p>Javier Lanfranchi, MGA Games’ sales director, spoke about the launch in Colombia. He called Latin America a very important market for the developer. Lanfranchi explained that establishing a strong footprint in LATAM and Colombia is a key part of the company’s internationalization strategy.</p>
<p>The sales director added that such expansion is always more delightful when done with a reliable partner such as Betfair. Lanfranchi lauded Betfair as “one of the most important international operators” and said that he is happy that MGA Games has such good relations with the operator. He remarked that this agreement brings great joy to the developer’s entire team.</p>
<p>Lanfranchi said that he is convinced the agreement will be very beneficial to both parties involved. He promised that MGA Games will continue its commitment to excellence as it powers Betfair with its best-in-class slots titles. The director concluded that he is sure Betfair Colombia customers are going to love what the two companies have to offer.</p>
