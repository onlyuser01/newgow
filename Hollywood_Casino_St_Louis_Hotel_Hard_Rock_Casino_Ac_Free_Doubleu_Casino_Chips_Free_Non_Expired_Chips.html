<p>Sightline Payments, a global processor of financial transactions, is firmly expanding in the North American market, with Canada being one of its key markets. To support this expansion, the company has been actively hiring and promoting specialists to ensure that it may continue to dominate the digital payments space as it seeks a bigger piece of the market.</p>
<p>Expanding in Canada and Beyond Home US Bastion</p>
<p>As a result, the company has promoted Tamara Tenenbaum as its new SVP of business development and managing director for Canada. Another hire is Brian Cottengim who is stepping in as the company’s SVP of client solutions strategy. Part of his duties will be to reach out to casino resorts in Canada and make sure that they are beginning to look into or adopt the Play+ cashless gambling system.</p>
<p>While cashless gaming has hit a few snags, the pandemic has really boosted interest in alternative, safer forms of payments. Not least, cashless gaming is touted as a way to clamp down on a range of issues, such as obfuscating funds or even avoiding paying one’s child support. Not least, the team is hiring Will Hill who will be VP of business development.</p>
<p>Hill will be in touch with various regulators, officials, and potential business partners in Canada. All three executives are brought in to reinforce Sightline Payments sprawling network of business opportunities in Canada. Commenting on this opportunity, Sightline co-CEO Joe Pappano welcomed the trio for joining the company:</p>
<p>I’m pleased to welcome Tamara and Will to the Sightline Canada team, where they will play an integral role in helping us launch our flagship Play+ solution. I’ve worked closely with Brian for the past 25 years, and his ability to design and implement payments solutions will be integral for cashless gaming’s growth at casinos across the United States. Sightline co-CEO Joe Pappano</p>
<p>Expanding beyond the United States, Sightline has rightly focused on Canada as the market holds the promise to be the biggest option for the company. The new executives, including Tenenbaum, are aware of the interest in and potential of Ontario, the province that regulated gambling in April but is already showing a strong promise.</p>
<p>Big Expectations for the Canadian Market</p>
<p>The province is dubbed as the most worthwhile iGaming market available in North America as of right now. Meanwhile, Tenenbaum is confident that Sightline will excel. She is also honored to be among the first to guide the company’s international program and expansion in Canada. Tenenbaum is upbeat about cashless gambling as well, which has slowly been making its way through Las Vegas and Atlantic City back in the United States.</p>
<p>Hill is a local who is a well-seasoned veteran having worked at the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation for 11 years. This makes him particularly well-positioned to read the local markets and advance the company’s cause forward. Not least, there is Cottengim who will be facilitating the company to bolster its strategic integration efforts with new and existing customers.</p>
