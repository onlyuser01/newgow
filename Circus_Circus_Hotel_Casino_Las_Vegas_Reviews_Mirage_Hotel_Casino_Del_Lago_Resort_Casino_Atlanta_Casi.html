    <h1>Circus Circus Hotel Casino Las Vegas Reviews Mirage Hotel Casino Del Lago Resort Casino Atlanta Casi</h1>

<p>Hello casino guru,</p>
<p>I created an account at X1 casino on Friday and before that I wanted to use the responsible gaming tools and set a deposit limit of 100 euros a month because I'm at risk of depositing more without a deposit limit and losing control. That's why I always use the Responsible Gaming tools. I then asked in the chat where I could find them. Which was also explained to me. I found this under my account and limits and wanted to set a deposit limit of 100 euros per month because, as already mentioned, I am at risk of gambling addiction. When I tried to set it up I was redirected to an error 404 page and it was not possible to create a deposit limit. The casino's responsible gaming policy clearly states that you can set deposit limits to play safely. See screenshots</p>
<p>I then asked in the chat and wanted a deposit limit set for me before I start playing because I'm at risk. The casino employee checked and then informed me that setting deposit limits is currently not possible and that he or the casino does not do this manually either. I then played with my deposited money and lost. But because I couldn't set a deposit limit and I'm at risk I kept depositing and ended up depositing and losing 4450 euros. I now have big financial problems because of this. I would like my deposited money of 4450 euros back from the casino and close my account there permanently because they have tools for responsible gaming in their terms and conditions but you cannot use them and no deposit limits are created on request in the live chat.</p>
<p>Please casino guru help me to get my deposited money of 4450 euros back. I am at risk and have been misled by the casino's Terms and Conditions and Responsible Gaming Policy. Please help me casino guru to get my money. This caused me major financial problems. ☹️</p>
