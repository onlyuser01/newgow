<p>Nathan Griffith was arrested on Wednesday and jailed for allegedly strangling a family member in Las Vegas. The 35-year-old former star of Teen Mom 2 is being held at the Clark County Detention Center for battery by strangulation. Bail was set at $5K, and he is due to appear at a court hearing at 1:30 p.m. Thursday.</p>

<p>According to TMZ, the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department received a call around 9:15 p.m. Wednesday from a home in which Griffith was staying. After conducting an investigation, the responding officers placed Griffith in handcuffs for allegedly committing the crime against an unidentified family member.</p>
<p>From 2013 to 2015, Griffith appeared with his girlfriend, Jenelle Evans, on the MTV reality series Teen Mom 2, their tumultuous relationship being a plot point. On the show, they called off their engagement amid cheating allegations.</p>
<p>Griffith, who has a 9-year-old son with Evans, was also arrested in February on the same charge — for choking girlfriend Victoria Ruggiero in Delray Beach, Fla. According to TMZ, that 911 call reported the former TV star “lost it,” choking Ruggiero and dragging her up a flight of stairs.</p>
<p>Griffith was also arrested in North Carolina in 2019 for driving under the influence.</p>
<p>In May 2022, Griffith revealed that he married May Oyola. The two reportedly reside in Miami.</p>
