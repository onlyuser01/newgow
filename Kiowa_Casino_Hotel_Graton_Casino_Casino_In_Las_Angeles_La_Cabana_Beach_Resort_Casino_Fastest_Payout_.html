<p>The 2021-22 NFL campaign is coming to an end this weekend. On Sunday, February 13, 2022, Super Bowl LVI will take place. The two teams competing for the Lombardi Trophy are the Los Angeles Rams and the Cincinnati Bengals.</p>
<p>Who’s going to win? The Rams will. At least that’s what betting odds suggest. With the odds of -198, the Los Angeles franchise is seen as the favorite. Still, no one should underestimate the Bengals, who have upset the odds on numerous occasions this season. The best example is the win over the Kansas City Chiefs in the AFC Championship game, in which Cincinnati was seen as a 7-point underdog.</p>

<p>Can Cincinnati Cause Another Mega Surprise?</p>
<p>Before the start of the 2021 NFL season, the odds on Cincinnati were as long as +17000. The reason is that the Bengals didn’t do too great a season prior. In fact, in 2020, they went 4-11-1.</p>
<p>They did make some signings in the offseason, but no superstars made Cincinnati their new home. For that reason, bookmakers thought they would do only slightly better than in 2020. However, the Bengals quickly proved everyone wrong.</p>
<p>Led by sophomore quarterback Joe Burrow, the Bengals offense was superb in the regular season, winning 10 games and losing seven. The record was enough for the Bengals to win the AFC North, leaving behind the Pittsburgh Steelers, Baltimore Ravens, and Cleveland Browns.</p>
<p>Then, in the playoffs, we saw the Bengals beat the Raiders in the Wild Card round. They entered the game as the favorites and won 26-19. In the Divisional Playoffs, they were seen as the underdogs. Cincinnati played against the Tennessee Titans, who were four-point favorites before the game.</p>
<p>The Bengals did great in the defense, stopping the Titans from scoring more than 16 points. The Bengals scored three more.</p>
<p>Still, their best outing this season was the one against the Chiefs in the AFC Championship game. The Bengals were expected to lose heavily, especially after Patrick Mahomes &amp; Co. scored three touchdowns in the first half, setting the score to 14-7. However, that’s when Cincinnati’s surge started, which ended in overtime with them winning 27-24.</p>
<p>The Rams are Favored for a Reason</p>
<p>If you take a look at the Rams’ roster, you’ll see that it’s packed with superstars. This goes for literally all areas of the game. In their defensive team, they have such giants as Aaron Donald, Jalen Ramsey, and Von Miller. In the offense, they have Cooper Kupp and Odell Beckham Jr. on receiving duties, while the man in charge of passing is their new quarterback, Matt Stafford.</p>
<p>For Stafford, this is his first-ever Super Bowl, which may seem surprising knowing that the guy’s been in the NFL for more than a decade. However, he used to play for the Detroit Lions where he was by far the best player. As a Ram, he now has plenty of elite teammates to count on, which has made his job way easier.</p>
<p>Picks: Los Angeles Rams to win and cover the spread; over to hit</p>
