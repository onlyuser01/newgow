<p>Legal sportsbooks in Tennessee reported strong results last month, hitting $405.3 million in sports betting handle, a new record for the state.</p>
<p>Tennessee Sportsbooks Collect Record Wagers in October</p>
<p>Details released by the gambling regulator in the state, the Tennessee Sports Wagering Advisory Council (SWAC), reveal that the total sports betting wagers in October hit $405,337,575. When compared to the $375.3 million reported in gross sports betting wagers from October last year, an increase of nearly 8% is observed.</p>
<p>But most importantly, the $405.3 million result from last month marked a new record sports betting handle for the state. Besides an increase on a year-over-year basis, the result from last month showed an increase when compared to September. Sports betting handle in September this year halted at $336.9 million, which means that in October, it increased by 20.3%.</p>
<p>Sports Betting Continues to Boost the State’s Coffers</p>
<p>SWAC’s latest data reveals that the payouts considering the $405.3 million handle were $368 million, while adjustments for the month amounted to $2.5 million. The $405.3 million in gross wagers translates to $34.8 million in adjusted gross income for the regulated sports wagering operators.</p>
<p>Given the 20% tax rate on sports betting revenue, the state collected $6,989,818 in taxes from the activity last month. This result completely surpassed the $3.4 million in taxes reported for the same period in October last year. However, the result from October this year marked the second-highest tax revenue from the activity, falling behind only by the record $8.7 million in taxes reported a month earlier, in September.</p>
<p>Legalized back in May 2019, Tennessee launched its legal sports betting market more than a year later, in November 2020. Currently, the state offers online sports betting with nearly a dozen operators offering their services. It’s no surprise that leading operators such as FanDuel, DraftKings, Caesars, BetMGM and WynnBet, to name a few, have secured access and offer their services in Tennessee.</p>
<p>Since the launch of the sports betting market in the state, so far, licensed operators have reported more than $6 billion in sports betting handle. To date, the activity brought to the state nearly $95 million in taxes. Currently, tax revenue in Tennessee helps the local government, education, as well as different gambling harm treatment programs.</p>
