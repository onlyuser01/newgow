    <h1>Casino North Carolina Casino In Cancun Captain Jack Casino Login Casino Baltimore Winstar Casino Tha</h1>

<p>Playson, a leading game developer and supplier, has signed a new content-oriented agreement with casino aggregator iGaming Group. Under the agreement, iGaming Group will integrate Playson games into its offering.</p>
<p>Playson to Provide iGaming Group with Content</p>
<p>As agreed, Playson will provide the aggregator with content. As a result, iGaming Group will bolster its portfolio with a lineup of games developed by Playson. The former company will, therefore, be able to engage MGA-licensed operators with fan-favorite titles such as Burning Fortunator, Joker’s Coins: Hold and Win and Solar Queen Megaways.</p>
<p>The agreement will help iGaming Group diversify its portfolio and provide a more attractive selection of games to its suite of partnering operators. The aggregator is known for its exciting portfolio of games, as well as its rich selection of solutions for gambling operators.</p>
<p>Playson, on the other hand, will be able to expand its presence in Europe. Many players in the Old Continent have grown to love the developer’s iconic gaming titles. Following the new deal with iGaming, even more gamers will have the opportunity to enjoy Playson’s hits.</p>
<p>iGaming Group Almost as Excited as It was for “the Welsh Attempt”</p>
<p>Phil Pearson, iGaming Group’s chief operating officer of IGG white labels and head of sales, commented on the new agreement. He jokingly said that his team is almost as excited for this partnership as it was for the Welsh attempt in the ongoing FIFA World Cup event. Pearson jestingly said that now that Wales has been defeated, iGaming Group can focus all of its excitement on Playson and its great slot games.</p>
<p>“Not to mention, we love acquiring the best promotions for players. It’s a win-win. Unlike Wales. Which was a Draw-Lose. As we suck.</p>
<p>Simona Lanzoni, Playson’s business development manager, also spoke on the deal. She said that her team is just as thrilled to join forces with iGaming Group and lauded the aggregator for its reputation for delivering top-tier casino experiences.</p>
<p>Lanzoni added that Playson cannot wait to provide iGaming Group with more games and help its partnering operators engage fans with the developer’s thrilling content.</p>
<p>“As we look to meet our enhanced growth plans, signing deals with established casino solutions providers that hold an extensive audience reach is critical. We can’t wait to start working with the group and hope we can announce more commercial deals further down the line.</p>
<p>iGaming Group is the latest company to adopt Playson’s games. A few days ago, the developer also penned an agreement with SkillOnNet, a leading gaming and entertainment brand.</p>
