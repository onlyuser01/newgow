    <h1>Golden Nugget Las Vegas Hotel Casino Blue Waters Casino Best Casino Online Real Money Crazy Time Cas</h1>

<p>Hello to you, I signed up for the joka club vip casino like any other online casino site on the net, I obviously did a research in advance to show that this casino was very well rated on the sites that advise them best casinos ... After a few days of intensive games, I won some nice wins so I had to confirm my identity, I sent them all the requested documents and my account was approved. I made 2 withdrawals that I received on my bank account, until the casino decided to close my account for this famous charge of returned deposits, from that moment the casino became very inconsistent in these answer. At first I spoke by phone to an agent who assured me that my account will be reopened in a few hours, then in the same day I received an email that my account will remain closed during the investigations , and the next day after sending them all proof that I did not make these deposit returns, I received an email saying my account will remain closed and the unpaid winnings without them giving me formal proof such as what am I who returned these deposits. I recall that I pocédé at this time earnings of 37,000 euros. Regarding whether joka club vip and joka room vip are the same owners, it is obviously not in my capacity to confirm this, because from the moment that I speak to the customer services of the 2 sites they both answer it as what they do not understand my question and it remains strange ... All the same as I told you, the interfaces are exactly the same, the games and the logos are also. Hope you could on your side check this and help me solve this problem to get my winnings back. Thank you Regards, Ilane</p>
