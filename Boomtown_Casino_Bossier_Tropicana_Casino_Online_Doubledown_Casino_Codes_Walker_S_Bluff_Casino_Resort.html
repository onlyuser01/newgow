<p>Greentube, NOVOMATIC’s digital gaming and entertainment division, announced today it expanded its presence in the regulated market in Belgium and the Netherlands via a new partnership with Gaming1’s B2C brand, Circus.</p>
<p>Circus and Greentube Ink Content Partnership</p>
<p>Thanks to the new content partnership, Greentube’s game portfolio is now live for Circus customers within the Belgian and Dutch regulated markets. Such content includes the highly-popular classic titles such as Random Runner, Club 2000 Casino and Grand Slam Casino. What’s more, Circus customers can also enjoy NOVOMATIC titles such as Book of Ra, Always Hot and Lucky Lady’s Charm and more popular games. The launch of the new content was facilitated via the integration of Greentube’s portfolio to Gaming1’s platform.</p>
<p>“Greentube offers the perfect balance of traditional and new titles, providing everything players could want in both the Netherlands and Belgium.” David Carrion, COO Interactive at Gaming1</p>
<p>Gaming1’s COO interactive, David Carrion, outlined that the company’s ultimate goal is offering an engaging, secure and innovative gaming experience for its users. He predicted that Greentube’s traditional and new titles will be well received in Belgium as well as the Netherlands. In conclusion, Carrion said that the new partnership marks the beginning of a collaboration that will bring many benefits.</p>
<p>It was back in March when Gaming1 entered the regulated online Dutch market. Back then, the company announced a joint venture partnership with Gran Casino, the prestigious land-based chain. After that, in May, Gaming1 strengthened its Belgian presence via a deal with Malta-based software provider Nolimit City.</p>
<p>Greentube Continues Its Global Expansion</p>
<p>Andy Duschek, Greentube’s sales and key account manager for the Netherlands, added that the company has seen an increase in the interest in its content within the Dutch market. According to him, this is why now Greentube is looking to grow further. Duschek pointed out that the new collaboration with Circus will expand the company’s presence in Belgium and the Netherlands.</p>
<p>“This deal with Circus, enhancing our presence in both the Netherlands and Belgium, gives us the chance to offer more players than ever before the chance to take part in a gaming experience that is honed to their localized preferences.“ Andy Duschek, sales and key account manager for the Netherlands at Greentube</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Greentube expanded its presence in North America by securing a license in Ontario. This achievement granted the company the possibility to offer its products within the regulated market in the most populous Canadian province. Just before that, late in July, Greentube strengthened its Belgian and Dutch presence via collaboration with Carousel.be and 711.nl. As a result, customers of the two websites gained access to the company’s leading content portfolio.</p>
