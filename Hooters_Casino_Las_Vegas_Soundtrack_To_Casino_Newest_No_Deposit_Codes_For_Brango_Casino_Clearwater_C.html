<p>Kelly Myers, GLI's Client Solutions Team Manager, commented in a statement released on October 24, 2022. She said: "Thorsten is well known in the Tribal regulatory community and has more than a decade of experience assisting and training regulators."</p>
<p>She acknowledged that Toms has significant experience with information technology. Myers pointed out that Toms has strong communication skills when it comes to presenting technical information to non-technical personnel. Finally, GLI's Client Solutions Team Manager said: "we are excited to have him join our diverse and talented team."</p>
<p>Kevin Mullally, GLI's Senior Vice President of Government Relations and General Counsel, added: "We are grateful to have Thorsten join the award-winning GLI Client Solutions team."
