<p>Itâ€™s time for the final race of the Formula 1 2023 season before the summer break. The Belgian Grand Prix will take place on Sunday, July 30, in the town of Spa, after which F1 will take a four-week break</p>
<p>Max Verstappen has won nine of this seasonâ€™s 11 Formula 1 races and is on a seven-win run right now. Obviously, itâ€™s no surprise heâ€™s seen as the No. 1 favorite to win the 2023 Belgian GP. But is there anyone who can stop him right before the summer break?</p>
<p>Weâ€™re not so sure about that, but we do think we might see a couple of surprises at Spa. This is a very fast race, so we suspect some unusual faces (with fast cars) might end up on the podium on Sunday,</p>

<p>Max Verstappen Going for the 10th Win of 2023</p>
<p>Max Verstappen is the best driver with the best car in 2023. Thatâ€™s why itâ€™s no surprise heâ€™s won 9 of the 11 races driven so far this season. In the other two events, he didnâ€™t win, but he did finish on the podium each time.</p>
<p>Heâ€™s coming off a win at the Hungaroring, which saw him start from the No. 2 position (behind Lewis Hamilton in the pole position). Even though Verstappen started the race from the second spot, he got in front of everyone on the first turn and had the lead until the very end.</p>
<p>We expect to see something similar from the Dutchman this weekend. That said, the big question ahead of the 2023 Belgian Grand Prix isnâ€™t whoâ€™s going to win the race, but which two drivers will get on the podium alongside Verstappen.</p>
<p>Lando Norris Looking for His Third Straight Podium Finish</p>
<p>We think thereâ€™s a chance another trophy gets broken this weekend. Last weekend, Norris broke Verstappenâ€™s Hungarian GP trophy by accident, while a week earlier he almost broke the British GP trophy. If he ends up on the podium again, we could see the same scenario play out again.</p>
<p>Trophies just arenâ€™t safe when Landoâ€™s on the podium! ðŸ˜„</p>

<p>But will he get to the podium in Belgium? The fact is that, right now, heâ€™s in the form of his life. Plus, heâ€™s driving a very fast car, which should do well at Spa. However, there are many other cards out there that are designed to excel in these types of races. One of those is the Williams-Mercedes car driven by Alexander Albon.</p>
<p>2023 Belgian GP Prediction</p>
<p>Max Verstappen is going to win this race; anything other than that would be a huge upset. However, when it comes to whoâ€™s gonna finish on the podium with him, itâ€™s much more difficult to predict. Lando Norris should be capable of getting there, while we also think Alexander Albon might upset the odds this Sunday.</p>
<p>Sure, it seems counterintuitive as heâ€™s without a single podium finish since joining the Williams Racing team, but we think he can pull it off.</p>
<p>Picks: Max Verstappen to win; Lando Norris/Alex Albon podium finish</p>
