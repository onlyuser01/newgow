<p>BETER Live is increasing the reach of one of its most recently launched divisions, the live casino content arm, which will now gain further exposure with operators and in markets thanks to an aggregation distribution agreement with REEVO.</p>
<p>BETER Live’s portfolio has been fast-expanding, featuring traditional and innovative live casino games, including Blackjack and Roulette, as well as its own signature Gravity Series, which feature innovative gameplay that defies traditional gaming algorithms.</p>
<p>The company argues that it seeks to deliver the best possible live casino experience across the board, building its library methodically. Meanwhile, REEVO will allow BETER Live to have a better pull with new audiences and operators through the integration solution that it offers.</p>
<p>Commenting on this opportunity, BETER LIVE Director Anna Vikmane said that the collaboration with REEVO was the start of a long and successful collaboration that will bear fruit in the months and years to come.</p>
<p>"Both companies share a mission to deliver the most entertaining content to players and our portfolio of live titles is proven to do just that," Vikmane explained. She felt confident that partner operators in the REEVO network will find BETER’s Blackjack, Roulette, and Baccarat games worthwhile, along with the unique Gravity Series.</p>
<p>REEVO Head of Sales Petra Maria Poola has similarly hailed BETER Live’s continuous efforts to build strong content and provide players with worthwhile experiences. Poola welcomed the addition of what she described as a supplier that will have a significant impact on REEVO’s own ambitions as the company is also pursuing rapid growth throughout the year.</p>
<p>REEVO has been actively adding to its content portfolio, signing up a series of partnerships with all sorts of suppliers. Among the companies that REEVO has recently teamed up with are such names as RubyPlay, AvatarUX, and Endorphina.</p>
<p>REEVO has been committed to adding dozens of operators this year, as the company is determined to establish its own reputation as a trusted and preferred gaming aggregator. On top of that, REEVO is also working on its own in-house games, building a solid library, and exploring all angles of the iGaming experience.</p>
<p>BETER has also been working on traditional casinos, sports betting, and esports betting products, among others.</p>
