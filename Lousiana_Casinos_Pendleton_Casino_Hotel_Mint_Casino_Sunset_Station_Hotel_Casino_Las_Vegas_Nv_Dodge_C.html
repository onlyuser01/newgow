<p>Information about Blackjack casinos</p>
<p>Blackjack is one of the most popular types of casino games in both brick-and-mortar and online casinos. If you want to try it out for fun, practice the basic strategy, or just enjoy the game without wagering real money, check out our collection of free Blackjack games.</p>

<p>Make sure to study Blackjack rules before playing</p>
<p>Blackjack is a relatively simple game, but it’s still good to learn more about it and study the rules before playing, even if only for fun. Blackjack is played with standard decks of French playing cards. The number of decks might be different in various version of the game, but one to eight decks are generally used.</p>
<p>Each card has a certain value:</p>
<p>Cards from 2 to 10 have their face value.</p>
<p>J, Q and K have a value of 10.</p>
<p>Ace has a value of 1 or 11.</p>
<p>The objective of each game round is to obtain a hand that’s higher in value than dealer’s hand, without exceeding the value of 21.</p>
<p>You do this by choosing whether to "hit" (get another card) or "stand". If your cards have a combined value of 22 or more, you "bust" and automatically lose. If you don’t bust, it’s the dealer’s turn. The dealer generally has to draw cards until getting a combined value of 17 or more (specific rules may vary), regardless of the player’s cards.</p>
<p>If the dealer busts, the player wins, unless they’ve previously busted, too. If neither of them busts, they compare the values of their hands to see who has won. You can either win double your stake, get your money back (in case of a "draw" or "push") or lose the wagered money if the dealer has a better combination.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if you hit a Blackjack (a combination of Ace and any card with a value of 10), you win 2.5-times you bet, unless the dealer has a Blackjack, too. If the latter happens, it’s a draw and you get the wagered money back.</p>
<p>Note: These were the general and simplified rules that should be sufficient if you want to play Blackjack just for free. However, it’s also wise to study more detailed Blackjack rules and read more about types of Blackjack, as each game can have slightly different rules. If you are a beginner, reading our "How to play Blackjack" article will be helpful, too.</p>
<p>Practice Blackjack basic strategy before playing for real money</p>
<p>Blackjack is one of the casino games that require some knowledge and practice to be played optimally. Free Blackjack games that you can play without wagering real money are a great tool to master the so-called basic strategy that will help you reach the game’s theoretical maximum RTP.</p>
<p>Depending on the rules of the exact version of Blackjack you play, the payout ratio you can reach might differ a bit, but you always need to know what to do in every situation to reach it. Learn more about the optimal way to play Blackjack in our article about basic strategy.</p>
<p>The basic strategy, however, is not about card counting or any other "trick" to beat the casino. It’s about making good decisions and minimizing the casino’s advantage over you. If this topic interests you, feel free to read more about it in our article about card counting in Blackjack, but you will not be able to utilize or practice it in games played for fun.</p>
<p>Note: Thanks to card counting, Blackjack is one of the few casino games in which players can actually be profitable. Of course, casinos don’t like this, so if they suspect a player is counting cards, they ask them to leave. There are also other measures implemented to make card counting more difficult or simply unusable. In online casinos, card counting can be used to some degree only in Blackjack with a live dealer. And because of frequently shuffled and exchanged decks of cards, it’s most likely not a profitable strategy anyways.</p>
<p>Learn about side bets in Blackjack</p>
<p>Many casinos and game providers add various side bets to Blackjack, which can make the game a bit more exciting, but generally also increase the casino’s advantage. You can take advantage of a side bet by placing a separate bet, which is settled independently from the "regular" Blackjack bet.</p>
<p>The most widely spread side bet is called "21+3", in which you can win a certain multiple of money placed on this bet, depending on your two cards and the dealer’s "upcard" (the visible card). The highest paying combination consists of three cards with the same rank and the same suit (e.g. three Queens of clubs).</p>
<p>The selection of side bets is much wider on brick-and-mortar and virtual Blackjack tables around the world, however, there is one thing all side bets have in common. They all have an RTP that’s worse than the RTP of Blackjack played without side bets. If you want to maximize your RTP, you should stay away from them, but they also increase the game’s volatility, what might be preferable for some players. One thing is certain – feel free to try them out when playing one of our free Blackjack games just for fun.</p>
<p>Free Blackjack for mobile devices</p>
<p>Not all online casino games are currently available in a version suitable for mobile devices, but many of them are. This applies to the Blackjack games in our database, too. If you are using a mobile device, you can apply our filter "Mobile Devices Supported" to see only Blackjack games you will be able to play. The selection is slightly smaller, but there are still plenty of games to choose from.</p>
<p>There is still a number of games that require Flash Player to be played, but it is decreasing, as many old games are being reworked using newer technologies supported by mobile devices.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Blackjack tables with a live dealer usually can't be played for free, but you will be able to play them for real money in many online casinos. Casinos with live roulette usually also offer live Blackjack games, but, to be absolutely sure, explore sites like liveblackjack.co which specialize in live Blackjack.</p>
