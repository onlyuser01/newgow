<p>REEVO continues to grow its aggregation platform with the introduction of more games from a prominent and innovative supplier</p>
<p>Onlyplay, the company that is now going to join REEVO’s powerful distribution and aggregation tool, brings many different game genres to the table, including slots, crash, and instant win titles that will be incorporated with the latter and distributed across the company’s wide network of partner operators.</p>
<p>REEVO Grows with Trailblazer Onlyplay</p>
<p>Onlyplay and REEVO will collaborate for future content as well, as the supplier will be rolling out its titles directly with REEVO and benefit from its reach. Onlyplay has been a forward-thinking studio with a particular focus on innovation and developing innovative games.</p>
<p>Some of its main games have been infinity play titles and crash games, which have been very well received by audiences, along with more traditional games, such as slots and instant win titles. Onlyplay has developed innovative mechanics as well as support for cryptocurrencies across the board.</p>
<p>REEVO has more than 70 partners presently and runs an aggregation solution of more than 8,000 games that spans all possible verticals of the iGaming experience. Onlyplay CEO Christina Muratkina has welcomed this opportunity to see her company strengthen its reach and presence in the iGaming industry by establishing itself with more operators across REEVO’s ample network.</p>
<p>“REEVO’s commitment to enhancing the online casino experience and Onlyplay’s focus on innovative game development align perfectly, promising to deliver unparalleled entertainment for players, setting new standards for the future of gaming,” Muratkina said.</p>
<p>REEVO head of sales Petra Maria Poola was of a similar mind, and excited to see the new company join the aggregation solution.</p>
<p>A Constant Expansion Journey in iGaming</p>
<p>According to Poola, despite its young age, Onlyplay was fully geared towards the next generation of players and the company brought products that are of true value to both partner operators and gamers.</p>
<p>REEVO has been fast-expanding by adding some of the world’s leading iGaming suppliers and developers. The company has achieved a significant milestone over the last several weeks with the addition of Red Tiger and Turbo Games to its aggregation library. Both companies are acclaimed developers that have produced some of the world’s best slot games.</p>
<p>The aggregation solution is not the only product line in which REEVO specializes, as the company also develops its own proprietary games that can also be found on the platform.</p>
