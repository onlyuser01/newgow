<p>GeoComply registered significant increases across all metrics relating to sports betting activity, highlighting the increasing number of states that allow online wagering. Super Bowl LVII was the first such event to occur in a State with legal sports betting, allowing many players to wager live directly from the stadium.</p>
<p>Sports Betting Is on the Rise across the USA</p>
<p>The geolocation service regularly releases such data following high-profile sports betting events, providing valuable insights into the state of the US sports betting industry. This year’s Super Bowl was highly anticipated among fans and sportsbooks alike, as the American Gaming Association (AGA) predicted that a record 50 million Americans would engage in wagering.</p>
<p>According to the most recent GeoComply data, AGA’s prediction appears to have been on point. The company conducted 100 million geolocation checks, a 25%increase compared to last year’s Super Bowl. New Yorkers showed the most interest in the event, accounting for 13.9 million GeoComply pings. 7.4 million accounts accessed the service over the weekend, breaking 2022’s number by 32%.</p>
<p>Such a rapid increase is not unexpected since more and more states are rapidly adopting online sports betting legislatures. Twenty-four states have already legalized online wagering, with more soon to follow. This year’s Super Bowl was notable because it was the first time a state allowing online sports betting hosted the event, highlighting the growing public interest.</p>
<p>Lots of Fans Wagered Directly from the Stadium</p>
<p>GeoComply data showed that over 8,000 fan sportsbook accounts were responsible for more than 100,000 geolocation checks in and around Glendale, Arizona’s State Farm Stadium. Such numbers indicate that many visitors chose to engage with their preferred sportsbook while watching the Super Bowl from their seats in the stadium.</p>
<p>The geolocation service released several convenient pin-drop maps of sports betting activity across several states and around State Farm Stadium, recording the sudden surge during the Super Bowl. GeoComply co-founder &amp; CEO Anna Sainsbury confirmed that the event was record-breaking across several metrics and highlighted the fans’ newfound ability to bet while watching the game in person.</p>
<p>GeoComply data reveals that Americans’ interest in legally betting on the Super Bowl has never been higher. Anna Sainsbury, GeoComply co-founder &amp; CEO</p>
<p>GeoComply’s data does not reflect all sports betting activity but still provides consistent and valuable insights into the state of the industry. The company partners with operators like DraftKings, BetMGM, FanDuel, and Caesars to prevent fraud and ensure compliance with local regulations. Thanks to recent minority investments, GeoComply intends to branch out into broader technology markets without compromising its excellent reliability and credibility.</p>
