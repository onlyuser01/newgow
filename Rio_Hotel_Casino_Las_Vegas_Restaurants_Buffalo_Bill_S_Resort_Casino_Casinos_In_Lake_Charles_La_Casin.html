<p>The online betting firm PointsBet launched online, mobile, and sports betting in Illinois. The operator will also offer exclusive prices for games of the Chicago Bears NFL team.</p>
<p>The Online Gambling Operator Expands Its U.S. Presence by Entering Illinois</p>
<p>Saturday, September 12, PointsBet announced its entry on the Illinois sports betting market. The gambling operator launched online, mobile and retail sports betting for fans in the Prairie State. The operator announced its plan to launch multiple retail sportsbooks, many of which will be in the Chicagoland area. One of those sportsbooks will be at the iconic Hawthorne Race Course. But sports bets fans that want to bet at this retail will need to first sign up in person in order to place bets online.</p>
<p>Off-track betting venues by PointsBet are also going to be established in more Chicagoland area sites such as Prospect Heights, Crestwood, and Oakbrook Terrace. PointsBet will offer exclusive market prices for Chicago Bears NFL team games in Illinois. Furthermore, the company said it will run the famous “Crowd Booster” for some of the Chicago Bears games.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly the betting firm is expanding its presence on the U.S. market. Recently, the company signed multiple key partnerships. Last week, the operator struck a fist of its kind agreement with the University of Colorado and the Colorado Bullafoes.</p>
<p>Back in August, PointsBet signed a multi-year partnership with the Kroenke Sports &amp; Entertainment (KSE). The KSE represents several sports franchises. Under the deal, the Denver Nuggets, Colorado Rapids, and Colorado Mammoth have added PointsBet as an official sports betting partner.</p>
<p>PointsBet Committed to Innovation</p>
<p>Commenting on PointsBet’s entry on the Illinois market, PointsBet USA chief executive Johnny Aitken said: “PointsBet possesses competitive advantages by owning our technology environment from end to end, such as unrivaled speed and ease of use on a personalized platform.” He outlined that with a partner like Hawthorne Race Course, the company is thrilled to provide the fans in Illions “with exactly what they’ve been craving”.</p>
<p>The iconic Hawthorne track was founded in 1891. This is Illinois’ oldest legal gambling venue. Moreover, Hawthorne Race Course is North America’s oldest family-owned racetrack. Only recently, back in July, the racetrack received approval to go ahead with a massive $400 million redevelopment. Once completed, the racetrack will feature table games, slots, as well as dining venues, and more.</p>
<p>And here is what Tim Carey, Hawthorne president, and chief executive said: “There are a lot of good reasons why we chose to partner with PointsBet, but most importantly it’s their commitment to innovation and customer excitement”. He added that gamblers in Illinois will quickly come to like the supreme sports betting experience which PointsBet provides.</p>
