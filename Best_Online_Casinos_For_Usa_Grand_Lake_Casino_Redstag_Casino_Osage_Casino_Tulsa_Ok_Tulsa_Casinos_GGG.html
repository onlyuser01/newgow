<p>Promoters for the two boxers announced the rematch will go down on May 5, Cinco de Mayo, at a site to be determined. HBO will telecast the contest via pay per view at 8 pm ET.</p>
<p>“I am ready to battle Canelo again and am happy he took this fight again,” GGG said. “This is the fight the world wants. This is the fight boxing deserves. I didn’t agree with some of the judges’ decisions in the first fight.”</p>
<p>Never short on confidence, Golovkin added his fight prediction, “This time there will be no doubt. I am leaving the ring as the middleweight champion of the world.”</p>
<p>Oddsmakers in Las Vegas agree GGG will prevail. The Westgate SuperBook opened the fight with Golovkin the favorite at -180, and Alvarez the underdog at +150. The line implies odds of a GGG victory at 64.3 percent, and Alvarez 40 percent.</p>
<p>Picking a Winner</p>
<p>Last September, GGG and Alvarez squared off inside the sold-out T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas. The fight came just three weeks after the Conor McGregor and Floyd Mayweather spectacle took place at the very same venue.</p>
<p>Boxing purists labeled the Golovkin-Alvarez fight a more respectable event. But the judges’ decisions left the entire boxing community upset. The marquee fight entertained the 22,358 in attendance for 12 rounds, but then the three-judge panel took center stage.</p>
<p>While one judge had GGG winning 115-133, and another had it tied 114-114, judge Adalaide Byrd scored the fight 118-110 in Alvarez’s favor. Her controversial scorecard resulted in the fight being declared a draw.</p>
<p>Nevada State Athletic Commission Executive Director Bob Bennett said following the event, “In any business sometimes you have a bad day. She saw the fight differently. It happens.” ESPN boxing journalist Dan Rafael opined, “I can deal with 114-114 even though I strongly felt Golovkin won. But Bryn’s card? Indefensible.”</p>
<p>Byrd was subsequently sidelined for the rest of 2017. The draw resulted in Las Vegas oddsmakers returning millions of dollars in betting slips. The fight generated over $27 million in gate, the third-biggest in the sport’s history.</p>
<p>As for a rematch, Alvarez didn’t downplay the significance. “I’m delighted to once again participate in one of the most important boxing events in history,” the underdog declared.</p>
<p>Tale of the Tape</p>
<p>GGG, 35, is the unified middleweight world champion. In his 38-fight career, he’s won 37 times, with 33 by knockout. He’s never lost, and his lone draw came last fall.</p>
<p>Alvarez, 27, is a three-time world champ in two weight classes including middleweight. He’s completed 52 professional fights, and won 49 (34 by knockout). His lone loss came in 2013 against Mayweather in a 12-round duel that resulted in a majority decision in Floyd’s favor.</p>
