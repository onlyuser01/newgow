<p>BetMGM and SportsGrid have teamed up to allow the top sports betting and iGaming operator to integrate its content into SportsGrid’s original 24-hour live programming. This marriage is another example of the continued merger of sports and sports betting in the US. Several similar deals have already been made, and they will all drive similar links between other operators and media producers in the future.</p>
<p>BetMGM Adds New Ground</p>
<p>SportsGrid will incorporate BetMGM’s brand and odds, as well as promotions, into its most popular shows. SportsGrid will also have access to BetMGM’s trading team, brand ambassadors, including former NFL running back Chris Johnson, and other resources to help create exclusive content for the network.</p>
<p>Adam Greenblatt, BetMGM’s CEO, stated, “SportsGrid is making big waves in the streaming world, creating a new avenue for fans to consume sports betting content. This collaboration allows us to further expand BetMGM’s reach to our fans through SportsGrid’s nationwide broadcast network.”</p>
<p>SportsGrid has signed a long-term lease agreement with Somerset Development at Bell Works in Holmdel, New Jersey, right down the road from BetMGM’s headquarters. This will allow SportsGrid to bring its live sports betting programming to the SG Studios &amp; Production hub, which is located within the Bell Works office community.</p>
<p>SportsGrid Becomes More Competitive</p>
<p>SportsGrid will be able to provide real-time data, as well as insights, to millions across multiple sports. This strategic partnership is mutually beneficial and will increase the reach of the operator’s national broadcast network. It will also provide more insight for the gaming community about what they care about most.</p>
<p>SportsGrid will use the collaboration to strengthen its brand in this industry and establish its position as a leading gaming and sports network. SportsGrid’s multimedia destinations are SportsGrid Streaming Video Network, SportsGrid Radio, SportsGrid.com, DailyRoto and SportsGrid Studios.</p>
<p>The new partnership follows several made over the past year. DraftKings purchased VSiN in March of last year before signing a content distribution deal with Meadowlark Media the following month. Even ESPN is in on the game, working on a deal with DraftKings and Caesars Entertainment.</p>
<p>FanDuel has been involved in its own deals, as well. It has exclusive sports betting partnerships with different media and content production companies, including Turner Sports, Bleacher Report, The Ringer, and more. It also has several high-profile brand ambassadors, among whom are Pat McAfee, Cousin Sal, World Wide Wob, and Charles Barkley.</p>
