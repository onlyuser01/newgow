    <h1>Best Casino In San Diego Riverfront Casino Pittsburgh Saratoga Hotel And Casino W Casino Northern Qu</h1>

<p>I should have known from the beginning when I tried to deposit multiple times with different cards and it kept not going through and they wanted Bitcoin only that was the first thing second thing is when I did deposit they gave me a bad ass bonus right times 400 so I started out with a lot and then I find out I get up till like 600 and then I go down to 450 and try to cash out well they say I need to be approved by verification I send them a letter like six working days later they're like oh you didn't do this part you're not approved yet so I send it get approved have to wait I waited a total of 24 working days like I started my cash out on May 4th and I just got it yesterday and on top of it I didn't even get the 450 doesn't say anything about only times 10 and they take your bonus out of your winnings so I deposited 25 times 10 is 250 cool my bonus was $150 and it's 100 minimum to cash out so I barely got anything they didn't tell me I wasn't going to get anything I waited 24 working days I could not get them on the phone I could not get them through email I sent over 100 plus emails I have had the worst experience and on top of it it's my birthday today so I don't understand what is wrong with these people they didn't even tell me that I couldn't even cash out the $450 like I totally would have reversed it kept it on my game and just taken out the 250 right so I would have some stuff to play with no they don't tell you and then they reversed it and only took out $150 but they don't tell you anything customer service is no help</p>
