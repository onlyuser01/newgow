    <h1>Cincinnati Casino Turtle Lake Hotel Casino Lucky Red Casino No Deposit Bonus Edgewater Casino In Lau</h1>

<p>I have been playing at Izzy Casino since 2021, the account is naturally verified, there was a huge pile of deposits, there were earlier payments. Last night (Saturday, MAY 6!): snatched a promo from MaksOne streamer for 1000 rubles. (I managed to activate in the chat) I won back the wager, the balance was 23 thousand something, after laundering, it fell to real 10.000r (Max cashout x10 of the bonus amount) I put 8000r on payout. and for 2000 continued to play. Managed to win some more money. Also put in a conclusion. then the payment of 8000r was canceled, contacted support for the first time: They said everything was fine with the payment! Expect 2 to 4 hours. Then I told them that they had just canceled the payment of 8000r. they looked and asked to make a minimum deposit and its turnover x3 (Well, I understood this because there was no activity on the account for a long time) There was no money on the wallet for a deposit (I use only piastrix) Then I continue to play and managed to win 50 thousand. rub. (In the amount of 49900 rubles with a penny) This morning (May 7th Sunday) I replenished the balance by 500 rubles. and do it three times.</p>
<p>I bet again on the withdrawal, different amounts and cancel again. I write to technical support for which they ask me to make a deposit of 50k and make its turnover x3. RECALLING clause 10.6 of the rules on laundering the bonus, etc. BUT IT IS CLEARLY WRITTEN IN THE RULES: "IF THE DATA IS NOT FILLED THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO WRITE OFF THE BONUS" + "... IF THERE IS A SUSPECT OF FRAUD, THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO REQUEST A DEP EQUAL TO THE AMOUNT OF THE BONUS WIN OFF, AND ITS TURNOVER x3" Naturally, everything is filled in and confirmed (account verified two years ago)</p>
<p>It is not clear what fraudulent actions on my part we are talking about. For my part, I say that I did not violate any rules and fraudulent actions. And also according to their rules: "Dep + Turnover of the WIN BONUS": That is, as I understand it, the wagered bonus is 10 thousand (I have already won the rest from this WIN BONUS) That is, they can request a maximum of 10k dep and its turnover x3. WHERE IS THIS 50K NUMBERS FROM? And why then it was necessary to demand min.dep? No messages are sent to the mail about the cancellation of payments, no clarifications from the security service are received. (they donâ€™t say the reason for the cancellation of the payment. STUPIDLY REQUEST 50 thousand rubles a deposit !!!</p>
<p>Previously, in similar casinos, in the Royal Partners network, it was also possible to win back such bonuses from streamers, and withdraw them without problems, without any additional verifications and deposits. PLEASE HELP WITH PAYMENT AND DEAL WITH THE SITUATION!!!</p>
<p>FROM THE CASINO PLEASE GIVE PROOF WHAT VIOLATIONS AND FRAUD ACTIVITIES ARE WE TALKING ABOUT? I JUST HAVE BEEN PLAYING AT A CASINO FOR YEARS AND THERE ARE NO SUCH "DURING RULES" IN ANY NORMAL INSTITUTION. I won back the bonus, so give me mine (Max cashout 10 thousand AT ALL) Where can I get ten or even fifty thousand for a deposit?! (I do not agree with this rule) !!! If I had such means, would I play for a bonus 1000r at all?!!</p>
