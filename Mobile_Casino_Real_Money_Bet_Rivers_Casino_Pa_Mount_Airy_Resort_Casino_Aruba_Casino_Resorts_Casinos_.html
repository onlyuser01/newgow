<p>Gaming Innovation Group (GiG) continues to adjust course at the helm of its operations with Jonas Warrer now stepping in as acting group CEO. Warrer stepped in the position late last week with immediate effect and he replaced Richard Brown, who had taken his leave several days prior.</p>
<p>Both moves were rather surprising to observers, but a logical shift at the top of one of the world’s biggest gaming companies, which has shown resilience and determination to continue business as usual. Warner is currently CEO at GiG Media and will now be tasked with both running the division as well as the group’s operations.</p>
<p>Warrer’s situation will remain unchanged until the business splits into two and he can return to focusing solely on GiG’s Media, at least based on the company’s current plans. As to Brown, he will still support the company in an advisory position through December 31, 2023. GiG’s other division, Platform &amp; Sportsbook is in good hands with Richard Carter appointed in August as its CEO.</p>
<p>This shift in leadership has not caused the company any turbulence at all. Warrer is a well-seasoned industry veteran and an individual who is intimately familiar with the operations at GiG. He joined the company in 2017 as part of the Rebel Penguin Aps acquisition, a company he founded and managed right up to the acquisition.</p>
<p>He has been involved with the development of GiG Media and his role there has been appreciated, promoting him to the very helm of the division. Commenting on the most recent events, GiG Executive Chairman Petter Nylander hailed the opportunity to see such a seamless transition at the top with Warrer stepping in at the helm of GiG.</p>
<p>"He has long experience within GiG and the industry and has been part of GiG's executive management for 4 years," added Nylander, appreciative of Warrer’s agreement to help the company tide over the strategic review.</p>
<p>The strategic review should end up with GiG splitting its operations into GiG Media and GiG Platform &amp; Sportsbook – two entities which will pursue business growth and opportunity on their own.</p>
