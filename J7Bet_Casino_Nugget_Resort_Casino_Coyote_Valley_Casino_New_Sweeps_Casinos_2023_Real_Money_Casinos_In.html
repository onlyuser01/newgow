<p>Triple Diamond Review</p>
<p>Triple Diamond is a classic slot coming from the rich portfolio by one of the most popular casino games providers in the world, IGT. The slot can be considered as a sequel of the Double Diamond slot by this provider, which is especially popular across land based casinos powered by IGT.</p>
<p>The slot has a simple design and lacks a classic set of bonus features like we are used to seeing on modern video slot games. Still with a maximum payout potential of 1,119 times the total stake and a rich paytable Triple Diamond is well worth playing if you enjoy playing classic slots and aim to win big.</p>
<p>Theme and Visual Details</p>
<p>As you can already guess from the slot name, Triple Diamond is inspired by diamonds. A lot of older classic slots use this theme which brings a sense of wealth and big payouts to the reels.</p>
<p>As expected the visual details in the slot are on a low level, while there are hardly any modern animations on the reels. Still this is a classic slot and the designers paid more attention to the payout potential of the game, rather than focusing on the visual appearance.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Triple Diamond has a simple design with 3 reels and 3 rows. The designers installed 9 paylines in the game, leaving the player with more chances to win than on most classic slots where the number of paylines usually varies from 1 to 5.</p>
<p>Triple Diamond offers more paylines than its predecessor, Double Diamond slot</p>
<p>The paytable in Triple Diamond consists of Single, Double and Triple Bars symbols, along with the Sevens symbol and the Wild.</p>
<p>The biggest excitement and payouts in the slot can land with a little help from the Wild symbol. When one Wild substitutes another symbol in a winning combination the overall payout is multiplied by 3. When two Wilds substitute in a win the payout comes with a high 9x multiplier. This way the payouts from the regular game symbols are much higher, thanks to the attached Wild multipliers.</p>

<p>Bet size and payouts</p>
<p>The bet size in Triple Diamond can vary from one casino to another. Depending on the casino the stake can go from $0.09 up to a whopping $900 per spin. It is easily adjusted by setting the Line bet anywhere from 0.01 to 100. The Auto Play function offers up to 50 Auto Spins.</p>
<p>Winning combinations in the game are formed by landing 3 matching symbols on a payline. The biggest payout in the slot comes from landing 3 Wilds on a winning payline. After that comes the Sevens symbol, followed by the Single, Double and Triple Bars symbols.</p>
<p>But what can keep your balance from dropping too fast are the few lower payouts in the game. Any one Wild on the reels will award a 2 times the total stake payout, any two Wilds will award a 10 times the total stake payout, while any Bars combination will pay 5 times the total stake.</p>
<p>The RTP value in Triple Diamonds is set at 95.06%. Compared to modern video slots this is a below average value, but compared to most classic slots the RTP is a bit higher. The slot has a low to medium volatility, so you can expect frequent wins to keep your balance from sinking too fast.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Triple Diamond is sure to catch the attention of all players who enjoy spinning the reels of classic slots.</p>
<p>The paytable in the game is strong and the payout potential is enhanced by the multipliers attached to the Wild symbols. This way the top payouts in the slot can be multiplied by 9, so landing a 3 of a kind win with two Wilds and a Seven will result in a payout of 900 times the total stake.</p>
<p>With a top payout of 1,119 times the total stake and an RTP value of 95.06% Triple Diamond is a slot well worth playing.</p>
