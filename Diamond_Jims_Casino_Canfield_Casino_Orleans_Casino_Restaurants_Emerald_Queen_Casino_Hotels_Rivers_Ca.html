<p>Cash Bandits 2 Slot Review</p>
<p>Cash Bandits 2 is the second installment in Realtime Gaming’s popular cops and robbers series that hardly needs any type of introduction. The top bank heist-themed games inspired by Hollywood’s explosive scenarios have attracted millions of fans from all parts of the world starting with the first title released in 2015 followed by the sequel launched two years later.</p>
<p>This slot review is going to address the most recent game in the series. If you wish to learn all about the quick and smooth gameplay, excellent theme, paytable, overall aesthetics, and top-tier mini-game feature that make this game so spectacular, keep reading. Our experts have compiled a detailed and comprehensive Cash Bandits 2 slot review ready to be explored. Without further ado, let’s get started.</p>
<p>Theme, Storyline, and Graphics: Start Picking Up Safes to Collect Your Wins</p>
<p>The second game in the series introduces players to a fresh tale with a focus on a nameless pro burglar who specializes in cracking safes open. Similar to the first game, the sequel also includes an engaging lock-picking mini-game that asks players to prove their safe cracking skills by picking up the right codes for five different safes packed with win multipliers and free spins awards.</p>
<p>The comic visual elements continue to look quirky while the cinematic spins revolve around crooks and cops, with a bank’s pillars serving, once again, as the backdrop. The bags stashed with money, the handcuffs, the badges belonging to the police, and the Wanted posters are all game symbols that nicely complement the theme and help build the captivating storyline.</p>
<p>The high attention to detail that the RTG team has once again paid is undoubtedly visible throughout the intricate design. Players who are ready to do their best to bust open the bank will leave home with plenty of juicy loot. A mere look at the fluttering banknotes dispersed around the frame and the alarm bell ready to ring out all nicely complement the sight of a heist.</p>
<p>Cash Bandits 2: Game Symbols and Payouts</p>
<p>The game’s highest-paying symbol is represented by the angry policeman dressed in a standard blue uniform. Players who come across five cop symbols at a time scoop up 2,000 coins. The bank teller with an alarmed look on her face can reward players with a maximum payout of 1,500 coins for five-of-a-kind. Even the bank has a symbol of its own on the paytable, paying 1,000 coins for five identical symbols.</p>
<p>The safe key and the police badge are the mid-paying symbols that bring players 600 coins for five matching symbols. The burglar alarm, the Wanted poster, and the stack of cash pay 250 coins when landing five symbols. The low-paying symbols are represented by the bags of money, handcuffs, and coffee cup and doughnut combos that pay 100 for five-of-a-kind. There are no classic playing cards as low-paying symbols, which means all symbols are perfectly aligned with the theme.</p>
<p>The game also counts a wild symbol marked through the Cash Bandit 2 icon which pays 5,000 coins for coming across five symbols at a time, as well as a scatter symbol in the form of the bank robber. The latter pays 50 coins for five matching symbols.</p>
<p>Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The soundtrack is based on upbeat trumpet music that is usually heard while watching cartoons. The visual effects are excellent during the base game and they are even better while entering the bonus feature. All five safes that are initially hidden in the shadow start to reveal to players with the help of a torch seen shining on them as players enter the combinations.</p>
<p>Cash Bandits 2 Gameplay</p>
<p>The playing field with 15 symbols on the 5X3 grid lets players freely test out a few combinations of lines and betting range values until they find the best ones for them. Once the game is launched, the standard settings of the bet value are set at $1,00. All 25 available pay lines are engaged and players can easily set the desired line number to a value ranging between 1 and 25. Also, the bet size can go from $0,25 to $25, allowing players to enjoy the flexibility they need for a chance to crack open the five safes.</p>
<p>It is also possible to use Autoplay mode or alter the speed of the game for faster-paced action on the reels. The paytable and the game rules are detailed in the dedicated Help &amp; Rules section which can be accessed by clicking or tapping the right-hand bank pillar.</p>
<p>Cash Bandits 2: Vault Feature &amp; Jackpots</p>
<p>Vault Feature</p>
<p>As soon as the wild symbol is seen landing on a random reel, it will act as a substitute for the rest of the symbols, except for the robber symbol which is the scatter. Matching three scatters will automatically engage the lock-picking mini-game feature. By default, the feature gives players five free spins. However, successfully unlocking a safe will trigger up to 190 free spins along with a multiplier that can go as high as 17x. To open a safe, players must use a random code made of one, two, three, four, or five digits. Players can select five, six, or eight numbers from a keypad counting 10 digits when three to five scatters are triggered. Provided one of the chosen numbers is seen in any of the codes, it will proceed to replace the corresponding placeholders on the vault’s code screens. Players who manage to complete a five-digit combination on the vault are granted 100 free games.</p>
<p>The Vault Feature can be retriggered. Every time this happens, five new free games are added to the current feature while the multiplier is maintained in its position. The free games are played at the bet and lines used during the triggering game.</p>
<p>Progressive Jackpots</p>
<p>Players can trigger the Minor or Major jackpot or both at any given moment during the base game. The wins from the progressive jackpots are automatically added to the rest of the wins. The contribution of the random jackpot is 1.04% of the total Return to Player rate of the game.</p>
<p>Final Thoughts</p>
<p>RTG’s Cash Bandits 2 is an effervescent slot from the guys at RTG that gives players the chance to scoop up some serious cash after busting some bank faults and experiencing the Vault Feature with loads of free spins and mesmerizing multipliers and the progressive jackpot.</p>
<p>Without a doubt, the game is another hit slot from the provider that continues to attract a large number of players even today.</p>
