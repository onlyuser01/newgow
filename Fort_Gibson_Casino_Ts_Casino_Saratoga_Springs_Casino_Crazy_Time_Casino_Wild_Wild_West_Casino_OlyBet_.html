    <h1>Fort Gibson Casino Ts Casino Saratoga Springs Casino Crazy Time Casino Wild Wild West Casino OlyBet</h1>

<p>Ezugi, an Evolution Group-owned live casino provider, has expanded its footprint in Europe through a new deal. The supplier will work together with OlyBet, a Baltic-oriented sports betting and casino operator.</p>
<p>OlyBet Adds Ezugi Content</p>
<p>As per the deal, Ezugi will power OlyBet with its proprietary live casino content. This will include some of the provider’s most popular offerings, such as 32 Cards, Andar Bahar, baccarat, Casino Hold’em, Lucky 7 and sic bo.</p>
<p>The premium casino content will be streamed live in six languages from Ezugi’s nine studios. Thanks to the deal, Ezugi will be able to expand its presence in Europe. With OlyBet focused on Baltic jurisdictions, Ezugi will promote its content in Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania.</p>
<p>Despite operating worldwide, Ezugi has remained focused on the European market. A few weeks ago, the supplier doubled down on its presence in Italy thanks to a partnership with the Italian lottery powerhouse Sisal. Earlier this year, the live casino provider successfully acquired a license from the United Kingdom’s Gambling Commission, which allowed it to launch its content in the country.</p>
<p>A Great Opportunity for Both Companies</p>
<p>Pang Goh, the business development director of Ezugi, commented on the deal with OlyBet. He said that his team is excited to join forces with the Baltic company and reap the benefits that the partnership will bring.</p>
<p>“Not only will this agreement bring new and exciting experiences to the players in the Baltics and the EU, but it also strengthens our own position in these countries.</p>
<p>Goh is sure that OlyBet’s players are going to love the “outstanding live gaming experience” that Ezugi provides. He added that the new features Ezugi recently added are going to improve the gaming experience even more.</p>
<p>Tomas Graham, chief performance officer of OlyBet, also spoke on the matter. He is convinced that the collaborative work with Ezugi will keep the operator’s fanbase engaged with new games. Thanks to this, the company will be able to secure its position as the best multi-channel operator in the Baltics.</p>
<p>OlyBet is based in Estonia but also targets Latvia and Lithuania. It primarily focuses on sports betting but also provides an increasing number of casino and iGaming products. About two weeks ago, the Baltic operator reinforced its portfolio with more titles, following an agreement with Playson, another betting operator. Earlier, the operator added even more slots to its platform thanks to a deal with Swintt.</p>
