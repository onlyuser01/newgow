<p>The North American Poker Tour (NAPT) is reemerging in Las Vegas this November, and PokerStars has revealed a series of chances for poker enthusiasts to secure an all-expenses-paid trip to the poker party. It’s been over a decade since the NAPT was held, but the changes in gambling legislation across the U.S. are paying off.</p>

<p>Thanks to the still-controversial decision by the federal government to block online poker in 2011, the NAPT came to a grinding halt after just two years. With Pennsylvania, Michigan, and other states now legalizing online poker within their jurisdictions, the game is quickly making up for lost time and reversing what became known as Poker Black Friday 12 years ago.</p>
<p>The NAPT will be held from November 4-12, just ahead of the Las Vegas Grand Prix on November 19. Poker players from beginners to pros have a shot at winning a seat in the NAPT Las Vegas High Roller event through the ongoing PokerStars promos.</p>
<p>Events For All Players</p>
<p>Resorts World Las Vegas will host the NAPT, which features nonstop action daily with 32 events in total. Buy-ins start at $250, and among the likely top candidates for players are:</p>
<p>Event Date Buy-In NAPT Main Event November 6–11 $1,650 NAPT NLH Super High Roller November 5-6 $10,300 NAPT NLH Cup November 9-12 $550 NAPT NLH High Roller November 10-12 $5,300 NAPT NLH Mystery Bounty November 11-12 $1,100</p>
<p>To give the NAPT a boost, PokerStars is offering a number of special “Vegas Gold Passes” ahead of the event. These packages are worth $20K, and players in Italy, Spain, France, and in legal U.S. online gaming markets have a chance to pick one up.</p>
<p>The package includes a spot in the Las Vegas High Roller, a $5,300 buy-in event. It also includes a three-day pass for two to attend the Oracle Red Bull Racing Fan Experience on November 16-18. That event will showcase Red Bull’s Formula 1 team, of which PokerStars is a partner.</p>
<p>There’s also a 10-day hotel stay for two, as well as $3,653 to help cover flights and expenses. The hotel package is good for November 9-19.</p>
<p>Going for the Gold</p>
<p>PokerStars players who use the “.com” site and those in Italy can enter the platform’s Power Path program for a chance at winning a Gold Pass. It’s free to enter and awards a step ticket to players who participate in real money games. Accumulating tickets can lead the player to win a Gold Pass, which can be used as an entry for an all-expense paid trip, or to play an online tournament.</p>
<p>Starting this Monday and running through October 26, PokerStars is taking the Gold Pass scheme to a new level. There will be 10 Vegas Gold Passes that include the NAPT package available for .com players, and two for Italy players.</p>
<p>Players in Spain got a head start. PokerStars rolled out its Vegas Gold Pass Grind in the country on September 25, and will keep it going until October 25. It offers three Vegas Gold Passes through a “Rake Race,” which will see the top three finalists with the highest rake at the end of the contest each win one of the packages.</p>
<p>France, Ontario, and legal online poker markets in the U.S. will join Spain in offering Vegas Gold Passes through different freeroll tournaments. All players who win any of the Vegas Gold Passes available must be at least 18 years old to collect the packages and play in Las Vegas.</p>
