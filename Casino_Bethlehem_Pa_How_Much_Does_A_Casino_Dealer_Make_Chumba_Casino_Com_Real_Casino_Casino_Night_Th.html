<p>Casino, sports betting, and fantasy sports operator FanDuel announced that two of its key members received new appointments due to their continued contributions to the company. Christian Genetski will become FanDuel Group’s new President, while Mike Raffensperger will assume the newly created role of Chief Commercial Officer.</p>
<p>Both new executives have extensive experience working for the brand and have contributed to its rapid growth. Genetski and Raffensperger will report directly to Amy Howe, FanDuel’s Chief Executive Officer.</p>
<p>Christian Genetski Worked Closely with Regulators</p>
<p>Genetski previously served as the company’s chief legal officer. His work focused on working with regulators and government bodies across the USA to overcome legal challenges. He is one of the people responsible for the legalization and regulation of daily fantasy sports (DFS) across more than 20 US states.</p>
<p>Genetski also spearheaded FanDuel’s initial North American entry into the sports betting and iGaming markets, and his efforts helped sports betting become legal in 15 states. He helped negotiate the operator’s high-profile partnerships with professional sports franchises and major leagues like the NFL, NBA, PGA TOUR, and NHL.</p>
<p>In his new position, the FanDuel Group President will be in charge of the company’s government affairs, corporate strategy, and business development. Genetski will also oversee the company’s strategic partnerships and spearhead promising business initiatives to stimulate future growth.</p>
<p>Mike Raffensperger Was Key to FanDuel’s Marketing</p>
<p>Raffensperger previously worked with FanDuel as Chief Marketing Officer. He was a fundamental figure in fueling FanDuel’s current leading market position. Raffensperger also headed the company’s responsible gambling initiatives and was instrumental in attracting Craig Carton as the operator’s first Responsible Gaming Ambassador.</p>
<p>Raffensperger’s newly created position of Chief Commercial Officer involves direct oversight over the operator’s revenue generation. He is taking over some of CEO Amy Howe’s commercial leadership duties and will supervise the company’s casino, sportsbook, daily fantasy, and free-to-play divisions. Raffensperger will also oversee the operator’s TVG cable network and the rest of its content and programming assets. His end goal will be to manage FanDuel’s marketing efforts and promote cohesion between the different units.</p>
<p>The Promotions Will Aid FanDuel’s Future Growth</p>
<p>CEO Howe holds both men in high regard. She commented that they had been instrumental in making FanDuel a sports betting and iGaming industry leader. Howe noted that Raffensperger and Genetski had been with the company since it was merely an innovative upstart and had more than earned their new positions.</p>
<p>It cannot be overstated how seminal both Christian and Mike have been to not only the success of FanDuel but to the industry more broadly. Amy Howe, FanDuel CEO</p>
<p>Howe added that Genetski’s extensive knowledge of regulators and institutions was critical to the company and its long-term success. Similarly, she lauded Raffensperger’s management skills and marketing prowess and concluded that the two new positions would allow the men to drive FanDuel towards future success.</p>
