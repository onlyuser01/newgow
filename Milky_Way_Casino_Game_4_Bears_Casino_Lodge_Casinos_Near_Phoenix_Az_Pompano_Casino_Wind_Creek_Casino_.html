<p>VEGAS MUSIC ROUNDUP: Usher-ing Out, Minogue Sells Out (Again)</p>

<p>Usher has announced what he claims are the final dozen dates of his Las Vegas residency. It will conclude with a run from Nov. 3-Dec. 2 at Dolby Live at Park MGM, its home since July 2022.</p>

<p>The eight-time Grammy-winner actually began his Vegas residency two years before that, in July 2020, at the Colosseum at Caesars Palace, where he performed 20 shows before switching not only venues but resort chains — a rarity on the Strip.</p>
<p>Usher’s shows have been packed not only with hits such as “My Boo” and “OMG,” but also viral social media moments, such as the headliner’s serenading of Issa Rae and Kim Kardashian. His duet in July on “There Goes My Baby” with Keke Palmer even made gossip headlines when the “Nope” star’s sheer dress drew criticism from Darius Jackson, the actor’s then-boyfriend, who no longer holds that position.</p>
<p>Usher’s 12 final performances take place Nov. 3, 4, 7, 8, 10, 11, 22, 24, 25, and 29, and Dec. 1 and 2.</p>
<p>Tickets go on sale 10 a.m., Friday, Aug. 25. A pre-sale can be accessed by MGM Rewards members starting today.</p>
<p>Set Times are Beautiful</p>
<p>“Life is Beautiful” just released the schedules for its upcoming three-day music and arts festival in downtown Las Vegas. Viewable here, it shows the main Downtown Stage occupied at 11:30 Friday, Sept. 22 by The Killers, at 11:40 p.m. Saturday, Sept. 23 by Kendrick Lamar, and at 11:25 Sunday, Sept. 24 by Odesza.</p>
<p>Other highlights of this year’s shindig include sets by The 1975, FLUME, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, and Kim Petras,</p>
<p>With more than 80 million worldwide album sales, Kylie Minogue, who came to fame with 1988’s “The Loco-Motion,” is the most successful female artist of all time in Australia. (Image: vacationer.travel)</p>
<p>Loco-Ticket-Motion</p>
<p>Whoever decided to place Kylie Minogue’s first Las Vegas residency tickets on sale 10 dates at a time is a marketing genius.</p>
<p>The 55-year-old singer will play 20 dates at the brand new Voltaire at the Venetian from November 3, 2023 through May 4, 2024. The venue holds only 1,000 fans, making it Minogue’s most intimate show in more than a decade.</p>
<p>The Aussie superstar quickly sold out of seats, which started at $200, during both ticket on-sales, leaving only table and travel packages packages featuring hotel and VIP amenities starting at $3,250 per person.</p>
<p>A third slate of 10 dates is expected to be added soon.</p>
