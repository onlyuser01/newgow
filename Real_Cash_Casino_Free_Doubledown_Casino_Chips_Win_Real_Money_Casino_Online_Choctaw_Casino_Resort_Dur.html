<p>BetCity will tap into reactivation, seeking to channel players toward dormant segments and inspire brand loyalty among its customers in the Netherlands</p>
<p>BetCity, an online casino subsidiary of Entain, has signed a new partnership agreement with Enteractive, a B2B company providing retention services. Under the deal, Enteractive will power BetCity’s reactivation campaigns in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>BetCity Employs Enteractive’s Services</p>
<p>Enteractive is a seasoned company delivering leading retention services that reinforces its clients’ own customer relations management (CRM) strategies. The company helps online sportsbooks and iGaming operators inspire player loyalty and optimize revenue generation as a result.</p>
<p>As agreed, the B2B company will produce player retention-focused campaigns for BetCity.nl. Enteractive will leverage its proprietary (Re)Activation Cloud tech platform to seamlessly integrate player databases and allow native-speaking sales agents to connect with BetCity customers.</p>
<p>The personalized approach to CRM has proven to be a winning tactic when it comes to re-engaging players and inspiring brand loyalty. Despite the efforts to channel players toward BetCity’s platform and dormant segments, Enteractive will reactivate players while complying with safer gambling standards.</p>
<p>BetCity was one of the first online gambling companies to be licensed by the Kansspelautoriteit and remains a leading local operator. The brand is headquartered in Amsterdam and has grown rapidly since October 2021, when the Dutch online market launched. At the beginning of 2022, the company had a market share of around 20%, which is why it was promptly acquired by Entain.</p>
<p>Enteractive Is Excited to Re-engage Players for BetCity</p>
<p>BetCity’s marketing director, Robert Kooiman, addressed the new agreement in a statement, saying that his company is glad to have secured Enteractive’s backing. Kooiman believes that the agreement with the reactivation specialist will provide the iGaming brand with an edge over its local competitors.</p>
<p>Enteractive’s personalized one-to-one solutions enable us to grow the relationship with our players as well as ensuring that we’re the responsible choice for players. To generate revenues from previously dormant segments only anticipates a long-term fruitful relationship. Robert Kooiman, marketing director, BetCity</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Enteractive’s senior business development executive, Francesca Raniolo, said that her team is looking forward to working with BetCity. She called the operator an “innovative and exciting brand” that has huge growth potential.</p>
<p>With the untapped potential of lapsed player accounts and the positive response we are receiving from the players, Enteractive is looking forward to making a considerable difference in active player revenues. Francesca Raniolo, senior business development executive, Enteractive</p>
<p>Enteractive’s proven solutions are employed by dozens of leading gaming operators. The company is estimated to reactivate around 13,000 players a month for its partners. Enteractive has teams fluent in various languages, vastly improving its global reach.</p>
