    <h1>Free No Deposit Bonus Casino Little Creek Casino Cosmopolitan Las Vegas Hotel And Casino Blue Chip C</h1>

<p>I am dealing with the same issue as many others and this needs to be solved. I have deposited $250 CAD via Interac e-transfer. They so easily accepted my money. When I went to withdraw $900 after risking losing all of my hard-earned money, I see that the withdrawal method is not even there. Why would a licensed casino accept money via Interac e-transfer and not have the option to withdraw via Interac e-transfer, when they state that you can only withdraw using the same method you have used to deposit. This is clearly a scheme to prevent you from withdrawing any winnings. I contacted support and they told me that sometimes the withdrawal method can "disappear" due to technical issues, and to wait until it "reappears" so that I can make the withdrawal.</p>
<p>I am writing this complaint in order for the casino to act within Licensing regulations and fix the technical issue and add the same payment method that I used to deposit so that I can withdraw my winnings. I have also made a complaint with the licensing commission via email and am waiting for a response.</p>
<p>I have uploaded 2 screenshots showing the payment methods used to deposit and the payment methods used to withdraw. This is completely unfair.</p>
