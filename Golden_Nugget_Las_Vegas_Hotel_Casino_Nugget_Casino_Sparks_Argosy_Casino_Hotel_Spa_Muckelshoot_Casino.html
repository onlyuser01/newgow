<p>SBC Summit Barcelona 2022 will have Matthew Ball, a metaverse guru, and leader, deliver a keynote during the flagship iGaming and sports betting event that is taking place on September 20-22, 2022. Ball will bring his understanding of the metaverse sector and present it to attending audiences, as the technology becomes more relevant to the gambling sector as well.</p>
<p>In his magnum opus, "The Metaverse: And How It Will Revolutionize Everything," Ball explains a future in which the metaverse becomes a driving force behind technological innovation and progress. His book has been showered with accolades by the likes of Sony CEO Kenichiro Yoshida, Netflix co-CEO Reed Hastings, and Epic Games CEO Timothy Sweeney.</p>
<p>That is why SBC Events has found it appropriate to invite the metaverse specialist and have him impart his knowledge to audiences in Barcelona later next month. Commenting on this upcoming opportunity, Ball commented cited by SBCNews.co.uk:</p>
<p>The Metaverse will come to affect every person, sector, and country, creating new jobs, pass times, and business models. This is a multi-trillion-dollar event — and sports betting and iGaming are likely to be among the first categories it will transform.</p>
<p>The Metaverse keynote panel is part of the "Emerging Tech, Blockchain, and Metaverse Zone," which is fully dedicated to how technological advances are poised to upend the future of the industry and bring innovation and change across the board. Even though the event is yet to take place, Ball has already confirmed that he will be coming back to the event next year as well.</p>
<p>SBC founder &amp; CEO Rasmus Sojmark had nothing but praise to offer for the man. Having Ball join at SBC Summit Barcelona is an important moment for the company, Sojmark noted in an official statement. He praised Ball’s thought-provoking ideas and in-depth analysis of key technologies.</p>
<p>Admittedly, the uptake of metaverse technology has not been massive in the gambling industry, although there are clear favorites in the sector. Entain is developing a metaverse project of its own and DraftKings has been dabbling in NFTs, albeit no pronounced metaverse project has been outlined just yet.</p>
<p>Most companies may find Ball’s description of the metaverse inspirational enough to launch a venture in the vertical on their own. Ball will be joining other keynote speakers already announced for the event, including Sportradar CEO Carsten Koerl who will be at the Sports Betting Zone.</p>
