    <h1>Hotel Casinos On The Strip Bullhead City Casinos Hoosier Park Racing Casino Anderson Indiana Online</h1>

<p>I hope I worded that title correctly. What I mean by this is some casinos will have a withdrawal processed within 24 hours of having made the withdrawal (which is optimal, of course)... and some casinos will take "7 to 10 business days, not including weekends". ???? This is, for lack of better words, most certainly not acceptable!</p>
<p>HOW is it that as a customer, we can put our money INTO this casino and within moments, it is there - ready and available for play. But when it's the other direction, a customer is expected to wait 7 to 10 business days (not including weekends - it feels like forever!)..</p>
<p>My question is this: Why hasn't the AGCO or iGaming for that matter put stricter limits on withdrawal processing times. When you go to a land-based casino, you LEAVE with your funds. There is no 7 to 10 business days wait. The incentive to gamble online with those withdrawal times leaves something to be desired, and frankly, one should not have to wait that long EVER for their withdrawal, I mean, there are excellent payment systems out there and some casinos can process a withdrawal INSTANTLY (BetRivers does, it's amazing - two thumbs up!) ... Does anyone know why this long wait time is allowed? Seems to me that perhaps the casino needs more staff in the payments department OR an upgraded payment system, it isn't really fair to have to wait a week for your money.</p>
