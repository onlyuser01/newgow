    <h1>Best Casinos In Biloxi Mississippi Turtle Creek Casino Hotel Slot Casino Online Gold Ranch Casino Ca</h1>

<p>I made two withdrawal requests one at 8 April 62$ and the other at 9 April 100$</p>
<p>they have rules on their website claiming all withdrawals are paid in 5 days, I waited five days then contacted them, they told me the waiting time is seven days not five, then told me again it's 5 days</p>
<p>waited 7 days and didn't receive the money, contacted them and told me they would contact the payment team and I'll get paid in 24 hrs</p>
<p>it has been 8 days now and they didn't send me my money and they keep delaying and wasting my money and lie every time</p>
