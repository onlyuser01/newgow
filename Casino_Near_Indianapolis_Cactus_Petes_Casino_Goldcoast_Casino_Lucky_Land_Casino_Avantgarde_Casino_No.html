<p>After a disastrous start of the season, the Green Bay Packers are back in the game. They now look as a team that has every right to dream of the NFC title after two straight wins. Can they prolong their winning streak?</p>
<p>To do that, they need to beat the Pittsburg Steelers on Sunday, a team whose 2021 story is a complete opposite to the one of Green Bay. Mike Tomlin’s boys started the season with a win, then went on to lose the next two games.</p>
<p>According to oddsmakers, the Steelers might be heading toward another loss.</p>

<p>Aaron Rodgers Gets Back in the MVP Conversation</p>
<p>Zero touchdowns, passer rating of 36.8%, 133 passing yards, and two interceptions – those were the stats of the reigning NFL MVP Aaron Rodgers in Week 1.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, his team lost the Week 1 game to the Saints 38-3. However, the Packers bounced back straight away, with a 35-17 win over the Detroit Lions.</p>
<p>In Week 3, they showed they have nerves made of steel. In San Francisco, the Niners had a one-point lead entering the final minute of the game.</p>
<p>What happened next was an Aaron Rodgers masterclass. The 37-year-old quarterback led the Packers to a 42-yard 37-second drive, setting up a 51-yard goal for Mason Crosby. Green Bay’s placekicker hit the target, thus bringing his team their second straight win.</p>
<p>As a result, Rodgers is back in the MVP conversation, with the odds in the ballpark of +800. Are we going to see him continue playing well now that the Steelers are coming to town?</p>
<p>Underperforming Steelers Hoping to Upset the Odds (Somehow)</p>
<p>The Steelers’ Week 3 performance was one of the worst in the Mike Tomlin era – we saw them lose 24-10 to the Cincinnati Bengals at home. The coach blamed his players for the defeat, suggesting that the team will need to make many big signings in the future if they wish to pursue their playoff dreams.</p>
<p>Right now, however, the Steelers don’t look good. Their defense seems very leaky, while their offensive performances appear to be on a downward path. In fact, Pittsburgh’s offense scored 23 points in Week 1, then 17 in Week 2, before scoring only 10 last Sunday.</p>
<p>What’s even worse is that their schedule in the next couple of weeks looks very rough. They get to face some really strong teams, the strongest of which might be Green Bay.</p>
<p>Pick: Green Bay Packers to win and cover the spread; we should see under hitting this time.</p>
