<p>BetSwap Limited, a fully-integrated secondary marketplace for sportsbooks, is now going to help Amelco, a sportsbook and platform provider, increase its exposure on the US market and deliver on various synergies benefiting both businesses operations in the region.</p>
<p>Amelco is hoping to provide a higher added-value product that will enable partner operators to benefit from the secondary markets extended by BetSwap. Effectively, players with those partner operators will now be able to buy and sell active betslips, the company explains.</p>
<p>Secondary Markets Coming to Amelco’s Partner Operators</p>
<p>BetSwap allows players to shop around for full betslips or sell their own. This feature is available as long as the selections covered by the slips have not been completed. Amelco head of USA Brandon Walker said that the company welcomes innovation in all of its forms in a bid to stay ahead of the competition.</p>
<p>“We are thrilled at the prospect of working with new providers – this deal enables Amelco to provide partners with an enhanced betting experience, giving them an exciting new way to exit betting positions at high margins.” Amelco head of USA Brandon Walker</p>
<p>The integration will allow the company to assist clients seeking to engage with their respective player bases in new and exciting ways.</p>
<p>BetSwap Happy with Developments</p>
<p>The partnership was welcomed by BetSwap CEO and co-founder Brent Winston who said that the collaboration would provide enjoyable and competitive new ways for players to interact with sportsbooks, and other players.</p>
<p>“Amelco’s track record for innovation and growth makes them a perfect partner for BetSwap as we expand our presence not only in the US, but globally.” BetSwap CEO and co-founder Brent Winston</p>
<p>Presently, Amelco’s platform is available in 11 states across the US and the company provides software solutions for leading operators in those jurisdictions. Amelco has been able to secure key partnerships with numerous established companies in the United States, all designed to help the platform advance its offer.</p>
<p>Among those are Prizeout, Evolution, and Pariplay Fusion. Amelco launched a 360 full-service sportsbook with Wind River Casino in October last year and the company continues to work on further consolidation of its US footprint.</p>
