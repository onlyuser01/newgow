<p>The European Cricket Network unveiled an extension of its partnership with iGaming and crypto betting giant Stake.com. As a result, the operator will serve as the official partner of the upcoming European Cricket Championship.</p>
<p>The event is set to take place between September 25 and October 20, 2023, in Malaga, Spain. It will feature 31 national teams from all over Europe and is expected to reach a daily audience surpassing 40 million viewers.</p>
<p>As agreed with the European Cricket Network, Stake.com’s brand will feature across the event, spreading awareness of the operator’s products. The sports body disclosed that it feels excited to once again team up with Stake.com and bring exciting cricket content to millions of fans all over the world.</p>
<p>Stake.com was founded in 2017 and quickly grew to become one of the biggest iGaming companies in the world. Boasting a deep passion for sports, Stake serves as the official partner of a number of sports leagues. For example, the operator serves as the main partner of Everton FC, as well as the official partner of the UFC and the co-title partner of the Alfa Romeo F1 Team.</p>
<p>More recently, the gambling juggernaut formed an alliance with the African Warriors Fighting Championship.</p>
<p>Stake Trusts the Upcoming Championship to Be an Exciting One</p>
<p>Stake’s sponsorship manager, Dominic Rae, commented on the agreement, sharing his team’s delight about the extension of the cricket partnership. Rae added that the upcoming event is likely to be the best edition of the European Cricket Championship yet.</p>
<p>With an increased number of national teams taking part, it promises to be an even better festival of cricket. We’re sure the tournament will be another resounding success for all involved. Dominic Rae, sponsorship manager, Stake.com</p>
<p>Roger Feiner, the chief executive officer of the European Cricket League AG, also shared his thoughts on the agreement. He said that the success of last year’s partnership with Stake.com makes his company excited about the extension.</p>
<p>Feiner pointed out that Stake.com shares his team’s passion for innovation. The inherent synergies between the two parties will result in innovative activations and products for cricket fans.</p>
<p>We are particularly excited about our new evening matches for Stake.com that will be broadcasted primetime into the cricket key markets. Roger Feiner, CEO, European Cricket League AG</p>
