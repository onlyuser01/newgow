<p>The Philadelphia 76ers are walking out in an important game on August 11 and facing off with the season restart’s unstoppable Phoenix Suns. After the Suns have gone on a five-nil winning streak, they may very well be the best team in the Western Conference based on recent performance alone.</p>
<p>Certainly, the Suns have to climb to at least the eighth spot to make it into the playoffs, and if anything, they have been pulling away from it. However, with today’s game versus the Oklahoma City Thunder and the one to follow against the 76ers, we have every reason to believe they are going to secure both.</p>

<p>Philadelphia 76ers Overview – Can They Stop the Suns?</p>
<p>The 76ers are doing quite well so far and their two back-to-back victories, prior to yesterday’s loss to the Portland Trail Blazers, certainly revealed a team that is able to fare well in the face of adversity. They managed to do well against the Trail Blazers as well, and there is no doubt about that.</p>
<p>However, Portland brought the victory home with a three-point difference, which surely felt a little dispiriting, but fans were happy with the 76ers’ performance in that matchup. However, the 76ers are down another NBA All-Star player, with Joel Embiid suffering an injury and now most likely forced to skip the game versus the Suns.</p>
<p>You can expect Tobias Harris to step up and he will have to because the team is losing talent quickly due to injuries. Harris did very well so far, though, averaging 24 points per game, and he’s definitely put in his weight against both the Orlando Magic and Portland.</p>
<p>Another Easy Win for the Phoenix Suns?</p>
<p>The Phoenix Suns returned in the season restart with nobody betting much on them if at all. Since the season has restarted, though, they have completely dismantled the competition, putting in some hard work and hard plays into action.</p>
<p>They are riding on the back of a five-game win streak, and they are definitely looking to improve on their track record today when they will face the Oklahoma City Thunder.</p>
<p>What was this season's assist of the year?!</p>
<p>• Ricky to Ayton</p>
<p>• Dario nutmeg to Baynes</p>

<p>Whether this transpires, though, will boil down to how well Devin Booker and Deandre Ayton do. Booker has been an exceptional player for his team, bringing in 29.4 points. Like many other teams, the Phoenix Suns are heavily dependent on Booker performing well.</p>
<p>Gliding through the court effortlessly, Booker has drawn admiration from fans and even opponents and has caused bad humor in others. In any event, we have our eyes locked on Booker as the MVP for the Suns in the NBA 19/20 Season.</p>
