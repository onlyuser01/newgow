<p>Geolocation technology company Xpoint has agreed to provide its Xpoint Verify real-money gaming geolocation product to PlayStar’s New Jersey business.</p>
<p>PlayStar Adopts the Xpoint Verify Solution</p>
<p>Xpoint agreed to power one of its partners, the iGaming supplier PlayStar, with the Xpoint Verify brand. This will provide PlayStar with a robust geolocation solution and will simultaneously expand Xpoint’s presence in the US market.</p>
<p>Xpoint, which is PlayStar’s official geolocation partner, will continue helping the iGaming tech provider remain compliant with local regulations while providing its customers with safe betting experiences.</p>
<p>As described by Xpoint, Xpoint Verify is a geolocation validator software that allows the company’s partners to validate GPS position, connections and device information at lightning-fast speeds. In addition, Xpoint Verify helps operators comply with local regulations by detecting and preventing fraud. Lastly, the solution’s insights help partner companies devise new growth strategies.</p>
<p>Xpoint and PlayStar Share Similarities</p>
<p>Per Hellberg, the chief executive officer of PlayStar, said that he is excited to have Xpoint as his company’s partner in New Jersey, a state where PlayStar launched just recently. Hellberg believes that PlayStar and Xpoint share a lot of similarities. He described the two companies as young disruptors that are about to enter a kind of a David versus Goliath battle against their respective competitors.</p>
<p>Additionally, this partnership means we stay true to our vision to leverage the most innovative technology in the market to deliver an online casino experience like no other. Per Hellberg, CEO, PlayStar</p>
<p>Marvin Sanderson, co-founder and chief executive at Xpoint, also shared his thoughts. He said that he is delighted to see Xpoint go live with PlayStar and called 2022 a “pivotal year” for the geolocation company. Sanderson is happy to continue pushing Xpoint forward and open a new chapter in the company’s story.</p>
<p>We are innovative, we work tirelessly for our partners, and we exist to help them unlock the true potential of their investment in geolocation tech – previously that has been seen as a utility, but our thinking helps turn that utility into an asset. Marvin Sanderson, CEO, Xpoint</p>
<p>Sanderson concluded that he is excited about Xpoint’s future and asked the company’s followers to stay tuned for further news.</p>
<p>This isn’t Xpoint Verify’s first foray into New Jersey. A week ago, Xpoint Verify went live in the Garden State thanks to Xpoint’s agreement with Sporttrade.</p>
<p>In other news, Xpoint just welcomed three new investors, namely The Raine Group, SuRo Capital Sports, and Acies Investments. The trio joined existing investors, such as Courtside Ventures and Bettor Capital. The latter two increased their contribution amid Xpoint’s latest funding round.</p>
