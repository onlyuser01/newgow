    <h1>Royal Ace Casino No Deposit Bonus Codes Southern Indiana Casino Delaware Park And Casino Augustine C</h1>

<p>Premier gaming software provider AvatarUX has released a fresh music-themed slot based on the award-winning Pop Wins mechanic. The innovative mechanic has already attracted the recognition of prestigious award ceremonies in the industry. In 2021, the studio won the Gold prize in the Game Innovation of the Year category during the CasinoBeats Summit. AvatarUX was also named Slot Supplier Rising Star at the EGR B2B Awards in 2022.</p>
<p>Like other games that are centered around the PopWins feature including CritterPop, CherryPop Deluxe, KokeshiPop, and Raging Pop, HipHopPop offers an amplified gaming experience by expanding the length of average spin sessions. For the moment, the slot is only available for partners via direct integrations. In January, HipHopPop will be accessible to all global operators.</p>

<p>Get Ready to Bounce and Bob!</p>
<p>The PopWins game mechanic boosts the extra thrill within the game while carrying the win potential to up to 50,000x the initial bet. Players are invited to join talented hip-hop artists and start bobbing and weaving during the ultimate rap battles on their way to the Guaranteed Wilds or Synced Reels. Players are invited to unlock all the reels to their maximum height of six so they can activate the free spins round. During it, the reels can go up to nine symbols up.</p>
<p>The Synced Reel Feature</p>
<p>While engaged in the free spins round, players can come across two reels hosting the same symbols. The same feature can be randomly triggered during free spins after the feature is unlocked or it can be activated on each new spin once a second Gamble game is won. Synced Reel can also be triggered while in Buy Bonus.</p>
<p>Buy Bonus MAX</p>
<p>Players can buy the extended Free Spins Mode and benefit from up to 12 Free Spins, Guaranteed Wilds, and Synced Reels on each new spin.</p>
<p>Guaranteed Wilds</p>
<p>When the wild symbols pop up during the free spins, they replace all symbols. Similar to the Synced Reel feature, the Guaranteed Wilds feature can be engaged randomly in free spins mode after unlock or engaged on every new spin once a second Gamble is won. It is also possible to activate it in Buy Bonus mode.</p>
<p>During the free spins mode, a starting multiplier will go up a minimum of 1x each time for every new winning spin.</p>
<p>Speaking about the new release, AvatarUS’s chief executive officer Nicola Longmuir took the opportunity to express the studio’s interest in continuing the exploration of “exciting themes” via the PopWins mechanic.</p>
