<p>Dear Amy,</p>
<p>Thank you for your review.</p>
<p>For your reference, we note that we, at Casilando, take responsible gambling very seriously and as a licensed gaming company, we have implemented a number of company policies and tools to promote responsible gambling. In line with our internal policies and procedures and our license obligations, we have implemented temporary limits which are dependent on the time of day as well as individual criteria.</p>
<p>These measures are designed to help protect our customers and ensure we comply with our regulatory requirements. For example, one measure is that customers receive a ‘time spent’ advisory pop up at designated thresholds. This feature, as with some other features, are automated within our systems, such as deposit, loss and ‘time logged in’ limits.</p>
<p>With these measures, if certain thresholds are reached, play is temporarily prevented until such time as a review can be undertaken by our responsible gambling department. This is designed to further protect our customers where manual detection and responses may not be as fast as our systems. We can confirm that your account triggered these limits which prevented you from playing further temporarily.</p>
<p>Furthermore, please be advised that remote casinos adopt a number of approaches and methods to verifying the identity of their customers. In line with regulatory requirements and our terms and conditions https://www.casilando.com/gb/terms-conditions, particularly clause 5.5, we have the right to carry out additional verification checks at any time. This is to satisfy our license obligations, routine security checks and to safeguard the integrity of your account.</p>
<p>Based on a review of your account activity and the responses provided via the online interaction, a request for source of wealth documents was made; any remaining balances on your account have since been successfully processed, to the payment source it originated from.</p>
<p>Our records also confirm that you have since raised an internal complaint, we would as such encourage you to reach out to our complaints team on complaints@casilando.com should you have any further queries in this respect.</p>
<p>Trusting this provides some clarity on the matter.</p>
<p>Kind Regards</p>
<p>The Casilando Team</p>
