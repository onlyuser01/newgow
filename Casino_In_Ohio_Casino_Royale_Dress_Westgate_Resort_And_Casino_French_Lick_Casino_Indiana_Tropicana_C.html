    <h1>Casino In Ohio Casino Royale Dress Westgate Resort And Casino French Lick Casino Indiana Tropicana C</h1>

<p>An amount of € 1700 was deducted from my balance because I had violated the bonus rules.</p>
<p>The rule is:</p>
<p>For bets with the use of a deposit bonus / deposit offer (free or deposit) or with bonuses that are credited for free game winnings, the maximum allowable stake is 10% (min.0.10) of the bonus amount or 5 (e.g. 5 EUR £ 5) (whichever is lower). Failure to follow this rule will mean you are violating the deposit bonus / offer rules and we reserve the right to void any winnings and remove them from your account. A wager includes any specialty wagering feature, gambling feature, or other type of wagering activity (regardless of name).</p>
<p>My deposit amount was € 80 and I had my stake at a maximum of € 5 per spin.</p>
<p>However, I had used the risk ladder to multiply small winnings and, according to Slingo Casino, this counts as a breach of the rules, as I have exceeded the maximum bet of € 5.</p>
<p>How do you see the situation?</p>
