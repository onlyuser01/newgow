<p>It’s the 11th hour for Everton to start winning more points and avoid relegation. With Burnley’s recent surge, there’s a real danger that the Toffees could drop to the danger zone. They need points ASAP but winning them isn’t going to be easy as their Premier League schedule is really ugly – this Saturday they take on Manchester City.</p>
<p>The Sky Blues are coming off a loss in the previous EPL round, the result of which is that Liverpool is now breathing by their necks with just three points fewer. What this means is that beating Everton is a must for Man City. As you can see below, oddsmakers think Guardiola’s boys will do it.</p>

<p>Everton In Desperation Mode</p>
<p>Everton has been struggling throughout the 2021-22 season, which is why the club directors decided to fire the previous coach and put Frank Lampard in charge. However, since the former Chelsea player took over, Everton hasn’t done much. The Toffees’ record in the EPL under Lampard is one win and two defeats.</p>
<p>The win in question happened against Leeds at Everton’s home ground, Goodison Park. The score was 3-0 for the Toffees, which made their fans optimistic about the future. Unfortunately for them, in the next game, Everton lost 2-0 to Southampton on the road.</p>
<p>This Saturday, the Toffees are back home, which would be an advantage in normal circumstances. However, the fact that they’re welcoming Manchester City isn’t giving anyone confidence. The thing is that Everton has lost each of their five previous games against this opponent played at Goodison Park.</p>
<p>A Must-Win Game for Manchester City</p>
<p>Last Saturday, Manchester City suffered its third Premier League loss of the season, as well as its second defeat on home turf – Tottenham beat the Sky Blues 3-2.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Liverpool continued its superb run, the result of which is that this team is now just three points behind Man City. Add to that the fact that the two are to meet once again before the end of the season and you’ll understand why Man City needs to get back to the winning track as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Pep Guardiola’s team surely has the quality to beat Everton. The evidence is that they were the dominant side even in the loss to Tottenham. The Sky Blues had the ball in their possession for 71% of the time, making nearly four times goal attempts more than the opponent.</p>
<p>They do have some problems with injuries, but that shouldn’t worry them much – this team is famous for its long bench.</p>
<p>Pick: Manchester City to Win; Over 2.5 Goals</p>
