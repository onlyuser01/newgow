    <h1>Q Casino Bonus Code For Ignition Casino Belle Isle Casino Bear River Casino Hotel Mole Lake Casino J</h1>

<p>San Diego-based Jamul Casino has chosen the platform Passport’s Lush™ as its main provider for its loyalty and rewards programs. The platform was developed by Passport Technology, an international heavyweight in innovative payment solutions targeted at the gambling industry. Lush’s adoption by Jamul Casino marks the start of a fruitful partnership between the two companies.</p>
<p>The Unique Characteristics of Passport Technology’s Lush Platform</p>
<p>Jamul Casino has chosen Passport Technology’s Lush™ platform as it provides a higher level of flexibility and customization. After the adoption of the new technology, Jamul Casino is hoping to achieve a higher enrollment of players and improve customer engagement. The company also aims to offer a better program for receiving loyalty points through tailor-made games. Customizable and dynamic promotional offers are also an integral part of the new partnership.</p>
<p>Jamul Casino Director of Marketing, Kristel Nichols, elaborated on why the casino selected Lush:</p>
<p>We chose Lush for the combined enrollment functionality and flexibility in creating unique, robust campaigns while providing a fun, seamless experience for our guests. Jamul Casino Director of Marketing, Kristel Nichols</p>
<p>What makes the Lush platform unique, is that it uses HTML5 and cloud-based services, something no other platform within the industry offers. This provides endless opportunities for customization of various platform elements such as branding, gamification, digital artwork, etc.</p>
<p>Passport Technology’s Principal of Digital Wallet, Loyalty &amp; Innovation, Diallo Gordon, noted that his company could not wish for a more collaborative partner than Jamul Casino. Wallet also commented that the casino’s focus on high customer satisfaction and retention through tier programs and outstanding customer service aligns perfectly with the opportunities and services the Lush platform provides.</p>
<p>The Lush Kiosk</p>
<p>Another important feature that the partnership between Jamul Casino and Passport Technology brings to the table is the Lush Kiosk. Through it, the customers of the casino will be able to take advantage of a variety of features that are within the platform’s self-service options. These include signing up for a player club, the possibility to reprint cards, an array of personalized games, and other offerings.</p>
<p>In addition, customers of the casino will be offered a unique redemption platform called Earn and Shop™. Again, the most prominent of its characteristics is customization. Customers can enjoy a range of gift card options, which are totally configurable. Within the platform, players can reclaim points whenever they want and this can be done instantly. They will also be able to exchange them for digital or physical gift cards or actual goods.</p>
