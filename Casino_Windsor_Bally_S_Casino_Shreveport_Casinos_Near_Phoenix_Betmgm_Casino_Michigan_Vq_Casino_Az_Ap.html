<p>Apparat Gaming has released 7 Supernova Fruits, a 5x3 slot with high volatility, a max win of up to 1,000x, and Supernova Wilds</p>
<p>The creator of iGaming content “with a German Accent”, Apparat Gaming, has announced its freshest slot release, 7 Supernova Fruits. The game is expected to send players into explosive gameplay while promising an impressive big-win potential.</p>
<p>The cosmos-themed 5×3 game with an added fruity flavor to it counts 10 active paylines. The mix of themes is specific to Apparat Gaming titles while the top-quality graphics design and illustrations are described as “Augenweide” or eye candy.</p>
<p>At the end of last month, the company released the 5×3 video slot Mallorca Wilds after previously announcing that the permits for its first batches of games for Germany had been finally issued, one year after being submitted.</p>

<p>Waiting for the Supernova Wild to Burst Into Cosmic Wins</p>
<p>The game not only looks good and offers smooth and well-streamlined gameplay, but it also comes with a fascinating, edgy soundtrack, especially when the booming explosions occur once the Supernova Wild symbols are seen landing on the grid.</p>
<p>Once all reels are fired up, they will carry players to the center of cosmic chaos where the Supernova will unleash its power and transform all adjacent symbols into Wild symbols.</p>
<p>Together with the high volatility of the game and the maximum win set at 1,000x, players can expect some truly exciting action on the reels.</p>
<p>Commenting on the new release, co-founder and director Thomas Wendt praised the ”incredible soundtrack” that does a great job at building anticipation while sending players to the edge of their seats as they wait for the Supernova Wild to land and generate some massive wins.</p>
<p>Wendt also explained the choice of theme revolving around the Supernovas that are known for being “one of the greatest spectacles” that only occurs once a century in our galaxy. However, this is something that the studio decided to correct in their latest release by considerably increasing the frequency at which Supernovas are seen on the grid.</p>
<p>Similar to the rest of the provider’s games, 7 Supernova Fruits has been given the green light to make an appearance in regulated markets like the Netherlands, the UK, Spain, Denmark, Portugal, Bulgaria, Greece, Isle and Man, Romania, Switzerland, Sweden, and Germany.</p>
<p>At the start of June, Apparat Gaming announced the launch of video slots in Switzerland via Swiss4Win after expanding its content reach thanks to a new partnership with the renowned iGaming platform and sportsbook provider, Gaming Innovation Group.</p>
