<p>Parimatch Tech has finally acquired a Gaming Laboratories International accreditation, achieving a B2B certification for sports &amp; casinos. The platform has obtained both GLI19 and GLI33 licenses which will ensure that it’s a trusted and dependable solution in the iGaming and sports betting spaces.</p>
<p>GLI’s Certification Attests to Parimatch Competitive Edge</p>
<p>GLI is essentially bolstering Parimatch’s reach with new businesses as the certifications are often a necessary step in securing licenses or even striking partnerships in highly-regulated markets. Parimatch will surely benefit as it runs a catalog of more than 10,000 games provided by 200 providers in its aggregation platform. The sportsbook platform has another 50,000 live events across 33 sports.</p>
<p>Parimatch Tech head of compliance Yurii Shevchuk commented on the latest development and said that the accreditation by GLI was an important step forward for the company. The certificates demonstrated the power of Parimatch’s software and hardware and argued that GLI’s certificates are the benchmark in the industry. He added:</p>
<p>Obtaining GLI19 and GLI33 certifications underlines the quality of our products developed for the global expansion of the Parimatch brand. We are longingly expecting exciting opportunities for further development. Parimatch Tech head of compliance Yurii Shevchuk</p>
<p>Parimatch has had to quickly adapt to the geopolitical realities in Ukraine and Russia. Following the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, the company severed all ties with the Russian market and issued a bold statement in which it said that it would not do business with any Russia-affiliated companies.</p>
<p>However, the company took the reduction of business in stride and quickly developed a dedicated aggregation casino content platform, EVA. This aggregation platform grew to quick prominence through skilled negotiation with key operators and the creation of a number of desired services that enabled Parimatch to offer potential partners a sound product.</p>
<p>Parimatch Adapts to New Realities and Drives Innovation</p>
<p>EVA is equipped with casino wallet technology as well as tournament tools and other solutions that enable the company to pursue better engagement and reach with iGaming audiences. Parimatch recently confirmed that its Chief Marketing Officer Ivan Liashenko had decided to quit the company.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Parimatch has been actively seeking to support Ukraine even though much of the company’s operations have been outside of the country for the past decade. Parimatch spearheaded a communication campaign to help raise humanitarian aid for Ukraine. The company also launched the “Give a Job for UA” campaign to help millions of people relocating find a job.</p>
