<p>GeoComply has launched its Conscious Gaming tool to complement Pennsylvania’s “PlayPause” self-exclusion solution now live in the Keystone State and develop corporate social responsibility to protect consumers.</p>
<p>GeoComply’s Conscious Gaming Complements PlayPause</p>
<p>Pennsylvania is taking responsible gambling a step further with GeoComply’s consumer-focused protection program Conscious Gaming launching to bolster player protection in the Keystone State in collaboration with the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board (PGCB).</p>
<p>Thanks to the initiative, regulators, as well as operators, are now able to quickly identify at-risk consumers who may be trying to participate in gambling activities despite having excluded beforehand.</p>
<p>The solution is integrated with Pennsylvania’s PlayPause which should make it possible for businesses to make their operations safer and reliably collect information about at-risk consumers.</p>
<p>Commenting on the progress achieved so far, PGCB head of compulsive and problem gambling, Elizabeth Lanza, said that integrating GeoComply’s consumer protection tool allows for not just a state-based but national monitoring of consumers who are at risk of developing a gambling addiction.</p>
<p>Lanza confirmed that the regulator is interested in working with stakeholders from across the entire country to ensure a better and more reliable service. Thanks to Conscious Gaming, GeoComply hopes to assist businesses in developing a corporate social responsibility and protect consumers across the entire country.</p>
<p>GeoComply is currently the tool that makes it possible to track whether consumers access gambling products from within a whitelisted jurisdiction and their state borders.</p>
<p>It was a subject to fiery debate prior to the adoption of sports betting in many states, with lawmakers doubting whether state-restrictions may apply reliably and whether consumers would not just jump states to play from somewhere else.</p>
<p>Commenting on the solution, Anna Sainsbury from Conscious Gaming and GeoComply chair, said that the organization was excited to bring a self-exclusion tool that works on a national level and can complement the already promising PlayPause solution rolling out in the Keystone State.</p>
