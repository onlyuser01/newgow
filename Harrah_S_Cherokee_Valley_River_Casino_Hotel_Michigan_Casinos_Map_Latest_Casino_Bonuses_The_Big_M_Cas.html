<p>The UK Tote Group, which is both the owner and steward of the Tote, the largest leading pool betting operator in the UK, and the 1884-founded racing club Hong Kong Jockey Club (HKJC) have sealed an important five-year partnership.</p>
<p>The newly announced deal will help the two parties continue their lucrative collaboration by the end of 2028.</p>
<p>A Crucial Moment for the UK Tote, the British and Irish Horse Racing Industries</p>
<p>According to UK Tote Group’s chairman, John Williamson, the news represents “a very significant moment for the UK Tote, and for British and Irish horse racing” in their endeavor to keep growing and expanding their partnership with the HKJC.</p>
<p>Now, added Williamson, the UK Tote will speed up its development plans for World Pool, a branch with proven results in boosting its revenue stream by millions. Besides the regular world-class racing content from Hong Kong via Happy Valley and Sha Tin, the UK Tote will also contribute to advancing fresh and innovative technology releases while adding new types of bets.</p>
<p>The group has already proven its interest in innovation over the years. Last March, they announced a partnership with Voxbet for a voice and text messaging solution for bettors. In light of the new deal, the UK Tote hopes to “be true to its founding principles of being on the side of both horseracing and the customers.”</p>
<p>The Fifth Year for World Pool</p>
<p>World Pool currently counts 28 different pool betting operators from all parts of the planet commingling into a unique pool that is operated by the HKJC. Bettors can take their pick from 25 high-profile race meetings, 18 of which are held in the UK and Ireland.</p>
<p>Thanks to the new agreement, the UK Tote will turn into the exclusive pool partner for World Pool for the Irish and British markets. World Pool is already triggering new funds and important financial returns for the horseracing industries in the UK and Ireland with the help of media rights payments for all participating racecourses.</p>
<p>The funds are invested into prize money used to show support for Britain’s racing’s feature meetings and they are also expected to speed up following World Pool’s development in the upcoming years.</p>
<p>In 2023 alone, the 25 World Pool days that will be held between May and October will generate more than £31 million ($39.7 million) in cash prizes. In 2022, the sport recorded a global turnover of £650 million ($832.6 million). Out of the amount, £521 million ($667.3 million) was wagered on the British and Irish race days, marking a 44% increase compared to 2021.</p>
<p>HKJC’s chief executive officer, Winfried Engelbrecht-Bresges, called the UK Tote “instrumental” in the development of World Pool. The official added that the new agreement is expected to support their “very valued partnership.”</p>
<p>At the end of May, the UK Tote Group appointed popular jockey Tom Marquand as its new ambassador.</p>
