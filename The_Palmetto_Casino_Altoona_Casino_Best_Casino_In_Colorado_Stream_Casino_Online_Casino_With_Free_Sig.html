    <h1>The Palmetto Casino Altoona Casino Best Casino In Colorado Stream Casino Online Casino With Free Sig</h1>

<p>Hello, I joined this casino just two weeks ago. I have deposited 50 euros and today have 800 euros. Every time I have sent a document and they say that your account is verified and you can make a withdrawal, a few days later I get an email that the withdrawal is validated and they request additional documents. I have verified myself with a driver's license, bank statement, certificate from the bank showing my iban and bic for withdrawals from the same account I used to deposit money, selfie of me with my driver's license in hand, proof of address with invoice.. It feels like that this will go on forever and new documents will have to be sent forward until I get tired. Can you help me with this as their customer service feels fake and I get the same answer all the time. Their support mail feels like a robot and I there with the same answer. Will I ever get my money back or is this a waste of time. When I have confronted them in addition, they have just canceled and left the chat.</p>
