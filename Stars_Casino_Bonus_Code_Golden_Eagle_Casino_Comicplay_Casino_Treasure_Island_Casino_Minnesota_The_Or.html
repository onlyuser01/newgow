<p>Hi,</p>
<p>We hope this message finds you well. We are writing to address the recent situation regarding your winnings and your expired bonus.</p>
<p>As stated in our terms and conditions (section 23.6), you have the right to cancel any bonuses before proceeding to their wagering, without losing your own funds. However, if you choose to cancel a bonus (or it in anyway the bonus becomes void, like expiring) after playing with bonus funds but before fulfilling the wagering requirements, any winnings accumulated during the bonus period will be deducted, as outlined in the same section.</p>
<p>Additionally, section 23.17 of our terms and conditions explains that if you choose to request a withdrawal of your deposit before meeting the bonus wagering requirements, the bonus amount and associated winnings will be voided. The remaining funds, if any, will be paid out to you.</p>
<p>We understand that this may come as a disappointment, and we empathize with your situation. However, it is essential to uphold the fairness and integrity of our platform, which is why we have these terms and conditions in place. These measures ensure that all players have an equal and fair chance to enjoy our games and promotions while maintaining a balanced playing field for everyone involved.</p>
<p>We value your participation and support within our casino, and we genuinely regret any inconvenience this situation may have caused. We encourage you to review our terms and conditions for a better understanding of the bonus policies and wagering requirements associated with our promotions.</p>
<p>If you have any further questions or require clarification regarding this matter or any other aspect of our casino, please do not hesitate to reach out to our customer support team. We are here to assist you and provide any necessary information to ensure your continued enjoyment of our platform.</p>
