    <h1>Casino Houston Vegas Casino News Beau Rivage Casino Biloxi Ms Silver Sevens Hotel Casino Las Vegas J</h1>

<p>Global leader in product innovation and state-of-the-art IT solutions for live casino streaming Evolution has appointed Jacob Claesson as its new chief executive officer. Claesson will rule over the North American division, making the switch from his previous position as US head of operations at Evolution.</p>
<p>Six Years and Counting</p>
<p>Taking the news to its Twitter and LinkedIn accounts, Claesson expressed his excitement regarding his appointment as well as the “opportunities” ahead of the company that is “still only in its infancy” in North America. Claesson will need to report directly to the company’s global chief executive officer Martin Carlesund.</p>
<p>The new CEO for the US divisions is rather familiar with the company that is listed on Nasdaq Nordic and caters to the needs of millions of international users while processing transactions worth thousands of US Dollars every passing second. Claesson has spent close to six years with Evolution. His adventure here started as efficiency &amp; implementation manager/key account manager in February 2016, a position he quickly exchanged for the role of head of integration and delivery for the following two years and a half. His main requirements were to oversee Evolution’s delivery organization consisting of project management, technical operations, and integration teams in Latvia and Malta.</p>
<p>Next, he spent the following four years as Evolution’s head of operations in Georgia, supervising their Tbilisi studio, preparing all operations, and growing the studio’s employee count to almost 6,000 employees. In return, this helped the Georgia branch become one of the largest employers in the country. The head of operations for North America position soon followed, requiring Claesson to oversee the operational elements of the company’s broadcasting studios located both in the USA and Canada while growing their game portfolio.</p>
<p>Previous Knowledge</p>
<p>Before he started his impressive work for the 2006-founded company that found its inspiration in the world-famous Monte Carlo casino, Claesson also spent over a decade working for Klarna and Movestic. Klarna is a Stockholm-based company with over 450,000 global retail partners aiming to become the “favorite way to shop and bring flexible healthy financial services to consumers.” Claesson spent more than four years as acting manager for the implementation team, enterprise implementation manager, and manager for technical sales, coordination, and international. He also spent almost six and a half years working for Movestic Life &amp; Pension, a company that specializes in personalized savings and insurance protection for individuals and companies. There, he was an insurance administrator and an office manager.</p>
<p>Evolution currently has 13,000 Evolutioneers working in its sites spread across five continents and it is continuously looking for even more high-performing talents ready to put their mindset as team players to good use. In June, the company made an upfront offer for €200 million ($210 million) to buy Nolimit City.</p>
