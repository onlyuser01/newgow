<p>Raptors on the Cusp of NBA Finals, but Handicappers, Bettors Not Quite Convinced</p>

<p>Toronto overcame a 14-point first half deficit and needed a big rally in the fourth quarter to win Thursday night’s Game 5 105-99 at Milwaukee. Now, after losing the first two games of the NBA’s Eastern Conference final, the Raptors find themselves on the brink on their first-ever appearance in the NBA Finals.</p>

<p>But, while Toronto has reeled off three straight wins in the best-of-seven series, are bettors and oddsmakers confident about the Raptors chances?</p>
<p>In the moments after Game 5 ended, PropSwap, a secondary market for sportsbook tickets, brokered sales for at least three Raptors futures bets, including a $500 ticket on the Raptors to win the series at +162 odds to win for $1,300. Another $500 Raptors series bet, this one with +133 odds, went for $900.</p>
<p>PropSwap co-founder Luke Pergande told Casino.org that’s a sign bettors are bearish on the Raptors.</p>
<p>Our sellers still think Milwaukee wins this,” Pergande said. “And looking at the odds, so do the books.”</p>
<p>When the series started nine days ago, the Westgate SuperBook offered the Bucks as -330 favorites, while offering the Raptors at +260. After Milwaukee won the first two games, FanDuel listed the Bucks at -650 and the Raptors at +430.</p>
<p>By Friday morning, the Raptors had become the SuperBook’s favorite at -240, while the Bucks, who now need to win the remaining two games to win the series, are priced at +190. FanDuel offered similar prices, -245 for Toronto and +194 for the Bucks.</p>
<p>While Toronto has put itself in a position to win the series and become the favorite, odds of -245 are not necessarily low odds for a team in the Raptors’ position. It also would be likely to see the odds flip again if Milwaukee can force a Game 7, which the Bucks would host.</p>
<p>Game 6 Saturday Night</p>
<p>The Raptors will get a chance to close out the series at home on Saturday. They opened as two-point favorites at most Las Vegas sportsbooks, and the line has since moved to 2.5.</p>
<p>As a home favorite, according to teamrankings.com, Toronto is 23-26 this season against the spread at home.</p>
<p>Adding to the intrigue Milwaukee superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo left Game 5 late with an ankle injury, although he told reporters after the game that he felt fine.</p>
<p>Antetokounmpo said his teammates know their backs are against the wall.</p>
<p>“We got to get Game 6,” he said. “We got to fix anything we’re doing wrong right now. We’re just trying to play winning basketball.”</p>
<p>This season, Milwaukee is 19-6 against the spread coming off a loss, and they’re 8-3 as a road underdog. However, in this series, the Bucks have failed to cover in the last three games.</p>
<p>Warriors Await</p>
<p>While Milwaukee and Toronto continue to battle, Golden State gets to rest up in hopes of a threepeat.</p>
<p>And the Warriors also see their odds get even lower, even if Kevin Durant may not make it back for the entire series,</p>
<p>Golden State, which was -220 at FanDuel to win it all after sweeping Portland, is now -300. The Raptors have moved from +1000 to +370, while Milwaukee has gone from +195 to +150.</p>
<p>The SuperBook lists the Warriors at -275, the Raptors at +400, and the Bucks at +700.</p>
<p>However, when it comes to head-to-head series betting, oddsmakers think the Bucks would have a better chance against the Warriors than the Raptors.</p>
<p>At the SuperBook, the Warriors are a -240 favorite against the Bucks (+190). However, they’re a -300 favorite against the Raptors (+260). FanDuel has it -210/+175 for Warriors-Bucks and -250/+205 for Warriors-Raptors.</p>
<p>Regardless of when the Eastern Conference final ends, the NBA Finals will start on May 30.</p>
