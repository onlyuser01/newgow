<p>Yes, hello, first of all, thank you for the answer, I made a deposit and played up to 510 in one game, which is not forbidden. Because there was a €20 bonus, I only had 480 in the payout, i.e. I lost the rest of the €10 bonus after 2 or 2 After three hours I decided to withdraw so that was all real money. I then had 400€ in the payout via litcoin and played with the remaining 80€ and played a game that is forbidden, it's completely out of the blue why they just paid me out have deleted it is unbelievable what the operators are doing with the people here, I haven't done anything illegal, it's all legal, how can they just do it when I'm in the payout when there was no money in the account, only they say 80 euros, it's forbidden to play the game That's not entirely accurate 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯AND THAT WAS ANOTHER SALES-FREE BONUS THAT'S HOW THEY ADVERTISED IT I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE THINGS THEY'RE GOING TO DO I made another payout yesterday that hasn't been processed yet but the 400 suddenly went away 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 no, this is not my first bonus and I could always pay out no man would only be advertised via email, pay everything without any turnover and you can have the winnings paid out at any time😴😴😴😴😴😴 you would It wasn't pointed out that the game is forbidden, they do that specifically🙏🙏🙏That's what I get as an answerHello Christian,</p>
