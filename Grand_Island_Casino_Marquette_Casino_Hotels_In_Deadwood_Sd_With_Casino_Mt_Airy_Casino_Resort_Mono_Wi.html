<p>IGT’s iLottery system is a one-stop solution that comes with a full suite of advanced, customizable responsible gaming tools</p>
<p>International Game Technology (IGT), a global leader in gaming tech, announced that its subsidiary, IGT Global Solutions Corporations, has secured a new contract with the Connecticut Lottery Corporation (CLC).</p>
<p>Under the eight-year agreement, the supplier will power the lottery with its iLottery gaming system and all related components. The CLC will thus receive access to a reliable iLottery system packed with a comprehensive range of solutions designed to engage online players.</p>
<p>The integration will allow the CLC to sell Keno and draw-based lottery games online for the first time. Draw-based lottery games will include games such as Lotto!, Cash5, Play3 with Wild Ball and Play4 with Wild Ball. The new products will be available on a brand-new website and mobile app developed by IGT. The new products are expected to launch later this year.</p>
<p>The agreement between IGT and the CLC is set to expire in May 2031 but can be renewed for four more years.</p>
<p>IGT’s iLottery system is a one-stop solution that comes with a full suite of advanced, customizable responsible gaming tools that protect players and allow operators to remain compliant and socially responsible.</p>
<p>The CLC Wants to Modernize Its Products</p>
<p>Gregory Smith, president &amp; chief executive officer of the Connecticut Lottery Corporation, said that his team recognizes the importance of modernization. Since many contemporary players want to play online, the corporation didn’t have a choice but to heed their demands.</p>
<p>According to Smith, IGT’s iLottery system will be perfect for its players, allowing them to have “the same great experiences they receive at retail in a responsible, digital format.”</p>
<p>We look forward to deploying this iLottery system and believe the expanded play options will be a welcome addition among our players. Gregory Smith, president &amp; CEO, CLC</p>
<p>IGT’s senior vice president of global iLottery, Srini Nedunuri, also commented on the matter. He highlighted IGT’s experience in the field, saying that the company is excited to build upon its momentum and provide iLottery to players of the Connecticut Lottery.</p>
<p>We will partner closely with the CLC over the next eight years to develop a world-class iLottery program and help to generate maximum funds to good causes within the State. Srini Nedunuri, SVP of global iLottery, IGT</p>
<p>IGT just expanded the reach of its wide area progressive jackpots to New Jersey, the second NA jurisdiction where these products are available. Earlier, IGT launched its Fortune X Poker product in California.</p>
