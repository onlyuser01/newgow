    <h1>Vicksburg Casino Hotel Casino Near Me Louisiana Gila River Casinos Inclave Casino List Isleta Casino</h1>

<p>Last Sunday I took a 200% bonus and deposited $100 which gave me a 15000 play thru. Playing hour after hour I finished the play thru and ended up with a balance of 6479. I allocated 2500 withdrawal their max per week. That left me with $3979.00 in my account. Of course its hard just to let it sit their so i decided to play and try to win more. Well I lost 2K over the next few days. My balance now was $4466.00. I contacted customer service and ask about my pending withdrawal. They said I need to send my documents in. I sent them in immediately and the next day I was approved. I allocated another withdrawal which at that time was only 2000. Today I received an email that I breached the max bet rule. First off. I know the rules at Drake and I abide by the rules. In fact, I contacted customer service when I first deposited to make sure of the max bet which is $25. They said I made a $60 bet on a game called Wizards Jackpot.</p>
<p>LETTER FROM DRAKE.</p>
<p>This is regarding your account with us.</p>
<p>Considering you had requested two withdrawals for a total of $4,466.00 (excluding $80.00 in fees), we would like to let you know that we have conducted our standard account review before processing these and it turned out that unfortunately you have broken a certain rule of ours when it comes to wagering with bonus funds. Namely, whenever you are collecting rollover points towards fulfilling the respective wagering requirement, you shall not do slot spins for more than $25.00 each as this is forbidden. That includes any in-game features that increase your spin value. It leads to all rollover points and any money you might have gained during or after that occurrence getting voided.</p>
<p>Since there are many such spins made by yourself – initially one for $60.00 on the Wizards Jackpot game – during play towards the ‘Sunday Funday 200% Cash (VIP)’ bonus that you’ve accepted on November 5th, we have now cancelled your withdrawal request and brought your account standing to the point exactly before you made that spin.</p>
<p>At this moment you have $720.93 available in your balance and you’ve collected a total of 502.69 rollover points, meaning you need to accrue 14,497.31 more points to fulfill the requirement. Once you’ve done so, you will be able to place a new withdrawal request as long you don't accept another bonus in the meantime.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, feel free to contact us at any time.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Richard</p>

<p>I asked them for the game panels that show the bet and the outcome of that spin. All these games have a panel game spin number so it can be investigated. I told them I have a right to see the game panel if you are accusing me of a breach.</p>
<p>After doing some research I signed into my account at Drake and went to that game Wizards Jackpot. On the bet size tab clicking upwards there is no bet of $60. there is a $1 thru $50 and then the next size is $75. I then contacted customer service and told them this. They said I made the bet on the BONUS BUY IN. This is a link so if you want to buy the bonus you can. The bonus buy in is based on your game bets. If you are betting 1 dollar and you click on the bonus buy in It says do you want to pay 30 dollars for this bonus. That is what it costs the player to play the bonus and possibly win more. It is not a bet it is a cost SEE ATTCHED OF THE BONUS BUY IN.</p>
<p>THE BET SIZE IS $2 ---- IT WILL COST YOU $60 TO PLAY THE BONUS. THAT'S MY BREACH. THE $60 IS NOT THE BET SIZE.</p>
<p>THIS PEOPLE AT DRAKE JUST DO NOT WANT TO PAYOUT MY WINNINGS. THEY MANIPULATE THE MANUFACTURERS DESIGN OF THE GAME SO THE PLAYER BREACHED THE RULES.</p>
<p>THIS WAS A 2 DOLLAR GAME BET NOT $60</p>
