<p>Recent data from the UK Gambling Commission (GC) shows a significant decline in gambling activity in January and February compared to 2020.</p>
<p>Gambling Commission Reveals Dip in Gambling Activity</p>
<p>The UK Gambling Commission (GC) has released statistics detailing changes in gambling activity for January and February 2021. In comparison to December 2020, the data indicates a significant decrease in overall gambling activity.</p>
<p>The GC has discovered that gross gambling yield (GGY) fell to £495.4 million in February, down 19% from December of last year. The number of active accounts has decreased by 4% to around 10.2 million, while total wagers have declined by 6% to 6.2 billion.</p>
<p>The real-event betting yield has also dropped significantly, falling to £234.5 million in February, down 16% from December 2020. In January and February, virtual event betting and esports betting totaled £6.7 million and £1.6 million, respectively.</p>
<p>Slot Machine Figures Remain Relatively Stable</p>
<p>Slot machines have also been affected but to a lesser extent. Slot GGY fell to about £176.9 million at the start of the year, down 1% from December. The total number of spins decreased by 6% to 5.50 billion. The number of active accounts, on the other hand, has held steady at 3.0 million.</p>
<p>From December to February, the number of online slots sessions lasting more than an hour increased by 4%. The number of sessions peaked in January at 2.6 million, then fell by 1% in February. The average session duration was 21.5 minutes, according to the data gathered by the GC. Around 9% of sessions, or approximately 2.5 million, lasted more than an hour.</p>
<p>Decreased Performance Linked to Stricter Lockdown Measures</p>
<p>The overall decline in profitability can be traced back to the ongoing lockdown measures in the UK. After the holiday season, the number of COVID-19 cases in the country unexpectedly increased, leading the UK government to tighten safety measures once more. Unfortunately, this rendered the land-based sector entirely unusable, resulting in lower-than-expected income.</p>
<p>It is important to mention that the Isle of Man has been lauded for its handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. In fact, the crown dependency is enjoying a surge in interest from international gaming operators.</p>
<p>The UK expects to reopen betting shops on April 12th, followed by casinos on May 17th, if there are no unexpected increases in infectivity.</p>
<p>The Commission also stated that it has written to operators requesting increased caution as lockdowns may put many customers at risk.</p>
