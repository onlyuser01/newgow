<p>Nordic Affiliates has joined the Norsk Bransjeforening for Onlinespill, a trade union for iGaming companies in Norway. The marketing specialist is the first affiliate to join the union.</p>
<p>Nordic Affiliates, a team of serious iGaming affiliate marketers, has become a member of the Norwegian Online Gambling Trade Organization (Norsk Bransjeforening for Onlinespill/NBO). In fact, the former party is the first affiliate to join the latter organization’s ranks.</p>
<p>The NBO Seeks to Usher in an Era of Modern iGaming</p>
<p>As reported by iGB, Nordic Affiliates hopes that its decision to join the NBO will prompt other companies to also join the union and oppose Norway’s monopolistic approach to gambling. For reference, only two companies, namely the casino specialist Norsk Tipping and the horse racing operator Norsk Rikstoto, are allowed to offer online gambling in the country.</p>
<p>The NBO was founded three years ago by major gaming companies. Betsson, ComeOn Group, gaming Innovation Group and Kindred were the first to unite their efforts and promote the adoption of a modern online gambling market in the Northern European country.</p>
<p>To that end, the NBO works hard to educate people about the intricacies of the online gambling sector, the differences between the regulated and the unregulated market and everything that customers and industry professionals should know.</p>
<p>Nordic Affiliates, the newest member of the organization, is a well-known Nordic affiliate website operating under the Norskeautomater.com domain, The new member has joined the company as a sponsor.</p>
<p>The Affiliate Believes Change Is Needed</p>
<p>Nordic Affiliates commented on its decision to join the NBO. According to Havard Lehn, one of the affiliate’s founders, Norway must introduce a regulated approach to gambling. Lehn, a Norwegian himself, has worked in the industry for more than ten years, which is why he believes this to be the right solution.</p>
<p>Lehn blasted politicians for being all talk and no action, saying that no real change is ever introduced, which adds to the woes of people suffering from gambling harm. According to him, all industry professionals should unite under the NBO – a move that Lehn is certain would be beneficial for both the Norwegian society and the country’s gambling industry.</p>
<p>NBO’s secretary general, Carl Fredrik Stenstrøm, wholeheartedly agreed with what Lehn stated. Stenstrøm is certain that regulated gambling open to commercial companies would be introduced sooner or later. The only matter, according to him is not “if” but “when.”</p>
<p>Stenstrøm acknowledges that change can be slow. Because of that, he believes that the industry should remain united in order to achieve its ambitions. Stenstrøm noted that the NBO has achieved more since its creation than the entire industry has achieved in the last two decades.</p>
