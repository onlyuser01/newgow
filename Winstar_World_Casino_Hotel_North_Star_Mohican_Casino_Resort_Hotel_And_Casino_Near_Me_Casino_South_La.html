    <h1>Winstar World Casino Hotel North Star Mohican Casino Resort Hotel And Casino Near Me Casino South La</h1>

<p>The issue started on the 2nd October whereby I won in total 2100 euros. As they were delaying with my withdrawal (they took over 8 days in total) I reversed my winnings of 700 and wanted to play with the 100 and withdraw back the 600. When I tried to withdraw the casino locked the money in my account. I reported it immediately to the casino and even asked them to withdraw the funds manually. They refused. They confirmed that they had technical issues with the ewallets. I opened all suggested ewallets that they suggested but none of them would allow me to make deposits as I am in Cyprus apart from paysafecard and muchbetter. They told me that I couldnt withdraw to either in the end i provided them with two of my bank account details. Due to the technical issues and my money being locked into the casino I lost the 600 despite me trying to withdraw over 9 times. I spoke to the support and asked for a refund as it was not my fault that the casino gave me.no means of withdrawing the 600. For 15 days they told me they were processing my refund. The last 3 days they said they were performing security checks. Yesterday the support sent me a horrible message accusing me of using a bug and would not give me any money and i would be blocked. I did not dare play at the casino since the 2nd october due to being afraid of them locking my funds as an available blce in the casino. When I asked for them to provide evidence of this bug they refused. Since the 2nd october i asked them for countless updates and emails and i was told each time dont worry be patient ur refund is in process. Im furious as I think the casino deliberately did this for me to lose my winnings amongst this I was appointed a vip manager who was trying to get me to deposit and try to offer me bonuses i told him until the issue with the withdrawal is resolved that i didnt want to play. I believe that I was taken advantage of and now they are trying to accuse me of using a buy with no evidence even when I asked them over and over again. I feel the way I was treated was totally unfair.</p>
