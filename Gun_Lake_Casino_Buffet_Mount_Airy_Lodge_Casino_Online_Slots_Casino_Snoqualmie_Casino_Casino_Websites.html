<p>Better Collective, the leading developer of educational platforms within the iGaming industry, has hired a new group branding and media senior director.</p>
<p>Switching from Media to IGaming</p>
<p>The one stepping to the task is Pernille Holbøll, an experienced individual who has previously worked within the media sector. Before the current deal, she held a job in the Danish tabloid newspaper Ekstra Bladet. In her previous position, Holbøll served as the newspaper’s editor in chief and before that as its head of digital and head of news.</p>
<p>Holbøll’s experience extends beyond her role at Ekstra Bladet. Her career began as a guest lecturer at the Danish School of Media and Journalism. She later became a journalist for Danmarks Radio.</p>
<p>Then, prior to joining Ekstra Bladet, Holbøll served as the managing editor of the Danish television channel tv2.dk and then worked for another newspaper by the name Metroxpress where she was taking the role of a head of news.</p>
<p>Holbøll will step into her new job on March 1 next year, right after her maternity leave is over. As a senior director of group branding and media at Better Collective, she will take care of the company’s brand. Speaking on the matter, Holbøll also revealed that her responsibilities will include using her skill in management and digitalization and media to realize Better Collective’s vision of making iGaming entertainment transparent and fair.</p>
<p>Holbøll is Excited for the Future of the Company</p>
<p>For Holbøll, switching from the media sector to the world of gambling is a new challenge that will put her skills to the test. Still, she is excited by the opportunity to work for Better Collective, which she considers to be an impressive and very ambitious Danish company.</p>
<p>“At the same time, it has a progressive strategy, which I strongly believe in, so of course I’m really looking forward to being part of the team,” Holbøll added.</p>
<p>She is sure that Better Collective has a bright future ahead of itself, despite the recent hurdles it has faced.</p>
<p>The Danish company scored an impressive three-digit growth of revenue in the third quarter of 2021. Most of it was thanks to the Better Collective’s strategic investments in the US market and the strong season of US sports.</p>
<p>Despite the overall favorable results, the company had a net loss of almost $4 million for that period because of higher expenses.</p>
<p>In other news, the beginning of this month saw Better Collective complete the acquisition of the web-based daily fantasy sports community RotoGrinders Network by buying out the remaining 40% stake in a big $38-million deal.</p>
