<p>QTech Games, the leading iGaming distributor in Asia, has partnered with Reloaded Gaming thanks to which customers will be able to gain access to the latter’s games with QTech’s platform. Together, the two companies are looking to increase their global footprint and progress at a very fast rate.</p>
<p>Reloaded Gaming’s Library Is Mobile-Friendly and Diverse</p>
<p>Customers will be provided with quite a unique gaming experience as all of the games by Reloaded Gaming meet modern standards and are diverse.</p>
<p>As a rising provider, some of the most popular titles by Reloaded include the likes Tomb of RA, Enchanted Berries, Jewel Drop, and Alchemist of Fortune. The library of this provider is packed with classic slots, but also modern picks that have tons of bonus features like multipliers, free spins, cascading reels, Wild symbols, etc.</p>
<p>Additionally, Reloaded Gaming meets modern standards and hence, made sure that all of its games are HTML5-powered or in other words, mobile-friendly.</p>
<p>Reloaded Gaming’s CEO, Robert Skogh, commented on the partnership with QTech and stated that QTech is “a natural habitat” for Reloaded’s tools and games. Skogh added that as Reloaded is expanding its footprint, QTech’s revolutionizing platform provides it with the necessary flexibility to access territories that were previously overlooked.</p>
<p>In terms of new market access, this partnership will allow Reloaded Gaming to step into LatAM, Eastern Europe, and Asia.</p>
<p>Ulf Norder, the CCO at QTech, also shared a few words on the development. He stated that having Reloaded’s content on QTech’s platform is an additional “ringing endorsement.” Norder noted that the game library of Reloaded is innovative and the two companies will together raise the standards and provide players with a unique and localized gaming experience.</p>
<p>QTech’s CCO ended by saying that the company is looking forward to seeing how the new games will perform on a global scale.</p>
<p>QTech Partnered With Big Time Recently</p>
<p>Asia’s top iGaming distributor has been busy in terms of adding more games to its portfolio. Shortly before partnering with Reloaded, QTech partnered with Big Time Gaming, the creator of one of the world’s most popular slot payline mechanics – Megaways.</p>
<p>Thanks to this partnership, QTech gained access to numerous highly reputable titles such as Star Clusters MegaPays, Pirate Pays Megaways, Bonanza MegaPays, Wild Flower, and Danger High Voltage MegaPays.</p>
<p>These games, along with the newly added games by Reloaded Gaming, will provide QTech’s one-stop shop called QTech ONE with far more diversity. QTech ONE is becoming the best solution for operators that are looking to access new territories around the world.</p>
<p>At the time, Norder stated that the partnership with BTG extends QTech’s “sequential pipeline for 2022.” He also added that the reputation of BTG exceeds the company and that QTech is more than happy to be provided with the opportunity to work with a globally renowned brand.</p>
