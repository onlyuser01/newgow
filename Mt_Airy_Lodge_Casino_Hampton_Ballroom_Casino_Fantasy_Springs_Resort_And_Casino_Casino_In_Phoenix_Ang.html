    <h1>Mt Airy Lodge Casino Hampton Ballroom Casino Fantasy Springs Resort And Casino Casino In Phoenix Ang</h1>

<p>I believe its electronically verified. I have submitted documents they asked for too.</p>
<p>My issue is customer service mainly...they make things up. There's no transparency on their site regarding RTPs and RNG audits it's virtually impossible to find your history I mean it's there but spin by spin ten results to a page and super slow loading. Also transparency regarding promotions. I was told I had not met wagering on this 250 k promotion and in fact I did by far. It was a prize draw and I keep getting told different things about when it was drawn and transparency about winners. Also almost all slots and iv tried many on their site will not give you a feature at all or after 2 to 3hundred spins. If you look on trust pilot alone everything I say about promotions spins and bingo is echoed with all their brands. It's unbelievable and they use tricks. They make a promotion available, you deposit and wager. Then it vanishes and the honus of proof is on the player and the customer service blatantly lie or just aren't competent.. .I DONT EXPECT TO WIN or GET RICH. It'd mean to be fun and atleast a little but competitive but definitely fair and transparent and I know they're regulated but there's no information about their rng anywhere or winners. And I know it's chance and don't religiously follow RTPs but so many people are saying the same experience and customers questions are not answered. Entain is so big but since they use lr bought their own software it's crooked in my opinion. I have examples of 3 different topics and occasions where 3 colleagues told me different things about each on. It's theft they take your deposit you wager then they lie unless you're a super sleuth.</p>
