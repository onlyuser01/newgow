<p>888sport, the sports betting brand of 888 Holdings, has been pulled out from New Jersey with immediate effect in anticipation of the launch of SI Sportsbook.</p>
<p>888sport Ceases NJ Operations</p>
<p>The online sports betting product of Gibraltar-based 888 Holdings was taken off the New Jersey market after being operational for more than three years since its launch in September 2018, and the FTSE250-listed group did not provide any reason as to why its sports wagering brand would be no longer available in the Garden State in the message to its players.</p>
<p>888 told its customers that it would honor any existing bets but would not accept new wagers, while available funds at 888sport could either be used to play at 888poker and 888casino or be withdrawn.</p>
<p>The news confirmed expectations that 888 would now focus on its new sports betting product, SI Sportsbook, which was established in partnership with Authentic Brands Group (ABG) and its Sports Illustrated brand. 888 and ABG announced in June an exclusive partnership to develop Sports Illustrated online sports betting and gaming products in the US, including the launch of SI Sportsbook.</p>
<p>SI Sportsbook, a sports betting platform integrated with sports news, analysis and betting information from Sports Illustrated, made its debut in Colorado in September and announced ambitious plans to expand to New Jersey, Indiana and Iowa by the end of the year, with other states slated in the coming years.</p>
<p>888’s Primary Sports Betting Brand</p>
<p>Under the arrangement with ABG, 888 agreed to make SI Sportsbook its primary sports betting brand and to power it with its in-house sports wagering technology and the information that 888sport ceased operations implied SI Sportsbook would soon launch in the state that would immediately become the largest market of the new sports wagering brand.</p>
<p>EGR quoted 888’s US director of business development John Atkinson confirming the reason for the closure of 888sport in the state was the impending launch of SI Sportsbook and the preparations for the brand to go live.</p>
<p>Atkison outlined that since the launch in Colorado, the “differentiated wagering experience” offered by SI Sportsbook which “combines 888’s proprietary technology and one of the most influential sports media” was received “extremely well” and the group’s focus is now the launch of SI Sportsbook in other stated among which New Jersey. He concluded that there would be further details in the coming weeks and months.</p>
<p>Since its debut in The Centennial State, SI Sportsbook entered into several partnership deals, including with Genius Sports to gain access to Genius’ market-leading official data, trading capabilities and data-driven content, and Nuvei Corporation to utilize Nuvei’s Instant Bank Transfer technology and ensure seamless payments.</p>
