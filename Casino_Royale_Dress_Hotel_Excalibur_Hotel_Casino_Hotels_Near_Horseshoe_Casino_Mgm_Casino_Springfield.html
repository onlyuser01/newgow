<p>The appointment comes in the wake of Light &amp; Wonder’s recent acquisition of the remaining public shares of SciPlay</p>
<p>Light &amp; Wonder has enhanced its board of directors with another major appointment. As announced by the company earlier today, the experienced Michael Marchetti, a former SciPlay Corporation director has been added to the board.</p>
<p>According to the announcement, Marchetti will step into the office on January 15, 2024. In his new position, the appointee will leverage his years of experience in the finance and gaming sectors to guide the company.</p>

<p>Prior to his time at SciPlay, Marchetti worked for a variety of financial institutions and gaming companies. His track record notably includes positions at companies such as Merrill Lynch, Electronic Arts, and Buffalo Studios.</p>
<p>In addition to that, Marchetti is also the current chief financial officer of Age of Learning.</p>

<p>Marchetti, who is set to officially join Light &amp; Wonder in a few days, will stand for re-election at the company’s annual meeting later this year. He commented on his new appointment, praising the opportunity to work for Light &amp; Wonder’s board of directors.</p>
<p>According to Marchetti, Light &amp; Wonder is a robust company that he hopes to further enhance, allowing it to deliver more shareholder value.</p>
<p>Light &amp; Wonder is operating from a position of strength, and I look forward to applying my experience and passion for the business, along with my fellow directors, to deliver value to the shareholders of this great company. Michael Marchetti, director, Light &amp; Wonder</p>
<p>Marchetti was welcomed on board by Jamie Odell, Light &amp; Wonder’s executive chairman. Odell said that the Light &amp; Wonder team is excited to be joined by the new appointee, whom he lauded as an experienced individual.</p>
<p>Michael has a wealth of mobile gaming experience and a strong financial background that will help us continue to maximize value for our shareholders. Jamie Odell, executive chairman, Light &amp; Wonder</p>
<p>The appointment of Marchetti comes several weeks after the company named Oliver Chow as its chief financial officer.</p>
