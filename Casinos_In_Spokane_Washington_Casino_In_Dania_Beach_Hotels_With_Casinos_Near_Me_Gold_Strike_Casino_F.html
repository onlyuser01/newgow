    <h1>Casinos In Spokane Washington Casino In Dania Beach Hotels With Casinos Near Me Gold Strike Casino F</h1>

<p>Breaking T&amp;C.</p>
<p>Hello, my name is Dennis!</p>
<p>And heres my story, so 26th Jan i was playing at madmoney casino and lost alot which made me come to decision to self exclude myself and also because i have a gambling disorder.</p>
<p>So the 27th of jan i contacted "madmoney" to go ahead and help me with this and i had read the terms before that it could take up to 24h it does not specify anything else.</p>
<p>(During this time "play responsible") so during this time i put in 100e more and managed to win up to 5000e which i instantly made a withdrawal request and sent i documents for (KYC) and after that i logged of figured my account would be self excluded by the 28th but to my suprise no. So i logged of again and came back by the 29th to see my withdrawal (heres when my addicition kicks in an d i end up loosing all of it) but this is based on a technicality since the operator clearly has breahed it own terms, i took contact with the operator and to my suprise the did not find this being in breach of their terms. Because i did not contact the email adress directly which i thought i did, since its mega misleading on their website. Which clearly states the email adress and then the form Below (so i thought the form is connected to that email) and correct me if im Dumb in this regard see the pictures.</p>
<p>So my dispute is over my 5000e withdrawal which i want refunded, since i dont think they have done their part in withholding their terms/responsible gambling (protecting players with addictions)</p>
<p>their basing their final decision on the "MAY" 24h (infact it took 63h)</p>
