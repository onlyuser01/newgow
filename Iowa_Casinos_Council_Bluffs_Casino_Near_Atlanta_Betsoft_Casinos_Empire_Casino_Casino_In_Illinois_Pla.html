<p>The fast-growing digital entertainment supplier, Playson, announced an important partnership, allowing it to significantly grow its European presence. On Tuesday, the company confirmed it joined forces with the leading platform aggregator, Hub88. Under the terms of the new partnership, Playson agreed to make its content available for Hub88's growing operator network.</p>
<p>Per the latest deal, the iGaming content supplier anticipates engaging with new operators on the Old Continent. This, in turn, can enable the company to reach new players, delivering its thrilling games. Thanks to the new agreement, Playson's games library will go live via Hub88's aggregation platform.</p>
<p>As a result, new operators will be able to access recent hits from the iGaming content provider. Such games include Sherwood Coins: Hold and Win, Jelly Valley, as well as Crystal Land 2, among others.</p>
<p>Ollie Castleman, Hub88's Head, praised the new collaboration in a statement released Tuesday. "Playson has enjoyed an outstanding 2023, launching some of the most memorable slots in the market as well as scooping the industry’s most coveted awards," he explained. Finally, Castleman said: "At Hub88, we want to continue to agree deals with the world’s very best slot suppliers and Playson ticks all the boxes for us."</p>
<p>Blanka Homor, Playson's Sales Director, was similarly delighted. "This integration with Hub88 will ensure Playson’s games get further recognition across some of the most highly-functioning iGaming markets in the world," she revealed. Last but not least, Homor said: "Our powerful portfolio of titles continues to grow to unprecedented levels and this latest agreement will continue to carry us towards our goal of being the world’s leading games provider."</p>
<p>Hub88 has been constantly growing ever since its foundation back in 2017. To date, the company has established partnerships with more than 120 iGaming content suppliers, ensuring extensive offering of quality games.</p>
<p>Currently, Hub88's partners can access engaging titles that offer free spins and lucrative bonuses. This makes the company's aggregation platform suitable for different jurisdictions, appealing to a wide range of players.</p>
<p>Now, the latest deal with Playson further strengthens Hub88's position within the online gambling vertical. In fact, the new partnership comes after Hub88 recently secured a license in Gibraltar.</p>
