    <h1>Vegas Casino Hotels Bit Of Gold Casino Live Blackjack Casino Red Dog Casino No Deposit Bonus Casino</h1>

<p>Been temporarily suspended for "random" review since a month, not received email or message at all, promised to reopen within days. but not opened in over a month. Play casino Bonanza at various casinos, and have lost larger amounts here. Only had winnings corresponding to 1 / 5- 1/10 part of what the same game from the same supplier, at other casinos gives in their random generator. discovers after large losses that the input levels are also different 5, 10, 20 and so on. against 2,4,5,6,8,10,12,14,15,16,18,20,22osv. in others who have the same game. Many years ago, they starred in television commercials about tailor-made programs such as the game Leo, which is a copy of Bonanza. And when these have gaming licenses, I assume the same software, like all other bonanza from the same supplier, at other casinos. But obviously it's not the same program at all. I think it is then the fraud and the gaming inspection accomplices who do not check that everyone has identical programs.</p>
<p>When I ask for support at Leo Vegas, I am immediately blocked, with no info at all.</p>
<p>If now the random generator would now turn my bad luck to the profits that are in turn, I now prevent these in an unpleasant and criminal way of unknowingly blocking me.</p>
<p>Fraud or theft of my legitimate profit percentages that have been content to play them back. Theft almost.</p>
