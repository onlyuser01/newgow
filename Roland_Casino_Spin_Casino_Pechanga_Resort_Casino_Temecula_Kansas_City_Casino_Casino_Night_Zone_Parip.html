    <h1>Roland Casino Spin Casino Pechanga Resort Casino Temecula Kansas City Casino Casino Night Zone Parip</h1>

<p>The dynamic and innovative global B2B betting content provider Pariplay has penned a deal with the Greek gaming tech company Kaizen Gaming. The agreement will boost Pariplay’s influence on the European gambling market.</p>
<p>Pariplay Will Fuel Kaizen’s Offerings</p>
<p>The deal has quickly come into fruition, leading to the implementation of Pariplay’s in-house casino games, developed by the Wizard Games team, to Kaizen’s Greek brand, Stoiximan. However, Pariplay’s reach will extend beyond Greece as Kaizen Gaming will also implement the betting games into its German and Portuguese offerings through its international brand Betano.</p>
<p>Additionally, all of Kaizen’s brands will be provided with Pariplay’s Fusion aggregation platform that has countless titles from numerous iGaming game developers, as well as a strong selection of retention tools and back-office conversion.</p>
<p>The mutually-beneficial deal is expected to fuel the growth of both parties. Kaizen will be armed with a strong portfolio of numerous iGaming titles it can implement in its various markets. Pariplay, on the other hand, will further improve its reputation and gain access to new markets, growing its reach and its renown.</p>
<p>A Mutually Beneficial Deal</p>
<p>Andrew Maclean, the vice president of sales for Pariplay, has spoken about the company’s vision and what this deal means to it. According to him, Pariplay “is never content to stand still” and is always looking to improve its business – something that the deal with Kaizen Gaming achieves perfectly. For Maclean, the Kaizen agreement will allow Pariplay to make “great strides” in markets that are of great importance.</p>
<p>“Kaizen Group is an operator that has great geographical reach within the markets that we are targeting right now,” Maclean noted.</p>
<p>He confidently added that the deal is a “great fit” for everyone involved. Maclean and the whole Pariplay team are looking forward to providing “a wide range of in-house and aggregated content” to Kaizen’s players across the globe, using the renowned Fusion platform.</p>
<p>Pariplay has been working hard on reaching new regions. The company recently continued its moves in North America and the Caribbean.</p>
<p>Dimokratis Papadimos, the RNG casino manager at Kaizen Gaming, revealed that his company is always seeking new ways to deliver a prime iGaming experience to its customers across all markets where Kaizen operates. Therefore, he is delighted to join Pariplay, and by everything, the B2B company has to offer.</p>
<p>Papadimos said that the content that went live in Greece has already sparked engagement, and fans have returned positive feedback. Because of that, Papadimos is excited for the future implementation of Pariplay’s offerings in other regions as well.</p>
<p>Kaizen has been keen on expanding its range of content. The Greek company recently signed a similar deal with the iSoftware provider Wazdan Gaming.</p>
