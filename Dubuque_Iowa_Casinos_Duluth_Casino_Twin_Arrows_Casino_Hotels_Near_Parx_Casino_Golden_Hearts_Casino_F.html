<p>Mohegan Sun in Connecticut is the market partner for FanDuel in Connecticut as the state prepares to launch sports betting.</p>
<p>FanDuel Shapes Connecticut Entry Strategy with Mohegan</p>
<p>FanDuel Group continues to vie for market share in the highly competitive and still developing US sports gambling market. Facing competition from BetMGM and DraftKings, and not least PointsBet, FanDuel is working on new market access deals, with the latest focusing on the state of Connecticut. Through a partnership between the group and Mohegan Gaming &amp; Entertainment (MGE), FanDuel is now on its way to the Constitution State. FanDuel will bring several segments to the state, subject to regulatory approval.</p>
<p>The company is focusing on online sports betting as well as fantasy sports and iGaming products, together with Mohegan Sun in Uncasville, Connecticut. FanDuel is obligated to work with a land-based partner as per the state’s regulatory framework that allows a host of gambling activities to take place on its territory.</p>
<p>Speaking on this occasion, Mohegan Gaming &amp; Entertainment president &amp; CEO Ray Pineault argued that the company was excited to be working with FanDuel on what is a pivotal moment for the state and its own offering. Pineault described FanDuel as “one of the leading sports-tech entertainment companies in the US to bring the brand’s innovative sports betting and iGaming solutions to Mohegan Sun Connecticut.”</p>
<p>Bringing a Diverse Product Portfolio in CT</p>
<p>To get things off the ground, the companies will kick off with a temporary sportsbook located at Mohegan Sun, which should transition to full operations in winter. There will be self-serving kiosks as well as cashiers to assist sports bettors.</p>
<p>“Our partnership is a priority for Mohegan Digital, as we look to grow and enhance our casino, sportsbook, and online operations in Connecticut – and beyond. We’re confident that FanDuel will deliver a best-in-class digital and in-person experience for our loyal guests,” added Pineault.</p>
<p>FanDuel Group president Amy Howe said that partnering with the iconic Mohegan Sun casino was an important step for FanDuel. “We have some incredible plans for the retail space at Mohegan Sun, with the potential to be the largest FanDuel sportsbook in the United States,” Howe added. Connecticut is going to be a key state for the company, the executive concluded.</p>
