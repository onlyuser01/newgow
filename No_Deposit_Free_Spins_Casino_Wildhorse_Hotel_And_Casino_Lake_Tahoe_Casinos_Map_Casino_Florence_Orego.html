    <h1>No Deposit Free Spins Casino Wildhorse Hotel And Casino Lake Tahoe Casinos Map Casino Florence Orego</h1>

<p>BETBY, one of the most innovative sportsbook suppliers and tech companies, has forged a new partnership with STATSCORE, a sports data provider which utilizes powerful algorithms to offer an insightful breakdown of the sports action.</p>
<p>As a result, STATSCORE will offer BETBY access to a number of solutions, including the CupCenter widget which can be implemented directly into the front end of sportsbooks and display a detailed breakdown of soccer action as it happens.</p>
<p>This comes just in time for the World Cup in Qatar and will be an important addition to BETBY’s own offer with clients. BETBY already has a dedicated World Cup page which will have the LivematchPro feature as well. The solution will entertain clients with innovative animations that will rivet people to the action and help them understand games better.</p>
<p>Another perk is the use of the PrematchPro tool, which will focus on pre-game markets, data, and statistics, all proven to have boosted engagement by bringing sports fans all they need to know to make informed decisions. The tool is equipped with everything a sports fan would need to place a smart bet ahead of a given game.</p>
<p>This alliance with STATSCORE definitely aids BETBY in expanding on an ambitious commercial trajectory, as the company has added a number of trusted partners, including BC.GAME, Together Gaming, and Gamingtec.</p>
<p>BETBY product owner Aglaja Geta welcomed this new opportunity and said that the company was delighted to be collaborating with STATSCORE as a trusted and innovative data provider that will elevate the company’s sportsbook offer to the next level. Geta added:</p>
<p>Statistics, and the way that they are represented, are absolutely essential to our customer base, and we cannot wait to see how STATSCORE’s practical solutions are received. BETBY product owner Aglaja Geta</p>
<p>BETBY and STATSCORE are Confident in the Helpfulness of Betting Widgets</p>
<p>STATSCORE CCO Jakub Myszkorowski also welcomed BETBY and the opportunity to work with the company. Myszkorowski confirmed that STATSCORE has been interested in working with BEBTY for a while now.</p>
<p>“We are sure that our world-well-known sports widgets and high-quality sports data will only make BETBY’s offering to their customers even stronger. It comes at a great time as we are starting our cooperation with a set of special products for the tournament in Qatar, including the match platform CupCenter,” he concluded.</p>
