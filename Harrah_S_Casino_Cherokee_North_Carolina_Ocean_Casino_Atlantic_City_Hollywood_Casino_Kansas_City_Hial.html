    <h1>Harrah S Casino Cherokee North Carolina Ocean Casino Atlantic City Hollywood Casino Kansas City Hial</h1>

<p>the proof is in darkme88 email which i can’t access !!! but real don’t need to because prior to making dark mediate. I did the exact same thing I contacted support to make sure if there was any other accounts opened or associated to the casino that they needed to be deleted and removed!!!! I never once a day in the kid any wrongdoing on that!! there’s your proof right there common sense will tell you I did the same thing I did before because they never made any complaint or any issue of it. They actually assist me just like they did before there’s your proof I did the same thing trying to protect the casino security, and as well as mine so that account needed to be deleted because it could possibly be somebody other than me accessing it. That’s the right thing to do and they assisted me on the very first emails, and then I did the same thing again ever wants to indicate that was wrong. I was protecting the security of myself and the casino itself. There was absolutely nothing to gain by deleting those accounts, but actually making my account weaker because of all my previous loyalty I get for the time I’ve spent obviously come on common sense shows that this is ridiculous they prior to this incident couldn’t pay up there were draws to their players and then when I hit big ones in my life, they get away with not paying me and throwing this BS out if they had a problem with it, they should’ve made a point of it in the very first time this was done. This is a fault on theirs. If this was such a bad thing, they need to pay for it because they accepted it, and they accepted it and just because they win they get away with it. No no no no no no that’s wrong wrong wrong you can’t OK something in until ups. It finally hurt you and then go. I’m gonna take that back now if that’s not how that works</p>
