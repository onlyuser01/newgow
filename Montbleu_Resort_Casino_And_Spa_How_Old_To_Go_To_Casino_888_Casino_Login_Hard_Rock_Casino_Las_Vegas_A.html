<p>The newly acquired business will expand Vivid Seats’ operations into the online gaming sector, allowing the platform to utilize its technology capabilities and attract customers by offering them the opportunity to participate in daily fantasy gaming.</p>
<p>“Vivid Seats and Betcha share a mutual commitment to helping fans experience the thrill of live events combined with a new and innovative, yet simple way to play. We could not have found a better partner than Stan and the Vivid Seats team, as we introduce a new gaming experience to millions of Vivid Seats customers.” Hanson Wong, CEO, Betcha Sports</p>
<p>With some unique social elements that allow group play by fans, families and friends and an intuitive user-friendly interface, Betcha Sports is engaging with both the casual and super sports fan, offering them multiple ways to immerse themselves in the action.</p>
