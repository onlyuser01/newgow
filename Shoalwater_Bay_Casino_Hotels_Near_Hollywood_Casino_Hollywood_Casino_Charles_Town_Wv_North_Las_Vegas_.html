<p>The leading specialized payments platform, Paysafe, announced its entry into the regulated sports betting market in Kansas.</p>
<p>Paysafe Continues US Expansion, Enters Kansas</p>
<p>On Monday, the company revealed that it launched its leading online payment services for sportsbooks in the new market. The new launch sees Paysafe extend its long-term payment deals with PointsBet, DraftKings and Caesars, all of which operate in Kansas. The company explained that the three sportsbooks have now tapped into its “best-in-breed payment gateway” that features online depositing via credit and debit cards. What’s more, Paysafe’s partners will benefit from ACH payments for depositing and payouts of players’ winnings. The entry in Kansas marks the 23rd US state where Paysafe offers its services to operators.</p>
<p>“We look forward to using our payment solutions and affiliate marketing technology to help operators in Kansas establish their brands by acquiring new players and retaining them, to also ensure the wider market’s growth.“ Zak Cutler, president of global gaming at Paysafe</p>
<p>Zak Cutler, Paysafe’s president of global gaming, revealed that the company is delighted to expand its reach in North America further by entering the newest US sports betting market in Kansas. He pointed out that the company’s payment solutions technology will help operators solidify their presence in the state. In conclusion, Cutler predicted that Paysafe’s entry into Kansas will also have a positive impact on the regulated market.</p>
<p>Kansas Is the Latest State to Launch Legal Sports Betting</p>
<p>Besides offering its payment services, Paysafe also introduced its Income Access affiliate marketing program for Kansas operators. The innovative software enables operators to track, manage, as well as optimize affiliate programs. The solution is already leveraged by several brands in the state including Caesars Entertainment, Paysafe revealed.</p>
<p>“The move sees Paysafe supporting multiple online sportsbooks in the state with players’ credit and debit card deposits plus ACH payments, while its marketing technology and services provider Income Access is powering the affiliate marketing programs of several Kansas iGaming brands,“ reads a statement released by Paysafe</p>
<p>Kansas is the latest US state to launch legal sports betting. It was back in May when lawmakers in the state legalized the activity, while the market itself launched earlier this month, on September 1. As a result of the launch, sports fans in the state can now place wagers via retail outlets or by using mobile sports betting apps. Without any doubt, the launch of legal sports betting was completed at the perfect time, considering the upcoming kickoff of the 2022 NFL season.</p>
