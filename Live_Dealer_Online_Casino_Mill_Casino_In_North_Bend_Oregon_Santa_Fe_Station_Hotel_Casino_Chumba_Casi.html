    <h1>Live Dealer Online Casino Mill Casino In North Bend Oregon Santa Fe Station Hotel Casino Chumba Casi</h1>

<p>The Spanish multinational gaming group Codere has entered a partnership with the digital payment solutions provider OKTO. The operator seeks to adopt the provider’s mobile-first payments solution in order to allow its customers to play “cashless.”</p>
<p>Codere Adopts Cashless Solutions</p>
<p>As per the agreement, Codere will implement the OKTO Wallet payment app and platform to its gaming machines and its retail betting outlet holdings. This will permit bettors to quickly deposit and withdraw funds without waiting long transfer times. The payment solutions will benefit all of Codere’s players, making it easier for punters to make deposits and withdraw their winnings.</p>
<p>OKTO’s tech will also assist Codere in making sure that its customers are protected by harm – the provider has built-in responsible gambling tools into its application, allowing bettors to regulate their deposits and playtime. Nacho Frade, OKTO’s country manager for Spain, added that cashless solutions tend to be safer as they prevent people’s money from getting easily stolen.</p>
<p>The Operator Aspires to Stay Relevant</p>
<p>Frade spoke on the deal with the esteemed operator, saying that it attests to the effectiveness of OKTO’s digital payment solutions and the “award-winning technology” behind them. He is glad to collaborate with Codere, which it considers to be a leading force in gaming and entertainment.</p>
<p>The manager emphasized that Codere has over forty years of experience and added that OKTO is happy to offer its solutions to such an esteemed operator. Frade is sure that OKTO’s payment tech will be a great addition to the Codere experience.</p>
<p>“OKTO, which is leading the cashless revolution and driving the digital transformation across European gaming, leisure and entertainment sectors, meets Codere users’ demand for a smooth, seamless, digitalized journey.” OKTO country manager for Spain Nacho Frade</p>
<p>Emilio Miranda, the director of operations for Codere Spain, said that Codere always chooses to trust in technology as it always means growth. Miranda acknowledged that the gambling space is becoming increasingly digitalized, meaning that operators who wish to stay competitive should follow the latest innovations.</p>
<p>The director said that he believes that the deal with OKTO comes in a crucial moment as it will allow Codere to “step into the digital, robust cashless era” and expand its business.</p>
<p>Codere is a veteran among operators, boasting four decades of experience. The company is backed by some of the most esteemed names in the industry, including Kaizen Gaming, Sports Information Services, and Parimatch. A month ago Zitro launched its iGaming offerings in the autonomous city of Buenos Aires thanks to its deal with Codere.</p>
