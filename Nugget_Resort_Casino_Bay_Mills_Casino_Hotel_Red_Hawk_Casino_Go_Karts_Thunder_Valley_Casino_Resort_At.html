<p>The gaming company delivering services, solutions and content for lotteries, betting and gambling operators, International Game Technology (IGT), announced it signed a new partnership Tuesday. The company revealed that it joined forces with Dreamscape Companies for the delivery of its leading technology to the Rio Hotel &amp; Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada.</p>
<p>IGT's IGT ADVANTAGE, an innovative casino management system (CMS), is expected to power the venue starting in the fourth quarter of this year. What's more, the venue will benefit from IGT's M5 content delivery solution, allowing it to bring Lucky Coin, as well as Random Riches bonuses that help elevate the experience for the customers.</p>
<p>The Rio Hotel &amp; Casino will also benefit from IGT's Mobile Responder and Mobile Host employee convenience apps that are proven to boost customer service. Last but not least, the venue will tap into IGT's solution that provides efficiencies with self-service jackpot processing called Taxable Accrual, a statement released by IGT reveals.</p>
<p>Ryan Reddy, IGT's Global PM Systems, VLT, Video Poker and Payments, was excited about the collaboration that helps further expand the reach of the company's technology. "In deploying IGT ADVANTAGE, Rio Hotel &amp; Casino will have the resources to offer personalized promotions, real-time rewards and engaging bonuses that will quickly differentiate the casino and build patron loyalty," he said.</p>
<p>In conclusion, Reddy pointed out: "As the gaming industry's most trusted CMS, IGT ADVANTAGE has proven to elevate operations and drive results, especially when paired with leading modules such as M5, Random Riches, Lucky Coin, Mobile Host and Mobile Responder."</p>
<p>Kevin Sweet, Rio Hotel &amp; Casino's Chief Gaming Officer, shared Reddy's excitement and said that the solutions from IGT will help bring new bonuses and service apps that will ensure that the Rio Hotel &amp; Casino delivers supreme experiences for its customers.</p>
<p>"The scalable and modular nature of IGT ADVANTAGE is ideal for our property revitalization efforts and positions us to adapt and evolve our gaming floor and loyalty program over time," explained Sweet in conclusion.</p>
<p>The new collaboration comes on the heels of a similar partnership announced by IGT. Earlier this week, the company revealed it signed a deal with the Santan Mountain Casino in Chandler, Arizona. Per that deal, IGT agreed to power the casino's operations by delivering its leading CMS and Lucky Coin bonus. Also included in the partnership were different games and service apps that are expected to elevate the experiences for Santan Mountain Casino visitors.</p>
