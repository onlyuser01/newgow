    <h1>Miami Casino Hotel Casino Norfolk Va No Deposit Casino Bonus Codes Instant Play Red Rock Casino Rest</h1>

<p>Hi Casino Guru</p>
<p>Back in 2016 I ask to be self excluded from AllBritish casino - a casino under branded "L &amp; L Europe Casino" See Appendix 1, where the chat operator confirms that I am self excluded and no longer have the opportunity to play at others "L &amp; L Europe Casino sites"</p>
<p>In the beginning of November 2020, I happen to come across the casino "Fun Casino", which is also a site under "L &amp; L Europe". Here I register without any problems, and lose 500 euros.</p>
<p>I subsequently complain and they tell me that the reason I had the opportunity to play with them was that I was not marked as a gambling addict from the All British casino. (See Appendix 2) Of course, I do not understand this, as the Chat operator from All British had just told me that I could no longer register with any "L &amp; L Europe" casinos. FunCasino assures me in the same email (appendix 2) that I am now self excluded and that my user is made as a gambling addict. I will not proceed with the case at this time.</p>
<p>At the end of the same month (November 2020) I come across the site Race Casino - also a site L &amp; L Europe site.</p>
<p>Here I can again register without further ado, and lose 450 euros. When I subsequently find out that it is also an L &amp; L Europe site, I get very frustrated and complain to RaceCasino that they have allowed me to gamble despite the fact that I am marked as gambling addicted to their entire brand (see appendix 3)</p>
<p>RaceCasino replies (appendix 4) that the reason they have not blocked me is that my year of birth with them was set to 1981 and at FunCasino to 2002. My real year of birth is 1981.</p>
<p>It must be said that at AllBritish casino, my year of birth was also set to 1981. When FunCasino blocked me, they did not mention anything that my year of birth was not the same with them and All British.</p>
<p>RaceCasino also mentions that my last name does not match 100% as I have written my middle name under last name on their site.</p>
<p>I have had a long conversation with their representative here at Casinomeister, who I wish I could attach to this complaint. You will instead get the link to the conversation. If you can not read it that way, then I would like to send a video of the whole conversation.</p>
<p>https://www.casinomeister.com/forums/conversations/self-exclusion-on-l-l-sites-not-done-properly.1774629/#convMessage-1998761</p>
<p>He maintains that when the year and surname are not 100% the same, then I am not entitled to a refund. This despite the fact that I used the same email address, same phone number, same first name and same credit card at both FunCasino and RaceCasino. I did not use the same credit card and address on AllBritish that I used on the other two sites as there were 4 years in between and in the meantime had moved and had gotten a new credit card.</p>
<p>He tells me, just as I had been told before, that they use surnames and birthdays to block people who have blocked their account due to gambling addiction. In Denmark there are 2-300.000 peoples with the surename "Jensen". Some of those will for sure have the same birthday. If you use birthday and surename as the things to sort gambling addicted players, I think alot of people will be denied to register because they are identical to alot of people.</p>
<p>I also ask him why these are exactly the two things they are blocking, but he never answers. He also never answers why they do not block based on email (as the vast majority of casinos do), phone number, name, country or credit card information. This he also fails to answer. He simply writes that the information must be 100% the same, and then refers to their t / c, which I have subsequently looked through. Here, however, I have been unable to find anything about it.</p>
<p>I do not believe that L &amp; L Europe lives up to what they promised me, already back in 2016, and that I am therefore entitled to a refund of the money I have lost at FunCasino and RaceCasino., A total of 950 Euro.</p>
