    <h1>Seven Feathers Casino Casinos In Oregon Barton S 93 Casino Jackpot Nevada How Much Do Dealers At Cas</h1>

<p>Hello i hope you are doing well. On 3.11.2023 i sent a message to Robert the VIP account manager that i want a bonus to play with without any deposit since i lost a lot and if i dont get one i want to close my account in their casino. Then on 6.11.2023 Robert replied that there is no free bonus that i can get, but did not even acknowledge the fact that i asked to close my account if this is the case. On 7.11.2023 i discovered that my account was still open even after i asked to get my account closed since i did not want to play anymore and this cost me to lose 554e which i would still have if my account got closed like i asked. i thought that since no free bonus was given without deposit, that my account also would be closed like i asked in my message to them.</p>
<p>Their reply to my complaint was this:</p>

<p>Hi Sami,</p>
<p>We have spoken with the account manager and they advised that they replied prior to your message to us confirming that there was no bonus warranted at the time of the review.</p>
<p>In relation to your refund request, we take all bets in good faith and any past losses will not be refunded. Your account is now closed.</p>
<p>Regards, Slotbox Support</p>
<p>Only reason i lost the 554e is because their negligence to close my account or acknowledge the request when i asked so and take no action. They did not even respond to my complaint why my account was never closed or any further action taken when i asked to get my account closed. Robert is by the way the casinos head of account management.</p>
<p>They say they take all bets in good faith in their response email, but what they did not do, was to take my request to close my account in good faith. This reply they gave me does not even make sense. They did not even reply anything to my message for days even after requesting to close my account. Only after i called their Robert the worst VIP manager ever and wished him good luck on casino industry, then he suddenly replies 3-4days after my initial request to close the account if i dont get any free money to play with and even then he just ignored the closure request completely. Clearly he also states that "money needs to come in to the casino first". This guy does everything for money including ignoring account closure requests.</p>
<p>I want to try to resolve this issue here since this casino did not take any action when i wanted to close my account or even acknowledged the reuqest and is refusing to refund 554e net loss after my request to close my account which was completely ignored.</p>
<p>Also looking at how to even file a complaint to their regulator they want first to try to resolve the issue on every other avenue before even trying to file a complaint against a casino. Futhermore looking at reviews and information everywhere on this regulator, almost never they even answer or reply to any player complaints when trying to look for information from sites like Thepogg, askgamblers and here also on casinoguru.</p>
<p>Also very strange this casino is rated this high here when they just pray for vulnerable people to lose their money and ignore account closure requests completely</p>
