<p>Legend of Azteca Slot Review</p>
<p>Are you ready to visit the mystery-packed land of the ancient Aztecs and uncover their most sacred, well-hidden treasures? Legend of Azteca by Nucleus Gaming does a great job of carrying you there in the blink of an eye. The unique video slot title released toward the end of 2021 features a peculiar 5×8 grid showcasing 16 fixed paylines, all ready to collapse only to reveal generous rewards.</p>
<p>If you wish to learn more about this title, read on and explore the theme, gameplay, paytable, special symbols, and bonus games with the help of our expert online slot review for Legend of Azteca.</p>
<p>Theme, Storyline, and Graphics: History Mixed With Mythology</p>
<p>Players with a passion for the captivating ancient history of the people of South America will rejoice in discovering the mix between pure history, mythology, and religion that Nucleus has injected into their game. The action is set in an exotic setting that is hard to resist, with the imagery of a beautiful Aztec temple hosting the colorful gems on the grid, the lush jungle with birds roaming the skies, and an additional temple noticeable to the right, far in the distance.</p>
<p>The open ground surrounding the main temple is also covered in creeping mist that adds more to the overall mysterious mood created by the skilled designers. Instead of the regular reels that players are used to seeing, Legend of Azteca features a large vertical block filled with gems that are seen crashing to the ground only to be replaced by more gems coming from above. The game’s logo is constantly visible to the left of the grid/temple, which is not very common for many of Nucleus Gaming’s titles. As the game unfolds and more valuable stones start to take over the grid one after the other, players can expect to uncover even more exciting gems of the Aztec people for a more rewarding gameplay experience. There aren’t many complex symbols and design elements to keep an eye on, which some players might consider fortunate since they can throw more focus on the actual action on the reels.</p>
<p>Legend of Azteca: Game Symbols and Payouts</p>
<p>The slot’s bets range from size 0.10 to 20 in size, with a maximum possible payout of 250x.</p>
<p>The value of the symbols on the paytable also ranges between 0.06x and 15x. The lowest-paying symbols are represented by the yellow, red, pink, and purple gems. They reward players with payouts of 0.06x for three matching symbols, 0.12x for four symbols, and 0.30x for five symbols.</p>
<p>Blue and turquoise precious stones are the mid-paying symbols with payouts of 0.30x, 0.60x, and 1.20x for three, four, or five matching symbols on the paylines. The high-paying symbols are the green gem with payouts of 0.60x, 1.20x, and 3x for landing three, four, or five-of-a-kind, and white gems with 1.20x, 3x, and 6x payouts for three, four, or five matching symbols. The Wild symbol is represented by the golden Aztec temple which brings players wins between 3x, 6x, and 15x for three, four, or five matching symbols.</p>
<p>Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The game’s animations follow the same line of simplicity as the overall design perfectly complementing the theme. The studio has selected crisp and classy sound effects and a soundtrack that instantly reminds players of authentic pipe music tunes.</p>
<p>Legend of Azteca Gameplay</p>
<p>The game features a bet meter located in the middle of the screen, beneath the grid. There, players need to make use of the available up and down arrows to adjust their bets according to their preferences. The current credit balance of each player is instantly updated after each new spin and transparently displayed at the bottom left.</p>
<p>Autoplay mode is also available. Players can pick their preferred number of automatic spins. This can range between one and 1,000, along with the cost of a single spin. Turbo mode can be accessed under the Options tab on the “i” (Information) page.</p>
<p>The focus is on landing a minimum of three identical symbols in adjacent reels, on the horizontal, from left to right, and from right to left. To get started, players must click the “Spin” button or press the spacebar.</p>
<p>The game also pays simultaneous wins obtained on several lines at a time by adding them together. Once a winning combo pops on the grid, it is instantly removed while the remaining symbols drop down and fill the spaces that have been freed. No fresh symbols are added to the grid.</p>
<p>Once no more wins can be generated, the gem-matching stops, allowing the following spin to be initiated. Provided the grid has no more symbols on it during a single spin, players collect a 5x multiplier on all the wins they obtained during the spin when the grid was cleared. This is added to the 1x base multiplier.</p>
<p>Legend of Azteca: Free Spins</p>
<p>The precious gems are hiding random bonus symbols beneath them. Players need to focus on clearing away the respective stones in order to reveal and collect the five hidden bonus symbols dring just one spin. In return, they are given five free spins. Players can also monitor the state of their progress using the available counter located to the right of the grid. All free spins feature central columns packed with wilds that are guaranteed. When a player manages to fully clear the grid during the free spins round, they are rewarded a bonus multiplier. The value of the multiplier represents 10x the base win in addition to the actual base win.</p>
<p>Final Thoughts</p>
<p>With its simple graphic design and artwork, intriguing Aztec theme with hidden treasures inside ancient temples, and peculiar 5×8 grid display, Legend of Azteca by Nucleus Gaming is definitely an interesting choice that fans of the genre should be looking into. The highly watchable screen and low bet levels and payouts also make the slot suitable for novice players who are not yet ready to take any big risks.</p>
