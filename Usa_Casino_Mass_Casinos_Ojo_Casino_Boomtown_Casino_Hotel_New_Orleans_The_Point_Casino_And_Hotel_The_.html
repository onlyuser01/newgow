<p>The Casino Association of New Jersey (CANJ) has a new boss following the sudden and unexpected departure of Terry Glebocki last month. According to the Press of Atlantic City, Joe Lupo, the president of Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino Atlantic City, will take the reins following his appointment by CANJ members yesterday.</p>
<p>CANJ Taps Lupo to be New President</p>
<p>Glebocki had just been appointed president of the CANJ this past May, bringing industry expertise that she had accumulated as the CEO of Ocean Casino, as well as other executive gaming positions. However, she suddenly resigned from the CANJ and Ocean last month without explanation, leaving a void at both entities. Glebocki had only been the boss of Ocean for two years, but had made a tremendous impact at the property and took it from near-bankruptcy to $25 million in profit during that time.</p>
<p>The CANJ, which is comprised of all nine of Atlantic City’s casino operators, moved quickly to find a replacement, ultimately deciding on Lupo in a meeting yesterday. Having someone back at the helm will allow the CANJ to continue campaigning for the advancement of the casino industry in New Jersey, as well as support the revitalization efforts that have been ongoing for the past several years. One of the primary focuses of the CANJ is to restore Atlantic City and the Boardwalk back to their former glory, an uphill challenge that has to overcome COVID-19, prior city mismanagement and a decline in traffic that has endured for several years.</p>
<p>Lupo Brings Extensive Experience</p>
<p>Lupo has been in the gaming industry for more than 35 years, which will hopefully give him the ability to introduce major initiatives to attract more attention to Atlantic City. He was hired as the president of Hard Rock’s resort in the city in 2018 and, prior to that, had been with the company since 2016, serving as the president of the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino in Tampa, FL. His background also includes over 30 years with Boyd Gaming, including as a senior executive at the Borgata Hotel Casino &amp; Spa in Atlantic City before it was sold to MGM Resorts International in 2016.</p>
<p>Lupo said after it was revealed that he would be the CANJ’s new president, “Terry did a great job as a leader, and we are grateful for her meaningful contributions to the industry. I am prepared to lead the CANJ forward as we work to reinvigorate Atlantic City. Our industry is invested in this community, and we believe with continued hard work and determination, Atlantic City’s best days lie ahead.”</p>
