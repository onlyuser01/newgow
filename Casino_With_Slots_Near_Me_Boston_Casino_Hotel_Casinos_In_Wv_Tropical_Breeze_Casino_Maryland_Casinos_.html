<p>The announcement came on the evening of Friday 12, signaling a positive turn in the ongoing efforts of the union to secure fair wages and improved working conditions for its members</p>
<p>The Culinary Union has successfully negotiated a new five-year contract with the renowned Waldorf Astoria Las Vegas.</p>
<p>Culinary Union Moves Forward with Contract Vote</p>
<p>Although specific details of the agreement were not disclosed, sources suggest that nearly 300 hospitality workers at the Waldorf Astoria, located in the Las Vegas City Center, will benefit from the newly forged contract. The Culinary Union has been actively engaging with major resort and casino operators in the valley, with this deal marking another milestone in their recent successes.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the Culinary Union revealed that the next step involves scheduling a contract ratification vote. While the union has successfully reached agreements with most major resort and casino operators in the area, it still faces challenges with 20 independent operators, nine situated on the Strip and 11 downtown.</p>
<p>Last week, the union members employed by independent operators on the Strip and downtown Las Vegas casinos issued a strike threat, scheduled for 5 am on February 2, if tentative agreements were not reached with their employers before then.</p>
<p>Ted Pappageorge, the Culinary Union’s secretary-treasurer, emphasized the importance of securing equitable agreements for the 7,700 workers employed at these properties, including notable establishments like Trump Hotel Las Vegas, Circus Circus, Sahara Las Vegas, and Golden Nugget.</p>
<p>This looming deadline strategically precedes the Super Bowl scheduled to be held at Allegiant Stadium on February 11, adding an element of urgency to the negotiations.</p>
<p>From Resorts World to Waldorf Astoria, Union Secures Victorious Agreements</p>
<p>The recent victory with Waldorf Astoria showcases the Culinary Union’s determination to champion the cause of fair wages and improved working conditions for all hospitality workers in the city.</p>
<p>As negotiations continue with remaining independent properties, the union’s focus remains on securing favorable terms for its members. The union has already met with several properties this week, but details on the progress are limited.</p>
<p>Scheduled meetings with Westgate and Trump Hotel Las Vegas in the upcoming days indicate that the union is actively pursuing its agenda for equitable contracts across various establishments.</p>
<p>Last year, unionized workers in the hospitality and gaming industry in Las Vegas dedicated seven months to successfully negotiate and secure new five-year gaming contracts with three prominent casino and entertainment companies.</p>
<p>The diligent efforts of the Culinary and Bartenders Unions led to the successful ratification of agreements with Wynn Resorts, MGM Resorts International, and Caesars Entertainment.</p>
