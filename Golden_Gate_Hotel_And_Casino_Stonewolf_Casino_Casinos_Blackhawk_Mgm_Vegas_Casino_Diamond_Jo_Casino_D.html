    <h1>Golden Gate Hotel And Casino Stonewolf Casino Casinos Blackhawk Mgm Vegas Casino Diamond Jo Casino D</h1>

<p>So my fist time depositing in this casino went will with out using any bonus I deposited 40 dollars started play times 10 slot got really lucky like just about half of all the spins I spon paid out good wins I went from 40 dollars to $1500 in less then a hour kept playing cuz it felt like there was no way to lose cuz it was paying so good went from $1500 back down to 400 then back up to 1500 again did this about 5 times to top amount I got was $2200 dollars it just felt like this game would not let me lose but it finally stop paying and just started taking without paying any small wins in between the loses so I decided to stop it at 400 so I didn't lose it all and decided to cash out my wins I was happy.so I went to cash out it was put in pending status they needed to verify who I was and that I'm am of age .so I sent them all the paperwork they needed to verify me and had to wait like 7 to 14 days for them to go though the paperwork and verify me so in the meantime while I was wanting and trying not to go back in and play my winnings I was constantly checking my account to see if the withdraw went though and nothing the next time I tried to log into my account it wouldn't let me I guess the casino closed my account due to Manger decisions and they wouldn't tell me why they closed it they just said Manger decision I was mad cuz they closed my account and confiscated my winning. And there was nothing I could do about it and plus not get a answer why all this happened..so I went on the web to see if I could find help which I did it was here at casino GURU they help people fight there case with a online casino .so I told them whT happen and they took on my case to help me get answers and get to the bottom of what's the he'll is going on with them just closing my account for no good reason. So casino GURU finally got a answer from drake casino and what they said was that I made more then one account with there casino which was not true one bit and I told casino GURU that that is false accusation so casino GURU messaged them back telling them that I denied such allegations cuz I knew for a fact they were not true statements and waited to see what they were going to say about that .so casino GURU finally got a answer back from them saying tha/they have proof that I opened more then one account which again was a complete lie and I would know the truth of that.so casino GURU message me back saying they proof that I opened another account and showed it to casino GURU which I don't know how the he'll that was possible but in the end my account was closed my winning was token from. Me and I was never able to open a account with that casino or there sister branch ever again in my life and when I try to make a account it up for a day or less then closed down fast .when one of there sister branches first closed my account prayers to the investigation which was vip slots they were nice enough to refund my one and only deposit that I already spent in there casino before they close my account which drake casino didn't not refund me anything at all as good faith which is sad to see from casino GURU number one casino that comes up first on there list of best online casino to play at which I got to say is a croke of shit this casino ain't fair neither is there bonuses or their rating. I'm sure this review probably won't get posted do to the real true thing I stated and that's for those to cover there reputation so this was all a bunch of a waste of time I bet we will see.be ware of this casino and half of the other ones out there that control the wins of slot play there's no way I can prove it but as far as the $20000 or more I spent on trying out multiple online casino them cheating the customer is really favoring more in my time of trying of these casinos out even the ones that do pay out didn't have licenses and after they payed out never again do they want to pay out again until you pay back the last winning you withdrawal from them so be careful gambling online or anywhere don't play more then you can afford to lose that's there motiva but one out of very few get lucky .so your better off playing the lottery</p>
