<p>Bubble Bubble 2 review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Bubble Bubble 2 is a witch themed slot with plenty of spooky cartoon-style and more than a little sex appeal thrown in.</p>
<p>If one can forgive the title for being a misquote (the line from Shakespeare is "Double, double, toil and trouble / fire burn and cauldron bubble") and for the egregious punning in the symbols ("The Joy of Hex"), then this is a light-hearted Halloween romp anyone might enjoy.</p>
<p>Think Buffy the Vampire Slayer meets Sabrina.</p>
<p>Win with one of the expanding Wild symbols, witch Winni</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The graphics are excellent. Well drawn, fun spin on sexy halloween costumes. The non-witch characters are all unique and charming. Each one shows a great deal of character.</p>
<p>The animations are a bit underwhelming, not nearly as exciting as the other visuals might suggest.</p>
<p>The music and soundtrack make up for this somewhat, though not entirely. They add some atmosphere and keep things at the lighter end of spooky.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Bubble Bubble 2 is a five reel slot with three rows. There are 50 win lines.</p>
<p>The three bonus options make for some varied play. But on the whole, this is a pretty straightforward game.</p>
<p>There is no gamble feature.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>There are two types of Wild symbols in the base game – Winni, which appears only on reel 1, and Wanda, which appears only on reel 5. These Wilds substitutes for all symbols, including the Scatter symbol, and expand to fill their reel. Wins including a Wild get a x3 multiplier, whereas wins including both Wilds get a x9 multiplier.</p>
<p>Three or more Scatters anywhere on the reel trigger one of three possible bonus features.</p>
<p>The Ultra Bewitched Feature awards 7 free spins in which every spin drops an expanded Wild onto either reel 1 or 5 or both. This happens every single spin.</p>
<p>One of the three bonus features</p>
<p>During the Greater Ghosts Feature, the player is awarded 20 free spins. During the free spins, if the player lands a paying Scatter combo, up to 9 Ghost Wilds are added at random to the reels. These Wilds substitute for all symbols except for the Scatter symbol.</p>
<p>The Wilder Witches Feature is the big kahuna with the potential for enormous wins. In this feature the player is awarded 9 free spins.</p>
<p>During the Free Spins, any witch appearing will cast a spell, turning another reel into all Wilds. If both Witches appear, the middle reel will become Wild, or 33 additional spins will be added to the player's total.</p>
<p>At the end of the Wilder Witches Feature, if the player has won 10-times the player’s bet per spin or less (from the bonus game alone, not counting wins from the triggering spin), they are awarded a bonus prize ranging from 5 to 100-times the bet per spin. If the player has won nothing at all in the bonus feature, they receive 100-times their bet per spin. This is the Realtime Gaming Win-Win Feature.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 94.5%, which is extremely low. Our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.50 up to a maximum of $/£/€12.50 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is high, which would make it a good match for our preferred slot machine strategies if the RTP weren’t so terrible.</p>
<p>Full paytable for Bubble Bubble slot</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Though nice to look at and fun to play, there is very little point booting this game up.</p>
<p>The RTP is so low as to make it far too expensive to play. Even the high volatility can’t make up for that.</p>
<p>We recommend avoiding this one like a haunted house or a black cat.</p>
