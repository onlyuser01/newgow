    <h1>Tahoe Casinos Horseshoe Casino Indiana Hotel Casino Offers Casino Food Casino Indio Kindred to Suppo</h1>

<p>Kindred Group has become the latest company that has chosen not to be impartial to the plight of millions of Ukrainians escaping the illegal invasion of their country by Russia. As a result, the online gambling group is offering refugees a fast-track job application service in a bid to help people get back on their feet.</p>
<p>Ukrainian Refugees May Find a Job in Stockholm</p>
<p>Kindred Group will still focus on drafting from the shortlisted candidates, but Ukrainians and their families will be given a priority. The positions that Kindred is willing to offer are based in its Stockholm office in Sweden. Qualified refugees will be offered a generous relocation package that would help them and their families move to Sweden, which has been supporting Ukraine’s military effort against Russia from the very start.</p>
<p>Kindred Group has noted that jobs are not guaranteed to all of those applying but argued that Ukrainians escaping the war would have a priority in the selection process in a bid to show solidarity with the immense distress people is put through.</p>
<p>The company has already shown willingness to make this happen in the shortest period possible, urging candidates to apply, and commiserated with the plight faced by millions of innocent Ukrainians:</p>
<p>“Aside from the urgent financial support, we believe our best way to help is to provide long-term security and aid by supporting those who have been forced out of their home and stable life, to find new employment and a place to settle for now.”</p>
<p>Kindred Urges People to Apply to Talent Academy, Direct Positions</p>
<p>Kindred has urged Ukrainians impacted by the war to either apply to the Talent Acquisition or look up the company’s career center and apply for a position directly providing they have the correct skill set. The company said that it would be contacting successful candidates about the next steps.</p>
<p>To make sure that the move is worthwhile, Kindred will offer employees both a medical insurance and pension scheme and cover relocation expenses in the form of airfares to Stockholm. In addition, the company is willing to offer SEK 25,000 ($2,600) in additional relocation expenses and enroll employees in English classes.</p>
<p>Companies from the industry have rallied to condemn the invasion and support Ukraine in its humanitarian effort. The gambling Industry for Ukraine managed to raise $333,000 and Stake.com donated $1 million in the form of Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Parimatch, another prominent company in the CIS region, also donated $1 million while also severing any ties with Russia. Clarion Gaming, arguably the biggest event host in the industry, said that it’s temporary suspending the hosting of Russian companies, state entities, or individuals.</p>
