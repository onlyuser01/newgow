<p>Tiki Bonanza review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Tiki Bonanza is themed around a sunny Polenysian holiday.</p>
<p>Players will step out onto a tropical beach and watch as the waves roll in. A variety of colorful tiki masks appear, drawing them into the magic of the island.</p>
<p>Players longing for a warm vacation will especially appreciate this slot’s imagery.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>Tiki Bonanza’s soundtrack is filled with uplifting steel drums and the calls of seagulls. Players will also hear the gentle crash of waves in the distance, making them feel as if their toes will touch saltwater at any moment. Whenever players click spin, the pace of the melody increases, adding excitement to the moment.</p>
<p>The reels are crafted from bamboo and decorated with festive flowers. Players will see brightly hued letters and numbers drawn in a playful cartoon style.</p>
<p>The stars of this slot are the ornate tiki masks that are inspired by the cultures of Polynesia. With expressions ranging from solemn to silly, these masks are illustrated in vivid shades of purple, red, and gold.</p>
<p>Behind the reels, there is a peaceful seaside scene with golden sand, beach chairs, umbrellas, and adorable crabs. Players will either want to go for a swim or take a nap in the warm sunshine.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Tiki Bonanza is a five- reel, three- row slot. In total, there are 3125 ways to win.</p>
<p>The maximum win for Tiki Bonanza is 5,000x the player’s total bet.</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols with the exception of the Free Spins Scatter symbol.</p>
<p>Below every reel, players will see a Lock option that will hold that reel's symbols in place if selected. Players must pay to use this option.</p>
<p>If players land at least 3 Free Spins symbols, a Scatter win will pay out and the Free Spins feature will begin, starting with 10 free spins. The reels will expand to a five- reel, five- row structure.</p>
<p>Whenever a Free Spins symbol lands during the Free Spins feature, players are awarded an additional free spin. Retriggers are unlimited.</p>
<p>If players wish, they may buy directly into the Free Spins feature.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of Tiki Bonanza is 95.63%, below our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.10 up to a maximum of $/£/€200 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of Tiki Bonanza is medium-high. This would make it a moderate match for our recommended strategies if it offered a more favorable RTP. We suggest a strategy of targeting the highest possible volatility when choosing slots.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We do not recommend this low RTP, medium-high volatility tiki culture-themed slot.</p>
<p>Although the beach setting is welcoming, Tiki Bonanza offers an RTP that fails to turn heads. Some players might drop in to try out a bonus feature or two, but those who are mathematically-inclined would do well to keep looking for a game that can offer a more promising RTP in combination with high volatility.</p>
