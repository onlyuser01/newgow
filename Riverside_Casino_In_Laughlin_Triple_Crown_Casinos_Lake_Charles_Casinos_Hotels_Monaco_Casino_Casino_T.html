<p>Rush Street Gaming and Konami Gaming continue to expand their SYNKROS partnership with the addition of Rivers Casino Portsmouth</p>
<p>Rush Street Gaming expanded the scope of Konami Gaming’s SYNKROS casino management system to cover the company’s new world-class casino destination, Rivers Casino Portsmouth, in Portsmouth, Virginia.</p>
<p>Fifth Rivers Casino with SYNKROS</p>
<p>Rush Street Gaming selected the SYNKROS casino management system for its new land-based casino that is set to become the first permanent casino in Virginia when it opens to the public on January 15, 2023. Rivers Casino Portsmouth is set to become the fifth casino for Rush Street Gaming to utilize the SYNKROS system.</p>
<p>Commenting on the announcement, Roy Corby, general manager at Rivers Casino Portsmouth, outlined Konami Gaming’s SYNKROS as the system that is set to power this “state-of-the-art gaming and entertainment complex” that was “built from the ground up” and is “fully equipped for real-time, personalized rewards and loyalty engagement.”</p>
<p>“It equips the property to achieve its immediate and long-term technology goals while ensuring constant operational management across the casino,” Corby added.</p>
<p>Rivers Casino Portsmouth’s 1,448 gaming machines, 57 table games, poker room, sportsbook, restaurant and retail offerings, as well as entertainment venues, will be linked via Konami’s casino management system to deliver seamless rewards, offers, communications and more.</p>
<p>Tim Drehkoff, chief executive officer of Rush Street Gaming, hailed Konami Gaming as the “reliable partner” and its SYNKROS casino management system as the “robust ecosystem” an organization striving “to be a leader in each of its markets” such as Rush Street Gaming should have in place, confident “in the guest experience SYNKROS helps support on the technology front.”</p>
<p>Upon its opening next year, Rivers Casino Portsmouth will take advantage of SYNKROS’ comprehensive marketing suite the casino operator has been utilizing to deliver its Rush Rewards loyalty program across its other casinos under the Rivers brand.</p>
<p>Commitment to Latest Technology</p>
<p>On behalf of Konami Gaming, Tom Jingoli, executive vice president and chief operating officer of the company, outlined the “entrepreneurial commitment to future technology” continually displayed by Rush Street Gaming that is underlying the casino operator’s “strong expansion and leading casino development across major metropolitan markets.”</p>
<p>“Rivers Casino Portsmouth is the latest in a string of successful ground-up Rush Street developments that we’re honored to support with the latest SYNKROS tools and technology,” Jingoli concluded.</p>
<p>The partnership between Rush Street Gaming and Konami Gaming dates back to 2009 when Konami first installed its systems at Rivers Casino Pittsburgh, and then expanded to Rivers Casino Philadelphia, Rivers Casino Des Plaines, Rivers Casino &amp; Resort Schenectady, and now Rivers Casino Portsmouth.</p>
