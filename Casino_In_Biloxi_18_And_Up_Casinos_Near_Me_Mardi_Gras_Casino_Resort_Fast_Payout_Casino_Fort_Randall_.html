    <h1>Casino In Biloxi 18 And Up Casinos Near Me Mardi Gras Casino Resort Fast Payout Casino Fort Randall</h1>

<p>Hey,</p>
<p>I just signed up today to play on ACR. My account name is "c<strong>*</strong>*o". After playing for a few hours, I requested for my account to be permanently banned from the CASINO / LIVE DEALER CASINO via the Live Support Chat. I've been attempting to gain ticket #s or transaction histories of this conversation but I can't find any. I've tried communicating with the Live Support and email support but there hasn't been any progress.</p>
<p>I tried confirming this with the chat multiple times. They even said that it was being processed.</p>
<p>I kept persisting for confirmation.</p>
<p>Immediately after, I had a relapsed to my gambling addiction and proceeded to lose $21,602 in a matter of a few hours. Not once was there even a WARNING or asking for a confirmation after stating multiple times I wanted to be PERMANENTLY SELF BANNED / EXCLUDED.</p>
<p>According to their terms of service, this request is irreversible and takes effect immediately.</p>
<p>I was NOT informed in the chat at any time that I would need to CONFIRM a PERMANENT SELF BAN / SELF EXCLUSION from casino games. I never even was sent a confirmation email like their Terms of Service claims that occurs.</p>
<p>I demand a refund on the lost funds immediately due to the fact that my request to be banned wasn't honored.</p>
<p>This would go an extremely long way to someone that has a very serious gambling problem.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Justin</p>
