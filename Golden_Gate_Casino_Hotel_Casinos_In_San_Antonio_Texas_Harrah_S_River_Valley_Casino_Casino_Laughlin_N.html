<p>Great Rhino Deluxe review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Great Rhino Deluxe takes the player to the plains of Africa in search of wild game.</p>
<p>The reels are decked out in beautiful and majestic wildlife like flamingos, cheetahs, and silver-back gorillas. The background is a wild grassland scene, while Masai ornaments on the borders of the reels suggest that one might meet a friendly local to help you traverse the transvaal.</p>
<p>Just try not to fall victim to the crocodiles and hyenas along the way.</p>
<p>Big win with top paying symbol 7 respin feature</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The visuals for Great Rhino Deluxe fall into a style typical of wildlife themed slots. That is to say they take on the airbrushed mural style used in many animal identification guide books. In this case the style is used well, but people familiar with the genre may feel it is all a little cliched.</p>
<p>Each symbol is animated a little when part of a winning combination. Apart from that, the animations stick to the usual win and spin sequences. These are coupled with sound effects taken from the shared Pragmatic Play soundboard.</p>
<p>However, the soundtrack is enhanced brilliantly with the use of music. The basic soundtrack is an African style percussion tune, with additional elements being brought in while spinning, and still more being brought in for wins and wilds. Another layer of animal sounds round out the atmospheric soundscape.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Great Rhino Deluxe is a five reel slot with three rows and twenty winlines.</p>
<p>The gameplay is pretty standard. There is a Wild symbol, a Scatter symbol that also triggers the bonuses (see below for details), and a fixed jackpot feature.</p>
<p>Though the game has few surprises for the seasoned slot player, it does the familiar things well.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter symbol.</p>
<p>The Scatter pays out two times the player’s bet. Three or more Scatters will also trigger the Free Spin bonus. The player starts with 10 Free Spins.</p>
<p>During the Free Spins, every Rhino symbol that lands is added to a counter. At the end of the Free Spins, all the Rhino symbols on the counter are added to the final reels in random positions and wins are added to the player’s total payout for the Free Spin bonus.</p>
<p>The Rhino symbol is stacked. Whenever two full reels are covered with Rhino symbols, the Super Respin Bonus gets triggered.</p>
<p>Super Respin bonus is awarded if at least two full stacks of Rhino symbol land on reels</p>
<p>During the Super Respin Bonus, the only symbols on the reels are Rhino symbols and blanks. The player begins with three spins. All Rhino symbols are locked in place and the blanks are respun. Each time a new Rhino symbol lands, respins reset to three. All new Rhino symbols have a chance of carrying a x2 multiplier that is applied to any wins at the end of the spins.</p>
<p>When the player is out of spins, the Super Respin Bonus ends. The player gets paid out any wins on the usual win lines. If they landed fourteen Rhino symbols, then the player wins the Major Jackpot (fixed at x375 the player’s bet). If they got fifteen Rhino symbols, they win the Grand Jackpot (fixed at x500 their bet).</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.50%, a fair bit over our yardstick for average of roughly 96%, and pretty much the standard for Pragmatic Play slots.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.20 up to a maximum of $/£/€100.00 per spin.</p>
<p>Full paytable for Great Rhino Deluxe slot machine</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is medium, which makes it a poor match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Great Rhino Deluxe is a pretty solid version of the African safari themed slot. It has nice artwork and decent gameplay mechanics.</p>
<p>We would prefer a higher volatility option overall, but players who don’t mind medium volatility will enjoy the high RTP and pleasant gameplay.</p>
<p>We give this slot a mild recommendation.</p>
