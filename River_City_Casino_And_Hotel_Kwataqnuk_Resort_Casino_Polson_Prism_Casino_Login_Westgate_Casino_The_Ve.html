<p>Xpoint, a leading provider of geolocation and compliance solutions, has received authorization to launch in the state of Ohio, United States. Thanks to the license received by the Ohio Casino Control Commission, the company will be able to provide its services in the Buckeye State.</p>
<p>Geolocation Services Are the Backbone of Sports Betting in the USA</p>
<p>Geolocation technology has been pivotal in ensuring that sports betting remains compliant with existing regulations, much of which is contingent on sportsbooks and iGaming operators being able to prove that any requests placed with their products come within the state borders.</p>
<p>Moving forward, Xpoint will be able to deploy its advanced solutions and help companies on their journey to compliance. Commenting on this, Xpoint CEO Marvin Sanderson said that he was thankful to the commission for recognizing the companyâ€™s product and efforts to deliver a compliant product. He added:</p>
<p>To be licensed to provide our technology solutions in the Buckeye State from the start of legalized sports betting is a huge honor, and we are looking forward to working with multiple partners in Ohio to help them engage with their consumers safely, securely and free from fraud. Xpoint CEO Marvin Sanderson</p>
<p>Ohio is yet to roll out sports betting in the state, but applicants are already vying to make sure that they are among the first to launch such a product. In the days leading up to the launch date on January 1, 2023, the state is likely to experience an influx of pre-registrations and temporary promotional offers.</p>
<p>Ohio to See a Number of Prominent Applicants Enter the Betting Arena</p>
<p>Ohio is actually an outlier insofar as the way it is going to be deploying its sports betting product, as it will also feature leagues and professional teams as some of the purveyors of those products. Among the stakeholders, in the newly-regulated Ohio sports betting markets are prominent sports franchises such as the Cincinnati Bengals and the Cleveland Browns, and not least the Columbus Blue Jackets and the Cleveland Cavaliers.</p>
<p>Caesars Sportsbook has already introduced its mobile betting app available for download in the Buckeye State, well ahead of the timeline. There is also a betting bonus to go hand-in-hand with the launch. The Hall of Fame Resort &amp; Entertainment (HOFV) is another prominent company that has received conditional approval to go live in the state.</p>
