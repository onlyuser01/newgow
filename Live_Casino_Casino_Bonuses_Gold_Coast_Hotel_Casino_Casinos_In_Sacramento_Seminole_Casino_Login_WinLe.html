    <h1>Live Casino Casino Bonuses Gold Coast Hotel Casino Casinos In Sacramento Seminole Casino Login WinLe</h1>

<p>Dear Stefan,</p>
<p>We have reviewed the complaint of player ROGA22 in detail.</p>
<p>Here are the details of the player's account</p>
<p>1) Player deposited his account twice from the prepaid card (10000ARS + 10000ARS) and once from a wallet USDT (4961ARS).</p>
<p>2)Player ROGA22 on 2023-04-20 applied for withdrawal of 24000 ARS to USDT purse.</p>
<p>3) On 2023-04-20 Finance Department requested documents to verify the account.</p>
<p>3) On 2023-04-21 the Risk department requested the player to pass the video verification via Skype according to the paragraph of the rules:</p>
<p>2.5.1 In some cases, Risk WinLegends Casino Department has the right to request video verification from the player via Skype.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the player does not pass the verification procedure by calling Skype at an agreed time with the representative of the Risk Department, the Site Administration reserves the right to cancel all winnings and close the account without the right to recovery.</li>
</ul>
<p>The player has provided all the requested documents to verify the account, but could not pass the video verification, as he does not speak English.</p>
<p>Risk Department of the casino conceded the player and canceled the requirement for mandatory video verification through Skype.</p>
<p>On 2023-04-26, an additional verification of player ROGA22's account was initiated based on suspicious activity on the player's account.</p>
<p>The additional verification was initiated according to the rule item:</p>
<p>2.4.1 The finance department may postpone processing a withdrawal request due to additional verification.</p>
<p>Player ROGA22 was notified about additional verification by e-mail to his e-mail ro<strong>*</strong>ti@gmail.com which he specified when registering his account.</p>
<p>2023-05-22 having studied the history of the client's game Risk Department found the following:</p>
<p>According to the regulations of our casino to withdraw funds the client must make x3 of the deposit amount to be able to withdraw funds.</p>
<p>1) All deposits of player ROGA22 were wagered in Evolution Roulette games with maximum betting returns. (All betting actions were made intentionally to make the deposit turnover x3 according to the rules of our casino), with the difference in bets and losses or winnings did not exceed 10-15% of the balance of the client, and more than 95% of customer bets were made exactly this way.</p>
<p>2) Player ROGA22 made a deposit with a prepaid card and withdrawal of funds requested on the crypto wallet.</p>
<p>We have every reason to assert a violation of AML policy, which grossly violates the regulations of the project.</p>
<p>Based on these findings, the Casino Risk Department has ruled that the player purposefully carried out all actions to launder funds.</p>
<p>According to the rules of our casino:</p>
<ol>
<li>Casino reserves the right to monitor all transactions with a view to prevent money laundering. Furthermore, Casino reserves the right to examine with special attention, and to the extent possible, the background and purpose of any complex or large transactions and any transactions which are particularly likely, by their nature, to be related to money laundering.</li>
</ol>
<p>Betting activity will be monitored for irregular patterns.</p>
<p>2023-05-22 player account ROGA22 was closed without the right to open and the balance was canceled due to violations of the rules of our casino, according to paragraph rules:</p>
<p>14.6. In that case, if we should close your account because of collusion, cheating, fraud, money laundering, other criminal activities, or breach of the Terms of Use, which damaged us or any other third party, the balance of Your Account will be non-refundable and deemed to be forfeited.</p>
<p>2023-05-22 An email was sent to the player with detailed information about the reason for closing his account to his email ro<strong>*</strong>ti@gmail.com.</p>
<p>As you can see all actions in relation to the player's account were performed strictly within the rules of our casino, which are publicly available and are not hidden from anyone.</p>
<p>Best regards.</p>
<p>Winlegends Casino Risk Department.</p>
