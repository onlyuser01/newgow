    <h1>Virginia Beach Casino Green Valley Ranch Resort Spa Casino Casino Jobs Near Me Margaritaville Resort</h1>

<p>Dear Monica and Casino Guru team,</p>
<p>We sincerely regret about the issue that the player Monica experienced, however, we would like to shed the light on the situation that occurred.</p>
<p>The player played in our casino and was lucky to win. We are sincerely happy and congratulate the player on this.</p>
<p>However, we want to draw the player's attention that according to a rule 4.3.5 7BitCasino reserves the right to carry out additional verification procedures for any payout exceeding 0.061 BTC / 1000 EUR / 1000 USD / 1000 AUD / 1000 CAD / 10000 NOK / 68615 RUB / 1000 NZD / 4430 PLN / 27025 CZK / 124000 JPY / 1.96 ETH / 3.79 BCH / 13.41 LTC / 337600 DOG / 1000 USDT.</p>
<p>The player was asked to go through verification, but, unfortunately, she provided us with an incomplete package of the required documents. Moreover, the player was requested to send us a screenshot of the transaction, so we can see a full information - date, time, amount and transaction number to confirm the deposit. Firstly, the player has provided us with the screenshot without a transaction date visible on it. The player really contacted support for help, and we gave her all the information to solve the issue. Finally, the player sent the screenshot with all the data, and the cashout was successful.</p>
<p>We hope that our team didn't inconvenience the player as we helped her throughout the entire situation and eventually reached a consensus.</p>
<p>We thank the player for cooperation and wish a good luck and a pleasant play in the future. Will always be glad to see in our casino.</p>
<p>Kindest regards,</p>
<p>7Bit Casino</p>
