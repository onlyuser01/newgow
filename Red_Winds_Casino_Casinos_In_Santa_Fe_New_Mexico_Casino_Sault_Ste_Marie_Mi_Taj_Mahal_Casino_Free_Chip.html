    <h1>Red Winds Casino Casinos In Santa Fe New Mexico Casino Sault Ste Marie Mi Taj Mahal Casino Free Chip</h1>

<p>In addition to several breaches of contract, my credit was simply deleted. This was also confirmed again by email, so no technical error. This was justified with risk management and a general terms and conditions reference that has nothing to do with it. Both nonsense.</p>
<p>In the wording "We are sorry to inform you that your withdrawal request has been rejected and 17.018 EUR deducted." As a result, my credit was reduced from EUR 18,200 (as of August 1st) to EUR 182 (as of August 2nd), i.e. deleted from my customer account (criminal, criminal offence). Money "disappears" there.</p>
<p>The transfer history only shows a payment of EUR 1,000 rejected by nucleonbet. The approximately EUR 18,000 that have disappeared are not even noted there.</p>
<p>Out of a total of 22,200, EUR 4,000 was paid out (four payments of EUR 1,000). About 18,000 EUR was deleted. The terms and conditions were already violated several times during the payout.</p>
<p>Note: I cannot upload the attachment for the email history. Please pass this on.</p>
