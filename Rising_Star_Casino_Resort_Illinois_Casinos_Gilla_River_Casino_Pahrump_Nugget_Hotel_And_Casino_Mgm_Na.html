    <h1>Rising Star Casino Resort Illinois Casinos Gilla River Casino Pahrump Nugget Hotel And Casino Mgm Na</h1>

<p>Daily Racing Form (DRF) has launched a new online and mobile sports website in the US. At DRF Sports, sports fans will be able to find up-to-date sports betting stats, insights and analysis for every major US sports league, including the NFL, NBA, MLB and NHL, along with college basketball and football coverage and more.</p>
<p>DRF Scales Up Its Offer to Include Sports Betting</p>
<p>DRF is an established provider of premium data and editorial coverage for both horse racing and sports fans in North America, but will now seek to become an authority in detailed and analytical sports betting coverage in all states in the country where the activity is either emerging or has been established.</p>
<p>The company has responded to increasing demand from customers for the introduction of more sports betting-related coverage in the past months, and DRF will be looking to provide additional value to sports fans in the US. Customers who join DRF Sports from September 1 through September 30 will receive free access to an in-depth football betting guide that will provide them with the latest statistics and news to follow.</p>
<p>Commenting on this launch, Sports Information Group CEO Itay Fisher stated, “We are passionate about continuing to grow our sports business and focused on executing our ambitious plans to deliver a world-class, digital sports betting product to sports fans across the US.”</p>
<p>Bringing High-Value Insight into Sports Betting</p>
<p>Fisher is confident that, historically, DRF has been able to provide the best news, analytics and handicapping for sports and horse racing events, all based on data-driven decisions. The company’s expanded offering will now feature online and mobile sports betting resources available right at DRF Sports, with the objective of penetrating every major state in the country that legalizes sports or has an interest in sports gambling.</p>
<p>“Our vision is to replicate the successful business model we have built within the racing community to provide unique betting content alongside a best-in-class sportsbook that will position us to ultimately take bets from every state,” Fisher concluded.</p>
<p>Affinity Interactive chairman James Zenni asserted that this is the first of many exciting developments to follow for the company’s Affinity Interactive platform. The launch of DRF Sports marks a significant milestone for the company, adds Zenni, as DRF Sports is looking to rapidly scale its offer in the coming months.</p>
<p>With sports betting activity booming in the first and fourth quarter in the US, DRF Sports will want to focus on channeling this interest. Part of the B2B and B2C global sports and tech company Sports Information Group, DRF is in a good position to make DRF Sports work with an exclusive focus on the regulated US sports betting market.</p>
