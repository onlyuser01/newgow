<p>Phil Mickelson Back in Pebble Beach Winner’s Circle, Lefty Rewards Bettors Who Took 25/1 Odds</p>

<p>Lefty entered the week at 25/1 odds to win the tournament. The favorite was Dustin Johnson at 5/1. Bettors who took Mickelson were handsomely rewarded. For every $100 wagered, gamblers netted $2,500.</p>
<p>Paul Casey began the week at the same 25/1 mark. And for the first three days of competition, it was the Englishman’s tournament to lose.</p>
<p>After rounds of 69-64-67 on the three courses, Casey began Sunday with a three-shot lead over Mickelson. A hail storm would delay final round action by several hours, which prevented the final group from finishing until Monday morning.</p>
<p>Mickelson was flawless during his final round 65 in which he recorded seven birdies against no bogeys. Casey shot a 1-under par 71 to finish second three shots back.</p>
<p>Mickelson 2019 Odds</p>
<p>Monday marked Lefty’s 44th PGA Tour win, and it comes at the age of 48. He will turn 49-years-old on the Sunday of the 2019 US Open – the only major he hasn’t won in his career. And the third major of the year (the PGA Championship has moved to May for 2019), will again return to Pebble Beach.</p>
<p>Mickelson, however, says the AT&amp;T win doesn’t mean much for the US Open, as the course will presumably be drastically different.</p>
<p>Las Vegas odds on Mickelson in the 2019 majors: Masters 28/1 PGA Championship 40/1 US Open 22/1 The Open 40/1</p>
<p>Though Phil might not think his Pebble Beach victory gives him any better chance of winning the US Open and completing the career Grand Slam, his 22/1 odds almost certainly will only shorten following the victory.</p>
<p>Mickelson, who was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 2012, has enjoyed one of the best careers in golf history. His win at Pebble takes his career earnings past the $90 million mark. The only other player to achieve that is Tiger Woods.</p>
<p>After a nearly five-year winless hiatus that began after winning the 2013 Open Championship – his fifth major — Mickelson returned to the winner’s circle in March of 2018 at the WGC-Mexico Championship. Phil then upset Woods in their one-on-one $9 million sports betting spectacle last fall, and now is again the victor at Pebble.</p>
<p>The 2019 PGA Tour season is much different than in prior years. Along with the PGA Championship moving to May, The PLAYERS Championship has moved to next month.</p>
<p>Masters Update</p>
<p>William Hill, the largest sportsbook in Nevada and now operating in newly liberalized sports betting states, has Justin Rose and Jordan Spieth the co-favorites for the Masters at 11/1.</p>
<p>Three players – Dustin Johnson, Tiger Woods, and Rory McIlroy – trail closely at 12/1. Justin Thomas and Brooks Koepka are next at 14/1.</p>
<p>The Masters is said to be the easiest major to win, as it features the smallest field, and some of the players are long past their prime, as winners are afforded lifetime exemptions into the tournament. Left has won three green jackets.</p>
