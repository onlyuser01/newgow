<p>Dear casino representative,</p>
<p>I would like to point out that what you are saying conflicts with your terms and responsible gambling standards.</p>
<p>Let me provide an example:</p>
<p>In a normal casino, when a player (let's say Will Smith) self-excludes and then attempts to create a new account using the same name and birthdate, that account is put on hold and verification is required. Even in cases where there is a chance of two people having the same name and birthday, verification can determine if it is the excluded Will Smith or just a fortunate coincidence. Triggering verification in such rare cases will not cause any harm, and this is how it works in reputable casinos.</p>
<p>This leads me to question how you protect players when all they need to do is change their email? Then, you blame them for breaching the rules. Players who admit to gambling addiction are essentially saying, "I am not responsible for my actions in your casino, and you need to protect me." I am confident that if these players were to approach the regulator or file a lawsuit, the casino would lose.</p>
<p>It is contradictory to claim that the casino is protecting players while doing nothing to actually protect them. While using the wrong name or birthday may give the casino the right to take action, email, telephone, or physical address can be changed throughout one's life. While this information could be helpful in identifying a possibly excluded player, it should not be the sole basis for making decisions.</p>
<p>All your casino needs is the player's name, surname, and birthdate.</p>
<p>If you are unsure about how to establish your responsible gambling policy and tools, we can offer assistance. However, it is evident that your current approach is incorrect.</p>
