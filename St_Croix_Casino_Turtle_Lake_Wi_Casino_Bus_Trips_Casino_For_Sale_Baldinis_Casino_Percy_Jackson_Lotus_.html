<p>GAMOMAT, a German iGaming supplier dedicated to providing an “outstanding gaming experience for slot fans,” has made a foray into Italy thanks to its agreement with Bragg Gaming Group. This became possible after Bragg Gaming’s local partner was given the green light in the country.</p>
<p>The distributor’s local partner, Microgame, just received approval from the Agenzia delle Dogane e dei Monopoli to launch in the country. As a result, Bragg Gaming can now supply the local brand with games developed by GAMOMAT.</p>
<p>Under the agreement, gamblers in Italy will be able to experience some of the German studio’s best titles. These include games such as La Dolce Vita, Book of Romeo and Julia, Ramses Book and 5 Flaring Fruits. To play any of these games, Italian customers simply have to visit Microgame’s local platform.</p>
<p>With Italy being one of the top markets in Europe, GAMOMAT will be able to expand its presence and reach many new players. The company considers the country to be a key growth market for its business.</p>
<p>Kaufmann Praised the Foray into Italy</p>
<p>Andreas Kaufmann, GAMOMAT’s managing director, commented on the matter. He applauded the growth of online casino gaming in Italy, saying that his team cannot wait to join the market. Kaufmann emphasized that the regulated jurisdictions of Europe are a major part of his company’s growth plan.</p>
<p>Italy’s online casino market continues to perform impressively and we cannot wait that Microgame introduces our games to the local audience. Regulated European markets are a core catalyst for business growth throughout 2023. Andreas Kaufmann, MD, GAMOMAT</p>
<p>Kaufmann joined the German gaming developer in October 2022, bringing years of gaming experience to the company. As a skillful entrepreneur and gaming industry worker, Kaufmann had just the right skill set to help the company grow.</p>
<p>Bragg Gaming Continues to Expand Its Presence</p>
<p>In September 2022, Bragg Gaming also launched GAMOMAT content with Merkur in the Czech Republic. The provider powered the local operator with what it referred to as an “all-in-one platform” that offers real-time data and marketing tools.</p>
<p>In more recent news, Bragg Gaming just launched content in Mexico thanks to a deal with Caliente Interactive. The former company agreed to supply its local partner with both proprietary and exclusive third-party iGaming content. At the time of the deal, Bragg Gaming’s chief executive officer, Yaniv Sherman, called the expansion of the company’s content “another successful step” of the business’ journey to become a top supplier.</p>
<p>In February, Bragg Gaming expanded its US footprint by launching in New Jersey with Caesars.</p>
