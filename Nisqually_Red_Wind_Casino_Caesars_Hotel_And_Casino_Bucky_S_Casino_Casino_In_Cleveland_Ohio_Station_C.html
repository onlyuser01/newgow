<p>Spinomenal, a leading content provider with more than 300 HTML5 games, has struck a new content partnership, the company revealed in a press release. Moving forward, the supplier will assist Luckia, a Spanish operator, provide innovative content and titles to its audiences.</p>
<p>Presently, Luckia operates in multiple markets, including Colombia, Portugal, and not least, Spain. The brand is hailed as a standout operator in the markets, and this places it in a good position to popularize Spinomenal’s games while also bringing local audiences the type of high-quality slot games they are interested in.</p>
<p>The content integration is facilitated by Light &amp; Wonder’s OpenGaming solution, with which Spinomenal has partnered for a while now. As a result, Luckia players will have access to excellent games by the supplier, including Story of Medusa, Book of Rebirth, Book of Demi Gods II, Majestic King, Lucky Jack and many others.</p>
<p>Spinomenal CEO Lior Shvartz has welcomed the opportunity for his company to provide the noteworthy operator with a variety of games, and expand the supplier’s position in existing regulated iGaming markets.</p>
<p>"Our games have something for everyone and we’re looking forward to introducing them to new audiences," Shvartz assured. Luckia Head of Product Eloy Fernandez Martinez was similarly happy with the developments.</p>
<p>According to Martinez, Spinomenal’s track record was well-documented in the industry and the two companies have been able to strike a strong relationship right from the start. "Adding this wide selection of casino titles to our platform heightens our offering across all our key markets," Martinez concluded on an upbeat note about the future of the collaboration.</p>
<p>Spinomenal has been in the meantime looking to expand its reach in Europe actively. The company obtained a license from the Hellenic Gaming Commission, the gambling authority in Greece, back in January.</p>
<p>Similarly, Spinomenal negotiated a content partnership with Lottoland that same month, expanding its reach of iGaming titles once again. Spinomenal continues to be amping up its content production while seeking to secure new avenues where the games can be rolled out.</p>
