<p>Sportradar’s I&amp;I Launches Intelligence and Due Diligence Services in The US</p>
<p>Sportradar’s I&amp;I launched on November 12 its intelligence and due diligence services in the US, providing customers with insights and risk assessments on future investments.</p>
<p>Intelligence For Better Investment Decisions</p>
<p>Sportradar’s Intelligence &amp; Investigation Services (I&amp;I) launched on Thursday a suite of due diligence solutions for US customers.</p>
<p>Sportradar launched I&amp;I, which operates within the Integrity Services division, in 2013. The global team provides intelligence and due diligence services to sports federations, government agencies, law enforcement, sports clubs, anti-doping organizations, and the gaming industry. The world-leading intelligence provider currently supports more than 50 partners, including UEFA and the International Olympic Committee.</p>
<p>I&amp;I offers information on individuals and companies to combat match-fixing, fraud, illegal gambling, money laundering, and regulatory fraud discreetly and strategically. Sports leagues and teams are provided with background checks and information prior to acquisitions, trades, and drafts, as well as the identification of risk sources.</p>
<p>The team collects data through open-source techniques and expert analysts, and therefore supports investors in making better decisions on future investments in the sports and gaming industry. Sportradar’s I&amp;I in-house tools and unique data research also helps to pinpoint the client’s least-secure components.</p>
<p>I&amp;I also assists University athletic departments in protecting their interests, reputation, and trademarks, as well as those of affiliated staff, such as student-athletes and agents.</p>
<p>Sportradar gives its US partners “a competitive advantage when making the most consequential decisions.”, the Director of Business Development, Intelligence &amp; Investigation Services, Donald Dotson, said.</p>
<p>Anti-Online Abuse Service Launched Last August</p>
<p>In August, Sportradar’s I&amp;I launched a sports solution supporting organizations in protecting professional athletes against social media abuse.</p>
<p>Maintaining the integrity of sports and ensuring a safe and enjoyable environment has always been a priority for the company, Andreas Krannich, Managing Director Integrity Services at Sportradar, said.</p>
<p>The service was made available to sports federations, leagues, and governing entities to protect the mental health of athletes by shielding them from online harassment and abuse.</p>
<p>So-called “trolls” and fake accounts are identified and the forms of abuse are analyzed in order to take appropriate action, which can include bans or removal from social media platforms, and working with law enforcement to bring legal action.</p>
<p>Recommendations on Problem Accounts</p>
<p>Sportradar trialed the service earlier this summer at the Exo-Tennis Series, which featured players from the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) and Women’s Tennis Associations (WTA) Tours, including German athlete Dustin Brown and US athletes Taylor Townsend and Sachia Vickery, who all received abusive messages online.</p>
<p>The service provided organizations with a list of recommendations and information about the abusive accounts in order to prevent future trolling and lower the negative impact.</p>
<p>“We believe this safeguarding solution can have a similar positive impact on sport as our Fraud Detection System has had on match-fixing, where we’ve reported more than 5000 suspicious matches across global sport in 11 years.” Andreas Krannich, Sportradar Managing Director Integrity Services</p>
