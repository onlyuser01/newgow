<p>Parleh Media Group has appointed James Sharman as head of soccer content for the affiliate company. Sharman will be heading a number of content and media activities pegged to the soccer coverage for the company, including the Soccer Sports Betting Show, a new project by the media.</p>
<p>Parleh Media and Sharman Work on New Soccer Content Opportunities</p>
<p>Sharman, who is a soccer insider and analyst, will bring his knowledge and opinions to Parleh Media’s readers and viewers and offer advice on what games are worthwhile betting on and why. Sharman will further read into the odds and try to help sports bettors find value betting opportunities.</p>
<p>He will focus on both pre-game and in-play opportunities, making it worthwhile for bettors who choose to follow the Soccer Sports Betting Show. For its part, Parleh Media Group will push the show across its entire brand portfolio as a syndicated asset. Sharman welcomed the opportunity to be working with Parleh Media on this new project and be in charge of the entire soccer content:</p>
<p>“I continue to be amazed by the remarkable growth, and the leadership team’s commitment to producing a large volume of unique, high-quality content. The Parleh platform is incredibly well-positioned as sports media and sports betting continue to converge.” Parleh Media Group head of soccer James Sharman</p>
<p>Sharman will now be contributing to this high-quality content he is speaking of himself. He confirmed that he is looking forward to working with the company. Sharman is no chance addition either. He has worked with a number of prominent sports and media publications over the years, including Fox Sports, Sportsnet, TheScore, and others.</p>
<p>Sharman Knows All about the World of Soccer</p>
<p>He has covered anything soccer-related, from the Olympics to UEFA Champions League, to the FIFA World Cup. Sharman is well-versed in both men’s and women’s soccer and he is able to deliver actionable insights. Parleh Media Group founder and CEO Mark Silver commented on his appointment:</p>
<p>“James’ passion and insights on the game are unmatched. He has an incredible ability to connect with fans on all levels.” Parleh Media Group founder and CEO Mark Silver</p>
<p>Silver is confident that soccer will continue to increase its popularity in the North American market and drive significant results for sports betting operators. Consumer interest is already driving the supply of more insightful soccer productions.</p>
<p>Having Sharman onboard, Silver assured, is the right way for Parleh Media and its partners to move forward in this exciting and highly-promising vertical.</p>
