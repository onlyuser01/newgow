    <h1>Houston Casino Columbus Ohio Casino Jack S Casino Kings Mountain Casino Casino In Niagara 7BitCasino</h1>

<p>Dear Annalisa and Casino Guru team,</p>
<p>We sincerely regret about the issue that the player Annalisa experienced, however, we would like to shed the light on the situation that occurred.</p>
<p>Firstly, the player was lucky in our casino, and she won the funds. Our team congratulates the players on it. We would like to point out that every player needs to pass the verification process for security purposes.</p>
<p>The account verification was requested when the player made an inquiry for a withdrawal of funds. The player was asked to upload the necessary documents and confirm the email. We must emphasize that email confirmation is a very important part of player verification, since it confirms that the player has access to the mail, and therefore to the casino account. Annalisa has really provided us with documents, but she hasn't confirmed the email. We sent a lot of emails asking to confirm the email by clicking on the link that the player received upon registration or by writing to us from her email, so we can confirm in manually. Unfortunately, the player hasn't done it yet.</p>
<p>Dear Annalisa, we kindly ask you to confirm your email for security reasons. We have sent you instructions on how to do it, and we kindly ask you to find our emails and follow it. After that, account verification will be completed.</p>
<p>Dear Annalisa, we sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused, but believe us, we do everything to provide our players with a great service. Hope you will confirm your email and the verification process will be finished.</p>
<p>Hope for your understanding and cooperation!</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>7Bit Casino team</p>
