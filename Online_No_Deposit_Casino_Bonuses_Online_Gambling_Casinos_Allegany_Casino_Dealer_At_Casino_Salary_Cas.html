<p>Footprint Center in Phoenix, Arizona is the place where Jesse Rodriguez and Carlos Cuadras will lock horns in a battle for the vacant WBC World Super Flyweight title. The bout is scheduled for Saturday, February 5.</p>
<p>Oddsmakers see Jesse Rodriguez as the favorite, which is no surprise considering that the 22-year-old American is 14-0 in his professional career. Cuadras, who is 11 years his senior, is 39-4 in his career, with his most recent fight resulting in a loss. It happened last October when his fellow Mexican pugilist, Juan Francisco Estrada, beat him by TKO in the 11th round.</p>
<p>Rodriguez vs Cuadras Odds</p>
<p>All odds are per Barstool as of February 3.</p>
<p>Moneyline</p>

<p>Surging Jesse Rodriguez Looking for 15th Career Win</p>
<p>Knowing that Rodriguez is still undefeated means that he’s a force that should be reckoned with. Still, the odds of -305 do seem suspiciously short. One reason why they could’ve been at least slightly longer is that Rodriguez hasn’t fought a super-flyweight fight since 2018.</p>
<p>The last time he fought in this division, we saw him beat Josue Morales by decision. In fact, most of his super flyweight bouts went the distance.</p>
<p>Another reason why Rodriguez may struggle is that he didn’t have too much time to prepare for the clash with Cuadras. The thing is that he was supposed to fight Fernando Diaz in a title bout for the WBC USNBC flyweight championship.</p>
<p>However, after signing a contract with Eddie Hearn’s promotion (Matchroom Boxing), Rodriguez got to fight a new opponent – Carlos Cuadras.</p>
<p>Cuadras to Take Advantage of His Vast Experience?</p>
<p>Cuadras was supposed to fight Srisaket Sor Rungvisai this Saturday for the WBC super flyweight title. However, the Thai boxer pulled out of the fight and Rodriguez stepped in.</p>
<p>The 33-year-old used to hold the WBC super flyweight title in the past. He won the title in May 2014, and after defending it six times, he finally lost the championship belt in September 2016. Nicaraguan boxer Román González was the one who beat him, thus starting a pretty disappointing period in Cuardas’ career.</p>
<p>Since that fight, he lost three and won three fights. Still, truth be told, he faced some elite pugilists over that period. That said, his run isn’t as bad as it may seem.</p>
<p>Bookmakers don’t think he’s going to get the title back, but the odds of +240 definitely look good. So, if you’re looking for a good betting value, backing Cuadras might be the right thing to do.</p>
<p>Pick: Carlos Cuadras</p>
