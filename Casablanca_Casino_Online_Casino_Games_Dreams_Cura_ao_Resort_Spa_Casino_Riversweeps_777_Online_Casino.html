    <h1>Casablanca Casino Online Casino Games Dreams Cura ao Resort Spa Casino Riversweeps 777 Online Casino</h1>

<p>In an official press release, the company confirmed that it has signed with Entain, William Hill, Betfred, and Paddy Power. As a result, Premier Greyhound Racing will supply those companies and their brands with greyhound racing, forming important commercial ties with some of the industry’s leaders.</p>
<p>Premier Greyhound Racing Brings the Sport to Global Audiences</p>
<p>The partnership was welcomed by Premier Greyhound Racing director Mark Kingston who said that greyhound racing is an important part of the betting industry, and the races are one of the pillars of modern gambling operations. He further welcomed the opportunity to sign with the new partners:</p>
<p>Signing up all major retail bookmakers to take the Premier Greyhound Racing service is therefore the biggest endorsement we could have for the content we will be providing from January 2024. Premier Greyhound Racing director Mark Kingston</p>
<p>In outlining the future, Kingston assured that the company was only interested in driving the very best betting product that was equally aligned with the highest welfare standards for greyhounds. The company hopes that it can reunite all operators and give the sport an additional boost, exporting greyhound racing entertainment worldwide.</p>
<p>For its part, Premier Greyhound Racing will run a busy schedule of races seven days a week, and further offer a variety of opportunities for bettors and fans to explore. The organization will be similarly investing heavily to ensure the welfare of the animals involved and advocate for higher standards among stakeholders.</p>
<p>The company will also benefit from the fact that it’s a joint venture backed by Entain. The organization is still fairly new on the market, having launched on December 1, 2021, and seeking to popularize greyhound racing from the start.</p>
<p>Bettering Welfare, Research, and the Industry as a Whole</p>
<p>There has been solid investment going into the sport as well, with the parent companies contributing more than £2.5 million ($3.10 million) across numerous events and backing the prize pools. Premier Greyhound Racing is firmly committed to also further advancing research on animal welfare and how to improve the overall living and racing conditions for the animals involved in the sport.</p>
<p>The organization clearly supports the already-established welfare strategies and guidelines and is keen to popularize the sport more so that resulting revenue can be leveraged to better the sport as a whole.</p>
