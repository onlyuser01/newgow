    <h1>Ozwin Casino Login California Hotel And Casino Parx Casino Pa Luxor Hotel Casino 888 Casino Review N</h1>

<p>Thank you, Antony181980, for the forwarded emails. Do I understand correctly that the account closure request has not been granted since you had funds inside your account? However, one day later (21.8.2022) your account was blocked in accordance with your request due to gambling addiction, is that correct?</p>
<p>I have checked the general terms and conditions, and this is what I found (here):</p>
<p>"Close a NeedForSpin Account</p>
<p>7.1The account owner can close his account at any time by sending an email to the NeedForSpin support: support@NeedForSpin.com</p>
<p>7.2To return funds on a blocked or closed account, you must contact NeedForSpin support to clarify the details necessary for the refund.</p>
<p>7.3If you want to close your account due to gambling addiction, or your account was blocked by NeedForSpin due to fraudulent activities, you agree to never create a new account on this Website. The Company is not responsible for any losses you may incur after opening a new account. We reserve the right to close an account violating these conditions at any time.</p>
<p>7.4You can close your account only if you do not have funds on the balance and/or there arenâ€™t any withdrawal requests in the course of processing.</p>
<p>7.5If a player closes his casino account due to "problems with gambling" / "loss of self-control over the game" / "gambling addiction", in this case, the player is prohibited from playing on the sites of the casino partners, which are indicated in the license of this casino."</p>
<p>Could you please forward your request for the account closure? have you mentioned the gambling problem straight away, or after being informed that account closure is possible only if there are no funds inside your account? When did you send the first request?</p>
