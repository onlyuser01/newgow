<p>The Jacksonville Jaguars vs. New Orleans Saints is the Thursday Night Football game of Week 7 of the 2023 NFL season. Itâ€™s taking place at Caesars Superdome in New Orleans on October 19</p>
<p>The Jacksonville Jaguars are on a roll with four wins in a row, but what needs to worry them is that they have a very bad record against the New Orleans Saints. Theyâ€™re without a win in the last five Jaguars vs. Saints duels in the NFL, with their most recent win happening in December 2003. Has the time come for that to change?</p>

<p>Jagsâ€™ QB Trevor Lawrence Remains Uncertain for Week 7 TNF Game</p>
<p>When the Week 7 TNF odds were released, Jacksonville was the favorite at some online sportsbooks. Thatâ€™s no surprise given that the Jaguars have been in terrific form in 2023. Theyâ€™re 4-2 overall, with each of their wins happening in the last four gameweeks.</p>
<p>Trevor Lawrence is questionable to return with a knee injury after this play. Hopefully heâ€™s okay pic.twitter.com/YKOI1Z1u39 â€” Bussin' With The Boys (@BussinWTB) October 15, 2023</p>
<p>The reason why the Jaguars vs. Saints moved against Doug Pedersonâ€™s team is that Trevor Lawrence picked up an injury. The Jaguarsâ€™ third-year quarterback sprained his knee last weekend in the game against the Indianapolis Colts, which Lawrenceâ€™s team won 37-20.</p>
<p>Lawrence was pretty good in that game despite the problem with his knee. We saw him go 20-for-30 for 181 yards, two touchdowns, and one interception. The good news for the Jags is that they also did great rushing-wise, with Travis Etienne Jr. scoring two rushing TDs.</p>
<p>The Saints Just Love Playing Against the Jaguars</p>
<p>The New Orleans Saints are 3-3 right now, which isnâ€™t great, especially knowing that they havenâ€™t had too tough a schedule so far. The three teams they lost to are the Green Bay Packers, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and the Houston Texans. None of these teams is much better (if all) than their opponent in the Week 7 TNF game.</p>
<p>The Saints, however, are seen as the betting favorite against the Jaguars. The No. 1 reason is the injury of Trevor Lawrence, but there are a few more reasons. For instance, New Orleansâ€™ best runner Alvin Kamara is back in top shape.</p>
<p>The record setter:</p>
<p>Alvin Kamara runs in for his 73rd career TD â€“ a new #Saints record!</p>
<p>Congrats @A_kamara6! #Saints | ðŸ“º: CBS pic.twitter.com/dZxDea5xR8 â€” New Orleans Saints (@Saints) October 8, 2023</p>
<p>After missing the first three games of the season, Kamara struggled to do much on his comeback. However, he did okay in the last two games. In fact, he even scored his 73rd touchdown in the game against the New England Patriots, thus setting a new franchise record.</p>
<p>Can he score in the TNF game? He can, but it wonâ€™t be easy. The thing is that Jacksonville is one of the best teams in the 2023 NFL when it comes to rush defense.</p>
<p>Jacksonville Jaguars vs. New Orleans Saints Prediction</p>
<p>In our eyes, the Jaguars are the better team, but weâ€™re not certain if they can win on the road with their QB struggling with an injury. Still, even if Lawrence werenâ€™t injured, the Jaguars would still have a difficult job against the Saints on Thursday.</p>
<p>That said, our Jaguars vs. Saints prediction is that this is going to be a very close game, with the winner possibly decided after overtime. Itâ€™s really a coin toss when it comes to whoâ€™s going to win, but if we had to pick one, weâ€™d go with the Jags.</p>
<p>There is, however, one thing weâ€™re almost 100% certain about â€“ the Jaguars vs. Saints game is going to be a low-scoring affair.</p>
<p>Picks: Jacksonville Jaguars +3; under 39 points</p>
