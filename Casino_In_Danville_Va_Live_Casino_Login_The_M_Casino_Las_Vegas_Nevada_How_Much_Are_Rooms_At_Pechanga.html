<p>PointsBet continues with its talent shopping spree eyeing the Canadian market, with the latest addition of Dave Rivers as the new Vice President of Marketing for its Canadian subsidiary.</p>
<p>Canadian Launch Preparations Continue</p>
<p>The appointment of marketing industry veteran Dave Rivers as VP of Marketing at PointsBet Canada is part of the concerted efforts of the Australian-based sports betting operator, looking to establish its presence north of the US border.</p>
<p>It all started in June when PointsBet Canada recruited Nic Sulsky as its new chief commercial officer and tasked him with responsibilities to build an extraordinary leadership team that will facilitate PointsBet expansion strategy into Canada. Dave Rivers will report to CCO Sulsky in his new role.</p>
<p>July saw two high-profile additions to the ranks of PointsBet’s Canadian subsidiary: first, it was Chantal Cipriano, who joined the company as its new Vice President, Legal, Compliance &amp; People, followed shortly by Scott Vanderwel, who was appointed CEO of PointsBet Canada to spearhead operations north of the US border.</p>
<p>Last month, PoinstBet Canada recruited Canadian digital media leader Dale Fallon as its Senior Director of Product. By the end of the month, PointsBet Canada signed a partnership deal with Dailyfaceoff.com and The Nation Network to become the official and exclusive sports betting partner of the ice hockey content specialists.</p>
<p>All Eyes on Rivers</p>
<p>Commenting on the new appointment, Nic Sulsky outlined the high hopes the company is putting on Rivers “to play a key role” in the preparations for the launch of the business, being “one of the smartest and most capable marketers in North America”.</p>
<p>“He’s a leader, a creator, a mentor and community builder. I can’t wait to begin our work together and continue to build-out a company that delivers something completely different for the sports betting public in Canada.” Nic Sulsky, CCO, PointsBet Canada</p>
<p>Dave Rivers, who has spent 18 years serving in several marketing-facing directorial roles at Canadian telecommunications company Bell, is a veteran of the marketing sector, boasting significant experience derived from his previous role, dealing with sponsorship strategy, contract negotiations, activation, and content creation.</p>
<p>In his employment history, Dave Rivers also performed in several senior leadership and ownership positions at start-up businesses from the traveling and marketing industries.</p>
<p>The Canadian sports betting and iGaming market is estimated to be worth over $4.5 billion by 2030, following the passage of Bill C-218 to approve single-event wagering and assuming full legalization of online casino gaming, stirring appetites from established gaming operators south of the border and worldwide.</p>
