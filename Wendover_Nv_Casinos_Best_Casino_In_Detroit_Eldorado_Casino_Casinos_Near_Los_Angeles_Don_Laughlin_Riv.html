<p>Partypoker continues with the $2 million Omaha Series</p>
<p>The Player Panel helps the community be heard</p>
<p>Over 160 events available</p>
<p>Following the rising interest in Omaha tournaments, Partypoker has decided to rev up the total number of such events between April 28 and May 5, allocating $2 million across 160-event special series.</p>
<p>More Omaha Tournaments on Partypoker</p>
<p>The Omaha Series are Partypoker’s latest competitive event addition which features Pot Limit Omaha (PLO) games exclusively. With 160 events across the board and over $2 million in ready prize money, the platform now runs competitions geared for players of any budget, including low, medium, high, and even high rollers.</p>

<p>While Partypoker has been revving up the overall number of Omaha games, with players seeking a time off Texas Hold’em, the company has decided to introduce additional PLO competitive events.</p>
<p>Partypoker Chairman Mike Sexton penned a piece about his own experience with PLO, pointing out to the rather more competitive format of the game and his own somewhat unfortunate experience with it.</p>
<p>While Sexton argued that he was perhaps a less prominent Omaha player than he was a Hold’em one, he still nudged readers to give the tournament series a fair shot:</p>
<p>“The Omaha Series on partypoker promises to be a great series and one that I’m sure you’ll enjoy. My advice is for you to give “the great game” of PLO a try.”</p>
<p>With a flexible entry level, the games are definitely quite the rage on the platform. Tailored to players of any budget size, participation is expected to continue and grow until Sunday, May 5, when the last events of the series will be played.</p>
<p>To participate in the Omaha series will cost you between $11 and $530 with multiple events offering as much as $50,000 in guaranteed cash prizes. The events on April 28 are already down, obviously, so your next best shot is May 5 when the Omaha Series #43-HR: $50K Gtd PLO [PKO] and the Omaha Series #44-HR: $50K Gtd PLO are taking place.</p>
<p>Victory for the Player Panel</p>
<p>Partypoker has promised to include players into its decision process, including the recent elimination of hundreds of bots that had been plaguing games on the platform. It has empowered a Player Panel to sit in on important issues and help community and owners achieve a balance when it comes to games.</p>
<p>There are two more big events coming up on May 5 with a handful of satellites along the way:</p>
<p>Omaha Series #43-HR: $50K Gtd PLO [PKO]</p>
<p>Omaha Series #44-HR: $50K Gtd PLO</p>
<p>The Panel has also been instrumental in helping the community get its way, with the Omaha Series being the latest example of success. Ambassadors like Jason Koon and Ilke Haxton have continued to work in the community’s best interest and they have so far been successful.</p>
