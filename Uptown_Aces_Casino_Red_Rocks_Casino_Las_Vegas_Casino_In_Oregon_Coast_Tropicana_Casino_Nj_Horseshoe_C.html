    <h1>Uptown Aces Casino Red Rocks Casino Las Vegas Casino In Oregon Coast Tropicana Casino Nj Horseshoe C</h1>

<p>Greetings! I ask you to help resolve the dispute that has arisen between me and the Parimatch casino. I am 100% convinced that the actions of the casino to withhold my funds of $2422.0 were illegal.</p>
<p>About everything in order.</p>
<p>On December 22, a chat specialist reported:</p>
<p>"In order to successfully withdraw funds from your gaming account, you need to go through the verification procedure. To do this, please provide the following documents in a letter to support@parimatch.com:</p>
<p>A color photograph of your passport.</p>
<p>A photograph with an open passport in hand. It is necessary to take a picture holding your passport (passport must be valid, open 1 (2/3 pages - if there is a new photo on them) pages) in front of you in such a way that your face and photo in the passport can be clearly seen.</p>
<p>On December 25, I fulfilled the requirements of the casino by sending the necessary documents.</p>
<p>The next day I received a message from the casino with the following content: "For verification, please upload a second photo with a passport in your hands in the best quality, and also add a photo of the document itself on page 1." I sent everything the same day.</p>
<p>On December 29, the casino reported: "For the subsequent verification of gaming activity, please provide a photo of the utility bill in the response email."</p>
<p>After the New Year holidays - on January 09, I sent an electricity bill to the casino for verification.</p>
<p>On January 28, I received a letter from the casino with the following content: "Unfortunately, your gaming account has not passed the verification procedure. Also, funds were debited from your gaming account in accordance with clauses. 80.4 companiesâ€¦". and the casino wrote off $2,422.</p>
<p>I decided that there was an error and sent a message to the casino on January 31st.</p>
<p>Later, on February 01, I sent a letter to the casino with a request to indicate what exactly you are accusing me of, since clause 80.4 of the rules lists 7 offenses. And he asked me to provide evidence of my guilt.</p>
<p>I declare that I have not committed any of the offenses referred to in paragraph 80.4. The documents sent for verification at the casino are real.</p>
<p>The casino did not want to comment on anything and announced the finality of its decision.</p>
<p>As far as I know, the accusations of the casino do not carry legal consequences without providing evidence of my guilt.</p>
<p>I am ready to assist in resolving the dispute that has arisen, and I am also ready to provide any documents confirming the veracity of my words.</p>
<p>Please resolve the dispute and help me get my $2422 back.</p>
