<p>Penn National Gaming Weathers Regional Storms, Posts Record Operating Income</p>

<p>The oldest casino company in Pennsylvania said despite several difficult winter weather events that impacted multiple properties, the group experienced record operating income. Gross revenue came in at $1.28 billion, an increase of $466.5 million.</p>
<p>The surge comes as a result of Penn’s $2.8 billion acquisition of Pinnacle Entertainment, which was formally completed in October.</p>
<p>Harsh winter weather in January and February aside, we were very pleased with our first quarter performance across the portfolio,” Penn National President and COO Jay Snowden told investors.</p>
<p>Penn National’s roots date back to the 1960s when it became licensed to operate a thoroughbred racetrack 17 miles east of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, in Grantville. Today, the company is one of the largest regional casino operators in the US, and a major player in the domestic gaming industry.</p>
<p>By comparison of Penn National’s $1.28 billion in revenue, in Q1 2019 Caesars Entertainment reported $2.12 billion, MGM Resorts $3.2 billion, and Las Vegas Sands $3.65 billion. Penn competitors Boyd Gaming posted $827.3 million, and Eldorado Resorts $627.8 million.</p>
<p>Pinnacle Achievement</p>
<p>Penn National’s purchase of Pinnacle expanded its portfolio to 40 casinos. The company’s $300 million acquisition of the operational rights of the Greektown Casino-Hotel in Detroit took that number to 41 gaming properties in 19 states.</p>
<p>Once the Greektown deal is completed, Penn National will operate more than 50,000 slot machines, 1,200 table games, and 9,400 hotel rooms.</p>
<p>In order to avoid monopoly concerns with the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC), Penn National and Pinnacle arranged a deal to sell four casinos – Ameristar Kansas City and Ameristar St. Charles in Missouri, and the Belterra casinos in Indiana and Ohio – to Boyd Gaming for $575 million.</p>
<p>Penn CEO Tim Wilmott said the company hopes to have its loyalty rewards program implemented across all the former Pinnacle casinos by the end of July.</p>
<p>Wilmott said the company isn’t actively pursuing additional mergers and acquisitions, but conceded that “if the math makes sense for us … we’ll take a look” at potential deals.</p>
<p>Keyed on Keystone State</p>
<p>Though Penn National is expanding across the US, the company is also investing heavily at home with two so-called “mini-casinos” in York and Morgantown, Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Wilmott said $120 million will be spent on Hollywood Casino York, and $110 million on Hollywood Casino Morgantown. Both are expected to open in the second half of 2020.</p>
<p>Penn bid heavily to secure the York area with a winning $50.1 million offer. Public Affairs VP Eric Schippers explained, “It was an investment we felt like we had to make to protect a major market area for our casino (Hollywood Casino Penn National). That cannibalization would have been, in our view, very significant.”</p>
<p>Despite the record operational income, Penn National shares on NASDAQ were down 9.5 percent last week.</p>
