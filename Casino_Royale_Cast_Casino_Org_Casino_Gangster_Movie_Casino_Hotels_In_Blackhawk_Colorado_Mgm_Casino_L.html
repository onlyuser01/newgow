<p>LSU vs. Alabama is arguably the most interesting duel of week 10 of the 2023 season of college football</p>
<p>LSU vs. Alabama a.k.a. Saban Bowl a.k.a. “First Saturday in November” is one of the biggest games in the NCAAF, and it’s been like that for 128 years. The Alabama Crimson Tide leads the all-time series 55-27-5, but it’s the LSU Tigers that won their most recent duel.</p>
<p>This time, however, the LSU vs. Alabama odds are favoring the Crimson Tide. Alabama is a three-point favorite to beat its archrival at the world’s 10th-largest sports stadium. It’s Bryant–Denny Stadium we’re talking about, which is expected to be sold out to the last of its 100,077 seats.</p>

<p>LSU Doing Great Offensively, Bad Defensively</p>
<p>Led by senior quarterback Jayden Daniels, the LSU Tigers offense has been sensational in the 2023 college football season. These guys are averaging 47.37 points per game, which makes LSU’s offense second in the NCAAF. The Tigers are also first in yards per game, which shows how amazing they’ve been when it comes to passing in 2023.</p>
<p>Biggest improvement for #LSU QB Jayden Daniels this year has been his downfield accuracy. Currently leads the FBS in completions of 20+ yards (49).</p>

<p>So, if they’ve been so awesome, why is their record 6-2? It’s because LSU’s defensive team hasn’t been as brilliant. They lost to Florida State and Ole Miss, conceding a total of 100 points combined. What’s interesting is that both of those losses happened on the road.</p>
<p>Should this worry them ahead of their trip to Bryant–Denny Stadium? It definitely should. This goes especially because they have a very poor recent record in the Tigers at Crimson Tide games, losing five of the last seven games in Alabama.</p>
<p>Can Bama’s Defense Stop the Tigers?</p>
<p>The key question ahead of the LSU at Alabama duel on November 4 is whether the Crimson Tide’s defense can stop the Tigers’ offense. ‘Bama has been brilliant defensively this season, conceding just 132 points in eight games. That’s just 16.5 points per game on average.</p>
<p>This is particularly impressive because they’ve already faced some fantastic offenses, most notably Ole Miss whom they kept to only 10 points.</p>
<p>Alabama’s offense hasn’t been as impressive, but they’ve been doing alright, averaging 30.62 points. Quarterback Jalen Milroe has thrown for 13 touchdowns this season, which is only bad if you compare it with Daniels’ 25 TDs for LSU.</p>
<p>Further, the Crimson Tide’s special team players have also been great, particularly kicker Will Reichard who hasn’t missed a kick in an entire year.</p>
<p>LSU vs. Alabama Prediction</p>
<p>The LSU vs. Alabama odds suggest this is going to be a very close game, and we can only agree. The Tigers are great offensively, but not great enough to outsmart the Crimson Tide’s defense. Especially not at Bryant–Denny Stadium. If ‘Bama manages to stop Daniels from recording too many TD’s, we think they’re going to win. In fact, they might even cover the spread.</p>
<p>Picks: Alabama Crimson Tide to win and cover the 3-point spread; under 61 points</p>
