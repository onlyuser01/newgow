<p>Charlotte vs. Los Angeles FC is on the program on Saturday, August 26, which is just three days after the defending MLS champions played a game the last time</p>
<p>Less than 72 hours after destroying the Colorado Rapids 4-0 in Los Angeles, LAFC players are traveling across the United States all the way to North Carolina to try and beat another major underdog. The team in question is Charlotte, which is hosting Sundayâ€™s game at Mercedes-Benz Stadium. This is going to be the first time these two meet there. In their first-ever duel, LAFC won 5-0 at home.</p>

<p>Charlotte Hoping to Upset the MLS Odds</p>
<p>Charlotte FC isnâ€™t doing that great in its second season in the Major League Soccer (MLS). This team is sitting in the 12th position in the East with 26 points (6-8-9). That might not be too bad as these guys still have a chance to challenge for the playoffs, but keep in mind that Inter Miami too wants to get there. And Inter has Messi on the roster.</p>
<p>Plus, Charlotteâ€™s recent run in the MLS does not give its fans much to hope for. This team is without a win in the league since May. The good news, however, is that the boys from North Carolina did okay in the 2023 Leagues Cup, going all the way to the quarterfinals where they got stopped by Inter Miami. The Herons destroyed them 4-0 in that game.</p>
<p>Lionel Messi is inevitable ðŸ¤·</p>
<p>Messi caps off Inter Miami's 4-0 rout over Charlotte FC in the #LeaguesCup quarterfinals with his eighth goal in five games.</p>
<p>He now is in sole lead of the Leagues Cup golden boot race.</p>

<p>Thatâ€™s actually not much of a surprise given that Charlotteâ€™s Achilles heel in 2023 has been its defense. With 40 goals conceded in 23 games, these guys have the worst defense in the entire MLS. And that really needs to worry them ahead of the clash with LAFC which has been in a goal-scoring mood lately. Plus, the last time these two met, Charlotte conceded five goals.</p>
<p>Los Angeles FC Just Canâ€™t Stop Scoring</p>
<p>The reigning champion of the MLS is one of the highest-scoring teams in the 2023 season, with 38 goals scored in 24 games. The best thing, however, is that LAFC has only just started scoring a lot.</p>
<p>In the Leagues Cup, Steve Cherundoloâ€™s men played three games in total, scoring 13 goals along the way. Since the resumption of the 2023 MLS season, theyâ€™ve played one game, and it saw them demolish the Colorado Rapids 4-0.</p>
<p>Whatâ€™s interesting is that LAFCâ€™s scoring leader Denis Bouanga did not score a single goal in that game. He did, however, record two assists, while also having a goal disallowed. That said, itâ€™s only logical to assume heâ€™s going to be very motivated to find the net on Saturday.</p>
<p>Charlotte vs. Los Angeles FC Prediction</p>
<p>Sure, LAFC players might be a bit tired having played a game less than 72 hours ago and having to fly across the entire United States to get to North Carolina. But even tired, theyâ€™re way, way better than those playing for Charlotte.</p>
<p>Pick: Los Angeles FC to win</p>
