    <h1>Ledgends Casino Tropicana Online Casino Best Casino Online Real Money Hobbs Casino Mohegan Sun Casin</h1>

<p>I signed up and received a $200 welcome bonus. I met the playthrough requirement and requested the maximum withdrawal amount $100 leaving $201.65 on the account to cover the bonus amount provided. I had to cancel the first withdrawal because they said they hadn't received the proper verification information (not sure why, it had been submitted). However, I submitted documents again, they were verified and approved and I again made a withdrawal request of $100 (Bitcoin) leaving the original bonus amount in the account. I couldn't find anything in their T&amp;C requiring me to make a deposit on a welcome bonus and have not been told during the many chats I've had that a deposit is required. I spoke with support staff via chat several times and was told repeatedly that it would be 7-10 business days for my withdrawal to be processed and sent to my wallet. On the ninth business day I received a request via email from support requesting a 34-character Bitcoin address. I sent the address I usually use with all casinos not realizing it was more than 34-characters. Not hearing anything for a couple more days I reached out via chat again. It took another day and several chats/support staff to finally find out my error which I then corrected by sending another address with the 34-character requirement. Since then I have had several chats with support, opened multiple tickets (6 total, which they have closed four without resolving) and I finally received an email yesterday from the "payout team" stating that they had sent my info to the "withdrawal team" and they would get back with me (isn't "payout" and "withdrawal" the same thing?). I feel like I'm just getting the runaround. I'm hoping you can reach out to them and they will be prompted to process my withdrawal. The bonus money is still sitting on my account, which makes it impossible to even make a deposit if required, because then I'm mixing pots and that's not allowed plus you have to be below a certain amount to even make a deposit. The current status of my withdrawal is "pending for check". I have attached a few screenshots. One is the last email I received; two that show the withdrawal information and one is a chat stating they were behind due to a large volume of withdrawals. Please reach out to me if you have any questions.</p>
