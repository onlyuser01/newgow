    <h1>Hotels Near Tampa Casino Rush Casino Hard Rock Casino Wheatland Vicksburg Ms Casinos Fitzgeralds Cas</h1>

<p>I have also not received the full 6000 you say was refunded to me, I only received 5872 of that when it was transferred to my bank. I am absolutely not satisfied with any of this at all and feel you and doing everything you possibly can do brush this away and ignore it all … so I will summarise for anyone reading aswel as yourself.</p>
<p>you allowed a second duplicate account to be created after I already self excluded myself with a previous account</p>
<p>the new account had the same details ( minus email address )</p>
<p>I was allowed to deposit a total of £6500 even after verification.</p>
<p>I asked for the deposits back after consulting legal advice</p>
<p>i asked repeatedly for data and details that you had on both of my accounts… you refused to give any details and data to me as you knew this would prove that you allowed a second account ( breach of data protecting act … against the law )</p>
<p>you finally …. After weeks of refusing to, agreed to refund only £6000 back to my account, however only £5872 reached my account. You blamed this on currency conversion rates however I deposited in gbp and played in gbp so no conversion should have been done.</p>
<p>you continue to refuse to give me a refund for the further £500 or the £128 from the first deposit</p>
<p>you continue to refuse to admit fault in this whole mess</p>
<p>you refuse to provide compensation for your failure to protect me and failure to adhere to data protection act by giving me all chat logs and data on my files.</p>
<p>this is 100% all illegal and I warn everyone from ever using your site !!!</p>
