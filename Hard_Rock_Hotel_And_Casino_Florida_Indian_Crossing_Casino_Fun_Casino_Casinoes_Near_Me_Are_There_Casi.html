<p>Sweden’s Gambling Market Inquiry recommends tighter gambling market regulation, including a blanket ban on daytime gambling ads across multiple platforms.</p>
<p>Ban on Daytime Gambling Ads</p>
<p>Amid growing consumer satisfaction with the gambling industry, Sweden finally revealed the results of its comprehensive two-year Gambling Market Inquiry. The results were revealed in a digital press conference hosted by Swedish Minister for Social Security Ardalan Shekarabi and Anna-Lena Sörenson, who spearheaded the inquiry endeavor.</p>
<p>The Gambling Market Inquiry was launched in 2019 with the purpose of investigating and evaluating the country’s current marketing restristrictions and aid Sweden’s re-regulation of the local gambling market. It was supposed to be published back in October, but was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The researchers have concluded that stricter regulation is required and have urged for a number of moves, including a blanket ban on all forms of gamblig advertisements between 6 am and 9 pm. The ban would block the advertisements and marketing of what the Inquiry considers “most risky” games.</p>
<p>Although the details are not clear yet, the ban will very likely apply to the most prominent traditional and digital services, such as TV, radio, podcasts and video-sharing platforms. Sweden is also taking measures to address the impact of black market gambling.</p>
<p>Further Regulatory Measures</p>
<p>The research recommends enhancing Sweden’s prohibition on non-licensed gambling on broadcasting channels. Specifically, it urges for an extension of the ban to all other non-Swedish media and video sharing platforms, which includes giants like Youtube.</p>
<p>The report also calls for a permanent weekly cap of kr5,000 (just under £450) on consumer losses through traditional land-based games. However, gambling games that benefit the public or sponsor good causes should be exempt from the weekly cap, the researchers noted. This would include the national lottery.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the report advises greater clarity to local gambling operators on how to more responsibly deal with consumers. This would be accompanied by what the report refers to as a “law of obligation” on all gambling licenses. This would allow the Swedish Gambling Authority (SGA) to freely request licenses for information about their operations.</p>
<p>Inquiry Draws Criticism</p>
<p>Anna-Lena Sörenson stated that the inquiry touches on many different aspects of gambling regulations and that some of the suggested solutions would require difficult trade-offs.</p>
<p>Ardalan Shekarabi stressed that the proposals prioritize consumer protection and that it would be used to form the basis of the Swedish Government’s gambling re-regulation.</p>
<p>“It is both about shutting out gaming companies that do not have a licence and ensuring that those who operate here with a licence do so in a responsible manner.”, Mr. Shekarabi added.</p>
<p>The report has drawn criticism from the Swedish Trade Association for Online Gambling (BOS). The association believes that the report should have placed a stronger emphasis on pursuing non-licensed operators rather than imposing penalties on licensed companies.</p>
<p>BOS CEO Gustaf Hoffstedt warned that impeding licensed operators’ marketing was a bad move. According to him, removing non-licensed operators from the market would help to create a better and healthier gambling market.</p>
<p>BOS has also recently slammed the government’s plans of extending casino restrictions to June of next year.</p>
