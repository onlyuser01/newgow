<p>The company, which is a leader in the affiliate iGaming and sports betting market, offered a detailed breakdown both of its Q4 and FY2022 results. Some of the highlights enumerated by the company included a revenue increase of 31% in the last three months of the year, driven by online sports betting launches in Maryland.

<p>The company also completed the divestment of its AskGamblers website to Gaming Innovation Group for €45 million ($48 million). Catena confirmed that 90% of its revenue is now driven by regulated markets, which is indicative of the company’s long-term commitment to compliance and determination to eliminate unregulated market exposure. These results were commented on by Catena CEO Michael Daly who said:</p>
<p>The final quarter of 2022 was strong for Catena Media as we recorded a 15 percent increase in revenue to EUR 27.4m, along with growth of 14 percent in adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations. Catena CEO Michael Daly</p>
<p>The update also highlighted the 2022 launches of New York and Louisiana and the early launch of Ohio in 2023, giving Catena a strong overall foothold in the market. Looking closer at the results between October and December 2022, the company reported revenue of €27.4 million ($29.20 million), up 15%. Revenue in North America specifically reached €21.5 million ($22,90 million), contributing 78% of the group’s revenue and up by 31%.</p>
