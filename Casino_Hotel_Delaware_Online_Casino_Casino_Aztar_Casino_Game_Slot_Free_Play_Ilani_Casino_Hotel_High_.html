<p>High 5 Games has continued to expand in Pennsylvania, one of the biggest iGaming states in the United States. The company acquired its supplier license in the summer of 2022 and has been committed to growing its footprint ever since.</p>
<p>High 5 Games originally introduced its content with BetRivers and PlaySugarHouse in Pennsylvania and is now scaling up with BetMGM, a leading iGaming brand in the United States. The development was shared with Casino Guru News via email.</p>
<p>The latest partnership allows High 5 Games to make further inroads into the regulated online casino market. Commenting on this fresh opportunity with BetMGM, High 5 Games CEO Tony Singer said that the company is happy to continue strengthening its position in the regulated gambling market in the state.</p>
<p>He said that so far, the performance indicators have been reassuring, adding that players have responded positively to the games that High 5 Games has to offer them in the Keystone State. One of the highlight features of the offer is its Rapid Rewards product, ensuring that players get access to even more promotional materials as part of their High 5 Games gameplay journey.</p>
<p>"We can’t wait to roll out more of our content in Pennsylvania and expand with BetMGM as they move into new markets," Singer concluded. High 5 Games and BetMGM have been collaborating in other states as well. The companies teamed up for a launch in New Jersey with the BetMGM Casino brand, but also Borgata Casino and Party Casino’s gaming website.</p>
<p>This has enabled players to experience popular options such as Platinum Goddess, Triple Double Da Vinci Diamonds, and Green Machine Deluxe among many others options. High 5 Games is also happy with the partnership as it marks its fourth state in which it has been building up a strong presence in the iGaming segment.</p>
<p>Other places of interest include Pennsylvania, Michigan, Ontario, and New Jersey. In all four states, High 5 Games and BetMGM are partners.</p>
