<p>Information about CashtoCode casinos</p>
<p>CashtoCode is a payment service operated by UK company Funanga AG that allows consumers to buy online products and services with cash.</p>
<p>Hundreds of websites accept the service, including CashtoCode online casinos. Read on to find out how to make CashtoCode deposits, the pros and cons of this method, how to find the best Cashtocode casino, and the bonuses offered by them.</p>

<p>CashtoCode: a discreet and secure service for UK customers</p>
<p>The story of CashtoCode goes back to 2013, when a team of payment industry professionals launched a start-up called Funanga AG. They wanted to make it easier for consumers to integrate cash with e-commerce and CashtoCode was the product of this.</p>
<p>The concept was simple. Online merchants would be connected to real-world retail outlets where the customer could go and pay for the e-product or service. The key was the 'code', or the barcode, which the customer would get from the website on their mobile device to take to the outlet. It was a win-win: for the customer, who preferred the anonymity of cash, and the merchants who increased their consumer base.</p>
<p>Today there are over 100,000 retail locations that accept CashtoCode as the service has enjoyed huge popularity among its European customer base. Users can type their location into a search box on their website and find a list of the nearest stores that accept it.</p>
<p>Although cash is declining as a payment method, it's possible that there'll always be a market for this type of service as people often prefer a 'discreet' option, as the website calls it. With this in mind, CashtoCode might see the scope to expand its operations in the near future.</p>
<p>The pros and cons of CashtoCode</p>
<p>CashtoCode's big selling point is the fact that users don't need to share any bank details: they just need cash in hand and a way of getting to the nearest store. It allows a degree of privacy that traditional card methods don't allow, with no transaction details appearing on a bank statement, and is also as secure as paying in cash.</p>
<p>It also offers an instant service, or at least however long it takes to get to the retail outlet. Once the user has the barcode on their mobile, or printout, then they simply need to get the attendant to scan it and the money arrives with the merchant instantly. This is potentially much quicker than a bank transfer and some card payments.</p>
<p>CashtoCode's payment limit, £250 at the time of writing in June 2021, could be a problem for people who wish to deposit large amounts, though. While there's nothing stopping someone from simply printing out multiple barcodes, repeating the process ten times to make a £2,500 payment, for example, would be very tedious. You might also find that the retail outlet wouldn't accept so many transactions at once.</p>
<p>The service is also only available in certain countries, so if you're located outside of these then you'll have to choose another payment method, for now.</p>
<p>And, of course, if you want to make online transactions without leaving your house, then perhaps CashtoCode isn't the best method for you!</p>
<p>How to use CashtoCode in an online casino</p>
<p>Making a CashtoCode casino deposit is easy. You just have to follow a few simple steps to get your cash into your chosen casino account – make sure the account is fully open and set up, though, before trying anything.</p>
<p>To start, go to your casino's cashier and choose CashtoCode on the list of payment methods. Here, it'll ask you how much money you wish to deposit before giving you a unique barcode.</p>
<p>Next, take this barcode to your nearest CashtoCode store, found using the website locator, and ask the attendant to scan it. You then hand over the deposit amount in cash, at which point the transaction is complete and the money is instantly put into your casino account.</p>
<p>Note: the code is only valid for seven days, so make sure you do it in that time.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you won't be able to withdraw using CashtoCode as this would involve the casino somehow sending the retail outlet cash to give you. Instead, you should look for an alternative method to take money out.</p>
