<p>NOVOMATIC Digital Gaming and Entertainment's division, Greentube, announced a share acquisition. The company revealed Tuesday it acquired a controlling share in Alteatec, a leading iGaming management system provider.</p>
<p>By acquiring a majority stake in Alteatec, Greentube will benefit from leveraging Olympus One, the company's leading iGaming management solution and technology. This unique technology is expected to benefit Greentube's business-to-business operations.</p>
<p>The leading iGaming management solution Olympus One is one of Alteatec's core products. The unique solution consists of an innovative system that provides gamification options such as Duel Tournaments and Bonus Engines. At the same time, the solution connects the land-based casino sector with the online vertical. This unique process is achieved via cutting-edge "Land-based Connection and Partner" modules.</p>
<p>What's more, the majority share acquisition is expected to boost Greentube's position as a leading iGaming industry content supplier. This is because the company will enhance its award-winning portfolio by adding live dealer voiceover and streaming technology from Alteatec.</p>
<p>In a statement released on January 17, 2023, Alteatec's Managing Director, Christian Sael, acknowledged that the company is excited to join forces with Greentube, which is a globally-recognized operator within the iGaming vertical. "We're all incredibly excited about this partnership and we can't wait to get to work, delivering all the services we're recognized for in order to help the company grow," said Sael in conclusion.</p>
<p>According to Greentube, the terms of the acquisition see the company's CEO, Thomas Graf, and its COO, Georg Gubo, join Alteatec as Managing Directors. They will collaborate with Sael who currently holds the position of Managing Director at the company.</p>
<p>The acquisition of a majority of shares in Alteatec comes after only recently, Greentube introduced its leading advanced tech stack solution called Mynt. The new solution makes the delivery of games for the company's partners easier. According to Greentube, Mynt is also "future-proof" and will quickly solidify its leadership position within the industry.</p>
<p>Focusing on the latest collaboration, Greentube's COO, Georg Gubo, said: "It's incredibly satisfying watching the business grow, especially when weâ€™re bringing in some of the best talent from around the world via this acquisition." He pointed out that Alteatec's leading technology enables Greentube to increase its output and reach a new level of growth.</p>
<p>Thomas Graf, Greentube's CEO, was also excited about the acquisition saying that the collaboration marks a strong start to the year. Last but not least, he said: "Alteatec is a market leader in iGaming technology and being able to utilize its talented and experienced team is going to be game changing for Greentube going forward."</p>
