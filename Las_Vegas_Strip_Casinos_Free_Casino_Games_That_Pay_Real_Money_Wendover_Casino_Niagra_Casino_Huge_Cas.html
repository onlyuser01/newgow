    <h1>Las Vegas Strip Casinos Free Casino Games That Pay Real Money Wendover Casino Niagra Casino Huge Cas</h1>

<p>Hello everyone, more than a complaint, it is a warning for everyone. On Snai's homepage it is advertised that They give € 15 to the registration by sending the CI document to the online portal, well it is NOT true. Briefly, I am writing why. So after registering and sending a copy of the documents you will receive an email telling you that within 5 days you will be credited with € 5 (as a welcome bonus) to use on sports betting, I entered their online site and tried to open at least one Twenty (20) of slots and I was unable to open one. Either they stop on "loading" or a "connection failed" message comes out. So I write to their chat (and honestly I never knew who I was writing with, neither name nor reference number), however I explain to them that I can't access the slots and even more I can't use the welcome bonuses. The point is this: They give you € 5 within 5 days from registration; € 5 to try on the slots called "blue casino" and € 5 to be used as a test on the "Green Slots" but ONLY AFTER you have made the first top-up to be put on your gaming account. But how.....???? WERE NOT € 15 WITHOUT DEPOSIT ..... ???? After 36 hours I was annoyed to continue trying to open only one slot and I sent him a letter via email to withdraw from the contract.</p>
<p>SNAI is better off dealing with sports betting, slots are not for them. I sincerely hope for them that they have closed my Account and Game Account as I requested, otherwise it will become a dormant account for the next 36 months.</p>
<p>A tip ..... If you like Slots, forget about SNAI.</p>
