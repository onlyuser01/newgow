<p>Global sports betting, gaming and interactive entertainment group Entain announced during its second annual sustainability and ESG showcase event the launch of a new initiative aimed at empowering more women to build a career in the technology sector.</p>
<p>Collaboration to Bring Greater Diversity</p>
<p>The new Drive for Diversity initiative will see Entain collaborate with McLaren Racing, focusing on how to provide more opportunities for women to enter and succeed in technology-related fields. The gambling group and the racing team will be aligning their efforts to drive greater diversity in Science, Tech, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM).</p>
<p>Speaking at the event hosted by Entain, director of People Experience at McLaren Racing Rebecca Constable explained that Drive for Diversity would be for those who want to succeed but are being overlooked by the companies as they “have no idea how to get in,” giving them great opportunities to achieve their goals.</p>
<p>The focus of the initiative will be women who are willing to reskill or upskill and enter technology industries for the first time, those who are looking to re-enter technology sectors after a career break, as well as women students at university or in further education currently studying STEM-based subjects.</p>
<p>Internships at McLaren’s Technology Centre</p>
<p>The Drive for Diversity program begins by launching an inspirational event at McLaren’s Technology Centre in Woking, UK, and will see a series of new initiatives and ventures piloted over one year, providing an initial tranche of ten internship places for six-month periods to offer candidates a taste of what working at technology centers means.</p>
<p>Entain and McLaren initially joined forces in May last year, when the racing team placed the logos of the gambling group’s brands Party Casino and PartyPoker on its F1 cars. Later on, their collaboration extended into several other promotions, one of which saw Entain launch exclusive content for McLaren.</p>
<p>The latest diversity initiative announced by Entain builds on the group’s broader EnTrain program which was created to bring education and training in technology and improve diversity in the sector, as Entain committed to positively impacting the lives of over 1 million people worldwide by 2030, either directly or indirectly via their families and dependents.</p>
<p>The new initiative was announced at Entain’s second annual sustainability and ESG event during which the global gambling brand praised its new Advanced Responsibility &amp; Care (ARC) program as the most effective problem gambling monitoring system that has proven its value in helping many Entain customers get their problem gambling behavior under control.</p>
