<p>Global supplier of sports betting solutions IGT has struck a new deal with the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians for retail sports betting solutions in North Dakota.</p>
<p>IGT and Turtle Mountain Indians Team up for Sports Betting Solutions</p>
<p>International Game Technology (IGT) is expanding its clout in the United States pushing with a retail sports betting solution in North Dakota.</p>
<p>As per a new partnership negotiated with the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians, the renowned software provider will roll out its dedicated PlaySports wagering solution to the Grand Treasure Casino in Trenton and Sky Dancer Casino and Resort in Belcourt.</p>
<p>The offer will be complemented by self-service kiosks and allow trading services to extend sports betting offers to customers in what is a pivotal move for the company.</p>
<p>Commenting on these developments, Jamie Azure, Turtle Mountain’s chairman, said that the tribal operator would be able to bring a best-in-class experience and flexible self-serving products to sports bettors. He further added:</p>
<p>“The addition of sports betting will expand our casino entertainment and offer our loyal patrons and sports fans alike new ways to play.”</p>
<p>A statement was released by IGT PlayDigital’s SVP, Enrico Drago, who added that, entering North Dakota has been an important step forward and a landmark event:</p>
<p>“Entering North Dakota is another significant milestone to add to IGT’s growing sports betting pedigree and reinforces our leadership as the principal B2B platform provider in the US.”</p>
<p>While sports betting in North Dakota can definitely expand further and beyond the control of tribal casinos, there has been no significant progress in trying to pass mobile wagering or introducing commercial sportsbooks.</p>
<p>North Dakota’s Flirtation with Commercial Casinos and Sports Betting</p>
<p>Previously, House Bill 1254 was defeated in Senate. The bill sought to classify sports betting as a game of chance and allow the creation of commercial casinos as a counterweight to the existing network of tribal operators. North Dakota presently doesn’t allow any commercial casinos. In honesty, the bill had to make two appearances in the House before it could proceed to the Senate, pointing to its divisive nature overall.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, IGT is convinced in the success of its own technology. PlayDigital has already been used in the majority of states where sports betting is actually legal. That includes a long list with names such as Nevada, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Iowa, West Virginia, and others.</p>
<p>IGT has borne the brunt of the COVID-19 pandemic and suspension of sports, registering a 48.4% drop in revenue year-over-year (YOY). The second quarter saw IGT post a $279.6 million loss.</p>
<p>Naturally, the gambling vendor has not been the only company to struggle. COVID-19 has impacted North Dakota tribes as well, forcing them to reconsider their reopening plans on multiple occasions.</p>
<p>The state’s gambling tax income also took a tumble, with tribal operators not able to operate and squeezing casino revenues. North Dakota, though, is continuing to introduce improvements to its betting and gaming landscape.</p>
