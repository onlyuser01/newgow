<p>FanDuel Group, the leading US sportsbook, announced Thursday that it launched its services in Wyoming.</p>
<p>America’s #1 Sportsbook Launches Its App in Wyoming</p>
<p>FanDuel, America’s #1 sportsbook, expanded its presence further by launching its application in another US state. This marks the 15th US state where the company’s sportsbook application is available. Besides Wyoming, FanDuel Sportsbook is already available in key markets such as New Jersey, Tennessee, New York, Illinois, Virginia and Indiana. Moreover, currently, FanDuel Group has more than 17 million customers and has a presence in 50 states.</p>
<p>Thanks to the launch in Wyoming, sports fans in the state will now be able to enjoy FanDuel’s best-in-class online sports betting experience. Residents in the state can now place wagers on basketball, baseball and college football. Additionally, sports fans can place bets on soccer, tennis, hockey, boxing and MMA.</p>
<p>Wyoming legalized sports betting in April 2021. It wasn’t long until the state launched the activity which happened on September 1, 2021. By entering Wyoming, FanDuel became the third legal online sportsbook in the state. On the other hand, sportsbooks that have already entered Wyoming are DraftKings and BetMGM.</p>
<p>Considering that FanDuel is a leader when it comes to responsible play, there will be a variety of responsible gaming tools available for sports fans in Wyoming. Such tools include deposit limits, betting limits and maximum wager size limits. Additionally, sports bettors can set time limits, which allows them to restrict the number of hours they spent on FanDuel apps.</p>
<p>Last but not least, FanDuel Sportsbook offers self-exclusion options. Players that want to use that option can self-exclude from gaming on all FanDuel websites. Such bettors are also offered a free Gamban subscription that blocks them from accessing thousands of gambling websites.</p>
<p>The recent launch in Wyoming comes after only recently, FanDuel released details regarding a new responsible gambling campaign just in time for the Problem Gambling Awareness Month. The new campaign, dubbed “The System” promotes healthy and responsible gambling.</p>
<p>Sports Bettors in Wyoming Can Enjoy Unique App Features</p>
<p>FanDuel’s Sportsbook application in Wyoming is available for both Android and iOS and it supports multiple payment methods. Moreover, the application is easy to use and offers key features such as Same Game Parlay Plus. This is an innovative way for parlay bets that allows players to combine bets from one game with bets from other games.</p>
<p>The application offers secure payment methods and lightning-fast payouts. What is more, FanDuel Sportsbook offers 24/7 customer service and features a special online betting guide. Sports fans that are interested can use the guide and learn valuable insights which will help them have a smoother betting experience.</p>
