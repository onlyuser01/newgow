<p>NeoGames S.A. is expanding its reach in the United States through a new content partnership with BetMGM Casino in Michigan. The partnership will provide the renowned American gaming and betting brand with access to a number of excellent iGaming solutions, and NeoGames is experienced in both iLottery and online casino products.</p>
<p>Michigan Players to Benefit from NeoGames Hit Titles</p>
<p>NeoGames CEO Moti Malul has welcomed the partnership and said that this represented a fantastic growth opportunity for the company in the United States, which is quickly becoming a focal point of all iGaming supplier’s efforts.</p>
<p>Not being part of the American market in the next year or so would put suppliers in a difficult spot and this is precisely why NeoGames is expanding its reach in the market. Malul said:</p>
<p>We have had a fantastic growth journey in the US. With the addition of Michigan and the alliance with BetMGM, we further our growth. Our localized content is well-liked by their customers and making our debut in Michigan is a great moment for us as we look to further grow our presence in North America by bringing great excitement and entertainment to slot players. NeoGames CEO Moti Malul</p>
<p>To deploy this outstanding content, NeoGames will use its studio Wizard Games, which has already been able to drive forays into the North American market. It is adding titles such as Spirit of Mustang and Wolf Riches to BetMGM and the Great Lakes State’s iGaming audiences.</p>
<p>Wizard Games Is an Established Studio in the US</p>
<p>Wizard Games previously signed similar content partnerships through NeoGames with BetMGM in New Jersey and West Virginia, both states with an established track record when it comes to online casino and interactive gaming content.</p>
<p>Wizard Games is also an established and powerful content provider with more than 120 titles that focus on innovative and fresh concepts that elevate the gambling experience. Wizard Games is now available in 20 regulated markets across Latin America, Europe, and now North America. The company is fully committed to continuing and deliver products that respond to and follow player preferences in each jurisdiction they focus on.</p>
