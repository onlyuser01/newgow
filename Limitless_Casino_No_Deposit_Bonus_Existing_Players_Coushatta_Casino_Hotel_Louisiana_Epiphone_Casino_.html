<p>DraftKings, a major casino, sports betting and daily fantasy company, has inked a partnership with BetBlocker, a leading responsible gaming charity. As the charity’s partner, the operator will promote its proven solution and urge problem bettors to seek help.</p>
<p>DraftKings to Promote BetBlocker’s Software</p>
<p>DraftKings has committed to propagating safer gambling and will spread awareness of BetBlocker’s superior tools. By using them, users can gain insights into their playtime and spending habits, notice concerning patterns and get their gambling under control. Those who experience gambling harm are able to limit their playtime or exclude themselves from gambling as a whole.</p>
<p>BetBlocker originates from the United Kingdom and offers proven solutions. Most importantly, the charity’s software is completely free, allowing all gamblers who wish to play safely to get their habits under control. Therefore, layers can download BetBlocker for free and remain excluded when they want. In addition, they can remain anonymous and avoid the stigma associated with gambling harm since the software doesn’t store player information.</p>
<p>BetBlocker’s exclusion options cover thousands of gambling sites – even those that aren’t regulated. Additionally, users can freely choose the length of their self-exclusion. Alternatively, they can use the calendar to pick certain days on which they do not wish to play.</p>
<p>BetBlocker Praised DraftKings Commitment to Safer Gambling</p>
<p>Christine Thurmond, senior director of responsible gaming for DraftKings, spoke about the partnership. She lauded BetBlocker for its contributions to safer gambling and said that her company is happy to team up with the charity.</p>
<p>Thurmond also added that BetBlocker and DraftKings share the same vision for safer play as both realize the importance of tech and innovation to that end. DraftKings is happy that BetBlocker will expand its presence in North America and promote responsible gambling in the region.</p>
<p>Pedro Romero, the chief of safer gambling partnerships for BetBlocker also commented on the partnership. He said that his team is glad to receive the support of a company as influential as DraftKings. Romero said that BetBlocker has been impressed by DraftKings’ leadership and the company’s commitment to safer gambling and sustainability. Because of that, he is thankful for their collaboration and is working forward to working with the company.</p>
<p>In addition, Romero encouraged other gambling companies to follow DraftKings’ example. He argued operators should put more effort into helping people make informed decisions and bet responsibly.</p>
<p>BetBlocker isn’t the only responsible gambling body to recognize DraftKings’ contributions. In like manner, the Connecticut Council on Problem Gambling recently praised the operator for taking safer gambling seriously.</p>
