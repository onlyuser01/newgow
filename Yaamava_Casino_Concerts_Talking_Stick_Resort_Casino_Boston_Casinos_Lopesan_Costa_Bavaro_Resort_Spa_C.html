<p>The new printing technology is expected to become central to Scientific Games' expansion plan in the instant scratch games</p>
<p>The world’s largest creator, manager and producer of instant scratch games, Scientific Games, announced today it has experimented with a new lottery product printing technology at the company’s headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia.</p>
<p>Industry-First Printing Technology</p>
<p>As the industry-first, the advanced lottery instant scratch game printing technology debuted by Scientific Games is seen as key to the next phase of the company’s instant game manufacturing expansion plan, capable of providing partner lotteries with products featuring a holographic-like effect.</p>
<p>John Schultz, president of Americas and Global Instant Products at Scientific Games, highlighted the leading role “in specialty and HD digital printing technology” the company plays for lotteries in the Americas and globally.</p>
<p>“Our global teams adopt trends from inside and outside the industry, exploring what’s next, using analytics, and testing new products with player research groups,” Schultz continued, adamant that the company would continue “to advance game innovation” through its “long-term technology expansion plan” to enable its lottery partners to offer their players the most exciting scratch play experiences in the industry and drive sustainable revenues for lottery good-cause funding.”</p>
<p>First developed by the company’s innovation teams in Leeds in the UK, for use by its lottery partners in Europe, the Dimension technology produces holographic-like patterns on instant scratch games, such as the popular Cracked Ice and Stella and the newest three-dimensional Scientific Games-exclusive Spheric Lens, with additional patterns coming down the pipeline in the near future.</p>
<p>Debut with Three State Lotteries</p>
<p>Officially operating, the new North American Dimension technology will get implemented with the Colorado Lottery, New Mexico Lottery and South Carolina Education Lottery this spring and summer to bring the first Dimension games to players in the US.</p>
<p>Scientific Games leveraged all its player research and testing resources, cross-continental teams of designers, printing technology experts, product managers and market analysts to perfect the Dimension product samples, while taking into account the lotteries’ preferences for different types of games, including families of games, holiday and games dedicated on special occasions.</p>
<p>In recent years, the company has increased its global capacity to produce instant scratch games across all its five games production facilities worldwide by investing tens of millions of dollars and reached an annual production capacity of more than 53 billion instant scratch game tickets.</p>
<p>As the world’s largest producer of instant scratch games with a 70% share of global retail sales, Scientific Games is the preferred supplier of 130 lottery operators across 50 countries, delivering digital and retail games, technology, analytics and services.</p>
<p>In 2023, Scientific Games teamed with Lotería Nacional de Beneficencia de El Salvador to provide the national lottery operator of El Salvador with new titles and enhance its instant scratch game catalog, and then signed an agreement with Optimotive focused on providing data and insights to lotteries in five US states.</p>
