    <h1>Rivers Casino Des Plaines Illinois Choctaw Casino Concerts 2023 Aquarius Casino Laughlin Free Play C</h1>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>I was allowed to bet on betfair despite being on gamstop for over a year and having a problem with gambling.</p>
<p>Despite betfair allowing me to deposit and deposit and deposit even after manually verifying my account 5 times.I have screenshots of all chat with betfair where I sent documents proving who I was numerous times yet they still allowed me to deposit.</p>
<p>I can send statements of all amounts deposited to them sometimes minutes apart starting at £100,£100,£100 etc etc etc every few minutes for hours to £500, £500, £500 etc etc every few minutes.</p>
<p>I even had a £15k win in this time in which I had to prove identity numerous times before they allowed me to withdraw some and then allowed me to put it all back in and loose it! I am not even trying to claim this "win" back I just want my account total losses refunding.</p>
<p>I have complained to betfair, IBAS and to UKGC, betfair refused to refund me, IBAS refused to get involved and UKGc said they were not responsible for decisions of refunds.</p>
<p>81019022- Betfair account number</p>
<p>RPCN-661- Esclation number to ibas</p>
<p>I have attached some of the screenshots with betfair and some of my deposits, there is lots more!! Please let me know if you require more.</p>
<p>This saga has caused a massive blow to my already poor mental health in which I have contemplated suicide on numerous occasions.</p>
<p>I have an addiction to there services which I tried to avoid by joining gamstop and I was still left massively vulnerable. I just want my losses back, not my wins as well meaning the casino wouldn’t have lost anything but neither would I!!</p>
<p>Please help.</p>
<p>I look forward to hearing back from you.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely</p>
<p>Niall G<strong>*</strong></p>
