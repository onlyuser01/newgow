<p>The Mexican Apertura 2023 commences on Friday, June 30, and Club America vs. Juarez is the first match of the 2023-24 Liga MX</p>
<p>Not only is Club America vs. Juarez the game that kicks off the 2023-24 Liga MX season, but it’s also one of the most exciting matchups of the first round of the Apertura.</p>
<p>The game is taking place at the country’s biggest stadium, Estadio Azteca, which is where Club America hasn’t won in competitive games in almost three months. The good news for Mexico’s most popular soccer club is that its opponent Juarez is without a win at that stadium in more than three years.</p>

<p>Moneyline Odds Club America -278 Draw +350 Juarez +650</p>
<p>Goals Total Odds Over 2.5 -161 Under 2.5 +125</p>
<p>*Odds taken from bet365 on Monday, June 26, 2023.</p>

<p>High Hopes for Club America in the Apertura</p>
<p>Club America is the most popular, but also the richest club in Mexico. The value of its roster in the 2023 Liga MX Apertura is exactly three times that of Juarez. Two midfielders Alvaro Fidalgo and Diego Valdes are the most expensive players of “Las Aguilas.” The No. 3 on the rich list is Jonathan Rodriguez, a striker who’ll miss the June 30 game due to injury.</p>
<p>Another problem is that Henry Martin is out in the US with the Mexico national soccer team. The team captain is one of the best Mexican strikers in 2023. He was the top scorer of the Liga MX in last season’s Clausura (regular season) while finishing second on the scoring leaders’ list in the Apertura.</p>
<p>In addition to Martin, another two Club America players will miss the season opener due to national team duties – defender Israel Reyes and goalkeeper Luis Malagon.</p>
<p>Juarez Hoping to End Its 4+ Months Long Winless Streak</p>
<p>Last season was horrible for Juarez. This team finished third from the bottom in the Clausura, winning just three of the 17 games. The worst thing is that the last of those wins happened in early February.</p>
<p>Their main problem last season was their anemic offense. Their average was 1.0 goals per game. It may not seem too bad, but Club America’s players were averaging more than two times as many.</p>
<p>Further, Juarez players were horrible on the road last season, winning just one of their nine away matches, and scoring under one goal per game on average.</p>
<p>Club America vs. Juarez Prediction</p>
<p>Club America plays at Mexico’s largest stadium, and you can be sure that Estadio Azteca is going to be packed on Friday evening. Las Aquilas owe it to their fans to show up against Juarez. After all, they haven’t won at home since April.</p>
<p>Of course, pleasing their supporters is just one on a long list of reasons why they’re going to be fired up in the 2023-24 Liga MX opener. They want to start the Apertura with a win, which would give them a major confidence boost for the tougher games that are coming their way in the near future.</p>
<p>Pick: Club America to win</p>
