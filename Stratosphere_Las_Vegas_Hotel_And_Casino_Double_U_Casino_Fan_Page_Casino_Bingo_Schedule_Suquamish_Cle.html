<p>Kiron Interactive, one of the longest-standing companies that develop market-leading virtual sports and games, has signed a new partnership with Holland Casino Online, the companies shared in a press release.</p>
<p>As a result, the supplier’s games and content are now live with the prominent Dutch iGaming brand, and players have access to flagship products such as Goal, Horse, Motor Racing, Keno, and Lucky Loot among others.</p>
<p>Commenting on this opportunity, Kiron Co-CEO Steven Spartinos said that the Netherlands was an important market for the company with a clearly-established online market and the perfect opportunity for companies such as Kiron to put forward their quality games and introduce them to new audiences.</p>
<p>"Holland Casino Online is the leading name in the market and we couldn’t have wished for a more appropriate partner to continue our growth within an exciting region," Spartinos explained.</p>
<p>Holland Casino is a state-owned operator in the Netherlands which has been the de facto monopoly on land-based gaming in the country. The company has also been able to successfully build up its position in the regulated iGaming market, which is equally if not more important to a brand’s success in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>Holland Casino Online Manager Nicolas Fleiderman welcomed the opportunity on a good note. Fleiderman said that Holland Casino Online was touted as the "go-to" provider of iGaming entertainment and as such, it had to constantly scale and improve its offer, which is where Kiron and the company’s award-winning products came in.</p>
<p>"We’re delighted to see its content go live and we’re sure our players are going to appreciate the added value it offers," Fleiderman concluded. Holland Casino Online has indeed been building up its presence in the iGaming world at a steadfast pace.</p>
<p>The company has been adding new games, including by the likes of NetEnt, one of the most prominent slot developers worldwide. As to Kiron, the company was awarded a supplier license in Greece, allowing it to scale its offer once again in the European iGaming market.</p>
