<p>How to Get Started at Chumba Casino</p>
<p>Chumba Casino makes the onboarding process very simple and straightforward. All players need to do is follow the steps outlined in the Create Account process, which will usually take only a few moments to complete. Chumba Casino will not expect you to provide extensive background information, although you still need to confirm your account via email.</p>
<p>You may access and play the casino on both your desktop and mobile devices and alternate between those freely and at your own leisure. The only small thing to notice here is that smartphones usually have to play in landscape mode.</p>
<p>Chumba Casino Welcome Bonus</p>
<p>Chumba Casino makes the onboarding experience all sorts of fun. You get to start with either a First Purchase Offer, which features 10,000,000 Gold Coins and 30 Free Sweeps Coins for just $10. Normally, this would cost you $30, but new players benefit from what is an excellent discount.</p>
<p>If you opt for the No Purchase Bonus, then you get to enjoy 2,000,000 Gold Coins and 2 Free Sweeps Coins. If you are wondering whether this is enough, it’s plenty and will guarantee you a fair bit of time around Chumba Casino without ever having to worry about buying any currency yourself.</p>
<p>Chumba Casino Bonus Codes</p>
<p>Players need not worry about any bonus codes that need to be entered in order to access any of its games. Instead, players can simply follow up on any promotion Chumba Casino extends and deposit the required amount.</p>
<p>Chumba Casino’s VIP Program</p>
<p>Chumba Casino does not feature any VIP programs right now, and the casino is all about casual fun. This means that you can sign up and play right away and enjoy the casino to its fullest. The initial Sweep Coins and Gold Coins you will get are plenty and they will last you for a long while, almost as if you were a VIP yourself!</p>
<p>Chumba Casino Games</p>
<p>Chumba Casino offers an excellent variety of games that are available right on its website, with categories such as Slots, Jackpots, and Table Games all waiting for you. There are some 100-odd titles presently available, and they are all inspired to bring you the best possible experience.</p>
<p>Each of the games at Chumba Casino is briefly previewed, so you can read up on some minutiae and the title’s core mechanics before you even give it a go. There is quite a bit going on here. The games you can try include Blackjack, Western Gold, Pug Royale, Quest West, The Last Empress, Big Bucks Bandits, and Hypernova.</p>
<p>Many are inspired by real online casino slots, with the betting limits usually starting at 250 Gold Coins or 0.01 Sweeps Coins. The maximum bet here is 1,000,000 Gold Coins and 1000 Sweeps Coins. Jackpots are certainly one of the best options here, as you can try Reelin N Rockin, Triple Double Fever, FireShot Jackpot, and more.</p>
<p>Chumba Casino has even developed its own proprietary games, among which are Western Gold, Reelin ‘n Rockin, Big Goreela, and Stampede Fury. The casino often hosts events and tournaments built around these titles.</p>
<p>How to Buy Coins and Play?</p>
<p>If you ever find yourself running a little dry on currency, there is no need to worry. In fact, Chumba will make sure that you have a good stream of Free Sweeps Coins coming your way, as the casino wants to be social, inclusive, and fun for everyone.</p>
<p>Of course, those who play a little more passionately may run dry on some occasions. If this happens, Chumba Casinos allows you to use a number of payment methods, such as Visa, MasterCard, and Direct Bank Transfer, and buy Gold Coins worth $10 per transaction.</p>
<p>The transaction is clear and quick, and you will have absolutely no trouble clearing the banking options. There are additional payment methods, too, such as Skrill and Worldpay, but the casino is also constantly expanding so that it allows you to always stock yourself with currency.</p>
<p>Don’t forget that a jackpot or a good streak at the slots or table games can also fetch you some coins, and this is usually the case. Keep in mind that in order to redeem any cash prizes, you would have to submit verification documents as instructed by the casino. Chumba redemptions will be carried out in 48 hours after verification has been successfully completed.</p>
<p>How to Get Free Sweeps Coins</p>
<p>Players will definitely appreciate how easy it is to get freebies at Chumba Casino. There are many ways that you can access Free Sweeps Coins. Usually, the way you do this is through Facebook competitions, as mentioned before, via email, or as a free gift after you decide to purchase Gold Coins in the first place.</p>
<p>Competitions run daily, so there is really no shortage of opportunities for players to have a go and perhaps win some freebies along the way. This way you can keep your account well stocked and the fun going.</p>
<p>Sweeps Coins can be exchanged for cash prizes, which is one of the biggest appeals of the casino as well, allowing you to make quick and easy use of your gaming efforts if you choose to, or simply opt to bankroll your casino experience further and not withdraw.</p>
