    <h1>South Point Casino Hotel Thunder Casino Deadwood Sd Casinos Sky River Casino Best Live Casino Yggdra</h1>

<p>The leading iGaming content publisher, Yggdrasil, announced the release of a new game together with its YG Masters partner, Bang Bang Games. The newly released slot game, lauded as the "coolest game of the year," invites the players to the frozen tundra and grants a chance for mouth-watering prizes. The new game, Arctic Catch, offers an RTP of 96.1%. The medium-high volatility slot game features a maximum win of €207,360 or a max multiplier of x5,184.</p>
<p>Similar to other games from Yggdrasil and Bang Bang Games, Arctic Catch brings quality graphics and crisp sound effects. The reel of the slot game is displayed at the center of the screen while engaging options such as free spins and multipliers elevate the excitement for online players. The game uses symbols that match its fishing theme and allows autoplay options as well.</p>
<p>Frank McPolin, Bang Bang Games' Managing Director, was excited about the newly released slot game. "We can’t wait for players to experience the frozen tundra in Arctic Catch," he explained in a statement. Moreover, McPolin pointed out: "This release is filled to the brim with bonus features and mechanics that have people fishing up big wins all day long."</p>
<p>Mark McGinley, Yggdrasil's Chief Gaming Officer, was similarly thrilled. "This icy cool slot is a fantastic way for our partnership with Bang Bang Games to wrap up another fantastic year," he explained. Finally, McGinley said: "Fishing games never fail to reel in players, and this one is certainly no different with its lucrative free spins and win multipliers."</p>
<p>Thanks to Arctic Catch's Special Fishy Cash symbols, players have a chance to benefit from cash value between 0.5x and 20x at any time. This happens when one or more fisherman symbols appear during the spin. If there is more than one fisherman on the reels, the cash is collected by each of them, granting a chance for big payouts.</p>
<p>On the other hand, above the reels, online players can see the Catch of the Day. This special reel displays between one and three symbols on every spin, granting a chance for a multiplier between 2x and 20x. "Should players register a win with matching symbols, they will automatically be multiplied by the value shown. For fishermen, total value of all the fish they collect will be multiplied," explains Yggdrasil.</p>
<p>To trigger the Frostbite Free Spins in Arctic Catch, players need to land three or more bonus symbols on the reels. Once this happens, players can receive up to 20 free spins. Elevating the excitement even further, the slot enables players to gamble their spins for an additional 30 spins. However, if players lose this gambling mini-game, they return to the standard game without a bonus.</p>
