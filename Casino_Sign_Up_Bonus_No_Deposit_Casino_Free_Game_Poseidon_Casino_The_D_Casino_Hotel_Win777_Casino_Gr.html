<p>Greentube is doubling down on its reach in Belgium through a new content partnership with a long-standing global partner for the supplier, Betway. Thanks to this particular tie-up, Greentube’s portfolio will now be deployed with the prominent iGaming and sports betting brands in the European market.</p>
<p>Greentube Continues Betway Partnership in Belgium</p>
<p>Among the games that Greentube is bringing are such select titles as Hot Cubes, Book of Ra, and Starliner. All three games have already proven a success both in the market and internationally, and they will give Betway more teeth in clawing a larger share of the lucrative Belgian iGaming landscape as well.</p>
<p>Betway has used the iForium aggregation platform to facilitate this content integration and ensure that players will have quick and easy access to the titles on the platform.</p>
<p>Greentube sales &amp; key account manager Jordan Wall was excited at the opportunity to see the company’s games go live with yet another trusted and valued partner such as Betway in Belgium. Wall added:</p>
<p>We believe that the market will respond favorably to the selection of entertainment that we are providing, further enhancing our presence in this key regulated market. Greentube sales &amp; key account manager Jordan Wall</p>
<p>Betway CEO Anthony Werkman was similarly thrilled and excited at the opportunity. He said that Greentube is indeed a leading and world-class gaming content provider and that the supplier will significantly strengthen Greentube’s position in the country.</p>
<p>Players will get to enjoy more exciting games that are fair, safe, and responsible. Greentube has been rapidly expanding its offer and product reach with rollouts in several countries.</p>
<p>Greentube Doubles Down on International Growth</p>
<p>Elsewhere in Europe, the company negotiated a new partnership with bet365 and rolled out content with the website’s Dutch-facing operations. Beyond Europe, the company has teamed up with Rush Street Interactive and BetRivers to bring its dedicated content to Ontario and Michigan. Greentube is committed to maintaining its pace of growth in all jurisdictions it’s operating in, with more markets to be explored by the company in future.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Betway has been strengthening its own commitment to fair gameplay. The company said that it’s committed to EGBA’s newly-established guidelines on combating money laundering in Europe.</p>
