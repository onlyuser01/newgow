<p>Dear paulinakow8,</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I have not received any update or details regarding your issue until now.</p>
<p>I am afraid there is not much that can be done without the evidence from the casino. Now I will mark the complaint "unresolved" in our system. I understand this is not a satisfactory solution to your issue. However, the decrease in rating caused by unresolved complaints could help to change the casino's approach. If the casino decides to react, we will reopen the complaint and you will be notified by email.</p>
<p>There is one more possible way how you can try to get your winnings back - to file a complaint with the gaming authority that regulates the casino - Gaming Curacao. It is possible to file a complaint via the official website (http://www.gaming-curacao.com/) using a "Contact" button or by sending your complaint to info@gaming-curacao.com. Before submitting the complaint, make sure you provide all the necessary information: your personal data, the casino details, your login details in the casino, the issue description, and supporting attachments if it is needed.</p>
<p>However, the casino representative was able to help me resolve another case with Bonanza Game Casino without problems, and he informed me that he was still waiting for the necessary information and data from the casino departments in charge. Therefore, frankly, I believe he will contact me in the near future regarding the matter, once he gets the requested details, and the complaint will be reopened and reviewed.</p>
<p>In case of any questions or news regarding your issue, do not hesitate to contact me at branislav.b@casino.guru.</p>
<p>I wish I could be of more help. I sincerely hope you will not come across a problem like this again.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Branislav, Casino.Guru</p>
