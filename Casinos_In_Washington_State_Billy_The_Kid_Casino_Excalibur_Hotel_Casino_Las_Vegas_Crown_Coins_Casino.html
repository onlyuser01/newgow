    <h1>Casinos In Washington State Billy The Kid Casino Excalibur Hotel Casino Las Vegas Crown Coins Casino</h1>

<p>Hi i need some advice . I withdrawal an amount of 580 on the 27th of juli . I got an email to send documents. And every time and day that i send the documents this casino tells me its not good , no screenshots ,my name and bank account agent visible , always something . In the end i finshed all my good documents and we were finally there, yeaaa. But to my surprise i got an email on the 31 of july that they are happy to inform me that they recived my documents , but they want more information about a bank account with is ending with 8580 witch i never deposit with on LuckyBull casino. They also want my PAYCHECK or PAYSLIP to see where2 my INCOME comes from . If i have a company they liked to know the company name with all details.</p>
<p>I am very suprised about this because i dont know why they bring up another bank account that i never deposit with and in chat i start asking question how come they know about this bank account , because i never deposit with it . I send an email with this questions also and didnt got an answer. So what i want and need to know if this is the way its supposed to be , that they are asking what my monthly income is, my PAYSLIP , a bank account that i didnt deposit with but is from someone from my household. I hope i can get some help with this .if im in the wrong than they can stop everything or withdrawal and close this account but if not i hope they pay me out the money i won there .</p>
<p>Can you look in to it for me</p>
