<p>Mobile-led casino content supplier Betsoft Gaming announced its games are now live with another Spanish licensed operator, RETAbet.es, as the company continues to pursue its expansion strategy.</p>
<p>Player Wants and Needs Come First</p>
<p>The launch of Betsoft Gaming’s award-winning portfolio of slot titles with RETAbet includes popular releases such as the Sugar Pop and Chilli Pop series, the mystical Book of Darkness and the football-themed game Hat Trick Hero which are now available for players at the iGaming brand.</p>
<p>Commenting on the launch, Alvaro Gonzalez, chief marketing officer of RETAbet, stressed the importance for the online casino operator to continuously innovate by anticipating players’ wants and needs and making sure to deliver.</p>
<p>“Working with a global brand like Betsoft is very important as Betsoft slots are a guarantee for customer engagement and retention,” Gonzalez continued, convinced that RETAbet players will appreciate Betsoft’s gaming content.</p>
<p>The launch with RETAbet is part of Betsoft Gaming’s expansion strategy in Spain as the country became the focus of the gaming supplier’s recent growth strategy since it has passed rigorous ISMS Audits and received autonomy to operate.</p>
<p>Delighted to have the opportunity to work with RETAbet, Betsoft Gaming’s head of account management Anastasia Bauer outlined that the iGaming operator’s “strong brand recognition with Spanish customers, as well as its significant online presence” in Spain are expected to serve as a boost for Betsoft Gaming’s games in the jurisdiction and provide the developer with “access to a new player demographic.”</p>
<p>“We are very excited to be going forward with them,” Bauer concluded.</p>
<p>Spain and Other European Markets</p>
<p>With over 20 years of experience in the Spanish market, RETAbet is one of the established gaming operators in the country, with a presence across 2,300 points of sale in casinos, licensed premises and entertainment venues, and its online operation is aimed at ensuring maximum safety for players.</p>
<p>RETAbet believes its success stems from its business model which is built on vertical integration and allows for adaptation to local market specifications.</p>
<p>The launch with RETAbet is expanding Betsoft Gaming’s presence in Spain and is the latest step of the company’s European-focused expansion strategy which saw the slot supplier enter Romania and double down in Belgium recently.</p>
<p>In September, Betsoft Gaming teamed with the online casino brand of Gibraltar-based gambling group 888 to supply its offering in Romania, featuring award-winning slots such as Take the Bank, Book of Darkness, Stacked, and Primal Hunt on the 888casino platform.</p>
<p>Months earlier, Betsoft Gaming expanded its presence in another European jurisdiction, Belgium, via an agreement with PepperMill Casino to power the brand’s casino offering with Thai Blossoms, 88 Frenzy Fortune, Return to Paris, and other popular titles.</p>
