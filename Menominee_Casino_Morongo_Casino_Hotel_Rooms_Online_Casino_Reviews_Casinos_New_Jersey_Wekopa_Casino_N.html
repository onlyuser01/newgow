<p>The high stakes heads-up match between Daniel Negreanu and Doug Polk is set to begin in Las Vegas, November 4, at 5pm PT. Poker fans will be able to watch the first 200 hands of the series which could potentially go to 25,000 hands live from the PokerGO® Studio at the Aria Resort and Casino in Las Vegas, alongside PokerGO®’s YouTube and Facebook channels.</p>
<p>Rivalry Settled on the Felt</p>
<p>The heads-up game between Daniel Negreanu, winner of 6 World Series of Poker (WSOP) bracelets and 2 World Poker Tour (WPT) championship titles, and Doug Polk, winner of 3 WSOP bracelets and considered by poker specialists as the best heads-up player in the world, is set to settle a long-standing rivalry.</p>
<p>“With Negreanu and Polk’s perennial rivalry and constant conflicts on social media, ‘High Stakes Feud’ will be a match fans will not want to miss. The one-on-one match format between these notable poker professionals, along with the possibility of this game lasting multiple months makes the outcome of each day in this series a must-see.” Mori Eskandani, Executive Producer, PokerGO®</p>
<p>Initially, the game was announced to commence November 1 online at the WSOP.com, but today the Poker Central’s video subscription service announced the game would begin live with the first 200 hands 3 days later and then switch online.</p>
<p>WSOP.com Will Host the Series</p>
<p>The new arrangement was made in collaboration with GGPoker, the poker network for which Daniel Negreanu is an ambassador, and would have preferred to play there, but the requirement to travel for two players who reside in Nevada, especially in the light of the ongoing virus situation, made that option a non-starter.</p>
<p>“Bringing ‘High Stakes Feud’ to life has been a real honor, as millions of poker fans and players around the world have been awaiting this highly anticipated match between Negreanu and Polk. With one of a kind match-ups and a total of 25,000 possible hands, each episode will be exhilarating to witness.” Paul Burke, Senior Manager of Content, GGPoker</p>
<p>There was no confirmation whether previously agreed details for the match remained, but at WSOP.com both players will play at two tables simultaneously and will begin the match with 100 big blinds. Stacks will be automatically topped-up to avoid getting in situations where one of them is short and limited in his play options. Midway through the match, both players would have two options: to agree on raising the limit, or for the losing player to quit.</p>
<p>The “High Stakes Feud” cash game series which will be available exclusively on PokerGO® will probably continue for months as both players agreed to play between 3 to 5 times per week, to decide who is better over 25,000 hands.</p>
<p>Poker fans will eagerly anticipate the outcome of the match to see whether challenger RealKidPoker could easily beat the high stakes online cash games or online heads-up specialist Doug Polk would prove Negreanu was “naïve” to underestimate the game.</p>
