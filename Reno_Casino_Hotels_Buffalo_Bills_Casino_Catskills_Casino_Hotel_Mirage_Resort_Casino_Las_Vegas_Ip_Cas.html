<p>Technology company Lottery.com is expanding its scope of operation with the announcement of a platform that will enable the company to pursue other forms of online gambling, including lottery, sports betting, and sweepstakes. The platform, which is powered by blockchain technology, is still in its early days of development, the company explained.</p>
<p>Early Development of Blockchain Gaming Platform Begins</p>
<p>However, Lottery.com is confident the new solution would help it enhance its API capabilities. Dubbed Project Nexus, Lottery.com will be developing this platform over the next years, leveraging its understanding of blockchain to enhance the product diversity and security of the upcoming project.</p>
<p>Lottery.com board chair and CEO Tony DiMatteo has said that the company firmly believes that the future of gaming is based on blockchain technology and that Project Nexus will be an important step towards realizing this project. He added:</p>
<p>“It’s crucial for any player to have full trust and confidence in the integrity of whatever game they are playing, and blockchain technology has the potential to improve that transparency.” Lottery.com board chair and CEO Tony DiMatteo</p>
<p>Lottery.com will not go it alone. The company is already in touch with leading blockchain developers that can assist it with the development of the solution. Lottery.com will focus on the main strength of blockchain-based gaming solutions, which is transparency and improved security across all verticals.</p>
<p>Project Nexus Charts a Path for the Future of Gaming</p>
<p>Project Nexus will complete its development with a number of proprietary lottery games in the United States which will be offered to plays outside the US as well, and feature multi-billion progressive jackpots shared across jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Lottery.com plans to have a special feature that would allow it to allocate a portion of the jackpot winnings to various social and environmental causes. Another benefit of the project would be the introduction of both FIAT and crypto as viable payment methods.</p>
<p>The company went public back in February via a merger with special purpose acquisition company Trident and has been making headlines ever since. The latest move is a bold statement that the nature of gaming is changing rapidly.</p>
<p>FunFair Games, a company specializing in developing blockchain games, has been among the first to enter the space. Recently, the company released AstroBoomers! TURBO, a continuation of the same game that was originally launched in April. Blockchain is slowly becoming the standard for iGaming.</p>
<p>Lloyd Purser, FunFair Technologies COO, recently spoke to CoinGeek’s Hashing It Out, outlining the use of the technology in gambling.</p>
