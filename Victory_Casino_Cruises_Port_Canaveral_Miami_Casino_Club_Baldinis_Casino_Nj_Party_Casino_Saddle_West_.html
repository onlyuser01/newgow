    <h1>Victory Casino Cruises Port Canaveral Miami Casino Club Baldinis Casino Nj Party Casino Saddle West</h1>

<p>Registered RIOBET casino on 11.07.2002 and did total 9 deposits and 3 cashouts to 31.07.2022 having no issues with casino (except long withdrawal time always more than 24hrs yet promised 'few minutes in average' by casino).</p>
<p>On 31.07.2022 my balance was 0, means all the issues between me and casino were cleared (basically there were no any). Same day on 31.07.2022 I did one more deposit of 1500usdt lost it all and made yet another of 1000 usdt on 01.08.2022 so the total deposits were 2500usdt. After that I ran few successful rounds on blackjack (evolution) and break even having 2513.96usdt on my account. Thus got only +13.96 usdt as winnings and decided to withdraw all.</p>
<p>I made withdrawal request of 2513.96usdt on 02.08.2022. After 24hrs I got verification request, so I sent all documents as was requested. In another 24hrs money still not got to my wallet so I asked online chat what is the problem. Online chat confirmed verification passed, payment confirmed and passed to payment processor so I have to wait for payment to arrive. In another 24hrs I asked again and got same answer. In yet another 24 hrs on 06.08.2022 I insisted to explain what's going on and I was adviced to clarify via tech support by using in-casino messaging system by openning ticket. So I did.</p>
<p>On 06.08.2022 I was announced that some chekup by game provider in prgoress and no payment will be processed until it's over. And I can see in my game history WHY. That I didn't understand but had to wait. So at least this was the THIRD reason of delaying the payment (first verification, then payment agent delay, then suddenly provider chekup).</p>
<p>The answers of tech support are not clear, inconsistent and sometimes rude. No any terms of finalising such checkup announced. Only I was told it takes 'few working days'. For now I'm waiting 'few working weeks' and casino representatives only say they cannot be of any help waiting answer from game provider holding my deposits. So I have to wait for something for some underfinite period of time.</p>
<p>This is no correct behavior from casino side. All checkups shall have reasonable timeframe, shall you fail to complete procedures whithin this time you have to admit that all was fine and just release the money. Otherwise I can wait forever.</p>
<p>Until now 22.08.2022 (20 DAYS) the situation is not resolved, access to games now blocked (and to evolution games history, yet it was screened). No clear answers provided. Casino refuses to pay balance! Account balance at the moment 2529.81 usdt.</p>
<p>Shall you need any screenshots let me know what kind of information you need.</p>
