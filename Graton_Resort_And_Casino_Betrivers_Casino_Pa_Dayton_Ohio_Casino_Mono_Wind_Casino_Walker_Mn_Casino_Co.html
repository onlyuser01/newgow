    <h1>Graton Resort And Casino Betrivers Casino Pa Dayton Ohio Casino Mono Wind Casino Walker Mn Casino Co</h1>

<p>I deposited 100% with a 50% bonus.</p>
<p>then I had about 2000 € in the game account and about 80% wager full, whereupon I played on 5 € and then on 6 €, 8 €, 10 €, 15 €, 20 €, 25 € and then 30 € where I then won about € 11,500.</p>
<p>There was no notification that the wager was reached or that I was not allowed to play over the stake of € 5, as it appears as a warning at other casinos.</p>
<p>now I wanted to pay 3 * 4000 € and my account was blocked this morning due to a misunderstanding which was clarified and then the account was activated but the entire money was debited and frozen and is no longer available to me according to the casino chat employee and provides a final one Management decision that I violated the bonus terms and conditions and played over the maximum amount during the bonus.</p>
<p>As they say, this is correct even if the wager was as good as full or full in my opinion, but I see the problem that I was allowed to continue playing with a higher stake in order to gamble away the money but in return was not allowed to continue playing to win.</p>
<p>please help me as there is no security function of the casino and there is no legal balance which could affect many others.</p>
