    <h1>Wheeling Island Casino L Auberge Casino Resort Lake Charles Ute Mountain Casino Hotel Riverside Casi</h1>

<p>Better Change (Gibraltar) Limited is proud to announce that Rob Mabbett has joined the team in the pivotal new role of Engagement Director.</p>
<p>With a successful career working for BETFRED as an award-winning employee gaining the status of Racing Post/SIS betting shop manager of the year in 2016. Rob has over 11 years of experience working in the gambling industry, more recently supporting those most severely affected by gambling harm as the Director of External Engagement at Gordon Moody, the UK’s leading treatment provider. Rob is a popular well-known figure amongst operators and the safer gambling community alike.</p>
<p>"It is such an honour for Better Change to have someone of Rob’s calibre join us. This senior role will see Rob take control of our strategic direction as well as build on the phenomenal growth we’ve seen over the past two years. Rob’s passion, humility and experience is second to none and I am thrilled to welcome him to our team." Said Victoria Reed, Founder, Better Change.</p>
<p>Better Change is equally proud to partner with for Gordon Moody and that will continue to grow and develop over the next few years as our two organisations continue to collaborate. "The past five years at Gordon Moody have been nothing short of incredible and I am delighted to be leaving them in a hugely strong position and wish them nothing but the very best as I look to focus my efforts slightly further upstream with Better Change.</p>
<p>The opportunity to still be able to continue working in the sector alongside Gordon Moody, while spreading my wings and joining an organisation who have managed to disrupt the industry with professionalism, innovation and a fresh perspective, is an exciting challenge. I’m very excited to get stuck in and to be a part of the next chapter in the Better Change story." said Rob Mabbett.</p>
<p>Better Change was founded in 2021 after the Founders met at Harvard Business School. One was working as the Head of Product for a gaming operator in Gibraltar whilst the other owned a successful social impact company in Manchester. Both had seen first-hand the positive impact the industry’s commitment to safer gambling had achieved and knew they had an opportunity to make a difference by challenging the status quo and thinking differently to continue the great work already happening.</p>
<p>Positive play is at the heart of everything Better Change do. They are bringing safer and responsible gambling to the fore as something for all consumers of gambling products whilst also promoting the great work that the industry already does.</p>
<p>About Better Change (Gibraltar) Limited</p>
<p>Better Change exists to be the driving force for change in the gambling industry. We believe that everyone, players and operators alike, must be able to reach their full potential, free from the grips of gambling harm.</p>
