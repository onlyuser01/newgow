    <h1>Victory Casino Cruises Photos No Deposit Casino Bonus Codes For Existing Players Fort Lauderdale Sem</h1>

<p>Hey there casino guru team, I know that I'm already keeping you guys busy with another matter but this one is absolutely nuts. I will paste the email I sent to the pitboss at limitless casino . In short, they refuse to pay me and claim. I have a bonus amount to pay still, keep in mind I went from a 20$ deposit to paying back over 4k in bets and they still want more, the issue is the balance they claim I still owe is combined with my real balance for one cash amount, they claim I can pay it by betting more but that's an issue, for example if I bet and LOOSE and win back the same amount my balance doesn't change even though I could have just bet 20$!!! I hope this makes sense I don't understand why don't they just take the bonus amount from my earnings, I believe I have overplayed my bonus balance 5x over, they claim my bonus amount is the same even when I bet a little to see if they would change the amount and when I reached out to ask the second time it hadn't changed. I will attach any pictures I have and chats I have requested my gameplay history as I'm only able to view the last couple hrs. If there's anything you need please feel free to reach out to me. Also I wouldn't mind giving my login details privately so that u can test this for yourselves. Also, there's a withdrawal charge for almost 10$ when I was manually rejected,they added the note to my file that I can see. Otherwise all I need is for them to verify my documents which they refuse to do.. Ty p.s.i love what u guys are doing here ty to all the staff.</p>

<p>Hi I'm trying to obtain a copy of my full gameplay history. Seeing how your support representatives are unable to grasp the concept of my complaint. I used a code to get a 116$ bonus on top of my 20$ deposit. This coupon also comes with 200 free spins which I have NOT used yet. I want to fix an issue I'm having with your people. My playthrough balance was over 4000k$ and after many hours and constant playing and betting I payed that back, clearly you can see that because my playthrough balance is at 0$ now I also overplayed my bonus amount back of 116$ and if you can provide me with a copy of my game play history I can prove that. The issue I'm having is my real balance amount is 120.37$ it's not much, but compared to the 4k$ I payed back, it's a lot to me. Which is why I can't understand why your team is playing games with me. They are saying I still have a bonus balance of 116$ to pay back, if that is true then you are definitely not keeping track of what I'm paying back, how can you keep track when your team is saying that the bonus and real balance are combined???? Do I need to sit down and ask with a calculator and subtract every bet I make. Even so they will continue to say the balance is 116$. For example if my real balance is 120.37 and I bet10$ and LOOSE it, 10$ just went to paying the bonus off now at 110.37$. Now, if I bet and WIN 10$ my balance will go back up to 120.37$ I can guarantee that I have payed that bonus back 4x over and I think that you guys just don't want to pay me. If that is not the case how come you just don't take the bonus amount off of the real balance. It's because I already paid it. Can you show me how u are keeping track I don't think you are yesterday I was told I had a bonus balance and I played a few games and I call back the next day to see if they would say a different amount and they did NOT say a different amount, so where did the money go that I bet and lost??? I will attach pictures and text so u can see my dilemma.</p>
