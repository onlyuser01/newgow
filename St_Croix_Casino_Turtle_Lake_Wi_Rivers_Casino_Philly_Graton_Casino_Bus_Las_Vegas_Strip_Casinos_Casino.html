<p>Scott Applauded CEO Greenblatt’s Leadership Skills</p>
<p>Scott thanked a few of the people whom he worked beside. He said that there are way too many whom he enjoyed working with to mention all of them.</p>
<p>Scott singled out Adam Greenblatt as one of the best colleagues he has ever had and said that he remembers how Greenblatt acquired bookmaker.com.au, a small Australian business that eventually became Ladbrokes and Neds.</p>
<p>The departing VP had worked directly under Greenblatt for the last three and a half years and was impressed by the latter man’s leadership skills. Scott lauded the CEO as a leader that has no par “in any category anywhere on the globe.”</p>
<p>Thanks to Adam and the guidance of the executive team, BetMGM continues to make progress. Scott shared that he is excited to continue watching this growth from afar.</p>
