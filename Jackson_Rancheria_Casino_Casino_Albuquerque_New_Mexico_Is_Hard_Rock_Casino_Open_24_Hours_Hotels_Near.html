<p>BETBY, one of the most innovative and forward-thinking suppliers of content for the sports betting and gaming industry, has revealed that it has expanded its geographical footprint and operational capabilities with an office in Montenegro</p>
<p>The company hails this as an important milestone with the office in Budva accommodating a number of BETBY’s employees from across various departments. BETBY is optimistic about the future and has ensured that its current office also has the capacity to expand further.</p>
<p>BETBY Looking to Scale-up in Montenegro and Beyond</p>
<p>The company will focus on employee well-being and promote a hybrid work environment, in which employees feel free to come and go as it fits them best. BETBY already has operational capacities set up in places such as Latvia and Malta and the company has been able to drive significant growth in 2022 relying on team embers in the two countries.</p>
<p>However, 2022 was also an important year of growth in terms of total company employees. The headcount doubled to more than 80 people now employed by BETBY and the trend is possibly going to remain unchanged in 2023, as the company is enjoying a strong and sustained interest in its products and offer.</p>
<p>BEBTY CEO Leonid Pertsovskiy welcomed the expansion and said that opening a new office in Montenegro was an important step forward for the company. He said that it’s a great way to begin the year and a precursor of what is to follow next.</p>
<p>“With it being a full-time office, as well as a space for staff to treat it as a ‘getaway’ destination, we can’t wait to fully utilize the benefits of our latest location and look forward to growing further over the course of the year,” Pertsovskiy concluded.</p>
<p>BETBY has established a number of prominent partnerships of late. The company teamed up with 500 Casino to help it deliver an outstanding sports betting experience. BETBY also teamed up with STATSCORE, seeking to empower bettors a notch further and bring even more powerful and insight-driven data.</p>
<p>BETBY also split its esports division in September in order to ensure that its esports and traditional gaming efforts do not overlap and that each division can work to actively expand its reach in the respective vertical.</p>
