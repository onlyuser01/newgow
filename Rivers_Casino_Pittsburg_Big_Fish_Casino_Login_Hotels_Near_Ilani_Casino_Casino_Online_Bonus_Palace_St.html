<p>The fast-growing poker news source, PokerOrg, announced it forged a new agreement with the World Series of Poker (WSOP). Details regarding the new collaboration emerged Monday and see WSOP designate PokerOrg as the Official Media Partner for the WSOP Circuit Tour’s 2023/2024 season.</p>
<p>Thanks to the newly announced collaboration, poker fans will have a trusted outlet that will be able to deliver insights and information regarding the WSOP Circuit Tour. PokerOrg is already popular within the iGaming sector with its style of reporting that stands out with unique and vibrant coverage of poker events.</p>
<p>Now, under the collaboration with the WSOP, PokerOrg is expected to deliver thrilling reports for every WSOP Circuit event. The coverage of the exciting events is expected to cater not only to national, but international audiences as well across Poker.Org, as well as WSOP.com and their respective social media channels. In addition to the traditional reporting, PokerOrg is expected to bring enhanced side event news, including details regarding exciting actions, highlights of big poker hands, as well as other personalized and insightful data.</p>
<p>The 2023/2024 WSOP Circuit season kicked off on July 17 at Choctaw Durant in Oklahoma where it will run through July 30, 2023. Then, it moves to Harrah’s Cherokee in North Carolina between August 3 and August 14, 2023, leading up to the thrilling WSOP series in Las Vegas for the next summer.</p>
<p>Previously, PokerStars-owned news outlet, PokerNews, brought WSOP Circuit reporting. However, since 2020, when PokerNews ended its coverage, the tour remained without a media partner.</p>
<p>WSOP Is Thrilled to Team Up with PokerOrg</p>
<p>Eric Hollreiser, PokerOrg’s CEO, explained that the poker media company will be delighted to deliver fresh coverage for WSOP Circuit fans. “The WSOP Circuit Tour represents the largest community of poker players on the planet and they deserve dedicated independent media coverage that celebrates the dramatic hero calls, empathizes with the bad beats and raises the profiles of the many characters that represent the diversity of poker players at these events,” he explained. Finally, Hollreiser explained that PokerOrg’s coverage will highlight the most important personalities, as well as unique encounters thanks to its social-media style of reporting.</p>
<p>“Poker boom 2.0 is in full swing and we’re proud the WSOP Circuit has evolved into the most played tournament series in the world.“ Ty Stewart, executive director of the World Series of Poker</p>
<p>Ty Stewart, WSOP’s executive director, said that the WSOP is delighted to see the growth of popularity of the WSOP Circuit. He said that the collaboration with PokerOrg follows a request by the players for more news coverage for the tour’s events. Finally, Stewart said that WSOP is delighted to forge this new collaboration with PokerOrg.</p>
