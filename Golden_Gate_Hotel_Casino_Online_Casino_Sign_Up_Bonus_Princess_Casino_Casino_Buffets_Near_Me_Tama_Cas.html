<p>Dan Ige vs. Andre Fili will serve as the co-main event of UFC on ESPN+ 94 on Saturday, February 10, 2024. In this post, we’re going to preview the co-main event, sharing our top Ige vs. Fili picks along the way</p>
<p>Dan Ige was originally meant to fight Lerone Murphy at UFC on ESPN+ 94, but Murphy pulled out of the fight in January due to an injury. Andre Fili stepped in on short notice, but he’s had a full camp relatively recently – he fought (and beat) Lucas Almeida in December.</p>

<p>Dan Ige Wants to Make Himself Relevant Again</p>
<p>Dan Ige has an impressive fighting portfolio. His record is 17-7, with zero losses inside the distance. However, five of his losses happened in his last eight fights, which is why he stopped being discussed as a potential featherweight contender.</p>
<p>That used to be the case a couple of years ago, especially after he went 6-0 from 2018 to 2020. On the bright side, he’s still relatively young, so we could see him bounce back. This goes especially because he did okay in his last three fights, each of which happened last year.</p>
<p>First, he beat Damon Jackson by KO, which earned him the Performance of the Night bonus from the UFC. A couple of months later, he fought Nate Landwehr, winning by unanimous decision this time. Then, in his most recent fight – in September 2023 – he lost to wrestling maestro Bryce Mithcell. Ige lost by unanimous decision in a fight in which he got taken down five times.</p>
<p>Andre Fili Ready to Fight Despite Accepting the Fight on Short Notice</p>
<p>Andre Fili has plenty of experience, with his record being 23-10-1. He’s fought 10 fights more than Ige; however, he hasn’t fought too many elite featherweights so far. Sure, in the early days of his career, he fought (and lost to) Max Holloway, as well as Yair Rodriguez.</p>
<p>However, over the last couple of years, he’s been fighting mostly against prospects. To give you a few examples, he fought Nathaniel Wood last year, who was 29 at the time, while in 2020, he fought Bryce Mitchell and Charles Jourdain who were in their mid-20s at the time.</p>
<p>In his most recent fight, he fought Lucas Almeida, who had previously fought only twice in the UFC. He beat him by a first-round TKO. This happened in December, meaning that he’s probably still fit to fight. Actually, we think that’s why he agreed to fight Ige on February 10.</p>
<p>Dan Ige vs. Andre Fili Prediction</p>
<p>It’s very likely Dan Ige vs. Andre Fili will go the distance, but which fighter will get the judges’ vote? We think it’s going to be Ige. We think he’s just the better fighter.</p>
<p>Pick: Dan Ige by decision</p>
