    <h1>Primm Casino Binion Casino Mark Twain Casino Las Vegas Hotel And Casino Palms Casino Resort Reviews</h1>

<p>Dear All,</p>
<p>There have been several violations of our terms and conditions from the user’s side detected.</p>
<p>By creating multiple accounts, users violated clause 3.1.2. of our terms and conditions:</p>
<p>"You are allowed to have only one Member Account. If you attempt to open more than one Member Account, all betting accounts you try to open will be blocked or closed and any bets or winnings from your closed or blocked account will be voided for at the discretion of the casino administration."</p>
<p>Despite the clause 3.2.1.</p>
<p>"you may have the one and only account on this website, registered in your own name. Any other accounts in your name on this Website will be considered Duplicate and will be closed immediately. Company may also at its discretion void all the bets that have been placed in the duplicate accounts. Should company decide to leave one account open, it will be the first account that you opened, to which your remaining deposits, if any, will be transferred (subject to reasonable charges); If you gained or accrued any returns, winnings or bonuses on your Duplicate Account they will be canceled and deposits will be transferred to your first account. If you would like to open another account, please contact our Customer Support. In case of opening another account the previous one will be closed. If you want to close your existing Account please contact our Customer Support. Otherwise keep your account details up-to-date."</p>
<p>the user didn’t inform us about the creation of several accounts on our site. There was no communication where the user mentioned another account till the moment the violation was detected. The user had to contact support to open a new account, according to clause 3.2.1.</p>
<p>Without conducting additional security checks, and requesting verification, we adhered to clause 3.3.3. of the terms and conditions: "The payment manager may carry out additional verification procedures for any cumulative withdrawals exceeding 2000 EUR (or your currency equivalent), and further reserves the right to carry out such verification procedures in case of lower payouts. Documents for verification including but not limited to all below-mentioned documents should be provided in good quality only and within 14 days since request:"</p>
<p>The first withdrawals of the user's funds were lower by the amount, so verification was not requested. During the last check, we found a 100% match with other accounts, so verification was no longer necessary since the user violated the rules and was blocked.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Mr.Bet Casino team</p>
