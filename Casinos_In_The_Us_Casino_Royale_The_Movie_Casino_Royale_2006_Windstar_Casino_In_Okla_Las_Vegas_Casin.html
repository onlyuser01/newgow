<p>Gaming solutions supplier Intralot announced today it partnered with software giant Microsoft to deploy its cloud solution Microsoft Azure. The collaboration agreed between both parties marks a significant step for the Greek-based technology provider in its intent to unlock its digital capabilities through the introduction of business innovation.</p>
<p>Sports Betting and Lottery Cloud-Ready Solutions</p>
<p>Intralot’s new product families for retail and internet lotteries, Lotos X, and for retail and online sports betting, Intralot Orion, are cloud-ready solutions, as the company has been shifting its strategic model to a cloud-based one as part of a business overhaul which began in 2019. The new lottery and sports wagering solutions have reduced time-to-market, immediate scalability and interoperability, and the deployment of Microsoft Azure will increase the company’s efficiency and speed up adaptation of its digital core across the business.</p>
<p>“We are delighted to partner with Microsoft as we accelerate the execution of our strategy in transforming the industries that we serve through digital technology. Lotos X and INTRALOT Orion are designed for building ecosystems around them, for rapidly achieving a diversified portfolio of gaming offerings, and for scaling to meet the new demand created by players and operators. Our products in Microsoft Azure open the way for an unlimited set of opportunities for gaming operators.” Dr. Chris Dimitriadis, CEO, INTRALOT Group</p>
<p>Next-Level Resilience and Scalability</p>
<p>Microsoft Azure, a global cloud platform spreading to over 60 regions worldwide, will be utilized to power up Intralot’s digital transformation and shape the new image of the lottery and betting solutions provider. Looking to address demands on a 24/7 base globally and provide a faster time-to-market expansion and enhanced service innovation, Intralot finds in Azure the one-fits-all solution. For iGaming clients, Microsoft Azure provides a higher level of resilience and extra scalability.</p>
<p>“Our collaboration with INTRALOT is a milestone that reflects how technology can fuel the growth and strategic vision of a large group, leading gaming operations. Microsoft Azure is designed to help organizations meet their business challenges and to empower their successful navigation in a rapidly changing environment.” Theodosis Michalopoulos, CEO, Greece, Cyprus and Malta, Microsoft</p>
<p>The partnership deal with Microsoft ensures an expansion of Intralot’s digital capabilities, while marketing and sponsorship deals spread its popularity among sports fans and bettors. In July, Intralot entered into an agreement with Major League Baseball (MLB) to become an Authorized Gaming Operator of the professional league. The deal granted for the operator access to official data, marks and logos from the MLB to use in its sports wagering platform.</p>
