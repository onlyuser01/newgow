    <h1>Casino Hotels In Washington State Casino Dayton Ohio Online Casino Real Money Gambling Casinos Casin</h1>

<p>I am not entirely sure of the disputed amount, but I would argue it is quite big.</p>
<p>I requested self-exclusion from Wheelz and Wildz on April 15th, 2021. This was, however, not adhered to, and the casino has stated that this is because I didn't send the email from the email I registered on the platform with.</p>
<p>I, however, had CLEARLY stated the email registered with in the email sent to both casinos. I was able to play and deposit until December, 2021 until I finally self-excluded myself again from the platform. I believe I am entitled to a refund. All the details should match to my account details and this is unacceptable. I have attached screenshots of the email.</p>
