    <h1>Tropicana Atlantic City Casino Buffalo Thunder Resort And Casino Hotels Near Fallsview Casino Orlean</h1>

<p>I was playing 'Break da bank again ' on my mobile phone and I had $1700.00. Unbeknown to me, I had pushed the max bet and pushed play,that was a $1000.00 bet. My problem is that the max bet should not be able to proceed ,instead a pop up should appear so that you know and therefore change it back to your previous bet. 'Break da bank again respin' has that in place. It's so easy to do when you have been playing for a long period of time and I think that the casinos know that and it's just another way of them getting an unfair advantage. This is unfair and unsportsman like. They already have enough house odds in their favour. I complained to them but they didn't care at all and said they would look into it,but still havnt done a thing to rectify this problem. Just goes to show that they don't care . Thanks . I stopped playing at jackpot city after that.</p>
