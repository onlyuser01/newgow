    <h1>The Best Online Casino Admiral Casino Biz Philly Casino Rizk Casino Mc Luck Casino GeoComply Adds Ga</h1>

<p>Geolocation tech specialist GeoComply made its first high-profile addition for 2022, Sarafina Wolde Gabriel, who was appointed as Senior Director of Global Markets to bolster the firm’s commercial and business development strategy.</p>
<p>Switch from Digital Marketing to Cybersecurity</p>
<p>The news that Sarafina Wolde Gabriel joined the ranks of GeoComply as its Senior Director of Global Markets was announced on the Linkedin profile of the marketing and business development specialist. Gabriel stated that her career as an Income Access executive spanning nearly over 2 decades came to an end as she elected to pursue pastures new.</p>
<p>“After nearly 18 years at Income Access I have traded in my digital marketing hat for a cybersecurity one.” Sarafina Wolde Gabriel, Senior Director, Global Markets, GeoComply</p>
<p>The appointment of Gabriel followed hot in the footsteps of another executive shuffle at GeoComply after the company’s chairman and co-founder Anna Sainsbury stepped in as CEO to replace fellow co-founder David Briggs who continued in the role of a Corporate Director.</p>
<p>“I am delighted to embark on a new journey with Anna Sainsbury, David Briggs and the team at GeoComply to help support the company’s global growth of their market-leading innovative geolocation security and anti-fraud solutions.” Sarafina Wolde Gabriel, Senior Director, Global Markets, GeoComply</p>
<p>Choosing the new challenge presented by the geolocation security provider, Gabriel thanked all her colleagues and clients for the support they had given her over the years.</p>
<p>In her new role, Wolde Gabriel will be charged with the implementation of GeoComply’s new commercial strategy and will be expected to leverage her expertise and industry experience gained in the past, when she had led all commercial units of Income Access.</p>
<p>Expansion of Cybersecurity Services</p>
<p>Gabriel’s role was instrumental in helping the brand establish itself as the dominant affiliate marketing platform in the online gambling space and attract the interest of Paysafe Group which acquired it in a $30 million deal in 2016.</p>
<p>Following the acquisition of Income Access, Paysafe itself became a target and was acquired by private equity funds Blackstone and CVC Capital in a transaction valued at $3 billion.</p>
<p>The appointment of Wolde Gabriel is in line with GeoComply’s recognition of the need for internal changes to support new “strategic initiatives” such as the expansion of the company’s cybersecurity services into new markets.</p>
