    <h1>Orion Star Casino Branson Mo Casinos Valley River Casino Casinos In Alabma Riverside Casino STS Casi</h1>

<p>I joined STS casino registered no problem at all. I deposited Â£80. I didnt know that you could not use a 3rd party card. The reason I used a different card is because at the moment I am using my moms card as I don't currently have a useable bank account. There was no issue registering the card and I won around 1200 I withdrew no problem. I carried on and ended up depositing around 1065 back but then I won 1150.. so I decided to withdraw as soon as I hit withdraw the verification process started. I sent all info that was required and then they closed the accoubt down and confiscated all winnings</p>
<p>One I know now that I shouldn't of used a third party deposit method however I had full authorisation to use this card proof been sent. Secondly i am only asking for my deposits back. One according to the UKGC website verification should not be done on withdrawal if it could of been done sooner which it could of been I am so stressed about all this. There is no point going through there ADR as they don't respond apparatntly I have exhausted there complaint system</p>
<p>Can you help me ??</p>
