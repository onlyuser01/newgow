    <h1>Pioneer Gambling Hall And Casino Immokalee Casino Florida Bitcoin Casinos Eagle Pass Casino Hollywoo</h1>

<p>It is a chat that was exchanged. (T is me at the beginning of the sentence, C is the other party)</p>
<p>December 21</p>
<p>T. I'm always sorry. He seems to have won a bullet tournament at 5am and has $ 25 in his treasure collection, but when he tries to activate it, he just gets an error. I was told to contact support at, so I contacted. Thank you.</p>
<p>C. Thank you for your inquiry. Tanaka will be in charge.</p>
<p>The way to improve the situation is</p>
<p>Please try using the incognito mode or secret mode of the browser you are currently using.</p>
<p>Also, we would appreciate it if you could check if you are logged in to Kasmo on multiple web pages.</p>
<p>Symptoms may improve.</p>
<p>We apologize for the inconvenience, but please try the above once.</p>
<p>We would appreciate it if you could log in again.</p>
<p>T. What are incognito mode and secret mode? I logged out and logged in for the time being, but it doesn't change.</p>
<p>C. $ 25 Bonus is in the treasure. Please take a moment to click on the user name on My Page to get it from the treasure.</p>
<p>T. I see. I'll try later.</p>
<p>C. Could you please send me a screenshot of the treasure page?</p>
<p>T. This is it. (The screenshot attached there as well)</p>
<p>C. Can't you click on that treasure?</p>
<p>T. This is the result of pressing. (This is another screenshot attached to it)</p>
<p>C. I'm clever. After confirming with the department in charge, we will contact you by e-mail. We apologize for the inconvenience.</p>
<p>T. Thank you.</p>
<p>c. I'm clever.</p>
<p>December 22</p>
<p>T. I requested withdrawal of the existing balance to some extent, so</p>
<p>I'll ask you to use four of the treasure collections. I'm going to work, so I don't plan to go home until around 16:00.</p>
<p>C. I haven't received a response from the department in charge yet, so I'm sure it will take some time. We will contact you by email as soon as we receive an answer.</p>
<p>You can't even use the treasure of T. Free Spins. Is this just me?</p>
<p>C. We apologize for the inconvenience caused to Tsukajima.</p>
<p>We will also check with the department in charge about that matter, so please give us some time.</p>
<p>C. We are very sorry to have kept you waiting.</p>
<p>Tsukajima seems to have been regarded as a hunter who will continue to work in the same area forever for the bonus, and the treasures currently acquired and the treasures to be acquired in the future will be confiscated.</p>
<p>It is okay to withdraw money.</p>
<p>I kindly thank you.</p>
<p>Tanaka</p>
<p>Kasmo</p>
<p>December 23</p>
<p>T. Are you hunting? I don't know what you mean, but do you mean that you won't get any prize money if you participate in Kasmo's attractive bullet tournament in the future? Even though the account authentication has been completed, it's a terrible story. I didn't win a big jackpot. It's a pity that playing with Kasmo seems to be so because I've felt that it's worth living these days.</p>
<p>C. We also talked to the department in charge, but he said that he couldn't do anything about it.</p>
<p>We apologize for making Tsukajima feel uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Thank you for your understanding.</p>
<p>I then filed an objection by email, but it was not accepted under the Terms of Service 3.2.1. that's all.</p>
