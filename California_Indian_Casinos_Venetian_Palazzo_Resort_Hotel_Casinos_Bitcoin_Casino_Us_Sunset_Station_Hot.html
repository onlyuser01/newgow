    <h1>California Indian Casinos Venetian Palazzo Resort Hotel Casinos Bitcoin Casino Us Sunset Station Hot</h1>

<p>I decided to register an account with Genesis casino on 3 may 2022. I deposited 150 zar and won 2300 zar. They needed my bank details and I sent it over and over and over again. Then they said as per t&amp;c i used my wifes bank account. Of course as i told them so. Same bank details to withdraw. I dont have a bank account and my salary is paid into her account. I have full consent to use the account. Genesis Casino required 3rd party documents and consent that i can use the account plus id document and bank statements. After long waiting and fighting they send a confirmation mail that i am verified at the casino. I have all the email corrospondence. Then today they send a mail that i am in breach of their t&amp;c and forfeit my winning. I was treated like a criminal on their live chat i have the transcripts and after many comms and time wasting with their requirements i loose my deposit and winnings. I went through their t&amp;c and it is not clear anywhere that i ant use my wifes account. In the t&amp;c it state the same method you deposit same method withdraw same bank account deposit and withdraw. You wait very long for their live chats sometimes 20 min. I was seriously treated like a criminal and i am honest and also registered with other casinos that do not have these excuses. I am concerbed as they were already fined in the past fir misconducy after research by me on the internet and see the current complaint list i will do anything in my power to warn south africans against genesis casino. I was never ever rejected from any casino withdrawal before. They are scamsters and i need to warn the public. They stole my R150 zar. They were fined R3.8 million pounds for irregularities. They need to be blacklisted in SA. I did not receive a welcome bonus and played with my 150 zar straight. I win 2300 zar and withdraw. Then they needed documents as i requested in live chat why is it taking so long. I feel they took my 150 zar without my knowledge of the t&amp;c that i read and could not state that i cant use my wifes account. We do not keep ourselve busy with criminal activity or money laundering or we are not minors. I registered the account in my name ti be honest i should have rather registered it in my wifes name if i knew they are coming with stories. I am the obly breadwinner ib the house and my wife is unemployed. I do not have an bank account and my salary goes into her account and we are maaried within community of property that means i have a right to the account. The funds belongs to both of us. It is a simple well thought out rule suddenly to prevent me from withdrawing and that need to be exposed. How many players get conned on this so called rule. I want my winnings or t least my deposit back. Thabk you i will email all proof if you supply me with an email adres and decide for yourself if i am wrong. Regards G. A Eybers</p>
