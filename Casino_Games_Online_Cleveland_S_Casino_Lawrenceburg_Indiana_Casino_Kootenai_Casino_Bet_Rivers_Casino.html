<p>Lottery technology provider Scientific Games has renewed and extended its longstanding partnership with the Texas Lottery for another 12 years adding innovative technology to the collaboration.</p>
<p>The Extended Collaboration Includes Scientific Games’ SCiQ Ecosystem</p>
<p>Scientific Games’ long-running collaboration with the Texas Lottery is being extended until 2034 with a new partnership agreement.</p>
<p>The Texas Lottery will continue to offer Scientific Games’ scratch ticket games, however, the new addition to the partnership is Scientific Games’ SCiQ technology, which is an innovative system that provides a unique display of the scratch ticket products and enhanced the safety of these products. In addition, SCiQ helps retailers with tools for making inventories, marketing the games, and other operational improvements. The Texas Lottery will introduce Scientific Games’ SCiQ units at the beginning of 2023.</p>
<p>Long Lasting and Fruitful Partnership</p>
<p>Ever since the launch of the Texas Lottery in 1992, Scientific Games has been its partner providing the lottery with scratch ticket games. Together they have collected revenue of over $35 billion, which has been used through state programs for the benefit of the educational system, various initiatives targeted toward veterans, and many others.</p>
<p>Texas Lottery executive director Gary Grief expressed his excitement about the new Scientific Games contract extension: “We look forward to partnering on more memorable player experiences together while bringing SCiQ to our retailers to advance the technology supporting our scratch ticket game sales.“</p>
<p>Grief also highlighted that the products and promotions provided by Scientific Games played a key role in selling scratch tickets for over $6.73 billion in the fiscal year 2022.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the partnership between the Texas Lottery and Scientific Games has lasted for a long time and has always been marked by innovative products. One of its most successful initiatives was the $5 million Vegas challenge, which was offered to Texas residents three times. Each time it was tied to a certain brand of Scientific Games scratch card tickets that gave players the chance to win an excursion to Las Vegas and cash prizes of up to $5 million, which were only available at Scientific Games events organized for winning ticket holders.</p>
<p>Scientific Games Keeps Expanding Globally with an Array of New Partnerships</p>
<p>Scientific Games is a leading producer and provider of instant games. The company collaborates with 130 lotteries that are located in over 50 countries around the world with a particularly strong presence in North America, which includes almost all lottery providers.</p>
<p>At the beginning of September, the leading lottery operator became a partner to the national lottery operator in Latvia. In August, the company signed a partnership agreement with the Colorado Lottery, adding one more US state to its portfolio. In July, Scientific Games also expanded in Latin America with a new contract with Ecuador’s national lottery and it also extended its 50-year collaboration with Canada’s Loto-Québec for another 5 years.</p>
