<p>Toronto Raptors: Game Preview</p>
<p>The Toronto Raptors have had a few quick brushes with some outstanding teams in the season restart and they have handled them well. They defeated the first seed in the Eastern Conference, the Milwaukee Bucks on Monday, to the cheers of virtual crowds. The teamâ€™s previous successes include the Memphis Grizzlies, even though the Boston Celtics proved too much to bite when the Raptors faced them late last week.</p>
<p>The Raptors pulled a great game against the Bucks as well, as Kyle Lowry, clearly the teamâ€™s MVP had to sit the match out with a sore lower back. Another huge issue for the team was a missing Serge Ibaka who had bruised right knee and Fred VanVleet couldnâ€™t return because of a hyperextended right knee.</p>
<p>Raptors rookie Matt Thomas had to step up and he did alright, bringing in some 22 points in the night against the Bucks. Normal Powell added another 21 points against the Bucks, and both athletes are now considered</p>
<p>Philadelphia 76ers: Keep It Together</p>
<p>The 76ers have an important game upcoming against the Phoenix Suns in several hours, and thatâ€™s going to be their first hurdle.</p>
<p>The Suns are already 6-0 in the season restart and they seem to be unstoppable enough, but if the 76ers can put a fight tonight and curb their winning streak, we have every reason to believe, Philadelphia will do great versus the Raptors as well.</p>
<p>Now, the 76ers are down a few players of their own with Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons unfortunately recovering from injuries. The pair is definitely out for todayâ€™s game, but Embiid might return for the game against the Raptors.</p>
<p>ðŸŽ¥ A season-high effort from @J_Rich1.</p>

<p>If he does, that would be a huge boost for the team. In the absence of talented players such as Simmons and Embiid, Brett Bown will have to rely on Josh Richardson, a novice who can hold the defenses and dictate the offense for his team.</p>
<p>Philadelphia arenâ€™t out of tricks just yet, nor do they need tricks to give the Raptors a good run tomorrow. But first, they have to sort out the Phoenix Suns.</p>
