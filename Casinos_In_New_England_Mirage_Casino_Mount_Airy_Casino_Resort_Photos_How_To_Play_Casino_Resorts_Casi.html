<p>Paysafe announced on Tuesday that its payment platform is now available in New Jersey and Colorado via SuperBook Sports. The number of accepted payment methods at SuperBook was already vast, and Paysafe has now contributed to the list.</p>
<p>Paysafe’s North America CEO Expressed His Thoughts on the Partnership</p>
<p>While speaking about the latest development, Zak Cutler, the CEO of Paysafe North America iGaming, stated that the payment provider is more than happy to partner with SuperBook Sports, a brand that has shown significant growth in the Colorado betting market. He added that Paysafe is confident that with the help of its advanced analytics suite, it will be able to help SuperSport continue its growth in 2022 by providing bettors with massive flexibility on deposits and withdrawals.</p>
<p>SuperBook launched its services in Colorado back in October 2020. Later, in August 2021, it expanded to New Jersey. Thanks to the app and website, registered bettors will be able to wager on many of the most popular sports in the US and around the globe, with some honorable mentions being the NBA, NFL, MLB, soccer and NHL, as well as college football.</p>
<p>Its influence in Colorado reached its pinnacle when the University of Denver welcomed SuperBook as its official betting sponsor and thus, became the second Colorado university to form an alliance with the operator.</p>
<p>Bettors Will Have a Variety of Choices Thanks to Paysafe</p>
<p>By plugging in Paysafe’s platform via a streamlined integration, registered bettors at SuperBook will be able to select one of multiple deposit and withdrawal methods, including online bank transfers, credit and debit cards, as well as alternative methods like Skrill. Paysafecard eCash and third-party alternatives are also up for grabs.</p>
<p>Moreover, SuperBook will launch the modern back-end analysis and reporting suite of Paysafe, which will allow the operator to analyze and optimize payment methods chosen by individuals. Thanks to the fact that Paysafe has over 20 years of experience in risk and fraud connected to gaming, the infrastructure of this platform will make sure that the data from players is secure and kept out of harm’s way at all times.</p>
<p>Jay Kornegay, the Executive Vice President of SuperBook, stated that payments are a crucial part of the overall wagering experience, which is why the operator puts massive focus on strengthening the offering in this area and better the overall depositing experience for all registered bettors.</p>
<p>He considers the partnership with Paysafe as a logical step towards the company’s progress due to the fact that Paysafe’s cutting-edge platform will bring a lot of positive changes for both SuperBook and all of its players.</p>
