<p>3 Dice Baccarat at Aspers Casino Westfield is played on a Craps table, instead of a Baccarat table and uses dice instead of cards</p>
<p>Manufacturer of casino equipment Galaxy Gaming, Inc. announced today that its 3 Dice Baccarat game has made its international debut with Aspers Casino Westfield in Stratford City, London.</p>
<p>Debuting on UK’s Largest Casino Floor</p>
<p>The installation of 3 Dice Baccarat tables at the land-based casino operated by the Aspers Group marked the first international placement for the innovative game that was showcased at G2E 2022, as well as a major development for the world’s largest independent developer and distributor of casino table games and technology.</p>
<p>Commenting on the announcement, Aspers Group’s head of Gaming, Steve Mosley, highlighted the popularity of Baccarat in the UK and especially at the country’s largest gaming floor at Aspers Casino Westfield, “always keen to champion new and innovative ideas.”</p>
<p>He further outlined that Galaxy Gaming’s 3 Dice Baccarat “has proved to be a valuable addition” to the casino and a driver of revenue as more and more guests are willing to participate.</p>
<p>Representing a reimagined form of the classic Baccarat game, 3 Dice Baccarat is a fast and fun game in which playing cards are replaced with dice: two sets of three dice – one for the Player and one for the Banker – and at Aspers Casino Westfield is played on a Craps table, instead of a Baccarat one.</p>
<p>Interest and Vision</p>
<p>Gavin Wright, Europe Sales consultant at Galaxy Gaming, outlined that the Aspers Group had shown a clear interest and “vision for what 3 Dice Baccarat can bring to the casino floor,” and it was the casino that believed playing it on a Craps table would further enhance the player experience.</p>
<p>“We are delighted that Aspers has installed the game and look forward to placing additional in the international space,” Wright concluded.</p>
<p>Headquartered in Las Vegas, Galaxy Gaming is a major supplier of casino gaming equipment and bonus systems to casinos on land, riverboat, and cruise ships, and develops and distributes electronic wagering platforms for the online gaming industry worldwide.</p>
<p>Last month, the company featured prominently at 2023 ICE London, showcasing its new and innovative table game operating system, Galaxy OS, the first three Galaxy-built table games, Roulette Up, Split to Double Blackjack, and Rising Phoenix Baccarat, and its vast online content portfolio, including most popular titles 21+3, Top 3 and Perfect Pairs and new additions such as High Roller Hold’em.</p>
<p>Among Galaxy Gaming’s latest partners in North America is ODDSworks, following the content distribution deal the parties signed in October last year.</p>
