<p>Blackhawk Network, an American company that operates in the prepaid, gift card and payments industries, has forayed into the states of New York and Louisiana after securing approval from the relevant regulators.</p>
<p>The Payment Provider Entered New York and Louisiana</p>
<p>Blackhawk Network has received approval from the New York Gaming Commission and the State of Louisiana to offer its products in the state. As a result, customers in the two states will be able to access the company’s payment services and sports betting gift card products.</p>
<p>Sports bettors will now be able to purchase Blackhawk’s famous Game On gift card. The latter is redeemable on multiple sports betting operators’ platforms and allows users to fund their accounts. Customers can either use the cards to power their own accounts or gift them to a friend with a passion for sports and sports betting.</p>
<p>Blackhawk Network launched the Game On cards in 2020. Since then, numerous operators have adopted the company’s gift cards as a viable payment solution. This notably includes companies such as BetMGM, BetRivers, DraftKings and FanDuel.</p>
<p>Blackhawk Is Excited to Reach More States</p>
<p>Steve Dekker, Blackhawk’s managing director of the Americas, spoke about the company’s growth. He noted that Blackhawk is currently a branded payment provider for many of the best sports betting companies in the United States. As such, the provider is bullish on powering its partners with “the most compelling and on-trend gift card content”, including the Game On cards and other exciting sports betting products.</p>
<p>Dekker said that his company is delighted to expand and offer its products in more new regulated sports betting jurisdictions.</p>
<p>“As New York, Louisiana and other states upon approval continue growth in the gaming category, we’re pleased to be able to provide retailers with another option for players to spend, budget and also gift the entertainment of sports betting.”</p>
<p>Alternative Payments: Increasingly Important</p>
<p>As gambling and sports betting continue to grow in popularity, more and more companies realize the need for alternative payment methods. As a result, both established and emerging companies have begun inking partnership deals with respectable payment solution providers. The deals allow gambling companies to provide bettors with varied ways to pay, including cashless solutions and gift cards.</p>
<p>Yesterday, SoftSwiss penned a new agreement with Praxis Tech, a payment solutions provider. A few weeks ago, MiFinity agreed to power PressEnter Group with its own payment methods. A few days prior, Nuvei extended its payment partnership with Eyas.</p>
