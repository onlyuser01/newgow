    <h1>High Noon Casino Gate City Casino Mount Pleasant Casino Belterra Casino Slot Madness Casino Snatch C</h1>

<p>Good evening,</p>
<p>As in the email to Casino Guru, I sent Casino Support several times all the data required by Snatch Casino in the chat. The request to pause my account (3 weeks) was not answered, which shows how seriously a casino takes player protection. There is also no way to set this yourself. This seemed extremely frivolous to me, so I requested a copy of my data (game history and transaction list) and then had my account closed permanently (chat history was made available to you)</p>
<p>Since then I have not received any reply or an excerpt of my personal data. I was simply ignored, hence the non-credited profit.</p>
<p>In the last mail I was asked to prove the win in my player profile, which was not possible because you could only scroll to a certain point on the page, hence the request for the data (game history) to fulfill this harassment as well, although I was explained step by step in the live chat how I can get the necessary data directly from the slot (last winnings over 50x with replay link) which I did, but these are suddenly being called into question here.</p>
<p>As far as the bonus credit is concerned, it was credit in the form of coins earned through deposits/sales, which could then be converted into credit in the shop. In the bonus conditions, no minimum turnover is specified in this regard, but a maximum possible payout amount of x5 of the credit purchased in the shop. As you can read here.</p>
<p>https://snatchcasino.eu/en/page/bonus-terms</p>
<p>Because after deposits were withheld from me for 5 days, despite the evidence provided, I didn't want to continue depositing at Snatchcasino due to the bad experience and the low degree of player-friendly measures because everything seemed pretty dubious to me. Which is proven here again, since you don't seem to hold yourself to your own terms.</p>
<p>No other casino experienced so many complications, errors and discrepancies in just one week, not to mention the lack of player protection. No matter how this case goes and you want to wriggle out of here, the main thing is that this is also visible to other players.</p>
<p>Thanks for your support!</p>
