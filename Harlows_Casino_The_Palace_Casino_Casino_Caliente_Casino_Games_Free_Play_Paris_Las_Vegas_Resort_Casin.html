<p>Information about Ethereum casinos</p>
<p>Ethereum — or its currency Ether — is one of the best-known cryptocurrencies. Its use of smart contracts and highly secure blockchain technology for tokens such as NFTs means that it has won the trust of many major investors, and it's now possible to make payments with ETH for a wide variety of online purchases, including making deposits in some of the best Ethereum casinos you can find on this page.</p>
<p>With the rise in the popularity of Ethereum and cryptocurrencies as a whole over the recent years, Ethereum deposits are accepted by a large number of online casinos. This page exists to help you choose the best Ethereum casino for you, and to give you all the information about ETH casinos you might need along the way.</p>

<p>History of Ethereum and ETH</p>
<p>As major altcoins go, Ethereum was a late starter. Launched in 2015 by Gavin Wood and Vitalik Buterin, it offered users a decentralized payment system that runs on Blockchain technology, much like Bitcoin. ETH's supply is much larger, though, currently at 120 million, unlike Bitcoins hard cap amount of 21 million.</p>
<p>ETH has several other key differences to Bitcoin. Firstly, it uses blockchain not only for payments, but also to store computer code that powers secure smart contracts and decentralized apps, known as dapps.</p>
<p>Note: Smart contracts are the mechanism behind NFTs, as they provide ironclad proof of ownership. ETH is also committed to a proof-of-stake system when mining new coins, which is thought to consume less energy and be more efficient than Bitcoin's proof-of-work tool.</p>
<p>ETH's flexibility and efficiency has led to some people calling it the main contender to Bitcoin's crown. Its rise in value reflects this: in the first four months of 2021 alone, its value increased six-fold as major investors decided that the coin was a good long-term bet for growth. After a big increase in 2021, the value of ETH has fallen a bit, but is again on the rise as of the start of 2024.</p>
<p>Despite Ethereum's undoubted success, it has suffered a few setbacks. In 2016, a hacker stole $50 million of Ether, which led the ETH community to hard-fork the blockchain to reverse the theft – that is, to split the currency in two. This means that we now have Ethereum Classic as well as the current version, plus an upgrade known as Ethereum 2.0, that aims to increase the speed and number of transactions, as well as the coin's scalability.</p>
<p>Today, ETH is recognized as a major altcoin and, with a market cap of just under $300 billion as of the start of 2024, its use is becoming more widespread. Read on to find out how more about this digital currency and how you can use it in an online casino.</p>
<p>Pros and cons of using Ethereum in online casinos</p>
<p>If you're looking to use Ethereum as a payment method, then its biggest advantage is its security. Blockchain technology protects your payments from fraud or interference from third parties. It's literally hacker-proof unless you store your unique blockchain key in a place where other people can see it. Fiat payment providers are simply unable to provide this type of protection, although many do offer refunds or compensation if a payment goes wrong.</p>
<p>However, it's also wise to be aware of ETH's drawbacks. Transferring it can be expensive, depending on when you do it. Fees vary according to the state of the network at the time and can be poor value for money for small amounts. It's possible that some casinos cover these fees for you and credit the amount to your account, however you would have to check the terms and conditions to be sure of this.</p>
<p>Using ETH, or any cryptocurrency also requires more work than fiat currencies. You need to buy it at a crypto exchange, then transfer it to a compatible digital wallet to buy things and make casino deposits. We'll look at how to do the latter in the next section.</p>
<p>Finally, Ethereum casinos are relatively rare compared to sites that accept Visa, Mastercard or even Bitcoin, so you may struggle to find one depending on where you live.</p>
<p>One thing we can say, though, is crypto casinos are growing in number, so don't be surprised to see the list grow in the future. Also, the use of other altcoins in online casinos is also on the rise, so the range of supported coins you can use to gamble online is now greater than ever.</p>
<p>How to use Ethereum in an online casino</p>
<p>If you'd like to use Ethereum to make an online casino deposit, then the process is straightforward as long as you have the right mechanisms in place. Here is a quick overview of the process.</p>
<p>First, make sure you have an open account in the casino of your choice: if you don't, it'll only take a few minutes to create one. Just make sure to choose wisely, as the casino you choose is likely to greatly influence your gambling experience. More on that later. Also, double-check that it accepts Ethereum and not just the old version Ethereum Classic.</p>
<p>Next, make sure you have Ether ready to transfer to the casino. Once you're certain, follow these steps:</p>
<p>Go to the cashier section in the casino and choose ETH as the payment method Copy the casino's wallet address Go to your wallet and paste the address into the 'Send' section and choose the amount you'd like to transfer Click confirm</p>
<p>ETH deposits are normally very quick, and the funds should appear in your casino accounts within a few minutes, although a busy network might delay the payment. If they don't show up after a few hours, then flag the issue up with either your wallet or the casino.</p>
<p>Withdrawing your funds back into your wallet isn't so simple and is subject to your casino and wallet's terms and conditions. However, if one is possible, then you'll follow a similar process, only in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>Finding the best Ethereum casino for you</p>
<p>With a growing number of casinos that accept Ethereum on the internet, it is now more important than ever to make the right choice when deciding where to gamble at. In this section of the article, we will help you use the list of best Ethereum casinos at the top of this page to choose wisely.</p>
<p>Firstly, pay attention to the Safety Index listed next to each Ethereum-friendly casino above. This is our own metric calculated based on a complex, data-driven process that takes into account important factors that influence the safety and fairness of online gambling, such as:</p>

<p>Complaints from players, which tell us how a casino treats its players and what types of issues they experience</p>
<p>Fairness of Terms and Conditions, which can be a clear indication of bad intentions or unfavorable rules that disadvantage players</p>
<p>Online casino blacklists</p>

<p>Bonuses offered by Ethereum casinos</p>
<p>Casino bonuses are extremely popular amongst players, and they are also offered by many Ethereum casinos. At the top of this page, you can see an offered bonus listed next to each casino – if it has any.</p>
<p>These bonuses can be of multiple types.</p>
<p>Some are given to new players absolutely for free, without having to deposit any ETH (or any other currency) into their accounts. These are also known as no deposit bonuses.</p>
<p>On the other hand, deposit bonuses are given to players for depositing funds into their accounts. These are usually larger, as they are not handed out completely for free.</p>
<p>To find bonuses offered by Ethereum casinos, browse the list above, or head to our database of online casino bonuses. There, you can use the 'Payment method' filter to only see bonuses offered by casinos that accept Ethereum.</p>
