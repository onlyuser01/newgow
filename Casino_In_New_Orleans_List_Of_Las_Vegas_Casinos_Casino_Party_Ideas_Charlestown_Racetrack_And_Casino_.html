QL Gaming’s offer includes BetQL for sports betting data, RotoQL for daily fantasy sports, AccuScore for game predictions and forecasts, and TennisInsight.com for analytical coverage of the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) and Women’s Tennis Associations (WTA) Tours. Each tool has its own subscriber base and licensing options.</p>
<p>Unparalleled Experience and Enhanced Digital Offering</p>
<p>BetQL delivers direct-to-consumer sports betting data which will reach nearly 30 million sports fans monthly through Entercom’s broadcasting network. Professional and beginner sports betting enthusiasts will have access to real-time sports data, news, and content across all audio and video devices.</p>
<p>Entercom Chairman and CEO David Field said in a statement that the acquisition of QL Gaming Group is “a perfect fit” for the live audio content giant, as the sports betting market is on the rise.</p>
<p>Thanks to this deal, Entercom will be able to deliver “unparalleled experiences” to sports fans, as well as a new subscription offering to their platform, Mr. Field added. The company’s technology portfolio will be upgraded with data and analytics, on track with Entercom’s plans to grow digitally.</p>

<p>$12 million in 2021</p>

<p>QLGG CEO Justin Park will report to Entercom president of sports Mike Dee and chief digital officer J.D. Crowley while continuing to lead the data provider.</p>
