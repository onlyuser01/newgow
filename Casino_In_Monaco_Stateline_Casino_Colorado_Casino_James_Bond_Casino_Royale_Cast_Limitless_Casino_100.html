    <h1>Casino In Monaco Stateline Casino Colorado Casino James Bond Casino Royale Cast Limitless Casino 100</h1>

<p>We caught up with Angelina Stasiuk, Head of Business Account Managers at SOFTSWISS Jackpot Aggregator, and discussed the company’s dedication to building consumer-focused and business-driven solutions that enhance financial performance as well as boost player satisfaction. Personalized jackpot experiences and tailored games are all part of what SOFTSWISS has to offer to its clients these days, guaranteeing strong results for partners. Find out more in our full interview with Stasiuk.</p>
<p>Q: It’s good to be catching up again with SOFTSWISS at such a great event. What are your impressions from the gathering, and what does SOFTSWISS expect to bring home from SBC Summit Barcelona 2023?</p>
<p>We are delighted to be part of the exhibition, as it serves as an excellent platform to connect with both potential clients and our existing partners. SBC Summit Barcelona has consistently proven to be a prime hub for networking, and we've found this experience to be truly enjoyable. We are optimistic that we will leave the event with valuable insights and forged partnerships. Besides, the conference agenda features industry professionals sharing expert insights on various topics. We look forward to bringing these insights back to our colleagues.</p>
<p>But we didn't come empty-handed, either! We've been preparing for this exhibition for a long time and have brought the best of SOFTSWISS with us, including our dedicated team, their extensive expertise, and our innovative products. By the way, one of our colleagues, Anastasiya Tsikhanava, recently shared her expertise on stage, highlighting the importance of effective player retention strategies.</p>
<p>Q: This all sounds very exciting! So, let’s begin our discussion by focusing on player engagement. It has been a prominent topic of interest this year, and SOFTSWISS has taken notable strides in this area. Could you please provide insights into the company's approach to player engagement and how you aim to enhance this metric for our partner operators?</p>
<p>At SOFTSWISS, we consistently monitor the market to understand player preferences and, as a consequence, to provide our clients with the best for their audiences. A lot of our solutions have been designed precisely to meet the needs of contemporary players: for example, the Tournament Tool developed by the SOFTSWISS Game Aggregator; a range of unique bonuses produced by the SOFTSWISS Sportsbook; and, of course, the SOFTSWISS Jackpot Aggregator, which I am proud to be a member of. This is a multifunctional solution that is specifically geared towards bolstering player engagement.</p>
<p>We design our solutions based on meticulous analyses of client needs and demands, paying close attention to such crucial factors as cultural nuances of the regions in which our clients operate and their players’ behaviour, as those significantly influence engagement rates. This approach effectively addresses client requests to enhance player engagement. We take into account not only the current state of their business but also external factors and industry conditions. Our extensive experience in the iGaming industry allows our team to cultivate a profound understanding of the market, unquestionably bolstering our capabilities.</p>
<p>Q: Now that you mention the Jackpot Aggregator, which has been a true innovator in the SOFTSWISS iGaming ecosystem, can you tell us more about the solution and its performance relative to your set benchmarks?</p>
<p>The SOFTSWISS Jackpot Aggregator is a tailored solution designed to address various challenges our clients face. It caters to their specific needs and objectives at different stages of their business. For example, it helps increase the total bet count, raise the average bet, and enhance online casino brand visibility through jackpot campaigns. Operators benefit from extensive customisation options, allowing them to create distinctive jackpot campaigns for their online casino players. Additionally, our technical support and dedicated business account managers are available throughout the campaign's lifecycle. This empowers operators to gain deeper insights into player preferences, enhance engagement and loyalty, and, ultimately, boost the commercial performance of their businesses.</p>
<p>As to the actual numbers – or benchmarks – we recently published a case study with our client, LevelUp online casino, where we reflected on the results of jackpot campaigns. According to the case study, the average number of active players surged by 40% within just one month of the campaign's launch.</p>
<p>Speaking of other results, the Jackpot Aggregator already powers more than 65 client brands, and in Q2 2023, the solution facilitated jackpot bets totalling up to EUR 1,357bn. These figures underscore the scale of the Jackpot Aggregator's operations and demonstrate the high level of player engagement and loyalty it helps drive across online casinos. So, I think the numbers speak for themselves at this point.</p>
<p>Q: Can we expect any new features and developments from the SOFTSWISS Jackpot Aggregator? For example, new types of jackpots?</p>
<p>Indeed, we are committed to staying attuned to player preferences and supporting our clients' business. So, we have a lot of exciting features in the pipeline, not all of which we can reveal right now. However, I can share one of them. It’s the Network Jackpot, whose pool is contributed by all participants of a jackpot campaign. In this way, online casinos will be able to offer bigger prizes for their players, boosting engagement.</p>
<p>Q: We have already seen you embark on some interesting initiatives such as the integration between the Game Aggregator &amp; the Jackpot Aggregator. You have already connected the first client via this integration. Could you tell us more about this integration's benefits to operators and how it strengthens the SOFTSWISS product ecosystem?</p>
<p>Indeed, we have successfully integrated these two solutions, and this pivotal integration opens up new horizons for clients utilising the Game Aggregator. Now, they can effortlessly initiate fully customised and personalised jackpot campaigns without any additional complexities. In essence, when they submit a request to us, we manage all the necessary settings. And yes, you are correct, we have already signed our first client, and it has been a very successful integration. We will be announcing new connections very soon, so stay tuned!</p>
<p>Q: Alright, and what is next for the SOFTSWISS Jackpot Aggregator and the company in 2023 and beyond?</p>
<p>Of course, we will continue to improve our projects, systems, and platforms. We are set to enhance the Network Jackpot's capabilities, making it accessible to the Game Aggregator clients through our cross-product integration. Additionally, the introduction of jackpot campaigns on sports betting platforms, facilitated by our integration with the SOFTSWISS Sportsbook earlier this year, has garnered substantial demand. The performance metrics with current clients have been promising.</p>
<p>As to the company, we will continue strengthening our presence in Europe and LatAm. And, of course, we will continue to provide an excellent level of service to our clients, leveraging our accumulated expertise and innovative technologies.</p>
