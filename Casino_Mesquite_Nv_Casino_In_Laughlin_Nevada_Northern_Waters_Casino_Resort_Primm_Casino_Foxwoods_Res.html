<p>International Game Technology has improved the efficiency of its carbon footprint policy, receiving a B score from CDP</p>
<p>International Game Technology (IGT) has received an improved, higher-than-average score from the environmental non-profit company for successfully addressing the impact of its business and improving its environmental management.</p>
<p>“Steadfast Commitment to Sustainability”</p>
<p>IGT’s score, which is higher than the company’s rating received in 2021, came from CDP’s assessment of how the gaming company managed to limit its carbon footprints. This was achieved by IGT sharing crucial information regarding its efforts to lower its carbon footprints.</p>
<p>IGT’s senior vice president, marketing, communications, and sustainability, Wendy Montgomery, explained that the company had “made great strides” to enhance its environmental efforts in the last years. Montgomery also explained that IGT was well-aware that they are directly responsible to generate action plans that would help cut their carbon footprint.</p>
<p>The company’s commitment to helping to put a stop to the devastating climate change has been extended to their customers as well as their own sustainable operations, added the SVP.</p>
<p>The fresh B score from CDP is meant to assure all of IGT’s stakeholders that the company plans to keep advancing using its “steadfast commitment to sustainability.”</p>
<p>What Are CDP Scores?</p>
<p>CDP scores offer quick snapshots of companies’ disclosure and environmental performance. With the help of this scoring, companies can start taking important environmental action by accurately and transparently assessing the impact of their businesses on the environment.</p>
<p>CDP scores explain the way companies together with stakeholders are doing in their efforts to be aligned with a 1.5-degree future with zero deforestation and safe water. When companies choose to fully and openly disclose their progress over the course of consecutive years, they can get a better understanding of their environmental journey’s direction.</p>
<p>The not-for-profit charity’s scoring methodology is completely synchronized with the Taskforce for Climate-Related Financial Disclosures along with other critical environmental standards. This means it can offer a relevant comparable dataset across all markets.</p>
<p>Disclosure is the main driver for action. When companies are scored from D- to A, CDP carries them on a journey from disclosure via awareness and management, culminating with leadership.</p>
<p>A company that has received an A score has not, however, reached the end of its journey. The highest score means that the respective company counts among the most transparent operators in terms of climate change performance and disclosure, along with water security and deforestation.</p>
<p>IGT kickstarted 2023 by signing an important RGS IP alliance with Greentube, partnering with UBetOhio while filing a lawsuit against the UK Gambling Commission in relation to the fourth National Lottery license.</p>
