<p>Amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in the US, while Nevada extends the stay-at-home order, Wynn Resorts is taking action to help the company’s employees.</p>
<p>Growing COVID-19 Pandemic Keeps Casinos Closed till End of April</p>
<p>Wednesday, 1st of April – Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak announced the extending of the stay-at-home order through April.</p>
<p>The order being pushed by the COVID-19 outbreak was initially announced on March 17 for a 30-day period. With the current extension on the order, directives remain the same, only the timeline changes.</p>
<p>All non-essential businesses, schools and casinos will have to remain closed at least until April 30. With total of more than 240,000 reported COVID-19 cases, the US is now on the top of the chart with active cases of the virus.</p>
<p>Of those active cases, 6,000 patients have died and more than 10,000 have already recovered. Amid the ongoing pandemic, Wynn’s announced their plan on the same day that Gov. Sisolak extended the stay-at-home order.</p>
<p>Wynn Resorts Show a Friendly Plan for Their Employees</p>
<p>Back in March, Wynn Resorts CEO Matt Maddox said:</p>
<p>“I can’t imagine going out (to) rehire and retrain 13,000 people. I’d rather keep the knowledge and experience that we have now in the service standards“.</p>
<p>Wynn’s most recent move only confirms the company’s strategy and plan to overcome the pandemic and keep employees on, rather than dismiss them in these difficult times. And while many other companies chose to furlough or dismiss their employees, this wasn’t Wynn’s idea of going through the pandemic.</p>
<p>Some 15,000 of their employees will receive payment through May 15. A scheme was even implemented for Wynn’s employees who relied mainly on the tips and the plan for them is to receive their average tips distributed monthly since the beginning of 2020.</p>
<p>Good Deeds don’t Remain Unnoticed</p>
<p>Wynn Resorts announcement did not go unnoticed online. Outburst of positive comments on Twitter clearly showed society’s response appreciating the care that Wynn showed for their employees.</p>
<p>Amid the layoff of millions of Americans – $Wynn 's CEO @MattMaddox insists it makes good financial sense to keep paying employees, even when the money isn't coming in. But- he says- the govt has to help on that front, especially small businesses. https://t.co/jdsFuJw9a1? — Contessa Brewer (@contessabrewer) March 24, 2020</p>
<p>CEO Matt Maddox is clearly leading by example as back in March he agreed to forego his entire salary for 2020 in exchange for shares. This move shows an effective method to redistribute funds towards other expenses and employees.</p>
<p>But Maddox did not stop there. He had further discussion with the executives and chairs for them to follow his example and swap partial salaries.</p>
