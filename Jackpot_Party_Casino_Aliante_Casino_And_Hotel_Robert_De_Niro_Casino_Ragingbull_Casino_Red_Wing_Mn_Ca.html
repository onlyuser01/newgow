    <h1>Jackpot Party Casino Aliante Casino And Hotel Robert De Niro Casino Ragingbull Casino Red Wing Mn Ca</h1>

<p>Dear Radka ,</p>
<p>Thank you for you kind answer. I went through terms and conditions and also confirmed with my brother that he has an account in another casino belonging to the same group. In case name of the casino is needed I can provide. My cousin on the other hand did have an account in this casino but it was blocked ( as I mentioned upon his request) in July 2022. With my cousin we have the same first and last name which might be weird but that you can blame on our parents. My question now is this: You have two accounts, one that has been blocked half a year ago and one that was created fairly recently. Is there a chance those can be considered duplicates? And in the case of me and my brother, can that be considered a case of duplicate accounts? If yes shouldn't I be provided more info by the casino? And why was the check not made during deposits ( since we shared the payment method) and only after a lot of money was deposited and only after the withdrawal request? In terms and conditions it says that in case of duplicate accounts all transactions are considered void. Does that mean that my deposits are considered void as well? Sorry about the long email but I am at loss here. I repeat that the only bonus used was the welcome bonus which was lost. All the gains were a result of a normal deposit with no bonuses. I appreciate the help. If needed I can also sent the chat transcripts with CS where I was told that I would be reimbursed for my withdrawals but no action was taken after that.</p>
