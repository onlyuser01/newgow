<p>The player, who reportedly participated at the final table of a tournament at Beau Rivage Casino in Biloxi has entered under an alias by using his first and middle name, Michael Lawrence.</p>
<p>Mike Postle Returns to Live Poker under an Alias</p>
<p>Angela Jordison, a professional poker player that became famous for coming close to the winner’s place of the GPI Female Player of the Year in 2022, posted on Twitter that Postle was seen at a final table tournament in Biloxi. Reportedly, Postle was playing under an alias for $200,000. Jordison’s post came along with a photo claiming that it’s Postle in a hoodie at a poker table.</p>
<p>According to the Hendon Mob, Postle has been an active poker player for nearly two decades now. His total live earnings from poker are near $600,000, while his best win from a live cash game brought him $118,743. Throughout his career, Postle has won nearly two dozen first places in different tournaments that brought him prizes that varied in size.</p>
<p>“Good Morning Twitter! Welcome to 2023! I woke up with a message from @Mawkswell “Unreal just played with Mike Postle he was using an alias floor confirmed it was him” Postle is in Biloxi. Final table resumes today…he is playing for 200k,” reads a Twitter post released by Angela Jordison</p>
<p>Overall, Postle had participated in more than 120 poker tournaments, but in 2019, he was accused of cheating. Back then, during Stones Live streams, allegations claimed that the professional poker player used a communication device.</p>
<p>Media reports at the time revealed that Stones Live commentator and poker player, Veronica Brill made the allegations against Postle. The poker pro rejected the claims and consequently never faced any charges. Still, after 2019, Postle has been quite discrete and avoided publicity whenever participating in tournaments. An alternative to participating in live tournaments, the poker pro likely participated in online games as well, which undoubtedly helped him keep a low profile since the unfortunate cheating accusation from 2019.</p>

<p>Considering the cheating accusations, poker fans on social media did not like the recent claims that Postle had made his return. One user under the name of “Eric” wrote on the topic: “Dude robbed TONS of people and gets to just live like it never happened. A true human s***bag if there ever was one.” This online user received a response from another poker fan nicknamed “Pete” who wrote: “Yea he’s living like it never happened buying into a MTT using his first &amp; middle name only while trying to conceal his face. Get a clue. He knows best what happened &amp; he’s living with the consequences every day.”</p>
