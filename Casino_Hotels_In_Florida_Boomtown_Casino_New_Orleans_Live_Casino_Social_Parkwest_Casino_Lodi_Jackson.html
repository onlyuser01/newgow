<p>ESA Gaming has reinforced its African footprint by inking a content-focused deal with the Nigerian operator betBonanza.</p>
<p>ESA Gaming, a provider of innovative casino games, has made a foray into Nigeria thanks to a deal that will see it supply the gaming and sports betting operator betBonanza with content.</p>
<p>BetBonanza Secures Content from ESA Gaming</p>
<p>As a fast-growing company, betBonanza is always looking to enhance its content offering by adding more games. In addition, the company realizes the importance of innovation and is always looking to secure the most novel titles for its platform.</p>
<p>Under the agreement, ESA Gaming will power the operator’s Nigerian offering with many games, including its hit EasySwipe series. The EasySwipe games are lightweight titles that are well-suited for mobile devices, making them perfect for the Nigerian market.</p>
<p>The content that betBonanza will receive includes performers such as Wild Vegas, Fruitz&amp;Spinz, Basketball Mine and Goal Mine. In addition to that, betBonanza will receive access to the acclaimed Rocket Racers game, which is ESA Gaming’s first crash-style title.</p>
<p>BetBonanza was founded in 2019 and has quickly cemented itself as one of the top online bookmakers in Nigeria. This growth can be attributed to the operator’s dedication to providing its customers with a rich selection of slots, casino table games, instant titles and crash-style experiences.</p>
<p>The addition of ESA Gaming titles to betBonanza’s already strong content lineup will further bolster the company’s popularity, helping it grow in the Nigerian market. ESA Gaming, on the other hand, will get to further expand its African footprint.</p>
<p>ESA Gaming Is Bullish on Growing Its African Presence</p>
<p>BetBonanza’s chief operating officer, Gatis Licitis, commented on the new agreement, saying that his company will continue adding more new titles to its casino offering. Licitis said that the company could not find a better partner than ESA Gaming and applauded the company’s products for their quality.</p>
<p>Their (ESA Gaming’s) titles offer fantastic cross-sell opportunities, and the quick-fire nature resonates well with our customers. We look forward to working together to further gain ground in the Nigerian market. Gatis Licitis, COO, BetBonanza</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Thomas Smallwood, ESA Gaming’s head of marketing, reaffirmed his company’s intention to expand in Africa. He noted that ESA Gaming is bullish on promoting its EasySwipe portfolio in the region, believing it is perfectly suited for local players’ preferences.</p>
<p>Smallwood praised betBonanza as a strong brand that is emerging as a leading Nigerian gambling company. The head of marketing concluded that the provider is happy to bring its titles to the operator’s platform and excite its growing customer base.</p>
