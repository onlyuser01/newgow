    <h1>Casino Fort Lauderdale Golden Dragon Online Casino Seneca Buffalo Creek Casino Lucky Star Casino Osa</h1>

<p>Netherlands vs United States is the first game of the knockout phase of the 2022 World Cup. It’s on the program on Saturday at 10 a.m. (Eastern Time) at Khalifa International Stadium in Doha.</p>
<p>The Dutch got themselves into the round of 16 after finishing top of Group A with two wins and a draw. The USMNT qualified for the second stage of the tournament after finishing second in Group B with two draws and one win.</p>
<p>The decisive win happened in the final round of the group phase when Christian Pulisic’s goal brought them a win over Iran. Unfortunately, the goal scorer got injured during that drive and is questionable for the Netherlands vs United States game. Can the USMNT pull off a big upset without their best player being 100% fit? Let’s find out!</p>

<p>Louis Van Gaal’s Army Already Thinking About the Quarterfinals</p>
<p>If the Dutch win this game, they’re going to advance to the quarterfinals where they’ll play against the winner of Argentina vs Australia game. Obviously, it’s very likely that it’s gonna be Messi &amp; Co., which needs to worry Louis Van Gaal’s men.</p>

<p>On the bright side, the Dutch have been doing okay in this tournament, especially at the back. They’ve conceded just one goal so far, which isn’t surprising knowing that their defensive line is made up of elite players – Virgil Van Dijk, Nathan Ake, Jurrien Timber, Denzel Dumfries, and Dailey Blind.</p>
<p>Their midfield and flanks are also decent, with Cody Gakpo being the standout player so far. Although he usually plays in the winger role in his club, Louis Van Gaal’s been putting him up in the front, which seems to be working. The evidence is that the PSV player is the one who’s scored 60% of the Dutch goals in this World Cup. We expect him to score once again.</p>
<p>Herculean Task Awaits USMNT’s Offense</p>
<p>The Americans have a score differential of 2-1 so far, keeping a clean sheet in two games. This shows that their defenders (helped by their tireless midfielders) have been doing a fine job. Their offense, on the other hand, hasn’t been too productive.</p>
<p>Timothy Weah was the one who scored the first goal against Wales. The USMNT’s second goal in the tournament happened in the game against Iran when Christian Pulisic found the net.</p>
<p>CHRISTIAN PULISIC TELEMUNDO GOAL CALL IS ELECTRIC!!! ⚡️ pic.twitter.com/Purrm5ozsw — DraftKings (@DraftKings) November 29, 2022</p>
<p>Chelsea’s forward is their key man, but he’s struggling with an injury and it’s uncertain whether he’ll start the game against the Netherlands. With or without him in the starting XI, the Americans are bound to struggle to score.</p>
<p>Netherlands vs United States Prediction</p>
<p>The Dutch are favored for a reason. Their players are way better than those playing for the United States, which is why anything but a win in normal time would be a huge shock. That said, we do not expect the Netherlands to destroy America. Instead, we expect to see a modest win for Van Gaal’s team.</p>
<p>Picks: Netherlands to win; under 2.5 goals</p>
