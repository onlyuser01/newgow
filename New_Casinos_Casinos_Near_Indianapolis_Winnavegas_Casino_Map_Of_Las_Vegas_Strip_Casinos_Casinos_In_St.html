<p>FC Porto Doing Great at Home</p>
<p>All Portuguese teams are famously good when playing home. FC Porto, for example, won eight straight home games from Boxing Day 2022 to February 26, 2023.</p>
<p>Their superb run at Estadio do Dragao came to an end when they lost 2-1 to Gil Vicente, in a game in which they received two red cards and had one goal disallowed for offside. That said, we can’t count that loss as a serious failure.</p>
<p>They also did great in home matches in the group phase of the Champions League, collecting six points from wins over Atletico Madrid and Bayern Leverkusen. They did get hammered 4-0 by Club Brugge at home but that was back in September.</p>
<p>Porto’s first home game in the Champions League in 2023 is on the program this Tuesday and The Dragons have high hopes. Let’s see if Inter Milan are going to crush their dreams.</p>
<p>Inter Milan Dreaming Big</p>
<p>It’s been 13 years since an Italian club won the Champions League the last time. The team that did it was Inter Milan. Since then, Nerazzurri haven’t been too impressive on the continent. Even in 2023, not many consider them serious candidates for the trophy. However, they do have a roster worth admiring.</p>
<p>Inter Milan’s squad looks incredibly strong with at least one world-class player for every position on the pitch. Their form this season has been okay, both domestically and in the UCL.</p>
<p>They’re the reigning champions of Serie A but will probably finish second this season due to Napoli’s incredible run. That gives them extra motivation to try and go as far as possible in the Champions League.</p>
<p>FC Porto vs Inter Milan Prediction</p>
<p>FC Porto might not be as strong as Inter Milan in terms of player quality, but they’re not far behind. Plus, they play at home. Does this mean they’re going to win on Tuesday? They might, but probably not by a high margin.</p>
<p>We think the Portuguese will score, but Inter Milan will fight back, which is why “both teams to score” looks like a banker. When it comes to the match-winner, we’d go with a draw in this case.</p>
<p>Pick: FC Porto and Inter Milan to draw; both teams to score</p>
