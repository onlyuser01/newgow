<p>Penn National Launches Test for Its New Barstool Sportsbook App in Pennsylvania</p>
<p>Tuesday, September 8, Penn National Gaming Inc. announced that the company plans to soft launch its new Barstool Sportsbook mobile app in Pennsylvania. The announcement came following the approval of the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board (PGCB) for a real money live test period. The company intends on launching the test for the period September 15-17, while a final iOS approval is still pending.</p>
<p>Although there are pending regulatory approvals after the test period Penn National plans to officially launch the Barstool Sportsbook app in Pennsylvania on September 18. Furthermore, the operator shared its plans to increase its presence in other states by launching the Barstool Sportsbook app in the months to come.</p>
<p>Within the test period of the new Barstool Sportsbook mobile app, a limited amount of participants who have already registered will be able to make real money bets. This limited number of punters will also have access to all of the features and functionalities of the new app. Penn National also said that it will continue to work with the regulators and test the systems. If necessary, the operator will make refinements before the official launch.</p>
<p>An Important Milestone</p>
<p>In a statement, Jay Snowden, President and CEO of Penn National said: “The Barstool Sportsbook app is the centerpiece of our Company’s omni-channel strategy.” Snowden outlined that the company worked hard together with Barstool Sports since their exclusive sports betting partnership in January.</p>
<p>According to him, the “marketing and operations teams have worked hand-in-hand with Barstool’s top talent” aiming at creating a unique sports betting experience. Snowden said that the new sports betting product will appeal to the “Barstool’s army of loyal followers” but it will also increase the company’s sports betting fans.</p>
<p>Penn National’s CEO and President thanked the Pennsylvania regulator and its staff for their time and effort in approving the app’s soft launch. Also, Snowden thanked the tireless team of Penn Interactive and the company’s great partners at Barstool Sports. According to him, the product is the result of many months of collaboration. Furthermore, Snowden thanked the risk management and platform providers Kambi and White Hat Gaming.</p>
<p>Snowden deemed the current launch as an “important milestone” and said that the company continues to evolve into a “leading omni-channel provider of retail and online gaming, live racing and sports betting entertainment“. In conclusion, he said that Penn National couldn’t be more excited.</p>
