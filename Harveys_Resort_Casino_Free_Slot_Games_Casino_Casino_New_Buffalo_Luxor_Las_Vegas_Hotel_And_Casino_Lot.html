    <h1>Harveys Resort Casino Free Slot Games Casino Casino New Buffalo Luxor Las Vegas Hotel And Casino Lot</h1>

<p>Dear Kristina</p>
<p>First of all my apologises for the abusive language. But my nerves...</p>
<p>I see the internet full of bad reviews, on every forum I check I only read player never get their money back!</p>
<p>I even didnt won really something as 1000.- Eur are my own deposits! But they are closing me every single chat in front of my noise: TIME IS OVER - I HAVE TO LEAVE permanent and gone they are. NOW they even blocked my IP to can use the live chat function on their site. I sent over 25 emails and not 1 person answer.</p>
<p>RIGHT: They ask an address proof in ENGLISH! But is this a BIG JOKE ???</p>
<p>I had in my life in over 10 years 100s of accounts, where I had to make a KYC and Im exactly aware of it how to let me verify! I can name you here all casinos over the whole internet which exist, I know so many licences, I was so many times in contact with MGA Malta. Im really 100% aware what it needs for a successfull verification.</p>
<p>The point is follows to understand it better:</p>
<p>Before I opened the account on BETFLIP I went in the chat and asked, how its about WITHDRAWALS - ah no problem amounts till 2000 Eur goes within 30 Minutes, and NO VERIFICATION is a need if you play with BTC!</p>
<p>I asked this 3 times, before I decided to open an account. As in the Netherlands Neteller, Skrill, Paysafe, Trustly was getting restricted trough the state of Netherlands (but now seems that they can offer again the services for players) - I maked a BTC wallet. I never had to do in my life with BTC!</p>
<p>The offer what I received was deposit 500 Eur and you get 100 Eur CASH WITHOUT RESTRICTION - 1 x WAGER your AMOUNT that was the only condition! So I have deposit 500 Eur with BTC and received accordingly 100 Eur CASH - I played logical my amount 1 time trough and LOST it. I went couple hours in the chat and asked if that offer can be done again, yes they was so kind and offered me for another 500 Eur to give me 100 Eur in cash, I deposited this and won luckyli my money back and additional 300 Eur on top - so that is the actual situation I have 1300 Eur (1000 Eur own money and 300 Eur win) and the amount was played more then 1 time trough, what was the only condition!</p>
<p>After that I tried to withdrawal - BOOM REJECTED !!! And they ask me to verify my account.</p>
<p>I ask why - as 3 agents told me deposit with BTC not need a verification, and they say sometimes well.</p>
<p>OK no problem I always will cooperate and directly have sent all what is a need.</p>
<p>Then they have let me wait for almost 5 days, even they sayd 72 hours. After that I receive an email your identity is verified - PLEASE SEND BANK STATEMENT OR UTILITY BILL IN ENGLISH !!! Since there 25 emails gets ignored!</p>
<p>I life in the Netherlands, a Dutch speaking country. The major language is not English, and the companys dont provide ENGLISH invoices, I asked my internet provider, my mobile phone provider, my bank, and not one of them is able to deliver me a ENGLISH WRITTEN INVOICE!</p>
<p>IN NO CASINO SINCE ALMOST 10 YEARS I EVER HAD TO DELIVER AN ADDRESS PROOF IN ENGLISH !!!</p>
<p>ADDRESS PROOF IS ADDRESS PROOF - MY ADDRESS NOT WILL CHANGE - IF THE DOCUMENT IS IN RUSSIAN, BULGARIAN, FRENCH, ITALIAN, ENGLISH, DUTCH, GERMAN - THE ADDRESS REMAINS THE SAME !!!</p>
<p>In my situation it is ya obvious that they not wanna give me MY MONEY back, that every normal human sees.</p>
<p>I have deposit proofs, all the data in my account are correct, all my invoices are official documents, my ID is correct, I even have sent a SELFIE where I hold my ID! In every other casino I needed alone the half of the documents. And in every other casino an address proof how I have sent it was always approved!</p>
<p>I CANT DELIVER AN ENGLISH ADDRESS PROOF WHEN I LIFE IN THE NETHERLANDS!</p>
<p>And in no casino that is so. As example if a JAPANESE guy go to play on a German casino you really think they ask him for a GERMAN address proof this guy never will have a German document!</p>
<p>Its obvious that every single document from me is legal, and its obvious that not one document is a fake, and that on almost 10 documents stands my correct address - BUT IN FACT I EVEN DEPOSITED WITH BTC - where a verification is NO NEED - www.betplay.io, www.fortunejack.com, www.betbeard.com - not one of those BTC casino ever wanted any document!</p>
<p>But I always will send all what is a need to get my money! BUT THIS LINE ADDRESS PROOF IN ENGLISH - is just FACT they not wanna pay my money back! I will send you all my proof directly on your email, and you will see and know that here is nothing wrong on all!</p>
<p>I not understand how human can do this, it is 1 salary from me and I need to pay my bills! I have a daughter and a high pregnant girlfriend!</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
