<p>Luckbox finds a new chief customer officer with Electronic Arts veteran Thomas Rosander stepping in.</p>
<p>EA Executive Thomas Rosander Steps in as Luckbox COO</p>
<p>Real Luck Group is bringing more executive talent to the fore with the appointment of Thomas Rosander, a former Dunder and Mr Green veteran and Electronic Arts c-level executive. Now, Rosander will help RLG with engagement and reach as Luckbox’s new chief customer officer, the company’s esports betting brand.</p>
<p>Tapping into his vast experience as head of various business departments across numerous industry entities, Rosander perfectly understands the subtleties of gambling and gambling.</p>
<p>Commenting on the appointment, Real Luck Group CEO Quentin Martin said that Rosander brings a lot of industry experience and relationships, which will allow Luckbox to develop the platform’s offer further. Growth is clearly a buzz word in 2021 for the company, and Martin has confirmed as much:</p>
<p>“We have big plans for growth in 2021 and beyond, and Thomas will play a leading role in helping us deliver on our targets. This is a key role in growing our business and I am delighted to have someone of Thomas’s caliber on board.” -Group CEO Quentin Martin</p>
<p>Rosander’s own enthusiasm about the platform was shared as part of the official announcement. He defined Luckbox as one of the most exciting entities in the iGaming space and shared his excitement to be joining the organization.</p>
<p>Rapid growth and huge potential for esports betting is what Rosander predicts for the industry moving forward. In his position, he will be committed to ensuring that Luckbox stays at the forefront of industry developments.</p>
<p>He is not the only executive to strengthen the executive talent pool at Luckbox. The company recently recruited Lachlan Thomas, a veteran from Unikrn, another cutting-edge esports betting platform that uses its own token to add exclusivity to the segment.</p>
<p>The company also secured Ran Kaspi, a former 888 veteran, as a chief financial officer, and the growth continues unchecked in 2021.</p>
