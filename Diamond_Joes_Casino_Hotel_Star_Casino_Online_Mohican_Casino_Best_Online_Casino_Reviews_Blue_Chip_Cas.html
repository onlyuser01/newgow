<p>Pirate's Pub review</p>
<p>Pirates Pub is a pirate-themed slot game designed and developed by Pragmatic Play.</p>
<p>The slot is based around a pub that plays host to a bunch of rowdy pirates that have just returned from a spot of plundering and high-seas mayhem.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>Nautical and pirate-themed slots can go one of two ways. Darker-themed slots like Stormforged depict the high-seas as a brutal place, but titles like Pirates Pub go for the opposite approach. The game has a really fun, cartoonish design, with the reels being situated right in the centre of the titular pub. A group of ragtag pirates appear as bonus symbols, and the game has a swashbuckling and cheery soundtrack.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Pirates Pub is not out to reinvent the wheel with its base game. The slot uses five reels and three rows, with nine active paylines on every spin.</p>
<p>The slot uses the same layout as other Pragmatic Play slots, with the stake adjustment options on either side of the spin button and the autospin option just underneath. Players can also buy their way into the bonus rounds by using the Buy Bonus feature for 70x their overall stake.</p>

<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The main bonus in the Pirates Pub slot game is a Free Spins round that launches when you land three or more Wild symbols. Three Wilds can reward 5-8 spins, four can trigger 8-11 spins, and five can trigger 11-15 spins. The number of spins you will get is randomly chosen.</p>
<p>The bonus plays out in two stages. During the first stage, the triggering Wilds will leave highlighted spots on the grid. If a Wild lands on this during the spin, it is upgraded. It is possible to upgrade each symbol five times.</p>
<p>Once you have worked through the original spins, between 2-5 spins are then randomly awarded for the second stage. For this bonus, all of the highlighted positions will display a Sticky Wild. These will display a multiplier of up to x5 depending on how upgraded they were in the first stage. If there are several Wilds in a winning combination, the multipliers will be added together.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>Pirates Pub serves up some nice winning potential. The maximum win in the slot is a solid 5,000x your stake. The game’s RTP is 96.03%, which puts it around average and makes it perfect for our slot strategy. Pragmatic Play has rated it 5/5 for volatility.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Pirates Pub is a solid online slot from Pragmatic Play. While it doesn’t offer anything that you might not find elsewhere, it features a charming design and some engaging action. The two stages of the free spins keep things interesting, while a 5,000x maximum win is sure to please some players.</p>
