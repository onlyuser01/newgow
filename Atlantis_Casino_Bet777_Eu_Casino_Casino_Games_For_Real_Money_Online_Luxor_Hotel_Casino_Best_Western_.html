    <h1>Atlantis Casino Bet777 Eu Casino Casino Games For Real Money Online Luxor Hotel Casino Best Western</h1>

<p>Leap Gaming will distribute its content of award-winning casino games on iGaming operator ComeOn Group’s network and specifically in the Nordics markets and any markets covered by the companies’ Malta Gaming Authority (MGA) license. The distribution will take place through the Powered by Relax platform owned by Relax Gaming.</p>
<p>Leap Gaming is an established name in the iGaming industry with a proven track record of developing leading gaming products that have been welcomed by hundreds of partners around the world. Leap Gaming currently holds a license from the Hellenic Gaming Commission and MGA, and its content is accessible via retail, web, and mobile platforms, depending on the licensing agreements in each individual jurisdiction.</p>
<p>One Small Partnership, One Giant iGaming Leap</p>
<p>Leap has both virtual sports and casino content available to customers. Moving forward, ComeOn Group’s players will be able to access the Leap Gaming product portfolio. ComeOn will further benefit from Leap Gaming and Relax’s unique features that lead to further engagement opportunities with customers.</p>
<p>ComeOn Group chief product officer Cristiano Blanco commented on the partnership, praising Leap Gaming’s established track record in building compelling products and distributing them to end customers. Games such as Secrets of the Nile, Party Fruit, and Gangstar are some of the best-known and appreciated titles by Leap, Blanco adds.</p>
<p>“I am very happy to have Leap powering our games portfolio. They are a fast-growing company with a focus on the needs of the customer, which you can see from the quality of their product. At ComeOn Group we are on a strong path and journey to deliver the best product to our customers.” ComeOn Group chief product officer Cristiano Blanco</p>
<p>Leap Gaming CEO Yariv Lissauer was equally thrilled to be forming this alliance with ComeOn. Lissauer confirmed that a big part of the present success was the partnership with Relax Gaming, which enabled the company to reach new brands and customers.</p>
<p>Relax Gaming CPO Simon Hammon argued that Leap Gaming’s focus on the smallest detail is precisely what allows the company to continue and win new brands and clients and for its products to appeal to a growing fan base.</p>
<p>Leap Gaming’s decision to use Relax Gaming as a gateway to more customers and markets is a testimony to Relax’s progress in establishing itself as a viable industry stakeholder, Hammon argues.</p>
