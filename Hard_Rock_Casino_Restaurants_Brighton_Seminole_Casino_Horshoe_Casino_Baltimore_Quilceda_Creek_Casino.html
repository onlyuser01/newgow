<p>The 2022-23 Premier League season kicks off on Friday, August 5 with a clash between two London teams – Crystal Palace and Arsenal.</p>
<p>The last time these two met at Crystal Palace’s Selhurst Park, the hosts won 3-0. This time, however, online sportsbooks think it’s going to be the other way around. They think the Gunners are going to beat the Eagles relatively easily.</p>
<p>Are the bookmakers right to think of Arsenal as the favorite or will we see Crystal Palace upset the odds once again? To see what we think, just keep on reading our preview of the Premier League opener!</p>

<p>Crystal Palace Love Playing at Home</p>
<p>Last season, the Eagles went 11-15-12 in the EPL (48 points), finishing in the #12 position. Their record at Selhurst Park was 7-8-4, with zero losses from February 19 to the end of the season. Actually, their undefeated home run continued in the off-season. But can it continue in the 2022-23 season?</p>
<p>Oddsmakers don’t think so, but the Eagles are encouraged by the fact that the last time they played Arsenal in South London (April 4), they totally dismantled the Gunners.</p>
<p>Arsenal did have the ball in their possession for more than two-thirds of the time, as well as two times more goal chances than Crystal Palace. However, the Eagles were just more clinical than them – they scored three without allowing a single goal.</p>
<p>Arsenal Have Learned Their Lesson</p>
<p>The average age of Arsenal’s starting XI in the 3-0 loss to Crystal Palace was under 25. Fast-forward to the 2022-23 season of the Prem and the Gunners have more experience, plus they got a couple of exciting new players on the rooster.</p>
<p>During the summer transfer window, Arsenal signed two players from Manchester City – Gabriel Jesus and Oleg Zinchenko – both of whom have plenty of experience playing big matches.</p>
<p>On top of that, a couple of players have returned from a loan, most notably defenders Hector Bellerin, Maitland-Niles Ainsley, Pablo Mari, and William Saliba. These guys seem good enough to stop Crystal Palace forwards from repeating their performance from the last season.</p>
<p>Crystal Palace vs Arsenal Prediction</p>
<p>Arsenal did great in the preseason, destroying a couple of heavyweights like Chelsea and Sevilla. Sure, those were friendlies, but the impressive wins have certainly made the Gunners more enthusiastic. That said, we expect these guys to start the 2022-23 season in top gear, grabbing a big win on their trip to South London.</p>
<p>Picks: Arsenal to win; over 2.5 goals</p>
