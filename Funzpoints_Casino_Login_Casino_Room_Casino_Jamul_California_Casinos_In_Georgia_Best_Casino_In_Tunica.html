<p>Stakelogic, a prominent supplier of casino content, has just secured its B2B supplier license in the Swedish iGaming market, and it has not wasted any time growing its local footprint. The company has announced a partnership with Glitnor Group, that has allowed it to forge ahead and launch its content with the operator’s brands, to wit Happy Casino and Lucky Casino in the country.</p>
<p>Moving forward, the players at both brands will benefit from an extensive selection of classic and video slots. The partnership covers both the land-based and online gaming sectors, and will allow Glitnor Group to considerably scale its offer in the market by adding innovative content to its library.</p>
<p>Among the games announced in the partnership are titles such as Runner Runner Megaways, Big RunnerDeluxe, Multi-Player, Multi6Player, and others. Players who are looking to enjoy a sound selection of titles that features Wilds, Free Spins, Multipliers, and more will be very happy to know that the games by Stakelogic bring this and more.</p>
<p>There are other awesome titles that Happy Casino and Lucky Casino will be offering to their players as well, including Money Track, Spartans vs ZombiesMegaways, Greedy Fox, Treasures of Ra and more. The partnership will also feature forthcoming releases and it will see added many innovative features by the company, including its signature Spin to Win and Super Stake mechanics.</p>
<p>Both features are interesting ways to improve the experience for players and add to the overall gameplay satisfaction. Commenting on this new chance to bring more content across both the land-based and online segments, Stakelogic Sales Manager Neil Tanti argued that both brands owned by Glitnor in Sweden are extremely popular and a great way for Stakelogic to start scaling its position in the regulated market.</p>
<p>"This allows us to sign deals such as this and to continue to establish Stakelogic as a leading supplier in Sweden and beyond," Tanti said with confidence.</p>
<p>Glitnor Group Head of Games Sven de Waard was similarly pleased with the opportunity and said that Stakelogic is a trailblazer in the regulated iGaming market, and that having its casinos added was an important achievement for the company itself.</p>
<p>Stakelogic recently acquired a license to provide content in Pennsylvania, United States, marking the beginning of the company’s North American expansion as well.</p>
