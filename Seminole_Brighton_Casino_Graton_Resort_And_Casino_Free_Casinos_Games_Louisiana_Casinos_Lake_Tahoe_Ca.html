    <h1>Seminole Brighton Casino Graton Resort And Casino Free Casinos Games Louisiana Casinos Lake Tahoe Ca</h1>

<p>where i mentioned the bonus and the deposit i was told in the live chat that the maximum payout is 10 times the deposit, i said this is real money and no bonus money, i was told that i should wait again 1 day later I contacted the live chat again and wanted to ask about the verification without mentioning it, I was suddenly told that I should make sure that the maximum profit is €920 with a deposit of €92, 10 times the deposit I was then told that I should cancel the payout of €1400 and pay out €920 and play the other €480 that was left over, which I was not allowed to pay out, then I did that and won almost €3000 with this €480 and I asked again in the live chat if I really shouldn't be allowed to pay it out. I was then told again that I wasn't allowed to because it still counts as a win from the bonus, albeit Even though it was real money and I had already implemented it for a long time, I was still told that I would not pay it out anyway, at some point I lost the money again and then asked again for my payout of €920 and I was told the verification that I have only paid out again that I should wait again whenever I address the verification they always say the same thing that they are sorry that this can be delayed and I ask you to continue to be patient I have never experienced anything like this maximum payment ok but if i convert the money into real money then i can keep winning and keep playing just like i can lose again why is it still not paid out on your site it says that i can pay out 10 times the bonus money and not from the deposit it says at casino guru on the beemcasino site it says 10 times the deposit, but i still have the bonus s money converted into real money and then continued to play so I was playing with real money and not with bonus money</p>
