<p>Steve Cutler, the chief executive officer and co-founder of Kalamba Games, also shared his thoughts on the matter. He said that delivering Kalamba’s varied and high-quality games and cutting-edge solutions to players is the company’s key growth strategy. Cutler added that the partnership with LeoVegas will help the studio enter the next phase of its journey.</p>
<p>Kalamba Is Bullish on Expanding in Europe</p>
<p>Kalamba Games’ proprietary slot titles and tech solutions have cemented it as one of the leaders in the global gambling industry. The company has successfully developed a proprietary remote game server and an analytics platform on top of a vast choice of various promotional tools.</p>
<p>Last month, Kalamba inked several partnerships with various gambling companies. At the beginning of the month, the studio teamed up with Betsson Group. Kalamba agreed to power Betsson’s 20+ brands in Europe and beyond. A few weeks later, the studio joined forces with 888casino and powered its platform with its slot games portfolio. A week ago, Kalamba Games expanded its footprint in Italy by signing a deal with Octavian Lab.</p>
