<p>Nikita Krylov Keeps Rising Through the UFC Light Heavyweight Ranks</p>
<p>Krylov’s UFC story started in 2018 and since he’s 4-4 in this promotion. That might not seem impressive, but all four of his UFC losses happened to elite fighters – Jan Blachowicz, Glover Teixeira, Magomed Ankalaev, and Paul Craig.</p>
<p>The fighters he defeated in the UFC are Ovince Saint Preux, Johnny Walker, Alexander Gustafsson, and Volkan Oezdemir. For his Round 1 KO win over Gustafsson, Krylov received the Performance of the Night bonus from the UFC.</p>
<p>This is an appreciation post for Nikita Krylov – A fighter who never fails to deliver, and has a stunning 93% finishes in 29 victories.</p>
<p>Krylov fights Ryan Spann next-next weekend. Who do you think will win?#mixedmartialart #mixedmartialartist #mma #ufc pic.twitter.com/thix2jhWTA — Mat from The Fight Fanatic (@fightfanatic_) February 15, 2023</p>
<p>It was his 12th win by this method, while he also has 15 wins by submission. That’s no surprise knowing that he’s got experience with several wrestling/grappling disciplines, including submission fighting and army hand-to-hand combat. The bad news for him is that Span has a similar set of skills.</p>
<p>Ryan Spann Ready to Upset the Odds</p>
<p>Ryan Spann is seen as the underdog in Saturday’s fight, but we don’t think this guy should be underestimated. The American is 21-7 overall with a 7-2 record in the UFC. He didn’t fight against as strong opponents as Krylov, but he does have some great wins in his portfolio.</p>
<p>For instance, last May, Spann defeated Ion Cutelaba by submission, which was his 12th win by this method. This isn’t a surprise knowing that he’s got extensive experience with Brazilian jiu-jitsu. He also has six wins by KO/TKO, as well as three by decision.</p>
<p>Nikita Krylov vs Ryan Spann Prediction</p>
<p>Nikita Krylov is the favorite for a reason, but this isn’t going to be an easy fight for him. Sure, the guy has 93% finishes in his career, but we suspect it could be different this time. Instead of Krylov winning quickly, we expect to see a real battle in Vegas, with the fight winner probably being decided by the judges.</p>
<p>Picks: Nikita Krylov to win by decision</p>
