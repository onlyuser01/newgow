    <h1>Casino In Rhode Island Hotels Near Golden Nugget Casino Lake Charles La Hotel St Louis Casino Chocta</h1>

<p>Intema Solutions continues to navigate the esports space, enacting a change at the top for one of its most prominent assets, the social gaming platform HyperX.gg. The Canadian esports and iGaming company has appointed Ty Root as the platform’s new chief executive officer. He will replace the outgoing CEO, Evan Ryer, who has chosen to pursue other career opportunities.</p>
<p>Boosting the Business Across the Board</p>
<p>As part of his new position, Root will improve the user experience and boost the company’s revenue. Root already has experience working in similar positions and has proven himself as a strong leader in delivering the desired results.</p>
<p>Root has used talented individuals to this end, creating groups of experts who have been able to create solutions that align with stated goals. Ryer himself welcomed Root’s appointment and said that he brings a vast and proven experience at the helm of HyperX.gg:</p>
<p>“Ty brings to the table a long list of skills and veteran expertise that will enable Intema to propel HypeX into an entirely new league within the esports tournament space.” HyperX.gg outgoing CEO Evan Ryer</p>
<p>Intema has been looking to expand its esports reach even further, specifically through subsidiaries such as Livestream Esports Limited. Intema received approval from the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) to proceed with the acquisition of Livestream. The acquisition was subject to an online gambling license by the Isle of Man, which the company received in December.</p>
<p>Intema Solutions Continue to Expand Esports Business</p>
<p>Previously, Intema managed to secure a license from the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario in November and became a fully-registered online gaming and sports wagering operator in Canada’s forefront gambling state.</p>
<p>Intema president and CEO Laurent Benezra also welcomed the appointment of Ty, arguing that his extensive experience in numerous areas would help bolster the HyperX.gg business. Team management, content strategy, production, and partnership building will all come into use when Root is at the helm of the company.</p>
<p>Previously, Intema acquired Team Bloodhound, seeking to continually expand its portfolio in competitive video gaming.</p>
