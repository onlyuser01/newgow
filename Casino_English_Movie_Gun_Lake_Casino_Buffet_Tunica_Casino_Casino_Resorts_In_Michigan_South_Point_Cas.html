<p>Incentive Games has teamed up with bet365, a prominent sportsbook, to launch a dedicated free-to-play game for the upcoming World Cup 2022 which will be kicking on Sunday, November 20. The partnership will offer players to take part in “Tournament Predictor” which will offer participants a chance to win real prizes by trying to predict which teams will do better in Qatar.</p>
<p>Incentive Games’ F2P Game Comes with a Solid Jackpot Payout</p>
<p>Every correct pick will grant players points with a £1 million jackpot waiting for them at the end of the road, should any player predict the entire tournament correctly. The top-scoring participant will take home £100,000. Then, the top 10,000 users will divvy up a £250,000 prize pool, which is definitely decent for a F2P game where you can test your knowledge of the game and understanding of soccer in general.</p>
<p>Incentive Games CEO and co-founder John Gordon has welcomed this opportunity and said that the company was delighted to offer an advanced game that will appeal to players and introduce them to the joys of betting with none of the risks. The executive added that the present F2P offer was the best game released to date by Incentive Games.</p>
<p>“If this is not the game with the most free-to-play entries for the World Cup, I will eat my kilt,” Gordon promised humorously. A spokesperson for bet365 issued a challenge to participants and rhetorically asked if they had what it took to predict the entire World Cup.</p>
<p>Free Games Are the Way to New Sports Bettors and Fans</p>
<p>“At bet365 we’re delighted to deliver this free-to-play game to our customers ahead of the tournament and look forward to watching those predictions unfold,” the person said in a statement. Free-to-play games have become all the rage in the newly regulated sports betting in the United States, but they are now spreading elsewhere.</p>
<p>These contests boost engagement for betting brands, raise their profiles, and seek to convert recreational sports bettors into consumers who are happy to spend some money on their predictions along the way. The World Cup is one of the most important events for betting companies and a way for them to secure new loyal customers. More than 20 million Americans are preparing to bet.</p>
