<p>The woman’s identity was released by police after an extensive investigation following the Dec. 29 incident. Officers continued to search for her late Thursday.</p>
<p>On the morning of Dec. 29, Ramos traveled in a taxi with the little girl to the Fashion Show Mall, and then walked to the Wynn casino, police said. Ramos was last seen walking away from the Wynn casino on Las Vegas Boulevard shortly before noon that day. She is believed to be the toddler’s mother.</p>
<p>The three-year-old girl is healthy. She was turned over to protective services.</p>
<p>Ramos in her middle to late 20s, approximately 5-feet, 5-inches tall, and weighs about 125 pounds. She was wearing a blonde wig tied into a ponytail when she allegedly left the child.</p>
<p>Ramos is “known to frequent casinos on the Strip and Downtown Las Vegas,” a Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department (LVMPD) officer told local news organizations.</p>
<p>Metro Officers Bring Little Girl Presents</p>
<p>Metro police officers continued to be concerned about the little girl since she was discovered. Officers went to visit her recently and brought her some gifts.</p>
<p>The abandonment of the girl was a reminder to the public that families can get assistance from social services and other agencies if they are struggling, police said last month.</p>
<p>“Remember, even during these most difficult times, help is available,” Las Vegas Metro police Lt. David Valenta told the Las Vegas Review-Journal last week. “All you have to do is ask.”</p>
<p>Woman Asked About Shelters, Police Said</p>
<p>While the two were in the cab that morning, the woman had asked the driver about the location of the nearest shelter, police said.</p>
<p>But often adults who leave children unattended at casinos do so to allow the adults to gamble. Children typically are not allowed on casino gaming floors.</p>
<p>Last February, a three-year-old autistic boy was left in a locked, unheated car for a half-hour while his father went into Lincoln, Rhode Island’s Twin River gaming venue to place sports bets. The father later was arrested for cruelty to or neglect of a child and obstructing an officer in the execution of duty.</p>
<p>Last January, a Texas couple was charged with child abandonment after they allegedly left a sleeping toddler in a running car while they played electronic gaming machines in a Texas gas station.</p>
<p>While the couple was inside, two teenagers saw the running car and allegedly stole it. Later, the alleged thieves left the child in Houston’s MacGregor Park. The pair were arrested.</p>
