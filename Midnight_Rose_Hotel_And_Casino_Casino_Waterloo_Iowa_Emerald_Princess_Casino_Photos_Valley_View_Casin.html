<p>By bringing everything together under the unified Betsson brand, the operator will be able to harness the power of consistency, scalability and synergy</p>
<p>Betsson Group has rebranded the Casino.dk site in Denmark as it seeks to popularize its brand. The site will now operate under Betsson’s name, allowing the group to expand its global presence. As a result, Betsson will now be able to optimize its resources and consolidate a singular strong brand identity.</p>
<p>With the Nordics being one of Betsson’s core markets, this move represents a significant step toward growing the brand’s international footprint. While the company’s NordicBet subsidiary will continue to operate in Denmark under its usual name, the rebranding of Casino.dk will familiarize Danish players and organizations with Betsson.</p>
<p>Operating as Betsson will provide a variety of advantages to the company, including marketing initiatives and sponsorship deals.</p>
<p>Speaking of marketing initiatives, the company just unveiled a new global marketing concept under the slogan “A Bet Makes the Difference.”</p>
<p>CCO Hartvig: The Rebranding Will Empower the Company</p>
<p>Ronni Hartvig, Betsson’s chief commercial officer, expressed his thoughts on the rebranding. He noted that Denmark is a very important market to his team, which is why Betsson Group is looking to consolidate its operation.</p>
<p>By bringing everything together under the unified Betsson brand, the operator will be able to “harness the power of consistency, scalability and synergy,” Hartvig said. He also said that the move will “empower” the company to optimize its resources, cultivate a brand identity and have a positive impact through marketing initiatives and partnerships.</p>
<p>Betsson Pulled Out from the Netherlands</p>
<p>A month ago, Betsson canceled its license application in the Netherlands, temporarily pulling out from the local market. While the company didn’t divest its Dutch assets, it decided to withdraw its application for the moment and reallocate its resources elsewhere.</p>
<p>The decision, Betsson said at the time, was caused by significant delays in the licensing process and “resource allocation considerations” because of opportunities in other markets. However, the company added that it might reapply for a license in the future.</p>
<p>In other news, Betsson recently secured content from Pragmatic Play for its Betsafe brand. As agreed, the provider rolled out roulette in Spanish language on the operator’s platform, allowing it to engage Spanish-speaking customers with localized live casino content.</p>
