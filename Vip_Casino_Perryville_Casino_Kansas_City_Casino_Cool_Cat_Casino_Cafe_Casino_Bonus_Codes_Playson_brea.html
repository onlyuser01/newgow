<p>As Ontario has successfully completed its first quarter of regulated iGaming, the influx of companies looking to secure a license and entry into the market has not subsided. The latest to probe the waters in the Canadian province is Playson, a fast-growing digital entertainment supplier, which has been just granted a license to enter the online gaming arena.</p>
<p>Playson has cleared the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario (AGCO)’s prerequisites, enabling the company to become a fully-fledged member of the regulated iGaming ecosystem in the province, it announced on its website. As a result, Playson will be able to deliver on a host of games that are developed in-house and can provide licensed operators in Ontario with the means necessary to have their products stand out. Playson CCO Tamas Kusztos has welcomed this opportunity:</p>
<p>"We’re thrilled to have entered the iGaming market in Ontario, allowing us to meet our elevated growth plans and expand outside of Europe."</p>
<p>Playson is bringing a whole lot of games as well, including some of its best-in-class slots, such as Buffalo Power: Hold and Win, Royal Coins: Hold and Win and Legend of Cleopatra Megaways. There are dozens of other games available, with the Megaways and Hold and Win mechanic becoming all the rage in iGaming circles these days.</p>
<p>This is not all, as Playson’s offer has evolved to provide operators with excellent content, but also the tools necessary to monetize and gamify these titles in the first place. As a result, Playson is able to run captivating tournaments and leverage tools such as its Cash Blast random cash prize awards.</p>
<p>All of this leads to better customer retention and engagement with players. Growth has been uppermost on Playson’s mind and its latest breakthrough in the Ontario iGaming market attests to the company’s product and offer which has been able to penetrate several continents and is now reachable in 20 regulated markets across Africa, Europe, Latin America, and now North America.</p>
<p>Payson is committed to expanding beyond its bastions and domestic markets in Europe and continuing to build forward. Playson general counsel Andrei Andronic welcomed the news in a similarly upbeat fashion and said that the granting of the Ontario license was the result of months of hard work and persistent efforts. The achievement itself is an important milestone for the company as it embarks on a new journey in the North American market and seeks to secure stronger positions locally and globally.</p>
