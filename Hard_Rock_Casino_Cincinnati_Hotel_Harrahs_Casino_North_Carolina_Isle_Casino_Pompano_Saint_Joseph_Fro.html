    <h1>Hard Rock Casino Cincinnati Hotel Harrahs Casino North Carolina Isle Casino Pompano Saint Joseph Fro</h1>

<p>Dear player,</p>
<p>I bet you're confusing two things together. Not a single casino (anonymous casinos excluded) allows the player to create multiple accounts; this is a well-known business standard.</p>
<p>Of course, you can create one account at every casino within the same group. The golden rule says: One account per casino - not a group.</p>
<p>I hope it is now clear.</p>
<p>And for the complaint, I suggest you pay attention to the instructions üôè:</p>
<p>"How long will it all take?</p>
<p>The time elapsed between submitting a complaint and the complaint being closed varies greatly. The complaints processed most quickly are those that can be resolved without getting the casino involved or those that are rejected because the casino has not done anything wrong. Other complaints, however, can be very time-consuming.</p>
<p>Here are some rough estimates and time-related information about complaints:</p>
<p>You will get your first response from our complaint team within 48 hours, but we do our best to respond within 12 to 24 hours.</p>
<p>Each involved party (you, the casino, or the Casino Guru team) has seven days to respond when they are required to do so to move the complaint forward. When this period elapses without a response, we usually choose to prolong the time limit by another seven days.</p>
<p>As the successful resolution of a complaint often takes a lot of communication between all three parties, the total time can add up. The average time it takes to close successfully-resolved complaints is roughly 21 days from the date they were submitted, but again, this varies a lot from one complaint to another.</p>
<p>We do everything we can to resolve complaints as quickly as possible, but it's not always a straightforward process. Please be patient and provide all the necessary information to speed things up on your side."</p>
