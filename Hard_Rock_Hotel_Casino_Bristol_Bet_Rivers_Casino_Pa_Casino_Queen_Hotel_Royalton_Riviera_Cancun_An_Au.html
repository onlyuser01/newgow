<p>ok well still i have to disagree with you. Self-exclusions should never be lifted for any reasons if i put a timer for it for 1-year. I mean there is no point on self-exclusions otherwise and i have checked with other casinos no one will lift you're self-exclusions for any reason and this is also in MGA licence, UK gambling licence rules aswel on the estonian licence rules because of gambling addiction and its nature is that people will do anything to gamble if they are let to and if i choose 1year self-exclusions it should be 1 year no matter what. Also i am not asking back the 2000e deposited only the 500e AFTER i lost that 2000e and was self-excluded. I agree i lost fair and square at first, but i then had self-excluded myself for 1-year after i lost the 2000e and there was no option to put any reasons i just went to responsible gambling section and self-excluded for maximum time of 1-year but they easily just removed my self-exclusion. And to comment on you're analogy on drinking is not comparable here, i have asked for my account to be closed 1 year AND at the time when you choose to self-exclude there is no choice to put any reasons there but after when the gambling urges will come back you're desire to gamble is so strong that lying is the easiest thing to do. People will steal and commit frauds to get to gamble if they need to just like any other addiction and everyone with a litlebit of a brain will know this thats why there are these responsible gambling laws in place to decrease a lot of bad things that results from this. This casino has not followed money laundering or identification rules of any sort and that has been the reason before also for them to lose licences and also they don't understand the nature of gambling addiction and responsible gambling and definitely are not responsible when it comes to responsible gambling and have violated the rules of their licence and also there has to be some laws in the EU that requires these things to be in place since estonia is a europian country. My free will was to self-exclude myself for 1-year time but they did not honour this and i would have been protected by the casino if they would follow the responsible gambling rules and would actually take responsible gambling seriously. Yes there are rules that each of us needs to follow and in this case, ninja casino has not followed their rules or licence rules regarding responsible gambling these rules are very clear on self-exclusions which again i have provided proof already from their licence yet ninja casino has not provided anything no proof at all. I think you are confusing 2 different things here that are closing you're account and self-exclusion. Self-exclusions is diferent from only closing you're account it is a responsible gambling tool required for licenced casinos to have and it cannot be removed for any reason until the time period you have chosen is expired.</p>
<p>But thank you again for you're help and you're time, i have now contacted their licence regarding this and probably will go to the court with this.</p>
<p>Thank you and have a nice rest of the year!</p>
