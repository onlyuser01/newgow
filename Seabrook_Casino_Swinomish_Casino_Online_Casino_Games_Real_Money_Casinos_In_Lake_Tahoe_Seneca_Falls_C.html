<p>Macau Casinos Continue Struggle, Gaming Revenue Down 37 Percent in June</p>

<p>Macau casinos struggled in June. Last month, gross gaming revenue (GGR) tumbled 37 percent from May.</p>

<p>The Macau Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau revealed that the six commercial casino operators won MOP6.5 billion (US$820 million) in June. That number is 73 percent lower compared with the pre-pandemic June 2019.</p>
<p>Gaming analysts got it right, as a note from Bernstein last month called for June GGR to drop just shy of 40 percent from May.</p>
<p>In line with expectations,” Bernstein said today of the $820 million win.</p>
<p>While June showed that Macau is far from returning to pre-pandemic gaming levels, June 2021 nonetheless was much better than June 2020, when casinos won just $89.5 million — the lowest monthly total incurred throughout the entire pandemic.</p>
<p>Macau casino stocks reacted positively to the June revenue report. Las Vegas Sands, MGM Resorts, Wynn Resorts, Melco Resorts, Galaxy Entertainment, and SJM Resorts were all trading higher this morning.</p>
<p>Macau on Hold</p>
<p>Macau, the world’s richest gaming market, isn’t rebounding from the devastating economic impact of COVID-19 nearly as quick as other key casino areas.</p>
<p>For instance, Nevada casinos experienced a record revenue month in May, GGR there totaling $1.23 billion. That’s the state’s all-time highest casino win ever for a single month.</p>
<p>Analysts and casino execs cite extraordinary pent-up demand for the tourism and gaming rebound. But in Macau, that pent-up demand remains pent-up, as traveling into the isolated Special Administrative Region (SAR) remains difficult for nonresidents.</p>
<p>Macau is slowly beginning to ease its strict quarantine requirements. Currently, only people arriving from Hong Kong, Taiwan, or mainland China can enter the enclave.</p>
<p>Even with a negative COVID-19 test, Macau has been requiring travelers from certain parts of Guangdong, a major feeder source for the enclave’s casino resorts, to quarantine for 14 days or longer. In mid-June, Macau announced that the cities of Shenzhen and Maoming were no longer included in the mandatory quarantine list.</p>
<p>Quarantine easing has analysts optimistic. JPMorgan is forecasting that July GGR will range between $1.38 billion to $1.5 billion. That would mark a roughly 83 percent month-to-month surge.</p>
<p>Billions Lost</p>
<p>Through the first six months of 2021, Macau casinos have won MOP49 billion (US$6.13 billion). While that’s 812.5 percent better than what the gaming properties generated through the first half of the year in 2020, it remains down from 2019.</p>
<p>At this time in 2019, Macau GGR stood at MOP149.5 billion (US$18.7 billion).</p>
<p>Some good news broke this week. Officials in Macau and Hong Kong confirmed that the two sides are nearing a deal to allow for quarantine-free cross-border travel. Hongkongers, as early as this month could be permitted to visit Macau’s integrated resorts without quarantining.</p>
<p>That will only happen, though, if new cases of COVID-19 do not arise in either SAR. Prior to the pandemic, Hong Kong accounted for about 20 percent of Macau’s visitor traffic.</p>
