<p>The search for a new Playtech chairman is finally over, with Brian Mattingley moving from 888 Holdings to join the company’s team on June 1, 2021.</p>
<p>Brian Mattingley to Step in as Playtech Chairman</p>
<p>Two years after Alan Jackson departed from Playtech, the company is close to appointing a new person for the job. According to media outlet Sky, and now confirmed by the company, Playtech will now be bringing 888 executive Brian Mattingley on the job.</p>
<p>He will be taking over Claire Milne, who stepped in as an interim fit to provide the company with direction while the hunt was still ongoing. Sky reported that Playtech insiders have spoken to the publication arguing that Mattingley was not a random pick.</p>
<p>With shares performing strongly and the company changing its tax residency to the United Kingdom, Playtech would want to continue developing its positive financial outlook. Mattingley should be the right man for the job, Sky says as per sources.</p>
<p>To take up his position in Playtech, Mattingley will naturally first step down as 888 Holdings chairman. His appointment is scheduled for June 1, 2021. Milne shed light on the appointment of Mattingley, having this to add:</p>
<p>“In selecting the new chair, we wanted to appoint an individual with significant online gambling experience and a track record of delivering high levels of corporate governance and stakeholder engagement in a highly regulated and fast-growing industry.” Playtech interim chairwoman Claire Milne</p>
<p>A Well-Seasoned Industry Veteran Arrives</p>
<p>Milne argued that Mattingley had a proven track record in those specific areas that Playtech was now after. His professional path in iGaming shaped up at 888 Holdings from 2005 on in, when he joined as a non-executive director and landed in the position of a non-executive chairman in March 2016.</p>
<p>Mattingley similarly worked in other companies across the sector, including Ritz Group, Gala Group, Kingfisher, and more. Commenting on the appointment, Mattingley said that he was pleased to be joining Playtech and was looking forward to working with the team to advance the company’s strategy and explore new opportunities for the company.</p>
