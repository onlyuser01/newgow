    <h1>Casino Royal Magic Diamond Casino Bonanza Casino Reno Fort Mcdowell Casino Live Casino Greensburg RO</h1>

<p>So new casino... always leery but I decided to give it a go. I deposited $60 with a 300% reload bonus. I played and did really well on my favorite slot. I loved that they had all my favorite games here which is part of why I tried them out. I figured I had an impossible playthrough to get through so threw caution to the wind and bet more than I normally do as I play more for fun than to try to win fast. I played for awhile and got my balance up to $800 and went to look at how much more playthrough I had, and it said I haven't completed any of my playthrough so I was very confused and contacted support. They said they would get back to me in email and when they did I was pleasantly surprised as I learned you play your cash deposit first before the bonus kicks in, meaning that they don't hold your cash hostage while you try to get through a massive playthrough. It showed my bonus on there of roughly $150 and they said all I had to do was cancel my bonus and I could withdraw the remainder as I was still playing on my money which they put first. I was so used to the way most casinos work that I thought it was broken! So I tested it out, I cancelled the bonus and then cashed out $650 which was in my wallet in less than an hour! This is a GREAT way to do it where you have the bonus as a backup if you lose your money but they don't hold your money hostage where you can't cash out. Customer service was stellar once I got to the right people but I think the chat reps need a bit more training as they couldn't tell me why I had no playthrough but they were very kind and helpful nonetheless. Also, someone was complaining about showing their balance change as they did free spins. This is because when your money is in there (crypto only casino) it is essentially still on the blockchain which I also LOVE. One reason I cashed out a lot at other casinos is I like to keep my crypto on the blockchain when I am not playing so I can possibly have gains while not using it (or losses of course but I like to think positive!) It also looks like they have an option to buy crypto right there from the casino. I didn't try this out as I use a different exchange but that might be handy for some. I am only on day one trying ROLR but so far they have won my business and so much better than the big brands that have gone cold recently. They also have a VIP program where they hand pick people and then apparently have great rewards but I am not a high roller so they probably won't pick me :) I highly suggest giving them a try and I hope your experience is as good as mine has been!</p>
