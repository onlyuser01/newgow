    <h1>Hotels Near Hard Rock Casino Free Casinos Online Quilceda Creek Casino Tropicana Casino Resort Casin</h1>

<p>The Grand Sierra Resort and Casino has become the site of a jackpot winner with an unnamed individual grabbing $544,663 from a slot on Sunday</p>
<p>The Reno property did not disclose the winnerâ€™s full name but identified them as Jessy R. Jessy placed an $8 bet and was about to stop playing when fortune struck and that $8 was turned into the six-figure payout.</p>
<p>Jackpots and Privacy Go Hand-in-Hand It Seems</p>
<p>Jessy reportedly spent 10 minutes playing on the machine when the jackpot fell, to his befuddlement. The game, Wheel of Fortune High Roller video slot by International Game Technology, is one of the most popular jackpot slots not just in Reno, but on most gambling floors across the United States.</p>
<p>This was the first time that Jessy R. has ever played at the Grand Sierra Resort and Casino, making the memory all the more vivid. Jessy preferred to pose for a photo while covering his face with a hat, glasses, and a mask. However, you can tell that Jessy is probably a Los Angeles Lakers fan judging by his cap.</p>
<p>Of course, Jessy is not the only person to have grabbed a juicy jackpot from the venue. Another anonymous player managed to win $1.25 million playing the slots at the location back in January. They were playing the Buffalo Diamond slot when the jackpot hit. Besides Grand Sierra Resort and Casino, there have been more jackpot winners in Nevada over the past weeks.</p>
<p>A lucky winner on Wednesday won $100,000 at the Rio All-Suite Hotel &amp; Casino. On Tuesday, a Mega Jackpot dropped at the Planet Hollywood Resort &amp; Casino with another winner leaving with $193,487 from Mississippi Stud Poker. Then again, last week a person won $101,375 at the Caesars Palace Las Vegas.</p>
<p>Most of these people have chosen to remain anonymous, although this is not always the case. Many players actually love sitting for the photo-ops after, but it mostly seems to be the people who enter the seven-figure territory. Anonymous or not, jackpots seem to be falling all over Nevada!</p>
