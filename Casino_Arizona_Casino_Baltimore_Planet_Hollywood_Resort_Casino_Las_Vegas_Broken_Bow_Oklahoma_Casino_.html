    <h1>Casino Arizona Casino Baltimore Planet Hollywood Resort Casino Las Vegas Broken Bow Oklahoma Casino</h1>

<p>Arizona-based casino operator Gila River Hotels &amp; Casinos is going through a transition. The casino industry is becoming more competitive in the state, and it wants to keep up. Gila River will host a celebration weekend at Wild Horse Pass this month to celebrate the $180-million expansion of the Wild Horse Pass and the opening of the Sunrise Tower. It will also carry a new company brand, as the name Gila River Hotels &amp; Casinos is going away.</p>
<p>Gila River Hotel &amp; Casinos, which has been around for 27 years, has been rebranded as Gila River Resorts &amp; Casinos. To celebrate, the company will reveal its new look on Friday and Saturday, along with the expansion project at Wild Horse Pass.</p>
<p>The rebrand will include the three properties that make up the company’s casino portfolio. CEO Manuel stated that the new brand will allow guests to enjoy a Las Vegas-style casino environment, including live tables at all properties, as well as a robust rewards program.</p>
<p>The Gila River Indian Community currently manages three casinos. These are Lone Butte and Wild Horse Pass, both in Chandler, as well as Vee Quiva in West Valley. Santan Mountain in South Valley, the tribe’s fourth property, is under development. The project was inaugurated last October, and it is expected that it will be completed in 2023.</p>
<p>Wild Horse Pass Celebrates</p>
<p>Wild Horse Pass will celebrate its expanded accommodations with a celebration this weekend. The property will feature a revamped appearance, amenities, and BetMGM sportsbooks. There will also be multiple events throughout the weekend to celebrate the milestone.</p>
<p>Kenneth Manuel, CEO of Gila River Resorts &amp; Casinos, said that guests can expect “elevated experiences” at all Gila River properties. He added, “We are truly excited to introduce ourselves as Gila River Resorts &amp; Casino. Throughout the past several years, we have been creating a destination packed with thrilling entertainment and new ways to play so that guests can come as they are and own their moment.”</p>
<p>In August 2020, Gila River, in partnership with Sundt Construction and Tynan Group, began construction on the expansion of its resort property. This was the first expansion since the property opened its doors in 2009.</p>
<p>The Sunrise tower is connected to Sunset tower and rises 150 feet above the desert landscape. There are 447 rooms in total at the resort, including 205 guest rooms and suites in the Sunrise tower.</p>
