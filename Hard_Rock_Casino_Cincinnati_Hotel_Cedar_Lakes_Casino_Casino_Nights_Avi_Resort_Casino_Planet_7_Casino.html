<p>Danger High Voltage review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Danger High Voltage looks, at first glance, like a disco-themed slot. The background is made up of those coloured squares that flash beneath dance floors.</p>
<p>On closer inspection, however, the symbols suggest a different agenda. There are disco balls, certainly, but also tacos, Day of the Dead masks, and celebratory bells. So something leaning towards a Mexican theme?</p>
<p>That would not explain the title though, nor the names of the bonus games – Gates of Hell and High Voltage – which point towards electricity and accidental death as a theme.</p>
<p>In the end, the true theme of this slot is a question that will have to be left to the philosophers.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>Danger High Voltage has a solid set of animations for winning combinations and the Wild symbols, when they land. Even the reels are nicely spun up on the screen.</p>
<p>The symbols, though incoherently matched, are well-drawn and pretty enough.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the background feels cheap and poorly thought out. The music in the base game and sound effects are forgettable (though the bonuses really ramp their music game up), neither adding nor detracting from the sense of atmosphere generated by the other elements.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Danger High Voltage is played on six reels, using an any way wins system.</p>
<p>Any way wins systems pay out for matching symbols anywhere on the reel, provided the symbols run left to right from reel one. This is in place of the more typical win lines.</p>
<p>Given that this is a six reels slot with four rows, that makes for 4,096 ways to win overall.</p>
<p>There is an option of two bonus games, but no gamble feature.</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbols substitute for all symbols except the Scatter symbols. There are two types: the Fire Wild which acts as an ordinary Wild and the Electricity Wild which fills the reel and adds a six times multiplier for each Electricity Wild used in a win. Both types of Wild fill the entire reel they land on.</p>
<p>Hitting three or more Scatter symbols in one spin triggers a payout (higher the more Scatters you hit) and the Bonus Feature. Players that trigger the Bonus Feature are offered one of two Free Spin bonuses: High Voltage Free Spins and Gates of Hell Free Spins.</p>
<p>High Voltage Free Spins offers fifteen free spins with High Voltage Wilds.</p>
<p>High Voltage Wilds create a reel with seven symbols on it when they land. Each of these seven symbols has a multiplier starting from x1 at the bottom then increasing in increments of 11 from there up to x66 at the top. The randomly selected multiplier is applied to any winning combination using symbols adjacent to that multiplier.</p>
<p>The Gates of Hell Free Spins, on the other hand, offer seven free spins. A symbol is chosen at random and for the duration of the free spins that symbol transforms into a Sticky Wild symbol that does not move from spin to spin.</p>
<p>If the player fills a reel with Sticky Wilds in they receive an extra three spins.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 95.67%, slightly below our yardstick for average of roughly 96%, though not by much.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.20 up to a maximum of $/£/€40.00 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is medium to high, meaning that wins are less frequent but tend to be bigger when you do hit. This makes Danger High Voltage a good match for our preferred slot machine strategies.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Danger High Voltage is an incoherent mess at the visual level, but has excellent gameplay, high volatility and a below average RTP.</p>
<p>We would recommend our more fiscally minded players to look elsewhere for their kicks, but more casual players could certainly get something out of this fast paced slot.</p>
