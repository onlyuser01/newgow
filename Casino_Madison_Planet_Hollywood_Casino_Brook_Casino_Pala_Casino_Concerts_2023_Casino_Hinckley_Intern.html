<p>Internet Vikings, the global hosting gaming provider, announced on Friday that it launched its operations in Illinois.</p>
<p>Internet Vikings Enters 18th US State</p>
<p>The company is already known as one of the top iGaming hosting services providers in Europe. With that in mind, Internet Vikings’ expansion in the US started in July last year. Now, the entry in Illinois marks the 18th US state where Internet Vikings has set up and launched its leading iGaming hosting services. Looking to offer its leading iGaming hosting solutions to more US jurisdictions, the company has already seen success in key states such as New Jersey, West Virginia and Colorado.</p>
<p>“As a business, we are both proud and very eager to see how rapidly we are keeping up our rate of expansion in the United States.” Elena Kvakova, head of US expansion at Internet Vikings</p>
<p>Elena Kvakova, Internet Vikings’ head of US expansion said in a statement that the company is proud to continue its expansion to more US jurisdictions. She explained that Internet Vikings is focused to continue expanding until securing access to all 21 US states where iGaming has been legalized. In conclusion, Kvakova outlined that the company selects which state to enter by observing different “trends and keeping up with client needs and expectations.”</p>
<p>Illinois: Yet to Legalize Online Gambling, but Social Casinos Are Popular</p>
<p>Illinois legalized sports betting back in June 2019. However, it wasn’t until March 2020, that the activity was finally launched. Since then, the popularity of the activity has been growing significantly, which paves the way for legalizing online gambling activities as well. However, for the moment, “real-money” online gambling isn’t legal in Illinois.</p>
<p>On the other hand, currently, there are social gambling websites in the state. Those websites offer casino-like entertainment such as table and slot games. It is important to mention that to play those games, consumers are not required to submit a real-money deposit, but can win prizes, some of which are monetary.</p>
<p>Considering the current legal framework, iGaming service providers just like Internet Vikings are not required to hold a license. To enter the market in Illinois, those operators need to have a client to work with within the state. In that line of thought, Internet Vikings has secured two such clients. In fact, thanks to those collaborations, the company has expanded with one of the clients to two other US states.</p>
