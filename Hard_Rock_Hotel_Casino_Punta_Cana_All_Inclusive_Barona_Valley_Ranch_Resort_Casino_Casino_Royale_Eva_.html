    <h1>Hard Rock Hotel Casino Punta Cana All Inclusive Barona Valley Ranch Resort Casino Casino Royale Eva</h1>

<p>Started playing in January 21. Completed verification. Requested several withdrawals 17/01/21 as their system seemed to limit individual withdrawal amounts. Waited 2 weeks and then emailed to chase. Received an email saying my withdrawal of €900 had been denied and that they would issue €300 ( said the most I could withdraw was 10 x deposit amount). They advised it would be paid into my bank. To date I have never received this and despite numerous emails - have had no reply. In the meantime I continued playing and won further and requested withdrawals on 13/02/21. of €550. On 18/02/21 I revived a payment of £459.83 which was lower than I would have expected on converting €550 but none the less I was pleased to receive. However the €300 has still not been received, since then I requested another 2 withdrawals totalling €900 on 24/02/21, and have not received these either. I have emailed quite a few times advising this and have also gone onto their chat service, it they have just fobbed me off each time. I am extremely unhappy with this casino. Their terms and conditions advise payment in approximately a week ( worst case scenario).</p>
<p>More frustratingly, they NEVER reply to my emails.</p>
<p>Please can you help?</p>
