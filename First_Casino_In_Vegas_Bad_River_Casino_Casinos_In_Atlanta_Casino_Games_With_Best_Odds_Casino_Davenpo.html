<p>Sports betting technology supplier BETBY has entered into a fresh partnership with Together Gaming as the companies explore to reach new audiences, strengthen their present offer and expand even further in the iGaming space. The new deal will enable Together Gaming to benefit from BETBY’s dedicated sportsbook solution.</p>
<p>This includes a reporting tool and a variety of other support systems that are deemed some of the industry’s best. Together Gaming will further benefit from Betby.Games, a selection of iGaming titles that make room for new experiences. BETBY Head of Sales Rosaire Galea said:</p>
<p>Together Gaming is a forward-thinking solution provider, showcased by its cloud-based platform and flexible solutions.</p>
<p>Betby uses powerful artificial intelligence algorithms to ensure that clients have access to popular video gaming titles and are able to explore unique wagering opportunities around the clock. This integration will give Together Gaming’s white label solutions a significant boost.</p>
<p>The company will have better leverage when seeking to strike partnerships with iGaming operators and sportsbooks who are looking to launch any of the supported products. Right now, Together Gaming, provides powerful cloud-based options that provide content in the live casino, sports betting, lottery, and casino verticals.</p>
<p>BETBY has been pleased with the present partnership as indicated before. The company sees it as important to continue growing and building upon its commercial success in the long term. BETBY has signed numerous deals with prominent partners of late, including Hero Gaming, BC.GAME, Esports Entertainment Group, and others.</p>
<p>Together Gaming Managing Director Benjamin Delsinger was similarly pleased with the integration and partnership with BETBY. He spoke about the incredible AI-driven products that the company has been able to build and deliver to its partners – and now Together Gaming itself.</p>
<p>Delsinger also argued that Betby.Games’ esports portfolio is something completely new on the market that consumers have responded positively to and which he expects to be part of any future product scaling. BETBY has been quickly building up its product offering ensuring that its portfolio is a recognizable and powerful landmark in the gambling industry.</p>
<p>The company is heading to the SBC Summit 2022 Barcelona and the SBC Awards 2022. Recently, the company added more F1 coverage to its platform to appeal to fans of the sport.</p>
