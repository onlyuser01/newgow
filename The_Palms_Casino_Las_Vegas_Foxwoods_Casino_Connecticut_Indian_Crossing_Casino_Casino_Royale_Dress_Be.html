    <h1>The Palms Casino Las Vegas Foxwoods Casino Connecticut Indian Crossing Casino Casino Royale Dress Be</h1>

<p>I won ten free spins on book of demigods 2 on a 20 cent bet. Which can be bought for 20 dollars. The first spin was fine. However all of the other spins stopped halfway through the spin and said there was a problem and to reload the game. When I did that the spin was gone. I did this up until the last spin that was left and called support. They said that they would look into it and get back to me. A few days later I noticed that I had some free spins for another game. Free spins had a 40x wagering requirement. I just thought it was another promotion so I played it. Didn't even like the game but who's going to refuse free spins right? I should have confirmed it because instead of getting back to me, they gave me these spins on a game that I don't like, with a 40x wagering requirement. When I inquired about my issue they basically told me that they considered themselves clear of anything wrong and would not make it right. I've put a lot of money into this site and had nothing but problems trying to kyc so I could cash out. So just like they want, I played and lost any winnings that I did win. As far as I'm concerned I've been ripped off for every penny that I've put into this site and think that everyone should know that they are a scam regardless of what the reviews say. This new Ontario gaming law is supposed to protect the players, but all it really does is make it easier for the casinos to screw over the little guys and take their money without any consequences to themselves. I tried to upload the only screenshot from the game but it will not allow me to.</p>
