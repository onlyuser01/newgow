    <h1>Are There Casinos In Texas Illinois Casinos Cherokee Casino Siloam Springs Lucky Hippo Casino New Ve</h1>

<p>Dear Team,</p>
<p>My name is Georgi Fotev and I am writing you because one of yours TOP recommended casinos is the worst casino i have been playing in.</p>
<p>You are recommending the casino however I can't withdraw the amount of 50 Euro for more than 2 weeks already.</p>
<p>After i got in contact with them it turned out that there is some problem which is why they have refund the amount to me again hoping i guess to play it back. After that, they have informed me to do the withdraw again (preferably chose another way but they don't have such) so i have withdraw the amount again. They have returned it back to me asking me for a bank statement.</p>
<p>Now I am waiting for it to be confirmed however:</p>
<p>They haven't contacted me that the amount is blocked They haven't refunded it back to my account initially They have refunded it back twice hoping to spend them - the cheapest way of keeping customers playing. At the end they are requesting confidential documents for approval of my credit card which i have provided and need to wait again don't know how much time to get their answer on this.</p>
<p>Finally - even if i play the money and win i can't withdraw them why - because this is the worst casino ever. So the only option is to spend them the fasted way I can and forget about this very very very bad customer experience but most importantly RECOMMENDED BY YOU ON YOUR FORTH PLACE !!!</p>
<p>Honestly you should either pay more attention to what casinos you are recommending or the whole service you provide is a bullshit to get better affiliate deals from the casinos...</p>
<p>Thanks for your perfect service</p>

<p>Best Regards,</p>
