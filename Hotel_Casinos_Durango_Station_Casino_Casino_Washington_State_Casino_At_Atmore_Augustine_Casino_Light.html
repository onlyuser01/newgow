    <h1>Hotel Casinos Durango Station Casino Casino Washington State Casino At Atmore Augustine Casino Light</h1>

<p>Light &amp; Wonder, an American gaming products and services company, announced that it completed the acquisition of all House Advantage assets. The acquisition of the marketing tech company’s business will help the supplier add a proven marketing solution to its products.</p>
<p>Light &amp; Wonder Acquired House Advantage</p>
<p>As explained by Light &amp; Wonder, House Advantage is a company with almost two decades of experience on the market. It is based in Las Vegas and India and develops loyalty solutions for brands within the gambling sector. House Advantage’s goal is to help companies improve their client retention in a highly competitive industry.</p>
<p>House Advantage’s HALo is a comprehensive omnichannel loyalty and marketing solution that leverages data from many systems across retail and online channels. The unified tech layer provides an open framework that helps partners intuitively integrate House Advantage’s solution into their CMS systems and deliver personalized marketing campaigns.</p>
<p>Following Light &amp; Wonder’s acquisition of House Advantage, the former company will name the latter’s founder and chief executive, Jon Wolfe, as a senior vice president and president of global systems and services. Several other House Advantage workers will also move to Light &amp; Wonder.</p>
<p>Wolfe will be a great addition to Light &amp; Wonder’s team thanks to his long years of experience with business intelligence, customer information systems and leadership. A long-time gambling industry worker, Wolfe has an impressive track record of driving growth and capitalizing on industry tailwinds. He is also known as a good diplomat who has built lasting relationships with some of the biggest operators in the gaming sector.</p>
<p>Wilson Was Thrilled to Welcome HA’s Team</p>
<p>Light &amp; Wonder’s chief executive, Matt Wilson, commented on the new acquisition.</p>
<p>Loyalty is no longer just about a player’s card; it’s about the player journey across all touchpoints. By welcoming the HA team to L&amp;W, we are strengthening our position and accelerating the transformation and growth of our systems business to drive greater value for our customers. Matt Wilson, CEO, Light &amp; Wonder</p>
<p>Wilson believes that House Advantage’s leading software and tech solutions will help Light &amp; Wonder capitalize on the junction of online and land-based gaming. He noted that HALo is a powerful omnichannel player loyalty solution that perfectly complements the supplier’s existing portfolio and will help it provide its clients with an unparalleled offering.</p>
<p>Wilson also added that House Advantage will see his company take yet another talented team under its wing. Wilson praised Jon Wolfe as a true visionary and said that he is sure the latter’s experience will help Light &amp; Wonder capitalize on the potential of its systems team.</p>
<p>Jon Wolfe also spoke on the deal. For him, joining Light &amp; Wonder is a great opportunity to expand House Advantage’s reach. Furthermore, the agreement will provide his company with the resources it needs to continue developing best-in-class tech that helps operators optimize player management.</p>
<p>Convergence of disparate platforms and unification of data across these platforms into a contiguous customer experience is our hallmark and we’re excited that Light &amp; Wonder shares our player-centric mindset and our vision for creating a converged, cross-platform future. Jon Wolfe, CEO of HA and SVP and president at Light &amp; Wonder</p>
