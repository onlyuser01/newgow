<p>The fast-growing and innovative provider of games for the online gambling vertical, Wazdan, announced a new deal, expanding further its European and Balkan presence. On Wednesday, the company revealed it has gone live with the leading Bulgarian gambling operator, 8888.bg.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the freshly minted partnership, Wazdan agreed to deliver games for the leading operator, expanding further its content offering. As a result, fan-favorite games such as Sizzling Bells, Magic Stars 9, Lucky Reels, Magic Fruits Deluxe, Power of Gods: Egypt, Clover Lady, Fortune Reels, Magic Spins, 9 Coins and Larry the Leprechaun are now available for Bulgarian players of the operator, a statement released on May 3, 2023, reveals.</p>
<p>Radka Bacheva, Wazdan's Head of Sales and Business Development for Balkan and Southeast Europe, shared her excitement saying: "8888.bg is one of Bulgaria's biggest online casinos, so we're thrilled to be bringing our content to such a prominent operator."</p>
<p>Finally, she added: "We've had several successful partnerships in this market thus far and we're excited for even more Bulgarian players to discover and enjoy our excellent offerings."</p>
<p>Without any doubt, the deal will bring benefits to the leading Bulgarian operator. This is because Wazdan's titles are proven to be popular with a wide range of players, helping boost fan engagement and retention. While 8888.bg will benefit from expanding its offering, the deal helps Wazdan expand further the reach of its products.</p>
<p>What's more, the collaboration builds upon the positive momentum gained by the leading iGaming content developer in the country. Before 8888.bg, Wazdan forged deals with other important operators for the region that included Sesame, Alphawin, Palms Bet, as well as INBET. Now the new deal further strengthens the presence of the company in the region.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Wazdan joined forces with Bally's Interactive, agreeing to supply the operator with its content portfolio. Announced late last month, the deal will see content from the leading iGaming developer arrive first for Bally's Interactive's online gambling brand Vera&amp;John.</p>
<p>Before that, again in April, Wazdan confirmed it secured a license in Sweden from Spelinspektionen. The company became one of the first operators to secure such a license, allowing it to continue to deliver its range of engaging games to operators in the country.</p>
<p>This was an important goal for Wazdan, and it comes ahead of a planned change for the regulated gambling market in Sweden that requires suppliers of iGaming content and technology to have a valid license from the regulator, Spelinspektionen.</p>
