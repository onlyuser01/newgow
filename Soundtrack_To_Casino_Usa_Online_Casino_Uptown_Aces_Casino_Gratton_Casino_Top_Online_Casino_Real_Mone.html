<p>Another big poker event is around the corner with 888poker announcing its $1 million XL Winter Series, which will feature a $500,000 Main Event.</p>
<p>888Poker Announces $1m XL Winter Series</p>
<p>888poker is introducing a $1 million XL Winter Series to kick off on December 10 and continue through December 22, 2020. The series will feature over 30 different events and come as part of the company’s rebranding efforts and the card room’s new ‘Made to Play’ motto that has inspired the arrival of Poker 8, a brand new poker platform and upgraded software.</p>
<p>The tournament is just an extension of the planned $1 million 888 that is already giving away throughout the rest of the year as part of its marketing campaign.</p>
<p>Not wasting any time, 888poker is taking the new toys out for play, putting the platform to mass-scale testing with a massive $500,000 Main Event crowning the XL Winter Series. The events will be affordable and accessible, thanks to a variety of buy-ins, starting at as little as $5.50 and $109.</p>
<p>The only outlier will be The Main event which will expect participants to put down $250 for a chance to get in on the action. In total, there will be 34 events held over 11 days and an average of four tournaments will take place every day.</p>
<p>888poker is sticking to familiar formats, and specifically, No-Limit Hold’em, with a few deep stacks and PKOs thrown in the mix to make the experience far more entertaining.</p>
<p>Satellites and Giveaways to Get in on the Action</p>
<p>If you are looking to participate in the $1 million poker tournament bonanza this December, you should have no trouble. 888poker is making sure to offer plenty of satellite events including freeroll tournaments held on December 10, 13, and 20. There will also be various Gift Drops for unsuspecting players to join in on the fun.</p>
<p>Players who do not wish to commit too much money on poker tournaments can still qualify through satellites that start at $0.01, albeit it may prove a long climb to the top.</p>
<p>What about the Main Event?</p>
<p>The $500,000 Main Event will definitely be the highlight of the event streamed live on both Facebook and YouTube. 888poker is launching the main leg of the race on December 20 and it will cost $250 to get going. For those looking for somewhat smaller events, there is the Mini Main Event, for just $33 with a prize pool of $50,000.</p>
<p>Another event you may be keen on exploring is the Micro Main Event for just $5.50 available at $15,000. 888 has seen a strong surge in its United States results this year, with the company reporting a 90% jump in revenue. In April this year, poker traffic for the 888poker network soared by 60% driven by strong demand for the game in the first months of lockdown.</p>
