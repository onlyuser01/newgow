<p>Liga Stavok, which will also receive recognition on all NHL digital assets as a premier marketing partner, including on the league’s official Russian website, will gain rights to use in its promotions official NHL marks, logos, and designations to create a fan engaging content and authentic NHL marketing programs.</p>
<p>“Moving towards an international level is part of the business strategy of Liga Stavok. It is a great honor and responsibility for us to expand our participation in development of world ice hockey…This partnership with the NHL is another historic step in this direction.
