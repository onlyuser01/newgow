<p>Aparat Gaming has launched the sequel to its popular Total Eclipse slot, Total Eclipse XXL, with a Hold &amp; Spin feature, high volatility, and a max win of 11,000x</p>
<p>At the start of last month, the 2020-founded iGaming content company that creates games “with a German accent” that meet the highest German engineering and quality standards, Apparat Gaming, announced it would start offering its games to players in Spain via a newly inked partnership with Paf.</p>
<p>Now, the studio that bagged a prestigious license from the Malta Gaming Authority in 2021 has fresh news for fans of the original Total Eclipse slot released in 2022.</p>
<p>Apparat Gaming has launched the sequel to the popular game. Total Eclipse XXL promises to introduce fans to the “next dimension of thrill”, and the max win capped at 11,000x and the Eclipse Spins feature certainly pave the way to new heights.</p>
<p>Total Eclipse XXL Metrics Overview</p>
<p>Rows: 5</p>
<p>5 Reels: 4</p>
<p>4 Paylines: 40</p>
<p>40 Volatility: High</p>
<p>High Hit frequency: 8.66%</p>
<p>8.66% Max win: 11,000x</p>
<p>11,000x RTP: 96.24%</p>
<p>96.24% Min/Max Bet: 0.10-20</p>
<p>0.10-20 Release date: November 29, 2023</p>
<p>Get Ready to Be Eclipsed by the Big Wins</p>
<p>Set on a cosmic journey through the adventure-packed reels on the 5×4 grid and try to land a minimum of four Eclipse symbols. This will trigger the mouthwatering Hold &amp; Spin Eclipse Spins feature that will carry the action on a 5×8 layout.</p>
<p>As a rule of thumb, the bigger the reels, the higher your chances to hit a “planetary-sized win”. Take advantage of the feature and try to collect all 40 available Eclipse symbols for a chance to unlock the Grand prize of 11,000x the original bet.</p>
<p>The highly volatile game with a 5/5 score features a return to player rate of 96.24% and it has received the green light for launch in a number of regulated markets with Denmark, Greece, the Netherlands, the Isle of Man, Italy, Romania, Portugal, Sweden, Spain, the UK, Switzerland, and all Malta jurisdictions on the list.</p>
<p>Apparat Gaming’s co-founder and director, Alina Dandörfer, spoke about the massive success of the original game recorded with operators and their players while expressing her belief that the fresh release would further carry the gameplay and blast the win potential “into the stratosphere.”</p>
<p>In August, the studio with decades of experience in both the land-based and the online gaming industry announced it would extend its presence in Switzerland with the help of Grand Casino Baden.</p>
<p>In mid-November, the trustworthy supplier of online gaming content for operators located in Germany and a large number of other European markets released Caesar’s Legions, a new 5×3 video slot featuring Free Spins, Sticky Wilds, and Multiplier Wilds.</p>
