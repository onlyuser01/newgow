    <h1>Jamul Casino Rio Casino Restaurants Primm Valley Resort Casino Vegas X Org Casino Morongo Casino Cal</h1>

<p>Ladies and Gentlemen</p>
<p>I registered with you at Blazzio Casino on September 15th, 2023 using a third-party offer ($60 for a min. €50 deposit + Wager x3) (username: SebaTV) and after confirming the registration by email I received €50.51 via Litecoin paid in .</p>
<p>I then started 1,000 autoplay spins in the "Sweet Bonanza" slot with a stake of €0.20 and ended the autoplay after 927 spins and a remaining balance of €30.15 . A payout of €30.00 was then requested via Litecoin.</p>
<p>The payout was made on the grounds that my account was blocked due to a violation of point 13.4.1. the general terms and conditions are blocked, rejected.</p>
<p>13.4.1 "we have reasonable grounds to believe that you have engaged in or are connected with any form of Prohibited Act (and the basis for our belief includes our use of fraud, deception and collusion detection practices). Gaming Partners and our other service providers) used in the gaming industry at the relevant time); or"</p>
<p>I immediately contacted the live chat and clarified that this was not true and simply wrong. I am definitely not involved in any fraudulent activity and have offered that we are welcome to do a KYC to clarify this matter and verify my identity.</p>
<p>The employee Eugene didn't go into it at all and just said that it was impossible to remove the block and that I had evidence of fraudulent activity.</p>
<p>However, he couldn't give me an exact reason, only that there was probably fraudulent activity in the game session.</p>
<p>After the further conversation led to nothing and I insisted on paying out the loss, he said that I would receive another email about this.</p>
<p>This email looked like this:</p>
<p>Dear Paul,</p>
<p>Your account was suspended in accordance with section 13.4.1 of our Terms and Conditions, which states that we reserve the right to suspend an account if we have reasonable grounds to believe that the account holder has participated in or has been connected with any form of Prohibited practice. These practices may include, but are not limited to, fraud, cheating, and collusion.</p>
<p>Please note that our decision to suspend your account is based on a thorough investigation, which may include the use of industry-standard fraud detection methods and practices employed by us, our gaming partners, and our suppliers.</p>
<p>These methods are in line with the standards and protocols used in the gambling and gaming industry.</p>
<p>While we cannot provide specific details or evidence of the alleged Prohibited Practice at this time, rest assured that our decision was made following a comprehensive review of the available information and in accordance with our commitment to maintaining a fair and secure gaming environment for all players.</p>
<p>In case you need further assistance or have additional questions, please contact our Customer Support by Live Chat or e-mail us at support@blazzio.com . Our team works for you 24/7.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Eugene</p>
<p>Blazzio Support Team</p>
<p>It is officially stated in this email that they cannot provide any evidence but there is a suspicion/indication that I acted fraudulently.</p>
<p>This is still simply false and an assumption that also justifies the retention of my money.</p>
<p>It is unacceptable to accuse a player of something like this and not be able to provide any evidence , let alone explain the exact reason .</p>
<p>I therefore request that you refund me the remaining balance of €30.15 to the following Litecoin address :</p>
<p>LTC : MKaUfSgvQc66E4HAJJ4HoqWvvVCKky8amc</p>
<p>If you agree to the refund, this case would be over for me and we would go our separate ways.</p>
<p>Best regards</p>
<p>Paul S<strong><em>*</em></strong>*</p>
