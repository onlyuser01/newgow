    <h1>Menominee Casino Vegas X Org Casino Login Caesars Online Casino Betmgm Casino Bonus Code Casino Roya</h1>

<p>The leader in iGaming and betting games, services, and technology solutions, Scientific Games, is now ready to launch the AToM cashless solution to jurisdictions around the world. The news comes after the company completed the acquisition of ACS’ PlayOn on Tuesday this week.</p>
<p>SG to Roll Out AToM</p>
<p>AToM, short for Access To On Demand Money, is a cashless solution that can be used for table games. The solution enables players to access their debit seamlessly while at a live table game by giving them access to their funds without the need to visit a kiosk. Moreover, the seamless process doesn’t include out-of-network or back-end fees chargeable by the consumer’s bank. To access their funds, players can easily swipe their debit card and enter their PIN.</p>
<p>Scientific Games revealed that the AToM solution could easily be implemented within management and accounting systems. Additionally, the operators that are using the solution gain access to live financial data that includes all of the transactions completed via the solution. Besides being easy to implement, the cashless solution is also PCI compliant as well as secured and certified.</p>
<p>AToM Is Currently Used in Multiple US States</p>
<p>Currently, the AToM solution is used in more than 20 properties around North America. Some of the more famous places that the solution can be found include Atlantis Casino Resort in Reno, Red Rock Casino Resort and Spa, as well as Palace Station Hotel and Casino in Nevada.</p>
<p>Overall, the solution is being used on more than 650 table games not only in Nevada but also in New Mexico and California. A major market such as the one in New Jersey has also greenlighted the use of the cashless solution.</p>
<p>The Company Is Thrilled to Offer the Cashless Solution</p>
<p>The AToM solution complements SG’s other cashless products, such as the Unified Wallet. Similar to AToM, the Unified Wallet enables players to access their funds and play tables or EGMs. The solution is easy to use via a mobile app and even features a loyalty club. Now, thanks to the AToM solution, SG players worldwide will have a new cashless solution to help them continue playing at table games with ease.</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to offer AToM – it’s unbelievably simple, intuitive and offers a great convenience for players.” Roger Snow, SVP of global table games at Scientific Games</p>
<p>Roger Snow, SG’s SVP of global table games, revealed that the company is thrilled to offer AToM. He acknowledged that the solution is easy to use and incredibly convenient for players. Additionally, Snow stressed that AToM is both reliable and fast. In conclusion, he said that SG is “excited to add even more features to this product in the future.”</p>
