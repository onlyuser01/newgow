<p>All New York casinos are gearing up to offer exciting sports betting opportunities to sports fans interested in putting down a wager on the Super Bowl.</p>
<p>New York Casinos Gear Up for Sports Betting on Super Bowl 54</p>
<p>After three years, New York’s tribal operators, the state’s only casinos allowed to run sports betting, are preparing to accept their first wagers on a Super Bowl LIV event in the state. Legalization efforts have been underway since 2017 but it wasn’t until after PASPA was repealed in May 2018 that the Empire State’s Native American upstate casinos set up their betting shops.</p>
<p>According to Lance Young, VP and GM for del Lago in Tyre, Seneca County, the event is going to draw huge interest, pushing the casinos sports handle through the roof. A minor hindrance lies in the fact that unlike more liberal states, New York only allows in-person betting, which means that any bettor would have to be physically at one of the four authorized properties to place their wagers.</p>
<p>Other states, such as New Jersey and Pennsylvania run mobile betting, which gives them a significant overall boost in the number of players willing to go out of their way and place the occasional flutter.</p>
<p>Super Bowl Betting in New York: All the Works</p>
<p>To coax bettors into arriving on sight, each casino is coming up with its own unique way to cajole new customers. Del Lago will offer a $75 promotion that includes all-you-can-eat offer as well as a bucket of beers.</p>
<p>With 300 seats available in the casino’s sportsbooks, the operator expects the place to be packed.</p>
<p>Another casino that is pushing on the marketing end is Resorts World Catskills, which is presently running its Big Game Package, which invites sports bettors to stay the night and also allocates two tickets for the casino-hosted Super Bowl party, which will feature former NFL athletes as hosts.</p>
<p>World Resorts is also relying on the Sportsbook 360 experience, which, according to sportsbook head John Collins should offer everything a bettor needs.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Tioga Downs has come up with a $40 buffet to keep sports fans’ bellies full while the Super Bowl is unfolding.</p>
<p>Some $6.8bn to be Wagered on Super Bowl LIV</p>
<p>According to the American Gaming Association (AGA), the Super Bowl is expected to generate some $6.8 billion in total sports betting handle. Some 26 million will place their bets across 14 states where sports betting is finally legal.</p>
<p>All three Oneida casinos in New York will be packed to the brink, observers have said, and all of this thanks to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in the PASPA case back in May.</p>
<p>While New York is definitely set to ride the wave of sports betting popularity, there are still some minor wrinkles that can be smoothed out. For example, mobile betting has been something that many bettors would find increasingly comfortable.</p>
<p>Senate Racing Committee Chairman Joseph Addabbo has already attempted to push a draft law supporting the enactment of online wagering on several occasions, but he has faced a dead end on every occasion.</p>
<p>Revenue from sports betting is set to climb rapidly in February owing to Super Bowl LIV. Next on the list would be March Madness.</p>
