<p>The agreement will allow Playtech to arm its partners with customer acquisition and retention tools that help them stand out from their competitors</p>
<p>Inside The Pocket (ITP), the world’s biggest free-to-play and daily fantasy sports aggregator, has agreed to provide the major gaming tech supplier Playtech with its portfolio of games. Thanks to that, the aggregation company will be able to power the supplier’s operator partners with exquisite gaming experiences.</p>
