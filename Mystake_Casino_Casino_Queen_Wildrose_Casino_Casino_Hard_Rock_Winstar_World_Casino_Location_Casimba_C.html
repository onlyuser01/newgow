    <h1>Mystake Casino Casino Queen Wildrose Casino Casino Hard Rock Winstar World Casino Location Casimba C</h1>

<p>Good Evening. I made a deposit at casimba casino 38 Euro and received a 200% bonus. After I made the requirements of the bonus I asked for a withdrawal of 850 euros that I had won. I received a reply to the following mail. I would like to note that I never bet more than 5 Euros and that all I did was buy some bonus free spins worth 10 Euros but with a bet value of 0.10 Euros. I also wonder since my country is not entitled to, bonus deposits how is it possible to be credited to my account? The following is the email I received from casimba casino. Thanks for your time.</p>
