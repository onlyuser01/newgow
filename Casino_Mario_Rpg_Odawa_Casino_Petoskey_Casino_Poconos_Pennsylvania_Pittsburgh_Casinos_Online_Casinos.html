    <h1>Casino Mario Rpg Odawa Casino Petoskey Casino Poconos Pennsylvania Pittsburgh Casinos Online Casinos</h1>

<p>Good day! I believe Betcruise casino wrongfully blocked my account and confiscated $ 1,640.</p>
<p>On September 29, the casino asked me for a photo of my passport and a document with my address. The casino justified its actions on security grounds. On the same day, I fulfilled the casino requirements.</p>
<p>On October 1, the casino asked for a photo of the passport on a different background or from a different angle and a selfie with the number 258 on a piece of paper. On October 03, I sent my documents for verification.</p>
<p>On October 7, I received a letter from the casino that my account was blocked and all bets were canceled. On the same day, being shocked by the actions of the casino, I sent a message asking to clarify what my violation was; indicate the point of the rules that I violated; provide relevant evidence. After all, accusations without evidence have no legal force.</p>
<p>On October 12, the casino reported a violation of clauses 19.5 and 19.6 of the Terms.</p>
<p>On October 13, I again applied to the casino with a request to provide evidence of my guilt and said that I had nothing to do with the violations indicated in these paragraphs. I am an honest player, in all my actions I follow your rules, in the game I am guided by intuition. Nothing was provided.</p>
<p>Today, October 25, I received a message from the casino that the decision is final and not subject to discussion. No evidence was provided. Also, the casino did not indicate what kind of offense I was accused of.</p>
<p>I ask you for help. $ 1,640 is a lot for me.</p>
