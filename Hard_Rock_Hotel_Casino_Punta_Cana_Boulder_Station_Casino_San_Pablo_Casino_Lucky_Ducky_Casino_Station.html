    <h1>Hard Rock Hotel Casino Punta Cana Boulder Station Casino San Pablo Casino Lucky Ducky Casino Station</h1>

<p>Italy beckons to yet another supplier with ESA Gaming strengthening its standing in the coveted European market once again</p>
<p>The supplier of innovative and lightweight games, and the EasySwipe original series, has teamed up with Octavian Lab, a platform provider, to significantly boost its presence in the market.</p>
<p>ESA Ready to Pick Up Development Pace in 2023</p>
<p>As a result, operators that use Octavian Lab will access a range of excellent games, including but not limited to Basketball Mine, Baccarat, Fruits Staxx, and Goal Mine. These games are just some of the many excellent options that Octavian Lab operators and their audiences will experience.</p>
<p>To sweeten the deal, ESA Gaming is going to expand its portfolio with additional 12 titles in 2023 and the company will feature both Crash and Mine content. ESA Gaming is determined to continue providing the market with solutions that are built around the idea of creating powerful yet lightweight games.</p>
<p>Those titles are easy to integrate and launch with various operators, offering players quick access to outstanding gaming, and adding a distinct level of gamification to the platform itself. ESA Gaming will be able to deploy its products with newly licensed operators that are part of the Octavian Lab’s network, leading to immediate gains for all parties involved and, ultimately – the players.</p>
<p>ESA Gaming is happy to continue growing its portfolio in local markets and create fresh opportunities in new geographies, following broader moves in Europe and Africa. Commenting on this, ESA Gaming Business Development Manager Maria Luisa Malfasi said:</p>
<p>We have had some fantastic momentum recently and have started the year strongly with a number of partnerships that have seen us cement our presence in key markets around the globe. ESA Gaming Business Development Manager Maria Luisa Malfasi</p>
<p>Strong Italian Presence for ESA Gaming</p>
<p>ESA Gaming will undoubtedly double down on content production throughout 2023, Malfasi explained, bringing more worthwhile entertainment to players. Octavian Lab CEO Emanuele Nocentelli has similarly welcomed ESA Gaming and hailed the supplier’s “non-traditional and innovative content.”</p>
<p>Nocentelli added that ESA Gaming’s EasySwipe is quickly becoming a player-favorite and one that players are definitely looking forward to play. ESA has been growing its presence in Italy with the company teaming up with BetFlag in April and further building up its local country presence with NetBet.</p>
