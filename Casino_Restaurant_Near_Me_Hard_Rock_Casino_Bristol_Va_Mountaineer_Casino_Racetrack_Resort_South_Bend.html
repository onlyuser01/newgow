<p>As a result, SkillOnNet partner operators and their players will have access to a range of experiences brought on by BGaming. This library includes slot and arcade-style games, provably fair titles, and more.</p>
<p>BGaming Brings Crash and Unique Historic Games to SkillOnNet</p>
<p>BGaming has been able to create powerful experiences that trace their roots to traditional gaming solutions. One such game is Jogo Do Bicho, which has become a hit with Brazilian players as the online game is based on lottery games played in Brazil in the 19th century.</p>
<p>The studio brings other experiences, too. One such innovative option is SpaceXY, a crash game with social multiplayer features that is very popular with new generations of players. The game is based on the traditional crash experience whereby players bet on how far a rocket can make before it crashes and burns.</p>
<p>The farther out it makes it, the bigger the multiplier becomes. Commenting on this new opportunity, SkillOnNet head of games Jani Kontturi said that BGaming was a great addition to the platform. He particularly praised the Jogo Do Bicho and crash-style games supplied by the company and remarked on their success in the South American iGaming markets:</p>
<p>This is not just a portfolio of really good games, it’s content that will engage and delight old-school gamers and emerging demographics alike. SkillOnNet head of games Jani Kontturi</p>
<p>BGaming co-chief product owner Yulia Aliakseyeva was similarly pleased with this opportunity. She remarked that BGaming has enjoyed a “phenomenal year” of growth and that the company is determined to use the latest opportunity with SkillOnNet to continue growing across the board.</p>
<p>“We feel we’re both on the same page when it comes to casino gaming, with a commitment to content that offers something dazzling, diverse and different,” Aliakseyeva explained. BGaming has achieved significant milestones in 2022, the company reported in an update shared in December.</p>
<p>The 12-month period saw a serious uptake in the number of products and employees working with the company. In 2022, the company expanded its team to 120 people, from 64 in January of that same year. BGaming is committed to continuing to grow through smart business decisions such as its latest tie-up with SkillOnNet.</p>
