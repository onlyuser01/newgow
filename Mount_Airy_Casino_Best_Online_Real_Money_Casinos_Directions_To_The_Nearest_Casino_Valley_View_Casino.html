<p>Tale of the Tape Kasanganay vs Harris</p>
<p>Impa Kasanganay Stats Cariston Harris 5’11” Height 6’0″ 170 lbs Weight 170 lbs 75″ Reach 76″ Orthodox Stance Orthodox 9-1-0 Record 16-4-0</p>
<p>Harris Debuts in the UFC against Hardened Kasanganay</p>
<p>Here is a bout that will pit two impressive fighters. Cariston Harris is coming into the bout as a debutant as he has a single showing in the promotion so far, which he won against Christian Aguilera in May this year.</p>
<p>With a single showing in the UFC, you may think that Harris is really not someone to back. Yet, his overall career record stands at 16-4-0 and that’s already a good showing, especially in a sport as dangerous as MMA. He submitted Aguilera in 2:52 in his debut and he’s riding a four-win streak. All in all, he is a worthy contender and posted just behind Kasanganay.</p>
<p>For his part, Impa Kasanganay has a better standing in the UFC as he has already clocked in several fights. He lost a single one to Joaquin Buckley, but the other four bouts he had in the promotion resulted in a win. His most recent one in April was against Sasha Palatnikov and took only 26 seconds to complete.</p>
<p>He lost by KO/TKO to Buckley who pulled off a spinning back-kick that caught Kasanganay unawares and resulted in an immediate loss. Yet, despite this, the fighter is very well-rounded. He is able to go the distance as well as submit an opponent.</p>
<p>Posted at (-114), Kasanganay is clearly a favorite, but calling a winner in this fight is hard. The oddsmakers seem to think that the fight will definitely go the distance here and this is the most likely outcome. As to who wins will be in all likelihood result from decision ruling.</p>
