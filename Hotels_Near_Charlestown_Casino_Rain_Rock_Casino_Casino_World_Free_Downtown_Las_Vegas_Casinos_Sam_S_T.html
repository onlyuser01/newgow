    <h1>Hotels Near Charlestown Casino Rain Rock Casino Casino World Free Downtown Las Vegas Casinos Sam S T</h1>

<p>I was trying to get verified so i could withdrawal my funds but they would t accept everything I handed in in regards to the payments. I used MuchBetter and MiFinity ultimately it was MiFinity that I was attempting to withdrawal to. They wouldn’t except all of the information I gave them regarding my MuchBetter account and my MiFinity account. I got much better to contact them on my behalf and I received an email from MuchBetter saying not to worry about it they contacted the merchant site betandplay.com yet they still didn’t accept my accounts approval. I eventually got the proper thing that they were asking for from MuchBetter and I sent it to them yet they still haven’t verified my account and also it should be noted that in the past you could go onto the desktop version of the sites but they’ve change that both muchbetter and MiFinity are strictly mobile apps now. In the past I could get the info they wanted most likely through the desktop versions but it’s impossible now. I eventually lost the funds I was trying to withdrawal. They still haven’t verified my account and I don’t feel safe or fair playing there until they verify my account. Casino guru please help me get verified at this site as I’ve tried my best and have failed every time, even after getting a specific letter from MuchBetter showing exactly what they asked for they still haven’t verified my account. Please let me know if you’d like me to include any specific pics. I’ll include the pics of them denying me and what they’re asking for. I included two pics of them specifically stating why they rejected me as well as the specific letter from muchbetter showing exactly what they asked for, in that pic from MuchBetter the second payment from the top that says $20 and $10 remaining in balance to Dama N.V. Is the appropriate deposit referring to the one I made on betandplay.com. Another thing is the company that accepts the payments is dama n.v. It states that on their site in the fine print yet they keep asking for things that shows payment made to betandplay when they know that’s impossible and they won’t confirm that dama nv is in fact them in regards to payment. Also I’ve included an email from MiFinity showing everything they’ve asked for, the amount my email my name and to dama nv. So along with those four pics I’ll also include the initial pics I sent from muchbetter and MiFinity that I sent to get verified . It’s what is included in those sites in regards to my account info and ability to prove that they are verified and my accounts. Pleased note it’s after I sent those verification pics that they sent the rejection email and the two pics I’ve included they stated what they need from both the sites. Also I said earlier but it’s critical that both these apps now are strictly mobile apps so before when I could go onto these sites on my Mac desktop now I can’t get any info at all in regards to verifying my accounts with them. And any casino should be made aware of that and expecting what they did in the past is a mistake and a tactic to delay payment from them. So again the pics will be</p>
<p>1-what they want from muchbetter</p>
<p>2- what they want from mifinity</p>
<p>3-the letter specifically stating what’s asked from muchbetter</p>
<p>4-an email from MiFinity showing everything they’ve asked for</p>
<p>5-the pics I sent originally from MuchBetter</p>
<p>I just noticed five is the maximum I can send to you if you’d like I can email the rest of the documents to prove everything. Thank you for your assistance in the past and I’m certain this time as well. Unfortunately for me there is no more funds to withdrawal as I lost them all and I’m certain that was the sites intentions and it worked but I still hope that you guys will help me at least get verified from this site so I never run into this problem again.</p>
<p>please ignore the bottom items as I wasn’t able to send them but note that if needed I could email the rest of the proof to you. Also I showed them that from MiFinity and MuchBetter payment was made to dama nv when it was and the amount. But they want that info as well as my email and name and account info all in one page . Everything I showed them they kept rejecting it saying they need one more thing. Every time one more thing they needed, it felt like I was being robbed and I was dealing with a company that had zero intentions of honouring the agreement to payout. Horrible feeling I’m left with, pls ease help me casino guru and thank you.</p>
<p>PICS I DIDNT HAVE ROOM TO SEND BUT CAN EMAIL UPON REQUEST</p>
<p>6- another pic I sent from MuchBetter to get verified</p>
<p>7-pic I sent originally from MiFinity</p>
<p>8-another pic I sent from MiFinity to get verified but all pics were rejected</p>
<p>they wouldn’t confirm that the site that accepts the funds is dama nv.</p>
