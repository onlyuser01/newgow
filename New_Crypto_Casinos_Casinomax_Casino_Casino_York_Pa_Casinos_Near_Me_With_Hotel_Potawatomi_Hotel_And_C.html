<p>888 Holdings, the company behind several gambling brands and websites, has launched its Sports Illustrated Sportsbook in Virginia.</p>
<p>888 Launched SI Sportsbook in Virginia</p>
<p>Following the launch in Colorado in September 2021, the SI Sportsbook is now available to bettors in Virginia as well. The new brand offers the best of 888 and Sports Illustrated and is designed to engage bettors with supreme sports offerings.</p>
<p>SI Sportsbook allows players to bet on many of the most popular sports leagues in the world. This includes the National Football League, the National Basketball League, the National Hockey League, Major League Baseball, the English Premier League and NASCAR among others. Moreover, the sportsbook improves bettor experience with official sports data coming directly from the leagues.</p>
<p>888 Holdings seems to have big plans for the SI Sportsbook. Previously, the company launched the brand in Colorado and is planning to roll it out in more states as well. Furthermore, 888 intends to keep on updating the sportsbook with more content, including more tools, personalization options and improved feeds.</p>
<p>Upon launching in Virginia, 888 also vowed to support minorities. The gambling company has teamed up with Virtual Entertainment Partners, a small company that is committed to helping those in need. By working together, 888 and VEP will provide relief to areas with many minority groups.</p>
<p>The States Remain a Crucial Market to 888’s Strategy</p>
<p>Howard Mittman, the president of 888 United States, spoke about the launch. He shared that his company is excited to roll out the SI sportsbook in the Mother of States. He noted that the successful debut launch in Colorado last September has inspired the company to aim higher. Mittman lauded the Virginia launch as a critical milestone for both 888 and its partners.</p>
<p>Speaking about the launch of the sportsbook in the state, Mittman pointed out that Virginia has an increasing number of sports betting fans. Because of that, he is convinced that the SI Sportsbook will find success in the coming months.</p>
<p>Lastly, Mittman shared his thoughts about 888’s expansion across the United States. He shared that the key US market is crucial to 888’s ambition “to become a global online betting and gaming leader.” Mittman concluded that he cannot wait to see how sports enthusiasts in Virginia react to the sportsbook.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, 888 is on the way to acquiring William Hill, a British gambling company, from Caesars Entertainment. Ten days ago, 888’s shareholders officially greenlit the deal.</p>
