<p>EveryMatrix has continued with its string of appointments, as the company has brought in Bobby Longhurst as the Group's Chief Commercial Officer. Longhurst will assume a number of responsibilities as a result and work closely with the entire executive force to steer and ensure that EveryMatrix’s global efforts meet its targets. He is replacing Stian Hornsletten who was nominated and appointed as the company’s Chief Executive Officer for the Game Division, with the change taking place on February 1, 2024.</p>
<p>Among the executive’s responsibilities are such areas as account management, marketing, and sales, and he will be keeping a firm hand on the rudder to make sure that these come through. As to Longhurst’s appointment, it’s not a chance pick either, as the man has more than 20 years under his belt working in and around iGaming suppliers.</p>
<p>He has served in different positions across a number of entities, including SBTech, Pronet Gaming, and not least SportingTech, and has taken prominent positions within each company’s ecosystem, driving the company’s efforts forward. EveryMatrix Group CEO Ebbe Groes has welcomed the appointment of Longhurst and said that he would be an important contributor to Everymatrix’s growth in 2024 and beyond.</p>
<p>"Bobby is a well-respected and well-known individual within iGaming with extensive commercial, product and strategic experience and knowledge that will provide us with even greater firepower to expand our reach across new and existing verticals, global markets, and technologies. I’d like to welcome and wish him well as we embark on an exciting chapter at EveryMatrix," Groes noted.</p>
<p>Longhurst was himself very excited to be stepping into this new position and helping stage and executive strategies that help spur growth within the company. He noted that EveryMatrix has been building a solid product footprint and looking to rapidly expand its footprint in new jurisdictions, including Latin America.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the company also appointed Nikolina Gabelica as Head of Lottery, as the changes in the company continue at a rapid pace, as EveryMatrix calibrates its team to deliver on an even stronger expeirence this year.</p>
<p>EveryMatrix’s betting division, OddsMatrix, similarly celebrated a record year in numbers, and the company is determined to repeat this feat in 2024.</p>
