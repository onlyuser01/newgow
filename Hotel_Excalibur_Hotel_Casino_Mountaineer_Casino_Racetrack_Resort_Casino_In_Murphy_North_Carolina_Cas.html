<p>Call of Zeus Slot Review</p>
<p>Gaming providers’ fascination for Greek mythology is probably only surpassed by players’ interest in the intriguing theme. This time around, Nucleus Gaming has chosen none other than Zeus, the grand deity of all Greek deities, as the main point of focus for its fresh title released in September 2022.</p>
<p>Centered around the father of both humans and gods, the 5×3 video slot with 5 paylines and a maximum win capped at 1,700x is a dynamic option for players eager to once again climb the mystical Mount Olympus to spin some lucky reels.</p>
<p>With premium graphics, a dynamic way of reflecting players’ payouts on the selected bets, and a plethora of mouthwatering bonus features including Wilds and Wild multipliers, Respins, Free Spins, and Multiplier Wheels, the game primarily addresses fans of Greek mythology-themed slots. However, it also represents a good choice for players hungry for fresh slots to try.</p>
<p>Our experts have compiled a comprehensive Call of Zeus online slot review with all the necessary details regarding the theme, graphics, storyline, payouts, special features, sounds, animations, and gameplay. Let’s get started!</p>
<p>Theme, Storyline, and Graphics: Climb Mount Olympus to Reach High Payouts</p>
<p>The game features an engaging atmosphere that is immediately noticeable upon clicking the start button. The slot has been given a cartoonish design with Mount Olympus seen sitting on the left and Zeus seen floating to the right of the grid.</p>
<p>The semi-transparent reels have been nicely designed with decorations specific to Ancient Greece. Besides Zyes himself, which represents the wild symbol in the game, the slot also depicts detailed images of other iconic Greek mythology characters including Medusa, Pegasus, and Pandora’s Box, along with axes and braziers.</p>
<p>The story revolves around the ultimate deity which rules the skies as well as the weather and destiny of both humans and deities. Zeus is also known as the god of law and order and it will supervise players’ attempts to score big wins by matching symbols and coming across the available special bonus features we are going to discuss later in our review.</p>
<p>Call of Zeus: Game Symbols and Payouts</p>
<p>Pegasus is the highest-paying symbol in the game. It rewards players with wins ranging from 400, 1000, and 2000 for three, four, or five identical symbols on an active payline. The</p>
<p>The Golden Shield symbol and the Pandora’s Box symbol represent the medium-paying symbols on the paytable. Matching three, four, or five Golden Shield symbols rewards players with payouts ranging from 200, 400, and 1000. Landing three to five Pandora’s Box symbols can bring players payouts of 140, 200, and 400. The battle ax and the eternal flame symbols represent the lowest-paying symbols. They trigger payouts of 100, 140, and 200 for three, four, or five battle axes and 40, 60, and 100 for three, four, and five eternal flame symbols.</p>
<p>The game also introduces the 2x Zeus Wild Multiplier and Wild, and Medusa as high-paying symbols. Players who see five 2x Zeus Multiplier symbols landing on the reels score a 25x win of their stake. The regular Zeus Wild replaces the rest of the symbols once a winning combination is completed.</p>
<p>Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>Nucleus Gaming has chosen a powerful soundtrack suitable for the theme and overall storyline. The sound effects also nicely complete the Greek mythology action on the reels while the animations mostly revolve around Zeus, his hand movements while holding the lightning, and his golden trinkets on his clothes.</p>
<p>Call of Zeus Gameplay</p>
<p>Similar to other slots from the same studio, Call of Zeus comes with smooth and simple gameplay that can be controlled with a variety of options and settings. To start exploring them, players must click or tap the “i” tab on the lower left section underneath the grid where they will get a chance to activate or mute the background music and the sound effects in the game, opt for Turbo play mode for fast-paced action on the reels, select a number of auto spins along with the cost of a spin, consult the paytable, or read the detailed rules of the game.</p>
<p>The game pays left to right with the highest win per line reaching players. Coinciding wins triggered on different pay lines are also brought together.</p>
<p>Call of Zeus: Wilds, Stacked Reel Respins &amp; Multiplier Wheels</p>
<p>The slot counts a number of interesting bonus features. Here is what you need to know about them:</p>
<p>Wilds – Once the Zeus symbol is seen landing on the grid and takes the wild, it proceeds to replace the rest of the symbols and potentially generate longer winning combinations. The same symbol can also pop up holding a bolt of lightning, in which case it features powers while potentially doubling players’ wins. In case the multiplier x2 Wilds symbol is part of a winning combination, they will proceed to multiply one another. Both Wild symbols are capable of generating the highest payouts of up to 1000, 2000, and 5000 for three, four, or five symbols landing on active pay lines.</p>

Multiplier Wheel – Once all reel positions are aligned with a unique symbol, players receive a Multiplier Wheel spin. At the end of the spin, players can receive multipliers ranging from x2 to x10.</p>
<p>Final Thoughts</p>
<p>Call of Zeus by Nucleus Gamin is an appealing Greek mythology-themed 5×3 video slot with the same quality graphics and satisfying payouts as most of the games that the studio is known for. With two different types of Wild symbols that nicely round up the payouts, a Stacked Reel Spin feature that is often times seen popping up during the base game where it generates wins of up to 20x the initial stake, and multiplier wilds that can easily bring up to 32x, the 2022-released game has a lot to offer to fans of action-packed titles.</p>
