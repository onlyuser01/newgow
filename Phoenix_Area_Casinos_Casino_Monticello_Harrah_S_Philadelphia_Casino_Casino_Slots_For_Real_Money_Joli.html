<p>Parx Casino launches online sportsbooks</p>
<p>Pennsylvania’s regulator approves the launch</p>
<p>Parx Casino’s revenue takes a slight tumble in May</p>
<p>Parx Casino’s sports betting in Pennsylvania is now fully launched, offering digital betting solutions to the state’s sports buffs.</p>
<p>Done Testing, Parx Casino Online Spots Betting Launches Officially</p>
<p>Greenwood Gaming and Entertainment’s Parx Casino has launched the full offer of its online sports books in Pennsylvania. Powered by GAN and Kambi, Parx’s new sportsbook is now catering to all fans eager to place a sports wager ahead of a larger launch of its online casino arrives in July.</p>
<p>The launch was preceded by a soft launch test period lasting three days with that test period preceded by yet another test earlier in 2019. The latest trial run of the casino’s sportsbook was the last confirmation that the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board (PGCB) needed to give the go-ahead for a full launch.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania is one of the earliest states to launch its sportsbook in the state with Rush Street’s PlaySugarHouse.com, another Kambi-powered betting agency, beating it by split second. GAN has provided the framework platform into which Parx’s offer has been built.</p>
<p>This is just a precursor to a larger gaming and sports betting expansion that will arrive on July 15, when the Keystone State will officially push with a lager-scale expansion of the iGaming and online betting business.</p>
<p>Good Legal Tides for Betting in Pennsylvania</p>
<p>The original schedule had to be deferred from June in anticipation of the Wire Act an enactment, a frivolous piece of legislation threatening the iGaming industry that subsequently got defunded by Congress.</p>
<p>Here is what Greenwood Gaming &amp; Entertainment CEO John Dixon had the following to say in light o the latest events.</p>
<p>“By leveraging GAN’s proven Platform, Parx Casino has rapidly deployed internet sports betting, integrated with our XCLUB on-property rewards program, to become the second Internet sports betting operator to launch in Pennsylvania”</p>
<p>GAN’s CEO Dermot Smurfit also pitched in highlighting the importance of the launch. The platform offers customers a “premium” betting experience and multiple integrated options, Mr. Smurfit noted.</p>
<p>“We look forward to pairing this seamlessly alongside GAN’s market-leading internet casino product that utilizes our patented technology for leveraging on-property reward programs.”</p>
<p>Expanding online is a continuation of the brick-and-mortar efforts by the sportsbook which has been running since January, 2019, arriving over half of year after PASPA was defeated and sportsbooks were enabled to starts accepting wagers, providing local lawmakers approved.</p>
<p>Parx Casino has done well so far, although the launch of PlaySugarHouse.com has bit into some of the profits. SugarHouse collected $7.9 million in total sports handle in May, and retained $711,845, boosted by its online betting options. Meanwhile, the numbers released by PGCB as to the whole 2018/2019 betting year marked a new record.</p>
<p>On June 25, Rivers Casino, another SugarHouse-owned property launched its own online sports betting solution. Pennsylvania is now fast-approaching a fully digital form of wagering.</p>
