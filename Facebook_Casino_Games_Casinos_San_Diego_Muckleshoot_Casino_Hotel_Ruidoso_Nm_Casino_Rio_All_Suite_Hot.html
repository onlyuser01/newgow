<p>DraftKings, an American sports betting and daily fantasy giant, is set to open a new social restaurant in Michigan. The so-called Sports &amp; Social DraftKings is a result of the collaboration between the operator and Live! Hospitality and Entertainment.</p>
<p>The Venue Will Be the First of Its Kind</p>
<p>Sports &amp; Social is a chain of food and beverage venues owned by Live! Hospitality and Entertainment. It joined forces with DraftKings a year ago, when the two agreed to provide sports fans with new food, beverage and entertainment experiences.</p>
<p>The Sports &amp; Social DraftKings venue in Michigan is the first of what DraftKings intends to be a chain of restaurants. It will be located at the Somerset Collection Mall in Detroit and is scheduled to open in a few months. DraftKings and Live! Hospitality and Entertainment hope that the venue will go live this autumn.</p>
<p>The inaugural Sports &amp; Social DraftKings will be a place where sports fans can sit and have a meal or host spectacular parties. The 10,400 square-foot venue will be designed by ICrave, a specialist in strategy and design. The location will be equipped with a huge 32-foot LED media wall that allows customers to watch the latest sports events and stay updated on the latest developments. In addition, Sports &amp; Social DraftKings visitors will be able to access the operator’s sports betting and fantasy sports offerings through their mobile phones while dining and watching their favorite games.</p>
<p>Fans will also be able to rent a special DraftKings Lounge and host private gatherings. There will be an outdoor area where people can host atmospheric outdoor parties and socialize with their fellow sports enthusiasts.</p>
<p>DraftKings Is Looking Forward to Engaging Sports Fans</p>
<p>Reed Cordish, chief executive of Live! Hospitality and Entertainment, spoke about the development. He is excited about the upcoming opening of Sports &amp; Social DraftKings and is glad to be working with the operator. Cordish described the sports betting company as an industry leader and added that this makes him incredibly excited for the conjoined project.</p>
<p>We are creating a new standard for dining and sports entertainment with Sports &amp; Social DraftKings that is unmatched. Reed Cordish, CEO, Live! Hospitality and Entertainment</p>
<p>DraftKings’ senior director of retail sportsbooks, Michael Kibort, also shared his thoughts. Kibort revealed that his team is thrilled to open the inaugural Sports and Social DraftKings venue. He believes that sports fans are going to love the new venue and all it has to offer.</p>
<p>Kibort thanked Live! Hospitality and Entertainment for their amazing help. Thanks to them, Kibort is sure that DraftKings will provide fans with a premier dining, sports and entertainment destination.</p>
