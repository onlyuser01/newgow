<p>What are no deposit casino bonuses?</p>
<p>A no deposit casino bonus is any casino offer that gives players an option to play and win something without making a deposit or spending any money. Essentially, no deposit bonuses are free offers from online casinos for new or existing players.</p>
<p>Most commonly, no deposit bonuses are offered to new players, as casinos use them as an incentive to motivate new players to sign up and start playing. However, many casinos also offer free no deposit bonuses to existing players, usually to reward them as part of their loyalty scheme or during special promotional events.</p>
<p>Note: Apart from no deposit offers, there are other popular types of online casino bonuses. For example, deposit bonuses are awarded to players for depositing real money into their casino account, whereas cashback bonuses give players a percentage of their losses back as bonus funds.</p>
<p>Types of no deposit casino bonuses</p>
<p>There are many ways to classify no deposit bonuses offered by casinos. In terms of what you get when you claim or activate a bonus, no deposit offers can take one of these forms:</p>
<p>Free cash no deposit – With free cash bonuses, you get a certain amount of bonus funds added to your account. You can usually play a wide range of available slots and casino games with your free cash, although there may be some limitations, which we will cover below.</p>

Free spins no deposit – When you get a free spin bonus, the casino adds a number of prepaid spins to your account. These are usually usable solely on online slots, and often limited to a single specific game or a small number of games. This means that you have to stick to one of the selected no deposit bonus slots in most cases, which may be less enjoyable than playing your preferred titles.</p>
