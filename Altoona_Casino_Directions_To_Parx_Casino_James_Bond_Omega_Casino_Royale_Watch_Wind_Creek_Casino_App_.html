<p>Sports wagering news, expert picks and betting guides provider Bookies.com has unveiled a partnership with the sporting event promotions company Matchroom ahead of the boxing match between Teofimo Lopez and George Kambosos Junior.</p>
<p>A Boxing Event to Remember</p>
<p>The agreement will see Bookies.com as the official betting partner of the lightweight clash between the unified world champion Teofimo Lopez and IBF mandatory challenger George Kambosos Junior. The fight is scheduled for November 27 and will take place at the Hulu Theater at the Madison Square Garden in New York.</p>
<p>Both contestants have a perfect professional record, meaning that this will be a match to remember. Lopez currently has a record of 16-0 with 12 knockouts behind his back. Kambosos Jr has a similar history with 19 victories against zero losses and has scored 10 professional KOs.</p>
<p>Matchroom Sport’s chairman and fight promoter, Eddie Hearn, spoke about the event. He pointed to the building anticipation, which is going to “reach fever point” at Thanksgiving.</p>
<p>“Bookies.com will be there to give fight fans the inside track on what promises to be an all-out war at the Manhattan mecca of boxing,” Hearn noted.</p>
<p>The fight will be broadcast on the American video-sharing social networking service Triller. Triller’s competitor, the global over-the-top sports subscription video streaming service DAZN, will provide another, more internationally-focused content in relation to the game.</p>

The betting news outlet will keep fans updated on the match’s development and will host interviews with the two competitors.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Bookies.com will be in charge of various social media contests with various prizes. Other than offering fans the chance to win event tickets from interacting, Bookies will tempt collectors with a set of signed boxing gloves that they can win.</p>
<p>Max Bichsel, the vice president of US Business at Bookies.com’s ownership group, Gambling.com, commented on the brand’s upcoming presence at the event. According to him, the company’s goal is to become the match’s go-to source for bettors who want to get some meaningful stats, unique commentary and expert picks.</p>
<p>“Boxing has long been synonymous with betting, and we expect the November 27 Lopez vs Kambosos Jr fight to continue boxing’s return to the mainstream spotlight,” Bichsel said.</p>
