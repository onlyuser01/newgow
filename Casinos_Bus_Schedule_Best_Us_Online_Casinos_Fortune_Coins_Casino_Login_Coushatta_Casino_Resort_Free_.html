<p>Cash of Command review</p>
<p>Theme and Style</p>
<p>Get ready to join the Navy with Cash of Command.</p>
<p>Players will take in a deep breath of salt air as they prepare to fight for an array of mysterious jewels. If they can outsmart their opponents, they’ll scoop up a variety of precious gems before the sea swallows them.</p>
<p>This slot is a good fit for players who enjoy gem themes, but also love a good military twist.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The soundtrack consists of ambient mechanical sounds and muffled voices. This adds to the feeling that players are in the midst of an active naval regiment.</p>
<p>The transparent reels allow players to see the green-blue water of the ocean in the background. Delicate white clouds also drift through the sky, casting shadows on the water. In each of the lower corners of the screen, tanks are poised at the ready, reminding players that this is no beach holiday.</p>
<p>The symbols include a variety of jewels, including green sapphires, red rubies, and blue sapphires, each framed in gold. Light seems to illuminate the gems, making them seem especially enticing.</p>
<p>Beside the reels, players will see several cartoon-style characters from a young spunky officer to a weathered bearded seaman to the evil Baron Fusco.</p>
<p>Together, the animation and soundtrack create an entertaining naval fantasy.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Cash of Command is a nine-reel, nine-row slot.</p>
<p>Wins are awarded for landing 5 or more matching symbols connected vertically or horizontally.</p>
<p>After paying out, winning symbols disappear from the reels, making way for new symbols to fall into their positions.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>There is a meter beside the reels that goes up as players get winning combinations. Different Navy Heroes release their ships as their level on the meter is reached. These ships then offer players unique power-ups on the reels.</p>
<p>These power-ups include: Wilds added to the reels, transformations of symbols to matching symbols, and the addition of extra large symbols.</p>
<p>If players fill the meter entirely, they will defeat Baron Fusco and 2 of the 3 ships on the reels will be destroyed. This will leave one ship which will be transformed into a Super Ship, awarding a special power-up.</p>
<p>The Baron’s Turrets feature can be activated at random during any non-winning spin, removing symbols from the reels and replacing them with Wilds.</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>

<p>Conclusion</p>

<p>With a reasonable RTP and ample volatility, Cash of Command is a decent pick for mathematically-inclined players.</p>
<p>The bonuses and entertaining theme add even more appeal to this seafaring slot.</p>
