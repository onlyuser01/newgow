    <h1>Flamingo Casino Las Vegas Mohegan Casino Las Vegas Saratoga Casino Morongo Casino Spa Resort Cool Ca</h1>

<p>Dear sardapoor,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. I have checked the Responsible Gaming section of the Universal Slots Casino, and this is what I found (here):</p>
<p>"Account Self-Exclusion</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Only after the period of self-exclusion has expired can the user request to reopen their account. At the point a user chooses to be self-excluded further account control settings are updated on our gaming platform to ensure self-excluded individuals do not receive targeted marketing or promotional materials. Self-exclusion is a agreement whereby the customer and operator agree that the user should refrain from gambling for the set period of time and by doing so should not create any further accounts with the operator. Additionally, the operator should employ all reasonable measure to ensure that the user has not been able to get on the site and create any new accounts. We take responsible gambling very seriously and if you try to open other accounts with us during your period of exclusion we will do our best to detect and close them."</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there isn’t written that all your accounts in other casinos of the same owner will be blocked or self-excluded automatically. Please understand that if you self-exclude yourself from one casino it doesn’t necessarily mean that you are protected on all the other associated websites.</p>
<p>Could you please advise if you have requested a self-exclusion from Rapid Casino directly? Please forward any supporting evidence that your other accounts have been excluded due to a gambling problem. My email address is petronela.k@casino.guru.</p>
<p>Looking forward to hearing from you.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
