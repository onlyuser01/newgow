<p>Toward the end of October, BetMakers Technology Group announced it was prepared for the acquisition of Punting Form, a decision that would significantly enhance its racing products. Now, the leading supplier of racing data, trading solutions, and analytics has announced a fresh distribution partnership with the Victorian Thoroughbred Racing IMB (VTRIMB). The latter is Racing Victoria’s media business.</p>
<p>BetMakers to Offer Victorian Live Horse Content</p>
<p>According to the terms of the new deal, BetMakers will be allowed to include a feed consisting of Victorian horse races into its platform. The same feed will also be incorporated into the streaming solutions offered to betting service providers in Australia. The company’s chief executive officer Todd Buckingham announced BetMakers was delighted to sign the distribution deal with VTRIMB for Racing.com’s live horse racing vision. In exchange, he explained, this would help BetMakers make its state-of-the-art content available to a larger number of consumers while increasing interest in Victorian horse racing. Buckingham added that the content will keep filling the “product gap” for their platform customers, being the first “exciting” update the company will introduce to the public.</p>
<p>“A Win-Win for All Parties”</p>
<p>The wagering technology and data partner for some of the most reputable sportsbooks and rights holders on the planet has also expressed its commitment to continue its collaborations and expand its reach and distribution numbers. At the same time, BetMakers aims to deliver added value to customers while bringing rights holders additional advantages, turning the new deal into a “win-win for all parties.”</p>
<p>The agreement that will allow BetMakers to provide its content to up to 25 new distribution partners in the Australian online betting market was also discussed by VTRIMBs’ chief executive officer Peter Campbell. The CEO spoke about the Victorian racing industry’s interest in guaranteeing “the broadest possible distribution and reach” for live Victorian horse races. Campbell called BetMakers’ distribution platform an “important route to market” in the fast-evolving market. He also expressed their delight about the new collaboration with the company that aims to deliver “great technology outcomes for consumers” while providing their live racing coverage to a constantly growing audience.</p>
<p>Racing Victoria represents the Victorian Thoroughbred industry in relation to important bodies including the Australian Racing Board and it is also responsible for the marketing of these races. In June, BetMakers announced a new agreement with Penn National Gaming for the distribution of the casino operator’s racing data and content for booked bets, fixed odds, as well as exchange wagering services outside the markets in the US and Canada.</p>
