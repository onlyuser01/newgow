    <h1>Turtle Lake Hotel Casino Palm Springs Casino Hotels Casino In Sacramento Excalibur Hotel Casino Casi</h1>

<p>EvenBet Gaming, the Malta-based developer of software for the gaming industry, has been granted a B2B Critical Supply License by the Malta Gaming Authority (MGA), opening up new markets for its digital gaming products.</p>
<p>Online Poker Expert</p>
<p>EvenBet Gaming, a gaming company with 15 years of experience and over 70 projects running across the world and a participant at ICE London industry expo, is famous for its leading online poker platform, certified by major gaming labs, bringing innovation and entertainment into the online poker and casino games markets.</p>
<p>European Expansion</p>
<p>The supplier license issued by the MGA and covering EvenBet’s core poker, casino and sports betting integrations, gives the company the desired access to expand into the European market and beyond. It is seen as an important milestone in building its future operator network.</p>
<p>Poker-Unique Features</p>
<p>The world-class online poker software, with EvenBet’s 30 dedicated poker games, will now be available to a wide scope of iGaming companies operating in this industry-leading jurisdiction and licensed under the MGA. The platform is unique as it contains hundreds of slots and other casino games, as well as letting poker players place bets on live sports events within the online poker rooms they play.</p>
<p>Historical Milestone</p>
<p>EvenBet’s CEO Dmitry Starostenkov expressed his delight at the news, stressing on the importance of the MGA’s recognition for the business by granting the supplier license. He described this as an important milestone in the history of the company and the starting point of significant expansion in the reach of its services. The certification comes at an important junction, as the popularity of online poker has been growing exponentially for the past few months.</p>
<p>Poker Demand Growing</p>
<p>Due to the closure of land-based gaming facilities and the enforced stay-at-home orders, many traditional players have decided to switch, at least temporarily, to online poker play, and EvenBet’s expertise developed throughout the years is allowing the company to position itself as the perfect partner for poker operators, capable to meet the increasing demand for entertaining gaming.</p>
<p>Online poker increasing role has been widely discussed at the recent SBC’s Digital Summit, with opinions prevailing that its importance has been strongly emphasized during the months with no sports betting offering for the operators. And EvenBet’s online poker turned out to be a “lifesaver for sports betting operators”, rising in popularity among players and operators alike.</p>
