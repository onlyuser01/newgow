<p>Entain, the new name of gaming group GVC Holdings, announced today a new initiative, launching a foundation to help support the development of grassroots football in the UK. Partnering with the 3 Trident Leagues, the Isthmian, Northern Premier and Southern Leagues, the gaming company established the Trident Community Foundation (TCF).</p>
<p>Rebranding and Sustainability Charter Goals</p>
<p>Shareholders of GVC Holdings voted in favor of the new name for the gaming group at an extraordinary general meeting December 9, and effective December 10, the gaming operator changed its name to Entain, celebrating the rebranding by revealing a new-look corporate website.</p>
<p>In a media release, Entain provided further details regarding its sustainability goals outlined through the Sustainability Charter. As part of the company’s commitment to invest in people and communities where it operates, Entain pledged to invest in the Entain Foundation £100 million over five years.</p>
<p>As part of that initiative and to build on its recently launched in support of grassroots football “Pitching In” investment program, Entain announced the launch of the TCF to help fund community-based projects by providing access to grant funding for all 228 football clubs in the leagues. Entain donated £150,000 to the TCF to make community-based projects across non-league clubs happen, starting from the rest of 2020/2021 season.</p>
<p>“… This unique and exciting partnership will provide grassroots support where it is needed most for the benefit of community-based football clubs, and the thousands of people that play for them, work for them, volunteer for them, and support them…” Shay Segev, CEO, Entain Group</p>
<p>Provide Funding for Community-Based Projects</p>
<p>Community programs will be at the center of the TCF, looking to develop, improve and support football clubs with small and medium-sized projects which embody the vision of the Entain Foundation in support of young talent and popularization to a wider audience of non-league football to help attract volunteers for the Trident League clubs.</p>
<p>“I’m personally thrilled that Pitching In and the Trident Leagues are launching this Foundation, as I know first-hand what a big difference these grants will make to the community football clubs playing at this level of the football pyramid…” Stuart Pearce, Ambassador, Pitching In</p>
<p>To provide best chances for Trident League clubs to obtain funding for their community-based projects, the fund application process will be kept simple and no project will be too small, but the first year funding will be capped at £5,000, an amount that could increase in the subsequent years.</p>
<p>“… Our clubs are at the heart of their local communities and the Fund will provide them with the means to strengthen those links. No scheme is too small and we hope that as many clubs as follows take advantage of this new funding.” Nick Robinson, Chairman, Isthmian; Mark Harris, Chairman, Northern Premier; Anthony Hughes, Vice Chairman, Southern League</p>
<p>The Entain Foundation has set ambitious goals in other jurisdictions, besides the UK. In the US, the group is rolling out an extensive state-by-state program with EPIC, a charitable organization looking to educate people to play safely by setting an example with former athletes and people who have successfully overcome gambling addiction.</p>
<p>In Australia, the Entain Foundation, in partnership with the community-based nonprofit Relationships Australia, will fund a social media campaign aimed at vulnerable audiences, to raise awareness of gambling addiction signs, while in Germany the foundation will continue to support existing sports integrity projects.</p>
