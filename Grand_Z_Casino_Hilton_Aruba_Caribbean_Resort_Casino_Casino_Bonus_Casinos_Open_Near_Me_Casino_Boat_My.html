<p>Greece is determined to grow its iGaming market with the country now approving Quickspin, a prominent developer and provider of online casino solutions for a supplier license. The license is issued by the Hellenic Gaming Commission which oversees all gambling-related matters in the country, including the issuance and evaluation of licenses and applicants.</p>
<p>New Opportunities in the Regulated iGaming Market</p>
<p>It will be the first instance when Quickspin products will be available to the Greek market and through licensed operators in the country. Quickspin is an author of a number of excellent slot games, such as Big Bad Wolf Megaways, Eastern Emeralds, Sticky Bandits 3: Most Wanted, and many others.</p>
<p>Quickspin CEO Panagiotis Chryssovitsanos noted that this was the result of the hard work that the company has been putting in over the past months. He noted:</p>
<p>The entrance into the Greek market is the culmination of months of hard work from members of the Quickspin team and I could not be prouder of them for all the effort they put into this project. Quickspin CEO Panagiotis Chryssovitsanos</p>
<p>The executive confirmed that the brand’s exposure to the market will help it continue to gather strategic momentum and provide a quality product in a thriving regulated market. Quickspin is committed to building safe, sustainable, and entertaining gaming products that make players feel good.</p>
<p>The move was also welcomed by Quickspin CCO Anthony Dalla-Giacoma who was happy with the development and said that Quickspin was thrilled to bring its games to market in Greece. “I look forward to working with more local partners in the near future,” Dalla-Giacoma concluded. Quickspin is yet to announce the names of any potential companies it would be working with.</p>
