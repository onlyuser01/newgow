    <h1>Hollywood Casino Detroit What States Have Casinos Planet Hollywood Resort Casino Reviews Hard Rock C</h1>

<p>BF Games, a provider of online casino games and a developer of cutting-edge titles, has signed a new partnership with Arena Casino, a Croatian iGaming operator</p>
<p>As a result, Arena Casino will have the opportunity to benefit from the supplier’s distinct portfolio of games, with a particular focus on slots. Under the terms of the agreement, Arena Casino will be able to launch 30 of BF Games’ products and bring them to its player bases.</p>
<p>Presently, BF Games has a number of outstanding titles that Arena Casino is keen to introduce to its audiences. Among those are Cave of Xmas, Chicken Madness, Stunning Cash, and so many others.</p>
<p>Building on Success in Europe and Beyond</p>
<p>BF Games head of business development Claudia Melcaru welcomed the opportunity to team up with Arena Casino as a prominent brand in the Croatian market:</p>
<p>This deal with Arena Casino will significantly enhance our position in the Croatian market where our games have gained a large following. BF Games head of business development Claudia Melcaru</p>
<p>Arena Casino is also happy to build its slot portfolio which the company argues is one of the biggest in Croatia. The addition of BF Games will give it a further boost and help it expand into the sector a notch further. As to the supplier, having the opportunity to team up with a fresh casino is a testament to its success as a brand that is able to stand on its own two feet and bring its products to bear in fresh jurisdictions.</p>
<p>BF Games has reaffirmed its European clout, but the company is similarly exploring other opportunities, including in North America, which is expected to be one of the biggest iGaming markets in the world with regulators slowly but steadily passing the necessary laws on a state level.</p>
<p>BF Games is confident that its European expansion with Arena Casino will pay off, citing how successful and popular the brand is with local audiences and how it can benefit from what the supplier has described as “smash hits.”</p>
<p>The supplier has also signed partnerships with other Croatian brands, including Fortuna Entertainment Group and its online casino brand PSK. To meet its North American ambitions, the company has teamed up with SCCG Management.</p>
