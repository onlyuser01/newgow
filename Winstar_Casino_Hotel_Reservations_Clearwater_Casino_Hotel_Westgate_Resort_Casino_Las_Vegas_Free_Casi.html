    <h1>Winstar Casino Hotel Reservations Clearwater Casino Hotel Westgate Resort Casino Las Vegas Free Casi</h1>

<p>I deposited only this month 2000€, i'm not a sunday player, and now for a winning of 1000€ in total i wait about 1 month.</p>
<p>Everything seems to be ok, the kyc it's completed, it' 1000€ of total 2700€ (but max cashout it's 1000€) and first time casino told me that i cancel withdrawl and use another card...ok no problem, we try with visa circuit.</p>
<p>Later told me that i cancel withdrawl with card and i use skrill (and it's ok, cancel another time the pending withdrawal).</p>
<p>Later contact me in chat and told to cancel another time the withdrawal and divided the amount in 5 small withdrawals of 200€ each one.</p>
<p>But if i divided in 200€ each one i can't cashout 1000€ because the limit is only 3 pending withdrawl!</p>
<p>So I was left with € 600 divided in 3 pending withdrawals and € 400 in my gaming account.</p>
<p>After about 2 weeks finally the first withdrawal is completed and i received my first 200€ on skrill account, So now that there were 2 withdrawals in progress i make another 200€ withdrawal from the remaining 400€ on my account.</p>
<p>And that's all, from that day I stayed for about 1 month with another 3 withdrawals pending of € 200 each, € 200 still left in the game account and the inability to play (otherwise the funds in the game account would mix) and without my money.</p>
<p>I need my € 800 blocked by the casino which in the meantime tells me not to worry ("the funds will be payed obligatory") and that they just need time without giving me other explanations.</p>
