    <h1>Online Casino Roulette Yama Casino Cafe Casino Lv Online Real Cash Casinos Casinos In Nebraska Gamin</h1>

<p>Gaming Corps, a company known for the development of premium casino games, has teamed up with Betfair Casino, one of the most prominent brands on the iGaming landscape, and an established operator with an impeccable reputation. As a result, Betfair Casino and Gaming Corps will work together to advance their footprint in the highly coveted and fast-evolving Latin American market for online casinos.</p>
<p>This move comes only days after Betfair Colombia changed ownership to Stake, as the latter company is looking to also gain a foothold into the region and expand rapidly across Latin America. Despite the drop of one of its operators, Betfair has not given up on LatAm in the slightest, now doubling down on its local presence through Gaming Corps which will bring an exciting variety of games to local players.</p>
<p>Gaming Corps will now deliver bespoke and branded versions of its original Penalty Champion and Mine titles, among others. The company also develops titles across plinko, slot games, table games, and crash.</p>
<p>Amongst its most recent releases are titles such as Raging Zeus Mines, Wild Woof, and 9 Jokers, with entire franchises now established by the supplier as some of the most outstanding content that casinos can ask for. Gaming Corps has already worked with some of the largest iGaming operators in the industry, including Kindred Group, to whom it also delivered Crash and Plinko titles.</p>
<p>Betfair Casino is one of the oldest-standing websites, too, after the dedicated casino was established in 2006, several years after the launch of the Betfair Exchange in 200. Commenting on this fresh opportunity, Gaming Corps Director of Sales Mats Ludin said that the partnership was a significant milestone for his company.</p>
<p>"Betfair has become a well-established brand in LatAm, and we will be delighted to provide our first-class games to players in those markets," Ludin added. He also hailed the alliance as it allowed the companies to work closely together and grow their respective footprint in the Latin American market.</p>
<p>The news was welcomed on a similarly positive note by Betfair International Commercial Director Gaming Stefano Buse who said that the addition of Gaming Corps’ dedicated titles will further add variety and spice to Betfair’s existing content library.</p>
<p>Gaming Corps recently signed another partnership covering four distinct operators and brands, and bringing its dedicated portfolio to WildSultan, SlotsMillion, Winoui, and Madnix.</p>
