    <h1>Coyote Casino The Mirage Casino Tri State Racetrack And Casino Fantasy Springs Casino Hotel Casino F</h1>

<p>The prominent supplier of B2B esports solutions has agreed to extend its partnership with the Central and Eastern European operator</p>
<p>As a result, BETER’s dedicated esports solutions will now be extended to Fortuna Entertainment Group (FEG)’s offer and help the operator build its presence in the world of competitive video gaming betting.</p>
<p>BETER Extends Esports Backing with More Feeds and Odds</p>
<p>BETER presently covers more than 25,000 live events every year, and this extensive coverage will similarly be made available to FEG. Customers will have the opportunity to explore a wide range of games and tournaments and enjoy one of the best possible uptimes in the esports betting industry.</p>
<p>BETER will extend both odds feeds as well as full coverage of esports tournaments and events so that FEG can provide esports aficionados with a 360-degree experience. BETER’s esports offering is touted as one of the best in the sector, and the company has a dedicated division that is laser-focused on the fast-developing vertical.</p>
<p>BETER employs expert traders who are able to give partner businesses a competitive edge. The extension of their mutual partnership is an important step forward as well. The companies originally launched an alliance focused on esports in 2020.</p>
<p>As per the terms of that agreement, BETER has been providing FEG with 24/7 in-house tournament coverage through its ESportsBattle solutions, which offers eHockey, eBasketball, eFootball and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive games. BETER Esports general manager Evgeniy Bekker was excited to see the esports partnership between the two companies take a new, more involved shape.</p>
<p>Working with leading operators gives us an excellent opportunity to continue driving the iGaming industry with the best possible esports betting product. BETER Esports general manager Evgeniy Bekker</p>
<p>New Opportunities for Growth in Esports</p>
<p>Bekker noted that he felt confident in the success of this extended partnership and noted that BETER would be helping FEG significantly enhance its esports markets and services offered to customers. FEG head of trading operations Polinský Tomáš was similarly pleased with the development.</p>
<p>Tomáš hailed BETER as a reliable and effective partner, and the company was pleased that it has a chance to extend that collaboration and take it a step further. “We expect plenty more achievements and successes on the market with the professionals at BETER by our side,” he concluded.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, BETER has been building up its presence in the esports ecosystem. It recently teamed up with GRID and expanded its ESportsBattle solutions with the addition of Dota 2 events.</p>
