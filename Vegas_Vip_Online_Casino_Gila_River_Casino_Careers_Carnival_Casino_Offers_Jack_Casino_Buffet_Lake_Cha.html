    <h1>Vegas Vip Online Casino Gila River Casino Careers Carnival Casino Offers Jack Casino Buffet Lake Cha</h1>

<p>HeadsUp Entertainment, an iGaming operator, has entered a strategic partnership with Centurion Fight Club, an MMA organization. Thanks to the agreement, Centurion FC will be able to use HeadsUp’s media platforms as a way to promote its events with the most recent one being on July 2 in Valletta, Malta.</p>
<p>Centurion FC Will Reap the Benefits of GameChangerz</p>
<p>According to the details of the agreement, Centurion FC will be able to use GameChangerz. The media platform will provide live coverage and what’s even more interesting, new sports betting lottery game will come as a result of the partnership.</p>
<p>GameChangerz is a multi-platform betting site that provides customers with various information via articles. The platform is a partner with Chaos Integrated Inc., a top social media and analytic expert company, as a way to build player databases for its marketing referrals.</p>
<p>Centurion FC’s CEO, Roberto Gallo, commented on the development by saying that the MMA promotion is excited to be partnering up with HeadsUp to provide fans with a new real-time sports betting experience. Gallo added that Centurion is “built setting the bar higher” and complemented HeadsUp by saying that the company is a sports betting and innovation leader.</p>
<p>HeadsUp’s president and CEO, Doug Wilson, noted that the company’s platforms “are a game-changer” and with Centurion’s partnership, fans will be able to reap the benefits of an elevated sports betting experience. The companies will also be able to monetize their products “in a next-generation capacity.”</p>
<p>Centurion will be hosting MMA events at the LIVE iGaming festivals thanks to a partnership with SIGMA World’s Gaming Festivals. This is a massive advantage for HeadsUp due to the fact that many of the world’s leading sports betting brands are present at these events and the company will be able to showcase its products on a massive stage.</p>
<p>HeadsUp Recently Expanded Its Presence in the US and Canada</p>
<p>At the start of June, HeadsUp announced that it will be launching its services in six jurisdictions in the US, as well as in Canada’s newly regulated market – Ontario. As part of its initiatives, the company partnered with Enteractive Media, an event and multi-platform broadcasting company.</p>
<p>Thanks to this partnership, HeadsUp will be able to create daily sports betting content. Moreover, the two companies will work together in several affiliate operations, starting with Casino Affiliate Partners.</p>
<p>With the Casino Affiliate Program, HeadsUp’s GameChangerz will be a sub-licensed operator and will drive traffic for leading brands like PointsBet, DraftKings and Fanduel. Details showed that the partnership may lead to more than 60 affiliate revenue deals in North America.</p>
