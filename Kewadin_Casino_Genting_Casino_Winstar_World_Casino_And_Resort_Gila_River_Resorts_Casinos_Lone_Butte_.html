<p>Philadelphia 76ers Have Faith in the 2023 NBA MVP</p>
<p>Philly‚Äôs Joel Embiid is the new NBA MVP, but since the start of the playoffs, he hasn‚Äôt been playing at an MVP level. He did put on a couple of big performances, but not as great as in the regular season. For instance, in the 76ers last regular-season game against the Celtics, he scored 52 points, while also recording 13 rebounds and six assists.</p>

<p>In the most recent playoff game against the Celtics, he scored 26 points, along with 10 rebounds, and just one assist. The worst thing is that his teammates didn‚Äôt do great in that game either. James Harden, for example, scored just 13 points ‚Äì and he was their third-best scorer that day.</p>
<p>If they want to get a shot at the Conference title, all of the 76ers will have to up their game. Unfortunately, they‚Äôre going to face super-motivated Celtics, who, on top of everything, will have their crowd to cheer them on from the stands of TD Garden.</p>
<p>Boston Celtics are (Almost) Impossible to Beat at TD Garden</p>
<p>In the regular season, the Boston Celtics went 32-9 at home. Only the Milwaukee Bucks have done the same, but even they haven‚Äôt done as great points-wise. At home, the Celtics scored more points than any other team in the conference, while also conceding the third-lowest number. That said, one can say that in the 2022-23 season, the Celtics are the best home side in the NBA.</p>
<p>At least, that‚Äôs true for the regular season. In the postseason, however, their home record is 3-3. Two of those three losses happened to the 76ers. The first one was a sort of glitch ‚Äì Philly won the game thanks to James Harden‚Äôs vintage performance that saw him put away 45 points.</p>
<p>The second loss happened in Game 5, and it was a deserved win for the visitors who were brilliant in the offense. However, the Celtics seem to have learned their lesson in that match, as evident from the fact that they went to Philly in Game 6 and won 95-86. It was the 76ers‚Äô worst offensive display of 2023.</p>
<p>Philadelphia 76ers vs Boston Celtics Prediction</p>
<p>We expect the Celtics to absolutely dominate this game. They‚Äôre bound to do well defensively, keeping the opposition to well under 100 points. When it comes to Boston‚Äôs offense, Jayson Tatum and Jalen Brown should do great, helping their team get a win, covering the spread along the way.</p>
<p>Pick: Boston Celtics to win and cover the spread; under to hit</p>
