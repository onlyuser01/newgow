<p>Kansas City Chiefs vs Las Vegas Raiders is the first game of the final gameweek of the regular season</p>
<p>The Kansas City Chiefs have secured their place in the playoffs, but it’s still not certain whether they’ll finish no. 1 in the AFC and get a first-round bye. Likely for them, their destiny is in their hands – they just need to beat the unmotivated Las Vegas Raiders in Week 18.</p>

<p>Place : Allegiant Stadium in Paradise, Nevada</p>
<p>: Allegiant Stadium in Paradise, Nevada Date : Saturday, January 7, 2023</p>

<p>Kansas City Chiefs to Secure the AFC No. 1 Spot</p>
<p>The Chiefs are 13-3 this season, which is one win more than the Buffalo Bills and two more than the Cincinnati Bengals, both of which have played a game fewer than the Chiefs. They were supposed to play one another, but the Bills vs Bengals game was abandoned after Buffalo’s Damar Hamlin suffered a cardiac arrest on the field.</p>
<p>What this means is that if the Chiefs don’t beat the Raiders on Saturday, there will be a possibility that they might drop out from the top spot. Still, the chances that the Chiefs don’t win look very slim. First of all, they’re in much better shape than the Raiders with four straight wins.</p>
<p>Further, the Chiefs seem to love playing against the Raiders. They are 9-1 against this opponent in the last 10 meetings. The Chiefs’ most recent trip to Allegiant Stadium saw them blow out the opponents 41-14.</p>
<p>Las Vegas Raiders’ Season Is Over</p>
<p>The Raiders are 6-10 right now, meaning that the season is over for them. Whatever happens in Week 18, they will not make the playoffs. They did have a good chance to get there but they lost three games in the previous four gameweeks.</p>
<p>And all of those losses were painful for their fans. For instance, they lost by just one point to the Los Angeles Rams. They also lost by just three points to the Pittsburgh Steelers. Finally, in their first game of 2023, the Raiders lost to the San Francisco 49ers by three points in overtime.</p>
<p>Kansas City Chiefs vs Las Vegas Raiders Prediction</p>
<p>The Raiders probably aren’t in a great mood now that it’s clear that they’ve gambled away their chances of making the playoffs. It’s just the opposite when it comes to the Chiefs. They’re in a great mood and are coming to Vegas to get a big win.</p>
