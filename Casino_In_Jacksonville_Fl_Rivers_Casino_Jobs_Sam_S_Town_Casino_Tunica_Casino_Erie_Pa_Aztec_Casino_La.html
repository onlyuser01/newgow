<p>Real Dealer Studios, a groundbreaking developer of online casino content, has launched its cinematically produced portfolio in the Romanian and Greece markets. This is possible through a tie-up with Kaizen Gaming, an iGaming company that has licenses and operates in both jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Expanding in Greece and Romania</p>
<p>As a result, Real Dealer Studios will provide its innovative-driven games to both Stoiximan and Betano. The company uses what it describes as cinematic random number generator (RNG) titles.</p>
<p>This technique involves filming dealers and the gameplay and then reproducing it back to customers. While players do not interact with dealers in real-time, they still have an immersive setting to explore and enjoy.</p>
<p>Real Dealer’s unique approach to developing games has been described as “pioneering,” and it often includes professional actors, film directors, and entire post-production crews to ensure that the quality of the experience has Hollywood written all over it.</p>
<p>Real Dealer is proud of the product it deploys, touting it as an unprecedented and unmatched option for gamers. The experience still focuses on dedicated one-on-one gameplay which makes everyone feel like a VIP customer, the company argues.</p>
<p>Company CPO Shane Cotter welcomed the opportunity to explore the markets in both Romania and Greece. He argued that the cinematic RNG games provided by Real Dealer have already proven their worth as blockbusters. He added:</p>
<p>Our games allow operators such as Kaizen Gaming to deliver a stand-out player experience and provide content that keeps players engaged and entertained at all times. Real Dealer Studios CPO Shane Cotter</p>
<p>Products That Give Partners Competitive Edge</p>
<p>Real Dealer’s latest moves allow the company to expand into other regulated markets in Europe, and hopefully beyond, Cotter noted. Meanwhile, Kaizen Gaming Live Casino manager Christos Mavridis was equally pleased with the opportunity:</p>
<p>Real Dealer is the real deal. Its cinematic RNG casino games are like nothing we have seen in the market before and deliver unprecedented levels of fun and excitement. Kaizen Gaming Live Casino manager Christos Mavridis</p>
<p>Mavridis is confident that this partnership will enable Kaizen and its brands to truly elevate their propositions and stand out in their respective markets. Real Dealer Studios has signed a number of important deals over the past months.</p>
<p>The company teamed up with Vinnie Jones to bring a familiar face on the screen. The company itself launched ambitious projects such as Scarab Auto Roulette and Turbo Fortune.</p>
