<p>Federal agents apprehended two California brothers last week at Las Vegas’ Red Rock Resort’s parking garage. They allegedly attempted to sell 100 pounds of meth for $300,000, KLAS TV, a local station, reported.</p>

<p>The brothers allegedly transported the suspected drugs from Los Angeles to Las Vegas. Police apprehended the men in the casino’s parking area on Wednesday, Oct. 14, authorities revealed on Monday.</p>
<p>Huy Ngoc “Tony” Tran, 37, and Sinh Van “Paul” Tran, 34, both of Riverside, Calif., appeared in federal court on Friday. They are each charged with possession with intent to distribute a controlled substance.</p>
<p>During the court appearance, federal Magistrate Daniel J. Albregts continued the case until Oct. 30. On that date, the brothers will have a preliminary hearing.</p>
<p>If convicted, the duo could each face a maximum of life in prison and pay up to a $10M fine, Nevada US Attorney Nicholas A. Trutanich said in a statement released on Monday.</p>
<p>The large quantity of meth has a significant street value. A single pound of meth can be sold for 3,200 individual doses, KLAS said, citing federal law enforcement sources.</p>
<p>Machine Guns, Firearms Seized</p>
<p>The two also had in their vehicle an AR-15 style rifle, a Norinco SKS rifle with a sling and bayonet, a scoped Ruger Mini-14, and a double-barrel 12-gauge shotgun, federal officials said.</p>
<p>Among the local and federal agencies investing in the case are the FBI, North Las Vegas Police Department, the Nevada Highway Patrol, and the Nevada Gaming Control Board.</p>
<p>The arrests come as multiple US gaming property garages were the scenes of shootings and other crimes in recent months. Last month in Las Vegas, a robber was targeting the elderly in casino parking lots and garages, police said.</p>
<p>Last week’s meth arrests also come as Las Vegas is facing an uptick in violent crime. Many recent incidents involved fights and shootings.</p>
<p>Recently, shootings took place outside of the Aria, Paris Las Vegas, and in front of the Miracle Mile Shops. A gun was discharged on the casino floor at the MGM Grand, and a man was stabbed in The Venetian.</p>
<p>In response, the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department increased patrols along The Strip by about 20 percent during the night between Thursday and Saturdays, Sheriff Joe Lombardo told the Las Vegas Review-Journal.</p>
<p>The Nevada Highway Patrol has also been called in to assist Metro police to curb crime along The Strip. Police are blaming much of the recent jump in crime on out-of-town visitors and gang members.</p>
<p>Massive Meth Seizure in Southern Cal</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the federal Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) made the largest meth arrests in US history in a series of court-ordered raids in California. The alleged drug trafficking is suspected to have ties to the Sinaloa Cartel, the DEA said.</p>
<p>Federal agents seized 2,224 pounds of meth from stash houses in Southern California. They also seized 893 pounds of suspected cocaine. Also, 13 pounds of suspected heroin was seized.</p>
