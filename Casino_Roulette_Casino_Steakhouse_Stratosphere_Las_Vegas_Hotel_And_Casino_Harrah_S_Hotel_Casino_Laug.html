<p>Genius Sports has the industry nous to provide actionable data and guide the policies of sports clubs, betting agencies, and official sports bodies. Part of the company’s success in this is owed to its ability to pluck prominent figures within the industries it targets and make sure they work for the company instead. In the latest such move, Genius Sports has appointed former UK Minister for Sport Sir Hugh Robertson as part of the company’s Business Advisory Council.</p>
<p>The Business Advisory Council is a fairly new construct in the company and it’s primarily focused on offering long-term strategy, advice, and direction for businesses and the company itself. The appointment of Robertson was immediately welcomed by Genius Sports CEO Mark Locke who said that this hire was highly appreciated because of the trove of experience the new appointee brought along with him.</p>
<p>His commercial and stakeholder experience, Locke continued, will play a vital part in helping shape the future of Genius Sports and the businesses it collaborates with as well. He added:</p>
<p>"Sir Hugh’s unique expertise and experience will be invaluable to positioning Genius as the global leader in sports data and technology."</p>
<p>Robertson’s gambling-related experience is already quite prominent as well, as he’s part of the Camelot Group chairman and chairman of the British Olympic Association. Robertson expressed his happiness to be a part of the team and said that he was delighted with the opportunity to work with Genius Sports and the people involved in the company.</p>
<p>He congratulated Genius Sports for remaining at the forefront of sports data and technology and helping shape multiple channels of the sports experience. Robertson argued that sports data is important for the regulated betting sector, but also the media and broadcasting segments, which have been coming together of late.</p>
<p>He expressed his hopes that his ample experience will enable Genius Sports to continue pursuing its goals and achieve them. Genius Sports is in a particularly good position as it is. The company reaffirmed its financial outlook for 2022, confident that it can achieve the objectives it has set for itself.</p>
