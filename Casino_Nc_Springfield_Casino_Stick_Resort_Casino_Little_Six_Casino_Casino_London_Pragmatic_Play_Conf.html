<p>Pragmatic Play will extend the “Drops &amp; Wins” promotion with a new winter edition, featuring more awards for slot and live casino players. The current season ends on October 17, but Pragmatic Play has decided not to end the popular contest. The new edition will start on November 17, and will run through February 9. The prize pool of $1.12 million is split 50/50, with slots and the same amount for live casino games.</p>
<p>According to the official announcement, Pragmatic Play has no intention of discontinuing the popular contest any time soon, as it “represents their relentless commitment to take player entertainment to the next level.”</p>
<p>Players can expect the new winter edition of Drops and Wins improvements, which will see a whole new level of entertainment. The promotion will include the Prize Drops feature in all Live Casino titles. The Prize Drop feature is a prize that rewards players randomly while they bet real money in all of the games. Prize Drops have been the hallmark of the promotion, and Pragmatic Play is looking to further increase their appeal to players by making them even more exciting and more available than ever. According to Pragmatic Play, this will further add value to their Live Casino portfolio.</p>
<p>The Prizes Keep Poppin’</p>
<p>Prize Drops have proven to be a very appealing promotional tool to players and a huge success for Pragmatic Play. The games that this tool covers include popular slot games such as The Dog House Megaways and Big Bass Bonanza, as well as new releases such as Gates of Olympus and “Starlight Princess. According to Pragmatic Play, the feature will be expanding to the Live Casino sector, adding a new level of engagement for fans.</p>
<p>Other popular Live Casino games such as Mega Roulette and Blackjack Azure will also contain this extra level of entertainment. The chief business development officer at Pragmatic Play, Yossi Barzely, also commented on the occasion, asserting, “The idea behind Drops and Wins was simple but profound – we tried to give players more of the feeling they seek when playing our games, the winning feeling.”</p>
<p>Currently, Pragmatic Play has been busy releasing new games every month and establishing itself in different parts of the world. In September, the company signed a partnership deal with Planetwin365 in Italy. In July, the company inked a content deal with Luckia, placing all its games on their global platform, starting with Spain.</p>
