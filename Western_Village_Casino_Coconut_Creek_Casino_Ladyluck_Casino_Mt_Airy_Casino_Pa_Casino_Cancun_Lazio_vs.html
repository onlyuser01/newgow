    <h1>Western Village Casino Coconut Creek Casino Ladyluck Casino Mt Airy Casino Pa Casino Cancun Lazio vs</h1>

<p>Both Lazio and Napoli played in the Europa League earlier this week and both got knocked out of the competition. Lazio failed against FC Porto after playing 2-2 in Roma, while Napoli got hammered 4-2 by Barcelona in Naples. The best way to heal the wound is to do well on the weekend.</p>
<p>So, which team will have more reasons to celebrate on Sunday? Oddsmakers think it’s Napoli, despite the fact that this team has some serious problems with injuries ahead of the trip to the Italian capital.</p>

<p>Lazio Still Dreaming of the Top 4</p>
<p>The four teams that finish in the top 4 in the Italian Serie A get to play in the Champions League the following season. Apart from prestige, this also comes with financial gain, which is why every club is willing to do everything in its power to get there.</p>
<p>One of the teams that still have a decent chance to get there is Lazio. With 43 points, the Sky Blues are sitting in the #6 position. They got one point fewer than Atalanta (#5) and four fewer against Juventus (#4).</p>
<p>To challenge the top 4, Lazio will have to start winning again. This team is without a win in the previous three games, one of which was a Serie A game with Udinese. On the bright side for the Romans, their home form has been pretty impressive. Since the start of the year, they are without a single loss at Olimpico.</p>
<p>Their most recent home game saw them destroy Bologna 3-0 with two goals by Matia Zaccagni and one goal by Cito Immobile, who caught COVID after that match. Lazio’s arguably best striker returned this week in the game with Porto, in which we saw him score once as well as make one assist. Unfortunately for Lazio, that wasn’t enough as the game finished 2-2.</p>
<p>Napoli’s Injury Worries Pilling On</p>
<p>Napoli is flying high in Serie A. with 54 points, they’re sitting in the #3 position, and their Champions League future seems relatively safe. The trouble is that their recent form hasn’t been too impressive. Napoli is without a win in the previous four games in all competitions, with two straight draws in the Italian top-flight.</p>
<p>One of the reasons behind this is the fact that this team’s been having some serious injury problems. There are at least five first-team players who will miss Sunday’s game, while three remain doubtful. One of those is Lorenzo Insigne, who’s been one of Napoli’s key men for the past ten years.</p>
<p>All of this hasn’t made online sportsbooks think of Napoli as an underdog. In fact, it’s just the opposite – oddsmakers think Napoli is the favorite in this match.</p>
<p>Are they wrong to think so? It definitely seems like that. Lazio is a good team that’s playing at home, so grabbing a win shouldn’t be too much of a challenge for them.</p>
<p>Picks: Lazio to Win; Over 2.5 Goals</p>
