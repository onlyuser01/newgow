<p>The Slot Game Brings Free Spins and Jackpots</p>
<p>The fresh slot game from Dragon Gaming offers quality sound effects backed by engaging animations and colorful changing backgrounds. The medium-volatility slot offers scatter symbols that can award the players free spins. Whenever a player lands three or more scatters, they are awarded six free spins. If more than three scatters land on the reels, players get the same number of free spins but can benefit from a higher base reward, reveals the leading iGaming developer.</p>
<p>While engaging in the special free spins round, players see the three middle reels form one huge “jumbo symbol.” In case a player lands a scatter symbol at the jumbo symbol position, they secure three more free spins, boosting the chance for bigger payouts.</p>
<p>In addition to free spins, Kung Food Panda delivers jackpot functionality. The slot’s special symbol is the popular fortune cookie. Online players that land six fortune cookie symbols anywhere on the reel can access a special bonus round. This round grants the players three re-spins. At each re-spin, a new symbol appears on the reel and stays locked until a re-spin counter resets to three. For each of the symbols, players can secure a multiplier between 1x and 20x, granting a chance for a Mini, Minor or Major jackpot. Lucky players that fill all 15 symbol positions with fortune cookies can benefit from a mouthwatering Grand Jackpot.</p>
