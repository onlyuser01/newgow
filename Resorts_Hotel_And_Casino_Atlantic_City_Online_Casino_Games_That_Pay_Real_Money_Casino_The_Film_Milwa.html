    <h1>Resorts Hotel And Casino Atlantic City Online Casino Games That Pay Real Money Casino The Film Milwa</h1>

<p>Slough Town Football Club, the semi-professional community football club that represents the town of Slough in Berkshire, has announced an important sponsorship agreement with EPIC Risk Management, the world’s leading independent gambling harm minimization consultancy.</p>
<p>In partnering with the consultancy that aims to help businesses and organizations “avoid the destructive effects of gambling-related harm”, the Rebels have selected them as the new primary sponsors of their away kits that will feature their company logo on the front.</p>
<p>A “Special Personal Connection” Between EPIC and Slough Town FC</p>
<p>EPIC Risk Management’s chief executive officer, Paul Buck, spoke about the special personal bond between the consultancy with a mission “to take the problem out of gambling and to save lives” and the soccer club.</p>
<p>Based on the connection that has the Club’s first team manager, Scott Davies, at the center, EPIC has expressed eagerness to show support for the direction that he is planning to adopt for the club as the new away kit sponsor.</p>
<p>The CEO praised their smooth working relationship with Ashley Smith and the A23 Football Group since they turned into the majority owners of the club while explaining that their goal “to give something back to the local community” was an idea that fully resonated with them.</p>
<p>By imprinting their name and logo on the Club’s away shirts, EPIC expects to raise questions regarding who they are and what they do “in order to raise wider awareness of gambling-related harm and the effects it can have on people from all walks of life.”</p>
<p>SBC sponsorship director, George Harborne, also commented on the new deal, expressing their pleasure to witness grassroots sports join major rights holders and operators in raising awareness and fighting against gambling harm through the consultancy’s premium programs and initiatives.</p>
<p>The new sponsorship is expected to further strengthen the connection between the club staff and its leaders, and the gambling harm prevention consultancy.</p>
<p>In March, EPIC announced an expansion of its partnership with NFLPA PAF, expressing its desire to continue the fight against gambling-related harm. In 2021/2022, the consultancy’s educational programs reached close to 35,000 students across UK schools and colleges.</p>
<p>EPIC Risk Management Has Launched The Gambling Harm Podcast</p>
<p>Earlier this week, EPIC announced the launch of The Gambling Harm Podcast created with the purpose of further sharing their knowledge and experience connected to gambling-related harm to a much wider audience.</p>
<p>Reuniting its key figures and associates and bringing their lived problem gambling experiences into the spotlight, EPIC’s new series of informative broadcasts produced by JMP UK will be hosted by journalist Steve Cotton.</p>
<p>The series’ first episode was aired on August 1, and new episodes will follow on a weekly basis throughout the month, as part of a five-part series. The podcasts will be available in both video and audio formats across several mainstream platforms, including YouTube, Spotify, Soundcloud, and Apple Podcasts.</p>
<p>At the end of June, EPIC Risk Management and Entain Foundation US announced a new agreement with the Major League Soccer Players Association for a series of education and awareness programs related to gambling-related harm.</p>
