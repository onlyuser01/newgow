<p>Hello Petronela,</p>
<p>First of all, thank you for your help and opening this complaint.</p>
<p>Regarding KYC, I am aware that there are strict requirements that must be adhered to.</p>
<p>I have properly submitted the required documents several times.</p>
<p>This is a copy of the first email from Parimatch:</p>
<p>Dear Henri,</p>
<p>We sincerely appreciate you reaching out to Parimatch.</p>

<p>-Payment Card statement or Wallet Statement (bank logo, your name and address) for your transactions within the period of the last 30 days.</p>

<p>As I said, I have submitted all documents requested by Parimatch. Parimatch kept checking for a problem with my sent statement. Initially it was a screenshot that was not accepted. I then downloaded the statement in the original PDF format from my crypto exchange account (Binance), the last two withdrawals, and sent it to Parimatch. After several email exchanges, Parimatch always wrote that screenshots were not accepted. It is clear to see that this bank statement is not a screenshot. Since I couldn't find a solution after writing for a long time, I had to inform Parimatch that I would refer the matter to the authorities: crimes@gaminglicences.com / info@gaminglicences.com / helpdesk@curacaolicensing.com.</p>
<p>I am currently waiting for a response from the approval authority. Parimatch then completed the verification process. My entire balance (INR 60711) was confiscated. I can currently still access my Parimatch account. When I forwarded it to the licensing authority, I received another response from Parimatch. I will also copy this below and also my answer on Parimatch.</p>
<p>Dear Henri,</p>
