<p>FanDuel wrote history as it became the first company in North America to allow players to wager on sports and horse racing by using a single account and wallet</p>
<p>FanDuel will become the first company in the United States that allows customers to bet on sports and horse racing through a single account. While experts have long foreseen the coming together of the two sectors, FanDuel will pioneer a shared wallet for the two verticals.</p>
<p>FanDuel Joins Racing and Betting in One</p>
<p>Both analysts and fans had expected the launch of single accounts for both sports betting and horse racing ever since the PASPA was repealed in 2018. It is not hard to see why people were so convinced about that, considering the inherent similarities between traditional sports and horse races.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the inclusion of racing alongside other, more popular sports would likely revitalize the sector, considering the quickly-growing popularity of sports betting apps. Many are convinced that this is exactly the push horse racing needs right now.</p>
<p>Luckily, people who love both sports and horse racing need to wait no more as FanDuel pioneered a merged wallet for the two verticals. As announced by the company, it is now the first North American sportsbook to allow customers to access both parimutuel wagering on horse racing and traditional sports with a single account.</p>
<p>The concept was already soft-launched last week and is proving to be a resounding success. The move, meanwhile, is a part of FanDuel’s continued investment in improved customer experiences. It is also an effort on FanDuel’s side to introduce the newer generations to the beauty of horse racing.</p>
<p>The Operator Wants to Promote Horse Racing</p>
<p>FanDuel shared that users will now be able to not only bet on sports and racing but also stream racing coverage from the company’s FanDuel TV app. The operator also announced that from 2023 on, FanDuel Sportsbook users will be able to wager on the famous Kentucky Derby.</p>
<p>The merged wallet/single account feature can now be used by sports punters in the following states: New York, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, West Virginia, Wyoming, Michigan, Colorado and Virginia. The operator plans to quickly roll it out in other states as well.</p>
<p>FanDuel Group’s chief executive officer, Amy Howe, spoke about the innovative feature. She noted that horse racing is a part of what FanDuel is, which is why the company wants to expose sports fans to more racing content.</p>
<p>Horse racing is a big part of our DNA. This is a significant opportunity to expose a broader, engaged audience to the sport in a familiar environment. Amy Howe, CEO, FanDuel</p>
<p>Just as Howe said, FanDuel’s ownership company, Flutter Entertainment, is a specialist in horse racing. The company has offered horse racing content and wagering in the UK and Australia for years and therefore truly has the vertical in its DNA.</p>
