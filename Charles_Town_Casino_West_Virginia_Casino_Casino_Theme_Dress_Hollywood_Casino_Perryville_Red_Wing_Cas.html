<p>BetMGM was the first to launch retail betting in Puerto Rico and will now become the first to launch online betting as well</p>
<p>BetMGM, a leading iGaming and sports betting operator, has launched its mobile sportsbook in Puerto Rico, thanks to a partnership with Casino del Mar at La Concha Resort. This will notably mark the second market outside of the US mainland where the app is available.</p>
<p>The BetMGM app is famous for the user-friendly experience it offers. As a result, Puerto Rico players will get the ability to customize pre-game, live in-play, futures and parlay wagers, greatly improving their experience.</p>
<p>To register for the new app, gamblers need to validate their identification in person at the Casino Del Mar BetMGM Sportsbook in San Juan. Customers can also benefit from the MGM Rewards loyalty program that allows players to redeem luxurious experiences at some of MGM Resorts’ finest properties.</p>
<p>BetMGM pioneered on-site sports betting in Puerto Rico when the vertical was first legalized in February 2022. By the end of the year, Casino del Mar opened a $3.5 million BetMGM sportsbook and lounge for betting aficionados.</p>
<p>BetMGM Is a Local Powerhouse</p>
<p>Casino del Mar’s general manager, Sigfrido de Jesus, is excited that Puerto Rico is once again sitting at the “forefront of the sports betting industry.” He said that the vertical allows players to enjoy themselves while benefiting the state treasury.</p>
<p>Because of that de Jesus is excited to join forces with BetMGM and launch online betting in the country. He praised the company for teaching Casino del Mar so much about the contemporary betting sector:</p>
<p>We are pioneers in the sports wagering industry, and we are elevating sports to the next level by developing trustworthy and user-friendly technology tools. Creating this technological alliance with a company of BetMGM’s caliber has allowed both Casino del Mar and the government to learn about innovation in the betting industry. Sigfrido de Jesus, GM, Casino del Mar</p>
<p>Adam Greenblatt, BetMGM’s chief executive officer, also commented on the matter, saying that he is happy to grow BetMGM internationally. He added that his team is committed to offering online betting in a manner that shields Puerto Rican customers from harm.</p>
<p>BetMGM is ecstatic to become the first operator to deliver mobile sports betting to Puerto Rico. This great collaboration between local officials and Casino del Mar provides a safe, responsible and entertaining product accessible from anywhere on the island. Adam Greenblatt, CEO, BetMGM</p>
<p>BetMGM also offers gaming in Ontario where it recently secured extra content from Hacksaw Gaming.</p>
