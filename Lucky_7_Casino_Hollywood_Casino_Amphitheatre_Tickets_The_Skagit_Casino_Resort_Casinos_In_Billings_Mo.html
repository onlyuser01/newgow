    <h1>Lucky 7 Casino Hollywood Casino Amphitheatre Tickets The Skagit Casino Resort Casinos In Billings Mo</h1>

<p>Specialist in horse racing gaming technology Exacta Systems announced today it signed an agreement with the manufacturer of gaming equipment for land-based and digital casinos Everi Holdings to integrate Everi’s gaming content and cabinets onto its historical horse racing (HHR) system.</p>
<p>‘High-Performing’ Content and Cabinets</p>
<p>The deal between the leader in the historical horse racing Exacta Systems and the supplier of gaming equipment, content, products, financial technology, and player loyalty solutions Everi Holdings will see Everi’s award-winning content feature through the HHR system.</p>
<p>“Exacta is proud to partner with Everi for the historical horse racing market. Adding Everi’s high-performing game content and gaming cabinets to our Exacta CONNECT system creates a tremendous opportunity to increase player engagement at all of our customers’ locations.” Ross O’Hanley, Chief Revenue Officer, Exacta Systems</p>
<p>Founded in 2012 to answer the growing market need for fresh thinking and innovative product development, Exacta Systems delivers engaging and entertaining games across various market segments.</p>
<p>Exacta’s Exacta Connect solution supports the deployment of many different regulatory-approved systems, while its HHR utilizes third-party content integrations to ensure an unmatched experience for the fans of historical horse racing.</p>
<p>“Collaborating with Exacta Systems is a significant opportunity to introduce our extensive library of proven mechanical reel and video gaming content into the growing HHR market. We are confident that our distinctive gaming cabinets and player-popular game content will resonate well with HHR patrons.” Dean Ehrlich, EVP and Games Business Leader, Everi Holdings</p>
<p>Everi Holdings was among the first to address the need for cashless gaming solutions for land-based casinos and positioned itself as a major player in the space. In December 2020, Everi teamed with the Seminole Tribe of Florida to bring its WildCard Wallet digital solution to the gaming floors of casinos operated by the tribe.</p>
<p>Expanding Gaming Development Capabilities</p>
<p>Earlier in the month, Everi announced the acquisition of certain strategic assets, including game development technology and intellectual property of Australia-based developer of gaming content and products Atlas Gaming Pty Ltd and Atlas Gaming Technologies Pty Ltd, collectively known as Atlas.</p>
<p>Atlas’ assets are expected to complement Everi’s existing game development studios and portfolio of games and provide opportunities for further expansion into new gaming markets. The transaction is expected to close within the next two months.</p>
