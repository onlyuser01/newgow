    <h1>Casino Quotes Casino Danville Il Sunscape Cura ao Resort Spa Casino Willemstad Cura ao Nj Party Casi</h1>

<p>Known for its unparalleled appreciation and ongoing support for sports, Betsson, the premium betting company with over 20 casino, sportsbook, and other games brands has “proudly” announced its latest proof of love for padel tennis.</p>
<p>The company has become the official title sponsor of the highly-anticipated A1 Padel (formerly ATP) Swedish Master tournament that will be held between July 10 and July 16 in Halmstad. The event will reunite some of the most reputable names in the sport’s history.</p>
<p>Finally, Sweden’s Time to Host the A1 Padel</p>
<p>The Swedish-founded gaming company joined the A1 Padel tournament right on time, as the event is getting ready to unfold in the Scandinavian country for the first time in history.</p>
<p>Last year, the tournament was supposed to be held in Båstad. However, a last-minute change of location to Tenerife prevented the Swedes from giving a warm welcome to some of the world’s most skilled padel players.</p>
<p>The week-long event will now be held at Halmstad’s main plaza and it will host highly-ranked players including names. The list will include the hot Argentinian duo made of Franco Dal Bianco, A1 Padel’s first-ranked player, and Maximiliano Arce, the equally skilled player who helped Dal Bianco scoop up their fifth title of the season at the Estepark Open final in June when they defeated Fede Mouriño and Ignacio Piotto.</p>
<p>Together, the two made it to history books by becoming the first qualifiers to make it into the finals and win a title. The July Halmstad tournament will also host Leo Tolito Aguirre, who is considered one of the most talented padel players on the planet, along with other illustrious names that fans of the sport will be thrilled to meet.</p>
<p>With the help of the new Betsson sponsorship, the Swedish Master will display a prize pool set at SEK 1 million ($93.871). The tournament is currently spread across 18 separate global locations including Buenos Aires, New York, Cape Town, and Miami, helping it surpass the World Padel Tour.</p>
<p>A1 Padel Sweden, “Delighted to Join Forces with Betsson”</p>
<p>A1 Padel Sweden’s chief executive officer, Christer Garell, expressed their thrill to join hands with the multi-national company that currently employs more than 2,200 people.</p>
<p>Garell called the tournament “the summer’s biggest padel event” while referring to Betsson as one of the operators with a proven commitment to the padel sport throughout the years especially through their involvement in South America, the cradle of a large number of top players who will be attending this year’s event.</p>
<p>The CEO also expressed his belief that Betsson will significantly improve the experience of attendees and live viewers who will be watching the competition live on ESPN.</p>
<p>Using the voice of ambassador Cayetano Rocafort who won two APT competitions in 2021, Betsson further praised the fast growth of the thriving Swedish Master with special emphasis on its evolution in the past five years.</p>
<p>Last November, ex-professional soccer player Nicole Regnier was appointed as Betsson’s ambassador for Colombia. Betsson Sweden’s managing director, Mattias Wennerkvist, said they were “immensely proud” and considered it to be an honor to be able to show their support for the sport in Halmstad and reaffirm their passion for the padel tennis.</p>
<p>The MD further added that their dedication will go “beyond mere sponsorship”, with the company getting ready to keep a close eye on the heated action while doing exclusive interviews with the players and offering competitive odds to interested bettors.</p>
<p>In 2022, the company launched the Betsson Padel Tour, the country’s first-ever national padel tennis amateur tournament.</p>
