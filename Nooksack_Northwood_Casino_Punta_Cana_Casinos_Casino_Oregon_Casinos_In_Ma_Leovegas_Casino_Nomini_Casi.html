    <h1>Nooksack Northwood Casino Punta Cana Casinos Casino Oregon Casinos In Ma Leovegas Casino Nomini Casi</h1>

<p>Hello. I registered at the nomini casino recently, I made some deposits and everything was normal. However, I got some winnings (no bonus), and I asked for the withdrawal and I asked through the live chat where I could send the documents to withdraw 1000 euros .responded that in principle there would be no need for documents.</p>
<p>However, the next day they sent an email confirming that the withdrawal was being processed and that I would receive my withdrawal shortly.</p>
<p>Then, they sent an email saying that I needed to send personal documents for verification, and after some difficulties and a lot of bureaucracy to deliver my documents, I received another email saying that it was delivered to the financial department and that I would then have to hope it will all be resolved soon.</p>
<p>However, I decide to go to the casino website again and to my surprise that the account is closed, not being able to access it.</p>
<p>After this situation, and asking for information by email, they never answered me again, after several attempts and messages, they just didn't answer me and they don't answer me. There is also a situation, which probably could have caused a problem, because when I registered at the casino, I did it in Ireland, which is currently where I live, through an Internet connection at my house. After depositing, playing and winning some money, I asked to withdraw, always using the same internet connection. The next day, through my mobile internet, after visiting some sites that are blocked on my phone number (phone number ), had the vpn on and forgot to turn it off, and visited the nomini casino in the meantime. That's why they also sent me emails telling me to avoid using the vpn because it would be against casino rules. But it's worth remembering that from registering at the casino to the withdrawal request, everything was done on the same internet connection I have at my home in Ireland. I would like the casino guru to help me as they have done before to try to unblock this situation, because it was through the rating that you gave on your site, which is as perfect, and I honestly feel. there's nothing perfect.</p>
<p>I am waiting for your opinion.</p>
