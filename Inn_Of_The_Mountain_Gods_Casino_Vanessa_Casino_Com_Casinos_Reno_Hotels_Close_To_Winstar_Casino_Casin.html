<p>Arena of Valor to Host Road to AIC 2019 in SEA</p>
<p>Tim Sweeney one famously said, discussing PUBG Corp. accusations that Epic Games had stolen the concept of the game and built the famous battle royale game Fortnite around it, that games only stand to learn from one another and that, ultimately, each project would be judged on its own merits.</p>
<p>Mobile MOBA Arena of Valor has long been struggling to popularize the Chinese Honor of Kings in the West. With the announcement of ESL MSP Championship hosted by the namesake esports league, Arena of Valor is making yet another step to cement its clout and boost awareness, mostly in Southeast Asia (SEA) where the tournament will focus. Meanwhile, AoV managed to post a solid $100 million in terms of revenue for 2018.</p>

<p>Commenting on these developments, ESL SVP for Asia-Pacific Japan, Nick Vanzetti, said that ESL was excited to partner up with various organizations, including Garena, and expand the league‚Äôs reach into the Southeast Asia region.</p>
<p>Similarly, Garena‚Äôs Producer for Indonesia, Marshal Bagus Nugroho shared his positive experience with witnessing esports grow and expand in SEA:</p>
<p>‚ÄúGarena AOV is proud to be working again with ESL on developing esports scene in Southeast Asia. Hopefully, from the ESL MSP Championship, we‚Äôll see the birth of talented players who will win on the international stage.‚Äù</p>
<p>Arena of Valor has enjoyed better reception in Southeast Asia where good gaming phones come at a fraction of the cost that they do in the West. Plus, mobile gaming is more popular as a rule of thumb, which gives titles such as Mobile Legends and Arena of Valor a significant advantage.</p>
<p>So far as Honor of Kings goes, the game remains the most played mobile title in China. Interestingly, female gamers outnumber male counterparts, which is another confirmation that female players take more fondly to mobile games in general.</p>
