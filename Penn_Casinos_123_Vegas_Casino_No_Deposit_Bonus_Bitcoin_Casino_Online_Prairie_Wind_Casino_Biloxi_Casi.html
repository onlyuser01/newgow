<p>Sporting Risk reinforced its team by adding the experienced Andy Phillips as its new chief commercial officer</p>
<p>Sporting Risk, an expert in sports betting, forecasting and analytics, has appointed the experienced Andy Phillips as its new chief commercial officer, the company announced. The new hire will reinforce the company’s growth, helping it expand its business.</p>
<p>Phillips Has Joined the Company as CCO</p>
<p>Phillips, who said that he is glad to join Sporting Risk, will be responsible for channeling more clients toward Sporting Risk’s products and helping the company augment its operations.</p>
<p>The appointee boasts over a decade and a half of experience and has worked for many companies within the media, betting tech and sports data sectors. Before joining Sporting Risk as a CCO, Phillips served as an independent consultant for more than five years. Between 2019 and 2021, the expert served as Nasdaq’s head of business development of sports and gaming. Earlier, Phillips worked in the position of commercial director at APSdata.</p>
<p>One of the most important entries in Phillips’ CV, however, is the nine years he spent at Genius Sports. Between 2008 and 2017, Phillips occupied various positions at the company, honing the skills which he will now use to grow Sporting Risk.</p>
<p>Phillips Wants to Attract More Clients</p>
<p>Phillips shared his thoughts on joining Sporting Risk, praising the company for its unique data and innovative products. He noted that the company’s talented team has developed many relevant cutting-edge solutions that provide robust predictive models for sports.</p>
<p>The new CCO noted that these impressive tools allow the company to help operators get more value from their sports data. As data is becoming more and more complex, such solutions are increasingly relevant and popular, he added.</p>
<p>Phillips pointed out that Sporting Risk is already working with some of the big names in sports betting and concluded that he is really excited about working with the company and inking deals with more sportsbooks in 2023.</p>
<p>Sporting Risk’s chief executive officer, Henry Newman, welcomed the new hire to the company. He lauded Phillips as a sports data and betting technology expert whose experience will be crucial to the company’s sales strategy in 2023.</p>
<p>Newman is certain that Sporting Risk’s ability to present pricing and insights from one source is a unique one and will be a “game-changer” for any operator wishing to engage its fans with unique sports betting experiences.</p>
<p>In other news, a few months ago, Sporting Risk unveiled PropFutures, an innovative product for player prop and interval-based markets.</p>
