<p>Considering Guty’s situation and the money he carried with him, authorities believe that the man was trying to escape from the police</p>
<p>A homicide suspect has been apprehended at the Mardi Gras Hotel &amp; Casino in Las Vegas. The man in question is Arthur Guty Jr, 55, who is suspected of having killed his own wife, Nicole Zambrano, in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>The 26-year-old Venezuelan woman worked as a housekeeper at Nemacolin Woodlands Resort but didn’t turn up to work for three days last week. Her colleagues were unable to contact her and became concerned. Because of that, they called the police, which, in turn, contacted Guty.</p>
<p>Guty, authorities say, provided inaccurate and conflicting information. However, the police eventually found the young woman’s body at the couple’s residence in Uniontown, Pennsylvania, on Monday. This prompted an immediate investigation and a search for Guty.</p>
<p>Using Guty’s mobile device pings, the police managed to track the man to Las Vegas. The local authorities were contacted and were able to apprehend the man after looking for him for 12 hours. He was eventually discovered eating breakfast at the casino. At the time of his arrest, the man had $100,000 in cash in his possession.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania authorities want Guty to be extradited from Nevada so that he can be questioned in the state where the homicide happened. A warrant from the former state’s authorities charges Guty with criminal homicide and aggravated assault. The counts are yet to be officialized.</p>
<p>Guty Tried to Escape, Authorities Believe</p>
<p>Considering Guty’s situation and the money he carried with him, authorities believe that the man was trying to escape from the police. This theory is further supported by the fact that Guty provided the authorities with faulty information when asked about his wife’s whereabouts.</p>
<p>According to the local authorities, Guty first said that his wife was in Richmond to see a friend. He also said that she was in Florida with Guty to see his father and a dentist, as well as in Richmond to meet with Guty. At one point he also said that his wife was at the Grand Canyon.</p>
<p>Bob Luick, a neighbor of the couple, was interviewed by local news outlets and said that Guty suspected Zambrano was cheating on him. According to Luick, back then Guty warned that he would “kill her” if this turned out to be correct.</p>
<p>A Cycle of Violence</p>
<p>According to reports, Guty himself was the target of a murder plot previously. While this case bears no direct connection to the recent killing of Zambrano, the authorities learned that Guty’s ex-wife, Roxanne Guty, had attempted to hire a hitman and take half of Arthur Guty’s life insurance.</p>
<p>Roxanne Guty eventually pled guilty to lesser charges.</p>
