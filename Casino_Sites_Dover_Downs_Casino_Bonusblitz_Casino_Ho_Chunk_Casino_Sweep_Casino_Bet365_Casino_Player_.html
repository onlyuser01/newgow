<p>Dear Canee,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. I have checked T&amp;Cs, and this is what I found:</p>
<p>"1.3 For payment methods that require a specific account holder, you should only deposit funds into your gambling account from a source where you are the named account holder. In such cases where bet365 identify that the named account holder differs from that which bet365 hold, we reserve the right to treat any deposits into the gambling account as being invalid (and any winnings arising from such deposit as void)."</p>
<p>Please understand that this rule has been breached. Some exceptions might be allowed by casinos when depositing funds with a joint card/bank account, but it seems this was not the case. I’m very sorry but we can’t help you with this query. If there is any additional information that would support this case, please do not hesitate to contact us, otherwise, I will be forced to reject your complaint. Thank you for your understanding.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Kristina</p>
