<p>Genius Sports adds another North American partner that will gain access to its services and it is Golden Nugget Online Gaming (GNOG). The company will be provided with the LiveTrading and LiveData solutions by Genius Sports. These two solutions deliver pricing capabilities and official data feeds of countless sports events each year.</p>
<p>GNOG Will Gain Exclusive Access to the Portfolio of Genius Sports</p>
<p>Thanks to the trading partnership and official data, GNOG will be able to access the portfolio of Genius Sports, which consists of exclusive rights to the English Premier League, Columbian and Argentine soccer, NASCAR, Liga MX, NFL and Euroleague Basketball.</p>
<p>The president of GNOG, Thomas Winter, stated that the modern bettor is always looking for an engaging and reliable experience that is available 24/7, and the partnership that GNOG formed with Genius Sports will deliver on these expectations. It will provide customers with products on their favorite markets such as NASCAR, the NFL and several other global leagues.</p>
<p>With this lucrative deal, GNOG will gain access to exclusive data from NASCAR and the Next Gen Stats of the NFL. The deal comes at a pretty busy period for the operator, as it has recently teamed up with WynnBet, Caesars Entertainment, and Rocket Mortgage Classic.</p>
<p>Genius Sportsâ€™ chief executive, Mark Locke, stated that the company is thrilled to team up with Golden Nugget and help it deliver the best sports betting experience for bettors. Thanks to the fact that official data lies at the heart of this partnership, Golden Nugget will be able to increase its customer engagement while also supporting a sports betting ecosystem that is sustainable.</p>
<p>GNOG to be Purchased By DraftKings</p>
<p>At the beginning of August 2021, DraftKings agreed to purchase GNOG in an all-stock deal that cost around $1.56 billion. Speaking on the deal, Tilman Fertitta, the chairman and CEO of GNOG stated that DraftKings is one of the leading players in the industry, which is why the company is very excited to join the family.</p>
<p>The chairman and CEO of DraftKings also shared a few words on the purchase. According to Jason Robins, the GNOG acquisition will allow DraftKings to reach a much wider customer base, as GNOG is a brand that is synonymous with entertainment and iGaming. With this deal, DraftKings expects to gain significant synergies as well as other strategic benefits.</p>
<p>With the acquisition, DraftKings enters a reorganization, starting with a new holding company that goes by the name New DraftKings, which will be the going-forward company for both parties involved.</p>
<p>Currently, GNOG has agreements that allow it access to a total of 14 states. In the first six months of 2021, it had a $58.4 million revenue. Compared to the same period last year, that is a 38.7% increase.</p>
