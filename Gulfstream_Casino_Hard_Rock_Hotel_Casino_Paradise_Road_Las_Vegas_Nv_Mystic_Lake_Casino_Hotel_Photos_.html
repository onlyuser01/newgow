    <h1>Gulfstream Casino Hard Rock Hotel Casino Paradise Road Las Vegas Nv Mystic Lake Casino Hotel Photos</h1>

<p>Good day,</p>
<p>I opened an account with this site some time ago. Unfortunately, I noticed that this site, despite my request never to open my account again, always opened it again immediately and without any waiting time. I then looked for advice on their site and was told how to write the email to the casino. The email then looked like this:</p>
<p>Good day,</p>
<p>I would like to let you know that I would like to ban myself from your casino as I am addicted to gambling. The self-exclusion shall last for one year and shall be irreversible. Any new deposit that I can now make on your site without getting banned, I will in the future send it to your licensing authority using the Casinoguru site. Then a refund will be requested.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, my account was reopened afterwards as well.</p>
<p>now my question is if it is possible to reclaim my losses since this casino is clearly in breach of player protection.</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>
