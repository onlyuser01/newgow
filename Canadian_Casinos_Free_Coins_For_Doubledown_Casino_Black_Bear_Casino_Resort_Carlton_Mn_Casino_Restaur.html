<p>The betting and gaming company continues to grow its portfolio of partners by teaming up with the famous soccer club based in Bosnia and Herzegovina</p>
<p>The leading gaming, entertainment and sports betting company, Meridianbet Group, confirmed a new sponsorship agreement with the famous soccer club based in Bosnia and Herzegovina, FK Sarajevo. Announced last week, the collaboration reaffirms the company’s commitment to supporting the growth of different sports and expands its portfolio of partners further.</p>
<p>The new strategic deal helps expand Meridianbet’s presence in Southeast Europe. At the same time, the sponsorship is expected to help the famous soccer club, reaffirming the operator’s dedication to uplifting and promoting sports across the globe.</p>
<p>For decades, Meridianbet has been involved in community investment in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Only recently, the company revealed it won a special charity auction for Edin Džeko national team jersey. The unique initiative helped raise funds for the treatment of children affected by spinal muscular atrophy in the region.</p>
<p>Meridianbet was founded more than two decades ago, back in 2001. Since then, it has established itself as a leading gaming and sports betting company across the globe. Currently, Meridianbet has access to and operates in 15 different markets across South America, Africa, as well as Europe. Overall, Meridianbet has more than 1,500 employees. Although the company focuses primarily on sports betting, it also offers a variety of casino-style games, as well as fixed-odds titles within different regulated gambling markets.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the company announced another major deal for the region. At the time, Meridianbet confirmed it signed a sponsorship agreement with KK Crvena Zvezda, the famous Serbian EuroLeague basketball team.</p>
<p>The Company Continues to Grow Its Portfolio of Partners</p>
<p>The new sponsorship marks a milestone achievement for FK Sarajevo. The famous soccer club was founded in 1946 and since then has secured more than a dozen significant achievements. FK Sarajevo was the champion of the former Yugoslavia twice and has also secured one win from the Bosnia and Herzegovina Super Cup. Additionally, the soccer club was recognized as the Bosnia and Herzegovina Cup winner on seven occasions and has won the championship title in the country five times.</p>
<p>Meridianbet’s sponsorship with FK Sarajevo expands the company’s presence in the sports vertical. Across the globe, the company has more than 30 deals with professional and amateur clubs in different sports, including basketball, soccer and others. Besides financial help, Meridianbet helps those clubs by providing much-needed technical and sports equipment.</p>
<p>Outside of the sports vertical, the company supports students with scholarships. Over the recent years, Meridianbet has provided scholarships for many students, allowing them to grow and accumulate valuable knowledge and skills.</p>
