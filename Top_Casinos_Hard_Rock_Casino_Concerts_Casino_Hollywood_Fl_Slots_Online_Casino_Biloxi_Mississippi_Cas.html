<p>Gibraltar-based online gambling company BetVictor has begun recruiting talented workers to operate its new talkSPORT Bet brand. The company shared the news on LinkedIn, urging industry professionals to grab the “fantastic career opportunities” at talkSPORT Bet.</p>
<p>BetVictor Needs Executives for Its New Brand</p>
<p>BetVictor announced that it is currently looking for several executives for its new brand. According to the operator, talkSPORT Bet is in need of a brand head, a display executive, an acquisition executive and an engagement executive, among others.</p>
<p>Emma Heyde, BetVictor’s talent partner, added that the company is also in need of an affiliate manager. She asked anyone who might have interest in joining the talkSPORT Bet family to either contact her on LinkedIn or write her an email. Heyde promised industry enthusiasts that working for talkSPORT Bet is everything they have ever wanted.</p>
<p>Heyde added that talkSPORT BET is also looking for a new representative. She said that the company seeks someone who will be able to represent the new brand across all digital and traditional media platforms ahead of the upcoming FIFA World Cup event.</p>
<p>Heyde concluded that talkSPORT BET will be launching just in time for the highly-anticipated soccer tournament. According to her, the new brand will seek to become synonymous with the World Cup.</p>
<p>TalkSPORT Bet Is an Exciting Joint Venture</p>
<p>TalkSPORT Bet is a joint venture between BetVictor and the renowned radio station talkSPORT. The two companies first joined forces two months ago when they agreed to ink a white-label agreement. The new brand will leverage BetVictor’s betting capabilities and expertise and talkSPORT’s knowledge of the soccer field to create new engaging experiences for sports bettors. As announced by BetVictor, the new brand will combine “the great things about talkSPORT radio” with the pristine sports betting experience” the operator is known for.</p>
<p>Brent Almedia, chief commercial officer of BetVictor, further elaborated that the new brand will allow players to enjoy sports in more ways than one and engage with their favorite pro tournaments. He added that talkSPORT Bet would also retain BetVictor’s famous commitment to safer gambling – something that remains an increasingly high priority within the industry.</p>
<p>The new white-label partnership is yet another expansion of BetVictor’s footprint. The latter company already has similar agreements through which it operates the Parimatch platform in the UK, together with Heart Bingo and BildBet.</p>
<p>In other news, last month, Aga Kamont a former BetVictor Veteran, joined one of its rivals, Entain, as head of operations.</p>
