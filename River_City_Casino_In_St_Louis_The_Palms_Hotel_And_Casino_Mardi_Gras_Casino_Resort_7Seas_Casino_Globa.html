<p>Buffalo Blox Gigablox review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Buffalo Blox Gigablox is themed around American wilderness, wildlife, and Native American culture.</p>
<p>Players will wander through a mountain forest and discover a variety of animals and Native American artwork. A buffalo makes a regal appearance, and if players are lucky, they’ll meet the majestic beast and learn its secrets.</p>
<p>This slot is a good fit for players who are looking for an escape into the wild. Some of the Native American imagery leans into stereotypes, but feels part of the fantasy of the game world.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The relaxing soundtrack combines flute notes with a steady rhythm and the sound of wind blowing. The reels spin and land with a satisfying thwack that brings to mind wooden blocks falling into place.</p>
<p>On either side of the reels, players will see totem poles adorned with carvings of animals. Bears, buffalo, and wolves all appear decorated with colorful paint and feathers.</p>
<p>On the reels, more animals appear, including eagles decorated with accessories, and a smiling bear with vivid green face paint. The most iconic symbol is the buffalo himself who wears a golden headpiece and numerous feathers.</p>
<p>Beyond the reels, players will see an idyllic landscape of mountains and pines. Trees gently sway in the foreground, adding a sense of realism to the scene.</p>
<p>Overall, the animation and soundtrack of Buffalo Blox Gigablox creates a fantasy world of magical animals.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>The number and size of symbols on the reels varies for each spin, and there are a total of 20 win lines. If players land 3 or more matching symbols on a winning line, a win is awarded.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild Coin symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter symbol. If players land 6 or more Wild Coin symbols, a prize is paid out.</p>
<p>Any symbol in the game can land on the reels in a block of up to 4x4 through the Gigablox feature. This feature is possible on every spin.</p>
<p>The Free Spins feature is triggered when players land at least 5 Scatter symbols. Players receive 1-2 free spins for every Scatter symbol.</p>
<p>During the Free Spins feature, more Buffalo symbols will appear naturally.</p>
<p>Players also receive 1-2 free spins for every Diamond symbol that lands.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 95.1%, decisively below our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€ up to a maximum of $/£/€ per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of Buffalo Blox Gigablox is high, which would make it a good match for our preferred slot machine strategies if the RTP was higher. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We do not recommend this low RTP, high volatility Native American and wildlife-themed slot.</p>
<p>Though the animation is attractive, Buffalo Blox Gigablox offers an RTP that is simply too low to merit a recommendation. Some players may want to stop by to check out the aesthetics, but they would do well to seek out a slot with a similar theme and more favorable RTP.</p>
<p>The bonuses offer some fun, but not enough to justify the disappointing RTP.</p>
