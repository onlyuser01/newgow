    <h1>Ocean Casino Casino Downtown Detroit Mardi Gras Casino Resort Betway Casino Casino Montreal Sky Bett</h1>

<p>Flutter, Sky Betting and Gaming’s ownership group, has set an ambitious target of having 75% of its customers use safer gambling tools by 2030</p>
<p>Steve Birch, Sky Betting and Gaming’s chief commercial officer, addressed his company’s partnership with the English Football League (EFL) and the two parties’ commitment to responsible gambling. Now entering its second decade, the partnership between the operator and the league continues as strong as ever.</p>
<p>In a statement provided to Britain’s Betting and Gaming Council (BGC), Birch said that his company’s relationship with the soccer league is one of the longest-running and most successful in professional sports. He praised the two parties’ emphasis on social responsibility and thanked the UK government for providing the partnership as an example of a healthy sponsorship to other companies and leagues amid the ongoing gambling reforms.</p>
<p>Birch teased that Sky Betting and Gaming will be doubling down on its safer gambling messaging and promised that there would be changes around the side of the pitch.</p>
<p>The representative noted that the Sky Bet Championship Play-Off Final between Luton and Coventry incorporated the company’s new perimeter advertising. Previously, the company has also promoted safer gambling initiatives such as “Take Time to Think” through sleeve badges on shirts.</p>
<p>The CCO concluded that nothing beats messaging that is visible at the arena, which is why his team would continue to promote safer gambling through perimeter messaging.</p>
<p>Safer Gambling Is at the Forefront of Sky Betting’s Philosophy</p>
<p>In his statement, Birch promoted the safer gambling tools his company offers to its customers. This includes deposit limits, loss limits and timeouts that help people enjoy gambling without harming themselves. He noted that customers who use deposit limits are much more likely to stick to their budget.</p>
<p>Birch also pointed out that Flutter, Sky Betting and Gaming’s ownership group, has set an ambitious target of having 75% of its customers use such tools by 2030. Currently, around 50% of Sky Bet’s customers are using such solutions, attesting to the company’s commitment to player safety.</p>
<p>Our latest approach is just the latest example of safer gambling being more than just words to us at Sky Bet. It’s a key priority for our business and we are constantly seeking to use our tech and data to put the right protections in place – and to ensure our marketing campaigns are as impactful and effective as possible. Steve Birch, CCO, Sky Betting and Gaming</p>
<p>Birch recognized that most players who wager, do so safely. However, he pointed out that it is crucial to protect the few who may be at risk of harm. The representative concluded that Sky Betting and Gaming and the EFL share the same values when it comes to safer gambling and will prioritize player safety during the new soccer season.</p>
