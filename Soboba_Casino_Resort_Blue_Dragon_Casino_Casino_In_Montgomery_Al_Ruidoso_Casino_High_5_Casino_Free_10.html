<p>Entain’s efforts to ensure a fun and safe gambling experience for its bettors received recognition as GamCare awarded the operator with its Advanced Safer Gambling Standard.</p>
<p>Entain Recognized for Its Efforts</p>
<p>GamCare is an independent UK charity that provides information, advice and support for anyone affected by problem gambling. As such, it is responsible for assessing the safer gambling efforts of gambling operators in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>Entain seems to have fulfilled all of GamCare’s criteria as its online operations received the Advanced Level 3 Standard. Its retail offerings, on the other hand, received the Advanced Level 2 Standard. As of the time of this writing, Entain is the largest gambling company to receive GamCare’s trust.</p>
<p>Before awarding Entain, GamCare thoroughly evaluated Entain’s business. GamCare assessed the operator in 10 areas and against up to 58 criteria. The charity checked Entain’s safer gambling efforts, the tools available to customers, its online betting policies, and the procedures related to addressing problem gambling. GamCare workers also visited the company’s offices and interviewed some of Entain’s employees.</p>
<p>Entain Sets an Example for Other Companies</p>
<p>Dan Whitlam, GamCare’s head of industry standards, said Entain’s diligence when it comes to ensuring a healthier gambling experience is impressive. He praised the operator for its “encouraging” commitment and happily gave Entain the Advanced level of the Safer Gambling Standard for its iGaming and retail operations.</p>
<p>Whitlam emphasized that Entain goes beyond the requirements of its gambling license and is truly dedicated to its customers’ safety.</p>
<p>Robert Hoskin, Entain’s chief governance officer, said that his company feels honored to receive GamCare’s recognition. Hoskin noted that customer safety in gambling is of critical importance. He feels delighted to see Entain’s online vertical receive the charity’s highest accreditation.</p>
<p>Hoskin added that Entrain’s core philosophy is to be sustainable. To that end, the company seeks to be responsible and provide its customers with a safe gambling experience.</p>
<p>We work hard to provide our customers with the safest and most trusted environment to play, whether online or in our shops, and are committed to continuing to lead the industry to the highest standards of social responsibility in the longer term. Robert Hoskin, chief governance officer of Entain</p>
<p>Entain continues seeking to establish itself as an exemplary contemporary gambling company. In March, the operator announced that it continues its hard work in eliminating the pay gap among its workers.</p>
