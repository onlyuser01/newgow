<p>Currently, there are strict betting and promotional advertising laws effective in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. And only recently, the biggest fine against a betting operator over advertising breaches was imposed by the gambling regulator in the southeastern Australian state, Liquor &amp; Gaming NSW.</p>
<p>Last week, the gambling regulator announced it imposed a hefty fine against the sports wagering operator Betr. Liquor &amp; Gaming NSW claimed that the sports betting operator breached the state's regulations with a promotional campaign introduced during its launch last year.</p>
<p>The gambling watchdog said that Betr offered 100-1 and 20-1 odds for major events such as Cox Plate, Melbourne Cup, as well as AFL and NRL markets during its launch back in October 2022. The special promotion was advertised online, as well as via TV, radio and newspapers.</p>
<p>However, Liquor &amp; Gaming NSW said that those advertisements were in breach of the NSW regulations for advertising. In a statement, the regulator reiterated that the current regulatory framework prohibits "the advertisement of any offer of an inducement to participate in a gambling activity, including an inducement to open a betting account or bet more frequently."</p>
<p>Upon uncovering the breaches, the gambling regulator issued a total of 14 penalty infringement notices, amounting to AU$210,000 ($140,600) against Betr. This, the regulatory watchdog said, was the biggest fine ever imposed against a sports betting operator over offering inducements in the state.</p>
<p>According to Liquor &amp; Gaming NSW, Betr voluntarily ceased the advertising campaign once it was contacted. The regulator also explained that in light that the campaign was ceased and Betr received the financial sanction, this matter is considered closed outside of court.</p>
<p>Jane Lin, Liquor &amp; Gaming NSW's Executive Director Regulatory Operations and Enforcement, commented on the topic saying: "This company tried to attract a new customer base and establish a significant market share with promotions that we consider crossed the line, using inducements that had the potential to cause harm to the community."</p>
<p>She explained that such promotions can be offered only to people who have selected to create an account on their own and cannot reach the "general public." Finally, Lin said: "Wagering operators can legally advertise their products in a variety of ways but they can't advertise or promote inducements such as offers of enhanced odds or bonus bets to entice people to open a betting account."</p>
<p>The fine against Betr comes on the heels of another sanction from the gambling regulator in NSW. Recently, an investigation prompted by Liquor &amp; Gaming NSW resulted in an action against the wagering company SportsChamps. The gambling watchdog said that the operator was "convicted of posting illegal gambling advertisements on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and its website," which resulted in a hefty fine. Liquor &amp; Gaming NSW explained that this was the third time this particular operator had been prosecuted.</p>
