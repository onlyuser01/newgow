<p>PokerStars New Jersey Turns $10 into $100,000 for Lucky Spin &amp; Go Winner</p>

<p>PokerStars New Jersey recently made one online poker player a lot wealthier.</p>
<p>Back on January 29, James Piccolo, a 28-year-old resident of Nevada, was back east visiting his family in Bergen County.</p>

<p>The self-described poker professional decided to test his talent on the PokerStars New Jersey platform and sat down at the $10 Sit &amp; Go tables.</p>
<p>After a couple hours of playing the brisk three-handed format, Piccolo was notified that he and two others had landed the prize pool multiplier jackpot. Their combined $30 pot had been multiplied into $120,000, with the winner taking $100,000 and second and third-place finishes receiving $10,000 each.</p>
<p>Roughly 15 minutes later, Piccolo’s bankroll was a cool $100,000 richer. A video filmed by his brother was quickly posted to YouTube showing the monumental win.</p>
<p>“We just won $100,000!” Piccolo told the others in the house. “I just had $590. I now have $100,000. This didn’t just happen.”</p>
<p>But it did happen, and it couldn’t have come at a better time. Piccolo was in New Jersey visiting his family before his father underwent surgery relating to an unspecified cancer.</p>
<p>The surgery reportedly went well, and Piccolo’s sister got engaged in what’s become a rather celebratory week.</p>
<p>Career Win</p>
<p>Piccolo told local reports that he moved to the Silver State in 2015 to pursue a career playing poker professionally. However, it doesn’t appear he’s experienced much success, at least on the live competitive circuit.</p>
<p>According to The Hendon Mob, the online database that tracks poker tournament finishes, Piccolo has just three live cashes during his time living in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>His biggest take came in October when he won $1,843 in a $250 No Limit Hold’em event at The Venetian.</p>
<p>Dating back to 2011, Piccolo’s live tournament career earnings consist of seven cashes for a total win of $8,102.</p>
<p>He’s fared better online, he says, and primarily competes via internet rooms from his home in Las Vegas. He explains that he typically plays five or six hours a day, and is making a decent living.</p>
<p>Overcoming the Odds</p>
<p>The Spin &amp; Go format adds an element of pure luck to the poker table. After three players are seated at the table, a random draw determines the pot multiplier.</p>
<p>Seven percent of the buy-in goes to rake, and the odds of the pot simply being doubled are the strongest at 72.92 percent. Piccolo’s table hit the 12,000-time multiplier at ridiculous odds. Just two in every one million games, or 0.0002 percent, land on the top multiplier.</p>
<p>And as unlikely as it was to win on 0.0002 percent odds, Piccolo didn’t seem to have much chance of winning the $100,000.</p>
<p>The third-place finisher bowed out relatively quickly, but that left Piccolo as a deep short stack against the remaining opponent. After gaining the majority of chips, Piccolo’s opponent took a big risk by shoving all-in with Q-7.</p>
<p>Piccolo called with K-7, and after 3-10-3-4-2 was dealt to the community, he was the champ.</p>
