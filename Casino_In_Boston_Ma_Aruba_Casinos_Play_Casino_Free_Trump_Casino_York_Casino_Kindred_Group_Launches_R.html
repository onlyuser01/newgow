    <h1>Casino In Boston Ma Aruba Casinos Play Casino Free Trump Casino York Casino Kindred Group Launches R</h1>

<p>This marks the first phase of the Sportsbook launch which will include Unibet-branded kiosks and over-the-counter sports betting</p>
<p>Kindred Group, a leading online gambling operator, has announced the launch of its retail operations at the Swinomish Casino &amp; Lodge in Washington State.</p>
<p>Kindred Group to Launch Immersive Unibet Sports Betting Lounge in Washington</p>
<p>The next phase will see the launch of an immersive Unibet sports betting lounge, which is set to open later this year. The partnership with the Swinomish Indian Tribal Community was announced in October 2022 and includes a six-year agreement.</p>
<p>This is the 13th retail launch for Kindred Group in North America, with a retail presence in three states: Pennsylvania, Arizona, and now Washington. The company aims to continue investing in growing its North American operations where market conditions support a sustainable business model.</p>
<p>Manuel Stan, SVP of North America at Kindred Group, said: “We are delighted to launch the first phase of our exciting retail partnership with the Swinomish Indian Tribal Community. Work continues at pace to build a fantastic Unibet sportsbook lounge, offering customers to the Swinomish Casino &amp; Lodge a truly immersive sports betting experience.”</p>
<p>Kindred Group is committed to providing a safe, fair, and sustainable environment for its 30 million customers across nine brands, including Unibet. The company, which employs over 2,000 people, is listed on Nasdaq Stockholm Large Cap and is a member of the European Gaming and Betting Association (EGBA) and a founding member of IBIA (International Betting Integrity Association).</p>
<p>Kindred Group’s Proprietary Gaming Platform Approved for Launch in New Jersey</p>
<p>Just a couple of days ago, Kindred Group also received final approval from the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement for the introduction of its proprietary gaming platform in the state. The group is now set to launch the platform in mid-May, enhancing the customer experience and improving analytical data.</p>
<p>Henrik Tjärnström, CEO of Kindred Group, expressed his pride in the collective effort that made the launch possible and thanked the regulator for their professional collaboration during the approval process. The launch in New Jersey is viewed as a stepping stone towards a North American rollout, with the platform set to expand into Pennsylvania next.</p>
<p>Kindred Group’s Unibet brand has a strong presence in the US with live operations in six states, including New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Indiana, Iowa, Virginia, Arizona, and now Washington State.</p>
<p>The Unibet brand is also supporting sports through its recent partnership with the Northern Ontario Curling Association as the official sponsor for both the Men’s and Women’s Curling Championships. Furthermore, Kindred’s Unibet recently expanded its soccer commitment in France to include basketball and aims to deliver sports kits and equipment to 400 amateur clubs by 2023.</p>
