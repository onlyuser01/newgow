<p>Dear babsbh,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. I have checked the Responsible Gaming section and this is what I found (here):</p>
<p>"Self-exclusion</p>
<p>If you are concerned that your gambling is out of control, you have the right to exclude yourself from the Games and you may do so by sending an e-mail to us with your instructions as to how long you wish the account to be inaccessible. You also have the option to self-exclude your account by visiting the responsible gambling page.</p>
<p>Self-exclusions must be applied for a minimum of 6 months. At the end of the exclusion period, your account will remain inaccessible unless we are notified by yourself to reopen. We will be unable to lift the block on access during the exclusion period. Any Real Money balance remaining in your account will be returned to you subject to completing any necessary verification checks.</p>
<p>Self-exclusion means that you will not be able to play any of our Games during the term of your exclusion. This measure will be applied to all accounts you hold with Jumpman Gaming within 24 hours. This means you will not be able to access or register to any of our sites during the time of your exclusion.</p>
<p>If you decide to apply a ‘self-exclusion’ to your account, you shall not be permitted to open any new account with any Jumpman Gaming Site during the term requested. If you are in breach of your ‘self-exclusion’ (including within the first 24 hours), we shall be entitled to terminate any new account you open with any Jumpman Gaming website, forfeit any funds therein, and we shall not be liable to refund to you any funds you may have wagered or won through such account. Please see our Responsible Gambling page for more information regarding ‘self-exclusion’ and ‘cool-off’. Applying a self-exclusion will result in steps being taken to remove your name and details from any marketing databases used by the company within two days of us receiving a notification of your self-exclusion. We will also take all reasonable steps to prevent any marketing material being sent to self-excluded customers as soon as is practicable.</p>
<p>At the end of your self-exclusion, your account will remain closed. Please contact us via email if you wish to reopen the account. There will be a one day cooling off period before you can gain access to your account.</p>
<p>If you choose to self-exclude your account, we strongly recommend that you request this with any other online gaming operators you hold accounts with."</p>
<p>I also checked the forwarded screenshots:</p>
<p>Could you please advise if you reopened any of your casino accounts?</p>
<p>Looking forward to hearing from you.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
