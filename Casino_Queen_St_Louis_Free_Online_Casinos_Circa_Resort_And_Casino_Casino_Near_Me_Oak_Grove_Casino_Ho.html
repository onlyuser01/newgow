<p>New York Giants vs Green Bay Packers is the second NFL London game of the 2022 season. Tottenham Hotspur Stadium is the place where the two high-flying NFC teams will meet on Sunday, October 9. Both teams are 0.750 at the moment, each with a 3-1 record and very similar score differentials (the Packers are 75-69; the Giants are 76-71).</p>
<p>Still, performance-wise, neither team has been overly impressive. The Giants got wins against out-of-form teams while the Packers won their games after a lot of struggles. Are they going to do better in London? To see what we think, make sure to read our Giants vs Packers preview until the end.</p>

<p>Do the New York Giants Deserve to be 3-1 in 2022?</p>
<p>The Giants aren’t a great team despite the fact that they are 3-1 this season. The reason why they won so many games isn’t that they were brilliant; it’s that their opponents were horrible.</p>
<p>In Week 1, they defeated the Tennessee Titans on the road by one point. The Titans had a chance to win the game with a field goal in the final seconds of the game, but Randy Bullock missed a 47-yarder.</p>
<p>In Week 2, they beat the Carolina Panthers by three points at home. Once again, it was their opposition that was terrible. The Panthers’ offense just had a horrible day in Week 2.</p>
<p>Then, in Week 3, the Giants suffered their first loss of the season. It happened against the Dallas Cowboys who were without Dak Prescott as their QB. Nevertheless, that didn’t stop them from beating the Giants 23-16.</p>
<p>It was last weekend when the Giants picked up their third win of the season. They did it against the uninspiring Chicago Bears, whose offense failed to score a single touchdown. The final score was 20-12 for the Giants.</p>
<p>Green Bay Packers Need to Start Scoring More</p>
<p>“This way of winning, I don’t think, is sustainable,” – this is what Green Bay’s quarterback Aaron Rodgers said after his team narrowly beat the banged-up New England Patriots last Sunday. The Packers won by just three points after overtime in a game in which their opponents played with a backup QB.</p>
<p>Something similar happened a week before when they defeated the Tampa Bay Buccaneers by just two points. Knowing all this, it’s obvious that Green Bay’s defense has been playing top football, while their offense is underachieving in 2022.</p>
<p>They do have one of the best quarterbacks in history to call the signals, however, Aaron Rodgers needs support to be able to produce great stats. In 2022, Davante Adams is no longer on the team, which can explain why Rodgers has served just six touchdown passes so far.</p>
<p>New York Giants vs Green Bay Packers Prediction</p>
<p>The Packers are a far better team than the Giants so anything but a win for Rodgers &amp; Co. would be a huge surprise. Not only do we think the Packers are going to win, but we also think they’re going to produce their best offensive display of the season.</p>
<p>Picks: Green Bay Packers to win and cover the spread; over to hit</p>
