<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>I have the following problem on the weekend, Saturday, I applied for a payout of 500 euros, unfortunately it is limited, which is also in the terms and conditions and not bad, then it was increased to 800 euros per day, then I applied for 800 euros twice, even have I sent my ID and proof of address directly by email because I know that these documents are always required for verification, so that the payout may be faster, but I don't get an answer every time the support says your payout is being processed and it's still taking time, me I don't get any information about what's missing, e.g. verification or how long it usually takes. Normally I wanted to wait another 2 to 3 days before submitting the complaint, but I don't think that will do anything, so I'm submitting it now, today the support gave me Written I should verify my account on the website but the hack is on verification you can't verify it , so I'm being assed by the casino, so I have to file a complaint now that the casino keeps making excuses just because they don't want to pay out the winnings, first it said the payout is in progress and now it says a few days later the payout was never in Processing because the account is not verified but you never said what you need ? Hopefully you can help me, I've already made screenshots of the whole process, including the account balance there, so I have enough evidence if the casino faxes, probably the next thing to do is cancel the 3 withdrawal requests and then the game starts all over again and With luck, I only get 800 euros once a month and have to wait 10 months for the money, which is definitely not ok, I can pay out 12,000 per month, according to the terms and conditions, the payout can take a maximum of 3 days, which means it can take a maximum of 4 to 5 weeks .</p>
<p>please help me thank you</p>
<p>Best regards, Michael W***</p>
