    <h1>River Casino Pittsburgh Monte Carlo Resort And Casino Win Real Money Casino Online Casino In Souther</h1>

<p>Goodnight! I made the account at vulkan vegas and got a certain amount to withdraw. well, when submitting my documents for KYC verification, after a few days I received an email after contacting them via chat, informing them that my account was verified. I went there, trying to request the withdrawal of my credits, but it was still with "incomplete" status. I decided to contact the attendants again, so the attendant informed me that my account was not yet verified, but I replied that I had an error, as I had already received the account verification confirmation email. I sent the photo of the email to her, she went to look in the system and verified that my account was verified, and that my withdrawal request would be confirmed in a few hours or days, ok. Another day has passed and no change in the status of the withdrawal request. I contacted the attendant again, she again informed me that my account was not verified yet. but again I informed that it had been 2 days since I had received the verification email. she said that my account status was not yet verified and that she was going to forward my case to the responsible sector and that I would wait for the case to be resolved. In the evening I contacted the chat again, and to my surprise, the attendant informed me that my account was not yet verified and that the email I received was 1 error. I wanted to know if I will be able to have the account verified someday and if I will be able to carry out my withdrawal.</p>
