<p>3888 Ways of the Dragon review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>3888 Ways of the Dragon has opted for more of a style than a real theme. The game features the titular dragons from Chinese mythology set against a background of digital watercolours depicting cloudy mountains and cherry blossom trees.</p>
<p>On the reels the dragons are joined by frogs and tortoises, coins and precious stones, while in the background Chinese musical instruments play.</p>
<p>Unlike many of iSoftBet’s Asian themed slots, this one lands pretty well in presenting a unique take on a worn-out theme.</p>
<p>Ultra win gained with combination of the Dragon spin and free spins</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>With iSoftBet’s usual high standard of art applied to it’s more idiosyncratic design choices, 3888 Ways of the Dragon is a delight at the visual level. More imaginative and stylish than some of the other slots from this particular publisher, 3888 Ways of the Dragon is a really immersive game.</p>
<p>The music lacks some of the creativity shown elsewhere but it is perfectly serviceable, as are the sound effects and animations.</p>
<p>Overall, 3888 Ways of the Dragon is a very well presented slot.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>3888 Ways of the Dragon gets its name from its any way wins system on the unique 3-6-6-6-6 reel structure. This means wins are generated for symbols anywhere on the reels, provided that they run from leftmost reel to the right and are on consecutive reels.</p>
<p>The reel structure makes for 3,888 ways to win, hence the title.</p>
<p>On top of this are a few bonus features designed to spice things up (details below).</p>
<p>Overall, the novelty factor helps to sell what might otherwise have been rather standard gameplay.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbols substitute for all other symbols apart from the Bonus symbol.</p>
<p>Three or four Bonus symbols anywhere on the reels will trigger eight free spins and eighteen free spins respectively.</p>
<p>During any random spin a Dragon Spin can be triggered. When this occurs, three to eight wilds are added to the reels at random, and the winnings recalculated.</p>
<p>Dragon spin can occur at any spin of the game</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 95.95%, which is very close to our yardstick of roughly 96% for average.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum of $/£/€0.30 to a maximum bet per spin of $/£/€150.00.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is medium-high, which will work alright with our preferred strategies although we might be happier with higher volatility given the average-looking return to player.</p>
<p>Full paytable forr 3888 Ways of the Dragon slot</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>3888 Ways of the Dragon has a lot of style visually and just enough of a twist in its gameplay to get its players intrigued.</p>
<p>However, in most other ways it tends to be a bit average. RTP and volatility are underwhelming and the bonuses are a bit basic.</p>
<p>That is not to say we can’t recommend 3888 Ways of the Dragon, but that recommendation could be a fair bit stronger.</p>
