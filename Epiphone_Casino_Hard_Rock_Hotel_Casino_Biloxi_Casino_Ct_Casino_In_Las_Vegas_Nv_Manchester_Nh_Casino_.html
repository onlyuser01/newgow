    <h1>Epiphone Casino Hard Rock Hotel Casino Biloxi Casino Ct Casino In Las Vegas Nv Manchester Nh Casino</h1>

<p>The company has used the occasion of ICE London 2023 to strengthen its reach in core markets and pivot its products towards new audiences</p>
<p>The Bulgaria-headquartered supplier and developer of online casino games confirmed that it will be strengthening its presence in the Lithuanian gambling market, with 7bet.lt signed as an official operator partner in the country.</p>
<p>CT Interactive Pushes Its Content Offer in the Baltics</p>
<p>Moving forward, CT Interactive will provide 7bet.lt players with an extensive variety of its own products, to name options such as 40 Treasures, Banana Party, and Lucky Clover. The new opportunity was hailed by CT Interactive’s head of business development, Milena Tsankarska, who said:</p>
<p>We had an incredibly successful presentation at ICE London, and we are very proud to announce that we have reached new heights in the Lithuanian market with such as prosperous partner as 7bet.lt. It will be the second operator in the market we will have our content live with. CT Interactive head of business development, Milena Tsankarska</p>
<p>The launch is expected to take place before the end of the year, with CT Interactive talking about a “new portion” of its games being rolled out. 7bet.lt casino product manager was similarly pleased with the development. Gintarė Karvelytė said that the company was very pleased to see the content by CT Interactive added to its library.</p>
<p>“We are honored to say that the exclusive package of games will be available with us. This is one of the keys to our company’s success,” Karvelytė added.</p>
<p>Busy End of the Year, Strong Start of the New One</p>
<p>CT Interactive has been very busy expanding its reach further into European markets. The company struck an interactive content deal with Belgium-focused PepperMill Casino in January. Prior to that in December, CT Interactive enjoyed a very busy holiday season, with the company establishing a number of partnerships.</p>
<p>Early in December, CT Interactive was certified to offer more of its games in the Spanish iGaming market. The company made another quick stride in the Italian market just a few weeks after that, with MondoGaming. Not least, CT Interactive agreed on a content distribution deal with TimelessTech. At the very end of the year on December 29, CT Interactive revealed its last deal for 2022, having teamed up with Betmarket for additional reach and pull.</p>
