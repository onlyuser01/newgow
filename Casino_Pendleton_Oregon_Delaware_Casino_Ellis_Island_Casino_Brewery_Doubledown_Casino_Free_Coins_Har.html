<p>Gaming Realms announced that it would launch its services, focusing on its Slingo Original games, in Québec through its partnership with Loto-Québec, the provincial corporation, which is the only regulated iGaming operator in the namesake Canadian province. Québec is home to approximately 8.5 million people, and therefore one of the biggest iGaming markets in Canada.</p>
<p>Gaming Realms’ Portfolio Goes Live on Loto-Québec</p>
<p>Gaming Realms, a UK-based company that develops, publishes and licenses Slingo, slots, and casino games for mobile, will first launch Slingo Extreme and Blackjack Xchange on Loto-Québec’s iGaming platform. The rest of the games in the portfolio will follow soon after. The Slingo game type has been available to residents of Québec for a while now and annual ticket sales reach several million tickets.</p>
<p>Gaming Realms plans to launch its mobile gaming content in the province with its North American partner, Light &amp; Wonder (formerly known as Scientific Games Corporation), a cross-platform iGaming company, which is a member of the World Lottery Association.</p>
<p>Mark Segal, the chief financial officer of Gaming Realms, stated that after obtaining a license in Ontario, Gaming Realms was delighted with the launch of the company’s products in the new province. He also added that 2022 is considered an “exciting time” for the mobile gaming content developer as the company is gaining a significant foothold in the Canadian market with plans to expand even further in the North American region.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Stéphane Martel, the head of products and innovation at Loto-Québec, commented that Gaming Realms’ gaming content is a great addition to Loto-Québec’s online casino games portfolio and Loto-Québec’s customers would enjoy the new offers available in the platform.</p>
<p>Gaming Realms Clears Entry Barrier to Join Ontario Market</p>
<p>Gaming Realms’ Quebec entry comes after the company secured a license in Ontario through a subsidiary, Alchemybet Limited, earlier in March. The Canadian province is about to launch its iGaming market on April 4, 2022, as confirmed in January 2022. The new launch date was set up following delays with Ontario initially planning to open for private companies in December 2021.</p>
<p>Gaming Realms plans to launch its full games portfolio in Ontario, as the population of the province is approximately 15 million people – bigger than any US state where the company holds a license to supply products. The developer expects to realize higher revenues than in New Jersey, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, where Gaming Realms is present. A recent report issued by PlayCanada states that the launch of private online gambling operators on the Canadian market would bring approximately 1,300 additional job positions to Ontario, albeit there are those who have feared the launch of the market, citing significant job losses.</p>
<p>Loto-Québec became the first Canadian province to roll out games by Red Tiger earlier this week. This follows another partnership between Red Tiger’s parent company, Evolution, and Loto-Québec which agreed to expand the live casino game partnership last week.</p>
