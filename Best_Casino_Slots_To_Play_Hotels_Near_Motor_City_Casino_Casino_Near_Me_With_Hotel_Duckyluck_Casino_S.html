<p>Scientific Games has picked Angela Goodwin to lead the company’s instant game management program, a core division of the business and an important driver of revenue. Goodwin is a promotion from within as she has been with the company for close to two decades now, originally joining in 2007 as Instant Game Manufacturing Coordinator and has accumulated a wealth of management and product manufacturing experience.</p>
<p>As part of Scientific Games, she served as Senior Director of SGEP Operations and Global Instant Products, and has been well-versed in the company’s structure, internal processes, and ethos, making her an ideal candidate for the company’s long-term growth and outlook. She is also a BA in Business Management from Georgia Southwestern State University.</p>
<p>As to her newest role, Goodwin will oversee Scientific Games Enhanced Partnership programs and help with the provision of instant game portfolio management to the company’s lottery partners – which includes more than 20 names at this point.</p>
<p>Her appointment was welcomed by Scientific Games President of Americas and Global Instant Products John Schulz who was very excited to see an established team member grow through the ranks and add more value to the company’s operations.</p>
<p>Schulz had this to add, commenting on Goodwin’s appointment: "We believe that Angela’s natural leadership skills, overall management philosophy and extensive knowledge of our SGEP operations will provide the strategic vision to evolve the program and achieve growth for our lottery customers by responsibly driving instant product performance."</p>
<p>Goodwin will collaborate with a team of product management experts in the United States where SGEP’s operations are. She will also work closely with other teams and divisions within the company, such as sales and marketing, as well as the government affairs team. The fact that she has been around Scientific Games for 16 years is another important factor, as she can move freely through the organization and can seek assistance from relevant departments easily.</p>
<p>She will continue Scientific Games’ mission which is to provide partners globally with an excellent lottery content in all its forms. Presently, Scientific Games has more than 130 customers across 50 countries. Scientific Games has worked on many innovative solutions over the past months. The company came up with a Game of Thrones-themed title for its lottery product, continuing to think outside of the box and deliver market-leading experience.</p>
