    <h1>Casinos In California Rohnert Park Casino Casino With Slot Machines Near Me Resorts Casino Hotel Atl</h1>

<p>Unfortunately it's not just about Germany. I feel like most of the people who worked on the gambling law have never seen an online casino and they have no idea how that works.</p>
<p>I'd say the main aim was to make more money on gambling for the government so they decided to add additional taxation. That's kind of OK, the problem is that decided to add the tax to turnover so no matter if your spin loses or wins, you need to pay over 5% from every single spin to the government. The result?</p>
<p>Casinos lowered the standard RTP on games by 5% 😀 = players win 5% less and the money is sent to the government instead of the players 😀But you know, the players are "protected" now 😀</p>
<p>Jokes aside, poor Germans 🙁</p>
