<p>Lifestyle sports betting and online gaming brand MaximBet announced today a marketing partnership with Colorado Rockies Charlie Blackmon to become the first sports betting brand to partner with an active professional baseball player.</p>
<p>‘Perfect Fit for MaximBet’</p>
<p>The ground-breaking agreement between Blackmon known as “Chuck Nazty” and MaximBet will see the MLB pro appear in marketing campaigns, fan events, and social media announcements of the sports betting brand.</p>
<p>Commenting on his new role, four-time MLB All-Star and second-longest tenured player in the history of the baseball franchise based in Denver Blackmon stated his intuition that MaximBet represented the “right brand” for him was getting stronger the more he was learning about the brand.</p>
<p>“MaximBet has really attached itself to the local Colorado community, and I cannot wait to have some fun with MaximBet and surprising fans with incredible ‘money can’t buy’ experiences all season.” Charlie Blackmon, Brand Ambassador, MaximBet</p>
<p>Blackmon, who ranks second in all-time hits, games played and at-bats for the Colorado Rockies and is third in runs scored and total bases in the history of the MLB franchise competing in the National League West division, became the first active professional athlete from the four major US sports leagues to become an ambassador for MaximBet.</p>
<p>“Charlie is one of the most revered Rockies players of all time, and his style and career success makes him a perfect fit for MaximBet. We are thrilled to welcome Charlie to the MaximBet family. We look forward to him hitting it out of the ballpark for us as we continue to grow in Colorado and across the country.” Daniel Graetzer, CEO, MaximBet</p>
<p>A 2017 NL Batting Champion, Blackmon became a Rockies in the second round of the 2008 draft and has been playing his entire professional career for the Colorado franchise.</p>
<p>Custom Designed Items by SolesbySir</p>
<p>The sports betting brand which is currently live in the Centennial State operated by Carousel Group in partnership with premier lifestyle brand Maxim, hired the services of custom artist Marcus Rivero, a.k.a. SolesbySir to design unique personal interest and baseball items for Blackmon as part of their partnership and to promote Maxim’s premier lifestyle.</p>
<p>SolesbySir designed a custom co-branded Rawlings glove, Nike cleats, and New Era Rockies hat for the active professional baseball player, as well as a personalized tackle bag, fisherman’s scissors, and cooler to tailor to Blackmon’s personal interest in fishing.</p>
<p>Further, MaximBet and Rivero will gift select new account holders with custom items from the SolesbySir Collection, with every new sign-up by April 30 eligible to receive the gifts.</p>
<p>Outside of Colorado, MaximBet is planning to go live in Indiana and Iowa next and has already acquired market access in New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, as well as Ontario in Canada.</p>
