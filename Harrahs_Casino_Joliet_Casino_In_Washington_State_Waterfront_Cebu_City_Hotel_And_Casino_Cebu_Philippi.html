    <h1>Harrahs Casino Joliet Casino In Washington State Waterfront Cebu City Hotel And Casino Cebu Philippi</h1>

<p>SportingWin is determined to remain the leading gambling brand in the Bulgarian market, which is now possible through a new deal with Pinnacle</p>
<p>The new partnership will allow SportingWin to access Pinnacle’s dedicated B2B iFrame solution and give the brand a further boost in the country. SportingWin has a reputation for being one of the go-to betting options in the market, and iFrame will hopefully consolidate this status, the company says.</p>
<p>SportingWin Leverages Powerful Pinnacle Tech</p>
<p>Pinnacle’s cutting-edge technology is held in high esteem by the industry, and SportingWin has decided to invest in this product in order to attract what it hopes would be quality customers.</p>
<p>Through the iFrame option, SportingWin is determined to improve retention and reduce volatility, while optimizing performance across the board. The operator has already generated €500,000 in net revenue since its launch in the last quarter of 2022.</p>
<p>Pinnacle’s products should considerably boost SportingWin’s financial operations, as the Bulgarian gambling market is experiencing fast and determined growth. SportingWin is also eyeing neighboring Romania and planning to push forward there as well.</p>
<p>SportingWin investment director Mark Chakravarti hailed the opportunity for his company to work with Pinnacle, an industry powerhouse, that will resonate with local players in Bulgaria and help further establish the sportsbook in the highly-competitive market.</p>
<p>Company Is Committed to Attracting High-Quality Customers</p>
<p>Chakravarti and his company are confident that SportingWin should focus on the 5% of quality customers who often drive more than 80% of the operator’s revenue, which is precisely what the addition of Pinnacle to the mix. Chakravarti added:</p>
<p>We have got off to a great start in Bulgaria with our SportingWin brand, but this partnership with Pinnacle really does mark our arrival in the market where we expect to become a major player over the next 12 months. SportingWin investment director Mark Chakravarti</p>
<p>Pinnacle business development director Rohini Sardana was equally pleased with the opportunity and said that Pinnacle Solution was built to particularly aid third-party companies in helping them provide relevant experiences to their customer bases. SportingWin will now benefit from this and more, and retain its market-leading position, Sardana assured.</p>
