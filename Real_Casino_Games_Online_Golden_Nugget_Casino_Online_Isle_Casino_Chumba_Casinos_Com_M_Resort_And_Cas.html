<p>The new game adapts the Mega Wheel format to deliver a one-of-a-kind version that ensures players get a seamless gaming experience</p>
<p>Leading online casino content provider Pragmatic Play has unveiled an expansion of its partnership with 1xBet. Under the renewed agreement, the former company will supply its client with a bespoke live casino game show called Wheel of Luck.</p>
<p>According to the announcement, the new game is based on Pragmatic Play’s beloved Mega Wheel game show. A customized version of the famous title, Wheel of Luck will help 1xBet engage its customers with unprecedented live casino experiences.</p>
<p>In addition to the new game, Pragmatic Play will continue to supply the operator with premium content. 1xBet was one of the first gambling companies to integrate Pragmatic Play’s live casino products in addition to the provider’s slot library, bingo games and scratch card offerings.</p>
<p>Beside Wheel of Luck, the live casino experiences supplied to 1xBet include dedicated studios, customisable tables, and unique branded gaming experiences.</p>
<p>The expansion of the agreement with 1xBet follows recent deals with other major companies. Earlier this month, Pragmatic Play supplied live casino to the 888-owned brand William Hill. Prior to that, the provider also struck a new commercial deal with GAMRFIRST in Switzerland.</p>
<p>The New Game Will Help 1xBet Stand Out</p>
<p>1xBet’s Maria G commented on the agreement with Pragmatic Play, praising the company as a provider of “exceptional, player-favorite live dealer products.” She said that her team has been very content to work with Pragmatic Play and offer its live casino portfolio.</p>
<p>According to Maria G, Wheel of Luck will strengthen 1xBet, allowing it to engage players with a bespoke game they cannot find anywhere else.</p>
<p>We are thrilled with the final product and look forward to further growing our Live games customer base with this engaging new release. Maria G, 1xBet</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play’s chief operating officer, Irina Cornides, also shared her thoughts on the expanded partnership. She expressed her confidence that Pragmatic Play will continue to achieve great things with 1xBet, which has trusted the supplier for so long.</p>
<p>Commenting on the new release, Cornides said that Wheel of Luck is an exciting new game show that only 1xBet fans will be able to try out.</p>
<p>Our collaboration with the 1xBet team allowed us to adapt our beloved Mega Wheel format to deliver a one-of-a-kind version that ensures their players get a seamless gaming experience that is integrated with their branding. Irina Cornides, COO, Pragmatic Play</p>
<p>In other news, Pragmatic Play just launched two new slots, namely 8 Golden Dragon Challenge and a new John Hunter entry.</p>
