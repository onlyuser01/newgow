<p>This collaboration aims to ensure adherence to state-specific regulations and maintain the sports integrity</p>
<p>In a move to uphold the integrity of mixed martial arts (MMA), the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) has joined forces with ProhiBet, a pioneering sports betting compliance solution, to reinforce regulatory compliance and combat prohibited sports betting activities.</p>
<p>ProhiBet Safeguards MMA Integrity Through Innovative Monitoring</p>
<p>ProhiBet, an advanced notification platform, has been designed to monitor and flag prohibited betting activities, primarily focusing on UFC athletes, coaches, employees, and officials who are prohibited from placing bets on UFC events.</p>
<p>The significance of this partnership lies in the necessity to protect the integrity of MMA across the nation. State-by-state regulations have long prohibited certain individuals, including athletes, coaches, and league officials, from engaging in sports wagering. ProhiBet’s encrypted decentralized cross-monitoring and notification platform provides a comprehensive solution to enforce these regulatory requirements.</p>
<p>Riché T. McKnight, executive vice president &amp; general counsel of UFC, expressed the organization’s commitment to integrity:</p>
<p>One of the foundations of UFC’s success is our dedication to embracing regulation and compliance to promote safety and fairness in our sport. Our collaboration with ProhiBet is another step towards strengthening our integrity controls by helping us to enforce our anti-gambling policy and support the integrity of our sport. Riché T. McKnight, executive vice president &amp; general counsel, UFC</p>
<p>Matt Heap, managing director of ProhiBet, formerly head of the Colorado Division of Gaming’s sportsbook operations, is confident that this partnership will enhance transparency and trustworthiness in sports betting.</p>
<p>UFC Takes Action Against Krause Betting Scandal with ProhiBet Collaboration</p>
<p>ProhiBet is a joint venture between US Integrity and Odds On Compliance, two renowned entities in the sports wagering and compliance technology sector. UFC’s adoption of ProhiBet builds upon its existing relationship with US Integrity, which earlier this year was appointed as the official betting integrity service for all UFC events, including Dana White’s Contender Series.</p>
<p>The utilization of ProhiBet by UFC comes in the wake of a high-profile investigation initiated by the FBI last year regarding suspicious betting activities surrounding a bout between Darrick Minner and Shayilan Nuerdanbieke on November 5. Several individuals, including Minner, his coach James Krause, and teammate Jeff Molina, have been suspended by the Nevada State Athletic Commission pending ongoing government investigations. UFC took measures to distance itself from Krause, who was reported to have worked for an offshore bookmaking operation for years.</p>
<p>To further reinforce compliance, UFC fighters will receive a compliance training video provided by US Integrity, emphasizing that prohibited bettors include anyone with inside knowledge of MMA participants. These prohibited insiders encompass coaches, managers, handlers, athletic trainers, medical professionals, relatives residing with athletes, and anyone with access to non-public information about participants in any match.</p>
<p>The video underscores the potential consequences, including contractual penalties, suspension, or termination, for offenders who engage in sports wagering on UFC events, either individually or through third parties.</p>
