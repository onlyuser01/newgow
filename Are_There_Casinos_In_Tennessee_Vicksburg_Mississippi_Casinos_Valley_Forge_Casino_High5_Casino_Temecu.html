    <h1>Are There Casinos In Tennessee Vicksburg Mississippi Casinos Valley Forge Casino High5 Casino Temecu</h1>

<p>Dear Stefan,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. Iâ€™m very sorry to hear about your negative experience. I checked the self-exclusion section and I found this:</p>
<p>"Self-Exclusion</p>
<p>Alternatively, you may feel you need a longer break from gambling; in that case you can choose to self-exclude for a specific period of time.</p>
<p>Self-exclusion means that you can choose a more extended period that your account will remain closed. Please contact us only via email and inform us about your decision to pause your activities at the Website. Upon receipt of an email request for account closure, the requested account will be placed on our 1st stage, 24-hr cooling off period which will disable your account, allowing no gambling activity. Once the 1st stage 24-hr cooling off period has passed, while your account remained closed, a Customer Support Agent will inform you of the available self-exclusions periods. There can be no variations of the pre-selected time periods. After that and in order to proceed with this process, we will require an email response from you. If we do not receive a response within a further 24-hrs, your account will be reopened and confirmed by email. Once you begin your Self-Exclusion period, your account will be disabled and you will not be able to deposit or withdraw funds for the period the Self-Exclusion is enabled. Upon expiration of the Self-Exclusion, your account will automatically be re-activated."</p>
<p>Have you discussed this issue directly with the casino?</p>
<p>Please, forward me your self-exclusion request together with any other relevant communication between you and the casino. My email address is kristina.s@casino.guru.</p>
<p>Additionally, could you please clarify what you mean by "listing a very reputable casino"? As you can see in our review, this casino has a rating of 2.8/10 and has a Very bad reputation.</p>
<p>I will be waiting for your reply patiently.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Kristina</p>
