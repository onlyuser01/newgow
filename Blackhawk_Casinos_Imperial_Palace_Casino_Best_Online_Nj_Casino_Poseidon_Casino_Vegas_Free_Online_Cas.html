    <h1>Blackhawk Casinos Imperial Palace Casino Best Online Nj Casino Poseidon Casino Vegas Free Online Cas</h1>

<p>It’s not the amount of the withdrawal that I’m concerned about. Though it’s been nearly 1 month now that I have been dealing with this, which is absurd, I’m no longer annoyed with waiting for it. I am annoyed at how they can stand by and feed ill informed knowledge to their customers about withdrawal procedures. After 3 days, my account verification process was finally complete and they emailed saying it should now only be 1-4 days and I would receive my winnings. I was informed by numerous employees of differing amounts of time I could expect to have my request deposited into my bank account. Having 1-4 days being the most stated I was also told 4-8, 1-8, and because of account verification and bank holidays it also reached up to 20 in one of the exchanges. Though every time it was stated my account had been verified and it should not be much longer to have my request. The extensive amount of time I was subjected to cynical and uneducated information, over $80 is unbelievable. After 2 weeks of not receiving the requested withdrawal or having a definitive amount of time I could expect it, I began to lose my composure. I started sending more emails to Dreamz regarding my concerns and experience with this matter. In the entire process I have exchanged emails and live chats with 9 different people and "the payment team" in total and at one point 3 people in a single day. There has never been only one single person assigned to assist with my account concerns and the lack of communication is outstanding. I have had to explain my situation to all of them so many different times that I now have a copy and paste option accessible I can use. All of this being said, the thing that bothers me the most is Dreamz nonchalant attitudes towards the customers emotions and making sure the customer is leaving content enough with the service Dreamz establishment has supplied that the customer will again return. I have never received a GENUINE apology or even a bonus spin as a thank you or gift saying, "We appreciate your business. Thanks for being loyal and understanding in this time of our passive incompetence, garbage customer service and questionable business practices." After 3 weeks of waiting and being told I should have it in 1-4 days, I mentioned that I was now beginning to become angry about all of this and asked if there was something they were willing to offer me to try and get me to remain a customer and continue to make deposits to the casino. They told me "I’m sorry but at this time we do not have any bonuses available. Your account has been verified now and you should receive it in 1-4 days. If it doesn’t arrive by then get in touch with us again and we will be happy to investigate the matter." Unbelievable. I will get my withdrawal, eventually, if it’s the last thing I do but I will never spend another cent or be a part of an establishment that cares less about people, its integrity, or losing customers than it does a few free spins.</p>
