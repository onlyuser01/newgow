<p>Covington is #1 in Welterweight Rankings for a Reason</p>
<p>Colby Covington is 16-3 in his professional career. The first of those three defeats happened back in 2015 when he lost to Warlley Alves. The other two happened within his previous three bouts – both times he lost to Kamaru Usman while fighting for the UFC Welterweight Championship.</p>
<p>Covington might be 1-2 in his previous three fights, but he remains at the top of the UFC Welterweight Rankings. At the age of 34, he still has time to challenge the championship belt once again. However, if he loses on Saturday, he might not get a chance to fight for the title any time soon.</p>
<p>He has the motivation to win, but does he have the skills to do so? Covington is an all-around fighter who’s equally good with striking and fighting on the floor. Still, this time, he’s fighting a really tough opponent.</p>
<p>Can Masvidal Upset the Odds?</p>
<p>Jorge Masvidal is 35-15 in his professional career which started back in 2003. He might not have an as impressive record as Covington, but he definitely has the experience on his side. This guy’s fought a number of high-profile fighters, including Kamaru Usman, the current champ. He did fight Usman twice, but same as Covington, he ended up losing both times.</p>
<p>However, before the two losses, he defeated Nate Diaz, Ben Askren, Daren Till, and many others. Thanks to his impressive record from a few years back, he still remains pretty high in the UFC Welterweight Rankings. At the moment, he is sitting in the #6 place. If he wins on Saturday, he could climb up a few spots.</p>
<p>So, can he win? Although the odds are against him, he surely has the skillset to win. It’s not going to be easy but if one of his punches lands in Covington’s face, it would mean the end of the fight. Masvidal is a real knockout expert, with 16 of his 35 wins happening this way.</p>
<p>Pick: Jorge Masvidal by Knockout</p>
