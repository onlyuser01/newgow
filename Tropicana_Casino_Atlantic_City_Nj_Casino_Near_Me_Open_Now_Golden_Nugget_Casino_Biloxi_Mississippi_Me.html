<p>It’s triple trouble for The Star, which is not only on the ropes but very well might be out of the fight entirely. The NSW Independent Casino Commission (NICC) has decided following the damning Bell Report, which has resulted in the regulator opting to fine The Star for AU$100m ($62.37m), suspend the company’s license and further appoint a manager to oversee day-to-day operations and the longer strategic path to recovery. This decision comes months after The Star claimed it was suitable for a license.</p>
<p>NICC Chief Commissioner Philip Crawford confirmed all of this in an official press release published on the NSW government’s website. The suspension will come into effect on Friday, 21, Crawford confirmed, and it will see the appointed manager take over. Crawford was unapologetic about what had motivated the NICC to act this way:</p>
<p>"The NICC has resolved that it is no longer in the public interest that The Star should remain in control of that license, and that The Star is not currently suitable to be the holder of the license."</p>
<p>He did give The Star credit, however. The regulator noted that The Star’s Board of Directors and C-level executives have acknowledged the failings outlined in the Bell Report and have apologized publicly for allowing this to happen. Crawford further commended the executives and entire team at The Star for showing readiness to cooperate with the NICC.</p>
<p>In fact, these actions have clearly demonstrated that the current management at The Star has been determined to make amendments and ensure that the company can continue to operate in NSW in the future, as it is also tied to hundreds of jobs in the state.</p>
<p>However, the final word will be left with Nicholas Weeks, the manager whom the NICC appointed. Weeks’ task will not be an easy one, as he will have to guide The Star towards sustainability. More importantly, the newly appointed manager will have to see if there are ways to achieve sustainability in the first place.</p>
<p>Crawford is hopeful that The Star’s new CEO, Robbie Cooke, can bring around the changes that are sorely needed to overcome this choppy period, as sustainability will be the main priority of what is worked on from here on in. Weeks’ appointment will see the entire team at The Star come together in an attempt to make sure that the company stays on the right path.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Crawford is cautiously optimistic that The Star can still enact the reforms necessary to steer the company towards full recovery and sustainability.</p>
