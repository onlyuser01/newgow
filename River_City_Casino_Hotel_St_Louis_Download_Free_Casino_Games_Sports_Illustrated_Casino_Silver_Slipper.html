<p>Evolution, the Sweden-based business-to-business interactive gaming developer specializing in live dealer games, debuted Crazy Time in the Garden State on Tuesday. The live game show is wildly popular overseas, but this marks the foray of the product in the U.S.</p>
<p>Crazy Time, Evolution’s number one online live game show in its global operations combines the gameplay of Wheel of Fortune and The Price is Right into a live betting program. Players bet on which number the wheel will land on and can participate in a separate side bonus bet game.</p>
<p>Crazy Time is a multicamera live game show with a live host. The gameplay centers around a spinning wheel and four interactive bonus games: Cash Hunt, Coin Flip, Pachinko, and Crazy Time Wheel Bonus.</p>
<p>The main game involves bettors placing a bet on one of four numbers: 1, 2, 5, or 10. The wheel spins, and if it lands on the player’s corresponding number, they win, multiplying their bet up to 25x. The multiplier is based on a separate slot spin.</p>
<p>The bonus bet hits when the wheel lands on the player’s chosen game. The bonus round is then initiated, and the player can win up to a staggering 10K times their wager.</p>
<p>New Jersey iGaming Sites</p>
<p>Evolution provides live dealer games for several online casinos operating in New Jersey, including DraftKings Casino, BetMGM Casino, Caesars Palace Online Casino, and BetRivers Casino. Evolution operates a live dealer studio in Atlantic City, where its tables can be accessed remotely from gamblers physically located within the state who are at least 21 years old.</p>
<p>Jacob Claesson, CEO of Evolution North America, said the debut of the live game show marked a “landmark launch” for the company.</p>
<p>Across the world, operators and players alike have praised Crazy Time’s incredibly high production values, its commitment to entertainment and depth of engagement, and the sheer fun and enjoyment it offers players. We’re incredibly excited that U.S. players now get to experience a game that has made such an impact in the live casino space,” said Claesson.</p>
<p>Evolution did not say if Crazy Time would be offered on each of its four partnered iGaming platforms. Emails from Casino.org to Evolution seeking clarity went unanswered.</p>
<p>Live Gaming Expands</p>
<p>Online casino gambling is legal in just six states. Along with New Jersey, iGaming is regulated in Delaware, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Michigan, and Connecticut.</p>
<p>Online slots and table games bring the casino home and allow players to compete anywhere they have a secure internet connection. The iGaming platforms have also ventured into innovative products like Crazy Time that are not commonly found in the nine brick-and-mortar casinos in Atlantic City.</p>
<p>“Crazy Times‘ bonus games in particular, have reinvented the way casino games are played and how they can be enjoyed in a more interactive manner,” Claesson added.</p>
<p>New Jersey is the richest iGaming state in the country. Through October, the state’s online casinos have won over $1.57 billion from remote players.</p>
