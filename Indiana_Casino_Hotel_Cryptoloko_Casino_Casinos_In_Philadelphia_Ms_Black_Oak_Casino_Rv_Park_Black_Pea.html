    <h1>Indiana Casino Hotel Cryptoloko Casino Casinos In Philadelphia Ms Black Oak Casino Rv Park Black Pea</h1>

<p>Dear sir/madam,</p>
<p>I have been a client of Quatro Casino (Casino Rewards member) for several months, made 4 deposits via Astro Voucher (55 USD in total), but no withdrawals. The problem with them began when I received a bonus in the form of 2000 Vip points (20 USD) on May 19, 2022. After completion of 30x wagering requirement, I requested a withdrawal (154 USD) to my Skrill wallet. The Risk Management required a verification, which I successfully completed. On May 24 the funds (154 USD) were reportedly sent to my Skrill wallet. This operation has a successful status in my personal member area on the casino website, but in fact it was reversed (see screen "sessions" attached). I think that transfer restrictions have been placed on my Skrill wallet.</p>
<p>My message to Risk Management dated May 28, 2022:</p>
<p>Dear sir/madam,</p>
<p>I was advised by the Customer Service to resolve this issue with my withdrawal through your department. As I was informed, funds in the amount of 154 usd were sent on 24052022 to my Skrill account but I have not received them yet. I think my Skrill account is suspended because of sanctions. Please advise other WD options - will bank card / transfer work in my case?</p>
<p>Best regards</p>
<p>Anatoly B</p>
<p>After that I added a new payment method to my account (MuchBetter wallet) and tested it with Villento Casino (Casino Rewards member as well) by making a deposit.</p>
<p>My message to Risk Management dated May 30, 2022:</p>
<p>Dear sir/madam,</p>
<p>Please take into consideration the new payment method added to my account (see screen attached).</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Anatoly B</p>
<p>In the meantime, I managed to increase my winnings at Quatro to 478 USD.</p>
<p>My second withdrawal in the amount of 250 USD was requested on June 5, 2022</p>
<p>My message to Risk Management dated June 9, 2022:</p>
<p>Dear sir/madam,</p>
<p>This is regarding my latest withdrawal dated June 5, 2022.</p>
<p>I sent 250 USD to MuchBetter wallet but have not received the funds yet. I used that wallet on May 29, 2022, for deposit purposes at CR member casino (see screen attached).</p>
<p>Today, June 9, 2022, I was advised by your Customer Service to resolve this issue through your department. May I ask you what is the problem?</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Anatoly B</p>
<p>After that, on June 9, 2022, I received this message from Risk Management:</p>
<p>Hello Anatoly,</p>
<p>Thank you for your email.</p>
<p>Unfortunately due to the current regulatory environment, we cannot allow any further activity on your accounts at this time.</p>
<p>Kind Regards,</p>

<p>I was surprised, since my account has not been banned, I have not seen any warnings about the new rules / new clauses in the Casino T&amp;C and could log in freely and play without any restrictions. As such, on June 9, 2022, I filed a complaint to their Customer Service Department, as per their T&amp;C:</p>
<p>Dear sir/madam,</p>
<p>I would like to file a complaint with regards to my latest withdrawal dated June 5, 2022.</p>
<p>Please find all supporting documents attached.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Anatoly B</p>
<p>Since I have not received any confirmation whether my complaint being registered or not, on the next day, i.e. June 10, 2022, I sent a query about the status of my complaint:</p>
<p>Dear sir/ madam,</p>
<p>Please let me know the status of my complaint.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Anatoly B</p>
<p>To my second time surprise, on June 15, 2022, I found that my funds (250 USD) were sent back to my account at Quatro Casino (see screen "sessions" attached). May be this was done because I put complaints@ecogra.org address in my previous query?</p>
<p>So, after this I tried to withdraw the rest of my funds (200 USD) for the third time. I sent my new withdrawal request on June 19, 2022. However, after two business days (as per casino rules), I did not receive the funds. Instead, for the second time I was advised by Customer Support to contact Risk Management regarding my issue. I did it on June 23, 2022:</p>
<p>Dear sir/madam,</p>
<p>I was advised by Customer Service to resolve this issue with my withdrawal through your department.</p>
<p>I made a withdrawal on last Sunday, i.e. June 19, 2022. After two business day my funds have not been credited to my e-wallet. I will appreciate your prompt response regarding this issue.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Anatoly B</p>
<p>And to my third time surprise, on June 23, 2022, I received the same copy-paste response from Quatro:</p>
<p>Hello Anatoly,</p>
<p>Thank you for your email.</p>
<p>Unfortunately due to the current regulatory environment, we cannot allow any further activity on your accounts at this time.</p>
<p>Kind Regards,</p>

<p>As you can see, it took me almost 1 month to resolve the problem, but all in vain. Therefore, I am filing a complaint with you. I would like to receive my funds (200 USD) and compensation for moral damages in the amount of 100% of my WD. Please find all documentary evidence attached.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Anatoly B</p>
