    <h1>The Brook Casino Casino Pizza Casino Royale James Bond And Vesper Ameristar Casino Hotel Council Blu</h1>

<p>1X2 Network, a company that has developed many of the market-leading iGaming titles in the industry, has achieved a new major milestone with the company securing a license to operate as a supplier in Michigan, the United States.</p>
<p>This regulatory go-ahead significantly expands 1X2 Network’s reach as it allows it to provide content to licensed operators in the Great Lakes State with the blessing of the Michigan Gaming Control Board.</p>
<p>Commenting on the opportunity, 1X2 Network CEO Kevin Reid said that he was immensely proud of the efforts that have gone into making this a reality. Michigan and the United States represented a significant opportunity for the company that 1X2 Network appreciated.</p>
<p>"We share Michigan’s belief in the sector’s future being in regulation, and we welcome the challenge to strengthen our position in the USA amongst such exciting competition," Reid added.</p>
<p>1X2 Network is coming to the market in strength, bringing titles from a variety of worthwhile and well-established suppliers and game studios, including Iron Dog Studio, Prospect Gaming, AD LUNAM, and others. This means that partner operators and their players will have access to games such as 1 Million Fortunes Megaways, 1 Million Megaways BC, and so much more.</p>
<p>1X2 Network has been gradually growing its North American footprint, having previously signed a content partnership with 888casino in Ontario, Canada. This is just one of the many successes the company has struck over the past several months.</p>
<p>Recently, 1X2 Network joined forces with Hub88, a content platform and aggregator that now benefits from the company’s selection of excellent, player-favorite, and top-performing games. 1X2’s AD LUNAM also recently extended its partnership with QTech Games in order to strengthen its global presence and reach new markets.</p>
<p>In the meantime, 1X2 Network has been working hard outside North America, having strengthened its presence in the iGaming market in the Netherlands with Hollan Casino Online. Michigan is just the latest frontier for the highly-dynamic and successful brand, with licensed operator partnerships to be announced in the coming weeks or months.</p>
