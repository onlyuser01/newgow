    <h1>Cimarron Casino Casinos Albuquerque New Mexico The Commerce Casino Hotel Telegraph Road Commerce Ca</h1>

<p>Yes,I have an addiction to gambling.i have self excluded myself to most casinos ( depending on who is a responsible casino ).</p>
<p>I've tried playing Europe casino as this is my only option when I feel the need to gamble.most of these casinos restrict deposit amounts etc and make it a little difficult to loss a lot of money very quickly.After all for me it's not about the winning really it's about the thrill of winning the bonuses and getting more of them.</p>
<p>I was able to deposit £500 on the first night and a further £1000 on day 2 .</p>
<p>I'm really gutted obviously as I new I would lose this ,I did try to withdraw but there withdraw process keeps your money in there for you to continue playing until,I guess they authorise it .</p>
<p>This was so easy to deposit,they call them selves a responsible casino, just because they've got statements and a few links to advice anyone if they have a problem click here .</p>
<p>This is just not right ,they are allowing me/ us to take advantage of our weaknesses ..they should be making this a lot harder for people with an addiction.</p>
<p>I did complain and requested my €1500 back,but before they even acknowledge this i had the farce of sending my I'd etc to them .</p>
<p>Of course they will refuse, this is why they doby have or make it difficult for people like me ...very sad ..mr</p>
