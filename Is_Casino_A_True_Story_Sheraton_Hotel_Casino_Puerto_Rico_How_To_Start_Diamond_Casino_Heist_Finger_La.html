    <h1>Is Casino A True Story Sheraton Hotel Casino Puerto Rico How To Start Diamond Casino Heist Finger La</h1>

<p>Rocketpot.io is denying to payout my max win (~1600$).</p>
<p>After regularly playing on their site and being able to deposit and withdraw I finally hit max win " (bet size 0.20 game wanted dead 12500x my winning 2500 )</p>
<p>I requested a withdrawal and for the first couple of days nothing moved. So I contacted support, to ask what is going on.</p>
<p>They requested KYC, fair enough. I provided them with the needed documents.</p>
<p>After 5 days I was told on live chat that your KYC is complete and you can take your withdrawal</p>
<p>But I didn't get my withdrawal so I again contact support then they told me some problem is coming from coinspad side everything is fine from your side can you get soon which i have also attached the screenshot</p>
<p>But after a few days these people closed my account and I was asked to do KYC again so i send all documents again.</p>
<p>But this time I was told that your address is not verified.But they didn't accept my invoice which was signed by local authority which had my address proof so I sent permanent address on National ID card they didn't accept that also</p>
<p>But a friend of mine who used to play at the same casino was verified by them on the basis of the same documents, which I also have a proof.</p>
<p>Then people told me the reason for KYC failure is that India has legal 21 plus that's why your KYC failed</p>
<p>And I got a reply on email that your KYC has been failed</p>
<p>Now support is not forwarding my request to talk to the management and is starting to ignore me.</p>
<p>please get me justice</p>
