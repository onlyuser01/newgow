<p>Relax Gaming announced a collaboration with Parimatch to add Relax Gaming’s unique content to the operator’s fanbase. The agreement will see players enjoy content from more than 50 third-party studios.</p>
<p>Relax Gaming Partners with Parimatch</p>
<p>Relax Gaming added another major operator to the company’s roster of iGaming operators that will now benefit from the Powered By Relax and Silver Bullet partnership offers. Relax reached an agreement today to provide the company’s rich content to Parimatch.</p>
<p>The deal will see Parimatch players enjoy a whole new set of unique and diverse games. Some of the now-available titles include Temple Tumble, Snake Arena, and the award-winning Money Train 2.</p>
<p>Players will also get to enjoy amazing content from over 50 third-party studios, including Fantasma Games, ReelPlay, and 4ThePlayer.</p>
<p>Parimatch is a twenty-year veteran of the sports betting business operating across the world, with strong forays in the iGaming space. Both Relax and Parimatch have enjoyed huge success over the years. The present agreement boosts both respective companies’ footprints further.</p>
<p>Daniel Eskola, CCO at Relax Gaming, said: “It’s a delight to announce this deal with Parimatch, a company that shares our values of quality and differentiation.”</p>
<p>Eskola also said that this is yet another move that will help Relax’s expansion goals, and it will also widen the company’s reach in new and existing markets.</p>
<p>Head of gambling products at Parimatch Eugene Saveliev added that his company had moved its focus over the years to become more technologically-oriented. Parimatch wants to widen its horizons into a bigger industry, and this agreement acts as a stepping stone for that goal.</p>
<p>Saveliev praised Relax and the company’s technical excellence. He further explained that Relax’s variety of content is a big highlight of their partnership and that he is positive that there will be more in the future.</p>
<p>Relax Gaming Partners and Awards</p>
<p>Relax Gaming’s Silver Bullet and Powered By Relax programs have widened the company’s list of partners. Last week Relax announced a collaboration with iGaming affiliate powerhouse Slots Temple.</p>
<p>These announcements illustrate how the market has evolved over the years and how the affiliate community is viewed as a vital step for operators to effectively sell their products.</p>
<p>Relax Gaming now has more than 1,500 online casino games to offer its partners. The company recently won several awards like “Casino Content Supplier” at the 2021 EGR Awards in February and “Casino Software Supplier” at last year’s EGR B2B 2020 Awards.</p>
<p>The company has been recognized by the industry for its unique approach and named a true driver of differentiation.</p>
