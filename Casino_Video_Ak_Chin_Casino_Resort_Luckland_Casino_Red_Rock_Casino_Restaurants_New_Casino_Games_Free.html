<p>EPIC Risk Management has added coach and mentor Michael V. Huber to its US operation, just ahead of Problem Gambling Awareness Month.</p>
<p>Raising Awareness and Helping Others</p>
<p>In a statement released Friday, EPIC Risk Management welcomed Michael V. Huber as its Advisory on US Operations. Huber brings his lived experience with problem gambling to the company, enhancing EPIC’s operations right at the start of Problem Gambling Awareness Month (PGAM).</p>
<p>EPIC’s new advisor will share his experience with gambling addiction, a lifelong struggle from teenagehood to 2012. Since his recovery, Huber has been providing mentoring and mental performance coaching services. He declared that his goals align with EPIC’s own, in helping others by preventing problem gambling and therefore the harm it causes. Huber mentioned that the support he received during his recovery inspired him to start a career as a coach and mentor.</p>
<p>“Now, I would like the opportunity to pay it forward in raising awareness regarding the potential risks associated with gambling,” he added. By discussing his own gambling addiction and recovery, Huber will have the opportunity to warn young people of the risks associated with the activity, risks they “may not be fully aware of”.</p>
<p>“Real-Life, Hard-Hitting Stories”</p>
<p>John Millington, EPIC’s VP of US Operations noted that the company’s approach to gambling addiction relies on lived experience as he welcomed Huber to the team. EPIC’s educational and training programs use “real-life, hard-hitting stories of gambling-harm to educate and raise awareness of the significant risk that problem-gambling creates,” Millington said. Huber will mainly discuss his addiction during his college years and will connect it to his work with teenagers and young adults to meaningfully educate them about gambling-related harm.</p>
<p>EPIC wants to inform as many at-risk social groups as possible, Millington said, by raising awareness on the financial and health impacts of risky gambling behaviors.</p>
<p>“To have someone of Michael’s stature, background, and own lived experience bringing this message to life will only enhance the work that we passionately believe saves lives.” John Millington, VP of US Operations at EPIC</p>
<p>EPIC Risk Management has operated in 21 different countries, offering resources to combat problem-gambling by educating people who partake in wagering activities.</p>
