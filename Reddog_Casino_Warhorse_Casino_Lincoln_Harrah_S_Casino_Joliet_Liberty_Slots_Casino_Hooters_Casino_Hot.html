<p>MST’s head of operations and business development said that this agreement is very important to the horseracing sector as a whole</p>
<p>Sports Information Services (SIS) a top multi-channel provider of constant live betting services, has formed a new partnership with Media System Technologies (MST). As per the deal, SIS will distribute the 140th edition of the Italian Gallop Derby to gambling companies in the United Kingdom and Ireland.</p>
<p>Thanks to the deal, retail and digital operators in the two regions will be able, for the first time, to accept fixed-odds bets on the best thoroughbred racing event in Italy. As a result, horseracing enthusiasts in the two regions will get to enjoy all the action.</p>
<p>The Italian Gallop Derby is set to begin on May 21 and will take place on the Capannelle racecourse in Rome. Italy’s top meeting will feature a total of nine races, which will include three Group contests, namely the Italian Gallop Derby, the President of the Republic Grand Prix, and the Carlo D’Alessio Grand Prix. In addition, the Sunday program has three Listed races in store: the Tudini Prize, the Alessandro Perrone Prize and the Mauro Sbarigia Prize.</p>
<p>Thanks to the deal between SIS and MST, more players than ever will get to experience the spectacular races. It follows an agreement between SIS and ISIBET Pro that saw the supplier launch content in Italy.</p>
<p>An Important Step for the Development of Racing</p>
<p>Representatives of the two companies commented on the agreement with Michele Rosi, MST’s head of operations and business development, saying that the distribution of the Derby di Galoppo in the UK and Ireland will help the content reach many major betting brands.</p>
<p>This, according to Rosi, is a major milestone for his company and the horse racing industry as a whole, since the distribution of the Derby Italiano di Gallop is very important for the development of the sector.</p>
<p>We are sure that the high value of the day of racing, enriched by the quality of the HD images, will represent the best advertisement for a relevant market such as the UK and Ireland. This is precisely the image that MST has been exporting internationally since August 2022, together with the offer of Italian racing. Michele Rosi, head of operations and business development, MST</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Conall McSorley, SIS’ head of international horseracing, lauded the Italian Derby as one of the best horseracing events Europe has to offer. He said that his team is delighted to bring the 140th renewal to punters in the UK and Ireland.</p>
<p>With a rich history, the race resonates with racing fans in Italy and globally. We are sure that the increased global audience will enjoy the high-quality action from Italy’s most valuable race meeting, as we continue to expand our racing offering across the world. Conall McSorley, head of international horseracing, SIS</p>
