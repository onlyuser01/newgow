    <h1>Pocono Casino Mirax Casino California Online Casino Casino Hotels In Washington State Resorts Casino</h1>

<p>The world’s leading poker site has added three UFC stars to be part of the new Octagon Chip Campaign.</p>
<p>PokerStars Adds Masvidal, Suarez, and Nunes for Octagon Chip Campaign</p>
<p>PokerStars ambassadors and UFC fighters Jorge Masvidal, Tatiana Suarez and Amanda Nunes will all participate in a new brand challenge. The trio will be joining existing ambassadors Daniel Cormier, Johnny Walker and Bruce Buffer ahead of the upcoming PokerStars and UFC’s Octagon Chip initiative.</p>
<p>Based on the official campaign, PokerStars will have time through January 31, 2020 to participate in a number of UFC-branded poker games and win Gold, Silver and Green Octagon chips, used as a currency to unlock various awards. The Octagon Chip Campaign is available to Canadian players, excluding Quebec, from November 6 through January 31, 2020 and November 6 through January 31, 2020 for the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>One lucky winner will be flown to Las Vegas and given a chance to have a 101-training session with a UFC star. Previously, one Derrick Williams from Sacramento, California, won the inaugural edition of the campaign and is now featured in a TV ad alongside UFC welterweight Jorge Masvidal.</p>
<p>The commercial is airing across the United Kingdom and Canada along with global social media activations. The ad focuses on Williams who had a chance to win the VIP experience and travel to watch the UFC 241: Cormier vs. Miocic 2 fight, and was allowed to serve as an interim UFC President for the match.</p>
<p>PokerStars and the UFC plan to showcase their new campaign at New York’s Madison Square Garden (MSG) during the UFC 244: Masvidal vs Diaz fight. At the same time, Johnny Walker will be facing off Corey Anderson.</p>
<p>PokerStars and UFC’s Strengthening Ties</p>
<p>Presently, PokerStars and UFC run several initiatives together. Back in April, TSG Chief Operating Officer Guy Templar commented on the strengthening ties between the two companies and said this:</p>
<p>This year will see some new great partnerships that will modernize the brand and continue to broaden its appeal. A major example of this is our new brand partnership with the UFC.</p>
<p>You can find a number of UFC-themed Spin &amp; Go’s games along with UFC Knockout Poker, both coming with their unique design. The Stars Group-owned company signed a number of UFC ambassadors back in May, adding Daniel Cormier, Bruce Buffer and Johnny Walker.</p>
<p>The UFC has been pushing its exposure on all fronts. Last year, the organization secured a multi-year deal with ESPN, which will now broadcast UFC fights through 2023.</p>
