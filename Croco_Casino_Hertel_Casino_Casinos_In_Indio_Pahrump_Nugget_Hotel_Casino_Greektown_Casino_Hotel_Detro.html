<p>Last week, Spinomenal inked an important content distribution deal with Groove. Today, the successful iGaming content provider announced the official launch of the first-ever Non-Fungible Token slots tournament. The event began on June 27, courtesy of a partnership with NFT expert Aplica Media. The name of the new project is Royal Sharx and it will host two different slots competitions.</p>
<p>NFT VIP Cards up for Grabs</p>
<p>The pioneer event will reward the first and second ranking players in each of the two competitions with VIP cards based on the NFT technology. The Royal Sharx NFTs will be handed over at the end of the tournament on July 11. The cards will reward specific VIP member benefits to the four lucky winners by immediately declaring their VIP status in all online casinos participating in the project. All casinos interested in joining the unique tournament will need to sign a content partnership deal with Spinomenal.</p>
<p>The NFT tokens are considered the Rolex of the 21st century, so owning a VIP NFT card will definitely give winners a special status in the gaming world online.</p>
<p>How to Join the Royal Sharx NFT Tournaments</p>
<p>Anyone interested in registering one of the two events needs to play one of Spinomenal’s popular slots: Wolf Fang or Kakekkorinrin’s RinRin. Both slots can be accessed on 10cric and Kakekkorinrin platforms. Both brands have been already integrated with the provider. Spinomenal is also prepared to leverage its top-notch proprietary tech advancements to make sure the gaming experience will be a seamless one and that the leaderboard mechanics will work flawlessly during the tournaments.</p>
<p>The company is already a well-established name in the industry known for its incredibly fast speeds, trustworthiness, level of creativity and versatility. The Spinomenal team has created over 100 spectacular HTML5 slots since its official launch in 2014. Players can enjoy between one and three new fresh releases each month. Operators can take advantage of Spinomenal’s aggregation platform that enables access to a massive selection of more than 2,000 casino games from reputable third-party suppliers.</p>
<p>The chief commercial and operation officer of the fast-growing content provider, Nir Ronen, spoke about the company being “at the forefront of online casinos”. He added that the innovative NFT tournament will reflect their “creative philosophy”. Aplica Media’s founder and chief operating officer Asaf Shohat explained the company’s desire to constantly try new partnerships that allow them to express their skills in the NFT arena. He added that the Spinomenal partnership allowed the company to create a “revolutionary NFT tournament” with unique prizes.</p>
<p>Things are moving fast in the NFT-related gaming world. In mid-June, El Salvador announced it would launch Astro Club House, its first NFT club in El Salvador. In May, NFT-betting operator Stakes announced it would receive a massive $5.3 million investment to see its plans come to life.</p>
