<p>The latest edition of the GamblingNews Awards, conducted in collaboration with Casinolytics, has distinguished NoLimit City as the recipient of the Best New Slot</p>
<p>The GamblingNews Awards is based on data provided exclusively by Casinolytics, a company that specializes in tracking the performance of slots, how popular they are, and how well they are received by audiences.</p>
<p>This is how Nolimit City’s Disturbed has become the Best New Slot of May 2023, enjoying a strong uptake with audiences. The silverware was awarded to the company during an in-person meeting between GamblingNews Head of Partnerships Pras Sri and Evolution marketing manager Thami Vilegas.</p>
<p>The game itself is a highly-thematic experience that has leaned heavily on the strong graphical representation of the plot. The slot centres around the clinic of one Dr Daniel Eath, whose practices leave patients “breathless.”</p>
<p>Disturbed is a 5×4-layout slot which features quite a few interesting features and changes to the reel setup during the course of play. The game itself includes a number of additional twists, such as xWays and xSplit, which can lead you to more winning combinations, courtesy of Nolimit signature development style.</p>
<p>The Disturber Symbol will lead to more respins and the Gravestones will trigger the Angel of Death, sending you to the bonus game, Six Feet Under, where you stand to win 54,391x your base bet, for a truly massive payout if you are that lucky.</p>
<p>Disturbed is a little much to unpack at first sight, as it keeps on giving through its many clever mechanics that dovetail together to provide the players with an outstanding experience across the board.</p>
<p>Nolimit City has built a game that is not only visually impactful but also pads the highly-thematic visuals with robust mechanics that keep on giving and adding fun and further incentive for players to try the slot.</p>
<p>Disturbed is fully compatible with a range of devices making it easy to get on and play on the go or from a desktop. The slot features a 96.10% overall return-to-player rate and offers a 32.96% hit chance. Apart from the aforementioned features and levels, there are also Wilds, Enhancer Cells, xNudge, Ramp Access xBet, Pre-op Spins, Annihilation Spins, and more.</p>
<p>To figure out which does what, don’t miss out to try the Disturbed slot. Feature Buy is available in specific jurisdictions.</p>
