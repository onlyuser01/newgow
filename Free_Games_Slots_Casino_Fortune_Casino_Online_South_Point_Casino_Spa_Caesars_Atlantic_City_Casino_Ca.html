<p>Finn’s departure comes during a tumultuous period for the company as it attempts to consolidate its revenue streams and tackle its rising debt. Such a shift in priorities might be one of the contributing factors to Finn’s decision to leave the gaming group. The former VP remarked fondly on her time with 888 but did not disclose her plans.</p>
<p>The Former VP Was Instrumental in 888’s Rapid Expansion</p>
<p>Finn joined 888 in 2015 as a global marketing director, heading the company’s global branding, advertising, media, and partnership initiatives. By then, she had accumulated substantial leadership experience, managing marketing efforts at high-profile companies like SanDisk, Verix, and Telmap. Her industry-spanning knowledge made her a natural fit for 888’s expansion-minded strategy, and she did not disappoint.</p>
<p>Over the next eight years, Finn more than proved her worth, rising to head of Bingo in February 2019. By that point, she had familiarized herself with the gaming market and effectively guided over 50 UK bingo brands with her engagement, marketing, and monetization strategies. She proved capable of bolstering brand recognition and attracting new players.</p>
<p>Finn’s tenure with 888 culminated in August of the same year when she also became VP of Strategic Marketing. Her prowess contributed to all product verticals as she guided the group’s aggressive expansion across new markets. Finn’s numerous successful campaigns earned her much praise in the industry, and her departure marks a significant loss for 888.</p>
<p>Shifting Priorities May Have Been at Blame</p>
<p>The former VP announced her decision to move on via her LinkedIn account, thanking her colleagues for assisting with her vision. Finn received a warm goodbye from the 888 teams, including former CEO Itai Pazner. She did not disclose her plans, preferring to reflect on her time with the company and the team’s accomplishments.</p>
<p>It’s been an amazing journey, and, hand on heart, I enjoyed every minute. Sivan Finn, former 888 VP of Strategic Marketing</p>
<p>Finn’s departure from 888 comes during a tumultuous period for the gaming giant. The group’s 2022 financial results showed strong performance in key verticals but also revealed challenges with rising debt and compliance issues in the UK and Middle East. External economic pressures also dampened profits, raising concerns for the future.</p>
<p>888’s plans to deal with its imminent challenges revolve around developing profitable markets with an increased focus on sustainability. These priorities mark a notable shift from the group’s previous expansionist mindset and could have contributed to Finn’s decision to seek new opportunities. The gaming giant will likely have to fill the vacant position with somebody more in-line with the company’s current objectives.</p>
