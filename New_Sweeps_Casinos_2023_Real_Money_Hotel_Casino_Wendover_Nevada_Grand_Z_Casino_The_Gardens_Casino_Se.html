<p>The digital sports entertainment and gaming company, DraftKings, announced a new collaboration with Deadfellaz, the global NFT ecosystem. The first-of-its-kind collaboration will see the launch of new NFT player cards.</p>
<p>DraftKings and Deadfellaz Team Up for NFT Card Collection</p>
<p>Under the terms of the new collaboration announced on Thursday, 13 professional football players will be transformed into NFT player cards. The release of the cards is expected via DraftKings Marketplace on October 25, just ahead of the Halloween weekend. According to DraftKings, the new collectible cards can be used by players in Reignmakers Football contests, the company’s leading NFT-based fantasy sports game. Online customers that purchase such NFT player cards can then use them to build a team for fantasy sports games.</p>
<p>Professional players Jalen Hurts, Nick Chubb, Kyler Murray, Alvin Kamara, Deebo Samuel and Matthew Stafford will be transformed into Deadfellaz under the terms of the recent collaboration. This will be the initial list of players that will be transformed into NFT player cards. However, DraftKings and Deadfellaz vowed that additional professional sports players will join that list soon.</p>
<p>But that’s not all. The recent collaboration will also “feature first-of-its-kind utility, including access to gated Deadfellaz-themed contests and exclusive NFT prizing,” DraftKings explained. Players that collect the new, limited-edition NFT player cards will have the chance to win a share of $1 million in prizes, via different weekly Reignmakers Football contests.</p>
<p>The NFT Player Card Collection Will Deliver Unique Experiences</p>
<p>Betty &amp; Psych, the co-founders of Deadfellaz, revealed that the company is excited to join forces with DraftKings for the new NFT player card collection. The duo added: “We love building bridges from the Web3 space into other communities like fantasy sports fans.” Last but not least, the co-founders of Deadfellaz acknowledged that the new collaboration will deliver the value and innovation of Web3 to the growing fantasy sports industry.</p>
<p>“Deadfellaz have established themselves as one of the most culturally relevant and impactful NFT projects in Web3 to date.“ Matt Kalish, co-founder and president at DraftKings North America</p>
<p>Matt Kalish, the co-founder and president of DraftKings North America, added that Deadfellaz currently has some of the most popular NFT projects within Web3. He pointed out that the first-of-its-kind collaboration will deliver unrivaled player experiences via Reignmakers Football contests. In conclusion, Kalish said that the new launch of the new NFT player card collection comes just in time for the Halloween weekend.</p>
