<p>Bay Mills Resort &amp; Casino (BMRC), a Michigan-based waterfront casino, announced that it plans to launch an expansion project worth $65 million next spring. The new project will generate new employment and revenue opportunities for citizens in Michigan and will also provide new amenities and space for its visitors.</p>
<p>New Amenities for Guests and Staff</p>
<p>The planned three-story waterfront resort will have 134 additional rooms with balconies. The project also includes a deli, a pool with a splash pad, a spa with massage therapy rooms, a nail salon, hot tubs, an arcade, a fitness center, a storefront, and a conference space as well. The staff will have an employee break room with a facelift, additional space and new facilities to relax and enjoy. The exterior project includes many amenities such as new fishing piers, gazebos, gardens, marina upgrades as well as outdoor patios.</p>
<p>Whitney Gravelle, president of Bay Mills Indian Community (BMIC), stated that BMIC had been a leader in Indian Country. She added that with this expansion project, BMIC would continue to grow and would become a top destination in the Upper Peninsula. Gravelle expressed her pride with the team and the tribal nation as well for this accomplishment.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Richard LeBlanc, general manager at BMRC, commented that BMRC is a preferred and loved destination for visitors. He also stated that with this $65 million expansion project, BMRC would meet better the needs of its guests and would offer them a “one-of-a-kind experience on Lake Superior.”</p>
<p>BMIC will launch the bidding for the expansion project this winter and plans to break ground next spring, and complete the new waterfront resort by the end of 2023. DSGW Architects is the architect for the expansion project.</p>
<p>Partnership between BMRC and DraftKings</p>
<p>In June 2022, BMRC entered into a partnership agreement with the betting company DraftKings for the opening of a temporary retail sportsbook in BMRC in October 2022. The DraftKings mobile and online sportsbook will offer sports betting, live sporting events, and game-play.</p>
<p>BMRC was first opened in 1995 and employs more than 200 people. It has over 600 slot machines, 143 hotel rooms, several restaurants, 8 table games, a golf course, a casino gift shop, 124 RV sites, and a championship 18-hole golf course.</p>
<p>BMRC is owned by BMIC and is located in the Upper Peninsula on picturesque Lakeshore Drive in Brimley, Michigan. BMRC borders the Hiawatha National Forest and is situated in close proximity to Pt. Iroquois Lighthouse, Тahquamenon Falls, and Soo Locks as well as other beaches, and snowmobiling trails.</p>
