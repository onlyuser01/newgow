<p>Live! Casino &amp; Hotel Philadelphia has launched Giant Jackpots, the first joint property progressive jackpot in the state together with its sister property in Pittsburg</p>
<p>The venue that was voted Best Casino and Best Overall Dining in Pennsylvania by Casino Player Magazine has announced the launch of a pioneer slots program dedicated to Live! Rewards card members.</p>
<p>The Giant Jackpots program that will be officially launched on April 28 will also include the sister casino in Pittsburgh as part of the first-ever joint property progressive jackpot program in the Commonwealth to be provided by a gaming facility.</p>
<p>Guaranteed Jackpots up to $100,000</p>
<p>The mystery progressive slots program will run guaranteed jackpots starting at $50,000 and going all the way up to $100,000. The progressive growth will be triggered every time a guest visits Live! Casino in Philadelphia or Pittsburgh and spins any of the eligible 2,750 slot machines at the respective facilities.</p>
<p>To be eligible for the big win, guests will need to also possess Live! Rewards Cards and make sure to insert them in the slot machines prior to playing. The program does not include electronic table games and video poker machines.</p>
<p>The progressive jackpot will continue to grow until a player in Philadelphia or Pittsburgh will eventually hit it. The jackpot is guaranteed to hit before the Giant Jackpot will reach the $100,000 mark.</p>
<p>As soon as the massive prize will be awarded to a lucky player, the Giant Jackpot at each of the two gambling facilities will go back to $50,000 and the process will start all over again.</p>
