<p>Circa Sports, one of the fastest-growing sportsbook operators in the US, has made an agreement with Full House Resorts and is set to enter the Illinois sports wagering market. In a press release, Full House noted that Circa will operate one of its temporary venues, set to be opened in 2022.</p>
<p>Illinois Is the Fourth State Where Circa Breaks Ground</p>
<p>Before making moves to enter the Illinois mobile sports betting market, Circa was active in Nevada, Iowa, and Colorado. The initial term of the agreement with Full House is 8 years and Circa will have the right to sign two extensions, 4 years each.</p>
<p>The temporary venue where Circa will offer its services is The Temporary by American Place, where a retail sportsbook will also be available. A statement issued by Circa elaborated that The Temporary will have digital boards with real-time odds, 36 televisions, physical ticket windows, as well as a special betting area with physical kiosks.</p>
<p>Derek Stevens, the founder, and CEO of Circa, also shared a few words on the partnership with Full House. He stated that Circa is excited to provide Illinois with its market-leading solutions. Stevens added that the company has developed a great relationship with bettors from the Midwest and to bring its product to Illinois is a “major milestone.”</p>
<p>Out of all the states where Circa is operating, Illinois is set to be the biggest one. Additionally, Illinois is considered one of the fastest-growing markets for the sports betting industry in the US.</p>
<p>Full House Revealed That It Received the Green Light for Its Temporary Casino in Its Q1 Report</p>
<p>Full House released its Q1 results yesterday (May 9, 2022) and in the report, it announced that it broke ground on a temporary casino, located in Waukegan. The permanent project, on the other hand, will feature around 1,600 slots, a modern and unique sportsbook, 20 villas, 100 table games, a variety of restaurants and bars, as well as a live entertainment venue.</p>
<p>Analysts are very optimistic about the project as they think that earnings before EBITDA can be between $38 million and $50 million. While speaking about The American Place, Stevens noted that the venue has been “an excellent partner” for the launch of Circa’s temporary sportsbook.</p>
<p>Stevens noted that this represents the company’s first time introducing a physical sportsbook in a new state and that Circa is happy to have Full House by its side for this project.</p>
<p>A statement by Full House noted that Circa will pay a $5 million market access fee in May and will additionally receive $5 million on an annual basis once Circa launches its mobile sportsbook in Illinois.</p>
