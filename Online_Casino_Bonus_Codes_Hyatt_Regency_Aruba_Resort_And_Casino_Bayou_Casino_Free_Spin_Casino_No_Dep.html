<p>Offering a myriad of innovative gaming solutions powered by design, data, and knowledge, Swintt is a powerful developer that caters to iGaming sustainability.

<p>Soar Above the Skies With the American Eagle</p>
<p>The new slot has a relatively simple design with a North American style mostly represented by the image of an American Eagle. The backdrop consists of tall, rolling mountains and a clear blue sky. The game also features a series of classic slot machine symbols including fruits like lemons and plumbs, along with bells, 7s, and BAR symbols. The simplicity of the game also comes from its small number of reels and pay lines. However, the talented Swintt team decided to add a series of special game features and mechanisms for added excitement and gameplay diversity.</p>
<p>The game has expanding wilds ready to be discovered by players and used to trigger respins. This happens when a minimum of one reel gets filled with wild symbols, while a different one is covered with identical symbols. During the respin, two of the reels turn into fixed reels, while the third one starts to respin once again. When the third reel gets covered with the right symbols, the game triggers the bonus wheel with multipliers. Spinning this reel and waiting for it to spot means finding out which multiplier will be added to the final winnings.</p>
<p>The Win Eagle symbol can be used as a substitute wild to fill up a winning pay line. It can also be expanded to further fill an entire reel once it lands.</p>
<p>MAXI Jackpots</p>
<p>Players can also access MAXI jackpots that they can win when engaging the Wheel of Fortune bonus. To do this, players must completely fill the game board with just one symbol in the base game. Next, players are carried to a fresh screen where they can spin the special prize wheel.</p>
<p>Players can also activate free respins when six out of nine reel spaces display matching icons. Upon reaching the Wheel of Fortune, players are asked to swipe or click and drag to get the wheel to spin. The pointer will start to skim past the colorful segments that are capable of multiplying their present win by up to 5x. When the pointer lands on the MAXI-marked space, players win a local jackpot, collecting the top prize consisting of 800x the stake.</p>
<p>Swintt’s chief commercial officer David Mann spoke about the provider’s Premium releases that “proved incredibly popular in markets where players are used to classic land-based slots” while mentioning the added innovations addressing the needs of modern slot fans. Mann described the fresh Win Eagle release as a game that “delivers the best of both worlds”.</p>
<p>At the beginning of July, Swintt released Four the Win Wild, a slot with 81 ways to win. During the same month, the company hired Domenico Vacchiano as its new chief architect.</p>
