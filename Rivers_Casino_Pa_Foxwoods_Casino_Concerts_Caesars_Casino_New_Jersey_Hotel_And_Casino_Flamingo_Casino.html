<p>Evolution has launched its latest Live Casino product with Craps now available to customers in Pennsylvania. This move marks the latest expansion for the company in the fast-developing iGaming market in North America and follows the launch of a fourth live casino studio for the company. The new studio is now operating out of Connecticut.</p>
<p>Live Craps is debuting in Pennsylvania, but the goal here is to soon introduce it to other states of strategic significance, including New Jersey and Michigan which currently boast the biggest iGaming footprints in the United States.</p>
<p>Moving forward, the company can expand with Live Craps even further. The game is made simple enough for new players who will find that Evolution’s title comes with a tutorial that will quickly teach them about the game’s bet types, table etiquette, and the general flow of the gameplay.</p>
<p>Live Craps by Evolution is streamed from a highly polished studio environment that is focused on providing customers with a state-of-the-art streaming experience, freely rotating HD cameras that enable players to quickly change vantage points and immerse themselves in the depth of the experience.</p>
<p>The product was first debuted in Europe and was part of Evolution’s effort in 2020 to step up its efforts in creating and delivering new iGaming experiences. Live Craps has been a success story ever since, which has emboldened the company enough to release the product in the United States.</p>
<p>Jeff Millar, the company’s Commercial Director for North America, said this version of the game was also the first Live Craps product Evolution created ever, and it was a "landmark" moment for the company, allowing it to expand into other, more sophisticated games and make the gameplay feasible in a Live Casino setting.</p>
<p>Millar remained optimistic about the reception that the game can expect in the United States. "The game itself is going to thrill Craps enthusiasts throughout the US and is sure to attract some new fans," he added saying that the company is looking forward to seeing what player engagement with the product is.</p>
<p>Evolution has worked hard over the past several years to grow its footprint considerably. Apart from expanding throughout the North American market, the company has been able to secure several important acquisitions, buying out NetEnt and its studio Red Tiger Gaming, along with NoLimitCity most recently.</p>
<p>These acquisitions allowed the company to also expand in the slot vertical. Similarly, Evolution acquired Ezugi, a live casino gaming specialist which now operates under the company’s umbrella but still retains its original look, direction, and signature style.</p>
