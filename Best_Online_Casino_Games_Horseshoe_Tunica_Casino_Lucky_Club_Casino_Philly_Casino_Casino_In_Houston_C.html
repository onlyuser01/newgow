<p>Dear x8xytmvkq4,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. I have checked the terms and conditions, and this is what I found:</p>
<p>„The Company does not accept third party payments. You must make deposits only from a bank account, bank cards, e-wallets or other payment methods that are registered in your own name. If we determine during the security checks that you have violated this condition, your winnings will be confiscated and the original deposit will be returned to the owner of the payment account. The Company is not responsible for the lost funds deposited from third party accounts."</p>
<p>Furthermore, please check our Fair Gambling Codex for Players https://casino.guru/fair-gambling-codex-for-players:</p>
<p>"Payments</p>
<p>For deposits and withdrawals, you should only use bank accounts and credit cards held in your own name. If you don't do this, you might get into trouble when trying to make a withdrawal. This rule is mostly in place to prevent credit card misuse and also because of international anti-money-laundering regulations."</p>
<p>Please understand that this rule has been breached. Some exceptions might be allowed by casinos when depositing or withdrawing funds using a joint card or this possibility is communicated beforehand. Technically it is very difficult to check who’s the owner of the payment method at the depositing stage. This can be checked only during account verification, which is usually done when a withdrawal is requested. Therefore, it is a player’s responsibility to use allowed payment methods only.</p>
<p>If you’re not able to prove that you are a legitimate owner of the payment method and you haven’t received approval from the casino allowing you to use a third-party payment method, I’m afraid there’s not much we can do for you.</p>
<p>Thank you very much in advance for your reply and understanding.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Kristina</p>
