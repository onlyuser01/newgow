<p>Leading iGaming developer Microgaming has signed up a partnership with Svenska Spel Sport &amp; Casino, a state-owned gaming operator in Sweden. As a result, Microgaming’s portfolio of online casino games is now officially available to Svenska players.</p>
<p>According to the official press release, Microgaming considers Sweden as one of the largest and most important gaming markets in Europe, and the latest move signals the company’s determination to continue developing itself in some of the most challenging and strictest gaming markets.</p>
<p>Svenska Spel Sport &amp; Casino is now live with our diverse portfolio of games, including legendary slots, blockbuster branded titles, and original content from a roster of independent studios. https://t.co/pLLQplIJMk#Microgaming #SvenskaSpel #Sweden #content #aggregator pic.twitter.com/iZEUrKkLAM — Microgaming (@Microgaming) February 13, 2020</p>
<p>That comes at a time when the industry in the United Kingdom is coming under review with a proposed £2 betting limit on all online slots. Svenska Spel, though, has been able to establish itself in the Swedish market and weather all regulatory and competition challenges.</p>
<p>As a result, the Visby-headquartered company is now one of the market leaders offering a diverse gaming portfolio.</p>
<p>Bracing for the Online Market</p>
<p>Even though Svenska Spel faced difficulties at first, the company moved onto becoming an online provider of gaming content in January 2019, with the launch of the company’s iGaming division, Svenska Spel Sport &amp; Casino.</p>
<p>While results have declined in the third quarter of 2019, Svenska Spel still remains dedicated to its mission of upholding quality gaming solutions. Now, the company has had a chance to integrate the full portfolio of Microgaming proprietary titles on its own platform, offering gamers a world-class gaming experience.</p>
<p>The available titles feature not only some of the most iconic slots, but also some of the highest paying ones with fantastic picks such as Agent Jane Blonde Returns, Blood Suckers, Game of Thrones, Lara Croft Temples and Tombs, and others.</p>
<p>Commenting on what has been achieved, Chief Operating Officer at Microgaming Andrew Clucas had this to say:</p>
<p>“Svenska Spel Sport &amp; Casino is a tremendous addition to our sizeable customer base in this key strategic market. We are pleased to welcome them to the Microgaming family and look forward to working with them closely after a successful integration.”</p>
<p>Describing the Swedish deal as a “tremendous addition” to its portfolio is accurate as, for all the challenges Sweden has to offer, it is a test for any company whether it can operate in a fully regulated market.</p>
<p>So far, the Nordic markets, despite their somewhat belated launch in Denmark and Sweden, have been the safest places where players can enjoy iGaming products.</p>
<p>Responding to the news positively, Jonas Nygren, VP casino of Svenska Spel Sport &amp; Casino, said that the addition of Microgaming products will immeasurably “enhance the overall gameplay experience for our players.”</p>
<p>While Svenska Spel is still struggling to boost its profit margin, as operating profit had fallen 36% in the final three months of 2019, there are upsides, too.</p>
<p>However, Svenska Spel CEO Patrik Hofbauer recently said that despite the difficulties, Svenska Spel was developing a business model that would guarantee it sustainability as well as sound revenue.</p>
<p>With the addition of Microgaming as a content partner, this is not too difficult to imagine.</p>
