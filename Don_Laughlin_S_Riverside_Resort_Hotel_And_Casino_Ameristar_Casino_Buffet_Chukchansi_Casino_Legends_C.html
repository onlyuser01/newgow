<p>Lord Venom review</p>
<p>Lord Venom is a snake and jungle-themed slot from Backseat Gaming.</p>
<p>The game has been released on Hacksaw Gamingâ€™s Open RSG platform. There is no discernible story available for the slot, with the action just being centred around the titular Lord Venom, a giant cobra.</p>
<p>Big win in the Free Spins bonus round</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>Lord Venom may not have been developed by Hacksaw Gaming, but it has a very similar layout and style to their games. The slot is set in the middle of a jungle, sticking with a static, misty green background that does a good job of creating a tense atmosphere.</p>
<p>The symbols on the reels feature a selection of wild jungle animals, all of which have been well-designed. The issue with the design of the game is not with its graphics or theme but rather the slight lack of originality, with the game doing very little to stand out from similar titles.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Lord Venom uses a slightly larger than normal 5x5 payment grid. Despite the enhanced grid size, the game only serves up 19 active paylines on each spin.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>The control panel under the reels allows you to adjust the stake between each spin and use the autospin option. There is also a Buy Bonus feature that you can use to buy your way into the bonus features.</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Lord Venom bonus features keep things simple, with a mystery symbol style bonus and a free spins round with some multiplier features.</p>
<p>Jungle Bush symbols turn into one randomly selected symbol after the spin</p>
<p>The Jungle Bush symbols can land on any spin. These are mystery symbols that will reveal themselves to be a paying symbol. All Jungle Bush symbols will be revealed to be matching and can help trigger winning combinations.</p>
<p>If you land three or more Scatter symbols in the round, the Free Spins round is triggered. Three, four, or five Scatters rewards 12, 14, or 16 free spins, respectively. During the round, Jungle Bush symbols could reveal a Golden Egg. These will display a multiplier that could be x1, x10, x25, x50, x100, or x200. This is then added to a global multiplier that applies to wins during the spins.</p>
<p>Egg symbols turn into the various multipliers</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>A disappointing RTP lets down Lord Venom. The slot comes in at 92.35%, which is much lower than average and goes against our slot strategy guide. This is unfortunate because other elements of the slot are strong. The volatility is rated 5/5, which is high, and the maximum win is 15,000x your stake.</p>
<p>Full paytable for the Lord Venom slot machine</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Lord Venom keeps things basic, but it has plenty to offer. Unfortunately, a seriously low RTP means we can not recommend it. This is a shame because the bonus rounds play nicely, and the design, while generic, is pleasing enough to the eye.</p>
