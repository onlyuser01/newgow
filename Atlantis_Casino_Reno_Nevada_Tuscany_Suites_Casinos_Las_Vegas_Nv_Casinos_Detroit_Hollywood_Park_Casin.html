<p>The British service attributed the high number of registrants to the famous Cheltenham Festival, which took place in mid-March</p>
<p>GAMSTOP, a free self-exclusion service, is celebrating its anniversary this April. However, there is another reason for celebration as the scheme reported March was its most successful month yet.</p>
<p>According to GAMSTOP, the program welcomed 8,504 new people this March, the highest monthly number of self-excluded gamblers it has ever recorded. This figure notably marks a 24% year-on-year increase, attesting to the growth of the service.</p>
<p>The British service attributed the high number of registrants to the famous Cheltenham Festival horse racing event, which took place in mid-March. The biggest days for registrations, GAMSTOP noted, came right after the festival.</p>
<p>GAMSTOP was launched in April 2018. Two years later, the program was officialized as a must for all legal operators in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>GAMSTOP has so far helped over 365,000 people get their gambling habits under control. People who opt to use the self-exclusion service can exclude themselves from gambling for six months, a year, or five years. The majority of registered customers (330,000) are still excluded from playing.</p>
<p>GAMSTOP Continues to Help People Overcome Addiction</p>
<p>The self-exclusion service’s chief executive officer, Fiona Palmer, addressed the recent data, saying that she is proud of the impact GAMSTOP has had on harm.</p>
<p>The record monthly registrations show that we cannot underestimate the demand for a scheme such as GAMSTOP. It is extremely important that we continue to raise awareness to make sure that anyone who needs us knows about us. Fiona Palmer, CEO, GAMSTOP</p>
<p>Palmer added that GAMSTOP will continue using customer feedback to improve its programs.</p>
<p>Jack Scott, a GAMSTOP registrant, spoke about the scheme, praising it for changing his life. He noted that he had struggled with iGaming addiction for years and would oftentimes lose “terrifying amounts of money, often money he didn’t have.”</p>
<p>Luckily, Scott was able to get his life under control thanks to GAMSTOP. Now, he is able to commit himself to his real passion, which is ultrarunning – something he would have been unable to do without GAMSTOP.</p>
<p>I encourage anyone who thinks that they might be suffering from a gambling-related issue to research GAMSTOP or to take advantage of the TalkBanStop partnership, which combines self-exclusion with device blocking software, bank blocks and getting the support you might need through Gamcare. Jack Scott, GAMSTOP user</p>
<p>The number of GAMSTOP registrants has been growing throughout 2022, as attested by a report the service shared earlier this year. In other news, a recent survey commissioned by GamCare, a service that works alongside GAMSTOP and Gamban to curb problem gambling rates, proved that layering self-exclusion tools can be very effective in keeping addiction at bay.</p>
