<p>St. Louis City is the only MLS team with a 4-0-0 record in the 2023 season, but how long can the new franchise keep on winning? Can Real Salt Lake stop them on Saturday, March 25, at Rio Tinto Stadium in Sandy, Utah</p>
<p>Even though St. Louis City players are in top form since the start of the 2023 MLS season, oddsmakers think it’s Real Salt Lake that’s more likely to win on Saturday. One reason is that these guys are famously good in Utah.</p>

<p>Home Turf Really Means a Lot to Real Salt Lake</p>
<p>Last year, Real Salt Lake went 12-11-11 in the regular season. At home, their record was 9-5-3, meaning that more than two-thirds of the points they collected in 2022, they collected at Rio Tinto Stadium.</p>
<p>This season, they’re 1-0-2, with their only win happening at home. Their two losses happened one on the road and one in Utah. The defeat at home was in their most recent game, which saw them lose 2-1 to Austin FC.</p>
<p>What happened there was that they were unable to break the opposition’s defensive wall. They had 17 goal attempts that day, but just one of those produced a goal. Will they struggle to score this coming Saturday as well? We think so and the main reason is that St. Louis City are fantastic at the back.</p>
<p>St. Louis City Showing No Signs of Slowing Down</p>
<p>The MLS newcomers have all wins thus far in the 2023 season, with a score differential of 11-4. They’ve been brilliant in the offense, with seven different players scoring at least a goal. When it comes to their defense, their goalie Roman Burki hasn’t had too much work to do.</p>
<p>Excluding their first-ever MLS game which saw them beat Austin FC 3-2, the former Dortmund goalkeeper hasn’t had the need to intervene more than just four times per game. It’s because his teammates did a great job in keeping the opposition away from him in all of those matches.</p>
<p>Real Salt Lake vs St. Louis City Prediction</p>
<p>Real Salt Lake might be great at home, but judging by what we’ve seen so far from St. Louis City, these guys are superb on the road. They look strong in every aspect of the game, which is why we do think they’re going to prolong their winning run for at least one more week.</p>
<p>Pick: St. Louis City to win</p>
