<p>FanDuel Group announced today it entered into a multi-year partnership with the Detroit Pistons to become the official sports betting partner of the franchise from the National Basketball Association (NBA).</p>
<p>FanDuel Sportsbook Linked to Pistons’ Fans</p>
<p>Under the terms of the deal, FanDuel will gain access to official marks and logos of the Pistons, as well as a mix of other marketing assets such as in-arena signage, digital and TV advertising and presence to drive fans of the professional basketball outfit to its sports betting offerings.</p>
<p>“The Pistons are a progressive and forward-thinking franchise committed to its fans, and we see an incredibly valuable partnership opportunity as we connect our retail Sportsbook experience with Pistons game action in the arena.” Mike Raffensperger, Chief Marketing Officer, FanDuel</p>
<p>The Detroit Pistons are also set to partner with MotorCity Casino Hotel in downtown Detroit where Flutter Entertainment’s daily fantasy sports (DFS) and sports betting brand opened a retail sportsbook in March, and where both FanDuel and MotorCity will offer to fans of the Pistons game day experiences.</p>
<p>“This new relationship will create unique approaches for us to reach Pistons fans. With the FanDuel Sportsbook at MotorCity Casino and mobile gaming offerings on the FanDuel Sportsbook app, we will together offer engaging experiences both inside and outside the arena while giving fans access to unique betting promotions and content.” Mike Raffensperger, Chief Marketing Officer, FanDuel</p>
<p>FanDuel Missed on DFS Exclusivity</p>
<p>FanDuel’s announcement for the new partnership with the Pistons came after news that its biggest rival DraftKings entered into a partnership deal with the NBA franchise from Detroit, to make the Boston-based operator the exclusive Official Daily Fantasy Sports Partner, as well as Official Sports Betting and iGaming Partner for the professional basketball team.</p>
<p>“We appreciate the partnership-minded and collaborative approach that both FanDuel and DraftKings brought to the table. We look forward to utilizing our platform to help each grow their presence within and connectivity to the Pistons and greater Detroit Metro communities.” Mike Zavodsky, Chief Business Officer, Detroit Pistons</p>
<p>The partnership with the Pistons comes just in time for FanDuel’s planned sports betting launch in Michigan, as the state is finalizing its sports betting rules and official start of the market is expected for late December or early 2021.</p>
<p>The deal with the Detroit Pistons follows in the footsteps of a similar agreement FanDuel signed at the beginning of the month with the NBA franchise from Tennessee the Memphis Grizzlies. Under the agreement with the Grizzlies, FanDuel became their exclusive DFS partner and an official sports betting partner. The deal also was the first for the sportsbook operator with a franchise from the NBA.</p>
