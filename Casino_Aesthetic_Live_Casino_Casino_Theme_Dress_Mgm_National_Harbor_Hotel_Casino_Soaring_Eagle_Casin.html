<p>Erling Haaland is coming back to Westfalen, the biggest soccer stadium in Germany. This time, he’s not wearing the yellow shirt of Borussia Dortmund. Instead, we’ll see him in the Manchester City jersey.</p>
<p>Or will we? Knowing that Manchester City has already booked the ticket to the next phase of the 2022-23 Champions League, Pep Guardiola might decide to keep his top goalscorer off the pitch, as well as all the other key players.</p>
<p>If the coach decides to do that, will that make Dortmund’s job easier? It sure will, but this doesn’t mean that a win is guaranteed for the German powerhouse. In fact, bookmakers think Dortmund will suffer its second UCL loss of the season this coming Tuesday.</p>

<p>81,000 Fans to Come to Borussia Dortmund’s Stadium</p>
<p>Die Westfalenstadion is going to be packed on Tuesday, with more than 81,000 fans coming to watch the Borussia Dortmund vs Manchester City. Most of them will be rooting for the home team, including the fans from the Yellow Wall, who are famous for the amazing support they provide to Dortmund’s players in big matches like this one.</p>
<p>This explains why Borussia Dortmund is very tough to beat at home. This team is without a loss in Dortmund since the summer, with three wins and two draws in the previous five home games.</p>
<p>One of those draws happened against Bayern Munich in Der Klassiker, in which Dortmund’s striker Anthony Modeste made it 2-2 in the 5th minute of the stoppage time.</p>
<p>Manchester City’s Main Focus is the EPL, Not the UCL</p>
<p>After securing a spot in the knockout stage of the UEFA Champions League, the Citizens don’t have to worry about this competition for a couple of months. Instead, they can focus on the Premier League, where they’re trailing behind Arsenal.</p>
<p>Because of this, their coach Pep Guardiola might decide to rest a couple of his key men in Tuesday’s game. One of those is Erling Haaland, the former player of Borussia Dortmund. With him on the bench (or playing for a brief period of time), the English team might not be as lethal as with him on the pitch. Still, this doesn’t mean that they’re not going to pose a serious threat to Dortmund’s goal.</p>
<p>Borussia Dortmund vs Manchester City Prediction</p>
<p>This is going to be a real barnburner, with plenty of action on both ends. We’re probably going to see plenty of goals too, but which team will score more? We think neither. Instead, we think this might be a very high-scoring tie.</p>
<p>Picks: Draw and over 3.5 goals</p>
