<p>The leading provider of software for sports betting and online gambling operators, Altenar, announced a new deal, allowing it to further expand the reach of its innovative solutions. Earlier this week, the company revealed it joined forces with SpinBet. Under the terms of the freshly minted collaboration, Altenar agreed to supercharge the operator's horse racing offering in New Zealand.</p>
<p>The new deal sees the leading software provider deliver its services for SpinBet, strengthening its offering and position within the regulated gambling market in the country. Thanks to the new partnership, Altenar's selection of live and pre-match odds for horse racing now powers SpinBet's offering.</p>
<p>In addition to strengthening its horse racing offering, the operator currently provides markets for soccer, volleyball and baseball. Moreover, SpinBet has a standalone online casino platform called SpinBit, where customers can engage in live games as well as classic table games.</p>
<p>Niall Thomas, SpinBet's Co-Founder, was thrilled about the newly inked partnership with the leading iGaming and betting software provider. In a statement, he explained: "To collaborate with Altenar, an award-winning sportsbook with a revered reputation globally, is a massive boost for us as we look to extend our offering outside of New Zealand."</p>
<p>Finally, Thomas pointed out: "This partnership showcases SpinBet’s determination to prove itself as a leading online operator within New Zealand and with Altenar’s world-leading product, we believe we can make a name for ourselves across Asia and the Americas in the next few years."</p>
<p>Charlie Williams, Altenar's Commercial Director, shared the excitement of SpinBet's Co-Founder. "We are thrilled to enter the New Zealand market for the first time through this partnership with SpinBet, one of the region’s most established operators," he explained. Last but not least, Williams pointed out: "New Zealand is a new and exciting market for us, so we are eager to boost Altenar’s outreach in this territory, before looking to extend the SpinBet partnership further in the coming months."</p>
<p>Details regarding the partnership with SpinBet come after recently, Altenar confirmed it boosted its sports betting offering. This was achieved thanks to a partnership with WSF Odds, a provider of soccer odds. As a result of the deal, Altenar gained access to the provider's goal scorer odds, among other soccer-related tools and props.</p>
<p>The latest deal complements Altenar's ongoing expansion. Given that the software provider establishes its presence in the region, powered by the new deal, it anticipates expanding its collaboration with SpinBet into more markets, including India, Latin America, as well as North America soon.</p>
