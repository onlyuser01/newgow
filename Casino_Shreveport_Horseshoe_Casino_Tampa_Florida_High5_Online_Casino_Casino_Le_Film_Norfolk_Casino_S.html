    <h1>Casino Shreveport Horseshoe Casino Tampa Florida High5 Online Casino Casino Le Film Norfolk Casino S</h1>

<p>Stakelogic has appointed Edgars Isajevs as its new head of live casino in a strategic move aimed at preserving its position as a leader</p>
<p>The provider of top-tier casino games that are changing how players play, Stakelogic, has taken a new step toward strengthening its position as a leader in the online gaming world while proving its uninterrupted plans to offer cutting-edge, unifying experiences.</p>
<p>Namely, the company that is all about “innovation and revolutionizing the online gaming industry” has announced its Live Casino department will be managed by Edgars Isajevs.</p>
<p>Isajevs, “Poised” to Harness His Decade-Old Experience</p>
<p>The new head of live casino joins Stakelogic after accumulating more than 10 years of experience “in management, process improvement and team building in the iGaming industry” working in other live casino realms where he took important positions.</p>
<p>Namely, Isajevs, who describes himself as “curious and tenacious,” worked with a number of industry giants with names like Winfinity, Evolution, and Pragmatic on the list.</p>
<p>Isajevs was head of operations at Pragmatic and later became Winfinity’s chief operations officer. Both positions helped him get a deeper understanding of technology and live casino operations.</p>
<p>He was also Evolution Gaming’s operations manager between April 2018 and September 2020, a position in which he managed the overall operations and performance while maintaining service excellence and making sure the company complied with all policies and procedures.</p>
<p>Before that, he was also Evolution’s operations team lead between January 2016 and April 2018.</p>
<p>“The Perfect Executive”</p>
<p>Determined to bring his wealth of expertise to help Stakelogic Live’s live casino offerings grow and reach “unprecedented heights in terms of technology and organizational efficiency,” Isajevs expressed his excitement to begin working with Stakelogic Live which he called “the most innovative game supplier in the industry.” He particularly praised their “revolutionary ideas” regarding the way live casino offerings can be innovated.</p>
<p>The company’s chief executive officer, Stephan van den Oetelaar, explained that he only needed a 10-minute talk with Isajevs to understand that “he would be perfect to lead Stakelogic Live.”</p>
<p>The CEO spoke about his passion for the gaming world mixed with his deep knowledge of live casino operations which make him the ideal executive who can help strengthen their team of managers.</p>
<p>Previously, the head of live casino position belonged to Dejan Loncar for around five months. Loncar filled the role of the outgoing head of live casino, Richard Walker.</p>
<p>The winner of Best Rising Star in Gaming, Best Casino Provider, and Retro-Style Game awards in 2022 confirmed the launch of a live casino bonus tool last September.</p>
<p>Last August, Stakelogic announced it would continue its expansion via a new agreement inked with Starcasino for the gaming market in Belgium.</p>
