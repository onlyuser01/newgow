<p>Play’n Go has definitely not shied away from stating its ambitions for the North American market loudly and clearly. In our conversation with Stuart Trigwell, Head of Sales Western Europe at Play’n Go, we learned a lot about the company’s current ambitions in the United States.</p>
<p>Now, Play’n Go and Trigwell are delivering on their promise to conquer the region with the company announcing that it is launching in New Jersey, a second state for the supplier. Play’n Go has acquired a Casino Service Industry Enterprise by the Division of Gaming Enforcement, the local regulatory authority that is in charge of issuing licenses.</p>
<p>As a result, Play’n Go can launch with a bunch of its games in the Garden State. Those games will include popular options such as Bull in a Rodeo, Leprechaun’s Vault, Forge of Fortunes, and Champions of Mithrune, all of which are some of its latest products, but there are other titles and classic hits that players will appreciate, among which Riche Wilde and the Book of Dead, Reactoonz and others.</p>
<p>The New Jersey launch will happen with PokerStars, which will be the first casino to have access to Play’n Go titles in the jurisdiction. It will also be the only casino that can presently offer those to its players. Of course, Play’n Go is in all likelihood going to seek and expand further. Commenting on this launch Play’n Go Chief Commercial Officer Magnus Olsson said:</p>
<p>"It’s exciting to jump into the action in New Jersey, a state long synonymous with gaming via Atlantic City, which is now leading by example in the online space by delivering fantastic experiences to players in a safe and responsible fashion."</p>
<p>The executive confirmed that North America and New Jersey are both very important markets for the company. Previously, Play’n Go acquired a license to launch in the state of Michigan back in July, marking the beginning of its North American journey. But this is hardly the whole story, as Play’n Go also successfully secured an entry into the newly regulated iGaming market in Ontario, Canada as early as March, and ahead of the official launch on April 1.</p>
<p>None of this means an end to Play’n Go’s North American ambitions, though, as Olsson confirmed that the company will seek to up the ante and join even more regulated iGaming markets in Canada, the United States, and well beyond. More states are now seriously considering legalizing their sports gambling industry as well.</p>
