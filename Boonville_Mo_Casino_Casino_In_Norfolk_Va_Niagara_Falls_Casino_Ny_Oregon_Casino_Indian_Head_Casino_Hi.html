    <h1>Boonville Mo Casino Casino In Norfolk Va Niagara Falls Casino Ny Oregon Casino Indian Head Casino Hi</h1>

<p>Good afternoon Matej &amp; Mechetti,</p>
<p>Thank you for your patience.</p>
<p>We have reviewed the complaint from our end and on this occasion we stand by our decisions.</p>
<p>Customer made several bets before cancelling his bonus. It was not until they made a big win that they decided to cancel the bonus. From the game history that we have provided we can see that the bonus was added just a few seconds after the deposit. There were no room for the customer to miss that a bonus had been added to his account and if the customer did not want a bonus to begin with, they should have cancelled it right away.</p>
<p>This was not the case and the customer chose to keep the bonus and continue to play. Due to the misuse of the bonus, his withdrawal was cancelled and the funds withheld. Customer did play on both Sportsbook and Casino while having the bonus activated which is against our terms. Customer also breached our €5 bet limit while having the bonus activated.</p>
<p>I have highlighted all our terms that relates to this case, which can be found here and here.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Any withdrawals made prior to full completion of bonus wagering may result in full forfeit of the bonus as well as any accumulated funds and winnings from the bonus and deposit used to trigger/credit the bonus.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The maximum amount you are allowed to bet per bet when playing with a bonus is €5 per bet</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Betting on Sportsbook with casino welcome bonus will not count towards the wagering requirement, in case the bonus is solely used to build up bonus funds via casino games, HiperWin reserves the right to void the complete bonus.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The maximum stake allowed when having an active bonus is €5 per spin/bet and any bets placed above this limit may result in account closure and forfeit of any winnings derived throughout and following wagering of the bonus.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We would like to add that the explanation for this decision were given the same day we confiscated the funds.</p>
<p>We can see that the player has been dissatisfied and from our end this is never the outcome that we want. We have also shared the above information directly to Casino Guru with everything else that was requested in hopes of resolving this complaint.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time,</p>
<p>Customer Support Management</p>
