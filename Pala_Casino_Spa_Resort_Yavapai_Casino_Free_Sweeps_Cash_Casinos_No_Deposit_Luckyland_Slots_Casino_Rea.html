<p>GridRival is the world’s first and leading betting startup focused entirely on motorsports. Now, the company believes that it can further reinforce its offer by adding new executive talent to its advisory board. In this case, this is Lloyd Danzig, a known investor in the iGaming space whose appointment comes just on time for the launch of the Daily Fantasy Sports offers that will arrive this summer.</p>
<p>Danzig Joins Other Experts Who Believe in GridRival</p>
<p>Danzig is now a team of other motorsports aficionados and high-profile industry investors, including Menlo Ventures partner Mark Siegel and NASCAR managing director of sports betting Joe Solosky. Commenting on Danzig’s appointment, GridRival CEO Ross Fruin said:</p>
<p>We are delighted to have welcomed Lloyd, Joe and Mark to our team of advisors as we prepare to launch our daily fantasy product. Their collective expertise in motorsports, and respective networks within the iGaming industry, are proving invaluable as we grow and offer greater value to the ever-increasing motorsports fan community. GridRival CEO Ross Fruin</p>
<p>Fruin assured that the app is already gathering momentum with more than 200,000 registered users who are engaged through social and the platform. The addition of Danzig will only help grow and expand the company’s offer further.</p>
<p>The chief executive is confident that GridRival will be able to monetize on the untapped potential in real money sports gambling. Danzig welcomed the opportunity himself arguing that the motorsports audience is ripe for “an authentic fantasy sports and fan engagement app” that has been exclusively to cater to their needs.</p>
<p>Joe Solosky is another prominent talent in the lineup, with Solosky serving a stint at Sportradar and the New York Yankees. He is confident that GridRival is a platform with immense potential that addresses a specific market need.</p>
<p>Grid Rival to Realize Potential for Fantasy Motorsports</p>
<p>Through GridRival, the potential for daily fantasy motorsports can be truly realized, Solosky believes. Siegel is equally confident, leveraging his expertise in capital and investment to make the company work.</p>
<p>GridRival originally launched in 2021 with the ambition to provide sports fans with the daily fantasy league gameplay on Formula 1 and MotoGP they have always craved. The company is looking to expand its reach by continuing to cater to sports fans around the clock and making sure that it does so through the addition of the right talent and the launch of in-demand products.</p>
