<p>Esports solutions provider GRID has become the first esports company and entity to receive an IBIA Betting Data Supplier certification, marking a landmark development for the company. As a result, GRID Esports is now recognized further as an originator of accurate, robust, and reliable source of esports data that can help media, operators, and other entities in the sector guide their strategy through the use of precise informational flows.</p>
<p>GRID Esports Is a Long-Time Veteran in the Industry</p>
<p>GRID Esports has already worked with a number of established companies in the sector, and continues to, including WePlay, Krafton, BLAST Premier, and Riot Games. The latest accreditation by IBIA puts GRID Esports shoulder-to-shoulder with technological data companies from the sports space, including Stats Perform and Sportradar.</p>
<p>The accreditation has been issued following a detailed review by the eCommerce and Online Gaming Regulation and Assurance or eCOGRA for short. The organization is a specialist in testing, inspecting, and certifying dedicated gambling software and systems. IBIA CEO Khalid Ali welcomed this new addition to the team, and spoke of the significance of the event:</p>
<p>It recognizes a high level of integrity in the collation and distribution of esports data by GRID, which in turn gives an important reassurance to those parties wishing to utilize that data that it is of a high level of reliability and accuracy. IBIA CEO Khalid Ali</p>
<p>Moving forward, the company will have to comply with the highest data standards as set out by IBIA. GRID Esports CSO Mikael Westerling also welcomed the partnership and said that the company has been focused on building its proposition over the past four years.</p>
<p>He noted that the company was focused on establishing a sustainable growth strategy in a vertical that the company is passionate about. “We are proud of what we have achieved so far and being awarded the IBIA accreditation is a testimony to the hard work of our team and a great motivation to strive for excellence,” Westerling concluded.</p>
<p>Esports Becomes Watchword in the Gambling Industry</p>
<p>Esports is playing an increasingly important market in the gambling industry with stakeholders opening up to the vertical more aggressively. The State of Nevada is similarly looking into legalizing esports gambling.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, BETBY, another company that has a strong focus on esports completed the separation of its esports solution so that the offshoot company can focus completely on delivering the necessary products to its customer base interested in competitive video gaming exclusively.</p>
