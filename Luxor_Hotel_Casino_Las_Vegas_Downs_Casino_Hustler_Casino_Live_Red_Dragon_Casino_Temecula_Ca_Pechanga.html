<p>The AToM solution will be reinforced by Shift4’s commerce-enabling technology, further bolstering its cashless capabilities</p>
<p>Light &amp; Wonder, a casino gaming tech specialist, has formed a new technology deal with Shift4, a leader in integrated payments and commerce solutions. As a result, the former company will integrate its payment processing technology into Light &amp; Wonder’s cashless table-top debit solution, AToM.</p>
<p>AtoM is described by its parent company as an “easy, point-of-play PIN debit solution.” It lets players access their money without leaving the casino table or having to handle cash. Players can, therefore, enjoy smoother casino experiences, improving player retention for operators.</p>
<p>In addition, AToM provides real-time accounting and game reports while “keeping the game moving.”</p>
<p>Thanks to the new deal, the AToM solution will be reinforced by Shift4’s commerce-enabling technology, further bolstering its cashless capabilities. At first, the deal will cover domestic jurisdictions and Canada. However, more sites will receive support in the future.</p>
<p>The deal comes two weeks after Light &amp; Wonder teamed up with Grand Casino Luzern, agreeing to provide the operator with gaming content.</p>
<p>Shift4 Will Bolster AToM</p>
<p>Shift4’s senior vice president of new verticals, Anthony Perez, lauded the capabilities of his company’s solutions, saying that they are capable of transforming commerce across multiple industries. By leveraging a simplified payment experience that can be seamlessly integrated into other leading tech solutions, Shift4 can truly revolutionize payments.</p>
<p>Speaking about the deal with Light &amp; Wonder, Perez praised the company’s cashless solutions for casinos. He said that Shift4 is excited to further enhance its new ally’s payment capabilities.</p>
<p>We are quickly growing our presence in the gaming space with our ability to deliver both card-present and card-not-present solutions, and this agreement further enhances our capabilities for our casino customers. Anthony Perez, SVP of new verticals, Shift4</p>
<p>Shift4 will further bolster AToM which was described as an “unbelievably simple and intuitive” solution by Mike McKinski, Light &amp; Wonder’s senior vice president of global gaming, tables.</p>
<p>AToM is unbelievably simple, intuitive and offers a great convenience for players. Integrating Shift4’s payment processing capabilities allows us to drive greater value and retention for our customers and a better experience for players. Mike McKinski, SVP of global gaming, tables, Light &amp; Wonder</p>
<p>McKinski added that Shift4’s solutions perfectly complement AToM. The pairing of the two will enable Light &amp; Wonder to deliver a “truly differentiated offering,” McKinski said.</p>
<p>Light &amp; Wonder’s business is going strong with the company projecting an EBITDA growth to $1.4 billion by 2025. The tech provider hopes to conquer new markets and become a leader in Asia and beyond.</p>
