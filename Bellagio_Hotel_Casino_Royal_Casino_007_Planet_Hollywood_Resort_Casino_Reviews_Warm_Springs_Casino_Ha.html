The Dolphins have won the Super Bowl a total of five times and have also won five AFC Championships. The team’s head coach is currently Brian Flores.</p>
<p>The 2020 NFL season was Miami’s 51st season within the NFL. The team finished their last season with ten wins. That surpassed Miami’s 2019 result, when they only won five contests. Overall, the team has so far secured 23 double-digit wins. Last season, the team finished with a 10-6 record and did not make it to the playoffs. During the 2020 season, the team had 41 sacks and scored a total of 404 points. Considering the Dolphins’ elimination from last season’s playoffs, a win during the first week of the 2021 season will undoubtedly boost their confidence going forward.</p>
<p>An Exciting Contest Is Ahead</p>
<p>Based in the Greater Boston, MA, area, the Patriots was founded back in 1959. The team has appeared in the Super Bowl11 times and won six of those games. In fact, the Patriots hold first place for most Super Bowl wins together with the Pittsburgh Steelers. New England missed the playoffs last year after having a slow season.</p>
<p>During the 2020 season, kicker Nick Folk connected on 26 out of 28 field goals. Patriots players that also contributed significantly last season were Anfernee Jennings, Adrian Phillips and Chase Winovich, as well as Adam Butler. Butler was just picked up by the Pats after becoming a free agent, ending his stint with the Dolphins.</p>
<p>Considering that the Dolphins have faced the Patriots more than 100 times, we can honestly say that an exciting game is ahead. Regardless of who wins, the duo will undoubtedly bring plenty of action for all sports fans.</p>
