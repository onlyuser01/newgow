    <h1>Island Casino Michigan Ramada By Wyndham Elko Hotel At Stockmen S Casino Best Online Casino Reddit H</h1>

<p>The company ensured its users that the transition would be seamless, with its high-class trotting offer retaining all its features under the new name</p>
<p>Svenska Spel Sport &amp; Casino, Sweden’s state-owned gaming operator, has renamed its horse games to Svenska Spel Hästar following a dispute with ATG over the name of its trotting venture. The Patent and Market Appeal Court announced the judgment on 25 January, prompting the company to implement this change. This incident marks another setback for the operator, but it remains well-positioned for further growth.</p>
<p>The Name Change Should Have No Ill Consequences</p>
<p>The transition to Svenska Spel Hästar aims to maintain service continuity while complying with the court’s judgment regarding the name dispute. Svenska Spel remains committed to delivering a top-notch trotting experience for its users, incorporating emerging technologies to ensure lasting customer engagement while remaining true to its safe gambling commitment.</p>
<p>Svenska Spel Sport &amp; Casino CEO and business area manager Fredrik Wastenson did not hide his disappointment with the court’s ruling, expressing confusion at how the judges considered that descriptive words for a business could have such high protection. He nevertheless acknowledged the decision and vowed to make the transition as smooth as possible.</p>
<p>“We are proud of our fantastic offer on horses, which will be available just like before, but now under Svenska Spel Hästar.” Fredrik Wastenson, Svenska Spel Sport &amp; Casino CEO and business area manager</p>
<p>Svenska Spel Hästar provides various betting options, including bets on high-stakes games like High Five, Duo, and other formats like Winner and Place in French competitions. The platform also allows users to follow all races live. An upcoming highlight of the French trotting season, the Prix d’Amérique, is scheduled for 28 January at Vincennes.</p>
<p>Sweden’s Land-Based Sector Continues to Struggle</p>
<p>While the rebranding of Svenska Spel’s horse games is a relatively minor issue for the operator, it may compound with several other recent setbacks. The company recently announced it could close two land-based venues, Casino Cosmopol in Gothenburg and Malmö. Svenska Spel confirmed it intends to close the two venues while seeking to “limit losses.”</p>
<p>These challenges originate from the decreasing share of the land-based sector within the gaming vertical in the country. The state-owned operator explained that a substantial shift toward the online gambling sector occurred in 2019 with the reregulation of the industry, further exacerbated by the pandemic. However, Svenska Spel has implemented measures to increase revenues, hopefully achieving a more balanced market.</p>
<p>Svenska Spel’s state-owned status means the operator is significantly more resilient to market downturns and can more easily implement measures to tackle rising industry challenges. It also plays a vital role in spearheading gambling harm prevention research and ensuring that the country’s gambling sector remains safe and sustainable.</p>
