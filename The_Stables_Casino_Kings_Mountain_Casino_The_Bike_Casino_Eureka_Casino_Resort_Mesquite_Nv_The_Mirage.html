<p>Delasport will help EEG open up new revenue streams, allowing it to engage both casino players and bettors</p>
<p>Esports Entertainment Group (EEG), an esports-focused betting operator, has formed a partnership with Delasport, a provider of premium online betting and gaming software and solutions. Under the agreement, the latter company will supply three of its client’s brands in MGA-regulated territories.</p>
<p>The partnership will notably see Delasport supply its cutting-edge content to JustWow.com, CasinoJefe.com, and Vie.bet, providing their players with many new betting products to experience. As a result, EEG will be able to channel more players toward its brands.</p>
<p>By diversifying the three casino brands’ products, Delasport will help EEG open up new revenue streams, allowing it to engage both casino players and bettors.</p>
<p>Delasport delivers a one-stop-shop solution for betting, online casino and player account management. The company boasts an impressive track record of improving player retention rates and profitability for operators. Because of its capabilities, Delasport has multiple clients across the casino industry, with some of the latest including Videoslots and Campeón Gaming.</p>
<p>Another Milestone in Delasport’s Track Record of Successes</p>
<p>Delasport’s chief executive officer, Oren Cohen Shwartz, released a statement regarding the deal, praising the partnership with EEG. According to Shwartz, the agreement represents “another milestone in Delasport’s growing track record of successes.”</p>
<p>We are proud to be able to provide our modern sportsbook solution, boosted with player personalization and engagement tools, to a company with such vast experience. Oren Cohen Shwartz, CEO, Delasport</p>
<p>Alex Igelman, EEG’s chief executive officer, also shared his thoughts on the agreement. According to him, the partnership with Delasport represents an exciting opportunity to grow EEG’s library of products in key markets.</p>
<p>The agreement, Igelman said, would help EEG tap into sports betting audiences, allowing the company to acquire new players.</p>
<p>We are eagerly looking forward to seeing the positive impact and growth this integration brings to our brand. Delasport has been a great partner every step of the way. We feel safe in entrusting the new sportsbook branches to them and their Plug &amp; Play iFrame solution. Alex Igelman, CEO, EEG</p>
<p>Earlier this year, EEG had to part ways with Damian Mathews who resigned as CFO and COO amid strong headwinds for the company. The CFO position was then filled in by the experienced Michael Villani who first served as interim CFO before getting promoted to permanent CFO.</p>
<p>In June, EEG also hired Robert Soper, naming him a director.</p>
