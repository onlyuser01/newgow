    <h1>Pin Up Casino Sheraton Caguas Real Hotel Casino Phoenix Casino Hotels Oroville Casino Casinos Nyc Qu</h1>

<p>I have tried to resolve this through the appropriate channels a few times now with out success. At one point I had a customer service tell me they could credit back my casino account balance the amount but then was logged off the system after waiting some time. When I got someone back on the chat I was told I would have to resend my email if complaint again a second time and they would escalate it but the only response I have ever gotten is an automated zendesk response. I am going to copy and paste my letter to them I sent to them last.</p>
<p>The email is as follows :</p>
<p>** This my 3rd time sending this to your attention please respond. First sent Nov 7 2023**</p>
<p>I recently requested a withdrawal of $750.00 on Nov 6th to be sent to my account via etransfer which went from being excited and thrilled I had solved a small emergency which I required funds to stop myself from being homeless and also enough to catch up on some bills. Being cautious I spoke to one of your live chat agents and asked if they could confirm that all the money was mine and not going to end up being technically not mine at all. I was assured it was indeed all mine and that was that. Then I spoke to an agent that told me that my request had been completed and the funds were sent to my bank account and I should see them there shortly. As they were being sent via etransfer I knew it would being in my account this morning. So I went to the bank to withdrawal it and it wasnâ€™t there. So I contacted support and after one agent yet again disconnecting me and logging me off the application I was able to speak to an Agent Named Morgana who explained to me what had all happened and where my money was now.</p>
<p>I have now got to go to my landlord and explain to them that the money I had promised would be in his hands in the next few days that would shore up what I owed due and would halt any eviction action on his part no longer exists because of miscommunications and your employees basically out right not telling me the truth about what was happening.</p>
<p>I would not have in my wildest dreams thought that money in the balance of my betting account was the money that I had won and had asked to be deposited to my account. I have no received any communication until speaking with the agent this morning that told me what was what was happening and I have checked my spam and inbox. If I was made aware of this fact I would have sent the money again for withdrawal and not continued to gamble it. I just thought I had misremembered the closing balance I had logged off with the last time I had played because I believed and was told that a) I had withdrawn the funds out of my betting account so I could safely know that money was out of my reach for gambling to make sure my bills could be paid and b) I was told that my transaction was completed as requested and that the money would be in my bank account shortly.</p>
<p>I believe in giving companies a fair chance to work with me as a customer to resolve what I can see at the moment is just a very big mistake on several of your agents' parts when I came to the handling of funds and the communication of what was actually happening with the funds. I in good faith believed your employees to be telling me the truth and give me the right information so I could make informed decisions that could alter my life going forward significantly and now I am left looking like an idiot and possibly a liar. I frankly want the full 750.00 that I was expecting to be transferred to me as per my conversations that had originally confirmed to me that it had been sent to my account which led me to making promises I could not keep because I had put faith that your employees were not going to steer me wrong.</p>
<p>I do not wish to take this further than this as I hope you are able to resolve this issue between us quickly and avoid the need to take this any further. I have enjoyed playing on your casino and until now I could not have said a bad thing about my experience with your company but this is not something I can just let slide and walk away from without feeling like I had been taken advantage of and used to ultimately confuse and trick me into unknowingly use the much smaller amount of winnings then I had been told I was able to withdrawal fully.</p>
<p>Regards</p>

<p>Basically I feel like they owe me the 750 as I had been told I was receiving that amount and it had already been etransfered to my account however I realized that might not be possible.</p>
