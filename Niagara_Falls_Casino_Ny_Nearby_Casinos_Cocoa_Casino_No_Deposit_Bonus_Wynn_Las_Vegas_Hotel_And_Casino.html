<p>The gambling conglomerate has announced that it has been featured on LinkedIn’s Top Company list for 2023 in Ireland and Australia</p>
<p>The distinction further exemplifies the company’s commitment to supporting its team members across various jurisdictions as the company steers towards an ever-expanding presence in the global regulated gambling industry.</p>
<p>Best Place to Work in the Gambling Industry</p>
<p>Flutter is presently ranked #2 in LinkedIn’s Top Companies List in Ireland, and the company, which hires some 1,200 people through its Sportsbet brand in Australia, ranks #21. Sportsbet is further recognized as one of the Top 10 Employers for Women in Australia, giving Flutter an additional reason to be proud of its achievement as an employer over the past years.</p>
<p>LinkedIn’s Top Companies List is an impartial assessment of working conditions and companies’ commitment to their team members, their development, and their career success. The list specifically looks into factors such as upward mobility, skills growth, external opportunity, company stability, affinity, gender diversity, educational background, and other factors that help the company determine which business should be included and how far up they should rank.</p>
<p>Flutter was humbled to accept the distinction and company chief people officer, Phil Bishop, said that the company was committed to making a lasting and positive impact on its team members.</p>
<p>“Our vibrant and dynamic environment is founded on our people committing to doing the right thing, having ambitious views, and having the power and ability to act,” Bishop said. He reaffirmed the company’s commitment to attracting the brightest minds to create a global community of talent that can continuously evolve and improve.</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to receive this recognition from LinkedIn, and this is testimony to all of the hard work from everyone within the Flutter family on our journey to responsibly lead betting and gaming into the future,” the executive concluded.</p>
<p>Flutter has been looking into more ways to expand its business in the meantime, with the company hinting at a US listing that will now be coordinated with its shareholders.</p>
