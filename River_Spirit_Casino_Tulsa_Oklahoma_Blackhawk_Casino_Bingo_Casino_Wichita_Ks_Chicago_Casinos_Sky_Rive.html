<p>According to the Philippine News Agency, the president made the surprising statement at the opening of the Philippines’ first container-barge port in the city of Tanza on Wednesday.</p>
<p>“That Okada. I’d like to announce, all you cops, stay away from there,” he said. “What are the policemen doing there? What’s your business there…? If you violate my order, I will dismiss you from the service.</p>
<p>“…That’s an order. Because you are there to commit a crime. You are not assigned there, or I will assign the army to patrol there,” he continued. “Choose: either the military will do the patrolling there or you go out of that place.”</p>
<p>“One more policeman there and incident and I will call the (Army) Rangers to come down and patrol the whole of Dewey Boulevard,” he added.</p>
<p>Zero Tolerance</p>
<p>In April, Police Superintendent Adrian Antonio was arrested for gambling at an unnamed casino in Entertainment City. All government officials, including police officers, are banned from playing in casinos by presidential decree.</p>
<p>Duterte singled out the Okada Manila because he claimed it was “crawling with usurers and kidnappers.” It was a place where “low-life members of the society” stay, he added.</p>
<p>The populist president has previously expressed his dislike of gambling, but it’s his dislike of “low life members of society” that has garnered global media attention.</p>
<p>Death Squads</p>
<p>Duterte swept to power in June 2016 on a manifesto of zero tolerance to crime and drugs. Police death squads sanctioned by the president have murdered thousands of criminals and drug addicts since his election.</p>
<p>On assuming power, he set about dismantling the Philippines online gambling industry –- in particular, the operations of Philweb, which owned 299 online gambling cafés across the country until Duterte pulled its license.</p>
<p>The company’s billionaire owner Roberto Ongpin was described by Duterte as an example of the type of “oligarch embedded in government” he wanted to eliminate.</p>
<p>After apparently giving his blessing to casino projects proposed by Landing International and Galaxy Entertainment, he abruptly changed his mind, declaring there would be no more casinos on his watch.</p>
