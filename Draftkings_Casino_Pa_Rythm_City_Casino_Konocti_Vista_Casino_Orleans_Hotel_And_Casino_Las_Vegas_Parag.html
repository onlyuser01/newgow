    <h1>Draftkings Casino Pa Rythm City Casino Konocti Vista Casino Orleans Hotel And Casino Las Vegas Parag</h1>

<p>I asked for an 89 euro withdrawal. I received a message from support that I didn't wager 33 euros of my initial 50 euro deposit (that no bonuses were added). And they referred to me the terms and conditions 4.8 that say "4.8 If the value of a deposit is not wagered in full before a withdrawal is requested, Stoiximan reserves the right to apply a charge to the customerâ€™s account to cover all reasonable costs relating to both the deposit and withdrawal. If necessary, the value of the withdrawal requested may be reduced accordingly. Stoiximan may also request additional identification documents for all withdrawals and perform enhanced due diligence in respect to withdrawals of funds not used for wagering." https://www.stoiximan.gr/article/en/game-plan/947/</p>
<p>So I replied that 4.8 does not mention anywhere that I can't make the withdrawal!</p>
<p>Instead, if I withdraw, it writes that they can charge me resealable costs related to the withdrawal/deposit cost.</p>
<p>I asked them to proceed with the withdrawal and charge me the costs.</p>
<p>They replied that there was no cost but can't process the request because there is 33 euro unwagered and I had to keep playing.</p>
<p>I told them many times that 4.8 does not mention that I can't make a withdrawal, but they insist that they will not process my withdrawal.</p>
