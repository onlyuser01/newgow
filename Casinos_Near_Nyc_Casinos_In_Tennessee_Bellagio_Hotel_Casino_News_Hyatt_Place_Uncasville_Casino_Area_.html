    <h1>Casinos Near Nyc Casinos In Tennessee Bellagio Hotel Casino News Hyatt Place Uncasville Casino Area</h1>

<p>Swintt is a fast-growing provider with a strong focus on expert content that can bridge the gap between standard gameplay and players’ continuously changing expectations. At the beginning of the year, the developer released Extra Win X, a premium video slot that introduced a revolutionary bonus feature with the potential of boosting wins by up to 800x.</p>
<p>Today, Swintt announced the launch of Mystic Bear XtraHold, another eye-catching game part of the same Xtra series. The new title incorporates the brand new XtraHold feature and has a 10,000x maximum win potential.</p>

<p>Venture Into the Wild With Mystic Bear XtraHold</p>
<p>The game brings together both classic and innovative gaming elements for a complete experience online. Players are invited to get their paws on the spectacular wins while walking through the mysterious Northern American forest inhabited by wild, mystical animals protected by the magic of the full moon guarding them.</p>
<p>The chosen background is a dense forest packed with howling wolves, mighty falcons, comic squirrels, and the Mystic Bear. Full moon and pawprint scatter symbols can be used to trigger extra bonuses. While the base game is almost just as entertaining as the bonus-triggered version, once all the wild and scatter symbols make an appearance on the reels, the switch is more than obvious.</p>
<p>When a player manages to land a minimum of six full moon symbols during the base game, the XtraHold re-spin feature is activated. As a result, all the full moon symbols along with their cash prizes will stay in place, while three extra re-spins will be initiated. A re-spin counter will then be seen dropping by one at the end of each new re-spin round.</p>
<p>Lucky players who land an additional full moon symbol will have the respective symbol along with its attached prize sticking to the reels while the re-spins are restarted. This goes on until there are no more fresh re-spins that can be retriggered, or until the full moon symbols completely fill the reels. This is the point when players are rewarded with a huge bonus.</p>
<p>Mystic Bear XtraHold’s Buy Feature</p>
<p>Mystic Bear XtraHold also lets players enjoy Swintt’s “Buy Feature” alternative that allows them to immediately jump into the bonus rounds and get access to free spins and XtraHold re-spins.</p>
<p>Besides the XtraHoldTM re-spins, a player who lands between three and five pawprint symbols while playing the base game can also trigger five, eight, or ten free spins. The respective feature occurs on an upgraded display of reels where columns two to four begin spinning in order to create giant Mega Symbols.</p>
<p>Once the Mega Symbols take over the middle of the board, players solely need to land matching icons on the first and fifth reels in order to trigger the maximum five-of-a-kind winnings.</p>
<p>Swintt’s chief commercial officer David Mann expressed the company’s thrill to launch the XtraHold feature that completes its Xtras series which includes the XtraLock and the XtraWild systems. The game is expected to reach the lobbies of the provider’s partner casinos later in June.</p>
