<p>Gaming content and technology supplier Aristocrat Leisure Limited announced its online Real Money Gaming (RMG) division will be branded as Anaxi and the brand will form the third business unit of Aristocrat Group alongside Aristocrat Gaming and Pixel United.</p>
<p>Reimagine Online Gaming Content</p>
<p>The announcement of the Anaxi brand is seen as the next step of the company’s growth strategy which saw the creation of Aristocrat’s dedicated online RMG unit in February this year.</p>
<p>Excited to announce the creation of the new brand under the Aristocrat Group umbrella, Mitchell Bowen, chief executive officer of Anaxi, positioned Anaxi as Aristocrat’s emerging online RMG business that “reimagines the world’s greatest gaming content online” and sets the business on a path to “becoming the most trusted name in online RMG globally.”</p>
<p>The newly branded business will support the execution of the ‘build and buy’ strategy by helping the brand continue to attract and retain talented industry personnel and foster strong team culture.</p>
<p>Continuing his comments, Bowen outlined that the new Anaxi brand will be showcased at G2E Las Vegas, and used the occasion to invite Aristocrat’s customers, partners, and players to visit Aristocrat Gaming stand and ‘Experience Anaxi.’</p>
<p>Targeting US Launch</p>
<p>Aristocrat said that the first regulated online casino product under the Anaxi brand in the US is expected to go live by the end of 2022 in partnership with two major customers.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Aristocrat is determined to continue expanding its online RMG offering pursuing various opportunities, including m&amp;a similar to the recent acquisition of B2B online RMG supplier Roxor Gaming.</p>
<p>The addition of Roxor Gaming’s vast affiliate network will help Aristocrat expand its global reach spanning more than 300 licensed gaming jurisdictions in over 100 countries globally.</p>
<p>The acquisition will also bring significant online RMG experience by onboarding Roxor’s UK team of over 100 dedicated professionals to the over 7,000 Aristocrat employees across 20 locations worldwide.</p>
<p>The B2B gaming supplier that was the former in-house studio of Gamesys Group already live in New Jersey and the UK and is planning to expand further in North America and the UK.</p>
<p>Also as part of its expansion strategy in the US, Aristocrat signed a multi-year partnership deal with NFL’s New England Patriots that will feature Aristocrat branding at the Patriots’ Gillette Stadium year-round, as well as in-game activations and promotions for the fans of the Patriots.</p>
