<p>Apparat’s traditional slots are already proving to be a success in Switzerland and the company is certain that players are also going to love its video slots</p>
<p>Apparat Gaming, a company describing itself as a “developer of slots with a German accent,” has unveiled a new content agreement with Casinò Lugano’s iGaming brand in Switzerland. As agreed, Apparat will leverage Pariplay’s aggregation platform to supply the operator with games.</p>
<p>Thanks to the deal, a selection of premium and distinctly-German games will become available to customers of Swiss4Win, Casinò Lugano’s local online casino brand. Apparat Gaming will inject some of the best content it can offer, including hit titles such as Total Eclipse, 40 Sevens, Jack Potter &amp; The Book of Dynasties, Heimdall’s Horn and Fruits First.</p>
<p>The addition of these titles to Swiss4Win’s platform will present online gamblers with many new and exciting experiences. The integration will help Swiss4Win consolidate its presence in the region and maintain an edge over its competitors.</p>
<p>Casinò Lugano owns a huge casino in Ticino situated on Lago di Lugano. The company has been doing retail business for decades and, since the launch of iGaming in Switzerland, forayed into the digital sector as well. Its Swiss4Win brand offers sports betting markets, table games, live casino games, jackpot titles and slots.</p>
<p>Apparat Gaming Is Sure Players Are Going to Love Its Video Slots</p>
<p>Paolo Sanvido, CEO and board member at Casinò Lugano, commented on the agreement, saying that Apparat Gaming shares his company’s passion for exciting gaming experiences. Its slots “with a German accent” will be a great addition to Swiss4Win’s offerings, Sanvido believes.</p>
<p>Its [Apparat Gaming’s] games will not only exceed the expectations of our players and will also allow Swiss4Win to stand out from its rivals with fresh and exciting content that is not yet available at other brands. Paolo Sanvido, CEO &amp; member of the board of directors, Casinò Lugano</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Martin Frindt, Apparat Gaming’s co-founder and chief product officer, said that his studio’s games seek to provide unique games that offer a distinct German polish. According to him, this means quality engineering, strong looks and highly efficient fun.</p>
<p>Frindt noted that Apparat’s traditional slots are already proving to be a success in Switzerland. He is certain that Swiss iGaming enthusiasts are also going to love the digital content the company has to offer.</p>
<p>Casinò Lugano and its Swiss4Win brand are a great addition to our network of operator partners, and we look forward to further establishing Apparat Gaming as a must-have provider for operators active in Switzerland and beyond. Martin Frindt, co-founder &amp; CPO, Apparat Gaming</p>
<p>In March, Apparat Gaming also penned a deal with Gaming Innovation Group, agreeing to provide content to the latter company’s partnering operators.</p>
