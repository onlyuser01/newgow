<p>Social media sports and entertainment content platform Playmaker announced it has selected emerging sports platform No House Advantage (NHA) as its exclusive fantasy partner for the upcoming NFL season.</p>
<p>Fantasy Sports Content Integration</p>
<p>The new partnership between Playmaker and NHA for the 2022 NFL season will see content from the daily fantasy sport (DFS) operator being gradually integrated within Playmaker’s extensive coverage of the league, featuring across @playmaker and @playamkerbetting to reach more than 3.6 million followers in total.</p>
<p>Recognizing “just how valuable the fantasy football space” for Playmaker’s followers is, James Caricato, head of betting at Playmaker, outlined the agreement with NHA as “yet another medium to escalate the audience’s entire NFL viewing experience.”</p>
<p>“Brokering this kind of partnership with a brand like No House Advantage helps keep our followers engaged all season long, presenting a no-brainer opportunity for both parties,” Caricato concluded.</p>
<p>NHA will also serve as the presenting sponsor of “Dumpster Diving”, the inaugural free-to-play game in which Playmaker will be asking players to build the worst possible weekly football lineup in a spin on classic fantasy sports games, offering them to win cash, prizes and NHA bonuses.</p>
<p>Exclusive Dockery Content</p>
<p>The partnership will also cover collaboration with prominent sports influencer Dockery, who will work exclusively with Playmaker and NHA to promote NHA’s unique vision of fantasy football by producing NFL content throughout the season and bringing it to his 4.8 million followers across Instagram, YouTube and TikTok.</p>
<p>“Knowing the level of engagement Playmaker yields from its audience, we are thrilled to once again partner up for the NFL Season,” said Kevin Koeppel, founder and chief executive officer of NHA, expecting to see the fantasy sports operator’s “distinctive offerings … resonate with Playmaker’s following” and looking forward to the opportunity to contribute to the platform during the season.</p>
<p>Playmaker and NHA initially joined forces in February 2021, as the media and talent company with its more than 40 million followers, 50+ athletes under management and over 20 shows on Snap Discover, was seen as the forum that would allow the innovative DFS operator to expand its reach, while Playmaker would offer its following exposure to the pioneering form of DFS contests.</p>
