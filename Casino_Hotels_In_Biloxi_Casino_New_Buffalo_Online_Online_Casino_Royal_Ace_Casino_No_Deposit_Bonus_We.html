    <h1>Casino Hotels In Biloxi Casino New Buffalo Online Online Casino Royal Ace Casino No Deposit Bonus We</h1>

<p>Hey guys,</p>
<p>I asked the casino to close my account permanent on 06. April via email. I got a response asap. And then they tryed to convince me to let my account open.</p>
<p>I told them in 3 different e-mail, that my decision is final and I want my account to be closed, and they tryed every time to give me reasons to not close it. I wrote it is my final decision. They did not close it and it is still open.</p>
<p>I was able to deposit another 500â‚¬ after the closure request, which I think, should not have been possible.</p>
<p>My mails:</p>

<p>"Hi guys</p>
<p>I wanna shut down my account permanent.</p>
<p>I don't wanna gamble anymore.</p>
<p>Thanks"</p>
<p>Casino Answer 06.04. 20:45:</p>
<p>"Max, we draw your attention to the fact that you always have the opportunity to take a break from the game without blocking your account. The casino does not oblige you to regularly play and place bets. You can return to the game when your mood improves, and when conducting a no deposit promotion on the site, you can take part in it."</p>

<p>"Jeah but please block my account.</p>
<p>Thanks a lot. Final decision."</p>

<p>"In the near future, we are preparing an interesting no deposit promotion for our players, in which you can also take part. It will be a pity if you miss it."</p>

<p>"As I said.</p>
<p>Final decision. Please close it now.</p>
<p>I don't wanna repeat."</p>
<p>My account is still open. My next deposit was on 07.04. 18:53, a full day later. I am gamblig addicted, that's why I told I am final in my decision to close the account 3 times. I even wrote I will not repeat my request and it is final.</p>
<p>That's why I ask for a refund of deposits after the request, because of not respecting my closure decision. I think I wrote 3 times more than clearly, that I want my account to be closed.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help in this case. I uploaded the mails and deposit history.</p>
