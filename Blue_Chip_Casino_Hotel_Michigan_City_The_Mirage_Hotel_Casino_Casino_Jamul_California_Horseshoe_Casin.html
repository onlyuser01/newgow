<p>The team’s experienced striker Callum Wilson was meanwhile selected by FUN88 as May’s Player of the Month</p>
<p>FUN88, one of the biggest gaming and sports betting operators in Asia, has unveiled a new partnership agreement with the British soccer club Newcastle United FC. The agreement will set the gambling company as the team’s official Asian betting partner.</p>
<p>Newcastle United already enjoys a fruitful partnership with the operator, which became its principal sponsor at the beginning of the 2017/18 season. Since then, FUN88’s logo has appeared on the front of the Magpies’ kits and training gear.</p>
<p>After working together for six seasons, the two parties have decided to deepen their ties with an Asia-oriented deal. According to the announcement, the partnership will leverage FUN88’s popularity in Asia to bolster the club’s commercial growth in the region. To that end, the operator will launch special in-market initiatives, official Newcastle United FC merchandise and VIP experiences for local fans.</p>
<p>The deal will kick off from the 2023/24 season onwards. In a statement, Newcastle United expressed its appreciation for the operator’s continued support:</p>
<p>The club thanks FUN88 for its support over the past six campaigns and looks forward to working together over coming seasons. Newcastle United statement</p>
<p>FUN88 Selected Wilson as May’s Player of the Month</p>
<p>A day later, Fun88 elected the Newcastle United forward Callum Wilson as its May’s Player of the Month. This followed the striker’s impressive performance during the 2022/23 season, which also saw him secure April’s Player of the Month accolade.</p>
<p>The player did some amazing things and was instrumental in the Magpies’ 4-1 victory against Brighton at St. James’ Park. This, Newcastle United pointed out, almost earned the team a place in the Champions League. The club later secured its spot in Europe’s premier club competition with a goalless draw at home to Leicester.</p>
<p>In an interview with nufc.co.uk, Wilson commented on the development, calling April a “massive month” for the team.</p>
<p>April so it was important to take that into May and finish the season strongly. We had a big week with two games against Brighton and Leicester and it was important to get those points on the board and lock in that top four place. Callum Wilson, striker, Newcastle United FC</p>
<p>Fans can vote for the FUN88 Player of the Month after each match in the club’s post-match e-mail.</p>
<p>Last year, FUN88 named the Spanish captain Ilker Casillas as a brand ambassador. The appointment came right before the FIFA World Cup 2022 in Qatar.</p>
