<p>Caesars Entertainment has announced that its planned renovation of Harrah’s, the only land-based casino in New Orleans, is going according to schedule. The $325 million project includes a 340-room hotel tower, extensively redesigned interiors, and exteriors, and new culinary offerings. The final goal is to create a top-tier resort near the city’s French Quarter.</p>
<p>Harrah’s Aims to Become a Preeminent Sports Betting Destination</p>
<p>The main highlights of the renovation are the new Caesars Sportsbook and World Series of Poker Room, which will open to the public this fall. Regional President at Caesars Entertainment Dan Real proclaimed that the new sportsbook would become the premier sports betting venue in Louisiana and the neighboring states, offering a first-class experience for sports fans and tourists.</p>

<p>The operator’s plans for the new sportsbook venue are very impressive. The Sportsbook at Harrah’s will be situated on 5,700 square feet. It will contain four betting windows, a dozen self-service kiosks, and a top-of-the-line audiovisual system. Customers will enjoy non-stop sporting events on a 147-foot video screen. The venue will be able to seat 140 customers, with 28 additional spots available at its impressive bar. VIP guests will be treated to the “Fan Cave,” a 10-person private area that aims to provide the ultimate viewing experience.</p>
<p>Fans of Poker Will Also Be Pleased with the Renovations</p>
<p>Another substantial development at Harrah’s is the planned World Series of Poker Room. Caesars is already planning to host three weekly tournaments on Sundays, Mondays, and Wednesdays. General Manager at Harrah’s New Orleans Samir Mowad stated that the renovated venue would provide a high-class environment for poker players. He added that the new poker room would help foster an atmosphere of competitiveness and camaraderie and would be the site of many thrilling victories.</p>

<p>The World Series of Poker Room will not be focused only on professionals and will offer live poker suited for varying skill levels.</p>
<p>Caesars Continues to Invest in Its Louisiana Properties</p>
<p>Harrah’s is not the only significant renovation project Caesars Entertainment is involved with in Louisiana. The operator is also planning to completely rebuild its Lake Charles resort which will reopen as Horseshoe Lake Charles.</p>
<p>At Atlantic City, Caesars is investing $400 million in renovating its existing resort with a significant focus on improved catering services. The company has attracted famous names such as Hell’s Kitchen by Gordon Ramsay and Japanese-themed lifestyle brand Nobu Hospitality which will open a hotel and restaurant at the resort.</p>
