<p>Krantz will remain actively engaged in guiding the company's operations until his departure at the close of September</p>
<p>In a strategic move, Yggdrasil, the renowned online gambling solutions provider, has announced the appointment of James Curwen as the incoming CEO, with his tenure set to commence on October 1. Curwen brings a wealth of industry expertise to his new role, succeeding Björn Krantz, who will transition out of his CEO position.</p>
<p>Krantz Hands Over Leadership to Curwen</p>
<p>Björn Krantz, reflecting on his tenure, stated that from the beginning, his efforts with Yggdrasil had been centered around transformation. He added that with the company moving into the subsequent stage of its global advancements, it was now appropriate for him to pass on the responsibilities.</p>
<p>Krantz further commended Curwen’s appointment: “James Curwen is an industry veteran; he will bring invaluable experience and leadership to the company as it enters the next phase of driving sustainable and profitable growth. It’s his time to lead.”</p>
<p>Krantz’s sentiments were echoed by Itai Frieberger, Yggdrasil’s chairman of the board, who said:</p>
<p>The board is thrilled to announce that James Curwen has agreed to join us as the new chief executive officer for Yggdrasil. We believe he possesses the skills and experience to elevate the business to new heights. On behalf of the Board, I want to express our gratitude to Björn for his hard work and dedication over the last four years at Yggdrasil. Itai Frieberger, Yggdrasil’s chairman of the board</p>
<p>Curwen, an industry veteran with a distinguished track record, has made his mark as a chief online officer at OPAP, the distinguished Greek operator. With a background including stints as CEO of Golden Rock Studios and chief gaming officer at Superbet, he also spent a considerable tenure at William Hill, holding pivotal roles such as chief gaming product officer. His comprehensive experience positions him well to take the reins of Yggdrasil during this critical juncture of its development.</p>
<p>Strategic Leadership Change at Yggdrasil Aligns with Business Restructuring</p>
<p>The change in leadership comes on the heels of Yggdrasil’s decision, earlier this June, to restructure its business framework. Merging the Product and Programs and Studio divisions into a singular entity operating under the banner of “Gaming,” this move is anticipated to enhance transparency, streamline processes, and provide operational advantages. Such alterations are projected to yield improvements in product development, agile content deployment, and a more focused alignment with player and operator demands.</p>
<p>Mark McGinley’s appointment as chief gaming officer at Yggdrasil, as revealed concurrently with the business restructuring announcement, underscored the company’s commitment to optimal gaming experiences. Having amassed over 25 years of experience across B2C and B2B gaming sectors, including his recent tenure at Funfair Games and Entain, McGinley’s insight is poised to enrich Yggdrasil’s gaming portfolio.</p>
