<p>Juicy Fruits review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>This slot has a bright and cheery fruit machine theme.</p>
<p>This game adds a sumptuous flavour to its classic aesthetic. Rather than the run-of-the-mill fruit machine, players will dive into a bowl of punch to snag as many juicy chunks of fruit as they can.</p>
<p>Juicy Fruits will draw in lovers of the vintage fruit machine but also newcomers who can’t resist its tasty imagery. Be warned, this slot may leave players longing for a tropical cocktail.</p>
<p>Mega win in the free spins bonus</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>A chill tune plays in the background accompanied by the mouthwatering sounds of drinks being poured and ice clattering. The music picks up to a festive level upon spins and the slots spin with a satisfying shuffle. The soundtrack leaves no doubt that players have stepped into an awesome party.</p>
<p>The reels are filled with a range of fruits from the classic cherries and lemons, to special treats like kiwis and raspberries. The selection creates a sense of plenty and might leave players feeling a little hungry.</p>
<p>The backdrop behind the reels is a sloshing punch bowl filled with tantalizing juice and ample chucks of ice and fruit. Players will have the whimsical feeling that the game itself is taking place within a brimming bowl of fresh cocktail punch.</p>
<p>Overall, the animation and soundtrack of this game create a festive atmosphere.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Juicy Fruits is a five reel, five row slot, with 50 win lines.</p>
<p>Players may select a bet multiplier for the game, which will cause the game to behave differently. A bet multiplier of x25 means the player will experience normal play, but a bet multiplier of x30 doubles the chance of winning free spins due to more Scatters appearing on the reels.</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter symbol. It appears on all the reels and while in the base game the Wild symbol may land alone or in clusters of 2x2, 3x3, 4x4, or 5x5.</p>
<p>2x2 Wild symbol cluster in the Juicy Fruits slot</p>
<p>The Scatter symbol can land on all the reels and when players land 3 or more of these symbols, the Free Spins feature is triggered. Players are initially awarded 6 free spins.</p>
<p>While in the feature a Wild will always be on the reels, assigned to a randomised place each time a new spin is performed.</p>
<p>Every Scatter symbol that lands during the Free Spins feature is collected for the player until the end of the round. Every time 3 Scatters are collected, the feature is retriggered, providing a randomised number of free spins from 1 to 3. Meanwhile, the roaming Wild will increase in size progressively.</p>
<p>The Free Spins feature can be retriggered a maximum of four times.</p>
<p>The buy-in option into the free spins bonus feature</p>
