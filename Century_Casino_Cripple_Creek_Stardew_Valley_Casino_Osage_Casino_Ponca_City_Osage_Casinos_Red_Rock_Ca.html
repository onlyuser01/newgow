<p>Hello, I didn't have any money in my account, but I wanted to have some fun on the DEMO version of the net game GONZOQUEST. By mistake, instead of the demo, I pressed the command to play with real money. I was surprised when I noticed a $ 30 balance in the game that I didn't have. I figured it was some kind of prize bonus and started playing. After a while, I got an unexpected gain of an incredible $ 2,500. I left the game and was stunned when I saw that the amount received did not appear in my account. I contacted the casino and they replied that I was not damaged because there was no profit either. They allegedly had technical problems with converting dinars into dollars. they briefly refused to pay me the winnings. here is the casino's answer</p>

<p>Dear All,</p>
<p>After a detailed analysis of our technical team, it was determined that there were no irregularities with your session and that all your gains were calculated correctly.</p>
<p>You started the mentioned session with RSD 1.95 as you had on your account at that time and ended with RSD 25.90.</p>
<p>Please note that when entering the NetEnt game, the money you enter the game with is converted into credits (USD), so when entering the game you had 191.1 credits (USD) on your balance, which is 1.95 RSD, as much as you had on your account. and when you left the game you had 2538 credits (USD) on the balance, which is 25.9 RSD.</p>
<p>In a specific spin, you had a stake of 3 loans (USD), which in dinars amounts to 0.03 RSD, and you made a profit in the amount of 2457 loans (USD), which in dinars amounts to 25.07 RSD.</p>
<p>During yesterday we had problems with the conversion of dinars into credits (USD) when entering the NetEnt game where instead of the amount in dinars with which you enter the game is divided by a certain coefficient, the amount was actually multiplied by the coefficient so you are with 1 , 95 RSD with which you entered the game you had 191.1 credits (USD), but that in any case does not change the winning ratio, so in no case are you damaged and all your winnings are correctly calculated and added to the account.</p>
<p>The conversion error was corrected yesterday.</p>
<p>We apologize for the inconvenience.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
