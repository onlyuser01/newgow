    <h1>Lucky Legends Casino Casino Dell Aurora Red Wing Casino Red Wing Mn River Casino Pittsburgh Pa Casin</h1>

<p>Today 09/18</p>
<p>There was an accident on my account, I made a deposit of 200 Euros, I got 300 euros in winnings, but a coupon was active and I received a bonus of 60 Euros, and I automatically entered a SBWINBIG150 campaign.</p>
<p>I went to withdraw the winnings and it wasn't possible and so I accidentally canceled the campaign for my regular money to go back to my wallet without the bonus, and then all my money disappeared! This is fair?</p>
<p>I need a solution for this, I didn't need the bonus to get the winnings, and I didn't know I was inside a campaign, and if I knew all this I wouldn't cancel to get my winnings.</p>
<p>If this is Selectbet's rule, I apologize and refund my 200 Euros again, because mistakes happen, but it's not fair that my deposit disappeared like that from my wallet, I played and won the games, I contacted the chat to support and he can't help me, this is for bigger matters, so I ask you to understand my case of the accident and that you can help me.</p>
<p>I thank.</p>
<p>Romulus</p>
