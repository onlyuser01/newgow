<p>Caleb Rogers is a good boy gone bad. The off-duty police officer appeared in Las Vegas Justice Court on Monday, February 28, 2022, where he faced his first hearing and possibly get bail. He was arrested on Sunday, 8 News Now reported in an alleged robbery at the Rio Hotel and Casino Sportsbook.</p>
<p>A Las Vegas Metro Officer in Trouble</p>
<p>As a consequence of his action, Rogers has been charged with four separate charges, including robbery with the use of a deadly weapon, assault with the use of a deadly weapon, and more. Rogers is possibly involved in other such crimes as well, the I-Team said, the media outlet that caught and followed the story first.</p>
<p>According to the I-Team, Rogers may have also been involved in another robbery that took place on January 6 in North Last Vegas. Before that, it’s possible that the off-duty police officer had something to do with a November holdup at Red Rock Casino. Those crimes were committed with his full awareness of his actions.</p>
<p>The Las Vegas Metro Police Department confirmed that the officer will be placed on suspension and without pay pending a criminal investigation. If Rogers makes bail he will have still have to undergo high-level monitoring including forego the use of any weapons. The media was not able to corroborate if he had requested an attorney.</p>
<p>Rogers Linked to Two Other Robberies</p>
<p>Christopher Laurent, the prosecutor, confirmed for the court that Roger’s MO was similar to the two other unresolved crimes cited before. In other words, Rogers would have to brace for additional charges. The police department was stern in its rebuke of the officer.</p>
<p>“While everyone has a presumption of innocence until proven guilty, if these allegations are true, the LVPPA could not be more disappointed and disgusted by the actions of one rogue officer,” the LVMPD said. No members of Rogers’ family have come forth for comment.</p>
