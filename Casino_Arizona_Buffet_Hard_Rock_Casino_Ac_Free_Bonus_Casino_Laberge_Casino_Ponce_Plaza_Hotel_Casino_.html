<p>Leading cross-platform global game company Light &amp; Wonder has partnered with the Oregon Lottery for a test run of its Kascada Dual Screen Multi-Game VLTs</p>
<p>Retailers in Salem and its surroundings will soon feature 100 new machines, giving players access to some of Light &amp; Wonder’s best-performing games. If the trial run is successful, the two parties plan to strengthen their partnership and replace some of the Lottery’s ageing hardware with the newest Light &amp; Wonder technology and content.</p>
<p>The New VLTs Sport Impressive Features</p>
<p>March marks the start of the newest endeavor for the Oregon Lottery as the organization aims to update its arsenal of video lottery terminals (VLTs). Leading casino and iGaming developer Light &amp; Wonder has stepped in, offering 100 Kascada Dual Screen Multi-Game cabinets to be distributed across retailers in Salem as a trial to prove the product’s merits.</p>
<p>The new machines offer an unparalleled experience with two high-definition 27″ displays, fast gameplay, smooth animation, and multi-channel sound. Players will enjoy premium content by Light &amp; Wonder’s talented development teams in titles such as Treasure Fruits, Flush Frenzy Poker, and Lightning Tusks. The trial marks Kascada Dual Screen’s first domestic release and will be vital for its future success.</p>
<p>The Oregon Lottery has been hard at work updating its services to remain adequate in the digital age. The organization recently partnered with IGT to introduce cashless solutions and individual player accounts. The Lottery has also doubled down on VLTs as its preferred platform, leading to the current deal with Light &amp; Wonder.</p>
<p>The Lottery Appears Cautiously Optimistic</p>
<p>Oregon Lottery manager of gaming products Lyndsey Peterson used the opportunity to laud the developer’s expertise and long history of success, expressing hope that the new machines would have a positive impact. Peterson also reiterated the Lottery’s focus on operational flexibility and continued relevance.</p>
<p>Light &amp; Wonder Northwest sales director Jason Ashmann was likewise optimistic regarding the partnership, noting that the Lottery was a trusted long-time VLT provider. With years of expertise, the organization knows how to make the most of Light &amp; Wonder’s advanced products and integrate them into its existing ecosystem.</p>
<p>Expanding our long-standing relationship… introduces new experiences, technology, and content that will capture attention and appeal to a broad range of (players)… Jason Ashmann, Light &amp; Wonder Northwest sales director</p>
<p>If the trial run proves successful, the Oregon Lottery plans to replace a significant portion of its ageing hardware. The previous deal with IGT saw the organization install over 11,500 new machines, so a number in that ballpark would not be unrealistic. Even the limited trial run should still be mutually beneficial. It will allow Light &amp; Wonder to gather valuable data on their new machines while giving the Oregon Lottery sufficient time to decide whether to commit and purchase more of these top-of-the-line cabinets.</p>
