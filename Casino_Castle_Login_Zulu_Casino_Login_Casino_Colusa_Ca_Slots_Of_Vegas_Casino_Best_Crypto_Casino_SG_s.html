<p>On Wednesday, Scientific Games announced that its vice president of global responsible gambling, Carla Schaefer, has been appointed to the board of directors of the National Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG). The lottery industry professional, who has 36 years of experience in the said industry, is also heading Scientific Games’ Healthy Play program, which provides resources to lotteries to help them raise awareness among their players about gambling problems and addiction.</p>

Prior to her current position, she served as a regional vice president, international business development, vice president of new business development, and managing director, among others.</p>
<p>Keith Whyte, who serves as an executive director of NCPG, commented that the council is “thrilled” about Schaefer joining its board of directors. Whyte added that as Schaefer has a vast experience in the lottery sector, she would bring “corporate and social responsibility” to NCPG, which would benefit all shareholders.</p>
