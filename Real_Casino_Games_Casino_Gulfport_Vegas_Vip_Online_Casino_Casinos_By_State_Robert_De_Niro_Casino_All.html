    <h1>Real Casino Games Casino Gulfport Vegas Vip Online Casino Casinos By State Robert De Niro Casino All</h1>

<p>Casino Guru News had the pleasure of speaking with three distinct specialists in the field of responsible gambling and problem gambling right in time for Safer Gambling Week 2023. Our discussion focused on Customer Care and whether the industry has grown over the past weeks.</p>
<p>Our guest speakers are Kevin Oâ€™Neill from Responsible Gaming Foundation, David Richardson from Better Change, and Maris Catania from Integrity Analytics. The discussion focuses on the state of customer care today and whether companies have been hitting the mark, especially at a time of heightened regulatory and consumer scrutiny.</p>
<p>Although progress has been made, there are more avenues of opportunity to be explored. Apart from the blanket solutions the industry has been working on, our interlocutors also emphasized some of the additional measures and tools that can be implemented for customer care to hit its mark.</p>
<p>Community programs for one have been improving, but they are not always readily available. Above all else, for good customer care in the gambling industry to succeed, it must really permeate the culture of an operator.</p>
<p>Safer gambling should be a part of the onboarding process and be frequently reinforced. Our speakers are honest about their interactions with operators and that there have been times when companies would fail to understand the importance of following advice from well-versed safer gambling experts.</p>
<p>The webinar is well worth watching in its entirety so make sure you give it a go.</p>
