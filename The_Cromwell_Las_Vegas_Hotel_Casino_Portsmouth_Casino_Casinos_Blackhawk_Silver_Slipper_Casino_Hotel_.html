<p>The latest monthly revenue numbers from the Indiana Gaming Commission (IGC) show some good and bad news.</p>

However, taxable revenue generated by the state’s 12 casinos has decreased the past three months. (Image: Carol Highsmith/Library of Congress)</p>
<p>We’ll start with the good. The figures for June, released this past week, ended the 2021-22 fiscal year. Not only was the $689 million in tax revenue more than $107 million – or 18.2% – better than the 2020-21 fiscal year, it also was the best return for the state in nine years, when it collected $752.4 million, according to IGC data.</p>
<p>It’s the first time Indiana collected more than $600 million in total gaming taxes since it received $602.4 million in 2017-18.</p>
<p>In June, Indiana collected $60.1 million in wagering taxes from the 12 licensed commercial casinos. That pushed the total wagering tax for the year to $606.1 million.</p>
<p>The $60.1 million tax was based on taxable adjusted gross receipts of $188.7 million for the casinos in June.</p>
<p>Hard Rock Northern Indiana, the land-based casino in Gary that opened in May 2021, led all the Indiana casinos with $31.4 million in AGR for the month. Horseshoe Hammond, another Northwest Indiana venue, was second with an AGR of $28.3 million. Horseshoe Indianapolis, a racino in Shelbyville, reported $23 million, and Caesars Southern Indiana finished the month with $19.6 million.</p>
<p>Indiana Sports Betting Handle, Tax Revenue Rise</p>
<p>In addition to the wagering tax, which is a progressive tax based on revenues generated by each casino, Indiana also gets a share of the supplemental tax, a $3 tax for each admission that’s split evenly between the state, the casino’s host city, and its host county. The state also levies a 9.5% tax on sports betting revenues.</p>
<p>Speaking of sports, Indiana reported a total handle of $256.3 million from its licensed sportsbooks in June. That’s $10 million more than what was bet in June 2021, according to IGC data.</p>
<p>Compared to May, the handle fell by nearly $52 million. That’s expected, though, since the basketball season ended in early June, and the only regular action now is baseball and golf.</p>
<p>While betting increased slightly for the month compared to last year, the sportsbooks found less money in their pockets. June’s taxable AGR was $15.8 million, or $9.6 million less than June 2021. It’s also nearly $14.9 million less than the sportsbooks won in May.</p>
<p>Online wagering accounted for 93.1% of the June handle, with FanDuel and DraftKings being easily the top two books in the state. FanDuel’s online app reported a handle of $79.4 million and revenues of $5.5 million, while DraftKings took $70.8 million in bets and won $3.3 million.</p>
<p>The state’s sportsbooks took more than $4.43 billion in wagers for the 21-22 fiscal year. That’s up from the $2.9 billion wagered in 2020-21. While football reigns supreme in most sports betting states, Hoosiers love their hardwood action. Basketball accounted for $1.29 billion of the wagers, according to the IGC.</p>
<p>Parlay wagers made up another $1.16 billion, while Hoosier gamblers (and those trekking in from neighboring states) placed $776 million in football bets.</p>
<p>Indiana collected $31.2 million in sports wagering taxes for the 21-22 fiscal year. That’s an increase of 37.4% from the $22.7 million the state received last year.</p>
<p>Casino Revenues Fall as Inflation Rises</p>
<p>Now, on to the bad news for Indiana. Casino revenues fell for the third consecutive month in June.</p>
<p>The IGC report shows that casinos won $197.2 million last month before free play and other deductions. That represents a nearly 7% decline from the $211.9 million the casinos won in May.</p>
<p>June’s figure is also down more than 16% from the $235.2 million casinos reported in March.</p>
<p>The three consecutive declines at area casinos come as inflation reaches levels the US has not seen in more than 40 years. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics reported a 9.1% annual inflation rate for June. That’s the highest the country has seen since November 1981.</p>
<p>Inflation has had a tremendous impact on prices for food and gas and other products consumers need regularly. According to Mastercard SpendingPulse, spending on fuel and convenience goods went up 55.7% in June, compared to pre-pandemic June 2019 figures. Grocery spending over the same time frame is up 24.8%.</p>
