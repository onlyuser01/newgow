    <h1>Monopoly Casino Firekeepers Casino Michigan New No Deposit Casino Live Dealer Casino Saratoga Casino</h1>

<p>Well, after some recommendations I decided myself to try this casino Goldwin and proceeded to the payment of 129.08 GBP if I'm not wrong but for some reason I forgot to modify the expiry date of the card autofilled by Google mistakenly this time, so the transaction never went through. My app warned be through notifications about some wrong expiration date and I also checked the transaction in the app and there was a name called Arowanatree Shenzhen which made me think its from China so I said to myself, thanks God that transaction never went through.</p>
<p>Then I asked for the explanations regarding that name on the chat and they said that might have been because of VPN which indeed was left activated. Then, I made another transaction of only 16.01 GBP to check whether is true and purposely mistyped the expiration date so the transaction will never go through and the same wierd and suspicious name(merchant) appeared. Then I decided to let that casino away forever.</p>
<p>Then, while I was looking for another casino, Monese app warned me again that maybe I have the wrong date and I was...wtf, I've never had any other attempt to deposit but it seems they had without my authorization.They tried to take 15.58 GBP. Then, around 5 am another transaction attempt with a bigger amount this time of 125.44 GBP and thanks God that was the last attempt so far!</p>
<p>I have all the proofs with the amounts and times of the transactions. The first two was made by myself but the other 2 I'm not aware about because I sent that casino to hell on my casinos priority list and still it happened ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…</p>
<p>So, guys please be aware because you risk to come across a dodgy and rogue casino that will save your card details and clear your bank account!!</p>
