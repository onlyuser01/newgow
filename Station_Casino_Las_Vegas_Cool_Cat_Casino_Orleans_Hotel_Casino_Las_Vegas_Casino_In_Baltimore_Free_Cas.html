<p>Tiger Rush review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Tiger Rush feels misnamed. The word "rush" suggests a tone of frenetic action. Instead, Tiger Rush is set in a mist-softened bamboo forest with calming sound effects and beautiful contemplative art.</p>
<p>The game’s low volatility adds to the sense of isolated calm since low volatility games result in much fewer sudden changes of fortune.</p>
<p>Into this calming forest the player ventures, hunting for the intricate works of jade art that make up the symbols on the reels. These symbols and setting all add up to a zen-like tone far different from the majority of East Asian themed slots which tend to focus on golden bling, the colour red, and dragons.</p>
<p>Tiger Rush excels in the visual department</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The graphics are near perfect in Thunderkick's Tiger Rush. Each symbol is a clear simple whole but is made up of intricately decorated parts.</p>
<p>The animations take a similar approach, each is a fairly simple and easy to read complete unit. However, each one is made up of several carefully chosen phases.</p>
<p>The music is almost ambient in tone, with light percussion sounds that are matched well to the win and spin sound effects.</p>
<p>Overall, the design works together flawlessly to create a coherent and tranquil atmosphere.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Tiger Rush is built on a classic five reel, three row format. This changes in the bonus game to a 3-5-5-5-3 format. There are ten win lines in the base game and twenty five in the bonus game.</p>
<p>In addition to its shape-shifting reels, the game also plays with both way win lines. This means that winning combinations can start at either the leftmost or rightmost reel.</p>
<p>There is no gamble feature and only one bonus feature – a simple free spin bonus game.</p>
<p>You can win both ways in Tiger Rush slot</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Bonus symbol and only appears on reels two to four. When the Wild lands, it expands to fill the whole reel. Once winnings have been calculated, the player receives a free spin with the Wild locked in place.</p>
<p>The Scatter symbol appears on only the first and last reel. If you land two Scatters in a spin – or one Scatter with an adjacent Wild – the Bonus game is then triggered. You get ten free spins for each trigger combination you manage to hit.</p>
<p>During the Bonus game, the middle three reels expand to be five rows tall each, and additional win lines are added to bring it up to twenty five win lines.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.30%, which is a little over our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.10 up to a maximum of $/£/€100.00 per spin.</p>
<p>Top symbols paytable for Tiger Rush slot machine</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is low, bordering on medium. This makes it a poor match for our preferred slot machine strategies which target high volatility slots.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Tiger Rush is a simple slot to play and it extends its philosophy of simplicity out into each of its features. Everything is lovingly crafted with attention paid to the details without overcomplicating the main features.</p>
<p>Its major problem for us is that it is a low to medium volatility slot. As a result, it is no good to a player using our preferred strategies.</p>
