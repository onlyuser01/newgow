    <h1>Casino In St Ignace Hollywood Casino Concerts Hollywood Casino Buffet Casino Theme Party Stratospher</h1>

<p>Scout Gaming Group continues on a journey where responsible gambling is front and center and consumers’ well-being matters. Part of this journey is the company’s choice of a new partner in the face of GBG.</p>
<p>GBG, a firm that focuses on affordability screening for players and whether they can afford to spend on gambling, is joining Scout to offer reliable, industry-recognized solutions that protect consumers.</p>
<p>Scout will be able to benefit from GBG’s identity verification and affordability checks as well as anti-fraud measures that allow the company to quickly and reliably verify whether a player is at risk of developing an addiction or overspending.</p>
<p>GBG primarily focuses on whether players are gaming within their means by using a core set of data, including what’s submitted by players but also the area’s average property value based on the postcode of each player, as one of many factors used.</p>
<p>The idea of assessing risk based on postcode (among other methods of identification) is not alien, nor does it lack substance. The borough of Knowsley in the United Kingdom is dubbed “the gambling capital” of the country where addiction and economic morose are statistics.</p>
<p>Automating the Affordability Process for Competitive Edge</p>
<p>To help ensure that only players who can afford gambling are participating in similar activities, Scout Gaming uses established benchmarks for Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) practices.</p>
<p>GBG assists partners with verifications by using an automated and trusted solution known as IDScan. The tool makes it easy for partners to automatically verify the identity of players. Commenting on this partnership, Scout Gaming CPO Andreas Sundal said that the company remains committed to upholding the highest compliance standards:</p>
<p>“GBG’s extensive experience in the sector and its smart technology, allows us to deliver exactly that while making it easier to maintain, manage and improve our KYC and AML processes.” Scout Gaming CPO Andreas Sundal</p>
<p>GBG gaming sector specialist and business development manager Amy Watkins welcomed the partnership between the two companies and argued that GBG’s automated process of identity verification gives an edge to companies as well as helps better protect consumers in what she described as a “fiercely competitive gaming sector.”</p>
<p>Scout Gaming has been forging ahead with entries into new markets. In October, the company broke ground in Brazil through Betano, and most recently, Scout introduced the FanTeam DFS platform in the United States.</p>
