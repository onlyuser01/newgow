<p>Working with the F1 Las Vegas Grand Prix is a great opportunity for Aristocrat, which has been expanding its presence in sports</p>
<p>Aristocrat Gaming, a global gaming content and technology company, has entered into a partnership with the Formula 1 Heineken Silver Las Vegas Grand Prix. Under the agreement, the gambling supplier’s machines will become the event’s official slot machines.</p>
<p>The Stakes Have Never Been Higher</p>
<p>The partnership, which is the latest in a string of deals for Aristocrat Gaming, represents yet another opportunity for the company to expand its presence in professional sports.</p>
<p>The Formula 1 Heineken Silver Las Vegas Grand Prix event will take place on November 16-18 this year. Many expect it to be one of the most exciting Formula 1 experiences yet. The racing will take place on the famed Las Vegas Strip, providing fans with an unforgettable show from the sports and entertainment capital of the world.</p>
<p>The track for the event will be 3.8 miles long and will go past many of the city’s best-known places. This will include notable casinos, landmarks and hotels.</p>
<p>A Great Opportunity for Aristocrat</p>
<p>Emily Prazer, chief commercial officer for the Formula 1 Heineken Silver Las Vegas Grand Prix, commented on the agreement with Aristocrat Gaming. She said that the opportunity to introduce the F1 experience to a new city is an exciting one. Because of that, her team was convinced that it needed to join forces with a local brand that shares its mission to enhance the guest experience through innovation and technology.</p>
<p>Aristocrat aligns perfectly with our values and vision for the 2023 race, and we are excited for the start of what we believe will be a seamless partnership. Emily Prazer, CCO, Formula 1 Heineken Silver Las Vegas Grand Prix</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mark Wadley, Aristocrat Gaming’s chief marketing officer, noted that Las Vegas is famed for its gambling and entertainment offerings. The opportunity to welcome the Formula 1 Heineken Silver Las Vegas Grand Prix as a partner will provide Aristocrat with tons of opportunities to grow its brand.</p>
<p>This event will be like no other and we look forward to inviting interested F1 fans to play our great lineup of entertaining slot games that match the excitement on the track. Mark Wadley, CMO, Aristocrat Gaming</p>
<p>The new agreement comes in the wake of several deals Aristocrat Gaming has recently struck. In 2021, the company penned an agreement with the NFL to build NFL-themed slot machines that are expected to hit the market this autumn.</p>
<p>In other news, Aristocrat Gaming recently made quite a few notable appointments, welcoming Joe Kaminkow as CIO and Sally Denby as CFO.</p>
