    <h1>Island Reels Casino Century Casino Cape Girardeau Bear River Casino Hotel San Miguel Casino Seneca H</h1>

<p>I have deposited money with this casino before and I receive emails with free chips to play so I used the 10 free chip and got my winnings up to $100 so I tried to withdraw the money. It showed that it was processing my withdrawal for over 24 hours so I messaged the customer service reps and she told me that I need to authenticate my account and sent me the email to do that by taking a copy of my ID and utility bill and sending it back to them. So I did this and then I messaged them again and they said it would take up to 5 days to get it checked by their site but then they would send the funds. So I said okay, Well later on I checked on the process by visiting the site and it showed the funds were no longer being processed but the money wasn't in my account nor in my Bitcoin account so I messaged again and they said they could take the money because it had been over 30 days since my last deposit and that I was basically robbed of the money I won and tough luck theirs nothing I can do about it because they said it was in the terms but I had looked before I cashed out and couldn't find any stipulation saying that before I withdrew the money. They should have something staying all of their rules and terms listed for players when they go to withdraw showing what you can or can't do before you do it instead of just taking people's money and not giving them any sort of compensation or warning. It's very unethical and basically robbery if you ask me. This site should be shut down for good.</p>
