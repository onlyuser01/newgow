    <h1>Holland Casino Casino Charlotte Nc Casino Jack Casinos In Baltimore Maryland Casino Az Evoplay launc</h1>

<p>Evoplay, the innovative developer of interactive and award-winning iGaming content, has signed a new content partnership. Moving forward, Evoplay will be working with Novibet, and provide the brand licensed by the Malta Gaming Authority with market-leading solutions that are set to appeal to players of all backgrounds.</p>
<p>Evoplay has an MGA-certified portfolio that presently numbers 62 titles, 52 of which are specifically developed in the video slot vertical and another 10 which are developed as instant games for online operators. The present partnership benefits both parties as it allows Evoplay to grow its footprint with new operators while also reinforcing Novibet’s own market presence. However, Novibet has known some difficulties, too, with the company withdrawing from the UK market in February this year.</p>
<p>Evoplay will gain additional exposure to popular options such as Fruit Super Nova 100 and Eleven Princesses, among others, with both games launching with Novibet’s Irish and MGA-licensed platforms. Novibet is also a long-standing member of the iGaming industry in Europe. It has been around for years, allowing the company to gather momentum and establish itself as a trusted party on numerous markets.</p>
<p>Novibet presently offers more than 5,000 online casino games and a sport betting platform. The addition of Evoplay is a continuation of the operator's long-term ambitions to deliver on outstanding experience and products.</p>
<p>Commenting on this new partnerships, Evoplay CCO Vladimir Malakchi said that the supplier was delighted to be joining hands with Novibet and collaborate on this new content opportunity. He added:</p>
<p>"The deal sees us expand in key markets across Malta, as well as establish ourselves in Ireland – with the country’s online market reporting a consistent level of growth across 2022."</p>
<p>Expectedly, the partnership was welcomed with equal zest by Novibet casino manager Fotini Matthaiou who offered his praise to Evoplay’s portfolio of captivating content. Matthaiou confirmed that the company always seeks to add content that meets Novibet’s own specific performance criteria for engaging content and player experiences.</p>
<p>Casino Guru News interviewed Evoplay CEO Ivan Kravchuk back in May who shared some of the company’s development strategies, describing the process of innovating iGaming as an "infinite game." Evoplay continues to be one of the most prominent developers in its field as it has been recognized as one of the most innovative developers at the SBC Awards in 2022, winning the Innovation in Casino Entertainment award.</p>
