<p>The deal will help Spinberry expand its reach since SlotMatrix is one of the biggest aggregation platforms on the market</p>
<p>EveryMatrix, a business-to-business online casino platform provider, has enhanced its SlotMatrix portfolio with content from Spinberry, a multi-channel games studio.</p>
<p>Under the agreement, Spinberry will become an exclusive SlotMatrix partner. As a result, its player-first portfolio of cutting-edge titles will be onboarded to the aggregator’s offering of real money games.</p>
<p>Spinberry is most popular for its player-centric approach. The studio creates experiences that bring value for money. The company leverages key session behavior metrics to engage players.</p>
<p>Thanks to the agreement, SlotMatrix’s partnering operators will be able to enhance its offerings with games that are unique and engaging. Thanks to features such as the industry-first Feature Spin, Spinberry’s players can rapidly activate various mechanics. In addition to that, the studio offers a plethora of stake bands and RTP settings, providing operators with an extra level of customization.</p>
<p>The Agreement Will Expand EveryMatrix’s Aggregation Platform</p>
<p>The agreement was commented on by Ashley Bloor, EveryMatrix’s head of operations RGS games. She praised Spinberry’s team for developing so many varied and successful games. Bloor noted that the special features of the developer’s titles are sure to appeal to EveryMatrix partners.</p>
<p>Spinberry have developed a variety of successful games with compelling themes and proprietary features that will appeal to a host of our SlotMatrix operator partners. We’re delighted to have them on board and look forward to working closely with them. Ashley Bloor, head of operations RGS games, EveryMatrix</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Stuart Pounder, MD of Spinberry, said that the deal will cement EveryMatrix as one of Spinberry’s trusted partners. This will allow his company to expand its reach and provide content to more operators than ever before since SlotMatrix is one of the biggest aggregation platforms on the market.</p>
<p>Pounder concluded that his team is “very excited” to see where this partnership goes.</p>
<p>SlotMatrix is EveryMatrix’s B2B content aggregation division. It specializes in offering relevant game content to operators that can be seamlessly integrated into any gaming platform. This allows operators to start generating revenue right away.</p>
<p>SlotMatrix offers content from EveryMatrix’s proprietary studios, Armadillo and Spearhead, as well as a vast range of games developed by third parties.</p>
<p>A week ago, EveryMatrix penned a similar deal with Rogue, adding its content to SlotMatrix. In March, EveryMatrix onboarded gaming content from Bang Bang Games, once again enriching its portfolio.</p>
<p>Last month, on the other hand, EveryMatrix managed to secure a license in Connecticut, further expanding its US reach.</p>
