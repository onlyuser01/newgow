    <h1>Max Casino Olg Stage At Fallsview Casino Casino In Laughlin Nv Hoteles Casino What Casinos Can You G</h1>

<p>I was playing a slot and I was betting .0005btc. I go to hit the spin button again and it said I was out of money. I knew that wasn’t possible. So I went to my bet log and it said I made a .003, then a .0003 bet. I never switch my bet. The bet still read .0005. I looked before checking my net history. I’m careful not to change my bet on accident. I did not place those bets at that price. I’m 100% sure. I have made around 500,000usd worth of bets at the casino in the last few months and have never bet at that price. If you were to look at my log it is obvious something happened. I go to customer service about it and they tell me sorry about my bad streak, that there is nothing they can do about it. I then threaten to start writing reviews and I get a little bit of a response but still haven’t heard a proper answer. They fixed the last problem I had with the casino. On Wild diamond x7 I would hit bonus spins and it would kick me out of the game and not let me back in. It did it twice and there solutions was to pay me the money for the bets which was basically nothing. Those 18 bonus spins at .001btc would of made me 100x what they gave me.</p>
