    <h1>Hard Rock Casino Ft Lauderdale Casino Max No Deposit Bonus Carnival Casino Players Club How To Play</h1>

<p>The international break is over and it’s time for a brand-new round of the 2022-23 Premier League. Several hot matchups are scheduled for this weekend, including Newcastle vs. Manchester United, which is taking place at St. James’ Park on Sunday, April 2, 2023</p>
<p>You can think of the Newcastle vs. Manchester United game as a battle for the top 4 finish in the Premier League. The Red Devils are 3rd in the standings, but they got just two points more than the 5th-placed Newcastle. Tottenham is in-between, but the Spurs have troubles of their own – they’ve just sacked Antonio Conte as their manager.</p>
<p>Knowing all this, the clash on Sunday could prove crucial for the teams involved, meaning that their players will be 100% motivated. Plus, their coaches have had more than two weeks to prepare for the game, which means we could see some new tactics being employed by Newcastle and Manchester United.</p>

<p>The Magpies Putting Hopes in Their Defensive Wall</p>
<p>Newcastle is 12-11-3 (47 points) this season in the Premier League, with a score differential of 39-19. The Magpies haven’t scored too many goals, but their defense is the best in the league. They’re conceding just 0.73 goals per game on average.</p>
<p>Their defensive stats are even better when it comes to home games. At St. James’ Park, they’ve conceded just 9 goals in 13 games played this season, which accounts for 0.69 goals per game.</p>
<p>Defense isn’t something that should concern them too much ahead of the game with the Red Devils. The offense, however, could be a problem. The thing is that scoring goals is their Achilles’ heel in 2023, and things might become even worse if their scoring leader Miguel Almiron doesn’t recover from an injury soon.</p>
<p>The man who’s scored 11 goals for Newcastle in the 2022-23 EPL is almost certainly going to miss Sunday’s game. Unfortunately for the Magpies, he’s not the only one. Ryan Fraser is also out, the same as Anthony Gordon.</p>
<p>Manchester United Going to Tyneside to Grab All 3 Points</p>
<p>This is a must-win game for the Red Devils, not because they need points, but because they need a morale boost. The thing is that their impressive form came to an end on March 5, when Liverpool obliterated them 7-0.</p>
<p>After the humbling defeat, they played another EPL game, but failed again. This time, they drew 0-0 with bottom-placed Southampton. Those two were embarrassing results for Erik Ten Haag and his men, but they haven’t caused too much of a problem for Man United in the Prem. The Red Devils are still flying high in the top English flight.</p>
<p>But they mustn’t slip again! In fact, they need a win to boost their confidence as they still have a lot of hard work to do this season. We’re not just talking about their EPL campaign, but also about the FA Cup (where they’ve reached the semifinal stage), and the Europa League (in which they’ve made it to the ¼-finals).</p>
<p>Newcastle vs. Manchester United Prediction</p>
<p>The Red Devils shouldn’t feel threatened by Newcastle’s offense. Instead, the key to winning Sunday’s game for them is to find a way to the Magpies’ net. Luckily, they’ve got players who can do such a thing. Marcus Rashford, Bruno Fernandes, Antony, and all the others definitely have what it takes to find the net at least once.</p>
<p>Pick: Manchester United to win</p>
