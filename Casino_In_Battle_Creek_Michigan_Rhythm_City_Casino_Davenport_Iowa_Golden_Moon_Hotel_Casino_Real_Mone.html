<p>Gamingtec, a leading provider of content and solutions for the iGaming industry, has expanded its long list of partner studios with the addition of Apollo Games, a respected developer in the online casino vertical, the companies announced in an email press release.</p>
<p>The addition of Apollo Games is hailed as a significant milestone for the turnkey provider of gaming solutions. Thanks to this tie-up, Gamingtec partner casinos and operators will have access to a significant number of new premium games developed by Apollo Games which has a strong reputation and tradition for building robust products that meet player expectations and deliver innovative tech.</p>
<p>Apollo Games has designed and launched numerous games, such as Rich Kittens, Midnight Fruits 81, and not least Bonus Joker II, all of which are established as player-favorite games that will now be available directly through a Gamingtec integration. Apollo Games pushes the envelope of known iGaming technology even further as the studio has created its proprietary progressive jackpots unified under the Apollo Jackpot system.</p>
<p>Commenting on this opportunity, Apollo Games Head of Commercial for iGaming, Robert Mikudik, welcomed the chance to be working closely with Gamingtec. Mikudik explained that Gamingtec is the technology company behind some of the biggest operators in multiple regions, not least Europe, Latin America, and Africa.</p>
<p>Therefore, the current alliance makes perfect sense for the supplier which is looking to further strengthen its position in these regions, existing jurisdictions, and new markets. Gamingtec Commercial Director Andrei Beu was even happier to pursue this partnership, arguing that the platform already features more than 10,000 slots provided by some of the most prominent developers in the iGaming industry.</p>
<p>Beu praised the quality of the Apollo Games products. "Its games stand out in any operator lobby and its innovative jackpot feature means high levels of anticipation and excitement with each spin," he said. Beu was confident that thanks to partnerships such as these, Gamingtec remains a step ahead of other turnkey platforms in the long term.</p>
<p>Gamingtec has indeed partnered with multiple prominent suppliers. Presently, the company has ties with leading studios, such as Pragmatic Play, NetEnt, Quickspin, and more tier-one developers in the industry.</p>
