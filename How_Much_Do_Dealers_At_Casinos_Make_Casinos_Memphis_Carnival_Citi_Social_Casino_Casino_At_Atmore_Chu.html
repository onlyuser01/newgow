<p>Candy Tower review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>This game is themed around colourful candy.</p>
<p>In a whimsical fantasy land, players will find themselves surrounded by desserts and sweets. On a reel of brightly- hued hard candies, they’ll try to snag as many matching clusters as they can.</p>
<p>This slot is a great pick for players looking for an upbeat atmosphere and fantasy aesthetic. Some fruit machine and gem slot fans may especially appreciate the plentiful colours and tempting treats.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The background is a chill tune punctuated with beeps, adding a touch of sci-fi sensibility to the vibe. The soundtrack can easily be muted but many players will enjoy the relaxing music.</p>
<p>The reels spin with a light click and wins are celebrated with bells and chiming. This keeps the mood festive.</p>
<p>Beside the reels, a small personified cupcake watches the gameplay and cheers when players win. This character adds a friendly touch and their cherry hat makes them particularly cute.</p>
<p>Behind the reels, players will see a stack of pancakes and a slice of cake as tall as buildings. The imaginative animation of this candy world encourages players to let out their inner child.</p>
<p>The reels themselves are filled with candies in a range of shapes and colours including red hearts and violet flowers. It’s not hard to imagine these sweets having mouthwatering fruity flavours.</p>
<p>Overall, the graphics and music combine to create a fun fantasy atmosphere.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Candy Tower is a six reel, five row slot.</p>
<p>Wins are awarded for landing 7 or more matching symbols in a cluster. To be part of a winning cluster, symbols must be connected horizontally or vertically.</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter symbol. The Wild symbol will land on reels 2, 4, and 6 during the base game, but on reels 1-6 during the Free Spins feature.</p>
<p>Wild symbols are allowed to be part of more than one winning cluster, and they may also pay when not part of any group.</p>
<p>The Wild Drop feature may be triggered at random and will drop between 3 and 10 Wild symbols onto rows 3-5.</p>
<p>A number of boost features may be activated as players collect set numbers of matching symbols. These boost bonuses will include expanding symbols, extra Wilds, cash prizes, and multipliers.</p>
<p>The Scatter symbol may pay out anywhere on the reels.</p>
<p>When players land 3 or more Scatter symbols, this will trigger the Free Spins feature, starting with 10 free games. If players land 4 Scatter symbols, they’ll receive 15 free games. Should they land 5 Scatter symbols, they’ll be awarded 50 free games.</p>
<p>The Free Spins feature can be retriggered.</p>
