    <h1>888 Casino Review Choctaw Casino Resort Durant Durant Ok New Vegas Casinos Black Hawk Hotel And Casi</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I registered and made a deposit with Lunaslots. After I played and lost my money, I found 100 free spins in my account, which I used immediately. I won approximately €6. Unfortunately, I don't remember the exact amount as my balance was subsequently reset to €0. I can't find the money I won either in my cash balance or in my bonus balance, so where is it? I posed this question to the Lunaslots' support, who responded after 6 hours (although it says they would respond in 2-3 minutes in the chat window). They mentioned that I currently have no active withdrawals and that I should provide proof of address. When I repeated my question about where the money I won was, I got the same standard response regarding no active withdrawals and proof of address. In response, I threatened to raise the issue with Casino Guru and repeated my question one more time. After many hours, I finally received a reply in English stating that this issue was due to an emergency maintenance. They suggested that I should delete cookies and clear the cache if I have problems with winning amounts in the future. My question about where the money was, however, went unanswered again. Instead, the reply suggested that everything is now in order. Upon logging back into Lunaslots, I discovered that the money is still not visible anywhere. If I try to access my gaming history or my bonus history, I receive error messages. Even though it's a small amount, I would appreciate any assistance with clarifying this matter.</p>
<p>Thank you for your efforts,</p>
<p>Daniel</p>
