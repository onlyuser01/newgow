<p>After parsing data from nearly 361,000 reviews, online travel company TripAdvisor ranked the top 50 US casinos and the news is good for Wynn Resorts.</p>

<p>The Wynn Las Vegas and the neighboring Encore took the top two spots, according to TripAdvisor. The eponymous Wynn landed 18,874 five-star ratings out of 25,166 reviews, good for 75 percent, reports BusinessInsider. Encore wasn’t far behind, netting five-star reviews on 74.41 percent of its ratings.</p>
<p>Wynn’s current standing on TripAdvisor is 4.5 out of five. The Strip property earns a perfect five for cleanliness and marks of 4.5 for location, service and value.</p>
<p>When in Vegas, I won’t stay anywhere else,” said one TripAdvisor reviewer of the Wynn. “Place speaks of luxury, everywhere. Bed is maybe the most comfortable ever, could use a couple more normal size pillows, but that is a minor note. Bathroom is nice and plenty of space. Shower is great and huge bathtub. View on the strip side is amazing.”</p>
<p>Encore also earned a perfect score of five for cleanliness and 4.5 ratings for location, service and value among TripAdvisor customers.</p>
<p>Encore Boston Harbor, which opened on June 23 as Wynn’s newest US property, was not part of the TripAdvisor top 50 due to the venue’s recent debut.</p>
<p>Vegas Disappoints in Results</p>
<p>Sin City is the undisputed gaming center of the US and home to more high-end integrated resorts than any other region, but the city did not dominate the TripAdvisor top 50. Ten Las Vegas properties, or just 20 percent, made the list.</p>
<p>Following Wynn and Encore, the next highest-rated Vegas casino was the Palazzo, a Las Vegas Sands establishment, at number six. Palazzo’s sister property, the Venetian ranked 16 among TripAdvisor users. Just over 70 percent of those that chimed in on the Palazzo gave the venue five-star reviews.</p>
<p>Caesars Entertainment Corp.’s Cromwell was just outside the top 10 at number 11. After the Venetian at 16, the next most praised Strip integrated resort was the Cosmopolitan in the 20th spot.</p>
<p>MGM Resorts is the largest operator on the Strip, but TripAdvisor visitors ranked a hotel outside of Nevada highest from the company’s portfolio. Beau Rivage Resort &amp; Casino in Biloxi, Mississippi ranked third on the list, commanding five-star reviews 73.37 percent of the time.</p>
<p>The highest rated Caesars property on the list was Harrah’s New Orleans in the fifth spot with five-star ratings 70.42 percent of the time from TripAdvisor fans.</p>
<p>Sixteen Silver State hotels cracked the top 50 while just two Atlantic City properties – MGM’s Borgata at number 41 and Caesars at 49 – were on the list.</p>
<p>Tribal Casinos Score Well</p>
<p>Tribal gaming venues placed well on the TripAdvisor list, occupying more than 30 percent of the spots, but one was the clear leader. The WinStar, owned by Chicksaw Nation, in Thackerville, Okla., garnered 5,481 five-star ratings out of 7,609 TripAdvisor reviews, placing the casino fourth on the list.</p>
<p>The Northern Quest Resort &amp; Casino in Airway Heights, Washington, operated by the Kalispel Tribe of Indians, was the next tribal gaming property on the list at number nine.</p>
