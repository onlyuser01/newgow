<p>Soccer players on an Argentinian team are causing the team and the soccer community unnecessary grief. At least four El Porvenir players are hanging up their cleats after their ejection because of potential match-fixing.</p>

<p>The incident began after El Porvenir goalkeeper Diego Córdoba told the top leader of the club what was happening with some teammates. According to La Nacion, the team, which plays in Argentina’s Primera C division, sent four players allegedly involved packing. However, there could be more to fall.</p>
<p>The four players reportedly received money for swaying the outcome of at least seven games. They were paid for scoring goals against or throwing the ball to a corner a certain number of times.</p>
<p>The board of directors of El Porvenir filed a complaint to a police station in Lanús, Argentina, to launch an investigation. The club president, Enrique Merelas, announced the scandal earlier this week.</p>
<p>Undisclosed Sum</p>
<p>The issue exploded after several players confessed that they had received money to manipulate the games. Teammates who had not participated in the scam kicked them out of the dressing room following the revelations.</p>
<p>So far, the team has not won any matches and is in last place, so their antics didn’t support the team. According to witnesses, there were confusing or unusual occurrences in the athletes’ games that triggered suspicions.</p>
<p>Details regarding how much the players earned are still sketchy. In some instances, they may have received 12,000 pesos (US$108.11), and in others, as much as 100,000 (US$900.90).</p>
<p>Unraveling the Illegal Activity</p>
<p>According to the complaint, one of the players was the link with the illegal bettors. In principle, he was the one who led the group and told the others how to act. If the disciplinary court proves that the players received money, they will not be able to play soccer anymore, in Argentina or anywhere.</p>
<p>It is not the first time El Porvenir has had to deal with a scandal. In 2016, Merelas, in charge of the club for more than 40 years, starred in a fight with several people who demanded his resignation before attacking him physically. The episode required the intervention of the police.</p>
<p>The conflict was reportedly rife with insults and grievances. Police officers arrested one of those who attacked Merelas.</p>
<p>At the end of last year, there was a controversy in the match in which Villa Dalmine hosted Barracas Central in the First National title game. In the visitor’s 3-1 win, accusations flew that several players from Dalmine received bribes not to exert themselves.</p>
<p>That led to a complaint, but the case did not move forward. However, the board of directors terminated the contracts of 16 players after Dalmine finished its participation in the championship.</p>
