    <h1>Largest Casino In The World Mackinaw City Casino Artesian Casino Mt Airy Casino Casinos Bus Schedule</h1>

<p>I registered on Jazzy Spins, and made a £10 deposit, I won £50 and withdrew it, I then deposited another £10 and won £145 which I then withdrew, 48 hours later there was no sign of the withdrawal in my bank, I then received an email stating "Self Exclusion has started". The very definition of self exclusion means it’s an exclusion chosen by me, as it wasn’t chosen by myself, it was an Exclusion.</p>
<p>They told me in the email that any monies owed to me would be sent back to my bank account and told me to email an email address. I contacted them by phone and was laughed at by the customer service representative.</p>
<p>It’s only £195 but I have now chosen to take legal action against their parent company, when I informed them of this, they offered me "a goodwill gesture" of having my initial deposit return. As a matter of principle and morality I declined this offer and informed them that I would see their representative in court. Their parent company will almost certainly win this case, as they have access to a huge team of lawyers and an endless pot of cash, but I will appeal this decision, and spend my own money, regardless of the cost, until it reaches the highest civil court in the UK, until a court with the ability to set a judicial precedent will take the case.</p>
<p>Use reputable casinos, not these casinos which are owned by a foreign company, and only use 888 to operate under their UK license.</p>
