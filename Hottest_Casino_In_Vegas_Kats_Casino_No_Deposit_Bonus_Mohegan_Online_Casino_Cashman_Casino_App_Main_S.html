<p>Golden Dragon Inferno Slot Review</p>
<p>Players looking for a soothing game with a beautiful Eastern Asian theme interrupted by intriguing elements and features can take a look at our Golden Dragon Inferno slot review. Betsoft’s 2022 release is a 5×3 video slot with an impressively high-frequency rate at 71.39% that nurtures more engaging gameplay, and special features and mechanics like Nudging Multiplier Wild Reels, Wild Symbols, Hold &amp; Win Bonuses, and Stacked Mystery Symbols.</p>
<p>The game features 243 ways to win that can bring a virtually unlimited number of winning combinations with each new spin, adding more excitement and charm to the gameplay. The maximum win is up to 5000X the bet. The studio appears to have found the perfect recipe for an authentic, relaxing, and rewarding experience while providing endless chances to keep the reels spinning and the wins pouring.</p>
<p>Theme, Storyline, and Graphics: Stack Your Wins with Each New Spin</p>
<p>The standard Asian theme does not feature any of the strikingly modern, state-of-the-art visual elements you might be used to seeing in other Betsoft titles with a similar theme. This is because the studio most likely intended to give this game a classic feel through the carefully designed theme. It is possible for some to consider the visuals rather weak or dissatisfying since there are no overly-exciting backdrop design elements to admire. Nonetheless, the beautifully crafted red and golden grid specific to Asian culture and the assortment of comic-looking, nicely-designed golden trinkets, and statues do a good job of catching the eye of new players and keeping their interest alive. The Golden Dragon that gives the name of the game also represents good luck, further</p>
<p>Golden Dragon Inferno: Game Symbols and Payouts</p>
<p>To form a winning combination, players need to match a minimum of two identical symbols on consecutive reels, starting with the utmost left reel. The game’s low-paying symbols are represented by the standard cards: Js, Qs, Ks, and As. Coming across five identical low-paying symbols pays 1.60x the bet. The high-paying symbols are the turtle, the golden carp, the ingot, and the smiling Buddha symbol. Players get a payout of 2.40x the bet for matching five identical high-paying symbols on consecutive reels.</p>
<p>Some players might argue that the paytable is not the most appealing to come across. Nonetheless, the high hit frequency rate is a big game changer. Plus, the game also features a Wild symbol that acts like a joker by replacing the rest of the symbols. The red block mystery symbols can also reveal the same symbols while the fireballs with prize values and jackpots tied to them take the role of Scatters.</p>
<p>Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The game’s relaxing soundtrack and sound effects promote and maintain a dreamy Eastern Asian mood while the cheerful and joyful clinking sounds of the machines as the wins start stacking with each new spin nicely complement the atmosphere. The animations might not be the most impressive we have come across lately, as there aren’t many moving symbols on the reels or in the background. However, the excellent audio may suffice for most players looking for a relaxing game to play.</p>
<p>Golden Dragon Inferno Gameplay</p>
<p>Players can easily set their bets using the standard +/- buttons while the easily identifiable spin button will cause the reels to start moving. Players can opt for Autoplay mode to activate the automatic spinning of the reels by quickly selecting the desired number of automated spins (in incremental batches of 10). Turbo mode is also available for faster-paced action, while players are also given full control of the background music and sound effects. The way wins are awarded for adjacent symbol combinations from left to right. Only the highest win per way will pay. At the same time, coinciding wins in different ways are combined.</p>
<p>Golden Dragon Inferno: Stacked Mystery Symbols, Nudging Multiplier Wild Reels &amp; Hold &amp; Win Bonuses</p>
<p>The game is packed with excellent features that are meant to nicely round up players’ payouts, including:</p>
<p>Stacked Mystery Symbols</p>
<p>These symbols can be seen landing on random reels. All their positions are filled with the same symbol on each spin. All symbols with the exception of scatters can be revealed here.</p>
<p>Nudging Multiplier Wild Reel</p>
<p>While engaged in the base game, the golden dragon symbol can be seen popping on the third reel either partially or in its entirety. When a partial dragon is seen nudging up or down to form a full wild reel, it will also reward players with multipliers ranging from 2x, 3x, 5x, 8x, and 10x. Provided the players do not score any wins with the Multiplier Wild Reel, it will remain in place and a free spin will be awarded. This action will only occur once during a single spin.</p>
<p>Hold &amp; Win Bonus</p>
<p>Players who land a minimum of six Scatters will engage the Hold &amp; Win Bonus. Here, the Scatters will remain locked in position and players will get three respins. Each fresh Scatter symbol will also be locked in place while the respins will be reset. The Hold &amp; Win bonus feature will end once no respins will be left or once all 15 positions will be filled by a Scatter symbol. At the end of the round, players will collect all prize values. To get the Grand prize valued at 2000x, a player must land all 15 available Scatter symbols. Mini, Minor, and Major prizes are also available.</p>
<p>Final Thoughts</p>
<p>Players passionate about video slots with a simple design that does not contain too many distracting dynamic visual elements will appreciate Betsoft’s 2022 release. Golden Dragon Inferno features a charming Asian good-luck theme that smartly intertwines classic slot elements with modern-day features for a complete gameplay experience. The game’s potential for generous bonuses, its 243 ways to win, smooth and straightforward gameplay, and rich selection of features are nicely complemented by the carefully chosen soundtrack.</p>
<p>Together, these elements create an appealing title for seasoned players used to the studio’s quality releases, as well as an interesting alternative for newcomers just getting acquainted with everything that the industry has to offer.</p>
