    <h1>Palms Casino Resort Pokerstars Casino Promotions Casino Lake Tahoe Gossip Slots Casino Montego Bay H</h1>

<p>Ladies and Gentlemen</p>
<p>I hereby officially lodge a complaint against the above casino.</p>
<p>It is about 3 missing payments of €2,000 each from December 6th, 2022</p>
<p>FOLLOWING FACTS:</p>
<p>After 9 deposits of €250 each (€2,250) on 12/02/2022, I have in several games until 12/06/2022</p>
<p>Profits amounting to 6.240-€ I made on 06.12. 3 x €2,000 each requested.</p>
<p>For the legitimation check, I had uploaded my identity card and proof of residence to the system... Both of these proofs were approved.</p>
<p>In addition, I received an e-mail saying that I had to submit proof of income as a self-employed person. I got the tax assessments immediately</p>
<p>2019 + 2020 (2021 is only due on February 10th, 2023) - as well as an annual and monthly proof of the income of a client.</p>
<p>As a result, I was complained that I had to upload the associated bank statement - which I first had to request from the bank, but then uploaded directly a day later as well.</p>
<p>Then the next day I received the following email:</p>
<p>" Proof of income (We have received your document but have not yet been able to determine the origin of the funds on deposit with us, so we request that you send us the following documents: -Invoices or certificates of employment for self-employed services from November and December, together with a bank statement showing the shows the income from these services received on the account.)"</p>
<p>I made files available with the note:</p>
<p>"I have uploaded 2 proofs.</p>
<p>1- Proof that I bought my Flexepin credits via paypal - and redeemed them with you.</p>
<ol>
<li>Proof of payment from a customer of mine - who had to pay me €5,000."</li>
</ol>
<p>Then I got on 10.12. following email:</p>
<p>(We have received your documents and note that you have received EUR 5,000.00 from ............, so we request that you provide us with an explanation of the origin of the said transaction together with all documentary Provide evidence supporting your statement. Documents required: A statement of origin of the transaction which he received on 16.11.22 from ............... and any supporting documents, that support the statement.</p>
<p>Of course, I immediately formulated my explanation and uploaded it with evidence:</p>
<p>"I granted my customer a private loan - he paid it back via PayPal.</p>
<p>I have uploaded the acknowledgment of guilt."</p>
<p>Again late Saturday evening I got the following email:</p>
<p>"(We have received your document but have not yet been able to determine the origin of the funds used for the deposit in August and December, as you have not yet sent us proof of your income as a self-employed person, we ask that you send us the following documents : -An explanation of the origin of the funds used to deposit via Flexepin in August and December, along with any documentary evidence supporting the statement -The statement of your savings account dated 01/12/22 to date Statements must be in PDF- format</p>
<p>Today on December 11th. I received an e-mail again with a request to send documents.</p>
<p>Today I had uploaded proof of income over €60,000, which in turn was not devalued as conclusive.</p>
<p>"We have received your documents but they have not allowed us to establish the origin of the funds used to deposit with us via Flexepin in August and on 11/03/22 and 11/04/22. ??</p>
<p>How can you help me ?</p>
<p>My documents are larger than 5mb</p>
