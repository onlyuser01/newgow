<p>$6.3 billion is the estimated annual impact from casinos in Michigan, a research by the American Gaming Association (AGA) shows. The state’s 24 tribal and 3 commercial casinos generate to the extent of $1.3 billion per year in taxes and tribal revenue sharing, supporting 37,911 jobs and $2.1 billion annually in wages.</p>
<p>Casinos Spurred Economic Development in the State</p>
<p>The arrival of casinos in the Great Lakes State fueled the economic resurgence of the city of Detroit and gave resources in the hands of the state’s sovereign tribal nations to create reliable jobs, fund revitalization projects and support not-for-profit organizations within their communities.</p>
<p>“The casinos helped the city of Detroit in many ways, not just by revenue, but by entertainment, by tourism. In my view, it has been a good experience for the city of Detroit.” Brenda Jones, President, Detroit City Council</p>
<p>The three commercial casinos in Detroit are among the largest employers in southeast Michigan. MGM Grand Detroit, MotorCity Casino Hotel, and Greektown Casino provide jobs for approximately 7,600 people, two-thirds of whom come from minorities and half of whom are female.</p>
<p>According to AGA’s estimates, the prolonged period of casino closures in the state resulted into $114.1 million less in gaming taxes for the state and local governments, with $46.8 million being allocated for statewide education purposes and $67.8 million for local initiatives in Detroit, both of which would not materialize now.</p>
<p>The reach of gaming’s commitment to all corners of the local community by maintaining an active presence in local civic life, on top of the generated revenue for local projects and services, is undisputable, the AGA research highlighted, pointing out the time and resources invested by the gaming businesses in helping people in need.</p>
<p>While MotorCity has a long-standing relationship with Mariners Inn, a substance abuse treatment and recovery center, MGM Grand has a history of supporting underprivileged children, with more than 40,000 coats, hats and gloves distributed to Detroit schools and agencies for the past 20 years.</p>
<p>Last but not least, casinos increase the capacity of some nonprofit organizations to serve. Due to commitments from gaming establishments, Gleaners Community Food Bank increased its food distribution from 34 million to 46 million pounds a year.</p>
<p>The casinos that have been closed since mid-March are beginning to re-open August 5, when the property owned by the Illich Family, MotorCity, and Penn National’s Greektown Casino will restart business, while MGM Grand will resume operations August 7.</p>
<p>“Communities across Michigan rely on gaming for good jobs, partnership, and tax revenue. The safe reopening of Michigan’s casinos is vital to getting the Great Lake State back on its feet.” American Gaming Association</p>
