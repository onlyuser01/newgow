<p>Play’n GO, one of the world’s leading iGaming suppliers, has established a new content partnership with Rush Street Interactive and the company’s BetRivers brand and platform. This will allow Play’n GO to continue expanding its footprint in the United States, and North America as well.</p>
<p>The new partnership will see Play’n GO’s signature games arrive on BetRivers’ platform in Michigan and New Jersey and deliver titles such as KISS: Reels of Rock, Rise of Merlin, and Fire Joker to local iGaming crowds. The supplier has plenty of other titles to offer local players, and it’s determined to continue establishing its presence in iGaming markets.</p>
<p>Play’n GO CCO Magnus Olsson was similarly pleased with the opportunity to extend this partnership in the United States and build a successful rapport with Rush Street Interactive, a company that the executive hailed as a leader in the North American market.</p>
<p>He similarly said that this partnership with Rush Street Interactive is an opportunity to further expand the supplier’s reach and demonstrate that iGaming companies can have a clear commitment to player safety and responsibility.</p>
<p>"We’re excited to get started and further enhance the entertainment experience for BetRivers online players," Magnus added. Rush Street Interactive CEO Richard Schwartz was similarly pleased to see Play’n GO join the company’s BetRivers brand and provide its players with innovative and worthwhile experiences.</p>
<p>"We look forward to many years of success together," Schwartz said, arguing that Play’n GO was a partner that made perfect sense. BetRivers has been one of the fastest-growing iGaming brands in North America as well, with the company’s latest tie-up with Play’n GO just one in a series of similar moves designed to significantly strengthen its presence in the market and available game variety.</p>
<p>The company recently secured a similar content partnership with Hacksaw Gaming designed to increase the number of games available. Earlier this year, Play’n GO also obtained a license to provide its products in Connecticut in the United States.</p>
<p>The supplier has been expanding also back in Europe, where it has secured a string of content partnerships with established operators and brands, including William Hill, Casino777.nl, and Sky Betting and Gaming, among others.</p>
