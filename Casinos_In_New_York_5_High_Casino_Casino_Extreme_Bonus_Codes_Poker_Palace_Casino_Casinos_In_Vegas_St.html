<p>The 2022-23 NBA season starts on Tuesday night with the Philadelphia 76ers vs Boston Celtics game. The season opener is played at TD Garden in Boston, which is the place where the Celtics were 28-13 in the regular season in their previous NBA campaign.</p>
<p>One of the 13 home defeats they suffered last season happened to the Philadelphia 76ers. Are we going to see the same scenario play out again? To see what we think, make sure to read our 76ers vs Celtics preview until the very end.</p>

<p>Philadelphia 76ers Look Really Good in 2022</p>
<p>The 76ers have huge ambitions for the 2022-223 NBA season, as evident from the fact that they made a couple of awesome acquisitions during the offseason. P. J. Tucker is arguably their biggest signing of the summer. Even though he’s already 37, the power forward who won the 2021-22 NBA Championship with the Miami Heat is expected to fit right in Philly’s starting five.</p>
<p>Speaking of Philadelphia’s starting five, shooting guard James Harden is going to be there, as well as center Joel Embiid. We also expect to see Tyrese Maxey in the role of the point guard, as well as Tobias Harris as Philly’s small forward.</p>
<p>With these guys on the court, the 76ers definitely look capable of giving the Celtics a run for their money. The question is whether this means they can win the NBA opener in Massachusetts.</p>
<p>Joe Mazzulla to Debut as the Celtics Head Coach</p>
<p>The Eastern Conference champions start their 2022-23 campaign at home. At TD Garden, the Celtics are fantastic. Or should we say, they were fantastic last year when they were led by head coach Ime Udoka. This season, however, he’s going to spend off the court, following suspension for violating the team’s code of conduct (Udoka had an affair with a staff member).</p>
<p>Instead of hi, Joe Mazzulla will get in the hot seat. The 34-year-old previously served as Udoka’s assistant manager, and the 76ers vs Celtics game is going to be his debut as a head coach of an NBA team.</p>
<p>Oddsmakers think it’s going to be a successful debut, but we beg to differ. Despite the fact that pretty much all of Boston’s players from last season are still on the roster, they might not be as good as before.</p>
<p>Philadelphia 76ers vs Boston Celtics Prediction</p>
<p>We think that in the 2022-23 season, the Philadelphia 76ers are the best team in the East. It’s a bold claim, but we’re sure the Sixers will prove us right in the season opener on Tuesday evening. We’re confident they’re going to beat the Celtics. If you don’t share our enthusiasm, backing Philly to cover the three-point spread looks like a great alternative.</p>
<p>Pick: Philadelphia 76ers to win</p>
