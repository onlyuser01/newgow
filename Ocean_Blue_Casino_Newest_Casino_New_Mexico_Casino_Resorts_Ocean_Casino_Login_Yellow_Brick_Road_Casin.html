<p>IGT continues to make considerable progress as an industry leader in global sustainability, CEO Sadusky said</p>
<p>International Game Technology, a world leader in gambling, has published its 2022 Sustainability Report, highlighting the company’s sustainability efforts. The company listed four core sustainability pillars, which include the protection of its people, advancement of responsibility, support for its communities and the fostering of sustainable operations.</p>
<p>“Valuing and Protecting Our People”</p>
<p>IGT pointed out that it fields employees in almost 60 countries, making it a very cosmopolitan company. As a result, the company seeks to respect individuals’ beliefs while protecting human rights and promoting diversity, equity and inclusion.</p>
<p>In 2022, IGT added its Human Rights Policy Statement to employee training. The training has now been completed by 97%+ of the company’s employees. In addition, the company was included in the Human Rights Campaign Foundation’s Corporate Equality Index, which measures the inclusion of LGBT+ people.</p>
<p>Finally, IGT noted that in 2022, it was the first casino and gambling company to sign the UN Women’s Empowerment Principles.</p>
<p>“Advancing Responsibility”</p>
<p>As a global leader in gaming, IGT recognizes the importance of responsibility to its business. The company is therefore bullish on mitigating risk for its customers, employees, players, suppliers and the environment through a system of codes, policies guidelines and practices.</p>
<p>Last year, the company achieved Global Gambling Guidance Group’s responsible gaming accreditation for sports betting, becoming the first US industry supplier to do so.</p>
<p>In addition, IGT adopted a Positive Play approach, encouraging safer gambling across all of its business segments.</p>
<p>“Supporting Our Communities”</p>
<p>IGT prides itself on its sustainable community initiatives. The company operates through corporate and employee-driven programs to facilitate opportunities for support, learning and growth.</p>
<p>In 2022, the gaming giant published its first formal Community Giving and Engagement Policy to inform its stakeholders of its approach to supporting its communities.</p>
<p>In the meantime, IGT’s flagship philanthropic initiative, After School Advantage, provided young people with access to science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) educational opportunities. Thanks to an agreement with the STEM Discovery Centre, the program was also expanded to the UK.</p>
<p>“Fostering Sustainable Operations”</p>
<p>IGT expressed its desire to ensure that its corporate policies and ESG standards apply to its entire value chain. The company is fully committed to addressing its environmental impact and mitigating its effect on climate change, biodiversity and air pollution while increasing circularity.</p>
<p>IGT added that in 2022, it submitted near-term and long-term targets to the Science Based Targets initiative for validation. The company promised to do what it can to reduce its carbon emissions as a way to fight climate change.</p>
<p>In addition, IGT implemented decarbonization workstreams to see how it can reduce GHG emissions.</p>
<p>CEO Sadusky Promises the Efforts Will Continue</p>
<p>IGT’s chief executive officer, Vince Sadusky, said that the current report marks the 16th consecutive year the company has released a Sustainability Report. He noted that this shows how seriously the company takes all initiatives that could have a positive impact on its corporate culture and the planet.</p>
<p>With a strong foundation centered around Sustainable Play and priorities aligned with UN Global Compact principles and Sustainable Development Goals, IGT continues to make considerable progress as an industry leader in global sustainability as we build a more sustainable business for the future.
