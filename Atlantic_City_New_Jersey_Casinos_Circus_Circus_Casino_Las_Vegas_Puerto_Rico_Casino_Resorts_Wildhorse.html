<p>Air Dice and BoyleSports have signed a new online casino games distribution deal for the UK and Ireland</p>
<p>At the start of June, BoyleSports announced it would join Stevenage with a brand-new shop expected to become the best location for local gamblers.</p>
<p>Now, the largest independent sportsbook and online betting company in Ireland has released the news of a freshly inked agreement with the Air Dice Group. The latter is a Finnish online gaming developer specializing in strategy-based games.</p>
<p>Air Dice, Delighted to Work with the Leading Brand</p>
<p>Due to the terms of the new deal, Air Dice’s portfolio of games will reach BoyleSports’ customers in both the United Kingdom and Ireland via the latter’s top-notch platform, following similar partnerships with other popular names in the industry including Unibet, Ladbrokes, and Napoleon Games.</p>
<p>Air Dice MT’s chief executive officer, Victor Borg Barthet, spoke about their thrill to be able to “provide and work with one of Ireland’s and the United Kingdom’s leading gaming brands.”</p>
<p>Barthet also mentioned that his company has “long admired” BoyleSports’ values as a brand, along with their focus on delivering players with the best gaming experiences possible.</p>
<p>Fruit Shifter, Chest Hunter, and Neon Shifter are just a handful of the games featuring innovative mechanics that will become available via BoyleSports.</p>
<p>BoyleSports Praising Air Dice’s Consistency</p>
<p>BoyleSports’ gaming director Steve Payne spoke about Air Dice’s proven consistency as a business that always puts the focus on “player-centric” gambling experiences.</p>
<p>Payne further explained that the current marketplace conditions encourage players to constantly scratch for “engaging and different experiences.” Accordingly, the Irish company anticipates receiving positive feedback from players who gain exclusive access to Air Dice’s content during the pre-scheduled launch period agreed upon by the two parties.</p>
<p>Last week, Air Dice officially received certification for the online casino market in Sweden with the help of Spelinspektionen’s latest business-to-business supplier license scheme.</p>
<p>This makes them one of the first studios to receive the license which stands for a “key milestone” for the group while re-affirming their position as a trustworthy developer.</p>
<p>The group has also secured supplier licenses for the UK with the help of the UK Gambling Commission as well as Malta via the Malta Gaming Authority.</p>
<p>BoyleSports was first launched in 1982. Ever since, the company managed to build its reputation as the country’s largest privately-owned sportsbook, currently counting 340 shops spread across the UK and Ireland and 2,500 employees.</p>
<p>The Air Dice group encompasses three game studios, Air Dice, Dice Crafter, and Probability Jones, all providing a rich plethora of both classic and innovative titles. In mid-May, Air Dice joined Rootz’s prestigious roster of top providers of casino games.</p>
