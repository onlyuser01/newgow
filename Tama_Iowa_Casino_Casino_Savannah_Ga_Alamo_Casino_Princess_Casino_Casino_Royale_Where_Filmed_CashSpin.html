    <h1>Tama Iowa Casino Casino Savannah Ga Alamo Casino Princess Casino Casino Royale Where Filmed CashSpin</h1>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'm really not having much look with overseas online casinos. I deposited around €800 a couple of weeks ago and lost, which I've accepted. You can't win them all! The following day, I was awarded €35 into my Cash Spins Casino account and managed to meet the wagering requirements of the bonus, resulting in a withdrawable win of €200. I submitted my withdrawal request that same day Monday 3rd August, and waited whilst it sat in "Pended" status. I then received an email to say that my request needed to be reviewed by their management team (I'm guessing that this is probably because people don't normally win from their "bonuses") and on Wednesday 5th August, the withdrawal was approved.</p>
<p>I've had issues with receiving withdrawals from Cash Spins Casino before, having to wait a couple of weeks and coming up against unhelpful and sometimes arrogant customer service in the process, so I got in touch with their Live Chat Team on Friday 7th August to see how things were going. I was told by their representative that they would put a word in with their Payments Team and see what could be done about speeding things up, then I left things over the weekend. I've contacted their Live Chat Team every day this week and had been given conflicting information, ranging from "It'll be with you very soon" to "probably today but maybe tomorrow" and most recently "you've been paid out before so don't worry, you'll get paid out again eventually".</p>
<p>I emailed their Support Team yesterday and received the following response this morning, reaffirming the last stance I'd been given by the Live Chat Team, giving me no additional information other than confirming my concerns that they are unable to cover withdrawals, whilst they're happy to continue taking deposits:</p>
<p>"Hi Stephen,</p>
<p>Yes we are experiencing delays again and we sorry that you are waiting for your withdraw.</p>
<p>From past experience, in the end, you did get your withdraws and some of them were paid in time without you need to consult with support.</p>
<p>So please rest assured that as you have received your withdraws in the past, it will happen again.</p>
<p>Kind Regards</p>
<p>Nathan, Casino Manager"</p>
<p>Please can someone help? I can only imagine how many other people are in a similar position to the one I find myself in, again.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
