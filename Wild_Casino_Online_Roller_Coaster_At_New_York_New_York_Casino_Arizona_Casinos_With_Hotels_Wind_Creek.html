<p>Altenar, a leading provider of sports betting software for licensed operators, has announced its intentions to expand its footprint in Malta. The supplier opened a new office with the aim of expanding its operational capacity and answering to the increasing demand for sports betting solutions.</p>
<p>Altenar Celebrates New Office</p>
<p>As shared by Altenar, the company opened a new office in Malta. The move aims to provide a new workplace for the company’s ever-growing team amid increasing demand for sportsbook products.</p>
<p>The new office, Altenar said, is located in Pendergardens Business Centre, St. Julians, Malta. It will accommodate many of the company’s new workers, including its numerous new hires working in the provider’s IT departments.</p>
<p>The sports betting solutions specialist celebrated the new office with a spectacular party for its workers, partners and clients. The event took place on November 11 and was visited by many of the company’s allies and friends. Local journalists were also present to report the celebrations.</p>
<p>The Office Will Bolster Altenar’s Business</p>
<p>The new office is expected to improve Altenar’s pipeline and help the award-winning supplier increase its productivity. Currently, the company has operations in Malta, Ontario, Romania, Italy and a number of other jurisdictions and is cementing its position as a go-to sportsbook software supplier.</p>
<p>Agnieszka Chowdhury, Altenar’s HR manager, spoke about the new office. He noted that it would more than double the company’s capacity. However, that is not all as the new office also has other facilities that would improve the quality of life for Altenar workers. This includes a variety of meeting rooms, break areas and communal spaces.</p>
<p>Chowdhury said that his company wants to provide its workers with a place they can work healthily. Altenar believes that good working conditions would improve its employees’ morale.</p>
<p>Creating an environment where employees can work, relax and collaborate will have a significant increase in employee morale and loyalty. This will definitely better address the needs of partners and will have a significant impact on a great and healthy company culture. Agnieszka Chowdhury, HR manager, Altenar</p>
<p>The new office comes in a year where Altenar managed to successfully grow its business, ink important deals and receive prestigious awards. The company participated in a variety of iGaming events and was named Sportsbook Supplier of the Year at the EGR Italy Awards and received many accolades at the SBCs, MiGEAs and Baltic and Scandinavian Betting Awards, SIGMA, SAGSE and the CEEGC Awards.</p>
<p>Altenar’s current position is favorable and its business is poised for further expansion. In other news, Altenar recently expanded its marketing team with Antonino Barra as head of sales.</p>
