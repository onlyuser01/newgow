<p>Taking the new position, Lisiecki will play an important role in the growth of IWG and spearhead its expansion across the globe</p>
<p>The leading supplier of eInstant games to lotteries across the globe, Instant Win Gaming (IWG), strengthened its team with a new promotion. The company confirmed Monday that its vice president, North America, Jason Lisiecki, was elevated to the newly created role of executive vice president, global.</p>
<p>In his new role with IWG, he will leverage his extensive experience and oversee the company’s expansion and growth. Lisiecki’s responsibilities will include overseeing North American-facing deals and other strategic processes related to product management and development.</p>
<p>Before joining IWG five years ago, he was a part of the Michigan Lottery for eight years. During that time, Lisiecki played a key role in the launch of the Lottery’s eInstant program.</p>
<p>Five years ago, Lisiecki first joined IWG and filled in the role of VP of North America. As the role suggests, he was in charge of the growth and expansion of the company in the strategic region. Under Lisiecki’s guidance, the company established collaborations and launched eInstant programs with the DC Lottery, Kentucky Lottery, Georgia Lottery, and Michigan Lottery. He also played an important role in launches with the British Columbia Lottery Corporation, Atlantic Lottery, Ontario Lottery and Gaming and other lottery authorities.</p>
<p>This summer, IWG announced the launch of its new eInstant progressive jackpot for lotteries in two states, Pennsylvania and Virginia. The leading provider of technology confirmed that its Mega Money Jackpots launched in the two states, delivering thrilling experiences for lottery customers.</p>
<p>Lisiecki Is Thrilled to Step into the New Role</p>
<p>Sharing his excitement, Lisiecki said that he remains focused on the growth of the eInstant category. “I’m thrilled to step into this new role at IWG and look forward to partnering with all our lottery customers to support their momentum and unlock further opportunities,” he said in conclusion.</p>
<p>“Of course, I continue to be incredibly bullish about the eInstant category and innovation in the iLottery sales channel.“ Jason Lisiecki, executive VP, global at IWG</p>
<p>Rhydian Fisher, IWG’s CEO, was similarly excited about the latest promotion. He said that he is delighted to see Lisiecki fill in the new role after the success he brought to the company so far.</p>
<p>Fisher acknowledged Lisiecki’s dedication and efforts that helped grow the eInstant category for the North American region. Finally, he predicted that the new executive VP, global will bring further success to IWG, allowing its innovative products to reach new partners across the globe.</p>
