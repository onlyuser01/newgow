    <h1>Double Down Casino Facebook Hard Rock Casino Biloxi Mississippi Mr Lucky Casino Comanche Red River H</h1>

<p>I bet on schellwetten when I won 1000 euros, I wanted to withdraw 900 of these. But when I try to take it out, the withdrawal function does not work and the gambling addiction in me immediately wants to lose everything. I believe that if the function had worked or if they had had any guidelines at all, I would have had my money, I have taken help for this. And that's what my support person says. My biggest problem is taking out the winnings, so I always have 2 tabs one for the game and one for withdrawals.</p>
<p>Have contacted them and they have only closed my account</p>
