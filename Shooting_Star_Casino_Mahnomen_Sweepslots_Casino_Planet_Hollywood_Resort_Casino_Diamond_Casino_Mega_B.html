    <h1>Shooting Star Casino Mahnomen Sweepslots Casino Planet Hollywood Resort Casino Diamond Casino Mega B</h1>

<p>PlayUZU, a B2C brand powered by SkillOnNet, has become the latest operator to launch in Buenos Aires City, one of the regulated iGaming markets in Argentina, allowing the company to deliver its strong online casino portfolio to players in the jurisdiction, Casino Guru News learned in an email press release.</p>
<p>The operator has been given the go-ahead by LOTBA, the city’s gambling authority, and to complete its launch, PlayUZU also had to team up with BuenosAiresSlots, a local company that is part of the licensing conditions that foreign operators face before rolling out.</p>
<p>PlayUZU focuses on providing players with a fair casino offering that will appeal to local audiences, and the entry into Buenos Aires will also serve as a prelude to further expansion across the country. Presently, the iGaming market in Argentina is split between 23 provincial jurisdictions, not all of which have given a greenlight to online gambling regulation.</p>
<p>So far only nine have. PlayUZU will benefit from the local presence of BuenosAiresSlots while the land-based operator will gain further traction with audiences through the online gaming product that the operator is bringing to bear. PlayUZU’s Helena Rico had this to add:</p>
<p>"This marks an important milestone for our company, and we are excited to expand our business into a new market."</p>
<p>BuenosAiresSlots is a trusted name in the market, Rico added, and said that it would help give PlayUZU the necessary foothold to further scale up its presence locally and beyond. BuenosAiresSlots’ Sergio Revilla was similarly optimistic about the partnership.</p>
<p>"We were cautious when it came to choosing an online partner, but we knew we had found the right one when we started looking at PlayUZU," Revilla added. He further hailed the fact that PlayUZU is a brand that is backed by SkillOnNet, a trusted global provider of software and solutions.</p>
<p>Revilla further hailed SkillOnNet and PlayUZU’s approach to localization and bringing products that are specifically tailored to meet the needs of local audiences in jurisdictions where the companies operate.</p>
<p>Apart from launching into new markets, SkillOnNet has been working to actively increase its content library variety. The company has particularly added games by established operators such as Apparat Gaming and BF Games in a bid to bring even more worthwhile opportunities to its player bases, no matter what casino brand they are playing at.</p>
