    <h1>Doubledown Casino Forum Hotels In Lake Charles With Casinos Buffalo Ny Casino Atlantis Hotel Casino</h1>

<p>Hi irishman87, I hope you are well and Happy New Year.</p>
<p>I just wanted to let you know that this is all in hand and our support staff have done everything that they could do to help you. The time of year hasn't helped us with the delay in finding your wire, but don't worry we're on it and will have it sorted for you as soon as we can.</p>
<p>A few things I need to reference for you though that have been mentioned above...</p>
<p>When you made your withdrawal request, you initiate this and provide the payment information, we've sent to this but since found that your account won't accept a wire payment.</p>
<p>Until we find the money we've sent, we won't be able to send another payment out. But, don't worry we're tracing this with the bank. Once it is returned we'll credit your player account and then you can request your withdrawal to an alternate payment method.</p>
<p>I also wanted to address the part about our CS team being rude. This does not sound like our team and I'd like to find out more information on this, who you spoke to and and when. All chats are recorded but it will help narrow down and see what was said and in what manner, sometimes chats can be misinterpreted.</p>
<p>Please be patient though, this is the first day back in the office for many, including the banks, so hopefully things will move a little quicker for you now.</p>
