    <h1>Best Online Casino Games Casino In Sacramento Ca River Rock Casino Richmond Bc Does Florida Have Cas</h1>

<p>Come on</p>
<p>It is easy to say that I violated the rule, from the moment my winnings were confiscated the Casino only copies and pastes the rule but at no time points out how and in which game I violated the rule.</p>
<p>From what I read in the rules, the bet cannot be above 30.00 except for buying respins, I looked in my game report and did not see a bet above 30.00.</p>
<p>I think the Casino should be clearer and have more respect for the players, the fact happened on 07/11 and until today they haven't informed me when I violated the rules.</p>
<p>What I'm asking for is an explanation, where did I violate the rules? which game? day? hour?</p>
<p>The rule was not clear as below when it mentions "NOT LIMITED TO RESPINS"</p>
<p>1f. The maximum bet with an active casino bonus is 30 BRL (5 EUR/5 USD/8 CAD/5 CHF/20 PLN/50 NOK/8 NZD/1,700 HUF/10 BGN/125 CZK/500 ARS/4,500 CLP/ 7,000 KRW/25 PEN/600 JPY/1,000 PKR/500 BDT/400 RUB/400 INR/40 CNY/25 MYR/160 UAH/180 THB/100 MXN/125,000 VND/80,000 IDR/17 GEL/45 HKD/40 HRK /2,500 KZT/100 MDL/300 MKD/85 MVR/300 PHP/25 RON/7.5 SGD/20,000 KHR/100 EGP), unless specifically stated for the bonus. When purchasing any game resources, including but not limited to respins (re-spins), these will be added to your stake amount. If the player exceeds the maximum bet when the bonus is active, 20bet reserves the right to cancel the bonus and the winnings associated with it. If your account currency is not specified - the maximum bet amount will be equivalent to 5 euros in your currency.</p>
<p>Another issue is that the Casino itself informs that first the player's money will be used and then the bonus, at the time of winnings the money was still real</p>
<p>1j. When using an activated bonus, the real money amount of the player's account is wagered first, and only then the bonus amount is wagered.</p>
<p>And another thing, you adjusted the value of 7800 and returned the 100.00 to the account, I went there to play, doubled the value and you took everything, that is, the casino violated its own rule in appropriating the player's money ....</p>
<p>You can't accuse and not show the evidence, so far the casino has only published the rules but has not demonstrated the violation.</p>
<p>Another thing, they appropriated my money, if I violated the rules and lost the bonus why didn't they return my money?</p>
<p>They took my invested money and bonuses.</p>
<p>20bet where did I violate the rules??</p>
<p>Be clearer, if you demonstrate where I violated we close the case and I retract here publicly.</p>
