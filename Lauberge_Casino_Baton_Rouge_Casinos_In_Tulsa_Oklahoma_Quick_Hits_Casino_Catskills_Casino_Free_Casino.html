<p>Solid Financials Open Up New Growth Avenues</p>

<p>SciPlay’s Q4 revenue reached $182 million, rising 18% compared to 2021. iGaming revenue also soared by 15% thanks to strong momentum in the US market. Light &amp; Wonder’s combined Q4 profits are $682 million, bringing end-of-the-year revenues to $2.51 billion. The impressive financial performance lays the groundwork for future expansion as the company wasted no time pursuing new business opportunities in 2023.</p>
<p>Streamlining Measures Played a Pivotal Role</p>
<p>The Light &amp; Wonder had good reason to describe 2022 as pivotal for the company. The last quarter concluded a period of dynamic restructuring as the gaming products giant reorganized its operations by selling off its lottery and sports betting businesses. Light &amp; Wonder president and CEO Matt Wilson proudly announced that the initiative was successful and would be instrumental for the company’s efforts going into 2023.</p>
<p>We delivered on an ambitious and transformative plan while driving operational success and double-digit growth in our business. Matt Wilson, Light &amp; Wonder president and CEO</p>
<p>In March, the company officially changed its name from Scientific Games to better reflect its services and place in the market. Shortly after, a successful refinancing plan reduced the global game giant’s debt by 50%, announcing a renewed focus on long-term investment opportunities. Company CFO Connie James noted that the strong balance sheet and clear roadmap significantly elevated Light &amp; Wonder’s value proposition.</p>
<p>We delivered quality earnings, setting the foundation for sustainable growth going forward as we continue to focus on delivering shareholder value. Connie James, Light &amp; Wonder CFO</p>
<p>Light &amp; Wonder has wasted no time in the first few months of the year and secured several high-profile strategic partnerships. The company’s pioneering Wonder 500 solution is already gaining popularity with operators, while a recent agreement with the Oregon Lottery may bear significant future dividends. Overall, the company enters 2023 leaner, more focused, and determined to maintain its leading market position.</p>
