<p>OddsJam has announced that it has completed the acquisition of OddsBoom, an odds comparison platform. As a result, the company continues to build its expansion and consolidates its status as a premium content and data provider for the regulated sports betting vertical.</p>
<p>OddsJam has Completed the Acquisition of OddsBoom</p>
<p>The acquisition comes with a quick executive reshufflement as OddsBoom’s founder and sports betting industry specialist, Mark Knight, is joining OddsJam as head of product. He will help the company work on original content inspired by data and different odds-comparison tools, the official press release confirmed.</p>
<p>This partnership was welcomed by OddsJam co-founder Alex Monahan who reiterated the company’s ambition to create one of the most powerful data-driven companies in the sports betting industry and assured that joining forces with OddsBoom is the right way to achieve that as the company pursues its strategic goals.</p>
<p>OddsBoom will now double down on its commitment to providing curated betting data and news content to sports bettors, whatever their background and interest in the segment. Monahan said:</p>
<p>Joining forces with Mark and the OddsBoom team will accelerate our mission to provide premium betting data and news to sports bettors of all types. OddsJam co-founder Alex Monahan</p>
<p>Knight was equally happy with the deal and argued that OddsBoom had an established track record in building products that are geared towards sports bettors in the newly-developed US sports betting market. He felt strongly about his own contributions to the company as his 20 years of experience in the sports industry made him a valuable asset to both OddsJam and OddsBoom.</p>
<p>Editorial Content, News and Educational Materials</p>
<p>His main responsibilities will now focus on content that he is well-versed to oversee. Knight will take charge of an editorial team of ten people and offer guidance, editorial supervision, and direction. The content will range from betting education and strategy to previews that are designed to drive engagement with players.</p>
<p>OddsJam has recently launched a dedicated mobile app that is available for free and helps consumers create personalized player prop searches and track any relevant statistics that may apply to this bet.</p>
