<p>The Price is Right review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>The Price Is Right is an enormously long-running US game show. Initially founded in 1956, and revamped in 1972, for almost seventy years people have been coming up on stage to guess the price of various items to win prizes and money.</p>
<p>Only coronavirus could put a stop to it, and even then only temporarily.</p>
<p>In its most famous incarnation Bob Barker hosted it, but if you can’t get on the TV to meet him, you can now give this slot machine a go instead. It’s not quite the same as playing the show, but you won’t have to know the price of an above ground swimming pool to get lucky in this version.</p>
<p>Win in The Price Is Right slot machine</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>Given the long running nature of the franchise, it is almost bizarre how poor the front end of this slot is. The symbols look cheaply photoshopped together, although the background goes some way to replicating the cheesy TV show set look.</p>
<p>The animations cover up the visuals well and feel much more in keeping with the show, while adding some additional flare that is only available to the format of something like a slot machine.</p>
<p>These animations are nicely timed and coordinated with a simple musical track and some excellent spin and win sounds.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Starting from a base game of a five reel slot with three rows and 25 win lines, IGT have also added a selection of features and bonuses that spice the gameplay up and make it more interesting than a first glance might suggest.</p>
<p>Pick a multiplier for your spin with the Punch A Bunch random feature</p>
<p>The Punch a Bunch feature can trigger before any winning base game spin. The player is allowed to choose up to four times from a set of hidden multipliers. Each time, the player may accept or reject the multipliers which are presented at random from a range running from x2 to x20.</p>
<p>The multiplier is then applied to the winnings on that spin.</p>
<p>For full details on the bonuses, see below.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Bonus symbol.</p>
<p>Three Bonus symbols anywhere on the reels will trigger the Big Wheel Bonus. The player spins the big wheel, which can result in winning a multiplier, a Plinko Bonus, or Cliff Hangers Bonus.</p>
<p>The multiplier is applied to the bet per spin and awarded to the player immediately.</p>
<p>If the Plinko Bonus is triggered, the player gets three chips to drop on the Plinko board (a pachinko style board with prize values at the bottom). Each chip has a randomised multiplier that is applied to the prize value it lands on. The player then receives the total of the prize values with the multipliers applied.</p>
<p>If the Cliff Hangers Bonus is triggered, the player is awarded free spins with an increasing multiplier.</p>
<p>One of the bonus feature - the Cliff Hanger free spins</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.25%, a little over our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.25 up to a maximum of $/£/€500.00 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is medium, which makes it a poor match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>High symbols paytable</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>With its weak visuals and interesting gameplay, The Price is Right is a game of many parts.</p>
<p>We like the varied bonuses, but dislike the volatility level. The RTP is pretty good, but not good enough to make up for the downsides.</p>
<p>Fans of the show might enjoy playing this slot, but we recommend something with a bit more variance.</p>
