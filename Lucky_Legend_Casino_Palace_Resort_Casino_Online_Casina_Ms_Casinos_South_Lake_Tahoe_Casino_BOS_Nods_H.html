<p>The announcement comes amid talks for an increase of the funding of the gambling regulator in the country to ensure proper supervision and licensing</p>
<p>Government officials in Sweden recently proposed an increase in the budget allocated for Spelinspektionen, the Swedish Gaming Authority. The proposal seeks to deliver funding of SEK2.4 million ($230,360), which is ultimately expected to help Spelinspektionen with strategic processes related to licensing as well as monitoring of the market. The latest proposal, announced last week, may be a part of a spring budget amendment in Sweden.</p>
<p>Spelinspektionen welcomed the proposal explaining that the extra funds can help with increased supervision of the gambling market in the country. According to the Authority’s director general, Camilla Rosenberg, the additional funding can help in the fight against match-fixing, money laundering, unlicensed gambling and other threats to the regulated market.</p>
<p>“We welcome these extra funds which enable further strengthened measures in the fight against unlicensed gambling, money laundering and match-fixing.“ Camilla Rosenberg, director general at Spelinspektionen</p>
<p>Besides the proposal for additional funding, BOS, the Swedish Trade Association for Online Gambling, showed approval for a separate initiative calling for an increase in the fees for applications and license permits. The Association wrote in a statement: “BOS agrees with the Gambling Authority’s reasoning that the fees charged should cover the authority’s costs for licensing and supervision.”</p>
<p>Swedish Gaming Authority Needs Sufficient Funding</p>
<p>The Swedish Trade Association for Online Gambling acknowledged that it is significantly important for the gambling regulator to be sufficiently funded. Additionally, the Association acknowledged that the option for Spelinspektionen to offer “one-stop shop” services for license holders who may have questions regarding their license, would also bring benefits.</p>
<p>“BOS would like to stress that we believe it is of great importance that the Gambling Authority is sufficiently funded to live up to its overall commitment,“ reads a statement released by the Swedish Trade Association</p>
<p>Gustaf Hoffstedt, BOS’ secretary general, explained: “We believe that the Gambling Authority is underfunded, at least in terms of maintaining an acceptable dialogue with the industry the authority is set to monitor.” He said that Spelinspektionen’s dialogue with BOS is good but added that there are concerns about whether the Authority has sufficient resources to maintain “a functioning dialogue” with license holders.</p>
<p>The dialogue on the topic continues and it comes after recently, Play’n GO renewed its gambling supplier license in Sweden. Late last month, the company announced it will continue to supply its services in the country by renewing its business-to-business license.</p>
