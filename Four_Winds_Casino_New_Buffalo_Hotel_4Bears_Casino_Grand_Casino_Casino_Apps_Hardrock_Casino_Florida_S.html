    <h1>Four Winds Casino New Buffalo Hotel 4Bears Casino Grand Casino Casino Apps Hardrock Casino Florida S</h1>

<p>Hello and thank you for you help . I first made the withdrawal and verification on May 20th I believe . Theyve asked me to send a picture of the card I deposited with , as I did, several times. Because my bank card does not have my name on it, the casino asked me to send bank statements , which I did. They told me it was sufficient , than came back and said it wasn't. So I showed them the exact transaction (deposit made to casino that I won with) with the confirmation numbers and I did. I've sent them every bit of proof . Now they are asking that my bank statement show my card number. I dont make the bank statements the bank does . And it doesn't have my card number but it clearly shows the deposit was made to the casino from this same account with the confirmation. Numbers and amounts . They are reaching for things that don't exist in order not to pay out the winnings, as I can see here this is a common problem with this casino . They have verified me through their hooyu verification. . I've sent all bank records . Drivers liscence and so much more but every other day they say they need something new. I was already told via live chat that everything was fine and I shoukd receive me withdrawl soon , and than they say I'm missing something again. I have sent over 50 documents and pictures</p>
