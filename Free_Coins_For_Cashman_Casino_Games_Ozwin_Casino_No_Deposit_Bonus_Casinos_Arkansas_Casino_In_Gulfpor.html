<p>EPIC Risk Management continues to be a driving force in ensuring that sports bodies and the gambling industry continue on a path that prioritizes athlete and consumer protection. The ongoing partnership with all three NCAAA divisions has seen the problem gambling specialist work on a program focused on improving student-athletes understanding of gambling, and the potential harms that can stem out of sports betting.</p>
<p>With sports betting now legalized in more than 30 states in the united States, EPIC Risk Management is spearheading another important initiative that is not least backed by Entain Foundation US which has contributed the funding. The program is focusing on 46 colleges across 22 states and has been able to reach 8,000 NCAA collegiate athletes and staff so far, the problem gambling specialist noted on its website.</p>
<p>NCAA EVP for Regulatory Affairs Stan Wilcox welcomed this opportunity and thanked all participants who have made this possible while also highlighting why the program was deployed in the first place:</p>
<p>"The risks associated with sports wagering are abundant, and the education provided by EPIC Risk Management is invaluable for student-athletes, coaches, administrators, and officials. We appreciate the teamwork to help protect the integrity of college sports and the well-being of everyone involved."</p>
<p>Entain SVP for American Regulatory Affairs and Responsible Gambling Martin Lycka was equally pleased that the Entain Foundation US has been able to support EPIC Risk Management in yet another ground-breaking initiative. Entain Foundation has not shied away from making its commitment to responsible gambling known.</p>
<p>The company has vowed to invest $132m in various responsible gambling initiatives over the next five years. As to EPIC Risk Management, Senior Director John Millington hailed the efforts put into communicating better education to student-athletes and who added that minimization of potential gambling harms requires a joint effort.</p>
<p>Numerous participants have stepped forward to hail the initiative as well, including Clemson University Athletics Department Director of Compliance Services Danielle Davison and Shannon Raymond, the Assistant Athletic Director for Compliance at Fordham University. Both were pleased to have EPIC Risk Management on campus during Problem Gambling Awareness Month.</p>
<p>EPIC Risk Management has been vocal supporter of responsible gambling initiatives. The companyâ€™s CEO and Founder Paul Buck is part of the Casino Guru Awards judges for "The Most Impactful Social Responsibility Initiative" category. EPIC Risk Management has also broached important topics such as whether loot boxes should be regulated under existing gambling laws or need a special mandate of their own.</p>
