<p>After two weeks, the Green Bay Packers return to Lambeau Field, the largest venue in the NFL. With more than 80,000 fans to cheer them on, the Packers look destined to extend their winning streak to six straight games.</p>
<p>What do the Washington Football Team (WFT) think about this? These guys will give their utmost to ruin Green Bay’s plans, even though such a scenario seems very unlikely.</p>
<p>The thing is that the WFT is without a single win in Wisconsin in the 21st Century. Still, stranger things have happened in the NFL. Let’s see if an upset is on the way!</p>

<p>Aaron Rodgers Owns the NFL</p>
<p>In the case of the Green Bay Packers, it seems that everything is about their quarterback. Aaron Rodgers is the man who can lead this team to glory, as he’s shown numerous times this season.</p>
<p>The 37-year-old has been in fantastic shape this season, with his Week 6 performance being his best in recent times.</p>
<p>On Sunday, the Packers beat their archnemesis, the Chicago Bears, 24-14 at Soldier Field, mostly thanks to Rodgers’ brilliant performance. The quarterback made two touchdown passes, as well as scored a rushing touchdown on his own.</p>
<p>The win over the Bears meant that the Packers’ record in the Rodgers era is 21-5 against the Chicago franchise. Speaking of Rodgers’ records, the guy is over .500 against most NFL teams.</p>
<p>Further, there are only four NFL teams against which Rodgers has a negative record in the regular season. One of those is Green Bay’s next opponent.</p>
<p>Can the WFT Grab the First Win in Green Bay in the 21st Century?</p>
<p>Green Bay’s starting cornerbacks Jaire Alexander and Kevin King are out, which is something the WFT could take advantage of. The two were out in the game against Chicago as well, but the Packers still managed to keep the opposition’s tally to only 14 points.</p>
<p>This time, however, the Packers are locking horns with a team that’s better than Chicago in the offense. Unfortunately for the WFT fans, this team hasn’t been playing great in the last couple of weeks.</p>
<p>The reason for this might be that their schedule has been really ugly. Last weekend, for instance, we saw them playing against the Kansas City Chiefs, a game they lost 31-13.</p>
<p>Another loss is probably on the way for Washington, but they probably aren’t going to get embarrassed in Wisconsin. They have enough offensive power to at least make the game interesting.</p>
<p>Pick: Green Bay Packers to win but not cover the spread; we should see the Over happening in this game.</p>
