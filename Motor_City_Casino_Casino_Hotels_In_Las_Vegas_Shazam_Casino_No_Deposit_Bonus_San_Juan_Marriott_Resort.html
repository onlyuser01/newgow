<p>Neither team can be too proud of their performances in the 2022-23 Premier League season. Manchester United started the campaign with two shocking defeats but then went on to win the next two games.</p>
<p>Leicester City, on the other hand, are still looking for their first win of the season – the Foxes have just one point after four rounds and are at the bottom of the EPL table.</p>

<p>Things Aren’t Looking Great for Leicester City</p>
<p>Leicester City vs Manchester United is the only Premier League game that’s played on the final day of the 2022 summer transfer window. Speaking of which, Leicester City is the only team in the Prem that hasn’t spent a cent on transfers this summer.</p>
<p>That wouldn’t be too bad if several important players haven’t left the club. The club legend, goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel left for Nice, Ademola Lookman’s loan spell ended, while Wesley Fofana should move to Chelsea this week.</p>
<p>In addition to losing several players from the last season, the Foxes have also been having problems with injuries. Full-backs Ryan Bertrand and Ricardo Pereira remain injured, while playmaker James Maddison is doubtful.</p>
<p>Manchester United Going for Third Straight Win</p>
<p>After a disastrous start of his Manchester United campaign, Erik ten Haag got his first Premier League win in Round 3, beating Liverpool 2-1. In Round 4, they won again. This time, the Red Devils weren’t as impressive as against Liverpool – they beat Southampton 1-0. But what’s important is that they got all three points.</p>
<p>The game with Southampton is important for another reason. It saw new Man United midfielder Casemiro make his debut. The former Real Madrid player spent only 16 minutes on the pitch, but this time, he’s expected to start the game, alongside Cristian Eriksen and Bruno Fernandes.</p>
<p>Leicester City vs Manchester United Prediction</p>
<p>The Red Devils look more than capable of winning this game, but it probably isn’t going to be a blowout win. It’s just that their new coach ten Haag will probably go with a conservative strategy in order to prevent a major upset from happening. That said, a 1-0 win for the visitors seems like the most likely result.</p>
<p>Picks: Manchester United to win; under 2.5 goals</p>
