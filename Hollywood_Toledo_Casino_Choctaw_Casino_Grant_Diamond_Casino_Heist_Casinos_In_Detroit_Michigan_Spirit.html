<p>RCR and BetMGM Hit Daytona in February</p>
<p>NASCAR competitive squad Richard Childress Racing (RCR) has entered a partnership with BetMGM, a growing sports betting and online gaming company in the United States. The racing outfit and the betting firm will work closely on numerous activations across social media and bolster each other’s marketing efforts.</p>
<p>BetMGM will act as primary sponsorship for pre-selected races part of the 2021 NASCAR Cup Series calendar and the firm is now recognized as RCR’s official sports betting operator. The move launches the first partnership between BetMGM and a NASCAR racing outfit. Previously, BetMGM signed an official partnership with the racing organization, becoming NASCAR’s authorized gaming partner in August 2020.</p>
<p>Commenting on this opportunity RCR CEO and chairman Richard Childress said that the partnership between the two companies was motivated by a “pioneering vision” they shared. As Childress puts it:</p>
<p>“This innovative relationship will provide opportunities to collaborate in new and groundbreaking ways.” -RCR CEO and chairman Richard Childress</p>
<p>The alliance will take shape on the raceway this month at Daytona International Speedway. The press release doesn’t specify whether the RCR’s No 3. Chevrolet raced by Austin Dillon will have any signage promoting the betting firm. RCR is also fielding the No. 8 Chevrolet by Tyler Reddick during Daytona 500 on February 14. The event will once be aired on Fox.</p>
<p>Operating in a Vibrant Market at Home and Worldwide</p>
<p>BetMGM CRO Matt Prevost expressed his admiration for RCR, arguing that the team is one of the most accomplished racing outfits in the organization. “Together we will develop compelling marketing opportunities and activations that introduce the BetMGM sports betting brand to NASCAR fans worldwide,” Prevost had to add.</p>
<p>BetMGM has been present in the U.S. sports betting and sports markets, signing a series of important partnerships. In January, the company teamed up with The Athletic to educate college students about the dangers of match-fixing and how to avoid becoming victims. The company also launched successfully in Virginia, becoming one of the first to do so and in time for the Super Bowl game on Sunday.</p>
