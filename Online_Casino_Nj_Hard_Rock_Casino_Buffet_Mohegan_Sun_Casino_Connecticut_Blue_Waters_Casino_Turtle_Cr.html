<p>Nevada Court Approves $800 Million Settlement for Victims of the Las Vegas Shooting</p>
<p>A settlement of $800 million was approved by a judge in Nevada for victims of the 2017 Las Vegas mass shooting. The settlement was signed off by Clark County District Court Judge Linda Bell on Wednesday, September 30. In the shooting, which CNN deemed as the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history, 58 people were killed and more than 850 were injured. The shooting occurred on October 1, 2017, at an open-air concert near the Mandalay Bay where more than 22,000 people attended. Around 10 pm on that night, a shooter started raining bullets into the crowd from his hotel room on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel.</p>
<p>After killing more than 50 and injuring more than 800 people, the shooter killed himself before the police stormed in. Although the gunman was identified as Stephen Paddock, the filings in court did not mention him by name. The investigation of the FBI and Las Vegas police found no clear motive for the attack of the 64-year-old, who was also a poker player. But law enforcement did uncover that the attack was planned and that Paddock acted alone.</p>
<p>Today marks the 3-year anniversary of the tragic event. Multiple locations across Las Vegas will host memorial ceremonies honoring the victims of the mass shooting. Today, at 10:05 P.M – the time when the shooting started, a reading of the names of the deceased will begin.</p>
<p>The Settlements Will Reach the Victims after 30 Days</p>
<p>MGM Resorts released a statement on the subject saying: “We are grateful that the decision brings families, victims and the community closer to closure.” The operator that owns Mandalay Bay and the concert ground deemed the shooting as “a time of great sadness and reflection.” Victims of the shooting have previously accused the operator of negligence and liability to the shooting. MGM Resorts, without acknowledging liability is going to pay $49 million in the settlement with the shooting victims. The remaining $751 million of the settlement are going to be paid by the MGM’s insurance companies.</p>
<p>In an interview for The Associated Press, the plaintiffs’ lawyer Robert Eglet said: “There’ve been no objections and we expect no appeals.” Egled added: “We’ll send out notices of the order. After 30 days the $800 million will be deposited.” Victims of the shooting came from all across the U.S. but also from the United Kingdom, Canada, Ireland, and Iran.</p>
<p>According to Eglet, people who have sustained severe or permanent injuries may likely receive millions of dollars in settlement. A key factor in the determination of the settlements is going to be the ability to work but also the type of injuries. People who were victims of the shooting and did not seek medical treatment but have filed a claim may also receive a minimum of $5,000 as a settlement.</p>
