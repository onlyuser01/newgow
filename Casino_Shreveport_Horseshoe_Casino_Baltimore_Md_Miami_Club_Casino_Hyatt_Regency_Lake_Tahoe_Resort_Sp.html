<p>France’s commitment to responsible gambling has been loud and clear with the country enacting a series of changes to the industry to make sure that consumers remain protected. From awareness campaigns to now an overhauled responsible gambling website. “Evalujeu” is the main online portal that French players can visit to inform themselves about gambling, the related harms that may result from participating in games of chance, and more.</p>
<p>ANJ Focuses on New Identity for Website</p>
<p>The new update focuses on accessibility in a bid to make it easier for French gamblers to understand their gambling habits. The website was first launched in 2015 and has been an important part of helping officials and the regulator, France’s National Gambling Authority, assess the levels of problem gambling and analyze how consumers interact with such tools in the first place.</p>
<p>The website also offers a questionnaire to help gamblers determine whether their own habits are exceeding what is considered normal gambling behavior. The questionnaire is based on the Canadian Problem Gambling Index or CPGI, which is a metric that is used to evaluate whether consumers are spending a normal amount on gambling.</p>
<p>Evalujeu is designed in such a way as to offer personal advice to players based on how they score on the CPGI. The regulator is confident that the overhaul of the website will contribute to helping players be more in control of their gambling habits and gambling spending, helping them, as it were “regain control.”</p>
<p>While the previous version of the website was fairly functional, the regulator felt the need to create a more accessible new version of the website. Accessibility should help the ANJ reach out to more consumers who may not be sure whether they want to take an evaluation in the first place. But better user experience remains at the core of what ANJ wants to achieve.</p>
<p>Evalujeu Now Features a Soccer-Related Questionnaire</p>
<p>The change in the visual identity of Evalujeu comes at an important time as well, as the world is preparing to meet the Football World Cup. To this end, the ANJ is also adding a questionnaire that has to specifically do with soccer. Meanwhile, the website will also feature responsible gambling content and tools in a more visible and accessible place of the website to ensure that consumers who come looking for help are able to discover it immediately.</p>
