<p>Clarion Events and the National Indian Gaming Association have teamed up with a well-developed strategy that will help both brands grow, support, and protect the tribal gaming market. With this long-term partnership, the annual Indian Gaming Tradeshow and Convention by NIGA will be able to grow as Clarion Events has massive expertise in this field.</p>
<p>NIGA’s General Reach Will Also Grow</p>
<p>Apart from supporting the Indian Gaming Tradeshow and Convention, Clarion Events will also help NIGA to expand its reach across all channels. The main aim of this partnership is to put more emphasis on tribal gaming’s key role in the wider ecosystem of the respective industry. As statistics show, this is the 11th largest US employer, and the whole sector is worth around $35 billion. Moreover, it generates ancillary revenue of $6.2 billion from retail, restaurants, hotels, and entertainment.</p>
<p>The chairman of NIGA, Ernie Stevens, Jr, stated that tribal gaming is a massive force in the industry. Right before the pandemic hit, its revenue was on a growing scale for the past ten years, representing the achievements and innovation of the Indian Country.</p>
<p>Stevens went on to say that the work that NIGA does is empowering tribal communities, and thanks to the revenue, there’s massive economic development. As NIGA is looking to establish “a new normal” and it is building back, it is delighted to partner with Clarion Events.</p>
<p>He concluded by saying that NIGA honors Clarions’ vision and mission, arguing that the association is an expert in producing large-scale conventions and tradeshows. Thanks to the partnership, the Indian Gaming Tradeshow &amp; Convention will grow.</p>
<p>NIGA and Clarion Have Been Cooperating for the Past Seven Years</p>
<p>The CEO of Clarion Events North America, Greg Topalian, said that Clarion and NIGA have a long-lasting relationship that has been amazing for the past seven years. Topalian added that the company respects what NIGA does for the tribal community and that Clarion is looking forward to expanding their relationship.</p>
<p>He concluded that the tie between NIGA and its ICE brand would allow the Indian Gaming Tradeshow &amp; Convention to reach new heights.</p>
<p>The ICE brand is part of Clarion Gaming, which provides industry-leading events and critical intelligence for businesses. It comprises digital content, live events, and the well-known brands iGB Affiliate and iGB, covering various events and content for gaming affiliate marketers.</p>
<p>The Indian Gaming Tradeshow &amp; Convention is an annual trade show and of massive importance to NIGA. The 2021 edition was the first large-scale in-person event since the pandemic took its full swing. It matched the same level of commercial gaming operators, visitor number, industry-leading suppliers, etc., as the events before the pandemic. The next show is scheduled to start on April 19 and will last until April 22, 2022, and will be held in Anaheim, California.</p>
