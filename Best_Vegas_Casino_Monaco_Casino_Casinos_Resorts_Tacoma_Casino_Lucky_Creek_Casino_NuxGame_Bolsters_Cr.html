    <h1>Best Vegas Casino Monaco Casino Casinos Resorts Tacoma Casino Lucky Creek Casino NuxGame Bolsters Cr</h1>

<p>The prominent provider of casino software and platforms has teamed up with the iGaming studio to increase the reach of content it offers to partners</p>
<p>As a result, Pascal Gaming will now help NuxGame gain access to a number of unique games, and specifically crash titles. NuxGame’s portfolio will benefit significantly from Pascal’s original and well-received content which features the aptly-named Crash, Big Hi-Lo, and Magic Dice.</p>
<p>NuxGame Expands Online Casino Vertical Again</p>
<p>These games are a step away from the traditional iGaming experience and they make sure that players who access and play them are enjoying excellent and highly-entertaining gaming options. The unique experience and gameplay are not all there is to Pascal Gaming’s titles.</p>
<p>These games are developed based on a principle known as “provable fairness” and they also come with an entertainment-first approach and vivid graphics. NuxGame is similarly happy to see these games added to its libraries as it would allow the company’s Online Casino product to considerably strengthen its proposition.</p>
<p>NuxGame is well-versed in many and various realms of the iGaming and gambling experience, and it also develops Website APIs, Agent System, Sportsbook, and more. This is the latest partnership that NuxGame has struck in the particular vertical, following similar content-boosting moves with Ainsworth Game Technology, Amigo Gaming, Turbo Games, and Elbet among others.</p>
<p>NuxGame VP of operations Denis Kosinsky said that he was thrilled to be working with Pascal Gaming, and added:</p>
<p>They have quickly gained traction in the industry for creating unique, engaging titles that we will now be able to provide our clients and that will aid in the acquisition and retention of players. NuxGame VP of operations Denis Kosinsky</p>
<p>Pascal Hails the Opportunity to Expand Reach in New Markets</p>
<p>Kosinsky similarly spoke of the focus that NuxGame has been putting on scaling in the casino vertical, arguing that it has been working with a number of prominent brands, but that Pascal Gaming is bringing a truly innovative type of content for NuxGame to share with partners.</p>
<p>Pascal Gaming head of marketing &amp; B2B Aram Khachatryan was pleased with the opportunity as well. He said that the studio was looking to enter new markets and come up with more market-specific games that create unique experiences for players of all backgrounds.</p>
<p>NuxGame has definitely been focused on innovation with the company recently introducing more solutions to facilitate crypto payments.</p>
