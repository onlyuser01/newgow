    <h1>Casinos Near Orlando Casinos Near Los Angeles Casino In Payson Best Online Casino Real Money Bellagi</h1>

<p>Hello dear guru team,</p>
<p>unfortunately I have to comment negatively on stake 7 now.</p>
<p>I deposited €40 and tried my luck at the slots.</p>
<p>I was able to achieve two big wins, around €1000 on Jammin Jar and €2500 on Razor Shark.</p>
<p>I then requested a payout of €500 and this was also carried out.</p>
<p>I continued to play with the rest and hoped for more wins.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, these did not materialize and I then applied for a payout of €800 again.</p>
<p>This payout was not carried out, instead I received an email that I had violated the terms and conditions and therefore my payout was canceled and my remaining balance was withheld. (bonus hunting?)</p>
<p>Although I can not understand this reason, since I made the profits without a bonus.</p>
<p>Despite repeated requests as to what exactly I should have done, I received no answer.</p>
<p>Only my original deposit of €40 was credited to my account.</p>
<p>I feel I've been treated unfairly here, I finally got lucky but then my winnings aren't paid out.</p>
<p>I also cannot understand the procedure of Stake 7. Why is my first payout going through and the second suddenly not?</p>
<p>Also, the fact that my emails are simply ignored doesn't make a good impression on me.</p>
<p>I would like to receive my remaining money.</p>
<p>Maybe I can get answers to my questions here.</p>
<p>VG Tobi</p>
