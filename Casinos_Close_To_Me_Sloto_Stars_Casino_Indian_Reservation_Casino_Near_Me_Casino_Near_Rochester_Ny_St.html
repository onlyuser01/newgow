<p>The company will redeploy many workers and offer support to the rest</p>
<p>Irish gambling company Paddy Power is set to close several shops in the country, local media outlets announced. According to the reports, the operator will be shutting down a total of 21 of its retail locations across Ireland.</p>
<p>The company plans to close the venues in question because of their failure to perform well enough. This move would leave the company with 230 shops in the country.</p>
<p>The reports say that Paddy Power would offer redeployment to many of the workers who will be affected by the closures. However, the company also confirmed that it will have to lay off some employees.</p>
<p>In a statement, Flutter Entertainment, Paddy Power’s ownership group, confirmed the move and said that it will try to redeploy as many of its employees as possible and offer them jobs in close proximity to their existing employment.</p>
<p>Despite that, the company is unlikely to be able to redeploy everyone and will instead offer support to employees it has to part ways with.</p>
<p>However, the closures will unfortunately lead to a small number of job losses. We are consulting closely with colleagues and providing support to those affected by these changes. Flutter statement</p>
<p>Paddy Power Promised to Support the Affected People</p>
<p>Paddy Power’s chief commercial officer, David Newton, also commented on the matter. He attributed the closures to a recent review of Paddy Power’s estate and the company’s desire to operate efficiently and meet the evolving needs of its customers.</p>
<p>The latest review pointed out some redundancies Paddy Power will now proceed to eliminate. According to Newton, the 21 shops the company is closing are underperforming and don’t benefit the company’s business.</p>
<p>Indeed, a well-invested retail estate remains a key component of our omnichannel strategy. Whilst the majority of our estate continues to perform well and is growing market share, we have decided to close a number of underperforming shops. David Newton, CCO, Paddy Power</p>
<p>Newton concluded that the decision to close these shops is in no way related to the work of Paddy Power’s employees there. He thanked his “hard-working shop colleagues” for their professionalism and promised that the company would provide the needed support to anyone who is affected by the changes.</p>
