<p>Northern Lights’ First Time Using Gigablox</p>
<p>Northern Lights was launched in 2017 and its main goal remains to create the best high-end video slots to hit the market. Over the years, the company has worked together with the best creators, designers, and game developers in the market and produced high-end video slots. Some of their most successful accomplishments are repeatedly played on both mobile and desktop systems in the UK and other parts of the world, and they are available with major operators.</p>
<p>The company’s chief executive officer Andrew Goodale commented on the new release, explaining the game is the pioneer game that Northern Lights has created using the Gigablox mechanic together with the YG Masters program. Goodale added the company was “extremely pleased with the finished product” as it is a game that will carry “exciting concepts” onto the market.</p>
<p>Yggdrasil’s head of product and programs Stuart McCarthy called Prized Pets Gigablox a new and exciting game created with the help of one of their most successful Game Engagement Mechanics. McCarthy added that Yggdrasil is eager to keep exploring fresh themes with their proven mechanic.</p>
<p>Enter the Joyful Peshop and Scoop up Wins</p>
<p>The design of the game introduces players to a cozy petshop with cute animals dogs, cats, rabbits, and chickens. The cheerful background music makes you think of a walk down Broadway boulevard. The background is dedicated to various pet shop items including food cans and chew toys. The right side of the screen encompasses the Pot Bonus prizes while the mid-section host the main grid. There, the friendly pets and the Gigablox will keep landing during the base game. The Gigablox reels guarantee that all symbols will constantly range in size starting at 2×2 to 6×6.</p>
<p>Once the pets start chomping the symbols, they turn them into wild symbols. The Chomp Chomp Wild Bonus is available for triggering after each new spin.</p>
<p>As nighttime approaches, the adventurous animals inside the petshop throw their own Free Spins party bringing players extra wins and wild symbol perks. The game also features the Pot Bonus that could trigger wins of up to 5000x the initial bet. To trigger the Free Spins round, players must land a minimum of five Scatters. If the Scatter lands as a Gigablox symbol, it consistently increases the odds of the bonus being launched.</p>
<p>At the beginning of August, Yggdrasil and ReelPlay partnered for the launch of Monsters VS Gigablox by Hot Rise Games. At the end of June, Yggdrasil and Jelly launched Buffalo Blox Gigablox.</p>
