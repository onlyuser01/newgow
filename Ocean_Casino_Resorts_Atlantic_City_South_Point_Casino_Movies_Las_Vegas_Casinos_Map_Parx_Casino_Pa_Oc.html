<p>Responsible gambling continues to be a priority for consumers and businesses in the gambling industry who want to ensure that their operations remain sustainable in the long term. To guarantee this outcome, many have committed significant resources to build better and more responsible gambling propositions.</p>
<p>More Responsible Gambling Urged by Tribal Operators</p>
<p>Now, the San Manuel Entertainment Authority, owned by the San Manuel Band of Mission Indians, announced a new collaboration with the Las Vegas International Gaming Institute, part of the University of Nevada, which will work on the creation of an advanced responsible gambling program.</p>
<p>The program will seek to bolster standards in the industry as of right now as well as seek to prepare gambling companies for any changes in regulation moving forward. According to Peter Arceo, a manager for the Yaamava Resort &amp; Casino, this new program will better reflect the tribes’ own commitment and values when it comes to responsible gambling.</p>
<p>The San Manuel Entertainment Authority has long been working to ensure that gamblers are treated in a way that guarantees their safety and that they are enabled to make responsible decisions, which benefits the community socially as well as economically. The authority has experience working out responsible gambling solutions for its Yaamava Resort &amp; Casino and has worked with the California Council on Problem Gambling.</p>
<p>The new initiative will allow the authority to considerably expand its expertise in the field as it would be able to work with the International Gaming Institute and make it possible for better responsible gambling policies to take place.</p>
<p>Stopping Problem Gambling Through Experienced-Driven Strategies</p>
<p>UNLV International Gaming Institute vice president of economic development and executive director Bo Bernhard also commented and said:</p>
<p>“Collectively, our IGI team has more than 100 years’ experience of working on cutting-edge, values-driven, and culturally resonant responsible gaming programming on all six continents.” UNLV International Gaming Institute VP Bo Bernhard</p>
<p>Bernhard is confident that the collaboration between the UNLV International Gaming Institute and the San Manuel Band of Mission Indians will yield strong results for responsible gambling in the region and the United States as a whole. Some 10 million Americans are estimated to suffer from gambling addiction. The rapid expansion of various gambling activities makes it more important to address this matter quickly and act to curb it.</p>
