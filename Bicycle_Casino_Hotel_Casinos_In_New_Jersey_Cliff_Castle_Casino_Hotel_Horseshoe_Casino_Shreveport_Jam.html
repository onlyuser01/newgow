    <h1>Bicycle Casino Hotel Casinos In New Jersey Cliff Castle Casino Hotel Horseshoe Casino Shreveport Jam</h1>

<p>Hello Andrea.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint and sharing your negative experience with the Loki Casino. We are sorry to inform you, but it is forbidden to create more than one account from the same household. We assume that you live with your husband in the same house and share same IP, address info, etc.</p>
<p>We have also found it in the casino T&amp;Cs, as shown below.</p>
<p>‘‘1.18 You have the right to use only one account. One account per a residence address, an IP address, a PC. If you register more than one gaming account, all your accounts can be suspended or deleted, and all bets can be void…’’</p>
<p>We are convinced this is the reason why you didn’t receive the bonus. But we also recommend you contact the casino and ask them about your future steps because if you or your husband have a real money win, you may experience withdrawal difficulties, too. Do you require any further assistance?</p>
