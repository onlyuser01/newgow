<p>The new opportunities should help the company’s B2B efforts, hopefully offsetting its disappointing Q1 results</p>
<p>Acquiring three new licenses to offer gaming software in Sweden marks a significant milestone for LeoVegas, providing a solid foundation for the company’s continued growth in the region. Receiving approval from the notoriously strict Swedish Gambling Authority reflects the company’s commitment to quality and player safety. LeoVegas’ focus on European expansion will be vital in regaining lost momentum.</p>
<p>Sweden Is a Strict and Challenging Jurisdiction</p>
<p>The new licenses granted to LeoVegas Group will bolster its Blue Guru Games studio and two PAM platforms. Each of the three B2B licenses will last five years, giving the company a significant edge in the highly competitive Swedish market. LeoVegas can now offer its comprehensive range of gaming software to licensed companies in the country, significantly expanding its local presence.</p>
<p>As a licensed B2B supplier, LeoVegas is subject to stringent Swedish regulations that safeguard players, ensure fair practices, and promote responsible gambling. Company CEO Gustaf Hagman stated that B2B licenses were vital in combating unlicensed operators and urged the country’s regulator to maintain its efforts to protect the public from unlawful businesses.</p>
<p>It is now critical that authorities focus on those suppliers deliberately undermining the Swedish licensing system by facilitating unlicensed gaming. Gustaf Hagman, LeoVegas Group CEO</p>
<p>Acquiring the approval of the Swedish Gambling Authority is a high mark for LeoVegas’ products. The Blue Guru Games studio will offer its growing range of gaming options to a new jurisdiction, testing its mettle against some of the industry’s top suppliers. LeoVegas will hopefully manage to cater to the preferences and interests of Swedish players, offering them exciting new experiences within a secure and regulated environment.</p>
<p>The Company Focuses on Continued Growth</p>
<p>LeoVegas’ B2B expansion into Sweden marks another step in the company’s recent focus on European growth. In May, the group relaunched its Expekt brand in Denmark, capitalizing on the growing popularity of sports betting in the country. March also marked a successful foray into Germany as LeoVegas gained regulatory approval to offer virtual slots through its LVSports Limited brand.</p>
<p>The group’s expansion-focused mindset seeks to bolster its global presence after disappointing Q1 results. With drops in several vital metrics and waning momentum, LeoVegas hopes its strategic investments will soon pay dividends. The company recently announced its planned acquisition of game developer Push Gaming, bolstering its content production capabilities.</p>
<p>With the successful expansion into the Swedish B2B market, LeoVegas hopes to diversify its assets and counteract the rising economic challenges. Appeasing the strict regulator in the country demonstrates the company’s commitment to responsible gaming and should spearhead further growth across all its regional brands. The licenses also mark a win for Swedish players who will soon enjoy new and exciting gaming experiences.</p>
