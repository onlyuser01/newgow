    <h1>Hard Rock Hotel Casino Punta Cana Photos Casino Careers Aqua Caliente Casino Palm Springs Las Vegas</h1>

<p>Livespins, a provider of innovative slot streaming experience and gameplay, has mostly been in the news recently because of the new studios joining the company in bringing next-generation entertainment to modern players.</p>
<p>And yet, Livespins has also been working to actively expand not just its supplier, but also its operator list. This is where the M88 brand, owned by Mansion Group, comes in, the companies shared in an email press release. Moving forward, M88 will have access to the Livespins Ambassador product, which will allow the operator to leverage its own network of popular personalities and help them further connect with gaming audiences.</p>
<p>Livespins allows M88 to onboard brand ambassadors and influencers and let them stream gaming content that is shared with audiences. M88’s representatives and ambassadors will be able to pick from a rich portfolio of games that they will be able to stream directly through the integrated Livespins product.</p>
<p>Furthermore, players will be able to participate in the gaming action as they watch streams in real time and place bets. Essentially, audiences can bet "behind the streamer," sharing in their victories and defeats, while they also get to adjust the bet size individually so that they are always going at a pace they feel comfortable with.</p>
<p>Livespins is integrated directly into the casino lobby, which makes it easy and accessible, but also ensures that the solution maintains rigorous responsible gambling standards and consumer protection measures.</p>
<p>Commenting on this new opportunity, Livespins CCO Michael Pedersen hailed the opportunity to see M88 become the company’s latest partner and introduce what is clearly an innovative product in the way players experience online casino gameplay.</p>
<p>"The demand for casino and slot streaming is big and will only get bigger, and by partnering with Livespins M88 can meet this demand and provide its players with a fun, social, and ultimately thrilling experience like no other," Pedersen said.</p>
<p>The news was similarly welcomed by M88 Operational Division Head Joy Lao who argued that Livespins would enable the brand to exceed player expectations by leveraging cutting-edge solutions. He described the product offered by Livespins as "like no other."</p>
<p>Livespins has been actively seeking to expand its reach. The company recently added products by Gamzix. Earlier still, Livespins also struck an important partnership with Yolo Group, bringing its unique product to the latter’s fleet of gaming brands, named Livecasino.io, Sportsbet.io, and Bitcasino.io.</p>
<p>"The Livespins experience really is like no other, and we can now offer our players slot and casino streaming within our casino lobby," Lao explained, saying that this added tremendous value to the product that M88 now has to offer its players while also ensuring that players remain protected.</p>
