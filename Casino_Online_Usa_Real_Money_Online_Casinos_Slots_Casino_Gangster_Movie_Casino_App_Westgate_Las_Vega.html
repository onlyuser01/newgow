<p>The man who came to the rescue of an Oklahoma Tribal police officer as he was being dragged through a casino parking lot was justified in killing the driver in November.</p>

<p>Osage County District Attorney Mike Fisher recently said Brandon Hines of Bartlesville, Okla. didn’t violate the law when he shot the suspect at Bartlesville’s Osage Hotel and Casino on November 21.</p>
<p>Right to Shoot</p>
<p>“We have never formally received an affidavit for anyone’s arrest. But after reviewing the reports, I made the decision that the shooting itself was justified, at least criminally,” Fisher told the Bartlesville Examiner-Enterprise news outlet. “I wouldn’t be able to prosecute that case.”</p>
<p>Fisher explained that under Oklahoma law, “You have a right and absolute right to come to the defense of another and to use deadly force if you believe deadly force is the only option available in trying to prevent somebody from potentially losing their life.”</p>
<p>The driver of the pickup truck that was dragging the officer was identified as Beau Caskey, 35. He attempted to speed away as the police officer held on to Caskey’s pickup truck.</p>
<p>Hines reportedly fired a single shot into Caskey’s neck to save the officer’s life. That took place as the officer was hanging on to an open door of the moving truck, according to the Examiner-Enterprise. Caskey later died from his wounds.</p>
<p>Hines then fell down and the truck came close to running him over, according to police. The officer was able to reach the truck’s brake pedal with his hands and brought the vehicle to a stop.</p>
<p>The officer had been attempting to remove Caskey from the pickup truck when Caskey put his foot on the gas pedal. The officer wasn’t seriously injured in the incident.</p>
<p>Truck Burglary</p>
<p>Caskey was suspected of burglarizing a vehicle at Hines’ residence, where various items, including a credit card, were stolen.</p>
<p>Hines and his son, Harold Hines, had been alerted that their credit card was being used to purchase gas at a station, and was later used at the casino.</p>
<p>When he saw the truck at the casino lot and a police officer nearby, Harold Hines approached the vehicle and told Caskey, “That’s my chainsaw in the back seat of your truck.”</p>
<p>The situation escalated from there.</p>
<p>The Osage Casino &amp; Hotel in Bartlesville is located near Highway 60. It’s one of seven properties owned and operated by the Osage Tribal Council. The casino opened in November, according to 500 Nations, a Tribal news site. The complex replaced a prior Osage gaming venue.</p>
