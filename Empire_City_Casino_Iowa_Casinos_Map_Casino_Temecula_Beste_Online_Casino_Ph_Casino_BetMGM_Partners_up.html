<p>BetMGM, a leading sports betting provider, and NYRA Bets, a leading horse racing content provider, have announced their official one-of-a-kind partnership.</p>
<p>BetMGM Partners up with NYRA Bets to Use Its App</p>
<p>On Friday, BetMGM, a leading sportsbook company, announced its partnership with NYRA Bets LLC, a leading horse racing content provider and the official online advanced deposit wagering platform of the New York Racing Association (NYRA).</p>
<p>It is the first horse racing partner for BetMGM, and under the deal, the sportsbook will utilize NYRA Bet’s wagering platform for its horse racing app, which will be available on iOS and Android mobile devices, and desktop. BetMGM customers will be able to watch and wager on thoroughbred, harness, and quarter horse races. They will have access to horse races on more than 200 tracks worldwide.</p>
<p>BetMGM’s head of public relations and communications, Elisa Richardson, said that the app would feature customer service and its custom deposit methods.</p>
<p>According to the president of NYRA Bets, Tony Allevato, this partnership will reflect on the importance of horse racing as it rapidly evolves on the sports wagering market.</p>
<p>Richardson also said that the company hopes to bring its offering to as many states as possible, and there will be more details when the app gets closer to launching.</p>
<p>NYRA Rapidly Expands Its Fan Base, Reaching New Markets</p>
<p>NYRA Bets launched as an online wagering platform in 2016 and has grown much since then, especially during the first stages of the pandemic last year. New customers started to gravitate towards wagering on horse races. It was one of the few sports to be operating during that time.</p>
<p>The platform has trustworthy top-notch wagering features, allowing customers to watch and wager from the convenience of their homes. It is available in 30 states and continues to expand, reaching new markets within the US.</p>
<p>In March, Fox Sports became NYRA’s official wagering partner, as the two parties extended their partnership to 2030.</p>
<p>BetMGM CEO Adam Greenblatt said that the company found a great partner in NYRA Bets. The company is looking forward to creating an immersive experience for BetMGM horse racing fans.</p>
<p>BetMGM’s Grows and Continues to Promote Responsible Gambling</p>
<p>This month, BetMGM became the Baltimore Ravens’ official partner, signing a multi-year partnership deal with the team. BetMGM’s app will feature all of the team’s special promotions and campaigns. Now fans will have access to co-branded promotions. BetMGM’s brand will be visible on all media content and channels and on M&amp;T Bank Stadium, where the company will have a private suite.</p>
<p>In March, BetMGM became the official gaming partner of The Detroit Tigers, signing a multi-year agreement. Under the deal, the company received branding at Commercial Park and Tigers’ social media channels, among other initiatives. The collaboration is also part of BetMGM expansion plans on the professional sports stage.</p>
<p>Along with its rapid growth in the industry, BetMGM continues its mission to promote responsible gambling. In April, the company partnered up with GameSense, a responsible gambling program delivered by the BCLC. Under the deal, BetMGM’s iGaming platform integrated GameSense and became the first company in the US to utilize the program.</p>
