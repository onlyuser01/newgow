<p>The Atlantic Lottery Corporation (ALC) inked a new content partnership with the leading lottery supplier Instant Win Gaming (IWG).</p>
<p>IWG to Offer eInstants for ALC under a New Deal</p>
<p>Announced on Monday, the new partnership will see IWG produce omnichannel games for ALC. The new collaboration is expected to bring omnichannel eInstants, innovative games that are developed in retail and digital versions. Under the terms of the new collaboration, ALC will print games that already match popular eInstants. Such content is expected to include Super Cash Buster, one of IWG’s eInstants that has been continuously gaining popularity in the last few years.</p>
<p>“Omnichannel eInstants, meaning digital games that are launched with retail companion tickets have become common with many lotteries. Often, an eInstant is developed that adopts the visual theme of a planned retail game,“ reads a statement released by IWG</p>
<p>ALC’s director of iGaming, Robert Lalonde, revealed that the company is excited to join forces with IWG which will bring omnichannel content. He pointed out that IWG doesn’t separate the iLottery products from the traditional lottery but sees the two as “different sales channels.” In conclusion, Lalonde said: “Thank you IWG for helping with our continued efforts to integrate our online and retail channels.”</p>
<p>“Atlantic Lottery is excited to develop new omnichannel games with IWG.“ Robert Lalonde, director of iGaming at ALC</p>
<p>The Company Continues to Expand Its Portfolio of Partners</p>
<p>Rhydian Fisher, IWG’s CEO, thanked the ALC for the new partnership. He explained that for the last two decades, IWG’s lottery partners have been interested in creating eInstants for already popular retail games. Last but not least, Fisher predicted that the new collaboration will bring thrilling content which will be well-received by ALC’s audience.</p>
<p>“Thank you ALC for this latest opportunity. Over the past 20 years, it has been common for our lottery partners to ask us to create eInstants that match already popular printed games.“ Rhydian Fisher, CEO at Instant Win Gaming</p>
<p>This summer, IWG announced other key partnerships. The company joined forces with the Pennsylvania Lottery which saw the launch of an eInstant game called Mine Blowing Jackpot. A similar deal was forged in July when IWG inked a collaboration with the Virginia Lottery. Under the deal, the company agreed to develop an eInstant themed after Street Fighter II.</p>
<p>As a leading supplier of iGaming content to the lottery industry, IWG operates all around the globe. The company currently offers its services to more than 22 national, as well as state lotteries. What’s more, IWG has decades of experience in developing and offering high-quality instant games.</p>
