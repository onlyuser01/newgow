<p>Leading sportsbook operator PointsBet was recently awarded the 2020 eGaming Review (EGR) North America Awards for top sports betting operator, most socially responsible operator, and US Rising star.</p>
<p>PointsBet Offers High Levels of Player Protection</p>
<p>Key criteria for the sports betting operator award include scale and positive influence on others in the industry over the past 12 months. EGR judges consider innovative companies which provide excellent player experience and have grown in the mobile and online sector.</p>
<p>PointsBet has proven to be a leader in customer and player protection, with many procedures designed to ensure responsible gaming. The sportsbook offers problem gambling support, age verification, and KYC procedures, as well as in-game cash-out.</p>
<p>Plans To Expand Across at Least 8 US States</p>
<p>EGR awarded PointsBet with the US Rising star award, which honors rapidly growing US companies of up to two years of existence. Commercial success, innovation levels, and the company’s ability to become a market leader were factored in the judges’ decision.</p>
<p>Founded in Australia, PointsBet launched in New Jersey in January 2019. As one of the fastest-growing sportsbooks in the US, the sports betting leader plans to further expand its footprint in the country. The company has businesses in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, and New Jersey, with launches planned in Colorado and Michigan. Market agreements in Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, New York, Ohio, and West Virginia await legislation and regulatory approvals.</p>
<p>PointsBetting Is a Unique Sports Betting Option</p>
<p>PointsBet says it has the “quickest and most user-friendly” mobile app and provides “the best” user experience and content on the market. The bookmaker is the only one offering PointsBetting in the US.</p>
<p>PointsBetting is a sports betting option that depends on the risk the player is willing to take. Unlike a point spread bet, the margin of victory will decide on the amount the player will win or lose. This can be very volatile, as the winnings depend on the final score of the game.</p>
<p>NBC Sports Partners PointsBet</p>
<p>PointsBet is the exclusive sports betting partner of NBC Sports and will promote the PointsBet brand through the media company’s television and digital channels. In return, NBC Sports provides the bookmaker with marketing and advertising opportunities.</p>
<p>PointsBet will reach Spanish-speaking fans via Telemundo Deportes and Telemundo broadcast stations.</p>
