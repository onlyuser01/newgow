    <h1>Bluewater Resort And Casino True Fortune Casino Login Captain Jack Casino 100 No Deposit Bonus Codes</h1>

<p>Meruelo Gaming has teamed up with the Arizona Coyotes, a National Hockey League (NHL) franchise, to introduce SaharaBets as Arizona’s latest sports betting operator. The company is affiliated with Sahara Las Vegas and Grand Sierra Resort in Reno, putting it in a strong position to pull its weight with local gamblers.</p>
<p>Starting on January 12, and just in time for a busy sports betting schedule ahead, the SaharaBets Arizona app will be available for download, and consumers will be able to register. The triangulation of these brands is most auspicious as Alex Meruelo owns both the Sahara Las Vegas and Grand Sierra Resorts, and he previously obtained a share in the Coyotes.</p>
<p>Commenting on these developments, SaharaBets president Andrew Patterson said that the digital platform would bring the “excitement and iconic reputation” of the land-based Sahara Las Vegas to sports bettors in Arizona.</p>
<p>“As the sports betting landscape continues to evolve in the Valley, SaharaBets looks forward to collaborating with the Coyotes organization to engage and interact with sports fans in a fun and unique way.” SaharaBets president Andrew Patterson</p>
<p>He was joined by Coyotes president and CEO Xavier A. Gutierrez, who said that the franchise was excited to be teaming up with SaharaBets and bring a spot-on betting experience to fans.</p>
<p>“The Coyotes are dedicated to providing innovative and entertaining experiences for our great fans. Our partnership with SaharaBets will offer next-level gaming experiences for fans who want to unleash their competitive spirit.” Coyotes president and CEO Xavier A. Gutierrez</p>
<p>Arizona, A Coveted Market for Sports Betting Operators</p>
<p>Local developments in the sports betting market in Arizona have been exciting over the past several months. The state legalized sports gambling in September 2021. In the lead-up to the official launch, various companies began their marketing charm offensive.</p>
<p>DraftKings teamed up with PGA Tour for a sportsbook at TPC Scottsdale, which hosts the Waste Management Phoenix Open, a leading golf event on the calendar. FanDuel pitched its tent at a year-round retail sportsbook at the Footprint Center, which rebranded from the Phoenix Suns Arena.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Arizona Diamondbacks teamed up with Caesars Entertainment to open a sportsbook at Chase field. Developments in Arizona have been quick as stakeholders showed keenness to secure a sizable chunk of the market even prior to the September launch.</p>
<p>The Arizona Cardinals teamed up with BetMGM last year, and they are developing a sportsbook at State Farm Stadium. The property should be ready for the 2020 NFL season. Meanwhile, Bally’s Corporation managed to secure a 15-year partnership with the Phoenix Mercury, a Women’s National Basketball Association team.</p>
