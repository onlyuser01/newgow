<p>The AASBS 2023 is due to take place on June 27-29, 2023, at Paradise Point Resort &amp; Spa, SanDiego, the United States. As there are now less than two weeks left until the event, the hosts have decided to remind anyone interested in sports betting in the USA about the opportunity to get down with some of the most prominent industry experts and find out more about the industry during the gathering.</p>
<p>AASBS gets underway on June 27, 2023, and it will offer many opportunities to get to know the local stakeholders, and potential new parties, and strike business relationships.</p>
<p>To this end, AASBS 2023 will kick off with the "Welcome to Paradise" networking reception that will get underway on the first day of the event and offer attendees the opportunity to cultivate relationships and partnerships that can have a strong impact on the regulated sports betting market in the United States.</p>
<p>The upcoming AASBS 2023 will feature more than 35 speakers, representing some of the biggest brands that have a stake or interest in the localized sports gambling market. Among the speakers are such experts as:</p>
<p>Jordan Hollander , Deputy Attorney General New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement</p>
<p>, Deputy Attorney General New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement Dr Laila Mintas , Co-Founder and CEO PlayEngine</p>

<p>The event already promises to reunite a number of prominent companies, including Caesars Entertainment, DraftKings, FanDuel, WagerWire, Bloomberg Intelligence and others. The hosts at Eventus International are excited about the opportunity to bring this event at a time when 33 American states have legalized their sports gambling frameworks.</p>
<p>Some of the most recent highlights included the acquisition of PointsBetâ€™s North American assets in a $150m deal. Meanwhile, the statistics for active participation in sports betting demonstrate that the interest in the segment is growing. According to Eventus International, 24m Americans will have placed a wager online by 2024.</p>
<p>An estimated $45bn is wagered in the regulated sports betting market in the country every year and DraftKings is still the go-to sportsbook for most people in the country.</p>
