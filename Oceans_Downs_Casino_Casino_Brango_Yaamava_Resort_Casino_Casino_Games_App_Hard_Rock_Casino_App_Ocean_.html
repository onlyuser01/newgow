    <h1>Oceans Downs Casino Casino Brango Yaamava Resort Casino Casino Games App Hard Rock Casino App Ocean</h1>

<p>Sports betting is big business everywhere, especially in New Jersey. Two big events coming up are always huge opportunities for sportsbooks, with the NFL Super Bowl and NCAA Men’s Basketball’s March Madness huge betting events. It may have missed the first one, but Atlantic City’s Ocean Casino hopes to make the most out of the second with the launch of a new sportsbook.</p>
<p>Ocean Casino to Get New Sportsbook</p>
<p>According to a press release, March will be the month when Ocean Casino launches construction of “a new venue that will blend an entertaining bar, lounge, and gaming experience with sports wagering.” The new venue, which was budgeted at $4 million, will open sometime in the summer.</p>
<p>While the new book won’t be completely ready, it will have one sport betting window and one kiosk open for guests to place legal sports bets for March Madness. Online betting is also available to everyone with a smartphone.</p>
<p>Ocean is optimistic that it will have received regulatory approval in time for USBookmaking and Hall of Fame bookmaker Vic Salerno to provide lines. This is a welcome development for high-stakes gamblers who were previously restricted by William Hill as their sportsbook partner.</p>
<p>Bill Callahan, Ocean’s interim CEO, said in a statement, “As Ocean continues to strengthen its position within Atlantic City, we are steadfastly dedicated to property growth and development.” Callahan took over recently for Terry Glebocki, who resigned last October.</p>
<p>Ocean Continues to Expand</p>
<p>Ocean, as part of a $15-million project, opened “The Cove high limit slot experience” and “The Loft” private luxury gaming room in 2021. It also introduced a new high-limit table game venue, an Asian-themed gaming area and guest lounges for Ocean Rewards cardholders. The pool and cabana areas were also expanded.</p>
<p>Other investments worth more than $75 million are still to be made in 2022, according to the company.</p>
<p>Last year, the Boardwalk property led the city’s casino industry by achieving a record average rate per occupied space of $246.82 and an occupancy rate of 89.3%. Ocean will be adding 360 guest rooms to the hotel’s 12th floor, and close to 100 suites.</p>
<p>The New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement released figures last week indicating that Ocean was third in 2021 for casino revenue. Its $306.8 million in revenue trailed industry leader Borgata, at $606 million, and newcomer Hard Rock at $431.1 million.</p>
