    <h1>La Area Casinos Ginger Casino Spokane Tribe Casino Accident Caesars Casino Danville Va Buffalo Casin</h1>

<p>I should say the dispute relates to a number of casinos operated by the Grace Media. I am owed a total of Â£656 including 57 Cheeky Riches, 22 Monster Casino, 44 Pots of Luck, 13 Plush casino, 88 Arctic Casino, 53 Chelsea Palace, 19 Play UK, 11 Clover and 93 sunset casino.</p>
<p>They had processed some previous withdrawals but froze all accounts pending source of wealth and ID checks. I sent them the following documents:</p>
<p>3 months bank statements showing my salary income. 3 months bank statements showing my deposits to their casinos. 2 work payslips showing my salary as also shown on my bank statements. Photo ID and copies of my bank card used to deposit. I had sent them an initial redacted version of my statements which shows my casino deposits as it included some private transactions I felt they didnt need to see. I then sent unredacted versions which they claim have been amended but have not explained how or why. All these statements show my deposits and withdrawals to their casinos. They are refusing to process my outstanding cash because of this. I have asked for my accounts to be closed which they now are. I have told them I am not providing any further documents and they are still saying they will not return my funds. I have asked them to provide legal guidance which allows them to do this but they have not. This has been going on for 3 or 4 months. I have had enough and consider I have provided them with more than enough private information for them to verify my source of wealth/identity and I am providing no more.</p>
