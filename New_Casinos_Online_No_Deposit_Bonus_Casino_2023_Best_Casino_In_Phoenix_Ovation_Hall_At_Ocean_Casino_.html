    <h1>New Casinos Online No Deposit Bonus Casino 2023 Best Casino In Phoenix Ovation Hall At Ocean Casino</h1>

<p>Private set please</p>
<p>From our side, we can't just send funds outside of our system, since transactions with money are registered and automatized on SoftSwiss side, this is why we added a total amount of 2 withdrawals to Youssef account and I notified Youssef about this via mail.</p>
<p>On July 7th Bitdice said the following:</p>
<p>Good evening Peter and Yousst</p>
<p>As Peter mentioned we agree with your arguments, and are willing to return your two withdrawals that had been lost.</p>
<p>I believe my colleague from finance have your ETH wallet requisites, but just in case, please forward it on mike@bitdice.me</p>
<p>This is to me a very clear message that Bitdice is going to pay me directly to my ETH wallet, and not my gambling account. It would make no sense to ask for the players ETH wallet and never had the intention on using it if I was supposed to make the withdrawal of the funds myself.</p>
<p>And if we look on the replies in this complaint I believe that Peter was in the same assumption too that I will get my withdrawals in my ETH wallet and not on my closed gambling account. He even mentions this in his message from yesterday that for crypto transfers this is taking too long on your side.</p>
<p>Peter said earlier on July 6th:</p>
<p>Dear Yousst and Mike,</p>
<p>Thank you for your replies. Let's sum up the whole issue here. Yousst had two pending withdrawals and on the 18th of June 19:31 CEST asked the support to block his account due to a gambling issue. The request was repeated again at 19:38 CEST. It seems that the requests were ignored. From that moment, the player shouldn't be allowed to make any more bets or deposits. However, this is not the case so he should be refunded all bets and deposits made after the self-exclusion request.</p>
<p>The whole issue in my complaint was that your casino Bitdice have no self exclusion tools, and when I asked Support for help as I clearly was unable to control my gameplay nobody was able to assist me or help me. According to Peter and Casino Guru the moment I informed the casino I should ve been unable to play anymore or deposit at Bitdice, well that did not happen but after I got the pending withdrawals back and was able to gamble them all afterwards the account somehow was almost immediately closed.</p>
<p>In his reply via mail, Youssef confirmed that funds had been credited to his account and asked us to add more, since the total amount was less than the original one.</p>
<p>So from our POV the whole situation looked like Youssef is ok with getting this amount by withdrawing money from his BitDice account.</p>
<p>Well I did not say anything about ok, all I said in the e-mail(which I can send to Peter if needed) was that I thanked you for your update and that I saw that the balance was not correct. At that point I was unaware that I was able to play. Otherwise I would ve said that and responded differently.</p>
<p>Regarding games, the support team notified Youssef before regarding this: we don't have an option to partially block a user from playing, without fully blocking his account, in the screenshot Youssef provided, he had these warnings in his dialogue with the support team.</p>
<p>We understand Youssef's issues with gambling, but from our side we did what we agreed on.</p>
<p>As I have mentioned earlier I informed the casino that I have an issue and need to get help from the casino to close my account. In the screenshots I presented earlier all what Support said is that they could not block the account while it has pending withdrawals.</p>
<p>And at this point I do not understand on what Bitdice agreed on actually as I explained earlier, you made it clear that I will get the withdrawals on my ETH wallet which Finance already had.</p>
<p>From this point onwards there are three options I think in this case.</p>
<h1>1 Bitdice could restore the funds again and this time have someone monitoring my account to block my account immediately if I try to play to protect the funds and ensuring me being able to withdraw the funds, or get this done with help from Casino Guru maybe?</h1>
<h1>2 Bitdice can check with SoftSwiss if they can arrange something to get me my refund on my BTC or ETH wallet. I am more than happy to send you the wallet details again.</h1>
<h1>3 Bitdice choose not to refund my money and stands on its decision, which make me feel very sorry if the casino would behave like that as it means that the casino did not resolve this matter and for Peter it means you could close the case as unresolved as the casino made the exact same mistake which made me complaint and in the earlier correspondance Mike did not mention anything about I have to be responsible for the payment from the account to my wallet as I would ve asked help in ensuring that. Instead I had to figure it out in a painful matter by losing it all.</h1>
<p>And all of the above is without the mention of the very very long waiting time to get the funds retrieved and not in my wallet as agreed on but on my gambling account.</p>
