    <h1>Casino Online Live Casinos Kansas City Mo Royal Caribbean Casino Rewards Casino Imdb Prairie S Edge</h1>

<p>Livespins, the company that super-charges the live casino &amp; slot experience and creates a brand new category of entertainment, has expanded its business proposition. Livespins has hailed the addition of Jelly, an up-and-coming iGaming studio that delivers innovative slot titles that bolster the enjoyment players get.</p>
<p>With notable picks such as CleoPatrick, Blackbeard’s Booty Megaways, The Great Eagle, and Midas Riches, among others, Jelly has carved a place in the iGaming industry for itself. Jelly is joining one of the most exciting verticals in the iGaming industry, with Livespins creating some of the most relevant slot experiences available anywhere.</p>
<p>Essentially, Livespins combines the fun and thrill of live games with the pace and festivity of slot gaming. The end result is an experience where players can watch popular streamers who are part of the Livespins family play many of their favorite slot games in real-time.</p>
<p>Players are further empowered to place their own bets side-by-side with the streamers they enjoy. Win or lose – everyone shares in the experience. Furthermore, the pace of play is controlled not by what the streamer wagers but by what each individual player chooses to bet on a single spin. There is no obligation to match the streamer bets, just the joy or admittedly – disappointment – of the outcome.</p>
<p>This "bet behind" concept is completely new to the iGaming landscape and it has already proven a significant success. Livespins is its own category in game lobbies at popular operators already, and it is likely to become even more popular over the coming years. Jelly CEO David Newstead has welcomed the opportunity to see his company featured as one of the available suppliers at Livespins as well.</p>
<p>"Partnering with Livespins gives us an opportunity to get our games in front of an entirely new audience. This is a relatively new channel for us, so I’m keen to see how it can up Jelly’s profile," Newstead remarked, confident in the long-term implications of this partnership. Livespins has pursued a number of similar partnerships and opportunities over the past several months.</p>
<p>The company notably teamed up with Relax Gaming, an author of acclaimed iGaming titles and a developer who has stated that it would pursue and explore further opportunities by producing the Best Game of the Year every year.</p>
<p>Livespins CCO Michael Pedersen welcomed the partnership on a similarly positive note, arguing that the partnership will definitely benefit both companies. Pedersen shared that Livespins’ community was constantly on the prowl to try new titles tried in real-time on screen by their favorite streamers.</p>
<p>Jelly, Pedersen continued, brings something completely unique to the table, helping the supplier’s products stand out and prove an appealing target for streamers and viewers alike.</p>
