    <h1>Free Casino Slots Online Top Rated Online Casinos Desert Diamond Casino Glendale Orion Star Casino C</h1>

<p>For over 4 years I think I played at Loki Casino and during all those years I lost over 100,000 euros and ruined my financial, psychological, family, friends, everything you can think of. I completely destroyed my life ending up in debt however the casino and the vips managers always encouraged my addiction with bonuses and more bonuses and if I ever won the payout was super fast and more bonuses were offered so I could play more and more and more. When I lost, bonuses and more bonuses and more bonuses, manipulated in such a way that I would always be addicted more and more.</p>
<p>However last month my account was suddenly canceled at this casino and after contacting Mark my casino manager was told that the casino had stopped accepting Portuguese players. I was never told such a thing and the account was canceled without notifying me. My account manager told me that there was another casino from the same group called Golden Star Casino and that if I wanted I could play there because my vip conditions would be the same, that is addiction and more addiction and more addiction.</p>
<p>Today, May 13th, I made my biggest mistake. I had 350 euros and I deposited that money in the casino and lost it. That was all my money I had for the month, for purchases and household expenses. I panicked because I had made the biggest mistake ever because of gambling addiction.</p>
<p>I automatically asked them to cancel my account as I had done it many times before but whenever I asked them to open the account again they opened it ðŸ™‚ But this time it was different, I took on the addiction, I got desperate and asked them to return my deposits today because I have a daughter to support and I needed it to feed her, always assuming that it was my mistake. more than 100,000 euros spent in an online casino, I asked for a single favor and the answer was NO!</p>
<p>With all this I just learned a lesson, a big lesson. However, I know that there is a law that requires repentance during the first 24 hours with regard to deposits on any online site even for sites that are outside the Portuguese jurisdiction and therefore this group that against the two casinos has to return the deposits in question to me.</p>
<p>Not to mention all the times I blocked the account and they reactivated my account again after I asked. There are situations here that show the abuse of a person with addiction to the game and so either they give me the money back from these last deposits today or I intend to take this to the end!</p>
