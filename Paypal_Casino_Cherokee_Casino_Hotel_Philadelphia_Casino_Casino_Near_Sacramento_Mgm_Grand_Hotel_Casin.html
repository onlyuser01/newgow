<p>Hard Rock Atlantic City is making good on its promise to revitalize the local region by encouraging former Trump Taj Mahal workers who were laid off by billionaire Carl Icahn’s closing of the Boardwalk casino resort in October of 2016 to apply for new employment.</p>

<p>Scheduled to open this summer as a reimagined rock ‘n’ roll-themed property, Hard Rock has posted an “invitation only” hiring event on its careers website that encourages former Taj Mahal workers to apply for one of the roughly 3,000 open positions.</p>
<p>“This job posting is for former team members at the Taj Mahal Hotel &amp; Casino who were employed at least 30 days before the property closed,” the posting reads. “We are always looking to bring a fresh approach to our service, attitude, and actions. We are seeking like-minded ‘Rock Stars’ who are interested in a career in the fast-paced gaming industry.”</p>
<p>Hard Rock says opportunities for former Taj employees include food and beverage, hotel operations, table dealers, slot and cage operations, marketing, entertainment, “and much more!”</p>
<p>The job posting tells interested candidates to keep an eye on the initiation-only webpage for future information.</p>
<p>New Atlantic City</p>
<p>2017 marked the second consecutive annual gaming revenue growth in Atlantic City after nine years of decline. The seven remaining casinos posted total gaming win (including internet operations) of $2.66 billion, a more than seven percent premium on 2016.</p>
<p>The next 12 months, however, will be critical in determining if the city’s stabilization warrants new investments and additional casino floors.</p>
<p>Hard Rock purchased the shuttered Taj Mahal from Icahn for just $50 million, but along with investors and New Jersey natives Jack Morris and Joe Jingoli, the company is spending upwards of $500 million to rid the resort of its $1.2 billion Indian-themed décor.</p>
<p>Hard Rock Atlantic City won’t be the only new casino to open in 2018. Just north along the Boardwalk, the closed Revel has a new owner after Glenn Straub, following months of speculation, finally sold the once $2.4 billion resort to Colorado-based developer Bruce Deifik for $200 million.</p>
<p>Defik’s firm, Integrated Properties, plans to reopen the property as the Ocean Resort Casino this summer. Defik says the firm will look to hire between 2,500 and 3,000 workers at the property.</p>
<p>Too Fast, Too Furious?</p>
<p>Fitch Ratings analyst Colin Mansfield believes two new casinos threatens gaming revenues at the current seven gaming floors.</p>
<p>“The market is in a good spot. The introduction of two new properties is not great for Atlantic City,” Mansfield said recently.</p>
<p>While returning thousands of jobs to Atlantic City is a welcomed development, especially considering the unemployment rate there remains almost seven percent, far higher than the national 3.9 percent average, a substantial amount of gaming and tourism growth is required to support the expanding market.</p>
