<p>At the beginning of the year, Gila River Resorts &amp; Casinos rebranded itself, then chose National Basketball Association’s Jae Crowder as its first-ever brand icon in April.

<p>The list includes table games supervisor, pit and shift manager jobs, as well as a casino manager position he successfully fulfilled for almost a decade. Before establishing his headquarters at Gila River, he also worked as table games supervisor and dealer for Soaring Eagle Casino for four years.</p>
<p>Sera Ribble Cocharo – Lucky 13 With Gila River</p>

<p>Ribble was also fine dining lead at The Lodge Casino for almost six years and Lead Server at Mountain High Casino. Sera will now be Santan Mountain Casino’s new director of food and beverage.</p>
<p>David Baughn, the New Director of Facilities</p>
<p>Boughn has been Gila River’s director of facilities and EVS for Gila River Gaming Enterprise between 2015 and 2019. After that, he spent 17 months as Choctaw Casinos &amp; Resorts’ facilities maintenance manager. In 2020, he came back to Gila River as director of facilities and EVS. In total, Bought has over 25 years of experience in the industry, 15 of which he spent in tribal facilities.</p>
