<p>Bet365 has outlined some of its future plans for the production of news content as part of a broader overhaul of its "Sports and Betting News" team. The company posted a LinkedIn post in which it explained that it will be focusing on the creation of an "ultra-modern" website that will seek to bring professional content from a variety of sports, including football, cricket, golf, tennis, American football, basketball, and all other professional fixtures available on the company’s dedicated betting platform.</p>
<p>Sports and Betting News Manager James Clark welcomed this opportunity and spoke about his own career journey which eventually led to his current position at bet365. Clark welcomed the opportunity to be working with bet365 and praised the company for its continued support of the news team within the firm. The latest upgrade will only reflect the deepening importance of media coverage.</p>
<p>This announcement follows news that Entain is seeking to operate as a media business in Australia. Clark appreciated the opportunity to be working as part of bet365’s Sports and Betting News team and teased some of the upcoming developments for the news portal.</p>
<p>He said that content will be available in a range of languages in the coming months and that the whole platform will be replaced with a new "super-smart" and user-friendly build. Consumers, sports fans, and readers will have no trouble navigating the overhauled website and catching themselves up on sports and betting news.</p>
<p>There will be tailored video content, exclusive interviews, and bespoke imagery, Clark confirmed, arguing that bet365 is looking to make a splash in the space and really up the quality of news reporting out there.</p>
<p>Many companies have followed a similar pathway. Action Network’s success, a Better Collective property that was bought for the eye-watering $240m, depended on strong media and news reporting in order to establish itself. Bet365 already has a good operational base and visibility is not an issue.</p>
<p>However, adding value to its coverage and elevating the media experience can certainly serve as a way forward for the operator. As to Clark, he’s an experienced industry veteran who spend years working in media and reporting. He will also be helping run the team which is set to get a few more additions over the coming months.</p>
<p>He spent a decade working for ITV News, so he has hands-on production experience of media content and has reported and presentedsports events for years. Clark’s experience will be one of bet365’s new website’s biggest assets as the operators set to change the way media reporting in the betting space is done.</p>
