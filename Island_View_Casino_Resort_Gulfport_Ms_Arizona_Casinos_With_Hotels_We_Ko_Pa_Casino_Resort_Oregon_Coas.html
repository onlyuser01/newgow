<p>Popular gaming entertainment supplier Play’n GO has released Leprechaun’s Vault, its fourth and freshest leprechaun-themed slot part of the popular series that features tiles as Leprechaun Goes to Egypt, Leprechaun Goes to Hell and Leprechaun Goes Wild. In the new game, Larkin the Lucky Leprechaun is ready to go on a series of fun adventures while bringing players a plethora of cool wins. Of course, Larkin is once in a pickle and he desperately needs a helping hand to retrieve the lost keys that open a mystical vault.</p>

<p>Good Deeds Don’t Go Unrewarded</p>
<p>The game has a captivating story, telling the tale of the mighty fairies who decided to break into short and sweet Larkin’s home and steal the keys that open his magic-filled vault. As expected, the leprechaun is ready to take on the challenge and retrieve his keys. Players are invited to help Larkin get even with the fairies, for a chance to visit the vault at the end of a rainbow of riches. How many riches? A grand total of x9,000 as a max win.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the game, players learn what their main objective is: get their hands on the Free Spins feature as fast as they can and help Larkin carry the magic rainbow down to his vault. The vault stores individual code numbers. Each of the numbers is added up to the total number of Free Spins a player receives. Next, players are carried into the vault where they see three middle reels coated in gold.</p>
<p>Once a Wild symbol land these golden reels, they turn into Sticky Wilds and are locked in place for the remainder of the Free Spins feature. Once a player manages to land the Wild Multipliers, the action on the reels becomes even wilder.</p>
<p>Irish Luck Theme</p>
<p>The green charmer and also the game’s main character Larkin has a heart of gold in spite of always finding himself into trouble. The game itself is packed with Luck of the Irish symbols and captivating green designs. The list includes Larkin’s leprechaun’s Derby hat, his lucky Shamrock, and plenty of Celtic-themed swirls of gold that are found on the vault’s walls. Speaking of the vault, it is loaded with Larkin’s pots of gold.</p>
<p>Play’n GO head of games Charlotte Miliziano called the leprechaun theme a “popular one in the industry”, adding Larkin’s “cheeky personality” perfectly matches the provider’s outlook. Miliziano also hinted Play’n GO may launch the fifth game in the series in the near future. At the end of July, Play’n GO entered the US gaming market with a fresh business-to-business license in Michigan. At the beginning of the same month, the provider teamed up with IGG to launch Exclusive Mega Don.</p>
