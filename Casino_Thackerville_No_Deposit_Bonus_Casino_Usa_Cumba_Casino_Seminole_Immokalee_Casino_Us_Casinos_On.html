<p>Pennsylvania has become the second state to host live dealer casino games. Evolution launched its games on Wednesday, October 21 with its studio in Philadelphia and in collaboration with DraftKings and RSI.</p>
<p>Evolution Soft-Launches Live Studio in Pennsylvania</p>
<p>Pennsylvania has become the latest state in the US to welcome an Evolution live dealer casino studio, a press release has stated. The offer soft-launched on Wednesday in Philadelphia and it is undergoing a pilot test on Thursday and Friday, October 22- 23.</p>
<p>Live games will be available at limited capacity and hours during the pilot test and scale up to 24/7 availability once the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board (PGCB), the state’s gaming regulator, clears the solutions as compliant and safe.</p>
<p>The first brands to welcome games by Evolution are Rush Street Interactive’s (RSI) BetRivers and PlaySugarHouse online casinos, and DraftKings.</p>
<p>RSI president Richard Schwartz commented on the deal saying that his company’s brands were happy to be among the first to welcome live dealer products in the Keystone State. He added that a live dealer game is the best way to experience a land-based casino without actually going there in person.</p>
<p>Moving forward, Pennsylvanian players will have the opportunity to virtually sit at Evolution’s renowned tables, he said. Schwartz also noted the existing tie-up between PlaySugarHouse and Evolution in New Jersey.</p>
<p>The partnership comes amid an ‘exceptionally high’ activity in the third quarter for the company. Evolution continues to focus on the North American market, with operations in New Jersey and Pennsylvania already up and running and a dedicated live studio in each.</p>
<p>The company is localizing its efforts in key markets in the US to avoid a possible but unlikely interpretation of the Wire Act of 1991, prohibiting the cross-border transfer of information.</p>
<p>Commenting on the partnership, Evolution CEO Johan Nordstrom argued that Rush Street Interactive was a leading gaming entity and expressed confidence that this partnership would allow Evolution to cement its position in the market.</p>
<p>Evolution is behind a number of games that have received multiple awards from industry bodies. The portfolio includes Lightning Roulette and Immersive Roulette, Dream Catcher, Monopoly Live, and others.</p>
<p>Nordstrom reminded players that they will have access to the quickest Live Blackjack product guaranteed by the state-of-the-art technology used in powering up the Evolution studios not only in the United States, but well across the world.</p>
<p>He felt even more confident, citing the company’s success in the Garden State, adding: “The Evolution-hosted Live Dealer Casino has proven very popular with players at PlaySugarHouse.com in New Jersey.”</p>
<p>“We continue to stay focused on further strengthening our North American footprint and it makes me proud to say that we now are live in Pennsylvania,” Nordstrom concluded.</p>
<p>Evolution has so far secured two other landmark deals in October. One was signed with William Hill and again targeted the US market. The other was negotiated with Wynn Sports Interactive (WSI), making its live games available to Wynn consumers in New Jersey.</p>
