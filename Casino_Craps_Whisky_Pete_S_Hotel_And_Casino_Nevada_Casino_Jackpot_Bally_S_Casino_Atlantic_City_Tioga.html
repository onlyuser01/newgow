<p>Rush Street Interactive is not pumping the breaks on its expansion in the sports betting vertical any time soon. This is possible through RushBet, the company’s dedicated sports betting arm, which is focusing on South and North America and is determined to continue growing in each region.</p>
<p>RushBet Seeking to Scale LatAm Presence with LaLiga</p>
<p>Better yet, RushBet already enjoyed success in Latin America through a partnership it struck in Colombia to become the Spanish LaLiga’s soccer competition official wagering partner for the country, but that clearly hasn’t been enough. RushBet now will seek to take this partnership across the entire continent and strike home with more fans and partners.</p>
<p>It’s all good news as LaLiga is scheduled to start this weekend and this means that RushBet will be in a particularly good position to gain momentum as information about soccer matches and events seize the continent with feverish zeal. RushBet has been confirmed as LaLiga’s partner for the next three seasons giving the operator significant clout and branding ability.</p>
<p>RushBet naturally has access to important assets from LaLiga which will allow it to position itself and promote games from both the topflight divisions named LaLiga Santander and LaLiga Smartbank.</p>
<p>This intellectual property includes the image and likeness of individual players, entire teams, and the organization’s own logos and recognizable digital assets. RushBet will use all of these to build a recognizable name for itself while introducing fans to more opportunities in the region to bet on their favorite teams, players, and games.</p>
<p>RushBet will also work closely with LaLiga ambassadors, usually retired players themselves, who command the respect and love of the broader sports audiences in Latin America. RushBet will enter into various partnerships with these ambassadors as well and host meet-and-greet experiences along with other exclusive opportunities for fans and players to meet.</p>
<p>All Sorts of Cool VIP Experiences for Fans to Enjoy</p>
<p>RushBet and LaLiga have also agreed to work on various hospitality experiences, such as “Money Can’t Buy Experiences” which will secure all-expenses-paid trips and VIP-style treatment to players who can attend some of the most captivating games in LaLiga, such as those played between Barcelona and Real Madrid, for example.</p>
<p>RushBet remains committed to its long-term prospects for the region and has a clear focus on the Latin American market as one of its top priorities. RSI general manager for Colombia Valentin Birnstein welcome the opportunity and said that the company was committed to providing players and sports fans with the best possible experience.</p>
<p>LaLiga executive director Oscar Mayo was equally pleased and said that the partnership with RushBet is an important opportunity to step up the fan experiences in Colombia and beyond. RushBet recently signed a similar partnership in Mexico.</p>
