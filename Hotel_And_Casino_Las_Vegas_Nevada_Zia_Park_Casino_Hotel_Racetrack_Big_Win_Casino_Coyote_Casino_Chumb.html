    <h1>Hotel And Casino Las Vegas Nevada Zia Park Casino Hotel Racetrack Big Win Casino Coyote Casino Chumb</h1>

<p>Dear Stefan,</p>
<p>This player registered with us on 2021-09-11.</p>
<p>They were able to register because they were not previously registered with us and was not excluded for any reason from our brand or partner sites.</p>
<p>On 2021-09-11, we received an email from the player that we have to return him all their deposits because they had a gaming addiction, which had not previously been mentioned anywhere on our website or in chat with technical support.</p>
<p>We take gambling addictions seriously, for which is the reason why we have a process in place. This means that we close a player’s account with immediate effect after they request it via e-mail.</p>
<p>In their email to us, the player did not request or even indicate that they wanted to close their account and a check of their account by our Fraud and Risk Department began.</p>
<p>On 2021-09-19 the player sent a new email, following our process, requesting to close their account.</p>
<p>According to the Terms and Conditions of the brand:</p>
<p>7.4.You can delete your account only if you do not have funds in the balance and/or there aren't any withdrawal requests in the course of processing.</p>
<p>The player had an active withdrawal request which made the immediate closure of their account impossible at that moment. The player was notified by email about this action. Their request would be fulfilled after the withdrawal would have been settled.</p>
<p>As soon as the player canceled the withdrawal request, they used the funds and there was no balance left in their account, it was immediately blocked and the player was notified of the account closure.</p>
<p>From our side, everything was done by regulations and T&amp;Cs of the brand.</p>
<p>After an analysis of the player's playing behaviour, it is obvious they are trying to refund their deposits after losing and referring to gaming addiction as a way out of it.</p>
<p>Also, when registering, the player agrees to the rules of the website, which clearly states:</p>
<p>2.6. By creating your account, you guarantee the following:</p>
<p>● You understand and accept the existing risks of losing your money by using the services of the Website;</p>
<p>● You are at least 18 years old. If you are under 18, please close our Website;</p>
<p>● You are not banned from gambling;</p>
<p>In this case, the player is trying to justify their actions by referring to gambling addiction while making deposits, playing with their balance and then trying every possible way to get refunded for their loss. Although we take gambling addiction very seriously and do our very best to protect players, we consider this case as a sign of fraud. According to the T&amp;Cs of the brand, the player's account is closed and they are no longer allowed to play.</p>
