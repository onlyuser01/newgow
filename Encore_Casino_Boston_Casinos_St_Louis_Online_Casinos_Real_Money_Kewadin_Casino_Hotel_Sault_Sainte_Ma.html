<p>ESIC and GG.Bet have entered a new three-year agreement geared towards the elimination of corruption from esports, the companies revealed during the ESIC’s Global Esports Summit last week. The Esports Integrity Commission has welcomed the arrival of GG.Bet, a prominent esports betting brand, as its latest Anti-Corruption Education Partner, which will help the commission bolster its global effort in eliminating fraud in competitive video gaming.</p>
<p>GG.Bet will play an important part in helping educate players and stakeholders about ethical behavior in the industry and how to detect and report corruption. ESIC and GG.Bet are committed to promoting a culture of transparency and integrity over the next three years of their mutual work. As part of the agreement, GG.Bet and ESIC have also expanded their Anti-Corruption Supporter agreement, with GG.Bet now stepping in as a Tier 1 entity under the program.</p>
<p>The news was well met by GG.Bet CEO Dmytro Voshkarin who said that GG.Bet has been actively seeking to help esports develop and thrive as an industry. Voshkarin added that his company has long realized the value of ensuring that the industry is safe and free of manipulation, guaranteeing healthy competition that benefits everyone.</p>
<p>He further added that he saw ESIC as a partner with whom GG.Bet shares the same core values. The partnership was equally well-met by ESIC Director of Global Strategy and Partnerships Stephen Hanna who insisted that by teaming up with companies such as GG.Bet, ESIC continued to promote integrity and help prevent corruption in competitive video gaming.</p>
<p>"We’re grateful for their support and look forward to working together over the next three years to create a stronger, safer esports industry for all," Hanna explained. ESIC has been one of the most prominent entities in maintaining the integrity of esports.</p>
<p>The Commission has also taken issue with publishers and developers, such as Valve, which it deemed had issued disproportionate punishments against some Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) players who had been caught cheating. Professional CS:GO has been rocked by frequent scandals. A few years ago, the Australian police took action against match-fixers who were manipulating CS:GO games for profit, which led to their arrest and sentencing.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, ESIC also signed Denuvo by Irdeto as the Commission’s first Anti-Cheat Partner, aimed at tackling corruption, match-fixing, and manipulation in the esports ecosystem.</p>
