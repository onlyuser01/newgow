<p>HI Casino Guru.</p>
<p>I have a problem getting in touch with Casitsu casino.</p>
<p>I mangaged to join and play on Casitsu, and Rocketplay under the DAMA N.V brand, despite having a gaming addiction and blocked from Dama NV since january 2021 (see below). If needed you can contact Yoju casino for confirmation on the emails I sent in January.</p>
<p>RocketPlay are handling this great, and currently willing to return the deposits, although it has not been done yet. I am hoping for some help with Casistu as it's complete silence from there.</p>
<p>It's a sensitive and difficult issue , and I am fighting each day with the addiction. And I really need to have the blocks in place, otherwise it's too easy to fall back in.</p>
<p>I set the disputed amount to 600, although I am not exactly sure how much it was, it could probably have been more.</p>
<p>Many thanks</p>

<p>Original email</p>
<p>Hi Casitsu,</p>
<p>I have a severe gambling problem, and have been able to deposit and play at your casino. This despite I am blocked from all gaming in Denmark,</p>
<p>and specifically blocked on Dama NV casinos with my emailaddress and info (see mail below from January).</p>
<p>I need you to close the casitsu account, and request a lawful return of the deposits as I was blocked from Dama NV casinos.</p>
<p>Thanks for your cooperation, and I am so sorry and distraught. I am getting more help now, but it's not easy.</p>
<p>Best regards</p>
<p>S C ****</p>

<p>Emne: Gambling Problem Help</p>
<p>Dear Yoju Casino, Dama N.V</p>
<p>I am excluded from all gaming within Denmark (attached screenshot) since August and under treatment for gambling addiction.</p>
<p>During New Years I am sad to share that I fell back into gambling and was able to deposit on your site during 3rd of January 2021.</p>
<p>This although I am self-excluded due to gambling problems on the other of your casinos within Dama N.V. (with my email ****)</p>
<p>I hope you can close my account(s) for good within Dama N.V group , and also kindly ask you to refund the transactions to the card.</p>
<p>I am sorry for the trouble and hope that you understand.</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>
<p>S C ****</p>
