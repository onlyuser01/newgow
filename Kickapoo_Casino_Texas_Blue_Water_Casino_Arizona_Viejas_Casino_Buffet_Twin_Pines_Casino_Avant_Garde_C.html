<p>The partnership expands Reevo's footprint while boosting giG's attractiveness for its current and future partners</p>
<p>Gaming content aggregation platform operator Reevo announced today it has entered into a partnership deal with Gaming Innovation Group (GiG) to deliver its comprehensive suite of slot and table games.</p>
<p>Enhancing Partner’s iGaming Offering</p>
<p>Under the new deal, the extensive network of online casino operator partners of GiG will gain access to Reevo’s portfolio of in-house developed and third-party studio game content, including top-performing titles such as Crazy Crocs, Wolf Wild and HellO’Win.</p>
<p>We’re constantly evaluating our iGaming solutions at GiG to ensure we’re positioned to deliver quality for our partners and their customers. Marcel Elfersy, Chief Commercial Officer at GiG</p>
<p>Elfersy is convinced that “the addition of REEVO to that marketplace is a welcome one,” and strengthens the company’s offering.</p>
<p>An option for Reevo games customization is also included in the agreement, allowing GiG to help its partners drive growth through differentiation of their product offering and further boosting GiG’s offering as a B2B iGaming platform.</p>
<p>Continuously striving to improve its product offering, Reevo’s platform offers its B2B customers a selection of the industry’s best third-party games, with seamless integration, while the aggregator is seeking to introduce to its growing portfolio of games two new in-house developed titles per month in 2023, as part of its roadmap to accelerate games production.</p>
<p>‘Win-Win for Both Parties’</p>
<p>Yaniv Tal, chief executive officer of Reevo, commented on the partnership, “delighted to join forces with GiG” and see it “propel Reevo to compete among top-tier providers.”</p>
<p>“What makes this partnership a match made in iGaming heaven is that our values are very much aligned,” Tal continued, looking forward “to collaborating with a provider of this magnitude” and convinced that the collaboration “will be a win-win for both parties.”</p>
<p>Seeking to drive sustainable growth and profitability for its B2B partners, GiG is offering a full suite of proprietary iGaming and sportsbook solutions, leveraging its vast gaming industry knowledge, product innovation, scalability and quality of service capabilities, helping them to deliver a personalized and localized experience for their players globally.</p>
<p>GiG’s solutions are extremely popular in Ontario where the gaming tech supplier already partnered with five iGaming operators, the latest being Casino Time, following an agreement to provide the operator with its platform, sportsbook and omnichannel solutions last month.</p>
<p>Also in February, GiG expanded its existing UK collaboration with News Corp to include Ireland, opening the door for its casino and sports betting content and exclusive offers to enter the country and announced plans for the partnership to target entry into the US.</p>
