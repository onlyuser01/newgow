<p>FunFair Games has introduced its new branding and logo as a means of promoting its ambitious growth plans for 2023</p>
<p>The innovative online gaming studio with a vision to shake up the traditional iGaming industry has presented its fresh rebranding ideas as a means of upgrading its brand identity, personality, and vision. At the same time, with the help of its new logo and branding elements, FunFair Games hopes to get closer to its declared goal of becoming a leading premium provider of next-gen iGaming content.</p>
<p>The Rebranding, Just in Time for the Launch of New Games</p>
<p>The freshly designed brand elements have been introduced to the public just in time for the upcoming new game releases that the studio has in store for the current year. The London-based studio targets Millennial and Gen Z players and creates pioneering content meant to offer them the opportunity to share more engaging multiplayer gaming experiences based on enhanced socializing.</p>
<p>In the upcoming months, FunFair Games plans to provide an even more versatile plethora of such games, encompassing a larger number of eye-catching game features and unique mechanics. At the moment, the studio’s multiplayer-style games are already enjoying seamless distribution via many channels.</p>
<p>The new releases are expected to attract even more players and iGaming operators searching for innovative options outside the box. The rebranding was preceded by a series of important senior appointments recently made by FunFair Games meant to help the company strengthen its professional lineup and bolster its operations in important sectors.</p>
<p>Fresh Look for Announced Tactical Expansion</p>
<p>As the studio is getting ready to enter a new stage of its announced tactical development, the fresh look is expected to help it establish its new identity in the non-traditional iGaming market.</p>
<p>By also appointing Dan Nyman as the new head of game design and mathematics, Kai Ngai as the fresh project delivery manager, and Martti Poom as the studio’s new art director, FunFair Games will keep supercharging its offering while delivering one-of-a-kind trends and game designs.</p>
<p>The company’s chief executive officer Mark McGinley expressed their excitement to present the new look “at a time when we are entering the next phase of our expansion.” McGinley was also convinced that the rebranding would further enhance FunFair’s identity, better show its personality and explain its unique forward-thinking in a market that is already overly saturated by the current options.</p>
<p>Last September, the company launched with William Hill in the UK. In November 2022, FunFair Games entered the Belgium market via Napoleon Casino.</p>
