<p>The leading provider of engaging games for the iGaming vertical, CT Interactive, announced that its leading games were recertificated for the regulated gambling market in Italy. Thanks to the recent recertification, content from the popular provider for the iGaming industry will continue to power gambling operators in the country, allowing them to leverage games linked to Hot Luck Jackpot.</p>
<p>The Hot Luck Jackpot is a unique functionality offered by CT Interactive that is proven to boost customer engagement, which in turn, delivers benefits for the operators. With Hot Luck Jackpot, operators can offer a 3-level jackpot that may grant players additional winnings.</p>
<p>The jackpot is tracked within a Hot Luck scale that is positioned on the right side of slot games. Each of the bets boosts the scale and helps reach one of the three mystery jackpot levels that include Minor, Major or Mega. Once the scale hits the top, one of those jackpots is hit, awarding the lucky player with extra winnings.</p>
<p>Operators that leverage the jackpot tool can adjust the hit limits and bet limits for each level. In other words, the Hot Luck Jackpot makes an excellent instrument for online gambling operators that can engage with their customers.</p>
<p>Silvia Hristova, CT Interactive's Head of CRM, shared her excitement about the recent announcement in a statement saying: "Our priority as a company is to enrich, improve, and deliver new and existing content to our partners around the world." She added: "We have set a goal for the future to keep expanding our footprints in Italy."</p>
<p>Milena Tsankarska, CT Interactive's Head of Business Development EMEA added: "The Hot Luck Jackpot enables operators to deliver thrilling, personalized experiences that align with their customer retention strategies." She explained that the unique mechanics deliver thrilling options for the players that can secure big prizes.</p>
<p>Tsankarska pointed out: "We are so proud to better the Italian players' experience and make it even more fun and enthralling." Finally, she explained: "This is one of the best jackpot concepts that has proven to be a customer's favorite around the gaming world."</p>
<p>Recently, CT Interactive signed a deal with SpinOro, a fast-growing developer of iGaming content. Under the terms of the recent deal, content from the company was added to SpinOro's aggregation platform. This helped expand further the reach of CT Interactive's popular and engaging products while boosting the offering of the company's aggregation platform.</p>
