<p>Tense Couple of Days for AC Milan</p>
<p>Just three days after playing the Derby Della Madonnina with Inter Milan, AC Milan welcome Newcastle in the Champions League. ‚ÄúRossoneri‚Äù will probably be knackered, but they need to go all-in in this match if they want to challenge for a spot in the knockout stage in 2024. The thing is that they‚Äôre playing in a very tough group.</p>
<p>In addition to them and Newcastle, their group ‚Äì Group F ‚Äì also has Paris SG and Dortmund, both of which are determined to get to the next stage of the competition. That said, dropping points at home against Newcastle could cause serious problems for AC Milan.</p>
<p>There's always one group of death and this season it's Group F üíÄ</p>

<p>The good news is that the season has just started, so AC Milan‚Äôs players are still fired up. Most of them are injury-free and well-rested after the summer break. Plus, the club management has done a fine job during the latest transfer window, making AC Milan‚Äôs roster much better than before.</p>
<p>USMNT‚Äôs Christian Pulisic is their biggest signing, followed by Ruben Loftus-Cheek, Luka Jovic, Samuel Chukwueze, Tijjani Reijnders, Noah Okafor, and a few others.</p>
<p>Newcastle United to Miss a Couple of Key Men</p>
<p>Former AC Milan midfielder Sandro Tonali probably will not play for Newcastle on Tuesday due to an injury setback. He was brilliant for the Magpies since the start of the season, which is what earned him a place in the Italian national soccer team. But he picked up an injury while on international duty.</p>
<p>Eddie Howe was appointed Newcastle head coach last season, with the club 19th and without a win after 11 league games.</p>
<p>In his first full season, he‚Äôs taken the club to the Champions League for the first time since Sir Bobby Robson did in the 2003/04 season. üî≤üè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å•Û†ÅÆÛ†ÅßÛ†Åø#NUFC ‚Ä¢ #UCL pic.twitter.com/ZgmPXHCUsd ‚Äî The Coaches' Voice (@CoachesVoice) May 22, 2023</p>
<p>Sure, there‚Äôs a chance that he might return by September 19, but even if he does, he probably won‚Äôt be 100% fit. As if that wasn‚Äôt enough of a problem for Newcastle, there are a few more players on its injury list ‚Äì Elliot Anderson, Joe Willock, Sven Botman, and a few others.</p>
<p>The good news for coach Eddie Howe is that those players who aren‚Äôt injured are super motivated to give their best in the match with AC Milan. The thing is that a big majority of them have never played in the Champions League before.</p>
<p>AC Milan vs. Newcastle Prediction</p>
<p>AC Milan is just much better than Newcastle. Plus, ‚ÄúRossoneri‚Äù are playing on their turf, and with the help of their fans, they‚Äôre always playing great. Last season, they won four of the six UCL games they played in Milan. We believe they‚Äôre gonna do at least as equally well in the 2023-24 season.</p>
<p>Pick: AC Milan to win and over 2.5 goals</p>
