    <h1>Buffet At Hollywood Casino Doubleu Casino App North Star Casino Hotel Treasure Island Hotel And Casi</h1>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have requested a refund of deposits from FreshBet casino. I included all details of the refund request in an email to the casino’s support address. They replied once stating that they blocked my account and that they were not going to reimburse me.</p>
<p>The complaint is regarding a permanent excluded with Mystakes and its affiliated casino’s such as Freshbet which are all operated by the group Onyxion.</p>
<p>Having problem gambling and having all the blocks in place within the UK such as gamstop and moses blocks.</p>
<p>These Non-Gamstop casino’s deeply impacted someone such as myself when these blocks don’t cover these overseas casinos. In addition to this, Fresh bet has allowed me to play on the casino, verify ID documents and still refuse and reject my first withdrawal with no reply whatsoever!</p>
<p>It was then when i spiralled out of control and deposited multiple times on the site knowing that even with a win, the casino would not let me withdraw due to having a block and permanent exclusion with the sister casino mystakes and the main operator Onyxion who had both previous rejected any and all refund requests - which was fair as i was not previously blocked with them. However, FreshBet knowing that i have a block in place have still allowed me to deposit, cancel my withdrawal and now refusing to refund the deposits.</p>
<p>Despite this, the casino now has stopped replying to my emails. I request a refund of deposits of £1456.</p>
<p>I previously opened complaint on casino guru with a player in the exact same situation as me was able to successfully be refunded. Although the casino Mystakes dragged the complaint on for over 2 years and finally refunded the deposits in the players favour. He similarly had a block with Rolletto also operated by Onyxion.</p>
<p>the link is as follows:</p>
<p>https://casino.guru/mystake-casino-player-s-requesting-a-full-deposit</p>
<p>Hopefully this can save a lot of time or miscommunication and Have my refund processed in a timely manner.</p>
<p>I have not disputed this directly with my bank like the other player as I believe that led to further delays in his case. I kindly ask for casinoguru’s help and assistance.</p>
