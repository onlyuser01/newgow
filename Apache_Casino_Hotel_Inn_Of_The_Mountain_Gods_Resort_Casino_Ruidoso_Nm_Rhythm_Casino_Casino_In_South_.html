<p>Philadelphia Eagles Emerge as New Betting Favorite to Win Super Bowl LVIII</p>

<p>The Philadelphia Eagles are currently +450 odds to win Super Bowl LVIII, according to a recent update by DraftKings. The Eagles are now 9-1 and became the outright favorite for the first time this season after they defeated the Kansas City Chiefs on Monday Night Football.</p>

<p>The Chiefs were the favorite to win the Super Bowl heading into their Week 11 matchup against the Eagles, which was a rematch of last year’s Super Bowl.</p>
<p>Even though the Eagles were a slight betting favorite in Super Bowl LVII, the Chiefs won, 38-35. The Eagles blew a 10-point lead at halftime, and the Chiefs scored 17 points in the fourth quarter to win their second championship with superstar quarterback Patrick Mahomes.</p>
<p>The Chiefs were a -3 favorite when they hosted the Eagles in their rematch on Monday. The Eagles trailed 17-7 at halftime, but their defense shut down the Chiefs in the second half, and they rallied back to win, 21-17.</p>
<p>Once again, the points total hit the under in a primetime game. The total closed at 45.5 over/under and both teams combined for 28 points. Primetime unders are now 27-8 this season.</p>
<p>Soaring Eagles Now 9-1 (+450)</p>
<p>The Eagles began the season 5-0 before the New York Jets upset them in Week 6. They have won four games in a row and improved to 9-1 since that lone loss.</p>
<p>The Eagles defeated three potential playoff teams during their current winning streak. They cruised to a 14-point victory over the Miami Dolphins in Week 7 and held off the Dallas Cowboys in Week 9 in a divisional battle. After a bye in Week 10, the Eagles edged out the Chiefs.</p>
<p>Quarterback Jalen Hurts sustained a knee injury in the second quarter against the Cowboys when linebacker Micah Parsons knocked him to the hybrid grass/turf at Lincoln Financial Field. Hurts remained in the game, and the Eagles indicated he had a bone bruise. The bye week couldn’t have come at a better time, because it provided Hurts extra time to heal up before the showdown with the Chiefs.</p>
<p>He’s tough as heck,” said had coach Nick Siriani. “Never been on the injury report, though, because his play status has never been in doubt. Great leader, great player, rises to the occasion in big time moments.”</p>
<p>Hurts is the current favorite to win the MVP at +250 odds, and he’s just ahead of Lamar Jackson (+350) from the Baltimore Ravens and Mahomes (+400).</p>
<p>With a big victory against the Chiefs on Monday, the Eagles took over the top spot on the NFL futures board for the first time this season. The Eagles are +450 odds to win the Super Bowl heading into Week 12, with seven games remaining on the schedule. They host the Buffalo Bills on Sunday and have a big matchup against the San Francisco 49ers in Week 13.</p>
<p>Chiefs Still Close (+475)</p>
<p>If the Chiefs rallied back to beat the Eagles, they would have remained the consensus favorite to win another Super Bowl. During this season, the Chiefs were the outright betting favorite or cofavorite to win the Super Bowl in six out of the first 10 weeks of the season.</p>
<p>The Chiefs were the preseason favorite at +600 odds to repeat as Super Bowl champions. Winning the Super Bowl in back-to-back seasons is a difficult task in the modern era. The New England Patriots were the last team to pull off consecutive championships in the 2003 and 2004 seasons.</p>
<p>When the 2019 Chiefs won Super Bowl LIV, they advanced to the Super Bowl in the next season. But Tom Brady and the 2020 Tampa Bay Buccaneers denied them back-to-back titles.</p>
<p>The Ravens are now the top team in the AFC at 8-3. The Chiefs are currently tied with the Jacksonville Jaguars, Cleveland Browns, and Dolphins with a 7-3 record. If the season ended today, the Chiefs would secure the #2 playoff seed in the AFC.</p>
<p>The Chiefs lost two out of their last three games, but they’re still the second cofavorite at +475 odds to win the Super Bowl.</p>
<p>Tight end Travis Kelce is dating pop star Taylor Swift, which had an impact on the betting markets. Swift wasn’t in attendance on Monday, but the Chiefs are undefeated at 3-0 when she attends a game.</p>
<p>San Francisco 49ers Back on Track (+475)</p>
<p>The San Francisco 49ers looked unstoppable when they jumped out to a 5-0 record to start this season. Quarterback Brock Purdy sustained a concussion in Week 5, and the 49ers lost three games in a row, before bouncing back with two consecutive victories.</p>
<p>The 49ers (7-3) are the third-best team in the NFC behind the Eagles and Detroit Lions (8-2). They play three road games over the next four weeks before they host the Ravens on Christmas in Week 16.</p>
<p>Running back Christian McCaffrey has been a touchdown machine in his first full season with the 49ers. He scored 14 touchdowns in 10 games with nine rushing scores and five touchdown receptions. The dual-threat McCaffrey generated 1,189 yards from scrimmage this season, and the 49ers have a legit shot to win the Super Bowl so long as he remains healthy.</p>
<p>The 49ers were the betting favorite or cofavorite to win the Super Bowl for seven out of the first 10 weeks of the season. The Chiefs and 49ers are both +475 odds to win Super Bowl LVIII as the second cofavorite on the futures board behind the Eagles.</p>
<p>The 49ers haven’t won a Super Bowl since the 1994 season. They made two trips to the Super Bowl since 2012, but were the runner-up both times, narrowly missing a sixth championship for the franchise.</p>
