<p>Jelly is “really pleased” to be recognized by the MGA and the UKGC</p>
<p>Jelly Entertainment, an independent, industry-recognized real-money game developer, announced that its proprietary platform has secured regulatory approval in two new markets. According to the company, its business now boasts new licenses in the United Kingdom and Malta.</p>
<p>The company noted that the United Kingdom’s Gambling Commission (UKGC) provided it with a game host license. In the meantime, the Malta Gaming Authority (MGA) issued a recognition notice to the supplier.</p>
<p>As announced, the new approvals provide Jelly with full control of its proprietary technology development and delivery schedule in the two markets, allowing it to expand its European footprint. For reference, the company’s games are already certified in the two markets.</p>
<p>Jelly, which secured a license renewal in Sweden earlier that year, continues its efforts to expand and diversify its business.</p>
<p>Jelly Wants to Become a Full-Service Supplier</p>
<p>David Newstead, Jelly’s chief executive officer, commented on the development, expressing his team’s excitement about the two new licenses. He said that his team is “really pleased” to be recognized by the MGA and the UKGC, lauding its new licenses as an “exciting step forward” in the company’s journey toward becoming a full-service B2B supplier.</p>
<p>Newstead thanked the two regulators for their invaluable help, saying that his team is hoping to soon see Jelly’s titles in the lobbies of multiple leading operators.</p>
<p>Our thanks to the Gambling Commission and Malta Gaming Authority for helping us to achieve another important step on our journey, and we’re looking forward to seeing our titles land in a number of lobbies across Europe and beyond soon. David Newstead, CEO, Jelly</p>
<p>In other news, Jelly Entertainment just completed its acquisition of Wundermachine, a deal expected to play a key role in the future growth and expansion of Jelly Entertainment. This acquisition was also in line with Jelly’s desire to evolve beyond a challenger company and become a full-service B2B gambling supplier.</p>
