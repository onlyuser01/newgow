    <h1>Mohegan Casino Resorts World Casino New York Riverwind Casino Hotel New Orleans Casino Hotel Fremont</h1>

<p>Our conversation with Vadim Potapenko, Head of Sales at Turbo Games, at the SBC Summit Barcelona was definitely one of the most interesting ones. We found out a lot about how Turbo Games is building this new genre of games that are focused on blockchain-like experiences and trying to buck the trend from traditional iGaming game development.</p>
<p>Turbo Games is betting on nostalgic games, but they are all designed in a way that is future-proof, argues Vadim. Innovation is important, he said, as consumers want to experience new things in the industry. This doesn’t mean that old themes cannot be recreated successfully. Find out more in our conversation with Vadim.</p>
<p>Q1: Vadim, can you tell us a little more about what Turbo Games does and how important is your work in the context of present-day iGaming?</p>
<p>We are a young Ukrainian company. We mostly do games that are focused on the crash and mine verticals and segments. Some call these instant games, but we prefer to call them turbo games instead. We like the concept of turbo games as they have a bit of a nostalgic angle that we have been able to leverage successfully.</p>
<p>I would also add that the data and stats we have show that we are somewhere between sports betting and casino. We have a lot of interesting games where players get to have a bit more control, strategizing, and calculating the odds of success. Players choose when to cash out, how much to risk, and so on.</p>
<p>Q2: You focus your development process on a new generation of blockchain-inspired games. Do you see a good rate of adoption among stakeholders and consumers?</p>
<p>I would say that this is not something we necessarily pioneered as a concept. But then again, we can see a strong market adoption insofar as cryptocurrency betting is concerned. We can see that cryptocurrency betting and games are becoming more popular and people are more attracted to the blockchain segment as a whole, and our games in particular.</p>
<p>Q3: How soon do you think it would be before the iGaming industry begins adopting blockchain and cryptocurrency gaming experiences on a larger scale?</p>
<p>Well, I mostly agree with all cryptocurrency specialists who argue that once we see retail adoption of cryptocurrency, these payment options will also become way more popular in the iGaming industry as well.I actually think that once fashion retailers and the fashion market adopt cryptocurrency, we can expect the same to happen in the iGaming industry.</p>
<p>Q4: Turbo Games prides itself on providing games that are "provably fair." Can you tell us a little more about this concept in general?</p>
<p>Yes, so essentially this is a technology that empowers the consumers to check each bet and transaction and ensure that it has been carried out fairly and without manipulation. Players can track the results and if they are fair or not. There is a bet history that is shareable, and people can discuss it openly.</p>
<p>Q5: Are your products focused exclusively on blockchain and cryptocurrency casinos, or do you want to see them listed at casinos that do not necessarily identify themselves as such?</p>
<p>We are basically open to all partners and casinos. I can tell you that we are right now expanding our products to local markets and local licensees. As a startup, as a new company, we are very aggressive with our strategy, and we will rollout our products in more markets and with more companies. We hope that eventually, all operators will have our games. For the last six months, we have added around 40+ operators, which is very encouraging</p>
<p>Q6: What are the advantages of going on this road of game development?</p>
<p>The biggest advantage is the type of games that we build, I think. The second advantage is that we focus on the players as much as possible. We have different volatility levels and I think this is good for the players as well, because it lets them choose what to play. For example, personally, I like to try and strategize whether one volatility level or another is going to work and under what specific conditions.</p>
<p>So, yes if a player likes high volatility games, they can go for it. Also, I think that the simplicity of the games is another strong benefit in their favor – and, as I mentioned, they are definitely nostalgic, and players do like that.We think that everybody can get used to these types of games, and we really enjoy the product that we put to market.</p>
<p>Q7: What’s your designing process like when looking to expand on your portfolio of blockchain-inspired games?</p>
<p>Basically, since we are new and we don’t have that many games, we try to have a baseline of two new games each month. For the time being, we are covering all the niches. We focus on simple games right now and some very familiar themes that are still in the works and coming to market soon.</p>
<p>We are in the process of developing our portfolio and using the information and feedback we collect this way to actually make informed decisions about the future. But besides these familiar themes, we also want to build unique experiences that players can still relate to but perceive as something new.</p>
<p>At this time, it’s also challenging to make it both very simple and not overdo it at the same time.</p>
<p>Q8: Why do you think these games would make a more appealing product to the mass consumer who is accustomed to slots, live dealer games, and table games already?</p>
<p>Alright, so first of all these games we are trying to develop – that we are developing – they are for audiences that are interested in streamers in esports and so on. We feel strongly that even casino players want something new, and this is where our products come in. Gambling and online casinos are not only about slots. You can definitely try other segments, too, such as the crash games, or try the live roulette.</p>
<p>Q9: Any predictions for the future of blockchain in iGaming?</p>
<p>It will be more about NFTs and, of course – Web3. These things are definitely coming. The casino will get a share in that. Now, I am not quite sure how this will unfold – whether it would be through NFTs, cryptocurrencies, or something else, it doesn’t matter – it will be all part of the future of the industry.</p>
