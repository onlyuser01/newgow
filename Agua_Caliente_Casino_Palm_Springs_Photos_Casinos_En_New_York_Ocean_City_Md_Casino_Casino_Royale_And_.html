<p>The new game is marked by the addition of a new mechanic, the Bonus Wheel Multiplier, which is among the first times that the feature has been introduced to the online gaming world. Gaming Corps sought and found inspiration for its new product in the land-based sector.</p>
<p>Innovating Blackjack Experience Online</p>
<p>As a result, the company now lets players enjoy a multiplier up to 1,000x based on their bet, provided that they opt into the side bet. The multiplier prize levels are picked at random, with players tempted to see what the next winning multiplier may bring.</p>
<p>The game still uses a classic table design, making it recognizable and intuitive while layering the new feature on top for a complete experience across the board. The company is confident that it can continue to deliver its products across numerous markets.</p>
<p>Gaming Corps’ new game now has the opportunity to reach players and audiences in the Dutch and Greek iGaming markets, after the company obtained licenses to provide its products in both countries. At the same time, Gaming Corps is committed to maintaining a robust pace of development, adding new experiences, and bringing popular titles in new wrappings that create value for the end customers.</p>
<p>Always on the Lookout to Improve Player Experience</p>
<p>Gaming Corps head of games Connor Blinman welcomed the opportunity and said that his company was constantly on the lookout to innovate the iGaming experience for players through new environments, more features, and additional layers, making players even keener to come back for more. Blinman said:</p>
<p>By adding a Bonus Wheel in Blackjack Bonus Wheel 1000, we feel the game strikes the perfect balance of delivering greater excitement on landing blackjack whilst remaining true to the heart of the game. We’re looking forward to seeing the results. Gaming Corps head of games Connor Blinman</p>
<p>Gaming Corps has been rapidly expanding across the iGaming landscape, driving strong innovation along its way. The company is known for the development of table as well as slot games. It has also established a solid footprint in verticals such as plinko and crash-style gaming, among others.</p>
