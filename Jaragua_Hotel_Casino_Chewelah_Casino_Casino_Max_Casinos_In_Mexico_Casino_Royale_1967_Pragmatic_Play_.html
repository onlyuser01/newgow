    <h1>Jaragua Hotel Casino Chewelah Casino Casino Max Casinos In Mexico Casino Royale 1967 Pragmatic Play</h1>

<p>The supplier has stepped up its partnership with Interwetten through the introduction of a dedicated roulette game for the operator</p>
<p>As a result, the company will now offer a customized solution for players at Interwetten and provide local audiences with a branded roulette table for them to enjoy. The game will ensure an integrated and seamless experience and make a nice addition to Interwetten lineup of games.</p>
<p>Bespoke Roulette Table Comes to Interwetten</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play will leverage its ample experience in the development of unique interactive casino products to provide Interwetten with the live casino experience that it deserves and elevate the gameplay for players.</p>
<p>Interwetten and Pragmatic have already been working together with the supplier featuring its library of slots at the casino. Commenting on the latest opportunity, Pragmatic Play COO Irina Cornides said:</p>
<p>Interwetten is a valued partner of Pragmatic Play, and I am delighted to see our relationship grow further with the launch of the new branded Roulette table. Pragmatic Play COO Irina Cornides</p>
<p>She said that Pragmatic was a specialist in crafting and deploying customizable solutions that would now resonate with the partner’s audiences. Cornides also confirmed that her company is now looking to provide partners with more customizable and bespoke experiences that are the future of what the supplier wants to do next.</p>
<p>Interwetten head of product Mario Bilic was similarly stoked to welcome more top-performing games and introduce them to the brand’s audiences. “We are proud to now be able to count a unique branded solution to our Live Casino content, which we have no doubt will further boost player engagement,” Bilic said.</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play’s Steady Pace of Expansion</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play has been scaling up its presence in regulated markets all over the world. The company has managed to sign a new partnership with Grand Casino Luzern, and the company’s online casino brand, mycasino, in Switzerland.</p>
<p>The partnership covers the live casino portfolio by Pragmatic and is a continuation and an extension of an earlier collaboration focusing on the slots portfolio. Pragmatic has similarly sought to grow its footprint in the Netherlands and has done so successfully with none other than ComeOn Group, a very well-represented local brand.</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play’s globe-trotting ambitions have not stopped at Europe, with the company driving strong forays in Africa, and Ghana in particular.</p>
