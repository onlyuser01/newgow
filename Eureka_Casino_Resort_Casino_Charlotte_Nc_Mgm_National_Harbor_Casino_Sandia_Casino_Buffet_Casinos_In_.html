<p>When Entain rebranded from GVC Holdings, it did so while adopting a new slogan, “For the good of entertainment.” The global sports betting and gaming company is now looking to expand in developing new experiences that would allow it to deliver on this mantra.</p>
<p>As a result, Entain has revealed the launch of Ennovate, an innovation hub initiative that will enable the company to pursue projects across immersive sports, the metaverse, virtual and augmented reality, and other aspects of entertainment.</p>
<p>“For the Good of Entertainment”</p>
<p>The first facility under the Ennovate facility will set up shop in London, close to TikTok and Snapchat’s corporate headquarters. Ennovate will invest up to $134 million (£100 million) to work on various start-up investments, collaborations, and innovation projects with European and British partners.</p>
<p>Entain will collaborate with several tech companies to see its ambitious plan through, including BT, Verizon, and Theta Labs. Commenting on the planned changes, Entain CEO Jette Nygaard-Andersen said:</p>
<p>“We want to lead the way with new, exciting products and experiences for customers and use our cutting-edge technology to pioneer innovations in sport, gaming, and interactive entertainment for the metaverse.” Entain CEO Jette Nygaard-Andersen</p>
<p>The company earmarked $53.74 million (£40 million) of the investment to develop innovation in the United Kingdom. Entain will advance a variety of entertainment products, including non-fungible tokens (NFTs). This comes at a time when partypoker is announcing plans to launch its first official NFTs in collaboration with Theta Labs.</p>
<p>Ennovate will also advance its virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) solutions. One would be a “pioneering VR multi-sports club experience” that the group is also introducing soon.</p>
<p>Not least, there will be VR arcades that will be located on high streets with two earmarked locations converted into experience zones where initial tests will take place. Effectively, Entain is bringing VR in retail spaces as soon as possible and will be opening its first dedicated arcades in 2022.</p>
<p>Pioneering Innovation in Sports, Gaming and Interactive Entertainment</p>
<p>Nygaard-Andersen added that Entain would demonstrate how its technology would pioneer sports, gaming, and interactive entertainment innovation. The first Ennovate lab space will be opened in Charterhouse Square, Farringdon, London, the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>The goal of the facility would be to allow partners, employees, and investors to test out new immersive experiences across all verticals in which the company has a stake. Entain COO Sandeep Tiku added:</p>
<p>“Our goal is to bring the most exciting experiences in immersive sport, gaming and interactive entertainment to life as the metaverse takes shape.” Entain COO Sandeep Tiku</p>
<p>Beyond changing entertainment for the better, Entain wants to use Ennovate to bring around significant societal and environmental benefits in line with Entain’s sustainability agenda. This two-pronged approach whereby Entain innovates entertainment and develops real benefits to society will define the company’s future strategy.</p>
