    <h1>Aces Casino Belterra Casino And Resort Miami Casinos Casino Vancouver Wa Mohawk Casino 7777 Gaming T</h1>

<p>The supplier will bring more than 100 exciting and highly entertaining titles to Hub88 clients</p>
<p>Hub88 is confident that the deal with 7777 gaming will allow it to significantly improve the quality of its library of products and provide its network of partners with more excellent choices to choose from.</p>
<p>7777 Gaming Ready to Pivot towards MGA Markets</p>
<p>Presently, Hub88 features more than 80 providers along with an excess of 7,000 games, making it one of the best companies to provide tier-one companies with the products they are looking for.</p>
<p>All games on the list use provably fair RNGs and add a unique gameplay experience. The integration and delivery are done through a single API and 7777 gaming is happy to add its strong variety of casino products to Hub88, further helping it boost its strength in existing markets and expand into new geographies.</p>
<p>7777 gaming recently acquired a license from the Malta Gaming Authority (MGA) which will give it a significant boost in global iGaming markets. This permit will enable 7777 and Hub88 to better calibrate their joint efforts in pushing the supplier’s content with the full network of partners in jurisdictions where the studio has a license.</p>
<p>Hub88 head Ollie Castleman said that 7777 gaming was a company that shared the company’s own core volumes:</p>
<p>We’re thrilled to add 7777 gaming’s incredible product portfolio to our platform as their titles walk in a class of their own. We look forward to working together and reinforcing the partnership soon. Hub88 head Ollie Castleman</p>
<p>7777 gaming CCO Elena Shaterova welcomed the opportunity to see her company team up with Hub88 and benefit from the strong partner network of opportunities now available to the company.</p>
<p>Supplier Confident in the Success of the New Partnership</p>
<p>Shaterova said that 7777 gaming’s entire team was looking to work closely with Hub88, and to make the company’s titles known to more players across the world. She similarly expressed confidence that the company’s MGA license would definitely play a key role in the supplier’s further expansion and reach.</p>
<p>7777 gaming has been on a roll in recent weeks. The company signed a partnership with IGT PlayDigital, enabling the supplier’s titles to appear on the prominent platform and with partner casinos.</p>
<p>Shaterova hailed that development, too, emphasizing the importance of building engaging portfolios of games for players to experiment with. A similar partnership was established with Infingame, an aggregator of iGaming content at the end of January.</p>
