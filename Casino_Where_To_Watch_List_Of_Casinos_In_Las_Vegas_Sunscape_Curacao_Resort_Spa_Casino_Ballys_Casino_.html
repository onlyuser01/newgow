    <h1>Casino Where To Watch List Of Casinos In Las Vegas Sunscape Curacao Resort Spa Casino Ballys Casino</h1>

<p>The Canadian gambling operator that offers sports wagering and online casino gambling, Sports Interaction, became the latest operator to receive an iGaming license from the gambling regulator in Ontario, a new report reveals.</p>
<p>Sports Interaction Receives License from Ontario Gambling Regulator</p>
<p>The gambling watchdog in the most populous Canadian province, Ontario, the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario (AGCO), granted Sports Interaction an internet gaming license, according to a new report released by Sports Handle. It is yet to be confirmed how the license will impact Sports Interaction’s existing customers in Ontario. However, it is certain that the brand joins leading operators that have already secured their licenses to operate within the regulated market in Ontario.</p>
<p>Sports Interaction’s license comes after early in April, Ontario opened its internet gaming market. As a result, the AGCO was tasked with registering the operators that showed interest in operating within the regulated market in Canada’s most populous province. Besides receiving a license from the AGCO, iGaming operators in Ontario must also ink an operating agreement with iGaming Ontario. This would effectively allow them to offer their games in the province.</p>
<p>Before Sports Interaction, leading operators such as PointsBet, Bet365 and theScore have already received licenses from the AGCO. PokerStars, as well as Bally’s, are also among the companies that received a license from the gambling regulator in Ontario.</p>
<p>The AGCO Imposed a Monetary Penalty against Unibet</p>
<p>Citing regulator breaches, the AGCO unveiled a monetary sanction earlier this week. The Commission said Thursday it imposed a CA$48,000 ($73,150) monetary penalty against Unibet ON Inc. According to the AGCO, the operator allegedly breached advertising regulations. The allegations date back to May this year and claim that the operator released “multiple broad gambling inducements that promoted “generous welcome offers.” Such inducements, according to the regulator are in breach of the regulations for internet gaming currently in place.</p>
<p>“We expect all registered operators to achieve and maintain the high standards of responsible gambling, player protection and game integrity.” Tom Mungham, CEO and registrar at the AGCO</p>
<p>Tom Mungham, AGCO’s chief executive officer and registrar, outlined that the commission expects all licensed operators to adhere to the regulations for game integrity, player protection, as well as responsible gambling. He reaffirmed that the AGCO will further monitor the activity of the gaming operators to ensure they all adhere to the Gaming Control act and the Standards set in Ontario.</p>
