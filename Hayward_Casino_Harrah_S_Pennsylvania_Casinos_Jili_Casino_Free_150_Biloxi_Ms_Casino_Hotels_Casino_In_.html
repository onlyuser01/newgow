<p>Tropicool 2 review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Tropicool 2 is themed around a whimsical seaside holiday.</p>
<p>Players will grab a piña colada as they step out onto the tropical sunshine and arctic ice. Golden sand, turquoise water, and a wayward iceberg make a unique setting as players collect as much ripe fruit as they can.</p>
<p>Happy Hour win in the Tropicool slot machine</p>
<p>This slot will appeal to fans of fruit machine themes, as well as those longing for a tropical escape.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>Tropicool 2 features personified animal characters, including a surfer sloth, a flamingo in a swimsuit, and a toucan in a top hat. Each of these adorable creatures is illustrated in a colorful cartoon style that brings life to the seaside world.</p>
<p>On the reels, there are a variety of tropical fruit symbols, including pineapples, coconuts, and limes. Classic fruit machine fruits such as lemons, plums, and oranges are also included.</p>
<p>Behind the reels, players will see a beach resort and festively decorated palm trees. In the distance, a towering iceberg floats in the warm, tropical ocean. Players will be left to speculate about how such an enormous chunk of arctic ice made its way to the tropics.</p>
<p>The jazz-infused soundtrack features saxophone notes that create a relaxing vibe.</p>
<p>Main Free Spins bonus feature with multipliers</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Tropicool 2 is a six-reel, six-row slot.</p>
<p>Wins are awarded when players land matching symbols in adjacent reels, starting from the leftmost reel.</p>
<p>Upon wins, winning symbols will disappear, making way for new symbols to fall in from above.</p>
<p>There are a total of 46,656 ways to win, and the maximum win is €2,500,000.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all paying symbols except the Bird symbols.</p>
<p>Mystery symbols reveal a paying symbol at the conclusion of a spin.</p>
<p>Mystery Symbols turn into random symbol</p>
<p>Locked Wild symbols have the special ability to remain on the reels for 3 wins.</p>
<p>Row Swap symbols replace all other symbols in their row excluding Wild, Elmo, and Bonus symbols.</p>
<p>The Row Swap symbol changes entire row of symbols</p>
<p>The Elmo Redrops are triggered when the sloth character, Elmo, appears on the reels. At this point, redrops of the reels will continue until Elmo walks away.</p>
<p>Elmo symbol drops in for another bonus feature of the game</p>
<p>The Birds to Wilds feature occurs when Elmo transforms Bird symbols into Wild symbols by ‘scaring’ them.</p>
<p>This slot features symbols in a variety of sizes, including 1x1, 2x2, and 3x3, with the Big symbols creating more potential wins.</p>
<p>The Free Drops Bonus game is triggered when players land at least 3 Bonus symbols. The number of free spins awarded is decided by the number of triggering Bonus symbols:</p>
<p>3 Bonus symbols: 6 free spins</p>
<p>4 Bonus symbols: 9 free spins</p>
<p>5 Bonus symbols: 12 free spins</p>
<p>6 Bonus symbols: 15 free spins</p>
<p>During the Free Drops Bonus, additional special symbols are available, including the Extra Drops symbol which provides additional free spins, and the Win Multiplier symbol which contributes a multiplier of 1x, 2x, or 3x.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of Tropicool 2 is 94.00%, well below our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.20 up to a maximum of $/£/€100 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of Tropicool is high, which would have made it a good match for our preferred slot machine strategies if it offered a higher RTP. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We do not recommend this low RTP, high volatility beach holiday-themed slot.</p>
<p>Tropicool 2 offers a whimsical theme and cute characters, but this is not enough to redeem this slot's disappointing RTP.</p>
<p>Some players might choose to try this slot and explore its bonus features, but they would do well to move on to slots that can provide a more favorable RTP.</p>
