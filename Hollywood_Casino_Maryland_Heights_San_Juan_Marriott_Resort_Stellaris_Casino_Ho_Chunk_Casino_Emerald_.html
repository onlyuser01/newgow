<p>The SBC Summit Barcelona wrapped up this year with the event moving to the Palau National where the organizers hosted the SBC Awards, the grand finale of a year of hard work during which SBC Events awarded some of the most accomplished companies in the gambling industry.</p>
<p>Among them was Betsson Group which managed to achieve great success across numerous categories, including Casino Operator of the Year. Betsson was also awarded the Best Affiliate Program of the Year and it snatched a third distinction, the Western European Operator of the Year award. All in all, Betsson performed very well this year and walked away a deserved winner.</p>
<p>This also marked the ninth edition of the SBC Awards event, which was co-hosted by Kirsty Gallacher and Gaizka Mendieta. A total of 45 operators, affiliates, suppliers, and payment companies won among a stiff competition and in front of 800 senior sports betting and iGaming industryveterans and executives.</p>
<p>SBC founder &amp; CEO Rasmus Sojmark was very happy with the event and the turnup, and also the award ceremony itself. "Some very fierce competitors and such a fun-filled ceremony! The Awards night is something I always look forward to as it reminds us that hard work pays off and teaches us to recognize the achievements of our peers. Congratulations to all the winners," enthusiastic Sojmark said.</p>
<p>There was much competition and many deserved winners across the board, with Raketech Group winning the Affiliate Product Innovation of the Year, and Sportradar Group snatching the Sportsbook Supplier of the Year Award. Relax Gaming won another big distinction with the Casino/Slots Develop of the Year.</p>
<p>Pinnacle was once again pronounced the Esports Supplier of the Year, and Evolution continued to reign supreme as Live Casino Supplier. Playtech managed to win the Platform Provider of the Year in the meantime. There were many rising stars, though, with Uplatform named the Rising Star in the Sports Betting Innovation &amp; Software category and PopOK Gaming winning in the iGaming equivalent of the category.</p>
<p>Naturally, the company honored many of the actual leaders who help the industry thrive. The awardees included David Flynn from Glitnor Group and Katerina Biloruska from Parimatch Foundation. The event proved to be a major success, despite the slight changes to scheduling, and moving forward, this could be the way SBC chooses to do things, adding the SBC Awards right after their SBC Barcelona Summit. Only time will show what other plans SBC has for the future, though.</p>
