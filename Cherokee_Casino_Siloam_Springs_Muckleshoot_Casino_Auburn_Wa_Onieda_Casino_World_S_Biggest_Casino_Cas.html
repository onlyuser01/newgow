<p>Dear Ulrika,</p>
<p>We are really sorry you are disappointed, but we believe that the reason for that is just some kind of misunderstanding.</p>
<p>First of all, we would like to mention that you are more than welcome to contact us via email or live chat and our support team is available and eager to help 24/7. The information regarding the direct contact with our support team is available to the public on the main page of our website, and it is easy to find.</p>
<p>Moreover, the reason your withdrawal was cancelled is that you were kindly requested to go through a verification procedure and meet wager requirements. By wager requirements we mean the rule specified in general terms and conditions which says, that "Money deposited in the Casino must be used for gaming activity. Due to this, all deposits need to be wagered at least three (3) times." We have for sure informed you of the cancellation reason via email multiple times, but unfortunately did not hear back from you.</p>
<p>Furthermore, you are not exactly right regarding the statement that you can only withdraw your winnings via Bank Transfer. You can definitely use your credit card for withdrawal. We have only informed you of the fact that unfortunately, we have noticed the negative tendency lately that not so many withdrawals Swedish players made to credit card, were successful. That means there is a risk your withdrawal to the credit card could possibly be cancelled due to technical reasons. We wanted to inform you of that, so it would not be an unpleasant surprise for you.</p>
<p>As we can see, you have contacted us via live chat and you were provided with instructions regarding verification procedure. Unfortunately you did not follow our recommendations.</p>
<p>Solution we suggest for you now, is to verify the account and order a withdrawal. In case you experience any difficulties with uploading the documents or have additional questions, we would be happy to be of further assistance anytime.</p>
<p>Besides, we would kindly ask you to check your email box and find out why you do not receive our emails if it is the case.</p>
<p>Hope for your understanding and further cooperation.</p>
<p>Kindest regards,</p>
<p>Megaslot Casino</p>
