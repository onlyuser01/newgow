<p>Australian sports betting operator with a global reach PointsBet has announced plans to expand its presence in Ireland as the company recently opened its European headquarters in the capital, Dublin. While basing its headquarters in Dublin, the company is still firmly focused on further expansion across the North American market.</p>
<p>According to The Irish Times, this is the first significant foray in Europe, but it’s earmarked to help with further expansionist appetites in the North American market, which will remain the most important market for the company, it seems. The office in Dublin doesn’t mean that the company is seeking to begin European operations as well, as PointsBet is clearly not licensed in any of the regulated markets on the continent.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the firm’s global headquarters is currently based in Denver as it is focused on expansion in the United States and Canada. PointsBet continues to maintain a healthy presence in Australia, which is its native market and has been focusing on developing a full-stack solution that powers the company’s retail and online operations.</p>
<p>The new European office will seek to hire at least 70 new staff members, focusing on quantitative analysts, developers, and product managers as the most in-demand and sought-after professionals. But the company will not stop here with its operations in Europe either.</p>
<p>According to the Chief Executive Officer for the United States, Johnny Aitken, what will follow is a rapid hiring push in the coming year and more if all goes well. The Dublin location is also a strategic one.</p>
<p>In comments to the Irish Times, Aitken did explain that any growth will be based on current company needs and consumer demand but overall expected the legalized sports betting to drive a strong recruitment push. Making a bold prediction about the future, Aitken added:</p>
<p>"I could see certainly that quickly swelling into the 200-300 employee range in Dublin over the next three to five years. There’s no doubt in my mind that we need to continue to fuel growth in Dublin which is going to reap a lot of success for our global business."</p>
<p>The launch of a headquarters in Dublin makes sense in light of PointsBet’s acquisition of Banach Technology, a local company, which was bought out by the Australian bookmaker back in 2021 for the sum total of $43m. PointsBet recently secured a $65.6m investment to bolster its operational reach.</p>
<p>The company has not been solely focusing on the sports betting segment either, as it has been successful in ensuring that it also improves its online casino operations, leading to a launch of a casino product in Pennsylvania.</p>
