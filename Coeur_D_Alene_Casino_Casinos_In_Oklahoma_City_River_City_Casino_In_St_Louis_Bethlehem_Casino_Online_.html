    <h1>Coeur D Alene Casino Casinos In Oklahoma City River City Casino In St Louis Bethlehem Casino Online</h1>

<p>Hello Jeremy,</p>
<p>Having contacted the casino representative, we would like to share the result with you.</p>
<p>We've been informed that on 5/5/2020 at 14:18:45 (EST) you placed your 1st deposit of $75 and played it down to $12 balance by 5/5/2020 14:51:03 (EST). Right after you placed your 2nd $75 deposit and claimed bonus called TRUEROYAL that gives 240% on top of the deposit + 40 Free Spins on game Bubble Bubble 2 with wagering requirement of 35x Bonus+Deposit = $8,925. Once the bonus is claimed - playable balance is counted as bonus money. In this case you will be able to withdraw your winnings only once the playthrough requirement is fulfilled and your bonus money is converted into cash. At the moment you're referring to, the only amount of real cash available was the $12 from the previous deposit since balance wasn't cleared from wagering requirement.</p>
<p>Please let me know if you need any further assistance.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>TOP1 Team</p>
