    <h1>Nugget Casino Sparks Best Casino Slot Machines Casino Betting Online First Council Casino Hotel Ceph</h1>

<p>Dear davex3,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting this complaint. I'm sorry to hear about your negative experience with No Limit Bet Casino. Please allow me to ask you a few questions to make sure I understand your situation completely.</p>
<p>Can you please provide some clarification on the double charge for the €50 deposit? Are there two separate transactions of €50 listed on your bank statement, but only one of them has been credited to your casino account? Have you verified both payments?</p>
<p>Regarding the other deposit of 48€, if it has never been credited to your casino account, the only thing I would recommend is contacting your payment provider and requesting confirmation that the payment was successfully processed and received by the casino. The payment provider needs to investigate, but bear in mind, that it’s a complicated process that takes approximately one month. In these cases, the casino usually has its hands tied.</p>
<p>I’m sorry that we couldn’t be of much help at this time. I will leave this complaint open for a month and kindly ask you to keep us updated. Thank you very much for your understanding.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Veronika</p>
