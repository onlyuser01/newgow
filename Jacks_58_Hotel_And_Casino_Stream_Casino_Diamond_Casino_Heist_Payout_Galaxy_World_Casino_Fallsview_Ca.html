<p>Dear xid666,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint and forwarding all the relevant communication and screenshots. Iâ€™m very sorry to hear about your negative experience. I have checked promotional terms and conditions, and this is what I found https://www.bobbycasino.com/terms/:</p>
<p>"Reference to the "Account" shall mean an account registered by you on the web site when acceptive and agreeing to those Terms. By registering an Account you declare that you are over 18 years older or of the next minimum legal age as stipulated within the jurisdiction of your residence below the laws applicable to you. It's your sole responsibility to understand whether or not the services obtainable on the web site are legal within the country of your residence. Kindly check status of Countries list https://www.bobbycasino.com/countries. Persons below age of 18 years aren't allowed to use the web site and/or any services obtainable on that."</p>
<p>I would like to emphasize, that according to our fair gambling codex https://casino.guru/fair-gambling-codex-for-casinos#restricted-bonuses, we believe that casinos should only give bonuses to players who are allowed to get them according to the Bonus T&amp;Cs. And if the casino makes the mistake of granting a bonus to a player who shouldn't have received it, the casino shouldn't take it away from them. Instead, the casino should accept that it was their mistake and pay out the winnings to the player.</p>
<p>I hope we will be able to help you to resolve this issue as soon as possible. Looking forward to hearing from you.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
