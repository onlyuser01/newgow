    <h1>Lucky Lands Casino Stations Casino Seneca Niagara Resort Casino 4Th Street Niagara Falls Ny Taxes On</h1>

<p>Hi Nick, I have been playing with many casinos since two years. But, I never had such a bad experience when playing a particular slot. I also very much understand the speed of a particular slot machine. I played almost for three days on Parimatch casino and I lost almost Inr 17000. I would have not been disappointed because of the money which I lost. But, I am disappointed because I was made to lose by your casino.Hence, I have raised this complaint. I lost much more bigger amount than this with other casinos in 2years.but,I didn't raise a single complaint based on software glitch on any of the casinos.Because,I never experienced any software glitch with others like yours. I am very much sure that your casino has manipulated it's slots. Because, the speed and behavior of slots put in your casino and the speed &amp; behavior of a particular slot compared with others is completely different.</p>
<p>Most of the times I played Pragmatic play slots with every casino where I have an account since 2 years. Spending Two years on a particular game provider it's not a joke. A player who spends this much of a long time understands better of any slot than their providers who design their slots. Please don't talk about bad luck because the payouts cannot be same continuously for three days. I don't even believe in luck at all when playing on online casinos. I understand that the slots are designed in such a way that the casino always beats a player and end up making profits in long run. I am okay with that if rtp has been designed to make a casinos profitable by providers. But, it's not ok for me when a casino itself has done some software glitch. I would like to tell you that I am not blaming your casino because of the money I lost. I almost lost 30 times of money what I lost in yours on other casinos and most of the times I was in profit in beginning stages. But, I started playing on regular basis because of entertainment and I eventually lost what I won. I knew that the slots will yield negative returns in long run and I was satisfied with that conclusion. But, I am not satisfied with your casino because you have completely rigged your slots. I urge everyone who sees this complaint can go play and check the behavior of slots on Parimatch,namely, Great Rhino Megaways(pragmatic) which runs so fast than usual, and Frankie's holidays of green jade which runs very tight.it's behavior is not normal, and so on I can name them all where I found software glitch.</p>
<p>And, you said about bad luck. You know the luck and bad luck of a player is definitely decided by your casino. You decide their fate, it's not their actual luck or bad luck.</p>
<p>ONE THING, I would like to suggest your casino that the RTP has been designed in such a way that the casinos make money in long run. But, why you people think of making money in a overnight just by fooling players???,</p>
<p>Please keep in mind It's not that easy to fool players. Now days social media is so strong and it can ruin anyone's reputation in a day . Please don't create problems yourselves. Please adhere to basics of a casinos ethics in maintaining fair software. You may think that you can make money easily by fooling customers but it's your wrong perception. you know how?? You have just made a profit(loot) of Inr 17000 from me in short time in an unethical way. BUT, you you lost so much of profit coming from me in long run if I stick to your casino for long run. Let's assume I play for 5 years from now and I happen to make negative returns of 1000 on daily basis.You have lost an estimated return of 1000<em>30</em>12<em>5=360000</em>5=1800000(18 lacs). Even if I lose an amount of just Inr 1000 per day for 5 years it would have yielded your casino an amount of eighteen lacs. Which would have come in long run from one player. But, instead you have just looted a small amount of Inr 17k. Don't you think it's a foolishness???</p>
<p>Please don't loot, please be ethical what you do. Do good or bad but be ethical in your karma you do. If you do good get better but if you do bad eventually you get worst. There is a supreme power which manipulates everything in this universe and everything is viewed by that supreme power. Be loyal to your karma you do. Running a casino or playing on casino both are bad karmas. But, if you follow ethics even in bad karmas you will gain better things. I think this should be a lesson to your casino. Please never cheat anyone. Try gaining trust of large number of players across the globe so that you can make maximum profits. Just adopt it and try it.. I don't need that money what I lost on your rigged slots. I know that you will not accept this truth. But, stop cheating and looting and it's my humble request in all the casinos those have rigged their games.</p>
