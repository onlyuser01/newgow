    <h1>Crocs Resort And Casino Costa Rica Pointsbet Casino Indiana Grand Casino Casino Poker Coeur D Alene</h1>

<p>Hello!</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Have you successfully completed the verification process (KYC)? - Yes! I successfully passed verification, this BC does not notify players in any way about whether verification is needed or not, after I put the money to withdraw, and my request was canceled, I wrote to the chat support, and they answered what needs to be downloaded to chat documents to verify identity. I complied with the conditions, uploaded the documents, but they didn’t notify me of the results of the verification, they didn’t send letters, I generally doubt that they have any kind of additional service that deals with sending letters, etc. When several days passed, I wrote in the chat again, and they answered that I had verified my identity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After I passed the verification, I put two funds on the withdrawal of funds, 9,300 thousand rubles and 12,500 rubles.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>the first application was processed to me a few days later, but the second application for withdrawal has been processed since October.</p>
<p>I also have video recordings of a conversation with support in a chat that mockingly communicated, after a month has passed since the second application was processed, I wrote in a chat and asked: "Has a month passed, how much longer can I wait? Year?" To my question, the chat consultant replied that they have no deadlines for withdrawing funds! And to my question what will happen if half a year passes and they will not process my request for a withdrawal, the consultant answered - you can only hope that this does not happen! Is a mockery!</p>
<p>AFTER I filed a complaint on the basics website, my withdrawal request, which was being processed for a month at that time, was canceled !! I don’t know if it is a coincidence or not! After I created the complaint, the conclusion was canceled. I wrote to the consultant, they told me that they would answer me by mail, but as I said above, they don’t receive any letters from them, they are scammers, because when I contact the chat, the consultant repeatedly says that they send applications for consideration to the service on my question security, but the security service, according to them, has not been answering their requests for more than a month to their requests !!</p>
<p>Also in this bk, there is no personal account and no other forms of communication other than chat - which sometimes does not work!</p>
<ol>
<li>What methods I replenished - through a kiwi wallet and also displayed on a kiwi.</li>
</ol>
<p>To all this, I am a streamer and I have video recordings of how they are doing and how the support service is chatting! This is a commonplace fraudulent institution.</p>
<p>For questions when the security service will contact me they also have no deadlines)) that is, they say they can contact me after 10 years)) and they can pay money the same way) That is, they also have no deadlines on payments !! they can pay money for a year, you know?) That's the thing.</p>
<p>I understand that if they didn’t withdraw money from October to December, the unfortunate twenty, but they withdraw the smaller part, and they don’t want to withdraw the rest, I was forced to do at least something so that other people wouldn’t get money because I did!</p>
<p>thanks</p>
