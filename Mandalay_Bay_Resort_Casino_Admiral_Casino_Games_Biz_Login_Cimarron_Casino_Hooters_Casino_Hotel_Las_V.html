<p>We've thoroughly reviewed NgageWin Casino and gave it a Low Safety Index. This means we don't consider this casino to be a good option for most players. In our review, we've considered the casino's player complaints, estimated revenues, license, games genuineness, customer support quality, fairness of terms and conditions, withdrawal and win limits, and other factors. NgageWin Casino is related to other online casinos listed below and its rating is also negatively influenced by them. So, if you were ever wondering whether this casino is safe and legit or a scam, read the full review below to learn more.</p>
<p>According to our research and estimates, NgageWin Casino is a smaller online casino revenue-wise. It's a part of a group of related casinos with a bit higher combined revenues, but we would still classify the group as only medium-sized. The revenue of a casino is an important factor, as bigger casinos shouldn't have any issues paying out big wins, while smaller casinos could potentially struggle if you manage to win really big.</p>
<p>We currently have 0 complaints directly about this casino in our database, as well as 5 complaints about other casinos related to it. Because of these complaints, we've given this casino 4,867 black points in total, out of which 4,867 come from related casinos. You can find more information about all of the complaints and black points in the 'Safety Index explained' part of this review.</p>
<p>Warning: NgageWin Casino has certain sections of Bonus Terms and Conditions that we consider to be unfair to the casino's players. These might cause you issues if you decide to take advantage of the casino's bonuses or promotions. Because of this, we advise you to look for a casino with fair rules or at least pay special attention to this casino's Terms and Conditions if you decide to play at it.</p>
<p>Warning: NgageWin Casino has a €10,000 weekly net win limit. This means that you can't win more than €10,000 in one week, with the "net win" being calculated as the difference between the sum of your wins and the money you've wagered. If you win more, you will not get the money exceeding the limit. We consider any win limit to be extremely unfair to players, which is why we penalize any casino that has implemented it, unless the win limit is enforced by third-party factors, such as local regulations.</p>
<p>Based on the information we've collected and assessed in our NgageWin Casino review, it has a Low Safety Index. We don't recommend playing at it and advise you to stay away from it.</p>
