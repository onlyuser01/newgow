    <h1>Dover Downs Hotel And Casino How To Win At The Casino Havasu Landing Casino Cashman Casino Facebook</h1>

<p>Hi, manlyman! Thank you for your reply to Chipstars thread. ðŸ™‚</p>
<p>Our poker is much older than casino and sportsbook, it exists almost 2 years. As passionate poker players, we love our poker. We tried a lot of things with poker, we made a lot of promotions, a lot of interesting tournaments, free money... But it's really hard to bring new players to poker. Some players come, see that there are not so many players in the room and just leave...</p>
<p>You know the situation - new people don't want to play because there are not many players - there are not many players because new people don't want to play if tables are not full... Tough situation. But, will not stop with the work on our poker, as I said, we love poker! We just changed the strategy a little bit. We added a new casino and sportsbook which brings us new players, and we make our token which also brings new people to the Chipstars brand. We hope that this will also bring poker to the next level with time. We need to make a strong brand, I think that's the only way to make a strong poker community, so this is our strategy for Chipstars. We will first build the best possible casino (it's already ok, but we are working on it every day, basically 90% of our resources are on the casino now), then we need to make our token solid (we have big plans for it through gamification on casino and poker, NFT's...). After all of this is done, poker can grow in that community.</p>
