    <h1>Marquette Casino Hard Rock Casino Tulsa Ok The M Casino Hayward Wi Casino Casino Classic Jackpot Vil</h1>

<p>logged out of account after withdrawal of $5000 leaving cash balance of $45,035.85 , no bonus was used to acquire this amount. Upon trying to log back into account prompted that a time out had been placed so reached out to customer service (24/05/2022). Enquired why i have a time out placed on my account to which they stated i had placed it which i hadnt (did not want to get into argument over this as i have read feedback regarding chat closing accounts , chat rep stated i was on time out till 30/05/2022 , asked for confirmation that my funds would be safe and for confirmation on cash balance also for confirmation of next allowed withdrawal date as $5000 is the max withdrawal weekly (screen shots and chat transcripts added) i then emailed my VIP manager who stated that all given info was correct. Once time out had ended i logged back in to my account (31/05/2022) to find that i had a zero cash balance and a bonus of $1000 + which i never had before , the time out was placed, i checked account history which none was available , I then emailed my VIP agent who has told me i played the money on a book game (i have been locked out of my account and not played) he then went on to say that chat rep had given me incorrect information regarding my cash balance, he also gave times of when i supposedly had played my last funds etc , i have still not played a single game since time out has ended as i would like my funds issue resolved. Moving forward i have recontacted vip and told him that these times he has stipulated are not what is showing on the account history which is mysteriously available where i told him that these have now been manipulated twice as they keep changing. I have since not heard back but i have all chat history also verified cash balance as of the day after time out was placed. I feel like i am being just taken for a ride with no answers as to where my funds are. If there is an email i can send all correspondence to could you please let me send it there as alot of the documents have my address and full details etc on them.</p>
