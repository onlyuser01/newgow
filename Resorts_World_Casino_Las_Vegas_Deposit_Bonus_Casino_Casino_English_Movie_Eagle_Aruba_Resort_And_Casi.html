<p>Betway is going to continue to sponsor the Croky Cup knockout soccer tournament hosted in Belgium as part of an extension deal negotiated with the event. As a result, Betway’s signage and branding will continue to appear across LED screens at stadiums hosting the matches from Round 32 through the final game, even though live crowds have been a rare sight if any at all.</p>
<p>Betway will naturally have access to various IP assets, allowing the company to position its own brand using Croky Cup assets. The Crocky Cup is in fact one of the longest-standing partnerships that Betway has in place, making it an important collaborator.</p>
<p>Pro League CBO Leander Monbaliu welcomed the partnership extension, arguing it constitutes a success story for one of the best soccer events out there. “Heroic underdogs” and “unexpected defeats” mark the entire tournament and Betway is a welcomed partner on that journey.</p>
<p>Lack of Live Audiences Doesn’t Halt Betway’s Progress</p>
<p>The alliance was struck back in 2016 and it has allowed Betway to position itself on the Belgium market, garnering access to numerous broadcasts in the country. Commenting on this partnership Betway CEO Anthony Werkman said:</p>
<p>“The Pro League has been a fantastic partner of ours for five years and we’re delighted to extend our partnership of the Croky Cup.” Betway CEO Anthony Werkman</p>
<p>Werkman praised the status of the Croky Cup and argued that it was an important competition in Belgian soccer. Even though live audiences were not admitted during the event’s last two finals, Werkman is confident that the 2021/2022 season may be a different game altogether.</p>
<p>Betway has been all over the place signing a series of high-profile partnerships, including one with the Miami Heat, an NBA franchise. The company signed a partnership for the Stockholm Open which will be taking place on November 7.</p>
<p>Betway is also heavily represented in the competitive video gaming space with the company hosting a series of esports tournaments. The company’s footprint continues to grow at a rapid clip across the globe, with more market access partnerships in the United States and Latin America.</p>
