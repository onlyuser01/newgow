    <h1>Dakota Sioux Casino Hotel Casinos Near Oklahoma City Mark Twain Casino Hallmark Casino Login Casino</h1>

<p>I registered and made a deposit of 200€ to get their welcome offer of 100% up to 500€. The bonus did not get activated. I asked about it in the live chat, and was told that I will not be given any bonuses due to an administrative decision, and no more information is available. I tried to withdraw, but the site blocks the withdrawal due to 1x wagering requirement for deposits. I went to the live chat again and asked to get the wagering requirement removed, since I did not get the bonus that was promised and that was the reason for my deposit. Support refused to acknowledge the request seriously and quit the chat on me.</p>
<p>I realise that 1x wagering requirement is not the end of the world in this situation, but it’s a matter of principle and also of a little money. These sites can’t just lure you to deposit with false promises, then force you to play -EV games before you can get back whatever’s left of the money.</p>
