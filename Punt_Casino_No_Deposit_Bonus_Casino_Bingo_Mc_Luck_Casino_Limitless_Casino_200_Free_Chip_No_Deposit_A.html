    <h1>Punt Casino No Deposit Bonus Casino Bingo Mc Luck Casino Limitless Casino 200 Free Chip No Deposit A</h1>

<p>Hello All,</p>
<p>Please be aware that we have researched the matter and would like to highlight a few details.</p>
<p>The withdrawal in question was made on the 31st of December, 2021.</p>
<p>The source of the winnings includes:</p>
<p>Deposit reference ID 1818072 of 100 EUR</p>
<p>Deposit bonus reference ID 1818073 of 200 EUR</p>
<p>Free bonus reference ID 1825890 of 5 EUR, claimed on the 22nd of December 2021</p>
<p>Please be advised that Daniela’s withdrawal was voided due to breaching the maximum betting rules and as well as for playing with bonus funds on the unpermitted game.</p>
<p>Please see the mentioned T&amp;C:</p>
<p>"9. Betting rules</p>
<p>9.1. Winnings and Betting Rules</p>
<p>9.1.2.2. Bonus Betting Rules: Placing wagers that are 30% or more then the value of the bonus (the smallest one among them) currently in play within the bonus wagering requirements are fulfilled.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>9.3. Wagering Requirements</p>
<p>9.3.3 . Each bonus is restricted from being used on Table and/or other games. The player can only use bonus funds to play Slots or Scratch Games."</p>
<p>In this scenario, the player has made 7 bets on the non-slot game "Magic Wheel."</p>
<p>The aforementioned game is not permitted in the Bonus games category of the website.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Daniela has made 2 over-bets between 5 Euros and 7.75 Euros on the game "Santa´s Kiss" and "Super Zodiac Bingo"- this is another reason why her winnings have been voided.</p>
<p>Please be advised that we view this acts as a violation of the service we provide, and an attempt to deal unfairly with us. If a player attempts that, confiscation of the winnings accrued is in order.</p>
<p>The Casino understands your frustration, but it is imperative that all players comply with the terms and conditions that a player agrees to upon opening an account.</p>
<p>We'd like to underline that the non-lost deposit has been returned to the player's account.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>RoyalSpinz Casino</p>
