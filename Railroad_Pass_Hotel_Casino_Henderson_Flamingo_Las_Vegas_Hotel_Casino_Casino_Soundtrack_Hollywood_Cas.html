<p>Hello, i have made 30$ deposit, and got around 45$ bonus, then i got lucky and completed bonus wagering requrements. I made 3000$ withdrawal request, completed all verification steps. And now i found this messsage in my email:</p>
<p>Hello there,</p>
<p>Upon a thorough examination, it has come to our attention that your account has been locked due to violations of our terms and conditions, specifically the misuse of the welcome offer through strategies designed to gain an unfair advantage.</p>
<p>In accordance with section 11.1 of our terms of service, which can be referred to here, we are compelled to enforce immediate confiscation of any associated winnings and the closure of your account. An example of advantage play includes actions such as delaying game rounds, including free spins and bonus features, or making new deposits while still having such features available, allowing for an undue advantage.</p>
<p>Furthermore, section 12.1 outlines our strict anti-fraud policy, which includes various measures to detect and prevent fraudulent actions. Given the suspected fraudulent activities related to collusion, development of strategies for unfair winnings, and other types of cheating, we are left with no alternative but to lock your account permanently, as stipulated in section 12.3.</p>
<p>To facilitate the closure process, we kindly ask you to initiate a withdrawal of your initial deposit amount. Upon the completion of the withdrawal process, your account will be permanently closed.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>The Wild.io Team</p>

<p>I have not used any forbidden strategies or games. You can ask casino for list of my bets and look at it.</p>
