    <h1>Hotels Near Hollywood Casino Amphitheatre St Louis Casinos In Mississipi Cherokee Casino Grove Ameri</h1>

<p>This weekend, the PGA Tour travels to the Renaissance Club, a golf course some 20 miles away from Edinburgh, the capital of Scotland. That’s where the 2022 Scottish Open will tee off on Thursday, July 7, when a number of elite golfers will start their battle for their share of the $8 million prize pool.</p>
<p>Among those are Scottie Scheffler and Jon Rahm, who are seen as the top two favorites. Even though they’re leading the way, their odds come in the form of a four-digit number, meaning that bookies think anything could happen this coming weekend.</p>

<p>Scottie Scheffler and Jon Rahm Seen as Top Favorites</p>
<p>You can think of the 2022 Scottish Open as a general rehearsal for the Open Championship a.k.a. British Open. This explains why a number of players from near the top of the Golf World Rankings have decided to come to Scotland this weekend. Another reason for this is that the Scottish Open is one of the most prestigious golf tournaments on the other side of the Atlantic.</p>
<p>That said, you can expect top golfers to give their utmost in Scotland. This includes both Scottie Scheffler and Jon Rahm, who are co-favorites, both priced at +1200.</p>
<p>Scottie Scheffler is currently the no.1-ranked player, while Jon Rahm is coming to Scotland as the no.3 best player in the world. He dropped from second place last week, meaning that he’s probably very motivated to get back there.</p>
<p>2022 Scottish Open Contenders, Sleepers, and Longshots</p>
<p>In addition to the two main favorites, there are only two other players with betting odds shorter than +2000. The men in question are Justin Thomas and Matthew Fitzpatrick.</p>
<p>Thomas is one of the best golfers of his generation, who’s currently sitting in the #5 position in the rankings. That said, it’s no surprise he’s seen as one of the Scottish Open contenders. When it comes to Fitzpatrick, the English golfer is 10th at the moment, but he’s got some good memories at the Renaissance Club. Last year, he was the runner-up, together with Thomas Detry.</p>
<p>Speaking of Detry, the Belgian player is a +10,000 underdog, but we could see him finish in the Top 10. The same goes for the winner of the previous edition of the Scottish Open, Min Woo Lee.</p>
<p>2022 Scottish Open Predictions</p>
<p>With such a strong entry list, anything can happen at the 2022 Scottish Open. Scheffler and Rahm are favored for a reason, but we feel as if we could see a surprise happen at the Renaissance Club.</p>
<p>Matt Fitzpatrick looks like the man who could upset the odds this weekend. The winner of the 2022 US Open has been in fantastic form this season, not to mention that he loves playing in Scotland.</p>
<p>Pick: Matt Fitzpatrick</p>
