    <h1>Blaze Casino Scam Montana Casinos Coolcats Casino Hard Rock Hotel Casino Moonspin Casino NHL Extends</h1>

<p>The National Hockey League (NHL) announced on Thursday that it extended its partnership with BetMGM and MGM Resorts International.</p>
<p>MGM Resorts, BetMGM Extend Collaboration with NHL</p>
<p>It was back in 2018 when MGM Resorts inked an agreement with the NHL. This marked NHL’s first official sports betting partnership. Now, the leading sports betting and digital gaming operator BetMGM and MGM Resorts International announced “a multi-year extension” of their collaboration with the NHL.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the extended partnership, BetMGM and MGM Resorts can continue using NHL brands to create engaging experiences for their customers and guests. Moreover, the deal designates the duo as an official sports betting partner of the NHL. MGM Resorts, as well as BetMGM, will continue to benefit from on-site activation opportunities, camera-visible signage and integration into NHL’s jewel events.</p>
<p>The announcement about the partnership extension comes at a time when MGM Resorts prepares to host Honda NHL All-Star Weekend. The festive activities will be hosted at T-Mobile Arena between February 4 and February 5. In fact, MGM Resorts currently operates T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas, but additional special events are planned throughout other MGM properties along the Las Vegas Strip.</p>
<p>It comes as no surprise that the NHL, MGM Resorts and BetMGM support responsible gambling. In fact, the trio supports the American Gaming Association’s responsible gambling campaign dubbed Have A Game Plan. Launched in 2019, the initiative raises awareness and promotes responsible betting.</p>
<p>The Extended Partnership Will Bring Benefits</p>
<p>Adam Greenblatt, BetMGM’s CEO, outlined that the partnership enables BetMGM to deliver a wide variety of NHL betting options via the best-in-class hockey product. In conclusion, he said that BetMGM will continue its expansion into new markets while collaborating with the League and engaging with new fans.</p>
