<p>Arsenal vs. Manchester City is the most interesting soccer duel of Sunday, October 8, not only in the 2023-24 Premier League but in the entire world</p>
<p>Arsenal vs. Manchester City is a duel between the teams that finished in the top two spots in the Premier League last season. These two are also seen as the main favorites for the 2023-24 EPL title. Knowing all this, it’s only natural to assume their clash on Sunday, October 8, is going to be a real barnburner.</p>

<p>Arsenal Looking for 1st EPL Win Over Man City at Emirates Since 2015</p>
<p>The Gunners have a very poor record against Manchester City, with all losses in their previous 12 duels in the Premier League. They play at home this Sunday, but that too hasn’t been much of an advantage for them. The thing is that they’re without a home win over Man City in the Premier League since 2015.</p>
<p>The last time these two met, however, Arsenal ended up on top. The game in question was the 2023 FA Community Shield Final, which the Gunners won by a penalty shootout after 1-1 in regulation. What’s interesting is that several of Arsenal’s key men were sidelined with injuries – Gabriel Jesus, Oleksandr Zinchenko, and so on.</p>
<p>They’re back now, and so is Gabriel Martinelli, who missed the last five games due to a muscle injury. He might not yet be 100% fit to start the game with Man City, but we’ll probably see him get on the pitch if his teammates need him. The bad news is that Bukayo Saka will probably miss Sunday’s game after picking up an injury during the 2-1 loss to Lens in the Champions League on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Manchester City Need to Bounce Back to the Winning Track</p>
<p>Manchester City is arguably the best team in the world, which is why it’s no surprise that they’re sitting at the very top of the Premier League table. What is surprising is that they’ve suffered one loss thus far, even though their schedule hasn’t been that tough.</p>
<p>The loss in question happened last week when we saw them lose 2-1 to Wolves. The result is that Pep Guardiola’s men are now just one point ahead of Arsenal and Tottenham, as well as two points ahead of Liverpool. What this means is that if they don’t win on Sunday, they could drop down a couple of spots.</p>
<p>What needs to worry them ahead of the October 8 duel is that their best midfielder Kevin De Bruyne is out with an injury. The good news, however, is that the Cityzens have plenty of suitable replacements.</p>
<p>Arsenal vs. Manchester City Prediction</p>
<p>This is going to be a real spectacle as Arsenal will almost certainly go all-in on Saturday. They want to finally beat Manchester City and they’ll do all they can to pull it off. Unfortunately for their fans, we don’t think that’s likely to succeed, but we do think they might win a point on October 8.</p>
<p>Pick: Arsenal and Manchester City to draw; over 3.5 goals</p>
