    <h1>Mohegan Sun Pocono Casino Miami Hard Rock Casino Turningstone Casino Casino El Paso Casino Arkansas</h1>

<p>Online casino operator RocketPlay has launched a new jackpot feature for sports fans, allowing them to win some exciting prizes. The so-called Sports Jackpots feature provides punters with a chance to win big by betting.</p>
<p>The new mechanic is fairly straightforward – when players wager, they become eligible to win one of three jackpots, depending on the size of their bet. Each sports bet placed by a player contributes to the prize pool across all levels, resulting in potentially huge prizes.</p>
<p>The Sports Jackpots are divided into three categories: Bronze, Silver and Gold. Betting five or more Euros on sports makes players eligible to win the Bronze jackpot. Wagering 30 Euro or more, on the other hand, makes players eligible to win either the Bronze or Silver jackpot. Finally, those who bet more than 50 Euros are eligible to win any of the three jackpots.</p>
<p>Players Automatically Participate by Betting</p>
<p>The best thing about the new feature is that participation is not tied to any additional wagers and requirements. The only thing players need to do to enter the race to one of the jackpots is wager on RocketPlay’s platform. Each bet over 5 Euro will automatically see players enter the jackpot draw.</p>
<p>RocketPlay’s new feature is dynamic and evolves based on the total wagers. The more players participate, the higher their chances of claiming the Gold jackpot.</p>
<p>RocketPlay also confirmed that winners are selected at random, increasing the suspense of participating in the jackpot race.</p>
<p>RocketPlay is a popular online casino operator that seeks to deliver exciting gaming and betting experiences to its customers. What makes its products so attractive are its multiple promotions and engagement features, such as multiplier races and progressive quests.</p>
<p>The iGaming powerhouse boasts favorable ratings on review sites such as AskGamblers. It also has certificates of trust from Casino.guru and Chipy.com.</p>
<p>RocketPlay Signed a Deal with SOFTSWISS</p>
<p>In March, RocketPlay signed a partnership agreement with SOFTSWISS. The latter company leveraged its Jackpot Aggregator to improve the operator’s competitiveness and channel more players toward its platform.</p>
<p>As a Jackpot Aggregator client, RocketPlay secured access to SOFTSWISS’ custom virtual jackpot system that can be easily integrated with any existing project, whether it is a game provider, a game aggregator, or an online casino. The aim of the deal was to help the operator achieve its desired customer retention goals, inspiring brand loyalty among its users.</p>
