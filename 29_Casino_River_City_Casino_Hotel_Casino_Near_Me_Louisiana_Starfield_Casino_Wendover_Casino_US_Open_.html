<p>US Open Odds: Dustin Johnson Strong Favorite After Dominating St. Jude Win</p>

<p>The US Open odds are shortening on Dustin Johnson after the game’s top-ranked golfer won the St. Jude Classic in dominating fashion.</p>

<p>DJ shot rounds of 67-63-65-66 (-19) to win by six shots over runner-up Andrew Putnam and ten shots clear of third-place finisher JB Holmes. Johnson ended the week with 21 birdies, two eagles, and 44 pars to just four bogeys and one double.</p>
<p>Johnson capped off the tournament by dunking his second shot on the par-4 18th for an eagle two.</p>
<p>“By the reaction from the crowd, I thought it might have gone in, but I couldn’t see it so it,” Johnson esaid. “What a cool way to end.”</p>
<p>And what a cool way to head to Shinnecock Hills Golf Club for the 118th US Open. Now once again ranked the No. 1 golfer on planet Earth, Johnson is the strong favorite as the world’s best golfers head to Long Island for the second major of the year.</p>
<p>The Westgate SuperBook has Johnson at 8/1. A $100 bet and DJ winning his second major — and second US Open — nets $800. Though there’s 156 players teeing off Thursday, the 8/1 line implies a winning chance of 11.11 percent.</p>
<p>“Playing the way I did all week gives me a lot of confidence. I think it was a big win. It was a big statement,” Johnson concluded.</p>
<p>DJ will play the first two rounds with 14-time major winner Tiger Woods and 2017 PGA champ Justin Thomas.</p>
<p>Wide Open Field, Fairways</p>
<p>The last time Shinnecock hosted the US Open was a disaster. The greens became so hard that just two players finished under par for the week, and criticism was widespread regarding the United States Golf Association’s (USGA) course setup.</p>
<p>Shinnecock has since undergone major renovations, and the USGA says this week the average fairway width will measure 41 yards. With wider fairways and a longer course (7,445 yards, par 70), odds understandably favor long hitters like Johnson.</p>
<p>Johnson averages 311 yards per drive, the 10th-longest on Tour. Bubba Watson, another long hitter, is seventh at nearly 313 yards.</p>
<p>“I will say this with confidence. Long hitters will have the advantage and one of them will hoist the trophy,” Watson’s caddie Ted Scott tweeted this week.</p>
<p>Bubba hasn’t traditionally played well at the US Open. That’s why despite a T5 finish at the Masters and two wins on Tour this year, he enters this week long at 50/1.</p>
<p>Rory McIlroy and Justin Thomas can also pummel the ball, respectively ranked third and eighth in driving distance. They share the second-shortest US Open odds with Justin Rose and Rickie Fowler at 14/1.</p>
<p>Woods Remains a Favorite</p>
<p>It’s been a decade since Tiger Woods won his last major, the 2008 US Open at Southern Hills.</p>
<p>Woods hasn’t made a cut in a US Open since 2013, but that of course isn’t keeping bettors away. Tiger has the eighth-shortest odds at 20/1, a line he shares with Jon Rahm.</p>
<p>Longtime rival Phil Mickelson only needs the US Open to cap off the career grand slam. Lefty’s at 25/1.</p>
<p>2017 US Open winner Brooks Koepka recently returned after being confined to outside the ropes due to a torn tendon in his left wrist. The long-hitting 28-year-old is at 25/1 for this week.</p>
