    <h1>Coney Island Casino Casino Game Table M Resort And Casino Morongo Casino Hotel Fantasy Spring Casino</h1>

<p>Dear Aaron,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem.</p>
<p>I have checked the general bonus terms and conditions, and this is what I found (here):</p>
<p>„The Casino will occasionally offer Promotional Coupons as Free Chips. The maximum withdrawal amount for any free chip given is $100. For example if you are given a $100 free chip and request a withdrawal amount of $500, you will only be approved for $100.</p>
<p>Unless otherwise stated, the max cash-out for all no-deposit bonuses can’t surpass 1 times the sum value of the bonus redeemed. All free chips valued at or below $100 will have a cash-out limitation of no longer than, nor less than, $100.</p>
<p>Welcome courtesy bonuses have a maximum withdrawal amount of $100.00 for all NEW players."</p>
<p>Do I understand correctly that your winnings have been accumulated solely from a Free/No Deposit bonus? Have you received your winnings of $100?</p>
<p>I would like to emphasize, that according to our Fair Gambling Codex https://casino.guru/fair-gambling-codex-for-casinos#win-limits, we consider imposed win limit to be unfair and predator, only when it’s applied to a real money game, however, we accept bonus T&amp;Cs that restrict the maximum cash out from a bonus play, especially when it comes to No Deposit bonuses.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
