<p>Dear Mitzi,</p>
<p>I am trying to convince our withdrawal team to deduct whatever the</p>
<p>deposits refunded from your withdrawal amount and pay the rest.</p>
<p>I tried to reach you over the phone however was was not able to.</p>
<p>I am still waiting for their reply. Hopefully you would hear the good</p>
<p>news very soon. Please try to make a minimum deposit with us and try your luck so as to</p>
<p>make my case stronger. I hope you understand.</p>
<p>Thanks &amp; Regards,</p>
<p>Peter ****</p>

<p>Dear Mitzi,</p>
<p>I understand this must be not be a good feeling for you. It is very unfortunate that we are discussing such a matter with you instead of releasing your withdrawal right away. I am very sorry to tell you that the refunded deposits can not be with held from the winnings. I would have loved to do it for you if that was possible. You are requested to make a deposit in order to settle the refunds made against the two deposits. Please feel free to revert for any clarification.</p>
<p>Thanks &amp; regards,</p>

<p>It would be SO MUCH easier if the funds you say I owe were just withheld from my withdrawal request. This is ridiculous and I am SO disappointed.</p>

<p>Dear Mitzi,</p>
<p>We received chargebacks notification(dated 19th Sept 2022) from your bank on the following two deposit transactions. 1) $50 deposit done on 2nd Aug 2022 at 23:30 EST 2) $40 deposit done on 3rd Aug 2022 at 00:13 EST The withdrawal team has put your current withdrawal request on hold. As per policy there should not be any unsettled chargebacks showing in the account before the withdrawal could e processed. There is no restriction on your card deposit as of now. Please make a deposit of a total of $150 in order to settle the two chargebacks. This includes $50 deposit + $40 deposit + $60 fees that was incurred to us. Once you make a successful deposit of $150 we need to remove the amount immediately from the account. This would settle the chargebacks. I will get your withdrawal released as soon as possible thereafter. I am available 1:00 PM EST to 10:00 PM EST. Please feel free to call 188<strong>*</strong>99 to get connected to me for any queries. Please do not worry. We, together, will get this sorted. Everything would be smooth.</p>
<p>Thanks &amp; Regards,</p>

<p>Peter....I need to know what is going on with my withdrawal request. I was told in Chat that there was a $90.00 charge back in September of last year, which I was totally unaware of. I would have NEVER done</p>
<p>that. I play to much and like playing in Hallmark. I was supposed to have gotten calls (2 times) and never heard back. There was one voice mail I didn't know who it was because I couldn't understand whoever it was.</p>
<p>I have requested that if there is in fact a $90.00 chargeback that it be withheld from my Withdrawal funds on my request. I was ready to pay with my card but was told they could not accept it with the chargeback. This has gotten out of hand and needs to be resolved. I would appreciate a quick resolution and continue with my withdrawal request.</p>
