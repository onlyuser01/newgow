<p>Jerome Bettis Joins BetRivers</p>
<p>Rush Street Interactive’s BetRivers Sportsbook &amp; Casino has announced that NFL legend Jerome Bettis has joined the company’s Bet With A Winner campaign.</p>
<p>Bettis is one of the greatest power running backs in NFL history. Commonly referred to as “the Bus” for his signature running style, Bettis has had a long and illustrious career. A six-time Pro Bowler and two-time first team All-Pro, Bettis is also eighth in the NFL’s list of rushing yards leaders. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2015.</p>
<p>Needless to say, Bettis is a household name that is still recognized today, 14 years after his retirement in 2006. As brand ambassador and spokesperson for BetRivers, Bettis will be actively engaged with the company’s upcoming promotions and events.</p>
<p>Not only that, Bettis will also engage and interact with BetRivers users across multiple social media platforms as well as digital and traditional media platforms. Given his reputation and career accomplishments, users are also sure to get some interesting insights into pro football.</p>
<p>RSI President Richard Schwartz has lauded Bettis and his accomplishments and emphasized that Bettis has made a positive impact both on and off the field. Continuing, Mr. Swartz said that the company was beyond thrilled for Bettis to bring his authenticity and winning ways to BetRivers.</p>
<p>An Iconic Career</p>
<p>Bettis was born February 16, 1972 in Detroit and began making a name for himself in the football scene in high school. He attended Mackenzie High School and earned recognition as a standout running back and linebacker. The Detroit Free Press rated him the top player in the state before he even graduated.</p>
<p>While already impressive, Bettis achieved his true potential while at the University of Notre Dame. He finished his college career with 337 rushing attempts for 1,912 yards. In his sophomore year, he set the Notre Dame touchdown record with a whopping 20 in only one season.</p>
<p>Bettis was eventually drafted by the Los Angeles Rams in 1993, the same year he was named Offensive Rookie of the Year by the NFL. In 1996, he joined the Pittsburgh Steelers and was named NFL Comeback Player of the Year.</p>
<p>During his NFL career, Bettis proved himself time and again as a competent and powerful player. His arguably most iconic moment came in 2006 when he delivered a rousing speech to his teammates the day before they were to face off against the Denver Broncos in the AFC Championship game.</p>
<p>The Steelers won 34-17 and advanced to Super Bowl XL. Bettis retired the same year, ending his career with a bang.</p>
