<p>Nuvei Corporation, a global payment tech company, has expanded its deal with Eyas Gaming, a new operator owned by gambling industry veterans. As per the agreement, Nuvei agreed to supply more of Eyas Gaming’s brands with its acclaimed payment solutions.</p>
<p>Eyas’ Brands to Adopt Nuvei’s Solutions</p>
<p>Following the extension of the deal, Eyas Gaming has secured access to Nuvei’s cashier solutions. Therefore, the provider will continue powering Merkur Slots and Merkur Casino, two of Eyas’ brands, with its acclaimed payment methods.</p>
<p>As a result, Eyas’ user base will be able to pay their deposits digitally, instead of using cash. This also applies to withdrawals, allowing players to transfer their money back into their banks, cards or digital wallets.</p>
<p>Moreover, the operator will now be able to allow its players to bill deposits on their mobiles. The latter solution is powered by Fonix, a direct carrier billing provider which recently teamed up with Nuvei.</p>
<p>Eyas first teamed up with Nuvei in October 2021. Since then, the payment solutions provider has been providing the operator’s brands with cashless payment methods. The partnership extension attests to the quality of Nuvei’s products and Eyas’ satisfaction with them.</p>
<p>Nuvei Is Happy to Work with Eyas Gaming</p>
<p>Andrejs Cuzans, head of fraud, risk and payments at Eyas Gaming, spoke about the partnership. He said that his team is looking forward to implementing Nuvei’s state-of-the-art solutions to all brands across Eyas’ portfolio.</p>
<p>Cuzans lauded Nuvei’s “rich global heritage” and praised its knowledge of the gaming industry as a whole. He also commended the provider’s supreme alternative payment methods that can be easily integrated into an operator’s platform. The combination of all these things made it easy for Eyas to pick Nuvei as its payment solutions partner.</p>
<p>Philip Fayer, chairman and chief executive of Nuvei, also commented on the extended deal. He felt honored by Eyas’ trust and said that this demonstrates why Nuvei is a leader for iGaming payments.</p>
<p>We’re looking forward to continuing to support Eyas Gaming and its growth into new markets in the coming years. Philip Fayer, CEO, Nuvei</p>
<p>Lastly, Rob Weisz, chief executive of Fonix, the brand supplying Nuvei with mobile payment solutions, shared his thoughts. He emphasized that Fonix’s focus is to use its carrier billing tech to make conversion and expansion easier for its partners.</p>
<p>Integrating Fonix’s carrier billing solution means Nuvei can allow Eyas Gaming to turn on carrier billing with the flick of a switch. Rob Weisz, CEO, Fonix</p>
<p>A week ago Nuvei also extended its partnership with GoldBet’s Italian arm, expanding its presence in the country.</p>
