    <h1>Casino Temecula Chumba Casino Com Casino Lake Charles La Casino Game Bally Casino 888poker to Award</h1>

<p>Online poker leader 888 has announced $1 million in various giveaways between now and January 10, 2021 to celebrate the upgraded mobile and desktop look of its poker client.</p>
<p>888poker Rolls out $1M in Rewards over Next Two Months</p>
<p>After a short teaser last week, 888poker is finally celebrating the release of its overhauled mobile app with a brand-new look and $1 million in prizes up for grabs. After rolling out the app late in October, the company is finally bringing out some rewards to properly celebrate the launch.</p>
<p>Under the new slogan, “Made to Play”, 888poker will seek to giveaway $1 million in various prize money from now all through January 10, 2021.The load out methods will include happy hours, special gift shops, and naturally freerolls. Not all prizes will be distributed all at once, though, and there will be caps on how much money can go to the community weekly.</p>
<p>Over $30,000 in Freerolls Every Week</p>
<p>All players who have deposited and bet at least $1 will be eligible for the $30,000 weekly rewards.</p>
<p>There are several different types of promotions you may win as part of the freerolls, including cash, BLAST tickets, or bonuses for various online casino games and 888’s sportsbook, which are two alternative aspects of the poker gaming experience.</p>
<p>Players are encouraged to check the lobby frequently lest they miss out on some special treat that is part of the $1 million giveaway in the coming months.</p>
<p>888poker Introduces Daily Happy Hours</p>
<p>888poker has come up with multiple ways to distribute prizes, including the special Happy Hours which award all sorts of treats, including the coveted BLAST tournament tickets as well as 100% rakeback as part of satellite events, and 50% rakeback as part of Snap events.</p>
<p>Snap is 888poker’s equivalent to a fast-fold poker, allowing you to play through more hands in a single sitting. All events tend to have a date set up, to the following schedule:</p>
<p>Blast Boost (up to 1 Blast ticket per hour) – Monday &amp; Wednesday – 16:00 – 18:00</p>
<p>(up to 1 Blast ticket per hour) – Monday &amp; Wednesday – 16:00 – 18:00 Snap Back (up to 50% rakeback for Snap) – Tuesday &amp; Thursday – 16:00 – 18:00</p>
<p>(up to 50% rakeback for Snap) – Tuesday &amp; Thursday – 16:00 – 18:00 Satellite Specials (up to 100% rakeback on all satellites) – Friday, Saturday &amp; Sunday – 14:00 – 17:00</p>
<p>Join the Random Gift Prizes</p>
<p>To make things better, 888poker is distributing prizes around the clock. These rewards will be distributed via the Gif Drops initiative with some of the prizes reaching up to $1,000. Better yet, they are available every 5 minutes as part of the gaming experience with 888poker.</p>
<p>There are no fixed stakes you should join to get the drops, as 888poker will tailor the awards so long as you are participating in Snap, Blast, MTTs or cash games. To make things better, 888poker is inviting players to join the Winner Spinner, where everyone gets a chance to win a random award from the Winner Spinner Prize Wheel.</p>
<p>Players can get up to two free spins every day if they use the overhauled mobile app released by the website.</p>
<p>In the meantime, 888poker has spared no effort in innovating the overall look and feel of its website, investing in both the desktop and mobile lobby and user interface.</p>
<p>All of this comes amid news that former The Stars Group Senior Vice President of Communications Lewis Vaughan is stepping up as Chief Strategy Officer (CSO) at 888.</p>
