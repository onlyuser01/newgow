<p>Playtech has agreed to power the BetParx iGaming and sports betting platform in New Jersey and Pennsylvania as the company has relaunched its offer in both states to correspond to the latest industry standards.</p>
<p>BetParx Gets a Facelift, Launches Again in NJ &amp; PA</p>
<p>Owned by Greenwood Gaming &amp; Entertainment, BetParx is expanding fast across the iGaming and interactive wagering sector and will now entrust Playtech with updating the technological stack of the app, which is bringing both the casino and sports product under the same roof.</p>
<p>This will be achieved through the Information Management Solution by Playtech which gives the operator full control over key metrics, including player lifecycle, needs, and expectations. Thanks to the solution, BetParx will be able to better adjust its offers and cater to player preferences.</p>
<p>Playtech CEO Mor Weizer welcomed the opportunity to be teaming up with the company and bring its product fully online in New Jersey and Pennsylvania through BetParx. The app is expected to make its way in other markets, too. Weizer said:</p>
<p>“Playtech’s software and expertise provide a high-quality customer experience, and this is exactly what the highly sophisticated consumer market in the US requires.” Playtech CEO Mor Weizer</p>
<p>Weizer added that Playtech was keen on building up its own footprint in the United States through key gambling and sports betting jurisdictions and the tie-up with BetParx was a step in this direction.</p>
<p>The relaunched app also features a number of Playtech’s own casino games and original productions which should give BetParx an elevated status in the highly-contested iGaming market.</p>
<p>Playtech Hopes to Secure Further Positions in the USA</p>
<p>This optimism for the future was shared by BetParx SVP of iGaming and sports Matthew Cullen, who was proud to see the app relaunch:</p>
<p>“We are incredibly proud to be launching BetParx in conjunction with an industry-leading technology provider in Playtech. We’ve made the sign-up, deposit, and cash-out processes as simple and smooth as anything in the industry.” BetParx SVP of iGaming and sports Matthew Cullen</p>
<p>Cullen is confident that the BetParx product is capable of creating a great user experience for fans who enjoy either sports or casino gaming, or both. BetParx is now available for download in both jurisdictions and Pennsylvania has supplier licenses in both states and Michigan.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Playtech gained exclusive rights to The Million Dollar Drop and has retained its rights for Deal or No Deal Bingo. The company has been gradually building up its footprint in the region.</p>
