    <h1>Barona Casino Suquamish Clearwater Casino Fremont Hotel Casino Fremont Street Las Vegas Nv Vegas Wor</h1>

<p>Hello everyone looks like I’m sharing the same type of disgust and distress that everyone else is sharing. I want a small fortune on August 10 I requested a withdrawal. This is my first time trying to withdraw from Ruby slots. I was a new customer I won $940. I tried to request $940 on August 10 I kept contacting customer service going over and over and over and over again like what’s taking so long because it was just sitting there. I still didn’t receive no money finally I contacted them back right at the end of the month of August 31 then was told that they had just approved it and sent it out on August 31 so let’s jump forward Abney contact and ever since they sit out on August 31 they can give me the run around in the run around in the runaround saying just way it’s gonna be 7 to 10 business days one to five business days 3 to 6 business day they would just give me different answers. I’ve called my bank to see if they had a incoming pending international wire. They cannot see anything coming into my account. They said that maybe I should call back Ruby sluts and tell them to put a trace on the wire however, Ruby slots has totally ignored me asking for them to put a trace on the wire. I do believe that any time you said, any kind of money in the world today the way it is you were season sort of number confirmation number code to let you know that this money or this transaction has went through everything that you do on the Internet in the form of money has a confirmation number, so why is it that Ruby slots cannot and will not put a trace on my money it has been over a month that I have been waiting to receive under $1000. This is ridiculous and I and I definitely don’t want to down put more money on the casino in fear of maybe I may win again and and if I win again, I have to go through this process all over again I have been waiting over a month and still do not have my money and Customerservice will only talk to you over live chat and half of them don’t know what they’re talking about the other half give you the same runaround they keep Telling me reach out back to them in 24 hours 24 hours 24 hours and when I reach back out in 24 hours for update, they told me to reach back out again so I’m getting tired of going run around with this casino. I literally cashed out 10 times with 10 other casinos is the first time I requested this will draw with Ruby. This is not a good impression and once I receive my phones, I will be closing my account and I spend anymore money with this company. There’s no reason in the entire green land that it should take over a month to get a little bit of money that I want to All none there’s no reason at all so I am asking for casino guru help to be the arbitration mediator I need to know where my money is I just want my money I don’t want anything else does my money like and I also know that with the international wire transfer it is 100% possible that a wire can be made available to the recipient on the same day that it was it. It is like a instant payment. Thank of Zelle think of Cashout think of PayPal is instant. There’s no reason that I should be waiting this long for something that is insane and when you are something echoes from their Trent, their bank to my bank, there’s no stopping know nothing but they’re one representative her said that it’s probably going through several different channels in several different Hanz. Is there a different banks? Why is my money? Why isn’t my money is being handled by several different people that makes no sense why is he being handled by several different banks? That makes no sense when I requested a wire to my bank from their bank I honestly think that this is as bad as it gets when you have a customer that is scared to win at your casino because of the process of getting your money that you want is that my dear is a problem I am scared to win at Ruby slots Casino. Why am I scared? You may ask because this process that I’m in right now I have waited for over 30 days and still no payments. I have been waiting and waiting and calling and calling and talking and talking to everybody and no one can give me an answer. I need answers and I need my money. It’s my money and I want it now!!!</p>
