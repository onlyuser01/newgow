<p>A compact between the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians and North Carolina’s state brings sports betting at Harrah’s casinos closer to realization.</p>
<p>Tribal Compact Approval Means Sports Betting Is Coming to NC</p>
<p>North Carolina and the federal government have reached an agreement on a new gaming compact that negotiates the terms of a new gaming deal between the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, a federally-recognized tribe running gambling operations, and the state.</p>
<p>The measure was introduced on Tuesday, and it should pave the way for sports betting at Harrah’s properties in Cherokee and Murphy.</p>
<p>The compact was negotiated between Gov. Roy Cooper and the tribe and approved last December but had to wait until the Bureau of Indian Affairs had time to step in and undergo a 45-day public review prior to approving it yesterday.</p>
<p>North Carolina already has laws in place allowing the state to run sports betting operations, with a law passed back in July 2019 but suffering delays because of lack of clarity on the state’s tribal compact with the Cherokee Indians.</p>
<p>Approving the compact now means that North Carolina has already missed on Super Bowl, one of the biggest betting events in the state, but it could possibly scoop up some of the betting handle generated around March Madness.</p>
<p>Reaching Full Potential for Sports Betting Would Require Mobile</p>
<p>However, no clarity on the exact timeline has been yet revealed, meaning that sports betting may be late after all. The negotiation limits sport betting to tribal properties and in-person betting, meaning that North Carolina would not be able to benefit from any remote gambling opportunities just yet.</p>
<p>Failing to legalize mobile, though, maybe counter-intuitive as the activity has long been related to higher levels of engagement and better overall betting handle. Meanwhile, fears mobile gambling would lead to a higher incidence of gambling addiction have proven unsubstantiated.</p>
