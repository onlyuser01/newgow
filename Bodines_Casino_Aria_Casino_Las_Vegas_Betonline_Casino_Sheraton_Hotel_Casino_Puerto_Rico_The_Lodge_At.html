<p>The new long-term contract is a display that the partnership that brings gaming on board Color Line's ships is mutually beneficial</p>
<p>Online gambling firm operating out of Finland, Paf, announced it has renewed its arrangement with Norwegian cruise and ferry operator Color Line to continue providing onboard gaming equipment.</p>
<p>Gambling Equipment on Board</p>
<p>The new long-term contract between Paf and Color Line will ensure Paf continues to supply the gaming equipment on board all five passenger ships operated by Norwegian’s largest cruise and ferry company. Color Line operates five passenger ships on four different routes between Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Germany.</p>
<p>Commenting on the new contract, Paf chief executive officer Christer Fahlstedt hailed Color Line as a “well-run and great shipping company that has weathered the strong winds in the industry,” and despite the few challenging years for the collaboration due to the pandemic, he said that Paf is looking forward to continuing their journey together.</p>
<p>Paf and Color Line has been partnering for the past six years during which the gambling company has been providing the passenger ships’ onboard gaming equipment, including slot machines, entertainment games and table games, and the challenges in the past few years posed by the pandemic did not stop the partners from developing their collaboration.</p>
<p>Thomas Gudbjerg, executive vice president of Commercial &amp; Hotel Operation on board the Color Line ships expressed his and the company’s gratitude to Paf for being “a good partner that has contributed” a lot to the development of Color Line gaming operations.</p>
<p>Responsible Gaming as a Factor</p>
<p>“Together with Paf, we have succeeded in establishing a new level for gaming operations on board,” he continued, highlighting Paf’s strong stance on the subject of responsible gaming which is important to a cruise and ferry operator that is entirely oriented to ensure customer satisfaction for its passengers.</p>
<p>Recently, Paf made another significant step in strengthening its responsible gambling policy by introducing a lower gambling loss limit for people aged between 18 and 24 of €10,000 ($10,600) annually – half as much as its standard annual player loss limit.</p>
<p>To improve its product offering, Paf has been investing in the recent years in the development of entertainment games with the introduction of the new cashless Game Room concept, its slot machines have been constantly renewed and the range of games updated, and Paf chief operating officer, Lasse Danielsson, is adamant the investment will continue in the future.</p>
<p>Stating that Paf has managed to generate higher revenues during the pandemic than before, Danielsson outlined that, “in order to continue that development,” the firm would “invest in further improvements of the gaming experience” via new gaming machines and redesigned gaming areas.</p>
