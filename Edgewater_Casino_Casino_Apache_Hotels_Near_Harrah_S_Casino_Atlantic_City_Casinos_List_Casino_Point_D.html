<p>Bally’s Corporation announced that Marc Crisafulli, EVP of government relations, legal and regulatory, would retire from the company, effective September 16. During his work at the global casino giant, Crisafulli used his substantial experience to position the company for sustained growth. The operator lauded the former EVP’s contributions and wished him success in his next chapter.</p>
<p>Crisafulli Had a Long and Successful Career</p>
<p>Crisafulli started work at Twin River Worldwide Holdings in May 2019 as EVP of government relations, managing the company’s government and public affairs in the USA. During that period, he also served as President of Twin River and Tiverton Casinos before the company’s rebranding to Bally’s Corporation in 2020. In November that year, he stepped into his final role at the company.</p>
<p>Although Crisafulli’s three-year tenure at the company was short by corporate standards, he boosted Bally’s growth thanks to his vast legal experience. He graduated from Boston University with a Bachelor’s Degree in Economics and Political Science and later became a Doctor of Law at Georgetown University Law Center. His professional journey stretches over two-and-a-half decades and includes work in construction management, wireless distribution, gaming, and legal services. Crisafulli’s senior management position as a high-profile operator is a fitting capstone for his career.</p>
<p>Bally’s Used Crisafulli’s Talents to Secure Vital Partnerships</p>
<p>Bally’s Board of Directors chairman Soo Kim wished Crisafulli all the best in his next chapter and added that the team would strive to build on his achievements.</p>
<p>During his time, he developed important relationships and respect among regulators, partners, and colleagues. Soo Kim, chairman of Bally’s Corporation Board of Directors</p>
<p>Crisafulli’s most notable achievement is the successful three-way agreement with the State of Rhode Island and International Game Technology (IGT) to develop Rhode Island’s gaming revenue. The partnership matured into a piece of legislation bearing Crisafulli’s name, establishing a 20-year joint venture and giving Bally’s access to a $250 million economic development investment plan.</p>
<p>Lee Fenton, Bally’s CEO, thanked Crisafulli for his commitment and contributions to the company, wishing the former EVP the best in his retirement.</p>
<p>On behalf of our Board and management team, we want to thank Marc for his guidance and for his role in positioning us for our next phase of growth. Lee Fenton, CEO of Bally’s Corporation</p>
<p>The Former EVP Plans to Focus on His Family</p>
<p>Crisafulli expressed pride in Bally’s accomplishments and thanked the management team for the opportunity to make a difference, wishing the company enduring success.</p>
<p>It has been a privilege to see the company grow and evolve, and I want to thank… the entire team for their support, leadership, and friendship. Marc Crisafulli, outgoing EVP of government relations, legal and regulatory</p>
<p>In a Twitter post on his official account, Crisafulli clarified that surviving cancer had drastically shifted his perspectives. With a fruitful and varied career behind his back, he will use the extra time to focus on his family, travel, and help other people facing similar challenges.</p>
