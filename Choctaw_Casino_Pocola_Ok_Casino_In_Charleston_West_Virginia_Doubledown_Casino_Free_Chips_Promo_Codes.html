    <h1>Choctaw Casino Pocola Ok Casino In Charleston West Virginia Doubledown Casino Free Chips Promo Codes</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>So I apologize for the delay in my response for some reason up until this morning I was not receiving your emails notifying me that a response from you has been completed and waiting for my response. My account is all current and your emails are not going to my spam folder either so... yeah....??</p>
<p>But anyway I will attach a couple of screenshots and on them, you will notice 2 bonuses that I have no recollection of ever accepting. One of them being for .70 cents??? So that's a red flag to me right there. You will see in the beginning I did accept a bonus and completed said playthrough for said bonus. So those last two bonuses I have no idea what they are or where they came from because I never made a deposit for them nor did I accept them either. Also, let's pretend I did accept them I still should've received the 900 that they shorted me anyway because I would've completed whatever playthrough was required because when I did win I still played for a long time to ensure that I did make whatever playthrough requirements was needed I made sure that - that was what I did because I kept checking on that screen shown in the screenshots that I completed said playthrough.</p>
<p>I'm not new to how this system works. I know that when a bonus is accepted you usually always have a playthrough to meet before any cashout is allowed. I would not be going through all this trouble otherwise.</p>
<p>Bottom line I deposited, accepted a bonus, played, won a large amount of money, and then continued to play until I reached my playthrough requirements. How else would I have known when I could cash out if I wasn't paying attention to where I was at on the playthrough requirements?? I would've HAD to be looking at that info. Not to mention the fact that I would've noticed those weird last 2 bonuses before as well. Then I wouldn't be raising this argument to begin with.</p>
<p>They are playing some kind of shady game and it's BS! I did everything the right way and that's the bottom line.</p>
<p>I can also provide screenshots of the many pages of games I played that show just how much I played and each transaction for every spin that was made. It's going to be a ton of pages but I can provide those if needed. Please let me know.</p>
<p>Again I apologize for the delay in my response and I appreciate all your help in this matter.</p>
<p>~Steve</p>
