    <h1>Chicago Casino Mbit Casino Cherokee Casino Siloam Springs Tama Iowa Casino Live Casino Bonus PAGCOR</h1>

<p>Tengco noted that the PAGCOR will continue to work with various governments and law enforcement agencies to make sure it cracks down on illegal platforms.</p>
<p>The Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation (PAGCOR) has addressed a recent issue related to a problematic Philippine gambling website that appears on car license plates in Maryland.</p>
<p>The site in question is www.starsprangled200.org and was originally a site belonging to a non-profit organization that commemorated 200 years from the War of 1812. At that time, around 780,000 limited edition license plates were issued for the occasion, all featuring Star Spangled’s link.</p>
<p>Years later, people who tried to follow the link were surprised to find that it actually redirects them to www.globeinternational.info, an unlicensed Philippine online casino website. As it turns out, Star Spangled disbanded years ago and the domain was somehow acquired by the casino operator.</p>
<p>The situation meant hurdles for the Maryland Motor Vehicle Administration which may have to issue new plates or acquire the URL. However, both options are going to be costly.</p>
<p>However, the PAGCOR noted that Globe International isn’t licensed in the Philippines either. According to the authority, the website is not only an illegal gambling platform but one that portrays the Philippines in a bad light.</p>
<p>Tengco: PAGCOR Is Not Associated with Globe International</p>
<p>Alejandro Tengco, PAGCOR’s chair and chief executive, released a statement on the matter, emphasizing that the regulator is in no way related to Globe International.</p>
<p>As the country’s gaming regulator, PAGCOR does not condone illegal online gambling. Engaging or betting on illegal gambling activities is not only a criminal act; it also takes away from the government billions of pesos in revenues which can be used to fund priority programs that will benefit a greater number of Filipinos. Alejandro Tengco, chair &amp; CEO, PAGCOR</p>
<p>Tengco noted that the PAGCOR will continue to work with various governments and law enforcement agencies to make sure it cracks down on such illegal platforms. His goal is to cement Philippine gambling as a safe and reliable form of entertainment that is free of fraud. To that end, extra vigilance will be required.</p>
<p>Tengco added that the matter has been referred to the Philippine Security and Monitoring Cluster for investigation. At the same time, Globe International was referred to the appropriate government agency for immediate action.</p>
<p>The CEO addressed gambling players in the Philippines and beyond, urging them to forgo playing with unlicensed companies. He noted that players must be careful when engaging in gaming activities and try to avoid dangerous illegal websites.</p>
