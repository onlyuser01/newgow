<p>Information about Blueprint Gaming casinos</p>
<p>Blueprint Gaming is a multi-platform game provider that is part of German company Gauselmann Group. Known for creating slots games, they aim to provide exciting titles for the global online and mobile markets, despite being less prominent than other games providers.</p>
<p>Our database contains a number of casinos with slots from Blueprint Gaming. As such, it's good to know what to expect from the games before you deposit money, and also which casinos are the most reliable to play them on.</p>
<p>In this article, you'll find information about below.</p>
<p>Table of contents:</p>
<p>Blueprint Gaming: A reliable developer with an eye for collaboration</p>
<p>Formed in 2001, Blueprint Gaming started to gain traction in the digital gaming market over the following years and attracted the attention of Gauselmann group, which purchased 50% of their shares in 2008. The deal was clearly a success as the German company became the sole shareholder in 2012, with an eye toward expanding Blueprint's horizons.</p>
<p>Using their original London base as a headquarters, Blueprint soon opened up an office in Malta: and these two locations are complemented with licenses from the UK Gambling Commission and a recognition from the Malta Gaming Authority, both of which form the company's seal of authenticity.</p>
<p>At the same time, Blueprint were working hard to add to their growing collection of slot titles, developing a reputation for fun and diverse games.</p>
<p>Such a reputation has led to promising partnerships with the likes of iGamingPlatform and Paddy Power - the latter of which saw a player scoop a Â£4.3 million jackpot on Blueprint title Mars Attacks! - and casinos featuring Blueprint slots can now easily be found online.</p>
<p>Blueprint Slots: fun gameplay with an array of bonus features</p>
<p>Anyone with an eye for slots games will be looking to have fun first and foremost. The good news is that the people at Blueprint Gaming appear to know this, offering many entertaining titles that are designed to appeal to a broad range of people.</p>
<p>All the titles are translated to multiple languages, which broadens their appeal, and they are all HTML5-powered, so you can play them on mobile devices.</p>
<p>Within the selection you can find games with themes popular with comedy fans: Beavis and Butt-head, for example, offers the player a variety of game options on a TV, which they can select via Butt-head's remote control. Cool features, such as guitar twangs for a win, add to the fun.</p>
<p>History fans will also be pleased to see a Napoleon title on there, with its dramatic opening sequences and haunting music, as well as the glamour of the ancient world in Rome: Rise of the Empire.</p>
<p>A unifying theme across all games are bright colors and quirky designs that make the games easy to look at. The graphics aren't particularly special on some of the titles, with a flatter 2D background often the preferred choice, however, a lot of players won't mind with the amount of bonus features on offer, something that is a Blueprint trademark and a big part of the appeal of playing their games.</p>
<p>Rome: Rise of the Empire, for example, gives you the chance to win 1000x your total bet in its Big Money feature, while Ted has stages like Turbo Gamble and Crazy Cash that offer bigger prizes. Genie Jackpots also lets you rub the genie's lamp for a chance to strike gold and trigger a variety of bonus features.</p>
<p>Blueprint's official website doesn't give you the chance to try out these titles for free before playing, displaying short video previews or images instead, so feel welcome to play them on our list of free Blueprint slots. It's always good to test games before staking real money, after all.</p>
<p>How to choose the best Blueprint Casino for you</p>
<p>Once you're ready to play Blueprint games for real money, the next step is to find the best possible casino to play them in.</p>
<p>This page is designed to make that process easy for you, but for that to happen you need to know how to use our reviews and filters to your advantage.</p>
<p>Starting with our filter system, you'll notice a number of tabs at the top of the page, just below the title.</p>
<p>The 'Recommended' tab should be automatically selected as the default choice: this will give you the pick of the best Blueprint casinos according to our team of experts, who have rated and reviewed each option. All of these casinos will be available in your country.</p>
<p>You can alter this selection by choosing the 'Newly opened' tab, which offers a different perspective, displaying the newest casinos with Blueprint games. Alternatively, clicking on the 'All' tab will take you to the full list of casinos.</p>
<p>All of these options will be relevant for you as they're continuously updated by the Casino Guru team.</p>
