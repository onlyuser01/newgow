<p>Dear carsix79,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting this complaint. I'm sorry to hear about your negative experience with Flappy Casino. I have checked the Terms and Conditions, and this is what I found:</p>
<p>7.5. If a player closes his casino account due to "problems with gambling" / "loss of self-control over the game" / "gambling addiction", in this case, the player is prohibited from playing on the sites of the casino partners, which are indicated in the license of this casino.</p>
<p>The player undertakes not to open a new account. The casino is not responsible for opening by you a new account and any losses that you may incur after opening a new account. We reserve the right at any time to close an account that was created on violation of these rules.</p>
<p>7.6. In case of violation of the rules of the project, the casino administration can return the deposits to the player with the deduction of administrative commission up to 15%, depending on the player's payment method.</p>
<p>Could you please advise if you used the same identity information (email, name, address, phone number) for your registration in Flappy Casino as you used in Rollino?</p>
<p>Could you kindly specify which documents you sent for KYC verification? Do I understand correctly that you sent all the documents yesterday and they were also approved on the same day?</p>
<p>When was the last time you communicated with customer support and what was it about?</p>
<p>I hope we will be able to help you resolve this issue as soon as possible. Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards</p>
<p>Veronika</p>
