    <h1>Ocean Casino Resort Photos Chumba Casino App Download For Android Seven Feathers Casino Casino Terms</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>You deposited in the casino to find out that some games (surely casinos with greek language availability will provide some games for players from your country, and it is based on the game providers) are not available to you, right?</p>
<p>Then it seems you started the verification and are now struggling with a certain document.</p>
<p>Can you explain which document seems to be wrongly provided? I find it very interesting that the .pdf format is restricted, though. Normally, it's the only allowed format.</p>
<p>But I check the rules and you are supposed to upload screenshots, instead - check point 8 :</p>
<p>"11. KYC AND VERIFICATION:</p>
<p>Provide your KYC procedures</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>All Players should be over the legal age (18+)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>List of required documents in order for players to pass verification process:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Photo of an identity document</p>
<p>Photo or screenshot of the payment system</p>
<p>Photo or screenshot of a document confirming the current address of residence (not older than 3 months)</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In some cases we require additional proof - proof of funds (to make sure player uses his/her own money when gamble at our site)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The documents quoted hereinabove can be requested when player reaches certain sum of deposit/withdrawal and when we suspect player in fraudulent activity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We also check player's bets for possible violations. In case we are not sure about the legality of the winning credited we contact provider and check those bets with them</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To prevent the possible fake/untrustful usage of the ID verification process, we check documents for any signs of editing, if necessary request selfie with ID to make sure the document belongs to the exact person who registered on the website</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In case we have strong suspicions and unsure whether the document is valid or not we contact anti-fraud department via email</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The player should upload documents to the "Document verification" tab in his/her account</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Document verification criteria:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Photo of an identity document: all data (name, date of birth, citizenship) completely coincide with the data in Player’s details, the document is valid, with a photograph.</p>
<p>As a rule, a passport, ID, driver’s license is suitable for identification.</p>
<p>Photo or screenshot of the payment system: all data completely coincides with the data in Payment systems debts. Scanned copies are not accepted as confirmation</p>
<ol>
<li>Additional documents:</li>
</ol>
<p>Selfies with an identity document</p>
<p>Proof of wealth</p>
<p>Proof of funds</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A photo or a screenshot of a document confirming the current address of residence: the data (name, address of residence + date of issue of the document) coincides with the data in Player’s details. To confirm the address, a utility bill / bank statement / payment for mobile services is acceptable / photo of registration from the passport is acceptable for players from the CIS. The document must be no older than 90 days (3 months).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Selfies with an identity document: it is desirable that the player’s hands are visible, a thorough check for editing / photoshop. Optionally, a selfie can be requested with an identity document + a sheet of paper on which the name of the casino and the current date are written. In this case, it's preferable for the inscription to be on a sheet of squared paper rather than plain.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Proof of wealth: a document confirming the welfare of the player.</p>
<p>Proof of funds: a document confirming the receipt of funds to the payment system.</p>
<p>Let me know how it went, I'll try to help</p>
