<p>Parx Casino Shippensburg Receives Category 4 Gaming License in Pennsylvania</p>

<p>Parx Casino Shippensburg officially has a gaming license. The Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board (PGCB) voted unanimously yesterday to award Parx Casino a Category 4 gaming license for its reimagining of a former Lowe’s home improvement store into a casino.</p>

<p>Greenwood Gaming &amp; Entertainment, the parent company of Parx Casino in Bensalem, just north of Philadelphia, won a Category 4 auction round in 2018. Greenwood’s bid of $8,111,000 million for the permit was the high offer. Each satellite must be tethered to a larger Category 2 casino.</p>
<p>Greenwood selected Shippensburg Township for its so-called mini-casino. Shippensburg officials opted to stay in the Category 4 casino pool of possible host locations.</p>
<p>The former Lowe’s, where Parx Casino Shippensburg will transform the big box store into a boutique casino space, is located at 250 Conestoga Drive. Greenwood plans to invest $65 million to transform the retail center into a casino facility.</p>
<p>The board’s approval of the license comes after much opposition presented from the local Shippensburg community regarding the casino proposal. The main argument is that such a gambling location should not be located so close to a state university. The Shippensburg University campus is less than two miles from where the Parx casino will operate.</p>
<p>Smoke-Free Facility</p>
<p>Pennsylvania expanded its gaming industry in 2017 with a major legislative package that authorized sports betting, iGaming, truck stop video gaming terminals (VGTs), airport gaming lounges, and as many as 10 Category 4 satellite casinos.</p>
<p>The satellites are permitted to house up to 750 slot machines. For an initial allotment of 30 table games, the Category 4 business must pay the state an additional $2.5 million.</p>
<p>Parx Shippensburg officials told the PGCB this week that its initial plans call for 500 slot machines and an indeterminate number of electronic table games. A restaurant and sports bar are also in the works. However, the establishment will be a smoke-free venue.</p>
<p>The 73,000-square-foot casino is expected to create 175 construction jobs and 125 full-time permanent positions. Parx Casino Shippensburg hopes to open by the end of the year.</p>
<p>As for sports betting, Parx says it’s holding off for now. At its Philadelphia casino, the Parx Sportsbook is powered by GAN, a British-based third-party gaming firm that provides turnkey sportsbook products.</p>
<p>Satellite Status</p>
<p>Three Category 4 satellite casinos in Pennsylvania are open for play.</p>
<p>Live! Casino Pittsburgh in Westmoreland was the first to welcome gamblers in November of 2020. Hollywood Casino York was next, the Penn National property commencing operations last August.</p>
<p>Penn National opened Hollywood Casino Morgantown last month in southern Berks County, along the Pennsylvania Turnpike.</p>
<p>The satellites are helping give new life to vacant malls and shopping centers. Live! Casino Pittsburgh took the place of a former Bon-Ton department store. Hollywood York replaced a former Sears.</p>
<p>Along with Parx Shippensburg renovating a Lowe’s, another satellite casino near Penn State University is targeting a shuttered Macy’s for its project. Only Hollywood Morgantown resulted in a new, from-the-ground-up, building.</p>
