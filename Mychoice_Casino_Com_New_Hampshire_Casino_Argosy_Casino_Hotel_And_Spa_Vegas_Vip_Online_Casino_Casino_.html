    <h1>Mychoice Casino Com New Hampshire Casino Argosy Casino Hotel And Spa Vegas Vip Online Casino Casino</h1>

<p>Hello team,</p>
<p>It's about the verification process at Vegadream. I've been registered with Vegadream for some time now and have already made a few deposits and withdrawals. I have already gone through various verification processes, e.g</p>
<p>ID</p>
<p>bank statements</p>
<p>Address verification</p>
<p>payslips.</p>
<p>It has all worked until today.</p>
<p>Now I wanted to make a payment on May 2nd, 2022, which is still on process because documents are probably missing. The yellow button at Vegadream also appeared that I should take further information from the email or in the deposit menu which documents are missing. Unfortunately I didn't get an email with a link or any other information. I then contacted LiveChat and he told me that an email went out on May 2nd, 2022, but I didn't receive it. The customer advisor didn't want to help any further. Check your spam and inbox again he said. Ok then I thought I would email my documents to support@hd.vegadream.com. But then I did not answer that the process is now complete. Then I thought maybe something is wrong with the email provider. I then changed my email address at Vegadream and asked for the link to be sent again in LiveChat on May 4th, 2022. The customer service representative said it took 24 hours for the email to arrive. But again I didn't get an email. Now I contacted them again on May 6th, 2022 to ask why I didn't get an email. The customer advisor then repeated again that the email had been sent to my email address on May 2nd, 2022, although I had applied for a new email on May 4th, 2022. So the customer advisor didn't seem to know what the other said. I get all other emails from Vegadream with bonuses and promotions but I don't get the verification link and I don't get a concrete answer or help in the live chat. I don't understand why it worked all the time and now it suddenly doesn't. Now I have 3 pending payouts that are not being processed. That's why I want to get in touch here today to get help.</p>
