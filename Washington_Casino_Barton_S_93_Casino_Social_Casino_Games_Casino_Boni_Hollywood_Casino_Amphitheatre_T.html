    <h1>Washington Casino Barton S 93 Casino Social Casino Games Casino Boni Hollywood Casino Amphitheatre T</h1>

<p>thank you for your prompt response, I had created an earlier this year and was apprehensive of depositing any funds to the account as I have heard many horror stories about online casinos, so I just played the 25 No deposit free spins they email me every second day. Recently a close friend withdrew funds From extra Vegas and assured me it Was legitimate and showed me her bank statements. So I brought a $20 Neosurf voucher and selected a bonus that was I think 200%-300% with I think 30-50 free spins I didn’t take much notice as I was eager to play. All I remember was my $20 Neosurf with the deposit bonus gave me $100. I played for a few hours switching between games then all of a sudden it would not load any games giving me an error at the time I thought it to be a wifi issue on my end after a modem reboot it still gave me an error no matter which game I selected. I then attempted to log on using my phone and 4g connection but upon filling in the log in details it appeared with an error informing me of my account being disabled. As far as I’m aware this was my only account. I have attached images of the final conversation Outcome On their behalf and a screen shot of my last balance before y account was disabled</p>
