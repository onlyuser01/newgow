<p>Technology, content and media specialist in sports betting and fantasy sports Spotlight Sports Group continued to expand its presence in the US with a groundbreaking sports wagering monetization partnership with Advance Local.</p>
<p>More than Just ‘Clickbait’</p>
<p>The agreement reached with US media powerhouse Advance Local will see Spotlight Sports Group deliver localized and international sports betting content featuring games, sports wagering tools and latest scores, as well as integrated affiliation tools to boost search engine optimization (SEO) and revenue for its partner across multiple Advance Local markets.</p>
<p>Rick Wolf, senior vice president at Spotlight Sports Group, hailed the partnership between the teams that “align on a vision of content-rich, localized sports betting experience” and seek to create something more than just “clickbait.”</p>
<p>“The addition of a turnkey sports betting content platform, uniquely tailored to each local market, will give fans in Syracuse, for example, access to highly localized sports betting content, tools and engagement that makes the games more fun to watch.” Rick Wolf, SVP, Spotlight Sports Group</p>
<p>Already live across New York via Advance Local’s Syracuse.com, NYUP.com and SILive.com websites, Michigan through MLive.com, the partnership is targeting a launch in Oregon in the first quarter of 2022 via OregonLive.com.</p>
<p>“We are excited to roll out localized versions of our partnership across multiple Advance Local outlets,” Wolf continued, highlighting the end goal of “seeing the investment made by Advance Local into Spotlight Sports Group repaid in new revenue,” as the group’s efforts ensure a “deeper sports experience” for Advance Local audiences.</p>

<p>Under the partnership, Spotlight Sports Group will provide Advance Local with its turnkey sports betting solutions under specific sections on the media’s local websites. Audiences will have access to articles aimed at casual and regular sports bettors, free bets and offers, scoreboards powered with the latest scores and betting tools, custom sports betting event guides, modules for smart content and free-to-play games.</p>
<p>“Spotlight Sports Group provides national and local content to drive engagement, but creating community with games and tools to make sports fans smarter is the exciting part of this partnership.” Howard Kamen, VP of Sports Betting &amp; iGaming, Advance Local</p>
<p>Pointing to Spotlight Sports Group’s existing relationships with licensed in multiple states sports betting operators, Kamen said they would be “doing the heavy lifting,” leaving the media to focus on its audiences and their needs.</p>
