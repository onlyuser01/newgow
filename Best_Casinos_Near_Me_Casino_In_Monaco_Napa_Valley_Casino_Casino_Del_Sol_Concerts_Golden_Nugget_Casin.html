    <h1>Best Casinos Near Me Casino In Monaco Napa Valley Casino Casino Del Sol Concerts Golden Nugget Casin</h1>

<p>Nick i gave them proof of payment,i also contacted my bank and they investegated and found the deposit was infact deposited into their Absa account,i gave them the ref nrs and tel nrs for the bank.My problem here is that they could have contacted their bank and asked them to confirm the deposit as the time date etc was on the proof of payment?i had a issue before with spinsa bec of my dep that got lost and spinsa uses the same payment provider as 1Red so that explains alot to me,but spinsa contacted their bank and all was sorted out in a couple of hours and my deposit was returned.1Red support and live chat did nothing to help with this lost deposit and they speak to me like im a child telling me what the system sais..deposit failed.No bank is going to give you proof of payment if you do not have funds in your account..in fact it will say deposit failed..and it wil tell you insuffiecient funds,when i made the deposit there was an error message after the deposit was confirmed that there is a problem with the portal...and this is what happened to spinsa aswell,thats why i know.The point here is that they dont care bec im not a high roller and its the same with the stock market as the big guns move the market and the forex companies pull in the retail traders with little funds in order for them to lose trades so that they can pay the big boys ..that is why we had the Gamestop saga where retail traders all stepped in and caused a hedge fund to collaps to show them what it feels like when the market gets manipulated,same with casinos...i actually try out these casinos bec i have a blog on helo peter and keep consumers informed on how any store or company handles issues so that they can make better choices before they decide to play at a casino or shop at a retailer.However i have now seen firsthand that casinos are exactly as the stock market,someone has to lose money for others to make money and in this case the vips at the casinos need to get paid.If you play at most casinos with small money you can clearly see that the RTP are never as they are advertised,the features are so scares even on the smallest amount you struggle to get one and if you do it pays mediocre.Furthermore they dont want to help you with issues and take days to respond.My friend who is a vip at a casino gets calls everyday if he has a issue they jump to sort it out and it takes no time at all for them to respond to emails from him.This is why i tell you i can clearly see the lack of interest in helping me,i do my homework from all sides before i do a review.In a industry where Casinos are hardly regulated like they should actually be they make their own rules and do as they please,especially if you are not a high roller you dont get close to the customer service my friend gets as a vip.To get back to your Question,i have now submitted statements again to them for the 3rd time with the proof of payement again and the ref nrs from the bank again,i am getting a little agitated now as i can clearly see thaty they are doing this on purpose to taunt me.But i can assure you that they will be the ones that is goin to get whats coming to them as i will go on every platform i know and i will tell people exactly what and how they treat a customer.This could have been resolved long ago with 1phone call from them to there bank,but my R100 deposit wasnt a priority to them.I did this just to try out their games to check the RTP but then this happened which was great now i can inform readers more about the customer service i got and i have all the documentation emails etc to show them what i had to go through.Then im gona deposit R5000 and im goin to double my money and thank them for the great service..i do my homework on slots i know you have to have leverage and a bit of money to make some so i get the whole setup....im a honest person and i think the way people get treated just bec the are not high rollers are disrespectfull and i dont like being treated like a child when clearly they are in the wrong and think im crying over the R100 deposit..lol i trade in the markets and have years of experience in the pros and cons of the market as i got to speak to a x market maker who told me things that shocked me, so it just boils over to the casinos who follow suite as only America is heavely regulated and you can see this when the stock exchange opens there is no funny market movements that you will experience in the other trading sessions when they open as they are hardly regulated,and this is when the funny business starts in the market but not in the new york session as the market is being monitored all the time until the new york session ends so its the same with casinos unfortunately you can see how games are manipulated but they dont care ..who is going to tell them otherwise?.But if i can help some people to make a better choice and avoid certain Casinos i think i do help a little,but i will not stop doing so.</p>
