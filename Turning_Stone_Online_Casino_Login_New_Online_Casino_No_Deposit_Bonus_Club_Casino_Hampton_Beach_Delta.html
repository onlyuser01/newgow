<p>The Pittsburgh Steelers vs. Cleveland Browns is one of the most exciting duels of NFL Week 11</p>
<p>Not only are the Pittsburgh Steelers and Cleveland Browns fierce rivals, but in the 2023 NFL, these two are direct competitors for a playoff spot. Each team has a 6-3 record this season, meaning that each can challenge for the No. 1 spot in the AFC North Division.</p>
<p>Right now, the Baltimore Ravens are at the top of the divisional table, but they play against the bottom-placed AFC North team, the Cincinnati Bengals, who are expected to up their form ASAP.</p>
<p>Knowing that the Steelers vs. Browns Week 11 game is important for all the teams from the AFC North, it’s only logical to assume that we’re going to witness a spectacle at Cleveland Browns Stadium. But who’s going to win the November 19 game?</p>

<p>Pittsburgh Steelers Dreaming Big Again</p>
<p>The Pittsburgh Steelers can be proud of their defense in 2023. They’re conceding just 20.2 points per game, but more importantly, they were able to keep six of their nine opponents this season to bellow that number.</p>
<p>In fact, in each of their five previous NFL games, the Steelers’ defense kept the opposition to 20 points or fewer. This isn’t too much of a surprise given that their defensive team is packed with amazing players, most notably, the QB-sacking expert T. J. Watt.</p>
<p>The Steelers defeat the Cleveland Browns 26-22 to earn their first win of the season‼️</p>

<p>In the first duel with Cleveland, Pittsburg’s defense kept the opposition offense to 22 points, but that was enough for a win. It’s because they also scored two pick-six touchdowns on their own to help the Steelers get 26 points in that game.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Pittsburgh’s offense hasn’t been as equally impressive. Actually, these guys are scoring just 17.3 points per game on average, which makes their offensive team the seventh worst in the league.</p>
<p>Cleveland’s Starting QB Deshaun Watson is Out (Until 2024)</p>
<p>We won’t see Deshaun Watson on the field on Sunday, which could be a serious problem for the Browns. The quarterback will have to undergo shoulder surgery which will keep him sidelined for the rest of the 2023 season.</p>

<p>P.J. Walker will probably take his place, but this isn’t great news for Cleveland’s fans. This guy has a completion rate of just 49% in the 2023 season, not to mention that he’s thrown five interceptions in five games he’s played.</p>
<p>On top of everything, he has also been sacked seven times so far, which is bad news knowing that he’ll be facing T. J. Watt and the Steelers on Sunday. Coach Kevin Stefanski is well aware of this, which is why he’ll probably tell his boys to focus on rushing rather than passing.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, with Nick Chubb out, the Browns might find it hard to do much rushing the ball. Sure, they’ve got Kareem Hunt and Jerome Ford who have been pretty good so far, but we’re not sure they’ll be able to produce a lot against Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh Steelers vs. Cleveland Browns Prediction</p>
<p>With P.J. Walker as their quarterback, the Browns just can’t do much offensively against the Steelers. They might try to run the ball, but that probably won’t result in too many touchdowns. In fact, we could see them only score field goals in Sunday’s game.</p>
<p>But what about the Steelers? They haven’t been great offensively, with their second-year quarterback Kenny Pickett throwing for just two touchdowns since September. However, a great thing about Pickett is that he doesn’t make dumb moves, so we probably won’t see the Browns’ defense taking advantage of his mistakes.</p>
<p>Pick: Pittsburgh Steelers to win; under to hit</p>
