<p>Global leader in luxury hospitality and entertainment Wynn Resorts announced Friday its sports betting brand, WynnBet, managed to secure market access to 7 US states, after finalizing an agreement to launch the mobile sports wagering app in Iowa.</p>
<p>Iowa Becomes the 7th State to Feature WynnBet</p>
<p>WynnBet signed a multi-year partnership deal with the integrated resort company in the Hawkeye State Elite Casino Resorts, to be able to launch its sports betting mobile app via the license of Riverside Casino and Golf Resort owned by the new partner.</p>
<p>The new partnership deal expanded WynnBet’s presence into 7 US jurisdictions less than 6 months after the sports betting brand launched for the first time in New Jersey back in August. Currently, the sports betting app is live in Colorado, besides the Garden State, and would soon commence operations in Michigan.</p>
<p>In addition, WynnBet gained access to 3 other states besides Iowa, Indiana, after partnering with Full House Resorts and Rising Star Casino Resort, Nevada and Massachusetts, and is also waiting to get licensed in Tennessee and Virginia.</p>
<p>In Virginia, ahead of its official launch, WynnBet signed a deal with NASCAR to offer dedicated in-race markets through its proprietory app and introduce dedicated betting lounges at Richmond Raceway and Martinsville Speedway.</p>
<p>In Tennessee, WynnBet is among an elite group of operators including BetAmerica, William Hill and ZenSports, waiting for approval to join the market which shattered the record sports betting handle for first month of operations in November.</p>
<p>WynnBet noted it was already in discussions to acquire market access to more than a dozen of other states where sports wagering is gathering speed, looking to keep the pace with the fast-moving iGaming and sports wagering industry and reach to approximately two-thirds of potential online sports bettors in the US.</p>
<p>App Built on Hospitality and Social Games Interface</p>
<p>Nothing of this would have happened without the partnership Wynn Resorts signed in 2018 with the UK social gaming provider BetBull to acquire a 22.5% stake in the gaming operator.</p>
<p>Following on that strategic partnership, Wynn Resorts and BetBull agreed in November 2020 to create an $80 million joint venture, Wynn Interactive, as well as for the acquisition of BetBull by the luxury hospitality company for an undisclosed price.</p>
<p>The WynnBet app is expected to offer delight to both professional and casual sports bettors, being at the intersection point of Wynn Resorts’ unmatched expertise in hospitality and customer service and BetBull’s ultra-intuitive and highly responsive customer interface, necessary for any social games operator.</p>
