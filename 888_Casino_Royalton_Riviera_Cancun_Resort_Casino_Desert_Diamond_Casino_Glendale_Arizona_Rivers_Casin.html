    <h1>888 Casino Royalton Riviera Cancun Resort Casino Desert Diamond Casino Glendale Arizona Rivers Casin</h1>

<p>Let me start at the beginning... ( never play or ask for a bonus )</p>
<p>2 months ago I had a withdrawal of €1200.</p>
<p>This was refunded on my account after more than a week.</p>
<p>With this amount I made €60.000.</p>
<p>First I tried to withdraw with my bank account ( which was my first deposit )</p>
<p>Then I tried with Credit Card ( which was my 2nd deposit )</p>
<p>I live in Netherlands and found Boomerang.bet through multiple Dutch websites,</p>
<p>when I searched on Google for "Online Casinos iDEAL".</p>
<p>I wasn't aware at the beginning of playing there, that I was in an illegal casino at that time.</p>
<p>I found that out after I noticed that the casino had excuses for paying out my withdrawals.</p>
<p>And looked for reviews on Trustpilot.</p>
<p>Yesterday I thought fuck this and kept spinning on slots until I had no Ballance left,</p>
<p>So 60k loss because they kept refunding my withdrawals.</p>
<p>I have a withdrawal pending at the moment, but as you can understand I don't care anymore if I get it or not and actually it's better if I don't get it, because I would be risking getting a fine of €8000</p>
<p>For playing at an illegal casino anyway....</p>
<p>If they would have payed out my withdrawals ( 60k ), then I would have taken the fine of 8000.</p>
<p>So you see I have no interest in getting my 5000 now</p>
