    <h1>Sky River Casino Sky River Parkway Elk Grove Ca Casablanca Resort Casino Golf And Spa Cashman Casino</h1>

<p>Dear marulicmaro9,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. I checked the casino’s T&amp;Cs and I found the term the casino is referring to:</p>
<p>"4.8 Your Player Account must be registered in your own, legal name. We permit only one account per person, household address, email address, telephone number, payment details (such as debit/credit cards or wallet IDs), IP address and/or device including those available publicly as in a library, workspace or Internet café. You may only open one account on this Website and in association with this brand. Any other accounts which you open subsequently on this the Website or otherwise in association with this brand shall be considered "Duplicate Accounts". Any Duplicate Accounts may be closed by us immediately and:</p>
<p>4.8.1 Any Bonus Funds will be confiscated and forfeited by you and any remaining Deposit Funds (less any Winnings) will be returned to you on request (minus any reasonable charges) subject to these Terms and any legal or regulatory obligations with which we are required to comply;</p>
<p>4.8.2 Any Winnings or bonuses which you have gained or accrued or (in relation to outstanding (unsettled) bets) may gain or accrue and which have been or may be credited to Your Player Account and/or withdrawn by you from Your Player Account during such time as the Duplicate Account was active will be forfeited by you and may be deducted from Your Player Account or reclaimed by us, and you will return to us on demand any such funds which have been withdrawn from the Duplicate Account."</p>
<p>Is there any chance, that someone from your household or using the same IP address has created an account at this casino too? Additionally, if there is any relevant communication between you and the casino other than in the attached screenshot, please forward it to kristina.s@casino.guru (or you can post it here).</p>
<p>Looking forward to hearing from you.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Kristina</p>
