<p>Information about Evoplay casinos</p>
<p>If you're looking for real-money Evoplay casinos to play your favorite slot games on, then this is the page for you. The game provider has a range of entertaining casino titles and is a popular choice among players.</p>
<p>By reading on, you're going to find out a little more about the company behind the Evoplay name, what you can expect from their games, and how you can use this list to find the best online casino with Evoplay games for you.</p>
<p>Table of contents:</p>
<p>Evoplay history: A pioneer in the world of 3D/VR slots</p>
<p>The history of Evoplay, or Evoplay Entertainment, can be traced back to 2003, when a group of online gaming entrepreneurs launched an enterprise to release B2B gaming solutions.</p>
<p>Following a period of success, the company formed a number of mergers and alliances to expand internationally. Today they help businesses around the world set up gaming platforms and also boast a range of engaging casino games that are known for high quality graphics and exciting features.</p>
<p>Their slot games form a key part of this portfolio and Evoplay showcased an industry first at the ICE 2018 gaming awards - a 3D/VR slot title called Necromancer, an in-browser game that required no download for the player to enjoy it.</p>
<p>Today, Evoplay has offices in London and Malta and holds the respective gaming licenses for each location: from the UK Gambling Commission and the Malta Gaming Authority, two highly-respected authorities that are seen as an industry benchmark.</p>
<p>Evoplay slots and software</p>
<p>Evoplay are expanding their game list by focusing on immersive experiences that are intended to make the player's jaw drop.</p>
<p>As mentioned, their selection of 3D/VR games are groundbreaking, and are designed to change the way we play slots.</p>
<p>Dungeon Immortal Evil, for example, is aimed towards fans of adventure fantasy. After an epic 3D opening sequence, it sees a warrior-like main character running through a castle and battling with monstrous enemies. Instead of reels, the player gets prizes depending on how many bad guys are slain each time.</p>
<p>As a contrast to this, Sprinkle adopts a cute, almost childlike theme. Like the previous game, it also has a 3D theme but, instead of battling monsters, the player hits 'spin' to find different variations of toadstools in order to win prizes.</p>
<p>It has to be said that it's difficult to find any stand-out jackpot or bonus features within these games. This could be down to the emphasis on such elaborate gameplay and dynamic graphics, but it's something that could change in the future.</p>
<p>All titles are available in six languages, and Evoplay offers to add any new language upon customer requests.</p>
<p>They also offer flexible currency options, with all major currencies being accepted, as well as cryptocurrencies. If you'd like to see which of their casinos offer this facility then simply go to our list of crypto-friendly casinos and click the Evoplay filter there.</p>

<p>How to find bonuses offered by Evoplay casinos</p>
<p>If you're here to find an Evoplay casino that allows you to make use of a casino bonus, then Casino Guru can help you find those, too.</p>
<p>After all, no deposit bonuses are a way of putting a casino on a kind of probation period: if you don't like it, then you just use up your bonus and walk away. First deposit or welcome bonuses are also a nice way of getting something extra, if used correctly.</p>
<p>To find interesting bonuses offered by Evoplay casinos, go to our list of online casino bonuses and select 'Evoplay' in the 'Game provider' filter. This will give you a list of eligible options.</p>
<p>You can also search for a particular type of bonus. If you're looking for no deposit bonuses, for example, check the 'No Deposit Bonus' filter in the 'Bonus Type' section to find the Evoplay casinos that accept these. Or you can go to our list of no deposit bonuses and choose 'Evoplay' there.</p>
