    <h1>Tulsa River Spirit Casino Casino Free Spins No Deposit Free 100 Registration Casino Resort And Casin</h1>

<p>Dear Frank,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your enquiry through our website. If you wish to place your first withdrawal, you will need to complete a verification process, also known as KYC. This is what I found in T&amp;Cs of Cosmo Casino (https://www.cosmocasino.com/en/terms/)</p>
<p>"Authorisation Procedure</p>
<p>i. Cosmo Casino reserves the right to ask Players for verification documents following deposits and/or prior to executing a withdrawal. Should it be deemed necessary the casino may also require these documents to be certified by a registered Notary. This includes, but is not limited to:</p>
<p>a. a copy of the card in question showing the card holder name, or evidence of the deposit method used (if applicable)</p>
<p>b. a copy of photographic identification documents; such as a Passport, Driver’s License or government-issued identity card</p>
<p>c. documents confirming residence, such as a bank statement or utility bill, no older than 3 months</p>
<p>ii. Funds must be withdrawn with the same method used for depositing, up to the amount of the deposit. Please note that an Account Holder's withdrawal may experience a slight delay due to our identity verification process."</p>
<p>I recommend you request a withdrawal and then in order to verify your account you will be asked to send all the required documents. Please bear in mind, that if you were playing with a bonus and didn’t finish the wagering requirements, you won’t be able to request a withdrawal.</p>
<p>Please let me know, how it went. I wish you best of luck Frank and await you reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
