<p>Angela Hill will become the first African American woman to headline a UFC card when she takes on Michelle Waterson in the main event of UFC Fight Night 177 on Saturday. According to oddsmakers, Hill is likely to pick up a big win, too.</p>

<p>DraftKings Sportsbook lists Hill as a -125 favorite over Waterson (+105) in the battle between the two women’s strawweight contenders.</p>
<p>Improving Hill Ready to Bounce Back from May Loss</p>
<p>Hill (12-8) doesn’t have a gaudy record or a history of wins over marquee opponents. But she has been steadily improving since getting her break on The Ultimate Fighter back in 2014. After bouncing from the UFC to Invicta and back again, Hill looks to have established herself as a legitimate contender.</p>
<p>Hill rode a three-fight winning streak before losing a tough split decision to Claudia Gadelha in May. But she says that the loss was inspiring rather than discouraging.</p>
<p>It just proved to me that I’m good,” Hill told MMA Junkie. “It was one thing beating those three girls beforehand. Those girls were either new to the scene or they hadn’t really proved themselves yet. But Gadelha, she’s been around.”</p>
<p>Waterson (17-8) has proven herself to be a worthy strawweight contender, if not quite up to the level of big names such as Joanna Jedrzejczyk. She has lost her last two fights, but feels as though she has the recipe to get a win against Hill.</p>
<p>“She’s a great striker. But believe me, I’m a better grappler when compared to her fights,” Waterson told Combate. “I think it’s going to be a very fun fight, because we both go for it.”</p>
<p>Undefeated Azaitar Faces Worthy Test</p>
<p>In the co-main event, the undefeated Ottman Azaitar (12-0) faces his toughest test yet when he takes on Khama Worthy (16-6) in a lightweight clash. Worthy enters as a -137 favorite to give Azaitar (+110) the first blemish on his record.</p>
<p>The UFC initially scheduled this fight for April. Worthy has lobbied for another shot at Azaitar ever since.</p>
<p>I actually asked for this fight right after my last fight [in June],” Worthy told reporters on Thursday’s virtual media day. “I think it’s a fun fight for the fans, win or lose. I definitely think I’m going to win, but win or lose, I’m going to keep pushing things up.”</p>
<p>Azaitar will make only his second appearance in the UFC Octagon, a fact he says he’s still learning to fully grasp.</p>
<p>“Like every other UFC fighter who worked hard in his career before he got to the UFC, it’s the biggest organization. It’s like the Champions League of MMA,” Azaitar told reporters. “It’s like a dream come true.”</p>
<p>Azaitar has collected nine knockouts in his career, seven of which have come in the first round. Worthy is no slouch in that department either, finishing opponents in 12 of his 16 career wins.</p>
