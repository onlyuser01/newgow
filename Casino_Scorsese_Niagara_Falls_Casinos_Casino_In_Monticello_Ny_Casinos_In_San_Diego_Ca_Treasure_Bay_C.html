<p>German slot developer Apparat Gaming has agreed to integrate its suite of slots into Hub88’s rich collection of iGaming titles. The platform provider called this deal “a natural progression” for the company.</p>
<p>Apparat to Power Hub88 with Games</p>
<p>As per the deal, Apparat will power Hub88 with its full slot games portfolio. As of now, Apparat Gaming, which is a fairly new studio, has only released four titles. The studio’s portfolio currently includes 40 Seven, Fruit Storm, Pharaoh Princess and Total Eclipse. In addition, the operator plans to release two more games in the weeks to follow.</p>
<p>Apparat Gaming’s four existing titles have been seamlessly integrated into Hub88’s offerings, thanks to the latter’s lightweight integration platform. As a result, the studio’s content will be able to quickly reach new operators and players. Meanwhile, Yolo Investments, Hub88’s parent group, secured a stake in Apparat Gaming. This suggests that the investor has further plans for working together with the slot developer.</p>
<p>Apparat Gaming jokingly describes itself as a stereotypical German developer with a dedication to quality and no sense of humor. As such, the ambitious company seeks to enrich the iGaming space with slot titles “with a German accent.”</p>
<p>A Natural Progression for the Two Companies</p>
<p>Apparat Gaming’s co-founder and director, Alina Dandörfer, spoke about the deal with Hub88. She said that her team feels thrilled to ink a deal with the platform provider. Dandörfer also noted that Hub88 is known for producing great results, which is why she is looking forward to working with the company.</p>
<p>Dandörfer lauded Hub88’s lightning-fast integration process which allowed Apparat Gaming to integrate its games in a blink of an eye. She also elaborated that the deal will allow Apparat Gaming’s content to reach many new operators and players. Therefore, Dandörfer concluded that the current partnership will be a great boost to Apparat Gaming’s ambitious growth plans.</p>
<p>Jose Micallef, Hub88’s managing director, said that adding Apparat Gaming to his company’s platform was “a natural progression.”</p>
<p>They offer a fresh and exciting list of titles which will attract a wide demographic of players. Jose Micallef, managing director, Hub88</p>
<p>Micallef is sure that Apparat Gaming’s titles will diversify Hub88’s portfolio and make it more appealing to operators. He is also sure that Hub88 will help Apparat Gaming reach new horizons.</p>
<p>A month ago, Apparat Gaming teamed up with Relax Gaming. As a result, its games went live on the Powered by Relax platform, offering the German developer maximum exposure.</p>
