<p>McGregor's comments were directed at Ryan Garcia and Gervonta Davis, two fighters who had recently agreed to bet their purse on the result of their fight</p>
<p>Conor McGregor, a former UFC champion and martial artist, has called out fighters who bet their entire purse for their fights, claiming that it is a practice that has gone on for far too long.</p>
<p>McGregor Slams Fighters Who Bet Entire Purse on Fights</p>
<p>McGregor claimed that fighters who engage in this practice lack self-confidence and are admitting to their own weakness. He also pointed out that fighters never follow through with the wager after losing, making the entire practice meaningless.</p>
<p>McGregor said on Twitter: “Fighting is tough. It can go any way. Luck plays a hell of a part. Don’t be saying you are betting your fight purse against each other because it never happens. And it’s stupid. Train hard. Fight hard. Earn your dough. And then enjoy it.”</p>
<p>The tradition of betting one’s entire purse on the outcome of a fight has been popular among fighters for some time. It creates a sense of drama and excitement during the pre-fight build-up, and it generates headlines in the sport. However, McGregor believes that it is a practice that needs to stop.</p>
<p>McGregor also had some choice words for his old opponent, Khabib Nurmagomedov. The two fighters have a long-standing rivalry that has been marked by trash-talking and heated exchanges. McGregor did not specify what he meant by his comments, but it is clear that the bad vibes between the two fighters are still very much alive.</p>
<p>Regardless of McGregor’s objections, the practice of betting one’s entire purse on a fight is likely to continue. For some fighters, it is a way to demonstrate their confidence and create excitement around their bouts. For others, it is a way to generate publicity and to generate interest in their fights.</p>
<p>McGregor Enjoys Lavish Gambling Night in Las Vegas After Boxing Match</p>
<p>While opposing betting between fighters, McGregor himself does not shy away from lavishly spending money gambling in Las Vegas. McGregor made a surprise appearance at a boxing match in Sin City where he watched Ryan Garcia lose to Gervonta Davis.</p>
<p>After the match, McGregor hit the famous casino strip and gambled with stacks of cash while drinking whiskey. He even interacted with fans, waving notes and taking photos with them. McGregor, who is set to return to the octagon later this year, also visited Garcia’s dressing room and called for a rematch with Davis, saying he wants to see it with no rehydration clause. McGregor later posted clips of his night on Instagram, declaring gambling to be one of life’s great pleasures.</p>
