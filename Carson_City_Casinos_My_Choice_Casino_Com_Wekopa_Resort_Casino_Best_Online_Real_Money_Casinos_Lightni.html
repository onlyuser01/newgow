<p>The leading provider of online gaming solutions and content for the growing iGaming sector, Yggdrasil, joined forces with Reel Life Games, a developer of content for the online gambling industry, to deliver a new and engaging slot game just in time for Valentine's Day. The duo announced Thursday the launch of Power of Love, a brand-new slot game that features a Valentine's Day theme and offers engaging functionalities.</p>
<p>The new title is the latest game from Reel Life Games that joins the YG Masters growing portfolio. In fact, the launch comes after only recently, another game was introduced called Midway Money. Yggdrasil's leading technology called GATI, enables the pre-configuration of the game, allowing operators to benefit from the quick deployment of new content, a statement released by the company reveals.</p>
<p>Reel Life Games' CEO, Andy Kniaz, shared his excitement about the latest announcement saying: "Valentine's Day brings around the chance to match a timely and novel holiday theme with some exciting features." He explained that the company is delighted to add another title to the growing YG Masters program. Finally, Kniaz said: "Working with Yggdrasil allows us to create fantastic gaming experiences, and we're confident Power of Love will be another strong performing title in the portfolio."</p>
<p>Power of Love is a 5x4 slot with 40 paylines that comes just in time for Valentine's Day and gives players a chance to win huge payouts. The game offers Wilds, a Love Meter and Free Spins. Besides ensuring engaging gameplay, the unique features grant players with a chance to win big prizes.</p>
<p>Stuart McCarthy, Yggdrasil's Head of Product and Programs, was similarly excited about the new game. He said: "Valentine’s Day is just around the corner and we’re delighted to announce that love is very much in the air with our latest release."</p>
<p>In conclusion, McCarthy pointed out: "Power of Love combines numerous exciting features with an amorous theme, and we can't wait for players to fall in love with our latest game!"</p>
<p>The recently released game comes on the heels of another announcement by Yggdrasil. Late last month, the company expanded further its reach within the Latin American market by announcing an achievement in Argentina.</p>
<p>At the time, the company confirmed it is preparing to enter the City of Buenos Aires after securing approval from the local gambling regulator LOTBA. This marks an important milestone for Yggdrasil as the approval enables it to team up with operators in the region to deliver its leading games and solutions.</p>
