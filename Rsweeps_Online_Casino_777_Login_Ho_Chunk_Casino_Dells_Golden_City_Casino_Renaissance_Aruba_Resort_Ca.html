    <h1>Rsweeps Online Casino 777 Login Ho Chunk Casino Dells Golden City Casino Renaissance Aruba Resort Ca</h1>

<p>Trusted online casino and sports betting platform We1Win which caters to the needs of players in Malaysia and parts of Southeast Asia has inked a brand ambassador agreement with seven-time World Snooker Champion Ronnie O’Sullivan. The deal has been confirmed via Ronnie’s official Twitter account and We1Win’s Instagram account.</p>
<p>Ronnie Invites Sports Aficionados to Stay Tuned</p>
<p>In an interview regarding his views and thoughts on soccer, UK’s favorite sport, Ronnie explained that he personally loves soccer, and loves watching the sport, but that he is not a mad soccer fan of his own. He explained that he occasionally watches “half a game” unless it is a “really exciting team” with Messi in it. Ronnie also mentioned that he likes watching Match of the Day but that he does not support any particular team. The pro snooker player mentioned, however, his affinity for Sheffield United and Sheffield Wednesday given his connection with the city where he spent a lot of time practicing snooker. He added that while he does not have enough time to personally attend live soccer games, he loves watching sports on TV.</p>
<p>While he never played soccer, Ronnie said that he would choose soccer if he could start his career over again, mentioning perks like “team mates” and employment from clubs.</p>
<p>Ronnie even shared a top of five fantastic players he would include in his own soccer team if we would own one: Maradona, Lionel Messi, Ronaldo, Ronaldinho, and Virgil Van Dyke. When asked to make a prediction regarding this year’s FIFA World Cup, Ronnie said it is “very hard to choose” a single team over the others, but mentioned France’s team seemed to be “doing pretty well”, along with Germany, the team that is “always in with a chance” and Brazil, “everyone’s second favorite team”.</p>
<p>When speaking about his new brand ambassador deal, Ronnie expressed his excitement and invited everyone to ‘Stay tuned!’ while posting a photo of himself when signing the new contract with We1Win.</p>
<p>Ronnie Is Already the Face of Eurosport, ROKiT, and BCR Riley</p>
<p>The player who recently scored a century in three minutes and 34 seconds at the 2022 Scottish Open is already familiar with what it means to be a brand ambassador, from his position as an ambassador for companies like Eurosport, BCE Riley, ROKiT, and Delasport.</p>
<p>The world champion and number one snooker player on the planet celebrated his 47th birthday at the start of December, this week. His impressive track record includes 21 Triple Crown Titles as well as a record for the most ranking titles (39).</p>
