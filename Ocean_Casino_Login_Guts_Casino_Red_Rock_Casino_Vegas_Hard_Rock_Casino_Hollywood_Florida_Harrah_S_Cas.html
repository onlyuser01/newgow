<p>IBIA, the International Betting Integrity Association (IBIA) continues to expand its clout across Latin America with a new memorandum of understanding on sports betting integrity signed between the association and The Lotería de la Ciudad, Buenos Aires’ gambling regulator.</p>
<p>Argentina has been one of the countries to seek and regulate gambling in its various forms, following a province-by-province approach. IBIA has chosen to follow in these footsteps and ensure that it secures important partners, such as the Lotería in ensuring that it has a better understanding and monitoring capabilities of the Latin American market as a whole.</p>
<p>As a result, the two partners will move forward with a commitment to exchange technical knowledge and keep each other apprised of potential breaches of sports integrity and betting. The partnership is just one of many to have come online, with IBIA recently opening additional working places in Brazil as it seeks to establish itself firmly in the region and ahead of more mass market launches.</p>
<p>Commenting on this opportunity, IBIA CEO Khalid Ali said that the organization was delighted to be working with the regulator and help ensure that sports is protected, and so are consumers.</p>
<p>"The association and its members will analyze the betting on their global markets, which cover over $137bn in sports betting revenue per annum, and work closely with the Lotería de la Ciudad to identify and investigate any suspicious betting activity," Ali said, underscoring IBIA’s own clout and importance in helping sports remain clean across the world.</p>
<p>Lotería de la Ciudad has also found a powerful partner as it would receive timely updates if there are suspicious bets being placed in its jurisdiction, making it easier to act against wrongdoers or nip such crimes in the bud. IBIA is a powerful network of established partners in this space, including 50 companies and more than 125 sportsbooks worldwide.</p>
<p>By joining hands with IBIA, Lotería de la Ciudad is sending an unequivocal message that it is willing to work for the betterment of sports integrity not just in Argentina, but also worldwide. IBIA has also been strengthening its presence in Latin America by recently signing up another prominent partner, galera.bet, which has become the latest local operator to join the network.</p>
