<p>Leading content aggregation platform Pariplay announced today a new business partnership after signing a major multi-state deal with Golden Nugget Online Gaming (GNOG).</p>
<p>Integration with GNOG Products</p>
<p>The distribution deal signed between Aspire Global’s aggregator Pariplay and GNOG will span across New Jersey, West Virginia and Michigan and will see Pariplay’s Fusion aggregation solution go live via integration into GNOG’s product offering, pending legislation and regulatory approvals.</p>
<p>“Pariplay is a seasoned content provider with a long history of developing innovative and high performing games for the iGaming industry. We are pleased to be partnering with Pariplay as we continue to expand on delivering quality content to our patrons.” Warren Steven, VP, Product and Operations, GNOG</p>
<p>The new gaming partnership is expected to offer online casino players across North America more game titles to choose from. Pariplay is already live in both New Jersey and West Virginia and has been recently granted provisional license in Michigan. Integration with GNOG’s product offering in those states is expected to complete in the first quarter of 2022.</p>
<p>‘Thrilling Way to Start 2022’</p>
<p>Commenting on the multi-state distribution deal, Pariplay vice president of sales Andrew Maclean underlined the agreement with GNOG was a “thrilling way to start 2022,” following the “major strides” the aggregator made in the US last year.</p>
<p>“As a major brand in the U.S., they have an impressive reach that will only be strengthened as future plans progress. It is another statement of intent for us, and we can’t wait to take our products live in key states in early 2022.” Andrew Maclean, VP, Sales, Pariplay</p>
<p>The deal with GNOG continued the strong partnership trend for Pariplay in 2021 when the aggregator entered into several comprehensive agreements across North America and experienced remarkable growth. In the final months alone, Pariplay signed major partnerships in the US and Colombia, as well as in Greece.</p>
<p>In December, Pariplay expanded an existing agreement with Rush Street Interactive to grant access to its content and products available on the Fusion platform to RushBet.co, a gambling website in Colombia operated by the Chicago-based betting and gaming company.</p>
<p>Earlier, Pariplay inked a content deal with BetMGM to provide its proprietary and aggregated third-party content via the brand’s product offering in New Jersey and Michigan, with an option for the partnership to expand into other US jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Also in December, Pariplay penned a deal with the Greek gaming tech company Kaizen Gaming to offer its in-house casino games developed by Wizard Games via the operator’s brand Stoiximan. The deal also expanded Pariplay’s reach to Portugal and Germany where Kaizen operates the Betano brand.</p>
