    <h1>Indian Casinos Casino Sports Betting Casino Jobs Las Vegas Council Bluffs Casinos Boyd Casino GiG Po</h1>

<p>Gaming Innovation Group, a provider of innovative tech and platform solutions for the online gaming sector, has confirmed the launch of the innovative brand</p>
<p>Rizk is powered by GiG’s award-winning platform and it is fully compliant with the newly-regulated market, which expects companies to meet new and arguably tougher gambling laws and regimes.</p>
<p>Rizk Returns to Germany with Strong Platform Partner</p>
<p>GIG’s status as a company focused on meeting fast-evolving regulatory prerequisites has helped it establish a firm foothold in the German market and other regulated jurisdictions. As a result, companies such as Rizk, a company owned by Betsson Group’s Zecure Ltd, have been able to deploy their product locally and focus on consumer acquisition in the most sustainable and business-oriented way possible.</p>
<p>GiG presently operates in 29 regulated gambling markets and plans to add another eight. In markets where the platform already holds a license to operate, it has been partnering up with the likes of Betsson Group, and other trusted entities in the industry. The company has also extended and strengthened its partnership with bet365, a prominent sports betting and gaming operator in May.</p>
<p>Commenting on this opportunity, GiG CCO Marcel Elfersy said that the company was excited to be embarking on this partnership with the website.</p>
<p>He argued that the expansion with Betsson demonstrated GiG’s own quality of technology and managed services. “We’ve positioned ourselves to be able to support our partners’ growth aspirations, understanding where those opportunities are and ensuring we not only meet those expectations but exceed them,” Elfersy added.</p>
<p>The executive explained that his company has been developing a strong product that can offer both a localized and personalized product while ensuring that it toes the regulatory line in every market it operates.</p>
<p>GiG Proves a Valuable Partner to Companies Operating in Regulated Markets</p>
<p>The opportunity to partner with GiG and further strengthen Rizk was also an exciting milestone for Betsson whose commercial director Andrew Valenzia was very happy to see Rizk return to the German market with a strong platform provider.</p>
<p>“Our main focus is to provide our German customers the best player experience in the industry, that is safe and sustainable,” Valenzia explained. Germany continues to be an important market for Betsson and the ongoing relationship with GiG allows the company to truly establish its footprint there and deliver better results than expected.</p>
<p>GiG has been working to actively consolidate its footprint in regulated gaming markets, having secured a license in Sweden.</p>
