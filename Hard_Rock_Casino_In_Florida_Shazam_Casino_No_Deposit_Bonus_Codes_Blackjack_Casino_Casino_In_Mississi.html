    <h1>Hard Rock Casino In Florida Shazam Casino No Deposit Bonus Codes Blackjack Casino Casino In Mississi</h1>

<p>I will tell my story with BURNINGBET.COM online casino (Service operates under the License No. 8048/JAZ issued to Antillephone, Authorized and Regulated by the Government of Curacao.)</p>
<p>I'm a sports bettor, but the story I'm about to tell can happen to casino players too.</p>
<p>What Burningbet casino is doing to me is an old tactic that I've been a victim of a few times at other casinos and I'm sure many will identify with.</p>
<p>They lured me in with a generous welcome bonus of 100% up to 300 euros for sports betting. OK. I deposited 300 euros and received another 300 as a sports bonus.</p>
<p>I like to bet high. I usually place bets by combining several selections on the same ticket. Last night (21/03/2022) luck smiled on me and after risking my real balance a few times I managed to win (with my bonus balance) two bets of 50 euros with odds over 20.00 (50 euros X odds) 20.00 = 1000).</p>
<p>My bonus balance has risen to over 2,000.00 euros. But I still needed to fulfill another 3,000 euros of rollover.</p>
<p>To my surprise, this morning I log into my account and find that my maximum bet had been capped at â‚¬0.15. That's right, 15 euro cents maximum bet. As I still have more than 2,000 euros of rollover to fulfill, this means that I would need to place another 13,000 bets in a period of less than 4 days.</p>
<p>I WILL REPEAT: 13 THOUSAND BETS IN LESS THAN 4 DAYS.</p>
<p>As there are no 13,000 sporting events in the next few days this makes my rollover totally impossible. And with my rollover becoming impossible, I won't be able to withdraw a single cent of my winnings.</p>
<p>These thugs have the perfect excuse not to pay me.</p>
<p>They will simply claim that since I didn't complete the rollover in time, my bonus balance has expired. But they won't mention that I only missed the rollover because I was prevented from doing so by the absurd limitation of 0.15 euro cents.</p>
<p>I didn't break any bonus rules and I'm entitled to receive this amount, because I also risked my real balance many times. As I won with the bonus I could have lost everything and in that case they would not refund my real money.</p>
<p>I'm not going to give up that easily on something I'm entitled to receive.</p>
<p>I've tried to argue directly with them via chat. But they play dumb and show no interest in tweaking things a bit.</p>
<p>I know the next step must be a direct complaint to the regulator to which the casino is linked in Curacao.</p>
<p>From what I understand the email address of the regulatory body of this casino is complaints@gaminglicences.com , but there is a user here on the site who says he was better served in his complaint against a site regulated by that same body when he sent a complaint to compliants@emoore.com .</p>
<p>Can anyone help me with any tips?</p>
