<p>BETBY has reached an agreement with Hero Gaming, a global gaming and betting operator, which will allow the company to establish a footprint in key territories worldwide and boost awareness for its products.</p>
<p>Sports Betting on Hero Gaming’s Growth Radar</p>
<p>The partnership will allow BETBY to leverage its product offering through Hero Gaming’s dedicated brands, Simple Casino and Boom Casino. The pair will promote BETBY’s own products across numerous markets, press release explained.</p>
<p>In addition, Hero Gaming will have access to BETBY’s dedicated end-to-end and AI-driven sportsbook solution. Effectively, the brands will tap into 900,000 live events every year and have access to the Betby.Games, which is a range of new esports titles that are available 24/7 to customers.</p>
<p>BETBY has been pushing aggressively to expand its reach and establish new partnership opportunities with new brands that allow it to leverage its products globally. The expansion push began in 2018 and has been ongoing ever since.</p>
<p>Commenting on these developments, BETBY CCO Chris Nikolopoulos welcomed the opportunity to be teaming up with Hero Gaming.</p>
<p>“We’re delighted to enter this agreement with Hero Gaming, one of the industry’s most exciting operators whose passion for creating great betting experiences is clear to see, and we look forward to rolling out our full solution with them.” Commenting on these developments, BETBY CCO Chris Nikolopoulos</p>
<p>BETBY a Preferred Partner for Hero Gaming</p>
<p>Hero Gaming CCO Sam Brown paid similar tribute to the partnership, arguing that the company was on a growth trajectory that would be strengthened by the expansion into the sportsbook segment and the addition of BETBY as the right partner to guide the company’s forays into the vertical. Brown similarly praised BETBY for their efforts in esports:</p>
<p>“The inclusion of BETBY’s esports and virtual titles adds an entirely new dynamic to our portfolio, and we can’t wait to see how our customers react to these products.” Hero Gaming CCO Sam Brown</p>
<p>The second half of 2021 has been particularly busy for BETBY with the company pushing aggressively to expand its footprint. In December, BETBY sealed a last-minute deal before the New Year’s, with Groove, an aggregator.</p>
<p>A month earlier, BETBY added cricket as one of its supported simulation sports and games and in August, the company introduced player prop betting markets with Digital Sports Tech (DST).</p>
