<p>The leading lottery app in the United States, allowing customers in 16 different states to participate in different lottery games, Jackpocket, announced that it hit a milestone moment, making 30 different people millionaires. Announcement about the important milestone came Monday when Jackpocket confirmed that a man from Dayton, Ohio, became the app’s 30th millionaire after securing a $1 million win from Powerball. The latest achievement reaffirms the potential and convenience of Jackpocket. In its decade-long history, the app has grown its reach, allowing more clients to conveniently play the lottery at the touch of a button.</p>
<p>Winning Big Feels Surreal</p>
<p>The lucky man purchased a $6 ticket via his smartphone. Little did he know that later on he would receive a notification from Jackpocket with a message saying “You won big!” The winner managed to guess correctly all white numbers, 17, 24, 48, 62, and 68, from the drawing on July 5, 2023. Sadly, the man only missed the red Powerball number, 23, which would have otherwise granted him a prize of more than $500 million.</p>
<p>“We just figured that while we’re here for a few short years, we might as well get a few tickets and see what happens. We feel very lucky,“ explains the lucky winner from Ohio</p>
<p>Still, $1 million is undoubtedly a life-changing sum. The 30th Jackpocket million-dollar prize winner, that is originally from Australia but lives in Ohio for work, explained that he played with numbers that were of “personal significance” to him, as well as his wife. But according to the lucky man, upon realizing that he secured a million-dollar win, there wasn’t lots of hoorays and shouting but rather “just more of a case of letting it sink in.” Additionally, he pointed out: “It’s still a bit surreal.” Speaking about the lottery, the man said that he enjoyed it and decided to give it a shot for a few years while he is in the country. Finally, he said that he and his wife feel very lucky considering the recent win.</p>
<p>Grand Prizes for Mega Millions and Powerball Grow</p>
<p>Both Powerball and Mega Millions are some of the most popular lottery games in the US. The jackpots from the two games survived recently and continue to grow.</p>
<p>Monday’s drawing of the Powerball saw no lucky winner guess correctly all white balls including the red Powerball. This enabled the jackpot to continue growing to approximately $725 million or $366.2 million in cash value. That amount will be up for grabs for the next drawing scheduled for Wednesday, July 12, 2023.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Mega Millions’ jackpot also survived the drawing on Friday. However, the next drawing for the lottery game is set for Tuesday, July 11, 2023, with an estimated grand prize of $480 million or a cash option of $240.7 million.</p>
