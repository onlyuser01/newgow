    <h1>Casino In Deadwood Legendary Waters Casino Buffalo Bills Hotel Casino Primm Nevada Casino Wilkes Bar</h1>

<p>Neither team can be too proud of what they’ve done so far in the Premier League, but there’s plenty of time to move up in the standings. Tottenham has been on decent form lately, with four wins in the last five league games.</p>
<p>Manchester United lost three of their last five games, and those losses happened against real underdogs. However, against tough opponents, the Red Devils did surprisingly well – they drew with Liverpool and defeated Aston Villa.</p>

<p>Manchester United Hoping for a Good Start of the Year</p>
<p>The Red Devils are 10-1-9 in the Premier League, with three defeats, one draw, and one win in their last five league games.</p>
<p>The teams they lost to during this period were Bournemouth, West Ham, and Nottingham Forest. Just a couple of seasons ago, the Red Devils would’ve steamrolled those teams, but in the 2023-24 season, Erik ten Hag’s team does not seem like a real powerhouse of English soccer.</p>
<p>To be fair to them, they did put on a couple of good performances when faced against teams from near the top of the Premier League standings. For instance, they drew 0-0 with the table leader Liverpool and defeated second-placed Aston Villa 3-2.</p>
<p>Tottenham Coming to North to Get All Three Points</p>
<p>The Spurs are 12-3-5 this season, with four wins in their last five Premier League games. Those five games saw them score 13 goals, showing that these guys really are in the mood for playing soccer. At least, their attackers are.</p>
<p>Tottenham’s defense, however, hasn’t been playing at a top level. They conceded at least a goal in 10 of their 11 previous games in the Premier League. One of the reasons for that is that their World Cup-winning defender Cristian Romero has been out with an injury for the past couple of weeks.</p>
<p>Another explanation is that apart from Romero and maybe a few more players, Tottenham’s defense just isn’t elite. Their offense, however, is very good and has gotten stronger recently with the arrival of Timo Werner from RB Leipzig.</p>
<p>Manchester United vs. Tottenham Prediction</p>
<p>Neither team is great at the back, but both Manchester United and Tottenham have a lot of potential in the final third.</p>
<p>That said, our prediction for Sunday’s game is that this is going to be a real thriller, with a lot of goals, possibly on both ends. But who’s going to win? We say neither of them. Instead, the most probable result is the draw.</p>
<p>Picks: Manchester United and Tottenham to Draw &amp; Both Teams to Score</p>
