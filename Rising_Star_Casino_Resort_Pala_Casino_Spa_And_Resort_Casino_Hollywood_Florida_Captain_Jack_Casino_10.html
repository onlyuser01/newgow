    <h1>Rising Star Casino Resort Pala Casino Spa And Resort Casino Hollywood Florida Captain Jack Casino 10</h1>

<p>Global sports betting services provider William Hill announced today two new initiatives related to the environmental aspects of its business and the future inclusion of females on leadership positions.</p>
<p>Going Green</p>
<p>In the UK, William Hill transformed entirely its supply of electricity, moving away from grid electricity to Total Gas &amp; Power, a supplier of 100% green electricity from renewable sources such as solar, wind and hydro.</p>
<p>“We have prioritised the Environment as being extremely important to William Hill, and have committed to becoming a Carbon Neutral Business.” David Medori, Chief Procurement Officer, William Hill</p>
<p>Electricity from Pure Green guarantees William Hill can now report zero emissions under the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol Corporate Standards, Scope 2, since the electricity supplied by the subdivision within Total’s subsidiary can be matched to Renewable Energy Guarantee of Origin (REGO) certificates.</p>
<p>“We have established aggressive targets over 5 years in C02 reduction on Energy, Waste, Transportation and Water. All metrics are on target. We have an Environmental Management Forum for driving through key initiatives and ensuring these are on both operating and PLC Board agendas.” David Medori, Chief Procurement Officer, William Hill</p>
<p>William Hill reported that the move to Pure Green will contribute to 61,500 tonnes of CO2 not emitted in the atmosphere for the whole duration of its 3-year contract, a quantity equal to the one emitted from 38,000 cars in the UK or 16,667 one-way London – Las Vegas flights.</p>
<p>Besides the initiative which would enable William Hill to significantly reduce the amount of carbon usage and become greener, the company is set to continue in the area with a full rollout of Smart Metering for its shops, a step that would further drive down the amount of emitted in the atmosphere CO2 in the future.</p>
<p>Lead IT Lady</p>
<p>Following on the program launched by William Hill Foundation in 2020 related to the development of future female leaders for the technology sector, William Hill announced its Lead IT Lady program, seeking to address the issue of shortage of female leaders in the industry by utilizing a series of educational and training modules delivered by experts in the field to allow participants further hone their skills.</p>
<p>Based in Krakow, Poland, the Lead IT Lady program also offers a module which addresses the issue of taking leadership on individual projects in the digital space such as the development of mobile applications to support nonprofit organizations, charities and local communities, as well as providing sessions on engagement skills for the currently enrolled 14 participants, including the 3 team members of William Hill Krakow.</p>
<p>William Hill, which is in the process of being acquired by US casino giant Caesars Entertainment posted strong fourth quarter results, painting an optimistic future outlook for the business.</p>
