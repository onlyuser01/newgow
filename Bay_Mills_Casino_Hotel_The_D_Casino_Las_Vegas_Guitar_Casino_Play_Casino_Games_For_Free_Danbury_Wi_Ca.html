    <h1>Bay Mills Casino Hotel The D Casino Las Vegas Guitar Casino Play Casino Games For Free Danbury Wi Ca</h1>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I did not have bonus. Its actual real money that i bet. Yes i do receive the explanation about splitting installments on my winnings and that is not my point. My point is if you ever for example won a huge jackpot on online casinoes would you the customer be happy always withdraw your winnings for a month? Can they just at least bring me up to there finance department and say that they will lock the winnings themselves and pay the money to me directly. This is how the norsk tipping is doing not on the other silly casinoes which gives a doubt for the player not safe. We have some coversation online from the help support but none of it can be transferred on my emails. Did a request but nothing happpens. Here is the stupid thing i was able to make deposit and withdrawals on the 1st stage and when i won more i keep the 112000 nok withdrawn. I got frustrated on why i cant get all my winnings at once or they could make arrangements for me on how they would like to me withdraw my winnings. None of it happened til i continued betting and lose. I decided to play again the 112000 nok and began to won again til it reached 666000 on a luck. I tried to withdraw but cannot withdraw anymore because they are missing documents. I was frustrated til i lose my winnings. They have a offering a 30% rakeback but none of it went well. So i close my account. I ask the customer service to reopen my account and yes it was reopened but the rakeback nothing and i cannot make deposit or withdraw now it is reopened.</p>
