<p>Hello Nick, Thank You for replying,</p>

<p>My account doesnt state the exact date my identity was approved it just says approved. I believe it was on 3-5-23.</p>

<p>I made bitcoin deposits thru my cash app and played. I had a bonus added to my bitcoin ddeposit by a chat support rep on two separate individual deposits 2 or 3 days prior to my withdraw request, and as you can see from the screenshot pics i sent with my complaint, I had played through the bonuses accumulating a nice withdrawable balance. The bonus playthrough was 0.00 when I requested the 2000.00 withdrawl. My balance was 3201.44 so after setting up the withdrawl proceedure for the 2000.00 There was still a balance of 1201.44 remaing in my account. I played a few rounds of slots and won an additional 6000.00 that also did not have any bonus or attachments to it. Later that evening I went in to my account to check on my withdraw status for the 2000.00, and discoved my winnings were taken by "manager approved" and replaced by " manager aporoved"balance of 97.00. I spent unknown amount of time texting and texting waiting and waiting with rep after rep agent trying to get a full explaination of where my winnings went and why had my 2000.00 withdrawl was also voided, ?all they had told me is some story that I added a coin to a bonus and Im sorry but I never added a coin to a bonus nor did I ever see an option anywhere to do such a thing.. all I havent been able to speak to anyone and I deserve a call back or to talk to a human instead of a text message for 8000.00. Instead of the run around time and time again. The last time I contacted the casino was through email approx.3-13- 23 and have not received response as of today. If you need the receipts from my bitcoin deposits I can provide them for you, however I will need a day to get them</p>
