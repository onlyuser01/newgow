<p>MGA Games has announced that it is introducing its titles with Casumo Casino, a leading global operator of online casino products in key markets such as the United Kingdom, Canada, Sweden, and beyond.</p>
<p>Through this new content partnership, MGA Games will deploy 18 of its titles, including popular picks such as 777 Caliente Megaways, Sofia Cristo Misterioen elCirco, Chiquito 2 Condemor al Rescate, and many others.</p>
<p>MGA Games is a Spanish developer of iGaming products with a strong tradition in the vertical and has delivered numerous and exciting opportunities for players. The company is known for its high-quality execution of individual games and storied designs.</p>
<p>Commenting on this new deal, MGA Games Sales Director Javier Lanfranchi has welcomed the opportunity to team up with Casumo Casino, an operator with a global significance and presence.</p>
<p>"This partnership allows us to reaffirm our position as a leading content provider in Spain and is an opportunity to take advantage of the synergies with Casumo for our expansion into other markets, which brings us even closer to our international objectives," Lanfranchi said.</p>
<p>Casumo CPO Mark Busuttil was similarly excited about the partnership and said that he was very happy to welcome MGA Games’ excellent portfolio of select titles as part of the operator’s library.</p>
<p>Busuttil said that Casumo was dedicated to providing its players with the highest possible standard when it comes to individual games, as exemplified by the partnership.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, MGA Games was able to secure a license extension in Sweden, another prominent and strictly regulated market, showing the supplier’s readiness to deliver outstanding products to some of the world’s most vibrant and regulated markets.</p>
<p>The supplier also teamed up with SkillOnNet to push ahead with its slot content in Portugal, as part of its ambitious European footprint expansion. Elsewhere, MGA Games has been growing in Latin America through a partnership with Olimpo.bet and in Africa with Premier Bet.</p>
<p>The supplier has built a robust footprint that positions it firmly in multiple markets across the world. Although a huge focus has been placed on Spanish-speaking audiences, MGA Games’ titles are universal and they bring value to players from all backgrounds.</p>
