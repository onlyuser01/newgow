    <h1>Ragingbull Casino Casino Online Slot Carter Casino Hotels Near Ameristar Casino Philly Casinos Playz</h1>

<p>Dear Romi, first of all for what it's worth, I thank you and I have deep respect for what you do and how you do it, for what my opinion is worth, you are truly great.</p>
<p>The point is that they really treated me like a criminal, they NEVER answered my support questions, they didn't even notify me of the account closure.</p>
<p>I find it really unfair, moreover I repeat, the law does not allow ignorance and I know this very well, but I immediately admitted the mistake when I understood it, I wrote to him, I didn't try to modify documents or anything else, and this was the thanks.</p>
<p>I believe that out of 6500 euros, and more than a thousand of deposit with mine, I could and perhaps should have been treated better.</p>
<p>I have provided them with ALL the documents requested, and for what it's worth I have always apologized and always been clear.</p>
<p>Truly surreal experience as far as I'm concerned.</p>
<p>Question: why, if it has to be registered in my name, do they tell me it shouldn't be stolen or lost?</p>
<p>I proved to him that it was stolen and not lost.</p>
<p>I am attaching the very first email of many that I sent more than a month ago, also copied and pasted so it is easier to translate.</p>
<p>in any case, thank you very much, we don't know who we are at all, but you have taken an interest in me, and that's a lot.</p>
<p>"Good morning, I'm the Peirasso10 account holder, Peirasso Alessandro.</p>
<p>I apologize in advance for the inconvenience, it wasn't my intention.</p>
<p>Some time ago I made a mistake by loading the account with a friend's card, from which no winnings resulted.</p>
<p>I later loaded (also conspicuously) from mine, where I finally received a modest win. Now I find myself having to upload the documents for account verification, in that section there is no room for explanations, the card holder, as well as my friend, has already provided me with all the useful documents, which I am ready to send you for ensure maximum transparency and loyalty on my part.</p>
<p>I would ask you to tell me how and where to send everything, I repeat, I apologize for the mix-up, I didn't know everything would take so long.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I really enjoy your site, both casino and sports, and while waiting for a response, I wish you Happy Holidays."</p>
