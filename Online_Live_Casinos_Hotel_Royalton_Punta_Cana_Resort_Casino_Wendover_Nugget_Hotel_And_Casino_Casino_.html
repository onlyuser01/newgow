<p>Rise of Olympus 100 review</p>
<p>Theme and Style</p>
<p>Players are transported to a world of myth and mystery with Rise of Olympus 100.</p>
<p>Exploring the kingdoms of Poseidon, Zeus, and Hades, players will embark on a perilous quest. If they keep each of the fickle gods on their side, the player might just achieve immortality.</p>
<p>Players who enjoyed the popular Rise of Olympus from Play’n Go will feel right at home playing Rise of Olympus 100.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>Rise of Olympus 100 is not limited to one setting, but rather alternates between the realms of Zeus, Hades, and Poseidon. Each of these worlds is guarded by the respective god.</p>
<p>In Hades’ hellish kingdom, sparks fly through the air and embers glow. Meanwhile, Zeus welcomes players to the heavenly Mount Olympus. Finally, Poseidon gives players access to an eerie underwater realm.</p>
<p>On the reels, players will see symbols associated with the three featured gods, including thunderbolts from Zeus, metal helmets from Hades, and tridents from Poseidon.</p>
<p>The gods themselves are rendered with undeniably hunky style, each showing off a chiseled face and muscular frame. All three take a turn standing beside the reels, guarding their worlds with pride.</p>
<p>Tension-inducing harp notes and the sound of wind blowing ensure that Rise of Olympus 100 has a moody, mythical atmosphere.</p>
<p>In combination, the soundtrack and graphics give a modern fantasy twist to ancient Greek mythology.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Rise of Olympus 100 is a five-reel, five-row slot.</p>
<p>A win is awarded whenever players land at least 3 matching symbols in a row. The win may be calculated horizontally or vertically.</p>
<p>Symbols that form winning combinations vanish after paying out, making way for new symbols to fall into their place.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all paying symbols.</p>
<p>Beside the reels, a multiplier is displayed, which is applied to winning combinations. For each winning combination, the multiplier increases, resetting when no more wins are available.</p>
<p>The Hades symbol has the ability to convert one set of symbols, the Poseidon symbol gives players 1-2 Wild symbols, and the Zeus symbol removes two sets of symbols.</p>
<p>Players charge the Meter with God symbol wins, and once the Meter has been entirely filled, the Wrath of Olympus feature is triggered. During this feature, Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades each perform their special power in a free round.</p>
<p>If players clear the reels during the Wrath of Olympus feature, the Free Spins feature is triggered. While in the Free Spins feature, the multiplier displayed beside the reels is not reset and can increase to up to 100x.</p>
<p>Players are awarded additional free spins by filling the Meter, up to as many as 100 free spins.</p>
<p>If players clear the reels outside the Wrath of Olympus feature, they are awarded a prize of 50x their total bet, which is then potentially increased by the displayed multiplier.</p>
<p>The maximum win possible for Rise of Olympus 100 is 15,000x the player’s total bet.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
