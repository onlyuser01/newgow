<p>Candy Dreams review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Clouds of cotton candy, as starscape of hundreds and thousands, this is the dream Candy Dreams is selling.</p>
<p>Candy Dreams is set in a world that seems as much inspired by renaissance paintings of heaven as by the world of sweet treats. The colour scheme evokes associations with Candy Crush and other popular sugary games from outside the world of slots.</p>
<p>Whether this works for you is down to how sweet your tooth is.</p>
<p>Big win in Candy Dreams slot</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The graphics are pretty middle of the road. They feel up to date, but don't stand out much, even in a world of frequently reskinned slot software.</p>
<p>The animations are unimpressive and despite their complexity fail to make reading the reels any easier, which is their main function.</p>
<p>The music is serviceable but low-fi, and the sound effects, like the animations, fail to enhance the player's experience.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Visually Candy Dreams looks like it might be aiming to break the mould with its gameplay. The player is first struck by the reel format: 3-4-5-4-3. This look is deceiving, the main game is a basic click and win style slot.</p>
<p>The base game has no additional features, though there are two simple bonuses (details below) to spice things up.</p>
<p>Candy Dreams is an any way wins slot, where in place of win lines the slot pays out whenever three or more symbols appear anywhere on adjacent reels starting from reel one. This makes for 720 ways to win.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Planet and Lollipop symbols.</p>
<p>Three or more Planet symbols anywhere on the reels trigger a picking game, in which the player can win coins by picking planets and avoiding the Pop symbol which will end the game.</p>
<p>In addition to the winnings from the picking game, players also win a fixed amount depending on the number of Planet symbols that trigger the bonus game: 1x the bet per spin for three Planet symbols, 10x for four, and 100x for five.</p>
<p>The Lollipop symbol pays out the same amount but triggers a Free Spin bonus instead.</p>
<p>Extra Wilds are added in free spins bonus game</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.82%, which is a reasonable chunk of change over our yardstick for average of 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.50 up to a maximum of $/£/€50.00 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is medium, making it a poor match for our preferred slot strategies.</p>
<p>Full paytable for Candy Dreams slot</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Candy Dreams is not much to look at, comes with basic gameplay and medium volatility.</p>
<p>The RTP is pretty nice but stands alone as the slots main source of attraction and would need to be paired with higher volatility if it were to really sell us on this game.</p>
<p>In the end, we would recommend that you wake up from this dream and go play something else.</p>
