    <h1>Station Casinos Las Vegas Define Casino Hawaiian Garden Casino Little River Casino Resort Manistee M</h1>

<p>1X2 Network, a slot and table game developer, has integrated its full suite of slots with Sun Gaming, making its top-notch content available at the group’s casino and bingo websites.</p>
<p>The Full Suite Available at Sun Vegas, Sun Bingo, and Fabulous Bingo</p>
<p>1X2 Network is known for designing and developing highly entertaining slot and table games that combine smart math, exceptional visual and innovative features to deliver a one-of-a-kind immersive player experience.</p>
<p>Its full suite of slots is now available at Sun Gaming’s popular bingo and casino sites. The players at Sun Vegas, Sun Bingo, and Fabulous Bingo will be able to enjoy popular slots such as Pirate Kingdom Megaways, Battle Maidens, Megaways Jack and 1 Million Megaways BC, as well as the legendary Rainbow Wilds and Blood Queen. They will also gain access to 1X2gaming and Iron Dog subsidiaries.</p>
<p>Rory Kimber, Head of Account Management at 1X2 Network, said that the company is happy to see its suite of games among other big names in Sun Gaming’s portfolio. Sun Bingo, Fabulous Bingo, and Sun Vegas are all very popular brands with UK players.</p>
<p>The Deal Includes Branded Megaways Sun-Based Slot</p>
<p>1X2 Network boosts the content quality of operators by enriching their offerings. Sun Gaming will upgrade its portfolio with the additional suite of high-quality slots by 1X2 Network.</p>
<p>The deal includes a new Sun-branded Megaways slot game. The operator is looking forward to launching the title as soon as possible. Sun Vegas hopes that by launching a tailored slot experience, the brand will be able to engage with customers further and raise awareness for its intellectual properties with new and existing audiences.</p>
<p>The ‘Branded Megaways’ concept by 1X2 Network was launched in August last year and has quickly gained popularity. Today, it includes more than 50 branded games. ERG awarded it the Game of The Year title during the Operator Awards 2020.</p>
<p>Claire Turnbull, Casino Manager at Sun Gaming, expressed her excitement about the new partnership with 1X2 Network. She said that the company is eager to offer the developer’s high-quality content and provide players with a superb gaming experience. The companies would work together in the next months and add more titles from 1X2gaming and Iron Dog Studio.</p>
<p>1X2 Network Picked in 2021 Right Where They Left in 2020</p>
<p>1X2 Network is keeping the momentum from last year when the company partnered up with 888 Holdings. Now the 888 audience has the chance to enjoy Book of Lok, Battle Maidens, Theseus Rises, and other popular titles. In 2020, 1X2 also partnered up with Playtech.</p>
<p>The deal meant that 1X2 Network’s high-quality content will be distributed to Playtech’s in-house studio and third parties. With its POP Platform, Playtech carried out the 1X2 Network and Sun Gaming integration.</p>
<p>This year, the developer debuted at Kindred Group, which launched several 1X2 Network titles across several iGaming brands.</p>
<p>In 2021, 1X2 Network set foot in Canada for the first time. The award-winning developer inked a partnership deal with Loto- Québec, offering its latest additions to the Canadian market.</p>
