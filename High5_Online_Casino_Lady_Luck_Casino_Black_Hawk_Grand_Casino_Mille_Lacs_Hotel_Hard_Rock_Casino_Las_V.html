    <h1>High5 Online Casino Lady Luck Casino Black Hawk Grand Casino Mille Lacs Hotel Hard Rock Casino Las V</h1>

<p>Hi Casino Guru,</p>
<p>There are a few different elements to this complaint, so apologies in advance for the long response.</p>
<p>We make sure we're very clear with our bonus rules and in explaining how wagering works, in our Terms and Conditions, Bonus Rules and Bonus Explained. All of our Bonuses require that the wagering requirement is met with real money bets - from deposited funds or fulfilled bonuses which have released cash to a player's balance.</p>
<p>With regards to the 'wrong information' provided on Live Chat, this was nothing to do with the player's complaint. He had been told that there was a maximum cashout to the winnings, which was then corrected in an email, and was more favorable than the misinformation.</p>
<p>The player made the decision to close the account after this correction, and as I mentioned, it wasn't because of this. It was due to real money wagering required. The player did not request a break from the game's website. The request was to 'delete my acc here please this casino is not for me'.</p>
<p>I can assure you that the player was never deceived from the beginning, as our Terms and Conditions and Bonus Rules state the real money wagering, and the player agreed to them when registering and when using our services - these rules have not changed.</p>
<p>We declined to reopen the account, in accordance with our Terms and Conditions which state: 9.3 An account closed indefinitely, or for a fixed period of time that has now passed, may be opened at your request. Whamoo may decline to reopen any previously closed account at its own discretion.</p>
<p>It is also worth noting that the player has since further breached our Terms and Conditions, as well as possibly human decency and the law, by making death threats towards our Live Chat hosts, in addition to torrents of abusive language and wishes for them to contract deadly diseases. Therefore, the account will remain closed, as the player has been informed.</p>
<p>I can also advise that the player has had no financial loss as a result of this, as the wagering that led to the pending bonus winnings was with the bonus funds rather than any deposited funds or real money.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Whamoo Casino</p>
