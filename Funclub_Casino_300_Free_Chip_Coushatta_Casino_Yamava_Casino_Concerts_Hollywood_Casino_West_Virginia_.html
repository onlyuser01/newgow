<p>Cincinnati Bengals vs Cleveland Browns a.k.a. the Battle of Ohio is one of the fiercest rivalries in the NFL. Both teams play in the AFC North, meaning that this fixture has a direct impact on their chances of making the playoffs. The same is the case in the 2022 NFL – whoever wins on Halloween will make one giant leap toward the postseason.</p>
<p>For the Bengals, winning on Monday Night Football would mean equaling the record of the Baltimore Ravens, who are currently topping the divisional table. For the Browns, a win in the MNF game of Week 8 would mean ending the 4-game losing streak and staying in the contest for the playoffs.</p>
<p>That said, both teams have plenty of reasons to give their utmost on October 31, which is why we expect to see a real spectacle at FirstEnergy Stadium.</p>

<p>Cincinnati Bengals Mustn’t Take a Wrong Turn on Monday</p>
<p>Our Cincinnati Bengals vs Cleveland Browns prediction is that this is going to be a real Halloween thriller. Even though oddsmakers think the visitors are going to have a relatively easy job, we think the game might easily turn into a nightmare for the Bengals.</p>
<p>The thing is that their defensive team is decimated by injuries. This goes especially for the players who’d be in charge of stopping the Browns’ running game. They also have some bad memories of the duels with the Browns, at least in the last couple of years – they lost each of the previous four Bengals vs Browns games.</p>
<p>On the bright side, the Bengals’ offense looks terrific at the moment. This goes especially for their quarterback Joe Burrow who’s having a fantastic season. In the last couple of games, we saw him play at a real MVP level.</p>
<p>Nick Chubb to Cause Nightmares for Cincinnati’s Defense</p>
<p>Containing running back Nick Chubb in the backfield looks like a mission impossible for the Bengals defense. Their defensive stats aren’t bad – they’re #3 in the NFL in opponent-rushing TDs per game – but they do have some serious problems with injuries. Linebackers Markus Bailey and Logan Wilson are out. The same goes for defensive tackle Logan Wilson and defensive end Josh Tupou.</p>
<p>Not only does all this mean that Chubb’s running game is going to wreak havoc on Cincinnati, but Cleveland’s passing game might impress as well. QB Jacoby Brissett isn’t a great passer by NFL standards, but the fact that he’s thrown for six TDs thus far shows he’s got the killer instinct.</p>
<p>Cincinnati Bengals vs Cleveland Browns Prediction</p>
<p>This is going to be a very close game, which can easily go either way. The Bengals are superb in passing, while the Browns are amazing rushing-wise. Cincy’s QB Joe Burrow and Cleveland’s RB Nick Chubb will be in the spotlight. Whoever does better, his team will win.</p>
<p>We think it’s going to be Burrow. It’s just that the Bengals’ signal-caller is playing at an elite level at the moment.</p>
<p>Picks: Cincinnati Bengals to win but not cover the spread; over to hit</p>
