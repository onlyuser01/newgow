<p>Leading German iGaming operator Jokerstar has secured a fresh content partnership with Swintt, an established supplier and developer of products for the online casino sector. This partnership enables Jokerstar to significantly increase its library of games and offer new experiences to local gamers.</p>
<p>The partnership focuses on Swintt’s Premium and Select games, which are some of the studio’s best-performing options across multiple markets. Swintt insists that its titles come with both a solid gameplay and excellent visuals &amp; graphics, creating compelling experiences that players enjoy from start to finish.</p>
<p>Swintt will be delivering on a range of games, including the Master of Books Unlimited and Seven Books Unlimited, along with branded games such as The Crown, which features the image and likeness of Vinnie Jones, a famous movie actor who has starred in some of the biggest action movies of his generation.</p>
<p>German players will have the opportunity to experience new releases as well, including SecretSpellbook Respin. The studio is also using the Select portfolio to provide players with a number of classic games that have been overhauled and revamped to meet modern consumers’ specific preferences when it comes to pure gameplay, but that also ensures that players have that nostalgic feeling when they play.</p>
<p>More popular releases include Aloha Spirit XtraLock, Monster Disco XtraHold, and other titles and games that will be a part of the company’s portfolio. Swintt head of business development Lars Kollind was pleased to see this new partnership form in Germany. He said that the company was very excited to have the opportunity to share Swintt’s excellent games with German players through this newly-formed partnership.</p>
<p>He hailed the Premium selection of games, arguing that it deftly combined elements of classic land-based gaming experiences with the aesthetics of modern gaming products. Swintt’s products come with a range of features, including mystery and bonus levels, free spins, various multipliers, and triggers. Jokerstar CEOJuergen Kling said that his company remained committed to providing players with a great online gaming experience.</p>
<p>This would now be possible on a whole new level with the addition of Swintt’s games, which will further strengthen the company’s overall library and specifically its "Books and Fruits" lobby.</p>
<p>Swintt has created more than 140 innovative games in the iGaming vertical and is licensed by numerous regulators across Europe. Swintt previously formed an alliance with Bragg Gaming Group and the company also grew its presence in the Baltics with Spins.lv.</p>
