<p>Better Collective announced new hire Rosenberg will spearhead the group’s branding efforts for its US brands with one of his first tasks being to establish a local communications team focused on brand awareness.</p>
<p>“This is a dream opportunity for me as an avid (and unapologetic) Philly sports fan and member of the growing online sports betting community,” commented Rosenberg, who assumed the new role on February 14.</p>
<p>“Sports betting isn’t going anywhere and with more US states bringing legalized mobile sports betting online this year, more and more sports fans will be able to mix art and science in making their picks. I am thrilled to be joining Better Collective’s family of brands and eager to get in the room and get to work.” Adam Rosenberg, Head of Marketing &amp; Communications, Better Collective US</p>
<p>Rosenberg will be expected to leverage his experience gained from various roles in digital marketing, branding and communication across technology, esports and sports betting industries, to lead the group’s efforts in the US where sports betting is continuing to gather speed.</p>
<p>So far, Better Collective relied on acquisitions to establish a presence in US markets, having acquired the Action Network in a deal valued at $240 million in October last year, as well as the remaining 40% stake of RotoGrinders Network for approximately $38 million.</p>
<p>“It is great for Better Collective US to get Adam onboard. He has the skills and experience we are looking for to support our continued strong growth in the US market and to increase the awareness about our many strong US brands including Action Network, Vegas Insider, US Bets and Sports Handle. I look forward to welcoming him.” Marc Pedersen, CEO, Better Collective US</p>
<p>The appointment of Rosenberg is the latest high-profile addition to the ranks of Better Collective following the appointment of Britt Boeskov as Senior Vice President of Strategy effective March 1 to support the group’s growth across sports media markets.</p>
<p>January was also marked with the agreement Better Collective and its sports media affiliate the Action Network signed with The New York Post to allow the media to benefit from the group’s detailed breakdown of sports events, including data, content, statistics, and dedicated betting section while increasing the group’s brand awareness.</p>
