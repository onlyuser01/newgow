    <h1>Grand Casino Hinckley Casino Arizona North 92Nd Street Scottsdale Az Hardrock Casino Tampa Diamond J</h1>

<p>Specialists in horse racing gaming technology Exacta Systems announced today the launch of its historical horse racing (HHR) system in New Hampshire via Ocean Gaming Casino.</p>
<p>Enlarging Ocean Casino’s Gaming Floor</p>
<p>Exacta Systems will initially deploy 50 HHR terminals at Ocean Gaming Casino in Hampton as the casino is significantly expanding its gaming floor with the addition of the cabinets featuring IGT, AGS and IntuiCode.</p>
<p>Exacta Systems’ chief executive officer and president Jeremy Stein outlined the excitement in the company to “bring this exciting style of gaming to New Hampshire,” pointing to the launch as the latest evidence of the company’s commitment to HHR and the New Hampshire market.</p>
<p>“By providing customers with our versatile system, Exacta Connect, we are able to offer patrons a diverse portfolio of game content. And with an office in Manchester, Exacta is ready to deliver the high level of support which our customers have come to expect.” Jeremy Stein, CEO and President, Exacta Systems</p>
<p>Leader in the historical horse racing and central determinate technology markets, Exacta Systems delivers engaging and entertaining games across different central determinate market segments via the Exacta Connect product, a “build once, deploy many”-type regulatory approved system.</p>
<p>Also commenting on the announcement, Ocean Gaming Casino owner Anthony Fusco outlined how great a partner Exacta System has been to date, working in collaboration with the casino and the New Hampshire Lottery “to ensure compliant and responsible expansion of charitable gaming.”</p>
<p>Similar to all charitable gaming in the state, tax revenue generated from HHR operations goes to the New Hampshire Education Trust Fund and local charitable organizations while Ocean Gaming Casino affirms as the state’s premier destination for charitable gambling.</p>
<p>“We have no doubt that HHR will prove to be popular with patrons and generate significant new tax revenue for our local charities.” Anthony Fusco, Owner, Ocean Gaming Casino</p>
<p>2022 has been quite busy for Exacta Systems so far as the technology supplier entered into several key strategic alliances to enhance the attractiveness of its HHR system.</p>
<p>In January, Exacta Systems signed an agreement with Everi Holdings to bring its award-winning game content and cabinets onto Exacta’s HHR system.</p>
<p>In February, the horse racing gaming technology supplier signed a License IP Agreement with Georgia-based gaming technology company Aurify Gaming to expand its portfolio of game titles for the HHR facilities.</p>
<p>In March, Exacta Systems signed a similar License IP Agreement with Sega Sammy Creation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sega Sammy Holdings to bring the successful game content of the Japan-based gaming technology company to its industry-leading HHR library and further improve the library’s offering.</p>
