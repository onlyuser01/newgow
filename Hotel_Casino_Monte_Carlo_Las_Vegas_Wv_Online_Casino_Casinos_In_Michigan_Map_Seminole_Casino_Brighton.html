    <h1>Hotel Casino Monte Carlo Las Vegas Wv Online Casino Casinos In Michigan Map Seminole Casino Brighton</h1>

<p>The leading European games developer, Merkur, announced it joined forces with Gaming Arts, LLC, a Las Vegas-based gaming equipment technology provider, powering electronic table games, gaming machines as well as bingo and keno operators. Announced earlier this week, the collaboration represents a major step for Merkur as it aims to grow its reach within the North American gambling vertical.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the new collaboration, the companies agreed to jointly develop and supply games to North American casinos. Still, the delivery of such games remains subject to the relevant regulatory approvals, a statement released by Merkur reveals. Lauded as a strategic partnership, the latest collaboration seeks to propel Merkur's reach beyond the European gambling sector.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the company anticipates growing further and expanding its position in North America, leveraging its established role as a leading supplier and fueling the expansion of Gaming Arts at the same time. Per the new partnership, Merkur plans to further enhance and improve the experience for players within the growing gambling sector in the region.</p>
<p>David Colvin, Gaming Arts' owner, commented on the topic saying: "We believe this partnership is a pivotal moment in Gaming Arts' journey." He explained that the two companies share a common goal for expansion and growth through innovation. Finally, Colvin said: "Together, we are poised to deliver exceptional gaming experiences to players in North America."</p>
<p>Merkur is currently the business-to-business (B2B) unit of the internationally operating group of companies within the leisure and hospitality industry, Gauselmann Group. It is in charge of the development, sales and production of gaming machines, as well as games for markets such as Germany and across the globe. Merkur also focuses on the development of online games, iGaming and marketing solutions.</p>
<p>Juergen Stuehmeyer, the Board Member of Merkur's parent company Gauselmann AG, was excited about the latest North American-facing partnership. "We are excited about the immense potential that this cooperation with Gaming Arts brings to Merkur in our efforts to expand into North America," he said.</p>
<p>Additionally, Stuehmeyer pointed out: "Gaming Arts' rapid growth and innovation in the gaming supplier space have created an outstanding platform for growth in this crucial global market." In conclusion, he said that the company is looking forward to collaborating with Gaming Arts' seasoned team of veterans and CEO.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Merkur Casino Almere was hit with a â‚¬45,000 fine from the Dutch gambling regulator, Kansspelautoriteit. At the time, the gambling regulator said that the operator failed to restrict access to a visitor that has self-excluded via the self-exclusion gambling program in the Netherlands, Crucks.</p>
