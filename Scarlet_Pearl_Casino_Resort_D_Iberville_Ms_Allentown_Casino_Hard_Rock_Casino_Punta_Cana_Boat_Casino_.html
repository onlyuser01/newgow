    <h1>Scarlet Pearl Casino Resort D Iberville Ms Allentown Casino Hard Rock Casino Punta Cana Boat Casino</h1>

<p>Hi!</p>
<p>In a nutshell, I deposited 300 NOK and won 1600 NOK, but I wanted to withdraw the funds. The casino does not verify my account, and I am unable to withdraw funds.</p>
<p>The casino does not accept players from Latvia; however, they are accepting players from Norway.</p>
<p>The issue is that I am a citizen of Latvia; I have a Latvian passport; however, I am a resident of Norway. I have been living in Norway for more than 10 years. So I am eligible to play in the casino, but they do not verify my account just because I don't have a Norwegian ID.</p>
<p>I provided all necessary documents proving I am a resident of Norway, such as utility bills, Norway bank statements, selfies located in Norway, etc., but the casino still does not verify my account. As the only proof of residency, they require a Norwegian ID. Since I am a citizen of Latvia, I have a Latvian ID. They refused to verify my account until I provided the Norwegian ID.</p>
<p>Nowadays, considering globalization, it is obviously obvious that the ID of a certain country cannot be used as evidence of residency.</p>
<p>I think you are mixing two different terms: resident and citizen of the country. And in their terms and conditions, there is nothing mentioned about citizenship.</p>
<p>I will copy and paste some replies from their team:</p>
<p>"I'm afraid we cannot proceed with your request until a Norwegian identity document is provided."</p>
<p>"Our records indicate an issue with eligibility based on geographic restrictions, specifically regarding players from Latvia. As per our policy, we require a Norwegian ID for membership validation."</p>
<p>"Our terms and conditions specify that we require a Norwegian ID for account verification, and it appears that we have a Latvian ID on file for you."</p>
<p>However, when I asked which point the T&amp;C specifies, I needed to provide a Norwegian ID, but they could not give any answer because there are no such points in the T&amp;C.</p>
<p>To sum it up, I strongly believe the casino does not follow its own T&C; they are finding excuses, not verifying player accounts, and not paying winnings. I provided enough documents proving I am a resident of Norway.</p>
<p>I hope you can help me in this specific case. Also, please reduce the rating for the casino; they are no fair at all.</p>
<p>regards.</p>
