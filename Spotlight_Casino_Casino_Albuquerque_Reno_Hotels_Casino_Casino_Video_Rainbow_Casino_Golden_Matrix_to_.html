    <h1>Spotlight Casino Casino Albuquerque Reno Hotels Casino Casino Video Rainbow Casino Golden Matrix to</h1>

<p>Mexico is quickly turning into a focal point of iGaming operator and software developer interests. In fact, Golden Matrix GroupInc, a company that develops online gaming platforms, content, and systems, revealed plans to introduce a proprietary B2C online casino in the country on Tuesday, November 1, 2022.</p>
<p>The upcoming brand is aptly named "MEXPLAY" and it will be looking to introduce local players to a number of iGaming and sports betting content solutions. Golden Matrix Group will seek to engage with local players right from the start by deploying a range of well-performing engagement tools such as tournaments and promotions.</p>
<p>The offer will feature a number of slots and table games and it will largely build its offer based on the products developed for the RKings operator that Golden Matrix Group runs in the United Kingdom. The Group is also going to offer content in both Spanish and English as it understands the needs of the local market and potential of future growth.</p>
<p>Commenting on this upcoming launch, Golden Matrix CEO Brian Goodman welcomed the opportunity to expand in yet another market. Goodman touted the company’s success with RKings, citing an impressive revenue margin. He shared that the company expected MEXPLAY to bring similar results around.</p>
<p>"While MEXPLAY offers many traditional and popular online casino games and a sportsbook, it also incorporates the added excitement of the tournament business, which is unique to Mexican gaming and should attract considerable player interest and participation," the executive concluded.</p>
<p>MEXPLAY is an important step forward for Golden Matrix Group which is moving confidently into the Latin American region. Latin America is said to be one of the markets that is going to be big for iGaming. Presently, iGaming has been moving at a good pace in other regional markets, such as the United States and Ontario.</p>
<p>The incentive of going into iGaming is that it’s usually associated with a much better overall gross gaming revenue compared to sports betting. The downside is that there is often a strong opposition to online casinos in some jurisdictions. Luckily, though, Mexico is happy to forge ahead with a vibrant and regulated iGaming ecosystem which allows Golden Matrix Group to considerably grow its footprint in the region.</p>
<p>MEXPLAY is not the only company expanding into both Spanish and English, however. Jefebet, Fifth Street Gaming’s betting and gaming brand, is also targeting Hispanic and Latino audiences in the United States, for example.</p>
