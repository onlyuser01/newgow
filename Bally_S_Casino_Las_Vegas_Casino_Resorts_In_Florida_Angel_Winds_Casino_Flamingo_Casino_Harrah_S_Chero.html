<p>The Moneymaker Tour has announced it will host its first event in 2024 in Texas with the help of a new agreement with Texas Card House in Houston</p>
<p>The poker tournament series that takes place at different locations all across the US, The Moneymaker Tour, has announced a new and exciting partnership with Texas Card House in Houston.</p>
<p>The newly inked deal will allow the Tour which strives to help players “have their own ordinary to extraordinary moments” to host its first scheduled event in 2024 in Texas.</p>
<p>The Lone Star State will, therefore, help the Moneymaker Tour kickstart the new year with 12 days packed with action at the tables, between January 10 and January 22.</p>
<p>Over $500,000 in Prize Money Announced</p>
<p>Texas Card House Houston, which is one of the locations of Texas Card House, the state’s first private poker club, will host no less than 12 trophy events.</p>
<p>The buy-ins will start at $150 and go as high as $1,500. The Moneymaker Tour, which was created by 2003 World Series of Poker Champion and ACR Team Pro, Chris Moneymaker, along with Moneymaker executive manager Tony Burns, has also announced over $500,000 in guarantees across the series.</p>
<p>The Main Event will take place between January 16 – January 22 and will feature a buy-in of $1,500 and a guaranteed prize pool of $250,000. The event’s final table will be streamed live on January 22.</p>
<p>The Moneymaker Tour’s executive manager, Tony Burns, expressed excitement for being able to step into the new year “in a new state with a new partner”.</p>
<p>He also discusses Texas’ transformation into a state that offers “great action” while expressing their eagerness to have their “first-ever stop in Houston” on January 10.</p>
<p>The Partnership, “a Key Highlight” for Texas Cas House</p>
<p>At the same time, Texas Card House’s chief operating officer, Victor Leone, called the new partnership “a key highlight” in their continuous efforts to provide premium experiences for poker players in the state.</p>
<p>Leone added that their community should expect “a dynamic and thrilling tournament series” that will put “high-stakes play and intense competition synonymous with Chris Moneymaker” on full display.</p>
<p>The Moneymaker Tour was inaugurated at the Poker Room at Palm Beach Kennel Club in May 2023 and has been growing in popularity ever since.</p>
<p>Its third series was held at the Hard Rock Casino in Cincinnati a few months ago, in September, and it was the first series to draw a $1 million guaranteed Main Event.</p>
<p>The event gathered 788 participants and was won by Joseph Bakun who took home over $208,000.</p>
