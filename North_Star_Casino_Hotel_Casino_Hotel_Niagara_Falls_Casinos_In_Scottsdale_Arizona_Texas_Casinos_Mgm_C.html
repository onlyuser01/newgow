    <h1>North Star Casino Hotel Casino Hotel Niagara Falls Casinos In Scottsdale Arizona Texas Casinos Mgm C</h1>

<p>I understood, this is beyond your authority access to their internal system and it will never be possible. But I would request you do not reject the complain. This is a licensed casino declined my withdrawal, provided me a system generating log which proved I am being scammed on the wagering requirement. At this stage, I do not want to speculate if this is intentional or a simple glitch as my objective is to get what is lawfully mine, since they broke the T&amp;C on wgering requirement, and the T&amp;C I broke did not allow them to confiscate all my winnings.</p>
<p>It is interesting of their system to have the precision to make all the errors that serves best interest to the casino, their errors seems to be much developed than their system which fails to compute 470x40 = 18800 instead 20072. And this over requirements just precisely include only all the bets that violate 1e. The odd of these errors aligned this way in statistic to be found is just like a player get a one mil. jackpot with 1 dollar bet. It could happen, 99.9999% is not.</p>
<p>T&amp;C is basically fundamental of my life, since they did not have a proper glossary which they should have had, the way of writing similars terms will be established in comparison to each others.</p>
<p>All the T&amp;C related to winnings voided are below. You can see "ALL" and "ANY" were properly used in the events of winnings not to be paid, coincidentally, 1e is the only one without the use of these words, which established not ALL or ANY winnings, but winnings from the specifc bets that breach the term.</p>
<p>1m. If a player is suspected of abusing a free spin promotion or hasnâ€™t wagered the amount of deposit made to receive these free spins at least 3 (three) times (excluding bets made on table games), National Casino management, at its sole discretion, reserves the right to cancel all free spin bonuses and any winnings acquired from them.</p>
<p>2f. Players can request a withdrawal of their deposit prior to meeting the wagering requirements. However, in this case, the bonus and any resulting winnings will be forfeited.</p>
<p>3a. The management of National Casino reserves the right to withhold or seize any bonuses or winnings gained as a result of fraudulent or otherwise unfair practices.</p>
<p>The National Casino management will review all player accounts and classify them at their discretion. In the event a Player is classified as a "bonus hunter" or "bonus abuser", all winnings and bonuses will be voided.</p>
<p>3b. At National Casino it's forbidden to abuse the bonus offers available (customer bonus ratio (deposits : bonuses) is more than 30%). If any such cases come to light, the casino reserves the right to seize any winnings gained as a result of abusing the bonus offers and disable the option of using any bonuses for that account in the future</p>
<p>3c. Minimal risk bets on any games (i.e. betting in proportions on different outcomes on the same hand to create "action" with minimal risk) do not qualify for completing the wagering requirement. Examples of minimal risk bets include betting on red and black simultaneously in Roulette, or betting on player and banker simultaneously in Baccarat. Players found to be adopting these practices risk having their bonus and any resulting winnings confiscated.</p>
<p>3e. The use of bonus funds purely to progress through the bonus stages is prohibited. For example, when a bonus or cash funds are used purely to progress through the bonus stages (e.g. collecting 9 out of 10 coins to reach that bonus feature) and then final stages (e.g. playing to collect the final coin to reach 10 out of 10 coins to reach the bonus feature) completed with cash bets when bonus funds have been forfeited, lost or converted to cash after fulfilling the wagering requirements. All the winnings gained during that play may be considered void.</p>
<p>Now look at 1e.</p>
<p>1e. The maximum bet with an active bonus is 5 EUR / 5 USD / 50 NOK / 6.5 CAD / 6.5 AUD / 6.5 NZD / 20 PLN /125 CZK / 600 JPY / 30 BRL / 25 MYR. (Unless stated otherwise in special terms for the bonus). Purchasing any game features (including but not limited to respins) will add to your bet amount. If the player exceeds the maximum bet when the bonus is active, National Casino reserves the right to confiscate the winnings.</p>
