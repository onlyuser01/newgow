    <h1>Online Casino Usa No Deposit Bonus Zia Park Casino Casinos Palm Springs Ts Casino What Is Casino GGP</h1>

<p>GGPoker, the world’s biggest poker room, announced notable updates to the Super Million$ events. These include the introduction of a leaderboard that will make it easier for top players to track their performance.</p>
<p>GGPoker Enhances Super Million$ with a Leaderboard</p>
<p>Super Million$ is a series of weekly events where high-rollers, professional and amateur alike, can play for exciting prizes. The regularity of these tournaments is something that has proven to be popular among fans and, as a result, GGPoker wants to take things a step further.</p>
<p>Starting this year, the company will incorporate a new leaderboard into its usual events, allowing the best players to track their performance relative to their competitors’ scores. The so-called SuperRanking leaderboard will rank players based on their pure win/loss earnings from Super Million$ tournaments.</p>
<p>The leaderboard will display the current Superrank of the top 20 poker players and will provide them with various benefits. Although the full extent of the benefits will be revealed throughout 2023, GGPoker teased that top players will get Super Platinum Level, which is a part of the Fish Buffet program and will provide players with 100% cashback in future events.</p>
<p>The best players will also get a special avatar they can use to display their status.</p>
<p>The Poker Room Made Additional Announcements</p>
<p>GGPoker used the opportunity to also talk about other planned additions and improvements. The poker room unveiled new satellite tournaments with $10 buy-in options. These will serve as brand new ways to qualify for the main Super Million$ events.</p>
<p>The first such event is scheduled to take place on January 29 this year. The best players are guaranteed to win one of ten $10,300 Super Million$ tickets, allowing them to play on a bigger stage.</p>
<p>Additionally, GGPoker expanded its global presence once again, penning an agreement with Triton Poker in Vietnam. As a result, the two parties will host a Super Million$ tournament at the Hoiana Resort in Vietnam.</p>
<p>Bertrand “ElkY” Grospellier, a French poker player serving as GGPoker’s brand ambassador, commented on the new improvements. He noted that the leaderboard will add a lot to the new edition of Super Million$.</p>
<p>This will be the biggest poker competition ever. The winners will be recognized as the best poker players of our era. Bertrand “ElkY” Grospellier</p>
<p>A few days ago, GGPoker obtained a license to launch in the Czech Republic and is now preparing to launch its thrilling poker content and events there. At the beginning of this month, the world’s biggest poker room became the title sponsor of the Dublin Poker Festival.</p>
