<p>The Deal Will Catapult Aviator into the Stratosphere</p>
<p>SPRIBE, which is the company behind the crucially-acclaimed crash game Aviator, was founded in 2018. The company quickly rose to global prominence, currently bolstering agreements with over 2,000 operators. One of its big recent deals saw SPRIBE team up with FSB.</p>
<p>UFC’s senior vice president of global partnerships, Grant Norris-Jones, commented on the new deal, saying that his team is “thrilled to welcome SPRIBE” to the roster of UFC partners. He praised the provider’s engaging titles, highlighting their popularity among UFC fans.</p>
<p>SPRIBE creates the kind of next-gen games that have strong appeal for UFC fans because they offer a unique experience, with exciting features, stunning graphics, and engaging gameplay. We’re excited to help them achieve a broader reach for their brand and their games. Grant Norris-Jones, VP global partnerships, UFC</p>
<p>SPRIBE’s chief commercial officer, Giorgi Tsutskiridze, also shared his thoughts on the matter, saying that this is a significant partnership for his company. As a result of the deal, Aviator, which already exceeds 10 million monthly players, will be “catapulted into the stratosphere.”</p>
<p>Tsutskiridze praised the UFC for its commitment to entertainment, saying that this is the start of a “strong and valuable marketing partnership.”</p>
<p>UFC is an entertainment business at heart and knows exactly how to get people on the edge of their seats by providing fast-paced action inside the Octagon. Aviator does that also, but with players able to enjoy the thrill ride of the games from their smartphone. Giorgi Tsutskiridze, CCO, SPRIBE</p>
<p>In other news, SPRIBE just signed a major deal with Light &amp; Wonder, foraying into the lucrative US market.</p>
