<p>Leading gaming technology supplier of products and services to iGaming operators Gaming Innovation Group (GiG) announced today its agreement for the provision of marketing compliance services with Bet365 has been renewed.</p>
<p>Affiliate Marketing Compliance</p>
<p>GiG Comply, the self-serve marketing compliance tool of GiG which scans content hosted on thousands of websites across multiple jurisdictions looking for iGaming code red words, will continue to ensure Bet365 is compliant with regulations with regards to its affiliates.</p>
<p>“As one of leaders in the industry, it makes us extremely proud that bet365 have decided to continue their relationship with GiG. We look forward to continuing to support them with their marketing compliance efforts and in creating a safer, responsible gaming environment together.” Jonas Warrer, Managing Director,Media, GiG</p>
<p>GiG and Bet365 initially signed the deal in 2019, making the sports betting and iGaming operator one of the first tier-1 betting company to deploy the tools and safeguards for compliance provided by GiG.</p>
<p>In February last year, the Stockholm-listed GiG and Stoke-based Bet365 renewed the deal, following on the first year integration, to allow the operator to deploy GiG Comply provisions across all of its present markets in Europe and the US.</p>
<p>The Successful Partnership Continues</p>
<p>The renewed agreement now will continue to empower Bet365 to monitor its brand affiliates by leveraging bespoke compliance checks related to both legislation and advertising standards specific for each jurisdiction.</p>
<p>“We look forward to another successful year working with GiG Comply. The versatility of the tool means that we can effectively adapt to the ever-changing regulatory landscape ensuring we maintain a highly compliant affiliate programme.” Spokesperson, Bet365</p>
<p>GiG Comply will ensure Bet365 remains at the forefront of regulations and requirements for responsible gaming and maintains a proactive approach in terms of the control it exerts on affiliate marketing.</p>
<p>The issue of affiliate marketing compliance is under scrutiny from regulators, keen to oust some advertising practices targeting vulnerable people and people at risk of developing gambling addictions, by placing the responsibility for advertising partners on online gaming operators.</p>
<p>Last year, GiG entered into some high-profile deals related to its affiliate marketing solution GiG Comply. In February, the technology solutions company teamed with PokerStars to offer the operator safety amid growing regulatory pressure and last-minute changes to gambling requirements worldwide.</p>
<p>By the end of the year, Leo Vegas signed a deal with the software supplier to utilize the GiG Comply tool and enhance its affiliate marketing compliance. Also in December, back-end solutions provider Roots Limited teamed with GiG to boost its compliance.</p>
