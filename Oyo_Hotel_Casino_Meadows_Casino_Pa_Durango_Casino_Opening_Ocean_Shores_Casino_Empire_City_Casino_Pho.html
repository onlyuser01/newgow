    <h1>Oyo Hotel Casino Meadows Casino Pa Durango Casino Opening Ocean Shores Casino Empire City Casino Pho</h1>

<p>Last month, the 2018-launched innovative sportsbook supplier that offers state-of-the-art solutions, BETBY, reiterated its plans to expand globally via a newly opened office in Barcelona.</p>
<p>Now, we learn that BETBY has celebrated its fifth anniversary “by giving back” to its staff members as well as the wider community-based in Riga, Latvia, where the operator is known for having a strong presence.</p>
<p>“Fitting Way” to Mark the Big Event</p>
<p>According to the company’s chief executive officer, Leonid Pertsovskiy, BETBY has found a “fitting way to mark this occasion” by further advancing its corporate social responsibility with the help of a charity fundraiser directed toward Common Ground.</p>
<p>Common Ground is a community center in the Latvian capital city that was created a few months ago, in April, with help from Riga’s City Council. Its main goal is to serve as an assistance center for Ukrainian refugees, alongside Russian and Belorussian opposition members, in need of relocating solutions because of the ongoing war.</p>
<p>At the end of May 2023, BETBY announced its plans to launch a fresh Corporate Social Responsibility Project aimed at improving its sustainability ethos, with the Common Ground community center at the core of its plans.</p>
<p>Pertsovskiy also took the opportunity to express the company’s pride for being able to put people first while emphasizing the importance of having a “talented and dedicated staff” by its side that has helped the business go “from strength to strength” and reach its currently advantageous, high-ranking position.</p>
<p>Online Talks, Charity Auction, and Trophy for Staff Members</p>
<p>The sportsbook supplier also organized a charity auction for members of the organization, with prizes ranging from a speedboat trip with chief commercial officer Chris Nikolopoulos as well as a wine-tasting experience with chief operating officer Eva Berkova.</p>
<p>BETBY also celebrated its five-year anniversary by organizing a number of online meetings and talks with staff representatives and executive team members. The list of speakers also included CEO Pertsovskiy, who answered a series of questions regarding the future direction of the company.</p>
<p>Staff members who have been in the company throughout the entire five-year journey were rewarded with a trophy as a means of thanking them for their support and services as well as to reinforce BETBY’s goal of always putting people first.</p>
<p>In August, NuxGame and BETBY announced an important partnership that would allow the former to offer the sportsbook supplier’s leading proprietary sportsbook solutions to its customers.</p>
