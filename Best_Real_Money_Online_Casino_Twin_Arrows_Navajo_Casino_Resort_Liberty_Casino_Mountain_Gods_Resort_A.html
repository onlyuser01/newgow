<p>Leadstar Media will launch its affiliate websites in Michigan after securing the necessary approvals from the state regulator</p>
<p>Leadstar Media, a sports betting affiliate focused on creating products tailored to punters’ needs, has received two gaming licenses in Michigan. Thanks to that, it will now be able to provide its sports betting and iGaming expertise to people in the state.</p>
<p>Leadstar Media Secures Michigan Licenses</p>
<p>The local regulator provided Leadstar Media with a sports betting supplier license and an internet gaming supplier license, allowing it to promote its products locally. As a result, the company will now be able to enter the Great Lakes State with its affiliate brands.</p>
<p>Leadstar will use the opportunity to market Sportsbooksonline.com and Unitedgamblers.com in the state, channeling more betting enthusiasts toward its platforms. By using any of the two sites, gambling and sports betting fans can quickly find information about the best casinos and sportsbooks around. The affiliate offers detailed information about promotions and welcome offers, helping gamblers navigate the industry and find the best operators.</p>
<p>Leadstar Media believes itself to be poised to benefit from its new licenses. The company is backed by a team of gambling specialists who understand what kind of content people like. Using the affiliate’s platforms is a valuable tool for finding the exact kind of gaming experience one is looking for.</p>
<p>Leadstar Seeks to Replicate Its Usual Success in Michigan</p>
<p>Eskil Kvarnström, Leadstar Media’s chief executive officer, commented on the new licenses, sharing his company’s passion to expand its US reach. He said that Leadstar Media is very excited to launch its affiliate business in Michigan, providing local bettors with valuable details about the industry.</p>
<p>At the same time, the new licenses will allow the affiliate to generate even more value for its partners. Kvarnström is convinced that the expansion into Michigan will benefit his company a great deal.</p>
<p>The CEO concluded that Leadstar Media already has the necessary experience in guiding people to the right operators and said that he is certain the affiliate will be able to replicate this success in Michigan.</p>
<p>Our team is dedicated to providing the best products for our visitors and in turn helping them to find the right operator. We have achieved this in other markets and are confident that we can replicate that success in Michigan as well. Eskil Kvarnström, CEO, Leadstar Media</p>
<p>Leadstar Media is a globally-operating brand that already has a presence in many regulated markets, with thousands of people using its websites. Because of that, the company recently launched a website in Spanish, seeking to provide Hispanic people across North America with the most relevant casino and sportsbook information.</p>
