<p>Global supplier of gaming technology Aspire Global announced its B2B sportsbook and technology provider BtoBet entered into a deal with BestBet24 to power the sports betting operator with its Neuron 3 platform and enter the Polish market.</p>
<p>Expanding into New Markets</p>
<p>The partnership agreed between BtoBet and BestBet24 covers both the online and retail sports betting channels of the Warsaw-based operator, which will feature an extensive network of more than 80 retail shops that will operate alongside its online and mobile sports betting offering in Poland.</p>
<p>This significant deal is yet another step in our growth strategy to expand into new regulated markets. We have once again demonstrated that BtoBet and our own proprietary sportsbook opens up for numerous growth opportunities in regulated markets with both existing and new customers.” Tsachi Maimon, CEO, Aspire Global</p>
<p>Besides the Neuron 3 sportsbook platform, BtoBet will provide BestBet24’s sports betting offering with an interconnected omnichannel environment to offer its Polish players a unique betting experience. BtoBet’s dedicated risk management system is also part of the agreement with BetBet24.</p>
<p>The Missing Piece of Aspire’s Puzzle</p>
<p>BtoBet was acquired by Aspire Global in October 2020 for a cash-only deal worth €20 million ($23 million). €15 million ($17.3 million) was paid at the close of the transaction, and the remaining €5 million ($5.8 million) was due last month. There is also a provision for further cash consideration two years after the transaction close, subject to the achievement of performance goals.</p>
<p>By the time of the transaction, Aspire Global hailed the newly acquired sportsbook and technology supplier as a “major step in creating an offering that covers the main elements of the B2B iGaming value chain,” allowing the group to “control the intellectual property in the full value chain,” steer the “complete roadmap” while giving flexibility to “adding new features and securing fast time to market.”</p>
<p>Provider of B2B award-winning solutions for the iGaming industry BtoBet has a significant footprint across regulated gaming jurisdictions in Europe, Latin America and Africa, while its sportsbook Neuron platform based on an advanced artificial intelligence solution allows for a high level of brand customization, making it enticing to operators.</p>
<p>Online gambling in Poland is regulated by the Gambling Law 2009, which was amended in December 2016 and the amendment was made official on April 1, 2017. Under the regulation, online sports betting is subject to official licensing, while casino-style games can be offered only by the state-owned Totalizator Sportowy.</p>
<p>Online poker is illegal in the country as poker is confined to land-based venues only. Annual gross gaming revenue from sports betting in Poland is currently around $600 million.</p>
