<p>Not even a week after the game's billion-dollar jackpot was won in Florida, another lucky player secured a jackpot prize</p>
<p>Mega Millions is one of the most popular lottery games in the United States. Tickets for the game are sold in 45 states, as well as the US Virgin Islands and Washington DC and drawings take place on Tuesdays and Fridays.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the highest jackpot from Mega Millions, a staggering $1.6 billion was won in Florida from the drawing on August 8, 2023. Now, in less than a week after the whopping billion-dollar jackpot was won, another Florida resident hit the jackpot of the game.</p>
<p>The lucky lottery player guessed correctly all white balls, 18, 39, 42, 57, 63 and the Mega Ball, 7, from the drawing on Tuesday, August 15, 2023. As a result, the lucky player secured an estimated jackpot of $36 million or $18.6 million in cash. While that’s far from the mouth-watering billion-dollar win from last week, undoubtedly, $36 million is a life-changing sum.</p>
<p>The winning ticket of the latest Mega Millions jackpot was sold at Publix, located at 4495 Roosevelt Boulevard in Jacksonville, Florida. By selling the winning ticket, the lottery retailer received a $25,000 commission bonus, the lottery reveals.</p>
<p>There were more than 550,000 winning tickets within all prize tiers from the latest Mega Millions drawing. One lucky winner from New Jersey guessed correctly all white balls and secured a second-tier prize of $1 million. On the other hand, 10 winners guessed correctly the four white balls and the Mega Ball. Nine of them collected a $10,000 prize each, while one paid an extra $1 for a Megaplier, which resulted in a $30,000 prize.</p>
<p>Some 282 lucky lottery players guessed correctly four of the white balls from the Tuesday drawing. While the majority of those winners collected a $500 prize each, 58 of them paid an extra $1 for the Megaplier which granted them a $1,500 prize each.</p>
<p>The Game’s Jackpot Goes Back to $20M</p>
<p>The recent jackpots hit in Florida come after two jackpots dropped in New York state back in April. At the beginning of the month, on April 14, 2023, a lucky lottery player from New York hit the $483 million jackpot. Then, days later, on April 18, 2023, another lucky New York state resident hit the $20 million grand prize from Mega Millions.</p>
<p>Considering the latest win from Florida, the game’s jackpot was once again reset to $20 million or an estimated $9.6 million if the cash option is selected. The next Mega Millions drawing is set for Friday, August 18, 2023, at 11 PM ET.</p>
