<p>Week 9 of the 2022 NFL season is just around the corner, and the Philadelphia Eagles are still unbeaten. In fact, the Birds from Philly are the only team in the entire league that still has a 100% record.</p>
<p>The best thing for Philly’s fans is that their superb run probably isn’t going to end anytime soon. It’s because their schedule looks relatively easy in the next couple of weeks, starting with the Week 9 game against the Houston Texans.</p>
<p>This could be their easiest so far in the 2022 season, as evident from the fact that oddsmakers are giving extremely short odds on Nick Sirianni’s boys.</p>

<p>Philadelphia Eagles to Stay Undefeated for a While Longer</p>
<p>The Eagles are 7-0 in the season, and it’s very likely they will get to their right win of the year on Thursday Night. It’s not just that they’re superb in 2022; it’s also that they got a fantastic record against the Houston Texans. The two have met only five times so far, with the Eagles winning each time.</p>
<p>Their most recent game took place in 2018 when most of Philly’s key men of 2022 weren’t on the roster. Actually, the core of Sirianni’s team is made up of youngsters with no more than a couple of years of experience in the NFL – QB Jalen Hurts (third year), WR DeVonta Smith (second year), and so on.</p>
<p>Sure, they also got some way more experienced players, like CB Darius Slay and C Jason Kelce. On top of that, since the summer, they also got WR A. J. Brown on the roster. He’s still relatively young (25 years), but he’s got plenty of experience playing at the top level (55 NFL games played so far).</p>
<p>It took him a while to click with his new team, but in Week 8, he put on a vintage performance against the Pittsburgh Steelers, finishing with six catches for 156 receiving yards and 3 touchdowns.</p>
<p>Houston Texans Might be the Worst Team in the League</p>
<p>The Texans are sitting at the very bottom of the Conference table with a 1-5-1 record. Their only win happened against the Jacksonville Jaguars four weeks ago. They also played a tie with the Indianapolis Colts, but that too isn’t something one should be proud of, considering how out-of-shape the Colts have been in 2022.</p>
<p>It’s hard to point out one single reason why the Texans are bad in 2022. In fact, it seems that they’re disastrous in all aspects of the game. Their offense just isn’t productive this season, scoring no more than two TDs in just one game of the 2022 season. Their defense has been equally disappointing, with 22.0 points conceded per game.</p>
<p>Philadelphia Eagles vs Houston Texans Week 9 Prediction</p>
<p>The Eagles are coming to Lone Star State to get a win. They’re going to win and they’re going to win big. The spread is set to 13 points, which does seem a lot, but we think Sirianni’s men will pull it off.</p>
<p>Picks: Philadelphia Eagles to win and cover the spread; under to hit.</p>
