<p>Pariplay, a NeoGames company, has long made its intentions about the Latin American online gambling market known. The company which aggregates and develops its own games, has secured a new market entry into the iGaming market in Panama by obtaining an approval to supply its products.</p>
<p>The permit has been issued by the Gaming Control Board of the country and it reflects on Pariplay’s own global reputation and ability to penetrate strategic jurisdictions. Pariplay’s entry into the market is not random either. The bespoke Fusionplatform is a powerful aggregation unit that has been able to collect 14,000 titles from more than 80 providers.</p>
<p>This will make it possible for local operators in Panama to gain access to distinct slots, instant, live casino games, and other products, such as poker, bingo and even virtual sports, the press release stated. This is not Pariplay’s first foray into the Latin American market either. The company has been building up its presence methodically over the past years.</p>
<p>Pariplay entry into Mexico and Colombia was emboldened by strong results in the local iGaming markets, it sought to expand beyond that to the City of Buenos Aires, Argentina. Pariplay Managing Director Adrian Bailey welcomed this opportunity and the significance of the partnership for the company.</p>
<p>Bailey confirmed that Pariplay will remain a confident player locally and inject state-of-the-art products into local markets where the company is regulated and allowed to operate. Pariplay’s immediate priorities include the introduction of more slot games that appeal to local players and drive results for operators and partners across the country and the region in general.</p>
<p>Pariplay Director for Latin America and the Caribbean Jorge L. Morales was also pleased with the development and said that Panama is the latest important jurisdiction to have trusted company’s products and offering. "It is an exciting time for us as we have ambitious plans for Panama, and I look forward to working together with local operators to offer our games to their customers," L Morales concluded.</p>
<p>Pariplay’s global ambitions do not stop in Latin America, however. The company recently hired Doina Stefanescu as VP of Delivery with the executive just one of many experts committed to expanding the company’s footprint and reach in new markets. North America remains another important opportunity for Pariplay and its product offering, with markets such as New Jersey and Pennsylvania already accessible to the company.</p>
