<p>BetMakers Technology Group’s subsidiary Global Racing Network has signed a deal extending the company the rights to broadcast content from Selangor Turf Club, a Malaysia thoroughbred racing venue.</p>
<p>BetMakers Accesses Selangor Turf Club Content for UK and Irish Markets</p>
<p>The content is distributed for fixed odds, booked bets, and various exchanges in both the United Kingdom and Ireland. Commenting on this partnership, VP of Global Racing Network Kerry Gatten said that the addition of content by Selangor Turf Club will play an important part in the company’s product offering and also help boost the visibility of the events that take place at the venue.</p>
<p>It’s also an opportunity for Global Racing Network to achieve growth in new markets, Gatten added and explained:</p>
<p>To deliver this, we are not only building the network between Selangor Turf Club and the wagering operators, but we are also supplying the data and tools they can use to stimulate wagering and drive revenue. We are very excited about their prospects in these markets and happy to be working with them. VP of Global Racing Network Kerry Gatten</p>
<p>BetMakers is also becoming a sponsor of Selangor Turf Club racing and will launch the namesake BetMakers Cup on December 4. Selangor Turf Club CEO Mike Fong added that the racetrack was similarly pleased to be teaming up with the BetMakers company. It’s a great opportunity for the racetrack to expand its offer into the UK and Ireland, he noted.</p>
<p>An Opportunity to Expand Global Reach for Both Companies</p>
<p>“We look forward to working with BetMakers to help ensure the growth and sustainability of racing in Malaysia,” Fong concluded. The partnership was also welcomed BetMakers’ global tote international operations manager and director of sales &amp; business development in Asia, Lance Ku, who said that the opportunity to work with Selangor Turf Club was an exciting one that would allow BetMakers to further expand its international reach and build upon its strong relationship with local racetracks.</p>
<p>Ku noted that BetMakers is also looking to further develop its portfolio with a pool of clients in Macau, Hong Kong, Vietnam, and Malaysia, among others. BetMakers delivers a full suite of technology and service solutions to numerous racing bodies and operators, all with the goal of delivering excellent betting content to punters. BetMakers previously signed a distribution deal with VTRIMP and a similar partnership with Penn National Gaming</p>
