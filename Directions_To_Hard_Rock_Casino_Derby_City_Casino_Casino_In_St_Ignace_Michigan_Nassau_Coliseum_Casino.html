<p>The Celtics managed a resounding victory in Game 1</p>
<p>Giannis got completely locked down by Horford</p>
<p>Brogdon will also miss Game 2 against the Bucks</p>
<p>The Boston Celtics will play against the Milwaukee Bucks in Game 2 of the 2019 NBA Semifinals. The game is taking place at Fiserv Forum, Milwaukee, WI on Tuesday, April 30. After a first victory in the series, the Celtics are coming into Game 2 more composed than their opponents.</p>
<p>Game 2: 2019 NBA Semifinals: Bucks vs Celtics</p>
<p>In Game 1, the Boston Celtics managed to build a quick advantage over the Milwaukee Bucks, locking down their top man, Giannis Antetokounmpo, one of the NBA’s most talented players. Leaving the hard work to AI Horford, the Celtics successfully negated the otherwise strong game of Giannis.</p>
<p>The upcoming game will be a chance for the Bucks to rebound, but to do so, they will have to figure out a way to allow Giannis to play to his fullest potential. Even pressed, Giannis managed to score 22 points for his team – not a bad performance after all.</p>
<p>With this in mind, the Bucks will be doing their best on Tuesday, April 30 when they will host the Celtics at the Fiserv Forum, Milwaukee, WI for yet another clash.</p>

<p>The Stats for the Bucks vs Celtics, Game 2, 2019 NBA Semifinals</p>
<p>Here’s a quick overview of the date, time and place of the event as well as the channels you can watch it on:</p>
<p>Date/Time : Monday, April 29 – 8 PM</p>
<p>: Monday, April 29 – 8 PM Location : Scotibank Arena, Toronto, Ontario, Canada</p>
<p>: Scotibank Arena, Toronto, Ontario, Canada TV Channel : ESPN, ABC, TNT, NBA TV</p>
<p>: ESPN, ABC, TNT, NBA TV Moneyline : Boston (+250)/Celtics (-300)</p>
<p>: Boston (+250)/Celtics (-300) Spread: Boston +7½ (-115)/ -7½ (-105)</p>
<p>Boston +7½ (-115)/ -7½ (-105) Under/over: Boston Over 219 (-110)/Under 219 (-110)</p>
<p>Game 2: Giannis in a Corner</p>
<p>Giannis will have to wriggle himself out of Horford’s grasp. This won’t be easy given that Horford’s sole purpose in Game 2 will most likely be to keep him away from the basket and cancel out his three-point shots.</p>
<p>Giannis does know how to play under pressure and having been locked down once, he will know what to expect and how to adapt, wasting no time on devising a strategy on the go.</p>
<p>It’s in fact the Celtics who will be going blind into Game 2 and the Bucks who will have to set the pace for the entire game throughout.</p>
<p>Giannis is contesting this year’s MVP Award, which means that even if the Celtics had caught him off his guard, this cannot last much longer.</p>
<p>Malcom Brogdon – No Show for Game 2</p>
<p>With Brogdon still missing, the Bucks will need to handle Horford and Irving. This means that the Bucks will have to rely on players, such as Lopez, Middleton, and of course Giannis to pick up the slack and make that break in Game 2 the team will need to restore its moral.</p>
<p>Coming under a lot of criticism during the playoffs for lacking courage, the Bucks stand a chance to turn the game around on Tuesday, April 30.</p>
