    <h1>Aurora Casino Hollywood Casino Tampa Fl Hotels Near Soaring Eagle Casino Michigan Casino Inn Casino</h1>

<p>Hello Daniel</p>
<p>Thank you first for being interested in the case.</p>
<p>First register the account as it should be and received the ok from the CBET house</p>
<p>Then I made a deposit of 100, I played two bets of 50 (if 50 is a high limit, seriously, let's close the house)</p>
<p>Then I deposited 100 again because my intention is always to continue playing and I had no more balance (if I did not want to, I would not make a deposit, incredible that I have to explain it like that but the cbet house and its behavior forces me)</p>
<p>When I want these last 100 usd, the limitation poster already appears</p>
<p>So like any human being, I came to the conclusion that they were not going to let me play anymore</p>
<p>So I try to get my money, the 200 and the profits and they won't let me</p>
<p>I speak by chat and they tell me, please, play 100 more to be able to withdraw</p>
<p>I said, perfect, no problem, I try again, and it won't let me !! .... I go to major leagues, italy, germany, spain, england .... and it won't let me !!</p>
<p>So what is the output I have? leave the money there and I lose out?</p>
<p>It's a shame what CBet is doing !!</p>
<p>I hope you contact me immediately to solve this problem</p>
<p>And hopefully from here they can give me a hand</p>
<p>From now on, very grateful !!</p>
<p>Greetings</p>
