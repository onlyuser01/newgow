<p>A man was arrested after allegedly setting off explosions on Sunday in the Milwaukee, Wis. Potawatomi Hotel &amp; Casino parking garage.</p>
<p>Dennis Beard, 48, of New Berlin, Wis., was charged with two counts of possession of improvised explosives, according to Wisconsin TV station WITI. The explosive devices were bottles filled with muriatic acid, the report said.</p>
