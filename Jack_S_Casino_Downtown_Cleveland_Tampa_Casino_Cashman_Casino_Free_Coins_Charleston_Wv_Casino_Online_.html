<p>The digital media products and services provider, Checkd Group, announced its entry into the regulated sports wagering market in Ontario, Canada.</p>
<p>Checkd Group Announces Ontario Market Entry</p>
<p>The company’s entry into the most-populous province in Canada comes after it gained a license from the gambling regulator, the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario (AGCO). Upon gaining an affiliate license in the province, Checkd Group entered the market along with its popular brand FlashPicks. Thanks to this, now sport bettors in the province can leverage FlashPicks’ leading data. What’s more, the market entry comes just in time for the action-packed sports season that starts with the new NFL season. According to Checkd Group, to enter the regulated market in the province it completed multiple market requirements. Ultimately, the company met the requirements and is now among a growing portfolio of licensed operators.</p>
<p>“The new license means that sports bettors in Ontario can utilize operator links on Checkd Group’s fast-growing sports betting community site FlashPicks, along with their counterparts in 15 US states where online betting is currently regulated,“ reads a statement released by Checkd Group</p>
<p>FlashPicks is Checkd Group’s fast-growing brand that launched earlier this year. Since its launch, the North American-focused website offers sports fans content via audio and digital channels. Its audience has been continuously growing and by now it has hit 30 million organic Twitter impressions. On the other hand, 250,000 unique online users visited FlashPicks’ website. The website’s new headline show “For Bettor or Worse” boosted further its popularity by hitting 500,000 views via audio and video channels.</p>
<p>The Company Appointed a New Head of US Operations</p>
<p>Besides its entry into the regulated market in Ontario, Checkd Group also unveiled a senior appointment. The company selected Callum Broxton to serve as its head of US operations. Before this position, Broxton was a part of the company’s Media division where he held leadership roles such as head of social, head of brand operations as well as commercial manager. In his new full-time position as head of US operations, Broxton will be based in New York.</p>
<p>“Ontario is an important sports betting market and one where there is a high bar in terms of meeting regulatory requirements.” Callum Broxton, head of US operations at Checkd Group</p>
<p>Sharing his excitement, Broxton said that achieving a license in Ontario represents a major milestone for the company. Moreover, he acknowledged that the licensing complements the success of FlashPicks in the US since its launch earlier this year. “We have been working hard to increase the range of experts that we can utilize to help inform and educate FlashPicks’ rapidly growing community and it is gratifying to be able to serve sports enthusiasts right across North America ahead of what is sure to be an exciting NFL season,” explained Broxton.</p>
<p>He revealed that the sports betting market in Ontario is important and acknowledged that the company had to meet multiple regulatory requirements. Broxton outlined that the company will now focus on offering the best stats and information that will enable bettors to complete informed picks. Last but not least, he said that it is exciting to spearhead Checkd’s international operations.</p>
