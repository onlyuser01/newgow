<p>Multiple UK charities are the recipients of a new donation after sportsbooks gave away their profits raised from the Britannia Stakes win at the flagship race Royal Ascot last week. Overall, a share of £1.2m ($1.5m) donation will be distributed to Ascot Racecourse Supports Community Fund, The Ivors Academy Trust and Cotswold Riding for the Disabled, as well as ABF The Soldiers' Charity and Sue Ryder.</p>
<p>The huge donation to charities comes from Betting and Gaming Council (BGC) members that includes William Hill, bet365, Entain (Ladbrokes and Coral), as well as Flutter (Paddy Power, Sky Bet, Betfair).
