<p>The rock band’s front man has apparently made the decision to move out of state with his wife and three sons, and is asking $4.95 million, which would be almost a million more than he paid for it in 2010.</p>
<p>They had lived in the 8,299-square-foot, Spanish–style compound for seven years and spent $2.5 million renovating it.</p>
<p>It features six bedrooms, seven bathrooms, and 2 half-baths.</p>
<p>The main residence includes a fitness studio, an updated open kitchen, and a staircase imported from Belgium.</p>
<p>Outside is a swimming pool and private well, which provides water to the mature trees that surround the property.</p>
<p>Realtor, Zar Zanganeh is representing the seller and told the Las Vegas Review Journal that the house is in an area that is both historic and coveted.</p>
<p>“It is magnificent,” Zanganeh said. “I’ve sold a couple thousand houses in my career, and this is one of my absolute favorites.”</p>
<p>Hughes’ Historic Home</p>
<p>The filmmaker and businessman, notoriously a recluse built the house in 1961 because of its secluded neighborhood northwest of the Strip.</p>
<p>It was one of three houses Hughes had before he moved to the city and never lived in it, choosing instead to reside on the top floor of the Desert Inn.</p>
<p>The residence has had other famous people occupy it. Jan Jones, the first woman mayor of Las Vegas, lived there with her then-husband, Fletcher Jones, owner of several high-end car dealerships.</p>
<p>Developer Irwin Molasky and then Robert Frey, founder of Pure Management Group, which owns several bars and nightclubs on the Strip.</p>
<p>Tennis great Andre Agassi and wife, Steffi Graf lived in the house as well.</p>
<p>Hot Spot for Celebrities</p>
<p>With the real estate market improving in Vegas, stars that have resided here are making the move to buy and sell property.</p>
<p>Penn Jillette, who is half of the famous magician duo of Penn and Teller, sold his longtime Las Vegas home for $1.88 million in November.</p>
<p>It took nearly two years, but Zak Bagans, host of the Travel Channel’s paranormal reality show Ghost Adventures, finally found a buyer for his 5,822-square-foot luxury home in Las Vegas in January for $2.2 million.</p>
<p>The last place pop icon, Michael Jackson ever lived in was placed for sale in June for $9.5 million and has yet to be bought.</p>
