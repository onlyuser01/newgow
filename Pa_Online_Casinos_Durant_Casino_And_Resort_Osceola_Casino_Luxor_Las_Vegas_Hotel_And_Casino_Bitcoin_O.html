<p>Hi Dan,</p>
<p>We are sorry to hear you are unhappy with the information you have been provided, please rest assured training and feedback will be provided where required.</p>
<p>In order to discuss the account we do need to obtain security, this is done by asking questions relating to the account that only the account holder would know. If security has not been passed we are unable to provide account specific information.</p>
<p>In regards to GAMSTOP, every time you log into your casino account, we attempt to match your details against the GAMSTOP database to detect whether you have set up a self-exclusion with them. After reviewing your account we can confirm that the details that you have provided do not match what you have registered to your casino account.</p>
<p>GAMSTOP asks you to provide your first name, surname, date of birth, postcode and your email address upon your exclusion. When we successfully match 4 out of 5 of these details between your casino account and GAMSTOP then the exclusion will take effect.</p>
<p>We are sorry to say that as 4 out of 5 of these details did not match what you had entered when you registered the account with us, the exclusion did not take effect. The two fields that did not match were Surname and date of birth. If you would like we can provide specifics on the information you entered.</p>
<p>We would encourage you to check your details against other casinos you may have registered with in order to ensure the GAMSTOP exclusion is effective.</p>
<p>We also recommend that you self-exclude from all other betting and gaming sites. If you feel you have a gambling problem or require any further assistance you may wish to consider contacting one of the below organisations:</p>
<p>• GamCare (www.gamcare.org.uk) is the leading national provider of information, advice, support and free counselling for the prevention and treatment of problem gambling. Their expert services are confidential and non-judgemental. You can speak to an adviser on Freephone 0808 8020 133, 8am to midnight, seven days a week.</p>
<p>• Gamblers Anonymous (www.gamblersanonymous.org.uk) provides a twelve-step program for people who feel they may have a gambling problem.</p>
<p>• BeGambleAware (www.begambleaware.org) offers advice and sources to access free, confidential help by phone or online. They provide practical information on how to gamble responsibly and tips on how to stay in control.</p>
<p>• Industry Group for Responsible Gambling (igrg.org.uk/wp/self-exclusion) provides information on how you can expand your self-exclusion request to other operators and other types of gambling.</p>
<p>May we also advise that you "unfriend" or "unfollow" us on Facebook or Twitter, should you currently subscribe, so that you do not receive any marketing material via social media. Due to the nature of social media, we are, unfortunately, not able to otherwise block you from receiving these messages.</p>

<p>• Gamblock - blocks access to online gambling</p>
