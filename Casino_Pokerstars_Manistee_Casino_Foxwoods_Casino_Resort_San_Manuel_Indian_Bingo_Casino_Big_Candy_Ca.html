<p>Disgraced Mohegan Sun Casino Exec Allegedly Rigged Easter Egg Hunt</p>

<p>Robert Pellegrini, the former VP of Player Development at Mohegan Sun Pocono imprisoned last year for fraud and money laundering, is facing an unusual new accusation: tampering with Easter Egg hunts.</p>

<p>In December, the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board (PGCB) hit Mohegan Sun Pocono with an unprecedented $1 million fine, largely for the casino’s failure to follow internal controls, which the regulator believed facilitated the orchestration of a $420,000 scam, masterminded by Pellegrini.</p>
<p>In June 2017, the former executive was sentenced to three years in prison for his role in scamming the casino’s slot machines using bogus loyalty rewards.</p>
<p>Was He Egged On?</p>
<p>This week, felony counts of theft and receiving stolen property, as well as a misdemeanor charge of conspiracy to participate in a rigged contest, were added to the rap sheet. Two co-conspirators, Colin Ray Boecker and Kenneth Rowlands, are facing the same charges.</p>
<p>The Easter egg hunt, or, more accurately, the Easter egg sweepstakes promotion, took place at the casino on April 27, 2014.</p>
<p>The promotion offered customers, selected at random by computer,the chance to pick plastic eggs containing prizes from a basket. But casino employees Boecker and Rowlands fixed it so the both the first and second-place prizes would be won by the same customer, Mark Heltzel, who was in on the scam.</p>
<p>Heltzel later split the $10,000 with his co-conspirators, with Pellegrini receiving $2,000 for turning a blind eye to the scheme.</p>
<p>Loyalty Card Racket</p>
<p>Heltzel was also involved in the bogus loyalty reward operation, for which he received 18 months in prison. This fraud involved Pellegrini recruiting a cocktail waitress, Rochelle Poszeluznyj, to observe and memorize players’ loyalty PIN numbers.</p>
<p>Pellegrini would then make copies of the cards and load them with free slot money, which Heltzel would use to gamble with, splitting the winnings among the group.</p>
<p>The scam netted $420,000 until a dealer at the casino, who was reportedly in love with Poszeluznyj, decided to inform authorities, apparently because he viewed Heltzel as a rival for his affections.</p>
<p>It’s not the only scandal to have hit the Mohegan Sun Pocono in recent years. In February 2017, the casino’s CEO Robert Soper resigned in the midst of a PGCB investigation into allegations that the casino had engaged the services of companies that did not possess required licensing from the state.</p>
<p>Soper was fined $60,000 for his failure to disclose that he had personal business interests in two companies that had been hired by the casino.</p>
