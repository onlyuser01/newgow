    <h1>Casino Mississippi Magic Casino Encore Casino Restaurants Casino Real Money Toppenish Casino Strive</h1>

<p>Strive Gaming has appointed Andrew Holmes as the new chief operating officer. Holmes brings along with him more than 20 years of experience working in various aspects of finance, banking, eCommerce, and B2C gaming, making him a great fit for the company. His “considerable industry knowledge” will be well used by Strive Gaming which will put Holmes to work as he guides the company towards better operational results.</p>
<p>Strive Gaming Brings the Right Person</p>
<p>Holmes has a long and established track record of working at important companies throughout various industries. He was VP of product for TwinSpires, Churchill Down’s interactive gaming division until recently and prior to joining Strive Gaming. Churchill Down though has chosen to refocus its efforts on land-based gaming and entertainment.</p>
<p>Commenting on this appointment, Strive Gaming CEO Max Meltzer welcomed the opportunity to be adding Andrew to the team. He called it a step forward for the company and a distinct advantage as Strive Gaming seeks to consolidate its presence in North America, focusing on B2B real money igaming.</p>
<p>“Andrew’s blend of experience across multiple industries such as gaming and finance – where he has worked on everything from unicorn-large business to small and mid-level business – plus his involvement in product and operations roles at C-level has convinced me he’ll be an ideal fit for this role.” Strive Gaming CEO Max Meltzer</p>
<p>With Ontario in Canada opening for business, Andrews will be busy establishing the company’s footprint in both the United States and Canada. Holmes himself was very pleased with the development. He said that being part of Strive Gaming is the “culmination” of a long time in the industry and that he will be interested in developing the business in both markets targeted by the company.</p>
<p>“It’s an incredibly exciting challenge for me to be joining Strive at such a crucial time for the business, but I believe with the industry experience I can bring to the role, plus the support of such an incredible team, we can achieve our ambitions and make 2022 a truly ground-breaking year for the company.”</p>
<p>Previously, Strive Gaming signed a partnership with Paysafecard and the company has been doubling down on its reach in the US market.</p>
