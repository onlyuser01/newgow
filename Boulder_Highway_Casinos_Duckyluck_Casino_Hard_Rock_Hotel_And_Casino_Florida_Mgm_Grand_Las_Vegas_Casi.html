<p>3 Oaks Gaming, a developer of iGaming content and portfolio, has launched its content and product portfolio offering with Favbet, expanding the company’s reach in European markets. Favbet is currently live in several regulated European markets, including Romania and Ukraine, and is going to use 3 Oaks Gaming content to significantly increase its content proposition and provide players with innovative titles they can explore on their own.</p>
<p>3 Oaks Gaming Continues to Expand Its Reach with Games</p>
<p>Specifically, the company has developed some all-time favorites such as Aztec Fire, Eggs of Gold, and Lotus Charm among others. There will be a regular flow of new games, 3 Oaks Gaming says in a press release, assuring that there are more titles in the pipelines as of right now. Players who are interested in exploring state-of-the-art iGaming titles will have the opportunity to do just that.</p>
<p>3 Oaks holds a strong appeal with individual operators and aggregators, and the company will also grant Favbet access to a number of additional options, such as a tournament network and promotional tools which will lead to better engagement with existing and would-be customers.</p>
<p>Commenting on this launch, 3 Oaks Gaming managing director Sebastian Damian said that Favbet is great news for the company, allowing the content developer to reach even more people. He added:</p>
<p>The recent momentum we’re enjoying shows no sign of slowing down, with several operators across Europe and the rest of the world identifying our content as an effective way to elevate their digital casino offering. 3 Oaks Gaming managing director Sebastian Damian</p>
<p>More Commercial Opportunities Wanted</p>
<p>Damian continued by adding that the company remains on the lookout for more commercial deals that will help 3 Oaks Gaming establish an even bigger footprint and reach. Favbet chief business development officer Serhey Dzekunov also commented on this partnership:</p>
<p>We’ve been hugely impressed with the quality of content that 3 Oaks Gaming provides and believe it complements our overall strategy of building our online casino portal. Favbet chief business development officer Serhey Dzekunov</p>
