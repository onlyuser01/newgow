<p>Playson, a company known as one of the leading suppliers of iGaming market and operating in more than 22 markets with 150+ partners, has expanded its content presence yet again. This time, the company is focusing on the Italian market, where it has strengthened its presence with Vincitu, a respected and trusted local iGaming operator, the company announced on its official website.</p>
<p>Vincitu is considered a local powerhouse, which will allow Playson to rapidly scale its footprint in the country and ensure that its products are accessible to wider audiences. Vincitu will similarly benefit from the content injection as Playson hosts many award-winning and player-favorite games that have already proven their added value in other geos and markets.</p>
<p>Among the games that are coming to Vincitu’s library are top-performing games by Playson such as Lion Gems: Hold and Win, Luxor Gold: Hold and Win, and Book of Gold: Multichance, with the games featuring some of the most authentic and engaging mechanics offered by the company.</p>
<p>The content integration will be facilitated through Exalogic, a gaming account system. Playson and Vincitu have confirmed that more titles will be following over the course of the next months. Playson Account Manager Alessandra Rosati was excited to see her company expand its content reach in yet another market in Europe, and with Vincitu and Italy of all available choices.</p>
<p>The three games that are launching as part of the first wave are select top-performing gems that will help quickly build up Vincitu’s reputation and boost awareness for the Playson brand, Rosati believes.</p>
<p>"These three games are some of our best and we are convinced the operator’s player base will love the variety we have to offer," she said, and added that there will be more auspicious releases throughout 2023 to make to take the partnership with Vincitu to the next level.</p>
<p>Vincitu Casino Manager Francesco Marra was similarly pleased with the opportunity. Marra said that the operator was delighted to host Playson games, touting the products’ quality and underlying tech used to make the games more worthwhile.</p>
<p>"Thanks to the latest innovations, Playson is able to enhance the experience for players day after day, creating a product capable of meeting the highest quality standards," Marra concluded.</p>
<p>Vincitu is a legacy brand in the fast-developing and heavily regulated Italian iGaming market. The company was set up in 2006 and it has quickly become one of the leading casino and sportsbook leaders in the market. It appeals to wide audiences in the Italian market and makes for a perfect partner for the supplier as well.</p>
<p>Playson signed a similar content partnership in Italy with Sisal just in April, with the supplier clearly determined to make its presence in the market felt.</p>
