<p>Sportsbet.io secures multiple-year partnership with Watford</p>
<p>Both the team and cryptocurrency betting agency see synergies</p>
<p>More crypto partnerships enter the Premier League</p>
<p>Cryptocurrency company &amp; betting operator Sportsbet.io has teamed up with Watford for a three-year sponsorship deal to promote its Bitcoin-backed betting project in the Premier League.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrency Betting Agency Sportsbet.io Partners with Watford</p>
<p>Sportsbet.io has signed a “record agreement” with English Premier League team Watford. As a result, Sportsbet.io has become the official T-shirt sponsor of the football club. The bookmaker’s logo will now appear on Watford’s jerseys as well as their training kits as a result of this three-year agreement valid until 2022.</p>
<p>In addition, the company’s logo will also appear on various surfaces inside Watford’s home stadium at Vicarage Road. The deal was well-met by Watford Head of Global Strategy and Partnerships Spencer Field who had the following to say in an official press release:</p>
<p>Our desire to increase our global reach while continuing to make our fans proud by doing things differently in the Watford way is fully supported by Sportsbet.io.</p>
<p>Mr. Field added that Watford was thrilled to partner with a betting agency which was committed to disrupting the industry and creating a fun experience for its users. Sportsbet.io’s ambitions for the Premier League are not a chance occurrence either.</p>

<p>According to the company’s head of sportsbook marketing, Justin Le Brocque, the EPL is the world’s most watched soccer competition, and therefore a partnership with one of its flagship teams is definitely a good positioning strategy for Sportsbet.io.</p>
<p>Mr. Le Brocque said that both Sportsbet.io and Watford share “a desire to combine passion and innovation,” and reach the top. In his account, the betting agency and Watford will be able to continue collaborating in the following season and beyond.</p>
<p>Not the Only Betting Agency on the Block</p>
<p>Cryptocurrency partnerships aren’t new in the EPL, but they aren’t popular either. VBet, a platform operated by BetConstruct, has become the official gaming partner for another Premier League team, Arsenal. The deal includes a special partnership with Ray Parlour, the club’s highly-esteemed former player, who will also represent Vbet as the brand’s ambassador.</p>
<p>Similarly to the Watford partnership, Arsenal Commercial Director Peter Silverstone pointed out to the importance of staying innovative:</p>
<p>Innovation is a key part of what drives us at Arsenal, so we are excited to partner with such a forward-thinking, global brand.</p>
<p>Mr. Silverstone clarified that Arsenal and VBet will work closely together to come up with new and exclusive content for fans. New and exciting promotions have also been promised by both Vbet and Arsenal.</p>
<p>Betting partnerships between sports teams and betting agencies aren’t precisely new. In the United Kingdom alone, Betway and bet365 have had ties with the Premier League. Bet365 is also tied with Spanish La Liga’s clubs.</p>
