<p>Lionel Messi‚Äôs Inter Miami is welcoming the winner of the 2023 Supporters‚Äô Shield at DRV PNK Stadium on Saturday, October 7 in what could be the crucial game for the Herons.</p>
<p>If Inter Miami doesn‚Äôt beat FC Cincinnati on Saturday, Lionel Messi &amp; Co can forget about the 2023 Playoffs. Unfortunately for the Herons, even a win on October 7 wouldn‚Äôt be a guarantee that they‚Äôre going to make the playoffs.</p>

<p>Inter Miami Needs to Get Back on the Winning Track</p>
<p>Lionel Messi missed Inter Miami‚Äôs last four games. Did they do well without him? Nope. They lost two of those and drew the other two. One of those defeats happened on Wednesday evening in Chicago where they lost 4-1 against the Fire.</p>

<p>The result of all this is that the Herons are now five points behind the closest team from the playoff zone. The good news is that they have one game in hand, meaning that if they win on Saturday, they‚Äôd reduce the point gap to just two points.</p>
<p>So, can they beat FC Cincinnati? If Messi returns, they could do it. But he remains questionable for Saturday‚Äôs duel, the same as his former Barcelona teammate, Jordi Alba. He probably won‚Äôt be 100% fit, but we do expect coach Gerardo ‚ÄúTata‚Äù Martino to let him play. After all, this game is way too important for Messi to miss it.</p>
<p>FC Cincinnati Have Already Finished Their Regular-Season Work</p>
<p>FC Cincinnati has won the 2023 MLS Supporters‚Äô Shield ‚Äì the award given to the team with the best record in the regular season.</p>
<p>Whatever happens in the remainder of the season, FC Cincinnati will stay at the top of the Eastern Conference table. This means that they can relax on Saturday. This also means that their coach can keep some of his key men sidelined in order to ensure they remain 100% fit for the 2023 playoffs.</p>
<p>He did something like that earlier this week against the New York Red Bulls, the result of which was that Cincy lost 2-1.</p>
<p>Inter Miami vs. FC Cincinnati Prediction</p>
<p>If Inter Miami wins against FC Cincinnati on Saturday, October 7, this team will get one step closer to the playoffs. But even a victory won‚Äôt mean booking the ticket to the postseason. However, not winning on Saturday would mean the end of the Herons‚Äô playoff dreams.</p>
<p>The Herons won‚Äôt give up on those dreams, which is why they‚Äôre gonna go all-in against Cincy. This also means that coach Tata Martino will probably put Lionel Messi in the starting XI for the first time in four games. As a result, Inter Miami should grab a win pm Saturday.</p>
<p>Picks: Inter Miami to win and over 2.5 goals</p>
