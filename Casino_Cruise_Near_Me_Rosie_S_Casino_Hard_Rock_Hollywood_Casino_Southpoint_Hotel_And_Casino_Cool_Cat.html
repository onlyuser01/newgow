<p>Fruits &amp; Clovers: 20 Lines review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Playson’s efforts when churning out their slot machines are very rarely creative. Instead, they opt for solid coding and visual design while rehashing well-established themes.</p>
<p>In Fruits &amp; Clovers: 20 Lines, the theme is that of a basic fruit machine with melons, cherries and oranges for symbols with a clover thrown in for - as it were - good luck.</p>
<p>It is a rather limp attempt to reuse the old assets of other games in Playson’s stable and contributes little by way of story or atmosphere.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The graphics are, as ever with Playson, well drawn and well animated, but show no real sense of style. Nothing about the game seems calculated to draw the player in, just to tick the boxes required to turn yet another slot machine out.</p>
<p>The soundtrack shows a similar lack of effort, with simple reel and win sounds but no music to accompany them.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Fruits &amp; Clovers: 20 Lines is three by five slot. The "20 Lines" of the title refers to the fact that the game has 20 win lines.</p>
<p>This is all so much vanilla ice cream - dependable classic design choices but dull to look at and duller to play.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>There are no bonus games in Fruits &amp; Clovers: 20 Lines.</p>
<p>The Wild symbols substitute for all symbols except the Scatter symbol and come stacked on all reels, for bigger wins.</p>
<p>The Scatter pays out if you hit three or more, regardless of where on the reels they land.</p>
<p>Three Scatters with net you 5 times your total bet, four symbols gets you 20 times your bet, and five symbols get you a huge 400 times your bet per spin.</p>
<p>Paytable for Fruits &amp; Clovers:20 lines slot machine</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of Fruits &amp; Clovers: 20 Lines is not provided by the publisher. When the return to player for a slot is not clearly provided in the game documentation we take this as a red flag as it could be masking an exorbitant vig.</p>
<p>The volatility of Fruits &amp; Clovers: 20 Lines is medium, which makes it a little too low to match very well with our own slot machine strategies.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.20 up to a maximum of $/£/€100.00 per spin. This should allow most people to find a bet size that works for them.</p>
<p>Win in Fruits &amp; Clovers:20 lines slot</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Fruits &amp; Clovers: 20 Lines is an all-round disappointment. The return to player is unpublished, the volatility underwhelming and the design tired and old.</p>
<p>Try as it might to cover its numerous failures of imagination, Fruits &amp; Clovers: 20 Lines is mediocre through and through. We do not recommend this one to our readers.</p>
