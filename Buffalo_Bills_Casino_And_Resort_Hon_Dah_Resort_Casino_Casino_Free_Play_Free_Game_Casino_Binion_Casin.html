<p>Daniel Negreanu, Lena Evans and Katie Kalvoda will be hosting a poker tournament to fundraise for Andrew Yang.</p>
<p>Poker Tournament Fundraises for Andrew Yang</p>
<p>Last month, Daniel Negreanu expressed his support for presidential candidate Andrew Yang after he stated that online poker should be legalized. Now, the poker pro is coming together with Lena Evans and Katie Kalvoda to host a fundraiser poker tournament which will contribute to Yang‚Äôs campaign.</p>
<p>The event will take place on Sunday, December 15th at the Mosaic Theatre in Las Vegas. The opener will be running from 6pm to 8pm, which is a cocktail reception. The main event will run from 8pm to 10pm. Tickets are available on a variety of levels:</p>
<p>$300 for the Early Adopter</p>
<p>$500 for the Investor</p>
<p>$1000 for the Co-Host</p>
<p>$2800 for the VIP Experience with World Series Champions</p>
<p>Only those who purchase the $2800 tickets will be able to take part in the poker tournament. A number of fantastic prizes are on offer, including a day on the Singularity Yacht, private poker experiences with WSOP winners and a VIP experience with Steve Aoki.</p>
<p>It looks like a great event that will really spread the word about Yang‚Äôs platform. In October, he stated that online poker should be legal in all states, which would prevent players from gambling at offshore sites which could potentially put them at risk.</p>
<p>Online poker is legal in 4 states. The state-by-state rules are variable and push many players to offshore sites. We should clarify the rules and make it legal in all 50 states. US players and companies would benefit and new tax revenues could be used to mitigate addiction. ‚Äî Andrew Yangüß¢ (@AndrewYang) October 26, 2019</p>
<p>While it was this tweet that made Yang popular in the poker community, there are many other issues he supports that make him stand out. For example, he wants to eliminate private prisons, pay Americans a universal basic income, tax carbon emissions and provide Medicare for all.</p>
<p>Negreanu has been supportive of Yang for quite some time. He stated that he backed the presidential candidate long before he made his tweet supporting federal online poker legislation. He has had some great things to say about Yang, such as:</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis is just one small part of the equation for me, but if you are someone who wants online poker, he‚Äôs the most logical and practical person who is also centrist, he‚Äôs not a lefty or righty. He‚Äôs more in the middle and he‚Äôs just practical‚Äù.</p>
<p>You can look forward to seeing Andrew Yang in the poker world more, as well. Joey Ingram invited him on to his podcast, but they have yet to finalise a date. The poker community is sure to back him as he runs for president.</p>
