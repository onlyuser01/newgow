<p>Inter Milan won the first leg of the Champions League semifinal against their city rivals AC Milan 2-0. Six days later, the two meet at the same place â€“ Stadio Giuseppe Meazza â€“ in the match that will decide which of the two goes to Istanbul to play in the UCL Final</p>
<p>Inter players did great in the first game, getting a 2-0 win in the first-ever Derby Della Madoninna in the Champions League. What this means is that on Tuesday, May 16, they just need to make sure AC Milan donâ€™t beat them by two goals or more and theyâ€™ll qualify for the Final.</p>

<p>Inter Milan Are AC Milanâ€™s Kryptonite</p>
<p>The Nerazzurri have a very good record against their city rivals. Theyâ€™re 4-0-1 (W-D-L) against AC Milan in their last five meetings. This includes the one played last Wednesday when we saw Inter win by 2-0 with goals by Edin Dzeko and Henrikh Mkhitaryan early on in the game. After scoring those goals, they let the opposition take the initiative while switching their focus to defense.</p>
<p>Although the two share the same stadium, being labeled the home team means getting more fans in the stands. AC Milan had their fans to cheer them on but even that didnâ€™t help them find their way to Interâ€™s net.</p>
<p>ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡²ðŸ§¤ AndrÃ© Onana (27) is the first Inter goalkeeper to keep 7 clean sheets in a single UCL campaign! Not only that, he has the highest amount of saves too.</p>

<p>They did try it many times, but Interâ€™s defenders were brilliant. In fact, even though AC Milan players had the ball in their feet for nearly two-thirds of the game, making 14 goal attempts, Inter Milanâ€™s goalkeeper Andre Onana had to intervene only twice.</p>
<p>As a result, he was able to keep a clean sheet for the seventh time this season in the Champions League. Will he be able to do the same again next Tuesday?</p>
<p>AC Milan Have No Other Option But to Go All-In</p>
<p>Theyâ€™ve got nothing to lose. Theyâ€™re 2-0 down, meaning that their only option is to go out and attack with all they have. It seems like a very hard challenge, but keep in mind that they only need to win by two goals to take the game to extra time. And if they win by three or more, theyâ€™ll book a ticket to Istanbul.</p>
<p>The bad news is that finding the net 2+ times against Inter Milan looks like a mission impossible. However, there are some things that are feeding them with optimism. First of all, teams like Benfica have already proved Interâ€™s defense can be outsmarted. As a reminder, Benfica played 3-3 with Inter in Milan in the previous phase of the Champions League.</p>
<p>Then, thereâ€™s the thing about Rafael Leao. AC Milanâ€™s top scorer missed Game 1 due to an injury but is almost certain to return for Tuesdayâ€™s game.</p>
<p>Inter Milan vs AC Milan Prediction</p>
<p>Inter Milan will go into bunker mode, defending with all they got and looking for their chances from the break. Meanwhile, AC Milan will have no other option but to attack from the very start. Although weâ€™re certain they will find the net, we doubt that will be enough to take them to the Final of the Champions League.</p>
<p>Pick: AC Milan to win &amp; under 2.5 goals</p>
