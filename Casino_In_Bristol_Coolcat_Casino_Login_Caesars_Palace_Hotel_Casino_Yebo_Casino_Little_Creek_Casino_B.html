<p>As VP of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI), Blake will build on his previous successes with the NHL. His employee learning programs helped unify the organization and usher beneficial behavioral changes even among the senior executive team. Blake joins IGT at a pivotal moment for the company as it continues to pursue expansion through high-profile partnerships.</p>
<p>Blake’s Resume Makes Him Perfect for the Position</p>
<p>IGT’s new VP of DEI started his professional journey as a career management consultant for JP Morgan Chase. His ten years with the company were a solid foundation for his future career growth, honing his learning and coaching skills. Blake used the experience to found his own training and coaching company Achieve Peak Performance, providing services across various industries.</p>
<p>Between 2013 and 2019, Blake occupied senior leadership positions across several high-profile organizations, building HR capabilities, ushering organizational transformation, and bolstering cultural strategy development. His most recent job with the NHL was a pivotal step in his career, allowing him to apply all his accumulated knowledge to advise NHL Clubs on recruitment, culture, and diversity-minded growth strategies.</p>
<p>The Developer Continues to Excel across the USA</p>
<p>IGT congratulated Blake on his addition to the management team, lauding his inclusion teaching experience across the entire corporate ladder. The new VP of DEI should substantially bolster the company’s professional development, advancing organizational goals through building consensus and understanding. Adding such a seasoned professional to the management team matches the developer’s commitment to progressiveness.</p>
<p>IGT is committed to… fostering a diverse culture of respect and inclusion. We have no doubt that Brian will continue to build upon (our) solid foundation and achievements… IGT official statement</p>
<p>Blake joins IGT in a fluid and dynamic period. The company recorded stable 2022 financial results, posting a 3% year-on-year revenue increase to $4.2 billion. The lottery solution supplier generated good cash flow while promoting future growth. IGT’s momentum has remained strong in 2023, thanks to several new milestone agreements.</p>
<p>The company made significant advancements across North America. A deal with BetSkybox allowed IGT to expand its Ohio footprint, distributing its self-servicing kiosks at restaurants and bars across the state to provide them with retail sports betting. The agreement opened the way for future cooperation and additional expansion opportunities.</p>
<p>IGT has continued to seize new growth avenues, distributing its award-winning content with other industry-leading companies like Ruby Seven Studios and BetMGM. As the developer’s influence across the US grows, maintaining internal cohesion and unity becomes even more vital. Onboarding a professional like Blake is a natural progression toward IGT’s ongoing ambitions to preserve its winning streak.</p>
