<p>International Game Technology (IGT) continues to consolidate its presence in the Latin American region with the company renewing and extending its relationship with the Mexican national lottery operator, La Lotería Nacional or LOTENAL for short. The partnership has been realized through IGT’s subsidiaries in the market and the agreement extends the active relationship between the companies through September 2024.</p>
<p>IGT Ups the Ante on Its Lottery Game in Mexico</p>
<p>IGT will continue to deliver its signature games and add an integrated draw-based and instant win ticket system.</p>
<p>The company will add other cutting-edge lottery products such as new terminals and a stronger communications network. To ensure maximum reach, penetration, and engagement, IGT will bolster LOTENAL’s promotional efforts and seek to generate better conversion with players.</p>
<p>Commenting on this renewed partnership, LOTENAL coordinator of advisors Mario Caballero Luna said:</p>
<p>“LOTENAL has been evolving over the last few years, and this new contract with IGT ensures that we continue providing our players with the highest-quality and most engaging products.” LOTENAL coordinator of advisors Mario Caballero Luna</p>
<p>A big part of the new efforts will come down to introducing more instant-win products and making sure that they reach the intended customer base. To this end, IGT will be offering dedicated consulting services that may translate into better engagement. IGT will similarly offer guidance on other verticals, such as sports betting and odds trading. The company will benefit from LOTENAL’s outstanding reach in Mexico which currently numbers no fewer than 8,400 terminals.</p>
<p>IGT will have its hands full as it would have to continue maintaining the terminals as well as guarantee the integrity of the games. LOTENAL will assist with helping to establish new B2B retail channels and products. Meanwhile, the national lottery operator remains confident that IGT’s industry expertise is sufficient to continue to reap strong results for the operator’s lottery operations in Mexico.</p>
<p>IGT and LOTENAL Go Back Decades</p>
<p>This optimism is met by IGT COO for global lottery Jay Gendron who argues that over the past three decades, IGT and LOTENAL have been able to deliver on sterling results together. The addition of more IGT services on every level of the experience is only going to improve on this and accelerate the lottery’s progression.</p>
<p>IGT has been able to secure a number of similar extension deals earlier this year. The company renewed its contract with the Rhode Island state lottery for another 20 years in February. Earlier that month IGT also expanded its partnership with the Kalispel Tribal Economic Authority.</p>
