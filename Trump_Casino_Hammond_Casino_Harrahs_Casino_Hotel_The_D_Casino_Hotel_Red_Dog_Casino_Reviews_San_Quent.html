<p>San Quentin Xways review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Get ready to serve time in gritty style with San Quentin Xways.</p>
<p>Players will leave their hope at the gates as they enter the notorious California prison. Once inside, they’ll need to make alliances quickly and decide which gang they’ll be loyal to.</p>
<p>San Quentin Xways is not a slot for the faint-hearted, and some players may simply not be in the mood for the dark atmosphere.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The reels are crafted like cells, with bars at the bottom and top. Among the symbols, a variety of classic prison items can be found, including handcuffs, shivs, toilet paper, and lighters.</p>
<p>The stars of the reels are the prisoners themselves, each with their own personality. Some sport bandanas, others scars, and one smiles unsettlingly wide. There are elements of these characters that lean into stereotypes, but this world is more fantasy than documentary.</p>
<p>Beyond the reels, gloomy gray clouds drift in the sky above barbed wire-topped walls. This adds to the sense that there is no escape from the misery of San Quentin Xways.</p>
<p>The soundtrack is saturated with rock and roll vibes and filthy guitar notes. Players will want to keep this music on to capture the effortlessly cool outlaw feel of this slot. The reels spin with a metallic clicking that brings to mind jail doors sliding open.</p>
<p>The visuals combine with the music of this slot to create a tragic but enticing prison world.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>San Quentin Xways has a 5x3 reel structure, with Enhancer Cells above and below the reels that may be unlocked to show additional symbols.</p>
<p>When matching symbols land in adjacent reels, a win is awarded. Wins are calculated starting from the leftmost reel and going towards the rightmost.</p>
<p>For this slot, the maximum win is 150,000x players’ total bet.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>When 1-2 Bonus symbols appear on the reels, they become Wild symbols and more symbols will be added to the grid as the Enhancer Cells of that reel are opened.</p>
<p>Landing at least 3 Bonus symbols triggers the Free Spins feature, and the reels where the Bonus symbols land will open their Enhancer Cells. The values revealed by the Enhancer Cells will select the number of free spins awarded.</p>
<p>A Mystery symbol and its associated multiplier appears during the Free Spins feature.</p>
<p>Players can also land as many as 3 Jumping Wilds, which have the special property of moving to new spots on the reels during each spin.</p>
<p>Finally, Split Wilds are available and automatically divide every symbol on the reel where they appear, but they do not divide themselves.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.03%, almost exactly our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.20 up to a maximum of $/£/€32 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of San Quentin Xways is high, which makes it a good match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We recommend this average RTP, high volatility incarceration-themed slot.</p>

<p>The variety of bonus features adds even more themed appeal to this dark slot.</p>
