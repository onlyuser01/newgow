<p>The umbrella organization for 35 British racecourse shareholders and parent company of Racing TV, Racecourse Media Group (RMG), announced changes to its senior-level team. On Wednesday, the group revealed that it has appointed Scott Smith to the role of Non-Executive Director at the company. Although the appointment came this week, RMG explained that he will join the RMG Board starting on October 1, 2023.</p>
<p>Joining the C-suite at the Group, Smith brings extensive experience of more than 20 years in financial matters within consultancy, sport and even property and construction verticals. Moreover, he has significant knowledge and unique skills that make him the perfect fit for the Non-Executive Director role on the company's Board.</p>
<p>Smith holds a senior-level role with the England &amp; Wales Cricket Board (ECB) as Chief Financial Officer. His professional background includes a Financial Director position with A1GP World Cup of Motorsport. Additionally, Smith was also the Chief Financial Officer for the America's Cup.</p>
<p>Besides Smith's appointment, RMG confirmed another senior-level change. The Group revealed that Conor Grant will succeed Roger Lewis for the role of Chairman of the RMG Board. Similar to the Non-Executive Director appointment, that change will be in effect as of October 1, 2023.</p>
<p>The outgoing Chairman first joined the RMG Board back in 2012. "I pay tribute to the RMG team for delivering such great results over the years and I congratulate the vision of the RMG racecourses for creating and sustaining such a brilliant model for racing," explained Lewis in a statement. Finally, he predicted that Grant's leadership would bring exceptional results for RMG.</p>
<p>Grant, the future Chairman of the RMG Board, welcomed Smith to RMG. "Scott’s experience of many sectors, especially sport, will help shape our business and ensure we are maximizing exposure and returns for our shareholder racecourses – and therefore the sport itself," he explained.</p>
<p>What's more, Grant thanked the outgoing Chairman for his dedication and exceptional stewardship at RMG. In conclusion, he said: "Roger has been on the Board for well over a decade, first as a Board member and then Chairman, and has been instrumental in the development and success of RMG and its businesses over the last decade or so. We wish him all the very best for the future."</p>
<p>RMG's new Non-Executive Director was similarly thrilled to join the company's Board. He said that it is exciting to join the company at such an important moment for its growth. In addition to being an expert in the financial vertical, Smith is also an esteemed athlete considering he has participated in the "4 Deserts" endurance series and climbed some of the most dangerous mountains in the world.</p>
