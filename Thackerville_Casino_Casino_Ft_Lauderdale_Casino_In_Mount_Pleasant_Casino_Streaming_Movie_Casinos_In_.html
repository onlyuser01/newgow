<p>Betano, a popular casino and gaming brand, has expanded its library of games with the cutting-edge solution by BetGames, Skyward. Skyward is a riveting crash game experience that has been quickly winning players over with its deterministic and derring-do gameplay allowing each consumer to manage their risk and try to realize a better profit.</p>
<p>Although purely down to luck, Skyward has been a hit with players, and Betano is now determined to deploy it in the Brazilian iGaming market at a time when the country is finalizing its regulated gambling market and setting a firm framework in place. Skyward was released in November 2023, and has been gaining momentum ever since.</p>
<p>Skyward offers what the company describes as a high-energy gameplay that resonates with players and breaks the mould of traditional casino gaming, both by introducing fantastic animations and graphics, but also by specifically seeking to enhance the player expeirence and put everyone who plays the game in the hot seat.</p>
<p>The game comes with a massive multiplier that could hit 100,000x rewarding a playerâ€™s willingness to push the game to its limits. Chris Mavridis, Kaizen Gaming Head of Live Casino, the brand that owns Betano, said that the operator is constantly looking to expand its library and provide players with exciting experiences like Skyward.</p>
<p>"Adding the localized version of Skyward to our catalogue of games, with its easy-to-follow format, is another step towards our ultimate goal - to provide the most unforgettable sports betting and gaming experience to our customers,"Mavridis explained.</p>
<p>BetGames CPO Ian Catchick was equally excited for the opportunity to be introducing Skyward with Betano, a company that has clearly established itself as a leader in the market and that is looking to secure only the best experiences.</p>
<p>Catchick welcomed the chance to localize Skyward for yet another market and help it reach more players who are keen to explore the crash game genre and benefit from its many excellent features.</p>
<p>"With the hugely popular, high-frequency aircraft-themed crash game concept, Skyward brings a new level of excitement and engagement to our extensive portfolio of pre-existing games and opens the door to potential future partnerships in the market," stated.</p>
<p>Previously, BetGames rolled out a dedicated branded crash game with Betway, as the company pursues new opportunities with prominent operators worldwide.</p>
