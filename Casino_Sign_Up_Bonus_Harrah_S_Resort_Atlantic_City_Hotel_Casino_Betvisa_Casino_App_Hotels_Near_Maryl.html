<p>Saturday, September 3 is a day for soccer derbies in Europe. There are several local derbies scheduled for this date, most notably, the Derby della Madonnina in Italy. When it comes to England, the biggest derby of the Premier League Matchday 6 is the one taking place at Goodison Park – Everton vs Liverpool.</p>
<p>Also known as the Merseyside Derby, Everton-Liverpool is one of the oldest rivalries not only in soccer but sports in general. It started back in 1894 and has been played every season in the English top-flight since 1962.</p>
<p>So far, the two rivals have met on 260 occasions, with Liverpool leading the all-time series with 97 wins, along with 76 draws and just 67 losses. When it comes to their head-to-head duels in the 21st century, the Reds have been way more successful. This goes especially for their meetings in the Jurgen Klopp era – since the German has been at the helm, Liverpool is 9-5-1 against Everton.</p>
<p>Everton vs Liverpool Odds</p>
<p>Moneyline</p>
<p>Everton +600 Draw +375 Liverpool -250</p>
<p>Goals Over/Under</p>
<p>Over 2.5 -175 Under 2.5 +137</p>
<p>When, Where, and How to Watch?</p>
<p>Date : Saturday, September 3</p>
<p>: Saturday, September 3 Time: 7:30 AM ET</p>
<p>7:30 AM ET Place: Goodison Park in Liverpool</p>
<p>Everyone at Everton Seems to be Worried About Saturday’s Game</p>
<p>Last Saturday, Liverpool obliterated AFC Bournemouth 9-0, for which the Cherries’ coach Scott Parker got sacked by the club owners, thus becoming the first Premier League manager to lose the job in the 2022-23 season. Everton’s coach Frank Lampard could be the next one.</p>
<p>The thing is that even though Everton’s owners have invested huge amounts of money in the team over the last couple of years, the Toffees just aren’t playing great. Last season, they barely avoided relegation, but there are worries that they won’t be as lucky this time. At least not with Lampard as their boss.</p>
<p>Oddsmakers think Lampard could be the next EPL manager to leave the post, giving +500 on such a scenario playing out. However, we need to give the guy some credit – it’s not his fault that several of Everton’s key men are out with injuries.</p>
<p>Dominic Calvert-Lewin, Yerri Mina, Ben Godfrey, Mason Holgate, Abdoulaye Doucoure, and Andros Townsend are listed as injured, while a few others are still not at 100% fitness. This explains why the Toffees are still without a win in the Prem, with a 0-3-2 record in the 2022-23 season.</p>
<p>Mohamed Salah Looking for His 121st EPL Goal in Liverpool Shirt</p>
<p>After a slow start to the season, the Reds have switched to demolition mode. First, they destroyed AFC Bournemouth 9-0, then they crushed Crystal Palace’s dreams by beating them 2-1 with the winning goal scored in the eighth minute of the stoppage time.</p>
<p>What’s strange is that even though Liverpool put away a total of 11 goals in those two games, Mohamed Salah wasn’t among the scorers. He did, however, create more scoring chances than anyone else, but failed to make them count.</p>
<p>Mohamed Salah has created 21 chances in the Premier League so far.</p>

<p>Knowing that he’s the reigning EPL top scorer, it’s only logical to assume that his goal drought isn’t going to last too long. In fact, we expect to see him score in the Merseyside Derby.</p>
<p>Apart from Salah, we could also see Darwin Nunez score. Liverpool’s highest-paid signing of the last transfer period got sent off in Premier League Round 2, for which he had to sit out the following three games. But he’s back now and is determined to show the fans he belongs in the red jersey.</p>
<p>Everton vs Liverpool Prediction</p>
<p>The Reds are full of confidence after a 9-0 win last weekend and are ready to do something similar against Everton. We expect a big win for Liverpool, with at least one goal scored by Mo Salah. Online sportsbooks are giving +110 on Salah to score anytime.</p>
<p>Picks:</p>
<p>Liverpool to win</p>
<p>Over 2.5 goals</p>
<p>Mohamed Salah to score anytime</p>
