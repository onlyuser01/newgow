<p>A week before Wimbledon, Venus Williams wasn’t sure she was going to play because of her involvement in a fatal automobile accident. Now she is one victory away from winning her sixth singles title in the Grand Slam event.</p>

<p>Saturday the 37-year-old tennis star will face Garbine Muguruza in the finals at Centre Court at the All England Tennis Club. It is the first time since 2009 she has been to the title match.</p>
<p>She enters as an even money pick to win, according to odds makers at several sportsbooks.</p>
<p>The 10th seed got to the championship by defeating sixth-seed Johanna Konta in straight sets. It is the fourth consecutive opponent she has needed only two sets to dispatch.</p>
<p>“She dictated the match from the very first ball till the very last one,” Konta said. “I think she just showed why she’s a five-time champion here. It was very difficult for me to get a good foothold in the match. The few opportunities that I did get, she did incredibly well to take them away from me.”</p>
<p>Avoiding Distractions</p>
<p>Williams has put aside the controversy surrounding the accident she had on June 9, when an elderly woman hit her SUV in Palm Beach Gardens. Linda Barson’s husband, Jerome, died two weeks later as a result of the collision.</p>
<p>The police originally placed Williams at fault, but rescinded that conclusion when video surveillance from the gated community where the 37-year-old lives, showed her legally entering the intersection. The police are still investigating the accident and could still blame her.</p>
<p>That recent news hasn’t stopped the family of Barson from suing the seven-time grand slam title winner. Their lawyer, Michael Steiger, told the Palm Beach Post the wrongful death lawsuit will proceed as planned.</p>
<p>“There is nothing that disputes Ms. Williams was in the intersection on a red light, and the witnesses clearly confirm the Barsons had a green light and lawfully entered the intersection,” Steiger said.</p>
<p>Center of Attention</p>
<p>For now, Williams is focused on the sport she has played as a child. Her opponent is seeded 14th and Williams is the favorite, but knows what she needs to do to win.</p>
<p>“I’m definitely in the position I want to be in,” Williams said. “It’s a long two weeks. Now I’m knocking on the door for a title. This is where I want to be. I’m definitely excited. But there’s still more to happen. I’m still very focused.”</p>
<p>While the odds given for Williams might not be that appealing to bettors, there are a variety of proposition bets that might be worth a wager. She is a 9-4 pick to win in straight sets and 10-3 to win in three sets.</p>
<p>A more complicated bet, but with slightly better odds is she will win, win 85 plus points and serve 14 plus aces. She is 9-2 for that prop bet.</p>
