<p>Golden Matrix Group Inc. has posted its third-quarter results, marked key performance changes, and reported on a rather steep loss of $965,628</p>
<p>The company, which specializes in the development, licensure and operations of online gaming and e-commerce platforms, has offered an in-depth look at its performance. Although revenue over the period hit a record $11.3 million, the results were marred by the reported loss.</p>
<p>Golden Matrix Not Worried about Temporary Slowdown</p>
<p>Regardless, the company has been enjoying a steadfast upward trajectory leaving its first nine-month revenue for the fiscal 2023 year up 22% to $32.4 million, ahead of the $26.5 million posted in the same period a year earlier. Golden Matrix CEO Brian Goodman welcomed the results and commented on the performance, adding that the year has been good for Golden Matrix, and so has the quarter.</p>
<p>“The Company achieved record revenues and posted its seventh consecutive quarter with positive cash flow from operations,” Goodman said. He addressed the issue of the company’s net loss of $965,628 which he said was driven by several factors, including the recent acquisition of MeridianBet Group, which incurred due diligence and legal expenses.</p>
<p>The company also attributed part of its loss to the rollout of the Mexplay brand and the associated marketing costs. Mexplay is Golden Matrix’s B2C online casino brand that launched in Mexico earlier this year.</p>
<p>“We have made important investments during the quarter in systems and people to accelerate the growth of our B2C segments, both RKings and Mexplay,” Goodman explained.</p>
<p>However, these are all just temporary setbacks, as the company is now planning to drive significant results as the synergies should finally kick in and introduce new opportunities for the group, which are also expected to reflect positively on its future financial performance.</p>
<p>“Closing of the MeridianBet acquisition will be a watershed event which is expected to catapult Golden Matrix into the global gaming markets as a highly competitive participant,” Goodman said confidently.</p>
<p>Mexplay Already Showing a Lot of Promise</p>
<p>The company is already seeking some interesting developments that make it optimistic about the future of its operations. For one, Mexplay has already achieved 32,800 registered consumers as of July 31, 2028. The total wagering volume in the third quality with Mexplay hit $5.8 million, and total deposits amounted to $476,000.</p>
<p>Not least, RKingsCompetitions Ltd, another group property, completed 1,212 competitions and gave away more than $12 million in various prizes during the first nine months of the fiscal year.</p>
