    <h1>Edgewater Casino Resort Casino City Seminole Casino Immokalee Florida Casino Hotel Reno Elite Casino</h1>

<p>Thank you for the updates.</p>
<p>Dear Jesse,</p>
<p>Considering the facts that your complaint was initially submitted with the disputed amount of 5,500 NZ$ and the winnings from a tournament were just mentioned somewhere without any exact information about their amount, and that the casino's claims make sense and it is not possible to check the necessary information because the casino is closed, to be honest, in this case, I would be glad and happy that I received the disputed funds from a closed casino. We are talking about one of the casinos which did not have problems with paying their players. We have more experience with closed casinos that stopped responding completely after the closure, and their players are likely waiting for their disputed funds until now.</p>
<p>Based on all the information provided above, if you needed me to continue resolving the winnings from the tournament, I would also need more details from you. It is not enough to only claim something.</p>
<p>Can you please provide me with all the emails and communication where the casino informed you about its planned closure and recommendation for withdrawing your funds from the casino?</p>
<p>Are you able to provide me with screenshots or evidence that could support your claims about the completed tournament, and that there were winnings in your account from this tournament?</p>
<p>It is possible to share the data directly here, with your reply, or by sending them to my email address (branislav.b@casino.guru).</p>
<p>If the casino's explanation was enough for you, you agree with the solution, and we can consider the complaint resolved - please let me know and the complaint will be closed as resolved.</p>
