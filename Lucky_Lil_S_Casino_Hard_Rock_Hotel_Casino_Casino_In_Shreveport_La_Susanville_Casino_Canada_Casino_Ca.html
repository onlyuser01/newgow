<p>Information about Booongo casinos</p>
<p>Booongo – yes, spelt with three 'o's - is a slots and software provider with offices in Curacao, Ukraine and Taiwan. Video slots are central to their collection, and they also provide a back-office solution for casino operators.</p>
<p>This page is here to bring you more info about Booongo, and which online casinos offer their games to players. You can read about their performance as a company, some of their best slots, which Booongo casinos offer bonuses and, most importantly, how to choose a safe Booongo casino site.</p>

<p>Booongo: a popular provider with an entertaining slots selection</p>
<p>Booongo has been around since 2015, when a team of slots enthusiasts in Ukraine decided to launch their own start-up. They targeted the mobile gaming market, a rapidly growing industry at that point, and their focus was on producing cross-platform slot games that caught players' attention with their high level of quality.</p>
<p>One of the first big events in the company's history was obtaining the Curacao license in April 2017. This allowed them to operate in several popular iGaming markets, and they set up an office on the Caribbean Island to cement their presence. They also opened an office in Taiwan as they looked to expand into the Asian market.</p>
<p>As Booongo grew, so did its collection of slot games. With an emphasis on video slots, it released a wide selection of titles over the next few years, including its first progressive jackpot release, Book of Sun, in 2019. This marked a new line of games leading to the popular Aztec Sun: Hold and Win the following year. By this point, Booongo was also using its technical expertise to offer a back-office solution to casino operators.</p>
<p>We could view Booongo as an established game provider today. It has a wide network of partnerships with operators, and regularly features at top industry gaming events such as ICE London. Its management has recently stated a desire to move into the African and Latin American markets, so it's highly likely that you'll see more Booongo content out there in the future.</p>
<p>Booongo slots and software</p>
<p>Booongo's selection of immersive video slots take pride of place in their games collection. Not only do they boast some impressive graphics, but they also offer progressive jackpots that sometimes deliver generous payouts.</p>
<p>As mentioned before, Aztec Sun: Hold and Win, is a prime example of this. The prime jackpot here revolves around collecting 15 suns symbols – an extremely unlikely event, but fun to think about. The game's five reels, holding ancient Aztec symbols, flow smoothly as you play. Be sure to look out for the Temple scatter symbols that trigger a free spins feature, and the sun symbol that is the pathway to the bonus game.</p>
<p>Another Booongo slot with a progressive jackpot is Dragon Pearls: Hold and Win – one of several games dedicated to the company's presence in Asian markets. Based on the traditional belief that dragons bring wealth, the game challenges you to find where this particular dragon hides its pearls. These act as the Scatter symbols and six of them will start the bonus game – find all the pearls here and you get the Grand Jackpot, which is 1,000 times your bet.</p>
<p>Of course, you don't have to throw yourself into a world of video slots and progressive prizes if you don't want. Booongo also has simpler games, such as 777 Gems, a minimalist slot based on the classic slots of yesteryear; and Monkey Money a fun slot with bananas – lots of them.</p>
<p>It's also worth mentioning that Booongo's high line in game quality is powered by its own software, something that's available as a safe back-office solution to operators. It offers API integration, is available in 18 languages and transfers easily to any type of platform.</p>
<p>How to choose the best Booongo casino online</p>
<p>Many casinos offer Booongo games, but not all of them are a great bet to play on. One of Casino Guru's main objectives is to help you find reliable sites to play on, and you can find some tips on how to choose the best one that offers Booongo games on this page.</p>
<p>Every casino on our database is assessed by our team of experts. They rate it according to its player treatment and its ability to pay out big wins, among other things. To find the best Booongo sites in this regard, select the 'Recommended' tab which will give you a list of top-rated casinos that we suggest you start your search with.</p>
<p>You can use other filters to make a different search. 'Newly opened', for example, will give you new Booongo casinos on our system. These might new casino sites not be established, but they could have some nice welcome offers on display. The 'All' filter, meanwhile, gives you the complete list of qualifying casinos.</p>
<p>There are other filters that can refine your search further, if need be. These include 'Payment Method', which will let you locate Booongo casinos with your preferred payment provider, like Skrill or Visa, for instance. You can also find sites based on which currencies and languages they offer, and several other factors.</p>

<p>Booongo casino bonuses</p>
<p>As many casino players will testify, a good bonus is a great way to get to know a new casino. The deposit bonus, for example, gives you extra credit or spins after you add to your casino balance, while a no deposit bonus gives you a smaller amount just for registering.</p>
<p>You can find bonuses offered by Booongo casinos on Casino Guru. Start by going to our list of casino bonuses and looking for 'Booongo' in the filter named 'Game Provider'. If you're after a certain bonus type, you can look for this, too: just go to the 'Bonus Type' filter and choose your preference. For no deposit bonuses, for instance, choose the 'No Deposit Bonus' box. You can also get these by going to the list of no deposit bonuses and selecting 'Booongo' there.</p>
