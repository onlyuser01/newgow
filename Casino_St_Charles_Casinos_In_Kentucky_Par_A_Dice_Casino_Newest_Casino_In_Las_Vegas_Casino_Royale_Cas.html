<p>Denmark continues to be the focal point of interest for many casinos and suppliers, as the country welcomes yet another supplier. Stakelogic’s local footprint though has been well-established as this is not the first time that the company is presenting its products to local operators.</p>
<p>The latest tie-up puts Stakelogic in a content alliance with Casino House, offering the operator access to the supplier’s extensive library of games, which include classic and video slots. Among these are such excellent games as Super Bonus Wild, Super 6 Timer, Mega Runner, and Bonus Runner.</p>
<p>Stakelogic introduces a range of experiences and game features, such as multipliers, wilds, expanding features, and free spins. Casino House is also hosting a range of player-favorite video slots by Stakelogic moving forward, including Wild Wild Bass 2, Eric’s Big Catch, Money Track 2, Greedy Fox, and more.</p>
<p>The partnership was welcomed by Casino House Casino Manager Thomas Vandsted who hailed the opportunity to see the website secure more worthwhile content that is set to be a hit with local players.</p>
<p>"The variety and quality of its portfolio are unrivalled, covering both classic and video slots," Vandsted added. Stakelogic Senior Sales Manager Danila Dzehs was similarly excited at the opportunity and said that players in Denmark already have a well-established taste for strong-quality games.</p>
<p>Dzehs added that the market has a huge demand for cutting-edge classic and video slots the kind that Stakelogic was able to supply locally and truly elevate the company’s offer. Stakelogic has done an excellent job of expanding locally in Europe, with the company recently entering a similar content alliance with Starcasino in Belgium.</p>
<p>As to the Danish iGaming market, the region has been developing rapidly, introducing new suppliers and brands locally. Betsson has just confirmed that it is rebranding Casino.dk to the eponymous brand, in a bid to strengthen its branding locally.</p>
<p>The continued and sustained interest in Denmark from operators and suppliers comes at a time when local regulators are continuing to take the necessary measures that lead to stronger channelization into the regulated gambling market.</p>
<p>Spillemyndigheden, the Dutch Gaming Authority, has confirmed that it has blocked 49 illegal gambling websites in its latest effort to keep the industry safe and free from unauthorized parties.</p>
