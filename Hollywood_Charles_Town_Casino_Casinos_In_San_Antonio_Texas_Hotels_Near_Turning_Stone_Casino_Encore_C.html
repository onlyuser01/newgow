    <h1>Hollywood Charles Town Casino Casinos In San Antonio Texas Hotels Near Turning Stone Casino Encore C</h1>

<p>The authority issues the license, because they get paid for it. Then you have authorities with different approaches. There are authorities that are closely related to the national government. Whenever they issue a license, you can trust them. But then you have authorities that issues the license to basically anyone who pays for it.</p>
<p>Then it all depends on the casino. There are great casinos with very customer-friendly approach that are licensed in Curacao or they don't even have any license. But it's thanks to their management, not because they need to be like that, because they have the license.</p>
<p>For example you have casinos that are licensed in Costa Rica. I've never heard about a case where a player contacted the licensing authority and they would even reply to him.</p>
