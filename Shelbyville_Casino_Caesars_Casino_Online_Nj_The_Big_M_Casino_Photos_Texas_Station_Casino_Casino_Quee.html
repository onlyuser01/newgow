    <h1>Shelbyville Casino Caesars Casino Online Nj The Big M Casino Photos Texas Station Casino Casino Quee</h1>

<p>Hello, until now I noticed this conversation ... so the provider of the Pay U team and I told your colleague on the line ... 5 minutes after sending it from the bank, the money was sent to the internet seller, ie the concrete, a long time ago. on the betor's account the money appeared on the account after about 18, 19 hours ... it's quite strange no and you don't think quite slowly ... And especially the lady on the Betoru customer line told me that I can easily deposit there even though it's already from Pay It can take up to 24 hours to get sent ... don't you think it's a bit slow and mainly that since it's not written anywhere in advance, you're blocking people in the air for no reason ...? so every recharge can theoretically take up to 24 hours, yes, thank you very much ...</p>
<p>And let me have another thing, I had accounts at all casinos with a Czech license, for example, in the fort a net loss in about a year and a half 1250000, so I'm not a newcomer and I know when something is wrong, never and nowhere happened to me the first 10,000 after a bet of 5 CZK, whether in any game he lost in your style in such a way that never or maybe once a hundred but it is almost the same as he was never in the plus ... and when I wrote to Betro in support that they are thieves and it is normal theft, but certainly not a game, and if it has to have its return to a minimum, or I don't know it at all, then at least it's not so okay, because every little player knows this ... Nobody wrote it off ...</p>
<p>the next day, suddenly out of nowhere out of nowhere he found a CZK 200 bonus out of nowhere, without knowing what for it and the found aurtomats gave as never before I had 12,000 there ... I put in CZK 200 each ... Fool I thought it was already like that it will probably stay, but it gave it like elsewhere for two or three days, but a week later it was just putting money into a bottomless abyss..it's just completely different than elsewhere ...</p>
<p>today I have a loss of 35-40000 on Betor, because I don't believe a word anymore and I have an account there for about 2, maybe 3, months and apart from the given ten after the e-mail for support, I never had a win, a little cool or a corresponding deposit ... clearly that you can think of something hard you can admit ...</p>
<p>for example, I have had an account on Chance.cz for about a month and I chose the exact same style of playing as your ´cca 50,000 ...</p>
<p>And it started with ¨You (as if I knew the course of the next few days for you, because at that time I wrote to the support that it is not a crown or ten crowns but a principle and trust, and that if it is at registration, how will it look like) )</p>
<p>already during registration, when you clearly write that you will return the money to the account and they are only for verification and nothing or maybe then sometimes but you no longer watch it when I wrote in support, so I do not know what they said, but it was one email to which for the first time and for the last time for the last time you at least wrote off ...</p>
<p>It's the same with your loyalty bonus, depending on how you describe it on your website, it looks like one day a week, you get a certain percentage of lost money, but at least 50 CZK, it was strange to me that there was never one, so I called the line and they said I haven't lost enough to meet it yet and I think I play quite often and for a lot, now certainly not with you, but at the moment when I called the line for at least 1-2000 a day and I do not remember exactly but I know that I was quite surprised when after such a diligent game the lady on the line told me that in order to get 50 CZK loyalty bonus I still have to lose a lot, it was definitely over 10000 at the time, so I don't know how high the percentage of loyalty bonus can be for you when after 25000 CZK you are not entitled to 50 CZK presented to you ... for the whole time and how many times I played for 5000 a day I got it once ...</p>
<p>In short, to summarize anywhere in border casinos when making a casino mistake or contacting support, first of all the decency is at least to write off, but in most you get any compensation bonus how painful but I have not experienced the only place to win and 90 percent of you nobody support will not be written off ... I do not understand at all how you could get a Czech license, when it is so strict with us, but I would definitely recommend all players to never play with you, because we really do not need such a casino in the Czech Republic even if we have so few ...</p>
<p>Today I go to Betor only occasionally to see if something has not changed but it will never change, because ... this is how it makes their owners the most money, but they should catch their nose a little ...... in short, hams, hams, etc. more than those, but I don't believe that your earnings would not be enough, as they have in other casinos with a Czech license, as if people were losing little ...</p>
