<p>With years of experience working towards the digitalization of all companies he’s been part of, Ryan Spoon, an ESPN heavyweight, steps in as COO at BetMGM.</p>
<p>BetMGM Gets an ESPN Veteran at the Helm</p>
<p>MGM Resorts and GVC Holdings’ sports betting joint venture, BetMGM, has tapped Ryan Spoon, an ESPN veteran, as its new chief operating officer (COO). Mr Spoon brings years of experience into the establishment, as he previously served as SVP of Social and Digital Content and SVP of Digital Product and Design at ESPN.</p>
<p>He is the name cited when looking into ESPN’s digital footprint and the organization’s success as a reliable source of information from the world of sports.</p>
<p>During his stint with ESPN, Mr Spoon made it possible for the sports broadcaster to break away from the chains of tradition and benefit from the vast expanse of the internet by forging the company’s mobile apps, fantasy sports product, developing its social media assets and charting a course for the website.</p>
<p>Mr Spoon Has Spearheaded Digital Innovation for Years</p>
<p>His penchant for innovation while others doubt has been vastly the reason why ESPN has transformed itself into an important part of the community today, and not least driving the highest engagement on social media channels such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, not only in the United States, but well across the world.</p>
<p>Mr Spoon also served a stint as a venture capitalist at Polaris Venture Partners, the place where he whet his appetite for digital innovation. Mr Spoon will work under BetMGM chief executive Adam Greenblatt.</p>
<p>Commenting on the recent hire, Mr Greenblatt had to say this, “BetMGM has seen early success in establishing itself as a significant player in the sports betting world through relationships with leagues, teams and partners,” Greenblatt said.</p>
<p>“With Ryan’s expertise in developing scaled and engaging digital experiences, BetMGM will leverage those relationships in entirely new ways,” added Mr Greenblatt, praising Mr Spoon’s technological and savvy experience.</p>
<p>Mr Greenblatt praised Mr Spoon’s technological and savvy experience and was looking forward to seeing how he would do on the job. In the meantime, BetMGM is working hard to grow its presence in the United States with launches in Tennessee and endorsement deals with the Detroit Lions, Las Vegas Raiders, and naturally, the Tennessee Titans.</p>
