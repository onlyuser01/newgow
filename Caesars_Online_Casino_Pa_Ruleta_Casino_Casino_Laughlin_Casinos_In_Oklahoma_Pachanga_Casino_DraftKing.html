    <h1>Caesars Online Casino Pa Ruleta Casino Casino Laughlin Casinos In Oklahoma Pachanga Casino DraftKing</h1>

<p>The state of Kansas prepares to launch its own sports betting market this September. As a result, operators are now preparing for the big event, with each one hoping to grab the lion’s share of customers in the state. DraftKings, a sports betting juggernaut, is among the companies waiting to foray into Kansas’ fresh market.</p>
<p>The Operator Prepares to Launch in Kansas</p>
<p>DraftKings just announced its plans to launch its critically-acclaimed sportsbook once sports betting goes live in the Sunflower State. The operator’s launch is still subject to regulatory approval but the company is optimistic about joining Kansas ahead of the National Football League season. The state is set to become the 18th state where its online sports betting offerings are available and the 19th state where it offers sports betting.</p>
<p>DraftKings has long eyed the Kansas market. A few months ago, the company announced a sports betting deal with Boot Hill Casino, a tribally-owned venue in Kansas, that will allow the operator to launch in the state. Boot Hill also has agreements with Bally’s Corporation and, most recently, with Golden Nugget Online Gaming.</p>
<p>Once Kansas’ sports betting market officially launches, sports betting fans in the Sunflower State will be able to play with some of the most renowned operators in North America, including DraftKings. The latter’s mobile app can be downloaded for both iOS and Android devices and will offer exciting experiences for sports enthusiasts.</p>
<p>DraftKings Is Excited About Kansas Sports Betting</p>
<p>Matt Kalish, co-founder of DraftKings and acting president of DraftKings North America, said that the company is thrilled by the opportunity to offer its “award-winning” products in the state. Kalish noted that the launch of Kansas’ sports betting market coincides with an especially exhilarating time of the year, namely the NFL season. He is happy to launch in the state just in time for the beloved sports league.</p>
<p>It’s an especially exhilarating time of year, and we are excited for eligible Kansans to be able to get in on all the action through DraftKings’ seamless and responsible sports betting experience. Matt Kalish, president, DraftKings NA</p>
<p>DraftKings already teased news about the promotions it will offer to clients in Kansas. Eligible players can pre-register and benefit from $100 worth of free bets. To elaborate, customers will get four free bets worth $25 each. In addition, a single lucky customer will be drawn for a $100,000 free bet on launch day.</p>
<p>In early August, DraftKings published its financial results for the second quarter of the year. The company’s business seems to be doing great, making it a very convenient time to foray into new markets.</p>
