    <h1>Casinos In The Poconos Table Mountain Casino Buffet Fitz Tunica Casino Hotel Del Lago Resort Casino</h1>

<p>Dear Casino Guru Team,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your email and efforts to resolve this dispute which has arisen between our online casino and the respective user.</p>
<p>Please be informed on the following:</p>
<p>Our enhanced due diligence carried out with regard to the mentioned user has shown that the user had two accounts – one account on our brand "Mystake" and another one on – "Roulette".</p>
<p>The fraud and compliance team which has been verifying the identity of the user for the purposes of carrying out the remaining payout has discovered the following circumstances: The user has provided our company with selfies of two (obviously) different persons holding one and the same ID card. Therefore, it is obvious that the user has provided our company at least on one count with a false selfie/identity document.</p>
<p>According to the rules of our casinos, in case of submission of false documents the withdrawal can be refused/account terminated (see the attached photo).</p>
<p>Please be informed that we are ready to provide the respective proof consisting of the documentation provided by the user if the user gives its approval.</p>
<p>Please share our position with the user.</p>
<p>We hereby assure you that we adhere to the highest standards of fair play – It has never been our intention to treat one of our clients unfairly as it might seriously damage our reputation and as you know the reputation is priceless in this business.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we have an irreputable proof that the client has provided us with false personal data, therefore, we are even entitled to claim back the funds transferred to the user in the amount of 12,500 USD.</p>
<p>Looking forward to hearing from you soon.</p>
