<p>Some casinos just have it easy. SlotoCash Casino is one of those operators that enjoys the overwhelming supports of its community. Our SlotoCash Casino review focuses on everything that makes this brand a top choice for many players. From the transparent terms &amp; conditions to the massive $7,777 bonus package, there is a lot to see and try yourself. The casino is powered by Real Time Gaming and Visionary iGaming and has been around since 2007, standing tall in the industry for over a decade now. If you are just as keen to find out why we enjoy this casino as much as we do, we invite you to take a look at our unbiased review below.</p>
<p>Sloto Cash Casino Pros and Cons: What Makes This Casino Tick</p>
<p>We took a keen eye to Sloto Cash Casino in our review, hoping to upturn every stone and see what lied underneath. The result is a well-balanced online casino with a lot to offer and very few things to improve on. Sloto Cash surely needs a bit of a touch-up, but we hold the benefits to far outweigh the cons, and here is why.</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<p>Powered by Real Time Gaming</p>
<p>Features close to 200 games</p>
<p>Certified for fairness by Gaming Labs</p>
<p>Simple and easy to navigate user interface</p>
<p>Convenient banking methods and speed</p>
<p>Cons:</p>
<p>Support can be slow at peak times</p>
<p>The user interface could use some touching up</p>
<p>SlotoCash Casino Software</p>
<p>At the core of every great casino lies the software solution that makes it tick. SlotoCash Casino started with Rival Gaming as its main supplier of iGaming software, but the company decided to make a switch to Real Time Gaming later on and has stuck with RTG ever since. As a result, the casino features some excellent games that will be fully compatible with Mac and Android, allowing you to enjoy both desktop and download play, but also tap into the mobile experience.</p>
<p>Players who choose to join SlotoCash and have a go at the games will enjoy gaming from a range of devices, including iPhone 10 and 11, as well as earlier makes. There are many Apple iOS devices that will allow you to gain access to the casino. Similarly, you can opt for an Android handheld device, such as tablets and phones.</p>
<p>Many players prefer to load the casino from an Android tablet, which is another option. Real Time Gaming (RTG) has made it very easy to have a great time playing at the casino. Whether it’s Windows, Mac, Android, iPhone, or iPad, you’ll be able to get started at the online casino, claim your welcome deposit and be on your way to some of the finest RTG games. Speaking of the bonus, let’s have a quick look at the welcome bonus, which is one of the largest you will find in iGaming today.</p>
<p>SlotoCash Casino $7,777 Welcome Bonus</p>
<p>SlotoCash Casino has a massive welcome offer tailored to the needs of casual and high roller players in equal measure. You will find yourself able to pick a $7,777 bonus. If you are worried that the wagering requirement may prove too hefty, don’t worry. The bonus is distributed across five separate deposits, and each offering a very good match rate.</p>
<p>While most welcome offers out there will provide you with only 100% of your deposit amount, SlotoCash Casino will match your deposits with anything between 100% and 200%, giving you a great boost. Besides, there are 300 free spins to round up the offer, making it all the more precious.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the promotion is rather easy to claim, too. For each deposit you make, you will need to use a SlotoCash promo code. Your first deposit bonus code is SLOTO1MATCH and it awards a $2,000 cash bonus matched at 200%. The rest of the deposit bonuses part of the welcome package is as follows:</p>
<p>2 nd 200% + 50 Spins $2,000 SLOTO2MATCH</p>
<p>200% + 50 Spins $2,000 SLOTO2MATCH 3 rd 100% + 50 Spins $1,000 SLOTO3MATCH</p>
<p>100% + 50 Spins $1,000 SLOTO3MATCH 4 th 100% + 50 Spins $1,000 SLOTO4MATCH</p>
<p>100% + 50 Spins $1,000 SLOTO4MATCH 5th 177% + 50 Spins $1,777 SLOTO5MATCH</p>
<p>Each promotion will have a fixed amount and a unique SlotoCash Casino promo code you must use to claim the promotion. To claim any of the deposit bonuses, you have to deposit at least $20. The free spins will be available on Pig Winner. Now that we know how to claim the bonuses, let’s have a look at the wagering requirements.</p>
<p>SlotoCash Casino Bonus Wagering Conditions</p>
<p>SlotoCash Casino has a very straightforward approach to its welcome bonus. To claim the bonus, you need to use a bonus code and deposit at least $20. Once you do, your deposit and bonus will both be subject to a 25x wagering requirement.</p>
<p>There is no cap on your winnings, so any amount you win out of each bonus, you can withdraw. However, there is a $5,000 weekly withdrawal limit and a $20,000 monthly limit, so keep this in mind. Any big payouts will still be honored, though, so don’t worry.</p>
<p>SlotoCash Casino Promotions</p>
<p>SlotoCash packs many cool promotions you will find completely worth your while, starting with the welcome bonus we have just discussed, and the daily deals you can claim on your own. The casino has over 20 daily promotions you can benefit from, each with its own unique bonus code. There are even special bonuses to use on progressive jackpots, which makes the experience even better.</p>
<p>It’s hard to pinpoint all of these promotions at first, but they all provide you with valuable bonus funds to use and advance your gameplay at SlotoCash. You will be able to claim various bonus funds in the form of real money as well as free spins.</p>
<p>There is a 35% cashback which lets you focus on the gameplay more so than on cherry-picking the most viable bonus out there. Just get in touch with live chat to request a 35% cashback on any potential losses. Keep in mind that the offer comes with a 10x playthrough requirements you need to abide by.</p>
<p>Comp Points and SlotoCash VIP Program Treatment</p>
<p>Have you been around for a while now? It’s perhaps time to scratch the surface and take a deep dive in the Comp Points system which is put in place to complement your efforts and help you work out more sustainable gameplay. Comp points will be an indispensable ally in your quest for having the best time possible at SlotoCash Casino.</p>
<p>You can use your Comp Points to redeem $1 for every 100 CC you can trade back. As you do, you will be adding to your bankroll in perfect unison with the time and effort you allocate at SlotoCash.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, you can reap additional benefits from your stay at SlotoCash and the VIP program, which will provide you with various perks, including but not limited to a daily bonus ranging between 110% – 150% match and 50 free spins.</p>
<p>As you scale through the VIP levels, you will also be eligible to claim up to 15% cashback bonus and enjoy an expedited withdrawal process and no max bet rule for some additional comfort when choosing to high-roll play. There will be a $50 Weekly Reward for all levels, giving you additional play funds. On Diamond Level, which is the highest one, you will be able to accumulate 1 CC for ever $4 you place.</p>
<p>The VIP program bonuses may take a bit of getting used to, but don’t worry, as you will be able to just read through the terms and conditions and pick the bonus offers you are happy with and want to explore further.</p>
<p>SlotoCash Casino Games &amp; Developers</p>
<p>Powered exclusively by Real Time Gaming, SlotoCash Casino has a lot to show for. Even though it wouldn’t hurt to see more games, with around 200 available right now, the casino has managed to develop a pleasant selection of slots.</p>
<p>You can expect to see a whole lot of slots, table games, video poker, progressive jackpots, and a special section for the “specialty” games, which are a few extra bits and bobs to make your experience more entertaining. All games can be tried as a free game first, and you can even have a quick look into the volatility, theme, paylines, and special symbols of each game before you play.</p>
<p>You will be able to load most of these titles from a mobile device directly in the browser, which is another plus of the experience. Now, let’s have a closer look at what is on offer.</p>
<p>Best Real Money Slots</p>
<p>In case you weren’t sure, Real Time Gaming has a whole lot of awesome slot titles you can try yourself. There is Builder Beaver, Bubble Bubble and Bubble Bubble 2, Count Spectacular, and Dr. Winmore. Cash Bandits is for those who have larceny in their heart but don’t really want to get in trouble with the law.</p>
<p>The slot games available at SlotoCash Casino are fun, they are quick to the touch and offer great betting limits. You will find them both mobile compatible and generous. Many of Real Time Gaming’s slots will actually feature fixed jackpots ranging from anything between $2,000 and $8,000. The lowest sum we saw at the time of our SlotoCash Casino review was $1,512.</p>
<p>If you are looking for bigger payouts, you will be happy to try the real money online jackpots. SlotoCash has Aztec’s Millions, Megasaur, and Spirit of the Inca. The progressive jackpot starts at around $260,000 and goes all the way up to 3,720,512. These numbers will of course change based on when the last jackpot was won, but you can generally expect very satisfactory numbers from the progressive jackpot section.</p>
<p>Top Table Games at SlotoCash</p>
<p>Admittedly, the table games section is a little under-stacked. This is no biggie, but it wouldn’t hurt to see a few more games available. In the meantime, you will definitely not have a dull moment with any of the available casino games. They include Super 21, Pontoon and Blackjack as well as Baccarat, Caribbean Hold’em and Stud Poker. There is Face Up 21 and Vegas Three Card Rummy.</p>
<p>The Largest Video Poker Selection</p>
<p>If the table games section looks a little underwhelming, video poker at SlotoCash Casino includes some 56 games. Yes, you read this correctly. There are 56 games you can pick from at SlotoCash Casino and they are all worthwhile. The average RTP is 99.50%, giving players some unique opportunity to turn a profit.</p>
<p>The available variations include games such as Loose Deuces, Double Bonus Poker, Bonus Poker Deluxe, All American Poker, Jacks or Better, Joker Poker, and quite a few others. You can select from 1, 3, 10, and 52-hand poker.</p>
<p>How to Bank at SlotoCash Casino</p>
<p>SlotoCash Casino makes every part of its offer very simple and easy to access. You will have no trouble banking at the casino. For starters, everything is quite transparent and, more importantly, completely fair. All deposit transactions are instant, with Bitcoin and Litecoin taking up to one hour. You will be able to withdraw and deposit with almost the same methods, but some solutions may be available either as just deposit or a withdrawal, so make sure to check this out when you start.</p>
<p>To carry out withdrawals, you will be able to pick from Bitcoin, Neteller, Skrill, EcoPayz, Courier Check, and Bank Wire. There is a $2,500 limit on each transaction with a $5,000 weekly and $20,000 monthly withdrawal limit. However, you can place as many requests as you wish so long as you request the minimum $25 withdrawal amount and do not exceed the $5,000 weekly limit. Most of the methods will ask for no fees and your payments will be processed within 72 hours. There is, of course, a but here and it concerns Bank Wire and Courier Check. Unfortunately, these two payment options will command a hefty fee ($30-$60), and you may want to avoid them for withdrawals.</p>
<p>Please keep in mind that if you win a sum exceeding the $20,000 monthly limit, this amount will be distributed to you in weekly installments. For exact details on how a big money is cashed out, you can always refer to customer support.</p>

<p>SlotoCash’s high rating among community members is partly owing to the casino’s emphasis on safety, honesty, and the security of your personal information. As a result, you can expect to find a product that has been certified by CDS and has the appropriate SSL encryption. Even though SlotoCash doesn’t have a licensing agreement, the website still draws praise from the player base. There is also a responsible gambling page to make the offer safer.</p>
