    <h1>Hoosier Park Casino Lake Tahoe Casinos Osceola Casino Casino Castles Harrogate Ac Casino Map BetFlag</h1>

<p>BetFlag, one of the most prominent iGaming operators in the regulated Italian market, has been able to secure a second content partnership with a leading supplier in so many days, the company revealed via an email press release and LinkedIn statement.</p>
<p>The company will now feature content by ESA Gaming, an innovative studio that has developed products centred around its unique EasySwipe mechanic, which is a non-traditional content offering which will significantly boost BetFlag’s standout factor.</p>
<p>Bringing fresh content has been a focus for operators and suppliers, with ESA Gaming inventing the EasySwipe products which have been purposefully built as HTML5 mobile-first games that are, particularly lightweight solutions and make for easy and straightforward integration with sportsbooks and casinos. What this means is that BetFlag will get access to a number of sport-themed games, including Basketball Mine, Goal Mine, and Goal Mine World Edition.</p>
<p>ESA Gaming is also bringing its dedicated Rocket Racers game, which is the company’s first shot at offering crash-style gaming to partners. Crash has become synonymous with innovation in the online casino world, with a lot of companies now developing their own products, among which is ESA Gaming.</p>
<p>BetFlag will benefit from this and more. A strong feature of ESA Gaming’s portfolio is its cross-selling opportunities where it creates bridges between the sports and online casino experience, thus increasing the revenue and player lifetime value through the addition of exceptional content. ESA Gaming Head of Marketing Thomas Smallwood has welcomed the opportunity to work with Betflag on this project and further help his company reach new audiences.</p>
<p>"We have recently expanded our content offering, further strengthening the depth of our portfolio with a selection of fifteen games that I’m sure BetFlag’s customers are going to thoroughly enjoy," Smallwood said.</p>
<p>BetFlag Business Developer Laviero Saganeiti noted that ESA Gaming immediately stood out from the list of developers the company had considered. ESA Gaming brings an innovative type of content that features numerous side games and additional features to make the BetFlag’s offer far more engaging, Saganeiti explained.</p>
<p>Only recently, BetFlag pursued a similar content alliance with Blueprint Gaming, another prominent studio that offered its original and branded slot content as part of the operator’s growing library of games and opportunities.</p>
