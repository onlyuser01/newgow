<p>SiGMA Group Moves Europe Show to November</p>
<p>SiGMA Group has decided to move the company’s European show to November 16-18 after Malta’s Prime Minister Robert Abela announced that the government would be closing down clubs, bars, and restaurants. Abela and Malta’s government made the decision after a small surge of new COVID cases. The expo will be held at MFCC, Malta.</p>
<p>Abela assured that his government and he would continue to financially support businesses and the populace despite the need to close down organized gatherings. He further expressed confidence that the country would get better, pointing out the vaccine rollout and his commitment to his country’s recovery.</p>
<p>SiGMA Group founder Eman Pulis expressed his thoughts on the matter and stated:</p>
<p>“We welcome this decision. We believe in the safety of all our delegates. There’s no SiGMA without restaurants, without bars – that’s where all the magic in business networking happens. I look forward to seeing you in November. Save the dates – I’ll see you in Malta.”</p>
<p>The show set for November will feature key niches for the vast gaming markets with expert-led panels where participants will have the opportunity to have a direct line to major brands in the business. The expo will serve as a floor for delegates from more than 80 countries, over half of them from the EU.</p>
<p>SiGMA, together with the company’s brand AIBC will offer large investment opportunities to the emerging tech and gaming sector.</p>
<p>SiGMA Roadshow Brand Line Up</p>
<p>SiGMA has a big lineup of virtual shows and events under the company belt. The first show under the SiGMA Roadshow brand launched in Ukraine on March 3 and showcased its success with SiGMA’s digital events after attracting more than 2,000 delegates.</p>
<p>SiGMA Roadshow is the company’s latest imitative in which it brings the business of iGaming to key regions and stakeholders. The European edition, which is planned to last two hours, will address five region-specific topics such as tax, regulations, and compliance.</p>
<p>SiGMA Roadshow‘s monthly podcast will hold events in 14 countries in Europe, Asia, the Americas, Africa, and the CIS region, having started with the Ukrainian edition earlier this month.</p>
