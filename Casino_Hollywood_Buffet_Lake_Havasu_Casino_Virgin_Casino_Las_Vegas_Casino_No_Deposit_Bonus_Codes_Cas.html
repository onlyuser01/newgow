    <h1>Casino Hollywood Buffet Lake Havasu Casino Virgin Casino Las Vegas Casino No Deposit Bonus Codes Cas</h1>

<p>Hello Casino Guru,</p>
<p>I am writing here as Roobet are not addressing my emails appropriately, so hopefully can achieve resolution through this method. Thank you for all you do, I can see that a number of people in my situation have had good results through this site!</p>
<p>I have been playing at Roobet for under a year from France (where I reside), being able to deposit and withdraw thousands freely up until recently. I was level 2 verified when my account was locked (when I requested a large withdrawal). At this time I had deposited thousands, and had an account balance of between 17,000 - 18,000 USD (I cannot remember exactly, and cannot now access my account to check).</p>
<p>I then received an email saying I had accessed the site from a restricted location and therefore they closed my account and offered to refund my last deposit. As I had not done this, I rejected the offer of my last deposit (c.3500 USD) as I had a big balance of 17k+ in my account, and went on to explain that I live in France which is not a restricted region. I provided the evidence they requested, but they followed up with ‘the documents you have provided do not fulfill the requirements of confirming you have been residing in France during this period’. I asked what else they needed and am still happy to provide this, but they now respond each time with bland emails stating terms and conditions that do not apply to my situation.</p>
<p>As a result, I quite rightly want my full account balance returned to my ETH address (which I have provided to them).</p>
<p>As I work for an international company (UK, Norway, China), I believe I may have accidentally accessed the site whilst connected to my work’s VPN/Intranet which triggered this whole scenario. A harmless mistake, certainly not one that warrants confiscating my 17k+ funds. Even if I did access from a restricted territory, surely that does not warrant keeping all deposits/balances from a player - this is certainly not a standard practice of the industry (that is theft!?)</p>
<p>At this point I have been treated so badly, I would just like my account to remain closed and my account balance returned. As above, I am happy to provide any further documents they would like, but they have not asked for any more. I reference case linked here: https://casino.guru/roobet-casino-player-s-account-has-been-blocked-8 whereby a player actually did place bets from a restricted region (which I have not!) and had their account balance returned to them as a resolution on this site.</p>
<p>I have attached the email chain to this so you can review the conversation I have had with Roobet so far - you can see that they are simply just keeping my account balance with no real justification.</p>
<p>Many thanks, and I hope this can get resolved. I am happy to provide any further documentation you see fit. I would appreciate if my personal details do not get published publicly.</p>
<p>Regards</p>
