    <h1>Wind Creek Casino Wetumpka Alabama Casinos Near Sacramento Casinos Hotels Hotels Near Del Lago Casin</h1>

<p>I received an email on 11/25/2022 with a promotion for a BlackFriday bonus of 150% up to €150..</p>
<p>I deposited €100 and had a wager of €10000. After completing the wager, I still had a balance of €4000 and I got a message on the casino website "Your bonus balance has now been converted into real money"... then I paid out the €4000.</p>
<p>Today I saw that the withdrawals have been canceled and the money won has been removed as well. Only my 100€ deposit were there again.</p>
<p>The reason given by the specialist department was that the bonus was supposedly a reload bonus which I couldn't use at all because I hadn't deposited at least €100 in the last 7 days without a bonus.</p>
<p>Excerpt from the reload bonus terms:</p>
<p>10.3.4. To ensure proper use of bonuses and fair play, Mondcasino consider claiming Friday Reload, Weekend Reload, Free Spins Day or any other bonus marked as "Reload Bonus" without any other clean deposit (ie deposit which is not matched with any bonus) during the last 7 days prior claiming any of mentioned bonus above as bonus abuse.</p>
<p>Players must deposit at least 100€ in clean deposits during last 7 days before bonuses Friday Reload, Weekend Reload, Free Spins Day or any other bonus marked as "Reload Bonus" is claimed in order to be eligible for winnings generated with help of bonus. In case of bonus abuse mentioned above, winnings generated with help of bonus will be forfeited and deposit returned.</p>
<p>As can be seen here, the "Friday Reload", the "Weekend Reload", Free Spins Day or other bonuses marked as "Reload Bonus" fall under this category.</p>
<p>There was no indication anywhere in the promotional email, on the website or when activating the code "BLACKFRIDAY" that it was a reload bonus.</p>
<p>Even the live chat last night when I asked about the bonus didn't give me any information that it was a reload bonus and that I couldn't use it at all.</p>
<p>I will upload screenshots of the email, casino justification etc. here.</p>
<p>As can be seen in the screenshots, there is no "Reload Bonus" or anything else that is written in the Bonus Terms mentioned by the support.</p>
<p>If you click on "Bonus T&amp;C apply" in the promotion e-mail, you will also only get to the general bonus conditions. There, too, nothing says that this bonus counts as a reload bonus or is marked as such.</p>
<p>So it's probably not just me that's affected, but other players as well. The player/user cannot see or realize in any way that this is supposed to be a reload bonus and that it is linked to the terms and conditions of a reload bonus.</p>
<p>Please help. After all, it's about 4000.00 €.</p>
<p>Many Thanks.</p>
