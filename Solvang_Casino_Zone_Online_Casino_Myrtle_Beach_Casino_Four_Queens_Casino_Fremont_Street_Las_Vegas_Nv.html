<p>Lithuania’s Gambling Supervisory Authority continues to enforce its ban on gambling advertising. The regulator fined Gaming Strategy Group, the company behind Betsson brand Betsafe for breaching advertising regulations. Tete-a-Tete Casino caught the regulator’s ire for allowing players located outside of the country to bet via its website.</p>
<p>Betsafe Got Fined for Illegal Advertising</p>
<p>Betsafe found themselves in hot water after Lithuania’s regulator fined them for sending a newsletter to over 10,000 customers, advertising one of their online games, and inviting players to log into their accounts.</p>
<p>Such actions violate the country’s updated gambling regulations. On 1 July 2021, Lithuania banned operators from promoting their services through bonuses, promotions, special events, and other similar campaigns. Gaming Strategy Group received a €25,000 fine for breaching Article 10 (19) of Lithuania’s gambling regulations. The country’s Gambling Supervisory Authority concluded that the newsletter contained promotional material focusing on the game’s features to attract players.</p>
<p>Tete-a-Tete Accepted Players from Abroad</p>
<p>Tete-a-Tete Casino received €15,000 after the regulator found out it had allowed foreign players to use its website and gamble with real money. According to Lithuanian law, all operators who own a license in the country are forbidden to service customers not physically located within its borders. This restriction applies even to online gambling.</p>
<p>The casino received a stern warning in addition to the fine. The Gambling Authority gave Tete-a-Tete a 10 August deadline to implement effective measures and protections preventing players located outside Lithuania from using its services. If the operator fails to comply, its license could get suspended.</p>
<p>Both Operators Have a History of Transgressions</p>
<p>These two cases are not the only instances Betsafe and Tete-a-Tete have received fines this year. The two operators tried circumventing the advertisement regulations in May.</p>
<p>Tete-a-Tete got punished for publishing promotional slogans on its CBet.lt website urging Lithuanian players to bet. In 2021, the casino got sanctioned for organizing gambling outside of gambling regulations and for unreasonable online gambling limits. Its gambling license expires this year, so it would seem wise to stop testing the regulator’s limits, considering its long history of violations.</p>
<p>Betsson’s Betsafe also received a fine in May for allegedly trying to avoid advertising restrictions. The Gambling Authority demanded the operator change some of the wording on its website, which could be interpreted as promoting gambling. The regulator also found fault with the web page containing Betsafe’s history.</p>
<p>The Lithuanian regulator has noted on multiple occasions that its decisions were not final and that operators could appeal their rulings. The country has a very harsh gambling policy, and its Gambling Supervisory Authority has demonstrated its willingness and capability to punish gambling companies who step out of line. Operators Olympic Casino, Baltic Bet, and Top Sport also received sanctions this year.</p>
