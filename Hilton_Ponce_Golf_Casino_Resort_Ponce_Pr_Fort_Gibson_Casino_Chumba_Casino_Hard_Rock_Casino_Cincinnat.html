<p>Thank you for your reply, Milli. To begin with I would like to clarify that if you play with a bonus, your winnings are paid by the casino and not the game provider, as the casino is the one who gives you the bonus.</p>
<p>Moreover, the vast majority of No-deposit bonuses have a maximum cashout limit. Unfortunately, I haven't found any information about the bonus you received on the casino's website, therefore I couldn't check the specific Bonus T&amp;Cs. However, I have found this in general Bonus T&amp;Cs:</p>
<p>"6.10. Some bonus offers may include a maximum winnings multiplier. This means that for example, after the bonus wagering, the equivalent of the bonus sum x10 will be transferred to the real balance."</p>
<p>Clearly, the T&amp;Cs indicate that bonus winnings might be limited in some instances. Provided that most free money bonuses have a maximum win limit and that casinos are free to set this limit as they wish, I am afraid that there is not much more we could do for you.</p>
<p>Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is anything else, I could help you with, otherwise, I will be forced to reject your complaint. Thank you for your understanding.</p>
