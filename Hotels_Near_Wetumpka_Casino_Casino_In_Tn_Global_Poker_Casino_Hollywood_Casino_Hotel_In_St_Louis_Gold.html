<p>Alexandre Pantoja vs. Brandon Royval Odds</p>
<p>Moneyline Odds Alexandre Pantoja -170 Brandon Royval +146</p>
<p>Alexandre Pantoja Favored by Bookies to Defend His Title</p>
<p>Alexandre Pantoja is 26-5 overall, with each of his five losses happening by decision. The most recent of those happened in 2020 and he’s 4-0 since.</p>
<p>During his recent surge, he won two Performance of the Nigh bonuses, with his most recent fight getting crowned the Fight of the Night. More importantly, the fight in question brought Pantoja the UFC Flyweight Championship belt.</p>
<p>He defeated Brandon Moreno by split decision in a fight that saw each fighter land a huge volume of strikes. Pantoja landed 129 significant strikes – his highest number since joining the UFC in 2017. He also made six touchdowns in that fight, breaking another personal record.</p>
<p>Wrestling and grappling are his forte, as evident by the fact that he’s got 10 wins by submission in his portfolio. One of those happened against Royval two and a half years ago.</p>
<p>Brandon Royval Plotting Revenge</p>
<p>Brandon Royval is 15-6 overall, with two losses inside the distance. The first of those was a TKO loss which happened against Brandon Moreno, who later went on to win the championship.</p>
<p>The second defeat was a submission loss to Alexandre Pantoja. This guy is a black belt in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, so beating him by a submission really is a big achievement.</p>
<p>Since that loss, Royval went on to win three fights, winning the Performance of the Night bonus for his most recent fight, which saw him beat Matheus Nicolau with knee and elbows. The KO win is actually what recommended him for the UFC 296 title fight to Dana White &amp; Co.</p>
<p>Alexandre Pantoja vs. Brandon Royval Prediction</p>
<p>Alexandre Pantoja is a -170 favorite for a reason. He’s a better fighter than Royval, which is something he’s already proved in 2021. He beat him once and we’re certain he’s going to do it again.</p>
<p>This time, however, he might not do it by stoppage. Instead, we think this fight is very likely to go the distance with the reigning champ winning the judges’ votes in the end.</p>
<p>Pick: Alexandre Pantoja</p>
