    <h1>Isle Casino Waterloo Oregon Coast Casinos Nugget Casino Wendover Hollywood Casino Hotel Joliet Casin</h1>

<p>The plaintiffs are claiming that the hotel's negligence led to their potential exposure to rabies and subsequent medical treatments</p>
<p>A group of guests from Arizona has taken legal action against the New York-New York Hotel and Casino, situated along the iconic Las Vegas Strip and operated by MGM Resorts International, after a disturbing incident involving a live bat found in their hotel room.</p>
<p>Arizona Family’s Hotel Stay Leads to Rabies Concerns</p>
<p>The lawsuit, filed in Clark County District Court, revolves around an April 2022 stay during which the Rucker family, accompanied by two other families and four minors, were in town for a volleyball tournament. The group from Arizona alleges that they discovered a live bat in their hotel room, leading to their potentially being exposed to rabies and necessitating medical treatment, reported Fox5Vegas.</p>
<p>According to the court documents, Marcus Rucker of the Rucker family was jolted awake on the morning of April 11, 2022, by an unusual noise near the window curtains in their hotel room. He discovered a live bat hanging on the curtains, which he managed to eliminate before placing the deceased animal in a cup, later leaving it in a stairwell.</p>
<p>The lawsuit claims that Marcus Rucker reported the incident to the hotel’s front desk on the same day. However, a critical misstep occurred when the hotel disposed of the bat, rendering it impossible to test. The Maricopa County Arizona Health Department advised Rucker that the bat should have been tested for rabies and, subsequently, the plaintiffs should undergo a medical evaluation.</p>
<p>Plaintiffs Seek Damages Following Painful Injections and Time Off from Work</p>
<p>The lawsuit contends that the Rucker family, along with two visiting children from the other families, had to endure a grueling series of injections to prevent contracting rabies due to their exposure to the potentially infected animal. These injections were described as painful and disruptive to their lives.</p>
<p>The legal action is targeting MGM Resorts, the operator of the New York-New York Hotel and Casino. The plaintiffs are seeking damages of at least $15,000, citing the emotional distress, suffering, medical treatment, lost wages, and time away from work or school caused by the incident.</p>
<p>Despite attempts to reach out, MGM Resorts has not yet responded to requests for comment regarding the lawsuit. The case underscores the importance of proper hotel hygiene and pest control to prevent guests from potential exposure to diseases like rabies, and the lawsuit suggests that hotel policies and procedures in this regard were inadequate and ineffective. The plaintiffs are hopeful that their legal action will prompt improved protocols and prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future. A hearing date for the case has yet to be scheduled.</p>
