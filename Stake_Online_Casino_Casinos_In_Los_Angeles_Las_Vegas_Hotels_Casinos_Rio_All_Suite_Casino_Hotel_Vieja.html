    <h1>Stake Online Casino Casinos In Los Angeles Las Vegas Hotels Casinos Rio All Suite Casino Hotel Vieja</h1>

<p>Hi, I joined this casino seeing it in the list of those you sponsor, I made several deposits until with a deposit of 20 euros I managed to win 3400 euros on a slot, some were replayed and when I reached 3000 euros I decided to pick them up. on February 15th I was contacted via email by the kyc team to whom I provided in detail each type of document or card requested (even a selfie of mine in which I kept my identity card next to my face, absurd). I have had no news since that day. In chat they answer you with preset messages that always say the same thing and my withdrawal is still pending with the possibility of cancellation. Is it possible that this casino takes more than 8 days to process a withdrawal? I'm starting to think that there's a risk that the winnings won't be paid to me and that worries me. I sent 2 emails but I didn't get any response, how do you behave in these cases? Will I be able to collect my winnings? also because I deposited about 300 euros in this casino and I played as many 500/600 from the winnings obtained. I hope you can help me. I thank you in advance</p>
