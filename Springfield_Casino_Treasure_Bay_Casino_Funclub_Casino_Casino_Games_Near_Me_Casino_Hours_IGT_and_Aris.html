    <h1>Springfield Casino Treasure Bay Casino Funclub Casino Casino Games Near Me Casino Hours IGT and Aris</h1>

<p>Global gaming equipment and content provider International Game Technology Plc (IGT) has agreed to sign a complex patent cross-licensing deal with its industry rival Aristocrat Leisure Ltd. The agreement will cover a series of important patents tied to remote game server (RGS) solutions and game features. The financial terms of the deal have remained undisclosed.</p>
<p>IGT Will Provide Licenses for Two Portfolios</p>
<p>IGT’s Global Gaming chief executive officer Renato Ascoli acknowledged the deal was an expansion of a past patent cross-license that the two iGaming giants had been sharing. He also called the fresh expansion a good opportunity to help the gaming industry skyrocket with the help of two of the most valuable portfolios of RGS patents and game features expected to generate top-tier content and superior game mechanics.</p>
<p>The Combined Remote Game Server patent portfolio will provide compelling digital and social gaming content, with the possibility to be sublicensed to interested third parties. The same will happen to the two companies’ Game Feature patents. Eventually, the entire iGaming industry will enjoy the chance to license Aristocrat and IGT patents, as well as the content generated by the mixed RGS portfolios of the two.</p>
<p>On Monday, IGT agreed to acquire online and mobile game provider iSoftBet for €160 million ($174 million) paid in cash, taking its growth plans one step further. IGT also announced it will keep protecting its intellectual property using its own solutions along with expanded partnerships with top suppliers in the industry.</p>
<p>What Will the Two Bring to the Table?</p>
<p>IGT is powered by around 10,500 employees and specializes in the entire array of entertaining and gaming solutions across all existing channels and regulated markets worldwide, ranging from sports betting, digital services, lottery games, and gaming machines.</p>
<p>The company leverages a wide plethora of cutting-edge technologies and constantly invests in innovation to deliver unparalleled experiences that are engaging for players and drive substantial growth for the business. IGT spreads in more than 100 locations worldwide and has close ties to numerous regulators and government bodies, while closely complying with high integrity and responsibility standards.</p>
<p>IGT’s portfolio includes games featuring disruptive innovation including TRUE 4D for multi-sensory slot experiences. It also features the PowerSight technology that allows players to manipulate a variety of gameplay components using eye and head movements. Stinkin’ Rich and Haywire! Extreme are two of the most popular games part of its portfolio.</p>
<p>Australia-listed Aristocrat counts over 7000 employees and spreads across 23 locations in 326 jurisdictions. The global gaming giant is constantly focused on creating leading content and technology while publishing fresh mobile titles that can be played for free. Aristocrat also strives to be a leader in responsible gaming, struggling to raise the bar in terms of sustainability, company governance, and the well-being of employees.</p>
<p>Their mission also revolves around bringing joy into the lives of passionate players through the power of play. Their game portfolio is created by a talented team and consists of games with vivid graphics, unparalleled mechanics, and excellent performance. Dollar Storm is an Aristocrat game voted Top Slot Product at the Global Gaming Awards in 2020. At the end of February, Hector Fernandez was appointed Aristocrat’s new chief executive officer, leading its land-based product and service development.</p>
