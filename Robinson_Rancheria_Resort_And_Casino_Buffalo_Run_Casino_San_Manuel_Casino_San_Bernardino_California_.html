    <h1>Robinson Rancheria Resort And Casino Buffalo Run Casino San Manuel Casino San Bernardino California</h1>

<p>Dear Ned,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem.</p>
<p>Firstly, I would like to clarify that we are not a "License operator". Casino.Guru is an independent online casinos database which acts as a mediator resolving players’ disputes.</p>
<p>Secondly, please allow me to explain a difference between closing an account and a self-exclusion:</p>
<p>Some casinos use lots of tools for responsible gambling and I would not mention them here. What a player can do if they’re unhappy in the casino: Close the account or self-exclude themselves, that's the two basic choices.</p>
<p>Closing an account is simple and has almost none impact - player can reopen account anytime, and casino has no obligation to the player.</p>
<p>On the other hand, self-exclusion does and is usually connected closely with player’s gambling issue. If the player successfully makes a self-exclusion the casino agrees not to open this account or if yes only under particular circumstances. (after cooling off period and this cannot be done for players who’s are addicted/with gambling problem)</p>
<p>In the case of self-exclusion, if casino failed in this, the player may ask for a refund.</p>
<p>I have checked Responsible Gaming section on the website, and this is what I found https://slots.io/help-center/help-terms-and-conditions/responsible-gaming:</p>
<p>"Self-exclusion requests must be made by email from the account’s registered email address to our customer support department at compliance@slots.io. Requests made via Chat cannot and will not be actioned. However, a customer support agent will direct you to our customer support email service."</p>
<p>Unfortunately, if you have requested an account closure because you were dissatisfied with bonus program and later decided to reopen your account, I’m afraid there is not much we can do for you.</p>
<p>Please let me know if there is any additional information that I have overlooked, but I’m afraid I will be forced to reject your complaint. Thank you in advance for your reply and understanding.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
