    <h1>Casino Real Money Online Akchin Casino Casino Chandler Az Odawa Casino Mackinaw Crazy Time Casino Li</h1>

<p>Hi Guys,</p>
<p>sorry it’s taking me so long to get back yes now I have run it up to over three grand. I left the 2200 and asking for them to cash out and I had saved some back to play to continue playing. I won another 1785 and I never went to cash it out but they took it out and put it with the 2200 so I couldn’t play anymore and said managers of approved yet. So when I emailed them and said OK so you’ve approved my cash out of 3700 I didn’t really ask you to cash the other part out but you took the money I was playing with and put it in the cash out that it’s been approved. But you guys are not gonna pay me out is what the agent I talked to said this time said no that I played baccarat and I don’t even know how to play baccarat amount even know it at all I’ve never played it once in my life and that’s the reasoning that they’re not gonna pay me as I’ve played back right when I when I shouldn’t have on a bonus blah blah blah they are so crooked , they are so full of it all they want is our money and they have no intention of giving you what is rightfully yours and what you have rightfully won. They are a big scam!!!! They are happy to get back to you on chat and talk to you and tell you how you’re not gonna get your money. And I have all these little loops So they’ll talk to you about how you’re not gonna keep your money out but that’s it that’s it you’re not there their and they’re just hoping for new people to come in and buy in with their stupid 400% bonus crap Because they know they’re never going to pay you or pay out so they can have the largest bonus percentages that they give you because it monies just going to stay there. I’ve taken screenshots of my money in the cashier before they can take it away from me and say I never had it but they won’t let me play with what I’ve won so far I can’t even put it back in the casino and play with it they’ve taken him from me. And send me bonus codes and stuff asking you put $50 in and I’ll give me 400% bonus! They suck 100% and a lot of them do! Bovada is the best as far as payout you can get paid out in Bovada within an hour. So raging Bull no more</p>
