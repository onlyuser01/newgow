    <h1>Sam S Town Hotel And Casino Las Vegas Magic City Casino Monte Casino Casino Winner L Auberge Casino</h1>

<p>After securing a gaming license in the Netherlands earlier this year, LeoVegas announced the launch of its services for Dutch customers</p>
<p>The leading international iGaming company, LeoVegas Group, continues its European expansion. The company confirmed on Wednesday that it launched its services in the regulated gambling market in the Netherlands. As a result, Dutch customers can now access engaging online casino games at LeoVegas.nl.</p>
<p>The recent launch comes after LeoVegas secured a gaming license earlier this year from the Dutch gambling regulator, Kansspelautoriteit (KSA). The license from the KSA enabled the operator to introduce its services in the country, becoming a part of this important regulated gambling market on the Old Continent.</p>
<p>Thanks to the latest launch, customers in the Netherlands can tap into sports betting, live casino and online casino games offered by LeoVegas. The company, renowned for the quality of its games, revealed that its portfolio in the country will feature localized titles with Dutch-speaking live casino croupiers.</p>
<p>Additionally, Dutch clients of the operator will have the option to access some of the most popular and entertaining slot games. Fans of sports betting that tune in with LeoVegas will be able to access supreme experiences thanks to competitive odds. Overall, the strategic market entry seeks to further propel the operator’s presence in Europe while at the same time, delivering unrivaled experiences for Dutch customers.</p>
<p>The Company Is Delighted to Launch in the Netherlands</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, 2023 was a busy year for LeoVegas. The company expanded its presence to multiple jurisdictions and signed important deals with famous soccer clubs in Europe. For example, LeoVegas launched its iGaming and sports betting brands in Germany, the UK, as well as Denmark. Moreover, it penned deals with soccer clubs, including the famous Newcastle United FC and Manchester City FC.</p>
<p>Through such collaborations and expansion, LeoVegas is able to reach new customers and raise awareness of its brand, complementing its global growth. Ultimately, the company anticipates becoming a global provider, offering exceptional betting and iGaming experiences.</p>
<p>“The King of Casino is finally home in the orange kingdom! I am delighted that we are taking steps into the Dutch market.“ Gustaf Hagman, CEO of LeoVegas Group</p>
<p>Gustaf Hagman, LeoVegas Group’s CEO, revealed that it is thrilling to see the company go live for customers in the Dutch market. Additionally, he praised LeoVegas’ efforts and success in the country and across Europe. Finally, Hagman predicted that by combining exceptional content, a popular brand and a strong platform, LeoVegas would soon become one of the leaders in the regulated gambling market in the Netherlands.</p>
