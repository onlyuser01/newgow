    <h1>Hard Rock Hotel And Casino Sioux City Tulalip Resort Casino Bordertown Casino And Rv Resort Casinos</h1>

<p>The platform and specialist for betting and gambling industry software solutions has struck a new deal with Ainsworth Game Technology (AGT) in a bid to strengthen its overall iGaming footprint and standing</p>
<p>This new partnership allows NuxGame to deploy AGT’s full portfolio with NuxGame’s clients, bringing more innovative casino slot titles to their game libraries. AGT has been building up a solid reputation in iGaming space and has repurposed its land-based casino experience to create compelling products that are now taking the world of online casinos.</p>
<p>Creating a Stronger Casino Portfolio Suite</p>
<p>NuxGame will now be able to offer its partners a range of experiences, including AWP Machine titles such as Mad Millions and Fortune Tree. Another great addition to the portfolio here is the Super 7’s series, which were designed to appeal to both land-based and online player bases.</p>
<p>NuxGame is happy to have further boosted its reach in the industry, adding further capacity to its product offering and portfolio. Presently, NuxGame offers a 360-degree iGaming experience with Affiliate Systems, Website API, Sportsbook and Online Casino products offering which are further strengthened by the integration of AGT’s full portfolio.</p>
<p>The new partnership follows similar arrangements that were previously negotiated with Amigo Gaming and Turbo Games. Commenting on this opportunity, NuxGame CEO Daniel Heywood said that AGT was bringing another layer to the strong online casino portfolio product.</p>
<p>He hailed the excellent land-based-inspired slot games that are now becoming a part of the regulated market. “NuxGame is always on the lookout for new partners that will meet our customer’s needs and we anticipate continuing to deliver impressive results through this agreement with AGT,” Heywood said.</p>
<p>NuxGame has been working hard to strengthen its overall proposition. In March, the company announced a series of core platform updates designed to boost its operational capabilities and deploy even quicker solutions to partners.</p>
