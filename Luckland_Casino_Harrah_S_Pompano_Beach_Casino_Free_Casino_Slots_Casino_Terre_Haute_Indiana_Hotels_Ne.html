<p>Being the second favorite to win the 2022 World Cup, it’s no surprise Argentina is expected to finish in the no.1 position in Group C. This is the group in which the biggest underdog for the trophy competes as well. The team in question is Saudi Arabia, whose fans don’t have too many reasons to be positive ahead of the Qatar tournament.</p>
<p>And what about the fans of Mexico and Poland? These two are going to battle for a spot in the World Cup playoffs, but who’s going to get there – Mexico, Poland, both teams?</p>
<p>Those are the questions we’ll try to answer in this piece, so keep on reading!</p>
<p>2022 World Cup Group C Winner Prediction – Argentina (-213)</p>
<p>The fans of Argentina have every right to dream big in 2022. Not only do they have Lionel Messi as their capital (along with a number of other talented players), but they also have a relatively easy path to the later stages of the 2022 World Cup.</p>
<p>If they win Group C – which we think they will – Lionel Scaloni’s boys will likely to avoid playing against a Top 5 favorite until the semifinal.</p>
<p>Knowing this, you understand why they’re going to give their utmost to finish top of their group. That shouldn’t be too much of a challenge, though, considering that the other three Group C teams just aren’t as good as Argentina.</p>
<p>Group C Runner-Up Prediction – Mexico (+175)</p>
<p>Online bookmakers think the race for the no.2 spot in Group C is going to be incredibly intense. The evidence is that they’re giving +175 both on Mexico and Poland to finish second. So, which team will it be?</p>
<p>Our pick is Mexico, the main reason being that we just love the way Mexicans play. These guys play attacking-minded soccer and aren’t afraid of anyone. You can be sure they will be on the front foot in all three games of the group phase.</p>
<p>Will it work out? It will against Saudi Arabia; it won’t against Argentina. But what about the game with Poland? We think it might finish in a tie, but a better score differential will take the Mexicans to the knockouts.</p>
<p>Best Group C Prop Bet – Highest Scoring Group (+500)</p>
<p>We think Group C is going to be the highest scoring group of the 2022 World Cup. In fact, we think this is one of the best World Cup prop bets available. First of all, the bet comes with amazing odds. Most online sportsbooks are giving +500 on this prop.</p>
<p>Secondly, we think this bet is very likely to win. The thing is that with Messi as their captain, Argentina is likely to score a lot of goals in every match of the Qatar tournament. We also think Mexico will score a lot of goals, especially in the game with Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>Actually, one of the top reasons why we think “Group C – Highest Scoring Group” is almost 100% sure to win is that Saudi Arabia is one of the worst teams in the World Cup. These guys are going to get ripped apart by each of the other three teams from the group.</p>
