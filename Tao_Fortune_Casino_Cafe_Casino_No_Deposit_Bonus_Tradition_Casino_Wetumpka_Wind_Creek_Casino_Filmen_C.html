    <h1>Tao Fortune Casino Cafe Casino No Deposit Bonus Tradition Casino Wetumpka Wind Creek Casino Filmen C</h1>

<p>Hi there.</p>
<p>At bet3000.com one wonders why this casino has the audacity to charge a fee of € 5 from the 4th payment per week.</p>
<p>Even if they put this shit in their terms and conditions, it is not legitimate but embezzlement. After all, they don't share in the losses.</p>
<p>Secondly, I noticed that the very sluggish and not really customer-friendly support does not really take serious customer complaints seriously.</p>
<p>So I complained several times by email that automatic roulette refused a partial bet that would have won in the respective game.</p>
<p>It was not the compl. Bet refused, so that naturally resulted in a loss for me as a player. The whole scenario twice in a row with a total loss of € 50. Would the compl. I would have completed both games at a profit.</p>
<p>I am still waiting for a usable response from bet3000.com</p>
<p>EXTREMELY striking is the phenomenon in automatic roulette that the player almost always wins with small bets on 2 columns. However, if you raise the bet to, for example, € 15 twice, the tide turns in favor of the casino. It is almost a miracle that the player wins.</p>
<p>This gives food for the supposition that the game providers are using illegal game recognition software on the bet3000.com platform. These are not short-term experiences but based on a game result over several months.</p>
