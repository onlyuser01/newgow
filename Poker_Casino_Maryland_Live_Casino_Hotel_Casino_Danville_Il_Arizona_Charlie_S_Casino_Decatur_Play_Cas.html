    <h1>Poker Casino Maryland Live Casino Hotel Casino Danville Il Arizona Charlie S Casino Decatur Play Cas</h1>

<p>This lousy shitty casino has written to me after ages that I won't get my money back</p>
<p>FRAUD HIGH 10 I can only advise EVERYONE never to pay in there and not to register there</p>
<p>if you win the bet will simply be voided and that's it</p>
<p>They write such SHIT here</p>
<p>"Hello, tobias ,</p>
<p>I am writing to you regarding your request.</p>
<p>As I can verify, our responsible team has completed the investigation with the game provider and we have received this information.</p>
<p>"According to the information in the game server log, you" reversed "your bets placed in the round at the Arabic roulette table that was played on December 7th, 2021 at 17:14:35 UTC. Therefore you do not rate any participant in the round. "</p>
<p>"According to the log data from the game server, you tried to take part in the round at the roulette table that took place on December 7th, 2021 at 21:01:10 UTC. You have placed your bets totaling EUR 53.00 and the game provider's system has started a withdrawal request, but has not received a response from the server side of your casino (your account). In addition, the call to reimburse the withdrawal was started and we received a positive response from you after the game was already resolved. Afterwards, the bet cancellation was started by our system in order to refund unsuccessful betting attempts to your credit, and it was successful. "</p>
