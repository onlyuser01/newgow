<p>UEFA has opened disciplinary cases against Real Madrid, Barcelona, and Juventus – “the Super League rebels,” who created the Super League project and could now receive bans from the Champions League.</p>
<p>UEFA Takes Legal Action against the Last 3 Super Leaguers</p>
<p>On Tuesday, UEFA said that it has now moved towards legal proceedings over the potential violation of its framework. The three clubs that are being prosecuted at the moment are Real Madrid, Barcelona, and Juventus. They have possibly breached UEFA’s statutes, including a section of “prohibited groupings,” meaning that clubs aren’t allowed to form leagues without UEFA’s permission.</p>
<p>The Super League project, founded by 12 members, including Atletico Madrid, Chelsea, Arsenal, Liverpool, AC Milan, Manchester United, and Tottenham, was launched on April 18. The top clubs of England, Spain, and Italy agreed to form a new lucrative competition to a Swiss-style format, featuring 10 games in group stages.</p>
<p>Nine Clubs Agreed to Settle with UEFA</p>
<p>The “Super League” was killed by reprisal from all sides, including threats of legislation by the UK government and severe backlash from fans. The project died within the next 48 hours of its creation. The other 9 clubs who founded the project settled with UEFA and agreed to forfeit 5% of their prize money from European competitions in the 2022-2023 season.</p>
<p>The clubs agreed to receive a fine of $122.5 million if they decide to play in an unauthorized competition. UEFA’s prize money for a successful season in the Champions League is around the same amount. The clubs also agreed to be fined $61.2 million if they violate their commitment to UEFA again.</p>
<p>Rebel Clubs Took Legal Action against UEFA and FIFA</p>
<p>The three rebel clubs that are being prosecuted, are the ones who refuse to renounce it. They took legal action against UEFA and FIFA in Madrid. A judge has asked the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg to consider if restrictions on the rebel clubs are breaking European Union laws.</p>
<p>Although all three clubs are qualified for the Champions League, next season, UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin said that if the clubs call themselves “Super League,” they won’t be able to play Champions League. The Champions League group-stage draw is on August 26. Matches will begin on September 14.</p>
<p>UEFA didn’t provide a time frame for the disciplinary cases. Bans and elevation of other Italian or Spanish teams to replace the clubs could lead to appeals at the Court of Arbitration for Sport.</p>
