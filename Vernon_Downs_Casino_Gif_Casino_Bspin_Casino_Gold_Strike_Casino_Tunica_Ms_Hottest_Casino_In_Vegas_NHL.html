<p>The award-winning and leading business-to-business (B2B) sports gamification company, Low6, announced a new partnership with theNational Hockey League (NHL). Announced last week, the new deal sees the League designated Low6 as its official free-to-play gaming provider. As a result, the duo agreed to leverage digital solutions and innovation to help drive fan engagement and deliver unique experiences for hockey fans around the world.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the new deal, Low6 will power free-to-play games that are expected to serve "as a second screen interactive experience to captivate hockey fans globally," a statement reveals. The collaboration comes as no surprise, considering the common values that the duo shares in terms of digital innovation and fan engagement.</p>
<p>At the same time, the new collaboration builds a positive momentum gained recently. It was back in December when the first NHL-Low6 free-to-play game called "NHL PrePlay" was introduced in collaboration with Bet99, a popular online sports betting company in Canada.</p>
<p>The game boosted fan engagement for Canadian hockey fans by allowing them to make predictions throughout the NHL season. NHL PrePlay gave fans a chance to win CA$100,000 ($73,800), as well as smaller prizes such as weekly ticket giveaways and NHL shop gift cards.</p>
<p>Low6 also helped create Pepsi Zero Sugar NHL Goalie Challenge game, another NHL free-to-play game that enabled fans to pick NHL goalies and guess if they will get a win. The free-to-play game featured an interactive element that saw players "dropping cans of Pepsi on which goaltender they thought would earn a shutout."</p>
<p>Additionally, the NHL and Low6 have launchedother games in the last few months. Those titles included NHL Winter Classic, NHL Stadium Series, NHL Stats Streak, NHL All-Stars bingo, as well as the 2023 NHL All-Star Fan Vote. Fans of the League can also tap into the 2023 Stanley Cup Playoffs Bracket Challenge and the upcoming 2023 Stanley Cup Final Bingo game.</p>
<p>Jamie Mitchell, the Co-Founder and CEO of Low6, shared his excitement about the new deal saying: "We are thrilled that Low6 has been selected as a free-to-play games provider for the NHL." He added that in the next two years, in collaboration with the League, Low6 will deliver innovative games that are expected to drive fan engagement.</p>
<p>Finally, Mitchell said: "We look forward to working with the NHL and their commercial partners in activating revenue throughout our gamification suite."</p>
