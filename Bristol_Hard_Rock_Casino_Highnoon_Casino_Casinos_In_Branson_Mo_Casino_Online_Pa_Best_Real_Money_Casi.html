    <h1>Bristol Hard Rock Casino Highnoon Casino Casinos In Branson Mo Casino Online Pa Best Real Money Casi</h1>

<p>On January 13, Rootz launched Wheelz Casino, its third iGaming brand, and announced a collaboration with David Hasselhoff. Rootz aims to ride the wave of its successful Wildz and Caxino platforms.</p>
<p>Third Online Casino Brand for Rootz</p>
<p>Malta-based iGaming operator Rootz unveiled its third brand, Wheelz Casino, as well as a partnership with showbiz star David Hasselhoff last Wednesday. Wheelz follows Wildz, released in July 2019, and Caxino, released last summer.</p>
<p>The new online casino was built on Rootz’s innovative and flexible gaming platform. Wheelz will feature a “colorful and engaging interface,” the operator said, on top of seamless navigation and live prizes. Rootz promised “uncharted levels of player customization” for its new opus and teased dealer-dealt live-streamed table games, as well as hundreds of slots games.</p>
<p>Collaboration with the Hoff</p>
<p>Rootz also announced a collaboration with Baywatch actor David Hasselhoff, who will become the brand ambassador for Wheelz Casino.</p>
<p>A series of TV ads celebrating the launch of the platform will feature the Hoff, and Rootz announced dedicated bonus games featuring Hasselhoff will be launched on Wheelz.</p>
<p>The Malta-based company said it “[pulled] off a major coup in the capture of Hasselhoff,” with “arguably the biggest global star ever to represent an MGA-accredited online casino”.</p>
<p>Built on Rootz’s Innovative Platform</p>
<p>With a customer-focused approach, Rootz developed its own tools for iGaming platforms, with automated and highly functional systems.</p>
<p>Wheelz will feature those systems “with their influence felt across all key areas of the business, such as AML and rewards,” the operator declared. Payments on Wheelz will be extremely fast, Rootz said, “supported by robust processes developed over time”.</p>
<p>With a license issued by Malta Gaming Authority, Rootz provides its services to various operators, including Yggdrasil, NetEnt, or Evolution Gaming, to access most big markets across the globe.</p>
<p>Rootz received multiple nominations at Malta’s Gaming Excellence Awards (MiGEA) 2020. Chief Marketing Officer Melanie Hainzer was nominated for Malta’s Best Woman Leader of the Year Award, while the company was nominated for Malta’s Best Technology Provider of the Year Award, and Wildz Casino was nominated for Malta’s Best Online Operator of the Year Award.</p>
<p>Rootz went home with home with the award for Malta’s Best Online Operator of the Year.</p>
