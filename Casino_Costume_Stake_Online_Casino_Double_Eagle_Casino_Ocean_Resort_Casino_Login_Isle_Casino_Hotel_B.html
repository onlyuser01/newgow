<p>Kalamba Games has announced the release of Blazing Bull Remastered, the sequel to its popular 6x4 game series launched in 2020</p>
<p>Next-generation data-informed business-to-business supplier of innovative casino games and promotional tools Kalamba Games has announced the launch of a much-anticipated sequel to one of its most iconic series.</p>
<p>Blazing Bull Remastered has seen the light of the day three years after the launch of the first Blazing Bull title which took place in March 2020, followed by Blazing Bull 2, the second game in the series released in 2021.</p>
<p>The new slot that counts 4,096 ways to win introduces a spectacular free spins bonus with a progressive feature, three different HyperBet levels during the base game, and up to 5x Wild Multipliers.</p>
<p>The studio knows the true value of sequels to iconic titles. Last May, the company released the sequel to another popular slot, Goblins &amp; Gemstones.</p>

<p>Once Again, in Search of the Mystical Blazing Bull</p>
<p>Kalamba players who are familiar with the series will get the chance to once again set foot on the exciting bull chase adventure in the North American fields. There, they will be accompanied by their spirit animals (eagles, bears, wolves, cougars) ready to guide them every step of the way toward the big wins.</p>
<p>Besides the night-to-day scenery-changing feature that the studio is known for, the game also introduces the HyperBet feature which allows players to customize their gaming by selecting a preferred free spins frequency and level of multiplier wilds.</p>
<p>Provided players manage to land a minimum of three silver bonus symbols while engaged in the base game, they trigger the Silver Free Spins game with a Wild Multiplier of up to 5x.</p>
<p>A minimum of gold silver bonus symbols are responsible for activating the Gold Free Spins game that also features Wild Multipliers of up to 9x. The size of the multipliers is established by the level of the HyperBet. Both the Gold Free Spins and the Silver Free Spins count up to 30 free spins.</p>
<p>“A Delight to Bring New, Fresh Features to the Game”</p>
<p>As explained by the company’s chief operating officer and co-founder, Alex Cohen, the team was delighted to add innovative features to the original slot while bringing it up to date for returning players as well as players who have never tried the game before.</p>
<p>Cohen praised the theme of the Blazing Bull game that has already spawned two sequels, calling it one that has allowed the development crew to let its creativity run loose. The new release also comes with a Buy Bonus feature that counts four different purchase options. Last October, Kalamba Games announced it would strengthen its global presence by providing its content to Pariplay via the latter’s Ignite Studio development platform. In September 2022, the company partnered with Bragg Gaming for its official launch in the Canadian province of Ontario.</p>
