<p>The National Football League (NFL) Players Association (NFLPA) acquired a stake in Monkey Knife Fight (MKF), the daily fantasy sports (DFS) operator ranked third behind the big boys DraftKings and FanDuel.</p>
<p>Fastest Growing DFS Operator in North America</p>
<p>The NFLPA announced it entered into an exclusive long-term and multifaceted partnership deal with the fastest growing DFS platform in North America MKF and One Team Partners (One Team), a business endeavor utilizing the collective power of world-class athletes and looking to provide access to athlete rights.</p>
<p>“Monkey Knife Fight has always distinguished itself from other gaming platforms by letting fans play contests that are focused on their favorite athletes. Our relationship with the NFLPA will allow us to connect fans to players on a whole new level. We are looking forward to this landmark partnership.” Bill Asher, Founder and CEO, Monkey Knife Fight</p>
<p>The deal means NFLPA is becoming a strategic owner in MKF, the operator which is the official licensee of the association in terms of daily fantasy sports. The arrangement also involves a long-term licensing agreement, commitment to join forces in marketing initiatives and player involvement regarding a broad range of MKF’s activities.</p>
<p>“With this deal we have taken another large step to solidifying the role of players being collectively involved in businesses that partner with their sport. Monkey Knife Fight is an innovative daily fantasy provider that already has partnerships with some NFL teams and we are thrilled with the opportunity to build onto that platform for fans across sports.” DeMaurice Smith, NFLPA Executive Director and Board Member, OneTeam Partners</p>
<p>Athletes’ Rights Protection</p>
<p>One Team, the business endeavor which helps athletes maximize the value of their name, image and likeness rights through its relationship with world-class players associations, is entering this partnership to rectify the underleverage of athletes by DFS operators historically.</p>
<p>“This is the perfect timing for this partnership. Professional athletes have historically been underleveraged by DFS companies despite athletes being the predicate for these games’ existence. In Monkey Knife Fight, we’ve found a partner that is unique in what it offers to fans and also understands the immense influence and value that athletes can deliver, especially as a challenger brand competing with industry incumbents.” Ahmad Nassar, CEO, OneTeam Partners</p>
<p>The acquisition in MKF and the arrangement with One Team Partners shows the determination of the association to deliver on its strategic purpose to protect players and player rights. In July, the NFLPA entered into a problem gambling initiative with Epic Risk Management and GVC Foundation US, to allow former NFL players to attend responsible gambling and sports integrity sessions.</p>
