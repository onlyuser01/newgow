    <h1>Murphy Nc Cherokee Casino Extreme Casino Free Chip Grand Fortune Casino Silverton Casino Hotel Las V</h1>

<p>Hi!</p>
<p>I joined PinUp a short time ago. I made some bets, nice odds, all right. As soon as I signed up for PinUp, I verified my account with my ID, proof of address and selfie holding the document.</p>
<p>I made some bets and after a few weeks I requested a withdrawal of 100 BRL to my Pay4fun account. All right. I received it correctly.</p>
<p>On the 10th of November 2021, I requested a withdrawal in the amount of 932.00 Brl and, to my surprise, it was not authorized. I contacted the chat and was informed that I would have to send additional documents. All good!</p>
<p>The following documents were requested by email:</p>
<p>. copy of my identity</p>
<p>. Selfie with my ID in hand</p>
<p>. Selfie with my identity and my PinUp account screen in the background</p>
<p>. Model my phone that the photos were taken</p>
<p>. Latitude and Longitude where the photos were taken</p>
<p>. Date and Time the photos were taken</p>
<p>Although I have never seen these requests, send them all and, after two days, they have been accepted. However, they asked me for a new document: my electricity bill from my home. Submit the document and it was also accepted. However, now I've been asked for a copy of my mobile operator's contract, registered with PinUp. I found this absurd, because I don't see any sense and it is something confidential, however, I sent a copy of the contract, with my number registered with the Operator with my signature.</p>
<p>My complaint is:</p>
<p>For me, it's clear and evident that they don't want me</p>
<p>pay. Asking me for absurd and unimportant documents to make a payment.</p>
<p>It's the famous: They're rolling! Well, they have no reason or anything to say for not making the payment.</p>
<p>From what I see here at Casino Guru, there are already other complaints about the same practice with other users.</p>
<p>I would appreciate your help.</p>
<p>932.00 Brl, for me, is a lot of money.</p>
<p>I appreciate the help in advance.</p>
