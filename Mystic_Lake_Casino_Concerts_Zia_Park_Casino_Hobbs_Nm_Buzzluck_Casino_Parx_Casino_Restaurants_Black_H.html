<p>Global online sports betting operator bet365 continues to make strides in North America and is now officially live in the state of Kentucky. The sportsbook is celebrating its launch with a variety of tempting offers for fans.</p>
<p>Bet365’s launch in the Bluegrass State was made possible by its partnership with Sandy’s Gaming and Racing, a local gaming company. This launch will further expand bet365’s US presence, allowing it to establish a foothold in a sixth state. For reference, bet365 currently offers betting in Virginia, Ohio, New Jersey, Iowa and Colorado.</p>
<p>Bet365 started accepting registrations and deposits from local consumers 30 days ago, allowing them to prepare for the operator’s eventual launch. Starting today, Kentuckian players can finally log into their accounts, commencing their sports betting journey with the operator.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, new customers of legal age can register to benefit from the operator’s tempting new customer offer: Bet $1 Get $365 in Bonus Bets. As the title suggests, the promotion allows punters to earn $365 in bonus bets if they wager at least $1 with the operator.</p>
