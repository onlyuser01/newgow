    <h1>Bally S Casino Nj Mgm Casino Detroit Caf Casino River Casino Pittsburgh Casino In Buffalo TheScore B</h1>

<p>TheScore Bet has received a responsible gambling check iGaming accreditation from the Responsible Gambling Council (RGC) in Canada. This marks the first private operator to have received the distinction in the province of Ontario as the country is opening up to single-event sports betting.</p>
<p>Accreditation That Guides the Industry</p>
<p>Through this accreditation, theScore Bet has been able to receive a thorough evaluation of its internal responsible gambling processes. This includes monitoring and management of the existing strategy and recommendations for improvement.</p>
<p>Thanks to the RGC, private operators will have a way to verify if their efforts draw from the best practices in the industry. It would also give policymakers the basis to compare what companies have achieved a good standard of customer protection level through their offerings, and what have not.</p>
<p>It would similarly help gambling providers strive towards those same standards and players to be protected from gambling harm. Commenting on this milestone, theScore Bet CCO Josh Sidsworth said:</p>
<p>“Receiving RG Check Accreditation demonstrates our unwavering commitment to responsible gaming. We elected to undergo RG Check Accreditation to ensure we are positioned to deliver the best and safest possible experience for our players.” theScore Bet CCO Josh Sidsworth</p>
<p>Sidsworth noted that theScore was proud to be completing this accreditation which enables the company to operate with confidence in its home market of Ontario. It also allows deepening the company’s existing relationship with the RGC.</p>
<p>Protecting Consumers in Evolving Betting Market</p>
<p>TheScore is confident that this opportunity would allow it to drive its responsible gambling messages home and establish itself as a leader in RG practices in Canada. The accreditation was welcomed by RGC CEO Shelley White who added:</p>
<p>“Congratulations to TheScore Bet on achieving RG Check Accreditation. This achievement is a strong demonstration of Penn National Gaming’s leadership in responsible gambling and prioritizing transparency, player education, and harm minimization in TheScore Bet’s operations.” RGC CEO Shelley White</p>
<p>As most burgeoning gambling markets, responsible gambling has been a particularly sensitive topic for policymakers. The long-postponed availability of single-event sports betting was no doubt hindered by the lack of clarity on how the liberalization of the industry would impact players.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, White believes that the RG Check Accreditation is a powerful tool in creating a gambling industry that puts players front and center and eradicates harm.</p>
