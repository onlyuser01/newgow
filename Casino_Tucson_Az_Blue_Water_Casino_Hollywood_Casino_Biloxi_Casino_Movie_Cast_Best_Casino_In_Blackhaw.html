<p>Wild Cherry Blast Slot Review</p>
<p>With plenty of paylines, a special Berry Bonus, rewarding respins, and a dedicated Juicer Machine, Wild Cherry Blast is a 5×3 video slot from Nucleus Gaming that mixes the classic, fruity theme with innovation. The studio has opted for a unique approach: instead of putting the focus on the standard individual spins of the reels which is the case for the great majority of fruity slots in the industry, Nucleus has included the Juicer Machine to add progression to the action.</p>
<p>The game is also packed with Explosive Wilds and free spins, counts 75 paylines, and has a maximum win capped at 225x. If you want to know more about this 2019 title that clearly pushes many of the boundaries that you might be familiar with so far, check the rest of our online slot review for Wild Cherry Blast.</p>
<p>Theme, Storyline, and Graphics: Get Ready for Some Juicy Wins</p>
<p>At first sight, the fact that the studio has chosen one of the oldest themes for a slot might seem a bit peculiar, given the innovative character of the game. Nonetheless, after careful assessment, we discovered that the classic fruity one-armed bandit theme manages to build a pleasant type of familiarity while promoting its creative and innovative elements.</p>
<p>The story revolves around a futuristic backdrop colored in an eye-catching raspberry shade sprinkled with fork lightning and threatening clouds announcing an imminent storm. The somber setting isn’t located either in space or in the sky, but it packs a lot of explosive energy. The symbols preserve the same edgy feel of the overall theme, with beautiful intricate designs that are quite realistic compared to other similar fruit machine slots in the industry.</p>
<p>The shining diamonds and mouthwatering, blueberry, raspberry, blueberry, and pears are complemented by a ubiquitous set of letters and numbers that are bursting with fresh, tasty fruit juice. The fruit-related theme also includes plenty of space explosions of flavors, and, of course, the juicer machine.</p>
<p>Wild Cherry Blast: Game Symbols and Payouts</p>
<p>The bets are rather limited, ranging from a low stake of 0.40 up to 20 which is the maximum stake. As expected, the Diamond symbols are considered the highest-paying symbols in the game. Players who land five of them will collect the maximum win of the base game which is capped at 6x.</p>
<p>The game counts 11 additional symbols with different values on the paytable, along with two special symbols. The low-paying symbols are represented by the standard card icons ranging from As, Ks, Qs, Js, 10s, and 9s. The maximum payout for five-of-a-kind of each of them except for the As is set at 0.6x the line bet. As pay 1.20x the bet while the mid-value symbols list five types of fruits: strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, blueberries, and gooseberries. Landing three strawberry symbols will trigger a 0.30x payout. Matching four of the same symbols will score players a 0.60x payout while five symbols will trigger a 2x payout. Five raspberry symbols trigger a payout of 1.80x while five blackberry, blueberry, and gooseberry symbols generate a win of 1.20x each.</p>
<p>The game counts 75 different paylines, a particularly generous number compared to other slots.</p>
<p>Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The game‘s edgy theme and overall feel are nicely complemented by the carefully chosen soundtrack. The latter consists of crackling, contrasting music that was given a tune that resembles game shows. The sound effects are represented by adrenaline-pumping cherry bombs heard ticking and finally exploding on the reels. The animations are mostly represented by the moving Cherry Bomb counter.</p>
<p>Wild Cherry Blast Gameplay</p>
<p>Wild Cherry Blast lets players easily adjust the volume of the background music and turn the sound effects on and off as desired. Their gameplay is made even more enjoyable by using the rest of the available options in the “i” (information) section, where the studio has included the detailed rules of the game, the complete paytable with all the symbols and their values, and the additional game settings such as the Autoplay feature and Turbo mode for players who do not wish to waste any precious time waiting for the standard reel spinning to occur.</p>
<p>To adjust their bets, players must rely on the standard bet box that takes up most of the surface of the bottom control panel where the “+” and “-” buttons are located. To blend the fruits and start grabbing some wins, players need to simply hit the Spin tab.</p>
<p>Wild Cherry Blast: Juicer Machine, Free Spins, Cherry Bombs &amp; Double-Up Features</p>
<p>The slot encompasses a good number of bonus features, including:</p>
<p>Juicer Machine. This feature can drop randomly at any moment during the game, dispersing explosive wild symbols on the reels. The latter will stay in their positions for 10 rounds, then they will explode and eventually turn into standard wild symbols. Once this occurs, players get a free respin.</p>
<p>Free Spins. The wild symbols will also act as free spins symbols. Players who come across them are rewarded free spins and they receive up to 10 more wild symbols on the reels.</p>
<p>Cherry Bombs. This is by far the most explosive feature of the game. The studio has included two different types of Cherry Bomb symbols. One of them reveals just one bomb while the second displays two bombs. Players who manage to land the second bomb symbol will see it explode outwards to uncover free spins or scatter symbols for additional wins. Both of the cherry bomb symbols can pop up at any time while the Free Spins round is engaged, potentially triggering high-value super wilds along with super scatter symbols.</p>
<p>Double-up feature. The game also has a gambling, double-up feature which allows players to gamble either half or all of their winnings. If they correctly guess the outcome of a coin spin, their winnings are doubled in size.</p>
<p>Final Thoughts</p>
<p>Wild Cherry Blast by Nucleus Gaming is a classic fruity-themed slot that packs innovative bonus features. The Juicer Machine draws most of the attention since it can be engaged at any random moment and bring players additional spins. The Double Up gambling feature is also equally interesting while the cool design and soundtrack complement the experience for fans of the genre.</p>
