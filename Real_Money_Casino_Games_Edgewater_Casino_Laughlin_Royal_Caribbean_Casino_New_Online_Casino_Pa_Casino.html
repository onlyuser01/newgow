<p>Roobet’s Chief Ganjaroo is back with a brand new and exciting promotion that will mark the “dopest day of the year” - 4/20 or the day of marijuana and cannabis consumption</p>
<p>Snoop Dogg, the famous rapper and promotional maverick, has been a part of online casino Roobet’s team for a while now. As the casino’s official Chief Ganjaroo Officer, he is participating in the “Make It Rain with Snoop Dogg” campaign which is designed to offer immediate benefits for players at Roobet and help the casino “Snoopify” its offer in a way that boosts engagement and interaction with players.</p>
<p>Snoop Doggy Dogg and Roobet Launch Massive Prize Giveaways</p>
<p>As a result, Chief Ganjaroo and Roobet have launched an initiative that will award more than $420,000 in cash and prizes during the next month as Snoop Dogg celebrates the best day of the year – April 20, a day that commemorates marijuana and is known as 4/20 in slag. To get a chance at a prize, the players would have to try their luck at Snoop’s HotBox, the legendary game that was released in collaboration with Doggy Dogg and the casino to introduce a brand new experience to players.</p>
<p>The game is a Crash-style experience which combines Roobet’s sound game design and Snoop Dogg’s unique voiceover and sound bits. Players stand a chance at winning $100,000 as the grand prize along with so much more, including 100 backstage passes, and meet &amp; greets at upcoming Snoop Dogg shows.</p>
<p>HotBox players will also have the opportunity to get some extra entries into the prize draw, which makes the game even more special. Commenting on this opportunity, Snoop Dogg has welcomed the opportunity to celebrate April 20 with Roobet:</p>
<p>We’re blazin’ a trail, sharin’ the love, and doin’ it Snoop Dogg style. It’s all about surprising the fans and keeping the industry guessing. We’re keeping it 100% Roo. Roobet Chief Ganjaroo Snoop Dogg</p>
<p>Roobet co-founder Matt Duea was similarly pleased with the opportunity to see April 20 celebrate, calling it a company holiday. He added that Snoop Dogg was a perfect addition to Roobet’s commitment to “doing things differently.”</p>
<p>Roobet loves to step outside of the marketing box, Duea said, and Doggy Dogg is helping the casino with that – plus offering an opportunity to players and fans to get something back in return.</p>
