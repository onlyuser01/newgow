    <h1>Tropicana Casino Online Batavia Downs Casino Seven Mile Casino In Chula Vista Resort And Casino Ball</h1>

<p>Most casino heists go terribly wrong, and those that “succeed” usually have consequences for the guilty parties not long after the fact</p>
<p>This is precisely what is happening in the case of two robbers who were arrested in Oxon Hill earlier this week in connection with the robbery at MGM National Harbor Hotel &amp; Casino. Officials at Prince George’s County Police Department have confirmed the arrest and that the two individuals were in custody.</p>
<p>Chips Stolen, Culprits Found</p>
<p>The “heist” itself really isn’t as glamorous or derring-do as it might suggest. In fact, the culprits pocketed an undisclosed amount of casino chips from a table, but it was not a small operation either. Seven people had assisted in the robbery, with two now in custody and the identity of the rest a matter of time to crack, the police assured.</p>
<p>The robbery did see an altercation between the culprits and security staff, the latter of whom got minor injuries in the ensuing fight which allowed the suspects to escape the venue. The recent arrests may tie into other similar cases involving casino chip thefts, although the police did not provide information on whether those cases are related.</p>
<p>Inside Job and Casino Crime</p>
<p>The case of the chip thieves is not the only one of note to take a look at this week. A Rivers casino manager in Pittsburgh is said to have stolen $20,000 from the cashiers’ cage, Penn Live and several other media outlets reported.</p>
<p>The person, Yancy Yeater, 41, of Canonsburg works as a player services manager at the casino and is said to have been caught in the act on surveillance footage earlier this month. The cage is where all the money is handled by the public, and players come to buy chips or cash in their winnings. The theft was first established by the casino’s security staff before being referred to the police.</p>
<p>Bodies Found at Golden Acorn Casino</p>
<p>Two people who disappeared were found dead at the Golden Acorn Casino in a car. The news was confirmed by San Diego police which found the bodies of Melissa and Johnny Soto with both their disappearances and death remain a mystery although a murder-suicide version is being worked on.</p>
<p>The vehicle was found by the US Customs and Border Patrol. Investigation found out that the people had disappeared under mysterious circumstances and those are still being thrashed out by the authorities. The couple was, however, living separately and there was supposedly a domestic violence incident before their disappearance.</p>
<p>It’s said that the man died from a self-inflicted gun wound whereas the woman’s cause of death is being established.</p>
