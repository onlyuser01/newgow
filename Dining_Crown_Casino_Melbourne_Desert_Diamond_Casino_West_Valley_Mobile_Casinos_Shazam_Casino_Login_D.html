    <h1>Dining Crown Casino Melbourne Desert Diamond Casino West Valley Mobile Casinos Shazam Casino Login D</h1>

<p>Good morning</p>
<p>I would like to talk to you about something</p>
<p>13 days ago I made a deposit to you of €100</p>
<p>50+50</p>
<p>I also got a bonus</p>
<p>I managed to make the turnover and won €1,300</p>
<p>I put the money to play from my own account at the national bank, but a third person had sent it to my account because he himself recommended your company to play</p>
<p>We were not together nor did he play from my account</p>
<p>My account is personal and I don't give it anywhere</p>
<p>Yesterday you told me that you closed my account and that I will not get my money</p>
<p>You also told me I was cheating which is not the case</p>
<p>I am telling you the whole truth in detail</p>
<p>I need this money</p>
<p>I fought to be able to get them</p>
<p>I managed to make the turnover you wanted and I won them with my value</p>
<p>Please check it again and find a solution</p>
<p>You told me you would return the €50</p>
<p>I don't want the €50 of my deposit, I want all my money</p>
<p>Please do something</p>
<p>I swear to you that I have done nothing wrong</p>
<p>They just suggested you as a company and I wanted to play</p>
<p>I have several betting accounts and I chose you because I have heard the best</p>
<p>This is the email I replied to the wazamba company</p>
<p>I have all my transactions if you want I can also send you my card so you can see that it is in my name</p>
<p>my issue is that the money I played was sent to me by a friend of mine who recommended the company to me but I played alone</p>
<p>I did not commit any fraud nor did anyone else play from my account</p>
<p>the deposit was made from my card which is in my name I don't understand why it is bad that a friend gave me money</p>
<p>I feel completely wronged and I can't prove the truth</p>
<p>I really need black money</p>
<p>I owe gas for my rent</p>
<p>it was important money that would help me a lot</p>
<p>I also have in many bookmakers and I chose wazamba because they told me it is better</p>
<p>please HELP ME</p>
<p>they told me that they will give me back the €50 of my deposit</p>
<p>I don't want them though</p>
<p>I want my money and let them keep the 50 if they want</p>
