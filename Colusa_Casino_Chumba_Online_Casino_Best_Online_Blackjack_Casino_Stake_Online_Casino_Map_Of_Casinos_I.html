    <h1>Colusa Casino Chumba Online Casino Best Online Blackjack Casino Stake Online Casino Map Of Casinos I</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>originally wanted to pay out 2x 300‚Ç¨ so a total of 600‚Ç¨. According to the casino, a one-off payout is not possible, but only a maximum of ‚Ç¨300 for whatever reason. Unfortunately, the amount has changed to ‚Ç¨400 because I played üôÅ but that's not the problem either. After I received confirmation of a withdrawal request, I was informed by the casino that they wanted this information from me.</p>
<p>Mastercard photo front and back Photo of me with Mastercard and ID in my hand A photo or scan of a document proving the legality of your source of income. This can be a certificate of earnings, a bank statement, etc. Be sure the document shows your first and last name, the name of the organization that issued it, and an employee's seal or signature.</p>
<p>I submitted everything. For point 3, I submitted my payslip as a scan. My address (first name, last name, street, city) was visible. I even left my gross earnings open, which I actually shouldn't have done. I don't think the casino has anything to do with how much money I make a month. The scan also contains my bank details or the IBAN. It also says who my employer is. BUT there is NO SEAL on it and NO SIGNATURE of an employee. I have never had or seen that here in Germany on payslips. That's why I won't give anything else to the casino. The places I have blacked out are information that the casino does not need (information on how my salary is made up).</p>
<p>I'm asking for your support here so that whatever verification it is (the last one wasn't even 12 months ago) get completed and I get my money paid out. Didn't owe me anything. Always paid with the same Mastercard. And again: In my opinion, a casino is not interested in where I get my money from. And if I show it then the information is sufficient as far as my identity and gross salary is concerned.</p>
<p>FYI I live in Germany and not in Puerto Rico as shown here.</p>
<p>Thanks very much.</p>
