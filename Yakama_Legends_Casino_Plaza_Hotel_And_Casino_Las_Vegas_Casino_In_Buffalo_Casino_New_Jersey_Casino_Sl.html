<p>British soccer club Queens Park Rangers and sportsbook CopyBet have signed a partnership with the latter becoming the official betting partner for the team. As a result, CopyBet branding will be visible during the upcoming 2022-23 season, featuring CopyBet branding and imagery across social media channels and on player shirts, an example of which has been shown at the signage of the partnership.</p>
<p>Boosting CopyBet’s Visibility in the UK Market</p>
<p>CopyBet UK business development director Anton Ivanov welcomed the opportunity to be teaming up with Queens Park Rangers. “We are delighted to announce this partnership,” Ivanov said. The company representative confirmed that CopyBet was particularly happy to be involved with what he described as a historic football club in England.</p>
<p>Both Queens Park Rangers and CopyBet stand to benefit from the relationship, Ivanov assured, in what will be an exciting season for both companies. CopyBet’s betting offer is significant, with the sportsbook covering more than 18,000 events daily, offering both in-play and pre-match bets.</p>
<p>Welcoming the news, Queens Park Rangers commercial director Euan Inglis said that the club was similarly excited to be taking on this partnership. Inglis received CopyBet’s unique and innovative betting platform, which features the use of tipsters on top of everything else. The executive added:</p>
<p>Anton and the team at CopyBet have been a pleasure to deal with as we embark on this multi-year partnership, which will include several creative, collaborative initiatives. Queens Park Rangers commercial director Euan Inglis</p>
<p>The partnership will feature digital activations visible on Queens Park Rangers’ social media which will bolster CopyBet’s profile in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>All of this comes on the tail of numerous similar partnerships. Sunderland AFC was one of the latest clubs to team up with Spreadex in a similar partnership that also begins in the 2022-23 season. Dafabet also signed a similar agreement with AFC Bournemouth for the upcoming season.</p>
<p>All of this comes against the somewhat fraught backdrop of the Premier League and British lawmakers’ consideration to suspend front-of-shirt sponsorships. The rumor that this measure may not be effectuated in the latest review of the Gambling Act 2005 caused outrage by the opposition and concerned citizens.</p>
<p>Everton FC clubs even collected more than 20,000 signatures condemning the club’s decision to affiliate itself with a betting company in order to fix its ailing finances.</p>
