<p>The Kansas City Chiefs met with the Philadelphia Eagles for the time since the Super Bowl</p>
<p>The 2023 NFL Week 11 saves the best for last – the final game of the round is the Philadelphia Eagles vs. Kansas City Chiefs MNF game.</p>
<p>The rematch of the NFL Championship game in February is taking place at Arrowhead Stadium, which is where the visitors from Philly have a pretty good record (3-1). However, the last time these two met in Kansas City was more than six years ago. And the hosts won that game!</p>
<p>Judging by the Eagles vs. Chiefs odds, the home team is likely to win again. Bookies, however, think this is going to be a very close game. They’ve set the spread to just one field goal.</p>
<p>Philadelphia Eagles vs. Kansas City Chiefs Week 11 Odds</p>
<p>Spread Odds Philadelphia Eagles +2.5 -106 Kansas City Chiefs -2.5 -114</p>
<p>Moneyline Odds Philadelphia Eagles +120 Kansas City Chiefs -142</p>
<p>Totals Odds Over 47.5 -115 Under 47.5 -105</p>

<p>Kansas City Chiefs to Show Why They’re the No. 1 Super Bowl Favorite</p>
<p>The Chiefs are 7-2 on the season, which makes them the best team in the AFC right now. In fact, the Eagles are the only team in the 2023 NFL that has a better record than them.</p>
<p>Led by the best quarterback in the world, Patrick Mahomes, the Chiefs’ offense is averaging 23.1 points per game. That’s not too bad, but these guys definitely have the potential to do much, much better.</p>
<p>What better way to spend NFL Sunday than by watching every single Chiefs sack so far this season?</p>

<p>What’s interesting is that their defense has been brilliant in the 2023 season. In fact, with just 15.9 points allowed on average, they share the second spot on the list of the best defenses in the league.</p>
<p>In their most recent game, the Chiefs held the NFL’s most productive offense – the Miami Dolphins – to just 14 points. It was Miami’s least productive offensive display since January.</p>
<p>The game in question is interesting for another reason. It took place in Frankfurt, Germany. On Monday, November 20, however, the Chiefs are coming back home to Arrowhead. They haven’t played there in almost an entire month.</p>
<p>Philadelphia Eagles Ready for the Battle of Arrowhead</p>
<p>The last time the Eagles played at Arrowhead was in September 2027. A lot has changed in Philly since then, with only a couple of players who featured in that game still being on the roster.</p>
<p>In 2023, the Eagles are a fantastic team, whose roster is made up of young players who already have plenty of experience with big games. Plus, there are some veterans on the team as well, who tend to show up against tough opponents.</p>
<p>Quarterback Jalen Hurts has been phenomenal in 2023, and so have his teammates from the offensive team – D’Andre Swift, A.J. Brown, DeVonta Smith, and others.</p>
<p>Philly’s defense has also been great, especially against great offenses. The best example is that against the Dolphins, they conceded just 17 points.</p>
<p>Philadelphia Eagles vs. Kansas City Chiefs Prediction</p>
<p>Arrowhead is the Chiefs’ fortress where they’re almost always great. They did lose one game at home this season already – against the Detroit Lions in the 2023 NFL season opener – but they’ve been pretty impressive since. That said, it’s only reasonable to assume they’re gonna do great in the Monday Night Football game of Week 11. Our prediction is not only that they’re going to win, but that they’re going to cover the 2.5-point spread.</p>
<p>Picks: Kansas City Chiefs -2.5</p>
