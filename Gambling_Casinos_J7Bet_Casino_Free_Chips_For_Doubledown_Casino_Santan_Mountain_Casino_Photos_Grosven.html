    <h1>Gambling Casinos J7Bet Casino Free Chips For Doubledown Casino Santan Mountain Casino Photos Grosven</h1>

<p>I have had multiple problems with FortuneClock. For over 2 weeks I have been trying to withdraw my money. I have withdrawn from fortuneclock in the past, but have been unable to for the past 16 days.</p>
<p>They have had a problem from their side where an old withdrawal from September 1st is still listed as "Pending" in withdrawal history. That payment was completed and credited to my bank account on September 1st. Ever since then I have been unable to withdraw any more funds. I had over 900 euros in my account when I wanted to withdraw again at the beginning of September, but I have not been able to. Every time I try and withdraw I get the message "You already have an active withdrawal request." This is wrong though as I have no active withdrawal request as the one that says pending from September 1st was credited to my bank account.</p>
<p>I have spoke on online chat every day since, emailed the payments department, emailed support and spoke on the phone. Still this issue has not been resolved.</p>
<p>To make thing's worse, last night I bet on Aston Villa to beat Burton Albion in the EFL Cup and I should have been credited 73.71 euros. The bet won but I was not credited any money.</p>
<p>The stress I have been caused by fortuneclock has really been hard on me over the past weeks.</p>
