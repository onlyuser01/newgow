    <h1>Meadows Casino Hotel Casino Niagara Hotel Chumash Casino Hotel Four Winds Casino Hotel Casino Worker</h1>

<p>Premier digital game developer Live5 Gaming announced today it is set to expand its footprint in Canada after the Gaming Enforcement and Policy Branch (GEPB) in British Columbia authorized the firm to launch its content in the province.</p>
<p>Entering Second Canadian Province</p>
<p>The approval issued by British Columbia GEPB allows Live5 Gaming the right to integrate its titles, including Sheba, Orb of Osiris, Win in Rome, Minotaur and others, with the British Columbia Lottery Corporation (BCLC).</p>
<p>The integration of the slot games developed by the UK-based developer will happen via Scientific Games, the technology supplier of the BCLC’s PlayNow online gaming brand. It will also power single-event betting via its OpenSports platform for the BCLC, Loto-Quebec and Atlantic Lottery Corporation following the passage of Bill C-218.</p>
<p>Commenting on the announcement, Live5 Gaming CEO Lloyd Butler expressed his content that the company had been approved to launch its popular online slot content with the BCLC and its iGaming website PlayNow. “Our games have been designed to deliver high levels of player engagement and entertainment via thrilling bonus features that offer plenty of big win potential. It has proved to be a recipe for success in countless markets and we believe PlayNow players will enjoy the fun experience our content offers,” he asserted.</p>
<p>Positioning to Take Advantage of Potential</p>
<p>The approval received by the GEPB will allow Live5 Gaming to strengthen its presence on the online gaming market north of the US border by entering into a second Canadian province. In 2020, Live5 Gaming launched its slot titles in Quebec via a partnership with Loto-Quebec that sought to enhance the online gaming offering of the lottery operator.</p>
<p>We believe the Canadian market has significant untapped potential and by applying for and receiving certifications such as this with the GEPB we are positioning Live5 for a long and successful future in the market with our operator partners.” Lloyd Butler, CEO, Live5 Gaming</p>
<p>The addition of Live5 Gaming’s suite of titles will enhance BCLC’s product offering and further help the lottery operator engage with players in British Columbia with games that already proved their value across numerous European markets, including Denmark, Sweden, Malta, Italy, Spain and the UK.</p>
