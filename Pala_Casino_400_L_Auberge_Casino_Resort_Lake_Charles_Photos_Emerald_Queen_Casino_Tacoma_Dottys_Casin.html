<p>The PGA Tour has decided to extend its ongoing relationship with PointsBet with the operator remaining in the position of an official betting partner for another three years. The extended collaboration will feature PointsBet’s live betting odds as part of PGA Tour’s streaming broadcasts on the GOLF Channel and Peacock, as well as NBC broadcasts in the future.</p>
<p>PGA Tour to Continue Collaborating with PointsBet</p>
<p>The synergies between NBC Sports, PointsBet, and the PGA Tour will be even greater given that NBC Sports and PointsBet are already partners. Furthermore, NBC Sports launched simulcast betting options in collaboration with the PGA Tour and PointsBet in January.</p>
<p>Commenting on these developments, PointsBet USA CEO Johnny Aitken said that the company was glad to extend its partnership with the PGA Tour in what he described as a key step forward to provide fans and viewers with the type of content they have been asking for.</p>
<p>“Together, with our partners at NBC Sports, we are at the intersection of golf broadcast and odds integration, an exciting time for bettors and viewers,” Aitken said.</p>
<p>PointsBet is bringing interesting markets to the table in a bid to elicit a stronger response from fans and drive engagement. There will be numerous options for sports bettors to enjoy including total leaderboard odds, hole-by-hole odds, lowest score by group, and others.</p>
<p>Free-to-Play Experiences Coming to PointsBet</p>
<p>PointsBet will also become an Official Free-to-Play supplier for the PGA Tour, featuring a free-to-play game developed by Low6. The game will be exclusive to the PointsBet brand and it will be designed to drive live engagement, leverage the popularity of in-play markets, and award weekly prizes to participants. Low6 has just completed a partnership with the Jacksonville Jaguars as it continues to grow its social betting product.</p>
<p>There will be no restrictions as to how the free-to-play game would work. Viewers and consumers will be able to enter any stages of tournament play and bet on Top-10 and Top-30, winners, and more. There will be a guaranteed prize pool of $5,000 every week, but the game will only release in January 2022.</p>
<p>PGA Tour SVP of Media and Gaming Norb Gambuzza has similarly welcomed the partnership and the opportunity to continue working with PointsBet to create innovative sports betting and free-to-play products.</p>
<p>He noted that PointsBet’s golf products have continued to grow and that the new initiative in collaboration with Low6 would add more value to fans who want to enjoy in-play betting contests without necessarily carrying any of the financial risks they imply.</p>
<p>PointsBet will also have access to PGA Tour’s archive of footage so that it can create pre-tournament and post-gaming betting campaigns and advertisements. The sportsbook will also be able to advertise as part of the PGA Tour’s broadcasts, OTT and associated media platforms as well as use the organization’s intellectual property to promote betting on PGA Tour events.</p>
