    <h1>Aruba Marriott Resort And Stellaris Casino Casino Money Golden Gate Hotel And Casino Las Vegas Hotel</h1>

<p>Churchill Downs Incorporated (CDI) announced its fourth-quarter and full-year ended December 31, 2021, financial results posting solid growth year-over-year.</p>
<p>Key Financial Metrics</p>
<p>Casino and horse racing operator CDI posted Q4 2021 net income of $43.3 million, up 153% on $17.1 million registered in Q4 2020. The net income figure was derived from fourth-quarter revenue of $364.8 million, a 31% increase on $278.2 million in the respective quarter in the prior year.</p>
<p>For the full year 2021, revenue amounted to $1.597 billion, posting an increase of over 51% on the $1.054 billion CDI generated in 2020. Net income came at $249.1 million to reverse from a negative $81.9 million in the prior year.</p>
<p>Adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter and full-year 2021 was $127 million and $627 million, respectively, as compared to $79.2 million in Q4 2020 and $286.5 million for the full previous year.</p>
<p>Fourth Quarter Performance</p>
<p>CDI reported net income from continuing operations in Q4 2021 of $43.3 million, up 164% on $16.4 million in Q4 2020. The continuing operations income was impacted by a number of items while some of these negative effects were offset by other items, the company reported.</p>
<p>CDI’s continuing operations’ income was affected by $10.4 million tax benefit related to its net operating loss in 2020 that did not recur in the current year, $4.7 million after-tax increase in the transaction, pre-opening, and other expenses from the prior-year quarter, $3 million non-cash after-tax increase in asset impairments and $0.9 million after-tax increase related to Rivers Des Plaines’ reserves and transactions costs.</p>
<p>CDI partially offset the negative impact via a $2.3 million after-tax increase in the fair value of Rivers Des Plaines’ interest rate swaps (IRSs) and a $1.9 million non-cash tax decrease related to net deferred tax liabilities that did not recur in the current year.</p>
<p>Full Year Results</p>
<p>CDI reported net income from continuing operations for the full year 2021 of $249.1 million, compared to $13.3 million in 2020.</p>
<p>The full-year continuing operations’ income was impacted by $18.9 million after-tax benefit related to the change in fair value of Rivers Des Plains’ IRSs, $1.9 million non-cash tax decrease due to net deferred tax liabilities that did not recur in the current year, and $1 million non-cash after-tax decrease in asset impairments.</p>
<p>The bottom line was partially offset by $13.3 million tax benefit in 2020 tax operating loss that did not recur in the current year, $7.1 million after-tax increase related to the reserves and transaction costs of Rivers Des Plains, and $0.4 million after-tax increase in transaction, pre-opening and other expenses.</p>
<p>Among the company’s key highlights was the agreement reached with Peninsula Pacific Entertainment outside of the reported period for the acquisition of certain assets for a total price consideration of $2.485 billion.</p>
