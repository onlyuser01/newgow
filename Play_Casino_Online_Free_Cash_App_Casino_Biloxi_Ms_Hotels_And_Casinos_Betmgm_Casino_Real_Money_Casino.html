<p>Connecticut continues on its road to broader sports betting and gambling legalization after the Department of the Interior (DoI) approved the gambling compacts negotiated by Governor Ned Lamont and naming the Mashantucket Pequot and Mohegan tribes as the recipients of amended rules for conducting gambling operations on the state’s territory.</p>
<p>The compacts are a step towards the introduction of a more liberal industry that entails online casinos, sports betting, and more. As a result of this final pass-check, tribes will now be able to launch sports betting online as well as operate a sportsbook in retail facilities controlled by them.</p>
<p>Scaling Gambling Across Connecticut</p>
<p>In addition, tribes will be able to expand their offer to feature interactive gambling solutions such as online casinos as well as add fantasy sports. Tribes will be able to run one skin for iGaming and another one for sports betting each.</p>
<p>While the state is admitting more stakeholders in the industry, it will also compete against those operators with the Connecticut Lottery Corporation, also able to run one sport wagering skin outside of tribal territory as well as 15 retail locations that have to be at least 25 miles away from any tribal land.</p>
<p>According to Lamont, this constitutes a critical step in the process towards modernizing Connecticut’s gambling landscape, turning it into a more competitive, “nation-leading marketplace for wagering both in-person and online.”</p>
<p>Lamont shared that he was confident in the new technologies that empower the gambling experience as a sure-fire way to advance the competitiveness of Connecticut against neighboring states that have already been jumping on the opportunity to bring innovation to their gaming industry, and in many cases – start it from scratch.</p>
<p>Tribal Representatives Happy with Progress</p>
<p>Mohegan Tribal Council chairman James Gessner agreed that modernizing the gaming industry would help protect jobs in the state and lead to better tax revenue for the state and benefits for municipal budgets.</p>
<p>“This is not just a regional issue – it will have a statewide impact as Connecticut works to meet critical needs as it recovers from the pandemic. Today is a milestone achievement for Connecticut and its tribal nations,” Gessner concluded, confident that a rapid expansion of the state’s gambling industry is an important step forward for the local economy.</p>
