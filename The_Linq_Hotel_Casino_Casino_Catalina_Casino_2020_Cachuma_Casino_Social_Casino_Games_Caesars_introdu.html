<p>The leading casino-entertainment provider, Caesars Entertainment, announced a new education assistance program earlier this week. Approximately 50,000 team members of the company are eligible for the new program that is called All-In On Education.</p>
<p>The innovative program offers tuition support, student loan debt payments, as well as various learning opportunities. Full-time and part-time entertainment team members at Caesars can benefit from the robust program.</p>
<p>In detail, Caesars said that the tuition support is up to $5,250 annually, while the student loan debt repayment for a new student is also the same amount. Under the program, the employees can benefit from tax advantage funding options for 529 colleges.</p>
<p>Moreover, Caesars employees can take advantage of the Don Carano Legacy Scholarship, named after the famous entrepreneur, restauranteur, and hotelier Don Carano. Recipients of the scholarship can benefit from up to $20,000 distributed over four years.</p>
<p>Last but not least, Caesars explained that eligible employees can benefit from a "vast list of in-network school providers who offer low to no-cost education opportunities with partner schools, plus academic advisory resources."</p>
<p>The recent All-In On Education program launched by Caesars reaffirms the company's efforts to be a top employer within the gaming industry. Besides the program, the company already offers best-in-class healthcare, paid time off as well as family bonding leave. The company's employees also benefit from growth opportunities, discounts and 401k.</p>
<p>In a statement released on May 31, 2022, Caesars' chief administrative and accounting officer, Stephanie Lepori, outlined: "We believe in the power and potential of our Team Members, and we know that in helping them achieve their educational goals, we can shape the future of our company and the communities in which we operate."</p>
<p>She added that employees of the company will be supported on their educational journey thanks to the All-In On Education program. In conclusion, Lepori said: "Whether they're paying off student loans, working their way through school, or tackling an advanced degree, we want our Team Members to know that we are right alongside them every step of the way."</p>
<p>Last month, Caesars announced a new collaboration with Indy 500 and Indianapolis Motor Speedway. As a result, the company's sportsbook was named the official partner of the duo. Earlier in May, Caesars joined forces with MLB's Chicago White Sox.</p>
<p>Founded in 1937, Caesars Entertainment hasn't stopped growing. By now, it has become the largest casino-entertainment company in the US. Besides casino resorts, Caesars holds a leadership place within the regulated sports betting market in the country.</p>
