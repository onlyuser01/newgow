    <h1>Casino In Natchez Ms Casino Royale Vesper Lynd 7Th Street Casino Hard Rock Casinos Silver Oak Casino</h1>

<p>My friend made an account first, but from his mobile and not from my network. He had only connected once from my computer and played before I even had an account where he recommended casinoin to play. I played from my mobile phone and from my computer. From nowhere else. For my casino verification I have sent</p>
<p>photo ID and since they wouldn't accept it I sent my driver's license I have sent a photo of detailed movements from the cards I have made a deposit where it is clearly written who the cards belong to, my address and the number of the cards and my name. Selfie holding the physical card that made the deposit, the identity card and the driver's license against the background of the chat of the conversation with casinoin.</p>
<p>Although I thought it was too much I sent all this and waited at least 5 days until I got an e-mail that only says that they are deactivating my account because they think I have made multiple accounts. this has never happened before and I can prove that the other account that was logged in only once from the computer is my unrelated friend and is a completely different person. The only response I received from the casino after the last message was the same message that it simply said that it is deactivating the account without giving any explanation about it and I turned to you. I hope you can help resolve the issue. I have forwarded you the entire conversation we had with the casino. Thank you for your time</p>
