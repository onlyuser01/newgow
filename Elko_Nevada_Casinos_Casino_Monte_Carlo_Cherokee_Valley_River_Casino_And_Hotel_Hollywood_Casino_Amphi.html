<p>Bragg Gaming Group, a leading supplier of content and solutions for the iGaming industry, has launched with 32Red. As a result of this partnership, Bragg is rolling out its Remote Gaming Server (RGS) content with the UK-facing casino site and will enable 32Red to rapidly scale its offer and bring fresh titles to its library, offering players of the Kindred Group brand new ways to experience iGaming.</p>
<p>Bragg Gaming is bringing a variety of in-house and third-party games which are going to help drive engagement and retention for 32Red. The games are deployed through the dedicated Microgaming aggregation platform, the company explained in a press release. This means that 32Red will get titles from the likes of Atomic SlotLab and IndigoMagic, along with many other worthwhile games that will add to its ever-expanding library of opportunities.</p>
<p>32Red has welcomed this opportunity as it allows it to now firmly consolidate its standing in the UK market and added to its variety of titles and games, making it easier for players to enjoy top products with a strong reputation, excellent features, and captivating themes.</p>
<p>Commenting on this opportunity, 32Red Commercial Operations Manager Adam Newnham said that the entire team at the operator was excited to see the new content added. Bragg brings a comprehensive range of titles that are being rolled out with the UK platform and that provide players with access to many popular options made available by this Microgaming integration.</p>
<p>Newnham confirmed that the company was fully committed to providing players with the best possible experience and that Bragg’s RGS solution would help the company achieve just that. Bragg President and COO Lara Falzon was similarly welcoming of this opportunity.</p>
<p>She argued that 32Red is a leading online casino and one of the best-known operators and brands in the United Kingdom. Falzon was pleased to see her company have the opportunity to bring its portfolio with the operator.</p>
<p>"The go-live announcement comes at a time of important growth here at Bragg with a number of new deals being announced in key European markets," she concluded. Apart from growing its presence in Europe, the company has equally focused on growth in North America.</p>
<p>In recent months, Bragg Gaming Group has signed partnerships with Resorts Digital and Caesars Entertainment, powering the operator’s iGaming offer in New Jersey, United States.</p>
