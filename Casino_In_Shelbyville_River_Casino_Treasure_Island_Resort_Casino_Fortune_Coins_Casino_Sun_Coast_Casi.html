    <h1>Casino In Shelbyville River Casino Treasure Island Resort Casino Fortune Coins Casino Sun Coast Casi</h1>

<p>Hello, dear Casino Guru team, first of all I wish you a nice day. I am voicing the subject in Turkish because I have sufficient English. I started to take bets by registering on the site 1xbet in 2019, I had no problems with investments and withdrawals for a certain period of time. I was making my investments with the currency of Kyrgyzstan, which is the country I was in before, I made a bet with my last investment of 6704,58 KGS and I made a good profit. After that, I requested a withdrawal and my request was cancelled. Then I continued playing again and my initial balance of 100 dollars increased to around 4500 dollars, then I wanted to withdraw and my withdrawal requests were canceled due to the principal rollover and I bet on the roulette area with more than the amount I invested..</p>
<p>In the following processes, my requests were canceled even though I submitted withdrawal requests for all amounts. I contacted live support and they directed me to an e-mail. I made a call via e-mail and it was reported that my money withdrawal was sent to me, but the money was returned by the bank, so I went to the bank and requested information. In the conversation I had with my private customer representative, he informed me that there was no amount received and that there was no such thing as a refund.</p>
<p>After that, I contacted again by e-mail and received a document from the bank and conveyed it to the authorities. I explained the situation to 1xbet officials and demanded the necessary help be provided, but no response was given to me, and I have every mail and withdrawal request images I have forwarded. Even my identity information was requested from me for account approval and they did not make me a withdrawal even though I sent them.</p>
<p>When I reported the situation to the license, I received a response from the authorities and I was asked to shoot with a different method. I reported the situation again, but again, no response was provided and I was forced to play the game. I am requesting your help in this matter. The country I am currently in is a different country and unfortunately I cannot access 1xbet. I know it's been a long time since this topic, but I just saw you guys. Even though I sent my complaints on many platforms before, no response was provided.</p>
<p>Please help me. I wish you a good day.</p>
