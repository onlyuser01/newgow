<p>The leading global gaming company, International Game Technology (IGT), announced it was recognized for its efforts toward environmental, social and governance (ESG) by demonstrating strong performance, according to the 2023 S&amp;P Corporate Sustainability Assessment (CSA). On Monday this week, the company confirmed that it improved its CSA score for the fourth consecutive year, reaffirming its dedication toward ESG.</p>
<p>A statement released by IGT revealed that its most recent CSA score hit 54. The company was one out of 65 businesses that were assessed from the gaming and casino category. In addition to the increased CSA score, IGT was recognized with "perfect scores in the areas of transparency and reporting, emissions, waste, water, and talent planning and analytics," the recent statement explained.</p>
<p>Known as an annual evaluation of companies' sustainability practices, the S&amp;P Corporate Sustainability Assessment probes the operations of more than 10,000 businesses around the globe. The initiative dates back to 1999 and has helped develop sustainability criteria within the environmental, economic and social verticals.</p>
<p>Overall, companies within 61 different industries undergo assessment as a part of the CSA. The assessment score can vary between 0 and 100 points, depending on 20 different sustainability criteria.</p>
<p>Wendy Montgomery, IGT's SVP Marketing, Communications and Sustainability, shared her excitement on the topic. "Achieving an improved S&amp;P Global CSA score for the fourth consecutive year emphasizes the positive impact IGT's Sustainable Play initiatives are making on our people, industry, community and environment," she explained. Finally, Montgomery pointed out: "IGT embraces the significant value ESG programs provide all stakeholders, and we'll continue taking action to build a more sustainable future."</p>
<p>Earlier this year, IGT announced it forged a new collaboration with St. Croix Casinos. Under the terms of the partnership, announced back in August, the company agreed to supply PeakBarTop, its award-winning cabinet that provides options for sports betting and video poker, for St. Croix Casino in Turtle Lake, Wisconsin and St. Croix Casino in Danbury, Wisconsin.</p>
<p>The deal marked the debut of the innovative cabinet for the two St. Croix Casinos, promising to bring thrilling and exciting moments for visitors. Thanks to the agreement, visitors to the venue gained access to sports betting along with other engaging games, including video poker, slots and keno from IGT. PeakBarTop was recognized for its innovation and thrilling experiences after securing the "Land-Based Product of the Year" award from the 2022 Global Gaming Awards.</p>
