<p>Boca Juniors vs. Palmeiras is the semifinal of the Copa Libertadores, the first leg of which is taking place at La Bonbonera in Buenos Aires on Thursday, September 28</p>
<p>Boca Juniors is trying to end the dominance of Brazilian clubs in the Copa Libertadores. Each of the previous four editions of the elite South American soccer competition was won by a team from Brazil – two by Flamengo and two by Palmeiras.</p>
<p>Flamengo is the reigning champion, but this team won’t get a chance to defend the title. Instead, Boca Juniors vs. Palmeiras in one semifinal and International vs. Fluminense in the other one.</p>
<p>Judging by the 2023 Copa Libertadores odds, Palmeiras is most likely to win this year’s trophy. However, before getting a shot at the title, the Brazilian heavyweight will need to eliminate Boca Juniors.</p>

<p>Boca Juniors Veterans Ready to Upset the Odds</p>
<p>According to Transfermarkt, the value of Palmeiras’ roster is more than two times higher than the value of Boca Juniors’. However, the most expensive player in Palmeiras is 17-year-old forward Endrick who hasn’t scored a single goal since the second day of July.</p>
<p>When it comes to Boca’s key men, they’re all much older than Endrick. Some of those include veterans like Edinson Cavani (36 years), Dario Benedetto (33), Facundo Roncaglia (36), Marcos Rojo (33), and goalie Sergio Romero (36).</p>
<p>All of these guys used to play for big European clubs in the past, meaning that they’ve got plenty of experience with big games. These guys know what to do in matches like the semifinal of the 2023 Copa Libertadores.</p>
<p>Palmeiras Seen as No. 1 Copa Libertadores Favorite</p>
<p>Palmeiras is priced at +150 to win the 2023 Copa Libertadores. One of the reasons is that this team won it twice in the last three years. Several players from the trophy-winning seasons are still on the roster, including goalkeeper Weverton, forwards Rony and Raphael Veiga, and defender Gustavo Gomez, who’s this team’s captain.</p>
<p>Palmeiras does have a great squad in 2023, but this team’s players haven’t been too impressive lately. They did win a couple of big games, but we haven’t seen them score more than a goal per game in over a month.</p>
<p>Boca Juniors vs. Palmeiras Prediction</p>
<p>Boca Juniors might not advance to the final, but the Argentine team is almost certainly going to do well in the first leg of the semifinal which is played in Argentina. With the help of their fans, the hosts should be able to grab a win on Thursday.</p>
<p>Pick: Boca Juniors to win</p>
