<p>Relax Gaming - a slots software specialist with a history of growth</p>
<p>Relax Gaming's history dates back to March 2010 when a pair of gaming enthusiasts, Patrik Österåker and Jani Tekoniemi, decided to create some content of their own. They spent the first couple of years quietly building a team, as well as expanding the company's headquarters in Tallinn.</p>
<p>In March 2014, they launched their flagship poker product, with their casino platform and bingo product both arriving the following year - and the trio of offerings fuelled a further expansion: this time with new offices in Malmo, Belgrade, and iGaming hotspot Malta by the time 2018 rolled around.</p>
<p>The company now boasted a team of over 100 employees and set their sights on a first casino game release, Erik the Red, in October 2018, which it launched around the same time as its Silver Bullet program – an initiative designed to build quality industry partnerships.</p>
<p>Since then, Relax has continued to grow. It now gives players access to a roster of over 1,000 casino games — games produced by Relax as well as hundreds from other providers — and two more offices in Gibraltar, another gambling hotbed, and Stockholm. Its presence in Malta and Gibraltar means it holds licenses in both places, as well as the Gambling Commission (GC) and ONJN Romanian certificates to round off an impressive list of regulators for its games.</p>
<p>Note: In June 2021, online gaming operator Kindred Group – already a major shareholder in Relax – acquired the remaining shares for around $384.7 million in a move thought to strengthen the ambitions of both companies.</p>
<p>Relax Gaming casino games and software</p>
<p>Virtual slots form the vast majority of Relax's iGaming stock, and they are known for having engaging video sequences and larger-than-life graphics.</p>
<p>Erik the Red was the first slot they released in 2018, and it has aged well in today's market. It's a Viking adventure that opens with a stirring scene of invading Nordic warriors backed up by a rousing soundtrack. The game itself is played through five reels on one of the ship's masts: the sticky stacked wilds being the standout feature here – this can be triggered through a randomly selected symbol that appears stacked across all the reels. The free spins also offer some attractive bonus features.</p>
<p>Another slot with an impressive video sequence is the company's first-ever branded slot, Let's Get Ready to Rumble. Using a real-life image of legendary boxing announcer Michael Buffer, it calls players to action by using his famous catchphrase – the title of the slot – along with a realistic sequence of a boxing match. Like with many Relax slots, there's a sticky side to things, with some wins triggering sticky free spins. Here, a special symbol sticks in place if it lands on a respin, leading to more spins until no more winning symbols remain. The Title Fight feature, which adds extra an extra four rows to the reels, is the real knockout punch, though.</p>
<p>You can find Relax games other than slots on our database, with blackjack and roulette both accounted for. Both examples have the smooth flow and nice graphics that Relax is known for.</p>
<p>Like with most providers nowadays, Relax makes use of HTML5 technology to ensure that its games run just as well whether on desktop or mobile device.</p>
<p>Speaking of software, the company also offers Relax Apex, an in-house platform that claims to be a 'one-stop' solution offering easy integration.</p>
<p>How to choose the best Relax casino online</p>
<p>Relax Gaming's high level of security standards with its numerous licenses doesn't necessarily mean that the casinos running their games will be as trustworthy. For that reason, it's important that the site you choose is reliable and has your best interests in mind.</p>
<p>But how do you do that? Well, this page is here to help you. You'll find that each casino that appears here has its own rating and review, designated by the Casino Guru team of experts. We assess them according to a number of criteria, which you can find out about in our How we review online casinos article.</p>
<p>You can then use our filters to find the casinos that suit you. Choose the 'Recommended' tab to start with, to see those Relax Gaming casinos that score the highest. These are the best that you'll find online, and give you the highest chance of a good time.</p>
<p>If you're a fan of new online casinos, then you can find those, too. For that, select the 'Newly opened' tab to get fresh options to choose from. The 'All' tab, meanwhile, will give you the full list of eligible sites.</p>
<p>As well as these, there is an extra set of filters that help you arrange the sites in different ways. If you have a preferred payment method, for example, then click your desired option, such as PayPal or Skrill, in the 'Payment Method' section. You can also sort through Relax sites according to the game types they offer, the languages available and also the currencies they allow.</p>
<p>How to find Relax Gaming casino bonuses</p>
<p>Bonuses, bonuses, bonuses: one of the great things about playing in an online casino, if used correctly. Our bonus guide will give you the lowdown on these if you'd like a bit of extra reading about deposit bonuses, or their no deposit counterparts.</p>
<p>You can use this page to find the Relax sites that offer bonuses. Start by going to our list of casino bonuses and choosing 'Relax Gaming' there to see all the available offers. Then, if you'd like to see a particular type, just go the relevant section there. For deposit bonuses, for example, tick the 'deposit bonus' filter. You can get the same options by going to the list of deposit bonuses and choosing the 'Relax Gaming' filter there.</p>
<p>Each option should be relevant as to the date of your search due to the Casino Guru team's hard work in keeping it up to date.</p>
