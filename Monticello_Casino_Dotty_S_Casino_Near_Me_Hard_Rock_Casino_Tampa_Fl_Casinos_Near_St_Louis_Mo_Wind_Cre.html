<p>The provider of innovative online casino games, Stakelogic, announced a new senior-level appointment. The company confirmed Tuesday it hired the services of Edgars Isajevs. Joining Stakelogic Live, he was appointed to the role of Head of Live Casino. In his new position, Isajevs will play an important role and oversee the expansion of Stakelogic Live's offering across the globe.</p>
<p>He brings extensive expertise to the new role after holding different senior-level positions over the last decade. As a part of Stakelogic Live's C-suite, Isajevs is expected to play a central role in the expansion of the company's technology.</p>
<p>Further priorities his Head of Live Casino role carries include overseeing organizational efficiency. Ultimately, Isajevs' appointment complements an ongoing commitment for Stakelogic to deliver thrilling and innovative experiences within the expanding iGaming sector.</p>
<p>In a statement, Isajevs commented: "I am very excited to start with Stakelogic Live." He explained he sees Stakelogic Live as a leading innovative supplier for the online gambling sector. Finally, Isajevs said: "Especially their revolutionary ideas about innovating Live Casino appeal to me."</p>
<p>Stephan van den Oetelaar, Stakelogic's CEO, was similarly thrilled regarding the latest appointment. "After talking with Edgars for 10 minutes, I knew he would be perfect to lead Stakelogic Live," he added. Last but not least, van den Oetelaar pointed out: "His passion for our industry in combination with his profound knowledge of live casino operations make Edgars the perfect executive to strengthen our management team."</p>
<p>Throughout his extensive career, Isajevs has held a number of important roles with leading companies within the gambling sector. Notably, he was employed by Winfinity, Pragmatic Play, as well as Evolution. While a part of Winfinity, Isajevs served as Chief Operations Officer and while he was employed by Pragmatic Play, he served as Head of Operations. With more than a decade of experience in the sector, Isajevs holds a wide range of skills and a deep understanding of technology and live casino operations.</p>
<p>Back in December, Stakelogic grew its presence in Europe after signing a deal with NetBet Italy. Per the terms of that deal, the company agreed to supply some of its most popular titles for NetBet Italy's players. As a result, hit games such as Book of Adventure Super Stake, Candyways Bonanza 2 Megaways and Greedy Fox, among others, reached new customers. While the deal strengthened the operator's offering, it also helped grow Stakelogic's portfolio of partners.</p>
