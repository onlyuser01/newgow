    <h1>The Palms Resort Casino Las Vegas Dreams Casino 200 No Deposit Bonus Codes Casino Bet Inclave Casino</h1>

<p>Dr Carl Brincat is the new chief executive officer of the Malta Gaming Authority (MGA) after its board of governors confirmed his appointment for the role effective immediately.</p>
<p>Appointed with Immediate Effect</p>
<p>The former chief legal and enforcement officer at the gaming regulator would replace departing chief executive officer Heathcliff Farrugia who announced his resignation from the position in October last year.</p>
<p>Farrugia, who informed the board of governors at the MGA about his decision to leave ahead of the expiry of his contract early in 2021 due to his desire to pursue other alternatives in the private sector, had been relieved from administrative duties and placed on gardening leave ever since.</p>
<p>“It is an honour to be selected to lead the organisation at such a critical juncture for the MGA and the industry alike. I am proud of the work that has been done by the Authority so far in raising regulatory standards and committed to ensuring that we continue along this path.” Dr Carl Brincat, CEO, MGA</p>
<p>Before stepping into the position of chief executive officer, Brincat, an expert in criminal law, led the team of lawyers at the MGA and was responsible for strategic decisions on matters in compliance.</p>
<p>“However, it is essential that we cultivate stronger partnerships with other regulators and stakeholders, and the industry itself, to achieve a regulatory environment that accomplishes the MGA’s objectives as set out in the law in the most effective, transparent, and proportionate manner.” Dr Carl Brincat, CEO, MGA</p>
<p>Diverse Experience and Skills</p>
<p>The new CEO has diverse experience and developed a number of skills while leading and advising key committees within the Government of Malta, the statement confirming the appointment released by the MGA outlined.</p>
<p>“Carl sits on the Board of the Financial Intelligence Analysis Unit, and is a member of the Chamber of Advocates (Malta), the International Masters of Gaming Law (IMGL), and the International Association of Gambling Regulators (IAGR).” Official Statement, MGA</p>
<p>In 2020, the MGA continued with its efforts to work in cooperation with other EU regulators and enforcement authorities and introduce new measures to protect sports integrity.</p>
<p>In October, in an attempt to tackle the issue of match-fixing, the gaming regulator introduced a new betting tool, the Suspicious Betting Reporting Mechanism (SBRM), mandatory for all licensees of the MGA.</p>
<p>The SBRM sets the obligation for each sports betting operator to report any suspicious activity to the MGA to allow the regulator track the issues in real-time and respond to any potential threat to the integrity of the game.</p>
