<p>It’s Been a Wonderful Year for Napoli</p>
<p>It’s almost 100% certain that Napoli are going to win the Italian Serie A this year, which is going to be their third title in history, as well as their first since 1990. As if that wasn’t enough, these guys also have a chance to win several other trophies, including the Champions League.</p>
<p>Actually, considering that they have a double-figure point advantage over the second-placed Serie A team (Inter Milan), you can be sure that they’re going to focus entirely on the Champions League.</p>
<p>Even though they got a 2-0 lead from the first leg, they’re going to take Wednesday’s game very seriously. Sure, even a loss by one goal would take them to the next phase of the UCL, but we think they’re going to go for a win.</p>
<p>Eintracht Frankfurt Have No Other Option But to Attack</p>
<p>They’re 2-0 down, meaning that they need to try and win in Naples. And they need a big win. They need to win by at least two goals. That doesn’t seem very likely, but the Germans have no other option but to try.</p>
<p>Luckily for them, Eintracht Frankfurt are fantastic in the offense. In the German Bundesliga, they average around two goals per game. Further, in the group stage of the UCL, we saw them score seven goals in six games. Five of those goals, they scored on the road.</p>
<p>Obviously, they got the quality to score against Napoli in Naples, but do they have what it takes to defend against the Italian powerhouse? We don’t think so.</p>
<p>Napoli vs Eintracht Frankfurt Prediction</p>
<p>Our prediction for Napoli vs Eintracht Frankfurt is that this is going to be a super-exciting game. Both teams are great offensively, and both want to score as many goals as possible on Wednesday. That said, we’re certain we’ll see goals galore in Naples, probably with each team scoring a few times.</p>
<p>But who’s gonna score more? Perhaps no one – this game looks destined to end in a tie.</p>
<p>Pick: Napoli and Eintracht Frankfurt to draw; over 3.5 goals</p>
