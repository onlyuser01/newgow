<p>EveryMatrix, a leading iGaming provider of business-to-business solutions, has had another reason to celebrate this week, with the company confirming the acquisition of a license from the Isle of Man Gambling Supervision Commission. This milestone allows the prominent company to further boost its international reach and expand its products to even more jurisdictions around the world.</p>
<p>The company has welcomed the opportunity to be accredited and certified by the commission, hailing it as a robust custodian of international standards in the gambling industry. Commenting on this opportunity, EveryMatrix CEO Ebbe Groes said that the Isle of Man has one of the most reputable licensing regimes, and it was, therefore, a pleasure for his company to be joining as well.</p>
<p>This licensing agreement is tantamount to a similar permit issued by the Malta Gaming Authority which gave the green light to EveryMatrix’s JackpotEngine in May.</p>
<p>"EveryMatrix is experiencing record growth across all our core areas of casino, sports and platform and securing licenses in both established and emerging regulated jurisdictions is a key part of our future growth plans," Groes said.</p>
<p>A similar tone was struck by Digital Isle of Man Strategic Partnership ManagerNathan Lunt who was excited to see EveryMatrix enter the jurisdiction as a further testimony to Isle of Man’s regulatory regime and its significance internationally.</p>
<p>He also called the licensing regime of the Isle of Man robust and mature. The Isle of Man is also home to some of the most significant companies in the iGaming industry, Lunt added, confident that more big industry players will continue seeking out a license from the Gambling Supervision Commission.</p>
<p>In the meantime, EveryMatrix has been scaling up its presence in international markets. The company has pursued state-by-state licenses in the United States and North America and it presently has more than 200 customers globally. Recently, EveryMatrix acquired a license in Sweden, where the company is keen to continue providing its services under the changed regulatory regime.</p>
<p>The company has been working hard to ensure that it continues to expand globally. The Isle of Man is an important step forward in this journey.</p>
