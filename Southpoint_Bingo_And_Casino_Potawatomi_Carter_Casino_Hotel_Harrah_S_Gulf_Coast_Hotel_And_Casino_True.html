    <h1>Southpoint Bingo And Casino Potawatomi Carter Casino Hotel Harrah S Gulf Coast Hotel And Casino True</h1>

<p>Sportsbook and casino operator NetBet has sealed an agreement with FeedConstruct, a leading provider of sports data that offers innovative data collecting solutions. By signing the new deal, NetBet will be joining FeedConstruct’s prestigious “family of Trusted Partners” that includes names like VBet, OlyBet, and Betsson. NetBet will help FeedConstruct considerably strengthen its foothold in markets of interest.</p>
<p>Why Is BetGuard Important for NetBet?</p>
<p>BetGuard is a trading tool that NetBet will use to maximize its profit and manage risk and exposure to specific challenges in the industry. The tool will also be used to handle trading operations with a series of custom-made options for higher levels of profitability. BetGuard offers access to real-time bet monitoring that NetBet will use to flag suspicious betting behavior or bets that have been placed late. The same tool can calculate the level of risk associated with a single NetBet player while offering complete player and bet risk profiling solutions.</p>
<p>NetBet will also benefit from ongoing performance assessments on all levels, ranging from the market, competition, match, and sports levels. This will further help the operator understand how restrictions can improve its trading while staying secure. BetGuard also provides margin evaluation and management solutions that offer a deep understanding of the business environment. Through the new partnership, NetBet will benefit from better margins and maximized gross gaming revenue.</p>
<p>The New Alliance Expected to Generate Exciting Results</p>
<p>FeedConstruct’s deputy chief executive officer Artashes Sargsyan took the opportunity to bid a warm welcome to the casino and sportsbook operator while praising its success as a company with a focus on offering “safe and secure experiences for its partners”. Sargsyan also expressed the company’s determination to arm all partners, NetBet included, with “reliable quality solutions”.</p>
<p>The respective solutions are meant to ensure the right balance between player engagement and efficiency at an operational level, Sargsyan added. The deputy CEO called NetBet “an operator with considerable reputation and presence”, further describing the fresh “alliance” as “an exciting addition to FeedConstruct’s existing portfolio of partnerships with other companies in the sports betting industry”.</p>
<p>FeedConstruct provides video content and data for the most popular events on the planet. Its mission is to constantly work together with reputable content providers and consumers of top content to generate the best sports data. Its database of clients includes sports betting platforms, leagues, and broadcasters.</p>
<p>NetBet offers a rich selection of casino games including live dealer games, advanced poker rooms, online pre-live and live sports betting options, virtual match betting, and access to global lotteries.</p>
