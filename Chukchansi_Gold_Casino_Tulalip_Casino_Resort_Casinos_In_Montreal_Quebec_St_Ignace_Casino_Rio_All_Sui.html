<p>Leader in sports data and digital content Genius Sports Group (GSG) announced Thursday a renewal for its long-term data technology deal with Australia’s Hungry Jack National Basketball League (NBL).</p>
<p>“With their 2021 season underway and burgeoning reputation as a pathway to the NBA, we’re thrilled to extend our data partnership with the NBL.” Thomas Klingebiel, Commercial Director, APAC, Genius Sports Group</p>
<p>GSG and the NBL Became Partners 5 Years Ago</p>
<p>GSG has been collaborating with the NBL since 2015, seeking to perfect a digital ecosystem in basketball with the league, which managed to establish itself as one of the world’s premier basketball leagues outside of the National Basketball League (NBA) during that period.</p>
<p>“We’re delighted to extend our partnership with Genius Sports Group who have been a great partner of the NBL over many years. The NBL continues to expand its digital footprint across the world and this has been one of the fastest growing parts of our business as a global league.” Brad Joyner, CCO, NBL</p>
<p>For the past 5 years, the NBL has been consistently cranking up attendance numbers and increasing its broadcast and global digital audience, and the introduction of the NBL’s Next Stars program allowed the league to become a viable path to the NBA.</p>
<p>The NBL produced the number 3 in last year’s NBA Draft LaMelo Ball who joined Charlotte Hornets and has been showcasing his potential ever since.</p>
<p>Data Capturing and Distribution</p>
<p>The renewal of the long-term partnership between GSG and the NBL will cover live team and player statistics data captured by the premier live data capturing tool in professional basketball, FIBA LiveStats, to power the official website of the league, as well as live broadcasts, fantasy sports products and other means of engagement with sports fans globally.</p>
<p>The long-lasting partnership between GSG and the International Basketball Federation (FIBA) produced the FIBA Organizer, the CMS tool which will continue to automate and manage the NBL season.</p>
<p>“We believe NBL’s commitment to putting official data at the heart of their entire digital offering has been crucial to their rapid growth in recent years, setting a precedent for basketball leagues and federations worldwide.” Thomas Klingebiel, Commercial Director, APAC, Genius Sports Group</p>
<p>As part of the renewed agreement and seeking to expand the reach of the NBL, GSG acquired non-exclusive rights to capture official live data from the NBL and distribute it for sports betting purposes to sportsbooks around the globe.</p>
<p>The renewal of the deal with the NBL is the latest effort of the data technology group to establish long-lasting sports partnerships, following the deal with the American Hockey League (AHL) in December last year and the exclusive data agreement with Superstar Racing Experience (SRX) earlier this month.</p>
