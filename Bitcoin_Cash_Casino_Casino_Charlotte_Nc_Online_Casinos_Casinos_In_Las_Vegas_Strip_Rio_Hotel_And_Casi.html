    <h1>Bitcoin Cash Casino Casino Charlotte Nc Online Casinos Casinos In Las Vegas Strip Rio Hotel And Casi</h1>

<p>Hello casino guru ,</p>
<p>I had account with lucky dreams and I won the money , over 70k</p>
<p>And I put the loss limit on my account, then I decide to play again I ask them to remove my limit , they told me as a responsible gambling I have to wait 24 hrs before the limit will be removed , I wait 24 hrs limit got removed , I played again that bring my balance up to 112000$ , I ask them to put the loss limit again they took 1 day to that I send them so many emails and request live chat so many times, they finally put the loss limit then again on one night ask again to remove the limit , they saw I have big balance to get paid they remove my limit right away they didn't wait 24 hrs this time and this will end up loosing all my balance and this was remove by one of my family memeber and he had my phone and I close the tab for lucky casino but it didn't log me out so he doesn't need to put the password</p>
<p>But anyways , now I think because they remove my limit rightaway this end up loosing all my balance</p>
<p>They never follow responsible gambling tool this time , they should be waiting for 24 hrs if they would have wait I would not have lost my money and this wasn't even my fault so can u plz look into the case because it involve more then 100k I think it's not right with me because they see I have big balance on my account they never follow the procedure and disable my loss limit right away and they new if player plays more he will loose and then they close my account wen I bring them the issue , can u plz help</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>I have the email that the vip manager Monica send me which she told me they don't feel like to wait to remove the limit , I can forward you that email let me know were I can forward you ,</p>
<p>Thanks will be waiting for the reply</p>
