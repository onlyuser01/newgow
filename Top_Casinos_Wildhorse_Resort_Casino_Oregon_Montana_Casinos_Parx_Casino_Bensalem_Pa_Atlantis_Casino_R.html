<p>Portugal is a very important market for IBIA members, according to the association’s CEO, Khalid Ali</p>
<p>The International Betting Integrity Association (IBIA) announced that it has signed a memorandum of understanding with the Portuguese Online Betting and Gaming Association (APAJO). The memorandum will see the two authorities work together to protect the integrity of sports.</p>
<p>The associations will join forces to protect the sports sector from fraud and maintain a sustainable online sports betting environment. The two associations are related to some of the biggest gambling powerhouses in Europe, providing them with the reach needed to make a change.</p>
<p>The IBIA and the APAJO will discuss areas of cooperation and will plan potential shared projects to achieve their goals. These planned projects will see the two associations pair their knowledge of the sports betting sector to promote viable regulated sports betting in Portugal with high customer channeling, robust player protections and reliable integrity measures.</p>
<p>The announcement comes a week after the IBIA unveiled a new initiative in Canada, aimed at educating Canadian athletes of the dangers of problem gambling.</p>
<p>The Associations Want to Protect the Sports Sector</p>
<p>Ricardo Domingues, president of APAJO’s executive committee, commented on the matter, saying that his association seeks to build and maintain the most beneficial environment possible for customers and operators in Portugal. To that end, it is important to safeguard the integrity of sports as it benefits everyone involved in the legal sports betting sector.</p>
<p>Domingues said that he is excited to work with the IBIA to fulfill his association’s objectives:</p>
<p>We are pleased to enter into this agreement with IBIA, whose extensive work and knowledge in this domain will surely be extremely valuable. We’ll look forward to making our own contribution at the international level for the progress of this industry as a whole. Ricardo Domingues, president of executive committee, APAJO</p>
<p>Khalid Ali, IBIA’s chief executive officer, also addressed the matter, calling Portugal “an important market for IBIA members.” Because of that, maintaining the integrity of local betting products and sporting events is of major importance to the association, he pointed out.</p>
<p>The agreement with APAJO marks the start of a coordinated approach to meeting our shared goals to establish and maintain a dynamic, competitive and well-regulated Portuguese betting market that deters corruption and seeks to prevent customers from being channeled into the unregulated market. Khalid Ali, CEO, IBIA</p>
<p>On a separate note, the IBIA also teamed up with Brazil’s IBJR, a newly-formed body that seeks to contribute to the development of sports and sports betting.</p>
