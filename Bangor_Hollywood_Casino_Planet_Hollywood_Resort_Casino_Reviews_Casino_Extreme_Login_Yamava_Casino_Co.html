    <h1>Bangor Hollywood Casino Planet Hollywood Resort Casino Reviews Casino Extreme Login Yamava Casino Co</h1>

<p>I attempted to withdrawal from Mason Slot 2 months ago but was unable to die to what I was told was a technical issue. I was told they were working on fixing it and I would be informed as soon as they had it resolved, unfortunately while I was waiting I lost the money. About 3 weeks to a month ago I tried again and attempted to withdrawal $1200, but again the exact same problem occured. I was told once again to wait and they will fix the problem, just as they told me a month prior. After about 2 weeks they tell me to use ecopayz or instadebit to make my withdrawal, both of which were not a deposit or withdrawal method option for me. After 3 weeks of arguing with them about what payment methods were available to me, finally ecopayz was an option and they told me to make another deposit using ecopayz, and I did. The deposit did not work and I had to wait 2 days for it to be credited to my account. Now that I had deposited through ecopayz I tried to make a withdrawal, nope didn't work and I was once again told to wait.</p>
<p>Most recently they say they have found a solution and I apparently have used to many payment methods now, after they told me to deposit using ecopayz, so now they tell me to remove cards from my payment methods, I told them to go ahead. I ask when this will be done now and they tell me that my request has been put in queue and they will contact me when this is done. This was not my request, it was there solution to a problem at there casino, that I have already been waiting 2 months for, but there going to put me in queue.</p>
<p>I have probably left a lot out because honestly this has been a back and forth with them for so long it's hard to remember everything, but I have all communication and emails saved and can submit them.</p>
<p>No one should have to wait 2 months to cash out from a casino, and a licensed casino should not have a problem they can't fix when it comes to paying people there winnings.</p>
