    <h1>Harrington Casino Delaware Hard Rock Hotel Casino Paradise Road Las Vegas Nv First Casino In Las Veg</h1>

<p>Hello there</p>
<p>Wagmicasino was always a good place for me, withdrawals worked fine and instantly, max was maybe 1-2 Hours as its crypto.</p>
<p>Now everything changed a few weeks ago they started to delay all withdrawals, and now that I got a big win this is seriously a big issue for me.</p>
<p>Aug 25, 2023 I did a Withdrawal of 1.0 Ethereum, its still pending even after that time period. (Even other withdrawals I made after got paid, at least some of them, but this one still hasnt.</p>
<p>Aug 29, 2023 I did 2 Withdrawals 1x 0.2 and the other was 0.1 Ethereum, never got paid to, still pending.</p>
<p>I contacted livechat daily for updates just to get the same answer over and over again.</p>
<p>LiveChat: I understand your frustration. We all work hard in order to provide you with the best service possible. I'm sorry for any possible inconveniences due to this situation. We're trying to handle the issue as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Yeah thats basicly it, they dont give out any kind of information, sometimes they say its a issue with their payment provider and they work hard to solve it, but nothing ever changes, they just say they are sorry for the delays and thats basicly it. Im waiting for a total of 1.3 Ethereum now. I will upload some Screenshots from the transactions.</p>
