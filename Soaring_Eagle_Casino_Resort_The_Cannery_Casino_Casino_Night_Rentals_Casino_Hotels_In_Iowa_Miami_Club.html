<p>New Jersey continues to keep its fingers on the pulse of gambling in the Garden State, with the state regulator and the Attorney General keen to see a reduction in the overall number of problem gamblers.</p>
<p>The newest report funded by the Division of Gaming Enforcement (DGE) and carried out by Dr.Lia Nower, J.D., Ph.D. from the Rutgers University School of Social Work, Center for Gambling Studies took a closer look at how the state can do more to help those who suffer from gambling-related harm and issues at a time of expansion for the industry, AG Matthew J. Platkin said.</p>
<p>In the newest report, "The Prevalence of Online and Land-Based Gambling in New Jersey," the researchers have taken a harder look at how the industry has changed since 2017, when the first report was conducted by relevant research and regulatory bodies. These reports all have the sole goal of helping lawmakers make better-informed gambling decisions and further give the state teeth in fighting problem gambling risks.</p>
<p>The report found out that the number of high-risk problem gambling dropped to 5.6% from 6.3% and low/moderate-risk gambling dropped to 13% from 15%. However, even this decrease does not bode well for the state just yet. In fact, the newest report indicates that New Jerseyâ€™s rate of problem gambling is three times higher than the national average.</p>
<p>Online-only gamblers have also increased to 15% of the total number of players, and the number of players who bet at both online and brick-and-mortar players doubled to 36% from 19% in 2017. In comparison, the number of online-only players in 2017 was only 5%. The reverse trend was also observed with people who only bet at brick-and-mortar properties falling to 49% from 76%.</p>
<p>DGE Director David Rebuck also commented on the newest report and said that the regulator was fully committed to helping tackle this sensitive issue. The DGE was aware, said Rebuck, that for many people, gambling was a problem and they struggled with it.</p>
<p>That is why the watchdog is now more involved with this particular aspect of the gambling, with Rebuck urging operators and players to "maintain a balanced perspective on gambling" and use additional resources, including self-exclusion, to play responsibly.</p>
<p>However, the report also focuses on different ways that lawmakers can collaborate to introduce policies that could have a beneficial impact on making the industry safer for vulnerable gamblers. NJ Lottery Executive Director James Carrey said that the NJ Lottery is already invested in responsible gambling principles and firmly committed to preventing underage and problem gambling as well.</p>
<p>The report is not a definitive guidance on what needs to be done, but it helps collect useful information that can drive an evidence-based approach in future in a bid to safeguard consumers. All of this comes against a backdrop of increasing revenue in New Jersey.</p>
