<p>Casino Visitor Kidnapped and Robbed</p>
<p>A 46-year-old male was kidnapped in the early hours of Sunday last week. The victim was going back to his Philadelphia home after visiting Pennsylvania’s Parx Casino. The man was just parking his car around 1 AM on Sunday when he noticed that there was a U-Haul van parked nearby, according to WPVI.</p>
<p>While the victim was trying to enter his home, he was approached by three masked men. He recalled that at least two of them were armed. The masked bandits tied up the victim and threw him in the van. Then, the victim was taken to an unknown location where he was kept in a basement.</p>
<p>The masked robbers asked him details about money which he had kept around various locations in his home. The victim was then released by the kidnappers a few miles away from his home. Once the male came back home, he called the police.</p>
<p>Cash, Credit Cards and a Gun Were Stolen</p>
<p>Upon being questioned, the victim recalled that multiple credit cards were missing from his home. His keys, shoes, as well as a gun and an undisclosed amount of cash, were also missing from his home.</p>
<p>Police are yet to determine if the victim was followed from the casino to his home or the robbers waited for him to return to his home. According to the victim, the bandits threatened to kill him if he had contacted the police.</p>
<p>Last month, a separate incident involved another Parx Casino visitor. The 54-year-old male had visited the casino and was then shot and killed. The victim was Sree Aravapalli, who was followed from the casino to his home in Plainsboro, New Jersey.</p>
<p>The crime happened after Aravapalli had won approximately $10,000 at the casino. Police suspects that Jekai Reid-John, a 27-year-old man from Pennsylvania was responsible for the murder. Reid-John was charged with first-degree murder for allegedly shooting Aravapalli.</p>
