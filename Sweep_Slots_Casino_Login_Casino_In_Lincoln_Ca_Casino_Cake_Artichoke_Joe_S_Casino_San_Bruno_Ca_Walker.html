<p>British sportsbook Betfred has marked its latest expansion in the United States, after the company made a joint statement with Scientific Games that the pair will be launching a digital and retail sports betting product in Pennsylvania with the help of Wind Creek Casino, Bethlehem.</p>
<p>Betfred Teams Up with Scientific Games for PA Launch</p>
<p>Starting as rumors, Scientific Games and Betfred made an official statement on Wednesday, February 5, announcing their entry into Pennsylvania, one of the busiest online gaming states in the United States. The two companies are pooling their efforts and partnering up with the Wind Creek Casino in Bethlehem to bring digital and retail solutions by the summer of 2020.</p>
<p>The pair will also launch a dedicated online sports betting product under the Wind Creek Casino skin and just ahead of the NFL 2020/2021 season. Commenting on the developments, Betfred Group COO Mark Stebbings argued that Scientific Games was the obvious choice for the collaboration in the Keystone State, citing the company’s OpenSports platform:</p>
<p>“OpenSports provides best-in-class, reliable technology and services that will help us reach more players and grow our sportsbook presence at speed.”</p>
<p>OpenSports by SG will help players to bet remotely and have access to an intuitive sports gambling product. The pair will not just limit themselves to digital wagers, offering retail betting kiosks as well and adding Don Best Sports data feeds.</p>
<p>SG SVP Sportsbook and Digital Keith O’Loughlin welcomed the news, arguing that Betfred is one of the best companies in the digital betting space, citing the company’s UK track record so far. Their expansion in the US, O’Loughlin explained, is bound to drive growth:</p>
<p>“Betfred is synonymous with giving UK customers a great value proposition, and we are confident that they will get great traction in the U.S. with this customer-oriented approach.”</p>
<p>Thanks to the partnership, SG will also be able to push forth with all expansion efforts involving the company’s OpenSports platform.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Scientific Games also signed another landmark partnership with FanDuel, agreeing to another US expansion.</p>
<p>A Strong Push in the United States</p>
<p>So far, Betfred has sealed a number of high-profile partnerships in the United States at a time when the market in the United Kingdom and Europe is shrinking or coming under heavy regulatory measures.</p>
<p>Previously, Betfred teamed up with Saratoga Casino Black Hack to apply for a license from Colorado and launch a sports betting product in the state. Earlier this week, the company also launched its sportsbook with Grand Falls Casino &amp; Golf Resort in Larchwood, Iowa.</p>
<p>British sportsbooks have been actively seeking a way into the U.S. market following the so-called FOBTs ban at home that has prompted many betting shops to close. Meanwhile, the United States is looking at some 20 legalized states where sports betting is most likely going to be permitted by the end of 2020.</p>
<p>According to the American Gaming Association (AGA), sports betting handle more than doubled in 2019 compared to 2018.</p>
