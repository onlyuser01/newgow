    <h1>Casino Jizzle Directions To The Nearest Casino Boulder Station Hotel And Casino Boulder Highway Las</h1>

<p>Greentube has announced a major recruitment drive for 2021, which the company will use to further bolster its already impressive growth.</p>
<p>Over 100 New Employees Joining Greentube in 2021</p>
<p>NOVOMATIC Interactive division Greentube announced on Wednesday a growth plan for the upcoming year. Greentube plans on expanding its labor force and commercial strength by hiring over 100 new employees in Austria, Malta and Slovakia in 2021.</p>
<p>The company’s recruitment drive is the next logical step in its expansion plan and comes after a year of substantial growth. In 2020, Greentube managed to achieve growth in all of its business segments, expanded its product offerings in Spain and launched promising partnerships that prime it for continued expansion in the coming year.</p>
<p>Of particular note is Greentube’s recent partnership with AI solutions provider Neccton. Through the deal, Greentube launched Neccton’s Responsible Gambling (RG) solution, which aims to improve consumer protection by identifying erratic gambling behavior.</p>
<p>New Opportunities and New Faces</p>
<p>Greentube expects continued growth in 2021, which will be fuelled in part by its entry into the German gaming market and the launch of its RGS platform. Both moves would present substantial opportunities for the company’s B2B and B2C segments and would complement the growth push generated by the planned recruitment drive.</p>
<p>Overall, the online and mobile gaming operator plans on filling positions in a variety of departments across its Vienna headquarters and other key offices in Europe. This includes Development, Project Management, Key Account Management, Casino Operation and more.</p>
<p>Greentube also intends on strengthening its platform development and operations units by recruiting thirty talented developers into its new development center in Belgrade. The team will be situated in a modern work space of 300 sqm in NOVOMATIC’s office, right in the heart of the city’s thriving business area.</p>
<p>Management Confident in Company’s Future</p>
<p>Greentube CFO/CGO Michael Bauer stressed that 2020 was a fantastic year of growth for the company. He also expects the growth trend to accelerate in the coming year once the German and Dutch market regulations kick in as this would enable the company to launch B2C and B2B entries into even more markets that it is already active in. Not only that – Mr. Bauer also stated that Greentube will also attempt to enter the US market as a games supplier.</p>
<p>Mr. Bauer continued: “For us to benefit from these opportunities, we are committed to investing in our workforce. We are always on the lookout for gaming industry professionals and talents who will help shape our future. I can only recommend to anybody interested in being part of this success story to reach out to our HR.”</p>
