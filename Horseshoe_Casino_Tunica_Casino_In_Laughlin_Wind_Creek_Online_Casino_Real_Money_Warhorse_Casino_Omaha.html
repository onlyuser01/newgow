    <h1>Horseshoe Casino Tunica Casino In Laughlin Wind Creek Online Casino Real Money Warhorse Casino Omaha</h1>

<p>Top online and mobile gaming developer and NOVOMATIC’s interactive division, Greentube, has expanded its presence in Italy by acquiring Admiral Sport, an important domestic gaming operator that had been operating under the NOVOMATIC wing for more than a decade.</p>
<p>Greentube Expects the Acquisition to Cement Its Leading Position in Italy</p>
<p>By securing Admiral Sport in Italy, Greentube plans on further strengthening its presence on the Italian territory. Admiral Sport provides betting and casino gaming services in the country under the umbrella of the AdmiralYes brand and operates over 100 sports betting facilities in the country. The operator is operated by NOVOMATIC Italia and represents one of the most appreciated and reputable online and retail brands in Italy.</p>
<p>NOVOMATIC Italia’s chief executive officer Markus Buechele expressed his satisfaction regarding Admiral’s development and steady growth. He also added that, with Greentube’s guidance, the operator will manage to step on the gas and double its market share. Greentube considers Italy a critical regulated online gaming market in Europe and wishes to use Admiral Sport’s results as a foundation for its future plans here.</p>
<p>However, this is not the company’s first acquisition of the Italian land. Last November, Greentube took over Capecod Solutions, a domestic gaming developer that was also part of NOVOMATIC Italia. This way, Greentube found a way to further enrich its portfolio of games while attracting the pioneer aggregator pole to its plethora of online offers.</p>
<p>As a result of the new acquisition, AdmiralYes will turn into the second business-to-consumer brand that will be operated by Greentube in Italy, with Starvegas being the first one. Admiral Sport is also responsible for introducing the first-ever self-service mode to Italian sports betting shops.</p>
<p>Greentube’s Ongoing Expansion in Europe and North America</p>
<p>The popular slot creator with employees in over 50 countries worldwide has signed a series of similar partnerships and acquisition deals with numerous operators on the European and North American markets over the last years. Accordingly, Greentube’s expansion has been a consistent one thanks to the acquisition of Casino Barrière Montreux in Switzerland in mid-February, the company’s debut on the Ukrainian market via its deal with First Casino in August, last October’s debut on Spain’s CasinoBarcelona.es platform, and its entry on the Michigan market on February 1.</p>
<p>Their spectacular omnichannel technology sits at the forefront of innovations in the gaming world while covering all forms of gaming. The interactive division represented by Greentube provides a rich selection of tables games, video slots, social casino solutions, video bingo, and many more that will now become even more easily available to the Italian market of gamers.</p>
