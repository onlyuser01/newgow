<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>I would like my current case</p>
<p>Sign up and have it checked if possible.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in recent years I have</p>
<p>no game of luck, no matter which casino I deposited at,</p>
<p>One year loss of 90%.</p>
<p>This time it's on my first deposit of €15 at ICE Casino</p>
<p>went a little better</p>
<p>First I wanted my profit from a few</p>
<p>Withdraw hundred euros (declined) all I should verify</p>
<p>despite bank transfer,</p>
<p>I gambled a bit and won €900, which I applied for a payout again, (rejected) had uploaded everything to verify so far, wrote an email whether anything else was needed, the next day I got an email that my selfi was still missing. After everything was accepted, I played a little more and won €10,000. Realizing that it was only after €2,500 was gone again, I decided to activate a daily play limit. And requested a withdrawal. When I then wanted to check the transaction on day 3, I was blocked for my account. No message received, only bonus offers came via email. I tried for hours to reach someone from support, wrote emails, no answer, with a lot of persistence finally support, who called me a rule violation 5.5 to 5.5.3 AGB as an excuse. To be honest, I still don't know what that means. There are still €6,500 outstanding, my deposit has been made</p>
<p>accepted , my profile details were all correct, I received a payment confirmation, and just a registration email to confirm. How u why should</p>
<p>I have multiple accounts. How is that supposed to work?</p>
<p>I would like to ask you for advice</p>
