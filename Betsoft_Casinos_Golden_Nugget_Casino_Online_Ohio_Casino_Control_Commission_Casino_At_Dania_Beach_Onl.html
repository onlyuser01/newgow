<p>Better Collective has hired Sean Valukis, Action Network’s VP of marketing, as its own US SVP of marketing. Action Network is the property of Better Collective and was acquired in a landmark deal for $240 million. Valukis, who was part of the company for the past five years, will now make a move to the parent entity where he will help with broader expansion moves.</p>
<p>Valukis to Put His Experience to Good Use</p>
<p>He first joined Action Network in 2017 and became head of marketing. Soon after, he moved to a more prominent position as senior director for marketing and commercial at the end of 2020. His success climbing the pecking order eventually landed him as VP of marketing in August 2021, a few months after the Better Collective deal was completed.</p>
<p>Better Collective, though, appreciated the success Action Network had achieved and enabled it to continue running as an individual business making executive decisions while the buying business sat back and monitored performance. Valukis will now move to help with Better Collective’s further expansion and brands in the United States, arguably the most lucrative regulated sports betting market.</p>
<p>He will be in assisting popular and established brands such as VegasInsider, RotoGrinders, Scores and Odds, US-bookies.com, and others to remain competitive and more important push further out into the market. Valukis confirmed that his new appointment was something he was looking forward to and said that he will seek to collaborate closely with his team to achieve further success.</p>
<p>Better Collective Continues to Grow</p>
<p>Since the Action Network, Better Collective has been very busy. The company announced a partnership with the Philadelphia Inquirer with the company reaping record-high revenues for the first quarter of 2022. Better Collective also managed to secure another important asset with Futbin, a platform that focuses on video gaming and esports. In March, the company confirmed that it’s paying around $23 million to secure Canada Sports Betting, an affiliate company, in anticipation of the regulated market launch in Ontario.</p>
