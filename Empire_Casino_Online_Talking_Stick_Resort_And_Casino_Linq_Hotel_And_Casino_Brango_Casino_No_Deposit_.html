<p>Develop and Integrate New Intelligent Features</p>
<p>The partnership between North America’s lifestyle sports betting and online casino brand MaximBet and the operator of automation platform Flows will see a range of new intelligent features deployed with the gaming brand’s operations as it is looking to automate and streamline its processes while rapidly expanding across the US.</p>
<p>Commenting on the agreement, MaximBet’s chief executive officer Daniel Graetzer outlined that MaximBet, as “a customer-centric company” strives to improve customer experience, and partnering with Flows will enable that by bringing “rapid development of automation.”</p>
<p>“Customers are discerning, and technology is moving at an incredible pace, so leveraging the best-in-breed third-party tools is essential to enhancing our experience. Our mission to be the premier lifestyle brand in sports betting and offering a world-class user experience is a key part of that commitment.” Daniel Graetzer, CEO, MaximBet</p>
<p>Designed and built to be as much interoperable between different systems as possible, the platform developed by Flows allows its partners to freely innovate and implement innovations while also keeping full ownership of their product roadmaps.</p>
