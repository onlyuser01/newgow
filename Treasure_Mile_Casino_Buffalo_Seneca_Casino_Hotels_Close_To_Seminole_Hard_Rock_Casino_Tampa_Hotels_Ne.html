<p>Online casino content and solutions provider 7777 gaming has grown its presence in the Balkans thanks to another content deal. As announced, the supplier will power NetBet’s Romanian business with more than 50 of its best games.</p>
<p>Thanks to the deal, the Romanian company will secure access to games with many innovative gamification elements. 7777 gaming’s titles are famous for their atmospheres, themes, bonus rounds, storytelling and social and multiplayer features. Some games even include skill-based mechanics, further diversifying the gameplay.</p>

<p>7777 gaming is ambitious on growing its business by pursuing exciting business opportunities with “progressive brands that are looking for reliable and personalized iGaming content.”</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the company formed a provision alliance with Bitville Gaming in Africa. In addition, the company secured a license to launch its games in Georgia.</p>
<p>For NetBet, this deal coincides with another agreement with Darwin Gaming.</p>
