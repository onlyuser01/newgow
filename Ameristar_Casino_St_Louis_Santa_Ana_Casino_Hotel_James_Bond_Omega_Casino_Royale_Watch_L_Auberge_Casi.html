    <h1>Ameristar Casino St Louis Santa Ana Casino Hotel James Bond Omega Casino Royale Watch L Auberge Casi</h1>

<p>I will state the points we all agree on</p>
<p>1) bitcasino.io was furnished with enough information that only the account holder could possibly know.</p>
<p>2) With this information, bitcasino.io or one of its employees was able to successfully locate the account in question (screen shot of this confirmation provided)</p>
<p>3) After bitcasino.io successfully located the account in question, despite not requiring account verification on signup, requested that the account holder verify their identify.</p>
<p>4) The choice of company used to verify the identity was exclusively decided by bitcasino.io</p>
<p>5)The account holder successfully complied with bitcasino.io request to use a third party verification service call Veriff.</p>
<p>6) This independent third party company has confirmed that verification was completed as per the requirements of bitcasino.io (screenshot provided)</p>
<p>5) bitcasino.io has been holding on to account funds for over a year and a half.</p>
<p>6) In the one and a half year that this is ongoing, there has been no activity on the account in question</p>
<p>However, the Veriff verification was not successfully passed, due to the discrepancies found between the provided documents and account details.</p>
<p>The above is a lie . bitcasino.io have ignored all my emails after verification was completed. AskGamblers has been provided with a confirmation message from Veriff . AskGamblers can validate this information as yet another independent party.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Player Safety and Assurance team has asked detailed questions about the other account, which could help us verify the ownership, but we did not get any replies.</p>
<p>The above is another lie. The last email received from bitcasino.io was from over a month ago. Since then bitcasino.io have not replied to any emails. Four times I spoke with customer service by chat. Each time they told me they will notify Player Safety. No message, no reply, no communication from player safety</p>
<p>Out of a short 5 paragraph reply, bitcasino.io has been dishonest in two of the five paragraphs.</p>

<p>Can you believe anything else bitcasino.io says?</p>
