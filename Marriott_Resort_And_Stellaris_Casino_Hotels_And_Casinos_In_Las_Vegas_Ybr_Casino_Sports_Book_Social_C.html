    <h1>Marriott Resort And Stellaris Casino Hotels And Casinos In Las Vegas Ybr Casino Sports Book Social C</h1>

<p>After a thorough discussion and consideration of all the facts, we have come to the following conclusion:</p>
<p>Although we agree that the casino has indeed the rule 7-7, (explicitly prohibit multiple participation in the same bonus campaign from the same device, household, or IP address. In instances where there is evidence of bonus abuse or other promotional misconduct, the associated bonus or promotion will be forfeited, and any funds held within the player’s account will be temporarily frozen. Additionally, the Operator reserves the right to close the customer account at its discretion.) mentioned in its General Terms and Conditions, however, according to our beliefs and from the perspective of a safe and fair user experience, we can't consider this rule to be fair. This rule can be (and in this case was) misused in situations where family members or friends are playing in the same casino and claiming the same bonuses to just not pay out their winnings, despite no breach of other terms being detected. We believe that if a player uses their own personal information to create a casino account, doesn't have duplicate accounts, and follows all of the rules in the T&amp;Cs, they should be able to use a casino bonus that has been given to them. It is absolutely natural for friends and family to share information about attractive bonuses and games, and it is not uncommon for them to play at the same casino. This, on its own, we cannot consider a reason for not paying out the players their winnings.</p>
<p>We have communicated our position to the casino team repeatedly, but the casino team decided to strictly enforce this rule, and sadly, we have to close this complaint as unresolved.</p>
<p>We will now mark the complaint as "unresolved" in our system. We understand this isn't a satisfactory solution to your issue. However, the decrease in the rating caused by unresolved complaints could help to change the casino's approach. If the casino decides to react, we will reopen the complaint and you will be notified by email.</p>
<p>If you feel you want to take this complaint further you can contact the Curaçao/Antillephone Gaming Authority (complaints@gaminglicences.com , certria@gaminglicences.com) and submit a complaint to them. It's not the best licensing authority but it may have more options and tools to help players. Let me know if and how they replied at michal.k@casino.guru</p>
<p>We can only recommend you choose casinos by their reviews and ratings in the future to avoid situations like this. Sorry, we could not be of more help on this occasion.</p>
<p>The casino can reopen and resolve this complaint anytime</p>
