<p>The United States men’s national team takes on Panama in the seminal of the 2023 Gold Cup. The game is played on Wednesday, July 12, at Snapdragon Stadium in San Diego, California</p>
<p>The USMNT is seen as a huge favorite to advance to the final of the 2023 Gold Cup, but Panama is coming off a brilliant performance in the previous phase in which we saw its forward Ismael Diaz score the fastest hat-trick in the history of the competition.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Americans made it to the final four after beating Canada on penalties after more than two hours spent on the pitch. The USMNT’s goalie Matt Turner was their hero in that game and is (probably) going to be at the center of attention on Wednesday – his team needs him to show up again in order to beat Panama.</p>

<p>USMNT’s Players Might be Tired After the Canada Game</p>
<p>The USMNT coach Brian Callaghan did make six substitutes in the game with Canada, but there are five players who spent more than two hours on the pitch that day. These guys probably feel jaded right now, and the coach might even decide to give them some rest on Wednesday.</p>
<p>One player who will certainly play is goalkeeper Matt Turner who saved two penalties against Canada. Having him between the sticks will certainly give the USMNT outfielders the confidence to push forward, knowing that the Arsenal goalie has their back.</p>
<p>And when they are on the front foot, the Americans usually do very well. Their offense looks great at the 2023 Gold Cup, with FC Dallas striker Jesus Ferreira being the standout player. This guy’s scored two hat-tricks so far, meaning that he’s responsible for more than one-third of his team’s goals in this tournament.</p>
<p>Panama Hoping for Another Brilliant Performance</p>
<p>Panama got to the Gold Cup semifinal after beating Qatar 4-0. It was kind of surprising result, even though Panama was seen as the favorite before the game. Still, it’s fair to say that not many people believed they’re going to destroy Qatar.</p>
<p>It happened mostly thanks to Ismael Diaz who put away three goals that day. It was the second game in a row that we saw him score, suggesting that the Universidad Catolica striker is in sensational form. He looks like the biggest threat to Matt Turner’s goal.</p>
<p>The Panamanians do look capable of scoring, but they might not be able to keep their net intact on Wednesday. The thing is that the game with Qatar was the first time they kept a clean sheet in this tournament.</p>
<p>USMNT vs. Panama Prediction</p>
<p>The USMNT is getting to the final of the 2023 Gold Cup. The Americans look way better than their next opponent, although beating Panama won’t be easy mainly because a couple of crucial US players are probably very tired. This is why we wouldn’t be surprised to see the game go to extra time.</p>
<p>Pick: USMNT to qualify for the final</p>
