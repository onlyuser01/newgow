<p>Pennsylvanian gamblers will get to play some of the best casino games the NOVOMATIC subsidiary has to offer</p>
<p>Greentube, a NOVOMATIC-owned provider of gaming content, has received a new US license, expanding its presence in North America. The supplier announced that it has been greenlit by the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board to launch its games in the state.</p>
<p>With an Interactive Gaming Manufacturer License in the Keystone State, Greentube will now be able to provide content to its partners in the market and forge new partnerships with local operators.</p>
<p>As a result, local gamblers will get to play some of the best games the NOVOMATIC subsidiary has to offer. Famous titles such as Diamond Cash and Thunder Cash will now be available to consumers in the state. Players will also get to experience some of Greentube’s newest hits, including Money Maker.</p>
<p>The launch is a great opportunity for Greentube, considering that at the moment, Pennsylvania is the third-largest US state in terms of iGaming revenue. In addition, Pennsylvania will mark the fourth state where Greentube’s games are licensed. Other US jurisdictions where players can find the supplier’s games are Connecticut, New Jersey and Michigan.</p>
<p>The License Is a Major Milestone for Greentube</p>
<p>Michael Bauer, Greentube’s chief financial officer and chief games officer, commented on the launch in Pennsylvania. He noted that the new license is an important event for his team as the company seeks to expand its US footprint. Bauer expressed his thrill at the opportunity to form new agreements in the region.</p>
<p>Receiving a license to offer our market-leading content in Pennsylvania is another important milestone for Greentube as it continues to expand its presence across North America. We are looking forward to working alongside operators within the state to serve players with our unique brand of entertaining content. Michael Bauer, CFO/CGO, Greentube</p>
<p>The market entry comes in the wake of news about Greentube’s intentions to scale its presence in the US and bolster its pipeline through an agreement with the emerging studio Flamingocatz and the acquisition of Present Creative, a US development studio.</p>
<p>A month ago, Greentube expanded its reach by deploying its online casino content in both Canada and the US. The interactive division teamed up with the local operator Rush Street Interactive and its BetRivers brand.</p>
<p>In other news, Greentube just released a brand new cyberpunk-themed title called Cyber Wilds. The new game boasts a plethora of engaging features such as Multiplier Wilds and Bonus Buy options.</p>
