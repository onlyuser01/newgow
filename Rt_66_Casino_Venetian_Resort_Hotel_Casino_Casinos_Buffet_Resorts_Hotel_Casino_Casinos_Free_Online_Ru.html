    <h1>Rt 66 Casino Venetian Resort Hotel Casino Casinos Buffet Resorts Hotel Casino Casinos Free Online Ru</h1>

<p>Nothing yet. I can't count apparently. I want somebody there to commit to a date. Don't forget, my withdrawal was approved at approximately 3:00AM on 11/21. I text support, same non-committal answer every time. Today support provided me their payments email address. So I wrote to them very politely asking about payment schedules. 3 hours later, no response so I am not expecting any reply at all.</p>
<p>You know what really pisses me off, makes me angry translated for you members.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Don't take 10 business days to deliver crypto after waiting the entire 10 days for approval ( I placed my withdrawal request on 11/7). They provide the 5-10 business day garbage so why not take the 10 business days? They are anyway, both approval and payment, same.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next! What legitimate entertainment company don't give a shit about customers? Ruby Slots don't give a shit about you. They take your money immediately. You've heard all that before. But to make a good impression on new customers seem to not be in their DNA. Acquiring new customers and retaining them is what you are taught in Business 101. So Ruby Slots is just a flash in the pan. They will not last.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I had so many more negative remarks for Ruby Slots but this is getting too long.</p>
<p>Hopefully you will take my horror story and and decide to NOT PATRONIZE RUBY SLOTS CASINO. DON'T BECOME A MEMBER.</p>
<p>Ruby Slots payment process sucks and they know it. Stay away. Absurd payment processes such as those practiced by Ruby Slots do not have a place for me to play there.</p>
<p>We'll support did tell me that if I don't receive payment by 12/6, contact them and they will escalate then. How's that for customer service?</p>
