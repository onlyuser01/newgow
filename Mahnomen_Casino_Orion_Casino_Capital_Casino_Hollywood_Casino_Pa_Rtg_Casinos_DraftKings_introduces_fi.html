    <h1>Mahnomen Casino Orion Casino Capital Casino Hollywood Casino Pa Rtg Casinos DraftKings introduces fi</h1>

<p>The digital sports entertainment and gaming company, DraftKings, announced the launch of its first-ever horse racing product. The company unveiled Wednesday the launch of DK Horse, its first horse racing product that enables customers to access pari-mutuel wagering on horse racing.</p>
<p>DraftKings confirmed that the new product launched in twelve US states. Still, the company acknowledged that further expansion of DK Horse to additional states can be expected by the Kentucky Derby which is scheduled for Saturday, May 6, 2023.</p>
<p>The launch of the product doesn't come as a surprise, considering DraftKings' multi-year partnership with Churchill Downs Incorporated (CDI). The duo inked a deal under which TwinSpires, CDI's subsidiary, "agreed to power the advance deposit pari-mutuel wagering technology for DK Horse," a statement released by DK Crown Holdings reveals.</p>
<p>Thanks to DK Horse, eligible customers in a dozen US states will have the option to wager on popular horse races. Such include CDI's popular Derby and Oaks. Moreover, DK Horse offers a plethora of features for racing fans and bettors alike.</p>
<p>Functionalities include the option to stream video of races, handicap races and more options via a DK Horse account. Bettors that want to tap into additional information and useful betting guide can also use the horse racing product and explore options for wagers on upcoming races in different ways.</p>
<p>Currently, DraftKings is one of the active members of the American Gaming Association (AGA). As such, the company supports and promotes the Association's public service campaign Have A Game Plan. Bet Responsibly in an effort to promote responsible gaming practices such as sticking to a budget and using licensed operators. Additionally, DraftKings remains committed to its S.E.R.V.E.S. program which seeks "supporting innovation through service, equity, responsibility, vitality, entrepreneurship, and sports."</p>
<p>Focusing once again on the latest app, the company explained: "DK Horse will initially require customers to register and deposit funds into new accounts separately from their "one account, one wallet" tethered to DraftKings Sportsbook, Casino and daily fantasy sports apps."</p>
<p>Jason Robins, DraftKings' CEO and Chairman of the Board, commented on the topic saying: "Together with Churchill Downs Incorporated, an industry leader with a deep-rooted history in horse racing, we will deliver an innovative, mobile customer experience."</p>
<p>"Our goal is to provide our customers with best-in-class-sports and gaming products, and we expect DK Horse to provide a fun and new way to engage with renowned races like the upcoming Run for the Roses," he explained in conclusion.</p>
