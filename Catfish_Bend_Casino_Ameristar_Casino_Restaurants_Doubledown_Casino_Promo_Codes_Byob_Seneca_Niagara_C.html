<p>Las Vegas Sands’ recently established political action committee (PAC) continues to push for the legalization of casino gambling in Texas, a new report reveals.</p>
<p>Las Vegas Sands Establishes PAC in Texas</p>
<p>Currently, Texas is among the very few remaining US states that don’t allow sports betting. In fact, according to the American Gaming Association, 7 states have no sports betting legislation filed in 2022 and Texas is one of them. On the bright side, the state offers casino gambling, but it is currently restricted to Tribal venues. For the whole state, there are only two venues, one in Livingston and one in Eagle Pass. However, those two venues support more than 3,000 jobs.</p>
<p>Efforts to legalize commercial casinos and sports betting in Texas date back more than a decade. Last year, such an initiative was filed by Representative John Kuempel. However, the proposal did not gain much traction. Since 2021, Las Vegas Sands has been focused on pushing casino gambling in Texas. To support its efforts, the gaming giant established a new political action committee (PAC) dubbed Texas Sands last month. Now, according to the Texas Tribune, Texas Sands PAC has spent more than half a million dollars supporting approximately 30 races. Earlier this week, the Committee had also filed its first report with the Texas Ethics Commission, outlining details for the first recipients of contributions.</p>
<p>The PAC Supports More than 30 Races in Senate, House</p>
<p>Political action committees are established with the purpose to raise and spend money to elect and defeat candidates. Texas Sands PAC’s initial funding when created in January was $2.3 million that came from Miriam Adelson, one of the shareholders in Las Vegas Sands and the widow of the famous businessman, philanthropist and investor, Sheldon Adelson.</p>
<p>So far, more than 30 incumbents in the House and the Senate have received contributions. It is important to mention that the recipients are Republicans as well as Democrats. According to the recent report, each of the donations for the House races were between $3,000 to $25,000. On the other hand, Senate candidates received between $4,000 to $30,000 from the PAC.</p>
<p>Texas Sands PAC’s spokesman, Matt Hirsh, outlined that the Committee appreciates the efforts of lawmakers to discuss the benefits that destination resorts can create for the state. Moreover, he outlined that besides economic stimulus, such resorts would create thousands of new workplaces. In conclusion, Hirsh said that the PAC will continue its efforts in engaging with local leaders hoping that in the end, voters will be able to decide on the topic.</p>
