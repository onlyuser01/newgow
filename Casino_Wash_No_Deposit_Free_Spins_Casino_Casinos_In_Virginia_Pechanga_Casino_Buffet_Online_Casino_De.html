    <h1>Casino Wash No Deposit Free Spins Casino Casinos In Virginia Pechanga Casino Buffet Online Casino De</h1>

<p>I received an offer of a free 50 chip to try the lucky legends casino. It said try our site with this chip with no deposit required to cash out. I played the free chip and won, played all the required play through and then requested a withdrawl for $296.12. I was notified during the transaction i need to be verified to make a withdrawl so i verified myself and then came ithe notification that i would be unable to cash out until i made a minimum deposit of $20; so much for cashing out without having to deposit. I made a deposit of $21 and then proceeded with my withdrawl request. The next day i noticed the withdrawl had been cancelled with no communication from the casino as to why or how to resolve whatever the error might be. I contacted support and was told it was cancelled because the coupon stipulates a maximum withdrawl of $100. My fault for not looking at the coupon for the max withdrawl level so i said ok and asked if there were any other issues i needed to address and was told nope that was it. I put in for a withdrawl of $100. This morning i wake up to a deposit of $19.89. I vontact the casino support to find out why and i get told i used multiple free chip coupons so i was refunded. I showed a screen shot of my transactions showing that was impossible as i opened the account used the free chip attempted a withdrawl, made a deposit, requested a lower withdrawl and that was it, only one coupon used. I was then told oh well nothing we can do once financing makes a decision and im like wait what? And if i was "refunded" my money why did i only receive $19.89 instead of the $21 i deposited? So basically they ran deceptive advertisment as a deposit was required to cash out and then they burned me on the other $80.11 they owe me and lied about why they didnt pay me.</p>
