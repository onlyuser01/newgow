<p>Leading gambling technology provider Playtech announced today its partnership with Parx Interactive and Gun Lake Casino in Michigan resulted in the launch of a new iGaming app, Play Gun Lake.</p>
<p>“We are delighted to launch playgunlake.com, our new iGaming app in Michigan with Playtech and to bring the success of Parx into the Michigan iGaming market.” Matthew Cullen, SVP, iGaming and Sports, Parx Casino</p>
<p>Content, Platform and PAM Solution</p>
<p>The new iGaming app will feature proprietary iGaming content from Playtech and will be powered by the technology supplier’s IMS platform and Player Account Management (PAM) solution.</p>
<p>“The launch of Playtech’s iGaming partnership with Parx Casino is another key milestone in the development and delivery of our US strategy.” Shimon Akad, Chief Operating Officer, Playtech</p>
<p>Playtech’s IMS platform, set to debut in the US markets via a launch by the largest casino in Pennsylvania, Parx Casino, delivers a complete online backend solution for iGaming industry operators and sports betting companies, propped by industry-leading offering across a number of gaming products and multiple jurisdictions worldwide.</p>
<p>“Parx is constantly expanding its offerings to take user experience to another level, and to do so with Playtech’s industry leading content is particularly exciting.” Matthew Cullen, SVP, iGaming and Sports, Parx Casino</p>
<p>The launch of the Play Gun Lake app is part of the agreement reached between Playtech and Parx Interactive in February, which will also feature rollout of additional products in Michigan, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Indiana, and other regulated US jurisdictions.</p>
<p>“The US is a highly sophisticated market and therefore demands a technology solution that provides a high-quality customer experience. We look forward to continuing our work with Parx Casino to deliver industry leading gambling entertainment across multiple states and products.” Shimon Akad, Chief Operating Officer, Playtech</p>
<p>Key to Playtech’s US Expansion</p>
<p>The launch of the new iGaming app is another step for the technology company to establish its presence in Michigan and across the US, following another recent development in the state.</p>
<p>In March, Playtech announced it secured a long-term lease for a property in Southfield, an area in Michigan that is fast turning into a technology and innovation hub, to set one of the largest live entertainment studios and the company’s first Live Casino studio in the US.</p>
<p>The Live Casino studio, seen as the first step for Playtech’s expansion into the live entertainment space in the US, is set to feature the best from Playtech’s flagship studio in Riga via video technology and will offer retail and online gaming operators integrated content across different product verticals.</p>
