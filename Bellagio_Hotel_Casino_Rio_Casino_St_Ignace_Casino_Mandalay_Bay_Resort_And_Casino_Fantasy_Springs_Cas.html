    <h1>Bellagio Hotel Casino Rio Casino St Ignace Casino Mandalay Bay Resort And Casino Fantasy Springs Cas</h1>

<p>Fanatics, a sports company that is making strong forays into the sports betting market, has appointed Orlando Ashford as its new chief people officer (CPO). The role has been created as part of Fanatics Holdings and it will put Ashford in a position where he will work closely with the business’ commerce, collectables, betting &amp; gaming teams.</p>
<p>Fanatics to Bolster Its People Policies With Ashford</p>
<p>Ashford will be overseeing the HR team and he will report to both the company CEO Michael Rubin and CFO Glenn H. Schiffman, for anything that relates to the overall HR infrastructure, policies, operations, and strategy. Ashford will work in New York City, and he will focus on helping the brand pursue its recruitment and people policies.</p>
<p>Ashford also is already serving a role as CPO and strategic advisor for Fanatics’ executive team, but he will now double down on his efforts to promote diversity and inclusion across the workforce.</p>
<p>Commenting on the appointment, Rubin welcomed Ashford and outlined why the new addition will be an important milestone for the company and a great contribution to the team’s effort:</p>
<p>His [Ashford] vast experience running HR teams and his CEO-level experience, with people and culture being the primary lens for how he’s managed and operated his businesses, will help us further develop our ambitions to build one of the world’s most transformative and exciting brands. Fanatics CEO Michael Rubin</p>
<p>Ashford has worked and held numerous roles across some of the biggest corporations in the United States and Fortune 500 companies, including The Coca-Cola Company and Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies, but also in other corporate behemoths, such as Motorola, Inc.</p>
<p>Ashford Is Equally Happy to Be Part of the Team</p>
<p>Ashford was equally pleased with the opportunity he has been provided, and said that he was pleased to be joining a team that includes Michael Rubin:</p>
<p>From the moment I met Michael Rubin and listened to his vision for expanding the Fanatics business, which was rooted in empowering the company’s incredible global workforce and creating a world-class culture, I knew that this was the perfect place for me. Fanatics CPO Orlando Ashford</p>
<p>Ashford is also a Bachelor of Science degree and Master of Science degree in Organization Leadership and Industrial Technology from Purdue University. Fanatics is also readying to launch sports betting before the year’s end.</p>
