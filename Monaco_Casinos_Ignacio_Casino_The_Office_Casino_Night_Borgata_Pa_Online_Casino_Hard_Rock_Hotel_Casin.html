<p>Expert in sports gamification Low6 continued to expand its presence across professional sports in the US by entering into another significant sports partnership, this time with the NBA’s Detroit Pistons.</p>
<p>First NBA Partner</p>
<p>The partnership between UK-based Low6 and the Michigan-based franchise from the NBA followed the same blueprint the sports gamification company established with its previous partnerships with the NFL’s Cincinnati Bengals and Jacksonville Tigers. “We are delighted to announce our first NBA franchise partner, the Detroit Pistons. We are thrilled to be working with a team which has such a great history, including three NBA titles, and this partnership with Low6 will bring next-level gamification for fans,” asserted Jamie Mitchell, co-founder and Group CEO of Low6. He added, “It’s very exciting to continue bringing supporters closer than ever to the action as we continue to build our profile in the States.”</p>
<p>The partnership with the Detroit Pistons will see the release of the free-to-play Pistons Picks game, which will mirror popular games played across the world like UFC Picks available on the MMA app, European Tour Picks and the upcoming PGA TOUR F2P game.</p>
<p>“The Detroit Pistons are thrilled to partner with Low6 to launch our new, free-to-play game, Pistons Picks. The Detroit Pistons organization is dedicated to finding new and innovative ways to interact and engage with our fans, and this game will do just that.” Brenden Mallette, SVP, Corporate Partnerships &amp; Engagement, Detroit Pistons</p>
<p>Also speaking about the announcement, Low6 chief strategy officer for North America Josh Turk outlined the benefits Low6’s free-to-play gaming platform provides for sports franchises, honoring the long history in basketball of the NBA franchise.</p>
<p>“We look forward to getting this season underway and working together with a world class NBA franchise to connect with their fans through fun engaging free-to-play pick’ems that reward fans with free tickets, signed merchandise and the opportunity to meet some of your favorite Pistons Alumni players,” Low6 North America’s chief strategy officer Turk concluded.</p>
<p>Engaging by Playing</p>
<p>The official free-to-play game of the Pistons will allow participants to accumulate points by making predictions on the outcome of designated games, with the best performers having a real chance to win exclusive Detroit Pistons prizes on offer, including tickets, experiences and merchandise.</p>
<p>The partnership with its first NBA franchise continued to expand Low6’s footprint across the US, while more professional sports franchises are expected to realize the inherent value of connecting with their fans via free-to-play games. Other sports partners of the UK-based gamification expert include the PGA TOUR, European Tour and UFC.</p>
