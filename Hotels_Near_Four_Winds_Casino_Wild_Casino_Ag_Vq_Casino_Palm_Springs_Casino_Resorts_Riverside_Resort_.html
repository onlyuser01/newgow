<p>Wazdan, a provider of innovative iGaming titles, has expanded its presence in Eastern Europe. The company inked a new agreement with SYNOT Interactive, which agreed to distribute the provider’s content in regulated markets such as Serbia and Montenegro.</p>
<p>Wazdan Has Joined Forces with SYNOT Interactive</p>
<p>Under the agreement, SYNOT Interactive, a Czech gaming software specialist and content aggregator will distribute Wazdan’s full suite of games in the aforementioned countries. This will notably allow the developer to reinforce its footprint in the region, helping its content reach more players.</p>
<p>Wazdan’s portfolio of games currently includes more than 150 titles, famed for their innovative features and exciting gameplay. The provider’s games include hit titles such as 9 Coins, Fortune Reels, Magic Spins and Sun of Fortune. In addition, the company’s Hot Slot and Power of Gods slot series have cemented themselves as fan-favorites.</p>
<p>What makes Wazdan’s content special is its unique approach to game design. The company uses a variety of proprietary engagement functions that provide players with unique gambling experiences. A few of these include Cash Infinity, Collect to Infinity, Hold the jackpot, Sticky to Infinity and Volatility Levels.</p>
<p>Under the agreement with SYNOT Interactive, the aggregator will distribute these features as well.</p>
<p>Players of Maxbet.rs and Maxbet.me can already try out Wazdan’s titles. The developer aims to be a fully-licensed and reliable company, which is why many jurisdictions have trusted its games.</p>
<p>SYNOT Is Happy to Offer Wazdan Content to Its Partners</p>
<p>SYNOT Interactive’s project manager, Pavel Mikeš, spoke about his company’s decision to distribute Wazdan titles. He noted that the company has quickly grown as one of the leading iGaming providers in Europe, while its titles continue to top charts. Mikeš lauded Wazdan as a company with a profound understanding of player mentality and one that SYNOT Interactive will be happy to work with.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Radka Bacheva, Wazdan’s head of business development for the Balkans and Southeastern Europe, said that her company is happy to see its content onboarded to SYNOT’s aggregation platform. Bacheva added that, thanks to this partnership, Wazdan’s titles are already available with top regional operators such as Maxbet. Bacheva concluded that she is happy to see players enjoying Wazdan’s games and said that she is excited to further expand her company’s relationship with SYNOT Interactive in the future.</p>
<p>Wazdan recently celebrated its 10th anniversary, promoting many employees within the company. At the beginning of November, the company further consolidated its power in Europe by inking a Latvia-centered agreement with FeniBet.</p>
