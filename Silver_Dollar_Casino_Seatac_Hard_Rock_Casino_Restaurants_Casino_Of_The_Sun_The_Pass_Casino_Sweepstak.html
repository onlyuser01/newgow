<p>Checkd Group, a provider of digital sports betting products and services, has promoted the experienced Will Tyrrell to director of UK media. Tyrrell’s expertise in marketing will be crucial to improving the company’s presence in the country and establishing it as a leading innovator in the sports betting sector.</p>
<p>Tyrrell Named as Director of UK Marketing</p>
<p>Tyrrell has been working for Checkd group for over five years now. He became a part of the group in 2017 when Checkd acquired Oddschanger, an online sports betting hub founded by Tyrrell. At first, the marketing specialist served as Oddschanger’s head.</p>
<p>Tyrrell quickly climbed the corporate ladder and was named content manager just four months after joining Checkd. After almost a year in the position, he became the group’s head of commercial. In 2019, Tyrrell was named as head of content – a position he maintained for over two years. Tyrrell then became head of marketing and was tasked with overseeing several marketing campaigns. His success has now earned him a new position in the company.</p>
<p>As director of UK media, Tyrrell will be responsible for improving Checkd Group’s footprint in the European country and helping it find new strategic media partners.</p>
<p>The Director Is Glad to Be a Part of Checkd Group</p>
<p>Tyrrell shared his thoughts about his promotion. He mentioned that he has had a blast working for Checkd Group for the last five years. Tyrrell added that the last few years were not only exciting for him but for the company as a whole since it managed to strike some notable partnerships and develop some of its existing ones.</p>
<p>I am very much looking forward to taking on this new role, leading the UK strategy as we aim to continue to innovate in order to serve both our partners and our sports-mad communities with highly engaging content through a wide variety of channels. Will Tyrrell, director of UK marketing, Checkd Group</p>
<p>Alex Beecham, Checkd Media’s managing director, believes that Tyrrell is a great worker who continues to prove his worth with each passing day. Beecham lauded Tyrrell’s innovative approach and know-how and said that this will play a role in Checkd’s strategy for the new football season.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Beecham is looking forward to expanding the company’s presence in the UK, following “great strides” in the USA.</p>
<p>The UK market remains a clear focus of ours as we aim to build on a series of successes in recent months and years. Alex Beecham, managing director, Checkd Media</p>
<p>Tyrrell’s promotion to director of UK media comes amid a series of internal reforms. Checkd Group recently promoted several other successful team members, including Ben Warn who became a non-exec chair and Paul Lowery who was named as head of sports.</p>
