    <h1>No Deposit Casino Bonus Codes South Point Hotel Casino Las Vegas Planet 7 Casino Login Island View C</h1>

<p>Dear CasinoGuru,</p>
<p>I have explained what exactly happened to me and I do not see any wrong doing in it whatsoever.</p>
<p>I made a 250 euro deposit and got bonus and played it and lost all. Then I made a 50 euro and played the same slot machine and won after which I wanted to withdraw 600 from my 1268euro balance. Clearly the slot machine that won the 250 euro and the bonus will start paying back and this is what I did and this is what everyone does when they play slot machines, as after losing a lot the same machine will start paying it back. This is similar to going to the casino, losing 750 on a slot machine then inserting a new bill and playing again and naturally someone will win because the machine already won a lot. What is wrong in doing so I don't understand: is there a rule that says if you lose on one slot you cannot play again? I am free to play as much as I want on any machine. This is the entire story; why are they giving 200% bonus if they want all customer to lose? Eventually someone will win and they will start finding excuses so as not to pay. After losing 750euro on one slot, it is only natural that this same slot will give some of its winnings back. Moroever, no matter what the case is or how they see it, there is no right whatsoever for them to keep my deposit. The deposit is entirely my money, has nothing to do with them and they cannot keep it. Even when you go to a court, there is no chance to keep my deposit: are they punishing me? I don,t understand. If someone is smart to win they do this? And if I make a 5000 euro deposit and same happens, they keep that deposit too? They just win 5000 euro?</p>
<p>This is totally unacceptable. Clearly they are a site that does not have enough money to pay its customers and tries to generate money by such ways</p>
