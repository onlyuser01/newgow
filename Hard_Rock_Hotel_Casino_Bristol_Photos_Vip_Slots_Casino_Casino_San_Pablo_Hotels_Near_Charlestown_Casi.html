<p>The rebound of the Kansas market coincides with the return of the NFL and other big leagues</p>
<p>Kansas is one of the latest states to launch legal sports betting, expanding the industry’s presence across the United States. A year later, the Sunflower State’s wagering industry continues to grow, as shown by the increased interest in the vertical.</p>
<p>The continued growth of sports betting resulted in a monthly handle of $219.3 million in September. This figure is notably 36.6% higher than the one recorded during the sports betting market’s opening month, September 2022. For reference, that month saw the state’s sportsbooks collect $160.5 million in bets.</p>
<p>September’s results also signify the recovery of the local market, following the subpar August results. In August, Kansas’ sports betting operators recorded a handle of $94.4 million, 132.3% lower than September 2023’s results.</p>
<p>This rebound is to be expected, of course, considering the return of the NFL and the multiple new wagering opportunities awaiting players.</p>
<p>Kansas Exceeded Its Previous Record</p>
<p>The record-breaking September 2023 results also exceeded the ones recorded in March this year when the state’s sports punters wagered a total of $206.3 million.</p>
<p>September’s handle of $219.3 million translated into revenue of $8.1 million, far exceeding the results recorded in August 2023 and September 2022 when the industry recorded revenues of $1.3 million and $4.8 million, respectively.</p>
<p>Taking a closer look at the September 2023 figures makes it clear that betting online continues to be Kansans’ preferred way to wager. For reference, an overwhelming $201.1 million of the total bets were placed online. Only $18.2 million of the total wagers were placed with traditional sportsbooks.</p>
<p>Reflecting the Kansans sports betting enthusiasts’ preference for online wagering, the online vertical accounted for $7.6 million of the monthly revenue in the state. Retail sportsbooks, meanwhile, reported revenue of $459,336.</p>
<p>DraftKings continues to be the preferred online sportsbook of local bettors. The American sports betting giant and its local partner, Boot Hill Casino, accounted for $97.2 million of the handle and $3.3 million of the revenue. FanDuel and BetMGM followed next with revenues of $3 million and $814,000 respectively.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Matt Schwartz, Kansas Lottery’s finance director, said that the industry has so far seen Kansan bettors wager $1.85 billion, contributing $7 million to state revenue.</p>
<p>June, on the other hand, was a record-low month for the Sunflower State, because of a variety of setbacks.</p>
