    <h1>River Monster Casino Login Twin Pine Casino Hotel Resorts World Casino New York City Casino Green Ba</h1>

<p>Rabona decided to confiscate 400EUR and close my account because I didnt provide documents which they never asked for But I was able to play with them for 500 days</p>
<p>I registered with Rabona in November 2021. I made deposits, withdrawals, without any issues, for 300€, 600€, many many deposits and withdrawals.</p>
<p>I was never asked for documents. Which is strange by itself. For a year and half!</p>
<p>In April 2023 I made a withdrawal for 300€. I then had other interests and life priorities to attend to. Of course this 300€ would come thru, why wouldn't it. After a few weeks I receive an email stating that my account is closed since I haven't provided my documents for verification.</p>
<p>I asked them when did they make a request? And they stated that there was a message in my account.</p>
<p>So, since I haven't used their services for 30 days, I was not able to get to their message.</p>
<p>Sending an email is ouf of the question it seems.</p>
<p>After asking them that I am willing to make a verification, they don't want to cooperate.</p>
<p>Why would they not be sending an e-mail request for documents - like every other gambling site??</p>
<p>They won't ask for documents thru email, rather thru a message in your account while logged in. But they WILL use email when you ask them about this?? Wow!</p>
<p>They told me it's their terms.</p>
<p>Is it a loophole so they can catch users of guard and steal their money?? I would really like to not believe that. It is a gambling industry, not a black market.</p>
<p>Can you imagine users not using Rabona for 30 days, meanwhile they are asked for documents in a message that is only (probably?) visible after when they log in? That's how they presented their answer. And if you don't get to that message for any reason, they close your account and steal your money? It's not about a bookie not paying out your sports or casino winnings - it's stealing!</p>
<p>Dear Rabona, I kindly ask for your cooperation. I would like to provide my documents, verify myself and withdraw my funds of 400 EUR.</p>
