    <h1>New Casinos In Las Vegas Paris Casino Restaurants Craps Casino Casino In New Orleans Casino Near Me</h1>

<p>Hello there,</p>
<p>im writing to you guys to seek advice and help to resolving the issues i have with my fellow casino johnniekashkings inc "Jokaviproom" aswel.</p>
<p>I have noticed complete hatred with this bunch of support team that not only pick who they like but also play immature games and tacit that they will SWEAR they dont do and blatently say they are sorry that i feel that way ;/ please keep in mind this has been happening for quite some time now and i had enough, i have spent 1000s of dollars to a sum of over 412,000 with a withdrawl of $180,000 into Jokavip casino and my johnnie is around the same figures. That is 1 player alone "myself" i show nothing but pure loyallty to not only 1 casino but 2, "JohnnieKashkings % Jokaviproom. every god damn time i noticed my joka account when im playing a slot and if it by all means in anyway provides me with a return example "$300" feature i just won, i get a game error, the page reloads and from there on nothing comes my way, each time i logon i noticed these weird out of character behaviour happening towards me. for someone like me who seeks the support when needed by the casino, i raise querys and get told the same junk story "please allow and wait 48hrs etc etc" there is plenty of times where i have let things slide because i have forgotten and when i do remind the casinos about the query i get referred and quoted " please talk to your host, as we are only support and your host is there for your personalised ettcc ??" like what the hell. 1 agent delayed my $2000 withdrawl on the 6th of may this month for 6days before reaching my bank account. Guys this has never happened it doesnt matter if its a public hoilday all withdrawls made from the casinos reach my bank account in under 24hrs unless its a friday then skip the 2 weekend days. no one could find the transcript between me and that agent, the agents kept ensuring me they cannot see no payment... ahhhhhh look there is so much crap i have to deal. they have paused my accounts from accumulating any VIP points and status just last week on the 11th of may. 1 week and 4 days later i am still waiting for the points to be added to my account so i can use them to buy a bonus because each time no matter what RATIOS my accounts are i am refused a bonus. so today the 21th of may i have asked them kindly to accept my request for a charge back for the days i personal think has been misleading behaviour towards my accounts. i have asked few people i know who play on these casinos if there VIP points are frozen, if any of the behaviour i am noticing is happening to them and they have responded to me with a no every thing is as normal as it is. they cant even provide me with a SORRY he is a bonus due to our systems failing and not providing you with the service as promised. instead i get told everyday to wait and wait. end of the day i pay for service not product and the casino have not met there own T&amp;C and have banned my accounts simply because i asked for a chargeback for 11days in total. such a shame to treat a player like this, they goddam no exactly what i am talking about. i am in rage about how much i have ooured into playing these casino building up my accounts and to what. there was no reason for them to banned my accounts today just because of my query. they are taking that as a threat? MAN THEY ARE SO IMMATURE please help i have deadset tones of pictures from chats,gameplays and other related photos</p>
<p>i have a addiction i know, but they have had a major role into my addiction with there VIP host matt who sends me personal gifts to my address and sweet talks me and i always had this urge to go back everyday and play and talk to my host. i am seeking help for my addiction i have finally called it a end and i thank myself for building the strength to say enough is enough..</p>
<p>i am hoping there gaming license provider sorts the issues this casinos have because at 1 point they was brilliant.</p>
