<p>Cantona was the perfect fit to represent William Hill’s new campaign, MD Alexis Zamboglou said</p>
<p>Eric Cantona, a French soccer legend, formerly playing for Manchester United, has joined British operator William Hill for a new advertising campaign. Under the slogan “Who You Got?”, the campaign will promote the gambling operator’s EPIC Value products.</p>
<p>William Hill’s new campaign launches today, just in time for the upcoming start of the 2023/24 soccer season. The campaign will leverage many new innovative marketing features to “generate excitement around the marquee moments in the sporting calendar.”</p>
<p>Cantona, who will serve as William Hill’s official brand ambassador for the next two years, will feature in the campaign across all media verticals. The campaign will run in the United Kingdom and Ireland, allowing local players to learn of the betting promotions available to them.</p>
<p>William Hill’s flagship sites will put up imagery of the legendary soccer athlete, highlighting his support for the operator’s cause. The company noted that the Who You Got? will allow players to see “King Eric” as they have never seen him before.</p>
<p>As teased by the operator, its new marketing campaign will highlight Cantona’s distinctive character on and off the pitch. Accompanied by Rudimental’s Feel the Love song, the bold and creative campaign is designed to appeal to both bettors and non-bettor sports fans.</p>
<p>Cantona’s Charisma Makes Him a Perfect Fit for the Campaign</p>
<p>Alexis Zamboglou, William Hill’s managing director for the United Kingdom and Ireland, expressed his thoughts on the new campaign. He said that the start of the new soccer season is a “huge moment” in the sports betting calendar, with demands peaking as fans and bettors prepare for the action.</p>
<p>In order to meet this immense demand, we are making a real splash with our new football season campaign, “Who You Got?”, which will be headed by one of the footballing greats in Eric Cantona. Alexis Zamboglou</p>
<p>Zamboglou added that few soccer players in the history of the sport can rival Cantona’s charisma, humor and provocative nature. The MD also said that the soccer legend was the obvious choice to represent the operator’s new and distinctive campaign.</p>
<p>In early July, William Hill published a report, demonstrating the resilience of its business and attributing its satisfactory results to the diversification of its revenue streams. Despite its recent failings, the company continues to from strength to strength, solidifying its position as a leader in the betting sector.</p>
<p>Around the same time, the company signed an agreement with the B2B provider Play’n GO, launching some of its games across William Hill-branded properties in the UK.</p>
