    <h1>Vave Casino Casino M8Trix Casino Beach Resorts Casinos 7 Bit Casino Michigan Gaming Regulator Starte</h1>

<p>Michigan’s Gaming regulator is now accepting applications for online gambling licenses.</p>
<p>MGCB Now Accepts Applications for Gambling Licenses</p>
<p>The Michigan’s Gaming Control Board (MGCB) has started accepting online applications for gambling licenses. The regulator shared all necessary details and the application form on their web site. Furthermore, MGCB now has committed a separate form which is for operators that would be interested in online gambling and fantasy sports betting.</p>
<p>MGCB executive director, Richard S. Kalm commented on the news: “We’ve taken another step toward the launch of online gaming by beginning the licensing process. The MGCB encourages suppliers to file applications soon so we can conduct investigations and issue provisional licenses, which are allowed under state law.” Kalm continued by saying that the rules for online gaming and sports betting are still in discussion. In conclusion, he expressed hopes that those forms of betting will be launched sooner than the initial plan for launch in early 2021.</p>
<p>Currently, provisional licenses can be issued by the MGCB even before the start of online gambling in the state. All gaming suppliers can receive a provisional license with the exception of platform providers. Platform providers can also apply for license currently but their license can only be approved once the online gambling in the state is launched.</p>
<p>Michigan Gambling Unraveling Since 2019</p>
<p>Last year in December, Michigan State made a step towards legal online and mobile casino gambling. This was done under the Lawful Internet Gaming Act, HB 4311 signed by Governor Gretchen Whitmer. Under the law, online and mobile casino gambling was effectively legal in the state of Michigan. Following the Lawful Internet Gaming Act, MGCB was allowed to deal with the licenses for such gambling activities. In addition, Governor Whitmer also signed two more bills – HB 916 which created the Lawful Sports Betting Act.</p>
<p>Tribal and commercial casinos were allowed to offer both online sports betting as well as land-based sports betting in the state under this law. The second bill signed by the governor was HB 4308 which effectively legalized the fantasy sports competitions in Michigan.</p>
<p>The sports wagering in Michigan was launched back in March. It however suffered a significant setback considering the postponing of sports events worldwide due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak. Although that the igaming gambling market in Michigan was planned to launch in early 2021, judging by current events, this may happen even earlier.</p>
<p>US Sports Betting Continues to Grow</p>
<p>It has only been 2 years since the US Supreme Court’s decision to rule PASPA (Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992) as unconstitutional. Prior to this, for 26 years Nevada was the only state to offer regulated sports betting.</p>
<p>The growth that the legal sports betting market industry saw in the last two years could not be predicted. US sportsbooks reports show an excessive of $20 billion the population gambled since the Supreme Court’s decision. With more states to come, by now some 18 states have already established regulated gaming markets. Although it’s not half of the US states that joined the regulated gaming market, the 18 states so far represent just above 30% of the country’s population.</p>
