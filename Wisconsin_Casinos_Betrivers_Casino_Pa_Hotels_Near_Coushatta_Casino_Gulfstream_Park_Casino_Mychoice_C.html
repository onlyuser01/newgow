    <h1>Wisconsin Casinos Betrivers Casino Pa Hotels Near Coushatta Casino Gulfstream Park Casino Mychoice C</h1>

<p>Hello everyone.</p>
<p>I deposited about 45€ in Mrbet about 2 years ago and used it to play live casino blackjack.</p>
<p>I noticed in the past that the casino had deceitfully taken my money. Here's exactly what happened. I had a good winning streak in blackjack. However, I noticed that after winning a blackjack hand, my stake money and my winnings were taken away and weren't displayed. I initially thought the issue was probably due to an internet problem, so I continued playing. After 5 blackjack hands, all of my money was gone, even though I had won all the hands. This means I should have had 90€, as I was losing money each time I won, even when I should have seen it in my account. I believe this is a scam by Mrbet. They used to be unpopular among many, but suddenly they've gained popularity, which I can't understand. I didn't mention this before as I had forgotten about it, but to me, 45€ is a lot of money. To have my winnings taken away so sheerly even when I clearly won is a blatant act of cheek.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
