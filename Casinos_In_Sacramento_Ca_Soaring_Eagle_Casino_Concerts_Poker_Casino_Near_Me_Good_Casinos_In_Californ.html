<p>Better Collective informed the public that the second listing would, if approved, occur during the final quarter of the year</p>
<p>Better Collective, a Nasdaq Stockholm-listed company, unveiled its plans for a second listing. As announced by the company, it plans to also list its shares on Nasdaq Copenhagen.</p>
<p>Providing a few insights into its intentions, Better Collective informed the public that the second listing would, if approved, occur during the final quarter of the year.</p>
<p>Better Collective noted that the dual listing is subject to the publication of an exemption document by the company, approval by Nasdaq Copenhagen, fulfillment of certain conditions and other market conditions.</p>
<p>The company also noted that no offering of shares will be carried out in relation to the dual listing. The total number of company shares will remain unaffected by the listing, Better Collective added.</p>
<p>A Natural Next Step</p>
<p>Representatives addressed the announcement, elaborating on the company’s intentions. Better Collective’s co-founder and chief executive officer, Jesper Søgaard, said that the dual listing in Denmark is “a natural next step” for the Danish-incorporated company.</p>
<p>Søgaard noted that Better Collective has been steadily growing since the Swedish IPO in 2018, generating a lot of shareholder value. At the same time, the company continues its efforts to become a leading digital sports media group.</p>
<p>Combined with the fact that we experience an increased interest in our company from both current and potential institutional investors in Denmark, we believe now is the right time to dual list in Denmark. Jesper Søgaard, co-founder &amp; CEO, Better Collective</p>
<p>Jens Bager, the company’s board chairman, also commented on the matter, also remarking on Better Collective’s recent growth. According to him, the company is in a stronger position than ever before.</p>
<p>The listing in Sweden five years ago contributed a lot to Better Collective’s journey to becoming the leading digital sports media group. The dual listing in Denmark where Better Collective is headquartered is the logical development.</p>
<p>The entire management team led by the founders of the company has managed to build a resilient business and not least a strong organization that will enable Better Collective to further elevate its footprint within the digital sports media world. Jens Bager, chair, Better Collective</p>
<p>Bager concluded that the company hopes to attract the interest of notable Danish investors.</p>
<p>In other news, Better Collective recently decided to acquire Tipsbladet.dk in a $6.9 million deal.</p>
