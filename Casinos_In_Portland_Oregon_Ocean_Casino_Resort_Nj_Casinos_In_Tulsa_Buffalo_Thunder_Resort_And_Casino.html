<p>BetMGM has teamed up with The Athletic, becoming the publication’s exclusive sports betting partner.</p>
<p>The Athletic Welcomes BetMGM as Sports Betting Partner</p>
<p>US-focused subscription media The Athletic has revealed Roar Digital’s BetMGM Sportsbook as the company’s first sports betting partner in the United States. As a result, The Athletic is launching a dedicated content vertically, with The Athletic Betting Hub bringing updates from the world of sports wagering and tailoring content to appeal to a sports fan who loves to place the occasional flutter.</p>
<p>Combined with the other content on the website, BetMGM stands to gain a big exposure boost amid sports fans that may or may not be interested in betting. The Athletic is one of the world’s quickest growing media out there. Launched in 2016, it already has 1 million subscribers worldwide and employs over 400 dedicated writers.</p>
<p>The addition of a dedicated place for sports bettors to study up and inform themselves about anything tying into the sports betting market is a brand new opportunity for the publication as well as BetMGM, which is tailoring its growth strategy to reach the most people possible.</p>
<p>The Athletic will push forward with numerous content forms, including video, audio and written materials to reach audiences in their preferred medium. BetMGM, which is looking for more “immersive” opportunities, will try to achieve this through social media content with The Athletic.</p>
<p>A Content Alliance of New Generation</p>
<p>Roar Digital, which is jointly owned by Entain and MGM Resorts International, is definitely in a good position to help with any more tech-savvy solution. Entain recently teamed up with Verizon Media to develop those same immersive experiences BetMGM and The Athletic are now talking about. Commenting on the new alliance, the publication’s general manager of content operations, Evan Parker, had this to add:</p>
<p>“BetMGM has pioneered the online gaming industry and as we sought to establish The Athletic as a home for great betting content, we knew there would be no better partner.” -The Athletic general manager of content operations Evan Parker</p>
<p>BetMGM CRO Matt Prevost said that he is looking forward to seeing how engagement would work with The Athletic’s loyal leadership. As mentioned before, BetMGM is no stranger to media partnerships. It has integrated its odds with Yahoo and powered Yahoo Sportsbook.</p>
<p>As a result, Yahoo Sports’ app has been able to benefit from a direct live odds feed with BetMGM strengthening its own offering and boosting awareness for its products. Yahoo Sports readers may actually use their login details to access BetMGM’s sportsbook as long as they reside in one of the ten – as of the moment of writing – states where the betting platform is legal.</p>
