<p>Sportradar released a new update on the performance of its Alpha Odds tool, announcing that it has boosted clients’ profits by an average of 10% in 2023.</p>
<p>For reference, Alpha Odds is an automated odds recalculation tool which allows gambling companies to generate bespoke betting prices that take their risk exposure and liabilities in mind. Alpha Odds was launched in 2022 and has since benefitted over 60 betting operators across the globe.</p>
<p>What makes Alpha Odds special are its AI capabilities and pricing models that provide reliable probability prediction, allowing operators to manage their risk more effectively. When paired with real-time and predicted liquidity, Alpha Odds ensures trading efficiency maximization that corresponds to the trading strategies of Sportradar’s operator partners.</p>
<p>Sportradar also pointed out that an analysis of 17 million betting tickets across 60 of its clients showcased the reliability of the artificial intelligence models within the odds recalculation service.</p>
<p>According to Sportradar, Alpha Odds delivered an average trading efficiency improvement of 11% for clients, compared to the performance of its conventional odds product. This difference was attributed to Alpha Odds’ capabilities, which were able to adjust betting prices in real-time, thus stabilizing clients’ trading operations.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Alpha Odds’ financial reconciliation aspect was recently independently certified by auditors PwC, allowing the solution to achieve the International Standard in Assurance Engagement (ISAE) 3402 Type 1 for matching and client invoicing calculation systems.</p>
<p>This certification, Sportradar clarified, attests to the company’s robust computational practices and superior visibility when it comes to the processes behind Alpha Odds.</p>
<p>Darren Small, Sportradar’s senior vice president of managed trading services (MTS), commented on the matter, pointing out that Alpha Odds has been transforming trading betting markets since 2022.</p>
<p>Commenting on the recent certification, Small said that it confirms the effectiveness of the solution and shows that Sportradar is a company that partners can trust.</p>
<p>The independent ISAE certification validates the performance of Alpha Odds and provides confidence to clients that the associated financial aspects of the solution are transparent and accurate. Darren Small, SVP of MTS, Sportradar</p>
