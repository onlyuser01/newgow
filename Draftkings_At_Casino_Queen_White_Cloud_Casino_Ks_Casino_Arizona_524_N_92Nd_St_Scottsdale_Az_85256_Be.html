Will his decision have an impact on his players’ performances on the field? Mauricio Pochettino and his men certainly hope so.</p>

<p>Liverpool Going for the EPL Title</p>
<p>Winning the 2023-24 Premier League would be an ideal end to Jurgen Klopp’s tenure as the Liverpool coach. Right now, the Reds seem to be on the right track to achieving this. They’re sitting at the top of the table, with five points more than second-placed Manchester City.</p>
<p>However, the Cityzens have played one game fewer than them, meaning that every point matters. The Reds need to keep on winning if they want to stay in the No. 1 position in the standings. The good news is that they’re in great shape, with three straight wins in the Premier League.</p>
<p>More good news is that the Liverpool vs. Chelsea game is played on their turf. Anfield is the place where they’re undefeated this season, with an 8-2-0 record.</p>
<p>There is, however, some bad news coming from Liverpool. The worst of those is that they will be without their best player Mohamed Salah is out with a hamstring injury that could keep him sidelined for weeks.</p>
<p>Chelsea Doing Great in Big Games</p>
<p>Chelsea is 9-4-8 in the Premier League, which accounts for 31 points. The Blues are currently in the No. 9 position, which isn’t great. The good news, however, is that they still have a chance to break into the Top 6 and challenge for a spot in Europe.</p>
<p>More good news is that they’re in good shape, at least in the Premier League, where they’ve won their last three games. What’s also giving them confidence is that they tend to do well in big games. In their first duel with Liverpool, for instance, they drew 0-0. They also drew 4-4 with Manchester City and defeated Tottenham 4-1.</p>
<p>There are, however, some bad news as well. Chelsea will miss at least eight first-team players in the duel with Liverpool. Their top-scorer Nicolas Jackson is at the AFCON, while six other players are out with injuries.</p>
<p>Liverpool vs. Chelsea Prediction</p>
<p>There’s no scenario in which we can see Chelsea getting anything from this match. Liverpool is a much better team, not to mention that Wednesday’s game is played at Anfield.</p>
<p>Pick: Liverpool</p>
