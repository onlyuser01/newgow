    <h1>Bitcoin Casino Online The Palms Resort Casino Las Vegas What States Have Casinos Red Winds Casino St</h1>

<p>Awaiting my withdrawal payment of 977 euros which was requested in November 2019. Allwins are claiming payment was sent on the 24th December however my bank has done a trace &amp; theres nothing. Casino seems to be reluctant to do a trace &amp; is inventing obstacles &amp; issues which change from day to day. I do not believe this payment has been sent;</p>
<p>I have in total deposited nearly 3000 euro.</p>
<p>I believe this casino is in breach of numerous industry rules &amp; regulations. The main one being encouraging players to make deposits even when withdrawals are being reviewed with no intention of paying out. I provided all the documentation requested within days; I also repeatedly explained that my bank is a building society &amp; they used NatWest as a intermediary bank to accept foreign payments. All of this was supported by numerous letters &amp; bank statements. I was informed by withdrawal had been sent on the 24th December; after weeks of me having to chase them &amp; having my emails ignored or returned. I was repeatedly given conflicting, misleading &amp; contradictory information by everyone I spoke to.</p>
<p>In addition to this my funds were still showing as available to cancel on my account after over a month. This was then taken off &amp; processed or so I was led to believe</p>
<p>I believe they are operating without a uk licence; I believe this company have no intention of honouring withdrawals &amp; needs to be closed down. Having read the reviews online I am appalled to see that it is common practice for them to withhold payments &amp; they have been t believe this payment has been sent;</p>
