<p>Information about Siru Mobile casinos</p>
<p>Siru Mobile is a payment method that lets you pay for goods and services via your mobile: users simply call a number and make the payment in a few seconds. It also serves as an e-wallet, which lets customers store funds digitally and use them at a later date.</p>
<p>Many online merchants offer Siru Mobile as a way to pay or, in the case of online casinos, make a deposit. You can find out how to do that on this page, as well as information about Siru as a company, the pros and cons of its service, and how to find the best Siru online casino, and bonus, for you.</p>

<p>Siru Mobile: a Finnish mobile service that lets you pay in one phone call</p>
<p>A group of Finnish entrepreneurs formed Siru in 2011 to serve a growing online mobile payment market in Finland. The idea was simple: customers find an online product or service that they want and pay for it from their handset. They simply call an automated number to complete the transaction, then the payment, plus the cost of the call, appears on their phone bill. Users could also make transactions using SMS messages, depending on the merchant.</p>
<p>The idea was a success and Siru built a network of merchants who opted to host their method on their payment page. The company expanded from its base in Helsinki to a second office in Stockholm, and received rave reviews for offering a quick, easy payment solution. They also extended their operations to the UK, opening up another large customer base in the process.</p>
<p>Today, Siru also offers an e-wallet as part of its service. Siru users can store funds there and make direct payments, instead of calling a number. With e-wallets a rapidly growing market, Siru aim to extend their operations in the future and become a truly international payment method.</p>
<p>Pros and cons of Siru Mobile</p>
<p>Before signing up to Siru, it's a good idea to weigh up the pros and cons of its service, like with any other provider. Some of the positives are easy to see. The Siru payment process is extremely quick and simple, made up of three steps — checkout, phone call, confirmation — which is even presented as an interactive demo on their site. With just a few taps on the screen, you're done.</p>
<p>You don't even have to register with Siru; you just have to verify your phone number via SMS and the service will do the rest for you, as long as you're using a Siru-affiliated merchant. This means that your card details are kept private as you don't need to give them to Siru or anyone else.</p>
<p>Note: It doesn't require a credit card, simply an account with enough funds in it to cover the transaction and Siru's charge. This is good news for casino players who want to control their spending, and is in line with safe gambling practices.</p>
<p>One thing that might bug a new user, however, is the lack of clarity about Siru's charges. Their website vaguely mentions that the fee depends on the product or service, but they'll clearly state the amount before the payment. All well and good, but it would be better to know a percentage, for example, to save the user time in case they don't want to proceed.</p>
<p>You could also ask the question why customers have to make a phone call in the first place when so many services offer instant online payments: the concept might seem a little outdated to some. That said, it's e-wallet is an attractive, more modern feature in line with what other top methods such as Neteller and Skrill use.</p>
<p>One last possible negative is its lack of availability. Siru Mobileonly operates in three countries, so its potential user market is relatively small compared to other providers.</p>
<p>How to use Siru Mobile in online casinos</p>
<p>Siru's ease of use makes depositing money in an online casino simple. To make a deposit, you don't need to make a phone call like with other online purchases; the process is instead SMS-based. All you need is the mobile phone number and a Siru casino account. It should only take a few minutes to register with the casino and you'll be ready to go.</p>
<p>First, head to the casino's cashier and choose Siru Mobile as the deposit method. Then you'll have to enter your mobile number and deposit amount: do that and you'll receive an SMS to verify the transaction. Once verified, your funds should appear in your casino account immediately. You'll see the amount, plus Siru's fee, on your next monthly statement.</p>
<p>That said, even though deposits are so quick, withdrawals with Siru Mobile are not available — even to its e-wallet. It means that you'll have to use another payment method if you want to get hold of your winnings.</p>
