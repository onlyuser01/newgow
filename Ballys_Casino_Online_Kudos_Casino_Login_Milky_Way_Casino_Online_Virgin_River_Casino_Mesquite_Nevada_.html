<p>The continuously expanding iGaming supplier with a strong presence in Europe, Gaming Corps, announced a new partnership, allowing it to expand further the reach of its popular games. The company revealed Tuesday it joined forces with the online casino games provider, Pin-UP Casino. Under the terms of the freshly minted agreement, Gaming Corps agreed to supply its portfolio of games to the online gambling operator.</p>
<p>The collaboration marks an important achievement for the iGaming developer as it further grows its presence in multiple markets. This is because Pin-UP Casino currently offers its services in different Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and Latin American countries. At the same time, the online casino has a well-established presence in Turkey and other parts of the world, allowing Gaming Corps' engaging games to reach new audiences.</p>
<p>The latest agreement with the iGaming developer will further boost the offering available for Pin-UP Casino customers. Since its launch in 2016, the iGaming operator has been constantly growing the portfolio of games available to its clients which by now surpasses more than 10,000 games.</p>
<p>Danielle Calafato, Gaming Corps' CCO, shared her excitement about the new agreement with Pin-UP Casino in a statement. "Pin-UP Casino is led by professionals with more than 10 years’ experience in the gaming industry," she said. Additionally, Calafato pointed out that the iGaming operator has a strong presence in the online gambling vertical, offering a plethora of games.</p>
<p>Gaming Corps' CCO said that the company will be delighted to bring its portfolio of games to the iGaming operator. Finally, Calafato pointed out: "I am excited to offer our games to Pin-UP’s players as we continue to grow by bringing our games to more and more operators."</p>
<p>Thanks to the new collaboration, Pin-UP Casino's players will be able to access the full portfolio of games offered by Gaming Corps. Such titles include Mine, Table, Crash and Slot games, as well as the popular Plinko titles. Effectively the collaboration will bring games such as Jet Lucky 2, Raging Zeus, Penalty Champion and Coin Miner, among others, to customers of the popular CIS and LATAM operator.</p>
<p>Recently, Gaming Corps signed another deal allowing it to expand the reach of its content by joining forces with the all-in-one casino aggregator, Uplatform. The deal, announced last month, saw the iGaming developer provide its complete portfolio of games for the aggregator, expanding further the reach of its games to new audiences.</p>
