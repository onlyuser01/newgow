<p>International Game Technology (IGT), a multinational B2B producer of slot machines and gambling technology, has inked a new partnership deal with the Atlantic Lottery Corporation (ALC) in Canada.</p>
<p>IGT Will Supply ALC with 1,375 New VLTs</p>
<p>As per the deal, IGT’s Canadian subsidiary, IGT Canada Solutions, will provide its partner with more than a thousand new lottery machines. By the end of the year, the ALC will be armed with a total of 1,375 new CrystalDual 27 video lottery terminals.</p>
<p>The terminals are equipped with two state-of-the-art high-definition displays that provide players with premium visual experiences. The CrystalDual 27 VLTs back up great graphics with amazing sound and have a built-in charging port for mobile devices, improving the quality of life of players. The terminals are tailored to users’ needs and have an ergonomic design that makes turns playing games into a true delight.</p>
<p>IGT will power the aforementioned terminals with its critically-acclaimed suite of iGaming titles, including games such as The Wild Life™, Big City 5’s™, The Big Easy™, and Royal Spins Deluxe™. More content will be implemented at a later date, with IGT promising to provide the Atlantic Lottery Corporations with its The Price is Right VLT suite in 2023. This is big news as Canadian players will be able to access one of IGT’s most popular iGaming brands, inspired by a famous TV game show.</p>
<p>A Step to Modernize ALC’s Offerings</p>
<p>Patrick Daigle, president, and chief executive officer of the Atlantic Lottery Corporation, has spoken about the deal. He praised IGT for its cutting-edge gaming cabinets and exciting content, lauding the company for providing entertaining content to Atlantic Canada players for more than 30 years.</p>
<p>Daigle added that the addition of new VLTs will greatly enhance the user experience:</p>
<p>“Expanding on the number of new VLTs in ALC’s gaming venues with popular IGT themes allows us to deliver on our promise of providing our players with the most compelling gaming experiences.” Atlantic Lottery Corporation president and chief officer Patrick Daigle</p>
<p>David Flinn, senior vice president of Canada, South, and Central America for IGT, spoke about the machines that will be delivered to the ALC, emphasizing that their addition is an important step for the modernization of the corporation’s content. He added:</p>
<p>“These 1,375 CrystalDual 27 units, in addition to the more than 350 that are already in the ALC market, reinforce our commitment to the Lottery’s growth, and elevate gaming within the region with highly successful hardware.”</p>
<p>IGT continues to improve its business with crucial deals in the gaming sector. Yesterday, the company announced that it has reached a definitive agreement for the acquisition of iSoftBet.</p>
