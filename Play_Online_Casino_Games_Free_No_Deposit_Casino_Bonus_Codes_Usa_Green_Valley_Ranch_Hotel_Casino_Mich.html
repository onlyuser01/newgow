    <h1>Play Online Casino Games Free No Deposit Casino Bonus Codes Usa Green Valley Ranch Hotel Casino Mich</h1>

<p>I have had winnings received indeed. And I am well aware that there is limit per week. I was advised that I could withdraw my winnings as from monday(yesterday). Then my withdrawals were rejected. After going back and fourth with live support and then email. I was told that I would be able to withdraw on Thursday. Which is confusing. As to why once I’m told one thing and then I’m told another. Also on live support was told my account is not verified. Which it is , and they couldn’t give me information on what else do I need to verify. I was told that my withdrawals that I requested today "might be successful " I just need to wait.</p>
<p>the casino support is very unhelpful and are unable to give clear information.</p>
<p>also if I have placed withdrawals I would have rather they kept them as pending until limit is reset rather then returning that into the account as this would tempt most of the people to keep trying to win more and inter they lose their winnings.</p>
<p>they are very quick on taking deposits not allowing you to set deposit limit , but they restrict the amount you can withdraw.</p>
<p>the casino policy clearly doesn’t seem to work for the players in a way that it could lead to bigger loses</p>
<p>also see the attached responses from the casino, which confront what they are saying . Or just no one can be bothered to actually look up and give the right information</p>
