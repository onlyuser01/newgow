<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>i need some advice and i thought this was the best place to ask. I recently got married and moved to Austria because my wife is Austrian. Gambling is a lifelong passion of mine and has brought me a lot of luck (I even met my wife in a casino).</p>
<p>However, since moving here, I've only found conflicting information on whether or not online gambling is illegal here. Some say it's illegal, others encourage me to keep playing casino games but warn me to play via VPN.</p>
<p>I've tried doing my own research on the subject, but I'm still at a loss. Here is an example of what I mean: https://www.regionews.at/newsdetail/F Follow_Oesterreich_beim_Gluecksspiel_Gesetz_Deutschland_oder_der_Schweiz-386404 . There is more information here about Swiss and German gambling regulations than Austrian ones, and everywhere I look it's the same.</p>
<p>Can someone give me some advice on what to do, or at least tell me where to look? Gambling has gone from a passion to a nice passive income for me, and I don't want to give that up. I would like to understand the current situation better, because of course I want to avoid trouble with the law.</p>
<p>I would be grateful for any advice and any help. Thanks!</p>
