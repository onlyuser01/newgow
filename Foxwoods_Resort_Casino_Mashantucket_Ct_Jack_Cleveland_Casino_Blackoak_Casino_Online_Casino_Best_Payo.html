<p>The Haunted Carnival Slot Review</p>
<p>The Haunted Carnival may sound like a Scooby Doo episode, and it perhaps draws a lot of its vibes there. Yet, this is a game that will have less of mystery solving and more of winning!</p>
<p>The game’s action changes every ten spins with different characters unearthing fresh mysteries for you to explore, from a mummy to a lady clown, to a skeleton mariachi band player, and a witch, there is something for everyone.</p>
<p>If you are scared of Jack-o-Lanterns, don’t be, because the Pumpkinhead in The Haunted Carnival slot game awards Free Spins and Wilds. A spooky slot, you can experience The Haunted Carnival in its full horrific magnificence for real money or free as an instant no-download game right here!</p>
<p>Theme, Storyline, and Graphics: One Spooky Show after the Next</p>
<p>Nucleus Gaming presents you with a 50-payline slot which introduces you to the spooky atmosphere of a supernatural carnival where different scary characters will guide you through the macabre festivities.</p>
<p>There are straps of band that mummies use to patch themselves, bones, jack-o-lantern carve-outs, golden rims, flying brooms, and of course, the many different characters in the game that are also performers in this uncanny carnival.</p>
<p>Each one will add an authentic angle to your gameplay, and make you look forward to the next eerie-looking and spooky participant in the carnival, whether this is the Mummy, the Pumpkinhead, the Female Clown, or someone else.</p>
<p>The graphical elements of the game are used to accentuate the theme and bring you a captivating experience that is worth your while and strikes with its thematic accuracy and determination. The slot is on the spookier side indeed, but make no mistake – there is great profit to be made, so why not give it a proper spin?</p>
<p>The Haunted Carnival Slot Game Symbols and Payouts</p>
<p>The game comes with many excellent symbols that are first very well picked to suit the overall theme and setting, and secondly – they offer decent payouts. Even the low-paying ones are a little more original than what you are probably used to.</p>
<p>The game’s low symbols are stuff like an ominous red balloon, a flying broom a jack-o-lantern carved-out pumpkin, a human bone, and a bandage that has fallen off the shuffling mummy. For the high-paying symbols, you have the aforementioned characters, which include the Pumpkinhead, the Skeleton Mariachi Band Player, the Mummy, the Witch, and the Clown.</p>
<p>They all pay $80 except Pumpkinhead who pays $240 for five symbols respectively. Apart from this, each of the main high-paying symbols can take on much more significance in the core gameplay.</p>
<p>For example, a Pumpkinhead is considered a Wild Symbol, but if he appears in bigger configurations, such as four-symbol tall, he will bring various gameplay bonuses with him. This applies to pretty much everyone else, including the Mummy, the Witch, and so on.</p>
<p>But it’s not just that! There is a nice thematic angle here where the low-paying bandage symbol becomes a multiplier and adds to the multiplication of your winnings if you are in the Mummy’s act. Each ten spins will introduce a new “act” which is focused on one of the main characters, which will create unique synergies between the symbols.</p>
<p>The act is noted down in the bottom left corner, so you will never be at a loss to figure out what is coming next. Pumpkinhead is always a Wild Symbol, too, and he can mimic the abilities of others, while also triggering a 10 free spins level. It all sounds very exciting indeed!</p>
<p>Don’t worry too much about understanding how the game plays completely right now, as The Haunted Carnival is the best experience!</p>
<p>Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>Nucleus Gaming has outdone itself when it comes to the overall design of the game. The way that the scenery will change, and a new performing will emerge is both highly original and very fun indeed. You can enjoy rewarding gameplay that is strengthened by visual excellence and commitment to every subtle detail. The symbols are pleasantly animated to make it easy to differentiate between the different gameplay elements and never feel lost when you are playing The Haunted Carnival.</p>
<p>The Haunted Carnival Gameplay</p>
<p>The Haunted Carnival plays very easily owing to its intuitive user interface that will make it easy to follow through and enjoy yourself. You can adjust the bet size quickly through the arrows, picking anything from $0.10 to $20, and you can further set the max bet in one go or preload a bunch of rounds if you would much rather do it this way instead. Another matter is the access to the game’s paytable that can quickly catch you up on all the info you would want to know about playing.</p>
