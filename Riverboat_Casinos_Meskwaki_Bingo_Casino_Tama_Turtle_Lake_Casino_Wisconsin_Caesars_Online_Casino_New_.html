<p>Sports betting technology, content and media company Spotlight Sports Group announced it has signed a two-year partnership deal with bet365 to make the Stoke-on-Trent-based bookmaker title sponsor of the Racing Post’s show, Upping the Ante, for the fourth and fifth consecutive series.</p>
<p>Focusing on the Cheltenham Festival</p>
<p>The video content sponsorship agreement between Spotlight Sports Group and bet365 will see the betting operator sponsor 21 weekly shows and provide a dedicated preview special, as well as an informed ante-post view of the Cheltenham Festival.</p>
<p>“Our YouTube content has grown considerably in recent years and forms a hugely important part of our digital output,” said Spotlight Sports Group’s chief commercial officer Sam Houlding, outlining the credentials of Upping the Ante as one of the firm’s flagship shows, expecting that the “highly valued partnership with bet365 will help take it to the next level” when it launches its latest series this month.</p>
<p>Hosted by David Jennings, the upcoming series of Upping the Ante will feature legendary punter Johnny Dineen, famous for having his own pitch in the Cheltenham betting ring and regarded as one of the most astute judges in Ireland.</p>
<p>“Upping the Ante has built a very loyal following, with last season being especially successful and we are expecting an even better performance this season,” Houlding added.</p>
<p>Record Engagement with Racing Audiences</p>
<p>In the past year, Upping the Ante proved to be the YouTube show with record levels of engagement with racing audiences and one of the most-watched pre-Cheltenham Festival shows with more than 40% growth in total views year-over-year.</p>
<p>“We are delighted to continue this video partnership with Spotlight Sports Group as we know the quality of the Upping the Ante show is top tier,” commented a spokesperson for bet365, noting the continuous enhancement of the show and its potential for the betting operator to position itself as “a highly engaged and knowledgeable audience of bettors.”</p>
<p>As part of the video partnership, bet365 will also become a sponsor of The Big Jump Off, Racing Post’s ultimate preview of the upcoming 2022-23 jumps season.</p>
<p>Spotlight Sports Group said that the first episode of Upping the Ante will air on November 8 and subscribers of Racing Post’s YouTube channel will be able to catch all the action.</p>
<p>Earlier last month, the sports betting tech, content and media firm launched a new dedicated Racing Post app available for both Android and iOS mobile devices and offering users a brand-new odds comparison tool and data-led tips.</p>
