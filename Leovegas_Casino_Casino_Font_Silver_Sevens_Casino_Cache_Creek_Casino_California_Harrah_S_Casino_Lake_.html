<p>Liverpool vs Manchester United a.k.a. the Northwest Derby is one of the hottest rivalries in English soccer. The 211th edition of the derby is on the program on Sunday, March 5, 2023</p>
<p>After losing 5-2 to Real Madrid at home, Liverpool‚Äôs future in the Champions League doesn‚Äôt look good. That said, their only way to get back to the elite club competition is to finish in the Top 4 in the 2022-23 Premier League.</p>
<p>Right now, they‚Äôre six points behind the closest team (Tottenham) but the season is long, so they have plenty of time to get there. For that, however, the Reds need to win as many games as possible, including the one against Manchester United on Sunday.</p>
<p>Liverpool vs Manchester United Odds</p>
<p>Moneyline Odds Liverpool +150 Draw +240 Manchester United +175</p>
<p>Totals Over/Under Odds Over 2.5 Goals -149 Under 2.5 Goals +120 *Odds taken from bet365 on Thursday, March 2, 2023.</p>

<p>Liverpool Need to Start Playing Better Soccer ASAP</p>
<p>Jurgen Klopp‚Äôs men are sitting in the No. 6 position in the Premier League standings with an 11-6-7 record or 39 points. They‚Äôre six points behind fourth-placed Tottenham and 10 behind their next opponent, Manchester United.</p>
<p>They‚Äôre without a loss in the Prem in their last four games, conceding zero goals along the way. However, before that, they got hammered by Wolves 3-0. The Reds seem to have straightened out their defense ‚Äì at least in the EPL ‚Äì but their offense still looks dull.</p>

<p>‚ÄúLiverpool will be back. I'm convinced they will overcome this situation. They had many injuries and tough tests, but Jurgen Klopp is definitely the right man. He will lead Liverpool back up, from this season ‚Äì the players love him.‚Äù pic.twitter.com/0PisIuUxgU ‚Äî The Anfield Talk (@TheAnfieldTalk) March 1, 2023</p>
<p>The team with Mohamed Salah, Roberto Firmino, Cody Gakpo, and others hasn‚Äôt scored more than two goals per game since Boxing Day. There is some good news, though. Diogo Jota is finally fully fit and is ready to play for all 90 minutes for the first time since October.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for the Reds, there‚Äôs some bad news as well. Darwin Nunez is out with an injury, along with Luis Diaz, Thiago Alcantara, Ibrahima Konate, and Joe Gomez.</p>
<p>Manchester United in Celebratory Mood</p>
<p>The last game Manchester United played was the final of the 2023 Carabao Cup. The Red Devils defeated Newcastle 2-0 at Wembley, winning their first trophy in years.</p>

<p>The win over the Magpies was their 12th win of 2023, as well as their 10th straight game without a loss. Actually, the only defeat these guys have suffered this year happened to table leaders Arsenal in January. Even that was a close game ‚Äì the Red Devils lost 3-2 after conceding the crucial goal in the final minute of regulation.</p>
<p>Liverpool vs Manchester United Prediction</p>
<p>Led by in-form Marcus Rashford, Manchester United have been sensational this season. They‚Äôre in top shape right now, but we think some of their players need a break. Perhaps they don‚Äôt need to sit out Sunday‚Äôs game, but they probably need to take it slowly. That said, we probably won‚Äôt see a vintage display from the Red Devils.</p>
<p>This goes especially for the fact that they‚Äôre playing Liverpool at Anfield. The Reds are desperate for points and with the support of their fans, they‚Äôre going to give their utmost on Sunday.</p>
<p>Pick: Liverpool to win &amp; over 2.5 goals</p>
