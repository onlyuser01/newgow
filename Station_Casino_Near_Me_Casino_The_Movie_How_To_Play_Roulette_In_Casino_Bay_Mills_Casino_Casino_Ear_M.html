<p>MGA Games is taking its portfolio of iGaming titles a step further with a stronger focus on the African market.</p>
<p>The new partnership formed with Goat Interactive, and its gaming brand Premier Bet, will target the region and help local players experience MGA Games’ unique products, tailored to audiences of all backgrounds.</p>
<p>MGA Games Begins Expansion Throughout Africa</p>
<p>The agreement, says the company, is just the beginning of a bigger expansion on the continent and one which will bring strong dividends for all participants and stakeholders.</p>
<p>Africa has long been underappreciated as a continent where sports betting and iGaming are actually long-overdue for the arrival of major brands and products. 888 Holdings and Betway have been among some of the companies to move in quickly.</p>
<p>Suppliers are also following suit with the arrival of MGA Games’ distinguishable products, such as GT World Challenge and Lucky Dragon at first. More games will be added as the partnership matures, though, the company explained in a press release.</p>
<p>Premier Bet players will further have the opportunity to explore games such as Buffalo Bingo, Sweet Home, Bingo Sea, Magician, Roma Bingo, Calaca Party, and so much more. MGA Games already has a plan about how far it can penetrate the African continent and its nascent iGaming market.</p>
<p>Sales director Javier Lanfranchi noted that the company’s products were already present in a number of jurisdictions across the region, including Cameroon, Congo, DR Congo, Nigeria, Senegal, Tchad, Zambia, and Ghana. He added:</p>
<p>We maintain a constant innovative vision that we contribute to in each and every one of our productions: be they slot games, video bingos, or table games. We care about offering titles with a differential value that provide maximum profitability to our clients. Sales director Javier Lanfranchi</p>
<p>MGA Games Delivers Content with SOFTSWISS</p>
<p>Lanfranchi is confident that the addition of these games will give a further content boost to Goat Interactive and its brand. MGA is capable of delivering its games in a quick and seamless manner thanks to a distribution agreement with SOFTSWISS.</p>
<p>The company representative further praised the collaboration with SOFTSWISS and the Game Aggregator which is a powerful tool for the delivery of advanced gaming solutions. Africa continues to draw interest from both suppliers and operators who are stepping firmly into the market to harness its potential.</p>
