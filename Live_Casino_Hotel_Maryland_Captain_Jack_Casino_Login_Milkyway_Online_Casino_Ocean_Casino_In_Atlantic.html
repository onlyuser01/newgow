    <h1>Live Casino Hotel Maryland Captain Jack Casino Login Milkyway Online Casino Ocean Casino In Atlantic</h1>

<p>A partnership with the Malta-based online marketing company Raketech Group will see Real Luck Group’s signature betting brand Luckbox promoted across the internet.</p>
<p>Raketech Group Will Promote Luckbox</p>
<p>As per the deal, Raketech Group will use its robust network of affiliate websites to spread the word about Luckbox’s premium casino games and sports and esports betting offerings. The affiliate company will join Luckbox’s list of partners as the brand pursues further growth through increased traffic.</p>
<p>Mike Bazzi, Luckbox’s head of affiliates, spoke on the deal. He pointed out that Raketech is one of the biggest marketing companies in the online gambling industry and is known for its proven record of helping companies promote their business. Bazzi noted that increased traffic – something Raketech’s solutions excel at – is a core pillar of Luckbox’s growth strategy.</p>
<p>Bazzi added that the deal with Raketech Group seeks to expand Luckbox’s player base and subsequently increase the company’s revenues. He is looking forward to polishing Luckbox’s marketing strategies and taking player acquisition rates to a new level.</p>
<p>Luckbox Has Big Plans for 2022</p>
<p>Few companies are as bullish in their growth efforts as Luckbox is. The company has demonstrated its readiness to use each and every tool at its disposal to popularize its brand and deliver the best experiences to its user base.</p>
<p>Starting January this year, Luckbox charted a year-long plan for its key aims in 2022. Increased player acquisition and attracting new investors sat at the top of the operator’s list of priorities. These ambitions reflect Luckbox’s strong recovery now that the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided.</p>
<p>Thomas Rosander, Real Luck Group’s chief executive officer, had put it the following way:</p>
<p>“The target is now to increase our player base and revenues. We benefited from very robust market sector tailwinds earlier in 2021 and raised $17.8m in a private placement in March, the vast majority of which we have conserved, with the intent of deploying towards player marketing/revenue growth.”</p>
<p>The US and Canadian markets remain a top priority for Luckbox. The company submitted an application to the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario, seeking to gain access to the province’s upcoming regulated market. If approved, Luckbox will have the chance to launch its offerings in its home market and improve its financial results even more.</p>
<p>At the beginning of March, Luckbox once again showed its drive to keep growing by appointing the experienced growth guru Bo Wänghammar to the company’s board of directors.</p>
