    <h1>Vegas Gems Sweepstakes Casino No Deposit Bonus Brango Casino Review Hard Rock Casino Sioux City Iowa</h1>

<p>I have requested that my Game Account be closed at Wallacebet Casino on 23/02/2022, citing gambling addiction (vouchers for this in an email). My account has been closed upon my request. However, I have managed to open an account at Nucleonbet Casino on 13/06/2022, a sister casino in Wallacebet (license MGA / B2C / 233/2013 issued to LCS Limited, C-64070). I got a total deposit of € 1200 which I lost. That’s when I realized it was Wallacebet’s sister casino.</p>
<p>I have contacted Nucleonbet about this and requested a refund of the deposits, claiming that my account at the sister casino has been closed. The casino does not agree to take any responsibility for this and therefore does not agree to return deposits. My account with Nucleonbet is now closed because I requested that it be closed.</p>
<p>Can you help me with this, because I think it is wrong for me to have opened an account / deposited money even though my sister casino has been closed.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
