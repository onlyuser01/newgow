<p>Play’n GO has existing agreements with many operators in Italy and hopes to maintain its leadership position</p>
<p>Play’n GO, a leading supplier of gaming entertainment, has reinforced its presence in Italy with a new integration. The provider’s critically-acclaimed content signed a new agreement with the local powerhouse Sisal, agreeing to power its offering with games.</p>
<p>Sisal, which is one of the biggest gambling companies in Italy, will now be able to offer its players some of the best gambling titles Play’n GO has developed.</p>
<p>Under the agreement, Play’n GO’s flagship slot game, Book of Dead, will launch with Sisal. An additional major title that will be added to the operator’s platform is Tower Quest, another Play’n GO hit. More games will be added to the operator’s platform in the near future, Play’n GO announced.</p>
<p>The supplier noted that the current agreement will strengthen its relationship with Flutter Entertainment, Sisal’s partnership company. Flutter, which has other existing agreements with Play’n GO, acquired the Italian operator back in December 2021.</p>
<p>Play’n GO Wants to Lead the Italian Market</p>
<p>The new content deal was addressed by Play’n GO’s regional director of Southern Europe and Latin America, Emilie Zamponi. She said that the provider is very excited to join forces with Sisal, a leading operator in Italy. This agreement, Zamponi noted, will cement Play’n GO’s leadership position in the local market.</p>
<p>The director also talked about where Play’n GO is now. She noted that the provider has existing agreements with many of the top dogs in Italy and is happy about the opportunity to supply Sisal as well.</p>
<p>This announcement means that Play’n GO now have formal partnerships with the 10 leading operators in Italy, one of the biggest gambling markets in the world. We are very much looking forward to working with Sisal to provide a safe, exciting gaming experience for their players.

<p>The current news comes a few days after Play’n GO announced that it has successfully renewed its supplier license in Sweden. The company will therefore continue to offer its products in that market, offering best-in-class games to its local partners.</p>
<p>Play’n GO considers its licensing in Sweden to be an important step for the company, considering that the Nordic country is where it was founded.</p>
<p>In March, the supplier expanded its slots portfolio with a new Greek mythology-themed game called Pandora’s Box of Evil. The release of this game came a month after the studio released Legion Gold, a title inspired by the Roman Empire’s heyday.</p>
