<p>The Hong Kong enterprise reported a massive spike in their profits mostly attributable to their Russian Integrated resort, Tigre de Cristal</p>
<p>Total revenue marks a 24% climb during the first half of 2019</p>
<p>Russian based Tigre de Cristal to see Phase 2 expansion in early 2022 due to slight delay in development</p>
<p>In comparison to profits generated during the first half of 2018, which stood at HK$2.6 million, this year the Summit Ascent group reported a drastic jump to HK$42.8 million generated only during the first half of 2019.</p>
<p>The Tigre de Cristal</p>
<p>The Russia-based casino and resort, Tigre de Cristal, opened back in October 2015 and is located in Primorye, near the Vladivostok port. The resort offers more than 100 hotel rooms, 800+ slot machines and at least 25 VIP gaming tables, as well as 15 mass-market baccarat tables and 25 other mass-market tables, which provide a variety of games. And it seems like it is becoming the center of attention for many high-roller VIPs, looking for a quick brake.</p>
<p>This comes as no big surprise, bearing in mind that earlier in April the foremost VIP promoter in Asia – the Suncity Group – acquired an approximately 30% stake of the establishment.</p>
<p>The casino and especially slot games have contributed a great deal to this years’ striking results. The total revenue of the group during the first six months of 2019 reported a 24% growth at HK$257.3 million. Tigre de Cristal’s gaming revenue alone has generated HK$236.9 million, mainly from its VIP games section and slot machines.</p>
<p>Slots alone saw a HK$91 million spike in profits, which comes after an increase in handle by 22% at $HK1.6 billion. Mass table games, on the other hand, saw a slight 8% decrease attributed mostly to lower win percentage and the weakness of the Russian ruble, which affect conversion negatively. Lastly, hotel operations also saw an increase of almost 20% as compared to last years’ equivalent period.</p>
<p>Future Development Plans</p>
<p>The establishment is operated directly by Oriental Regent Ltd., and Summit Ascent currently own a 60% stake. This also generates a 3% management fee from the entirety of the net gaming revenue.</p>
<p>Oriental Regent, on their side, generated an adjusted property EBITDA of HK$108.5 million, which – in comparison to the first half of 2018’s earnings – stands for a 62% increase.</p>
<p>Just recently, the Summit Ascent group have reported a slight delay in the implementation of the Phase 2 development, which is pushed back a bit for early 2022. The reasons cited for the delay concern mainly design adjustments, which came to pass following Suncity Group’s commentary on the project.</p>
<p>The expansion is expected to set-off during the first quarter of 2020 and will entice customers with a widened culinary section, including Korean barbecue, a Chinese hot pot, noodle bars and others.</p>
