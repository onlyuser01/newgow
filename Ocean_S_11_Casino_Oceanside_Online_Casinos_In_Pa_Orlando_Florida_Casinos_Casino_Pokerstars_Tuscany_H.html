<p>Light &amp; Wonder is going to facilitate another high-profile content deal between BetMGM and Design Works Gaming. BetMGM will benefit from Design Works Gaming’s growing portfolio of distinct games that have been developed with the preferences of the North AmericaniGaming audience in mind.</p>
<p>Now, Design Works Gaming’s titles will be available to BetMGM in New Jersey, which will serve as a litmus test for the companies’ collaboration while they identify other markets where the products may be launched if both parties are happy with the results.</p>
<p>The integration with BetMGM’s gaming portfolio will be carried out through Light &amp; Wonder’s dedicated OpenGaming platform. This will allow for quick and effortless integration into BetMGM’s existing gaming portfolio and make it easier for consumers to gain immediate access to Design Works Gaming’s products</p>
<p>Design Works Gaming is based in Arizona and as such, it’s dedicated to fully developing and harnessing the preferences of the North American iGaming audiences, something that Light &amp; Wonder Digital Partnerships DirectorSteve Mayes fully acknowledges.</p>
<p>Mayes used the announcement of the partnership to praise Design Works Gaming’s continuous efforts in developing products that are tailored to the US market and said:</p>
<p>"Being able to put its content in front of such a large audience provided by BetMGM can only accelerate DWG’s growth and it’s fantastic to be part of a great success story."</p>
<p>He is hardly alone in welcoming this partnership. BetMGM Director of Gaming Oliver Barlett stated that Design Works Gaming is an echelon for the development of innovative and fresh content that strikes home with North American audiences. As such, the company was excited to have these products added to its own offering.</p>
<p>Previously, Design Works Gaming secured a license in Connecticut, doubling down on the company’s commitment to the North American market. Interestingly, Design Works Gaming has also been expanding in Europe through a partnership with 888. Should all go well in New Jersey, BetMGM could decide to take this road on the show and roll out the products in other jurisdictions, including Michigan, Pennsylvania, and beyond.</p>
<p>BetMGM is a prominent brand in the iGaming market. Starting out as an all-out sportsbook, the company has gradually ramped up its presence in iGaming. As a result, the addition of products such as the games provided by Design Works Gaming gives BetMGM a competitive edge and makes it a player-favorite option in the United States.</p>
