<p>Become a Wild West Legend</p>
<p>The Game With No Name is the developer’s take on the much-appreciated Wild West theme. Chief executive officer Lloyd Butler said the company has gone “to great lengths” to make sure the game would successfully deliver the type of explosive experience players usually expect from these games. Butler added he expected The Hame With No Name to “go down in legend” as one of the most exciting slots they have ever played.</p>
<p>Players are invited to saddle up, start walking through the saloon doors and turn into the greatest big win bounty hunters in the Wild West. The base game introduces the standard reel matrix featuring a series of specific Wild West symbols including revolvers, liquor bottles and cacti, along with standard spades, diamonds, and hearts.</p>
<p>The game also features a series of wild symbols that could land at random times, instantly boosting the win potential of the game.</p>
<p>The Free Spins Gold Sheriff Badge</p>
<p>Landing a minimum of three of these symbols during the base game will trigger the Free Spins feature. In it, players are rewarded with eight Free Spins along with two more free spins for any additional triggering symbols. Players also receive one more free spin every time the Gold Sheriff symbol drops during the Free Spins round. When the Revolver symbol lands on any of the reels during the Free Spins feature, players can expect some massive wins.</p>
<p>ReelsUp and Revolver Shoot Out Features</p>
<p>The game comes with a special set of reels covered in bonus symbols placed above the standard grid. Here, players can unlock the biggest bounty possible by landing the Revolver symbol on the reel at the center. This automatically causes the Revolver Shoot Out bonus to pop up. Players randomly receive a minimum of one and a maximum of six shots. The Revolver aiming at the bonus reels with Wild symbols, Extra Shots and Cash Prize Multiplier could beef up the prize between x1 and x100. The same Revolver could unlock extra Free Spins and make a Dynamite Symbol Reveal. Once the player is left with zero shots in the revolver’s chamber, the special feature comes to an end.</p>
<p>The Game With No Name has been approved for launch in all Malta jurisdictions, Spain, the UK, Italy, Sweden, and Denmark and it will be available in more than 30 languages. Last October, Live 5 Gaming expanded its footprint on Canadian soil after British Columbia’s Gaming Enforcement and Policy Branch in British Columbia gave it the green light to launch in the province.</p>
