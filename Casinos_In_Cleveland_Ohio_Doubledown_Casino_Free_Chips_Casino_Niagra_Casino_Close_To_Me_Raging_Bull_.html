    <h1>Casinos In Cleveland Ohio Doubledown Casino Free Chips Casino Niagra Casino Close To Me Raging Bull</h1>

<p>Good day,</p>
<p>I am 16 years old and paid â‚¬ 5080 on the Stake7 site.</p>
<p>I applied to support for a refund in accordance with Â§5.7 (reimbursement of deposits to minors).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the casino did not want to adhere to its own terms and conditions and came up with the following "excuse":</p>
<p>------ beginning of quote</p>
<p>Hello Mr. B ***,</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you are not entitled to any repayment in this case. According to our terms and conditions, which you accepted when registering, it is your responsibility to state your date of birth accurately and correctly.</p>
<p>We refer to the following clauses:</p>
<p>"5.1. You warrant that:</p>
<p>5.1.1. You are not younger than:</p>
<p>5.1.1.1 . 18 (eighteen) years; or</p>
<p>5.1.1.2 . Any legal minimum age required for gambling or gambling activities under applicable law or jurisdiction that applies to you ("the legal minimum age"); and</p>
<p>5.1.2 . The data provided when opening your account are correct; and</p>
<p>5.1.3 . You are the legal owner of the funds in your account. "</p>
<p>The clauses under 5.7 refer exclusively to cases where an underage person with an accurate date of birth has managed to register on our site. In your case that would be your real date of birth: 02.03.2004. However, since you deliberately entered your date of birth incorrectly (as 02.03.2002) in order to bypass the youth ban, you are not entitled to a refund.</p>
<p>----- Quote end</p>
<p>Since in my opinion this "excuse" has no legal value, since it is assumed with Â§5.7 that the previous Â§ was disregarded, I hope for a refund.</p>
<p>In addition, Â§5.7 does NOT say "If she should be able to get in despite the protection of minors, your stakes will be refunded", but very clearly "You are a minor? You can prove that you are a minor? Then you will get your deposits back . "</p>
<p>I really hope you can help me somehow ...</p>
<p>Stay healthy and I wish you a nice week ðŸ™‚</p>
<p>lg</p>
<p>Niels</p>
