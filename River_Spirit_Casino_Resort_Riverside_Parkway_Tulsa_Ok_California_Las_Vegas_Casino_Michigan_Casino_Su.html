<p>IGT’s Powerbucks and MegaJackpots games are now deployed coast-to-coast across Canada, the company noted</p>
<p>International Game Technology, a global leader in gaming, announced a new expansion in Canada. As revealed by the company, its high-performing omnichannel Powerbucks and MegaJackpots games will be available with PlayAlberta.ca.</p>
<p>Thanks to PlayAlberta, which is operated by Alberta Gaming, Liquor and Cannabis (AGLC), IGT’s Powerbucks and MegaJackpots games are now deployed coast-to-coast across Canada.</p>
<p>IGT describes Powerbucks as the world’s first omnichannel WAP game that links the jackpot prize pool between gaming machines and digital games. As a result, it provides fans with a greater degree of flexibility.</p>
<p>MegaJackpots, on the other hand, is IGT PlayDigital’s exclusively digital wide area progressive jackpot network.</p>
<p>Thanks to the integration, Albertan players can now experience some of the most memorable titles IGT has to offer. This includes hits such as Powerbucks Wheel of Fortune Exotic Far East, Powerbucks Wheel of Fortune Ruby Riches, MegaJackpots Cleopatra and MegaJackpots Wolf Run.</p>
<p>SVP Flinn Is Excited about the Alberta Launch</p>
<p>David Flinn, IGT’s senior vice president for Canada, South and Central America, released a statement on the launch in Alberta, saying that his team is thrilled to expand the “wildly successful” Powerbucks network to AGLC. As a result, the company’s omnichannel WAP jackpot games are available across all Canadian jurisdictions where iGaming is legal and regulated, Flinn added.</p>
<p>AGLC players will have even more opportunities to win big rewards with the launch of IGT PlayDigital’s MegaJackpots games featuring top-performing IGT themes. For AGLC, our wide area progressive games help differentiate its online casino, drive growth and provide the ultimate player experiences.

<p>IGT Remains a Leader in Gaming</p>
<p>IGT is a global leader thanks to its experience in lottery, gaming and sports betting, as well as to its knack for creating compelling and innovative content. The company leverages the latest tech to roll out unparalleled solutions and deliver unrivaled gaming experiences to the players.</p>
<p>With a presence in over 100 regulated markets, IGT is one of the most influential gaming providers. The company employs around 10,500 employees across its multiple offices.</p>
<p>In other news, IGT recently teamed up with Scientific Games and SAGA to form a consortium that will execute a concession agreement for the lottery in Brazil’s State of Minas Gerais.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the gaming leader evaluated strategic options about its Global Gaming and PlayDigital divisions. At the beginning of June, on the other hand, IGT inked a 10-year Wheel of Fortune agreement with Sony.</p>
