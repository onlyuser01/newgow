    <h1>What Casinos Can You Gamble At 18 Bwin Casino Aria Hotel And Casino Casinos Us Casino In Greenville</h1>

<p>Popular Stockholm-based slots creator Fantasma Games has decided to revisit one of its most successful titles in history, Medallion Megaways, and give it a full makeover. The company has recently re-released a second version of the slot with a fresh new design and a more lucrative selection of bonus features.</p>
<p>The Fresh Release Will Be Available to More Players</p>
<p>Not only is the new release meant to add more suspense to the gameplay through its new bonus features, but it will also address the need for a more expanded number of players. Fantasma Games’ founder Frederik Johansson stated that the relaunch of their popular title under Relax Gaming would help them reach a larger number of operators in the industry. Automatically, this means the game will cater to a wider selection of players, with positive projections regarding the impact of the release.</p>
<p>The decision to revamp the game was not a difficult one, as Medallion Megaways was already one of the most sought-after Fantasma Gaming titles to date. Looking to give the old gameplay a fresh twist while improving the overall design and feel, the provider has managed to give players waiting with bated breath plenty of reasons to celebrate. This is not Fantasma Games’ only attempt to respond to the increased demand for top-tier products online. Last September, the company purchased Wiener Games as a means of scaling its production capacity. In April, Fantasma Games signed an agreement with Scientific Games to create several exclusive games that would become available on the OpenGamingTM platform.</p>
<p>What Does the Relaunched Slot Bring New to the Table?</p>
<p>The upgraded mystical-themed game is a 6×6 reel slot that will carry players to a plush location located in the heart of the desert. The new game will reunite revolutionary game mechanics and an impressive list of bonus features meant to make players’ gameplay more exciting than ever. The game features up to 46 656 ways to win, with a maximum win of x20,000 the bet up for grabs.</p>
<p>Medallion Megaways is a highly volatile game with an RTG of 96.13% and a minimum bet set at €0.20. The maximum bet is limited to €50. Here is a quick breakdown of the game’s most important elements.</p>
<p>Game Symbols</p>
<p>The original game introduced players to the popular and rather mysterious tarot theme, expressed through high symbols part of the greater arcana: the Sun, the Moon, the Star, and the World. The relaunched version does no longer includes the Sun symbol. The medallion symbol looks like a spinning coin and it can suddenly pop up at the end of any reel spin during the base game, enabling or disabling stone symbols and their features. A stone symbol plays the role of an expanding wild symbol, taking over the entire surface of the reel once it lands, while also rewarding the player with a multiplier of up to x6.</p>
<p>Game Features</p>
<p>Void Respins, Expanding Wilds, avalanches, the free spins mode, and progressive multipliers are the hottest attractions part of the revamped version of Medallion Megaways. The Void Respin and the Expanding Wild features can be triggered out of the blue, at any given moment while engaged in the base game. The Void Respin grabs ten random symbols and proceeds to respin them. Next, the symbols are taken off the reels, and an avalanche of extra symbols takes their place for even more winning combos.</p>
<p>The free spins bonus round is the main star feature of the new slot game. The all-seeing eye symbol announces 20 upcoming spins tied to the progressive multiplier part of expanding wilds. In free spins mode, the multiplier goes up with each new avalanche, and not just with consecutive avalanches.</p>
<p>Medallion Megaways will be available to operators starting January 18th through the Relax Gaming Ltd Silver Bullet platform.</p>
