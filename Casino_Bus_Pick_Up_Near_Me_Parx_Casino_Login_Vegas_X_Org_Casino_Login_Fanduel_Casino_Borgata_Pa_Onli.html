<p>Steph Curry to Kick It Up a Notch?</p>
<p>The 34-year-old 3-point field goal expert Steph Curry is the man around whom everything revolves in Golden State. Unfortunately for the Warriors, he had to spend a lot of time off the court this season, which explains why his team is .500 (26-26) in 2022-23.</p>
<p>Steph Curry said bigger picture he‚Äôs still ‚Äúmostly optimistic‚Äù about this Warriors season: ‚ÄúVery aware we‚Äôve got to figure some stuff out.‚Äù pic.twitter.com/80OYHsJ6Rv ‚Äî Anthony Slater (@anthonyVslater) February 3, 2023</p>
<p>A shoulder injury forced Curry to stay out for almost four weeks in December/January, missing 11 games. He made his comeback on January 10, and has been improving his form since. He started slowly with 59 points in total in his first three games after the injury but has since upped his numbers. He scored 30+ in three of his previous five games.</p>
<p>Curry will have to do the same (or even better) on Saturday evening if he wants his team to beat Luka Doncic &amp; Co.</p>
<p>Luka Doncic Is Playing Incredible Basketball Right Now</p>
<p>When it comes to the Dallas Mavericks, it‚Äôs all about Luka Doncic. The Slovenian player has been nothing short of brilliant in the 2022-23 season and is one of the top candidates for the MVP award. The best thing is that his form seems to keep improving all the time.</p>
<p>On Monday, we saw him score 53 points against the Detroit Pistons, which was his second-highest-scoring game since joining the NBA.</p>
<p>Luka Doncic took a hard fall and exited the game after suffering a right heel contusion injury ü´£pic.twitter.com/4qkfHNhaWq ‚Äî BasketNews (@BasketNews_com) February 3, 2023</p>
<p>In his most recent game, he put away 31 points, which is still a good number. It was good enough for his team to beat the New Orleans Pelicans. Unfortunately, Doncic injured his heel in that game, but recent reports suggest he should be alright by Saturday.</p>
<p>Dallas Mavericks vs Golden State Warriors Prediction</p>
<p>The Warriors are a team that scores a lot of points (118.0 PPG), but one that also concedes a lot of points (118.3 PPG). Meanwhile, the Mavericks are equally great both offensively and defensively, especially when Doncic is in a good mood. And he really is at the moment, which we think could be the crucial factor in Saturday‚Äôs game. We think Doncic will lead the Mavericks to another win.</p>
<p>Pick: Dallas Mavericks to win &amp; over 233.5 points</p>
