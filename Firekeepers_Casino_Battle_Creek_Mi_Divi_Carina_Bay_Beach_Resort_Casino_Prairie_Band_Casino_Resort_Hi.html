<p>The leading operator offering live betting, PointsBet, announced Tuesday it expanded significantly its live betting offering for soccer. The company's recent announcement comes just ahead of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar set to start this week on November 20.</p>
<p>Debuting its expanded offering as a part of its OddsFactory, PointsBet will offer more than 130 live market betting options for soccer. This is the most out of any other US sportsbook and once again reaffirms the company's position as a market leader in live betting.</p>
<p>According to a statement released by the company on November 15, 2022, its users will have "have access to an unmatched number of one-minute and five-minute Lightning Bet markets, including Free Kick Awarded, Goal Scored, Goal Kick Awarded, Shots On Target, and much more." Further fueling the customers' betting experiences, the company said that its users can also build a Same Game Parlay live or pre-match.</p>
<p>The last World Cup was played back in 2018, a year that marked the repeal of PASPA in the United States. After PASPA's repeal, the legalization and regulation of sports betting were left in the hands of lawmakers in different states. Since PASPA's repeal, according to the American Gaming Association (AGA), sports betting is live and legal in 31 US states as well as DC. On the other hand, five more US states have legalized the activity and anticipate its launch.</p>
<p>Now, considering the growing popularity of sports betting, PointsBet's expanded offering via OddsFactory comes as no surprise. In fact, the company plans to meet the high demand for live betting just in time for the World Cup.</p>
<p>Mark Hughes, PointsBet USA's Chief Product Officer, said on the topic: "Our continued investment in elevating our in-house sports betting technology and OddsFactory, our proprietary trading feeds solution, has allowed PointsBet to produce up to 8 billion calculations in less than one second when we have a full suite of live games running in parallel."</p>
<p>He explained that the company offers its customers a variety of live betting options for all sports including soccer. Finally, Hughes pointed out: "PointsBet gives bettors more live betting options on more matches than anywhere else in the US."</p>
<p>Johnny Aitken, PointsBet USA's CEO, added that back in 2018, the World Cup launched a few months after the legalization of sports betting started to expand in the US. He outlined that after a few years have passed, now, more than 100 million Americans have the option to place a legal sports wager.</p>
<p>Aitken added: "Soccer is ripe with opportunities to tap into live betting, and we are gearing up for an immense surge in soccer betting activity by delivering our Soccer OddsFactory integration ahead of what will no doubt be an incredible tournament." In conclusion, he explained that PointsBet continues to invest resources with the goal to become the go-to sportsbook for the World Cup.</p>
