    <h1>Movies At Red Rock Casino Top Online Casino Golden Nugget Lake Tahoe Hotel Casino Spinfinity Casino</h1>

<p>Good day,</p>
<p>I played at the named casino. I then asked in live chat if there was a maximum win amount from the free spins level. This was denied according to the chat. (See the screenshot.)</p>
<p>I received 50 free spins and wagered them. But then I only got 100 euros credited. Before that, my balance was about 600 euros.</p>
<p>I then wrote to the support and they said that there is now a limit. However, this referred to the 20 free spins that I had previously received. But it was about the 50 free spins (which have completely different bonus conditions than the 20). The live chat referred to a completely different promotion. I am referring to the 50 free spins I received.</p>
<p>After further inquiries, the live chat wrote me that it was an error and will be forwarded to the IT department. After 8 days without any answer I contacted the support again and now the frightening lie that there is a maximum profit after all. This is according to the terms and conditions. But not with the free spins that I received and implemented.</p>
<p>This could be either a scam or a dirty job on the part of the casino and just a misunderstanding. Please help me.</p>
