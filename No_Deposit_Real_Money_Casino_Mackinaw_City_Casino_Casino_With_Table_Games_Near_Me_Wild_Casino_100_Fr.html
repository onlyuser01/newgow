<p>The digital marketplace for selling lottery tickets, Lotto.com, has announced a new seven-figure winner from a game that was purchased from the platform</p>
<p>Lottto.com confirmed that one lucky customer in Colorado has won $3 million from a MONOPOLY 500X scratch ticket that was originally purchased on Lotto.com.</p>
<p>MONOPOLY 500X and 3-Million Dollar Payday</p>
<p>This comes only a few months after introducing digital scratch ticket offering in several states, including Colorado, Ohio, and Texas, and demonstrates the potential of the vertical, which Lotto.com has realized and is now fully committed to exploring a notch further.</p>
<p>The winning ticket went to a player from Colorado, who has been an active user on the platform and has used Lotto.com to buy different tickets and participate in various games. However, it was MONOPOLY 500X that has made all the difference for her.</p>
<p>Although this story isn’t quite as impressive as the New York man who won $10m back-to-back in two consecutive years from the lottery, it’s still a fantastic opportunity to explore digital offerings to purchase tickets and win.</p>
<p>Lotto.com made sure to interview the lucky punter who was beyond herself with the news that she had won:</p>
<p>I couldn’t believe that after two minutes of realizing I won the top prize, I received a call from Lotto.com letting me know they were on their way with the ticket. MONOPOLY 500X winner</p>
<p>The winner said that Lotto.com’s service was exceptional and that she received a call from the company only 2 minutes after the draw and realizing that she had won. The agents on the line confirmed that company representatives were already traveling to her place to hand her over the physical ticket.</p>
<p>Lotto.com has made it possible for customers to purchase digital copies of the tickets, which are scooped up by Lotto.com and stored by the company. Lotto.com simply enables customers to buy tickets through a digital device and play without the hassle of procuring the ticket per se.</p>
<p>Expanding Lotto.com’s Offer to Make Players Happy</p>
<p>The company also used this opportunity to remind the public that most of the lottery operations in different states are actually used to fund various state-run programs, including pension funds, education, scholarships, and more. Lotto.com has been significantly expanding its offer, and the latest launches add to the company’s operations in Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, and Arkansas, amongst others.</p>
<p>Lotto.com also provides tickets for the Mega Millions and Powerball and is determined to become one of America’s finest and best-established digital lottery ticket vendors, something that the company believes it has already achieved.</p>
<p>As of July this year, Lotto.com also had 1.1 million customers, but these numbers has surely grown with the new states introduced to the company’s offering.</p>
