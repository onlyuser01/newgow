<p>Betting and gaming affiliate company Leadstar Media AB announced its product portfolio has been expanded with a new website aimed at Spanish-speaking markets across North America.</p>
<p>‘Content Tailored for Hispanic-American Bettors’</p>
<p>The launch of the new website by Leadstar Media marks the seventh website operated by the Swedish-based lead generation and media firm in the US and is an extension of the company’s plan to expand its exposure to sports betting in Spanish.</p>
<p>Commenting on the news, Jacob Ljunggren, director of Operations at Leadstar Media, explained the reasoning behind the company’s decision to launch a dedicated website in Spanish to address the needs of Spanish-speaking populations in the US.</p>
<p>“After seeing a high percentage of users accessing our other Spanish-language platforms from the United States, we felt it was necessary to expand our product with a new website with content tailored for Hispanic-American bettors,” Ljunggren said.</p>
<p>The launch of the dedicated website will allow Spanish-speaking residents in the US to take advantage of the personalized guide offered by Leadstar Media while choosing the sportsbook operator that will suit them best.</p>
<p>“The US has been the talk of the industry lately and we have focused efforts there as well, Ljunggren continued, noting that the company decided to stop neglecting “a quite large portion of the population” and offer these people a product in Spanish.</p>
<p>Strengthening Presence in North America</p>
<p>Leadstar Media hosted their new website as a subdomain of the recognized by Spanish speakers website, MisCasasdeApuestas.com, a website that now has six subdomains to cover Spanish, Peruvian, Colombian, Mexican, Chilean, and American markets.</p>
<p>“I am very excited about this new launch and I believe that the strength of our already well-positioned domain will help this product perform faster than normal,” Ljunggren added, hoping that the new website will soon turn into a go-to place for American bettors seeking “relevant information in Spanish” and will rank among the top websites in the country.</p>
<p>The new website will attract Spanish-speaking adults who are looking to register with a regulated sportsbook, providing them with reviews of the best sports betting propositions on the market in terms of promotions, welcome bonuses and payment methods, as well as comparisons between different sports betting operators and general updates on the sports betting legalization process nationwide.</p>
<p>Leadstar Media recently announced it received a license as a registered vendor from the Maryland Lottery and Gaming Control Commission (MLGCC) and would be ready to commence operations alongside the official market launch in the coming months.</p>
