<p>This week Sportradar, the leading provider of sports data and information, announced their partnership with Major League Baseball /MLB/ expanded further through the launch of virtual baseball in-play for all licensed gaming operators around the world.</p>
<p>Meet Sportradar</p>
<p>Sportradar is the MLB real-time game statistics exclusive distributor, providing data for all international markets except the U.S. to companies from the media sector and the regulated sports betting industry, with the exclusive rights to distribute live standard audio-visual game feeds for any territory outside the U.S. where sports betting is legal.</p>
<p>Virtual Reality That Surpasses Expectations</p>
<p>Being the official supplier of MLB’s real-time betting data feed through the official MLB Statcast data allows Sportradar to utilize the development of technologies in virtual reality and present the baseball fans and sports bettors with an in-play betting solution that almost replicates a real game, as there are all 30 MLB teams, with official kits and player logos, the MLB brand and player avatars animated by state-of-the-art motion capture from professional athletes, to ensure a game of unraveled details and realism.</p>
<p>“As with all of our virtual sports offerings, our aim was to bring the most realistic look, feel, and betting experience to the market” David Lampitt, Managing Director, Sports Partnerships, Sportradar.</p>
<p>Besides giving fans the excitement of watching an almost real game of baseball, the in-play betting solution provides sportsbooks with an additional source of revenue, expanding on the sector of sports betting that has the highest growth in the past few years, in-play betting, offering them a unique product based on historical data that can be accessed any time throughout the year.</p>
<p>The Art of Entertainment</p>
<p>Established back in 2010, the Virtual Gaming Solutions of Sportradar are now utilized by more than 180 bookmakers worldwide, with a portfolio that includes basketball, soccer, tennis, horse, and dog racing, all of them using a combination of cutting-edge innovation with a comprehensive pool of sports and betting data to present a realistic virtual sports offering that is hardly distinguished from a real game.</p>
<p>“One of the reasons we partnered with Sportradar was to develop new, engaging products for our fans leveraging the power of MLB’s best-in-class content. This first-of-its-kind virtual offering does just that, and we are excited to bring fans this new entertainment option” Kenny Gersh, Executive Vice President, Gaming and New Business Ventures, MLB</p>
<p>In-play betting is not the only area of business Sportradar is engaged in the gaming industry, as the Swiss-based company, through its leading brand Betradar, provides full sportsbook solutions including pre-game betting, live sports streams, and betting entertainment.</p>
