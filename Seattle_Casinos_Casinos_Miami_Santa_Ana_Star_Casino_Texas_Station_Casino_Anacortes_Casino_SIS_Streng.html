    <h1>Seattle Casinos Casinos Miami Santa Ana Star Casino Texas Station Casino Anacortes Casino SIS Streng</h1>

<p>Sports Information Services, a B2B gambling content and production services provider, has strengthened its team by naming Julian Wheeler as its new chief technology officer. In his position, Wheeler will oversee the tech department as the company seeks expansion.</p>
<p>Wheeler Brings In Two Decades of Experience</p>
<p>Wheeler is an old-timer when it comes to working in tech-oriented positions. He boasts 21 years of experience in broadcasting and has worked in several notable companies. Wheeler has been the chief technology and product officer for Sky New Zealand for five years and has also held various other positions in the company. Prior to that, he has served as BT’s director of digital media, BskyB’s head of IT and Xplor’s chief product and technology officer.</p>
<p>In his new position, Wheeler will lead the development of Sports Information Services’ technology and will devise a single strategy for the company’s architecture, broadcast engineering, IT infrastructure, program management, service delivery, and software engineering teams. The appointee joins SIS in a crucial moment as the company continues seeking to expand its B2B business.</p>
<p>CEO Ames Is Convinced Wheeler Is What SIS Needs</p>
<p>Wheeler spoke on his new position, congratulating SIS on its recent expansions. He said that it has been “fascinating” to follow the company’s growth and that he is excited to help SIS in its efforts. Wheeler is delighted by the opportunity to work with the company’s team – a team that, he noted, has made great progress in extending the firm’s offerings. Wheeler added:</p>
<p>“SIS has made great strides in expanding internationally and my role is to lead the way in shaping a future-proofed technological strategy that can continue to meet the needs of our operator partners.” SIS CTO Julian Wheeler</p>
<p>The goal of this acquisition is to strengthen SIS’s team. The company hopes that Wheeler is exactly what its senior management team needs to keep advancing and enhancing the company’s offerings.</p>
<p>Richard Ames, the chief executive officer of SIS, welcomed the new chief technology officer to the company. Ames explained that Wheeler’s profound experience in broadcasting in large-scale organizations is what makes him suitable for the job. The CEO is glad by this choice and is thrilled to have Wheeler guide the company forward:</p>
<p>“He will lead our technical strategy as we continue to expand into new markets with a comprehensive range of products covering a breadth of verticals. His knowledge and expertise will have significant benefits for our business and will sharpen our technological capabilities.” Richard Ames, the chief executive officer of SIS</p>
<p>SIS continues its growth quest. In early February, the company added Argentina to its existing partnership with Codere Group.</p>
