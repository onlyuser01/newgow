<p>Jamul Casino Announces SDPC Series</p>
<p>Jamul Casino’s poker event is called San Diego Poker Classic (SDPC). Its inaugural edition will run until August 28 and will be an 11-day-long event. It will feature various challenges and will reward the best poker players with exciting prizes.</p>
<p>The SDPC Main Event will begin on August 23 and will run until the series finale. Poker enthusiasts can either pay $600 to join the tournament or try to qualify through the satellite tables. At the satellite tables, players can pay $85 for a 1/10 chance to qualify for the main event. Alternatively, they can pay $145 to double their chances. The Main Event will offer a $100,000 guarantee and will provide poker players with an exciting competition to take a part in.</p>
<p>In addition, there will be 14 trophy events Jamul Casino visitors can join. One of them will be a weekend opener featuring a $50,000 prize pool. The next week, on the other hand, will offer a women-only event for female poker enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Rochfort Wished Players the Best of Luck</p>
<p>Jamul Casino is owned and operated by the Jamul Indian Village. The SDPC is hosted in partnership with RunGood Events, a reputable local event organizer.</p>
<p>Through the new poker series, Jamul Casino hopes to cement itself as a premium gambling destination in San Diego. As per its plans, the property will turn the SDPC into a quarterly event and will host one every three months. After the ongoing August event, Jamul Casino plans to host a second event in November.</p>
<p>John Rochfort, poker manager at Jamul Casino, spoke about the new initiative. He said that Jamul Casino expects hundreds of players to sign in for the first edition of the San Diego Poker Classic.</p>
<p>“We’re expecting about 600 players for this first San Diego Poker Classic, and we’ll continue with a multi-day series every November, February, May and August.</p>
<p>Rochfort wished all participants the best of luck.</p>
<p>Although the SDPC is now ongoing, the Main Event is yet to begin. Poker enthusiasts who wish to take part in the inaugural San Diego Poker Classic event can register at Jamul Casino. The competition will take place at Jamul Casino’s Poker Room and Jive Lounge.</p>
