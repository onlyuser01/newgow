<p>GAMSTOP, a free self-exclusion program that works on the regulated gambling market in the United Kingdom, has announced that the total number of registrations has reached 341,365 people since it launched.</p>
<p>Even more importantly, the program reported a record number of registrations for 2022, with the numbers increasing by 6% on annual basis compared to 2021. The year saw 84,000 people registering in 2022, making it the highest number of registrations over a full-year period, and demonstrating the program’s effectiveness, the organization shared in a press release.</p>
<p>GAMSTOP has argued that the continued influx of new registrations is indicative of how efficient self-exclusion has become as a tool that empowers consumers to stay in control of their gambling habits and deal with a wide range of issues tied to gambling. GAMSTOP is a first step towards seeking further support, the program explained in an official press release.</p>
<p>One in four users observed over the past six months has chosen to exclude for a year at the very least. Another 48% of those registered chose to exclude over five years, which is the longest period that the program currently offers to people. GAMSTOP does not automatically end or cancel enrollment, with people still considered to be excluded unless they request their names to be taken down from the list.</p>
<p>GAMSTOP is a particular success as it covers vast demographics and makes sure that it helps those people to steer clear of gambling temptation. The planned overhaul of the country’s advertisement laws is also looking to better safeguard consumers and help prevent targeting of vulnerable groups, although the exact details are still subject to debate and not available to the public.</p>
<p>GAMSTOP in the meantime has been doing a good job of helping the country be a safer place for gamblers who are struggling to control their habits. The program launched in 2018, and it has been collecting annual data to better assess and tailor its product and offers.</p>
<p>GAMSTOP CEO Fiona Palmer was pleased with the results, but in a statement, she also cautioned that the current economic climate and affordability of living costs presented new challenges that influenced people’s decisions on their lifestyles and expenditures.</p>
<p>"In 2022 we saw more than 80,000 new registrations which is a positive step towards supporting even more people," Palmer noted. Not all is good news, she cautioned, as there are more people developing gambling problems. The important thing, GAMSTOP’s boss contended, was to ensure that more awareness is raised for the issue.</p>
<p>GAMSTOP successfully reached 2.6m people via Twitter and #TakeBackControl 2022. The program has also been a crucial part of the licensing process for UKGC-approved entities.</p>
