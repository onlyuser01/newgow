<p>Merlins Millions Superbet HQ review</p>
<p>Merlins Millions Superbet HQ is a video slot coming from the NextGen Gaming portfolio.</p>
<p>The slot has the potential for big payouts thanks to the attached Superbet option. Play on the top Superbet level and all Wild wins will come with a high x10 multiplier. Hit the right symbols on the reels and you can win up to 10,000 times the total stake in a single spin.</p>
<p>Theme and Visual Details</p>
<p>The game is inspired by Merlin, who was a world famous wizard from the time of King Arthur and Camelot.</p>
<p>The designers did a great job with the game theme. On the left side of the reels you will see a fun animation of Merlin showing off some of his magic. The slot has an attractive appearance thanks to these modern animations and the vibrant choice of colors.</p>
<p>Stacked wilds on middle reels offer a good chance for a big win</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>The gameplay in Merlins Millions Superbet HQ is quite fun as players can score big wins out of the blue. As in most other Superbet slots this is due to the extra features which this option brings. The excitement on the reels in this slot rises as the Wilds hit the screen, along with multipliers of up to x10.</p>
<p>Bet size RTP and payouts</p>
<p>Merlins Millions Superbet HQ is a 50 payline slot, so the bet size can range from $0.50 up to $125 per spin. This bet size is without the Superbet option active.</p>
<p>Merlins Millions Superbet full paytable</p>
<p>You can set the Superbet on 5 levels in total, which in return will increase your total stake by plus 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 times the basic bet. This means that the minimum bet size with the Superbet on the top fifth level will be $3.5 per spin, while the maximum will go up to $875 per spin.</p>
<p>Make no mistake; this is a high variance game with an RTP value of 95.63% which can pay big, but can also eat a lot of balance in return.</p>
<p>Bonus features</p>
<p>The Superbet option in the game will add a win multiplier to the Wild symbol. Depending whether the Superbet is set on level 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 the Wild symbol will have a win multiplier of x2, x4, x6, x8 or x10.</p>
<p>Explanation of the bonus rules</p>
<p>The Wild symbol in the game is Merlin himself and it can land on reels 2, 3 and 4 only. The best detail about the Wild is that it can land stacked on the reels, so you can easily get 3 Wild Reels in a single spin.</p>
<p>The slot also comes with two Scatter symbol. The first one is the Owl, landing on reels 1, 3 and 5, while the second is the Orb landing on reels 2, 3 and 4 only.</p>
<p>The Owl triggers the Owl Bonus Feature where players need to make picks from the Owl symbols on the reels and get cash prizes in return. The bonus ends when the Collect symbol is uncovered.</p>
<p>Collect cash winnings in the Owl bonus feature</p>
<p>The Orb symbol triggers the free spins bonus where the player is awarded with 5 free spins. More free spins can be won during the feature if another 3 Orbs land on the reels.</p>
<p>During the bonus round Merlin stands beside the reels and awards extra Wild symbols on the three central reels. This is when the player has the biggest chances of getting three Wild Reels on the screen and a guaranteed big payout, if playing on the top Superbet level.</p>
<p>Gameplay video featuring two of the bonuses - Owl bonus feature and free spins</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Merlins Millions Superbet HQ is an interesting and attractive NextGen Gaming slot which can pay big during base play and in the bonus round.</p>
<p>But in order to win big you will need to play on the top Superbet level, setting your minimum bet size at $3.5 per spin. Still this extra bet size is well worth the risk as it can yield the biggest payouts in return.</p>
<p>This means that you will need to risk a bigger balance in this game in order to maximize your chances of winning big. The rest is all up to Merlin.</p>
