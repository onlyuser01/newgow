<p>AC Milan needs to win on Sunday in order to stay at the top of the Italian Serie A. Right now, this team has 80 points, which is just two more than its archrival Inter. As there are only two more games left to be played until the end of the season, there’s no room for mistakes.</p>
<p>AC Milan players have the motivation to win but doing it won’t be easy. The reason is that they’re taking on a very tricky opponent this Sunday. The team in question is Atalanta, which is also in a need of points in order to get to a spot that leads to Europe.</p>
<p>Knowing all this, it’s clear that fans of Italian soccer are in for a real thriller on Sunday. If you’d like to bet on this game, make sure to read our AC Milan vs Atalanta preview first. We’re going to analyze the odds, discuss the latest news, and even share our top pick. So, let’s start!</p>

<p>AC Milan Needs to Keep on Winning</p>
<p>AC Milan is without a loss in Serie A since January. Thanks to their impressive run, these guys were able to get all the way to the top of the Serie A table. Unfortunately for them, it’s still not clear whether they’re going to be able to stay there until the end of the season.</p>
<p>The good news is that there are only two more games left for them to play. After the clash with Atalanta, they play Sassuolo on the road. The bad news is that their rival for the title – Inter Milan – has an even easier job in the remainder of the season.</p>
<p>That said, winning against Atalanta is of utmost importance for AC Milan. Anything other than a win would make things way more complicated for them.</p>
<p>Atalanta’s Been in a Goal-Scoring Mood</p>
<p>With 65 goals scored in 36 matches, Atalanta is the fourth-highest scoring team in the league. What’s even more impressive is that this team’s been scoring a lot of goals lately. In fact, Atalanta has put away at least one goal in each of its eight Serie A games. Further, in its most recent match, Atalanta beat Spezia 3-1 on the road.</p>
<p>Thanks to its impressive run, Atalanta now has a chance to book a spot in the Europa League next season. For that to happen, however, these guys need points. They’re now in the #8 position, with the same number of points as AS Roma – the team that’s sitting in the #6 spot.</p>
<p>To overtake that position, Atalanta needs to do well in the remainder of the season. As in the final round, this team is playing Empoli at home, Sunday’s clash with AC Milan is their crucial game.</p>
<p>AC Milan vs Atalanta Prediction</p>
<p>Five of their previous seven Serie A duels saw three or more goals. We expect something similar to happen in this game as well. Not only are both teams great in the offense, but both will be very motivated to win. In such games, anything can happen, but we feel as if AC Milan and Atalanta could draw on Sunday.</p>
<p>Pick: Draw, over 3.5 goals</p>
