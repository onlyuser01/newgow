<p>The sole recognized tribe in Alabama campaigns for the expansion of gambling while expanding its non-gambling contracting at the same time</p>
<p>The Poarch Band of Creek Indians, Alabama’s only recognized tribe, just launched a new pro-gambling campaign. The initiative seeks to gather support for the legalization of more gaming and lottery verticals under the slogan “Winning for Alabama.”</p>
<p>“It’s Time to Stop Leaving Money on the Table”</p>
<p>Currently, gaming in The Heart of Dixie is fairly restricted. While not all gambling is prohibited, the state only allows Class II gaming properties. This means that customers can freely enjoy bingo machines but are barred from wagering on sports or playing table games and traditional slots.</p>
<p>With the 2023 legislative session incoming, the Poarch Band seeks to gather support for a new bill. No actual measure has been introduced yet but the tribe hopes to secure strong backing from Alabamans in advance.</p>
<p>In a short new ad, people from all backgrounds talk about the potential benefits of introducing Class III casinos in Alabama. According to them, casino taxes, estimated at around $700 million a year, will greatly benefit the local economy. This money would then be used to fund infrastructure, internet infrastructure, education, healthcare and public safety projects. In addition, the casino expansion would create 12,000 new jobs.</p>
<p>A Major Deal with NASA</p>
<p>In the meantime, the Poarch Band of Creek Indians just secured a monumental $217 million non-gaming contract with NASA. As announced by the tribe, its PCI Productions subsidiary has been designated to manage scaled-up communications operations in NASA’s HQ and mission directorates. Furthermore, PCI Productions will assist NASA with public and interagency messaging.</p>
<p>The deal kicks in on June 1 and will see PCI support NASA for 16 months. The deal can be further extended by 20 months or two one-year periods.</p>
<p>Tim McElyea, CEO of PCI Productions, called the agreement a “culmination” of his company’s existing relationship with NASA. PCI Productions, known as Media Fusion prior to its acquisition by the tribe, has been working with NASA for decades.</p>
<p>In an interview with Tribal Business News, McElyea said:</p>
<p>For me personally, the contract award is the culmination of a life’s work. When this opportunity came up, it became that much bigger as a result of that growing relationship. Tim McElyea, CEO, PCI Productions</p>
<p>The agreement is notably the biggest contract PCI Productions has ever signed. It will augment the Poarch Band’s federal contracting, which is a major source of non-gaming revenue for the tribe.</p>
