    <h1>West Memphis Casino Las Vegas Casino Resorts Maria Casino Sonesta Maho Beach Resort Casino Spa Casin</h1>

<p>Hello</p>
<p>I start with the fact that I have played on many gaming sites and have not had any problems in this way, most casinos I have closed today to take a break or reduce my gambling, I played at two casinos called unlimitcasino.com and goldroll .com I am very happy with them, It went so well both with deposit and withdrawal, I won and then I wanted to pause my gaming account for a while, I got the urge to play when I found wishocasino and started by making deposit 1000, euros and the second time 1000 euros and the third time I made a deposit of 1000 euros to when they froze my gaming account for verification, then they wanted me to report my salary that I get in my bank account and three months of bank transactions, I sent the documents that they wanted, then they started pointing to some transactions and they wanted me to report and explain and I did, they wanted 12 months of transactions, then I told them it's the first time someone asks for 12 months of transactions, when they thought I refused to send 12 month transactions to my bank account, then they said we have sent your case to an extra check at their AML department, then they started that I have to contact all the casinos I have played in the last 12 months and that I ask for the documents on all my deposits and withdrawals that I have made, everything should be pdf,</p>
<p>I contacted those I remember and asked for the documents and I received the documents and forwarded to wishocasino.com documents I received it was not pdf and I justified all evidence that it the documents I could get, every time I submit documents that they want then they pray more and more.</p>
<p>now they want proof of four transactions that have come to my bank account from unlimitcasino for verification, unlimitcasino says we will help you with this but it can take up to 30 days</p>
<p>I have 987.58 euros in my gaming account</p>
<p>it is the first time I experience such a situation to demand so much all the time</p>
<p>it's been 22 days now</p>
<p>What do you recommend?</p>
<p>with kind regards Jonny</p>
