<p>Gary Loveman, CEO of Caesars Entertainment, is to step down from the post, the troubled company announced this week.</p>
<p>He will be succeeded by Mark Frissora, the former CEO of rental car company Hertz, who will join the board immediately and take over the reins officially on July 1.</p>
<p>Loveman will continue to serve as company chairman.</p>
<p>Under Loveman’s stewardship, Caesars Entertainment, originally Harrahs, grew into the biggest casino operator in the world.</p>
<p>However, it assumed huge industry-high debt of $20 billion following the $30.1 billion takeover by private equity firms Apollo Global Management and TPG Capital, and struggled during the subsequent global economic downturn.</p>
<p>The company has lost money every year since 2009 and remains locked in a legal squabble with a group of its lower-level creditors as it attempts to restructure and put its main operating unit through Chapter 11 bankruptcy.</p>
<p>“My decision to begin to transition management now comes with the confidence that we have taken the steps necessary to ensure the company’s long-term success,” Loveman said. “I am proud of the company’s many accomplishments and grateful for the loyalty and friendship of my thousands of colleagues.”</p>
<p>Caesars Builds an Empire</p>
<p>After completing his doctorate at MIT, Loveman spent nine years as a professor at Harvard Business School, before joining Harrahs as a consultant, and then as COO in 1998.</p>
<p>As COO, Loveman created the Harrahs loyalty rewards program which allowed the company to build data on its customers and discover that slots players, and not high-rollers, were the most profitable demographic.</p>
<p>In 2003, he became CEO, and the following year, oversaw the acquisition of Caesars Entertainment, expanding Harrahs from a company that owned 15 casino properties to one that owned over 50.</p>
<p>“Caesars has accomplished more than what we could have imagined when I arrived,” said Loveman, who added that “the time is ripe for a transition,” as the company is “in the midst of a formal restructuring of one of its subsidiaries.”</p>
<p>“My decision to begin to transition management now comes with the confidence that we have taken the steps necessary to ensure the company’s long-term success,” he added.</p>
<p>So Good It Hertz</p>
<p>His successor, meanwhile, has experience in presiding over heavily indebted companies.</p>
<p>He joined Hertz in 2006 just after it, like Caesars, had assumed billions in debt following a private takeover, and oversaw a subsequent period of global expansion.</p>
<p>However, while Frissora cited personal reasons for leaving Hertz, Bloomberg has reported that investors pushed for his removal, citing accounting and operational mistakes.</p>
<p>“Mark has a long history of driving growth, optimizing operations and creating shareholder value,” said Marc Rowan, a co-founder of Apollo, and David Bonderman, a co-founder of TPG. We are confident that his efforts combined with the restructuring … will help create long-term shareholder value at Caesars.”</p>
