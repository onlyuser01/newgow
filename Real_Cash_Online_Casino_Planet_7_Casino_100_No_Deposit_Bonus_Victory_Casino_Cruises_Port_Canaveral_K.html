    <h1>Real Cash Online Casino Planet 7 Casino 100 No Deposit Bonus Victory Casino Cruises Port Canaveral K</h1>

<p>I understand their point but that only entitles them to void the winnings from the September deposit. If they thought it was an issue then they should have closed the account then. That term (10.4) does not say anything about voiding future winnings from future deposits in my name. That’s where it’s so unfair. They an obligation to act fairly and in good faith under Ontario law.</p>
<p>their terms (especially section 17) are so broad they literally entitle them to close your account and confiscate your balance for no reason at all. That’s egregious. This situation feels egregious. They took my deposits after September and let me lose but won’t pay out after a win. They had an obligation to flag this as an issue at the time of the deposit not now and in any event that doesn’t serve pursuant to their terms to give them the right to confiscate winnings from this recent deposit. Their email doesn’t say anything about the winnings or why they’re confiscating them which I find very telling in that they know they’re doing something fishy.</p>
