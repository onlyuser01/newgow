<p>Bus drivers and mechanics had threatened to go out on strike if they didn’t get an acceptable offer.</p>
<p>Super Bowl Impact Averted</p>
<p>That could have caused chaos for many of the 330K expected visitors for the Super Bowl game and the days leading up to the iconic event.</p>
<p>Public buses are among the only options for tourists and local residents to move in and around Las Vegas.</p>
<p>A particular concern for the Super Bowl was that authorities are not planning to let taxi cabs, as well as Uber or Lyft vehicles, to drive near Allegiant Stadium, according to union members.</p>
<p>Employees at many Las Vegas hotels, casinos, and restaurants also rely on public buses to get to and from work.</p>
<p>But following recent negotiations, drivers and mechanics agreed to the tentative contract, officials announced on Saturday.</p>
<p>Transdev, which operates the public bus service for the Regional Transportation Commission (RTC) of Southern Nevada, and the Amalgamated Transit Union (ATU) Local 1637, have been negotiating for months to reach an agreement.</p>
<p>The deal still needs the approval of some 1,200 rank and file union members. A prior offer was turned down by workers in January.</p>
<p>Details on the new contract weren’t released to the public.</p>
<p>There was relief the new agreement was reached before Super Bowl week.</p>
<p>We thank the members of the ATU for their service to the community and are pleased to shift focus on moving passengers safely and reliably throughout Las Vegas — including this coming week as all eyes are on us with the upcoming Super Bowl,” Ron Bushman, Transdev’s regional vice president, said in a statement.</p>
<p>Worker Safety</p>
<p>Beyond salary levels, bus drivers have been concerned about worker safety. Seventeen acts of violence took place on RTC buses between March and September of 2023.</p>
<p>Drivers have been spit on, punched, and assaulted, and have seen other violent incidents on the bus service, according to the union.</p>
<p>Kickoff for the Super Bowl is at 3:30 p.m. PT. The game will feature the Kansas City Chiefs vs. the San Francisco 49ers, and Usher will be the halftime performer.</p>
<p>The Culinary Union has threatened to go out on strike on Monday if settlements aren’t reached between three remaining Las Vegas properties and hospitality workers.</p>
