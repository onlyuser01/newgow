    <h1>Foxwoods Resort And Casino Little Creek Resort Casino Okada Manila Casino Peppermill Resort Spa Casi</h1>

<p>I made series of deposits and won series of bets. On withdrawal, they asked for my verification, I sent and they verified he. Then they asked for selfie with newspaper and ID, I sent it and they verified it..</p>
<p>Next I wanted to withdraw and they said I must roll over my balance to the double amount of my bonuses before I can withdraw..</p>
<p>"" To apply for payment, you need to make a turnover at the rates, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the bonuses used.""</p>
<p>I mean, that's ridiculous. A desperate approach to scam me..</p>
<p>They actually gave me the rollover conditions for bonus winnings on my real money, when I NEVER USED any of their bonuses and or, their promotions..</p>
<p>Yes, I never had ANY BONUS nor participated in ANY PROMOTION..</p>
