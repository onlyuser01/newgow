<p>Let me deposit $800 but wouldn’t give me welcome bonus. Told me I won free spins but also wouldn’t let me redeem them. When I questioned them they told me my account was closed and To context support. Support very rudely told me I have duplicate accounts (I don’t) and that my money is confiscated. They asked for ID before they let me deposit anything so they knew if I had a second account yet took 4 deposits off me. They said they didn’t know I had 2 accounts til after my deposits, despite having my ID &amp; approving it before I deposited. In the same email they explained I don’t get a bonus because of duplicate accounts.. therefor if I did have 2, it shows they knew from the start. I wonder if these dodgy websites are linked to others with different names &amp; that’s how they use this rubbish ‘duplicate account’ excuse to steal from players. I had this issue with another casino using different names under the one base casino.. but they told me they could close all others &amp; I could keep the current one with no punishment of stealing from me and closing my account for duplicates. I believe they were ‘Emu Casino’. They may not exist anymore.</p>
<p>Playamo are thieves. Do not play unless you have never gambled online before. If you have an account with one of their other casinos under a different name.. they will take every bit of money you put in until you either ask a question when things don’t make sense, or if you try to cash out. And even if they pay you, their layout is outdated &amp; slow, the games are old, &amp; a large portion of games don’t work at all.</p>
