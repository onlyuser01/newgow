<p>The New England Patriots’ odds of winning the Super Bowl lengthened slightly this week after Patriots head coach Bill Belichick decided to release veteran quarterback Cam Newton. BetOnline has changed the team’s outright chances of winning the Super Bowl at (+2500), although other sportsbooks, such as FanDuel, have been far more conservative placing New England at (+3700) or roughly the middle of the pecking order.</p>
<p>The perceptible change in the team’s odds reflects the Patriots’ own determination to rely on Newton as their ace this season. However, coach Belichick will now depend on rookie Mac Jones instead. Jones is not their first pick either, and yet he will be placed in one of the most responsible positions that can very well determine the fortunes of the team for the entire season.</p>
<p>2022 NFL Super Bowl Odds (Patriots)</p>
<p>Team Odds Kansas City Chiefs +525 Tampa Bay Buccaneers +600 Buffalo Bills +1100 Green Bay Packers +1100 Baltimore Ravens +1400 Cleveland Browns +1400 Los Angeles Rams +1600 San Francisco 49ers +1600 New England Patriots +2500 *Odds at BetOnline as of September 1, 2021</p>
<p>The Rookie Becomes the Favorite</p>
<p>In explaining his motivation coach Belichick said that the silent rookie has proven to be capable of outperforming Newton and managed to do 36-of-52 for 389 yards and threw one touchdown, with 107 snaps to his record so far in the preseason. Essentially, Jones has outperformed other QBs on the current New England Patriots’ roster.</p>
<p>In comparison, Newton only had 39 snaps in the preseason and played 14 out of 21 for 162 yards. Newton’s release was not motivated just by poor performance on the field. It seemed like the veteran was already not truly into playing competitively, as he had to skip five days of practice for violating COVID-19 protocols.</p>
<p>What’s Next for the Patriots with a Fresh Rookie?</p>
<p>Jones obviously isn’t a superstar but he shows promising qualities. His overall performance isn’t too shabby and with the right team set-up, he may discover that he is capable of pulling off feats that far beat his own expectations. Actually, not much has changed in terms of odds alignment for the Patriots. Let’s have a look.</p>
<p>Market Odds To win the AFC East +325 To win the AFC Championship +1200 To win the Super Bowl +2500 To make the Playoffs -105 *Odds at VegasOdds as of September 1, 2021</p>
<p>History is not on the side of the Patriots ‘quarterbacks with their last attempts proving a little misfortunate. New England have a proven track record, but they seem to have lacked the opportunity to successfully train new key players, especially on short notice.</p>
<p>Regardless of the abrupt Newton departure, it seems like oddsmakers remain fairly confident in the division and Super Bowl chances of the Patriots. They will have to go a long way to prove them, but so far, they managed to pull off two sterling wins and they are in a position to keep building upon that.</p>
