    <h1>L Auberge Casino Resort Lake Charles Hollywood Casino Morgantown Casino Ruidoso Are There Casinos In</h1>

<p>Oggi ho ricevuto una nuova email dal casino . Per tutelare la mia salute mi chiudono il conto . Ma perchè non hanno tutelato la mia salute quando versavo soldi ma solo ora che voglio prelevarli ? Strano ...</p>
<p>Dear Lucio</p>
<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>Following our internal review, we outline below our key findings that you have evidently and materially breach our Terms and Conditions, on which you are bound by the time of the establishment of your account.</p>
<p>Firstly and most importantly sections 5 and 10 of the Terms and Conditions have been violated as your account has been flagged since it was associated, due to IP address duplication, with another account that has been suspended and then closed, for self-exclusion on December 2023 due to gambling addiction.</p>
<p>Although we are not able to verify whether you are the beneficiary of both referred accounts, the duplication of the IP address raised suspicions and therefore triggered the compliance check. We would like to emphasize that in accordance with our Terms &amp; Conditions, we do have the right to close any duplicate account.</p>
<p>Based your activity you have been chasing loses and you were not gambling what you could afford to lose as you have used 4 different credit cards, for which, during our investigation, we have received numerous emails from you giving us deadlines when to respond as you have to pay back the money to the relevant Credit Institutions. We empathize with this, and we strongly recommend that you should consider some time off, seek support systems, financial counselling and a lifestyle change.</p>
<p>On a separate note, you have claimed the following "If I had excluded myself in other casinos (I don't remember if I made this in past) this was for avoid to play other money in some casinos that not give me affordability and not for other." To clarify, by stating "self-exclusion" we were only referring to our casino, as we do not have access to other casinos, but it’s worth mentioning that self-exclusion and safer gambling initiatives are in place from our casino to protect players and not providing the players with any tool to abuse them and gain affordability as you mentioned above.</p>
<p>In addition, sections 13 (Your Location) and 14 (Prohibited Jurisdictions – Game provider restricted countries) have been breached as throughout your activity you have been playing games that are restricted to your country of residence. We can provide you more details, but we strongly believe you are already aware of that.</p>
<p>Furthermore, section 18 (Bonuses) has been breached on three occasions. Firstly, two counts of deposits were made while having an active bonus, the reasoning of such action cannot be verified, but several big returns were made, as you rightly mentioned and remember that all these bonuses accrued have been lost. Secondly, while having a pending withdrawal of 1000 Euros which we wrongfully paid out, you have claimed a deposit bonus. Please be advised that in accordance with section 18 we have the legal right to remove any Bonus and Winnings that have been obtained by fraud if we suspect that a Bonus offer has been misused; This includes instances such as a) Deposit patterns including amounts that manipulate the bonus system, and b) activating a deposit bonus while you still have available monies or a pending withdrawal". Thirdly, as mentioned above your account has been flagged as Duplicate, and as such the following legal reservations apply "Any Bonus offered to one customer account shall be applicable only once, provided that the Bonus and the Terms and Conditions do not provide for otherwise. Any Bonus from us is valid only once per customer account, computer household, IP address, and other places with a shared computer (office, library, university, etc.)"</p>
<p>Lastly, and having been provided with all necessary evidence justifying that all 4 credit cards used belong to you, your account will remain suspended and we will not tolerate the receipt of any further abusive emails as this also materially breaches our Terms and Conditions. Provided that your account is associated with an account that has been self-excluded due to gambling addiction, we will calculate the Net Deposits made (minus expenses) including the one Withdrawal made of 1000 Euros and our support team will contact you, in the event there are outstanding refunds to be made. Please note, for your information, that the total deposits made were equal to 1306 Euros.</p>
<p>Therefore, and taking into consideration that our Terms and Conditions have been breached on numerous counts, we are able to conclude that your account has been rightfully suspended and soon will be closed.</p>
<p>We hereby reserve all our respective legal and other rights, deriving from the matters set forth herein as well as in all previous correspondence.</p>
<p>Best Regards</p>
