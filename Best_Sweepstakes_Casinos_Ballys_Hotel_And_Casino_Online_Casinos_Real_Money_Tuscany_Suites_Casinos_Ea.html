<p>The provider of content, technology, services and hardware for gaming, betting, lottery and leisure operators within the regulated online and retail gambling vertical, Inspired Entertainment, announced it extended its partnership with the popular bookmaker in the UK and Ireland, Paddy Power. Details about the extended contract emerged Monday and see the bookmaker continue to leverage Inspired's Virtual Sports products.</p>
<p>Thanks to the long-term deal, Paddy Power will continue to benefit from the leading products provided by Inspired. This will help power the bookmaker's entire retail operations in the UK, as well as Ireland. Currently, Paddy Power, which is a brand owned by the global sports betting, entertainment and gaming provider, Flutter Entertainment, operates more than 600 betting shops around Ireland and the UK.</p>
<p>Vince Bateson, Paddy Power's Head of Retail Gaming, shared his excitement about the recently extended contract in a statement released on May 22, 2023. He said: "We are pleased to extend our relationship with Inspired for Virtual Sports products in all our retail betting shops in the UK and Ireland." Last but not least, Bateson added: "Our customers enjoy Virtual products and our ongoing partnership with the Inspired team ensures we continue to provide the best possible experience in our retail shops."</p>
<p>Brooks Pierce, Inspired's President and Chief Executive Officer, was similarly delighted about the collaboration with Paddy Power. "We are thrilled to extend our partnership with Paddy Power in supporting their retail venues across the UK and Ireland, as we have done for the past 12 years," he added. Finally, Pierce noted: "We will continue to provide Paddy Power with our latest products and technology giving them the advantage of our leading content for their Virtual Sports offerings."</p>
<p>Details about the extended collaboration came after late last month, Inspired joined forces with FanDuel. As a result, the leading provider of games and solutions agreed to deliver its iGaming content, boosting the operator's presence in Michigan, USA.</p>
<p>Considering the size of the market, making it an important jurisdiction for the country, the deal represented an important milestone for Inspired. At the time of the announcement, Pierce noted: "We are thrilled to partner with FanDuel in Michigan to deliver premium iGaming content."</p>
<p>Before that, earlier in April, Inspired expanded its portfolio of content by announcing the launch of The Terminator slot, a new game inspired by the globally-recognized sci-fi franchise The Terminator. The new 5x4 grid slot offers 20 paylines and engaging features that can bring big prizes for the players.</p>
