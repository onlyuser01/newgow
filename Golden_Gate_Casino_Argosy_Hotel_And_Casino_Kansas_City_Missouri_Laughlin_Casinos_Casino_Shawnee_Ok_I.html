<p>The new agreement will also cement Genius Sports as FIBA’s official data &amp; video capture and production partner, as well as its official innovation &amp; technology partner</p>
<p>The International Basketball Federation (FIBA) has agreed to expand its long-term partnership with sports data and tech specialist Genius Sports. Under the extended agreement, the latter party will leverage its unparalleled computer vision technology and AI-powered capabilities to enhance basketball leagues across the globe.</p>
<p>Under the new agreement, Genius Sports will continue to work with the FIBA for another 10 years, with the new term set to expire in 2035.</p>
<p>By supplying the basketball sector with new technology, Genius Sports will transform its entire data and video ecosystem. The sports technology specialist will provide a unified, connected solution to automate and synchronize the collection of live game statistics and video production with advanced player tracking, the announcement says.</p>
<p>To that end, Genius Sports will leverage its optical system that has been trained in the reading and understanding of live game plays. Its capabilities allow it to predict outcomes in real time, providing bettors with important insights.</p>
<p>This will mark the first time FIBA Leagues and National Federations have had access to an AI-powered automated player tracking system. Thanks to this, users will be able to access many cutting-edge coaching tools and analytics, automated officiating and broadcast augmentation tools.</p>
<p>Genius Sports Is Looking Forward to Enhancing Basketball Leagues</p>
<p>The new agreement will also cement Genius Sports as FIBA’s official data &amp; video capture and production partner. The sports data specialist will also serve as the association’s official innovation &amp; technology partner from 2025 onward.</p>
<p>Andreas Zagklis, FIBA’s secretary general, commented on the new deal, praising the almost 20-year partnership between the two bodies. He said that Genius Sports’ automated solution will assist National Federations and Leagues, helping them bolster revenue and reduce costs.</p>
<p>We’re delighted to expand our partnership with Genius Sports to achieve this goal and equip the FIBA Family with first access to this cutting-edge technology in basketball. Andreas Zagklis, secretary general, FIBA</p>
<p>Mark Locke, Genius Sports’ chief executive officer, was likewise pleased to expand this “landmark partnership” with FIBA. He said that his team is looking forward to transforming international basketball through Genius Sports’ technology.</p>
<p>Powered by our unique AI-driven system, Leagues and National Federations at all levels of basketball will be able to automate data and video collection and utilize the highest quality player and team tracking data. Mark Locke, CEO, Genius Sports</p>
<p>Genius and FIBA first teamed up in 2004. Since then, the two parties have provided 200 Leagues and National Federations worldwide with both FIBA LiveStats and FIBA Organizer.</p>
<p>A month ago, Genius Sports integrated its new BetVision solution into FanDuel.</p>
