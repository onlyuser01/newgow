    <h1>Suncoast Casino Las Vegas Joliet Casino Online Casino Free Casino Yonkers Airway Heights Casino BetC</h1>

<p>This is just a heads up for any gamblers experiencing long withdraw delays I have been a casino player nearly my whole life and some.... I would actually say 40% of casinos including some reputable casinos practice shady unfair tactics at all levels but all aimed towards saving the casino money one such tactic is the constant issue with withdrawal delays you'll never be told what the actual issue is because there is no issue they are not delayed and could get you your winnings in an acceptable time frame however the casinos don't really want to give you your winnings but law says they must so what they do is purposely draw out the withdrawal process as long as possible because the longer they take to pay you the more likely it becomes that customers get fed up waiting and dip back into their winnings to play some more because while you're waiting 2 weeks to a month to get paid you are unable to play at the casino so the longer they can make you wait the higher the odds are you will just begin playing again with the winnings only now that you've won something specily if you've won 10k + your account gets shut down and by shut down I mean your account still works like normal only your odds of winning has all but been reduced to nothing so they can try to reclaim their losses betway is one site that does this I won 10k from betway it took more than a month to be paid and the next time I played at betway I couldn't win anything I could go through 100 dollars never hitting any win the entire $100 that was worth more than the cost of the spins so if I was betting $1 out of a total $100 not a single win was worth more than $1 and would go through 30 spins without a single win on a regular basis and on top of this betway also has a daily free spin reward that resets every 24 hours and everyone who's deposited gets 1 spin every day on this wheel there are free spins $1 free bet $1 casino bonus and 1 spot on the wheel of course is no reward and before I won the 10k I would log on every single day without fail to collect my free spin and 80% of the time I would get a reward and 20% would land on no reward but it wasn't often so it was a daily ritual I enjoyed doing well after I won that 10k and came back the first time back after the win I blast through 300 dollars with hardly a win and then of course my free daily spin lands on no reward..... Ok fine it happens but I'm still coming everyday to collect my free spin then I start to notice the next day no reward again the next day no reward again and again and again and again it is now 2 years later and to this day if I log on to betway and use my free spin it is garaunteed to land on no reward every single time. Which itself is super shady and likely illegal but it in my opinion is proof that these online casinos with no morals are without a doubt capable of effecting the payout rates and amounts and they are able to reduce how often bonus rounds are awarded and the amounts they pay out not all casinos do this but plenty do so be aware don't fall into one of these casinos which this coco casino is sending red flags in my opinion they are deploying unfair and likely illegal tactics to maximize profits. The simple fact casinos use RNG random number generating machines the very same types of RNG that all the app video games use where you pay an amount to open a chest that has an extremely low chance at getting the 1 great item and extremely high chance of paying for useless junk and those app developers would change the drop rates for the good item constantly you could even pay for it extra for an increase in the odds of getting a drop.</p>
<p>Anyways just my experience dealing with casinos the last 35+ years and that doesn't mean there are no good honest casinos there are just that there are less honest ones too and to be alert and watch for red flags like the majority of complaints coming to a casino about lengthy withdrawal delays if something doesn't feel right just ask yourself could the casino be benefiting from whatever the issue you're having is</p>
