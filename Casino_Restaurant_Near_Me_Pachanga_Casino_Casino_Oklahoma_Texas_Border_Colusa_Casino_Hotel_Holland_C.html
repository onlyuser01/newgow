    <h1>Casino Restaurant Near Me Pachanga Casino Casino Oklahoma Texas Border Colusa Casino Hotel Holland C</h1>

<p>I have been a member at Casinomax for many years along with their sister sites cherry jackpot and spinfinity. The issue I just recently had especially with Casinomax is since the flash player has been discontinued most players play on a mobile. I don't care for that so I still use my PC even though I can't access all the games. I play at a few RTG based platform Casinos but I have noticed that Casinomax and their sister sites have different update software. For some odd reason every time I play at Casinomax there is a glitch in the new software that max's out my bet so I get disqualified which causes their Max Bet Breach. In January 2020 this happened and my total winnings were $800 ( I don''t remember exactly). They felt bad for me so they gave me 1/2 of my winnings in good faith. $400</p>
<p>During one of the games I noticed the bet box said $25.00. The max bet with any match bonus is $10. I know the rules here, I have been playing for many years and this glitch of max bet hasn't even happened until they updated their software. This bet glitch happens all the time even when I play. I am well aware on my bet limit and my actions. On 04/16/2021 last Friday. I took a match bonus and made a deposit. I started playing at 1:30 pm USA time and the slots were loose and paying back like crazy. I was so happy I was having a great afternoon of gambling. I had a large play thru to finish...somewhere in the area of 22000. After many hours of playing BAM! there it was again $25.00 bet. WOW I didn't hit that max bet button... I new this will cause a loss again but i decided to finish my game play. After finishing my play thru I had $5600.00 left over in my account. I made a withdrawal for $4,000.00 wire transfer and $1,600.00 check. I figured they would work with me like that did before especially based on this amount of money...Believe me I really needed this money. I have been depositing and depositing for a very very long time with all losses. Finally I won! But Monday morning i received 2 emails</p>
<p>MAX BET BREACH...again but this time they were not willing to work with me at all.... BANKING DEPARTMENTS FINAL DECISION . SORRY CASINO RULES. Thomas, Jodie, Mark All these customer relations persons know about the glitch I have been having...and when it came down to the amount of $5,600.00.. Sorry you cannot withdraw.</p>
<p>Like I said they have an updated RTG platform that has a glitch. This has happened every time I play at these casino. It does not happen at any other RTG platform casinos. Maybe they can max out my bets!</p>
<p>Player Beware</p>
