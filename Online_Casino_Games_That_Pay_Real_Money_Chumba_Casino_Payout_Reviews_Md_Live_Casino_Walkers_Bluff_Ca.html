<p>New data by GeoComply has focused on identifying how many consumers had attempted to place a wager illegally on licensed operators in Canada during Sunday’s Super Bowl game</p>
<p>There were around 9,000 blocked attempts. The data covered the Ontario market, where online and retail sports betting gambling have been legal.</p>
<p>The province already has more than 40 operators that offer regulated betting products. GeoComply SVP of government &amp; public affairs John Pappas spoke to Mark Keats from CDC Gaming Reports and confirmed the number, arguing that the company, which specializes in geolocation services, had been able to block 9,000 attempts to access gambling operators in Ontario from unauthorized parties.</p>
<p>In most cases, people try to use a Virtual Private Network or VPN to circumnavigate restrictions and access licensed entities in the province. Part of this is owing to the fact that even when sports gambling was not regulated, there were no significant attempts in the province geared towards restricting the offshore market or ensuring that a legal gambling age restriction is observed. However, things have changed with the Alcohol and Gaming Commissions of Ontario now keen to keep the industry clean.</p>
<p>Blocking Suspicious Transactions Is GeoComly’s Stomping Ground</p>
<p>“As part of the regulatory mandate, GeoComply is constantly combatting attempts from around the globe to access our customers’ platforms in Ontario,” Pappas explained. He also argued that it was normal to expect a surge of such illegal betting activity around the time of major events. The illegal activity here had mostly to do with customers based in the United States trying to place a wager with a provincial operator in Ontario.</p>
<p>This surge in activity was based on the fact that the legal gambling age in the United States is 21 whereas in Ontario is only 19, Pappas added. However, the GeoComply representative argued that ensuring compliance with existing gambling laws and blocking unauthorized access was of the utmost importance to the company and its partners.</p>
<p>He used this example to highlight why having robust geolocation compliance in all regulated markets was crucial. GeoComply has been able to also block people from betting while outside the province, which is one of the regulatory prerequisites people must comply with.</p>
<p>Owning an account in Ontario is allowed even if you live outside the province, but in order to put a bet – online or in-person – you must be located inside Ontario. Pappas assured that GeoComply is aware of and able to step in cases where consumers were trying to breach the rules of the industry.</p>
