<p>MF &amp; DAZN: X Series 10 – The Prime Card brings us a lot of exciting boxing bouts on Saturday, October 14. One of those is the co-main event, Logan Paul vs. Dillon Danis, which we’ll now preview in detail.</p>
<p>Logan Paul and Dillon Danis hate each other’s guts, and this isn’t for the sake of views. The Youtuber wants to destroy Conor McGregor’s training partner as he’s been offending his fiancé online over the last couple of months. But can he do it?</p>
<p>Well, Logan Paul is much bigger than Dillon Danis, not to mention that he actually has some experience with boxing. “El Jefe” on the other hand, does have MMA experience but the Paul vs. Danis bout on October 14 will mark his boxing debut.</p>

<p>Logan Paul to Show Anger Can Be Power</p>
<p>Logan Paul is the less successful Paul Brother when it comes to boxing. He’s fought only one professional bout so far. It happened back in 2019 when we saw him lose to KSI by a split decision. The two also fought an amateur bout a year earlier, which finished in a majority draw.</p>
<p>On top of that, Paul has also fought one exhibition bout in 2021 against Floyd Mayweather Jr., which wasn’t scored by anyone. Obviously, “Money” would’ve destroyed him if it were a real fight.</p>
<p>But all this doesn’t mean Paul isn’t a good boxer. Or should we say “good enough” to beat Danis? He’s been working hard to polish his striking skills both with his brother Jake and with a team of professional trainers.</p>

<p>Logan might not be too technical, but there’s no arguing that he’s got power. He’s 6’2, weighing 205lb, and has a very low body fat percentage. Danis is two inches shorter, weighing at least 20lb fewer. And this guy does not look ripped. At least not as Logan.</p>
<p>Another thing going in favor of the Youtuber is that he’s super motivated to win. The thing is that he’s got a beef with Danis who’s been trying to humiliate his fiancé by positing some provocative pics of her on the internet.</p>
<p>Will Dillon Danis’ Mind Games Work?</p>
<p>Dillon Danis first got in the spotlight after getting attacked by Khabib Nurmagomedov after the fight with Conor McGregor. Danis was a part of McGregor’s team and was apparently offending the Dagestani fighter.</p>
<p>Playing mind games seems to be his tactic, as evident from the fact that he’s been calling out Logan and his girlfriend Nina Agdal in the build-up to MF &amp; DAZN: X Series 10 – The Prime Card. He’s done it to unsettle Paul, but will it help him in the ring or will it spectacularly backfire?</p>
<p>The thing is that Danis isn’t a boxer. He’s got experience with MMA, but his expertise isn’t striking. Instead, he’s a great grappler with a black belt in Brazilian jiu-jitsu, which will not come in handy on October 14.</p>
<p>Logan Paul vs. Dillon Danis Prediction</p>
<p>The headliner bout of MF &amp; DAZN: X Series 10 – The Prime Card is KSI vs Tommy Fury, which we’ve already analyzed in a separate piece. However, Logan Paul vs. Dillon Danis might be even more interesting than the main event.</p>
<p>The thing is that KSI and Fury don’t really have much of a beef going on. It’s just the opposite when it comes to Logan Paul and Dillon Danis. It’s personal for the Youtuber who’s coming to the ring to destroy his enemy. Will he pull it off? You betcha!</p>
<p>Pick: Logan Paul to win by KO/TKO</p>
