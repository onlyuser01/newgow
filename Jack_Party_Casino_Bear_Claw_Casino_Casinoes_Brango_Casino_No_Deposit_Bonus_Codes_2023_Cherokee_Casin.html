    <h1>Jack Party Casino Bear Claw Casino Casinoes Brango Casino No Deposit Bonus Codes 2023 Cherokee Casin</h1>

<p>Hi Betty,</p>
<p>At Drake, we do not have a bonus balance that is separate from your cash balance like many casinos have. For this reason many of our Free Spin Promos are offered as "Play now, Deposit Later" promotions. What this means is that you can play your spins first and then if you are satisfied with the amount that you have won, you can deposit to claim your winnings. That is why when you finished playing, you were instructed to go to the cashier. The winnings are in pending status for at least 1 week after you played the spins. This is meant to give you enough time to decide if you want to deposit for the winnings.</p>
<p>This is communicate as clearly as possible when you accept the promo (see attached photo).</p>
<p>On Mobile, if you want to see your redeemable winnings, this can be seen by clicking on "Balances," on desktop, go to, Cashier --&gt; Balances/Points/Promos --&gt; look under "My Available Promotions."</p>
<p>This may or may not still be available to you depending on when exactly you accepted the Free Spins because these are usually available for one week after completing the Free Spins.</p>
<p>If you need anything else. Please let us know or reach out support@drakecasino.eu.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Kyle</p>
