<p>Scientific Games has announced a multi-year agreement with the Warner Bros. brands for digital and retail lottery game content</p>
<p>The leading supplier of lottery products, technology, and services to worldwide lottery programs backed by governments, Scientific Games, has announced an exclusive, multi-year expansion of its licensing agreement for lottery games with the renowned Warner Bros. Discovery Global Themed Entertainment.</p>
<p>A week ago, Light &amp; Wonder announced a similar extension of its partnership for online games with Warner Bros Discovery, starting with the digital version of the iconic Willy Wonka: World of Wonka.</p>
<p>According to the terms of the deal between Scientific Games and Warner Bros., the provider will introduce the premium global entertainment and media company’s well-known IPs to its retail and digital lottery games. This includes the much-anticipated GAME OF THRONES brand that is now available in retail and digital lottery games for the first time in history.</p>
<p>Limited Global Rights on Iconic TV and Motion Picture Brands</p>
<p>The partnership includes “limited worldwide rights” on a number of well-known TV and motion brands such as FRIENDS, THE WIZARD OF OZ, ELF, CADDYSHACK, WILLY WONKA &amp; THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY, and NATIONAL LAMPOON’S VACATION.</p>
<p>Scientific Games’ vice president of North American Instant Products, Kyle Rogers, expressed their thrill to provide digital and retail games for the “legendary” Warner Bros. Discovery movie and TV brands while also speaking about the buzzing announcement regarding GAME OF THRONES.</p>
<p>Rogers also praised the “highly successful partnership” between the two parties over the past years while mentioning the expanded collaboration will include the most popular film, TV, and streaming brands available to global lottery players right now.</p>
<p>In fiscal year 2022, Scientific Games’ licensed branded titles created for American lotteries stood for $2.7 billion in retail sales. The success of the products is ensured by the complex consumer research methodology applied by the company to access brands via Power Index. The latter is used to determine the intensity of “liking” connected to a brand.</p>
<p>Accordingly, Scientific Games produces science-based solutions and games that effectively generate maximum proceeds for lottery programs.</p>
<p>A Strong 2009-Based Partnership Still Going</p>
<p>The partnership between Scientific Games and Warner Bros. Discovery Global Themed Entertainment began almost one and a half decades ago, in 2009, when the provider launched its first licensed branded THE WIZARD OF OZ for the Kansas state lottery.</p>
<p>So far, as many as 16 global lotteries have launched THE WIZARD OF OZ games, with options like digital, FastPlay, and instant on the list.</p>
<p>In the past years, the WILLY WONKA GOLDEN TICKET instant scratch game reached the $1 billion mark in terms of retail sales while generating around $300 million in returns to all 18 participating states, in the form of general funds and beneficiary programs. The latter includes a series of safety, education, environment, and elderly care programs.</p>
<p>The pioneer WILLY WONKA GOLDEN TICKET linked instant game that features a prize that can reach up to $1 billion also offered the largest prize in history. The company that pushes game designs to the next level and specializes in iLottery, instant games, and data analytics also pioneered Linked Games winners’ events in 2007.</p>
<p>Ever since, Scientific Games generated over 30 important events for the lottery industry while creating the largest portfolio of licensed brands in the industry with over 100 properties for digital and retail games. In March, the company announced the debut of its new instant games printing technology that would ensure growth for its instant scratch games.</p>
<p>Warner Bros. Discovery’s properties represent some of the most iconic brands that enhance lottery games at a global level.</p>
<p>In June, Scientific Games chose Christine Wechsler as its new senior vice president of public policy and government</p>
