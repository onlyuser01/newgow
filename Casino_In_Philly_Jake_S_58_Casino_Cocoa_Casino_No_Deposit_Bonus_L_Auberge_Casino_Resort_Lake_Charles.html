<p>A deranged man was eventually apprehended Sunday evening by Las Vegas Metro, hours after he refused to leave an apartment near downtown Las Vegas. Earlier, he had allegedly stabbed a woman in the face in the area of the Boulevard Inn, Metro police said.</p>

<p>Officers went to the complex, located on Las Vegas Boulevard North, at about 4 pm. They found the wounded victim in a parking lot, KVVU, a local TV station, reported.</p>
<p>Her injuries were not believed to be life-threatening, according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal. But she is believed to have received medical treatment.</p>
<p>She told Metro police the man who knifed her was in a nearby room. Police officers went to talk to the suspect. He refused to cooperate and would not surrender to authorities, the Review-Journal said.</p>
<p>Police eventually convinced the man to give himself up. He appears to have surrendered peacefully at about 7:15 pm to members of the Metro SWAT team.</p>
<p>During the incident, police closed main thoroughfares, such as Las Vegas Boulevard North and Washington Avenue in all directions, the Review-Journal said.</p>
<p>The roads — which motorists often use to reach Las Vegas casinos — were believed to have reopened later on Sunday night.</p>
<p>Police did not immediately identify the suspect, nor the victim. Nor was it clear what charges he faces. It is also unclear what led to the incident.</p>
<p>Stabbing at The Cosmopolitan</p>
<p>Las Vegas, particularly the area around the Las Vegas Strip, has seen stabbings and other violent crime in recent months.</p>
<p>For instance, in April Chris Okoronkwo, 33, was charged with attempted murder, assault, and battery with a deadly weapon following a dispute that led to a stabbing at The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas.</p>
<p>One victim suffered stab wounds during a struggle with Okoronkwo, police said. Okoronkwo also allegedly punched another man. The second victim fell and struck his head, losing consciousness.</p>
<p>Both men required medical treatment. It is believed they survived.</p>
<p>Following the fight, Okoronkwo allegedly tried to flee from the crime scene. But hotel-casino security guards were able to apprehend him. They also grabbed the knife out of his hand.</p>
<p>Okoronkwo later told police he had been drinking alcohol and could not recall events.</p>
<p>Knifed During Attempted Robbery</p>
<p>In an unrelated incident in June, a man was stabbed at the off-Strip Orleans Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas during an attempted robbery.</p>
<p>The suspect approached the victim and demanded his property. The man refused to hand it over.</p>
<p>The suspect then allegedly stabbed the victim. The suspect left the hotel-casino and was last seen running toward the Tropicana Las Vegas. The victim’s stab wound was not believed to be life-threatening.</p>
