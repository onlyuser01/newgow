    <h1>Real Casino Real Money Harrahs Casino Murphy Nc Central City Casinos Casino Mit Bonus Broken Bow Ok</h1>

<p>For anyone following along:</p>
<p>Dear Kosher, casinos are within their rights to ask players for more documents for verification if previously provided documents don't fully meet the requirements. I already mentioned what was the issue with the utility bills you provided in the personal email to you, that's why the casino asked for alternatives. Since you've been renting a flat/house, you can present a lease agreement signed by the owner of the property where you live. The property ownership document would be needed to confirm that the person you're renting from is indeed the owner. Do you think you can get such papers from the owner of your apartment?</p>
<p>As for the bank reference letter, I believe you don't need to go there with the notary, it should be a standard procedure for your bank to write a letter confirming you're their customer and stating your details there.</p>
<p><em>How do other documents such as my credit card statement not fully meet requirements? Why are we focusing on the one document i have stated i do not have many times to stake?</em></p>
<p>Hi Kosher,</p>
<p>I've just reviewed your case and am sorry to hear about your struggles with verification. I will try to help you by contacting the casino. We'll see what can be done when they reply.</p>
<p>Dear Stake Casino, I'd like to invite you to join this conversation and participate in the resolution of the player's complaint. Could you please share more information regarding the case? Would you please specify why exactly the documents provided for levels 3 and 4 of the verification were rejected? Have you received the wrong types of documents, or were they uploaded in the wrong format, or the quality was not sufficient enough?</p>
<p>I'm looking forward to hearing from you. In case of any supporting evidence, feel free to send it to my email natalia.b@casino.guru.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Natalia</p>

<p>Dear Stake Casino, according to the player, he is currently renting a flat so the utility bill comes to the name of the owner - the player doesn't have any utility bills issued in his name, so we'd like to ask you to consider alternative documents for the proof of address, such as a bank or credit card statement. Probably, the player would be able to provide any other alternatives from those listed on our website for Level 3 verification.</p>
<p><em>BOLDED NOT ADDRESSED, CREDIT CARD STATEMENT WAS PROVIDED</em></p>
<p>As for Level 4, I believe that the player doesn't receive any salary and doesn't have payslips so such documents are impossible to provide him, that is why the player provided you with the loan/credit statements. Would you please specify, if the player should upload his loan agreement in some other format so it meets your requirements?</p>
<p><em>BOLDED NOT ADDRESSED</em></p>
<p>Has also been a month and still no reply from Stake email on who my lawyer can contact and what document they need from my lawyer.</p>
