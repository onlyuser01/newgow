    <h1>Facebook Doubleu Casino Rampart Casino Las Vegas Red Rock Casino Buffet Casino Poker Free Casino Slo</h1>

<p>This complaint relates to a promotional email I received. While the actual value of the promotion is not much, it is the principle behind it that is important. If there is a discrepancy in the promotion, then they should correct it or explain to me why it is not working. This is the second time they have failed to honor their promotional offer. After letting the first one slide, it occurred again. In addition, I did not have a very positive experience with the representative. As opposed to trying to assist me, he focused on the promotional offers I had claimed. The promotion is the result of the deposits I have made, which he fails to recognize.</p>
<p>Drake Casino sent me a daily spins promo on 10/23/23. There is a limit of five consecutive days in which I can claim the Daily Spins, then I will be required to make a deposit. The spins themselves have a total of 5 spins and a choice of 3 games. Today is day number 5 and upon claiming the bonus, I received a reply stating that the bonus has been added to my account. In the actual game, it does not appear to have been credited, but appears in my transaction history. I contacted customer service via chat, but he was not able to assist me. Despite my efforts to explain to him that the bonus appears on my transaction history as if I had used it, he simply ignored my explanations.</p>
