    <h1>Hawaii Casino Casino Near Here Riverboat Casino Instant Withdrawal Casinos Deadwood Casinos Scatterh</h1>

<p>I empathize with your opinion though it's not based on solid ground.</p>
<p>Untill the casino decides to stop paying we are in the same position as the players. Did you know the casino is going to scam players eventually? Well, if you did, I'd love to know how you managed to know that.</p>
<p>We were trying to resolve the situation and informed the casino their rating will fall, so they should take immediate action. We tried.</p>
<p>Are we to be blamed because new casinos - unproven by time - decide to scam? I said that once, sadly, we aren't seers.</p>
<p>Every time something rises, it's also a kind of challenge - will it work or not? No one knows, the closes guest is a prediction.</p>
<p>It's easy to find a subject for such an accusation, I've seen this many times before. What remains is that no one could know for sure, but every reasonable player who takes time to check user reviews, forums, and open complaints has also a chance to make the decision.</p>
<p>We are not responsible for the casino's approach.</p>
<p>The idea of the lawsuit is quite out of hand. We are not a second car dealer and no one has signed any contract. We do not provide goods for sale. Every player playing in the casino is undergoing a risk, we intend to lower the chance you'd be scammed, but it doesn't mean if you're scammed, we're responsible.</p>
<p>I'm sorry your complaint was unresolved, it happens.</p>
<p>Anyway, did you try contacting the licensing authority as suggested? Did the company care?</p>
<p>You should try to bring the license provider to the court since it is closer to being in direct relation with the casino - they sell the licenses after all.</p>
