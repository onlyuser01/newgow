<p>Stacey Abrams, Democratic candidate for governor in Georgia, said she would support education and gambling if she is elected. Abrams plans to provide successful students with more opportunities and to fight for the legalization of gambling in the state.</p>
<p>Abrams Plans to Use Gambling Tax Money to Fuel Education</p>
<p>The Democrat nominee explained her goal is to provide all students with a C average or more with access to higher education. This investment in Georgia’s future is a way for Abrams to gain more support as the elections loom. Furthermore, Abrams has already thought of a way to get funding for her goals. Notably, she plans to usher in legalized gaming and use the tax money to finance education.</p>
<p>Studies project that the potential for billions exists in economic impact, funds that will not only finance our efforts to replenish and expand the HOPE scholarship but it will also provide new economic opportunities for Georgia that can grow jobs and make our economy stronger for everyone. Stacey Abrams, Democrat nominee</p>
<p>In short, Abrams promises to fight for the legalization of gaming and to use tax proceeds from the sector to fuel the Peach State’s schools.</p>
<p>The Fight to Launch Gambling in Georgia Continues</p>
<p>The Democrat nominee’s decision to support gambling is a curious one. It should be noted that Georgia is a rather traditional state with a strong stance against gambling as an industry. Despite having a lottery, the Peach State has long opposed the legalization of sports and casino games.</p>
<p>However, this isn’t to say that there is no support for gambling in the state. On the contrary, a few months ago, efforts were made to legalize some forms of wagering. In late March, a sports betting bill advanced to the state house. Although the bill failed to pass into law, it demonstrated that not everyone is against launching a Georgian betting market.</p>
<p>In addition, supporting gambling is a way for Abrams to gain the upper hand. Her opponent, Republican Governor Brian Kemp, narrowly won the 2018 elections. However, Kemp now has the upper hand as analysts predict he has a whopping 85% chance to win. Luckily for Abrams, there are still a few months left before the election.</p>
<p>Abrams’ move mirrors that of Democrats in other states. For example, Robert O’Rourke, Texas’ Democrat nominee, also announced that he would consider supporting legalizing gambling in the state. It is yet to be seen if Abrams’ tactic will help her dethrone her opponent.</p>
