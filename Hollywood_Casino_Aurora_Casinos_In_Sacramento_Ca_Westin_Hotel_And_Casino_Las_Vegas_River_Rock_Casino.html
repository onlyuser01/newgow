    <h1>Hollywood Casino Aurora Casinos In Sacramento Ca Westin Hotel And Casino Las Vegas River Rock Casino</h1>

<p>Scientific Games is set to continue driving strong results with its Scratch’N Win products in Canada, as the company has been able to establish itself as the primary instant game partner for Atlantic Lottery across a number of provinces. Moving forward, Scientific Games will offer local players in New Brunswick, Newfoundland, Labrador, Nova Scotia, and PEI its highly preferred Scratch’N Win products.</p>
<p>The contract covers the next five years, but it may be further extended by another five years should all involved parties agree. Commenting on this partnership, Atlantic Lottery VP of Lottery and Living Lab Maureen Wojick said that Scientific Games was a trusted partner as it has, for years now, delivered responsible and robust growth in sales.</p>
<p>Atlantic Lottery benefits from Scientific Games analytical tools to help build a library of games that are optimized to improve content across the board. On top of the highly coveted products, Atlantic Lottery also benefits from SG’s integrated central gaming and iLottery, which drives further cost efficiencies and products.</p>
<p>The system offers a range of experiences, including iGaming, sports betting, draw, and instant win options that are available across retail and online verticals. The PlayCentral HD self-service kiosks have already been launched in Labrador, New Brunswick, and Newfoundland. Commenting on this partnership opportunity, Scientific Games President of Americas &amp; Global Instant Products, John Schulz, said that his company was very happy to continue collaborating with the Atlantic Lottery.</p>
<p>He welcomed the company’s commitment to leveraging analytical tools in order to develop portfolios that boost results and drive customer satisfaction. "We are honored to continue our good work together to entertain Atlantic Lottery players in New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland and Labrador," Schulz added.</p>
<p>On top of that, Atlantic Lottery and Scientific Games go back a long time to 1983 when they first began collaborating. Throughout the decades, SG and Atlantic Lottery have been able to move with the times and deliver on technology and gaming options that strike home with players and position both companies at the forefront of the lottery business.</p>
<p>SG and Atlantic Lottery recently collaborated as part of another deal, which featured the WAVE point-of-sale retail technology introduced across thousands of Atlantic Lottery locations. Meanwhile, in the United States, SG has had a string of success with state lotteries in Texas, Idaho, and Colorado, among others, all over the past months.</p>
