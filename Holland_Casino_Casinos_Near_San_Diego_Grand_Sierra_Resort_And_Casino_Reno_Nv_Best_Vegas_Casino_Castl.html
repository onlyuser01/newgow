<p>Philippines Introduces AML Controls for Casinos in Response to Fed Bank Heist</p>

<p>Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte this week enacted legislation that will impose new anti-money-laundering directives (AML) on a previously very relaxed area of the regulated casino sector.</p>

<p>The country was left red-faced by the federal reserve cyber-heist, which focused the world’s attention on its devil-may-care attitude to international AML protocols.</p>
<p>On February 5, hackers flooded the Federal Reserve Bank of New York with requests for transfers totaling almost $1 billion from an account used by the government of Bangladesh. Around $101 million was successfully withdrawn before suspicions were raised.</p>
<p>Some $20 million of this sum was quickly traced to Sri Lanka and recovered. The rest was transferred to Philippine bank RCBC and, from there, $46 million found its way, via a remittance company, into the Philippine casino industry, where most of it disappeared.</p>
<p>The incident prompted calls for reform from Philippine politicians and the World Bank.</p>
<p>Exempt from AML Act</p>
<p>Casinos are exempted from the Philippine’s Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2001, which was passed largely as a measure to avoid being blacklisted by the Financial Action Task Force, an inter-governmental organization devoted to combating financial crime.</p>
<p>Manila has become a casino hub in recent years, competing for its share of the VIP segment with the casino sectors of Macau and Singapore.</p>
<p>But while the the Anti-Money Laundering Act requires most Philippine financial institutions to report suspicious transactions, and all transactions over a $10,000 threshold, it was felt that the relationships between casinos and their high rollers should remain necessarily discreet.</p>
<p>$99,000 Reporting Threshold</p>
<p>The new rules now require casinos to report all transactions exceeding five million pesos (around $99,000) to the central bank’s Anti-Money Laundering Council.</p>
<p>The council will have powers to obtain injunctions freezing these funds for up to six months if it is suspected they are “in any way related to an unlawful activity.”</p>
<p>“We should move to be more transparent by amending the law to protect our casinos from money laundering by crime syndicates,” said Josephine Sato, one of the new bill’s authors.</p>
<p>The approval of the measure was an uphill struggle due to fierce lobbying opposition from the gaming industry. Lawmakers wanted to introduce reporting requirements on transactions over $10,000, in line with AML laws in the US and elsewhere.</p>
<p>The $99,000 could be seen as a more casino-industry-friendly compromise.</p>
