<p>The two companies said they will strive to reduce latency between data and video, enhancing the overall sports betting experience</p>
<p>Infront’s betting-oriented division, Infront Bettor, announced a new global partnership with bet365, one of the biggest sports betting companies in the world. As agreed, bet365 will distribute Infront Bettor content for the next few years.</p>
<p>The multi-year agreement will see the operator distribute a total of 18,000 hours of content from more than 30 rights holders. As a result, as many as 80 million customers from 160 countries across the globe will have their sports experiences enhanced with premium sports streams.</p>
<p>Some of the distributed content will include streams from famous pro sports competitions, including the English Carabao Cup, Coup de France, Turkish Superlig and more. It will also include a suite of ice hockey rights for leagues such as the Champions Hockey League and the IIHF Ice Hockey World Championship – events that are exclusively marketed by Infront.</p>
<p>Bet365 and Infront Bettor will seek to minimize system latency during streams and reduce it as much as possible. The two companies realize how latencies and discrepancies between data and video can negatively impact customer experience and wish to work on this issue. Thanks to a new tech created in collaboration between Infront Bettor and iGameMedia, the former company will help bet365 significantly improve betting experiences.</p>
<p>The Deal Is a Testament to Infront Bettor’s Hard Work</p>
<p>Infront Bettor’s head, Chris Catling, commented on the deal with bet365 and called it a major milestone for his company. He noted that the months prior to the launch of the Infront Bettor division have been busy as the company was busy securing betting rights. However, this hard work paid off, as attested by the new deal with an industry-leading operator.</p>
<p>To agree terms with a partner who has led the digital revolution of online betting and is as forward-thinking as bet365 validates the hard work up until this point. I am excited to deliver our content to bet365 and to work with industry leaders to develop our proposition even further. Chris Catling, head, Infront Bettor</p>
<p>Catling added that he sees a new horizon for video products that drive betting engagement and interactivity. He is happy to see a big operator such as bet365 embrace real-time streaming.</p>
<p>Amikam Kranz, the vice president of media sales and operations at Infront’s sports and media unit, also shared his thoughts. He revealed that he is thrilled to pen an agreement with bet365, which he sees as a significant achievement for the divisions and the company as a whole.</p>
<p>Our partnership with a market leader like bet365 is a testament to our commitment and we look forward to this partnership growing and making the breadth of Infront’s offerings available to them. Amikam Kranz, VP media sales and operations, Infront Sports and Media</p>
<p>Bet365 is one of the biggest operators in the world and is available in multiple regulated jurisdictions. The company turned out to be the second biggest taxpayer in the United Kingdom, according to a new study.</p>
