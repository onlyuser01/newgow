<p>Entain Foundation US will make contributions to NHLAA health and wellness programs and make its education is accessible to all NHLAA members</p>
<p>The charity organization advocating for bettering the lives of its members, the NHL Alumni Association (NHLAA), and Entain Foundation US announced a new partnership focused on responsible gambling for hockey fans.</p>
<p>Expanding Educational Efforts</p>
<p>The new three-year agreement signed between the NHLAA and Entain Foundation made the Foundation an Official Responsible Gaming Partner of the charity organization operating in Canada and the US for the benefit of former NHL players.</p>
<p>Martin Lycka, senior vice president for American Regulatory Affairs and Responsible Gambling at Entain and Trustee of Entain Foundation US, commented on the new partnership, “proud to support the NHL Alumni Association and its members.”</p>
<p>“As sports betting continues to grow in popularity throughout North America, it is crucial that we expand our educational efforts,” Lycka said, outlining that the partnership with the NHLAA is a display of the importance of educational efforts “and will ensure that NHL Alumni and fans can gain access to impactful, educational programs on how to avoid gambling harm.”</p>
<p>As an Official Responsible Gaming Partner of the NHLAA, Entain Foundation will support the NHLAA through contributions to the charity’s health and wellness programs and expand the availability of their responsible gambling education programs to all NHLAA members.</p>
<p>Aligned Responsible Gaming Visions</p>
<p>On behalf of the NHL Alumni Association, the association’s president and executive director, Glenn Healy, spoke of the pride with which the NHLAA is entering the partnership with Entain Foundation, seeing it as a sign of the alignment between their team and the Foundation’s “vision of promoting responsible gaming research and education tools to sports fans.”</p>
<p>“We look forward to using the collective voice of our NHL Alumni members, each of which has paved the way for the game we love today, to champion safe gambling practices for all,” Healy concluded.</p>
<p>Under the partnership, Entain Foundation, the NHLAA and Wager Score, an analytical platform utilizing patented technology to provide data-driven insights into bettor behavior, will develop an educational program for the association’s members.</p>
<p>In addition, a pilot program for gambling affordability checks that was recently launched by Entain Foundation and Wager Score in Ontario may get incorporated into the partnership. The program requires bettors to submit documentation and confirm their financial stability before placing bets.</p>
<p>Entain Foundation’s comprehensive and innovative responsible gambling programs received yet another industry-wide recognition last month after the Foundation won the “Safer Gambling Operator of the Year” award at the EGR North America Awards in New York City.</p>
<p>Entain prevailed over DraftKings, FanDuel, PlayNow.com, Rush Street Interactive, and another NHLAA partner, PointsBet, to continue a two-year tradition of winning the top prize in nearly every industry competition for responsible gambling programs.</p>
