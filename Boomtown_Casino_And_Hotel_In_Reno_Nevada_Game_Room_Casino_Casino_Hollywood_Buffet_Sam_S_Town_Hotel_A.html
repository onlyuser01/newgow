    <h1>Boomtown Casino And Hotel In Reno Nevada Game Room Casino Casino Hollywood Buffet Sam S Town Hotel A</h1>

<p>You can close this complaint as resolved since they finally closed my account like I mentioned, it was the first purpose of the complaint. Next to that, I have denounced them to the Swiss gambling commission which replied to me that both casinos will be added on the blacklist and soon they will be blocked by our government so nobody will be able to connect on their casinos. At least they won't steal my people anymore.</p>
<p>Initially, I opened this complaint not because of refund, because like I said I didn't lose much money on this casino but because I wanted to close it and I want this complaint to be a proof that the casino should not reopen my account in the future. And with this complaint being visible, you cannot take casino side one more time when the proof is evident.</p>
<p>To conclude, you cannot reject my complaint since I sent you a proof of asking closure because of gambling addiction, whatever the date is, the casino should not have reopened my account at any costs. What is the point of writing emails, mentioning gambling addiction and the casino will do anything and you will still take casino's side, I really don't like that.</p>
<p>On the mail of 25th November, I only asked permanent closure and they replied to wait 48 hours to be closed but nothing was done. This is why I opened complaint here because they refused to close and were ignoring my demand. I will send you this email.</p>
<p>I thought this was the one you needed since it is the one where I mentioned gambling addiction. I would have loved to read that you take my side on this saying the casino should have not reopened my account after this date since I mentioned gambling addiction. You clearly read it in my mail. Are you going to say that it is still not enough? A permanent self exclusion don't have a time frame, it is not because it was last year that it should be forgotten. It is not my fault the casino didn't want to close my account all this time after how many requests I sent.</p>
