<p>Leon Edwards to Prove the World He Deserves His Title</p>
<p>Leon Edwards is 21-3 overall, with another one of his fights ending in no contest. When it comes to his losses, one happened by disqualification, while the other two happened by decision. All of those happened more than eight years ago.</p>
<p>His most recent defeat happened in 2015 in his first duel with Kamaru Usman, which “The Nigerian Nightmare” won by unanimous decision. The two met again in the title fight in August 2022, and we saw Edwards win with a spectacular head kick that put his opponent to sleep.</p>
<p>Usman got a chance to get the championship belt back in his possession in March 2023, but Edwards beat him again, this time by a majority decision.</p>
<p>Despite his brilliant run, Edwards has a lot of critics who don’t believe he deserves to be sitting on the welterweight throne. The best way to shush the critics is to beat Colby Covington in the UFC 296 headliner.</p>
<p>Colby Covington Ready for a Big Comeback</p>
<p>Donald Trump’s favorite fighter will almost certainly have the crowd at T-Mobile Arena on his side against the Englishman. He’ll be fired up in the December 16 fight, but the big question is whether he’s got the skillset to beat Edwards.</p>
<p>Colby is 17-3 overall, with all sorts of weapons in his arsenal. He’s a fantastic wrestler who won the gold medal at the World Grappling Championship a decade ago, and who tends to land a lot of powerful strikes in each fight.</p>
<p>He’s a former champ, who had to vacate his title due to injury in 2018. Since then, he’s had two more chances to win it back, but Kamaru Usman beat him each time. One of those losses saw him lose by a TKO.</p>
<p>Leon Edwards vs. Colby Covington Prediction</p>
<p>Leon Edwards is a -143 favorite to win the UFC 296 main event, and we 100% agree with oddsmakers on this one. Even though Covington definitely deserves a title shot, we do believe that the reigning champ is a better fighter at the moment.</p>
<p>Pick: Leon Edwards</p>
