    <h1>Casinos Florida Casino In Tucson Pechanga Resort Casino Location Bally Casino Nj Casinos In Oklahoma</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Thank you for reaching out to us!</p>
<p>Kindly note that as per our Bonus Rules item 3.4. Until the play through requirements have been met, the maximum amount per spin/ bet that can be placed is 5. We reserve the right to decline a withdrawal and void any winnings, if you place a bonus money bet higher than the allowed limit. The bet in question was placed on the 4th of April on the game Wolf Gold.</p>
<p>In regards to the reports not being displayed, please note that the situation occurred in early April. The user initially solicited logs for the period between the 27th of March and the 1st of April, however the account was registered only on the 4th of April. The user then requested the logs on the 11th of April and was informed via email that they can be retrieved from the account directly, via the Reconcile Report page. The user mentioned that they cannot retrieve them, so our Support team repeatedly requested screenshots of the report page at that time in order to diagnose the issue, however none were provided.</p>
<p>Concerning the latest email received, it contains a request for records for the 31st of June, however there has been no activity on the account since the 30th of April.</p>
<p>Should you require any additional help or information, please do not hesitate to contact us, we are available 24/7.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Rich Casino</p>
