<p>Marina Bay Sands, a luxurious hotel in Singapore, offering hospitality and gaming, will launch a new scholarship program. Las Vegas Sands, which owns the establishment, will invest $1 million in the program, benefitting over 100 local students.</p>
<p>MBS Launches a Scholarship Program</p>
<p>According to a statement from Las Vegas Sands, the program is a part of its efforts to help the hospitality sector and raise more workers. This is also the main priority of its global program Sands Cares.</p>
<p>The Sands Hospitality Scholarship Program is aimed at students who wish to work in the tourism and hospitality sector. The program targets the students of six local Institutes of Higher Learning, according to the casino company. This includes Nanyang Polytechnic, Ngee Ann Polytechnic, Republic Polytechnic, Singapore Polytechnic, the Singapore Institute of Technology and Temasek Polytechnic. Las Vegas Sands, its subsidiary, Marina Bay Sands and the six institutes signed a Memorandum of Understanding during a ceremony this Monday, allowing LVS to proceed with the program.</p>
<p>The program will allow certain students from said IHLs to receive a scholarship that they can use to cover their learning expenses. The recipients can pay for their courses, buy books and other student necessities or participate in exchange programs.</p>
<p>Las Vegas Sands announced that the scholarship program will continue for three or more years and will begin next year.</p>
<p>Las Vegas Sands Wants to Encourage People to Work in the Sector</p>
<p>Paul Town, chief operating officer of Marina Bay Sands, commented on the new program. He noted that MBS is one of the largest hospitality and casino companies around and, as such, wants to nurture local hospitality talents.</p>
<p>According to Town, the venue already employs thousands of talented people in diverse roles and hopes to help raise the next generation of skillful hospitality workers. According to him, this program is a way for Marina Bay Sands to encourage more people to work in the hospitality industry.</p>
<p>We are always on the lookout for the brightest talents to join us in our next stage of growth, and the scholarship is intended to encourage more to chart their paths in this burgeoning industry. Paul Town, COO, Marina Bay Sands</p>
<p>In May, Marina Bay Sands ran another initiative that aimed to incentivize workers to join the sector. The company held a two-day walk-in recruitment fair where it promised to hire 2,000 new workers. During the event, the entire recruitment process was facilitated, making it easier for workers to join the company.</p>
