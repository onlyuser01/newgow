    <h1>Castle Casino Login L Auberge Casino In Louisiana Casino Walker Mn Blackoak Casino Hotels Near Cache</h1>

<p>Hello, I have already written in the discussions with Radka and I think now is the time to file a complaint. I played there for the first time on March 17th. Before I started, of course, I first looked at which payment and payment methods are available. The credit card was displayed for deposits and withdrawals, so I paid in with a credit card. Now I would have won a bit and wanted to have the 250 euros paid out to me on March 17th, also via credit card. My account is verified and I also played without a bonus. A few hours later I checked again, my payment was rejected. I asked in the live chat, I was told I should submit a new application. I did, looked in again a few hours later, rejected again. Again in the live chat and again the same statement, make a new application. It's been like this for 5 days now, meanwhile the payout has been rejected 10 times. Sometimes it says it's up to the payment provider, then there's a technical problem and I keep submitting a new application. I didn't get an answer by email. Since I wrote here under the discussions, I got an answer that I should write everything again in English, nothing else. I did, 1 day later I received an email that I should tell you which email I used to register with you. I also sent. I think they don't want to pay out. I've asked several times if you can send me the money via bank transfer, but I haven't gotten an answer. I have no idea about the other payment methods because I don't own them. I hope you can help me somehow here.</p>
