<p>The new year is starting on an important footing for Gauselmann Group which will be known as Merkur Group moving forward. Following 67 years as the former, Gauselmann has chosen to move forward with what is one of its most ambitious rebranding moves and will be known as Merkur.com AG moving forward.</p>
<p>The news has been shared in an official press release and the change is effective from Monday, January 1, 2024, as the new year has been the right time for the decade-old German gambling business to set the slate clean.</p>
<p>If the name Gauselmann has been hailed as a hallmark of excellence and performance in the land-based sector, the shift to Merkur as a new brand identity is symbolic of the business' increased engagement with digital markets, but also expanding onto international markets and beyond the home stomping ground in Germany.</p>
<p>Merkur Chairman of the Management Board Paul Gauselmann had this to say, celebrating the transformation towards a more digitally-optimized business:</p>
<p>"Both developments will benefit from linking the appeal of our Merkur brand to the company name."</p>
<p>The news was naturally hailed by the entire group. Gauselmann outlined a few other details about the rebranding. The executive assured that Merkur will stand for what the company did under its previous name, which includes continuity and stability as cornerstones moving forward.</p>
<p>"The renaming is also a nod to the success of the Merkur brand," he added. The rebranding is an interesting move indeed and comes after decades of operations under the Gauselmann brand identity.</p>
<p>The company first started in the 1970s and was built and spearheaded to prominence by Paul Gauselmann himself. Although his family name will disappear from the company's headquarters, the structure of ownership is not going to change as the Gauselmann Family Foundation will still be in control.</p>
