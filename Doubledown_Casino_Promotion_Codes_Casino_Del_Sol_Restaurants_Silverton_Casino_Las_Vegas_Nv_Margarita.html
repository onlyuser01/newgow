    <h1>Doubledown Casino Promotion Codes Casino Del Sol Restaurants Silverton Casino Las Vegas Nv Margarita</h1>

<p>I am limited to working with the data that has been provided to me, and unfortunately, I have exhausted all available options. After reviewing both the casino and your scenarios, I have provided you with my findings and advised you on what to do if you are unsatisfied. If you choose to file a complaint with the regulator, I am willing to assist you in any way I can. However, it is important to understand that I cannot help if you claim that all the information from the casino is fake and they are attempting to cheat you. Additionally, the evidence you have provided, such as a few screenshots, is not sufficient proof to support your claim. (deposit screenshot - but I calculated with this time anyway)</p>
<p>Regarding the 4 mbtc:</p>
<p>From log:</p>
<p>9.3.2023, you stopped playing, and your balance was almost zero.</p>
<p>10.3.2023 (from logs), you started to play by activating the no-deposit bonus. (3/10/2023 6:26:32 PM)</p>
<p>3/10/2023 6:33:41 PM is the time and date when your deposit appeared on your account.</p>
<p>Because real money is used first in several subsequent bets, you lost your real balance and then continued to play with bonus balance which had a limit on winnings.</p>
<p>Because you insist that you deposited before you took a bonus. If the real money deposit happened at exactly 6:24 PM (from your screenshot), you waited 2 minutes, activated a bonus, and started to play. Again real money is used first, and in this case, you lost your real money deposit in just a few rounds and continued to play bonus balance which had a limit on winnings.</p>
<p>You had 4 mbtc on your account I am not denying it - and yes this money you could saw as cashable funds however you won this money from a bonus with max cash out rule on it. Therefore the casino capped your winnings.</p>
<p>I understand how are you feeling, we were trying to help you, and I am sad that you don't see it.</p>
<p>So, I am sorry, I truly did everything in my power to help you, but right now I am out of the options and must reject your case.</p>
<p>Please let me know if you need my help to submit your complaint to the casino's regulator.</p>
