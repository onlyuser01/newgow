    <h1>Usa Casino No Deposit Bonus Slot Casino Near Me Black Lotus Casino Bonus Codes Golden Nugget Online</h1>

<p>PENN Entertainment has announced this as a major milestone for the two platforms. PENN Interactive, a subsidiary of PENN Entertainment, took the initiative to undergo the accreditation process and made history by becoming the first US operator to earn this recognition.</p>
<p>The Accreditation Shows PENN’s Commitment to Responsible Gaming</p>
<p>The RG Check accreditation is widely regarded as one of the most comprehensive responsible gambling accreditation programs in the world, and PENN Interactive’s achievement is a testament to the company’s commitment to responsible gaming.</p>
<p>Chris Soriano, Vice President, Chief Compliance Officer, commented on the achievement:</p>
<p>PENN is committed to being at the forefront of responsible gaming and achieving this accreditation for our online platforms further strengthens our top of class RG program. We have and will continue to be proactive by investing in valuable training and resources to ensure that we are providing the safest possible environment for players to responsibly enjoy gaming. Chris Soriano, VP/CCO, PENN Interactive</p>
<p>Soriano further stated that the fact that the company elected to undergo the accreditation process and received it following a thorough review of its operation shows that they are putting into action the highest standards of responsible gambling programming.</p>
<p>At PENN Entertainment, promoting a culture of responsible gaming is a top priority, and the company has established a comprehensive framework to ensure this is achieved. A Corporate Responsible Gaming Committee oversees and manages the company’s responsible gaming initiatives, making certain that the programs are carried out to an exceptional standard.</p>
<p>The Accreditation Was Acquired on a Voluntary Basis</p>
<p>The RG Check accreditation certifies online gaming sites that have the necessary tools to address and prevent harm related to gambling. Although this accreditation is not mandatory in the US, where the majority of Barstool’s operations take place, the company chose to voluntarily participate in the process to demonstrate its commitment to social responsibility.</p>
<p>Shelley White, CEO of RGC, extended her congratulations to PENN Interactive for attaining the RG Check accreditation for its US-based sites. According to White, this achievement reinforces the company’s dedication to protecting players and making responsible gambling a priority in its operations.</p>
<p>White continued by expressing that the RGC is satisfied to continue supporting PENN Interactive’s efforts to minimize harm across different jurisdictions.</p>
<p>The Responsible Gambling Council developed the RG Check program in collaboration with policymakers, global gambling providers, players, and individuals who have experienced harm from gambling. The accreditation process evaluates, monitors, and manages all aspects of a company’s responsible gambling strategy, making it a valuable tool for gaming operators.</p>
