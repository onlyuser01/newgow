<p>Playstudios One of Worst-Performing De-SPACed Companies Over Past Year</p>

<p>Social casino developer Playstudios (NASDAQ:MYPS) became a publicly traded entity following a merger with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC). It’s one of the worst-performing members of an expansive group that opted to go public that way.</p>

<p>Playstudios became a freestanding public company in June after a merger with Acies Acquisition, a blank-check firm started by former MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM) CEO Jim Murren. Shares of the gaming company have been more than cut in half since June 21, the first day of trading. But it’s far from the only de-SPACed offender.</p>
<p>Out of the 107 companies that completed their SPAC mergers to date in 2021, only 24 percent (26) are trading above their $10 IPO price,” according to SPAC Track.</p>
<p>When Murren’s Acies and Playstudios announced the merger agreement in February, the gaming company was valued at $1.1 billion, or a tolerable 2.5x 2022 estimated revenue of $435 million. It came to market with $220 million in cash. Today, its market capitalization is just $580.55 million.</p>
<p>Playstudios Far From Lone de-SPAC Offender</p>
<p>When blank-check companies, such as Acies, go public, it’s usually at a price of $10 per share. Typically, the share price jumps when the SPAC announces a deal, and from there, the stock becomes a proxy for the acquired company.</p>
<p>Using $10 as the benchmark, Playstudios is one of the worst-performing de-SPACed stocks over the past year, having shed nearly 60 percent. The stock is down almost 70 percent from its February high, reached following the merger announcement.</p>
<p>However, Playstudios isn’t alone among post-SPAC offenders. A variety of gaming companies that went public via blank-check transactions are slumping, and five other firms across multiple industries experienced worse de-SPAC share declines than Playstudios.</p>
<p>Market observers and blank-check experts say those declines are mostly attributable to poor underlying fundamentals and some de-SPACed companies being pre-revenue firms. Playstudios has revenue, though its second-quarter sales dipped $7.1 million year-over-year, while the company posted negative net income after being positive on that basis a year earlier.</p>
<p>Data confirms post-SPAC performance is waning across the board.</p>
<p>“Since the IPOX SPAC Index peaked on Feb. 17, it has lost over 25 percent of its value, while the Russell 2000 Index is down around -2 percent,” says Cameron McVie of Russell Investments.</p>
<p>Speculative Climate</p>
<p>Companies born out of blank-check transactions, regardless of industry, generated massive amounts of hype among retail investors, stoking fears of a bubble.</p>
<p>“We also have experienced a period of plenty of speculative buying across the financial markets, such as retail investors investing in meme-mania stocks via platforms such as Robinhood that have driven some wild stock price gyrations,” adds McVie.</p>
<p>“Notably, BofA Research identified that retail investors in the SPAC universe accounted for twice the trading volume, compared to the S&amp;P 500 and Russell 2000 stocks, during the second half of 2020,” McVie continued.</p>
<p>Specific to Playstudios, it operates in fast-growing segment analysts and investors are enthusiastic about. Additionally, its business model, including its loyalty program — playAwards — and partnership with MGM Resorts is viable. Its clientele are also devoted, with 4.2 million monthly average users playing close to an hour per day.</p>
