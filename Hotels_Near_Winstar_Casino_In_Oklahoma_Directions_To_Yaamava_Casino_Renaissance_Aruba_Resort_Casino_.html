    <h1>Hotels Near Winstar Casino In Oklahoma Directions To Yaamava Casino Renaissance Aruba Resort Casino</h1>

<p>This place should be investigated and shut down. I 've requested BTC withdrawals twice each time it is a trip down bullshit lane.. It takes over two to three weeks, then they finally email you 2 weeks later to ask for documents, which they already have from last w/d which I sent in again anyway, then they reversed it because I exceeded the 48-hour limit??? Now I have to re request the withdrawal. You get ZERO acknowledgement of the request via email, and then get BS answers via chat. Im still waiting on my last withdraw request. I will NEVER play here again. God help uou if you win a jackpot. I can only imagine the crap theyll throw at you to not pay out. Criminals. I'll stick with Ignition Casino, they pay when they say they will and its ALWAYS within 48 hours with no BS.</p>
