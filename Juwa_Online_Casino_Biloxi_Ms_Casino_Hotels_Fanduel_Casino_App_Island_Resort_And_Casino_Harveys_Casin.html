<p>SportPesa is back and, as you can imagine, this is good news for the millions of sports fans who awaited its return with excitement. Today, we will take a look under the hood of one of the largest online betting firm, enjoying interest from over 12 million sports bettors in Africa alone.</p>
<p>As part of our SportPesa Sportsbook review, we will talk about all there is to know about the brand, including available markets, payment options, active sponsorships, the in-play betting feature, and more.</p>
<p>Since there is plenty to cover, we suggest that we dive right into it. SportPesa comes with a dedicated app to allow you to track live scores and more, all of that so you can stay informed of what’s going on with your favorite sport.</p>
<p>SportPesa Betting Markets, Odds, and Fixtures</p>
<p>SportPesa is one of the largest sportsbooks worldwide with a strong presence in the United Kingdom and Africa. Even though the company had to withdraw temporarily in 2019 and was reinstated in October 2020, SportPesa has not lost any of its ability to excite the crowds of hungry sports bettors who have remained loyal to the brand even in its extended absence.</p>
<p>Today, SportPesa is back, bringing with it thousands of markets across 10 sports and counting. Sports aficionados will be able to adjust their wagers on some of the world’s most competitive athletic contests, including football, basketball, tennis, rugby union, boxing, cricket, handball, ice hockey, MMA, and even volleyball.</p>
<p>SportPesa’s market variety includes a good number of traditional fixtures, such as 3WAY or Match Winner, Double Chance, Over/Under 2.5, and Both Teams to Score, to name a few viable selections.</p>
<p>Yet, each contest has a selection of proposition or prop bets where you may get a little more specific as to what type of wager you want to make. Kenyan sports fans have an excellent choice when it comes to betting opportunities on Correct Score, Totals, Half and Full Time, or even Asian Totals.</p>
<p>Kenyan sports bettors will get their hands on a selection of worthwhile competitions to bet on. Football, which holds sway over the country, is well represented with events such as Premier League, Primera Division, Bundesliga, Ligue 1, Serie A, and more.</p>
<p>Tennis fans are welcome to stake their wagers on ATP and MMA enthusiasts can bet on multiple fights all throughout the month. The NBA and NHL are naturally covered, although there are plenty of other country basketball and hockey competitions to bet on as well.</p>
<p>Live Bet with SportPesa Sportsbook</p>
<p>To bring you the best possible experience, SportPesa has put a well-deserved focus on its in-play betting feature. Sports fans are able to bet on games live and benefit from a quick and intuitive bet slip.</p>
<p>The sportsbook covers football, basketball, and tennis for the time being, with the operator looking to expand into additional in-play markets. There are usually several live games you can bet on, giving you plenty of options to place the bets you are particularly interested in.</p>
<p>SportPesa’s live betting software is quick and intuitive and will fit well with any playstyle, and especially if you are an in-play markets fan yourself.</p>
<p>Create Your Own Bets with SportPesa JengaBets</p>
<p>SportPesa allows you to create your own markets and bet on them thanks to a feature called JengaBets. This is precisely what it sounds like. Players are invited to click on a game and create proposition and match bets.</p>
<p>You are free to set any amounts across the available categories, as well as pick a scorer, and making predictions about game-specific developments, such as the number of cards, corners, and goals in a game of football for example.</p>
<p>JengaBets are a fantastic way to spice your gaming experience up and have a bit of fun with the traditional sports betting experience. The feature is unique to SportPesa and is one of the most innovative sports betting solutions since the introduction of the betting exchange.</p>
<p>SportPesa Is Built for Mobile</p>
<p>SportPesa Sportsbook is optimized for mobile play and it allows you to enjoy a dedicated mobile experience from any portable device. Sports fans are very welcome to place their wagers via an Android or iOS smartphone or tablet, directly via their device browser.</p>
<p>If you prefer, you may download a dedicated mobile app, which will power the entire experience for you. The app allows you to follow live scores in real-time and place bets remotely and intuitively.</p>
<p>One minor downside to the app, though, is that you may only download it on an Android device for the time being in Kenya. Nevertheless, the app works well for both Android and iOS sports fans in the UK.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can simply use their browsers to enjoy the same level of intuitive and quick betting experience as their Android counterparts.</p>
<p>While the mobile app clearly focuses on providing consumers with valuable information about sports betting markets, you can also access other popular features of the experience, including JengaBets, Jackpot, Live Games, and more.</p>
<p>Payments and M-Pesa</p>
<p>Since SportPesa operates in multiple jurisdictions, it’s worth mentioning all available native banking methods.</p>
<p>United Kingdom</p>
<p>For the United Kingdom, SportPesa sports fans may simply opt for familiar payment options such as Neteller, Skrill, MasterCard, and Visa. The set minimum limit is $20 all the way up to $2,000 per transaction.</p>
<p>To withdraw money from SportPesa, you will need to verify your identity by submitting the necessary documents, including a Valid Photographic ID, Debit Card scan, and Proof of Address. The process is part of the verification process in the United Kingdom and you should have no issue following through.</p>
<p>Kenya</p>
<p>SportPesa Kenya uses a unique payment option that allows players to deposit via a Paybill number and M-Pesa. Once you complete your registration, you will be able to access your mobile money menu via a unique identifier revealed to you during the registration process. It will look something similar to:</p>
<p>M-Pesa: 5212121</p>
<p>Once you have charged your account, you will receive a notification message, which will read something on the lines of “KSH 100 received! Your S-PESA account balance is: KSH 100.” To withdraw your money, you will use the same mobile solution.</p>
<p>Customer Support</p>
<p>To get in touch with SportPesa, you may choose from several worthwhile and available options, including email, live chat, or a contact number. Patrons are welcome to choose a method they feel the most comfortable with.</p>

<p>Facebook: SportPesa</p>

<p>Players may also reach out to SportPesa via the FAQ section, which will offer a very quick rundown of what to expect and every common question finding a handy answer in the section.</p>
<p>SportPesa Kenya: Is It Really Back?</p>
<p>SportPesa returned to Kenya on October 30, 2020, after taking a leave of absence in 2019. The reason behind the withdrawal was a dispute with the government. The Betting Control and Licensing Board (BCLB) suspended the company’s license in July 2019, arguing that it owed millions in back tax.</p>
<p>That tax was supposedly calculated on a proposed by the government’s decision to tax the gross revenue receipts, which would have put SportPesa at a severe financial disadvantage and inability to operate. SportPesa Kenya decided to leave the country instead and pulled the plug on several high-profile sports partnerships.</p>
<p>The sportsbook did defeat the controversial tax law with the help of Nairobi High Court, but when the brand returned in 2020, it was once again blocked by the Betting Control and Licensing Board, which argued that the new operator of the trademark, Milestone Games Limited, had not obtained it as per the required regulatory framework.</p>
<p>Shortly before SportPesa returned in October 2020, the government had said it would consider enabling mobile financial transactions for the purposes of gambling. The Kenyan government also made some concessions in July 2020 when it agreed to overturn the controversial tax betting law with the 2020 Finance Bill.</p>
<p>Verdict</p>
<p>SportPesa is one of the most prominent names in Kenya. The sportsbook has tied multiple partnerships with soccer and sports teams across the country and seared itself in the memory of millions of fans.</p>
<p>In terms of its breadth and operation, SportPesa Sportsbook easily rivals any other sportsbook not only in Kenya, but well across Africa, and back in the United Kingdom. The sportsbook has set the quality for a betting firm high and as a result, players may enjoy one of the best sportsbooks experience, not just in Kenya, but the world over.</p>
