<p>Seattle Seahawks Still Believing in Their Playoff Future</p>
<p>The Seattle Seahawks are 6-5 in 2023. This is kind of surprising as their 2023 roster did not appear capable of challenging for a spot in the postseason before the start of the season. They’ve got a chance to grab a wild card ticket to the playoffs, but for that, they need to up their form.</p>
<p>The Seahawks are 1-3 in their last four games, which could be a sign that the initial enthusiasm about Pete Carroll’s team is going to deflate. This isn’t just because of their recent run, but also for the fact that their fixture list looks very tough.</p>
<p>After their game with the Cowboys, they also have to play with the 49ers, Eagles, and a few other teams that seem capable of beating them. To make things even worse, the Cowboys also have a tough schedule ahead. What this means is that they’ll probably want to grab an easy win before things get rough.</p>
<p>Dallas Cowboys Want to Keep Their Good Run Going</p>
<p>The Cowboys are 8-3 overall with three wins in a row, which saw them score a total of 127 points or 42.33 points per game on average.</p>
<p>Dak Prescott and Jake Ferguson are absolutely locked in together right now, this is gorgeous ball placement by Dak; an incredibly high level throw here with deft touch and accuracy! Just an absolute dime! #DallasCowboys pic.twitter.com/bnU45sL26t — Kevin Gray Jr. (@KevinGraySports) November 24, 2023</p>
<p>Quarterback Dak Prescott has been in fabulous form throughout the entire 2023 season. He’s thrown for 2,935 yards in total for 23 touchdowns and just six interceptions. With CeeDee Lamb, Brandin Cooks, and Jake Ferguson on the receiving end, Prescott &amp; Cowboys look unstoppable offensively.</p>
<p>What about their defense? With 16.8 points conceded per game, the Cowboys defense is fourth-best in the entire league. That number is even better when it comes to playing at AT&amp;T Stadium – at home they’re allowing just 12.0 points.</p>
<p>Seattle Seahawks vs. Dallas Cowboys Prediction</p>
<p>You can be 100% certain that the Dallas Cowboys are going to take this game seriously. First of all, they want to keep their good run going. Secondly, they’re playing on home turf. Finally, a win in the Thursday Night Football game would give keep their confidence high ahead of the games with much tougher opponents.</p>
<p>Pick: Dallas Cowboys -7.5 (-110)</p>
