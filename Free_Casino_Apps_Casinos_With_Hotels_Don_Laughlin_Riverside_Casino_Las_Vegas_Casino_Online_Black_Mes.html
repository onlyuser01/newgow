    <h1>Free Casino Apps Casinos With Hotels Don Laughlin Riverside Casino Las Vegas Casino Online Black Mes</h1>

<p>100% no one in my family could register at this casino!</p>
<p>The email belongs to me and no one else has access to it!</p>
<p>The IP address does not belong to me; a VPN service is constantly running on my computer to bypass local restrictions. But I’m sure this is not a problem, my account has already been fully checked by the security service. However, I don’t know what happened next! The support service tells me something similar to a fairy tale - that someone who is 100% like me registered with them and therefore they blocked two accounts. Why did I suffer from the activities of a stranger?</p>
<p>Although Fortunejack provides a bonus for 24 hours, it did not affect my account in any way because the bonus stopped working even before my account was fully verified, which was completed. Therefore, we can say that the bonuses did not affect my balance in any way. And it stopped working long before I was blocked.</p>
<p>Specifically, Fortunek does not send a letter in which it will be written that your account has been confirmed. First, they sent me a letter saying that the withdrawal of funds was delayed and asked me to go through a KYC check, and then they sent me a letter saying that the money had been withdrawn. This symbolizes the end of the test for them. https://prnt.sc/kV2e7udxHeZW - ask KYC https://prnt.sc/ndJ6Nm_-yWJ3 - withdrawal is being processed</p>
<p>The problem is that in the middle of the week an account appeared, which, as they say, is 100% connected with me and without any investigation they blocked my account with all the money!</p>
