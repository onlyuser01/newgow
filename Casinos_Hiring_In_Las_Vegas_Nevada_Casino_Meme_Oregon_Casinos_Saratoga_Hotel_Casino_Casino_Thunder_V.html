    <h1>Casinos Hiring In Las Vegas Nevada Casino Meme Oregon Casinos Saratoga Hotel Casino Casino Thunder V</h1>

<p>Just to sum it up. We add approximately 100+ new casinos on the website every month. We sometimes find the new casino on our own, sometimes, the players send us the link to the casino, in other cases, the casinos inform us on their own. So we did the initial review for Scatterhall. We didn't find any issues in their terms and conditions, the website was working, they had many active game providers, there was no clear relationship to other casinos so they were labelled as a fresh casino and got 7.2 rating, which is what every fresh casino receives if there are no clear issues. I'd like to remind you that they didn't get 10/10, they got 7.2. We also provided the information that the casino is fresh, thus the information we have about them are very limited.</p>
<p>You took your own money and decided to play in a casino that hasn't been proven by time instead of playing in reliable brands. You deposited your money into the casino, you won and then it turned out that the casino is (probably) a scam. You assume that we (the online casino database) should pay players a partial refund based on what? Because the casino is in our database where you find over 5000 other casinos?</p>
<p>One more question: If you also had an issue with Scatterhall, why didn't you submit a complaint as many others during the period when it only looked like they have some issues with the payment provider?</p>
