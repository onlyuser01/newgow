    <h1>Casino In Dallas Casinos Near Me With Slots Casino Rochester Ny Vegasrush Casino Black River Falls C</h1>

<p>A fresh content partnership between Ainsworth and Rush Street Interactive will see Ainsworth bring its portfolio of acclaimed slot titles to New Jersey again with RSI’s PlaySugarHouse.com Casino.</p>
<p>Ainsworth’s achievements for 2020</p>
<p>Australian gaming supplier Ainsworth has signed a fresh content partnership with iGaming and betting operator Rush Street Interactive in New Jersey. The partnership follows a deal with Roar Digital in the Garden State earlier this year, which allowed Ainsworth to enter into content partnerships with BetMGM, Borgata, and PartyCasino.</p>
<p>Now, Ainsworth continues to expand its footprint in the state by signing up with RSI, an established name in the casino industry, and launching its slot titles on PlaySugarHouse.com, the online casino operated by RSI.</p>
<p>Under the partnership, Ainsworth is going to provide some of its best slots to PlaySugarHouse.com so that players can enjoy new games and be able to experience different slot mechanics.</p>
<p>Ainsworth online general manager Jason Lim commented on the deal praising it as a huge step forward for the company. Even though Ainsworth is already present in New Jersey’s casino market, the company is excited to be joining efforts with recognized partners such as RSI, as that is going to help the vendor increase its presence and clout in the state.</p>
<p>Ainsworth is now able to offer its high-quality slots to a bigger audience and have its company name in the public eye.</p>
<p>PlaySugarHouse.com players will enjoy select titles such as Viking Reign, Amazon Gold, Sweet Chili, and Action Dragons. The supplier has vowed that new games will be added frequently for players to enjoy.</p>
<p>RSI’s thoughts on the deal</p>
<p>It is already an established fact that Ainsworth’s slots are of good quality and have high entertainment value, as well as unique game features such as jackpots. This is why Richard Schwartz, president of Rush Street Interactive, commented that the deal itself was something players visiting PlaySugarHouse.com were excited about as well.</p>
<p>RSI always comes up with new games for PlaySugarHouse.com every week which is why the partnership with Ainsworth is about to contribute more to the high quality the RSI and PlaySugarHouse maintain and add dynamic games players are looking forward to.</p>
<p>In the past few months, both Rush Street and Ainsworth set up a few very important deals. Ainsworth signed up with Roar Digital and now Rush Street Interactive, engraving its name as one of the best gaming suppliers in the USA. RSI has also struck deals with Coushatta and Habanero.</p>
<p>Thanks to its link-up with RSI, Habanero has been able to debut its games in Colombia, part of the quickly growing Latin American market. The Coushatta Casino and Resort picked RSI as a partner for the launch of a new social casino back in August.</p>
<p>Further achievements are surely awaiting both Ainsworth and Rush Street Interactive, and now officially as official partners. Rush Street also launched in Pennsylvania with BetRivers in January 2020.</p>
