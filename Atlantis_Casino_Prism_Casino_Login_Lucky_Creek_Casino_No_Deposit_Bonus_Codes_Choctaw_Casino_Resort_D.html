    <h1>Atlantis Casino Prism Casino Login Lucky Creek Casino No Deposit Bonus Codes Choctaw Casino Resort D</h1>

<p>Ahead of the upcoming Super Bowl, the gambling regulator in New Jersey, announced a new proactive approach that seeks to reduce problem and at-risk sports betting in the state</p>
<p>The regulatory body in charge of gambling in the state, the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement (DGE), was planning the implementation of the new proactive method since March last year. Although the DGE unveiled details this week regarding the initiative, it said that its official launch was on January 1, 2023. This initiative, according to the regulator, is a first of its kind for the country and seeks to fight against problem gambling and at-risk gambling by identifying patrons prior to them being affected by gambling harm.</p>
<p>Currently, sports betting companies already collect player data. Upon registering with operators, the customers agree to the terms and conditions that their data can be monitored. This is primarily for efforts against identity theft, cheating and fraud.</p>
<p>However, under the new initiative, gambling operators in New Jersey will have to analyze player data to help flag if patrons are showing signs of at-risk or problem gambling and engage with them proactively. Specifically, the DGE outlined parameters for patron activities that operators should be on the lookout for which include but are not limited to:</p>
<p>bettors who repeatedly engage in self-imposed restrictions such as cool-off periods</p>
<p>customers that demonstrate increases in gambling time from week to week</p>
<p>players that continue to gamble until they have less than $1 dollar within their accounts</p>
<p>customers who regularly visit the operator’s self-exclusion page but do not self-exclude</p>
<p>players that submit multiple requests for increasing limits for deposits or losses within 24-hour periods</p>
<p>clients that deposit lump sums of cash and more activities categorized as “warning signs”</p>
<p>The Initiative Strengthens New Jersey’s Responsible Gambling Efforts</p>
<p>Under the existing gambling regulation in New Jersey, all ads by gambling operators need to include a responsible gaming message. Additionally, the bettors need to have access to self-exclusion options and different wagering functionalities that enable them to monitor and control their spending, duration of gambling and deposits. With that in mind, the DGE explained that the new proactive approach applies to online betting and “will supplement the state’s existing responsible gaming safeguards.”</p>
<p>“This new approach will enable dedicated responsible gaming experts employed by the platforms and us to see the early warning signs and reach at-risk patrons before they find themselves in a financial catastrophe.“ David Rebuck, director at the DGE</p>
<p>David Rebuck, DGE’s director, explained that the new initiative uses data to help identify and inform potential at-risk gamblers about the responsible gambling options available to them. Additionally, such individuals will be given invaluable advice on how to change their behavior in order to avoid problem gambling. Rebuck said that the new approach will help experts employed by gambling operators engage with patrons who are showing early warning signs of at-risk gambling.</p>
