<p>Golf Odds: Bets Placed on Tony Romo Winning Byron Nelson, $100 Wager Would Net $1M</p>

<p>Former Dallas Cowboys star quarterback Tony Romo is again teeing it up on the PGA Tour this week, and a handful of bettors are actually wagering a few bucks on the CBS NFL analyst to win.</p>

<p>The PGA Tour is in Dallas this week for the AT&amp;T Byron Nelson Championship at Trinity Forest Golf Club, which Romo belongs. But of the 156-player field, the football retiree has the longest odds of winning – by a longshot.</p>
<p>The Westgate SuperBook in Las Vegas has the 39-year-old at 10,000/1 to win the tournament. Those odds imply a chance of less than 0.1 percent. Just a $5 bet and a Romo victory would net $50,000.</p>
<p>This will be Romo’s third PGA Tour event, but first in a tournament that isn’t being contested opposite a more marquee championship. He received sponsorship exemptions in each of the past two Corales Puntacana Golf &amp; Resort Championship in the Dominican Republic while the world’s best golfers participated in the WGC-Dell Technologies Match Play.</p>
<p>Romo shot +15 in each Puntacana trip, beating a just one player in two years.</p>
<p>Bryon Nelson Odds</p>
<p>There are plenty of critics to Tony Romo accepting a sponsor’s exemption to play in the Bryon Nelson. They believe the space would be better utilized by a pro who is trying to make a living.</p>
<p>Of course, it’s the sponsor’s right – in this case AT&amp;T – to award a spot to whoever the company wishes. Romo’s inclusion also generates additional media coverage, and for oddsmakers, perhaps a few extra bets. CBS has paid Romo $4 million annually for his NFL work.</p>
<p>Speaking with the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, Romo responded, “This is what I want to do. This is my livelihood. You don’t just get them randomly. You’ve got to be able to perform at some time in front of somebody who thinks you deserve it. I’ve been practicing … and I practice really hard at it, just like a touring pro.”</p>
<p>The SuperBook confirms it has taken six wagers on Romo’s play. The largest wager is a $100 bet for the ex-quarterback to win that would pay a staggering $1 million. The sportsbook also has an over/under line on his opening round score at 77.5.</p>
<p>As for the far likelier victors, Brooks Koepka is the favorite at 13/2. He’s followed by Hideki Matsuyama (16/1), Texas native Jordan Spieth (18/1), and defending champ Aaron Wise and Henrik Stenson rounding out the top five at 20/1.</p>
<p>PGA Preview</p>
<p>We’re just a little more than a week out from the PGA Championship being played at New York’s Bethpage State Park’s Black Course on Long Island.</p>
<p>Masters champ Tiger Woods (8/1) currently has the shortest odds of winning – which would be his 16th major to bring him closer to Jack Nicklaus’ record 18. Long hitters Dustin Johnson and defending champion Koepka trail at 10/1, Rory McIlroy is at 12/1, and Justin Thomas and Rickie Fowler are at 16/1.</p>
<p>As for Woods, the SuperBook has a proposition asking exactly how many majors Tiger will win this year. With “zero” off the book following his historic victory in Augusta, the remaining odds are exactly one (1/4), exactly two (3/1), exactly three (20/1), and the grand slam (80/1).</p>
