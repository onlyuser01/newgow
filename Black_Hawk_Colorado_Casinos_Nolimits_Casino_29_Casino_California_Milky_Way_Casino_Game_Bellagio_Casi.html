<p>The established studio developer has released its latest blockbuster video slot in a bid to offer players even more innovative features and satisfying experiences</p>
<p>As a result, players will get to enjoy Bison Blocks, Stakelogic’s latest crack at the video slot industry, and a game that is loaded with cool features to make sure you are having the best possible experience.</p>

<p>The slot includes gameplay mechanics such as Cascades, Free Spins, Multipliers, and Wilds, and it is also an opportunity for players to trigger any of the 4,096 paylines to secure a win. The Cascade Feature is one of the biggest tickets here as players will have all losing symbols removed with new symbols dropping in instead.</p>
<p>The new game was welcomed by Stakelogic product owner Andrew Fraser who hailed the new release and the many excellent features that it includes:</p>
<p>Bison Blocks takes players on an incredible adventure where they join these remarkable beasts in search of big wins. They are helped in joining the herd by the great selection of bonus features built into the game including Cascades, Wilds, Free Spins and Multipliers. Stakelogic product owner Andrew Fraser</p>
<p>If a new win occurs, the reels will Cascade again, making it so that you can enjoy even better returns. The Multipliers in the game are increased by 1x for every win that you realize. There is a big win potential in the game with the Expand Feature pushing the reels to a 6×6 grid and format and adjusting the paylines from 4,096 to the whopping 46,656.</p>
<p>The features that you can discover in Bison Blocks do not end there, as you can further try the Free Spins bonus, which will be triggered through Scatters and feature 10 Free Spins, or even more, depending on how many Scatters you land on the reels.</p>

<p>Players may also scoop up to 12 Free Spins, 14 Free Spins or even 16 Free Spins if they end up hitting six Scatters when they are triggering the bonus level.</p>
