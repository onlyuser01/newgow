    <h1>Casino Oklahoma Texas Border Durango Station Casino Jobs Harrah S Resort Casino Lake Charles Casino</h1>

<p>Unfortunately, this truly is stated in the casino's bonus terms. Please, see here:</p>
<p>"l. Withdrawals are not permitted for an amount less than that of the bonus.</p>
<p>m. Upon requesting any withdrawal (regardless of the number of deposits), any amount up to the equivalent value of the deposit bonus will be deducted from your balance or winnings prior to settlement. For example, if you deposit $/€ 500 and receive a $/€ 250 bonus after meeting all wagering requirements, and you wish to withdraw your funds, a request needs to be made for an amount less your bonus amount received."</p>
<p>This type of bonus is called a "sticky" bonus, which means that upon withdrawing your winnings accumulated with this bonus, the initial bonus value will be deducted from the whole amount of winnings. Many casinos offer sticky bonuses and I am afraid that this is not something we could penalize the casino for, nor can we force them to process your withdrawal, if you do not have enough funds in your account.</p>
<p>Please, let me know if there is anything else I could help you with.</p>
