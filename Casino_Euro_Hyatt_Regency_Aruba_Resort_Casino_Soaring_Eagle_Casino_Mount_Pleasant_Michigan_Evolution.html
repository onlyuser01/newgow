    <h1>Casino Euro Hyatt Regency Aruba Resort Casino Soaring Eagle Casino Mount Pleasant Michigan Evolution</h1>

<p>LeoVegas, a prominent operator of online casino brands, has received another content boost through a partnership with RubyPlay, an established B2B iGaming developer and supplier. Thanks to this new arrangement, LeoVegas players will have access to an advanced selection of cutting-edge slot games provided by the studio, the companies shared in a press release via email.</p>
<p>RubyPlay has a number of dynamic titles that it will bring across the operator group’s brands, not only the namesake LeoVegas, but also Royal Panda, another prominent casino that is owned by LeoVegas Group. The integration will be facilitated through Relax Gaming’s content aggregation platform.</p>
<p>As a result, players will be able to get their hands on Shake Shake Money Tree,Diamond Explosion 7s, and Royal Griffin. The games will be available in all markets that the online operator has a legal right to operate in, with the bulk of such markets in Europe, the United Kingdom, and beyond.</p>
<p>LeoVegas is hopeful that it will be able to successfully leverage RubyPlay’s portfolio to strike home with existing and new audiences and deliver on innovative game concepts such as social casino mechanics. All in all, RubyPlay promotes its portfolio as heavily focused on immersive slot experiences that are designed to elicit stronger engagement and retention.</p>
<p>RubyPlay Trevor Ginsberg welcomed the chance to team up with LeoVegas Group and its brands. Ginsberg hailed LeoVegas’ reach and presence in regulated markets, which is precisely what RubyPlay hopes to improve by way of expanding with strong local brands, but also spoke of the significance of the deal.</p>
<p>"Such a deal reflects the calibre of games we produce at RubyPlay, designed and developed by a hugely experienced team that is adept at using its insight to craft the game experiences that players want," Ginsberg explained. RubyPlay is now focused on growing its player base in a meaningful and sustainable way which will be its objective in the coming months.</p>
<p>This can be achieved as part of a multi-pronged approach which involves partnerships with prominent operators but also the creation of innovative, unique, and player-focused content. RubyPlay similarly teamed with PokerStars recently to deliver its games with the operator’s fast-developing online casino arm.</p>
