    <h1>Coney Island Casino Caesars Casino Locations Sweepstakes Casino Arizona Charlie S Casino Viejas Casi</h1>

<p>Dear 77Spins Casino team,</p>
<p>Thank you for the additional explanation.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you provided us only with general information without any details. It is clear that there is a system that is able to detect if something is wrong. However, it is not clear what exactly was wrong in this particular case and with the provided documents, and how the system can recognize anything wrong from photos.</p>
<p>Can you please confirm that the player shared only photos of his documents with the casino? Does the casino use any application or software to detect such things?</p>
<p>What exact document is problematic and why? What requirements were not met? What should be done on the player's side to pass the KYC, please?</p>
<p>You recommended the player send his documents via live chat to the casino's support team, which should have guided him through the process and provided any necessary instructions. As we can see, it looks like it was done, documents were provided, but the player was not given any further instructions or details.</p>
<p>As was mentioned before, feel free to use my email to share the necessary information with us (branislav.b@casino.guru).</p>
<p>Dear Rudra2310,</p>
<p>Thank you for your emails and the provided photos/documents.</p>
<p>Do I understand correctly that you sent to the casino customer support the same documents as before?</p>
<p>If yes, are you please aware that it does not make sense to provide the casino with the same documents since they were already rejected before? Do you have an option to provide the casino with new documents (apart from the photos of your national ID)?</p>
<p>I found the information that it is possible to generate an energy bill on the Internet according to the IVRS number. Why didn't you send the original .pdf document to the casino instead of printing it and taking a photo of it? The same question is appropriate also for your bank statement - why did you send a photo of it instead of sending the original generated and downloaded document? (It could raise a suspicion that it was edited)</p>
<p>As for the discrepancies, I can see the address is not completely the same on all of the documents. Can you please explain it?</p>
<p>To be honest, I cannot see the complete address of residence in the screenshot of your personal information (in the casino account profile) because it is incomplete there. Therefore, it is not possible to compare it with the address on your documents. The casino should see it, but it is not possible for me from the screenshot.</p>
<p>In addition, it is industry standard that documents have to be completely visible in the photos, with all their corners and edges. I noticed that one of your documents (energy bill) does not meet this requirement.</p>
<p>However, since we have no option to verify the authenticity of the documents and the casino has not provided us with any additional details, provided that you insist your documents are really genuine and accurate, are you please able to submit a complaint to the casino's ADR or directly to MGA, which have better options to investigate the matter?</p>
<p>It is possible to find more in the casino's Terms and Conditions - HERE, section 26.</p>
