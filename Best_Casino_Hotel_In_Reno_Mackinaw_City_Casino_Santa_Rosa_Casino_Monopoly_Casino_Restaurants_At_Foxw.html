    <h1>Best Casino Hotel In Reno Mackinaw City Casino Santa Rosa Casino Monopoly Casino Restaurants At Foxw</h1>

<p>Last month, the famous porn star and influencer, Lana Rhoades, started her own NFT project. Promising a lucrative investment, the project raised some $1.5 million. It was all going well until Rhoades dumped the project and disappeared with the money in what turned out to be another NFT scam, a new report reveals.</p>
<p>NFT Project Turns to Rug Pull</p>
<p>Coffeezilla, the famous YouTube investigator, released details regarding the elaborate scam in one of his recent videos. Rhoades’ lucrative project that turned out to be a scam was dubbed CryptoSis. The project started last month and it featured NFTs of cartoony images of the porn star. But Rhoades herself put in some effort to sell the project to her audience. According to her, the project was created with a goal to increase value for the NFT holders making it “a lucrative investment.” Moreover, Rhoades promised the holders to “sell for more than they paid to mint.”</p>
<p>While that doesn’t sound quite convincing for some, others don’t need a lot to spend some money on an NFT. What is more, in a second post on social media, Rhoades claimed that the project isn’t just a one-time thing. She outlined that other models have also “signed to create their own collections.” The lucrative project was also compared to an “NFT franchise” and Rhoades explained that the brand itself and the value will continuously grow. Rhoades’ NFT project also featured a roadmap, promising various incentives once sales hit a specific percentage.</p>
<p>Not Everything That Starts Well Ends Well</p>
<p>In an unfortunate turn of events, at least for the users who purchased Rhoades’ NFTs, not even a week after the $1.5 million was raised, she disappeared from the digital landscape. Cashing out the amount in Ethereum, the famous porn star claimed that the community became negative and rude toward her.</p>
<p>While some of the people who fell for the elaborate scam only lost money, one will certainly remember the project forever. Yes, one of the many people who decided to invest in Rhoades’ NFTs even tattooed the logo of the project on them before the scam was uncovered.</p>
<p>Comments on Reddit regarding the topic vary. Some users asked if the porn star would get arrested, while others simply laugh at the people who fell for the latest rug pull. One user, nicknamed Salt_Vault_7 said that regret is beautiful. Moreover, they questioned whether people are aware that NFTs are not a part of a blockchain. According to that user, those NFTs are simply “worthless barcode pics.”</p>
<p>Currently, Rhoades’ Twitter account has 1.5 million followers. The famous influencer hasn’t posted since Sunday and in her recent Tweets, there’s no information regarding the NFT project. Still, her profile picture is the animated logo of the project itself.</p>
