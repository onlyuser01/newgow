<p>Juventus vs AS Roma is one of the biggest rivalries in Italian soccer. The teams aren’t local rivals (in fact, the distance between their home grounds is 400+ miles), nor do their fans hate each other. Nevertheless, this is still one of the biggest fixtures in Serie A. If you’re wondering why that is the case, it’s because both teams are considered real heavyweights of the top-flight of Italian soccer.</p>
<p>Juventus is by far the most successful Italian club, with 36 Serie A titles in the collection. AS Roma, on the other hand, have won the Italian league on two occasions, both of which were in the 20th century. Oddsmakers don’t think the 2022-23 season will be the one when AS Roma win their first title of the 21st century. Instead, they think Juventus will win their 10th title in 12 seasons.</p>
<p>The trouble is that Serie A is very competitive this season, meaning that there’s no room for error. The bad news for Juventus fans is that their boys have already made an error – they failed to beat Sampdoria on Monday.</p>
<p>The black-and-whites need to bounce back to the winning track ASAP, but will they be able to do it against AS Roma? To see what we think about it, just keep on reading our Serie A preview.</p>

<p>Injuries Causing Headaches to Juve Fans</p>
<p>Juventus played 0-0 with Sampdoria in Round 2 of the 2022-23 Serie A, which came as a surprise knowing that Juve destroyed Sassuolo 3-0 in the first round. They did make a fair share of chances but failed to hit the target each time.</p>
<p>A probable reason why this happened is that Juventus’ boss Massimo Allegri couldn’t count on a number of players. Seven players had to miss the game on Monday due to injuries, including several important playmakers – Paul Pogba, Angel Di Maria, and Federico Chiesa.</p>
<p>Some of these guys might return for the Roma game, but they won’t be 100% fit, that’s for sure. What this means is that the men whose job will be to create chances are newcomer Filip Kostic and wingback-turned-forward Juan Cuadrado.</p>
<p>Mourinho’s Boys Ready to Park the Bus</p>
<p>AS Roma have a 100% win record in the 2022-23 Serie A with wins over Salernitana and Cremonese, two teams that are among the biggest candidates for relegation. Jose Mourinho’s team won each of those by 1-0, which is strange as the odds on “over 2.5 goals” were shorter than -150 in both games.</p>
<p>It’s not that AS Roma players didn’t make enough chances in those games. On the contrary, they had plenty of goal opportunities. For instance, against Cremonese, they created 27 goal attempts. That’s more than Juventus players created in two games.</p>
<p>In Round 3, however, we don’t expect AS Roma to attack much. Instead, Mourinho is likely to go with a more defensive-minded strategy. He knows that his team is the underdog and that a draw would be seen as a major success.</p>
<p>Juventus vs AS Roma Prediction</p>
<p>This isn’t going to be a snooze fest, but we do think there won’t be too many goals in this game. As Roma are great at the back, while Juventus are missing several playmakers. That said, we wouldn’t be surprised if the game ended 0-0.</p>
<p>Picks: Juventus and AS Roma to draw; under 2.5 goals</p>
