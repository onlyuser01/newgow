<p>Caf, a global leader in the digital identity market, has agreed to support Eyas Gaming’s launch in Brazil. The former company will support the operator by verifying the age and identity of all players in Brazil, helping Eyas onboard players safely and responsibly.</p>
<p>Eyas Gaming is a Gauselmann Group-owned subsidiary that is entering Brazil with an iGaming brand. The operator’s parent company, meanwhile, is entering an exclusive partnership agreement with the Brazilian sports media company Lance! which will develop and operate the brand from its hubs in Malta and Gibraltar.</p>
<p>Caf’s role will be to probe into Eyas’ Brazilian customers and verify identity their ages. As companies committed to responsible gambling, Eyas Gaming and Lance! seek to protect gamblers from harm and will also provide players with various safer gaming tools.</p>
<p>As Brazil finally vowed to regulate sports betting, Eyas Gaming seeks to penetrate the local market, becoming a major local operator. The company considers this launch to be a great opportunity to establish a foothold in the LATAM region.</p>
<p>Eyas selected Caf because of its deep understanding of the Brazilian market. As a company founded in Brazil, Caf understands how Brazilian audiences tick and is familiar with the local regulations. Because of that, the digital identity leader was the perfect pick for Eyas.</p>
<p>Caf Is Thrilled to Help Eyas Modernize Brazilian Gaming</p>
<p>Caf’s managing director of international expansion, Emma Lindley, shared her excitement about the new agreement. She said that her team is happy to be partnering with the Gauselmann subsidiary in this crucial moment for Brazilian gaming.</p>
<p>As the government prepares to regulate sports betting in Brazil, gambling operators that can quickly and accurately identify customers and conduct age verification, provide a great user experience and fight fraud will become the market leaders. Emma Lindley, MD of international expansion, Caf</p>
<p>Lindley noted that the new Brazilian regulations put a big emphasis on safety. She concluded that the Brazilian market is still largely untapped which is why Eyas and Lance!’s initiative is so important.</p>
<p>Eyas Gaming’s head of fraud, risk and payments, Andrejs Cuzans, said that Caf’s help will be integral to making sure his company grows and evolves in Brazil.</p>
<p>This is an exciting time for the gambling market in Brazil and we could not have found a better partner as we establish a foothold and continue to grow here. Andrejs Cuzans, head of fraud, risk and payments, Eyas Gaming</p>
<p>Cuzans concluded that his team wants to make sure that Eyas’ products are only enjoyed responsibly by those legally allowed to gamble.</p>
