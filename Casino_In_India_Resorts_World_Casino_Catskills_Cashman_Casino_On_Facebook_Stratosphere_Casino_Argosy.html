<p>Wynn purchased the mansion, located at 1717 Enclave Court, in March of 2018 for $13 million. Property records show it was the most expensive home purchase in Las Vegas that year.</p>
<p>The home, dubbed “Museo,” is in the prestigious TPC Summerlin private golf community. According to the real estate listing, the property recently underwent a $16 million renovation.</p>
<p>The 1.5-acre residence features six bedrooms and 10 baths, a four-car parking garage, and 13,500 square feet of living space. It comes unfurnished.</p>
<p>Leaving Las Vegas</p>
<p>Wynn, 78, has distanced himself from Nevada and the gaming industry since the 2018 sexual misconduct allegations ended his career. In March of 2018, he resigned as chairman and CEO and sold his entire stake in the company that bears his name for $2.14 billion.</p>
<p>Wynn was also evicted from his 6,233-square-foot villa duplex at Wynn Las Vegas, which prompted his purchase of Museo. Wynn’s neighbors in the TPC Summerlin community include magician David Copperfield and Las Vegas Sands billionaire Sheldon Adelson — Nevada’s richest resident, with a fortune of some $30 billion.</p>
<p>Now, it appears the man often credited for helping Las Vegas trend towards a more luxurious and high-end market no longer needs a place to call home in Southern Nevada. Over the past two years, Wynn has spent much time on his $215 million, 92-meter super-yacht “Aquarius.” He has been spotted in the Bahamas, Miami, and Monte Carlo.</p>
<p>The yacht has reportedly been for sale since last fall and can be chartered for the weekly rate of $1.5 million.</p>
<p>Wynn is now said to be living in Florida at the $43 million beachfront mansion he purchased in August of 2019. Palm Beach County records show Wynn as the owner of 1960 S. Ocean Boulevard in Lantana.</p>
<p>Wynn’s Florida residence is just a short drive north to President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago Club, often referred to as Trump’s Winter White House. Prior to his scandal, Wynn was a supporter of the Republican Party and was vice-chairman of Trump’s inauguration committee.</p>
<p>Wynn was the finance chairman of the Republican National Committee when his public reputation was forever damaged.</p>
<p>The Billionaire’s Backstory</p>
<p>Wynn’s listing agent Ivan Sher says Museo “is one of the finest homes available in the country.” It also naturally comes with a large tax bill. According to Clark County property records, 1717 Enclave Court has annual property taxes of $67,471.</p>
<p>Of course, only the wealthiest Nevadans can afford to pay such a tax bill. Before Wynn acquired the mansion, it was home to Station Casinos billionaire Lorenzo Fertitta and his wife, Teresa, from 1995-1997. Steve Wynn’s brother Kenny Wynn and his wife Dale owned the house from 1998 until 2005.</p>
<p>Federal authorities served a search warrant on Kenny Wynn in 2004 at the home in connection with a child pornography investigation. However, he was never charged with any crime.</p>
