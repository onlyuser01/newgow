    <h1>Hotels Close To Maryland Live Casino Fantasy Casino Indio Casino Hollywood Florida Kino Casino Cash</h1>

<p>Hi Petronela, I'll answer you without problems and I hope my words are not filtered, in order of question:</p>
<p>1) before making the withdrawal "request" my account was not verified - this already seemed very strange to me - I "simulated" the operation and realized that I could perform it even though I had not sent them my documents acknowledgment, at that point I was the same to contact the live chat pointing out to the guy who replied that their system allowed me to "withdraw" without ever having received the documents from me immediately after I told him that I could attach them, or the same in live chat or by email (if he had given me a reference) but as if the problem was not his the guy in the live chat reassured me by telling me that I did not have to send my identification document and if it was needed I would have been asked directly by their "highly efficient" financial sector .... at that point, alas, I already understood that I would never have collected the winnings.</p>
<p>2) as far as the matter of winnings linked or not to welcome bonuses or other types of bonuses is very simple my answer; the winnings were made only and exclusively with real balance as I have never accepted neither welcome bonus nor other bonuses on subsequent top-ups just to avoid being stuck in possible infinite turns waiting to transform the bonus balance into real balance ... but as I am telling you I was screwed anyway as they never paid me anyway</p>
<p>3) regarding the last question you asked me or the fact of receiving explanations regarding the cancellation of my withdrawal requests, I can only say that after endless waits, i.e. 5 working days, the financial sector contacts me and tells me that my bank had not accepted their request to pay me the money.</p>
