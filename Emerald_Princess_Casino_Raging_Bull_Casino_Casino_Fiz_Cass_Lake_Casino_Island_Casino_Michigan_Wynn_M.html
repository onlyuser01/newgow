<p>Wynn Macau Limited, the company that operates and owns Wynn Macau, announced a key leadership change.</p>
<p>Ian Michael Coughlan to Step Down from His Position Next Year</p>
<p>The company announced today that its current president, Ian Michael Coughlan decided to step down from his position. The change is effective as of March 1, 2023, the day after Coughlan’s employment agreement with Wynn Macau concludes. After that date, he will remain with the company, but transition from an executive director to a non-executive director position.</p>
<p>Coughlan is expected to take that position until the company’s annual general meeting planned for May 2023. Then, he will remain with the company but serve as an advisor for the remainder of 2023. With that in mind, Ms. Linda Chen, Wynn Macau’s current vice-chairman, executive director and chief operating officer, will take over Coughlan’s position, effective from March 1, 2023.</p>
<p>“The president of the Company will be changed from Mr. Coughlan to Ms. Linda Chen,” reads a statement released by Wynn Macau</p>
<p>According to Wynn Macau, Coughlan did not disagree with the Board’s decision. Additionally, the company said that “no matter relating to these changes that needs to be brought to the attention of the shareholders of the Company or the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited.”</p>
<p>Coughlan Has a Track Record with More than 40 Years of Experience</p>
<p>Overall, Coughlan has a track record of more than 40 years within the hospitality industry. He has held key leadership positions in leading resorts and hotels in the United States, Europe, as well as Asia. During his tenure at Wynn, Coughlan was responsible for overseeing the strategic development, business and operations of both Wynn Palace and Wynn Macau. Besides being president and executive director, he has also held the position of director of hotel operations – worldwide for Wynn Resorts.</p>
<p>“Ian’s pioneering leadership, which spans the vast majority of our incredibly successful time in Macau, has been impressive and his unrelenting commitment to brand excellence and establishing our deep-rooted culture is equally remarkable.” Craig Billings, CEO at Wynn Resorts</p>
<p>Sharing his excitement, Craig Billings, Wynn Resorts’ CEO, acknowledged that Coughlan brought remarkable success to the company thanks to his leadership skills. He added that having Coughlan as an advisor of the company is pleasing. On the other hand, speaking about Chen’s planned appointment, Billings revealed that she will collaborate with Coughlan “to ensure a smooth transition.” Last but not least, he said that he is looking forward to working closely with Chen and the company’s dedicated team of professionals.</p>
