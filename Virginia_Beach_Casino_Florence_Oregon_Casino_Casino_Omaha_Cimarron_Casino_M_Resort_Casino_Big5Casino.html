<p>Dear Customer,</p>
<p>Thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>After checking your account we can see that on 30th of August 2020, mandatory 30 days for your account to be verified have passed. Allow me to inform you that, as per our Terms and Conditions, your withdrawal request has been declined and your winnings have been transferred to your balance. Since on 18th of March 2020 you accepted a no deposit bonus, there were still some wagering requirements left in the moment of transferring the winnings from declined withdrawal request to your balance. However we have cleared them for you and you were able to request new withdrawal in the amount of €700.</p>
<p>Regarding your statement that you do not see how to cancel payment request, please see the picture and short explanation below:</p>
<p>If you'd like to request a new withdrawal while you have a pending one already, you can click on the button "withdrawal" in the top right corner on your account and you will get a display you can see above in the picture. After the display appears, all you have to do is click on the button "cancel withdrawal".</p>
<p>In your previous replies you have also stated that you could not request withdrawal of your balance, since you have not met the bonus conditions. This actually is our buy off option. It allows you to withdraw the percentage of the wagered bonus. For example, if you fulfilled 20% of your wagering requirements, you can request a payout over 20% of your balance, but please keep in mind that the minimum withdrawal amount is €20.</p>
<p>After checking your account we can see that your account is now verified, all documentation that you have sent us has been reviewed and this process is done for the time being. This has been done on 4th of September. Following your account verification, your withdrawal in the amount of €700 was also approved and done on 7th of September. You should receive it shortly.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Complaints Team</p>
