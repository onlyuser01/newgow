    <h1>Bet777 Eu Casino Casino Wallpaper Hoover Dam Casino Uk Online Casino Ice Casino Alberta Says UFC Bet</h1>

<p>Alberta is making a U-turn on its ban on UFC betting as an investigation into coach James Krause and fighters that trained under him has been moving forward. This has prompted Alberta Gaming, Liquor and Cannabis (AGLC) to reintroduce wagering on the competition a week after it suspended it, ESPN reported, citing PlayAlberta.ca.</p>
<p>Alberta Reintroduces UFC Betting Markets after Pause</p>
<p>AGLC moved in unison with Ontario at the beginning of December when both regulators deemed the UFC to have failed to apply the necessary internal guidelines to prevent insiders from wagering on fights akin to what many have described as match-fixing. In the latest ruling, AGLC believes that there have been amendments, although it would continue to monitor the situation.</p>
<p>The UFC moved fairly quickly with its response to the scandal involving Darrick Minner, Shayilan Nuerdanbieke, and James Krause who have been accused of fixing games. Krause, who is a coach in the UFC, had his license suspended on December 2, and is unlikely to return any time soon if at all. The Nevada Athletic Commission confirmed that any fighters who wish to train under Krause will not be allowed into UFC events.</p>
<p>Minner and Nuerdanbieke are not off the hook even though Krause seems to be the one who would bear the brunt of the investigation. Alberta and Ontario decided to suspend gambling on the UFC in each province on December 2 as well, but Ontario has so far not lifted the suspension.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement, the state regulator, told sportsbooks back in November that they should not accept wagers on any events that Krause was involved in. This is the first high-profile match-fixing scandal to involve an organization on a deeper level rather than individual players since sports betting was legalized in the United States in 2018.</p>
