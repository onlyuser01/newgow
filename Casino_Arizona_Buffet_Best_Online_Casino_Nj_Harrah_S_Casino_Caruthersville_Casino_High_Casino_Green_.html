<p>John Chasoulidis Abela and Anatoly Rossinsky are stepping in as part of the Green Jade team to help the company reinforce its signature style gaming products in licensed markets.</p>
<p>The Right Hires at the Right Time</p>
<p>Green Jade Games has expanded its lineup of talent with the appointment of John Chasoulidis Abela and Anatoly Rossinsky, who are stepping in the roles of studio manager and senior DevOps manager, respectively.</p>
<p>The pair will be instrumental in assisting the company with its further growth in targeted markets worldwide, the press release states. Chasoulidis Abela has an extensive background in video game development and has created over 150 mobile and web game products.</p>
<p>He founded his own studio when he was only 21 and later joined iGaming as part of Yggdrasil Gaming’s team. In his new role as studio manager, he will help develop Green Jade’s Innovation Hub and offer advice on the design and development of skill-based arcade games and innovative slot titles.</p>
<p>Chasoulidis Abela will work on boosting awareness for Green Jade’s products by introducing cutting-edge features and innovation. Rossinsky, on the other hand, has ten years of experience as part of the banking and e-commerce industry.</p>
<p>Strengthening Talent to Boost Player Experience</p>
<p>In his role, he will seek to boost platform functionality and assist Green Jade in developing a superior player experience. Commenting on the news, Green Jade Games CEO Ben McDonagh welcomed both hires, arguing that the company continues to build by bringing the brightest minds and creative talents on board.</p>
<p>“Green Jade has been riding an incredible growth trajectory in recent months thanks in part to the ground-breaking content we have produced. With John and Anatoly on board, we will be able to push even more boundaries and deliver the next generation of casino games to operators and players,” McDonagh added.</p>
<p>Arcade Skill-Based Gaming Is the Future</p>
<p>Chasoulidis Abela was equally excited to have the opportunity to be part of Green Jade’s growing team. “I am looking forward to applying my experience in traditional video and mobile games to what Green Jade is trying to achieve with its casino and skill-based arcade games,” he added.</p>
<p>His insight into arcade and skill-based games is particularly important to the company. In Chasoulidis Abela’s words, skill-based gaming is the future of the industry, and Green Jade is touted as a leader in the segment.</p>
<p>There are some exciting games in the pipeline, the new studio manager assured.</p>
