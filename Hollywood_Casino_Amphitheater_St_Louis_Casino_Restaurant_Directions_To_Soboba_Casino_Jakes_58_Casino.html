    <h1>Hollywood Casino Amphitheater St Louis Casino Restaurant Directions To Soboba Casino Jakes 58 Casino</h1>

<p>Quapaw Nation’s 3 rd casino in Arkansas went through a soft launch over the weekend</p>
<p>The soft launch ran over the weekend, including Friday</p>
<p>Quapaw’s main gambling resort project will sprawl on 80,000 sq ft, and open by the end of 2020</p>
<p>The third Quapaw Nation casino project in Arkansas had a surprise soft launch on Friday, September 29 ahead of a planned official launch on October 1.</p>
<p>Arkansas’ Third Quapaw Casino Had a Soft Launch on Friday</p>
<p>The tribal Saracen Casino Annex casino had a soft launch on Friday, several days before its planned grand opening on Tuesday, October 1. The Pine Bluff–located property launched at 6 PM local time and invited guests to a fully-functioning bar and 300 slot machines.</p>
<p>With 15,000 square feet of gaming space, the casino constitutes the third property in the state owned by the tribe. The casino is connected to the Saracen Q Store, highlighting the owners’ emphasis on great conversion.</p>
<p>The Friday launch continued five hours and the property was again open on Saturday at 8 AM with the Annex running until 6 PM in the afternoon. On Sunday, September 29, the casino opened at 8 AM and stayed open until midnight.</p>
<p>Quapaw Tribe Happy with the Results</p>
<p>Run and operated by the Quapaw Tribe, the owners were happy with the launch. The property itself is designed as a Las Vegas casino with the hopes that Arkansans newly-regulated industry will gain momentum quickly. No small part in the rapid expansion is the first-come-first-serve mentality that many big brands have about breaking into new gaming markets.</p>
<p>After a state-wide regulatory approval, gaming has become a new economic vertical in the state. The Quapaw Tribe gained an approval for its latest property three months ago with the Arkansas Racing Commissiongiving green light to the project.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Quapaw Tribe spokesperson Carlton Saffa said that the 300 gaming machines showcased over the weekend were just a glimpse of the main gaming resort. Saffa said that originally, the casino’s soft launch was planned as an invitation-only affair, but later on the company changed their opinion:</p>
<p>We made a decision today we would give a sneak peek to the city. We had intended for tonight to be a soft opening to folks we traded with, that we’d done business with. But then we decided, you know what, folks are so excited so let’s let them all in.</p>
<p>A Full-Scale Project Good for the Economy</p>
<p>The full-scale model will have to wait a bit, however, as the project will sprawl on 80,000 square feet and take until the end of 2020 before it can be announced live.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the casino has proved an important source for construction jobs for the region. Based on Saffa’s statement, the main gambling resort will generate a total of 1,000 construction jobs before the project is completed.</p>
<p>Overall, the Quapaw Nation invested $240 million into the Pine Bluff property. The other casino properties that Quapaw owns are the Quapaw Casino and the Downstream Casino Resort.</p>
