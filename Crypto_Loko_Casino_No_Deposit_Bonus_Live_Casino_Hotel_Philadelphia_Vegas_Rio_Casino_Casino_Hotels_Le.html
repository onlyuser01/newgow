    <h1>Crypto Loko Casino No Deposit Bonus Live Casino Hotel Philadelphia Vegas Rio Casino Casino Hotels Le</h1>

<p>The trusted partner to the global betting industry for the past three and a half decades has joined hands with the company recognized for ongoing innovation and industry excellence to supply the African market with a combination of their market-leading Numbers products.</p>
<p>According to the terms of the new deal, Sports Information Services (SIS) will work together with Kiron Interactive and leverage its expertise to provide a fully customized channel that would cater to the needs of markets on the continent. This way, the Numbers content of both companies is expected to extend their profile by reaching a larger plethora of players and operators in Africa.</p>
<p>SIS’ renowned 49’s Original Live Draw and their fresh high-margin 39’s draw games with high-frequency, live draws that take place every five minutes will also become available for players interested in winning big while taking a small risk.</p>
<p>The news of the new deal is just the latest from a long list of similar announcements made by SIS for the African continent. Together, the new partnerships emphasize the continuously rising demand for SIS’ 24-hour live betting offerings. At the same time, the new deals are expected to help SIS strengthen its foothold across the regulated markets in the region.</p>
<p>SIS’s head of sales for Africa, Joe Andrews, spoke about the importance of finding the “right partners in regions with a disparate makeup,” giving Africa as an example of an essential area where the company must maintain its brand development. Andrews also spoke about Kiron’s “heritage across the continent” which is expected to give SIS a great advantage in creating and launching the new channel.</p>
<p>Collaborating with SIS, “Key” for Kiron Interactive</p>
<p>Also commenting on the newly sealed partnership agreement, Kiron Interactive’s co-chief executive officer Steven Spartinos explained the critical need to work together with leading brands like SIS to keep delivering unparalleled customer experience while putting people at the heart of what they do. Spartinos called the new collaboration “key” for their efforts to keep expanding their reach and broadening their service scope.</p>
<p>The company with headquarters in Johannesburg, Gauteng, South Africa, also explained that while its operations are run globally, Africa “is where our roots lie.” Accordingly, they aim to provide “unrivaled insight into the many diverse markets here.”</p>
<p>In 2022, Kiron Interactive took home the EGR Business to Business Best Virtual Sports Supplier award. Kiron’s portfolio currently consists of 51 virtual games, placing the company in a leading position in the industry.</p>
<p>In January 2023, Pariplay announced it would expand its Fusion Aggregator Platform with the help of Kiron Interactive. During the same month, SIS teamed up with BetConstruct to provide racing content while announcing it would bring esports products to the Colorado market.</p>
