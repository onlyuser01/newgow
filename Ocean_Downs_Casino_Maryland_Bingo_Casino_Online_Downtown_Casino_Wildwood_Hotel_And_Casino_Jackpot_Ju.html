    <h1>Ocean Downs Casino Maryland Bingo Casino Online Downtown Casino Wildwood Hotel And Casino Jackpot Ju</h1>

<p>The Yerevan and Barcelona-based supplier of quality games for the online casino industry, Peter &amp; Sons, has revealed a new partnership with leading Remote Game Server platform and solutions provider Tequity Ventures.</p>
<p>This collaboration will allow Peter &amp; Sons to significantly reduce the time it takes to market, deploy, and experience games, with audiences and operators having a reliable way to tap into the latest releases by the award-winning studio.</p>
<p>The integration is part of a busy roadmap for Peter &amp; Sons, with the supplier poised to announce more new developments over the coming weeks and months, and company Commercial Director and Founder, Yann Bautista, commenting that this new tie-up would help shape the future of the iGaming industry as a whole.</p>
<p>Tequity Ventures has been deploying solutions that are tailored to specifically make it easier for leading studios to bring their products to market and introduce them to audiences. Tequity provides businesses with the opportunity to leverage a variety of software modules that are created to handle complex applications – such as cutting-edge games.</p>
<p>Thanks to the company’s RGS platform, players get to experience titles in the most efficient, optimized, and streamlined manner possible, not having to worry about delays or performance snafus.</p>
<p>Tequity Ventures Chief Technology Officer Krzysztof Opałka was similarly pleased with the opportunity to see Peter &amp; Sons become the latest company to join the platform and benefit from its range of innovative technological solutions.</p>
<p>"Our rock-solid technology will help them with the seamless distribution of their innovative games," Opałka said. Peter &amp; Sons has been determined to make a name for itself. The company secured financial backing from SkillOnNet earlier this year, giving it a proper boost to continue innovating its portfolio and deliver more worthwhile games.</p>
<p>Apart from building exceptional content, Peter &amp; Sons has been clearly committed to making sure that its innovative games are known to audiences worldwide. To this end, the studio has partnered with several content aggregators and joined their distribution programs, including Relax Gaming and Hub88.</p>
<p>Peter &amp; Sons is the author of a string of exciting and innovative titles that have bucked the trend in iGaming and helped not only pinpoint the studio’s name on the industry’s radar, but also brought around innovation with products such as Peter Hunter, Abra Cadabra, Thunder Hawk, Book of Books, and more.</p>
