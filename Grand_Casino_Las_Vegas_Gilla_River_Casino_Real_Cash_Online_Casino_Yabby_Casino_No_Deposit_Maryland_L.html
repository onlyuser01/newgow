<p>IGT Allowed EveryMatrix to Use Some of Its Proprietary Game Features</p>
<p>EveryMatrix, a B2B iGaming software provider, has signed a new patent license deal with the multinational gambling tech company International Game Technology (IGT).</p>
<p>EveryMatrix Signs a Deal with IGT</p>
<p>Thanks to the agreement, EveryMatrix will expand its footprint in North America. As per the deal, the provider can now distribute games that incorporate IGT’s proprietary game features. This includes game features patented by IGT’s licensing program members as well.</p>
<p>IGT and its partners have produced numerous technologies that help iGaming titles differentiate themselves from other games in the sector. The agreement will allow EveryMatrix to supply any games that include some of these innovative new tools and technologies.</p>
<p>The deal aligns with EveryMatrix’s plans to double down on its efforts in North America and the United States in particular – a key market that is the center of the company’s focus.</p>
<p>IGT Welcomed EveryMatrix to the Game Feature Licensing Program</p>
<p>IGT was delighted to provide EveryMatrix with its solutions. Stephen Calogero, IGT’s vice president and deputy general counsel of global gaming and intellectual property, spoke about the deal. He said that his company welcomes EveryMatrix as a partner:</p>
<p>We are pleased to add EveryMatrix as a member of the game features licensing program which has fostered unprecedented innovation for game mechanics across the industry. Stephen Calogero, IGT</p>
<p>Erik Nyman, EveryMatrix’s president for the Americas, referred to the deal as an “important milestone” for the company. He is sure that this is an important step for the popularization of EveryMatrix’s offerings in the region.</p>
<p>Through this agreement, EveryMatrix will have access to IGT’s game feature patents, allowing us to distribute our gaming content to partners across North America. Erik Nyman, EveryMatrix</p>
<p>IGT Continues to Grow and Receive Recognition</p>
<p>IGT recently inked an agreement with the Australian global gaming content and technology company Aristocrat. The agreement allowed the two parties to cross-license key game server and game feature solutions.</p>
<p>In April, IGT received sports betting responsible gaming certification from the G4, becoming the first US supplier to get such accreditation. G4 praised IGT for its dedication to responsible gambling across all of its business verticals. Its chairman said that it is appreciative of the efforts.</p>
<p>IGT is currently fighting against the British Gambling Commission, which picked Allwyn as the new operator of the UK National Lottery. Because of the decision, the tech company claimed damages, saying that the regulator plays favorites. This mirrors Camelot’s move as the former National Lottery operator also critiqued the authority’s decision.</p>
