<p>Dear radeon5,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. Please understand that KYC is a very important and essential process, during which the casino makes sure that the money is sent to the rightful owner. None of the serious and licensed casinos takes KYC lightly, and I am afraid you will have to go through this process if you want to get your winnings.</p>
<p>Also, I would like to emphasize that KYC is not limited by any minimum amount of a withdrawal. If you wish to receive your winnings, Iâ€™d suggest cooperating fully with the casino.</p>
<p>I have checked the general terms and conditions, and this is what I found https://www.bsensation.com/#/:</p>
<p>"30.2 No withdrawal will be processed until users completed the KYC verification process.</p>
<p>30.3 Provided payments have been confirmed and users have successfully completed our KYC verification processes, funds can be withdrawn from account of users at any time ( except for the periods when the account is under additional inspection)."</p>
<p>"Company reserves right not to grant winnings to non-verified clients. If a potential or existing client either refuses to provide the information described above when requested, or appears to have intentionally provided misleading information, the company shall refuse to commence a service provision or relationship or proceed with the transaction requested."</p>
<p>Please let us know if this advice was helpful or we need to intervene. Looking forward to hearing from you.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
