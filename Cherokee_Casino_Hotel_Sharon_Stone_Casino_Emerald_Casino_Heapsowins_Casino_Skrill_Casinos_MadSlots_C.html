<p>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION</p>
<p>To Nick,</p>
<p>I had tried to include this information when submitting my complaint but some some reason was unable to upload it.</p>
<p>In addition to the timeline of communication I had over 40interactions with live help which, I am told by the Gambling Commission , MadSlots should have kept a record of.</p>
<p>To clarify, I had three methods of deposit registered on my account.</p>
<p>• A debit card</p>
<p>• Mobile phone (on a P.A.Y.G)</p>
<p>• Mobile phone ( on a monthly contract )</p>
<p>I made one deposit of £10 via the P.A.Y.G account. The rest of the deposits (approx £230)were charged via the number on contract. The bill is paid for by my daughter under her contract. She gifted me an iPad and a SIM card with said number</p>
<p>I received the first email on the 28 October requesting copies of said mobile bills. I contacted live help with full transparency and asked if this could be problematic. I was assured that it wouldn’t be a problem.I provided a copy of said bills via the upload document section on the site. These were subsequently rejected.</p>
<p>Next, came the request for my daughter’s I.D and full itemised phone bills showing said deposits and full postal addresses for both mobile bills. All of which were provided.</p>
<p>Then came the request for my I.D (see 31st Oct timeline).</p>
<p>I followed up in live help and during the chat I commented on the fact that I was extremely frustrated with the whole process. The constant requests for more information andunnecessary lengthy delays when responding to myqueries. Furthermore, the whole experience with MadSlots "done nothing to aid one’s mental health".</p>
<p>On the Saturday 4th November in the evening an ambulance pulled up outside and two paramedics knocked on my door. They asked for me by name and said they had had an anonymous call to 999 stating my full name and addressand that I had mental health problems and was "in crisis" and "on the edge". I was embarrassed at first and then I felt really angry because it felt somewhat sinister that someone completely unbeknownst to me had placed a call to emergency services reporting a "mental health crisis". For the record, I have no mental health issues. After demanding more information from the emergency services it transpired that the call was made by MadSlots Casino. This is a gross misuse of all my privacy protections surely ?</p>
<p>When I logged in on the following Monday 6th November the account was locked. So, to answer your question the account was locked sometime between the 2nd Nov – 6thNov. I went through to Live help(again) and asked why my account was locked and was told the relevant department would be in touch.</p>
<p>As you will see from my timeline of communication that was on the 7th Nov I received the email confirming account closure and referring to "comments I made" in live help.They had tried to contact me but was unsuccessful (liars) and therefore had taken the decision to close my account. They stated however, that it would not affect anywithdrawals being processed.</p>
<p>The rest of the information is contained in the Timeline of communication</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>
