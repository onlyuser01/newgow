    <h1>Slot Madness Casino Kansas City Casino Hotels Ignitiom Casino Two Kings Casino Golden Nugget Hotel C</h1>

<p>A week ago, Flutter appointed Lisa Sewell as its new chief people and operations officer. Today, the global gambling group has announced Fantasma Games’ freshest slot release will go live on its brands Paddy Power, Sky Bet, Poker Stars, and Betfair. The exclusive brand deal with Light &amp; Wonder will expire on August 2, when the game will become accessible to the wide public. Fnatasma games’ new slot is called Cloud Corsairs. The slot is a modern-day interpretation of the classic treasure hunt theme with pirates at the center and a surprising aeronautical twist.</p>

<p>Enter the Fantasy Land in the Skies and Grab the Riches</p>
<p>The popular developer of hit games like Flower Fortunes Megaways and Heroes Hunt Megaways invites players to hop on a new and unique adventure sparkled with pirates and fun treasure hunting. The slot comes with a surprising aeronautical twist that will carry gamers high up in the skies to a mesmerizing fantasy filled with riches. The developer added numerous bonus features to the slot with a 5×3 grid with a cool design. The Cloud Corsairs game also features a sixth Multiplier reel. All line wins during the base game are multiplied by up to x10. The same goes for line wins during the Free Spins bonus round.</p>
<p>Zeppelin Respins, Lightning Mystery, free PSins &amp; Super Free Spins</p>
<p>The feature is triggered by any line win that also includes the Zeppelin symbol. The respective symbol will then remain locked in place while the Respins will drop with several Multipliers. The Multipliers will be added to the reels every time an extra Zeppelin pops up. The game’s accumulated Multiplier can go as high as 50X.</p>
<p>Whenever six symbols except for the Zeppelin symbol are struck by lightning, the Lightning Mystery feature is triggered. During the Free Spins round, players enjoy even more exciting ways to wins, as the free spins pay both ways. To reach the Super Free Spins feature, players need to collect 15 bonus symbols in the Free Spin. There, they will enjoy 5 Super Charged Spins. The game also comes with a Buy Free Spins feature that lets players purchase free spins and skip straight to the end of the adventure in the sky.</p>
<p>Fantasma Games’ chief executive officer Fredrik Johansson expressed the company’s continuous ambition to “do something unique and interesting for the players and the operators.” The end product is called “slots beyond gambling” and Cloud Corsairs is a game that falls into this category as well. Johansson believes the game can turbo-charge players’ gaming experiences due to the wide array of progressive bonuses. Light &amp; Wonder’s director of partnerships Steve Mayes called Fantasma Games “a studio with tremendous momentum behind it.” In June, Fantasma Games went live on Loto-Québec through the Light &amp; Wonder platform.</p>
