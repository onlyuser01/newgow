<p>Terms and Conditions</p>
<p>The tournament starts on 26. 07. 2023 and ends on 31. 07. 2023 23:59 pm CEST.</p>
<p>The tournament is run by Casino Guru and sponsored by Relax Gaming. It’s not administered by any 3rd party company.</p>
<p>This is a free tournament, which means that there is no need to spend real money to join this competition.</p>
<p>In order to be eligible for this tournament, you must be a registered member of Casino Guru and be at least 18 years old (or you need to reach an age where online gambling in your jurisdiction is legal). Individuals under 18 years of age or under the age at which online gambling in their jurisdiction is legal are not allowed to enter this tournament.</p>
<p>Every individual that meets these conditions can join the tournament anytime throughout its duration. Each player gets a fixed number of spins upon entering the tournament, which can be used to collect points. Once the player uses up all of these spins, they must wait until the end of the tournament to learn the results. Players can't get additional spins. The player with the highest score will be the ultimate winner – followed by the player with the second highest score, etc.</p>
<p>The tournament prize pool is $80, and the prizes are awarded to the winning players in the following order:</p>
<p>1st place: $30 Amazon Voucher</p>
<p>2nd place: $20 Amazon Voucher</p>
<p>3-5th place: $10 Amazon Voucher</p>
<p>Casino Guru reserves the right to disqualify users who will create multiple accounts in order to increase their chances of winning.</p>
<p>It is not possible to exchange any of the prizes for cash. It is the winner’s responsibility to contact us on our email address community@casino.guru or through a Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/casino.guru.admin/) private message. If they fail to do so during the 7 days following the announcement of winners, they automatically lose their right to claim the prize and a new winner will be announced.</p>
<p>Only the English version of these Terms and Conditions is valid. The same applies to the tournament post description and any texts displayed on relevant images and pop up banners on the casino.guru website or our social media channels.</p>
<p>The prize cannot be won by Casino Guru employees and full-time consultants, even though it can be won by external casino testers.</p>
<p>These Terms and Conditions come into effect from 26. 07. 2023.</p>
