<p>AFC has signed an eight-year deal with Sportradar to become the organization’s official video and data distribution partner.</p>
<p>AFC Welcomes Sportradar as Official Data and Video Distribution Partner</p>
<p>Sportradar’s expertise in providing actionable sports data solution has landed the company another important partnership, this time as the official video and data distribution partner for the Asian Football Confederation (AFC).</p>
<p>The deal is signed for a period of eight years and kicks in 2021 through 2028, which will translate into Sportradar gathering and distributing match-related data and audio-visual content based on the performances of AFC national team and club tournaments.</p>
<p>Commenting on this development, Sportradar CEO Carsten Koerl said that he was proud to see this partnership with AFC through, lauding the organization as one of the pivots of Asian soccer.</p>
<p>Koerl was optimistic about the region’s outlook, noting that viewership for soccer in Asia has been growing and Sportradar had the opportunity to be a part of that.</p>
<p>Showcasing Services and Protecting Integrity</p>
<p>Thanks to this step, Sportradar will be able to “showcase a wider range of services,” Koerl added, leading to new opportunities with sports rights stakeholders throughout the region.</p>
<p>Sportradar is readying up to take on some important events, including the 2023 Asian Cup which will be hosted in China and the annual AFC Champions League, covering two competitive stretches from 2021 to 2024 and 2025 and 2028.</p>
<p>Sportradar is no stranger to the Asian market or the AFC per se. The pair first teamed up in 2013 and then renewed an integrity partnership in 2020, looking to eliminate match-fixing in Asia’s fast-developing soccer market and the concomitant threat of rigging games.</p>
<p>Sportradar has long sounded an alarm against match-fixing and has been working to tackle it globally. The company signed a partnership with numerous organizations across Latin America, where it deployed its Fraud Detection System with some success.</p>
<p>The company has undertaken several restructuring bids to ensure that it runs its global affairs better and can focus on providing a sterling service in all locales. For his part, AFC general secretary Dato Windsor John said that the organization was happy to welcome Sportradar as its official data and video distribution partner.</p>
<p>Sportradar is replacing Stats Perform which served as the official data partner to the AFC through 2020.</p>
