<p>Witnesses had last seen the victim on December 6 entering a car with Harnden</p>
<p>Professional basketball player Chance Comanche has been arrested over alleged participation in the murder of a young woman. According to the police, the 27-year-old athlete teamed up with his girlfriend, Sakari Harnden, to kill the victim.</p>
<p>The victim is Marayna Rodgers, a 23-year-old woman who was reported missing recently. The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department learned that Rodgers, a resident of Washington, was on a vacation to Las Vegas with a few friends. Witnesses said that they’d last seen her on December 6 entering a car with Harnden.</p>
<p>A day later she was reported missing, prompting detectives to suspect foul play. Following that, they obtained enough evidence to arrest Harnden and Comanche. The authorities then learned what they needed to find Rodgers’ remains. After a short search, the police discovered her body in the desert near Henderson, Nevada.</p>
<p>The police believe that the two culprits had followed a previously established plan to kidnap and murder Rodgers. The police also believe that Rodgers and Harnden used to be friends.</p>
<p>The Culprits Have Been Arrested</p>
<p>Comanche was arrested in California and temporarily placed in the Sacramento County jail. He is set to be transported to Nevada to stand trial. Harnden, on the other hand, was placed at Clark County Detention Center with a bail set at $500,000.</p>
<p>Following the arrests, Harnden was charged with kidnapping, theft and murder. No murder charge has been filed against Comanche but the local authorities said that the charges would be amended to open murder through coordination.</p>
<p>A lot of details about the murder are not yet clear and will likely be announced as the investigation progresses.</p>
