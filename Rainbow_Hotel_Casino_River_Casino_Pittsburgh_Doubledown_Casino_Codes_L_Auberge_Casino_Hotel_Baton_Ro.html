    <h1>Rainbow Hotel Casino River Casino Pittsburgh Doubledown Casino Codes L Auberge Casino Hotel Baton Ro</h1>

<p>i was playing 21 demons with a balance of over $700.00 betting $4.00. consistently without changing my bet at all then after 7 bets my money was gone.</p>
<p>I contacted support and there response was;</p>
<p>There are six Bets made with 100AUD then as the balance lowers you lower the bet as well, in our system it's not possible for that to happen automatically. There were no irregularities found.</p>
<p>They state no irregularities had been found but obvious irregularities would be when the bet went from $4 consistantly for a long time then all of a sudden jumps straight to the maximum bet of $100... another is the system indeed automatically lowers the bet to the next value that can be made so this information is incorrect. Also there was a bonus on the balance so betting $100 would be breaking t&amp;c min bet why would i risk losing all my winnings?</p>
<p>i just want my money back support wont respond at all</p>
