    <h1>Buffalo Thunder Resort Casino London Casino Chumba Casinos Com Comanche Red River Hotel Casino Doubl</h1>

<p>i made a profit of $1500, I submitted all documents and customer service said I was all good and my withdrawal will be processed in 24 hours, I woke up next day to an email saying I need to submit more documents as if 3 aren’t enough? the document they needed from me I had to wait 7-10 business days from my bank to get it to me. Anyway 7 business days is a while so me being me I cancel the withdrawal and played with it and lost it all. Now I’m not writing this because nightrush is a scam company and is fake, but because there are SOOOOO many better casinos that don’t do what they do. I submit 3 documents that’s not good enough, every other reliable online casino doesn’t ever even need 3 documents. And if they need 3 documents it’s important ones like ID and proof of address, not bullshit requests. My point is This casino doesn’t ask for multiple documents AFTER you request a withdrawal even though you’ve already submitted all you were suppose to before you requested, they ask for documents to delay the entire withdrawal process. I’ve played on many casinos and I can tell you there are sooo many more casinos that are way better than this. If you guys want a headache and the run around and to be stressed whether or not you’ll get your money or if you’ll even get it, then this company is just for you. Guys please read this review before you even think of depositing, on my dead grandfathers grave it’s the last thing you want to do. Stay away guys, casinos I recommend that aren’t very main stream but have paid out and are reliable are : pledoo, casinoin, betsafe and so on. But guys please stay away from this casino they don’t deserve our money and please don’t waste it on this site.</p>
