    <h1>Casino Sault Sainte Marie Si Casino Michigan Seattle Casinos Casino In Toronto Area Bellagio Casino</h1>

<p>I was giving a $20 free chip. The play through was 50x. The max I could win was $25.</p>
<p>when I attempted to withdraw I was told I needed to make a deposit of at least $25.</p>
<p>after asking several questions such as how long after making the deposit would my withdrawal be processed. I was told bitcoin withdrawals are processed instantly, the representative then informed me that I woukd receive my phones within minutes.</p>
<p>i also asked , if I made the deposit would I then be asked for anything additionally.</p>
<p>after asking a few additional questions and thinking about it for a day. I agreed to make the deposit.</p>
<p>i made the deposit and immediately attempted to withdraw the $50. My $25 deposit along with the $25 I had won.</p>
<p>I patiently waited for the funds. Again I saved all screenshots saved.</p>
<p>After a few hours I reached out to Lucky Owls chat. I was told it would be processed within four hours. I began to get aggravated since I was crystal clear prior to making the deposit. The representative was very short and eventually just disconnected my chat.</p>
<p>after getting back into chat another representative advised me that I needed to wait 10 hours. Since they had no folks available in finance over the weekend.</p>
<p>again something I was never told, even though I was originally told on a Saturday night my withdrawal would be processed within minutes.</p>
<p>its now after noon on Monday, I still have received my funds, my withdrawal is still pending.</p>
<p>At this point I want clients to understand that I’m dealing with a very dishonest casino.</p>
<p>it’s only $50, I made zero plays after maki g the deposit.</p>
<p>I made a decision to play at this casino based on the positive rating.</p>
<p>I hoping you can help and if not this will have a negative effect on the rating. Possibly swaying clients not to play at lucky owl.</p>
