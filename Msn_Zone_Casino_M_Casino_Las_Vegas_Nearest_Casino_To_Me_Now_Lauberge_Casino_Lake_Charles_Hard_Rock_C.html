    <h1>Msn Zone Casino M Casino Las Vegas Nearest Casino To Me Now Lauberge Casino Lake Charles Hard Rock C</h1>

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>Lalabet has failed to pay me. I requested a withdrawal of 1942 BRL, but after 10 days, when I checked back, I was informed that the payment had been cancelled. Strangely, the amount did not reflect back into my LALABET account. They claimed to have transferred the money to ASTROPAY. However, ASTROPAY denies receiving any such amount. As it stands, LALABET has effectively disappeared with my money and is refusing to make the payment.</p>
<p>Note: I have initiated transfers from LALABET to ASTROPAY on previous occasions without any issues. It was only when I requested a transfer of a larger amount did they fail to make the payment.</p>
<p>I tried to get a confirmation receipt or any proof that the amount was indeed delivered to ASTROPAY, but they outrightly refused to produce it. If they really did transfer my money to ASTROPAY, why can't they just provide the proof? Why are they refusing? The hard truth is that they have likely vanished with my money. They don't seem to have any intention of paying me back.</p>
<p>Lalabet didn't pay me. I requested a withdrawal of 1942 BRL, after 10 days I got in touch and they told me that the payment was cancelled, but the amount isn't showing in my LALABET account. They claim they sent the money to ASTROPAY, but ASTROPAY denies receiving any money. In short, LALABET seems to have disappeared with my money and they are refusing to pay me back.</p>
<p>Note: I've successfully requested transfers from LALABET to ASTROPAY multiple times in the past. However, when I asked for a larger amount, they failed to complete the transaction.</p>
<p>I asked them to provide proof that the amount was actually transferred to ASTROPAY, but they declined. If the transaction to ASTROPAY was actually made, why won't they provide the confirmation? They are refusing to do so and it seems very likely that they have run off with my money. They don't seem to want to pay me back.</p>
