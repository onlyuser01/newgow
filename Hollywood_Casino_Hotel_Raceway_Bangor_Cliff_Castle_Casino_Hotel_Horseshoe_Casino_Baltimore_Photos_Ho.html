The panel will be moderated by Betknowmore Head of External Affairs Matt Smith.</p>
<p>Then, SVP for American Regulatory, Affairs and Responsible Gambling, Entain Martin Lycka will take to the stage for the Martin Lycka's Safe Bet Show. The Player Protection Symposium will be wrapping up with a panel moderated by Responsible Gambling Council (RGC) CEO Shelley White who will be hosting the "Betting on sustainability: the rise of ESG in iGaming" with guests Entain Group Head of Safer Gambling and External Affairs Sophie Platts, BOS General Secretary Gustaf Hoffstedt, AGETARE AG Founder &amp; CEO Harald Pia and Deal Me Out CEO Jordan Lea.</p>
