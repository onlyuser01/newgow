    <h1>Casino Queen Hotel Casino Oklahoma Texas Border Silver Nugget Casino Event Center Park City Casino R</h1>

<p>Yes I have already sent in all documentation to verify who I am and my address. I have received 1 payout from them before but it was for much less, only a $100 or so maybe more. I was told all my info had been approved and even gave them a BTC address to send the payment as requested. I did everything necessary and provided all required documents. Despite all this and the Payment being approved this morning I was told inwas missing documents and ti Contact live chat for more info. Upon doing this I was informed that they wanted me to send in my proof of address document again even tho it was already approved before. I sent in the picture of a letter from the bank with my name and address again so we'll see what other things ive already gotten approved that they say they need again or other problems they come up with. It's crazy that bitstarz literally send my withdrawals within 5 min or less and this place has taken almost 2 months now. Quite ridiculous tbh. How are they even still in business is what I'd like to know..... and oddly it seems really easy to win on their multiple RTG casino sites almost too easy. Maybe that's their gimmick. Easy wins but never payout. Just seems like that system would fail after a short time but they keep on going somehow. Thx again for your help</p>
