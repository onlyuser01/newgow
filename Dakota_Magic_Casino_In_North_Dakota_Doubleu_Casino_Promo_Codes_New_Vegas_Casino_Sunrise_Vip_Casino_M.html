    <h1>Dakota Magic Casino In North Dakota Doubleu Casino Promo Codes New Vegas Casino Sunrise Vip Casino M</h1>

<p>Majestic Princess is no longer just a place to get away from the mainland. Starting earlier this week, the ship owned by Princess Cruises is also a place where you can place a wager in international waters. The inaugural wager was already made by Mark Wilson, the product strategy president for cruise &amp; tour for Arrivia, on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Ocean Sportsbook offers a real-time sports gambling experience and is now featured on the Princess Cruises ship as one of the many available recreational activities. Travelers will no longer have to miss out on the gambling action as they will be able to place a wager in real-time and be able to choose from a number of major sports and college football and basketball experiences.</p>
<p>There are numerous domestic and international sports covered in detail by the Ocean Sportsbook which may be unavailable when the Princess Cruises ship stops at a jurisdiction that has not yet regulated sports gambling.</p>
<p>Smooth Sailing for SportsBetting with Princess Cruises</p>
<p>This mostly applies to the MedallionClass app which will be available to guests on the ship whenever it’s in international waters or in jurisdictions that permit online gambling. Travelers will have the opportunity to bet on pre-game and future selections to make the most out of their experience.</p>
<p>The company estimates that there were $20 billion placed in wagers over the last two years meaning that sports betting is heading for new heights. By 2024, the industry is expected to reach $155 billion according to an ESPN story cited by Princess Cruises.</p>
<p>Ocean Sportsbook has been developed by Miomni, an established software developer, who worked on the ship’s mobile app and now makes the service available throughout all Princess MedallionClass ships. The Medallion app is also there to help guests with their overall stay and comfort onboard the Princess Cruises ships.</p>
