<p>Rivers Portsmouth, a Chicago-based Rush Street Gaming project, plans to open next year with seven eating and drinking establishments. The property’s marquee restaurant will be Admiral’s Steak &amp; Seafood, a fine-dining steakhouse serving a selection of prime cuts of meat and fresh seafood.</p>
<p>Mian, an Asian-inspired, made-to-order quick-service joint, will offer Chinese dishes such as General Tso’s chicken, fried rice, lo mein, and spring rolls. Slice Pizzeria is the go-to stop for a quick slice of pie.</p>
<p>The BetRivers Sportsbook will serve bar food, such as burgers and craft beer. Crossings Café is a full-service sit-down casual dining option with an extensive menu of American cuisine. The resort’s TopGolf Swing Suite will be serviced with bar staples and drinks, and a Starbucks will keep guests fueled on caffeine.</p>
<p>“From day one, we have been committed to developing a high-quality, state-of-the-art gaming and entertainment complex, and through this impressive lineup of restaurants and amenities, we continue to deliver on that promise,” said Roy Corby, general manager of Rivers Casino Portsmouth. “Each of these exciting new venues comes with career opportunities for job seekers — and we’re recruiting and hiring right now.”</p>
<p>Rivers Casino Portsmouth is one of four casinos being constructed in Virginia. The state legalized commercial gambling and casino opportunities for cities that have faced dire economic conditions in recent years.</p>
<p>Along with Portsmouth, casinos are in the works in Norfolk, Danville, and Bristol. Richmond voters, the fifth and only qualifying city, rejected its casino opportunity through a 2022 local ballot referendum.</p>
<p>Construction Schedule Uninterrupted</p>
<p>Rush Street officials said yesterday that construction remains on schedule, along with announcing the restaurants that will complement the casino when it opens. Despite supply chain and labor issues that continue to linger because of the pandemic, Rivers Casino Portsmouth is progressing towards an early 2023 opening.</p>
<p>The resort is expected to employ more than 1,300 permanent workers. Many of those positions will be customer-facing jobs on the casino floor.</p>
<p>We have over 200 people going through dealer school right now,” Corby told the media yesterday. “We have several hundred people currently in the application pipeline, and each job fair brings out more people.”</p>
<p>The next Rivers Casino Portsmouth job fair is set for this Saturday, August 20. The hiring event will occur at the Holiday Inn Virginia Beach Conference Center.</p>
<p>Rivers Portsmouth is being constructed adjacent to Tidewater Community College’s Portsmouth campus on 57 acres of land.</p>
<p>No Temporary Casino</p>
<p>Rivers Casino Portsmouth has no plans to seek a state gaming license to operate a temporary casino. Virginia’s gaming law allows approved casino projects to operate temporary gaming spaces amid construction for up to one year.</p>
<p>Hard Rock Bristol opened its temporary casino last month. The commencement was historic, as it was Virginia’s first legal casino to open with slot machines and table games. The permanent Hard Rock Bristol property, a $400 million undertaking, is slated to be ready sometime in 2024.</p>
<p>The developers of Norfolk’s $500 million casino are also proceeding with a temporary gaming space. Known as HeadWaters Resort and Casino, the permanent Norfolk resort isn’t expected to open until late 2023 or early 2024.</p>
