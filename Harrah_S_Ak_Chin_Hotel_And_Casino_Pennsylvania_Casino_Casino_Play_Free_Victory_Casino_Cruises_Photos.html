    <h1>Harrah S Ak Chin Hotel And Casino Pennsylvania Casino Casino Play Free Victory Casino Cruises Photos</h1>

<p>I had my 2nd deposit at the casino, and after some playing and winning I had a small successful withdrawal of 60 USD to my account, after more playing and winning I tried to withdraw the rest of the balance of 233.08USD, and I received an email saying that I had violated the casino policy because I've open another account on a work email that wasn't even activated or deposit to.</p>
<p>They explained it's a violation and no matter what I tried to explain they insisted that it's a violation.</p>
<p>The "punishment" was 15X wager on my balance 233.08 USD, so I had to wager my balance before I could withdraw it! crazy but I understand I can't do anything.</p>
<p>After I understood that "it what it is", I started playing so I could wage my balance, During my playing I got to win an extra 400USD, and my balance was around 640 USD, Once I finished my waging they just rest my balance back to the original balance I had prior to my 15X waging of my 233.08 USD, meaning they stole from me 400+ USD.</p>
<p>When I approached the support, they told me I better say "Thank you" They let me get the current balance and if I keep asking for my full balance I won't even get that.</p>
<p>When I got the above threat, I decided to first get what I could before I started fighting over the rest, so I did the verification as requested and waited over 4 days to get the approval for my verification so I could get the hell away from there and withdraw my balance.</p>
<p>Before I published this review I even tried to contact the casino and ask them to return my balance so I don't have to publish this review.</p>
<p>Needless to say, I got very generic responses saying that "my withdrawal amount was limited so they had to reduce my winnings".</p>
<p>WHAT?!?</p>
<p>There are so many good online casinos out there</p>
<p>STAY AWAY from Bonanza Game Casino!!</p>
