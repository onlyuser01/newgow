<p>Here's quite a long thread about roulette https://casino.guru/forum/other-casino-games/roulette---network-----electronic-----live--truths-and-misconceptions</p>
<p>Speaking about roulette, I'd like to point out that many players believe that some things that regularly happen on roulette shouldn't happen. For example, there's a common misconception that the ball should land on the same amount of red and black numbers. While this is true from the longer perspective, it certainly isn't true in a short period of time.</p>
<p>People generally believe that when there are 3 black numbers in a row, the next one must be red and if not, then the next one is 100% red. That's not how roulette works. There can be 8 black numbers in a row and that case isn't even that rare. Just play for a couple of hours and it's gonna happen to you.</p>
<p>There's also a misconception that when the ball landed on a certain number let's say 2x during last 5 spins, then it shouldn't land on it in the near future. The truth is that the chances are the same every single spin. The chances don't change, they don't look into the history.</p>
<p>I'd say many players get addicted to roulette simply because they don't understand the mathematics behind the game.</p>
