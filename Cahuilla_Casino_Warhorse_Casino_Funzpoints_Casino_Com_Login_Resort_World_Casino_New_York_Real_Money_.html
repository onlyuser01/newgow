    <h1>Cahuilla Casino Warhorse Casino Funzpoints Casino Com Login Resort World Casino New York Real Money</h1>

<p>I used a VIP code that was single playthrough and bonus amount removed at time of withdrawal. I won around $4000 on Cash bandits 3 and around $1,000 on Sweet 16 and the same on Voodoo magic. I withdrew $2500 and bonus and withdrawal fee was removed from my account. I then played on video poker and lost $800, moved on to other machines and had a balance of around $700. I went to bed and woke up to find the $700 was gone and $50 only was there. Live chat advised that my withdrawal was denied and the $700 was removed and my original deposit left. I asked why and they said "because you played video poker". Now apparently the code states "slots and keno only". Well in Australia, we refer to "slots" as poker machines and that includes video poker. This casino markets itself towards Australian players so they need to use our terminology. Also, I lost on video poker. All my winnings were from other slots and my bonus was removed at the time of requesting the withdrawal so isn't the remaining money then mine?</p>
<p>I emailed them and they ignored me until just now. I got an email saying my account was verified and to go to live chat about my withdrawal. Only problem is I cannot login anymore. It seems I am blocked.</p>
<p>I am a health professional working hard during this pandemic and this is how I am treated. I am saving lives and this cadino is robbing people. If you can please help me, I would appreciate it. Please warn others: Do not play at Trueblue casino.</p>
