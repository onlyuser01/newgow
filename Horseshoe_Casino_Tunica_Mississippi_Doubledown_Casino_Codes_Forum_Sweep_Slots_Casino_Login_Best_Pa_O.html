<p>One of the best-known suppliers and developers of content for the online casino sector, Play’n GO, has landed a significant win in the Spanish iGaming market. Moving forward, the company will be recognized as a licensed entity and will be able to deploy and provide local brands, and their players, with a variety of products from its industry-leading portfolio.</p>
<p>Play’n GO has picked the Spanish market as an important place to expand its operations after the company has been spearheading similar initiatives all across Europe, and even beyond, in the United States. The new license permit will allow Play’n GO to deploy many of its renowned titles that have won and conquered players globally.</p>
<p>Play’n GO Head of Sales and Account Management Magnus Thalin was excited to see this milestone unlocked for his company. Play’n GO will now be able to help partners in the local market to grow their businesses. Thalin said:</p>
<p>"Unlocking Play’n GO content in Spain will be the silver bullet for operators to help them do just that, and we’re excited about the future for our customers in Spain."</p>
<p>The company is also looking at a very ambitious production schedule. Play’n GO is releasing a new game every week and it is now going to work closely with partners in Spain in order to create titles that accurately captivate local player needs and deliver market-first products.</p>
<p>Customers in Spain can expect some of the best and most worthwhile titles coming their way over the next weeks. Play’n GO plans to release no fewer than 50 titles this year alone, and it already operates in 25 regulated markets, thanks to its latest entry into the Spanish market as well.</p>
<p>This achievement comes hot on the tail of another similarly important milestone – the company’s supplier license in Sweden, which saw Play’n GO further consolidate its European footprint and expand in a highly lucrative market. Meanwhile, Play’n GO has continued to enter into important content partnerships with prominent operators in various jurisdictions.</p>
<p>The company signed a content alliance with Sky Betting and Gaming in the United Kingdom in March. There are more exciting partnerships planned out by the company more about which we will learn about before long.</p>
