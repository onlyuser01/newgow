<p>The International Betting Integrity Association (IBIA), an organization known as the "global voice on integrity for the licensed betting industry," announced it extended its successful partnership with the globally recognized gambling industry and betting integrity market data provider, H2 Gambling Capital</p>
<p>Under the terms of the extended partnership between the duo, H2 will continue to deliver official betting market data for IBIA. Moreover, IBIA will also benefit from H2’s leading database which consists of approximately 2 million data points from more than 175 gambling jurisdictions in over 100 countries around the world. H2’s invaluable data has helped the Association significantly over the last few years. In fact, according to the latest announcement, the duo will continue to expand their collaboration further.</p>
<p>The recently renewed partnership builds upon a strong foundation. Back in June 2021, IBIA and H2 joined forces to create a ground-breaking white paper called “International Betting Integrity Association Study.” This unique study marked the first-of-its-kind analysis of the regulation of the betting industry for 20 different jurisdictions from six continents. The study included a ranking and was compiled thanks to data collected from more than 20 globally recognized betting operators.</p>
<p>“The International Betting Integrity Association and H2 Gambling Capital, the industry’s recognized go-to authorities globally on betting integrity and gambling market data, have signed a renewal of their successful partnership agreement that sees the two organizations work to drive up standards in betting market regulation and integrity protection,“ reads a statement released by the IBIA</p>
<p>The Duo Is Excited to Continue Its Collaboration</p>
<p>David Henwood, H2’s director, acknowledged that the company has seen the growth of the Association since its early days. He explained: “With so many new markets still to open up and other more established ones now starting to see their frameworks tighten, it is more important than ever to continue to provide that independent optimal market view and ensure any regulatory decisions that are made are underpinned by the most accurate market data and analysis.” Finally, Henwood said that H2 is excited to continue to collaborate with the Association within the vertical.</p>
<p>“IBIA works closely with key stakeholders, such as regulatory authorities, to ensure that suitable licensing and mitigating process are in place to protect markets from corruption.“ Khalid Ali, CEO of IBIA</p>
<p>Khalid Ali, IBIA’s CEO, acknowledged that the Association continues to collaborate with gaming industry stakeholders in an effort against corruption. He pointed out that the addition of reliable and accurate data for the market, to its global integrity data, is incredibly important. Additionally, Ali said that H2 is the “foremost authority on global gambling markets and our partnership has been a vital component of IBIA’s integrity best practice advocacy activities around the world.” In conclusion, the CEO confirmed that IBIA will be excited to continue its professional relationship with H2.</p>
