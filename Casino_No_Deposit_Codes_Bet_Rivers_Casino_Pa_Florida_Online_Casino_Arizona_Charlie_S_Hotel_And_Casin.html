<p>Despite the hopes of sports fans in Nebraska, sports wagering didn’t launch in time for the NFL 2021 Season kick-off. During a recent interview, the Racing and Gaming Commission in the state outlined that the complex process is taking time. Although no timeframe was provided, sports fans may be able to enjoy sports wagering in Nebraska near the end of 2021 or early 2022.</p>
<p>Legalized Last Year, Nebraska Is Yet to Launch Sports Wagering</p>
<p>It was last year in November when Nebraska residents approved to expand gambling in the state to include sports wagering and games of chance. After November’s ballot, the legislature took several months to establish the rules for sports betting. Consequently, it was up to Governor Pete Ricketts to decide on the future of sports betting. He didn’t take long and approved the gambling expansion into law in May this year.</p>
<p>Now, despite the fact that the NFL’s 2021 season has just kicked off, sports wagering is yet to launch in the Cornhusker State. This caused frustration for many fans, who have patiently awaited the launch of sports wagering, which still hasn’t come.</p>
<p>Regulator Is Focused on Launching the Activity</p>
<p>One reason that is still holding off the launch of sports betting is that the process itself is complex and involves a lot of rules and regulations. In a recent interview for 10/11, Tom Sage, executive director at Nebraska’s Racing and Gaming Commission, acknowledged that some of the residents in the state that approved the gambling expansion are frustrated.</p>
<p>He outlined that operators that want to receive authorization for a license in the state will need to undergo an “extensive background review.” Sage said that this process is not uncommon and many other states do the same. Additionally, he said that sports betting will be available for practicing within a location approved by the regulator or at brick-and-mortar casinos.</p>
<p>Another point that Sage raised is that Nebraskans won’t be able to bet on Husker home games. He explained that betting on the team will be possible for away games, such as the one with Iowa later this season. Although Sage did not reveal a date when sports wagering will be launched officially in Nebraska, that may happen near the end of this year or in early 2022. The executive director assured that the Commission is working on this and asked Nebraskans to be patient.</p>
