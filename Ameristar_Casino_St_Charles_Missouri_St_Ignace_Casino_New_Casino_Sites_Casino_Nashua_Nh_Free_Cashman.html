<p>Play’n GO has launched the fifth slot from the iconic Merlin series, Merlin: Journey of Flame</p>
<p>The 2005-launched Scandinavian gaming entertainment supplier of online slots, Play’n GO, has released Merlin: Journey of Flame. The game is the studio’s freshest addition to the popular series that focuses on the mesmerizing wise old wizard who is always accompanied by his makeshift Book of Spells.</p>
<p>At the start of the month, the provider announced its plans to make its way into the world of retail gaming by making its most popular game, Book of Dead, available at brick-and-mortar casinos in the UK via William Hill.</p>

<p>Building on the Merlin IP’s Rich Mythology</p>
<p>As explained by the company’s head of game retention, George Olekszy, the fresh game is a “truly magical title” thanks to the Expanding Symbol Mechanics, scatter symbols, added gamble feature, and dragon-based storyline.</p>
<p>Built on the Merlin IP’s rich mythology and incorporating different components that belong to Play’n GO’s impressive portfolio of slots, the fifth installment in the wizard series still manages to breathe fresh air into the studio’s roster of games.</p>
<p>The game, which is a prequel to Merlin and the Ice Queen Morgana launched two years ago and Rise of Merlin launched in 2019, tells the tale of young Merlin who comes across a very rare Dragon’s Egg hiding in a swampy lake. Once he proceeds to cast a shell-busting spell that would help him crack open the hatchling, the wise wizard automatically sends himself to a trial by fire.</p>
<p>Free Spins, Special Expanding Symbols and Hatched Dragon Egg Scatters</p>
<p>Players who land at least three Coloured Runes symbols score a win on the grid. Merlin, the Spell Book, his Potion, and his Staff represent the high-paying symbols in the game while the Dragon Egg is the wild. The cracked Dragon Egg alternative represents the scatter symbol.</p>
<p>Players can trigger up to eight free spins with the help of an additional sixth reel provided Merlin collects at least three scatter symbols, leading to more rewards.</p>
<p>Before the free spin round starts, a Special Expanding Symbol is selected randomly that further expands once a winning combo is generated. High-paying symbols require at least two reels. For low-paying symbols, players need at least three reels to engage the Expanding Symbol mechanic.</p>
<p>The Gamble Spell can also be cast by the same dragon-hunting thrill seeker once players score a win of less than 2500 coins. With the help of this feature, the size of Merlin’s prize is doubled provided players manage to correctly guess the color during a fun mini-game. The Gamble spell is limited to five successive casting sessions. The alternative would be for players to win a maximum of 2500 coins.</p>
<p>Last week, the studio launched Fox Mayhem, a fresh slot with free spins and interesting prize collection features after the launch of the superhero-themed, progressive game Ternion in June.</p>
