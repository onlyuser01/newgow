    <h1>The New Pioneer Hotel And Casino Palm Springs Casino Hotels Agua Caliente Resort Casino Spa Rancho M</h1>

<p>I am posting this in the chipstars forum to allow casino guru members to make up their own mind on how things have been handled and if casino gurus complaint process in this instance seems impartial.</p>
<p>My complaint against chipstars was closed down by Nick, seemingly after I pointed out to him several inaccuracies in what chipstars had told him (he refused to provide me with the evidence from chipstars that would confirm their lies) and also after asking him to answer some very relevant questions.</p>
<p>I asked for the complaint to be reopened as Nick completely ignored the main part of my complaint which was chipstars breaching their own T&amp;Cs. As expected it wont be reopened so I will now post my thoughts as to why chipstars seem to be getting preferential treatment from Casino Guru.</p>
<p>Below is the post in my chipstars complaint that Nick doesn't wish to make public. I'm not sure what he is trying to hide so I'll post it here as clearly it is very relevent to chipstars.</p>
<p>Nick</p>
<p>I am seeking for this complaint to be reopened and you have ignored the main part of my complaint and that is that chipstars breached their own T&amp;Cs below</p>
<ol>
<li>What will happen to my account if it isn't verified?</li>
</ol>
<p>Until you get verified you can use play money to check out the platform and gameplay. After you get registered you can make a deposit and receive deposit bonus and get included in the VIP program.</p>
<p>My account was NEVER verified but allowed to lose over EUR 26,300 in a matter of weeks and be made a VIP account.</p>
<p>Did you even ask chipstars was my account verified? I suspect you didn't as you have already made you mind up to side with Chipstars.</p>
<p>It is apparent you have closed the case without a full investigation. You have said the following</p>
<p>"In your case, even if UK was restricted at the time of you registering, there is not a single instance where you can just lose all your money, pull out the terms and ask for a refund."</p>
<p>So it's alright for the casino to breach their T&amp;Cs with no penalty?</p>
<p>I also pointed out to you the blatant lie that chipstars told you when they said the licensing authorities had already viewed my case and found in chipstars favour. That is 100% a lie and when I asked you to provide the evidence of these lies you have closed down the complaint.</p>
<p>You complaints manager Jozef also told me this</p>
<p>"It is important to note that accepting players from the UK without a UK license is not acceptable. I highly recommend that you only play on UK licensed platforms. However, we believe that this matter should be discussed with the regulatory authorities. I may assist you with this process."</p>
<p>If that is your belief then why are you a major affiliate of chipstars and furthermore are more than happy to provide links to new UK players for bonuses from chipstars. Oh and these bonuses are exclusive to casino guru visitors with a people of the UK flag and a green tick. I think it's fairly obvious who you are specially aiming the bonuses at.</p>
<p>I think the word hypocrite springs to mind.</p>
<p>I'm sure you won't post this to the general public and you wouldn't want to be seen to being impartial when it comes to complaints but I'll wait and see.</p>
