<p>A new report suggests that prior to the launch of ESPN BET in Massachusetts, the gambling regulator requires more information from PENN Entertainment</p>
<p>Earlier this year, PENN Entertainment and ESPN joined forces for a new venture called ESPN BET. The new groundbreaking sportsbook, representing a rebranded version of PENN’s Barstool Sportsbook, secured a cash injection of $1.5 billion from the company to ESPN. As one of the most anticipated sportsbook launches in Massachusetts, ESPN BET is expected to deliver unrivaled experiences to bettors and sports fans in the state.</p>
<p>Yet, the discussions between PENN Entertainment and the gambling regulator in the state, the Massachusetts Gaming Commission, continue ahead of the planned launch for ESPN BET in November. As announced by Sports Handle, representatives of the gambling regulator queried why PENN hasn’t explained in detail its relationship with ESPN.</p>
<p>Cathy Judd-Stein, MGC’s chair, explained: “I’m waiting for the ask (from PENN) unless there is this notion that there doesn’t have to be an ask.” She was surprised why the Commission hadn’t received the information already and questioned “where the disconnect is.”</p>
<p>According to the recent report, the commission’s staff attorney, Catilin Monahan, explained that the rebranded sportsbook may not be cleared for launch in November unless it secures approval from the gambling regulator in the state. In other words, the launch of ESPN BET may potentially be impacted, unless PENN can resolve this matter with the Commission timely. Whatever the case is, with time running out this month, PENN is on a tight schedule to receive a green light from the gambling regulator.</p>
<p>The New Sportsbook Unveiled Its Logo</p>
<p>In anticipation of its debut in November, ESPN BET released its new logo last week. The new logo, offering mint green colors, fuses creatively the letter “E” inside the letter “B,” hinting to the betting partnership between PENN and ESPN.</p>
<p>According to ESPN Creative Studio’s vice president of visual storytelling, Chin Wang, the new ESPN BET logo symbolizes innovation and fun. It underlines the importance of the collaboration and the exceptional experiences the new brand is expected to bring for sports fans and bettors alike.</p>
<p>Amid the growth of sports betting, a legal form of the activity is now available across more than 30 US states. While the majority of states have already legalized and launched activity, several are yet to launch it, while a handful of states have no legislation.</p>
