<p>Pariplay, a subsidiary of NeoGames, has appointed Doina Stefanescu as the new VP of delivery. Stefanescu joined the company from DraftKings where she most recently worked as director of gaming operations. This development comes days after Pariplay added a new studio to its Fusion platform.</p>
<p>Stefanescu Will Be Tasked With Meeting Market Requirements</p>
<p>As the new VP of delivery, Stefanescu will have to define the strategy of Pariplay and address market requirements. Developing business plans for products by suppliers and identifying customer needs will also be within her scope.</p>
<p>The MD of Pariplay, Adrian Bailey, shared a few words on Stefanescu’s appointment. He stated that the company is thrilled to have her on board and noted that this appointment is in line with Pariplay’s commitment to evolving its “product offering.”</p>
<p>Bailey ended by saying that Stefanescu’s experience is second to none and thanks to that fact, she’s an invaluable team member.</p>
<p>Before joining Pariplay, Stefanescu worked as DraftKings’ director of gaming operations and before that, she was the COO of EveryMatrix. Additionally, she was the CEO of Casino Engine and worked as the head of casino products at SBTech.</p>
<p>Commenting on her appointment, Stefanescu stated that she’s excited about the opportunity and she’s happy to join a company that has had “a fantastic journey so far.” She noted that Pariplay’s strategy for the future is bold and that she’s looking forward to implementing her knowledge to help the company grow.</p>
<p>Pariplay Has Been Expanding Across Multiple Jurisdictions Recently</p>
<p>Pariplay has been quite active in the recent period. Not only did the aggregator gain an interactive gaming manufacturer license from the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board, but the company also increased its presence in Switzerland.</p>
<p>The expanded Swiss market presence was made possible by going live with Casinò Lugano’s brand, Swiss4Win.ch. Thanks to the deal, Swiss4Win.ch will benefit from the Fusion platform of Pariplay and thus, will carry the content of Wizard Games.</p>
<p>Andrew Maclean, Pariplay’s VP of sales, stated that Switzerland is an important market for Pariplay and the launch of Wizard Games’ content at Swiss4Win.ch represents the start of a long and successful collaboration between the two parties.</p>
<p>Casinò Lugano SA’s CEO and board member, Paolo Sanvido, stated that the company is always searching for new and engaging content and that the deal with Pariplay “provides games that fit the bill perfectly.”</p>
<p>North America has been quite the focus of this company. Aside from securing a Pennsylvania license, Pariplay partnered with Atlantic Lottery and thus, continued to expand in Canada. Thanks to the deal, Pariplay will supply Atlantic Lottery with a variety of games. The partnership between the two came off the heels of Pariplay’s license approvals in Ontario.</p>
