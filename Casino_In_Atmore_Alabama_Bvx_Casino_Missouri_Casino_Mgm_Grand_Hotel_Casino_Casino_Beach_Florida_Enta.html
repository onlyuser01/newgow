<p>Global entertainment giant Entain has confirmed that it will extend its partnership with Trident Leagues and will continue to collaborate with the organization in the next several years.</p>
<p>This collaboration pivots on community sports investment and will help Trident Leagues find a financial foothold as they seek to continue focusing on grassroots sports and community-driven initiatives.</p>
<p>Entain Continues Trident Leagues Partnership</p>
<p>Entain Foundation will continue to support the organization under the slogan “Pitching In,” which alludes to the official name of the Trident Leagues. The partnership’s extension is an important continuation of the company’s relationship with Trident Leagues.</p>
<p>The first partnership was originally set up in 2020 and has been ongoing for a while now Entain made several other commitments since then, including the Pitching In Volunteer Hub it set up earlier this year. It has been able to generate and drive a positive social impact and enabled the leagues to have a fallback solution during the nadir of the COVID-19 pandemic which paralyzed sport.</p>
<p>The Pitching In partnership has been designed to promote closer ties between clubs and local communities. Entain will be investing in both the Trident Community Fund and now the Pitching In Volunteer Hub, which was set up to make sure the Trident Leagues can continue to operate and promote good sports and social rapport.</p>
<p>The organization will also benefit from the likeness and imagery of Stuart Pearce who will also help in-person by remaining in his role as the current Pitching In ambassador. Welcoming this opportunity, Entain CEO Jette Nygaard-Andersen said:</p>
<p>We are truly proud of what we have achieved with Pitching In and our partnership with the Trident Leagues, particularly in the positive impact it is having on grass roots sports and for social engagement. Entain CEO Jette Nygaard-Andersen</p>
<p>Exploring Opportunities to Grow Community-Focused Sports</p>
<p>Nygaard-Andersen confirmed that Entain was fully committed to making important contributions to grassroots sports and the communities built around them. A joint statement by the Pitching In Trident Leagues has welcomed the latest partnership expansion and said:</p>
<p>We couldn’t be more pleased that Entain are extending their Pitching In partnership with us. This is truly unlike any other sponsorship that we have been involved in. Entain CEO Jette Nygaard-Andersen</p>
<p>The Pitching In Trident Leagues remains fully committed to improving engagement with the local community, something that both the leagues and Entain share as their mission statement in the partnership.</p>
