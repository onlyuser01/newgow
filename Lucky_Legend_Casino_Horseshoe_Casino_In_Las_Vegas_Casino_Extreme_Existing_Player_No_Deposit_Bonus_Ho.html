<p>Regal Streak review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>This slot is themed loosely around a classic card deck, with a side dish of fruit machine.</p>
<p>With a baize green background, the setting seems to be a felt cards table. The gold framed reel adds a royal ambiance to the mood.</p>
<p>The concept is not especially original, but players looking for that good old-fashioned casino vibe will be right at home in this game.</p>
<p>Big win in the Regal Streak slot</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The soundtrack is a series of repetitive notes that do not take long to grow tiresome. Many players will likely opt for the mute option. It feels like a missed opportunity to have used a darker party tune that would have upheld the casino mood.</p>
<p>The graphics are straight forward with symbols such as green clover-like clubs and glossy cherries. Upon wins the symbols are framed in glowing gold and a spurt of gold coins appears.</p>
<p>The overall aesthetic is festive, but not particularly cohesive or striking. It feels a little like a few classic slot images were assembled together all in one game.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Regal Streak is a five reel, three row slot.</p>
<p>Players are awarded wins whenever matching symbols land anywhere on the same win line.</p>
<p>Players can be awarded larger multipliers for higher paying symbols (see further details below).</p>
<p>The gameplay has a familiar pace and style that players will be comfortable with.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>There is no Wild symbol in this game.</p>
<p>When it appears three times in a win line, the Regal Spins symbol triggers the 15 Free Spins. Each additional Regal Spins symbol triggers 5 more free spins.</p>
<p>A Multiplier Symbol is chosen at random before the free spins begin.</p>
<p>The Multiplier Bar gets closer to the opportunity for a bonus every time the player wins with the Multiplier Symbol.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 94.7%, decisively below our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.20 up to a maximum of $/£/€10.00. per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is high, which makes it a good match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>

<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We do not recommend this low RTP, high volatility card and fruit-themed slot.</p>
<p>The unoriginal theme and mediocre atmosphere do not make up for this game’s poor strategy stats. Players looking for a captivating front end, or maximized wins will want to keep moving and try a different slot.</p>
<p>Perhaps some players will be craving the truly classic aesthetic of this game, but they’ll be sacrificing their own odds to indulge.</p>
