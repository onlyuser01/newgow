<p>Net revenues of $2.54 billion represent a significant increase from last year, reflecting a noticeable recovery for the company’s integrated resort properties. An uptick in Macau and Singapore visitor numbers enhanced performance in all verticals, with gaming profits reaching record highs. Las Vegas Sands Corp. will leverage these favorable results to support strategic investments and ensure enduring growth.</p>
<p>All Metrics Rose Compared to Last Year</p>
<p>The second quarter of 2023 saw Las Vegas Sands Corp. preserve its impressive momentum as its core Asian markets remain on the road to recovery. The $2.54 billion Q2 net revenue significantly outperformed 2022’s $1.05 billion for the same period last year. Such a surge reflects the steady recovery of the company’s integrated resort properties amidst increased consumer confidence in the hospitality and gaming sectors.</p>
<p>Las Vegas Sands also witnessed a remarkable improvement in its operating income for the second quarter. The company reported operating income of $537 million, compared to an operating loss of $147 million in Q2 2022. Chairman and CEO Rob Goldstein noted that the company’s Singapore and Macau properties experienced a remarkable turnaround as the region’s tourism and travel industries returned to normal.</p>

<p>The operator’s Macau and Singapore venues saw stable growth in all gaming and non-gaming segments. Capital expenditures of $196 million primarily centered around Marina Bay Sands, which modernized its app and smart hotel services. Strategic cost-cutting measures and improved operational efficiencies have bolstered the company’s bottom line, placing it in the perfect position to consolidate its position in its core markets.</p>
<p>The Company Will Leverage Its Newfound Momentum</p>
<p>The second-quarter financial results reaffirm Las Vegas Sands Corp.’s leading position in the global integrated resort industry. The company plans to leverage its stable footing to diversify its offerings and finance strategic investments. The recent approval from Nassau County marked the first step towards a Sands New York State casino as the operator entered the race for the region’s limited licenses.</p>
<p>Positive Q2 results also allowed the company to resume its program to return capital to stockholders. CEO Goldstein was optimistic that the positive trend would endure in the following months, allowing the developer to fund its Macau and Singapore capital-expenditure programs and pursue growth opportunities in new markets.</p>
<p>Las Vegas Sands Corp.’s second-quarter financial results mark a significant milestone in its journey towards renewed growth. The substantial increase in net revenue and operating income reflects the resilience and adaptability of the company despite ongoing macroeconomic challenges. Thanks to its newfound momentum, Las Vegas Sands Corp. stands ready to build upon its successes and remain a formidable force in the integrated resort sector.</p>
