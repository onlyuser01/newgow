<p>Great Rhino Megaways review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Great Rhino Megaways is a safari themed slot, in which the titular rhino is just one of several beasts you can find. The reels sport laughing hyenas, tearful crocodiles, and pink flamingos.</p>
<p>The reels are decorated with the kind of pseudo-tribal chic that east african tourist lodges like to adopt. And the background is rolling grasslands with various fauna grazing away, in short animated loops.</p>
<p>It’s got everything you might need for a good safari, except the lions.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>Digital airbrush-style paintings make up the main art for this slot. It’s a style that fits. It is reminiscent of those wildlife identification books of the 1990s and works perfectly with a safari theme.</p>
<p>The animations are slick, in the way most slots with the Megaways system in place are. They are smooth and clean, with plenty of indication to the player of what is happening and why.</p>
<p>The music uses east African instruments to create an atmospheric track to keep the game engaging for the player.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Great Rhino Megaways does a good job of zhuzhing up the Megaways format.</p>
<p>The Megaways system used by this slot is a licensed gameplay system that combines randomised reels size with an any way wins system. Each reel can have between two and seven symbols (plus an extra row of symbols on reels 2 to 5). The number changes for each reel, each spin.</p>
<p>There is also a cascade system where winning symbols are removed from the reels and new symbols drop down from above (or move in from the right in the extra row).</p>
<p>As a result, the number of win ways can be as high as 200,704 (for seven symbols on all six basic reels, plus the symbols on the extra row for an 7-8-8-8-8-7 layout).</p>
<p>The player can kick in an extra 25% of their bet per spin to double their chance of triggering the Free Spin bonus feature (full details below). Free spins can also be bought into directly for one hundred times the bet per regular spin.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter symbol. The Wild symbol only on the top row, limiting its appearance to rows 2 to 5.</p>
<p>Four or more Scatter symbols in one spin will trigger the Free Spin Bonus.</p>
<p>The player then gets a choice of three Bonuses with differing volatility. The more Scatters that trigger the bonus the better all three options are.</p>
<p>For example, four Scatters allows the player to choose between 15 spins with a x1 multiplier, 10 spins with a x5 multiplier, or 5 spins with a x15 multiplier. For five Scatters the number of spins is increased to 19, 14, and 9 respectively. The multipliers do not change.</p>
<p>There is also an option to randomise both the multiplier and the number of spins. This is the highest volatility option.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is between 96.47% and 96.58% depending on your operator, well over our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.20 up to a maximum of $/£/€100.00 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is high, which makes it a perfect match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility and RTP.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>With its high volatility and RTP, this slot is off to a good start with its basic stats.</p>
<p>That it couples this with interesting and varied gameplay and an atmospheric audio-visual style gets it our recommendation. The theme might be a little overdone, but here it is done well.</p>
<p>We highly recommend this slot.</p>
