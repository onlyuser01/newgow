    <h1>Casino Del Sol Tucson Az Treasure Island Hotel And Casino Reviews Foxwoods Casino Connecticut L Aube</h1>

<p>Recently appointed executives Randy Morton and Marc Badain, who will be responsible for developing a 2,000-room Oak View Group Las Vegas Hotel &amp; Casino at Las Vegas Boulevard and Blue Diamond Road, have shared more information on the planned project, which is expected to be ready in 2026.</p>
<p>2,000 Rooms and a 20,000-seat Arena</p>
<p>Oak View Group partners Tim Leiweke and Irving Azoff have named former co-CEO of the Foley Entertainment Group Randy Morton and former president of the Raiders Marc Badain to be in charge of the development of their huge $3bn casino-resort projects which will be located south of the Las Vegas Strip. The project will span over 25 acres in the vicinity of Interstate 15 and south of Interstate 215 and will include a 20,000-seat arena suitable for music concerts, sports events, conferences, award shows, etc.</p>
<p>Detailed plans and design are still in the making but the developers are aiming for an intricate integration between the arena and the luxury boutique casino resort. What will be attractive for customers is the ease of access through Las Vegas Boulevard South. There will be 2,000 rooms and suites in total. The arena is set at 20,000 but there could be changes depending on the optimization for the needs and wants of the music world.</p>
<p>Ready for NBA</p>
<p>There have been rumors that Oak View Group is interested in an NBA franchise and attracting an NBA team to the arena. Badain has explained that this is a decision that comes from the NBA and Oak View Group cannot interfere in their decision-making processes.</p>
<p>The 30 owners, which are part of the league, are the ones that determine whether they want to expand in Las Vegas or not. If they do, Oak View Group will offer them a venue that is suitable for them. Oak View Group CEO Tim Leiweke has also commented on the matter:</p>
<p>If they (the NBA) made a commitment to Vegas at some point in the future, this building will be built so that it would be spectacular for the NBA. Not just in the way that it operates, meeting and exceeding all their standards, but in a way economically it could generate revenue for an NBA team. Oak View Group CEO Tim Leiweke</p>
<p>An additional advantage for the huge casino resort and arena is a train station project, which is part of Brightlineâ€™s high-speed rail connecting Las Vegas and Los Angeles. The project is being developed by Brightline, which is owned by billionaire Wes Edens, co-CEO of Fortress Investment Group, and there are rumors that he is also planning a major soccer stadium on adjacent land.</p>
