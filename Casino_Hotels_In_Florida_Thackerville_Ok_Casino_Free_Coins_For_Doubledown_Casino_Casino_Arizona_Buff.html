    <h1>Casino Hotels In Florida Thackerville Ok Casino Free Coins For Doubledown Casino Casino Arizona Buff</h1>

<p>Thanks for your message.</p>
<p>Please understand that support in casinos licensed in Curacao, might not be familiar with Gamstop organization, and it won't necessarily act to protect you from gambling if the only reason for blocking your account is registration on Gamstop.</p>
<p>Please allow me to explain the difference between closing the account and self-exclusion:</p>
<p>Closing an account is simple and has almost no impact - the player can reopen the account anytime, and the casino has no obligation to the player.</p>
<p>On the other hand, self-exclusion does. If a player successfully makes a self-exclusion the casino agrees not to open this account or if yes only under particular circumstances.</p>
<p>When applying for the self-exclusion, clearly state the reason for deactivating your account and specify the time period. Also, the email "Subject" should be clearly marked and easily recognizable as the casino support receives many requests per day. If it is marked visibly you will stand a better chance of having your request granted as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>Email subject: Self-exclusion</p>
<p>Player’s info:</p>
<p>First name:</p>
<p>Last name:</p>
<p>DOB:</p>
<p>Casino login:</p>
<p>Email address:</p>
<p>"Greetings,</p>
<p>I’m writing to inform you that I wish to exclude immediately from this casino and from receiving any gambling-related marketing material for a minimum period of xxx months/years (permanently).</p>
<p>The reason for my decision is xxx (gambling problems).</p>
<p>I acknowledge that I will not be allowed to rescind my self-exclusion during this period and that the self-exclusion cannot be lifted before the end of the agreed period."</p>
<p>Please send another email to support@mystake.email (you can CC me at tomas@casino.guru in the copy) and keep me informed about any further developments. Thank you in advance.</p>
