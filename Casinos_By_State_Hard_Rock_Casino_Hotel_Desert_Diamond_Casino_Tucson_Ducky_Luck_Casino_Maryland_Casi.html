<p>Online betting and gaming company Kindred Group and the Philadelphia Eagles agreed to another extension of their partnership under which Kindred’s flagship brand Unibet will serve as the Eagles’ official casino, online casino games and sportsbook partner throughout the 2024/25 season.</p>
<p>‘Essential Piece Going Forward’</p>
<p>The new three-year extension will allow Kindred and the Eagles to continue building on their partnership dating back to November 2019 when Unibet was named the official casino partner of the NFL franchise.</p>
<p>Emphasizing the importance of the partnership with the Eagles as a “key pillar in Unibet’s strategy in Pennsylvania” from the moment the group entered the Keystone State, Kindred Group senior vice president of North America Manuel Stan outlined that the collaboration “will continue to be an essential piece going forward.”</p>
<p>“We are very pleased to continue the collaboration and continue to develop innovative and engaging projects both at the stadium as well as digitally,” he added.</p>
<p>In addition to being designated as the Official Partner for Online Casino, Casino, Online Games, and Sportsbook of the Eagles, under the new extension Unibet will have a dedicated ‘Unibet Landing’ location at Lincoln Financial Field where the brand will be able to host events and activities aimed at fan engagement throughout the year.</p>
<p>‘Forward-Thinking Approach to the Industry’</p>
<p>Brian Napoli, vice president of Corporate Partnerships for the Philadelphia Eagles was excited to see the Unibet partnership extended by another three years, outlining Unibet’s “forward-thinking approach” as key to empowering the franchise to connect with its fans in “new and interactive ways.”</p>
<p>“Through our continued partnership, we are excited to offer Eagles fans even more engagement opportunities, starting with the new Unibet Landing at Lincoln Financial Field this season,” Napoli concluded.</p>
<p>Kindred’s flagship brand and the Eagles will expand their collaboration by offering consumers Eagles branded mobile casino games, including slots, blackjack and others, while the Eagles stadium and the team’s digital properties will see Unibet activations.</p>
<p>The new three-year partnership extension is the second between the gaming group and the NFL franchise. Following their initial collaboration in November 2019, Kindred and the Eagles extended their agreement in October 2020, when Unibet became the franchise’s Official Sportsbook Partner, in addition to already being the Official Casino Partner of the Eagles.</p>
