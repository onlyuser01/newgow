<p>Armadillo Does Christmas is an exciting slot with big win potential, exciting features and a unique Trail Bonus</p>
<p>Armadillo Studios, one of EveryMatrix’s proprietary developers of casino games, has re-released its popular Christmas-themed slot, Armadillo Does Christmas, just in time for the festivities. The beloved action-packed game’s relaunch was highly demanded by the studio’s fans.</p>
<p>Armadillo Does Christmas Metrics:</p>
<p>Rows: 4</p>
<p>Reels: 5</p>
<p>Paylines: 25</p>
<p>RTP: 94.17%</p>
<p>Volatility: High</p>
<p>Min/Max bet: 0.25/100</p>
<p>Max win: 3,000x</p>
<p>A Feature-Packed Experience</p>
<p>Armadillo Does Christmas is an exciting slot with big win potential, exciting features and a unique Trail Bonus. The 5×4 slot offers high volatility, providing players with a shot at big Christmas presents.</p>
<p>The game will see players join Armadillo Studios’ signature mascot who was dressed up for the occasion. By firing up the reels of Armadillo Does Christmas, players will collect a variety of symbols to score winning combinations and win prizes.</p>
<p>The chances of winning are increased by a multitude of features, such as Random Wilds that substitute random positions and Wild Reels that substitute randomly selected reels. A Colossal Reels feature, on the other hand, will see adjacent reels fuse to form larger 2×2, 3×3 or 4×4 symbols, further increasing players’ chances of scoring winning combinations.</p>
<p>Armadillo Studios’ cute mascot has additional presents in store and will provide Random Multipliers of 2x, 3x, 4x or 5x to the players. Adding to the festivities, a Symbol Upgrades feature will sometimes upgrade a randomly chosen low-paying symbol to a higher-paying one.</p>
<p>The fun is further bolstered by the Instant Win feature which can increase player’s prizes up to 200x.</p>
<p>Collect Special Symbols to Trigger Bonuses</p>
<p>Armadillo Does Christmas also sports a tabletop-inspired bonus game that is triggered when players land on three or more Bonus Symbols. During the bonus game, Armadillo will slide through the snow and collect various holiday-themed items.</p>
<p>If players collect 4 Whiskey symbols, they will trigger the Party Spin, firing up the reels for free. Impatient players can also trigger this bonus immediately through the Buy Bonus feature, in markets where this is permitted.</p>
<p>Armadillo Studios’ chief operating officer, David Stoveld, commented on the re-release of the new game:</p>
<p>Armadillo Does Christmas was so well received last year that we had to bring it back by popular demand! Armadillo Studios promises a festive treat for everyone with an array of features, ensuring joy for players in these cheerful times. David Stoveld, COO, Armadillo Studios</p>
<p>Armadillo Does Christmas is in line with the company’s tradition to celebrate the biggest occasions with special slots. In October, Armadillo Studios released Franksylvania, just in time for Halloween.</p>
