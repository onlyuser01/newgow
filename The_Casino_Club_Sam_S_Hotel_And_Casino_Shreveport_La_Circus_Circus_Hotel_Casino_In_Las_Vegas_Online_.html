<p>The off-Strip casino resort is undergoing a $690 million renovation by Station Casinos – the casino operator that purchased the property in 2016 for $312.5 million from the Maloof family. This weekend, the Palms’ Kaos nightclub opens and the casino is hoping to lure in high rollers for the commencement.</p>
<p>The Las Vegas Sun says the Palms is offering a $1 million package that includes a three-night stay in the Empathy Suite – a 9,000-square-foot space redesigned by Damien Hirst that is regarded as Las Vegas’ most expensive suite. Along with the three nights, guests who shell out the seven-figure rate will receive “white-glove” service and rare bottles of Dom Perignon and Ace of Spades champagne.</p>
<p>It wasn’t revealed whether the $1,000,000 reservation is inclusive of the Palms’ $39 per night resort fee, which the casino says is for in-room internet access, fitness center use, daily newspaper, and front-desk copies and faxes. $1 million for a 72-hour stay breaks down to $13,888 per hour.</p>
<p>Las Vegas Indulgences</p>
<p>The Palms is upping the ante when it comes to Sin City extravagances.</p>
<p>The Venetian recently unveiled a package called “Want the World” that runs at $450,000. The Strip casino bundle includes private airfare to McCarran International, ground transportation via Maybach, and four nights in the resort’s 6,500-square-foot presidential suite.</p>
<p>For those who choose to spoil themselves,” is how parent company Las Vegas Sands summarizes the experience.</p>
<p>As Casino.org detailed last month, Las Vegas is home to an abundance of ways to spend great deals of money for those who seemingly have excess amounts of cash. Options include a $5,000 Wagyu hamburger at Mandalay Bay, a “four hands” massage at Wynn’s Encore for $600, and $250,000 to control the Bellagio’s famed fountains (which also includes a 30-liter bottle of Ace of Spades bubbly).</p>
<p>Off-Strip Development</p>
<p>Located a mile west of the Strip across I-15, there has been much speculation as to why Station Casinos owners Frank III and Lorenzo Fertitta believe the Palms is worthy of more than $1 billion when all is said and done.</p>
<p>Last fall, Vital Vegas blogger Scott Roeben reported on rumors that the nearby Rio could be demolished to make way for an MLB ballpark.</p>
<p>“There’s been a spike in investor interest in parcels around Rio. The speculation part: If an MLB ballpark plan is in the works, it’s an ‘Aha’ moment for why Stations has invested so much in Palms when it can’t possibly recoup the investment – unless they know something we don’t,” Roeben opined.</p>
<p>Caesars Entertainment, the parent company of the Rio, hasn’t commented on the rumors. The casino will host the 50th World Series of Poker beginning late next month.</p>
<p>Palms is roughly a mile north of where the $1.8 billion Las Vegas NFL football stadium is being constructed. The Raiders are expected to begin playing there in 2020.</p>
