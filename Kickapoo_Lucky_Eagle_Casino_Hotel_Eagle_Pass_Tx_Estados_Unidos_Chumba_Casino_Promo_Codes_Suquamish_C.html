<p>While some professional poker players do not have a single GGPoker Super MILLION$ title, this is not the case for Niklas Astedt. The Swedish pro player won his first title last month, and earlier this week he took home a hefty $313,907 prize along with a second Super MILLION$ title.</p>
<p>Niklas Astedt Is the Winner of the 49th Episode of GGPoker Super MILLION$</p>
<p>Only two months ago, Niklas Astedt, a professional poker player from Sweden, did not have a single GGPoker Super MILLION$ title. However, with consistency, professional play, and dedication this has changed rather quickly. On April 13, the Swedish pro won his first Super MILLION$ title, which brought him the staggering prize of $1,095,741.</p>
<p>Now, things got even better for Astedt, who won his second Super MILLION$ title on Tuesday this week. The 49th episode of the tournament brought the Swedish player a hefty prize of $313,907. Besides the second title, Astedt’s winnings from Super MILLION$ received a nice boost, hitting a total of $3,354,273.</p>
<p>Out of a total of 46 attempts in Super MILLION$ tournaments, Astedt has collected money prizes for 21. Furthermore, from that total, he has reached the final tables a dozen times. Considering the significant number of appearances which the Swedish player had, the tournaments in which he participated have always been thrilling.</p>
<p>The Final Table Brought Plenty of Action</p>
<p>To win his second Super MILLION$ title, Astedt had to take out 8 other opponents. At the final table action, the first eliminated player was “judd trump” from China, who took 9th place, taking home $48,802. Shortly after, he was joined by Bruno Volkmann from Brazil who won 8th place and took home $61,587.</p>
<p>Mario Mosboeck from Austria was the 7th player that was eliminated, taking home $77,720. Mikita Badziakouski from Belarus came in 6th with a $98,079 prize, followed by Elio Fox with $123,772 who took fifth place. Player “rushaakkandqq” from Austria took $156,195 for the 4th place, while Ramiro Petrone was 3rd and won $197,111.</p>
<p>In the end, it was only Astedt against Sam Greenwood from Canada. At the final hand, Greenwood held king-queen, which didn’t hold against Astedt’s ace-five which got him two pairs – fives and fours. One step before the winner’s place, Greenwood got home with $248,746 reaching second place at the Super MILLION$ final table.</p>
