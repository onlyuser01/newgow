<p>MGA has introduced the Suspicious Betting Reporting Mechanism (SBRM) to rally the sports betting industry in helping the regulator tackle match-fixing.</p>
<p>MGA Launches SBRM Against Match-Fixing</p>
<p>The Malta Gaming Authority (MGA), one of the leading remote gaming regulators in Europe, has issued new, stricter guidelines focusing on suspicious sports betting activity. As per the new guidelines, operators who suspect such activity or identify aberrant betting behavior will have to immediately inform the regulator starting on January 1, 2021.</p>
<p>The decision comes after extensive consultation with industry names and insiders and is a direct continuation of the discussion and attempts to bolster the integrity of sports. Match-fixing has been a genuine concern in Europe, involving the European Union policy authority in the fight against fraudulent betting activity.</p>
<p>Moving forward, the MGA will offer all B2C license holders its proprietor Suspicious Betting Reporting Mechanism (SBRM) solution as of November 2020. That way, the regulator may begin to track down transactions and provide operators willing to help with the infrastructure to do so quickly and efficiently.</p>
<p>The MGA will provide operators with a manual to explain how B2C can successfully implement the technology without any hassle. In 2019, the regulator worked on a similar framework known as the Sports Integrity Unit (SIU) which sole purpose was to safeguard the integrity of sports.</p>
<p>Regulators Expand on Worthwhile Practices in the Industry</p>
<p>Building up on the endorsement that the SIU received, the MGA has been able to offer a better framework today. A possible difficulty that could stem from the policing of sports betting too closely, though, remains how potential conflicts would be settled between operators and affected consumers.</p>
<p>SIU offered no clear resolution other than having operators reassuring affected parties that an issue is worked on. However, SBRM will now offer updates in real-time, making it possible for operators to inform affected customers around the clock. Commenting on the progress made, an MGA spokesperson had this to say, cited by iGamingBusiness:</p>
<p>“As already reiterated throughout this consultation process the MGA’s SIU is adamant to continue increasing its collaboration efforts with both its licensees and other stakeholders interested in safeguarding the integrity of sports and sports betting.”</p>
<p>In the meantime, the MGA is going to require from operators to provide detailed information about the conditions and markets under which a suspected fraudulent bet took place. Operators would be required to provide account information and the time the event occurred.</p>
<p>The regulator would also expect operators to provide a list of other bodies that it has notified of the suspected match-fixing. The SBRM is the next step in the fight against fraudulent betting operations, following the establishment of SIU in August 2019.</p>
<p>Kindred Group joined the European Football Network (EFDN) in its efforts to uproot match-fixing. FIFA has also devised a new app enabling conscientious players to submit match-fixing alert without disclosing personal information.</p>
<p>While match-fixing has certainly been a problem all across Europe, and the United States, there has been no small amount of effort going to quell it. Sweden came up with more measures earlier this year, targeting football.</p>
