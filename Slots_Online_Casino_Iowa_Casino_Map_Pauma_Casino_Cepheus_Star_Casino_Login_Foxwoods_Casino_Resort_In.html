<p>Internet Vikings, a Sweden-based global iGaming hosting provider, has entered the Ontario iGaming market, expanding its presence in Canada.</p>
<p>Internet Vikings Secures a License Ahead of Market Launch</p>
<p>The provider has secured this entry right on time as Ontario plans to soon launch its regulated iGaming market. The Canadian province opened for applications starting September 2021 and operators and B2B providers were free to apply for a license. Despite the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario reviewing applications, operators cannot leverage their offerings before the market has been officially launched.</p>
<p>The AGCO and iGaming Ontario are currently working on what the region’s definitive iGaming regulations will be. A few days ago the two authorities announced April 4 as the official launch date of Ontario’s iGaming market.</p>
<p>This means that Internet Vikings has exactly two months to prepare for the coming of betting and iGaming. According to its plans, the provider will offer the same products that it already provides in the United States, including its proprietary Cloud Hosting Services.</p>
<p>The Company Continues Its Steady Expansion</p>
<p>Kristoffer Ottosson, the head of hosting services for Internet Vikings, shared that he is excited to enter the Canadian iGaming market and is delighted by the opportunities that Ontario represents.</p>
<p>Elena Kvakova, the company’s head of US expansion added that expanding into the Canadian market seems like a logical move. She pointed out that Internet Vikings has already made significant progress with its operations in the United States and now is the perfect time to take its business to the next level.</p>
<p>Kvakova described the Ontario launch as a “striking move” for the Swedish provider.</p>
<p>“We are proud to be ahead of our competition and we’re ready to begin helping iGaming companies to get started in this market, which is showing such enormous potential.”</p>
<p>Internet Vikings will also continue expanding in the United States where it has a growing number of data centers. A little over a week ago, Internet Vikings successfully launched its operations in the state of Illinois, expanding the company’s US presence.</p>
<p>The provider’s solutions are available in several regulated markets across the world. The Canada expansion is one of the company’s current focuses as it seeks to become one of the pioneers in its fresh markets. The company secured a Toronto license a few months ago and is closely following the budding of iGaming in Canada.</p>
<p>In September 2021, Internet Vikings scored a multi-year partnership with PlayStar, helping with its New Jersey launch.</p>
