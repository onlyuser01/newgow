    <h1>Movie Casino Royale Cast The Ocean Casino True Fortune Casino No Deposit Bonus Bethlehem Pa Casino M</h1>

<p>Saturday, August 6 is the day when Nottingham Forest are going to play their first Premier League game in the 21st century. The newcomers are delighted to be in the English top-flight, meaning that we’re going to see them go above and beyond in their first game. The trouble is that even though they’re motivated, the player quality is on the side of their opponents – Newcastle United F.C.</p>

<p>Newcastle to Start the 2022-23 Season in Top Gear</p>
<p>Since the 2021 Saudi takeover, Newcastle became the home to a number of new players. In January, the Magpies signed former England international Kieran Trippier, along with promising Brazilian midfielder Bruno Guimaraes, and a few others. At the time, they also appointed Eddie Howe as their new manager.</p>
<p>The revolution proved successful quickly afterward – Newcastle got away from the relegation zone, eventually finishing in the #11 position in the Prem.</p>
<p>This season, their ambitions are even high. No surprise there, as they’ve completed a few more amazing transfers during the summer transfer window. Goalkeeper Nick Pope came to Newcastle from Burnley, defender Sven Botman signed from Lille, while wing-back Matt Target inked a permanent deal after a six-month loan from Aston Villa.</p>
<p>Knowing all this, no one should be surprised that Newcastle is seen as favorite in the clash with Nottingham Forest, a team that’s playing its first Premier League game in the 21st century on Saturday.</p>
<p>Nottingham Forest Fired Up for Their First EPL Game</p>
<p>Even though The Tricky Trees are one of the oldest soccer clubs on the planet – founded back in 1878 – they haven’t been great in the last couple of decades.</p>
<p>In fact, before qualifying for the Premier League through the Championship Playoffs last season, they had spent more than 20 years playing in the lower echelons of the English soccer league system.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for them, it seems they’re not going to stay in the Prem for too long. Actually, online betting sites see Nottingham Forrest as a top relegation candidate with the betting odds of +125.</p>
<p>Newcastle vs Nottingham Forest Prediction</p>
<p>Oddsmakers have every right to think of Newcastle as the favorite in Saturday’s game. However, we think they’re not going to have an easy job against motivated Nottingham Forrest. The visitors are going to fight back, that’s for sure.</p>
<p>Still, that probably isn’t going to bring them any points. Instead, Newcastle will probably win, but not with a huge score difference.</p>
<p>Picks: Newcastle to win; under 2.5 goals</p>
