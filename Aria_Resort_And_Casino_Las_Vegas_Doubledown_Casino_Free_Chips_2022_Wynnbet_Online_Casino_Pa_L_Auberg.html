    <h1>Aria Resort And Casino Las Vegas Doubledown Casino Free Chips 2022 Wynnbet Online Casino Pa L Auberg</h1>

<p>Hello Tomas let me start by saying thank u for taking on my complaint it's been very frustrating to say the least. So the only withdrawal awl option available to me is a wire transfer their form which I've filled out 6 times wants name of bank international routing number account number date I opened my account address of bank (but I bank online so I included the address of the branch closest to me. My bank by the way is Chase bank. They ask for a swift number but when I enter Chase bank it automatically pops up so that has to be right. Anyways when putting in for withdrawal this form pops up and if it isn't all filled out the option to withdrawal button doesn't light up and so u can't s nd in your withdrawl till everything is filled out. So if it was true that they don't have my banking info my question is is where did it go I filled up this warm six times and six different times they say they don't have the info but but if I hadn't filled out the form with my banking info then I wouldn't have been able to put in for this withdrawal and I can't get them to understand this. So then I've sent them emails to the finance department separate from my withdrawal form that I filled out with attachments of copies of my bank statements my phone bill because they wanted proof of address and my ID a picture of my ID me holding my ID and I sent this several times Each time I was denied I was never contacted by the casino . I kept checking account online and my 600 would be in my account and my pending withdrawal denied that's how I would find out.</p>
