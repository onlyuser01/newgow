<p>Played at Bethpage State Park’s Black Course, the 15-time major winner is at 10/1 to hoist the Wanamaker Trophy come Sunday evening. The difficult track was the site of Woods’ 2002 US Open victory where he won by three shots.</p>
<p>The Westgate SuperBook has the 10/1 odds shared with world No. 1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – winner of the 2018 PGA. A $100 bet and either of those three players winning nets $1,000.</p>
<p>Other favorites include Rory McIlroy (12/1), Rickie Fowler (16/1), and Justin Rose and Jon Rahm at 18/1.</p>
<p>The PGA Championship is an all-professional major. Twenty club pros gain qualification through the PGA Professional National Championship. Alex Beach, the winner of that event, is at 3,000/1 against the touring professionals this week. Just a $5 wager returns $15,000 on those odds.</p>
<p>Tiger Hangover?</p>
<p>Tiger Woods is back inside the ropes for the first time since his Masters triumph last month in Augusta, Georgia. Woods arrived last week aboard his 155-foot yacht in Oyster Bay. The $20 million vessel will serve as Woods’ accommodations this week, just as he did during last year’s US Open at nearby Shinnecock Hills Golf Club.</p>
<p>Golf analysts predict Woods will be refreshed and ready for the tough test Bethpage Black will present beginning Thursday.</p>
<p>Tiger will be good and ready, and I expect that to be plenty good enough for a top 10. Of course, he could win, but this will be both a deeper field and a tougher venue for Tiger’s game (more strain on the driver),” Golf.com contributor Josh Sens said this week.</p>
<p>Sens concluded, “Recoveries of the kind he made in the Masters (birdies after wild tee shots on 14 the first two rounds, for instance) will be harder to come by. I don’t see him as the odds-on favorite but we’ll see plenty of him over the weekend.”</p>
<p>The bettor who risked $85,000 on Tiger winning the Masters was handsomely rewarded to the tune of $1.19 million. He’s doubled down by risking $100,000 on Woods winning the next three majors to accomplish the season modern Grand Slam – a feat that’s never been accomplished. If he does win the PGA, US Open, and Open Championship, the bet will return $10 million.</p>
<p>Other notable PGA odds include Adam Scott (50/1), Phil Mickelson (60/1), and 2009 US Open at Bethpage winner Lucas Glover (125/1).</p>
<p>Romo Fumbles Byron Nelson</p>
<p>Former NFL quarterback Tony Romo received a sponsor’s exemption into last week’s AT&amp;T Byron Nelson Championship. He had the longest odds of the 156-player field at 10,000/1.</p>
<p>The SuperBook said it printed more tickets on Romo than any other player. The CBS Sports analyst also led in money wagered. After rounds of 76 and 74, Romo missed the cut by 10 shots.</p>
<p>Sung Kang won the event with rounds of 65-61-68-67. He entered the week at 125/1, meaning every $100 risked returned $12,500.</p>
