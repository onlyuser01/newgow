<p>Hello Nick.</p>
<p>The account has been successfully verified.</p>
<p>I had an amount of 9500€ on my account. Wanted to arrange a payout this time of €4500 but unfortunately it didn't work because according to the Four Crowns it was still being processed, i.e. the first payout of €5000.</p>
<p>so far this has not been credited to my account. I wrote support often. There was also no violation according to the terms and conditions I built on.</p>
<p>Have taken everything into account, such as the minimum deposit of €200 if you win more money. Otherwise under 200 € it is only 10 times as much according to the general terms and conditions.</p>
<p>I didn't play any higher than it was allowed to, i.e. 5 euros.</p>
<p>according to the terms and conditions you can only pay out 5000€ a week, which also didn't work as mentioned above. I multiplied the €4500 to €50 with the hope that at least the payment of €5000 would go into my account.</p>
<p>after a very long research I saw that this site often carries out fraudulent activities.</p>
<p>And unfortunately a lot of people didn't get their money.</p>
<p>I can only ask everyone else not to play online at all anymore because you will only be cheated.</p>
<p>I had exactly the same problem at Platin-Casino, several thousand deposited around €30,000 with a profit of €5500 was not put across. Until you finally gambled away the money. Local casinos have much higher potential to withdraw winnings.</p>
<p>ps. There is immediate payout without discussion. I will no longer deposit online after this promotion! Because it's the biggest scam I've ever seen.</p>
<p>Best regards</p>
<p>KINGSOUF</p>
<p>"There was no disregard of the terms and conditions"</p>
