<p>The focus in the United States is now on player acquisition as sports betting and iGaming are exploding across the nation. As this process continues with uncharacteristic expedience, concerns about problem gambling and treatment services options arise, and this is where private operators have decided to step up.</p>
<p>Connecticut’s Operators Pitch in to Bolster Responsible Gambling</p>
<p>In a press release, the Connecticut Council on Problem Gambling thanked FanDuel, PlaySugarHouse, and DraftKings for contributing to the organization in a bid to bolster its war chest allocated to tackling the issue. Commenting on the donations, CCPG executive director Diana Goode said:</p>
<p>“Responsible gambling initiatives are vital to helping protect people who choose to play. We appreciate the support of DraftKings, FanDuel, and PlaySugarHouse in funding these important programs.” CCPG executive director Diana Goode</p>
<p>The grants are meant to help the CCPG advance its cause, which is to protect at-risk and vulnerable individuals, and their families, from the harmful impact gambling may have on them. This is why DraftKings, and others, have contributed to the organization’s mission as they continue to shape their own efforts to continuously address the issue.</p>
<p>DraftKings head of senior director of responsible gaming Chrissy Thurmond has welcomed the opportunity to support the CCPG and their advocacy for safer and responsible gambling environments. The company is already running the DraftKings State Council Funding Program to ensure that consumers in the United States are aware of what the best gambling practices are.</p>
<p>Thurmond also reminded us that DraftKings is built on the premise of a safe, responsible, and sustainable gambling which puts consumer well-being first. The CCPG is committed to communicating key messages that have proven efficient in other regulated markets to consumers, such as quitting their gaming sessions when it’s no longer enjoyable, setting time and deposit limits, and generally sticking to a budget.</p>
<p>FanDuel Group VP of responsible gambling Adam Warrington commended the Connecticut Council on Problem Gambling and its commitment to responsible gambling. Warrington assured that he too sought to ensure that FanDuel is a referral benchmark for what it means to be a responsible gambling operator in the United States.</p>
<p>All Stakeholders Agree on the Importance of Responsible Gambling</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the CCPG has doubled down on ensuring that locals are aware of responsible gambling practices through new dedicated programming. Boosting awareness is a complex matter, though, and it involves participation from everyone, including industry stakeholders, state agencies, and not least treatment centers.</p>
<p>PlaySugarHouse director of corporate social responsibility Tammi M. Barlow welcomed the opportunity to collaborate with CCPG. Barlow said that PlaySugarHouse spares no effort in helping its own team members understand the importance of responsible gambling in the long term. That is why customer care services are trained to understand the issue better and ensure that they can protect those that are at risk.</p>
