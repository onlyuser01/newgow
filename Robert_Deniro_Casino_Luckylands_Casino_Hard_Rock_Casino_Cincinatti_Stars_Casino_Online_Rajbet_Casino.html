    <h1>Robert Deniro Casino Luckylands Casino Hard Rock Casino Cincinatti Stars Casino Online Rajbet Casino</h1>

<p>I am still waiting for verification and I sent them everything they need on 9/16/22 on 9/19/22 they said the back of my license wasn’t clear enough so I sent them 10 more photos of the back of my ID on the 19th in there system it says all my documents have been approved but I still get the red screen stating I can’t cash out so I can’t even request a withdrawal now I understand that casinos may have a legitimate reason for stalling just as you mentioned for a gentleman out of California and they are hoping we blow it but I was promised every day this week via text phone call or email that it would be done the next day or the earliest and shortest of time I deposited by Bitcoin and I’m at my max cash out for the promotion so they keep sending me my cash back or no deposit free spins and all these great promos but I can’t do anything with them until I can do a withdrawal I would gladly deposit more bitcoin or would have every day this past week and be playing and when ever they could pay me is fine I also deposited $75 of bitcoin after the amount I’ve shown in my account because Chloe and Lilly said it would stay separate and the newly deposited bitcoin won’t interfere with the money on my account well guess what is went straight on type of the amount that I already had on my account so now it’s been a week that I can’t play or get my free play cash back or new promos I have all screenshots emails and phone calls documented and the toll free number goes through a couple of local exchange companies to a number in Malaysia fyi and it’s a tiny set-up and I’m working with a friend who is my local congressman to get the toll free number shut down if they are going to defraud people and I retired from the company myself and I understand there entire set-up how you have them at an 8.2 rating is beyond me and that’s why I chose them basically and I planned on making them my only casino because I love the games they offer and I play every single day for hours so they obviously have to be a fraudulent company because why would they make it to where I can’t even play anymore until I withdrawal I even asked in increase my withdrawal limit and I’ll continue playing so in the meantime since I stopped playing with them I spent 3k at other casinos and don’t like the games and that money would have gone to them I have screenshots of texts copies of all emails and 100% documentation I’m asking for them to allow me to cash out / withdrawal and I’ll be on my way this isn’t my first rodeo and in there website it says if you deposited with bitcoin and you withdraw with bitcoin it’s 24 to 48hrs well it seems they decided hey if we don’t get verification we can’t cash out , thank you for your assistance</p>
