    <h1>Riverside Casino Laughlin Wild Casino Review Downstream Casino Hotel St Croix Casino Turtle Lake Hot</h1>

<p>The Australian slot machine supplier has strengthened its non-executive team with the addition of Novomatic’s largest shareholder and deputy chairman</p>
<p>Haig Asenbauer, who is a lawyer by profession and works as a partner at Asenbauer Rechtsanwaelte GmbH in Vienna, Austria, is also present with Novomatic AG, where he serves as deputy chair.</p>
<p>Asenbauer Brings Value and Expertise to Ainsworth at Time of Growth</p>
<p>Novomatic currently owns 52% of Ainsworth’s stock, which it acquired back in June 2021. In appointing Asenbauer, Ainsworth did file a notice with the Australian Stock Exchange, notifying that while the potential for conflicts of interest was there, the company would ensure that it observes strict governance protocols so that his involvement is limited to areas outside of those “conflict areas.”</p>
<p>Danny Gladstone, chairman at Ainsworth, welcomed Asenbauer and said that the man’s extensive knowledge would prove invaluable to the company. He referred to his successful track record with Novomatic and argued that having Asenbauer would add more skills and expertise.</p>
<p>Ainsworth, or Ainsworth Game Technology as the company is known by its full name, has been reporting good results of late. The company hit $84 million in revenue in the six months to December 31, 2022, which marked a 23.4% year-over-year increase.</p>
<p>The company reported strong performance across all of its geographies, reflective of the fact that Ainsworth has been doing well in its overall business relationships overseas. Latin American has yielded serious gains for the company, with Ainsworth gaining from the reopening of properties in Mexico and Peru.</p>
<p>Even back home, Ainsworth has been doing very well with New South Wales driving a good $22 million for the company during the reported period. Asenbauer steps in at a time when the company is experiencing a significant economic uptake which is likely to continue in the first half-year of 2023 as well.</p>
