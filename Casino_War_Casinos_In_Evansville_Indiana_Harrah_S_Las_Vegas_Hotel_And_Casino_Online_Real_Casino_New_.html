    <h1>Casino War Casinos In Evansville Indiana Harrah S Las Vegas Hotel And Casino Online Real Casino New</h1>

<p>The leading developer of innovative and engaging online slots, RAW iGaming, announced a new partnership that significantly boosted the reach of its quality titles. On Thursday, the company revealed it signed an agreement with the leading sportsbook software and iGaming platform provider, Digitain.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the new deal, Digitain's partners will now be able to access hit games from RAW iGaming. Renowned for their quality, innovation and unique experiences, the games provided by the leading iGaming content supplier deliver supreme entertainment with any spin.</p>
<p>RAW iGaming was able to achieve this by fusing successfully trademarked mechanics, unique bonus features, quality sound effects and striking design. Moreover, the supplier's games differ from the competition thanks to its narratives and characters that help build a story and ensure engaging experiences.</p>
<p>Tom Wood, RAW iGaming's Founder and CEO, revealed in a statement that the company was able to stand out from the competition thanks to its unique development philosophy that dares the players to try something new. "Players like to try new things, but they are not willing to spend time and money learning something entirely new. They want to play, and they want to be entertained, and we ensure thatâ€™s the case when they engage with any one of our titles," he added.</p>
<p>Finally, Wood pointed out: "This partnership with Digitain is a big step forward as it significantly increases the reach of our games among prestigious operators as well as challenger brands looking for something new."</p>
<p>Per the new agreement, Digitain gained access to RAW iGaming's complete portfolio of games. Such include popular titles like Raging Super2Ways, Ave Caesar along with Twisted Toy Tales, the iGaming supplier's latest release. Moreover, Digitain tapped into thrilling and innovative titles from RAW iGaming such as SuperSymbols, SuperTracks and SuperSlice.</p>
<p>The aforementioned games represent the iGaming supplier's flagship innovations, with SuperTracks using pathways or tracks to determine wins while SuperSlice uses wheels instead of reels. Moreover, SuperSymbols awards prizes by combining and matching symbols, granting a chance for exceptional prizes.</p>
<p>The latest deal with RAW iGaming complements Digitain's dedication to delivering innovative and unique games to its growing portfolio of partners. While the collaboration expands the offering via Digitain's platform, it also helps the iGaming provider's games to reach new audiences across the globe, bringing unique experiences.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, RAW iGaming inked another content agreement, teaming up with NetBet Italy. Under the terms of that deal, the company propelled its European presence by delivering a wide range of games for the Italian gaming and betting operator.</p>
