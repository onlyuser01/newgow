<p>Leading online sports betting company offering in-play betting and live streaming bet365 has announced its decision to become the official betting partner of the all-women boxing event in September. The event that will take place at the London O2 Arena on the 10th will be a pioneer of its kind, as it will be the first televised boxing event exclusively dedicated to female boxers. Bet365 will take advantage of its existing relationship with boxing promotional firm Boxxer to show its support for the all-women line-up. The main event of the evening will be the middleweight match between Claressa Shields and Savannah Marshall.</p>
<p>The Fight of the Year</p>
<p>Marshall’s manager Mick Hennessy spoke about the much-anticipated event describing it as one that has the potential “to be the fight of the year worldwide”. bet365 used the voice of its spokesperson to explain that the event will be broadcast live on Sky Sports with the help of its partners at Boxxer. bet365 has also called the event a “defining moment in women’s sport”, as well as an event that the company is “extremely proud to be a part of”.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the year, Claressa “T-Rex” Shields made history as the quickest boxer (both female and male) to scoop up titles in three different divisions at 154, 160, and 168. Shields needed ten fights to reach that highly-praised distinction. She also beat Vasiliy Lomachenko’s and Kosei Tanaka’s records, who won three titles in 12 fights. T-Rex is also the only boxer in history, both male or female, to hold all four major boxing world titles: World Boxing Association, World Boxing Council, International Boxing Federation, and World Boxing Organization.</p>
<p>Savannah “Silent Assassin” Marshall has been holding on to the World Boxing Organization female middleweight title for over ten years. As an amateur boxer, she turned into the pioneer British female world champion after winning gold during the World Championships in 2012. As of October 2020, she is the second-best active female middleweight boxer on the planet and also the fifth active super-middleweight boxer.</p>
<p>What Will the Event Mean for bet365?</p>
<p>According to the terms of the agreement, bet365 will have its branding material generously displayed all throughout pre-promotional events such as open workouts, press conferences, or official weigh-ins. The company will also benefit from extensive exposure inside the boxing arena on the night of the event, with its brand name marked on all corners, ring canvas, ropes screens, and barriers.</p>
<p>Bet365 will also offer exclusive odds and a plethora of in-play opportunities via the official Boxxer website. Its branding will also be used throughout Boxxer’s online and social media channels, while streams showing Boxxer events will become available in chosen territories via the bet365 platform.</p>
<p>In June, bet365 became the Professional Golfers’ Association Tour’s official betting operator.</p>
