<p>The current deal is in line with Betsson’s ambition to cement itself as a leading name in the online casino industry</p>
<p>Games Global, a leading name within the iGaming content industry, has expanded its existing strategic relationship with the leading online casino operator Betsson Group. Under the deal, the former company will onboard Games Global’s premium live casino experiences to its vast portfolio.</p>
<p>To that end, Games Global will leverage its OnAir Entertainment studio to inject cutting-edge live casino games and game shows into Betsson’s product offering. This agreement will allow the provider to expand its reach while bolstering the operators’ industry-leading library of gaming content.</p>
<p>As a result, Betsson will be able to enhance its live casino portfolio with some of OnAir Entertainment’s best titles, including the upcoming show Travel Fever and beloved classics such as Blackjack, Roulette and Auto Roulette, among others.</p>
<p>The current deal is in line with Betsson’s ambition to cement itself as a leading name in the online casino industry. The company leverages a multi-brand strategy to expand its footprint in multiple markets at once.</p>
<p>This deal follows an earlier content agreement between Betsson and Hacksaw Gaming which saw the latter company supply its out-of-the-box games to the operator’s business in Spain. In November, on the other hand, Betsson Group tapped into FutureAnthem’s Amplifier AI as it sought to protect its players from gambling harm.</p>
<p>The Deal Will Benefit Both Betsson and Its Players</p>
<p>OnAir Entertainment reflects Betsson Group’s commitment to exceed player expectations and go above and beyond. The chief revenue officer of Games Global, Julie Allison, commented on the new tie-up, saying that it attests to her team’s desire to offer only high-quality products and best-in-class live casino offerings.</p>
<p>Together, we are crafting an experience that not only excites players but also sets a new standard for industry collaboration and support. Jullie Allison, CRO, Games Global</p>
<p>Betsson Group’s live casino manager, Chellyanne Cassar, also commented on the matter. She said that the casino company is very excited about this new partnership with OnAir Entertainment. According to Cassar, the new deal promises to provide benefits to both her company and its players.</p>
<p>Gaining access to OnAir Entertainment’s entire live casino game portfolio represents a remarkable leap forward for us. Chellyanne Cassar, live casino manager, Betsson Group</p>
<p>Earlier this year, OnAir Entertainment bolstered its capabilities by launching a brand-new studio in Georgia.</p>
