<p>Gamban, a company that provides cutting-edge self-exclusion and blocking software intended to help vulnerable and at-risk gamblers, has teamed up with Svenska Spel, a Swedish gambling operator that will seek to utilize the former’s expertise in helping minimize gambling harm and setting players on a journey to recovery. The partnership is signed for a period of five years.</p>
<p>Svenska Spel will offer the Gamban app for free to its customers and players who want to be in control of their gambling habits or suspect that their habits have gone too far and are part of an overall push in the country to ensure that harmful gambling revenue and gambling addiction are minimized.</p>
<p>On a national level, Sweden is deploying Spelpaus, an initiative that is designed to help Swedish consumers battle problem gambling through self-exclusion. Awareness of the solution has been high enough, but further efforts are being made continuously.</p>
<p>Svenska Spel has welcomed the opportunity to further enhance this process, with company Responsible Gambling Specialist Daniel Harre arguing that Gamban would be able to provide additional and crucial services in this vein over the coming years, with the opportunity to extend the collaboration.</p>
<p>The self-exclusion app and service previously became the first state-wide used solution in Ohio, as the state has announced its determination to combat harmful gambling, which is seen to be originating from the surging popularity of regulated gambling.</p>
<p>At the same time, Sweden has some of the highest participation in terms of gamblers in the country, but still manages to keep the numbers of problem gambling low, not least because of the state’s concentrated efforts to make sure this is the case. According to a recent study, 3 in 4 people in Sweden actually participate in gambling.</p>
<p>Matt Zarb-Cousin, Director of External Affairs at Gamban, has similarly welcomed the opportunity to work with Svenska Spel and help contribute to keeping the rates of problem gambling low.</p>
<p>"We are excited to be working with Svenska Spel to provide market-leading blocking software to people wanting to stop gambling. This partnership reflects Svenska Spel’s commitment to all of their customers playing in a fun, safe and healthy way," Zarb-Cousin added.</p>
