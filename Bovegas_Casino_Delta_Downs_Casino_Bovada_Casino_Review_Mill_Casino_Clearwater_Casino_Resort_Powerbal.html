    <h1>Bovegas Casino Delta Downs Casino Bovada Casino Review Mill Casino Clearwater Casino Resort Powerbal</h1>

<p>The jackpot from the popular lottery game is expected to hit $255 million for the drawing scheduled for this Wednesday</p>
<p>Monday marked the latest drawing of America’s most popular lottery game, Powerball. Despite high hopes, no one was able to guess correctly all white balls, 24, 33, 35, 37, 42, along with the red Powerball, 21 from the recent draw. As a result, the grand prize for the lottery game continues to grow.</p>
<p>The last time the jackpot from Powerball was hit was back in October. At the time, a lucky player from California secured the staggering $1.76 billion grand prize by guessing correctly all winning numbers. Considering the odds of winning the jackpot, which is 1 in 292.2 million, the lucky player from California will undoubtedly never forget October 11, 2023, the date of the drawing when they hit the jackpot.</p>
<p>Now, a month has passed since the grand prize was won and so far, no one has been able to correctly guess all winning numbers. This enabled the jackpot to continue growing and it is expected to hit $255 million for the drawing set for Wednesday, November 15, 2023. While this sum represents annual installment payments, if a lucky lottery player selects a lump cash sum, they can pocket $117.1 million. Whatever the case is, the grand prize represents a life-changing sum for anyone.</p>
<p>Single Ticket Wins $1M from the Latest Drawing</p>
<p>It’s no surprise that the largest number of prizes secured from the drawing on Monday were for the lowest-tier prize. Nearly 200,000 people who guessed correctly the red Powerball secured a $4 prize each, while more than 68,000 took home an $8 Power Play prize each. Guessing correctly one white ball and the red Powerball granted a $4 prize to more than 78,000 lottery players while nearly 27,000 took home an $8 Power Play Prize each.</p>
<p>Focusing on the bigger prizes, a single lucky player guessed correctly all five white balls. This granted them a prize of $1 million from the drawing on Monday. On the other hand, a third-tier prize of $50,000 each was collected by seven lottery players who guessed correctly four white balls along with the red Powerball. Five lucky winners who also guessed such numbers secured a Power Play prize of $100,000 each.</p>
<p>Last week, a lucky man from Albuquerque hit the jackpot from Lotto America. The man secured the prize from the drawing on November 4, 2023, taking home the staggering $3.52 million jackpot. While the person had the option to use randomly generated numbers, he decided to pick them himself and used them for Lotto America, Powerball and Mega Millions tickets.</p>
