<p>In a bid to strengthen the fight against sports corruption and uphold the integrity of sports betting, SOFTSWISS Sportsbook, a cutting-edge sports betting software platform, has recently forged a significant partnership with the esteemed Sportradar Integrity Exchange, a leading global anti-match-fixing organization.</p>
<p>SOFTSWISS Sportsbook Gains Critical Insights from Sportradar Integrity Exchange</p>
<p>By teaming up with the Sportradar Integrity Exchange, SOFTSWISS Sportsbook is demonstrating its commitment to maintaining the highest standards of transparency, fairness, and ethical conduct in the industry.</p>
<p>One of the key benefits of this dynamic partnership is access to insightful reports and overviews that address critical issues related to match-fixing and sports corruption. Both monthly and quarterly reports on global match-fixing activity will be furnished, providing up-to-date information on the latest trends in result-fixing across the world. These reports are invaluable tools in identifying suspicious activities and early warning systems against questionable betting patterns.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the partnership entitles SOFTSWISS Sportsbook to receive overviews of suspicious activities, enabling them to stay ahead in the fight against corruption. The availability of annual trend reports, supported by data-driven insights into match-fixers’ targets, empowers the risk management teams to proactively investigate and prevent any potential suspicious activities.</p>
<p>The partnership ensures a two-way information exchange, with Sportradar’s partners receiving regular reports on global suspicious activity, markets targeted by match-fixers, unique problem areas to be vigilant about, and insider information and regulatory support.</p>
<p>SOFTSWISS Sportsbook’s Head Expresses Determination in Safeguarding Sports Integrity</p>
<p>Alexander Kamenetskyi, the head of SOFTSWISS Sportsbook, expressed his enthusiasm for the partnership, stating: “We are determined to make a positive impact on the sports betting industry by taking a proactive stance against match-fixing and safeguarding the integrity of sports. Together with the Sportradar Integrity Exchange, we aim to foster a secure betting environment for all stakeholders.”</p>
<p>As part of the collaboration, both organizations will engage in regular monitoring of relevant information concerning sports corruption, match-fixing, anti-doping measures, and safeguarding. The SOFTSWISS Sportsbook team will actively participate in gathering and analyzing data from public sources, providing essential intelligence on specific situations involving individuals or organizations.</p>
<p>As the SOFTSWISS Sportsbook continues to provide exclusive industry bonuses and enhanced capabilities for clients, this partnership marks a critical milestone in its journey towards becoming a standard-bearer for fair and secure sports betting experiences.</p>
<p>SOFTSWISS’s commitment to security has also been proven by the fact that its anti-fraud team saved operators €16 million ($17.8 million) in 2022, with 70% of fraud attempts thwarted being related to bonus abuse.</p>
<p>In other news, SOFTSWISS partnered with Livespins, a unique platform that allows players to watch streamers play in real-time and participate by betting on every round with the streamer, enhancing the gaming experience and offering seamless integration through SOFTSWISS Casino Platform for partner casinos.</p>
