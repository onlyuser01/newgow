<p>EvenBet Gaming, a leading software solutions provider for online businesses, released a new report, outlining some of the biggest trends and priorities for gambling operators and vendors within the industry.</p>
<p>EvenBet Gaming Releases New White Paper</p>
<p>The recent report, called the Hottest iGaming Trends, reveals trends and challenges identified by EvenBet Gaming’s content and marketing team via discussions with partners and operators during different events. The company compiled the answers into a report and vowed that this will not be the only such edition. Instead, EvenBet said that the white paper will undergo an update near the end of the year.</p>
<p>A key trend identified by respondents in the recent white paper for the third quarter of 2022 was crypto. Cryptocurrency, crypto payment options and other crypto-related topics were identified as the most mentioned iGaming trend in Q3 2022 by participants in the white paper. According to the recent report, the “global crypto population” hit nearly 300 million as of December 2021, marking a staggering increase of 178%.</p>
<p>Additionally, EvenBet’s white paper identified that the crypto growth continues further this year. Service providers and vendors mentioned crypto more than operators. At the same time, the study identified that although the gambling industry is adaptive, banking has increasingly become more difficult.</p>
<p>“Maybe, the crypto will be going to save the industry in a few years,“ reads the recent white paper</p>
<p>Growth Remains a Key Priority for iGaming Companies</p>
<p>Although crypto was identified as a trend, it wasn’t a priority for the respondents that participate in the white paper. Growth within new markets, as well as expanding presence within existing markets were identified as main priorities for operators and vendors within the industry.</p>
<p>“Regulated markets are the future, but regulation delays innovation because we have to look at the different demands,“ explains the white paper</p>
<p>While growth was identified as a priority, the second-most mentioned trend was the increasing regulation within different jurisdictions. Both operators and vendors identified this trend as increasingly important. With that in mind, the report pointed out that while regulation is important, it can delay innovation.</p>
<p>“Everybody is looking out of Europe,“ reads EvenBet’s white paper</p>
<p>Focusing on growth and expansion to new jurisdictions, participants in the latest report identified Europe as the least desired location. Vendors as well as operators pointed out that the markets that hold significant iGaming growth potential are Asia, Latin America, as well as North America, “but almost never Europe.”</p>
