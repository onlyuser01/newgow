    <h1>Bay Mills Casino Red Hawk Casino Buffet Seminole Classic Casino Hollywood Hollywood Fl Buffalo Bill</h1>

<p>Tuesday, May 2, 2023, is when one of the hottest London Derbies is taking place at Emirates Stadium. That’s where title hopefuls Arsenal will try to exploit Chelsea’s horrible form</p>
<p>On Wednesday evening, Arsenal suffered a defeat to Manchester City in what may later prove to be the crucial game of the 2022-23 EPL season. Only five more rounds are left before the end of their Premier League campaign, but the Gunners still do have a chance to win the trophy for the first time in over two decades.</p>
<p>For that to happen, however, they need to get back onto the winning track ASAP. And this implies that they need to beat Chelsea on Tuesday.</p>

<p>The Gunners Need to Pull Themselves Together</p>
<p>Just a few weeks ago, Arsenal had a double-digit lead over Manchester City. However, as things currently stand, the chances are high that the Cityzens are going to defend their title. Unless something really strange happens in the remainder of the season, Pep Guardiola’s men will win the Premier League title.</p>
<p>Of course, the Gunners mustn’t think about this scenario. They need to hope that Manchester City will fail. But if they don’t, Mikel Arteta and his boys can only blame themselves. They had a chance to win the title battle last Wednesday, but they ended up losing to Manchester City.</p>
<p>Actually, that’s far from being their biggest sorrow in April. Before losing to Man City, we also saw them draw with Southampton, West Ham, and Liverpool. That said, they’re without a single win since the first day of April. That needs to change ASAP!</p>
<p>No One Knows What’s Going on With Chelsea</p>
<p>Despite spending half a billion dollars on transfers since buying the club, Todd Boehly simply cannot be satisfied with the investment. The thing is that his team’s been performing horribly this entire season, but especially in the last couple of weeks.</p>
<p>The Blues from London are without a single win since March 11 when they defeated Leicester City, a team that has worries of its own and is still concerned about relegation. The worst thing is that not only have they failed to win a single game in almost two months, but most of the time they played, they ended up losing. They even lost 2-0 at home to Brentford last Wednesday.</p>
<p>The main reason for this is that their offense has been nothing short of horrible. These guys just can’t get on target, but they keep on trying, which leaves their defense exposed to the counterattacks of their rivals.</p>
<p>Against Arsenal, we don’t think that’s going to be the case. Chelsea players are desperate for points even if it only meant getting a tiny confidence boost. That’s why we’re likely going to see them defend ferociously on Tuesday, looking for their chances on the counter and from set pieces.</p>
<p>Arsenal vs Chelsea Prediction</p>
<p>Both teams are out of form, but in the case of Arsenal, the problem is of a psychological nature. The Gunners probably understand that they’ve gambled away the title, which is why they probably won’t be too motivated against Chelsea. The Blues, on the other hand, would love to get one over their city rivals.</p>
<p>Pick: Chelsea to win; under 2.5 goals</p>
