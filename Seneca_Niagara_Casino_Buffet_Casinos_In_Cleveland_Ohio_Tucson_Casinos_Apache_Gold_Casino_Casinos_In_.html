<p>Efforts of the National Lottery Regulatory Commission (NLRC) in Nigeria continue to be focused on seeking collaboration with other governmental agencies and its recent call for cooperation was directed at the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit (NFIU).</p>
<p>NFIU Collaboration Mutually Beneficial</p>
<p>Looking to put an end to the channeling of players towards illegal gambling operators without recourse to the regulatory laws of the country, the NLRC is set to work hand in hand with the intelligence unit, the Director-General of NLRC, Lanre Gbajabiamila hinted in a courtesy call to the Director-CEO of the NFIU, Modibbo Hammam Tukur.</p>
<p>“We know that working with partners helps bring together available resources for the purpose of achieving more impact, greater sustainability and increased value to all stakeholders. Today the National Lottery Regulatory Commission is proud to call NFIU our partner.” Lanre Gbajabiamila, Director-General, NLRC</p>
<p>Earlier, NFIU’s Director-CEO had outlined the intelligence unit was ready to synergize efforts with the commission to fight illicit financial practices within the remit of the NLRC. Furthermore, Mr Tukur stated that certain activities of the commission could be integrated into the unit’s system to ensure effective collaboration.</p>
<p>The intelligence unit’s chief pinpointed issues such as capital flight, tax evasion, non-disclosure of financial transactions and movement of illicit funds as areas where both organizations could effectively collaborate and ensure great benefits to all Nigerians.</p>
<p>“Recently, we signed a Memorandum of Understanding with NFIU that aims to combat money laundering and terrorism financing in the Nigerian Gaming sector. Our alliance and mutual cooperation are now more imperative, and as responsible agencies, it is our duty to keep pace with the dynamic and growing complexity of the modern lottery industry which features multi-channel availability, the electronic delivery of play, and complex financial transactions.” Lanre Gbajabiamila, Director-General, NLRC</p>
<p>The NLRC operates within the remits of the National Lottery Act 2005 with the task to regulate the operations of lottery business, promote transparency and accountability and protect the interests of players, stakeholders and the general public.</p>
<p>NLRC Determined to Deal with Offshore Gambling</p>
<p>The Director-General of the NLRC identified remote gaming as the biggest challenge for the commission and the gaming industry in Nigeria, expressing the NLRC’s resolve to overcome that challenge and the financial outflows it creates. Lanre Gbajabiamila further noted that the NLRC had been involved in a number of strategic collaborations with other governmental agencies to strengthen its operations.</p>
<p>“Our MOU marks an important milestone in this effort and ushers in an unprecedented level of mutual cooperation between our agencies.” Lanre Gbajabiamila, Director-General, NLRC</p>
<p>The NLRC joined forces with the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) in March, to fight “unscrupulous companies” from the gambling industry in the country. The commission sought to use the CAC’s register to cross-check candidates for lottery operations and strengthen its vetting procedures.</p>
