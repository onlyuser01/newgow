<p>Golden Matrix and Amelco announced the launch of a custom-build online sportsbook in India just as the IPL cricket is about to kick off.</p>
<p>Undisclosed First iGaming Operator</p>
<p>Golden Matrix Group announced Wednesday that it partnered with Amelco to launch its very first custom-built digital sportsbook platform with an existing undisclosed iGaming operator in a new market.</p>
<p>Golden Matrix did not reveal the name of the new platform’s first customer, but it did say that the client is an “established” operator. This is a major opportunity for the esports, social gaming, and white-label services provider, as it allows the company to reach one of the world’s largest markets with a fresh and compelling sports betting product, Golden Matrix CEO Brian Goodman declared.</p>
<p>The new sports betting platform will launch in India, right for the start of the new Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket season, Goodman noted. Cricket has between 2 and 3 billion fans across the world, including India, the UK, Pakistan, Asia, Sri Lanka, Zimbabwe, the West Indies, Australia, New Zealand, and Africa.</p>
<p>Future Launches Ahead for Golden Matrix</p>
<p>Golden Matrix has stated that it plans to implement and deploy the system with a range of new clients in foreign markets over the next month and a half, with the goal of obtaining authorization to operate in a number of US states later this year. The company announced the launch following a technology licensing and services deal with Amelco, a supplier of sports betting platforms, in late 2020. Amelco’s full-coverage product will be marketed and distributed to operators in controlled markets worldwide as part of the agreement.</p>
<p>Goodman noted that, since Golden Matrix’s deal with Amelco, there has been a surge in interest for the company’s dynamic sportsbook offer and management services from “current and prospective clients”.</p>
<p>“Fully integrated into our GM-X industry-leading B2B technology platform, this new sportsbook offering can now be deployed via numerous gaming operators globally.” Brian Goodman, Golden Matrix CEO</p>
<p>Golden Matrix filed with the SEC last month to seek up to $10 million in an initial public offering on Nasdaq. The provider also announced a partnership with Playtech in November, with the goal of expanding both companies’ share of the global esports and gambling industries.</p>
