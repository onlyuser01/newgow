    <h1>Longhorn Casino Walker S Bluff Casino Resort Motor City Casino Buffet Roobet Casino Are There Casino</h1>

<p>I am not sure if the player understands everything that we tried to explain, but - can you check the number of played rounds by him during the tournament and the number of rounds of the last place that received a prize within this campaign from this casino, and share them with us?</p>
<p>Since Evolution likely claim that these promotions are managed by casinos, but at the same time, you claim that Evolution directly managed the distribution of rewards to all the winners, it is a bit confusing.</p>
<p>Above, you mentioned that "Upon your inquiry, we reached out to Evolution to verify the user's score. They have confirmed that the user in question did not qualify as a winner." Can you please provide me with the mentioned communication between the casino and Evolution? It would be also highly appreciated if you could also share the list of players who participated in the tournament at BC.Game Casino and were placed on the leaderboard - the other players' IDs or "sensitive" details can be covered up.</p>
<p>Can you please provide me with a banner that was available on the casino website during the tournament or confirm that the amount of 200,000 was there? If so, it makes sense, but are we talking about a mistake in the casino's rules for this tournament? How much was paid by BC.Game casino or the provider to the winning players after the tournament was finished (the ones who participated in the tournament at BC.Game Casino)?</p>
<p>Can you please additionally share better screenshots, where we could see that the chat window is really located on Evolution's official website, or that the messages are from Evolution Gaming provider?</p>
<p>However, if Evolution recommended you turn to the casino, the casino provided you with the information that you are not eligible for any prize and explained the situation to you (not storing such data), what else do you expect from us to do?</p>
<p>It looks like they directed you to the casino for more information, but it does not mean they do not know about tournaments at all.</p>
<p>How did you understand from the screenshots above that Evolution did not know about tournaments?</p>
