<p>Online gambling industry software and content provider CT Interactive announced a new deal with GrooveGaming, a leading aggregator within the iGaming industry. Although details of the new partnership emerged last week, CT Interactive confirmed that the collaboration was finalized during ICE London 2023, one of the most-anticipated events within the gaming sector for the year.</p>
<p>Per the terms of the new partnership, CT Interactive agreed to provide its leading content for GrooveGaming. Thanks to this deal, the aggregator further expands its offering by delivering new and engaging content from CT Interactive. At the same time, for CT Interactive, the partnership helps expand the reach of the company's portfolio to new customers and markets.</p>
<p>Yahale Meltzer, GrooveGaming's COO and co-founder, shared his excitement in a statement saying: "The products that CT Interactive offers are very high quality." He explained that the company created games that cater to a wide audience making them attractive to different player types. In conclusion, Meltzer said: "We are sure that our customers would appreciate the diversity of their content and enjoy the new games."</p>
<p>Milena Tsankarska, CT Interactive's Head of Business Development EMEA, was similarly excited about the partnership. "During the years GrooveGaming has won the reputation of one of the top platforms for casino content," she said. Finally, Tsankarska pointed out: "We are very happy that our content will become available for more clients worldwide, and we plan to continue supplying the platform with our new games."</p>
<p>The collaboration with GrooveGaming coincided with another announcement by CT Interactive. Again last week, the company expanded its presence in the Czech Republic, via a deal with Casino Kartac, an online gambling operator. The deal saw CT Interactive introduce its content for customers of the online operator in the country.</p>
<p>Before that, back in January, the company inked a deal with AdmiralBet Montenegro, a leading sports betting and online casino operator. That deal saw the popular content from CT Interactive arrive to customers of the operator. The collaboration helped grow further the company's global footprint within the iGaming vertical.</p>
<p>January marked another important deal for CT Interactive as the company expanded the reach of its games to Bulgaria via a partnership with BetMarket. As a result, popular content from the company reached new clients in the country where CT Interactive is headquartered.</p>
<p>It was back in 2012 when CT Interactive was founded. Since then, the company has been continuously growing and now offers a growing portfolio of more than 200 unique and engaging games.</p>
