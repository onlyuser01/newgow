    <h1>Plaza Hotel And Casino Las Vegas Las Vegas Colorado Belle Casino Resort Cafe Casino Bonus Codes Dela</h1>

<p>Hi, I moved your post under the casino you are talking about.</p>
<p>As for your withdrawal, I can see what reason the casino gave you for it, but I think you've been waiting too long when you say it's been a month. However, when you made a withdrawal in the past and got your money after 2 weeks, did you have the same problem or was it something else ?</p>
<p>Anyway, I think lodging a complaint was a good move as we give casinos 14 days to resolve a withdrawal. Let's see where our team gets to and I really hope that this situation can be resolved and you will get your money. If you have any update, let us know.</p>
