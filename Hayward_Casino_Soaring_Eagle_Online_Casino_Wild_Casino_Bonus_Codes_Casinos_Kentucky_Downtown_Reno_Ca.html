    <h1>Hayward Casino Soaring Eagle Online Casino Wild Casino Bonus Codes Casinos Kentucky Downtown Reno Ca</h1>

<p>He there.</p>
<p>You got it wrong...</p>
<p>I would like to see the prescreen of the whole email - exactly as I wrote before, so the sender, date, and other details are visible + the second version from the Scatterhall. Both screenshots showing all details in one place, so both can be easily compared. Honestly, it would only approve that the casino used the same series or payment provider - nothing more. I read your complaint be sure of that, if I'm not mistaken you wrote yourself you can't provide evidence showing you got confirmation from the Wild Pharao while dealing with the Scatterhall, right? So, what's the point? What else am I supposed to see in your complaint?</p>
<p>The transcript inserted in the forum post is not a piece of evidence - I can insert a falsely composed email myself. The same goes for the cropped printscreen, I can create one myself in the picture creator.</p>
<p>One partially cropped screenshot does not prove anything, in my books.</p>
<p>Though I admit there are amazing similarities between those two casinos. A few weeks ago, I asked our data team personally, to investigate those similarities. In the end, we were simply told by the casino representative there is no connection.</p>
<p>Nothing else I can do.</p>
<p>Every player with delayed payment or other issues is welcomed to submit a complaint.</p>
