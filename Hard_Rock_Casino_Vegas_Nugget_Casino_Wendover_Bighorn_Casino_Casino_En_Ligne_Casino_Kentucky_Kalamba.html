    <h1>Hard Rock Casino Vegas Nugget Casino Wendover Bighorn Casino Casino En Ligne Casino Kentucky Kalamba</h1>

<p>Kalamba Games has appointed Marie Claire Aquilina as its new financial director. This marks the latest expansion move by the company which is looking to strengthen its management team while pivoting towards broader geographical reach and output.</p>
<p>Kalamba Games Brings More Talent to Spearhead Growth</p>
<p>Aquilina is a seasoned veteran who is joining the company at a time of rapid commercial growth. In her new role, Aquilina will use the vast industry-related experience she has accumulated having performed in similar S-tier companies from the iGaming sector, including Relax Gaming where she served as a financial controller for more than a decade. Commenting on her appointment, Aquilina said:</p>
<p>I’m delighted to be joining Kalamba Games and I’m grateful for the opportunity of working with their talented and enthusiastic team, as they continue to propel the business to new heights. Kalamba Games Financial Director Marie Claire Aquilina</p>
<p>Her appointment will bolster Kalamba’s commercial strategy and allow Aquilina to guide revenue strategies, oversee and improve efficiency, and boost accounting operations. Kalamba Games has vowed to continue adding more management heavyweights to its lineup as it seeks to continue building up its presence in the iGaming sector.</p>
<p>Aquilina’s appointment was welcomed by Kalamba Games CCO Andrew Crosby who reiterated that the new appointment comes at a time of “unprecedented expansion” for the company. He is confident that Aquilina’s experience will help steer Kalamba to even greater success.</p>
<p>“She brings with her a wealth of industry know-how and we’re looking forward to seeing the benefits that will bring,” Crosby explained. In September, Kalamba Games partnered with Bragg Gaming Group to expand in Ontario, Canada’s most populous province. This partnership was preceded by a similar move between the two companies when Kalamba Games and Bragg Gaming Group negotiated an expansion in regulated markets in the United States.</p>
<p>Kalamba’s geographical reach has see-sawed between all corners of the world with the company strengthening its reach in Latin America through an agreement with BetPlay in July targeting the Colombian iGaming market.</p>
