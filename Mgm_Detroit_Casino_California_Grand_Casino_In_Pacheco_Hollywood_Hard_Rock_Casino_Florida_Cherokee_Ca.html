    <h1>Mgm Detroit Casino California Grand Casino In Pacheco Hollywood Hard Rock Casino Florida Cherokee Ca</h1>

<p>SlotMatrix has become the latest company to join Livespins’ global revolution of the online gaming segment, bringing the supplier’s innovative content to the acclaimed streaming platform and vertical.</p>
<p>Owned by EveryMatrix, SlotMatrix is a content aggregation division within the company, which will now supercharge the Livespins offer by bringing more worthwhile games that can be explored by partners.</p>
<p>Livespins focus on building a robust social online casino experience that has taken the world by storm and that will now allow Livespins to distribute EveryMatrix games to its partners.</p>
<p>SlotMatrix content such as award-winning Aladdin’s Rollover Respins, Fairy Fantasy Exotic Wilds, Wild Willy’s Gold Rush, Hot Hot Honey, and The Lioness are all part of the available experiences that will now be distributed with Livespins’ help.</p>
<p>Livespins CCO Michael Pedersen was happy to see another big-ticket name such as Livespins join the company’s efforts in making the online casino segment more fun and rewarding. He said:</p>
<p>The big-name provider partnerships just keep on coming. We are thrilled to welcome SlotMatrix to Livespins and for its games content to reach and engage an entirely new audience of players via our award-winning platform.</p>
<p>Livespins has been able to achieve an unmatched level of engagement with audiences. The company’s product essentially allows streamers to broadcast live in a casino platform. The technological solution makes it possible for viewers to watch and also place wagers at the same time as the streamers.</p>
<p>There is no obligation to place the same amount as is being played on camera, however, as Livespins allow casino fans to adjust the size of their own stakes as they see fit, promoting a safe, healthy, and responsible play along the way. Thanks to this, Livespins has been able to engage with Millennial and Generation Z demographics in a way that few other companies have had success with.</p>
<p>SlotMatrix CEO, Games, Razvan Haiduc was also excited about the opportunity to see his company join forces with Livespins, highlighting how impactful this move is and the immediate access SlotMatrix would gain to new audiences.</p>
<p>He called Livespins’ model a groundbreaking paradigm in the way slot games are delivered to players and said that this newly-formed alliance would be an exhilarating ride. Livespins has recently signed partnerships with other prominent studios, including 4ThePLayer and Reevo.</p>
