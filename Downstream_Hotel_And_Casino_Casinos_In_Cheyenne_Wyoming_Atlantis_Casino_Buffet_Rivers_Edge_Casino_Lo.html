    <h1>Downstream Hotel And Casino Casinos In Cheyenne Wyoming Atlantis Casino Buffet Rivers Edge Casino Lo</h1>

<p>Britain’s Gambling Commission (UKGC) reported that problem gambling rates remain at 0.2%. This number is based on the Commission’s latest survey which saw it question 4,018 locals.</p>
<p>Overall Rates Remain Low</p>
<p>The UKGC questioned its respondents by phone and inquired about their gambling. In accordance with the Problem Gambling Severity Index, the Commission asked three questions about their gaming habits. Respondents were asked to provide insight into how often they have played in the last twelve months.</p>
<p>Based on the results of the survey, the Commission concluded that only 0.2% of British gamblers are exposed to harm. This is two times lower than what the results from last year’s study showed. Back then, 0.4% of the respondents were deemed to be problem gamblers.</p>
<p>Male bettors are more likely to experience gambling harm, according to the results. The research demonstrated that 0.3% of male gamblers are at risk, compared to only 0.1% of female gamblers.</p>
<p>Problem gambling among players aged 25-34 and players aged 35-44 sat at 0.3% and 0.2% respectively. Out of almost 600 bettors aged 55 to 64, none was experiencing any signs of harm. In comparison, younger bettors turned out to be much more prone to harm as 0.8% of the players aged 16-24 were what the Commission considers problem gamblers. The latter number is, sadly, higher than last year’s but not by a lot.</p>
<p>Harm More Prevalent Among the Youth</p>
<p>The most avid bettors are the 45-54 group. Almost half of those players (49.1%) said they gambled within the last month. Overall, 42.9% of all respondents had placed at least one wager within the past four weeks.</p>
<p>Out of all people, 25.8% placed at least one wager online for the period. This number was once again higher among the 45-54 year old bettors, with 33.2% having gambled online.</p>
<p>Lastly, the UKGC noted that 27.5% of all 4,018 players had used the National Lottery at least once during the past month.</p>
<p>Speaking of the Lottery, the UKGC is yet to hand the National Lottery license to Allwyn, a Czech company that is to inherit the mantle of a National Lottery operator from Camelot. Camelot, however, was not happy with the decision. Alongside IGT, one of its most influential partners, the current NL operator appealed the UKGC’s decision and barred the regulator from handing out the license.</p>
<p>UK’s High Court eventually lifted the suspension, only for it to be reinstituted two weeks later.</p>
