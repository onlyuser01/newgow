<p>Full-service customer acquisition and retention platform Chalkline announced a partnership with Digital Gaming Corporation (DGC) that will allow the free-to-play (F2P) game specialist to exclusively deliver its prediction games to fans in the US via Betway.</p>
<p>Boost Player Engagement</p>
<p>The new partnership with DGC will allow Betway to enhance its free-to-pay sports prediction games Betway Big Pick, bringing distinctive live-odds pick’em contests luring players to compete for cash, swag and prizes.</p>
<p>Commenting on the new partnership with Chalkline, Bruce Watermeyer, executive vice president of North America Operations at DGC outlined the continuous effort of the company to position “to engage with Betway players” nationwide by offering them “highly personalized experiences” via real gaming in the states where Betway is live and through Betway Big Pick in all the other US jurisdictions.</p>
<p>“This partnership with Chalkline is part of our path to continuously improve engagement with pre-match and live prediction contests around the games our customers love most,” Watermeyer concluded.</p>
<p>Starting with the 2022 NFL season, players at Betway Big Pick can begin making their weekly picks on games across all major sports leagues while Chalkline will provide them with more access to pre-match content, more live in-play prediction games and player prop parlay challenges.</p>
<p>Thrilled to enter this relationship with DGC, Daniel Kustelski, chief executive officer and co-founder of Chalkline stressed that DGC’s “ambitions for the Betway brand in the US” represent a “perfect fit for the Chalkline BettorGames platform.”</p>
<p>‘Transformative Gaming Experience’</p>
<p>“US sports fans deserve a premium, localized, and personalized free-to-play engagement as the market grows, and through their numerous partnerships with top-tier sports teams, DGC and Betway are uniquely positioned to offer a transformative gaming experience for fans,” he added.</p>
<p>Chalkline will leverage its unique technology backed by the company’s proprietary BettorBI suite that collects user-level data to inform faster, smarter and more profitable business decisions and deliver personalized, fully-hosted and mobile-first prediction games for Betway Big Pick.</p>
<p>For years since its inception in 2014, DGC has been offering first-class online casino content in the US and last year the business expanded into sports betting by launching the Betway sportsbook brand.</p>
<p>Currently, Betway is live in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Virginia, Arizona, Colorado, Indiana, and Iowa, and its scalable technology allows for fast and effective entry into new markets.</p>
<p>A member of several prominent industry bodies such as the International Betting Integrity Association, iGaming European Network, the Independent Betting Adjudication Service, US Integrity and the Betting and Gaming Council, Betway is providing its customers with a customized, fun, and informed betting experience within a safe, secure, fair, and responsible gaming environment.</p>
<p>Operating out of its offices in Nashville, Tennessee, London and Johannesburg, Chalkline has delivered more than 35,000 unique games to over 12 million global players.</p>
