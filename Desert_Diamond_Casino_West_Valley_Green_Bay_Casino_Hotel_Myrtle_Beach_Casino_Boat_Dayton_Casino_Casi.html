    <h1>Desert Diamond Casino West Valley Green Bay Casino Hotel Myrtle Beach Casino Boat Dayton Casino Casi</h1>

<p>Around August/September 2022, I tried several attempts to withdraw my balance of over Â£5000 at DogsFortune casino (winnings stemmed from my own deposit - no bonus). No matter what method I used, all the withdrawal requests came back rejected.</p>
<p>On 3 November 2022, I was emailed by their Support Agent, Nick Clark, saying that their payment operator took my deposited funds under a fake pretext and that I would need to chanrgeback/refund all my deposits by contacting my bank. Note that at this time, my balance at the casino was set to zero.</p>
<p>I duly got in touch with my bank, but they said they could not help me as they do not cover chargebacks or refunds where a third-party processor in involved.</p>
<p>I emailed Nick on 8 November, explaining the above and pointing out that although there may have been some impropriety with their processor, the casino still had a duty of care to pay their customers.</p>
<p>Despite sending them several chase-up emails, they have not since responded and my balance at the casino remains at zero.</p>
