    <h1>Casino Chip Cashman Casino 15 Million Free Coins Stellaris Casino Aruba 5 Casino Fandango Casino Erw</h1>

<p>The new appointee thanked his predecessor for his incredible work as chair of the European Casino Association</p>
<p>The European Casino Association (ECA) made an important announcement during its General Assembly at ICE London 2023. The organization shared that Per Jaldung will be stepping down as chairman after eight years in the position. He will be succeeded by Erwin van Lambaart who is a media, entertainment and hospitality veteran.</p>
<p>The Former ECA Chair Is Leaving</p>
<p>As mentioned, Jaldung served as the ECA chair for the past eight years, helping the association grow and evolve. He is an experienced industry professional with over two decades of experience in the gambling industry. A former law enforcer, Jaldung has a strong sense of justice – a quality that made him a suitable chairman of the association.</p>
<p>Jaldung said that it has been an honor to chair the ECA. He said that the biggest strength of the casino industry is the passionate people behind it. Jaldung was glad to work with many of the talented casino workers in the European land-based sector.</p>
<p>It has not been a role without its difficulties, and the industry continues to face ongoing headwinds from multiple directions, but the members of the ECA, and especially this Board of Directors and the new Chairman, can accept and master these challenges. Per Jaldung, ex-chair, ECA</p>
<p>In the wake of his leave, Jaldung was named “honorary president of the ECA.”</p>
<p>Lambaart Promised to Help the Industry Get Through the Challenging Times</p>
<p>Erwin van Lambaart was chosen as Jaldung’s successor with unanimous approval. He has been a member of the ECA board since 2021 and is an experienced media, hospitality, event, marketing and entertainment worker.</p>
<p>Lambaart has 15 years of experience in the hotel industry and just as many in the entertainment sector. In 2016, he was named as chief executive officer of Holland Casinos, which cemented him as an industry specialist. In 2022, Lambaart moved to Austria where he became the CEO of Casinos Australia AG and Österreichische Lotterien.</p>
<p>The new chair said that he is happy with the opportunity to serve the ECA. He understands that this is an important responsibility and promised to do his best to help the industry get through the challenging times.</p>
<p>The licensed European casino industry continues to face great changes and even disruptions. In the coming weeks, I will be working with the ECA members and the ECA board as well as our partners on the priorities for the future work of our association. Erwin van Lambaart, chair, ECA</p>
<p>Lambaart thanked Jaldung for his hard work and praised his predecessor for his ongoing support, advice and leadership.</p>
<p>Since Jaldung will leave, the association appointed Yared Gabretensye, GM of Casino Cosmopol, to represent Sweden on its board of directors.</p>
