<p>3 Genie Wishes review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>In the long list of things that Disney are responsible for completely upending, the story of Aladdin is right up near the top. This slot, for example, although making no direct effort to come in as a cheap post-Disney knock-off, takes its imagery wholesale from the Mouse.</p>
<p>Ignoring the story’s original Chinese setting, and making particular use of the parrot and monkey characters from the cartoon, this slot falls squarely into the area of plagiarism. The genie is even blue.</p>
<p>In short, if you want your adult gambling to invoke your childhood cartoons, here’s a slot you might like.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>3 Genie Wishes has an excellent style. The "stolen" character designs are given a realism-makeover, rendering them closer to someone who might exist in the real world.</p>
<p>The music is a throbbing pseudo-Arabian track that drives the action forward excitingly and the win and spin sounds are low-key but effective.</p>
<p>The animations are rather dull for a slot which is trying so hard to be an animated film. Each symbol has a small win animation, but they are simple and perfunctory at best.</p>
<p>Overall, the slot has a superficially attractive style, though its simplicity may tire players who came for a sense of some whole new world-building.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>3 Genie Wishes is a five reel slot with four rows and fifty paylines.</p>
<p>There is no gamble feature, nor is there much in the way of other bells and whistles. The bonus game is a simple Free Spins style game.</p>
<p>Overall, the gameplay is rather less exotic than a slot built around a Robin Williams film should be.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter symbol.</p>
<p>Three or more Scatter symbols anywhere on the reels trigger the Bonus Feature. This starts with a picking game, in which the player is awarded one of several Bonus Features based on what they pick.</p>
<p>The possible bonuses are:</p>
<p>free spins with Sticky Wilds (Wilds that, when they land on the reels, lock in place for the remaining free spins)</p>
<p>free spins with "Raining Wilds" (random Wilds added to the reels every spin)</p>
<p>the small prize (which is equal to the player’s bet per spin)</p>
<p>or the big prize (which is a randomised payout between ten and five-hundred times the player’s bet per spin)</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.53%, nicely over our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.50 up to a maximum of $/£/€250.00 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is medium, which makes it a relatively weak match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility in slots, some allowance is made for higher RTPs so this isn’t completely useless to players who are using these strategies.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>3 Genie Wishes is a solid slot. It looks nice, has a recognisable theme, and a great soundtrack.</p>
<p>The gameplay is a bit basic, but it does rub the lamp in all the right places. And most players will be satisfied with a free spin bonus. Just don’t expect miracles from this genie.</p>
<p>The medium volatility is a bit of a drag, but coupled with a decent RTP doesn’t rule this one out at all.</p>
