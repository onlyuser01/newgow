<p>Information about blackjack casinos</p>
<p>Blackjack is one of the grand old casino games. It has a history that stretches back to around 1700, when the first games took place in early French casinos, and it has grown in popularity ever since.</p>
<p>Today's online blackjack games roughly follow the same rules as those early versions, but the environment in which we play them has changed.</p>
<p>Nowadays, we're more likely to play blackjack at home than around a casino table, and the internet gives us the chance to do this, with live blackjack online casinos being particularly popular.</p>
<p>Read on to find out how Casino Guru and guide you toward the top blackjack sites out there.</p>
<p>The best blackjack online casinos reviewed and rated by experts</p>
<p>To help you in your quest to find the best blackjack site, the Casino Guru experts have reviewed and rated each site, according to detailed criteria.</p>
<p>The team follows an objective review framework which lets them analyze the reputation and quality of each blackjack site impartially. The casino rating is the product of this analysis, condensing all this data into one score to give you a clear idea of what to expect.</p>
<p>Here's a summary of what we assess.</p>
<p>Player treatment A crucial indicator is the number of complaints the blackjack casino has received. The more unresolved issues it has, the more we can see that this site doesn't value its players very highly, and this negatively impacts its rating. Multiple customer service options are also very much welcomed. Casino size and revenue It's a fact of life that the bigger and richer the casino, the more likely it is to pay out big wins, and less likely to suddenly disappear off the face of the earth! The quality of related casinos is also a useful sign into knowing whether we should trust the site or not. Unfair terms and conditions Ever been caught out by sneaky small print? We don't like it either, so we make sure we highlight anything we don't like in a casino's T&amp;Cs. Sometimes super unfair T&amp;Cs and bad player treatment puts a casino on a blacklist, so we'll make sure we mention this too, if so. Positive qualities It's not all negative. If a casino does well at something, we'll say it and you'll know about it.</p>

<p>How online blackjack works</p>
<p>Online blackjack follows similar rules to its real-life version.</p>
<p>Here's a quick summary:</p>
<p>As the player, your hand must be higher in value than the dealer's (without going over a value of 21) to win. Card values are as follows: 2-10 = face value; Jack, Queen, King = 10; Ace = 1 or 11, depending on the hand value.</p>
<p>A few other important things to note:</p>
<p>If you draw cards with a value of over 21 , you automatically ' go bust ' (lose).</p>
<p>, you automatically ' ' (lose). If you draw cards with a value of under 21 , you can either ' hit ' (get another card to improve the total), or ' stand ' (keep what you have).</p>
<p>, you can either ' ' (get another card to improve the total), or ' ' (keep what you have). If you haven't gone bust by this point, the dealer must draw cards until they have a value of at least 17 .</p>
<p>Blackjack happens when you land a blockbuster hand, which means you can't lose. Simply put, this is an ace plus any card with a value of 10 (10/J/Q/K). &gt;Beating the dealer with this gets you 2.5x your stake back. A draw means you get your stake back.</p>
<p>Note: Bear in mind that this is an overview of the game of blackjack and there are nuances to look out for. Our How blackjack works article covers these in detail.</p>
<p>Blackjack strategies</p>
<p>Many people believe that they can control a game of blackjack by using a strategy.</p>
<p>This is only partly true. Blackjack remains a game of chance in some respect: you need luck to land the right cards, and hope that the dealer doesn't land the all-important blackjack.</p>
<p>However, there are some basic strategies you can follow to make the most of the hand you get. While these do not guarantee an increase in winnings, they do give you a better idea of what to do.</p>
<p>We recommend you follow these basic guidelines without getting wrapped up in advanced strategies that promise you success.</p>
