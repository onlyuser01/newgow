<p>Buffalo Bills Coming Off Their First Loss in 2022 NFL</p>
<p>After beating the Los Angeles Rams and the Tennessee Titans in the first two game weeks of the 2022 NFL season, the Buffalo Bills suffered their first loss in Week 3. It happened against the Miami Dolphins at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens.</p>
<p>Even though the Dolphins are a fantastic bunch of players in 2022, the real reason why the Bills lost 21-19 is that they had problems with fitness. Not only did they go to Florida without several of their key men, but a couple of their offensive superstars struggled with excessive head in the game.</p>
<p>Quarterback Josh Allen struggled with breathing, while tight end Dawson Knox received an IV. Plus, wide receiver Stefon Diggs complained about cramps.</p>
<p>The temperature in Miami was about 90 degrees Fahrenheit, with 60% humidity. In Baltimore, it should be different. The weather forecast predicts a temperature of around 70 degrees.</p>
<p>It’s All About Lamar Jackson in Baltimore Ravens</p>
<p>Lamar Jackson is, by far, the best player for the Baltimore Ravens in 2022. In the three games of the new season, he threw for 10 touchdowns, while also scoring two rushing TDs. This means that he was responsible for literally every single TD scored by Baltimore in the 2022 NFL season.</p>
<p>Thanks to Jackson’s output, the Ravens were able to score a total of 99 points in three games, which makes their offense the most productive in the NFL.</p>
<p>Their defense, however, hasn’t been that great. Actually, with 77 points allowed, they’re among the worst teams in the league.</p>
<p>Buffalo Bills vs Baltimore Ravens Prediction</p>
<p>The Buffalo Bills are a much better team than the Baltimore Ravens. Sure, Jackson will probably cause problems to the Bills defense, but Allen &amp; Co. should be able to score a lot of TDs.</p>
<p>Picks: Buffalo Bills to win and cover the spread; over to hit</p>
