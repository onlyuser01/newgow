<p>AvatarUX has become the latest provider part of the aggregation platform, strengthening its own reach and pull with customers in the process</p>
<p>REEVO, a studio that develops in-house titles and also aggregates third-party content, has welcomed AvatarUX as its latest partner and will now offer its partner operators access to the supplier’s CherryPop and MonkeyPop games, along with many others.</p>
<p>REEVO Boosts Content Library with AvatarUX</p>
<p>AvatarUX is the author of some outstanding features, such as PopWins and MultiPop, which have become some of the most well-received gameplay mechanics among players. Thanks to REEVO, more players will now be able to experience these unique features.</p>
<p>As to REEVO, the company is welcoming AvatarUX at a time of rapid growth for its own product offering. This year has been particularly strong for the aggregator, which is already providing more than 8,000 games, along with slots, table, and crash titles, as well as live gaming experiences.</p>
<p>REEVO has vowed to add more than 60 new game providers in 2023, creating one of the world’s largest repositories for iGaming content. AvatarUX CEO Nicola Longmuir hailed this opportunity and said that he was very excited to see his company’s products now roll out with REEVO.</p>
<p>We’re in a period of strong commercial growth and partnerships like these allow us to expand our distribution to new markets and target new players. Nicola Longmuir, CEO, AvatarUX</p>
<p>Innovative Features and Improved Reach</p>
<p>REEVO Head of Sales Petra Maria Poola was similarly excited to see AvatarUX’s PopWins titles become a part of REEVO’s fast-evolving content library, bringing innovation, higher added value, and worthwhile experiences.</p>
<p>“Our customers will love getting access to this premium content, and we’re delighted to confirm this partnership with one of the brightest brands in iGaming,” Poola concluded. REEVO has been expanding its reach with many new suppliers this year.</p>
<p>As indicated, the company has been keen to secure more than 60 new partnerships, including with companies such as Endorphina, 3 Oaks Gaming, and Onlyplay, all of whom are now part of the aggregator’s expansive content library.</p>
