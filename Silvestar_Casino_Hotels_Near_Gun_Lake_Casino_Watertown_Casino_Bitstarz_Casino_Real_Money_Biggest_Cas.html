    <h1>Silvestar Casino Hotels Near Gun Lake Casino Watertown Casino Bitstarz Casino Real Money Biggest Cas</h1>

<p>Hi Veronika, thank you for your quick reply, I’ve had a look at the terms and conditions and to me I haven’t broken them, only one account per household and that’s still the same, one account was closed and another was opened, therefor it’s only one account?</p>
<p>also I sent my details away as soon as I opened my new account it’s not as if I’ve won the money then sent away details, if the terms and conditions worked it would / should have blocked my account the second I created the account because I had to say my address so therefor the casino should know I’ve had an account before, in my opinion this is a flaw on velobet not me, they were happy enough and quick enough to take my deposits but when they seen money sitting they want to shut the account down…</p>
<p>regards to my ex she had the passwords to my phone all my accounts etc etc, she sent them an email without me knowing on MY email address to make it look as if it was me and said I have gambling problems, I’ve tried to email velobet before she shut the account down about a withdrawal and I never got a response back, luckily I got it sorted that time myself, then a short while later I tried to log back into my old account and it said user blocked that’s when I found out about her emailing velo and closing the account down.</p>
<p>due to previous emails not being answered by velo I opted to make a new account because the verification process was easy enough last time round instead of waiting days for an email that’s never coming about an old account.</p>
<p>I really hope the casino send me the money that was sitting in the account which is rightfully mine because I’ve spent that 850gbp already in my bank as I was expecting no issues with having the money back that I won. Hope to hear from you soon Veronika thanks again for your quick response I really appreciate it, as this is stressing me out and leaving me in money trouble now.</p>
