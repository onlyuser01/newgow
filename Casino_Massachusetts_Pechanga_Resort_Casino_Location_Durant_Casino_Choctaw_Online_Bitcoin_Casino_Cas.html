    <h1>Casino Massachusetts Pechanga Resort Casino Location Durant Casino Choctaw Online Bitcoin Casino Cas</h1>

<p>Symplify, a leading CRM and AI cloud solutions specialist, with a particular focus on the iGaming industry, has signed a new partnership</p>
<p>The new alliance is formed with King Billy Casino and it will help the operator and iGaming brand to improve its customer engagement by delivering tailored and player-centered solutions.</p>
<p>Symplify Focuses on Meeting King Billy Casino’s Player Needs</p>
<p>King Billy Casino is already a respected name in the industry and stands out by virtue of its strong presence in online casino entertainment and solid reputation. Now, the company will further benefit from Symplify’s market-leading solutions, namely the CRM Ecosystem and AI Personalization Module.</p>
<p>These two solutions make it possible for King Billy to further boost the on-page experience for its customers and reduce costs through AI and machine learning solutions for an added benefit. The casino will also benefit from a number of other assets such as SMS, Push Packages, and Email aimed at the existing user base.</p>
<p>King Billy will further benefit from personalized customer lifecycle journeys in real time and launch customer events and campaigns that reflect current player trends and preferences. Symplify also offers a SaaS service that focuses on monitoring player behavior and boosts overall player protection as such.</p>
<p>AI is also used to optimize marketing and create stronger customer sentiment throughout a player’s life cycle. The partnership was naturally welcomed by all participants, with Symplify CEO Robert Kimber saying that the CRM ecosystem is perfectly developed to back King Billy’s ongoing expansion. Kimber explained:</p>
<p>Symplify’s single solution caters for profitability through conversion and driving increased playing activities by optimizing the player experience. Symplify CEO Robert Kimber</p>
<p>King Billy Casino CEO Volodymyr Harkusha was similarly satisfied with the outcome and said that the brand has been growing for six years now, focusing on what its players need and delivering responsible gambling across the board.</p>
<p>“In this new era, we strongly believe Symplify to be one of our closest allies with their unmatched tools and modules. Welcome aboard, the King welcomes you,” Harkusha effused. Recently, Symplify confirmed that it had struck a partnership with NuxGame, a provider of solutions for the gambling industry.</p>
