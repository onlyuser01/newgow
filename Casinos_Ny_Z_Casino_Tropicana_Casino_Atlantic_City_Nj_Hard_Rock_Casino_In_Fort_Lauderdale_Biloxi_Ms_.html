<p>Shai Tabibian, 888 Holdings’ SVP head of B2C will be departing from the company. The outgoing head made the announcement on LinkedIn, thanking his colleagues for the incredible moments they have had together.</p>
<p>Tabibian boasts 9 years with the company, serving the company in a variety of capacities. His tenure included stints as head of poker affiliates and regional marketing, poker marketing director and online acquisition marketing director. In April 2019, Tabibian was named VP of growth marketing. Two years later, he became the head of the company’s B2C division.</p>
<p>As noted by Tabibian, the 9-year period with 888 was his “second ride” with the company, which he also served for over 2 years between 2008 and 2011.</p>
<p>Tabibian Will Always Remain an 8ster</p>
<p>Tabibian thanked the 888 family for the laughter, collaboration and shared moments of triumph they had together. He said that working alongside the company’s talented team and dedicated individuals has been a blast. The outgoing head added that he feels incredibly lucky to have shared this journey with his 888 colleagues.</p>
<p>Following that, Tabibian thanked his managers, Shakked, Eyal Rivlin, Guy Cohen and Itai Pazner, who supported him, guided him and believed in his abilities. He praised them for their incredible leadership and mentorship skills and said that he is thankful for the personal and professional growth opportunities they provided him.</p>
<p>Tabibian concluded that he will always remember 888 fondly and that the company will always remain a part of him.</p>
<p>As I embark on a new adventure, I am filled with gratitude for the memories created and the lifelong connections made. As I probably will stay 8ster forever, It’s not a goodbye but a “see you later.” Shai Tabibian</p>
<p>Tabibian’s departure comes several months after the company parted ways with Sivan Finn, its VP of strategic marketing.</p>
<p>888 Remains Optimistic Despite the Recent Turmoil</p>
<p>In other 888-related news, the company recently finalized its agreement with Paf, transferring its Latvian properties to the latter company. The move follows 888’s strategy to streamline its business. At the same time, the takeover was regarded as a long-term investment by Paf, which seeks to solidify its presence in the Baltics.</p>
<p>In April, 888 published its FY 2022 report, demonstrating mixed results. While certain metrics remained unstable the company’s management remained optimistic about the future. The company is assured that it is on track to driving amazing results by 2025, in spite of the recent William Hill trouble.</p>
