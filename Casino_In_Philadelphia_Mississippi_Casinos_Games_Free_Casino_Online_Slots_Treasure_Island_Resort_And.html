<p>Leslie Alexander of Canal Winchester, Ohio, claims MGM Resorts was negligent in failing to protect her from assailant Nathaniel Mahoney, 47, Las Vegas TV station KLAS reported.</p>
<p>Alexander was knifed on September 6, 2021, while walking in the MGM Grand. According to court documents, Mahoney had been sitting “at a bank of slot machines” near a women’s restroom and randomly attached Winchester.</p>
<p>However, “no one from the hotel’s security force and/or its agents or employees responded to the scene, until well after the attack had taken place,” F. Travis Buchanan, the Las Vegas-based lawyer representing Alexander, claims in the court action.</p>
<p>When Alexander spoke to a Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department (LVMPD) officer, the cop told her Mahoney was a suspect in the prior night’s slashing, court documents revealed.</p>
<p>Earlier Stabbing</p>
<p>Just hours earlier, on September 5, Mahoney allegedly stabbed a randomly selected, unnamed man while he was in the same lobby and gaming floor area. Metro police apprehended Mahoney on the Las Vegas Strip after the second attack. In his pocket was a four-and-a-half-inch knife, cops revealed.</p>
<p>Mahoney was charged with battery with a deadly weapon resulting in substantial bodily harm, possession of a deadly weapon, and carrying a concealed weapon without a permit, KLAS reported.</p>
<p>Mahoney Pleads Guilty</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Mahoney pleaded guilty to a single count of assault with a deadly weapon under a plea agreement.</p>
<p>Prosecutors recommended that he get a 19-t0-48 month prison sentence, according to the deal. Las Vegas Judge Michelle Leavitt handed down that sentence in March.</p>
<p>Mahoney was given 600 days credit for the time he had already spent in jail and time for competency proceedings, according to KLAS.</p>
<p>Alexander’s civil lawsuit seeks at least $15K in damages from MGM Resorts.</p>
<p>Casino.org contacted an MGM Resorts spokesman for comment on the civil litigation. No immediate statement was provided.</p>
