    <h1>Riverboat Casinos Crocs Casino Costa Rica Evolution Casino Casinos Cerca Hard Rock Hotel Casino Punt</h1>

<p>I requested two withdrawals from SugarCasino of the Gammix Group on 10/17/2022.</p>
<p>1) 2500,-</p>
<p>2) 1000,-</p>
<p>Played with real money, I do not accept bonuses.</p>
<p>A KYC procedure was then initiated, which is not unusual.</p>
<p>From this point on it becomes unbelievable. I have now received 9 e-mails requesting further data after each proof submitted.</p>
<p>The proof requirements are sent to me in pieces, not all at once.</p>
<p>First:</p>
<p>Identity -&gt; ID picture sent</p>
<p>Address -&gt; Invoices sent</p>
<p>2 days later - SugarCasino asked for proof of bank account and I sent it to you.</p>
<p>1 day later - Bank statements requested by SugarCasino - I sent bank statements, but blacked out private information such as my insurance.</p>
<p>Bank statements were rejected because information was blacked out</p>
<p>1 day later - individual pages of the bank statements submitted without being redacted - rejected again because my name would not be visible. The Iban and the date are clearly visible.</p>
<p>Discussion with support about the required data: Comply or don't get paid. A bank card as proof will not be accepted.</p>
<p>Unredacted excerpts submitted for one month.</p>
<p>Another day later, the second month is asked. I also submitted this with gnashing of teeth.</p>
<p>Since then no answer. The chat about this was ended by the casino site.</p>
<p>I would like to receive my money from the casino but this keeps getting delayed.</p>
<p>They want all my data, no request is too absurd for SugarCasino. And you still have a lot of time. I would like to emphasize that I have made all the data available, even if a court order would be required for them in my home country.</p>
