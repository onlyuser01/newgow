<p>BETER, a supplier of sports and esports betting live odds, has teamed up with Bet Connections in a newly-formed partnership that will focus on the Latin American region. An established next-gen betting and gaming solutions provider, BETER’s iFrame solution has become a preferred go-to option for anyone who looks to break ground in the esports betting market and offer live odds, while also benefiting from unique sports events.</p>
<p>BETER Doubles Down on LatAm Expansion</p>
<p>The Latin American-pivot is important for both companies as it enables them to position themselves in a market that has long-term implications and holds a lucrative promise. Through this partnership, BETER will directly feed live sports and esports feeds to the company in all regulated markets where both entities are covered.</p>
<p>BETER has already established an impressive footprint in the region on its own with market access to Brazil, Peru, Paraguay, Argentina, and Ecuador. Much of this is owing to the company’s immense variety of gaming markets being offered.</p>
<p>BETER covers 40,000 esports tournaments and has a 24/7 table tennis coverage among other important features, including e-football and e-basketball coverage along with ESportsBattle Counter-Strike: Global Offensive matches. The tie-up should bring distinct dividends to Bet Connections which will extend these events to its own clients.</p>
<p>Bet Connections CEO Jesus Campo was pleased with the opportunity to be teaming with BETER, praising its select features. One of those is naturally the 24/7 live coverage of events, Campo explained. Integration has been another good reason to get behind BETER as a partner, he continued.</p>
<p>The plug-and-play nature of the iFrame integration also makes it an easy product to boost one’s offer, citing the fast, easy and seamless operation of the platform. “The deal is just what we expect to help maintain our leading position in Latin America,” Campo said. BETER chief revenue officer Yori Arami welcomed this new expansion as well.</p>
<p>Live Markets Now Lead the Way</p>
<p>Arami argued that live market for sports betting and esports holds a huge potential and the viewership numbers are already promising. Both the Setka Cup and ESportsBattle matches have been enjoying steadfast interest which could translate into better performance benchmarks for partners. The executive added:</p>
<p>Our partnership with Bet Connections is significant as it provides further vital exposure across a wide swathe of the region at once and is another step in the expansion of our next-gen offering in LatAm markets. We can’t wait to get started. BETER chief revenue officer Yori Arami</p>
<p>BETER’s products are already established and integrated with a number of high-profile companies, including William Hill, Fortuna Entertainment Group, Bet365, Sportradar, and many others.</p>
