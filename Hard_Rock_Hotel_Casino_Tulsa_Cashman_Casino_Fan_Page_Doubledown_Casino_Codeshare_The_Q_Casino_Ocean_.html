    <h1>Hard Rock Hotel Casino Tulsa Cashman Casino Fan Page Doubledown Casino Codeshare The Q Casino Ocean</h1>

<p>Hello everyone .</p>
<p>Slootz, bogamba House of Spins voozaza, spintirnado, turbospins are powered by one source. I can prove that!</p>
<p>Something happened to me, something I've never experienced before. Most of the casinos mentioned above primarily offer MiFinity, as many also know.</p>
<p>I wanted to deposit from spintornado and made a bank transfer to MiFinity so that it would carry out the transaction in spintornad. Suddenly my bank deposit from MiFinity main account (standard) my deposits were suddenly taken away. I asked MiFinity who gave them permission to access my personal account. There was only one answer, the transaction was processed, but I no longer had any authority over my money. MiFinity is in cahoots with them, that's what I'm saying. Only after 3 weeks spintornado said support I would credit it to Manuel but it can't be seen in the deposit history. No proof of this. I also get €40 from one casino and €310 from another, don't see any of it, please stay away! Otherwise stay away!! My motto MiFinity and these casinos are in cahoots, I'll tell you</p>
