    <h1>Superslots Casino Planet 7 Casino No Deposit Bonus Casino In Hinckley Minnesota Bally S Online Casin</h1>

<p>Good afternoon, I comment on my problem that really is about two casinos that are the same, bondibet and bevegas. It turns out that in bevegas on 07/13/2020 I made several deposits of € 25 a total of € 75. In bondibet I have made many more deposits, I do not know how many exactly, the fact is that they have charged me € 425 more, but neither of them gives me an answer, in the bank the names that come out are:</p>
<p>5TH LTD and 5TH but I do not know which casino each corresponds to, I have asked both casinos, but it seems that they are a bit silly, in fact, there are various amounts of € 50 that do not correspond to any deposit that I have made in none of the casinos, nor the amount of my date coincide, to top it off, the boy who has attended me in bondibet through chat, has doubted my credibility, as if I were lying, then, the email that has given me the boy: security@bondibet.com take a long time to respond, I am very angry, it is something very serious so that I have to wait so long, it is that they have charged me € 425 because they felt like it, I my account I do not have money from the bank, therefore every time I put money in that card, I pay what I am going to buy or in this case I pay the deposit, my bank does not allow me to pay if I do not have money in the account, therefore it is Impossible that I have spent € 425 more, well, I'm not stupid either and I know l or what I spend and what not, I feel that these people have stolen from me and they are in no hurry to solve it, I feel cheated and I am very tired of the agents that are in the chat continuously playing dumb every time you tell them any incidence that you have had, is there any way to report them and to return the money that I have deposited with them? I want bondibet to return all the money that I have deposited from July 3, 2020 at 02:49:41 AM until July 16, 2020 at 01:23:43 PM. I am very sorry, but I want you to give me my money back, they are showing me that they are scammers, that if you do not complain, they have no intention of solving anything, the chat agents are lousy, because they play dumb and as I have already said, the agent who has attended me in bondibet, has tried to liar me and not read the rules, because if there is any rule where they say that they can charge you € 425 for no apparent reason, I would like to be told, because if They also charge you for making deposits ... as I said, I want you to return all the money I have deposited on the dates I have mentioned and, if there is any way to report them, I would like you to help me, I am lost in this and these people are very shameless. By the way, the name of the agent who has attended me in bondibet, is Jackson, I do not know if it will be true, or it is also a lie of them. Because another thing I do not understand is a promotion that they have, it is a draw of € 100,000 in cash, it goes by scores, how is it possible that in a list of rankings there are always the same names in the list, with the same scores? Because I am enrolled in that promotion and another agent could not even tell me what score I had ... it was based on saying that if I am not on the list I am not classified, of course I do not appear on the list, if the list is one still image they have since never changes. I hope you can help me get all my money back, because what they have done has no name, to be honest, I do not recommend this page to anyone, judging by what is happening to me, you cannot trust them. I am also afraid that my account will be closed directly and I no longer have anyone to claim, so I ask for your help, I want to recover the money I have invested there, I know it is complicated because I have used the money playing, but I think I deserve to recover the money invested from a site that has stolen from me and that does not show face, because they know the deposits that I have made and they know that what they have charged me does not match, therefore it seems fatal to me that I have to waste my time sending bank statements to justify what I say is true, when it is as simple as they look at the deposits I have made with them, and then see everything they have charged me. Thanks and please help me!</p>
