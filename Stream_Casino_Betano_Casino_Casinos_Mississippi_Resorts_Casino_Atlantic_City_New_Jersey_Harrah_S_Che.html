    <h1>Stream Casino Betano Casino Casinos Mississippi Resorts Casino Atlantic City New Jersey Harrah S Che</h1>

<p>The issue that I have experienced. I had made 2 deposits of £300 by error. I’ve been able to withdraw my first error of £300. My 2nd error saw my account disabled . I’ve spoke to customer team since since the 12th Septmeber with no response or resolution. I want my £300 deposit back that is my money . Not gambled or betted but my own deposit. You have flatlined refused on various occasions to release this money back to me. You’ve stated on different occasions that I ever had a duplicate account - which I don’t . Or have a gamstop in place (which I don’t ) reviewing your own terms and conditions it states :</p>
<p>"11.5 We take responsible gambling very seriously, and if you try to open duplicate accounts with us, or to enrol with different details during your period of exclusion we will do our best to detect and close them. If you are able to access our Services, any losses incurred during the period before detection and closure of the duplicate accounts will not be refunded. We also reserve the right to withhold any Winnings that have been obtained, with only the amount deposited returned to you."</p>
<p>You can see my account that is now blocked that I had made 2 deposits . The money in the account is my own deposit. You need to return this to me .</p>
<p>Alternatively your terms and conditions as indicated below state</p>
<p>" 15.7 Multiple Accounts with different email addresses and/or different names for one individual person are not allowed. If, in our opinion, you have more than one Account ("Duplicate Account(s)"), we may elect at any time to: (i) keep your Account and Duplicate Account(s) open; (ii) close your Account and all of your Duplicate Accounts; and/or (iii) keep open the first Account opened by you or on your behalf and close all Duplicate Accounts. If we close any Account or Duplicate Account in these circumstances:</p>
<p>15.7.1 all bonuses, free Bets and Winnings accrued from such bonuses and free Bets obtained using that Duplicate Account will be void and forfeited by you;</p>
<p>15.7.2 we may, at our entire discretion, void all Bets placed using funds in any Duplicate Account and refund to you the amount of any deposits made to the Duplicate Account (less any Winnings withdrawn) and, to the extent not recovered by us from the relevant Duplicate Account, any amounts to be refunded to us by you in respect of a Duplicate Account may be recovered by us directly from any other of your Accounts (including any other Duplicate Account); or</p>
<p>15.7.3 we may, at our entire discretion, allow usage of the Duplicate Account to be deemed valid in which case all Bets placed by or for you through the Duplicate Account shall be retained by us and the balance of any amount remaining in the Duplicate Account which was deposited into the Duplicate Account by you (if any) will be refunded."</p>
<p>Again. I’m the event this is a duplicate account (which it isn’t ) you need to return my deposit. The account balance is not from winnings. I withdrew approx £70 of winnnings from the account . If that’s the case please take this from my balance but return the rest of my depoist.</p>
<p>I feel very annoyed and upset with this company. My fault for adding the funds into the account. Due to this error I’ve been overdrawn as you’ve not returned my money. Again. My money I deposited. Not won. I have tried since the 12th September with no responses . My account is blocked.</p>
