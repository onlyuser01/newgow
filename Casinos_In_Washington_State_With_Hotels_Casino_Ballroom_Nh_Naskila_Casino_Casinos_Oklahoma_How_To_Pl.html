<p>Hearts Desire review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Hearts Desire is themed around hearts and fruit.</p>
<p>In this vintage casino world, players will dance their way to a selection of fruits, including grapes, oranges, and watermelons. All the while, players will need to watch out for gleaming golden hearts and sparkling diamonds.</p>
<p>This slot will particularly appeal to players who enjoy fruit machine themes.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The soundtrack brings to mind ‘80s sci-fi films, with plenty of digital notes and a dreamy melody. The reels spin with a dramatic swish as the rhythm of the music picks up. The chimes that celebrate wins give a nod to classic casino games.</p>
<p>The reels are filled with vivid animations of fruit, including glossy cherries that look ripe and ready to be eaten, and a cute bunch of yellow bananas.</p>
<p>Rounded hearts made of gold give a nod to the slot’s name, but the gleaming diamond symbols are the most striking. With fiery light catching them, these gems seem to be lit from within.</p>
<p>Upon spins, tiny glowing hearts float up among the reels, adding some on-theme excitement.</p>
<p>Together, the soundtrack and animation give Hearts Desire a retro casino feel.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Hearts Desire is a five-reel, three-row slot, with 30 win lines.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>Hearts Desire features a Progressive Jackpot which can be triggered randomly after the reels stop spinning. The Progressive Jackpot is linked to other Betsoft games, and the player’s odds of triggering this prize increase with the size of their bet.</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter symbol.</p>
<p>On every reel, there are Stacked Mystery symbol positions that are assigned a random symbol prior to each spin. Every Mystery symbol position is populated by matching symbols for each spin.</p>
<p>The Free Spins feature begins when players land at least 5 Scatter symbols. The feature begins with 5 free spins and the values of all Scatters are collected in a cumulative meter.</p>
<p>Stacked Mystery symbols may appear during the Free Spins feature. Any Scatters that land will contribute their values to the cumulative meter.</p>
<p>Special Scatter symbols can be accompanied by multipliers, and appear only during the Free Spins feature.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>

<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.30 up to a maximum of $/£/€120 per spin.</p>
