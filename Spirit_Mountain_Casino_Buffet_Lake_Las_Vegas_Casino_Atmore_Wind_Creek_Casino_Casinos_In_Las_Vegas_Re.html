<p>Leading sports data and technology company Sportradar announced today the acquisition of Vaix, a pioneer in developing artificial intelligence (AI)-based solutions for the online casino industry.</p>
<p>Enhancing Player Personalization</p>
<p>The acquisition of Vaix, a supplier of innovative AI technology that powers a more-targeted, player-friendly experience for gambling operators by allowing them to gain a personalized view of their customers, followed a period of two years of partnership between Sportradar and Vaix.</p>
<p>“VAIX products with their Artificial Intelligence and algorithms are now being natively integrated as part of the Sportradar Sportsbook platform, enhancing our data analytics, promotions system and player personalization.” Paolo Personeni, Managing Director, Managed Betting Services, Sportradar</p>
<p>The Swiss-based data technology firm and Vaix partnered to facilitate the incorporation of Vaix’s AI technology into Sportradar’s Managed Trading Services (MTS), a sophisticated trading, risk, live odds, and liability management solution that supports margin and profit optimization for betting operators, boosting their efficiency while managing their risk.</p>
<p>Emphasizing the “faster and simplified integration” for all MTS customers, Personeni hailed the acquisition of Vaix as “the culmination of a very important and productive partnership” over the course of two years.</p>
<p>“Fully joining forces with Sportradar is recognition of the power of Vaix’s technology, and a dream come true for our vision to bring AI to the entire iGaming industry. Vaix’s capabilities can provide all of Sportradar’s operators with the power to truly personalize their Offering, Marketing and CRM, as they seek to attract and engage players.” Andreas Hartmann, Co-Founder and CEO, Vaix</p>
<p>Customer Acquisition in Focus</p>
<p>Following the successful integration of Vaix’s technology, Sportradar is now capable of leveraging the technology’s advanced AI learning capabilities to offer its customers access to more personalized insights and suggestions relating to individual player preferences, and help them expand their market share by attracting new customers.</p>
<p>With over 60 billion transactions fed into Vaix’s AI since the firm’s inception in 2016 by Hartmann and John O’Malia, Vaix has proven its value as a provider of a personalized experience to more than 50 million users at tier 1, 2 and 3 operators and platforms across all continents. The 2021 Data and AI Partner Award at the EGR B2B Awards was the latest recognition of the company as one of the best service providers in the online gaming industry.</p>
<p>Sportradar said the acquisition did not have a material impact on the company’s annual outlook for 2022 as provided in the full year 2021 financial report on March 30, 2022. Neither Sportradar nor Vaix provided any details of the terms of the acquisition.</p>
