    <h1>Ojos Locos Casino Bermuda Casino Doubledown Casino Code Share Casinos Ok Agua Caliente Resort Casino</h1>

<p>There are cases where casinos deserve to be blacklisted, but this isn't one of them. You breached their terms and conditions by creating another account. They did what only a fair casino would do: They voided the winnings, but returned the deposits.</p>
<p>Of course, the problem is that they had to close the 2nd account immediately so they decided to move the deposits to your 1st account. If I understand it correctly, your 1st account is closed now due to self-exlusion for 30 days, but it will be reopen after that. Then, that will be the moment when you should be able withdraw back all your deposits.</p>
<p>The only thing I'm concerned about is the fact that they shouldn't let you reopen the account if it's closed due to gambling issues. It should remain closed when you mention that this is the reason for closing your account. But the tool you described probably works differently. It doesn't matter what's the reason for closing account, the player has always an option to choose a specific period (30days etc.).</p>
