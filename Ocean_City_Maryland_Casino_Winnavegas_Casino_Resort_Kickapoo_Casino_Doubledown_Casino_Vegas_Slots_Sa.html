    <h1>Ocean City Maryland Casino Winnavegas Casino Resort Kickapoo Casino Doubledown Casino Vegas Slots Sa</h1>

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>I would like to share with you a problem that happened at the Casino.com of the Mansion Casino group at a time of cause in the world and difficult in my life because this virus came and is contagious here on the other side of the world where it arose.</p>
<p>Doctors do not know how to give information or hope here in Brazil.</p>
<p>So for the good of the population I am in an isolated hospital and alone indefinitely if I can resist.</p>
<p>My spending time and distraction became the casino.</p>
<p>I won a 60% deposit bonus I have always made deposits of U $ 100 maximum</p>
<p>On that occasion that money is no longer valuable because the poor and the rich are the same for sickness. I made a deposit of U $ 1400 Around almost R $ 10,000.00 Minimum wage in the country is R $ 850.00 but the value of the Bonus would be good.</p>
<p>Well on the day the site was experiencing problems in the casino at the table was announced and in the Chat (I have recording) because</p>
<p>Slow site, bug, service was not working, site crashing .... a cause</p>
<p>Because I already played at the Casino it was almost VIP status</p>
<p>I went to make the deposit in two payments U $ 800.00 + R $ 600.00 I made the first deposit with website having many problems and legend It confirmed the payment of the first one and I went again in the deposit page and I made another payment procedure to select and fill everything.</p>
<p>When I went to the chat to redeem the Bonus.</p>
<p>The attendant informed me and my balance was U $ 890 only</p>
<p>$ 510 Gone from account</p>
<p>After a long time 8 hours trying to talk to someone to solve the problem</p>
<p>I entered a table that had a problem and was announced by the Casino chat</p>
<p>But it worked again and I played</p>
<p>I went to the game tired of not being able to get in touch</p>
<p>I placed the first bet 1-18</p>
<p>1 - $ 75</p>
<p>2 - $ 175</p>
<p>3 - $ 350</p>
<p>4 - $ 290</p>
<p>On bet 4 of $ 290 Win on bet of 1-8 Win would be $ 580</p>
<p>However, it was credited U $ 100</p>
<p>After so much bug and problem on the site</p>
<p>unable to contact and receive no Bonus</p>
<p>Trying to talk to an attendant for HOURS only after 13 HOras of the event I managed to contact without closing the chat in the middle of the problem</p>
<p>I spoke with 4 different Attendants, the service hours ended and I had to start the whole procedure.</p>
<p>After 16 hours trying to contact E-mail</p>
<p>Chat call</p>
<p>Anyway I got a contact</p>
<p>Because I explained everything</p>
<p>Please see their outcome below:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>At 2020-03-23 17:05:36 GMT player deposited 600 USD</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At 2020-03-23 17:06:13 GMT player placed 510 USD bet in Roulette Live (game code: 10250024102), but this was not a winning bet. After this game round player's balance was 90.57 USD.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>3, At 2020-03-23 17:06:55 GMT player deposited 800 USD, which was added to their balance.</p>
<p>The site took 20 seconds to load a page.</p>
<p>An impossible thing to do</p>
<p>At 17:05:36 Payment request was made</p>
<p>The site loads it takes about 10 15 seconds normally 17:05:51</p>
<p>Day 23 without time limit</p>
<p>Ai would have left after 15 seconds (example 17:06:06)</p>
<p>I went to a table that takes a long time to enter (example 17:06:16) and I would have placed a $ 510 bet and lost at 17:06:13 and the bet closes 15 to 20 seconds before (Summary the bet has to be placed until 17:05:58</p>
<p>and then I went to make a deposit selected the payment method</p>
<p>Entered all the data and made a deposit of U $ 800 at 17:06:55 the bank confirmed the payment</p>
<p>(HOW WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE)</p>
<p>(HOW CAN THEY GIVE A JUSTIFICATION OF THIS NOT TO PAY)</p>
<p>Something impossible as they can give this excuse for a problem with their system !!</p>
<p>unacceptable.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>Ai left me with no bonus. and with my balance at the casino. I was blocked to enter the Casino</p>
<p>I have pictures and screen recording!</p>
<p>UNBELIEVABL</p>
