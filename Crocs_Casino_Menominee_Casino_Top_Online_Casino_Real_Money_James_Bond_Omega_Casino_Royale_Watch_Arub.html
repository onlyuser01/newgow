<p>Wynn Resorts Signs Two Deals with Full House</p>
<p>US casino operator Wynn Resorts has struck two deals with Full House Resorts in order to roll out mobile and online sports betting services in Indiana and Colorado.</p>
<p>Although further details of the two deals were not disclosed, Full House Resorts commented that it has now used all of its permitted sports betting opportunities in both states.</p>
<p>In addition, Full House said that the Colorado launch is subject to the state legalizing sports wagering. As a reminder, Colorado Governor Jared Polis signed off on a bill in May to legalize sports wagering. However, the measure will also be voted by citizens in a statewide referendum scheduled for November 5.</p>
<p>“We are excited to partner with Wynn Resorts, allowing them to conduct mobile sports wagering throughout Indiana and Colorado,” Full House president and chief executive, Daniel Lee, commented.</p>
<p>“Wynn Resorts is renowned for its unparalleled focus on guest service and as the premier operator in the gaming industry. We are thrilled to see them bring their unique vision to the online space, beginning with the residents of – and many visitors to – Indiana and Colorado.”</p>
<p>Full House runs Bronco Billy’s Casino and Hotel in Colorado as well as Rising Star Casino Resort in Indiana, while Wynn Resorts has properties in both Nevada and Massachusetts.</p>
<p>Continuing Success for Full House</p>
<p>The two contracts come after Full House reached an agreement with Churchill Downs Incorporated last month to operate a retail sportsbook at the Rising Star Casino site.</p>
<p>The agreement also allows CDI to offer retail and online sports wagering under the BetAmerica brand in Colorado, utilizing Full House Resorts’ operating license for Bronco Billy’s Casino and Hotel in Cripple Creek, Colorado, subject to approval of legislation by Colorado residents, issuance of final regulations, and gaming license approvals. The retail BetAmerica Sportsbook would be offered at the Bronco Billy’s Casino and Hotel. Colorado residents will vote this November on whether to ratify Colorado’s sports betting bill, HB 19-1327.</p>
<p>In September, Full House also signed a deal for betting exchange operator Smarkets to serve as its mobile sports betting provider at the two casinos.</p>
<p>Back then, Smarkets detailed that it would move to launch its recently debuted SBK proprietary sportsbook platform within the betting legislated states, with Smarkets targeting a rollout of SBK iOS and Android apps in Indiana by late 2019.</p>
<p>Smarkets CEO &amp; Founder Jason Trost said at the time: “This is a landmark day for Smarkets. As an American myself, I’m thrilled to bring our world-leading technology to Indiana and Colorado, as well as more states across the country.”</p>
<p>“I truly believe that an agile company like ours can make a huge impact against some of the bigger players thanks to our superior technology and focus on providing the best prices.”</p>
