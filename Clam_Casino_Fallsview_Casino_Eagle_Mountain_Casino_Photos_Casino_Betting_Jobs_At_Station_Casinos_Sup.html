    <h1>Clam Casino Fallsview Casino Eagle Mountain Casino Photos Casino Betting Jobs At Station Casinos Sup</h1>

<p>Super Group, the global online sports betting and gaming business holding behind Betway, has reinforced its board of directors with the addition of two new members.</p>
<p>Two New Members Join Super Group’s Board</p>
<p>The ones joining the team are the experienced Natara Holloway and Jonathan Jossel. The two will assume their positions with an immediate effect.</p>
<p>Holloway is an experienced individual who has previously held various roles in sports. She worked for the National Football League for almost twenty years and is very knowledgeable in the field. Her last role at the NFL saw her in the shoes of the league’s vice president of business operations and strategy for football operations.</p>
<p>Holloway joins the company after a tenure at Sports Entertainment Acquisition Corp, a publicly traded special purpose acquisition company that joined the Super Group family in January. As part of Sports Entertainment, Holloway served as chairwoman of the audit committee. She will use her knowledge to help the company expand its sports betting footprint in the United States.</p>
<p>Jossel, on the other hand, boasts significant experience in the gambling sector. He has worked as the CEO of the Plaza Hotel and Casino in downtown Las Vegas for almost a decade. Thanks to this, Jossel has acquired important skills and will be a valuable asset to Super Group’s board. Jossel’s dream is to reinvigorate the Plaza brand and breathe new life into the property.</p>
<p>Super Group Welcomed the Directors</p>
<p>With the two new additions on board, the company’s board of directors will now have nine members. As part of Super Group’s board, the Holloway and Jossel join chief financial officer Alinda van Wyk, Bob Dutnal, audit committee chairman John Le Poidevin, John Collins, chief executive officer Neal Menashe and president and chief operating officer Richard Hasson.</p>
<p>Super Group hopes that the two new board members will help the company keep moving forward. Neal Menashe, the holding’s CEO, is glad to welcome Holloway and Jossel to the company’s board. He said he is looking forward to working with both of them. Menashe noted that the new directors’ experience will be a key to fulfilling Super Group’s plans:</p>
<p>They both bring a wealth of experience relevant to our industry and will be able to provide valuable perspectives as we continue to pursue our global growth strategy. Neal Menashe, CEO, Super Group</p>
<p>Super Group had a strong 2021 FY, just as it expected. The company’s results showed that the company earned 45% more in 2021 than it did in 2020.</p>
