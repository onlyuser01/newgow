<p>Incentive Games has signed a deal with one of the biggest sports betting platforms FSB Technology. The agreement will see FSB promote Incentive’s portfolio of games to new customers all over the world.</p>
<p>Incentive Games Partners with FSB Technology</p>
<p>Incentive Games, based in Edinburgh, maintained its growth performance in 2021 by establishing a partnership with FSB Technology, one of the leading sports betting platform providers in the iGaming industry.</p>
<p>FSB will promote the Scottish company’s games to potential customers all over the world as part of the agreement. Incentive Games already has a foothold on five continents, particularly in Africa, where both its free-to-play and pay-to-play titles have proven to be incredibly successful with gamers. With FSB’s global scope and expertise, it is expected that the new collaboration will only strengthen this presence.</p>
<p>Incentive Games’ free-to-Play games have proven to be very successful in reducing acquisition costs, and its retention items have shown to increase players’ weekly visits, thus increasing lifetime value. These variables work together to help operators increase their operating profits.</p>
<p>CEO of Incentive Games, John Gordon, said: “We’ve been making great progress, as a company, in the last year and signing this agreement is certainly one of the major highlights so far! Like Incentive Games, FSB is an award-winning company backed by a talented team, so I expect this to be a fruitful relationship.”</p>
<p>COO of FSB Technology, Glenn Elliott, commented that Incentive Games and its portfolio of free-to-play and pay-to-play games had impressed his company, and he believes they would appeal to the company’s operator partners in key global markets. They also add value to the FSB platform, enabling the company to provide operators with a broader selection of high-quality, well-tested content.</p>
<p>Incentive Games Continues Growth</p>
<p>Earlier in March, BtoBet announced a new collaboration with Incentive Games, which will carry Incentive’s dedicated portfolio of P2P virtual sports games to BtoBet’s customers.</p>
<p>The collaboration will concentrate on Europe, Africa, and Latin America and will include titles such as Virtual League: Racing and Virtual League: Penalties, which are common among players.</p>
<p>Gordon expressed his delight in establishing deeper relations with BtoBet. Incentive will be able to continue working on key markets that are essential to the business as a result of this new relationship.</p>
<p>Continuing Incentive’s march forward, the company has signed a 36-month agreement with Intralot to make its Margin Selector, Dream Team, and Bracket games available for NBA and NFL games.</p>
<p>The NCAA’s March Madness 2021 tournament marked the launch of the groundbreaking relationship.</p>
<p>Incentive Games is a reputable game developer in markets where high cellular data rates are a barrier to entry. Games have been optimized for Opera Mini Extreme as well.</p>
<p>Incentive Games’ products are also appealing to consumers who do not often participate in traditional casino games. This is particularly advantageous for operators in areas where live sports are in short supply.</p>
