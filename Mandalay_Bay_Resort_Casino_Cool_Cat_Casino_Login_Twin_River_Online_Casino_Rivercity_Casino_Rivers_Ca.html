<p>Gaming InnovationGroup (GiG) has strengthened its executive lineup securing Andrew Cochrane as the company’s new Chief Business Officer for Platform &amp; Sportsbook.

<p>Cochrane’s appointment is tied to GiG’s ambitions to spearhead stronger commercial success and growth, led by the ex-SBTech and DraftKings executive. Cochrane’s track record includes numerous high-profile contracts in his older positions which have allowed him to help expand the footprints of respective businesses he used to work for.</p>
