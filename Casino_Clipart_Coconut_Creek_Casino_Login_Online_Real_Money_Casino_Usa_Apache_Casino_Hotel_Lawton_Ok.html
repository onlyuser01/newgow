    <h1>Casino Clipart Coconut Creek Casino Login Online Real Money Casino Usa Apache Casino Hotel Lawton Ok</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>First of all, I want to clarify that the KYC of my betmotion account was successfully completed, which is why my account is enabled for withdrawals.</p>
<p>I requested 2 withdrawals dated 04/22/2023 (US$1,000.00) and 04/25/2023 (US$697.88) which have not been approved or paid.</p>
<p>I made my deposit via NETELLER and requested the withdrawals by the same payment method accordingly. To date, I have gone to betmotion support more than 5 times to consult about the situation and the only answer they give me is that they have problems with the payment method and that they will inform me as soon as they have news but time passes and passes without that they deposit my money to me.</p>
<p>I am a very old user in betting sites and I am sure that the non-payment has nothing to do with payment method problems, since Neteller is a platform that works without problems and that I still use to deposit and withdraw on other sites today.</p>
<p>In addition, if the problem were to be real, it is betmotion's responsibility to provide alternative payment solutions, such as bank transfer, cryptocurrencies, skrill, or another method by which I can receive my money. Unfortunately they do not pay and do not offer other options to solve the problem.</p>
<p>This situation has been very frustrating and at this point I only think that Betmotion is a scam because they have not behaved to the level that this deserves to give peace of mind and a solution to the client.</p>
<p>Finally, it should be noted that I deposited US$2,000.00 on the site, for which I am withdrawing even less than the amount deposited, that is, I lost money, I did not even make a profit, which often leads betting sites to complicate the withdrawal processes because They don't like winning customers.</p>
<p>I tried to solve this by contacting betmotion but there was no positive response and that is why I have come to leave this complaint.</p>
<p>Hoping you can help to solve, thanks in advance.</p>
