    <h1>Northern California Casinos Krypto Loco Casino Empirecity Casino Online Games Casino White Cloud Cas</h1>

<p>bc game is in my opinion a absolute scam . 90 percent of the players agree if you go to chat and read awhile people‚Äôs comments. They post large wins as click bait to affiliated persons or people that will gamble it back determined by their history of wagering data logged by a i .</p>
<p>And the provable way they claim to verify games is a lie. They claim you have a user seed to make the hash so you can prove they are not altering the game as your playing . However as your rolling any autobet try to change the seed.</p>
<p>What you will find is a notice that it cannot be changed cause seed is in use cause you are actively playing . This is perfect . That means it‚Äôs working right?? No !</p>
<p>if your press it a couple more times it does in fact change the seed in the middle of you betting . Big problem ! not supposed to be the case ! Now here is the kicker you will get the seed is in use notice while manually betting as you play</p>
<p>what does that notice pop up for again? Oh yea when anyone is attempting to change your seed midgame. So what does it suggest? It suggest that while you are rapidly betting that someone is attempting to modify your results as you yourself have seen when you attempt the same thing.</p>
<p>Immediately you will win nothing ! No stratagy works across the entire platform. If you reset the seed yet again. You will receive a lag then a notice socket timed out . You will not see any significant gains after this and will endure a absolute drain of all your crypto . Do it again notice socket time out again.</p>
<p>Every single couple mins after you change the seed.</p>
<p>My last 5 deposit did not even slightly suggest any up and down in my earning it literally was a instadrain script. Any large bet will not hit ! Go try it .</p>
<p>Hilo is artificial intelligence in my educated conclusion playing with data collected about your gambling habbits. I hit 100 false cards in a row . While attempting to switch is up constantly . This is absolutely unreal . People trust these casinos and I watched a man lose $30,000 in a couple hrs. They post on chat people‚Äôs large withdrawals which in my opinion is affiliated members front for moving your huge amount of deposit out to a external account for bc game profit sharing to all those they pay off.</p>
<p>Again in crash multiple people are betting same time right ? Like hundreds of people with large bets on crash . Do a experiment. Max bet a small amount of crypto. Boom insta bust ! But seriously they will bust all these players to make sure your .000010 usdt will not get close to a dollar?Like your failure is more important then hundred of people?</p>
<p>They kept me under one dollar that I was allowed to bet with for literally days without clearing one dollar ??!?!??! Wtf tell me that is not absolute garbage. From $100 to 50cents in less than 30 mins actually being extremely mindful . But left to roll almost to a dollar gif 12 hrs . This is my opinion of bcgame . The way I experienced it . There are much more issues but I‚Äôll try and cut this short. Do Not Use this site ! You will lose everything after a small calculated pump even as high as 750$ . Very few actually end up with anything to withdraw. After I posted my concerns they rained the chats constantly and upped the amount their false idol gives which is normally 8 pennies. Lol .</p>
<p>They take all your crypto and make you beg to coco their idol for pennies to hope you win your money back to save your home and not have your already struggling families be homeless cause they tricked you into having hope of a win that 98% of people won‚Äôt see In my observation.</p>
<p>Btw the list of names on there huge rain list I‚Äôve never seen in chat but you must chat to get rain! At least that‚Äôs what they say . Explain that . I chat everyday for a year and literally got my rain trophy a week ago. That‚Äôs pretty much being excluded from 90 percent of the rain except small amount under a few cents .</p>
<p>The 30$ and even 1$ rains I have never seen a cent of in a year. I suspect it‚Äôs fake profiles going back to the casino or affiliates of the casino. These drops equal to hundreds or thousands a day! But I go 3 months not a rain one .I suspect this is money laundering. But that is my opinion and not fact.</p>
<p>you will be begged for tips by the thousands of people who lost everything! Post a win to chat and a flood of desperation and sad stories .</p>
<p>also It shows past wins and wagers but not withdrawals. I have wagered $87,000 in bets .</p>
<p>I have cashed out $100 once.</p>
<p>Even martingale stratagy will fail as they will cause you to bet entire bank roll due to so many loses. Not logical. Never would happen in real life . Happens ever time to me on this site. That‚Äôs over 20 loses in a row on games like blackjack or roulette. üòëüòêüôÑ yea that def rng !?!</p>
<p>They have been caught cheating in the past but the article won‚Äôt show on google search anymore . You can find it still but have to dig.</p>
