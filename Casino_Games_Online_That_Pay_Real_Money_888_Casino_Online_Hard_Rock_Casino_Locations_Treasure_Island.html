    <h1>Casino Games Online That Pay Real Money 888 Casino Online Hard Rock Casino Locations Treasure Island</h1>

<p>Dear alebirman,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. I have checked the terms and conditions, and this is what I found (here):</p>
<p>15- The minimum reinvestment requirements prior to a withdrawal are x1 (one). If the total bet (the amount of bets placed) is less than the deposit amount, we reserve the right to cancel all winnings and charge a commission of 10% (ten percent) (never less than USD 0.50 (fifty cents). ) of the amount of the last deposit as transaction fees, and 15% (fifteen percent) of commission if the balance of your account has been loaded through a card or bank transfer). The X1 reinvestment requirement will be conditioned to:</p>
<p>15.1 Sports bets made with odds greater than 1.50 or -200.</p>
<p>15.2 Maximum amount of bet allowed per currency is: USD 50 – 40,000.00CLP- 880 MXN- 180 PEN- 250 BRL- 390 GTQ- 1,250 Bs.S- 345 BOB.</p>
<p>15.3 Special bets on handicap, over / under, both teams to score, total goals, cashout, live bets or other types of complex bets; will not qualify to meet the rollover requirement.</p>
<p>15.4 Bets on virtual events will not count towards the rollover requirement.</p>
<p>15.5 Live Casino plays will not count towards the rollover requirement.</p>
<p>15.6 Bets placed on special games such as Black Jack, Baccarat, Poker and Roulette will not count towards the calculation of the rollover requirement.</p>
<p>It is not unusual for a casino to have this rule. Some casinos require deposit wagering of 1x, some 3x or 5x, but you can find casinos with even higher wagering requirements for real money.</p>
<p>Mandatory real money wagering has been introduced by the AML (Anti-Money Laundering) Regulations for the Gaming and Gambling Industry and is usually set by the Licensing Authority. All serious and licensed casinos have to comply and follow these policies.</p>
<p>Do I understand correctly that you have played and lost your winnings?</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
