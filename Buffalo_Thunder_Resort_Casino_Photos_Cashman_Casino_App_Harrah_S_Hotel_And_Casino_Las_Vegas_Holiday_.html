<p>Information about fruit slots</p>
<p>Fruit slot reels are one of the most iconic images in the gambling world. The colorful symbols have tempted players to try their luck for well over a hundred years, going back to the famous Liberty Bell machine invented by Herbert Mills in 1907.</p>
<p>The Liberty Bell was a simple automatic mechanism with three reels that could read sequences to give a payout for certain combinations. Its popularity led to many copycat devices, including the Operator's Bell, which sometimes came with a chewing gum reward to circumvent strict gambling laws. The various flavours of the gum, the famous slot fruits, inspired the makers to use them as symbols and the fruit slot was born.</p>
<p>The machines stayed this way for over 50 years, until machine specialists Bally invented the first electromechanic fruit slot, Money Honey, in 1963 — a forefather of today's electronic games. The first video slot appeared in 1976, while Reel 'Em In became the first slot to offer a second screen bonus twenty years later.</p>
<p>The internet age saw many developers create fruit slots aimed at the growing online market. Slots fans could play from the comfort of their homes for the first time in online casinos, and they had a wider choice of games to choose from.</p>
<p>Today, many iGaming developers produce online fruit slots which boast super-smooth gameplay, attractive prizes and shiny graphics. You can try hundreds of them out on this page for free, so you can get to know the workings of the game before committing money.</p>
<p>Fruit slots titles</p>
<p>If you're looking for great fruit titles to try out, then there are some gems on this page that will entertain you for hours.</p>
<p>One of these is 20 Super Hot by EGT. It lives up to its name with some scorching prizes on offer, particularly the bonuses you can access through the Wild 7 and Scattered Star symbols. The highlight, however, is the Double-Up feature that lets you double your prize by choosing red or black, and you can do this up to five times to build a hefty prize. The fire theme is on show throughout with some nice touches, such as setting the symbols alight and burning the fruits.</p>
<p>For a less conventional theme, try out Jammin' Jars by Push Gaming. Backed by a funky disco-style soundtrack, you compete for prizes on a Candy Crush-style 8x8 grid, something that will appeal to fans of the famous mobile game. As usual, different fruit combinations equal different prizes, including a Rainbow feature that occurs randomly: this flashes over the reels, adding big fruits to create winning combinations. The key moment in the game is landing the Wilds, or Jammin' Jar, symbol — three of which will get you into a generous bonus game.</p>
<p>If you're after something with a futuristic feel, then Kajot's Neon Fruits is a fun title to have a blast on. With frequent re-spins and a x8 multiplier on offer, it always feels like a win is close. The fruit symbols adopt a neon aesthetic and glimmer every time you take a spin, while the sci-fi music is a nice accompaniment.</p>
<p>So, if you're after a fruit slot experience, then this page has something to cater to every taste. Try your luck in the free mode and get all the fun of a traditional fruit slot without spending a cent!</p>
