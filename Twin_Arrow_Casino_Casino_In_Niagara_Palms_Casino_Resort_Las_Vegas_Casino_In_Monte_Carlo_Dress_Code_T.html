<p>Flutter Entertainment brand FanDuel has teamed up with Grupo Globo to provide the latter’s Cartola FC brand with daily fantasy sports (DFS) solutions. The pair are developing a new paid platform dedicated to the DFS experience by the name of Cartola Express, marking an ambitious expansion move for the vertical in Brazil.</p>
<p>Grupo Globo to Leverage Its Strong Ties with Audiences</p>
<p>As the largest media conglomerate in the country, Grupo Globo is well-positioned to use its local contacts and leverage them into success. It’s estimated that through its various content offerings, focusing on sports and entertainment programs, Grupo Globo reaches 99.6% of the country’s population.</p>
<p>The group’s linear channels alone register as many as 100 million unique spectators every day. The Cartola FC platform is a leading DFS behemoth in the market with 17 million app downloads and 10 million active fantasy teams since the solution launched in 2005.</p>
<p>There are 435,000 Cartola PRO customer subscriptions, indicating that consumers are willing to pay for a better, more dedicated service as well. Grupo has leveraged its ties with the media sector and integrated the Cartola FC solutions directly into its sports media ecosystem to boost engagement and awareness for the product.</p>
<p>FanDuel Arrives to Assist with Subscription-Based DFS</p>
<p>Cartola FC is equally advertised and pushed across various influencer networks, social and digital media channels. Now that FanDuel is stepping in, the company will leverage its extensive know-how in the DFS market in North America and help Cartola Express establish itself as a new derivative brand that will focus on a subscription model entirely and operate side-by-side with the already established Cartola FC and Cartola PRO.</p>
<p>Commenting on this opportunity, FanDuel CEO Amy Howe said that Grupo Globo had been a pioneer in the Brazilian fantasy sports market, providing a unique service to millions of players integrated with the group’s media holdings. Howe added:</p>
<p>“This exciting initiative allows us to contribute to that success by adding FanDuel’s proven product capabilities and cutting-edge services. We’re looking forward to being a part of this initiative, offering players a new service and the next generation of fantasy sports in Brazil.” FanDuel CEO Amy Howe</p>
<p>Demand for Fantasy Sports Grows in Brazil</p>
<p>Grupo Globo CEO for Cartola Express, Newton Filho, added that the DFS continues to grow in Brazil, making it the perfect time to launch the new product and elevate the consumer experience:</p>
<p>“We’re proud to count on the expertise of FanDuel, which has been a leader in this field in the United States for more than ten years, and we’re confident that our players will enjoy the benefits of their experience,” Filho explained, citing the company’s success in the vertical so far.</p>
<p>FanDuel’s expertise in one of the biggest DFS markets will prove invaluable to the success of the Cartola Express product, he concluded.</p>
