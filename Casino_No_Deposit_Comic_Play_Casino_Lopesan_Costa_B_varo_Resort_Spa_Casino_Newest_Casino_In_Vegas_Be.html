<p>Good morning</p>
<p>I would like to raise a complaint in the hope that this will be resolved before I raise a dispute with your regulator Curaçao egaming.</p>
<p>I have deposited over £2k to this account and as of today I had a balance of over 8k.</p>
<p>I have been informed that my account has been closed and will be returning £444 to me. You are citing responsibile gambling as a reason, this clearly does not relate to this. Saving paying out £7.5k is clearly the reason and your business model is to make money from customers.</p>
<p>During a live chat an agent referred me to point 9 of your terms and conditions, this states that winnings may be taken from any duplicate account. It is beyond comprehension that you would also take £1.5k in deposits. This is completely unfair and does not align with your conditions. How can you justify this?</p>
<p>Your conditions state about duplicate accounts, I do not recall opening an account with you previously, however it seems that I do which has been blocked. Therefore i do not have 2 active accounts which is the issue implied within your terms and conditions.</p>
<p>I therefore request that you pay out the £8k to reflect the balance in my account. As a minimum you should pay £2k to reflect the amount deposited. As a compromise I request you pay £5k.</p>
<p>If you do not agree I will report your unethical and cruel actions to your regulator. I will also be posting my experiences on numerous review sites.</p>
<p>I'm conclusion your actions and lack of transparency have left me suicidal and feeling desperate and helpless that you can just steak 8k from me.</p>
