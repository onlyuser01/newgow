    <h1>Newport Casino The Mill Casino Island Resort Casino Michigan Metropolis Il Casino Online Casino Free</h1>

<p>Both teams from the north end of the English capital are doing great in the 2023-24 season, each with 13 points (4-1-0 record) at the moment. The Spurs have a better score difference thanks to their superb offense, but the Gunners have been exceptional at the back. Knowing all this, it’s only logical to assume that we’re in for a real thrill on Sunday.</p>

<p>The Gunners Keeping the Title Dream Alive</p>
<p>It’s been 20 years since Arsenal won the Premier League the last time. The Gunners came really close to winning the trophy last season, and if it weren’t for some blunders in the final moments of the season, they would’ve done it.</p>
<p>In the 2023-24 season, Arsenal’s roster looks fantastic. This team seems stronger than last season, although some of its newcomers still need time to adjust to how things are done at Emirates. Kai Havertz, who came from Chelsea during the last transfer window, really needs to up his game. Knowing how good this guy was in the Blue part of London, we think it’s just a matter of time before he starts shining again.</p>
<p>More good news for the Gunners is that some of the players who were struggling with injuries are back. The most notable case is the one of Gabriel Jesus, who finally seems ready to make his first Premier League start since May.</p>
<p>The Spurs Might be Punching Above Their Wait</p>
<p>It’s fair to say that not many people had faith in Tottenham ahead of the 2023-24 season, especially after their captain Harry Kane moved to Bayern Munich. But the Spurs have proved the doubters wrong. Ange Postecoglou’s men have been great in the Premier League, winning four of their five matches. The only one that they didn’t win finished in a draw.</p>
<p>Truth be told, the Spurs still haven’t played against such a tough opponent as Arsenal. The toughest opponent they faced this season is Manchester United, a team that’s been struggling a lot with issues inside the locker room.</p>
<p>Plus, in their most recent EPL game, they struggled a lot against Sheffield United. They were 1-0 down until the eighth minute of the stoppage time when Richarlison equalized. Two minutes later, the same player assisted Dejan Kulusevski for the winner.</p>
<p>Arsenal vs. Tottenham Prediction</p>
<p>Which team will win the North London Derby on Sunday? We think it’s going to be Arsenal. Sure, Tottenham has been nothing short of impressive so far, but when it comes to player quality, Arsenal has the edge.</p>
<p>Pick: Arsenal to win</p>
