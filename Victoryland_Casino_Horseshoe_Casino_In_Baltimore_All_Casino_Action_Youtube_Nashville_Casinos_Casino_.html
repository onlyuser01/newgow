<p>Playtech is thrilled to provide its reliable partner with more sports betting machines while expanding its own reach</p>
<p>Gambling software developer Playtech announced an extension of its exclusive partnership with Betfred. The two companies will continue their collaboration, which will see the former company supply the operator with more sports betting machines.</p>
<p>As agreed, more Playtech Self Service Betting Terminals will be installed in Betfred shops, helping Betfred keep up with the rising demand for sports betting. Over the past two years, the number of such machines employed by Betfred has swelled by a stellar 50%.</p>
<p>In addition, the expanded deal will make horse and dog racing markets available to Betfred customers for the first time. In addition to that, a variety of recent exciting features and products will be added to Betfred’s arsenal. These include Playtech’s new and improved Betbuilder, dynamic content display and premium content.</p>
<p>Playtech has cemented its reputation as a top provider of retail sports betting terminals. The company is famous for the quality of its products and its exclusive features. Betfred, on the other hand, is a top sports betting operator that will greatly benefit from the deal and expanded lineup of Playtech machines.</p>
<p>Playtech Is Happy about the Opportunity to Reach More Players</p>
<p>The expanded agreement was addressed by representatives of the two companies.</p>
<p>Betfred’s group chief operating officer, Mark Stebbings, said that the agreement highlights the importance of the relationship between the two companies. He lauded Playtech as a market leader in retail betting machines and said that Betfred’s deal with the supplier will only continue to grow in importance.</p>
<p>The importance of Betting terminals to our retail offer continues to increase, becoming an increasingly essential gaming component for our customers and, therefore, a crucial part of the future of our company. Mark Stebbings. COO, Betfred</p>
<p>Shimon Akad, Playtech’s chief operating officer, also commented on the agreement. He said that Betfred is a major gambling business that continues to grow in strength and popularity. Akad is happy about the opportunity to supply Betfred with more machines, helping it meet the demands of its players.</p>
<p>Expanding the capacity of the Betfred offering through both more terminals and an ever-increasing range of betting events and exciting features has been a key pillar of our work together as we continue to develop new technologies aimed at digitizing the retail space and adapting to the changing Retail customer demands. Shimon Akad, CEO, Playtech</p>
<p>Akad added that there is still room to improve and further develop this partnership. He concluded that the Playtech team continues to look for opportunities to proliferate the company’s products and machines.</p>
