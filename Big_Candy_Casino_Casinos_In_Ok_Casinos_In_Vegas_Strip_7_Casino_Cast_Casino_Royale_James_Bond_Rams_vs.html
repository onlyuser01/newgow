<p>The Rams are Back on the Right Track</p>
<p>After beating the Seattle Seahawks on the road last Thursday, the Rams once again look like one of the top Super Bowl contenders. The victory is important for them for another reason – it brought them back on the winning track, following the defeat to the Arizona Cardinals in Week 4.</p>
<p>The Rams’ next game is against the Giants, which is one of the least impressive teams in the league. Furthermore, the Rams have a pretty good record against this team. In fact, the last time they played in East Rutherford, the Rams won 51-17.</p>
<p>What’s interesting is that in that game, the QB for the Giants was legendary Eli Manning. The QB for the Rams was Jared Goff, who’s now playing for the Detroit Lions. The Rams’ QB in 2021 is Matthew Stafford, who’s been brilliant since the start of the season.</p>
<p>Stafford has made at least one touchdown pass in every game for the Rams. What’s even more impressive is that he’s been averaging 317.4 yards per game, which makes him one of the best passers in the league.</p>
<p>The Giants are Coming Off the Worst Loss of the Season</p>
<p>On Sunday evening, the Giants suffered their fourth loss of the season. It happened in Dallas, where the Cowboys beat them 44-20. This was the Giants’ worst defeat since September 2020. Their defense was nowhere to be seen in that game, allowing Cowboys QB Dak Prescott to make three touchdown passes.</p>
<p>The Giants’ offense was almost equally unimpressive, although there’s an explanation for that. Their starting QB, Daniel Jones, suffered a concussion in the second quarter and was replaced by Mike Glennon, who ended up having a decent game.</p>
<p>In the same game, the Giants also lost Saquon Barkley to an injury. The running back suffered an ankle sprain in that game but could recover in time for the Rams game. The same goes for Jones, who will probably lead the Giants’ offense against the Rams.</p>
<p>Still, with or without those guys in the team, the Giants just don’t look good enough to beat the Rams. Instead, all they can hope is to not get embarrassed on Sunday.</p>
<p>Pick: Rams to win but not cover the spread; the over should hit.</p>
