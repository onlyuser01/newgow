    <h1>Everett Casino Poseidon Casino Hotel Vegas Point Place Casino Casino Supermarch Gold Country Casino</h1>

<p>Dear Vikram,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about the issue and understand your frustration.</p>
<p>I carefully checked the Bonus Terms on the website, and this is what I found https://www.pokiesparlour.com/info/terms-and-conditions:</p>
<p>„While a bonus is active, a player is subject to a maximum bet amount. The maximum bet amount is $5 or 10% of the available balance, whichever is lower. (the 10% rule does not apply is the player balance is under $5). Betting a larger amount or a larger proportion of the balance while the bonus is active may lead to the voiding of this particular bonus and winnings and any subsequent bonus and winnings. Repeated abuse can lead to confiscation of all balances and closure of the account.</p>
<p>While a bonus is active, the whole balance is subject to these rules, including funds pending for withdrawal.</p>
<p>A bonus is active until the wagering requirement has been met."</p>
<p>We would like to see casinos implementing systems that would prevent players from placing higher than allowed bets, but, unfortunately, this is not a standard practice yet. You were not stopped or blocked when you decided to increase your bet, and, as a result, you breached the maximum bet rule.</p>
<p>If you are aware of placing higher bets than the allowed ones, sadly, there is not much we can do to support your case at this time. I would strongly recommend reading all the T&amp;Cs carefully before you start playing to avoid any misunderstandings in the future. Casinos try to design their bonuses to be as attractive as possible, but the rules must always be followed.</p>
<p>Please do not hesitate to forward your game and bonus histories along with any relevant communication to petronela.k@casino.guru if you feel that you’ve been accused mistakenly, otherwise, I will be forced to reject your complaint. Thank you in advance for your reply and understanding.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
