<p>Moriarty Megaways review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>This game has a dark Sherlock Holmes theme.</p>
<p>Rather than being hosted by the famous detective Sherlock Holmes, players will arrive in a world dominated by his nemesis Professor Moriarty. The atmosphere has a creepy haunted vibe to match the villainous namesake.</p>
<p>Players will enjoy wandering the streets of London and watching over their shoulder for spooky intruders.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The tension-inducing soundtrack features mournful violin notes. This feels perfect for the dreary setting and adds a nod to Sherlock’s love of the violin. A ghoulish voiceover welcomes players to the game and occasionally makes cryptic comments.</p>
<p>The reels are ornately framed and display symbols including chess pieces, signet rings, and the ominous Professor Moriarty himself. He sneers at the players from their reels as if daring them to try to beat him.</p>
<p>The Sherlock and Watson characters have furrowed brows and suspicious expressions. The shadowy animation of their faces adds a sense of mystery to their look.</p>
<p>In the background, the foggy streets of London are illuminated by street lamps. This transports players to a Victorian time and makes the story's setting seem real.</p>
<p>Overall, the animation and soundtrack of this game create an immersive sense of place that supports the game’s theme.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>This game uses the Megaways System, meaning that the number of symbols on the reels is randomised for each spin.</p>
<p>Above the main reels, this game has a horizontal tracker which adds a symbol above reels 2, 3, 4, and 5.</p>
<p>Wins are awarded for matching symbols on adjacent reels from left to right.</p>
<p>This game uses a cascade feature which means that symbols that are part of winning combinations disappear upon payouts. This creates open positions for fresh symbols to fall in.</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Bonus, Mystery and special Sherlock and Watson symbols.</p>
<p>When players land 3 Bonus symbols, this triggers 15 Free Spins. During the feature, players can be given +5 spins for landing additional Bonus symbols. During the Free Spins feature, an increasing multiplier is triggered.</p>
<p>Players will have the option to buy into the Moriarty Free Spins Super Bonus if they choose to. This feature contains greater numbers of Watson and Sherlock symbols than the regular Free Spins Feature.</p>
<p>The Sherlock symbol only lands in the horizontal tracker above the reels. When players collect 3 Sherlock symbols, this unlocks the Sherlock reels.</p>
<p>The Watson symbol is only found in the horizontal tracker as well, and collecting 3 allows players to unlock the Watson reels.</p>
<p>Mystery symbols can transform into any symbol, excluding Wild, Bonus, Sherlock, or Watson symbols. Mystery symbols will only be found on the Watson reels.</p>
<p>Possibly to trigger randomly during any spin, Sherlock’s Max Megaways awards a multiplier that increases after every cascade win.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>

<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.20 up to a maximum of $/£/€20.00 per spin.</p>

<p>Conclusion</p>
