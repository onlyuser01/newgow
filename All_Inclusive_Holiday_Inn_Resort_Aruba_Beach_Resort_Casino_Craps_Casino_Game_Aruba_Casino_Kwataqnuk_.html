<p>The leading betting and gaming brand, Betway, announced it expanded its ambassador portfolio with the addition of Andy Roddick, the famous American former professional tennis player. This week, the company revealed that he was designated as its new global tennis ambassador. Betway vowed that Roddick will deliver unique insights for some of the biggest tournaments within the sport throughout the packed tennis season.</p>
<p>His extensive knowledge will undoubtedly help him in his new role, allowing him to bring valuable and exclusive information not only for the upcoming tennis events but for players as well. Ultimately, the new collaboration between Betway and Roddick is expected to elevate the experiences for tennis fans and bettors alike, creating new opportunities for engagement.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the collaboration, the former tennis pro player will participate in different activations. As a global tennis ambassador for the betting company, Roddick will write a column for some of the biggest competitions in the sport.</p>
<p>Anthony Werkman, Betway's CEO, shared his excitement about the new collaboration in a statement. "It’s great to welcome Andy Roddick to our team of global ambassadors! Andy is a household name within tennis and his opinion and insight is going to be hugely valuable to readers of his column," he added.</p>
<p>According to Werkman, Roddick joins at the perfect moment, considering the recent launch of Advantage Served, Betway's new creative platform that delivers unique insights for the company's customers. "As we know, our customers are driven by data and statistics and our new platform will offer cutting-edge insights that will enhance the match experience to loyal tennis fans," explained Werkman in conclusion.</p>
<p>It was more than a decade ago, in 2012, when Roddick retired after the US Open. Since then, the former tennis pro played an important role within the media vertical, participating in events for Fox Sports Live, BBC, as well as the Tennis Channel.</p>
<p>Sharing his excitement to join Betway, Roddick pointed out: "I’m delighted to be joining one of the world’s biggest betting brands and look forward to helping the tennis community with valuable insights as we approach some of the biggest global tournaments, particularly with the US Open on the horizon."</p>
<p>Currently, Betway has a strong presence in the tennis vertical. The company has signed deals with 11 tournaments around the globe on the ATP Tour, such as Hamburg Open, Miami Open, as well as Rio Open, among others.</p>
