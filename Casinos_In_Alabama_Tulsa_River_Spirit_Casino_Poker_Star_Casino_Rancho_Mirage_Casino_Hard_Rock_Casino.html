<p>What States Is BetRivers Sportsbook Available In?</p>
<p>BetRivers has not been twiddling its fingers, expanding its online sportsbook footprint significantly under the guidance of Rush Street Interactive and well across the United States. Presently, the sportsbook is running shop in Iowa, Illinois, Colorado, Michigan, Indiana, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey among others.</p>
<p>The online sportsbook is tied to a brick-and-mortar partner in all states, but the skins are localized. So, you would play with BetRivers PA in Pennsylvania but BetRivers MI in Michigan. Finding the correct skin is not a concern of yours as the brand uses GeoComply, a solution that automatically finds the right sportsbook for you, saving you some of the hassles.</p>
<p>BetRivers Pennsylvania</p>
<p>Retail launch : December 2018</p>
<p>: December 2018 Mobile launch: June 2020</p>
<p>BetRivers made its debut in Pennsylvania in 2019, aided by Rush Street Interactive, the company’s technological platform provider. The launch has been a success with a mobile app launched first for Android and then later for iOS, offering full market access to betting markets, bonuses, and VIP rewards. The sportsbook operates under BetRivers PA in the Keystone State.</p>
<p>The company’s local partner, the Rivers Casino, has been able to complement the mobile betting experience with rewarding retail offers. The sports betting service at the Rivers Casino in Philadelphia is top-notch, and it immerses sports fans in a highly-rewarding and engaging betting environment. You’ll find all the amenities you can expect from a proper retail venue if you choose to visit Rivers Casino in person.</p>
<p>BetRivers Indiana</p>
<p>Retail launch : September 2019</p>
<p>: September 2019 Mobile launch: October 2019</p>
<p>Rush Street hasn’t lost any of that momentum, and it made sure that BetRivers is present in the majority of major sports betting states as they become available. In Indiana, the company teamed up with French Lick Casino to set up both retail shops as well as introduce the dedicated BetRivers app for additional options.</p>
<p>College basketball is a huge part of the Indiana sports betting landscape, leading to numerous opportunities for BetRivers customers. Possible teams to back during March Madness include Notre Dame Fighting Irish and Hoosiers, along with other talented, athletic outfits.</p>
<p>Apart from betting on NCAAB and NCAAF teams, though, sports fans have the opportunity to benefit from odds boosts in the state and pick any major betting market they might be interested in.</p>
<p>BetRivers Illinois</p>
<p>Retail launch : March 2020</p>
<p>: March 2020 Mobile launch: June 2020</p>
<p>Illinois is another big state in which BetRivers online sportsbook made a mark fairly recently. With the legalization of the industry in 2020, BetRivers didn’t wait for log to gain an entry, once again backed by Rush Street. It was, in fact, the first sportsbook and mobile app to launch in the Prairie State, securing a decent market share ever since.</p>
<p>The company teamed up locally with Rivers Casino Des Plaines and ran under the dedicated BetRivers IL skin in the state. Originally, Illinois had a rule, similar to Iowa, that obliged all sports bettors to register in person before proceeding to mobile betting. Thankfully, the contentious rule has been scrapped, and participation and engagement have picked up.</p>
<p>Once again, BetRivers runs a generous $250 sign up offer accessible with the bonus code: 250MATCH. If you are looking for a great sportsbook in Illinois, BetRivers is it.</p>
<p>BetRivers Colorado</p>

<p>: TBA Mobile launch: May 2020</p>
<p>BetRivers didn’t waste time or effort in 2020, bringing its offer up to speed in yet another crucial sports betting market. Colorado was a natural pick for the online sportsbook. BetRivers launched in May with the help of Rush Street, running a dedicated mobile offer without a land-based partner as of today. This has not stopped the sportsbook from offering cutting-edge sports betting opportunities.</p>
<p>In BetRivers CO, you can expect to find the same great $250 welcome bonus that will start your experience with a hefty bankroll and numerous opportunities to explore some of the finest sporting events.</p>
<p>BetRivers Iowa</p>
<p>Retail launch : TBA</p>
<p>: TBA Mobile launch: January 2021</p>

<p>The dedicated app brings numerous opportunities for wagering on sports to customers in the Hawkeye State, and it comes on the back of a decision to scrap the in-person registration rule, which reigned until January 2021.

<p>BetRivers Michigan</p>

The company even went ahead with a pre-launch offer, introducing a $50 in site credit ahead of its official start of business. The bonus applied to both the BetRivers casino and sportsbook.</p>
<p>New Jersey</p>
<p>Retail launch : NA</p>
<p>: NA Mobile launch: NA</p>

The app is available for both iOS and Android users, and all in all, BetRivers NJ is the core offer of the online sportsbook.</p>
<p>How to Start Betting at BetRivers?</p>
<p>BetRivers makes for a neat and quick experience when it comes to its sportsbook. Everything is intuitive whether you are accessing the sportsbook from desktop or mobile. The button is large so that the UI and UX feel familiar even if you haven’t visited the website before. The sportsbook’s familiarity is the result of careful market positioning by BetRivers, which has done its due diligence to create intuitive products.</p>
<p>To place a bet, all you need to do is navigate the myriad sporting events located on the left-hand side. You’ll find numerous big sports you can bet on. Clicking on any of those will reveal what events, leagues, and competitions are currently available.</p>
<p>Make sure to navigate to the specific event you are interested in and click on the outcome you wish to back. This could be Moneyline, Spread, Totals, or something else, depending on what markets are currently available for this event.</p>
<p>Once you do, the BetRivers’ Bet Slip will appear on the right-hand side and invite you to enter the amount you wish to bet. This will also come with a quick calculation of how much you stand to win back if you proceed.</p>
<p>Once you are done with this, you are good to go. You have placed your wager, and all that is left for you to do is wait for the outcome. In case you are betting on live sports, a popular feature with BetRivers, you can participate more actively and even withdraw your money before an event finishes. This sportsbook function is known as “cashout.”</p>
<p>Available Betting Markets at BetRivers Sportsbook</p>
<p>BetRivers online sportsbook has clearly spared no effort in bringing you numerous viable betting markets. You will find yourself choosing from numerous opportunities to bet on favorite sports such as football, basketball, baseball, hockey, golf, tennis, martial arts, motorsports, Rugby League and Rugby Union, cricket, cycling, darts, Australian rules, handball, snooker, soccer, table tennis, and more.</p>
<p>To be quite frank with you, there is an almost overwhelming variety of sports you can choose from, whether you are at the Rivers Casino in Pittsburgh or accessing the website’s offer through the dedicated BetRivers mobile app. In terms of events, you will find numerous opportunities to bet on.</p>
<p>BetRivers makes sure to cover not just all popular bet types, but also all big events that matter to sports fans. This means that NCAAB and NCAAF events are covered in their entirety, including March Madness and the string of college bowls for football.</p>
<p>You will be able to bet on the Kentucky Derby, U.S. Open, and Wimbledon, and needless to say, participate in various Super Bowl contests, NBA regular season and playoff games, and wager on The Masters. There is really something for everyone with BetRivers, and the sportsbook relies on both the variety and depth of the available markets.</p>
<p>Those of you willing to bet on UFC and boxing events can very well do so. NASCAR and IndyCar are similarly covered by BetRivers. There is a great variety of sports as well as bet types, including Moneyline, Spread, Player Props, Totals, and more.</p>
<p>How Competitive Are BetRivers Odds?</p>
<p>BetRivers offers are certainly worthwhile. The promotions are extensive and easy to use, and so is the online banking system made simple thanks to the company’s operation in whitelisted jurisdictions. Yet, one thing that often plays a huge importance in sports fans’ decisions on whether to pick one sportsbook over another is how competitive the odds are.</p>
<p>In this sense, there seems to be little to suggest that BetRivers’ odds are anything, but some of the finest a sportsbook can offer. As numerous betting options proliferate on the website, we have put the available lines and fixtures to close scrutiny and were very happy with the results.</p>
<p>BetRivers keeps its odds on par with all available sportsbooks on the market. Naturally, some odds maybe a little better or a little worse, depending on the event. BetRivers uses its own dedicated algorithms to crunch numbers and come up with competitive fixtures that will make your next bet slightly more favorable.</p>
<p>Live Betting on Sports with BetRivers</p>
<p>A quick look through the BetRivers sports betting calendar will tell you that the sportsbook is running a busy schedule. Yet, there are many upsides to this, and specifically when it comes to the available betting options. In-play or live betting is touted as a fan-favorite as it allows you quite a bit of flexibility and a deeper level of engagement.</p>
<p>Naturally, BetRivers’ desktop and betting app solutions support this type of market, and you will have numerous opportunities to bet in real-time on NFL, NBA, MLB, and all sorts of other games. The bets will naturally range, and many will cover player props or focus on quarters and half-time results.</p>
<p>The odds will change rapidly during live streaming betting, so it’s good to know that the overall challenge you will experience betting live will go up as well. Nevertheless, BetRivers has many ways to make this more fun, and admittedly safer to sports fans.</p>
<p>You can bet on various outcomes, but the sportsbook will also offer you an opportunity to cash out your winnings half-way through on many occasions. You’ll find numerous ways to balance between your in-play and pre-game betting, and the added benefit of having a live streaming option to launch games live is definitely a huge upside.</p>
<p>You can access live streaming both on the sportsbook app as well as on the desktop website. Which you prefer is down to personal choice really. In our experience, BetRivers’ in-play markets are flexible and competitive, making for a great overall experience from a consumer standpoint.</p>
<p>BetRivers Sportsbook Payments</p>
<p>To simplify the process of online banking, BetRivers lists numerous deposit methods and withdrawal options. They all come in handy and ensure that you have great ways to manage your funds and bankrolls. Deposits are usually instant and most withdrawal methods BetRivers offers usually take a very short time to transact your money outside of the sportsbook. The deposit methods you may use include but aren’t limited to:</p>
<p>Credit cards</p>
<p>Debit cards</p>
<p>Play+ Prepaid Card</p>
<p>In-person</p>
<p>PayNearMe</p>
<p>Not all of these banking options are available for withdrawal, but they add great flexibility. Some sports fans prefer to bet with their bank cards, as they are familiar and easy to use. Yet, others opt for slightly more secure payment methods such as a prepaid card.</p>
<p>In honesty, the payment options you get at Rush Street’s flagship betting brand are all very safe. You will have no trouble transacting money to and from BetRivers, and if you did end up running in a pickle, customer service would always be there to sort you out.</p>
<p>These payment options are also available for the BetRivers Casino, which makes it even easier for consumers to change between game, betting, and other options. Pick the deposit and withdrawal options that make the most sense for you. You can claim the sportsbook bonus with any of them.</p>
<p>BetRivers Mobile App</p>
<p>A huge upside of the offer is naturally the app. BetRivers’ betting app is a state-of-the-art solution that powers not just the mobile betting experience, but adds a whole new level of engagement and immersion. At a time when over 90% of sports fans choose to go after mobile betting, delivering a disappointing app is not really an option.</p>
<p>Aware of this, the BetRivers app is on-par with fans’ expectations, offering great functionality, bonuses, an integrated live chat and customer support option, as well as access to numerous online sports betting markets. The BetRivers app will run neatly on your iPhone or iPad as well as any Android smartphone and tablet.</p>
<p>To make download simpler, you can find the app on the Google and Apple Store or simply download the Android installation file and start the process.</p>
<p>Is BetRivers Sportsbook Safe?</p>
<p>Yes, BetRivers is quite safe. In fact, the sportsbook is licensed by at least one regulatory authority in each state it operates, with over eight different skins now set up with the help of Rush Street. The betting site is constantly monitored by the regulator and bettors themselves can liaise with regulators and lodged complaints in case they suspect foul play.</p>
<p>However, BetRivers reputation remains sterling. The different websites use advanced secure socket layer (SSL) encryption technology and are vetted by independent third parties and the state regulator in each jurisdiction.</p>
<p>In addition, the sportsbook is dedicated to tackling problem gambling and complies with AML and KYC safety checks, such as varying your date of birth, name, and address to rule out illegal or fraudulent activities. Overall, BetRivers is a benchmark for safety in the wagering industry.</p>
<p>Customer Service</p>
<p>In terms of customer service and potential, BetRivers makes sure to provide customers with the highest degree of online sports betting experience. Customers are welcome to benefit from a reliable offer. In case you un in trouble, however, the website and betting app have dedicated customer service for you to get in touch with.</p>
<p>Customer support is always there to assist you through the dedicated Help Center. You may opt for various support options, including live chat, email or phone. Alternatively, you can visit a property in person, although this is admittedly a much lengthier process.</p>
<p>We recommend using the live chat as the quickest option that will provide you with quick results and an actionable solution.</p>
<p>Final Word: What We Make of BetRivers?</p>
<p>Out of the many online sportsbooks out there, BetRivers offers great real money betting options. The company is dedicated to delivering a bonafide experience to sports bettors of all hues. Players will find numerous opportunities to enjoy the wagering experience benefit from great bonuses and participate in live betting options. Our BetRivers review found no faults with the existing mobile betting, and we can confirm that BetRivers is on par with industry standards and therefore a worthy pick if you are looking for great online sports betting communities.</p>
