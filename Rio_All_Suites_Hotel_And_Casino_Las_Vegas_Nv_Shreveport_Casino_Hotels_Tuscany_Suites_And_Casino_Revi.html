<p>DraftKings has been busy lately. It continues to run in acquisition mode, eyeing several high-profile targets, but is also securing key partnerships that will set it apart from the rest of the sports betting operators. The latest involve the NHL and Turner Sports, with the operator soon to be prominently featured with both.</p>
<p>NHL and DraftKings Join Forces</p>
<p>The NHL has made DraftKings its official sports betting, fantasy sports and iGaming partner. DraftKings started as a fantasy sports provider being segueing into sports betting and, ultimately, online casinos, completing the trifecta of online gaming. Now, it will have access to NHL assets, including its official branding options and logos, as well as themed sweepstakes and other promotional initiatives during the entire NHL season.</p>
<p>The timing of the partnership coincides with the start of the new NHL season, which is going to give DraftKings a great deal of exposure across the league’s games. It will also be seen during the NHL All-Star Weekend, as well as the Stanley Cup playoffs and final championship. Soon, hockey fans will see DraftKings pop up everywhere, with integrations coming to all of the league’s digital and linear media platforms.</p>
<p>NHL Chief Business Officer And Senior Executive VP Keith Wachtel stated, “We’re proud to welcome back DraftKings to the NHL family, and look forward to collaborating together with Turner Sports – one of our valued media partners – to develop unique and exciting content for our fans.”</p>
<p>DraftKings Recruited by WarnerMedia</p>
<p>As DraftKings was shaking hands with the NHL, it was also working out a deal with WarnerMedia, specifically, the company’s Turner Sports division. The operator is now the exclusive sportsbook and daily fantasy sports provider for the company, which will see it deliver sports betting data and fantasy sports content across Turner’s telecasts, as well as Bleacher Report. DraftKings and Bleacher Report will build on a relationship that has been in place since the beginning of the year, when they introduced a new Super Bowl prop bets option.</p>
<p>Of both new partnerships, DraftKings co-founder, chairman and CEO Jason Robins asserted, “Over the years DraftKings has become a brand synonymous with sports, with a fan-first approach through real-money gaming options, and we look forward to collaborating with the NHL alongside Turner Sports and Bleacher Report to provide hockey fans with what’s next in sports.”</p>
