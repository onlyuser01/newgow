<p>and what I still haven’t heard till now is a little sorry.</p>
<p>i am not a bad person or someone who want to randomly hurt your business with the 0 from 0 stars but for me it was one of the worst experience I ever had with a casino.</p>
<p>you can check my account I wrote a lot of comments on casinos and most of them are good. But in that case you were extremely unprofessional with me and this was in no point fair and not acceptable.</p>
<p>money is in my bank wallet all done.</p>
<p>end of the case you payed me today without I sent you my bank card …</p>
<p>after that I gave you 0 stars and wrote that nobody should gamble in your casino and somehow after that you finally start to care about this case, magic magic …</p>

<p>you told me you want more verification documents, I sent you them, even I WAS ALREADY VERIFIED</p>
<p>then the casino guru employe asked about the case and i wrote you again (yesterday)</p>
<p>I asked you to withdraw me, nothing happens for months …</p>
<p>i got a confirmation from the support that the verification was completed</p>
<p>(I am verified in more then 30 casinos)</p>
<p>it was the most complicated verification process in my life</p>
<p>you told me I have to verify me</p>
<p>i kindly asked you to withdraw it back</p>
<p>fact you had my deposit which was untouched.</p>
<p>I will now write my final statement to this case:</p>
