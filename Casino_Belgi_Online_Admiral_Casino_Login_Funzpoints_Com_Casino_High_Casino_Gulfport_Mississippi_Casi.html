<p>Dear Angry player,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. Iâ€™m very sorry to hear about your negative experience. I checked the responsible gambling section (https://madmaxcasino.com/about-us#responsible_gambling) and I found this:</p>
<p>"9.4 If you feel that your gambling addiction is becoming a problem, we offer a voluntary self-exclusion service that allows you to close your account for one month to one year or permanently close your account. In order to use this service, the user must provide photos of documents proving ownership of the account (the list of required documents may vary at the discretion of the Security Service). Once the account successfully passes the verification procedure, access to the account will be denied until the selected period expires. The user can request unblocking before the end of the self-exclusion period, but the final decision rests with the management of the Service. The number of unblocking requests is limited to no more than 2 (two) times per month. If this limit is exceeded, the request will be rejected. The next premature unblocking request will be accepted after 30 (thirty) days from the date of rejection. When the self-exclusion period comes to an end, the user can use all the services of the Service without any restrictions."</p>
<p>Have you already provided the required documents? Please, could you forward me the email or message in which you have requested to be self-excluded from this casino?</p>
<p>Additionally, please forward any other relevant communication between you and the casino to kristina.s@casino.guru.</p>
<p>Thank you very much in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Kristina</p>
