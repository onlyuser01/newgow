<p>Hi Sebastian,</p>
<p>Thank you for submitting the required documents as requested. We greatly appreciate your cooperation in this matter.</p>
<p>These documents have since been approved.</p>
<p>However, to open your account, we ask that you submit the following documents:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A recent bank statement (PDF format) for the period over the last 30 days, clearly showing all your details, bank details, unfiltered transactions and balances, together with the same services corresponding to the service statement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If this bank account has a unique link to one of the payment methods used as a deposit/withdrawal source on our website, these documents will suffice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If this is not the case, we also require a transaction statement for one or more of the payment methods used as a deposit/withdrawal source on our website. This should also show incoming funds originating from the same account that your services are received into.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Your privacy is taken very seriously and you can be assured that we will only use the requested information for compliance purposes. Your documents will be treated with the utmost confidentiality and will be processed and stored by us in accordance with the requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation and our data protection declaration.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for your understanding. Please reply to this email or contact our customer service if you have any questions.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Maiara</p>
