<p>Lucky Leprechaun review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>As if the Irish hadn’t suffered enough, for all eternity their beautiful nation and rich, ancient culture has been co-opted by slot machines of the cheap and blandly-cheerful type. The world is determined to milk every drop of gold from the myth of the Leprechaun and their pot beneath the rainbow.</p>
<p>Lucky Leprechaun seems aggressively dedicated to offending the nation of Ireland, complete with an outrageously accented voice over.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The graphics are rather underwhelming. The Ace to Ten symbols have a Celtic knot design on them, but beyond that all effort seems to have been left at the doras. The cartoon leprechaun, the pints of Guinness, the fiddle, and the Hobbit pipe are all rather dull to look at despite the bright colours.</p>
<p>The animations are a copy-paste job from the other Microgaming efforts and the music is a tiresome piece, that annoys until it disappears into the standard win and spin noises.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Lucky Leprechaun is a five reel, three row slot with 20 win lines. So far, so typical.</p>
<p>It sports a pair of bonuses. One free spin bonus, and one more elaborate version with interesting gameplay (details below). There is no gamble feature or base game features to add variance or variety.</p>
<p>All in all, Lucky Leprechaun plays like almost any other slot out there but slightly less interestingly.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Bonus and Scatter symbol.</p>
<p>Landing a Scatter symbol anywhere on reel five triggers the Free Spin Bonus. Players are awarded five free spins with a x2 multiplier applied to all winnings.</p>
<p>During the Free Spin bonus, the red Leprechaun symbol turns green and becomes Wild. Additionally, green and yellow Clover icons can appear on any of the Ace to Ten symbols. When one of these Clover icons lands on a reel, it awards the player either an additional free spin (the green icon) or +1 to the multiplier (the yellow icon).</p>
<p>Three or more Bonus symbols anywhere on the reels trigger the Bonus game, with four spins for three symbols and an additional spin for each Bonus symbol over that amount. Each symbol above that increases the multipliers in the Bonus Game.</p>
<p>The Bonus Game consists of a trail similar to a basic game of snakes and ladders with two ladders and no snakes. The player spins a wheel to determine how many spaces along the path they move. Each square on the path has a higher multiplier than the one before it. The player is awarded their bet time the multiplier on the square they finish up on. Additional spins can be awarded by landing on a square with an emerald under it. This is randomly determined.</p>
<p>The highest multiplier from the Bonus Game is x1000.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.33%, a tiny bit over our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.20 up to a maximum of $/£/€100.00 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is medium, which makes it a moderate match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>There is little to draw a player into sticking with Lucky Leprechaun. The statistics are unencouraging – average RTP, medium volatility.</p>
<p>The gameplay is equally dull, a standard mix of five by three reels with a free spin bonus and one small splash of inspiration in its Bonus Game. After that it is all downhill.</p>
<p>The visuals are downright ugly, the tone offensive, and the soundtrack jarring, repetitive, and recycled.</p>
