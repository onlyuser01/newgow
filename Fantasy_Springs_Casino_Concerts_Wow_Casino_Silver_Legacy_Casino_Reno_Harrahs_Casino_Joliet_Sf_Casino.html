    <h1>Fantasy Springs Casino Concerts Wow Casino Silver Legacy Casino Reno Harrahs Casino Joliet Sf Casino</h1>

<p>Ok so I've been playing at Casino Limitless for way over a year and have done many many deposits and also many withdrawals without any issues until recently.. I also want to point out that I am a frequent player at Yabby, Brango, and Casino Extreme and I am verified at all the above mentioned casinos as well as Limitless. So anyways I won $50 off if free spins and met the wager requirement everything was good but then all of a sudden Instead of just paying me like normal they requested identity verify again!? I was like ok that's pretty weird because I am already verified and I only do crypto which doesn't even require verification... But anyways I send my front and back of my valid unexpired state I D. a current bank statement with matching address and a clear selfie of me holding the I.D. I wait, wait, and wait and they tell me to resend my selfie with I.D. so I do it again and wait and wait... Meanwhile staff is telling me that everything is ok and I'll be verified shortly.... Well I get another email stating they want another selfie of my holding s handwritten note with Limitless Casino today's date and my username... So I do as I'm instructed and send that... Meanwhile I'm getting very fed up with customer service who consistently closes the chat on me without answering my questions and then I realized that the same customer support agents for Yabby work at Limitless casino as well and I also found a weird payout email I had from Limitless that had Yabbys signature on it ü§î‚ÅâÔ∏è I asked if the two casinos were affiliated and was told no not at all by quite a few different agents, then after pointing out the emails and the agents working both chats at two casinos at the same time they finally admitted that they were owned by the same people and that customer support works for all of them. I asked why my verification was getting constantly denied and even pointed out that I was verified already and am also verified at the other casinos that they own and still no progress on anything. I finally got frustrated and requested the pitbosses email address so I could contact management directly and he just told me to upload the documents again and to be patient and that my account would be verified very soon.... And shortly after that my account was frozen and I an now currently unable to log into it... I wish some of this was an over exaggeration of how things have gone but unfortunately this is exactly what has happened to me the last 2 days... I just want my $50 payed out to me and after that as far as I'm concerned casino limitless can blacklist me for all I care... Because they are gonna be blacklisted by me as well.</p>
