<p>Circus will leverage Stakelogic’s broadcast capabilities and cutting-edge cameras and microphones to deliver clear and smooth experiences to players</p>
<p>The Dutch iGaming and sports betting powerhouse Circus is looking to expand its live casino offering. To that end, the operator signed a new agreement with Stakelogic Live, which will help it become the go-to platform for live dealer games.</p>
<p>Under the agreement, Stakelogic Live, a specialist in live casino, will launch a new dedicated studio for Circus, helping it keep up with the increased demand for live dealer content. As a result, Circus players will be able to sit down at virtual Circus-branded tables and play exciting games such as American Blackjack and European Roulette. Game show-styled games will also be available.</p>
<p>Circus will leverage Stakelogic’s broadcast capabilities and cutting-edge cameras and microphones to deliver clear and smooth experiences to players. In addition, the studio will employ professional dealers that will further elevate the customer experience. Each of the dealers has been trained to the same standards as those in casinos in Macau and Las Vegas.</p>
<p>Finally, Circus players, who recently got more games thanks to another agreement, will also get to experience Stakelogic Live’s innovative features. Super Stake, for example, is a fan-favorite mechanic that allows players to double their bet to increase their chance of triggering a bonus wheel or high multipliers.</p>
<p>Stakelogic Live’s highly localized products are very popular in the Netherlands. The standout company broadcasts its best-in-class content from a studio based in Eindhoven.</p>
<p>Circus Is Happy to Have Secured Live Content from Stakelogic</p>
<p>Circus’ casino operations manager, Denis Wittebrood, commented on the new agreement, highlighting that his company’s players love live casino experiences. Because of that, Circus is happy to secure additional content from a provider that is as impactful as Stakelogic. He praised the quality of Stakelogic Live’s broadcast, saying that they are second to none.</p>
<p>We are thrilled with our dedicated studio and believe it will really help Circus to stand out as the number one destination for live casino fans in the Netherlands. Denis Wittebrood, casino operations manager, Circus</p>
<p>Richard Walker, Stakelogic Live’s head of live casino, also commented on the matter, expressing his company’s delight in being chosen to provide a dedicated live studio to Circus.</p>
<p>We really have taken the live space by storm, and we have done that by creating experiences that not only meet but exceed player expectations. Circus can now offer these experiences to its players, via its own fully branded studio. Richard Walker, head of live casino, Stakelogic Live</p>
<p>A week ago, Stakelogic concluded a milestone deal with Paddy Power Betfair. This followed an agreement between Stakelogic Live and Dinotech.</p>
