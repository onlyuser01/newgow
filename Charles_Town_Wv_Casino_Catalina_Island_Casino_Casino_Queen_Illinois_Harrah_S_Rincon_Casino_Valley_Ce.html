<p>The leading iGaming technology company that delivers products, services and solutions to online gambling operators, Gaming Innovation Group (GiG), announced it completed a new agreement with a digital-facing operator. The news came Tuesday and see GiG complete its full agreement with Trans World Hotels &amp; Entertainment's (TWHE) Palasino Malta Ltd (PML). The announcement comes after the duo penned a head-of-terms agreement on January 24, 2023.</p>
<p>Per the terms of the new agreement, GiG will power Palasino.com with its front-end delivery and content management system (CMS), as well as the award-winning player account management platform (PAM). Those solutions will play a pivotal role in the expansion of TWHE within the digital realm with Palasino.com. Moreover, leveraging GiG's solutions, the company will have the option to expand within new online markets and capture unique opportunities.</p>
<p>Overall, TWHE has more than two decades of experience within the land-based gambling sector. Back in 2018, the company was acquired by Far East Consortium (FEC), a leading Hong Kong-based international development specialist. That marked an important step for TWHE's ongoing expansion. By now, the company has a solid presence in strategic European markets and thanks to Palasino.com and the solutions provided by GiG, it will also grow within the online vertical.</p>
<p>Colin Chapman Stewart, FEC's Director of Gaming, shared his excitement about the deal with GiG in a statement saying: "Partnering with GiG provides TWHE, Palasino and our shareholders with the confidence and ability to launch our online division operating out of Malta with an MGA license."</p>
<p>Last but not least, the company's Director of Gaming noted: "Bringing our brand online to new international players who can experience the same feeling in the casinos we have successfully operated for the past quarter century, is an exciting time for us all here at Palasino."</p>
<p>Marcel Elfersy, GiG's CCO, was similarly delighted about the new partnership saying: "We're really pleased to have the ink dry on this deal with Palasino, seeing a wealth of opportunity in the partnership for both businesses to expand into."</p>
<p>Finally, GiG's CCO pointed out: "We're continuing to see growth in the online gaming space across the industry, with the brand equity of experienced retail brands gelled with specialized third-party technology such as ours, positioned well to establish a strong foothold in global markets."</p>
<p>The collaboration with Palasino comes on the heels of another important achievement for GiG. Late last month, the company confirmed it secured licenses in Pennsylvania, as well as Maryland. This helped strengthen the company's presence in the US.</p>
