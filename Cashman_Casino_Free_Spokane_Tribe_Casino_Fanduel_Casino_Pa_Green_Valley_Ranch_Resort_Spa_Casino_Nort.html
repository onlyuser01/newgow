<p>Siberian Storm Review</p>
<p>Theme and Story Line</p>
<p>The Siberian tiger is a majestic beast and this game cashes in on that in a big way. The snowy backdrop and big cat symbols make for a wild and windy theme.</p>
<p>This is coupled with more generic jewelry symbols which are given thematic character by their Russian designs.</p>
<p>Will you brave the snow to claim your prize?</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The game is pleasant enough to look at. The images are exotic and well painted even if something a little simpler and cartoony might have been easier to read on a slot reel.</p>
<p>The music is a very strange choice however and does not go with the theme at all. At least it only plays during the actual spins.</p>
<p>The animations are simple but functional.</p>
<p>Siberian Storm doesn't use standard arrangement of the reels</p>
<p>Siberian Storm slot Gameplay</p>
<p>Despite the somewhat busy looking layout the central gameplay of Siberian Storm is very simple. You win for symbols on consecutive reels starting from either the leftmost or rightmost reel.</p>
<p>This coupled with the 3-4-5-4-3 arrangement on the reels, makes for 720 ways to win. This format does make for some exciting spins as there is a lot to be paying attention to.</p>

<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins in Siberian Storm slot</p>
<p>There are three special symbols in Siberian Storm. Scatter symbols play much as they do in other games. Hit three or more on any combination of reels and you receive a payout.</p>
<p>In addition to this there are separate Wild symbols. These are less useful than in most games since the fourth and fifth rows are only three symbols deep each, there are fewer options for matching the wild than in other games that eschew winlines in favour of consecutive reel payouts.</p>
<p>The third and final special symbol is the Bonus symbol represented by the eye of a tiger (cue music...). This Bonus is especially hard to trigger as you must hit a symbol on five consecutive reels.</p>
<p>Explanation of how the free spin feature works in Siberian Storm</p>
<p>If you do though, you get 8 free spins. These reels contain twice as many stacked bonus symbols increasing your chance of hit respins (up to 240 free spins total per bonus round).</p>
<p>Siberian Storm slot Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The game has a respectable RTP of 96.00%, which is more or less the average for these sorts of games.</p>
<p>You can expect medium to high variance, so you should factor that into your bet sizing which, due to the 720-ways payout structure is relatively inflexible. You bet 50 coins for each spin. As a result bet sizes are limited by the range of coin values any given site allows.</p>
<p>Complete paytable of the Siberian Storm slot</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Siberian Storm is, visually interesting with its 3-4-5-4-3 format, and its 720-ways is a small twist on a common distribution of winlines.</p>
<p>However, these minor innovation don’t add very much to a gaming experience that is otherwise very basic. The average RTP and med-high variance don’t single the game out enough to make up for this fact.</p>
<p>Overall it ends up being a disappointment.</p>
