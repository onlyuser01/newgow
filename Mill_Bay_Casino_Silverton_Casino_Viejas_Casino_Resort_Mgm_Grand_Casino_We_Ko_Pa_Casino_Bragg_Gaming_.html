<p>Bragg Gaming Group has appointed Sportradar’s former executive, Simon Dudnjik, as the new chief of human resources officer</p>
<p>NASDAQ and TSX-listed content-driven supplier of iGaming technology, Bragg Gaming Group, has announced Simon Dudnjik as the new chief human resources officer.</p>
<p>The ex-Sportradar executive will be located in Slovenia’s capital city of Ljubljana, where he will oversee people functions across the group’s offices based in Toronto, Las Vegas, London, Reno, Chennai, and Malta.</p>
<p>Dudnjik, “Honored” to Join the Team as CHRO</p>
<p>Commenting on his appointment, Dudnjik first of all acknowledged Bragg’s undisputable “reputation as a tier-one technology employer in the region” while also expressing his honor for being able to join them as the new chief HR officer.</p>
<p>He also took the opportunity to praise some of the most notable accomplishments recorded in the past year, including the freshly opened offices in Malta and Las Vegas.</p>
<p>Dudnjik further added the group was determined to keep expanding in Ljubljana along with other locations in an attempt to meet the demands of the fast-growing business.</p>
<p>“I can’t wait to get started”, said the new CHRO while also mentioning the excellent foundations that Bragg, formerly known as Oryx Gaming in Slovenia, will make use of to keep building.</p>
<p>Bragg Gaming Group boasts more than 5,000 aggregated casino games, over €17 billion ($18.6 billion) wagered in 2022, 25+ licensed, certified, or approved territories, and five proprietary Bragg Studios.</p>
<p>Bragg Hopes Dudnjik Can “Meet and Exceed” Growth Plans</p>
<p>Also commenting on the new appointment, the group’s chief executive officer, Matevž Mazij, emphasized their ongoing interest to grow by attracting “the right talent” in all of their offices and harnessing their solid company culture.</p>
<p>Mazij also spoke about the new CHRO’s “many years of experience building motivated, successful teams in the international iGaming technology sector” which are expected to assist the group with meeting and exceeding their ambitious growth plans.</p>
<p>The CEO also spoke about their success in “staying at the cutting edge of iGaming technology” due to their multi-award-winning player account management, casino content aggregation, and Fuze promotional tools while praising the production of exclusive, premium-quality games for online casinos.</p>
<p>Dudnjik has already joined Bragg’s senior leadership team effective January 1, 2024, after bidding goodbye to Sportradar where he spent the past 12 years after joining them from the position of human resources manager in October 2011.</p>
<p>Seven years later, he was appointed people partner in the engineering department at the head of 2019.</p>
<p>Next, he took on the position of head of people partnering in the spring of 2021 before stepping up to his final position with the sports data supplier as vice president of people partnering last March.</p>
<p>Last September, Bragg Gaming announced it obtained a Gibraltar business-to-business remote gambling license. Previously, in July, the group forged a global distribution alliance with 888 Holdings.</p>
