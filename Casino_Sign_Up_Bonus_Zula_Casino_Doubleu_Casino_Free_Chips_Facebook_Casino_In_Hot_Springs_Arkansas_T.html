<p>New York Jets vs. Dallas Cowboys Week 2 game is played on Sunday afternoon at AT&amp;T Stadium in the Dallas suburb of Arlington.</p>
<p>Aaron Rodgers suffered a (potentially) season-ending injury on his New York Jets debut, causing the NFL odds to move against his team. The result is that in Week 2, they’re seen as huge underdogs against the Dallas Cowboys. When the odds were released, the Jets were +3.5 underdogs, but the spread is now set to 7.5 points, and even that seems too generous.</p>

<p>New York Jets are in Dire Straits Following Rodgers’ Injury</p>
<p>The New York Jets did great in Week 1, beating the favored Buffalo Bills 22-16 after overtime. It was a Pyrrhic victory for the Jets because they lost their new quarterback Aaron Rodgers to an injury in that game. The legendary 39-year-old signal-caller injured Achilles and could potentially miss the remainder of the season.</p>

<p>Zach Wilson will take his place in Week 2, a QB who was the Jets’ starter 23 games over the last three seasons. Although he’s still young, Wilson just doesn’t seem like someone who’s going to have a great future in the NFL.</p>
<p>As if losing the starting QB wasn’t enough of a problem, the Jets fans also need to be worried about their offensive line. These guys just don’t seem very good. In fact, many believe they’re among the worst teams when it comes to protecting the quarterback.</p>
<p>Dallas Cowboys Hopeful of Another Brilliant Performance</p>
<p>In Week 1, the Dallas Cowboys destroyed the New York Giants 40-0 on the road. It was the biggest win in the history of the franchise. Their defense was nothing short of fantastic, forcing two turnovers. Plus, they held the Giants to zero points.</p>
<p>The Giants’ 40-0 shutout loss was the largest between the teams, topping the Cowboys’ 35-0 win in 1995, also in a season-opener in the Meadowlands.</p>
<p>It was also the Dallas Cowboys’ biggest shutout victory in any game, topping their 38-0 win over the Baltimore Colts in 1978.… pic.twitter.com/hK2eIYMVAk — Laugh Alchemy (@LaughAlchemy) September 11, 2023</p>
<p>When it comes to the Cowboys offense, quarterback Dak Prescott was okay with 143 yards, but he didn’t make any touchdown passes. Instead, each of the Cowboys’ three touchdowns were scored by running backs.</p>
<p>Tony Pollard was the best man on the field, scoring two TDs. The third TD was scored by KaVontae Turpin.</p>
<p>New York Jets vs. Dallas Cowboys Prediction</p>
<p>The Dallas Cowboys are going to run riot on the New York Jets in Week 2. Even with Aaron Rodgers on the field, the Cowboys would probably win. But without him, they’re going to blow out the opposition.</p>
<p>Picks: Dallas Cowboys to win and cover the spread</p>
