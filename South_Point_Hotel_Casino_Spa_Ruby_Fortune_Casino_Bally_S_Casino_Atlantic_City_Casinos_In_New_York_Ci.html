<p>Information about eZeeWallet casinos</p>
<p>eZeeWallet is an online payment method that is a division of Emerchantpay Ltd, a financial entity based in the UK. Its signature product is a digital wallet, which offers numerous benefits to customers, including those playing in eZeeWallet casinos.</p>
<p>It also helps businesses integrate eZeeWallet as a payment method through its merchant accounts. Some of these are online casinos which accept eZeeWallet for deposits. You can find the best of these sites on this page, as well as how to use eZeeWallet to deposit money in them and the bonuses offered by these casinos. You can also read some background info about the company, plus the pros and cons of using its services.</p>

<p>EZeeWallet - Emerchantpay's fintech offering</p>
<p>We can look at eZeeWallet's background in two ways. Firstly, we know it's part of Emerchantpay, a London-based provider that's been around since 2002. It was set up to cater to the growing online payment market, which only had a few limited options at the time. The company became a trusted provider, offering credit cards and an internet payment service that allowed payments in a range of sectors.</p>
<p>Secondly, we can look when eZeeWallet began life as an individual product. The emergence of Fintech companies, with London as a key hub, prompted Emerchantpay to look at new offerings. It launched eZeeWallet in May 2020 at a time when the pandemic forced people to seek new online solutions. EZeeWallet became the company's DBA (doing business as) name as it sought to put the digital wallet at the forefront of its ambitions for the new decade.</p>
<p>The new-look wallet let users deposit, withdraw and transfer money via an app, and became available in the firm's network of 189 countries. It offered both personal and business accounts and targeted the blooming online retail sector after the likes of Amazon notched up record growth figures.</p>
<p>EZeeWallet comes with the expected consumer protection for a UK financial service: it's authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and holds ISO and PCI DSS security certificates.</p>
<p>The wallet is now affiliated with over 50 payment methods, so you can add funds from most of the top banks, and is available on Google Pay and the Apple Store. Its widespread availability is further proof of public confidence in it, and it continues to be a popular online payment option.</p>
<p>Pros and cons of eZeeWallet in online casinos</p>
<p>EZeeWallet's commitment to the stringent measures of the FCA shows that it's a safe online banking option. That doesn't mean that things can't go wrong from time to time – that's what their customer support team is there for – but you can have peace of mind that their transactions are regulated and insured.</p>
<p>Another big plus in eZeeWallet's favor is that it's very easy, or 'eZee', to use. It has several YouTube videos explaining how to make payments and they consist of a few simple steps each time. You should be able to do everyday tasks, like make instant payments, in just a few seconds.</p>
<p>If you decide to open an eZeeWallet account, you'll probably also like the fact that it's mostly free. Transferring money, including depositing at an online casino, shouldn't cost you anything from eZeeWallet's side, however other parties involved may add their own charge.</p>
<p>That said, while there are 'no hidden fees' as the company say in their promo video, you do have to search for them in their terms and conditions. We checked these out and found that in Section 16, customers may have to pay fees should they overrun their balance or if their account is inactive for six months. While these are pretty standard, it's important to be aware of them and read the document thoroughly before opening an account.</p>
<p>Another potential downside of using this service is that it doesn't support every major currency. Given the number of countries it's available in, this could pose a problem for some users who might have to use an alternative currency to use the service.</p>
<p>How to use eZeeWallet in online casinos</p>
<p>If you're looking to deposit money into a casino using eZeeWallet, then you shouldn't have any problems. The process is simple, and we can sum it up in the following steps:</p>
<p>Make sure your casino account is fully activated and go to its cashier Choose 'eZeeWallet' from the list of payment methods Log in to your eZeeWallet account on the payment screen and confirm how much you want to deposit Double-check the details and confirm the transaction.</p>
<p>The funds should arrive in your account immediately but there are sometimes delays in the system. If it takes longer than a few hours, then we recommend you contact eZeeWallet or the casino in question.</p>
<p>It's also possible to make a casino withdrawal into your eZeeWallet account. Be warned, however, that this will take longer than making a deposit, and the casino might charge a fee for doing so. It's a good idea to make sure of all the details before attempting a withdrawal.</p>

<p>eZeeWallet casino bonuses</p>
<p>If you've visited an online casino before, then you've probably seen casino bonuses that are offered to players from time to time. These may include a deposit bonus, awarded after you add to your funds, or a no deposit bonus which simply requires you to register.</p>
<p>You can find bonuses offered by eZeeWallet casinos on Casino Guru. Simply go to our list of casino bonuses and select 'eZeeWallet' in the 'Payment Method' section.
