    <h1>Directions To Rivers Casino Casino Casino En Linea Plaza Hotel And Casino Main Street Station Casino</h1>

<p>Hello dear casino guru team,</p>
<p>this case is for Pinocasino.</p>
<p>there are several things that didn't go right.</p>
<p>So I deposited €2500 last night.</p>
<p>in a single deposit.</p>
<p>I'm into the thrill and wanted to put everything right on red.</p>
<p>done done. After the time expired, my bet was simply canceled and my stake was refunded.</p>
<p>I would have won</p>
<p>I immediately contacted support.</p>
<p>this was of little help. I had the feeling that he didn't even check my request properly.</p>
<p>He confirmed to me that there are no limits for my account.</p>
<p>and that I should try again.</p>
<p>pretty bitter after you actually just lost your 2500€ profit.</p>
<p>well i wanted to play</p>
<p>Then, as the support staff said, I emptied my cache and turned it on and off.</p>
<p>Then I wanted to try again...</p>
<p>But this time with video.</p>
<p>Same game.. this time I tested with €0.20. worked. Then almost 2.5k on one color and won.</p>
<p>Well I would have won if this error message hadn't come up again saying that the limit I had set myself had been exceeded....</p>
<p>I have a video proof of that.</p>
<p>i have chat logs and screenshots recordings from the terms and conditions.</p>
<p>I have not set a limit. Evidence also confirmed by the employee as a screenshot and in the chat log.</p>
<p>I then contacted support again.</p>
<p>but could not offer any help.</p>
<p>I then wanted to pay out my 2.5 k immediately, of course, which of course only works after complex verification.</p>
<p>Documents submitted, payment initiated and back to the roulette table with €150.</p>
<p>this time on the computer.</p>
<p>I made a few barks two game mot 10-15 € per field and won.</p>
<p>420 euros.</p>
<p>I then put €400 on red. Because I wanted to know if that's possible.</p>
<p>went but lost.</p>
<p>proof on video.</p>
<p>So I figured it might be my cell phone.</p>
<p>I canceled the payout and immediately bet 2.3k or so on a suit and yeah same game again.</p>
<p>The bet was canceled after the time had expired and I would have won the bet.</p>
<p>proof on video.</p>
<p>then I taught the cache again, etc... as the employee said.</p>
<p>and tried again. again 2.3 k on a color. Same game. Would have won but bet didn't count.</p>
<p>have everything on video.</p>
<p>So I would have actually won almost 7.5 k.</p>
<p>I contacted support via email. He wrote back to me very dryly that stakes over €1000 would not work.</p>
<p>awesome how misleading can a casino be?</p>
<p>pinocasino: yes!</p>
<p>nowhere is that?!</p>
<p>Extreme Lightning Roulette stands at €5000</p>
<p>I think the terms and conditions only say something about a maximum deposit of €1000 per month. Not more.</p>
<p>wRum, could I then deposit 2.5k via Sofortüberweisung and then bet it at roulette?</p>
<p>why is there no cap like with the slots with 1€.</p>
<p>so only a negative experience can arise for high rollers.</p>
<p>The fact is, I didn't do anything wrong, I deposited and went all in.</p>
<p>but have nothing now. Except eternal verification process.</p>
<p>first I should upload a pdf, then an image, then another pdf. how should I upload a pdf of something that only exists as a letter.</p>
<p>scans are not accepted.</p>
<p>I don't think that's okay.</p>
<p>then they should at least credit me with the 4K if €1000 had been the maximum bet.</p>
<p>and not just cancels my bet?</p>
<p>What can I do here?</p>
<p>there are several violations at once?!</p>
<p>Kind regards and thank you</p>
