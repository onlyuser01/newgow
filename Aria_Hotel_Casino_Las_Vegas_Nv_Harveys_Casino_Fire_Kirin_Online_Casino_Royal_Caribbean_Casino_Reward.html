<p>Wynn Las Vegas Slots Attendant Reignites Legal Battle Over Tip-Pooling</p>

<p>Sheila Little is asking a court in Clark County, Nev., to grant a class action on behalf of Wynn Las Vegas slots attendants who have been financially damaged by the casino’s policy, which involved sharing tips with supervisors.</p>
<p>The lawsuit accuses the casino of “appl[ying] a mandatory tip-pooling and tip-confiscation policy … which deprived tipped employees of lawfully earned tips in violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act.”</p>
<p>A similar complaint representing around 1,000 Wynn Resorts dealers was settled by the company in 2021 for $5.6 million after 15 years of litigation. Now, slots attendants hope to hit the jackpot, too.</p>
<p>Little’s suit is asking for damages in excess of $15K, plus compensatory damages equal to the full amount of tips unlawfully withheld from the casino’s slots attendants.</p>
<p>15-Year Feud</p>
<p>The dispute dates to 2006, when the operator’s then-chairman and CEO, Steve Wynn, adopted a policy that cut supervisors into the tip-sharing pool for 12%. Wynn Las Vegas was the only Strip casino that pooled tips.</p>
<p>The casino had opened just a year earlier. It was one of the most fashionable resorts on the Strip, and gamblers were tipping big.</p>
<p>Wynn created the “casino service team leads” position by merging floor supervisors and pit bosses into a single role. Still, the so-called team leads were often paid less than their underlings because of all the tips flying around. Wynn was concerned this would disincentivize employees to seek promotion.</p>
<p>The dealers argued the operator should have raised the supervisors’ salaries out of its own pocket.</p>
<p>Their lawsuit was bounced around from courtroom to courtroom, as Wynn argued that “casino service team leads” weren’t supervisors, and were therefore eligible to get a cut of the tips under federal labor laws.</p>
<p>Tipping Point</p>
<p>In 2018, Wynn resigned amid sexual misconduct allegations. His successor, Matt Maddox, quickly sought to address the issue.</p>
<p>Maddox raised the pay for “service team leads” by 33% and cut dealers’ hourly rates by a dollar, while allowing them to keep all of their tips.</p>
<p>The settlement the dealers’ received was far short of the $50 million they had requested, leaving them with slightly more than $4,000 each after extensive legal fees.</p>
