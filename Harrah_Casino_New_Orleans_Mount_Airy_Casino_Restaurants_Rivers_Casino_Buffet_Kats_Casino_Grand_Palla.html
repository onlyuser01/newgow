<p>Hillary Clinton Jokes About 2020 Run in Response to President Trump, Odds Say No Laughing Matter</p>

<p>Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton couldn’t resist responding to a jab by President Donald Trump on Twitter this week regarding her potentially entering the 2020 presidential race. But oddsmakers and political bettors aren’t necessarily laughing.</p>

<p>“I think that Crooked Hillary Clinton should enter the race to try and steal it away from Uber Left Elizabeth Warren,” Trump tweeted Tuesday. “Only one condition. The Crooked one must explain all of her high crimes and misdemeanors including how &amp; why she deleted 33,000 Emails AFTER getting ‘C’ Subpoena!”</p>
<p>Clinton countered, “Don’t tempt me. Do your job.”</p>
<p>The reply by the former secretary of state and 2016 Democratic presidential nominee naturally spurred a strong response. The comment has been retweeted 22,000 times and garnered 126,000 likes and 23,000 comments. It’s also led to Clinton’s line further shortening on her odds of becoming the 2020 Democratic presidential nominee.</p>
<p>2020 Odds</p>
<p>At PredictIt, Clinton’s shares of challenging Trump in the 2020 general election are trading at 10 cents. That’s up from three cents a month ago.</p>
<p>Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts) remains the frontrunner at 47 cents. Former VP Joe Biden is next at 21 cents, and Clinton is tied for third with businessman and philanthropist Andrew Yang.</p>
<p>US oddsmakers aren’t permitted to take wagers on political outcomes. But in the UK, it’s a cherished pastime. And they’re, of course, in on the 2020 outcome.</p>
<p>Perhaps it’s her name familiarity, or perhaps the Brits know something we don’t, but Ladbrokes Head of Political Betting Matthew Shaddick explains, “We’ve taken more bets on her to be the Democratic candidate than any of the other runners.”</p>
<p>Let’s not forget: Clinton isn’t actually even a runner, as she hasn’t declared her candidacy, nor expressed interest in 2020. “We’re baffled, to be honest,” Shaddick added.</p>
<p>The Ladbrokes line on Clinton winning the Democratic ticket is down from 20/1 to 14/1 over the last few weeks. Her odds are even shorter at William Hill (10/1), and Unibet has her at 8/1.</p>
<p>Her 2020 betting odds are shorter than declared candidates Pete Buttigieg (12/1), currently the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, and Yang, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, and California Senator Kamala Harris – all at 16/1.</p>
<p>Warren is the favorite at even money, and Biden at 7/2.</p>
<p>Oval Office Winner</p>
<p>Trump continues to lead the way on PredictIt to emerge victorious in November 2020. His shares of keeping residency of the White House are at 41 cents. Warren is next at 33 cents, Biden at 12 cents, and Yang six cents. Clinton is distant at four cents.</p>
<p>The UK shops also have the President as the 2020 odds-on favorite at 11/8 (implied odds of 42.11 percent). A $100 bet and a Trump victory nets $137.50. Warren follows at 9/4, and Biden at 6/1.</p>
<p>While the PredictIt market and UK bookmakers are nearly in agreement with Trump having around a 41-42 percent chance of winning, pollsters see it differently.</p>
<p>In a Trump vs. Warren matchup, the Real Clear Politics polling average has the Democrat with a 4.5-point lead. Biden in a head-to-head against the President is fairing even better, up 7.4 points.</p>
