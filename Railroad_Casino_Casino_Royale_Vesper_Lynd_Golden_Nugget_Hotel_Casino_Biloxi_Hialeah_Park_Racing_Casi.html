<p>Grand Jackpot, free spins with x2 wilds, and stacked symbol features, the sequel that was released in the spring of 2021 has gathered plenty of fans of the genre.</p>
<p>We have carefully reviewed Magic Apple for you. Here is everything you should know about it.</p>
<p>Theme, Storyline, and Graphics: Join the Fairy Tale</p>
<p>Right off the bat, players who are familiar with the theme inspired by the well-known Snow White fairy tale will notice the superiority of the graphics and visuals in Booongo’s slot compared to other titles. The game features astonishingly beautiful cartoon-like graphics. The developer took their time when designing the game, giving a lot of attention to the small details including the colorful icons with dynamic shades set against the dark blue reels. Players are carried from the dull or harsh realities of their day-to-day lives into an enchanted land.</p>
<p>The action is set in a gorgeous garden packed with flowers in blossom, where players must help Prince Charming reach his beloved Snow White and kiss her back to life. The eye-catching castle is also visible straight away, inviting players to walk in and start experiencing the exciting trials and tribulations faced by the royal family on a daily basis.</p>
<p>The 5×4 grid with 30 pay lines has been nicely decorated with additional elements that come to complement the overall serene and relaxed fantasy realm in the game. Since it is compatible with HTML5, the game can be easily accessed by mobile players on all devices.</p>
<p>Magic Apple Hold and Win: Game Symbols and Payouts</p>
<p>The castle, dwarfs, evil queen, archers, Snow White, and Prince Charming are the high-paying symbols in the game. They award various payouts depending on the icon and the number of times the icons are found on a single payline. For example, by matching five identical high-paying symbols, players can collect a maximum payout of between x336 and x480, depending on the symbols. Matching three identical high-paying symbols will award a payout between 24 and 48 coins. The previous payouts are valid when choosing the maximum bet.</p>
<p>For example, players can scoop up a win of x24, x48, or x240 the line bet when hitting three, four, or five dwarf symbols on a single payline. Three, four, or five archer symbols landing on a line trigger x24, x60, or x288 times the line bet.</p>
<p>Landing three Prince Charming symbols triggers a max payout of x24 while matching four such symbols brings players an x96 win. To get an x384 bet line win, players must match at least five such symbols. The evil queen symbol triggers x24, x72, and x336 the line bet for matching three, four, or five identical symbols.</p>
<p>Landing three Snow White or wild symbols rewards players with x36 the bet line. Landing four or five Snow White symbols brings players x120 or x480 the bet per line. The scatter symbol, which is represented by the castle icon, can pay up to x6000 for the line bet.</p>
<p>The game also includes the standard generic card icons J, Q, K, and A. These are the low-paying symbols and they trigger different levels of payouts, depending on the symbol that players manage to match on a single payline. For instance, matching a minimum of five of the low-paying symbols will bring players a maximum payout of up to 96 coins. Landing a minimum of three symbols on a payline will generate a maximum payout of up to 12 coins.</p>
<p>The Wild can randomly show up on the reels to replace all non-special symbols in the game. The special Scatter also makes an appearance, triggering wins that are paid based on the pay lines. The Bonus Symbol is only seen paying out while the Bonus Round is engaged.</p>
<p>Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The game features serene music that perfectly suits the fairytale-like theme chosen for the slot. The soundtrack does a good job of keeping players engaged and entertained as they keep exploring the enchanted garden and the castle, revealing new features and scooping up their wins.</p>

<p>Magic Apple Hold and Win: Free Spins, Bonus Game &amp; Jackpots</p>

<p>Free Spins</p>
<p>To engage the Free Spins round and receive eight spins, players need to match a minimum of three scatter symbols at the same time. Additional free spins are available to players who can land three-symbol winning combos of the same scatter symbols while engaged in the Free Spins round. During the same feature, the Wild inscription on the substituting symbol is seen vanishing as it is being replaced by an x2 inscription. This leads to the wild feature doubling the payout on each winning line.</p>
<p>Bonus Game</p>
<p>To enter the Bonus Game and automatically receive three respins, players need to land a minimum of six apple bonus symbols. Players who land an apple bonus symbol while engaged in the Bonus Game reset the respins to three.</p>
<p>The apple symbols are the only symbols present while the respins are happening. They work by turning into sticky symbols and eventually filling all reel positions, which will signal the end of the game. The Bonus Game also comes to an end when the respins reach the zero value on the counter.</p>
<p>Jackpots: Mini, Minor, Major &amp; Grand</p>
<p>When the Bonus Game ends, players can keep an eye on the reels for the mini, minor, and major bonus symbols. When this occurs, players are rewarded with matching jackpots. When all 20 bonus symbols are seen on the grid simultaneously, players receive the grand x2000 jackpot.</p>
