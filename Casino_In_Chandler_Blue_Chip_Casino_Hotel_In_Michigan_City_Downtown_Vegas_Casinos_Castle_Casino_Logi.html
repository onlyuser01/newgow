    <h1>Casino In Chandler Blue Chip Casino Hotel In Michigan City Downtown Vegas Casinos Castle Casino Logi</h1>

<p>Huge COMPLAINT -</p>
<p>You have until tomorrow 12pm GMT to act on this or I will instruct our family Lawyers who will be sending a winding up order!</p>
<p>I have spoken to Barry in he is a Manager in the support department!</p>
<p>You’re the team that do the verification!! - If that’s not the case and Barry was lying and you’re not the compliance Manager ?! That’s a big issue!</p>
<p>Don’t fob we off place to place!</p>
<p>MIKE IN VIP - VERY rude - said Hitch1914 was originally closed due to a duplicate account then it’s not gambling reason!</p>
<p>I needed help and you did not help at all.</p>
<p>I now may not be able to pay my bills and this is due to my slight addiction to gambling. You have not helped me to gamble responsibly at all. I feel that my stake casino has neglected their duty of care to me.</p>
<p>Also under your self exclusion part you state : You</p>
<p>shall contact our customer support</p>
<p>I don’t see the problem with my account my old account that was closed due to me not needing an account want Hitch1405!</p>
<p>Now 2/3 years later .. my other account I couldn’t login to as it’s closed as I requested!</p>
<p>You LET ME deposit over £500 into my account with saying NOTHING!</p>
<p>Then you don’t verify my account as it’s a second account but it’s not YOU CLOSED THE FIRST ONE!</p>
<p>YOU won’t even give me back my £500 deposit after failing to see that!</p>
<p>Also I have £544.76 + £10 Accumulator on!</p>
<p>I have NOT tried to pull the wool over your eyes I have not tried to miss lead you in anyway! Or committed anything ILLEGAL!</p>
<p>But you’re holding my money I have deposited - / and the money I have in the account!</p>
<p>You either do one or the other</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Open my account Hitch1914</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pay me £544.76</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Refund me £500+ I have deposited!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ITS ILLEGAL OF YOU NOT TO PAY ME OUT ON EITHER</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If neither happens I will take legal action against your organisation and it will start with a winding up order unless it’s paid you will</p>
<p>I am not being unreasonable - if you have let me put £500 deposit in and not done any checking to a "vulnerable customer as you say" hence why you have closed it for that reason …. If your TERMS you</p>
