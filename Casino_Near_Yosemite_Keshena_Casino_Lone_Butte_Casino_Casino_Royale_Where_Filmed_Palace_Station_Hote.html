    <h1>Casino Near Yosemite Keshena Casino Lone Butte Casino Casino Royale Where Filmed Palace Station Hote</h1>

<p>I paid real money. ` I can't remember the amount I won and the amount that was left of my real money but it totalled 143.00 which isnt a lot.</p>
<p>Since trying to withdraw, I have been asked for various documents (bank statement, confirm address, email , post code, user name, dob) but they still can't find me. I have sent a screen print showing my user name, i ahve sent bank statement in pdf form as asked, i have given on numerous occassions my dob, email address, bank detaisl showing payment i deposited to royal, coming out of my account and being paid to them and yet they say they cannot find my account. Also no less than 7 people have emailed me asking for the above or saying they can't find me and no one seems to acknowledge what i have sent even when i have named them and resent back their emails. i have gone through their chat page on my account and followed up my emails and they send me back an email saying they can't find me. one email said the money woudl come back to my account but it hasnt. i am a new customer and this is my treatment when i try to make the first withdrawal. yet even while i am waiting for my money i still made two more deposits and played, believing it would be sorted. I lost the money gambling but even if i had won i dont believe they woudl let me take it. i still have not had it and still getting emails saying they can't find me. I do not understand how you give them the rating that you do.</p>
