<p>The company has reinvented the classic Cleopatra under the advanced and proprietary Slingo mechanic</p>
<p>Gaming Realms has been rapidly expanding its Slingo portfolio, looking to secure new prominent licensing agreements and partnerships. The latest such partnership is established with IGT which has allowed for its iconic, classic and player-favorite Egyptian-themed game to be cast in the Slingo image.</p>
<p>Reinventing IGT’s Classic in Slingo’s Image</p>
<p>The high-performing original game will find a new lease on life and will benefit from the popularity of the Slingo mechanic with players. Players are able to climb through a prize ladder that holds incrementally increasing rewards.</p>
<p>Slingo Cleopatra also comes with a new accumulation mechanic which will come with more free spins as players climb up the ladder. This will help players with triggering the Bonus Spins as well as accessing better payouts, the company details in a press release.</p>
<p>Gaming Realms has also deployed wild features and symbols to help drive player interaction and reward players as they progress through the game. Free spin symbols also award free spins as you continue to progress upward on the prize ladder.</p>
<p>The bonus round is inspired by the original Cleopatra title and it’s played out on a 5×3-grid setup as opposed to the base game which is a 5×5-grid setup. Players will also get to enjoy familiar symbols as they play through, including the Eye of Horus, Pharaohs, and Scarabs, among others with 20 paylines to examine and enjoy.</p>
<p>Gaming Realms product director Hans Winkelmann welcomed the opportunity to bring and incorporate the Slingo mechanic into IGT’s timeless classic game. Winkelmann further had this to add:</p>
<p>The proven gameplay, much-loved Egyptian theme, and the elements of player interaction blend together to create a title that will appeal to both new and existing fans of IGT’s Cleopatra series. We are thrilled to see the impact this game has on players across the globe. Gaming Realms product director Hans Winkelmann</p>
<p>Gaming Realms has been significantly scaling up the popularity of its Slingo mechanic and products. The company entered into an ambitious licensing agreement with TAITO Corporation, which allows the supplier of iGaming products to now develop a SPACE INVADERS branded Slingo title which is being added to its portfolio, and accessible to partner operators.</p>
