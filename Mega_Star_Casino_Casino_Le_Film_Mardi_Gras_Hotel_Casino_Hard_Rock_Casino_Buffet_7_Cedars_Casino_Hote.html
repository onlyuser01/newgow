<p>Nuvei Corporation, a Canadian financial technology specialist, unveiled an extension of its existing partnership with the Dutch iGaming operator Holland Casino. Under the agreement between the two parties, Nuvei will power Holland Casino’s online offerings with instant payouts.</p>
<p>Nuvei to Power Holland Casino with Instant Payouts</p>
<p>The secret of Nuvei’s instant payouts is the SEPA Instant Credit Transfer that it would integrate into the operator’s cashier. As a result, players in the Netherlands are now able to access the money from their iGaming accounts right away when a payout request is made. Thanks to this, gamblers can get their winnings right away, instead of waiting hours or days for payout requests to be settled. Needless to say, the SEPA Instant transfers are a great addition that will tremendously improve the quality of life of Holland Casino players.</p>
<p>Nuvei and Holland Casino first joined forces this year when the fintech firm was named as the iGaming operator’s principal payments provider. The tech supplier played an important role in the launch of Holland Casino as the first live platform in the newly-launched Dutch iGaming partner.</p>
<p>Nuvei is a fintech company that specializes in speedy transactions. It is currently helping many companies all over the world accelerate their businesses through modular, flexible and scalable tech solutions. As a result, Nuvei partners can diversify the payment options they accept and provide customers with fast payout options. In addition, Nuvei has a selection of management tools companies can use to avoid financial fraud.</p>
<p>The company’s critically-acclaimed solutions are used by customers in over 200 jurisdictions, attesting to the quality of Nuvei’s technology.</p>
<p>Holland Casino Is Thrilled about the Deal</p>
<p>Yuval Ziv, Nuvei’s president, spoke about the extended agreement with Holland Casino. Ziv said that it is very important to give iGaming enthusiasts instant access to their funds once they request a payout. As the online gambling sector becomes more and more competitive, quick payouts are a must. Ziv pointed out that Holland Casino’s decision to pick Nuvei as its partner is a testament to the quality of Nuvei’s solutions.</p>
<p>Nicolas Fleiderman, Holland Casino Online’s manager, also shared his thoughts. He noted that his team is looking forward to launching SEPA Instant Credit Transfer, a solution he believes would be a significant upgrade for the operator’s players.</p>
<p>We have always been determined to offer Dutch players the best iGaming experience in the market, including superior deposit and payout experiences, which is why we chose to partner with Nuvei to launch our iGaming platform. Nicolas Fleiderman, manager, Holland Casino Online</p>
<p>Fleiderman concluded that the ability to offer SEPA instant payouts through the same single integration with the payments specialist will provide reinforcement to Holland Casino’s cashier proposition.</p>
<p>Speaking of Holland Casino, the company just teamed up with Playtech and a team of academics to research responsible gambling tools.</p>
