<p>The popular Ojos Locos restaurant chain – with 22 locations in Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas – is opening its first Nevada location, along with what its owners claim will be the first Latino-focused casino and hotel in the US.</p>

<p>The Ojos Locos Sports Cantina y Casino at Hotel Jefe will debut in North Las Vegas by the end of the year.</p>
<p>Ojos Locos, whose Spanish name means “crazy eyes,” is partnering with Las Vegas-based Fifth Street Gaming, which offered up its Lucky Club Hotel-Casino for the transformation. A renaming ceremony and groundbreaking for the renovation will be held Tuesday morning.</p>
<p>“We are gratified to join together on this endeavor with Ojos Locos, a vibrant and growing brand which has, over the last 12 years, established itself as a national leader in providing authentic hospitality experiences to the Latino community,” said Fifth Street CEO Seth Schorr in a statement.</p>
<p>Big Addition</p>
<p>When the rebrand is complete, the Ojos Locos Sports Cantina y Casino at Hotel Jefe will offer 10,000 square feet of gaming space, 10,000 square feet of indoor/outdoor entertainment space, and the largest Ojos Locos restaurant in the US, seating up to 300 guests.</p>
<p>Fifth Street Gaming operates a portfolio of casinos, gaming taverns, restaurants, and bar concepts. That includes the Downtown Grand in Las Vegas and the Silver Nugget Casino in North Las Vegas.</p>
<p>The new Ojos Locos hotel will remain open during the renovations, though its casino and restaurant will be closed.</p>

<p>Ojos Locos became a popular chain for celebrating Latino culture. Servers greet diners in Spanish, and Spanish-language broadcasts of soccer matches play on TVs. The hotel-casino will continue this tradition, offering Spanish entertainment, including concerts, Mexican rodeos, and food festivals.</p>
<p>A recent study by the Society for Human Resource Management and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute found that Hispanics represent the second-fastest growing and second-largest ethnic group in the US. By 2060, according to the study, Latino people will represent almost 29% of the US population.</p>
<p>“I think that Latino community is one that is deserving of an experience that is designed specifically for them in every way,” Schorr told the Las Vegas Review-Journal. “The language is the most obvious. But food, entertainment, all of our programs are completely programmed for the Latino community.”</p>
