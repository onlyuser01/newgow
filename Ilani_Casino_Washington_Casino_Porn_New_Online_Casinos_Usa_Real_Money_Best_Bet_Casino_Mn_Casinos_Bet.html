<p>BetQL Audio Network will debut shows on Entercom-owned radio stations following the acquisition of QL Gaming Group in November 2020.</p>
<p>Entercom Launches BetQL Audio Network with Focus on Sports Betting</p>
<p>Entercom has announced BetQL Audio Network, a dedicated place for sports with a particular emphasis on sports betting. BetQL Audio Network debuts as part of a recent acquisition of QL Gaming Group, a sports data and iGaming affiliate business.</p>
<p>Moving forward, Entercom will air programming produced by BetQL Audio Network across its portfolio of sports stations, with an estimated 30 million listeners tuning in every month. To ensure the quality of production, the network will rely on two specific daily shows – “You Better You Bet” hosted by Nick Kostos and Ken Barkley and “BetQL Daily” hosted by Joe Ostrowski and Ross Tucker.</p>
<p>For the time being, the programming will also feature “BetQL Countdown to Kickoff” which will be changed or evolve to another format later on. The shows have seen a fair bit of success with You Better You Bet receiving 670,000 downloads monthly.</p>
<p>Bringing Data-Backed Betting Options to Sports Fans</p>
<p>Commenting on the latest reorganization of business, Entercom president of sports Mike Dee said that the acquisition of QL Gaming Group in 2020 was part of the company’s strategy to refocus on the sports gambling landscape by providing data-backed sports betting content to listeners. He had this to add:</p>
<p>“By combining the BetQL brand and our deep collection of expert talent, this new network compliments our industry-leading local sports broadcast portfolio and will further enhance our position as a leader for sports betting programming.” -Entercom president of sports Mike Dee</p>
<p>Radio programming is not too common when it comes to sports betting, but Entercom is committed to bringing a quality product in a niche that enjoys a strong and dedicated audience.</p>
<p>Entercom is the leading sports radio ownership group with 39 sports stations covering all sports in the United States and beyond.</p>
<p>It has numerous partnerships and collaborations with college teams and professional sports franchises, including but not limited to the Dallas Cowboys and Kansas City Chiefs, Golden State Warriors and Chicago Bulls, and others. Entercom also signed FanDuel as an official sports betting partner in October 2020.</p>
