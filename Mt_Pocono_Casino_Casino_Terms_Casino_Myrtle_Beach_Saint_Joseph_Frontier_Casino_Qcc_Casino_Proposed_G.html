<p>The ban, outlined in the Gambling Regulation Bill, 2022, could potentially impact broadcasts of English Premiership Soccer and race meetings such as Cheltenham and Aintree</p>
<p>A proposed ban on gambling advertising in Ireland has raised concerns about live sports broadcasts, including soccer and horseracing. Following its initial rejection in January, the Department of Justice in Ireland in April expressed its willingness to support the advancement of the Gambling Regulation Bill as part of its 2023 Justice Plan. The bill includes a range of measures aimed at safeguarding gamblers and preventing excessive spending.</p>
<p>Proposed Ban Seeks to Shield Children from Gambling Advertising Across Media Platforms</p>
<p>The proposed ban, if passed, would prohibit gambling advertising on TV, radio, and audio-visual media services from 5.30 am to 9.00 pm. The aim of the legislation is to protect children from the pervasive influence of gambling advertising across various media platforms.</p>
<p>Bookmakers have expressed their concerns to Minister for Justice Helen McEntee and Minister of State James Browne. They warn that the provision in the bill could lead to the interruption of live sports broadcasts where betting ads are visible. Betting companies’ promotions and bookmakers’ logos are frequently seen in stadiums and on players’ shirts during sports events.</p>
<p>The Irish Bookmakers Association (IBA) has specifically highlighted the potential impact on English Premiership Soccer games, which have a significant following in the Republic of Ireland. However, industry figures suggest that other events like Cheltenham and Aintree could also be affected due to the visibility of bookmakers’ ads to viewers.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Labour Party in Ireland is advocating for a complete ban on gambling advertisements, citing concerns about gambling harm and the association of sports with wagering. Senator Mark Wall argues that the government’s proposed restrictions on advertising between 5:30 am and 9 pm are insufficient, as gambling addiction is not limited to specific hours.</p>
<p>Horseracing Broadcasters Express Concerns Over Proposed Ban</p>
<p>Sky Sports Racing and Racing TV, pay-television broadcasters dedicated to horseracing, have expressed concerns about the proposed ban. They are considering the viability of their operations in Ireland if the bill is enacted in its current form. Both broadcasters have called for an exemption for channels dedicated to horseracing, arguing that their subscription-based platforms already implement safeguarding measures for their customers.</p>
<p>Racecourse Media Group (RMG), the parent company of Racing TV, which recently secured exclusive media rights to broadcast from all 26 Irish tracks until 2029, has warned that the service may no longer be viable in Ireland if the ban is implemented.</p>
<p>Martin Stevenson, RMG’s chief executive, emphasized that television coverage is crucial for any sport, and the loss of dedicated racing channels in Ireland could have a detrimental impact on the industry. The Gambling Regulation Bill has passed the committee stage and will proceed to the report stage, where proposed amendments will be considered. It will then progress through the final stages in both houses of Parliament before being enacted into law. The bill aims to modernize gambling legislation to protect vulnerable individuals.</p>
