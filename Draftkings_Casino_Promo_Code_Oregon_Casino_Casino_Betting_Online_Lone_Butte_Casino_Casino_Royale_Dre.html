<p>The trend of sponsorship deals between Italian Serie A soccer clubs and non-gambling partners continues as ACF Fiorentina teamed with PlanetPay365, a payment platform owned by Austrian-based sports betting company SKS365.</p>
<p>Bolster Brand’s Visibility</p>
<p>The agreement between ACF Fiorentina and PlanetPay365, valid throughout the 2021/22 season, made the payment service provider the official value-added partner of the soccer club and would see the brand increase its visibility at the Artemio Franchi stadium, home of La Viola, where it would feature on the perimeter boards.</p>
<p>Speaking about the agreement, ACF Fiorentina general manager Joe Barone outlined the club’s content to partner with a company that “offers customers a variety of services with high technological standards in just one solution” with a focus on innovation.</p>
<p>“We are very pleased to welcome PlanetPay365 to the Viola family and we are sure that this partnership will bring great benefits to both companies.” Joe Barone, General Manager, ACF Fiorentina</p>
<p>The PlanetPay365 brand will also feature in interview backdrops and on the giant screens at the stadium during all home matches of the team in Serie A and Coppa Italia, while digital integrations will take place via Fiorentina’s social media, marketing, and lead generation campaigns.</p>
<p>SKS365 chief commercial officer Troy Cox was equally excited to continue the partnership with the team from the region of Tuscany that has a “long history, important values and [is] strongly linked to the territory.”</p>
<p>“Tuscany is a key region for our business objectives and this renewed synergy will allow us to enhance our project and make it more competitive not only on a regional level but also on a national level.” Troy Cox, CCO, SKS365</p>
<p>As an official value-added service partner of La Viola, PlanetPay365 will become part of the club’s “InViola” network to receive the opportunity to offer its multifunctional solution to over 500 commercially affiliated to the club activities.</p>
<p>PlanetPay365 is the latest brand to partner with ACF Fiorentina, following in the footsteps of Olybet, a sports betting platform operating in the Baltics, which teamed with the soccer club in October to become its official regional betting partner and boost its brand visibility across the stadium.</p>
<p>ACF Fiorentina is the second Serie A club that entered a sponsorship agreement with SKS365’s brand after a deal with AS Roma last month named PlanetPay365 the club’s official partner for the 2021/22 season.</p>
<p>Other Serie A clubs which signed bookmaker sponsorship deals were AC Milan and Inter Milan which teamed with Premier Bet and HappyBet respectively, to name the sports betting operator’s official regional partners.</p>
