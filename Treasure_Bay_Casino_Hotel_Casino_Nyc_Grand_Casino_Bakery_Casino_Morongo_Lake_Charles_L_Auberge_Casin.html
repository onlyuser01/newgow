<p>iGaming content provider BGaming has reinforced its presence in the Latin American region thanks to a new agreement with Betara, a Peru-based casino and sportsbook company. Under the deal, the supplier will provide the operator with its portfolio of games.</p>
<p>Thanks to the arrangement, Betara players will be able to try out BGaming’s library of over 100 games. Boasting engaging mechanics and AI-generated features, the provider’s content is sure to appeal to Peruvian customers.</p>
<p>The deal will help BGaming expand its LATAM footprint, allowing it to further tap into this lucrative and diverse market. The deal with Betara in Peru follows earlier LATAM-oriented deals that have seen the supplier ally itself with a number of local powerhouses.</p>
<p>The latest deal with Betara reaffirms the growing popularity of BGaming’s slot games, cementing it as a leader in the provision of content in the region.</p>
<p>Betara Is Excited to Offer BGaming’s Titles to Its Customers</p>
<p>Betara’s head of marketing, Daniel Vargas, commented on the new partnership agreement. He said that his team is happy to welcome BGaming and add its iGaming content to the Betara platform.</p>
<p>Vargas praised BGaming as an innovator and a supplier of attractive products that will help Betara set itself apart from its competitors. The head hopes that the new content will help Betara cement itself as a leader in the Peruvian market.</p>
<p>The studio is also known for its exclusive brands created in collaboration with the main operators in the sector where Betara will have a special participation to launch exclusive games and branded with its own brand. At Betara we are absolutely sure that our players will be very happy with this partnership. Daniel Vargas, head of marketing Betara</p>
<p>Meanwhile, BGaming’s chief commercial officer, Olga Levshina, said that her team will be doubling down on its efforts to establish a reputation for delivering outstanding content, seamless integration and a smooth start-up to companies in Latin America. She added that BGaming is very optimistic about the partnership with Betara.</p>
<p>We look forward to a successful ongoing partnership with Betara and providing our ever-expanding portfolio to its players. Olga Levshina, CCO, BGaming</p>
<p>Last month, BGaming’s games were integrated into Casimba Gaming’s aggregation solution, further growing the supplier’s presence. In the meantime, BGaming continues to roll out new slot games, such as the recently released Wild Cash Dice and the action-packed Savage Buffalo Spirit Megaways.</p>
