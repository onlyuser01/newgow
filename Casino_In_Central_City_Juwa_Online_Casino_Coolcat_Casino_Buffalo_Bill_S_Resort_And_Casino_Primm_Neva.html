<p>Dear Radka</p>
<p>I'm complaining and I don't think it's okay that you can't withdraw money during a cool-off period and also can't verify yourself during it. This contradicts the actual purpose of the frozen account (player protection) because you have access to the money for at least 4 days and can lose the money, which happened. I honestly don't understand the difference between the situation you originally had in mind and the situation that actually happened.</p>
<p>Of course, a casino MUST not offer player protection, but if they already offer a "freeze account", they should implement it rigorously. For example, there is no obligation for a casino to offer a welcome bonus, but if a casino offers a 100% welcome bonus, it should not end up being 50%. the casino offers "freeze account / cool-off period" and in essence it is not a cool-off period or self-exclusion at all. this is misleading and not fair.</p>
<p>i intentionally didn't file a complaint at first, just wanted to share on the discussion forum that willscasino is offering a cool-off period, but this period is not what a player can in good faith expect. if you make a withdrawal and then self-exclude and there is something wrong with the withdrawal you will need to wait until the self-exclusion is over, log in and withdraw again or upload the document. the player is not protected from gambling their money, although the casino offers a cool-off period. I just wanted that said.</p>
<p>The original question was whether a casino should allow withdrawals during a cool-off period. you asked simon and he said it should be possible. The fact that I no longer have any credit is a consequence of this, because that's exactly what you couldn't do.</p>
