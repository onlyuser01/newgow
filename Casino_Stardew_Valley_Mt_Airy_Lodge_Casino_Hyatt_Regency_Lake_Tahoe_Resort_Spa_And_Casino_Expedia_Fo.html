<p>Spinomenal has expanded its presence in the Bulgarian iGaming market with the acclaimed supplier securing another important local partner, namely 8888.bg, whose local presence will allow the company to strengthen its own position in the market and make sure its games reach a bigger audience.</p>
<p>The integration with 8888.bg is carried out through 7777 gaming, a dedicated platform provider that facilitates similar processes and ensures that the end-consumer gets a rewarding experience without having to worry about the backend.</p>
<p>8888.bg will now have access to a number of various games and options, including Times of Egypt, Queen of Ice, and Majestic King, all of which are acclaimed Spinomenal titles and player favorites in other markets.</p>
<p>In welcoming the news, Spinomenal CEO Lior Shvartz said that his company was excited to be teaming up with 8888 and helping the operator expand its footprint in the region while also strengthening the supplier’s own reach. The partnership also covers Win2.ro, 8888’s B2C brand in Romania.</p>
<p>"Our world-class games will have a positive impact for 8888.bg as well as for Win2.ro in Romania," Lichev noted.</p>
<p>The news was similarly welcomed by 8888 CMO Alexander Lichev who said that he was very happy to see Spinomenal secure further positions in the regulated market in Bulgaria and was a welcome addition to the operator’s own library of games.</p>
<p>"Having access to their content means more entertainment options for our end-users. We believe in the great success of our partnership and look forward to amazing results that are ahead of us," Lichev said. Spinomenal has been building its footprint across Europe at a good pace recently.</p>
<p>The company launched with Optibet in Lithuania, and it further teamed up with Vegas.hu, an LVC Diamond Kft brand in Hungary. The expansion in Bulgaria with 8888 marks the company’s long-term strategy to build a serious footprint in Europe.</p>
