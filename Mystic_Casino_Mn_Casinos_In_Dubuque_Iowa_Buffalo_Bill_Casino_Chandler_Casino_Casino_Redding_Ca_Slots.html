<p>Thank you for your reply, Kirkpatrick. I checked the bonus T&amp;Cs and I found this:</p>
<p>"1.WHILE A BONUS IS ACTIVE, THE MAXIMUM BET ALLOWED IS $10 (or equivalent if using another currency) PER SPIN or WAGER. This applies to all Slots Capital games. In the interests of fair gaming, there are limits on the maximum bet sizes you can place during the playthrough of any bonus ($10 being the maximum unless SPECIFICALLY stated otherwise). The following terms &amp; Conditions apply to all of bonuses offered at Slots Capital casino. A bonus is completed when the winnings are requested to be paid out from the bonus, or the balance decreases to be $0 and the bonus is removed by the system."</p>
<p>Our position is closely explained in Fair Gambling Codex https://casino.guru/fair-gambling-codex-for-casinos#max-bets: The max bet rule is, in fact, an industry standard, just as the fact that a casino has the right to seize the player's winnings from bonus play after breaking this rule. We prefer not to go against industry standards by penalizing casinos that use the maximum bet rule against players from time to time.</p>
<p>However, if you feel like you have been accused mistakenly, feel free to forward me your game history together with any relevant communication between you and the casino. My email address is kristina.s@casino.guru.</p>
