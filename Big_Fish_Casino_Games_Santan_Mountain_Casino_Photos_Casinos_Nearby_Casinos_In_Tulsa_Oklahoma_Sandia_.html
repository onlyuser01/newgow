<p>Wynn encouraged its employees to vaccinate against COVID-19 and submit proof by April 25. Employees, unable to vaccinate or choose not to, are asked to submit negative tests weekly at their own expense.</p>
<p>Wynn Employees Asked to Vaccinate or Submit COVID Tests</p>
<p>Employees at Wynn in Las Vegas who have received a vaccine must submit proof of vaccination by April 25. This was announced in a memo sent yesterday from Marilyn Spiegel, president of Wynn Las Vegas and Encore, to all employees. Employees who want to receive a vaccine were directed to the UMC Vaccination Center onsite at Encore before April 25.</p>
<p>On the other hand, employees that choose not to, or are unable to be vaccinated, will have to show proof of a negative COVID-19 test weekly. According to the memo, those employees must complete the COVID-19 tests at their own expense and time.</p>
<p>Spiegel revealed that employees that are not vaccinated can also test within the site at the Lighthouse Lab Testing facility located in the Petrus Convention Room at Wynn. With that in mind, the cost per test is $15, which makes a total of $60 for the month.</p>
<p>Business Marks an Uptick, Wynn President Remains Optimistic</p>
<p>In the released memo, Spiegel acknowledged that the increased business volumes in March allowed the company to increase hours and shifts. Consequently, this led to more employees returning to work. However, she stressed that to “get to the next level of business” more restrictions need to be lifted so that more customers can visit the casino, bars, convention center, and restaurants.</p>
<p>Spiegel added that lifting of the restrictions will come from the Nevada Gaming Commission and the Control Board. However, before that happens, she stressed that resorts “must ensure that all employees who can safely receive the COVID-19 vaccine to be vaccinated”.</p>
<p>Despite the difficulties in 2020, Spiegel said that she feels optimistic about the future. Furthermore, she added that her goal has always been to offer the safest vacation and work environment. Last but not least, Spiegel mentioned that she feels that the “very best times may be ahead”.</p>
