    <h1>Captain Jack Casino Login Wildhorse Casino In Pendleton Oregon Free Non Expired Chips For Doubledown</h1>

<p>Parimatch, an international betting brand, has teamed up with a fourth Premier League club, Newcastle United. The club is now part of the other partnerships that the company established for the top-flight soccer league in the United Kingdom, including Aston Villa, Leicester City, and Chelsea.</p>
<p>Parimatch Tech deputy CEO Evgen Belousov welcomed the new partnership and spoke highly of the opportunity that the company is being given. He said:</p>
<p>Each partnership within the Premier League, one of the strongest and most popular football leagues in the world, boosts our expansion into global sports and gives a powerful reason for pride. Parimatch Tech deputy CEO Evgen Belousov</p>
<p>Belousov said that the partnerships negotiated between Parimatch and the clubs in the Premier League were built on mutual values and aspirations. The company was honored to be able to start the season with so many trusted names on its side, he added. Statements were issued by other participants in these partnerships, including by Chelsea FC president of business Tom Glick who said that the team was excited to be working with Parimatch during the season once again.</p>
<p>The partnership would help both entities to build up their engagement with fans and reach new audiences. Aston Villa CCO Nicola Ibbetson said that the renewed partnership for the 2022/2023 season was great value for the team and its fans. “Parimatch is one of the fastest growing online sports betting brands and we are pleased to welcome it to our growing family of commercial partners,” Ibbetson said.</p>
<p>Newcastle head of commercial Dale Aitchison added that the team was pleased to be entering this partnership and further explore the opportunities that it presents. Aitchison assured that Newcastle and Parimatch shared common values. Leicester City FC commercial director Dan Barnett was also excited to start the season with the club and Parimatch. It’s an exciting period for all parties who are keen to explore the partnership and take it a step further.</p>
<p>Betting Partnerships to Remain as Part of Premier League for Now</p>
<p>Parimatch’s entry into the Premier League comes at a time when concerns about the appropriateness of such partnerships have increased. Sports betting companies may at one point in the foreseeable future be ordered to cut ties with sports clubs and vice versa. However, the time has not come yet, and after much toing and froing earlier this year, it seems that such partnerships are here to stay, at least for now.</p>
