    <h1>Casino Hotels Council Bluffs Funrize Casino Seminole Casino Hollywood Rsweeps Online Casino Wetumpka</h1>

<p>Hello Tomas,</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply!</p>
<p>Unfortunately looking to your reply you did not investigate the casino’s policy at all as they do have a Responsible Gaming Policy. https://spacewincasino.com/info/responsible_gaming</p>
<p>I do believe that my complaint is justified and worth the investigation at Casino Guru simply as the casino failed on its own policy/rules. I fully agree that there is no unified regulation regarding responsible gaming, and you have to deal with the offers depending on the casino. However, it is one thing that a casino has no protection tools and another if a casino has but does not use them when players need it to avoid payouts..</p>
<p>And according to your reply(correct me if I understand it wrong) if a player request a self-exclusion and this is gets overlooked or not set properly he/she also cannot use the complaint procedure on this casino as you would not be able to refund/restore the players balances/deposits, yet there are several complaints here (solved and unsolved) about an overlooked self-exclusion request where players required help from your team to resolve the matter.</p>
<p>Do note that I made the request twice for a wager limit and on both I have evidence that this message was received by the casino. And between my second Wager Limit request and the time I started actually playing again (which took several hours before I lost all my balance) we passed 18 hours which is more than enough time for the casino to set this Limit or reply asking for more info or stating that they cannot honour such request as their Support is 24/7 available.</p>
<p>The request I made to the casino was:</p>
<p>Furtheron I also hereby request a wager limit of €50 per day effective immediately to prevent harm to myself!</p>
<p>Mentioning this normally indicates that the player needs help or the casino needs to look into this better to see what assistance they can provide.</p>
<p>After losing all my funds and speaking with Live Support, she confirmed the receival of my request but according to her maybe her colleague did not notice it which is actually a shame. Given their reply on my case it would not surprise me if that maybe was maybe on purpose..</p>
<p>What I do expect from Casino Guru actually is to look into the case as this casino simply violated its own terms and protection tools which should lead to investigation (and maybe a restore of balance or black points if the casino does not respond at all) by maybe overlooking my request.</p>
<p>The fact that the casino offered me a partial refund of my deposits does imply that they are aware of their mistakes as in their final decision/reply they did not mention a word about my complaint or case, all they came up with was a weak excuse about security checks and ‘negative’ feedback from another casino without any supporting evidence. Support also confirmed that if I agree on the refund, I have to drop all my claims against the casino which again imply that they know they are wrong and needs to get rid of me.</p>
<p>During the first week after sending my complaint I was still able to play and deposit on their casino without any restrictions which proof that the casino does not want to set any to gain more profit. The day before I got the 'Final' Decision they blocked my casino account fully which I guess did so I can not gather any evidence against them I think.</p>
<p>That’s why I turned to Casino Guru as it would be easier to use your mediate solution which could resolve my matter and if that fails warn other players to stay far away from this casino as they are unfair and rogue.</p>
<p>With all the above I wonder what the Casino Guru team will say about this complaint on trying to resolve it or not..</p>
