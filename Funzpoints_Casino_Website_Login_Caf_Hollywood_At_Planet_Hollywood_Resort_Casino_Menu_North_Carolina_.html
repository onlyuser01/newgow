They defeated the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, thus improving their record to 5-3.</p>

<p>Odds Moving Against the Buffalo Bills</p>
<p>When the markets opened, the Buffalo Bills were two-point favorites, but things have changed since. In fact, it’s just the opposite now. They’re now seen as underdogs in Sunday’s game, which is probably because the Bengals did great last weekend.</p>
<p>The Bills also won over the weekend, but they weren’t as impressive. They defeated the Bucs 24-18 at home. Knowing how good they are on their turf, it’s actually a surprise that they didn’t destroy the boys from Tampa.</p>
<p>They’re great at home, but they haven’t been great on the road. In fact, each of the three losses they’ve suffered so far in the 2023 NFL season happened away from Highmark Stadium.</p>
<p>Confidence Is Sky-High in the Cincinnati Bengals Locker Room</p>
<p>The Bengals are riding a three-game win streak, with their most recent game being against the Niners on the road. The hosts were seen as five-point favorites before the game, but the Bengals ended up beating them 31-17.</p>
<p>Quarterback Joe Burrow was sensational that day, going 28-for-32 for 283 yards and three touchdowns. It was arguably his most impressive performance of the season, but we think there’s more to come from the NFL’s highest-paid player.</p>
<p>Apart from doing great offensively, the Bengals also impressed in the defense. They were able to keep the Niners to just 17 points. It was the third game in a row that the Bengals defense kept the opponents to 20 or fewer points.</p>
<p>Buffalo Bills vs. Cincinnati Bengals Prediction</p>
<p>After the fantastic performance against the 49ers last weekend, the Bengals now look capable of defeating practically any opponent, including the Bills. Plus, the Week 9 game is taking place in Cincinnati, which is where the Bengals are great. Not only that, but the Bills aren’t great on the road this season. It might not be an easy game for the Bengals, but they should be able to grab another win.</p>
<p>Pick: Cincinnati Bengals to win</p>
