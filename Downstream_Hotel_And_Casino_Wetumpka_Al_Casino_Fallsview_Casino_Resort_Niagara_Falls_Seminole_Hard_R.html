<p>The Big Easy review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Judging by the name of the game, indicative of the New Orleans-based movie dealing with corrupt officers, gangs and love, players are bound to expect many symbols of this city’s southern way of life.</p>
<p>Placing an emphasis on the theme of New Orleans’ key features – music, food and drinks – it aims to immerse players into the setting for full enjoyment.</p>
<p>The relaxed, easy-going attitude towards life that is characteristic of New Orleans is perfectly depicted in The Big Easy slot, as there is no plot twist storyline that would require players to concentrate too intently.</p>
<p>Here, all they have to do is set the tone and lay back with the glass of bourbon on the rocks spinning on the reels for one sweet payout after another.</p>
<p>Single payline win - winnings are nicely visible</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The graphic design of The Big Easy slot game is a great example of Spielo’s ability to render the game with the best visual appeal. Namely, the 2-D reel elements, the reel backdrop set against the typical New Orleans landscape of typically southern streets and buildings, as well as the accompanying features – sound and animation effects, all contribute to the player’s general impression.</p>
<p>The former is a balance between smooth background jazz and sax spins, with numerous symbols to back the importance of music in this lifestyle, if it isn’t already evident from the range of music-inspired symbols on the reels.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>The Big Easy is a 5-reel slot game with 20 paylines that can be activated according to player’s choice in groups of 1, 5, 10, 15 and 20.</p>
<p>A single bet ultimately amounting to €100 is the most a player can bet per spin. In this regard, taking into account the many various symbols on the reels, with a different payout potential and other player-benefiting features, the gameplay is bound to appeal to a wider player profile range.</p>
<p>Namely, music is a constant inspiration in this slot, with many medium and high value symbols representing anything from instruments, through posters to actual stage performers – the poster, the sax, the piano keys, the trumpet performer and the lady singer are all representative of this theme.</p>
<p>As for food and drink, a plateful of seafood pays rather well, with 100x your single line stake should you land 5 on a paylineand the bourbon on the rocks symbol which pays only half of that.</p>
<p>Gameplay video with Free spins feature</p>
<p>The symbols representing the streets of New Orleans inevitably include the famous Bourbon St. which pays 150x your single line stake, while the performers are left to the higher classes. Namely, the slot allows players a glimpse into their stage appearances featuring a trumpet player and a lady singer symbol.</p>
<p>While these regular symbols do contribute to the gameplay, most of the payouts are inevitably attributed to the wins landed by the Wild and the Scatter.</p>
<p>Bonus features</p>
<p>Despite the relatively rewarding nature of the regular symbols on The Big Easy’s reel grid, there are two which trigger special features for even higher payouts. Namely, The Big Easy logo symbol is the Wild on the reels, with its main function being to replace all other symbols except the Scatter when landing in a winning combination.</p>
<p>Special symbols of the game</p>
<p>As for the Scatter – the Moon symbol, it’s crucial to mention its rewarding potential, as 3 scatters result in a 4x bet multiplier, 4 scatters – 11x and 5 scatters – 20x the totalbet.</p>
<p>What is interesting about The Big Easy logo symbol is that it doubles as the bonus symbol, with a minimum of three logos on the reels triggering the Free Spins Bonus feature.</p>
<p>It is rather interesting, as players get to pick between Jazz clubs and thus determine the number of free spins they are awarded, while the following, instrument pick will determine the multiplier they get for the free spins wins.</p>
<p>A different range of clubs and instruments, i.e. number of spins and multipliers is available for combinations of 3, 4 and 5 The Big Easy logos:</p>
<p>3 logo symbols – Free Spins: 8, 10 or 15 &amp; Multiplier: 2x – 4x;</p>
<p>4 logo symbols – Free Spins: 16, 18 or 20 &amp; Multiplier: 5x, 6x or 10x;</p>
<p>5 logo symbols – Free Spins: 22, 24 or 25 &amp; Multiplier: 7x, 8x or 10x.</p>
<p>How free spins multipliers work</p>
<p>Bet size and payouts</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the slot’s reels feature lower and higher paying symbols, with the bourbon and the poster symbol offering the lowest payout of 50x a single line bet amount for 5 landing on an active payline, followed by the previously mentioned seafood and Bourbon St. symbols.</p>
<p>A payout of 175x bet per line is available for landing 5 of the street symbol; the same case scenario would see the sax symbol pay 200x bet per line, the piano keys – 250x, the trumpet player – 500x, and both the lady singer and The Big Easy logo symbols paying 1000x should all five land on an active payline.</p>
<p>Players can bet from 0.01 to 5.00 per single line, i.e. bet sizes per spin range from €0.01 (single active payline) to €100 (max 20 active paylines).</p>
<p>Top symbols paytable</p>
<p>RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The slot’s RTP is calculated at 95.01%, a bit lower than the industry average. In terms of variance, the slot is categorized as medium to high variance, allowing players to make smaller bets and still hit bigger wins.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>All in all, the city’s air, culture and way of life have definitely proven to be a suitable choice of theme when it comes to The Big Easy online slot title. Further emphasized by the individual symbols providing attractive payouts, this Spielo release definitely deserves its popularity ranks at online casino game selections.</p>
