<p>Jack Entertainment has launched betJACK, a new free-to-play app for sports bettors in Ohio getting ready for the grand opening of the market in 2023. The app will allow sports aficionados to familiarize themselves with the sports betting universe prior to the official launch of the regulated market.</p>
<p>Sports Betting in Ohio to Launch by January 2023</p>
<p>The much-anticipated amended House Bill 29 legalizing sports betting in the Buckeye State passed through both legislative chambers last December and was officially sealed by Governor Mike DeWine’s signature. At the moment, the real money sports betting market in the state is now solely pending a regulatory framework that will establish the way casinos, sports teams, and racinos will obtain their licenses for mobile sports betting. Each of these categories of operators will be granted a single license, with the chance to get a second one provided they can prove their contribution can grow Ohio’s economy. The same legislation will also convert lottery kiosks and allow limited sports betting activities at bars, restaurants, and grocery stores. College sports betting is also going to be covered by the legislation once Ohio will open the market.</p>
<p>How Will the New betJACK App Help Ohio Bettors and Sports Fans?</p>
<p>While the Ohio Casino Control Commission still has until January 2023 to work out all the details of the legal framework, local casino operator Jack Entertainment partnered with Kambi Group, a sportsbook platform provider, and Shape Games, an award-winning iGaming provider and digital business-to-business platform. Their common goal is to launch a useful product that would help Ohio bettors and sports fans get ready for what’s coming to the Buckeye State in the upcoming months.</p>
<p>The new sports betting app that was born from the collaboration between the three parties will allow sports fans to safely learn about sports betting and practice their new skills in a safe, risk-free, free-play environment. The betJACK all will look and feel just like a genuine sportsbook app for real money and it will be accessible both in the online form on the website, as well as via an app for mobile devices.</p>
<p>What will Shape Games bring to the table? The company is an expert in consumer technology and it is expected to drive considerable consumer loyalty and engagement for betJACK, while retaining clients and throwing the focus on customer acquisition. Shape Games is also responsible for designing the front-end for Betsson’s launch in Colorado and it is now ready to apply its already proven approach to Ohio’s sports betting market.</p>
<p>Kambi’s senior vice president of sales Sarah Robertson described the sportsbook platform as a flexible one that is ready to adapt to the constantly evolving regulations of the market while meeting the needs of all partners. She also expressed her thrill for the company to be once again collaborating with Shape Games as Ohio is gradually transitioning to real money betting on sports. She added that Kambi is “excited to leverage this experience” by priming consumers and the overall market for the upcoming real money offerings.</p>
<p>Jack Entertainment’s president Brian Eby expressed the company’s delight to offer “a fun and engaging platform” that would help sports aficionados familiarize themselves with all the aspects of the sports betting universe and become more confident in their abilities. While Ohioans still have a relatively long time to wait until the big market launch day, the new app should keep them busy and safely entertained.</p>
