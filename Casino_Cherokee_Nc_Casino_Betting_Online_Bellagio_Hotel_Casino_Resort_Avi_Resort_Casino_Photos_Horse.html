    <h1>Casino Cherokee Nc Casino Betting Online Bellagio Hotel Casino Resort Avi Resort Casino Photos Horse</h1>

<p>I cannot withdraw my balance. Normally, I would withdraw and deposit money via Astropay. Yesterday, I won a prize of 600,000, of which I decided to withdraw 500,000 and play with the remaining 100,000.</p>
<p>My withdrawal request remained "pending", which I thought was normal due to the large amount.. I continued to play with my remaining 100,000, making normal withdrawals via Astropay instantly..</p>
<p>Today I wake up and check if my withdrawal was processed successfully, only to discover that it was rejected and the 500,000 appeared again in my balance to play... I tried to withdraw it again and the Astropay option no longer appears, even though my account is validated (which for an Argentine, having it validated should provide a bank transfer withdrawal option, which doesn't appear). I contacted the agents and they told me Astropay is updating, but I don't believe that as it's available for deposits.</p>
<p>Honestly, I don't know how to use the other withdrawal options</p>
<p>And I need to withdraw that money</p>
