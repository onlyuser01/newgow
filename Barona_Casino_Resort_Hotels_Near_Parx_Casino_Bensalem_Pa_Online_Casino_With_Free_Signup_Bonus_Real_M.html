    <h1>Barona Casino Resort Hotels Near Parx Casino Bensalem Pa Online Casino With Free Signup Bonus Real M</h1>

<p>Dear Heiko004,</p>
<p>Thank you for contacting us. I have checked the casino’s website for options to close an account and unsubscribe from all correspondence with the casino and its services, and this is what I found (here):</p>
<p>"2. Taking a break</p>
<p>If you feel like not playing on our platform might be more beneficial for you, then our company provides you with the two alternatives to choose from:</p>
<p>a. Cooling off period</p>
<p>You can set this period immediately, with minimum cooling off period being 7 days. During this period, you will not be able to deposit money into your account. Additionally, you will not receive any promotional offers for such period, meaning at least for 7 days.</p>
<p>b. Self-exclusion period</p>
<p>Self-exclusion is a period of Timeout, meaning you take a short break from the gaming platform at least for 24 hours. The timeout might include a longer period, for instance 48hours/7days/30days, and more, depending on your choice. Once you set your time, you will not be able to cancel the process of blockage of your account. In order to prevent unpleasant consequences, please request a withdrawal before you decide to self-exclude. This means, that if you do not request your money before the start of the period, the company will no longer be able to help you with your request.</p>
<p>For activation of Cooling off/Self-exclusion period, Player need apply to the online-chat of website https://time2spin.com/ for confirmation of such period by Time2Spin."</p>
<hr />
<p>When applying for the self-exclusion, state clearly the reason why you want your account to be deactivated and specify the time period. Also, email "Subject" should be clearly marked and easily recognizable as casino support receives many requests per day hence, if it’s visibly marked you stand a better chance to have your request granted as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>Email subject: Self-exclusion</p>
<p>Player’s info:</p>
<p>First name:</p>
<p>Last name:</p>
<p>DOB:</p>
<p>Casino login:</p>
<p>Email address:</p>
<p>"Greetings Time2Spin Casino,</p>
<p>I’m writing to inform you that I wish to exclude immediately from this casino and from receiving any gambling-related marketing material for a minimum period of xxx months/years (lifetime).</p>
<p>The reason that preceded my decision is xxx</p>
<p>I acknowledge that I will not be allowed to rescind my self-exclusion during this period and self-exclusion cannot be lifted before the end of the agreed period."</p>
<hr />
<p>Please send another email to support@time2spin.com (you can CC me petronela.k@casino.guru in the copy) and keep me informed about any further developments. Thank you in advance.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
