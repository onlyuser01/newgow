    <h1>The D Casino Club Player Casino No Deposit Bonus Casino Winnings Tax Casino Arizona North 92Nd Stree</h1>

<p>AffPapa has announced a brand new partnership with Craze Affiliates, a company that is one of the fastest-growing official affiliate programs focused on innovation and transparency. Craze Affiliates has committed to establishing its offer as one of the leaders in the iGaming and interactive wagering industry, and it makes a worthwhile addition to AffPapa’s list of trusted partners as a result.</p>
<p>Craze Affiliates is a company committed to working closely with its partners and currently offers a 45% commission on successful conversions for each new player for its CrazePlay program. The commission is calculated on the player’s total income, the company informs in an official press release. Craze Affiliates also strives to elevate the way affiliates do business with their partners as it has adopted a "No Negative Carryover" policy.</p>
<p>This means that each month, the commissions will be calculated from a clean slate without having to worry about previous results. CrazePlay is a particularly apt solution, owing to its geographical reach and the fact it already operates in 50 regions, along with a variety of payment methods already available.</p>
<p>Craze Affiliates manager of affiliate programs Rimante Nemanyte, who was hired in April, had this to add when asked about this partnership opportunity:</p>
<p>"The Craze Affiliates [sic] team is delighted to start a partnership with the industry revolutionaries – AffPapa! Professionalism, collaboration, and positivity are what AffPapa’s team has provided us so far, assuring trustworthiness and reliability towards our affiliate program. We are very excited to start the collaboration and reach great results together!"</p>
<p>Craze Affiliates offers excellent opportunities to partners interested in the iGaming sector. There are numerous games available across Craze Affiliates’ partners already by suppliers the likes of NetEnt, Pragmatic Play, Play’n Go, and many others.</p>
<p>As to Yeva Avagyan, AffPapa’s head of commercial, she was equally pleased with the addition of Craze Affiliates as a reliable and dependable problem. In a statement to the media, Craze Affiliates assured that there were "no hidden terms" and the affiliate program was fully focused on transparency as its key operational tenet.</p>
