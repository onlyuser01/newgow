<p>Reflex Gaming and Yggdrasil have teamed up to bring around a revamped take on the classic slot experience with Sidewinder DoubleMax. The game, developed by Reflex Gaming, gets a bit of the Yggdrasil treatment, with the company introducing its Game Engagement Mechanic (GEM) DoubleMax to ensure that players have the best possible time.</p>
<p>The action unfolds across a five-reel and 20-payline grid with a maximum win that is set at 5,000x. In welcoming the new opportunity and collaboration, Reflex Gaming Chief Product Officer Mat Ingram said that the company’s collection of titles continues to grow at a good pace and the addition of Sidewinder DoubleMax is another step in that direction.</p>
<p>Yggdrasil Chief Gaming Officer Mark McGinley has been similarly upbeat about the partnership and its significance. He paid particular attention to the opportunity to benefit from the YG Masters program which allows for quick delivery and farther reach of the Sidewinder DoubleMax game.</p>
<p>"Combining classic slot gameplay with modern features by way of our unbeatable GEMs, we’re able to consistently deliver cutting-edge content," McGinley effused. The game itself features Wild and Super Wild positions in the special Sidewinder feature which is designed to elevate your winning potential and lead to even more fun times exploring the slot.</p>
<p>There is a Bonus Buy feature that can further enhance the experience and offers you the chance to buy directly into the bonus by simply paying an amount equal to 50x. Thanks to GATI, Yggdrasil’s underpinning tech, the game can be developed quickly with operators in a regulation-ready and standardized manner that cuts down on friction and ensures rapid deployment across the board.</p>
<p>The game offers a max win of €500,000 and has a range of bet values from €0.20 to €100. Sidewinder DoubleMax is a high volatility slot with 95.5% in return to player rate, and the game allows you to take a sort of an ante bet, the Golden Bet feature, which will increase your chance of triggering the coveted Sidewinder bonus by 25%.</p>
<p>Yggdrasil has been on a tear of late, making sure that it too keeps pushing out new games and experiences. One of the most recent releases by the company is Arctic Catch, released together with the YG Masters partner Bang Bang Games. The supplier also recently secured further ground in the Dutch iGaming market with Circus.nl.</p>
