    <h1>Seminole Hard Rock Hotel Casino Hollywood Address Casino Philadelphia Seneca Hotel And Casino In Nia</h1>

<p>The casino has decided to split the payout of my winnings into installments. My initial withdraw was 2000e and the later one is 1500. According to their terms, they can split the payment in installments when winnings are above 5000e. I have not gone beyond this. Not in a month and not since I opened my account.</p>
<p>On top of this, I have not been told about the decision without contacting customer service, I have not been given indication as to when the payments are done fully nor have I been told which term they are referring with the decision. Based on their user agreement, I do lt understand the situation.</p>
<p>My account is fully verified, KYC took 4 days even though I uploaded all necessary documentation before they even asked. Now my first payment was marked as procossed on 6th December, customer service said that it was paid on 7th (1000â‚¬) but I haven'tvreceived anything yet. I understand it might take one or 2 more days, that is fine.</p>
<p>Upon asking, I have yet to receive a written plan on the payment, nor have I received a message stating they have paid partially -&gt; according to their terms, they send a message when payment is made.</p>
