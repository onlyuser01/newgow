<p>25-year-old London Playboy Club casino bunny Victoria Jack lost her job as a croupier there after she broke the cardinal rule of table hopping and fraternized with a wealthy (and she says, unknown to her) married customer.</p>
<p>It’s an iron-clad rule at the club, and dealers must agree to abide by it when they work at the exclusive gaming venue.</p>
<p>According to several British tabloids, Jack caught the eye of what she described as one of England’s wealthiest businessmen, whom she refused to identify. After the two met, she says he pursued her relentlessly, even tracking down her home address.</p>
<p>He lavished gifts and attention on Jack, but that soon turned to requests for sex on the instant messenger service WhatsApp.</p>
<p>With Jack maintaining she was unaware he was married, the two began an affair and spent time at four-star hotels, according to the former casino worker. She claims that for her birthday, the mystery tycoon gave her £1,000 ($1,350) as a present.</p>
<p>Caught on Surveillance</p>
<p>Ironically, it was at a rival casino where the duo’s relationship was discovered. Someone spotted the two at the Colony Casino and informed the Playboy Club management, who confronted the employee.</p>
<p>She initially denied the affair at the request of the millionaire, but Playboy requested closed circuit video from the other casino and identified her. She told the British tabloid The Sun that her paramour said he could protect her.</p>
<p>“He said he had spoken to them and they wouldn’t hand any pictures over,” she said. “But they did. My reputation has been tarnished.”</p>
<p>She was immediately fired for “gross misconduct” for breaching the Playboy Club’s strict policy of no intermingling with clients.</p>
<p>Bad Day Gets Worse</p>
<p>Shortly after she was canned by her employer, the man responsible for her termination dumped her, reportedly telling her “to find someone her own age.”</p>
<p>“I am heartbroken, I’ve been through so much,” she told The Sun. “It was hard losing my job, but even harder losing him.”</p>
<p>She denied knowing he was married, and said had he told her, she would have never agreed to be with him.</p>
<p>“Perhaps he has done this before, I don’t know,” she told the newspaper.</p>
<p>Oh, perhaps.</p>
