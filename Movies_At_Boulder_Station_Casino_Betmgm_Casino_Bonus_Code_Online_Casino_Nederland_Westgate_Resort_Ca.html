<p>The New York Giants got their first win of the season last weekend, but the big question is can they do it again? Oddsmakers doubt it. Instead, betting odds suggest we’re going to see an easy win for the Dallas Cowboys.</p>
<p>Not only are they on a winning streak of three straight games, but this game is played on their turf. That said, it seems that the real question ahead of the Giants vs Cowboys clash on Sunday is whether the home team will be able to cover the seven-point spread?</p>

<p>Dallas Looks Unstoppable at the Moment</p>
<p>The Cowboys lost the season opener to the Super Bowl champions, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, at Raymond James Stadium in Florida. However, they lost by just two points. That didn’t ruin their confidence, as the Cowboys then went on to win the following three games. The teams they beat are the Chargers, Eagles, and Panthers.</p>
<p>The win over the Panthers happened in Week 4, with a final score of 36-28 for Dallas. They put an end to Carolina’s flawless record and are ready to keep on impressing.</p>
<p>What’s great about the Cowboys in 2021 is that they look strong in all aspects of the game. With Dak Prescott back as their starting quarterback, their offense looks capable of scoring a couple of touchdowns against almost any opponent in the NFL.</p>
<p>Their defense has also been superb, with Trevon Diggs standing out as their best player. The cornerback is the NFL’s leader when it comes to interceptions, with five recorded in the past four games. He and his teammates should have no problems stopping the Giants’ offense, even though we’ve seen this team improving their game lately.</p>
<p>The Giants Hoping for a Miracle</p>
<p>The Giants did unthinkable in Week 4 – they beat the favored New Orleans Saints at the Caesars Superdome.</p>
<p>Still, there’s a caveat. Their win came in overtime after the score was tied 21-21 in regulation. That was their first win of the season, but they shouldn’t get their hopes up. Their players just aren’t elite, so we probably aren’t going to see them recording too many wins this season.</p>
<p>They did beat Dallas the last time they met. However, it was in Week 17 of the 2020 season, when everything was pretty much over for both teams.</p>
<p>This time, however, the Cowboys will be fired up. That said, anything but a Dallas win would be a huge surprise.</p>
<p>But, can the Giants give them a run for their money? Probably not. Instead, we expect a dominant win for the home team, which should be able to cover the spread.</p>
<p>Pick: Dallas Cowboys to win and cover the spread; the over should hit.</p>
