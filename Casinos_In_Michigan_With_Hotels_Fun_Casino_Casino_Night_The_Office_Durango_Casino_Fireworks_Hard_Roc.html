    <h1>Casinos In Michigan With Hotels Fun Casino Casino Night The Office Durango Casino Fireworks Hard Roc</h1>

<p>Inspired Entertainment, Inc. has recently announced that it has entered into a partnership agreement with VEEPIO, the mobile technology arm of the NFL Alumni (NFLA) which is the oldest and most renowned official organization for former players, team staff members, and coaches of the NFL American football league. This agreement will see the name, brand, image, persona, and likenesses of the members of NFLA be commercially used all over the world in virtual football games.</p>
<p>With over 15 years in the industry, Inspired has pioneered Virtual Sports which is a recreation of the NFL action that hundreds of thousands of players enjoy. As per the terms of the new agreement, the gaming provider will have exclusive rights to utilize a number of key aspects of the NFLA for its Virtual Sports products. Among the things that the company intends to do is to use its award-winning visual effects as well as the latest motion capture technology to bring back the NFLA greats through its ‘Legends of Football’ game. This is set to deliver a truly outstanding gaming experience to players which is pretty hefty claim considering the competitive nature of the market – there are other amazing Virtual Football channels from companies like bet365.</p>
<p>Bringing Back the Greats</p>
<p>Some of the NFL legends that will make their return through Inspired’s “Legends of Football” will include NFL Hall of Famers like Franco Harris. The star poker player has expressed his excitement about the virtual product and the prospects of connecting with fans that may have not seen him and other players during their football career.</p>
<p>“I’m especially proud of the benefit that will be derived by the NFL Alumni retired players as they transition into their lives after football,” Harris said.</p>
<p>Another NFL figure who is very excited about the new partnership is Phil Villipiano, who is the All Pro and 2019 Gridiron Greats Hall of Fame inductee from the Oakland Raiders. Like Franco, he says he cannot wait to see the outcomes of the games. Moreover, he further expressed his appreciation to the fact that the virtual games’ proceeds will be quite beneficial to his fellow NFL Alumni – it will help them in funding such things as healthcare services among other things.</p>
<p>All in all, the partnership will be a big boost for the NFLA whose primary goal is to serve, assist and inform members in their post-NFL lives. In addition to the medical services and assistance, the members are also assisted with business and legal services that are meant to keep them healthy, productive, and connected with each other. The NFLA even raises over a $1 million every year for local non-profit causes.</p>
