<p>Trainwreck, the famous gambling streamer and Twitch star, announced he secured a big-time win on the 2022 World Cup matches.</p>
<p>World Cup Bet Brings Trainwreck $1.5M</p>
<p>Although generally, the 31-year-old is famous for streaming slots, he has a talent for sports betting as well. Trainwreck is renowned for his high stakes in slots, but this time, he placed $25,000 in BTC on four matches from the World Cup that recently kicked off. And this bet paid off big time, as the famous streamer correctly guessed four matches, a move no one anticipated. As usual, the high risk pays off big time, which in this particular case brought Trainwreck a hefty $1.5 million payout.</p>
<p>Overall, the streamer had to guess four matches to win the staggering $1.5 million with its $25,000 bet. It was highly unlikely for Saudi Arabia to win against Argentina, yet this was the first successful bet for Trainwreck after Saudi Arabia’s 2-1 victory against Argentina.</p>
<p>Then, the match between Tunisia and Denmark was highly unlikely to result in a draw, yet, this was the second outcome Trainwreck guessed correctly. Similarly, the famous streamer guessed the draw for the third match, Mexico versus Poland, marking the third correct outcome. Although Trainwreck had the option to cash out earlier for a lower prize, he didn’t. The fourth and final match he had to guess was France versus Australia. The match ended with a 4-1 victory for France, which marked the final correct outcome Trainwreck guessed. As a result, the famous streamer collected a total of $1,574,660.32.</p>
<p>The Streamer Faces Criticism Online</p>
<p>Upon announcing his recent win from the World Cup, Trainwreck faced some criticism as one online user urged him to “show the losses, not the wins.” Responding online, the famous streamer said that 99.9 of his streaming shows losses. Moreover, Trainwreck added that he is always transparent about his gambling activities and especially with losses. Additionally, the famous streamer urged his audiences not to gamble, saying that “all gambling is losing, especially sports betting.”</p>
<p>“99.9% of my streaming life shows losses, if you’re d<strong><em>*</em>s is only looking or seeing the .1% then that’s you being a d</strong>b f**k, i’m very transparent about gambling and the reality of its losses,“ wrote Trainwreck</p>
<p>Back in October, Trainwreck dropped a bombshell saying he made $360 million from gambling streams. At the time, he claimed he made some $360 million in the last 16 months alone after inking a streaming deal with Stake, the famous crypto gambling website.</p>
