<p>New York mayoral candidate, Andrew Yang, pitched the idea about the creation of a casino on Governors Island. Over a radio discussion for the Breakfast Club, Mr. Yang shared that such a venue may be an engine of recovery for New York City, attracting more tourists and generating revenue for the city.</p>
<p>Casino on Governors Island May Attract More Tourists</p>
<p>One of the ways for New York City to recover may be the creation of a casino on Governors Island, according to the mayoral candidate Andrew Yang. In a radio interview for the Breakfast Club, he revealed the bold plan, outlining that if a casino is established on the island, the city may harness this and such venue “would be one of the engines of recovery”. “That casino would generate so much money it would be bananas,” said Mr. Yang.</p>
<p>Furthermore, he revealed that the proposed location would be in an “environment right now that is essentially unused“. According to Mr. Yang, the benefits which such venue may bring to the city include more tourists as well as millions of dollars in tax revenue. Although the mayoral candidate’s proposal sounds promising, can it really be done?</p>
<p>Speaking with Politico, Alicia Glen, chair of the Governors Island Trust’s board said that the establishment of a casino venue on the island is prohibited by the deed. Furthermore, she stressed that “there is no scenario under which a casino” may be a part of the current plans for the future of Governors Island.</p>
<p>Another point that Ms. Glen raised is that the current plans for the island involve the creation of a “mixed-use campus” which will serve an educational, hospitality, and commercial purpose themed around climate change and sustainability.</p>
<p>The Island Is Currently Home for Multiple Businesses</p>
<p>Formerly used as a Coast Guard and military facility, Governors Island can only be accessed by ferry. For the moment, the 172-acre island is home to multiple dining outlets, several businesses, a couple of yacht clubs, a brewery, a National Monument, and multiple recreational areas. It was back in 2003 when the first guided public tours of the island started. Since then, hundreds of thousands of people visit Governors Island every year.</p>
<p>Last year in September, Mayor Bill de Blasio together with the Trust for Governors Island revealed that a Center for Climate solutions is going to be developed. As part of the Mayor’s recovery plan, the new center would be gathering educators, researchers, and innovators with an ultimate goal to test, implement and create solutions that can be used in the next decades.</p>
