<p>The arrest comes after the alleged crime boss has been on the run since 2018</p>
<p>The Italian mafia is infamous around the whole world. Rival mafia families controlling different territories have started feuds with each other and even in some cases with local authorities and this has been an issue for the country for more than 200 years. Despite the fierce control and complex structure of those illegal organizations, Italian police have been relentless and this process is unlikely to stop anytime soon.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Matteo Messina Denaro, one of Italy’s most-wanted mafia bosses from the notorious Cosa Nostra crime syndicate, was arrested. The man was captured by police authorities in Sicily in mid-January after being on the run for 30 years. Denaro was convicted of multiple murders, kidnappings and other crimes. It is believed that he was also involved in money laundering, drug trafficking and other illegal activities.</p>
<p>While Denaro was on the run for quite a long time, he was eventually caught. Similarly, another mob leader was caught by police authorities Thursday. Pasquale Bonavota, from the infamous ‘Ndrangheta crime family, known for its affiliation to illegal gambling and drug trade around the world, was arrested by police authorities.</p>
<p>The Mafia Boss Was Arrested in a Church</p>
<p>Carabinieri, Italy’s national gendarmerie, uncovered that Bonavota was hiding in the northern city of Genoa. Local news outlets reported that the alleged mafia boss tried to trick the police by giving them fake ID. However, the Carabinieri were not convinced and ultimately arrested him.</p>
<p>What’s interesting is where the police caught the crime boss. Out of all the places he could hide, Bonavota picked a church. Not unexpectedly, the alleged mafia boss did not seek forgiveness but was rather hiding from the authorities. In addition to capturing him, the Carabinieri arrested his brother Nicola, who was also on their radar.</p>
<p>The infamous ‘Ndrangheta crime syndicate reportedly operates in more than 40 different countries around the world. The criminal organization is involved in many illicit activities, from theft and drugs to money laundering and illegal gambling, among other crimes.</p>
<p>Allegations against Bonavota claim he murdered two people. This first murder dates back to 2004 when he reportedly took the life of another ‘Ndrangheta member. The second one ties Bonavota to the murder of a leader of another criminal syndicate from 2014. Although he was sentenced for the murders at a later point the sentence was invalidated. Still, Bonavota remained on the police radar for other crimes.</p>
