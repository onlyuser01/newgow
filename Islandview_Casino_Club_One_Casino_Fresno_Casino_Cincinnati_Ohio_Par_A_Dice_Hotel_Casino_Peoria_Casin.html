    <h1>Islandview Casino Club One Casino Fresno Casino Cincinnati Ohio Par A Dice Hotel Casino Peoria Casin</h1>

<p>I have made an acc on platform over 7 months ago, dormant not used anymore as I couldn't verify my identity as the bank acc I used was my dads old one, and i didnt have utility bills to my name etc. So when I tried cashing out once it didnt let me, and i didnt use it again.</p>
<p>In between i have a new job and made a bank acc in my own name, so I made another acc on playamo not knowing that I breached their T&amp;C's of having duplicate accounts. I recently won 1.8k and tried cashing out and was redflagged for having 2 accs. They have asked me to explain to them why etc. which I did.. I have nothing to hide and it was an honest mistake as I didnt gain anything from the second acc, I just thought It would help me to verify my ID etc for cashouts.</p>
<p>I have appealed with them not to delete my account and accept my apology as I was not aware I had breached any kind of agreement. I know im in the wrong, I just know that im honest and didnt intend on cheating or scamming, so I feel like them deleting my account and seizing my funds is very harsh. I told them I am more than happy for them to delete my old account as I used it literally 2 times. They asked me to take a selfie with my ID which I did and upload it.</p>
<p>I have taken every avenue to prove my identity necessary and have provided them with every bit of information required. I need help in solving this problem.</p>
<p>What are the odds of them letting me keep the account and the funds I won?</p>
<p>Is there any kind of appeal system?</p>
<p>How do I prove it wasn't intentional and I didnt benefit in any way shape or form from the mistake I made.</p>
<p>I have invested a lot of money into this account and feel cheated that no one informed of this situation on my first deposit, rather months down the track when I tried to cash something out.</p>
<p>Looking forward to your help,</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
