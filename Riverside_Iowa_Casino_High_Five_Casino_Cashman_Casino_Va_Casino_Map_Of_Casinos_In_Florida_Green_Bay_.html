<p>The Green Bay Packers vs. New York Giants is one of the two Monday Night Football games of Week 14</p>
<p>The Green Bay Packers beat the reigning NFL champions, the Kansas City Chiefs, last weekend, which has given them a huge morale boost for the remainder of the season. These guys are now confident they can book a place in the postseason. For that, however, they need to keep on winning, which is why getting a win at MetLife Stadium is a must.</p>
<p>It won’t be easy, though, as they’re taking on the in-form New York Giants, who need a win to keep their playoff dream alive. If they lose the Week 14 MNF game, they can say goodbye to the postseason.</p>

<p>Green Bay Packers Feeling Confident They Can Make the Playoffs</p>
<p>In their first season without Aaron Rodgers as their quarterback, the Packers are 6-6. That’s an impressive record given everything, but they think they can take it a step further and get to the postseason.</p>
<p>The only way they can do it is through the wild card, as taking the No. 1 spot from the Detroit Lions in the NFC North seems like a mission impossible. To book a wild card ticket to the playoffs, however, they need a few more wins.</p>
<p>The good news for their fans is that the worst is behind them. Their schedule for the remainder of the season looks relatively easy as they’ve already played against real heavyweights. They lost to some, but we also saw them beat some huge favorites.</p>
<p>Jordan Love's stats during the #Packers 3-game win streak:</p>
<p>• 74 for 108 (68.5%)</p>
<p>• 857 passing yards</p>
<p>• 8 TDs – 0 INTs</p>
<p>• 116.9 passer rating</p>
<p>• 49 rushing yards pic.twitter.com/mJli8Bqfcj — NFL Stats (@NFL_Stats) December 5, 2023</p>
<p>The best example is their most recent game, in which they beat the Kansas City Chiefs 27-19. Their defense was brilliant that day, doing a great job at keeping Patrick Mahomes to just one passing TD.</p>
<p>Offensively, they were equally good, with QB Jordan Love going 25-for-36 for 267 yards and three touchdowns. It was his second straight game with 3 TDs, showing that Rodgers’ replacement is in fabulous shape right now.</p>
<p>All or Nothing for New York Giants</p>
<p>The Week 14 Monday Night Football game could be crucial for the New York Giants. If they lose on Monday, they’re gonna be 4-9 and their chance of making the postseason will be reduced to only a few percent. This goes especially for the fact that they’re yet to play two games against last season’s winners of the NFC, the Philadelphia Eagles.</p>
<p>Knowing this, the Packers vs. Giants game is a must-win for New Yorkers, but the problem is that they don’t seem capable of pulling it off. The reason why they won their last two games was that they played against out-of-form teams – the New England Patriots (2-10) and Washington Commanders (4-9).</p>
<p>The Giants’ defense has been doing alright in 2023, but we’re not 100% positive they can stop the raging Jordan Love and the Packers. Still, their biggest problem ahead of the Week 14 MNF game is that their offense seems pretty anemic.</p>
<p>They’re second from behind when it comes to scoring, with just 13.3 points per game on average. That number would’ve been even lower if they didn’t score 31 points against Washington. They scored four TDs that day, with one of those being a pick 6 touchdown scored by their defense.</p>
<p>Green Bay Packers vs. New York Giants Prediction</p>
<p>The Packers at Giants odds suggest the visitors from Wisconsin are going to win this game and we can only agree. However, we’re not sure that they’re going to cover the 6.5-point spread. Instead, we think this is going to be a very close game, probably with not many TDs on either side.</p>
<p>Picks: New York Giants +6.5 (-105) &amp; Under 37.5 Points (-115)</p>
