<p>The latest appointment comes after earlier this month, Richard Brown stepped down from his CEO role to transition to a board advisory position</p>
<p>The leading iGaming technology company delivering services and solutions to the iGaming vertical, Gaming Innovation Group (GiG), announced a new strategic senior-level appointment. On Friday, the company confirmed that its Board of Directors selected Jonas Warrer to serve as acting group CEO. GiG explained that the appointment is effective immediately.</p>
<p>Taking on the role of acting group CEO of GiG, Warrer will hold a dual role, considering he will continue to be the CEO of GiG’s Media division. He will continue to hold the dual role until the company finalizes the separation of its GiG Media and Platform and Sportsbook divisions.</p>
<p>The planned split was announced earlier this year, following a strategic review of GiG’s operations and growth plans. Ultimately, the company identified that splitting the business units would enable them to grow at a faster rate than under the current business structure.</p>
<p>Petter Nylander, GiG’s executive chairman, revealed that the company is delighted to see Warrer take on the new role of acting CEO. He explained that the latest appointment comes during a strategic moment of splitting GiG into two separate entities. Nylander spoke about the positive change this split will bring, including shareholder value. Finally, GiG’s executive chairman spoke about the extensive experience Warrer brings, highlighting his exceptional performance over the last few years with the company’s C-suite.</p>
<p>“We are very pleased to appoint Jonas as acting CEO through the process of splitting GiG into two distinct entities to enhance future expansion and drive shareholder value, in addition to his role as head of GiG Media.“ Petter Nylander, executive chairman of GiG</p>
<p>The Company Completed Multiple C-Level Changes Recently</p>
<p>The appointment of Warrer comes after earlier this month, GiG confirmed that Richard Brown stepped down from his role as CEO. At the time, the company revealed that he would move to a board advisory position. Brown will remain with that role through December 31, 2023, revealed GiG at the time.</p>
<p>Another recent important management-level appointment involved the company’s Platform and Sportsbook division. Back in August, GiG confirmed that Richard Carter was appointed to the role of CEO of its Platform and Sportsbook division, strengthening its leadership team.</p>
<p>Focusing once again on the latest appointment, Warrer first joined GiG back in 2017. This happened at a time when GiG acquired Rebel Penguin Aps, a company where he held the role of managing director and founder. Spearheading the expansion of GiG Media, Warrer held several important roles. Under his strategic guidance, the unit has seen strong growth and impressive development.</p>
