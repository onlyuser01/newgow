<p>Relum and Spinomenal have formed a new content alliance that will focus on the delivery of cutting-edge and innovative titles as well as the accompanying products that help partner operators leverage an array of promotional tools to achieve better engagement with audiences.</p>
<p>Relum presently features a portfolio of more than 14,000games, which is maintained with the help of 180 suppliers which are some of the biggest names in the iGaming industry. This list is now also completed by Spinomenal. Thanks to its reach with hundreds of suppliers, Relum is similarly able to stay on track with the latest trends in the iGaming content segment.</p>
<p>This allows it to bring more titles that are optimized to match player tastes and bring a number of personalized and tailored solutions to the iGaming libraries of hundreds of operators, or even more. Spinomenal is an important ally on this path to becoming the most distinct one-stop-shop for content, according to Relum.</p>
<p>Spinomenal presently features more than 300 games, and it maintains a fast pace of development with several releases every month. The company’s library is guided by the principles of player-first solutions and innovative content.</p>
<p>Commenting on the release, Emil Hakobian, the Chief Executive Officer at Relum, said that the two companies were opening a new chapter of their mutual journey to success through the introduction of this alliance.</p>
<p>"Constant growth and the quest for excellence through perfecting their products in innovative ways are the traits that unite Relum and Spinomenal," the executive and the company said in an update. Relum and Spinomenal are determined to use their respective understanding of the iGaming sector to bring even more worthwhile and exceptional iGaming experiences to improve their client success, the companies concluded.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Spinomenal has been busy with launches in new jurisdictions and with fresh operators. The company signed an important deal with Luckia in Spain, and is determined to maintain its European pace of expansion. This will now be easier with Relum’s assistance.</p>
