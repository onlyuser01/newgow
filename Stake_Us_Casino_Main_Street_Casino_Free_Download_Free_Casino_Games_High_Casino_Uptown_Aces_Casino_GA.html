<p>The end of the year has brought some changes at the highest tiers of GAN’s operations with the Board of Directors confirming the moves</p>
<p>Notably, Seamus McGill has confirmed that he will be stepping down as chairman of the board and he will be succeeded by David Goldberg in the important position as the holiday season is now set in.</p>
<p>GAN Executes Quick Staff Change at the Top During Holiday Season</p>
<p>McGill’s decision to step down comes after GAN, a B2B technology provider for the iGaming industry, has confirmed that it has entered a definitive agreement to merge with Sega Sammy Creation, owned by Sega Sammy Holdings. McGill will continue to serve as an interim CEO following the departure of Dermot Smurfit.</p>
<p>Besides McGill, the company has also confirmed that Michael Smurfit will step down from the Board of Directors with effect from December 31, 2023. Michael Smurfit added, commenting on his withdrawal as well as the pending merger with Sega Sammy Creation:</p>
<p>With the strategic review concluded, I feel that now is the appropriate time for me to step down from the board of directors. I am fully supportive of the transaction with Sega Sammy Creation and look forward to a timely closing. Michael Smurfit</p>
<p>Furthermore, GAN has also appointed David D. Ross to the Board of Directors, replacing its ranks. He will be chairman of GAN’s audit committee, and his appointment has been welcomed by Goldenberg, who said that Ross brought more than 35 years of experience in various positions and he has served as both executive and director across the gaming and hospitality sector, giving him a very good background to now be part of GAN.</p>
