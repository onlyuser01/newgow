<p>BetRivers, the sportsbook operated by Rush Street Interactive (RSI), announced a controlled demonstration launch in Maryland on November 21, 2022, from 2 pm to 10 pm, ahead of the official launch of online sports betting in the state.</p>
<p>During the demonstration period, Marylanders can register, deposit, wager and withdraw with the BetRivers sportsbook using mobile devices, tablets and desktops, as well as take advantage of the operator’s early registration offer.</p>
<p>Richard Schwartz, chief executive officer of RSI, is content to see this “much-anticipated launch of online and mobile sports betting in Maryland” take place in time for some important sporting events such as the action in the NFL and college football over Thanksgiving, thrilled to be able to present Marylanders with “an exciting sports betting experience…at the touch of their fingertips.”</p>
<p>Once the controlled demonstration period is over and pending receipt of regulatory approval, BetRivers should be in line to go live with the official online sports betting market launch in the Old Line State on Wednesday, November 23, 2022.</p>
<p>NBA and the World Cup</p>
<p>Schwartz also noted that BetRivers will be offering Marylanders many other exciting options besides wagering on football such as single-game parlays on the NBA and college basketball and wagers on the FIFA 2022 World Cup, to let them see for themselves “why RSI and BetRivers have received numerous recognitions from the industry.”</p>
<p>“BetRivers offers an innovative yet simple website and app experience, with more and quicker ways to deposit and withdraw funds, all supported by best-in-class customer service that works hard every day to earn and retain player trust,” he concluded.</p>
<p>Featuring thousands of betting options, including spreads, moneylines, props, futures, same-game parlays, and others, the BetRivers sportsbook is ready to capture the hearts of fans of all major professional and collegiate sports in the state.</p>
<p>In addition to the betting options, the website and app feature integrated betting content and live streaming, seamless payment options and unique bonus schemes and rewards programs, including the industry’s fastest conversion of bonuses to cash, and to mark the arrival of BetRivers in Maryland, RSI is offering first-time depositors a second chance bet of up to $500, on their first bet if it loses.</p>
<p>Recently, RSI signed some prominent figures as BetRivers brand ambassadors, including radio host Bob McCown, veteran sports host Mike Missanelli and sports reporter Natasha Staniszewski to help popularize the brand and engage with its customers.</p>
