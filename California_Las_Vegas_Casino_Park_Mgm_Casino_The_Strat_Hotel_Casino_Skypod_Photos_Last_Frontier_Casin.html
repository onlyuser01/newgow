<p>The WSOP is giving poker players around the world ample notice for making travel plans for its Las Vegas tournament next year, having announced 12 events so far.</p>
<p>WSOP Announces First Las Vegas Events</p>
<p>Last week, it was announced that the 2020 World Series of Poker Las Vegas would take place from May 26th to July 15th. Now, the organizers of the tournament have confirmed the first few events that will be taking place. These are considered some of the most important events of the WSOP, so players will be able to begin planning for the tournament already.</p>
<p>“While we are still putting together the 2020 WSOP schedule in its entirety, we have cemented the key no-limit hold’em events that anchor it all. We will continue to fill out the rest of the schedule and provide updates as we progress.” – a statement from WSOP organizers</p>
<p>Here are the events that we know of so far:</p>
<p>Date Event Buy-In Re-Entry Time May 27 Casino Employees $500 1 3 p.m. May 28-31 Big 50 $500 1/flight 10 a.m. June 5-6 Millionaire Maker $1,500 1/flight 10 a.m. June 12-13 Monster Stack $1,500 0 10 a.m. June 17 Ladies $10,000/$1,000 1 11 a.m. June 18 Seniors – 50+ $1,000 1 10 a.m. June 19-20 Double Stack $1,000 1/flight 10 a.m. June 22 Super Seniors – 60+ $1,000 1/flight 10 a.m. June 22 Tag Team $1,000/Team 0 2 p.m. June 24-25 Colossus $400 1/flight 10 a.m. June 26-27 Crazy Eights $888 1/flight 10 a.m. &amp; 5 p.m. June 29 Mini Main Event $1,000 0 11 a.m. July 1-13 Main Event $10,000 0 11 a.m. July 4-6 Little One For One Drop $1,000+$111 Unlimited 12 p.m. July 10-11 The Closer $1,500 1/flight 12 p.m</p>
<p>Many Options for a Variety of Players</p>
<p>By looking at the first 12 events, there seems to be a good mix of buy-ins. From $500 for the Big 50 and the Casino Employees event all the way up to $10,000 for the Main Event where millions are available for the winner, there is a decent choice for players with a wide variety of buy-ins.</p>
<p>Of course, $500 may be a bit too expensive for some players, but there are always loads of satellites available for players to enter online. Last year, there were satellites and feeder events with buy-ins ranging from $1 to $10. So, even players who have small budgets can play their way to the WSOP next year.</p>
<p>There will surely be many more events announced, but this is unlikely to happen until the new year. Until then, these 12 events should give you a good idea of the key dates for the 2020 WSOP just in case you want to start making your travel plans for the new year.</p>
