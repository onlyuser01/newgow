<p>The nine brick-and-mortar casino floors combined last month to win more than $248.5 million in gross gaming revenue (GGR). September 2021 represented a nearly 11 percent increase (or $24 million) on September 2019, when the casinos collectively won $224.5 million.</p>
<p>Slot machines at the shore won approximately $182 million, an increase of 14 percent from September 2019. Table games kept $66.5 million of gamblers’ bets last month, a two percent premium on the same month in 2019.</p>
<p>Atlantic City is enjoying a strong recovery,” James Plousis, chair of the New Jersey Casino Control Commission, told Casino.org. “Compared to pre-pandemic September 2019, last month’s results were impressive.”</p>
<p>Media headlines regarding New Jersey’s gaming industry have recently touted a roaring comeback. That’s following the harshest periods of COVID-19. But the reports were slightly misleading, as a substantial component of the monthly gaming hauls were derived online. Atlantic City casinos keep far less of the revenue for online gaming than they do at their land-based businesses.</p>
<p>September 2021 finally showed that the industry is capable of growing online, while not negatively impacting business at the actual casino properties.</p>
<p>$3B Mark Eclipsed</p>
<p>Atlantic City’s nine casinos each made year-over-year GGR brick-and-mortar gains in September. And paired with their internet gaming and sports betting operations, September was one to remember.</p>
<p>GGR from iGaming totaled $122.6 million, and the casinos’ oddsmakers kept $34 million of the sports bets wagered. Both figures are up substantially on September 2020.</p>
<p>Atlantic City GGR from retail, online, and sports betting totaled approximately $405.1 million in September 2021. That’s a 39 percent year-over-year surge, and 43 percent better than September 2019.</p>
<p>Sports betting revenue generated by the three state horse racetracks, plus their online sportsbook operations, totaled $48.4 million.</p>
<p>All told, $453.56 million was won by gambling entities in New Jersey last month. That gigantic figure brings the state gaming industry’s year-to-date GGR to more than $3.4 billion. Plousis explains that it took through November in 2020 for the industry to eclipse the $3 billion mark.</p>
<p>“September’s results demonstrate that in-person casino gaming and internet gaming are a winning combination,” Plousis declared. “Atlantic City’s many options are appealing to different segments of the gaming public and can be a formula for its success.”</p>
<p>Record Sports Betting</p>
<p>The $82.4 million oddsmakers inside New Jersey won in September is their best month ever. The first legal sports bet was wagered by Gov. Phil Murphy (D) in June of 2018.</p>
<p>Oddsmakers took more than $1 billion in bets in September. It’s the first time a legal sports betting state in the country has seen more than $1 billion in action in a single month. All but $92.6 million of the $1.011 billion bet was placed through regulated online sportsbooks operating inside the state.</p>
<p>Year to date, oddsmakers have won $526.3 million off of sports bettors. Parlays account for the majority of the revenue at 17.6 percent.</p>
