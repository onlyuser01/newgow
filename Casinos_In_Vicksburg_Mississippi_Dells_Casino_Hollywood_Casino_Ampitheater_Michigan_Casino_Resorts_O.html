<p>Led by an MVP candidate Josh Allen, the Bills are the team that’s scored more points than any other team in the NFL. They’ve also been great on defense, but their record might get tarnished on Monday night.</p>
<p>It’s because the Bills’ defense will be playing against one of the NFL’s best offenses. With Henry, Brown, and Jones, the Titans look capable of outplaying literally any defense in the league.</p>
<p>The question is will that be enough to break the Bills winning streak?</p>

<p>Buffalo Wants to Continue Winning</p>
<p>The Buffalo Bills are the most impressive NFL team in the 2021 season. They lost the season opener, but then went on to win the following four games. Not only did they win those but they did it in style. In those four games, they conceded just 41 points, while scoring 156.</p>
<p>What’s even more fascinating is that they played against some really tough opponents, most notably the Kansas City Chiefs. The game in question happened last week at Arrowhead Stadium. The noise from the stands of the Chiefs’ home venue didn’t stop the visitors from winning 38-20.</p>
<p>In Week 6, they got an easier job – they’re facing the Tennessee Titans. Sure, the Titans have some real superstars on the roster, but they haven’t been great so far.</p>
<p>Tennessee’s Offense Needs to Step Up</p>
<p>It’s common knowledge that the Titans aren’t great in the defense. However, they’re famously great in the offense. No surprise there, as they got some of the NFL’s best players on the roster. Unfortunately, some of their biggest stars have been failing to stay healthy this season.</p>
<p>The good news is that Julio Jones and A.J. Brown are ready to return. Add to that the fact that Derick Henry has been fantastic so far and you’ll understand why the Bills need to be worried.</p>
<p>On top of everything, the Titans QB has been playing really well in 2021. He just needs to step it up a notch.</p>
<p>Does all this mean the Titans will grab a win on Monday night? Probably not, as their defense just doesn’t seem good enough to stop Josh Allen and the Bills’ offense.</p>
<p>Pick: Buffalo Bills to win but not cover the spread; over should hit.</p>
