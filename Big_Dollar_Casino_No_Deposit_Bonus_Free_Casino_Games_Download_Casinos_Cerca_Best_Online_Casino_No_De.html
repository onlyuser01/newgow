<p>According to new data by the Department of Health and Human Services, until October 3 a total of 712 people who visited Nevada tested positive for COVID-19. Since the reopening of the casino industry in the Silver State, the number of visitors who tested positive started increasing slowly.</p>
<p>New Data Regarding Positive COVID-19 Cases</p>
<p>More than 700 Nevada visitors tested positive for COVID-19 since casinos in the state reopened their doors for visitors on June 4, new data revealed. By October 3, some 712 visitors tested positive for COVID-19 according to data by the Department of Health and Human Services. Some 21 visitors have tested positive when they returned to their home state, while 691 tested positive while still in Nevada.</p>
<p>It is possible that more visitors were affected but such data is yet to be collected. To identify and count visitors who were affected upon returning to their home state, the local health officials need to contact the health officials in Nevada. By now, only Ohio, California, and Arizona officials have contacted Nevadaâ€™s health officials to report such cases.</p>
<p>The Number of Visitors in Nevada Increases Gradually</p>
<p>The gaming industry in Nevada is slowly recovering from the devastating hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. The shutdown of the casino industry which lasted for three months severely impacted the hospitality and leisure industry which resulted in layoffs and furloughs. Since the reopening of casinos, the number of Nevada visitors who tested positive slowly began to increase. Back in July, some 123 Nevada visitors tested positive for COVID-19. However, in August, the number of positive COVID-19 Nevada visitors increased to 530.</p>
<p>When it comes to the total number of reported positive COVID-19 cases in Nevada, we see that by now there were 112,304 total cases. Out of that number, more than 74,000 patients have recovered. With that in mind, some 1,859 positive COVID-19 patients have deceased.</p>
<p>Changing focus to the number of visitors, according to a report released last month by the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, some 1.7 million people visited Las Vegas in September. This marked a 10.9% increase when compared to the number of visitors from August. Although Nevada is yet to shake off the COVID-19 pandemic, based on the numbers, the gaming industry is on its prolonged way to recovery.</p>
