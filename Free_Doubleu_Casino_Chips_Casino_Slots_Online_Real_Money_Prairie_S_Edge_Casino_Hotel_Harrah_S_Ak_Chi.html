    <h1>Free Doubleu Casino Chips Casino Slots Online Real Money Prairie S Edge Casino Hotel Harrah S Ak Chi</h1>

<p>Dear Ana,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint through our website. I’m very sorry to hear about your problem. Please, could you be so kind and forward to me any relevant communication between you and the casino? It would be very helpful for me to understand the whole issue completely. In the same time, may I ask you if there is any chance that someone from your family members, friends or even neighbors has opened an account from the same IP address?</p>
<p>Please, see below the part of the T&amp;Cs regarding opening a player’s account: "2.1 Magical Spin only allows one account per IP address (registration account IP address or log in IP address), home address (postal address), bank card, email address ... In case a player wishes to open an account while another account is already created within the same home, IP address... an authorization, by email (finance@magicalspin.com) must be issued prior to the opening of the second account. If a player wishes to use someone else's credit card to make a deposit, he must receive permission from the finance department before making the deposit and send an authorizationfrom the cardholder of the credit card (authorization, If granted, will expire at the end of the day in question)."</p>
<p>In the event that, following a verification (random or not), Magical Spin realizes that one of these rules has been violated, all accounts in question will be blocked without notice and any balance of the balance or any request for withdrawal In progress will be canceled, even if the account (s) have been verified beforehand, the verification of account being just an identity check.</p>
<p>Thank you very much in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
