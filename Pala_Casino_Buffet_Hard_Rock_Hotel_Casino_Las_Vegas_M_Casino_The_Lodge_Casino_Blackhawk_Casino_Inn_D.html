<p>Bally’s, the owner of Dover Downs Hotel &amp; Casino, has renamed the property Bally’s Dover Casino Resort. The news was announced on Monday and the main goal with this move is to align Bally’s growing brand with Dover Downs.</p>
<p>Bally’s Purchased the Property in 2018</p>
<p>Dover Downs was purchased by Bally’s back in 2018. At the time, the casino was operating under a different name – Twin River. After Bally’s Casino in Atlantic City was purchased, the rebranding process was done last fall. The casino in Atlantic City started its multi-million renovation process in mid-September.</p>
<p>Bally’s has recorded massive growth since it purchased Dover Downs. In the three-year period, the brand has grown from 4 to 14 casino resorts, a majority of which have transitioned to its name. Moreover, Bally’s affixed its name to 19 sports networks that are operating regionally in a Sinclair Broadcasting naming rights agreement.</p>
<p>Philadelphia is one of few markets where a Bally Sports network is unavailable. Previously, these networks were named Fox Sports.</p>
<p>Bally’s is also taking full advantage of the growth of the online betting industry in the US as it possesses sports wagering licenses in 16 states. All US states where betting is legalized have been raking in millions of dollars. In September, New Jersey became the first state to top $1 billion in sports betting handle and a majority of the handle came from online betting. The revenue of the state of state reached $82.4 million for that month.</p>
<p>The year 2021 has been nothing short but extraordinary for Bally’s, as it had several acquisitions, which will definitely help the company climb to the top. The sweet cherry top, in this case, is its merger with Gamesys as Bally’s agreed to pay $25.77 per Gamesys share and the total value of the contract was estimated at around $2.69 billion.</p>
<p>Dover Downs will be provided with a “boost” in December as it will be updated with new gaming chips, cards, dice and table layouts, as well as new signage. Bally Rewards is also being used in the casino now. As a press release reports, all existing rewards will be integrated with the new system.</p>
<p>On the other hand, even though Dover Downs was sold in 2018, Dover Motorsports remained independent. However, all of that is about to change as Speedway Motorsports has recently announced that it has plans to purchase Dover Motorsports. Speedway Motorsports is among the largest speedway operators and owners in the state.</p>
<p>As For Dover Motorsports, it is the owner of the Nashville Superspeedway and Dover International Speedway. Moreover, it hosts the Firefly Music Festival, which is held annually and is produced by AEG Presents.</p>
