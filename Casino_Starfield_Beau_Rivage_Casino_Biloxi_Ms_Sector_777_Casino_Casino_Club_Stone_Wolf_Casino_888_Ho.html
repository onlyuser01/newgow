<p>888 Holdings has teamed up with Global Payments’ iGaming solutions to boosts the available payment system for its SI Sportsbook. The solution will enable consumers to enjoy a better overall onboarding journey insofar as their payment options are concerned.</p>
<p>Better Payment Options for Sports Bettors</p>
<p>SI Sportsbook consumers who prefer to connect via a mobile or a smart device will have the full advantage of a multi-channel solution that allows them to bet interactively and on-site. Global Payments will deploy its signature VIP Preferred Online ACH system which is built specifically to cater to the needs of sports fans looking to make rapid deposits and withdrawals from their accounts.</p>
<p>Commenting on this technological adoption, Globally Payments Gaming Solutions president Christopher Justice said that Global Payments is fully focused on providing partners with leading solutions for the sports betting sector, securing a worthwhile and trustworthy experience for consumers:</p>
<p>“We are pleased to partner with SI Sportsbook to help them launch innovative online betting solutions for sports fans” Globally Payments Gaming Solutions president Christopher Justice</p>
<p>SI Sportsbook is a new arrival in the highly-contested sports betting market in the United States. The company launched the product in 2021 and has been able to leverage the technology powering the 888 Holdings own products to scale its reach through brand visibility with the Sports Illustrated brand.</p>
<p>Sports Illustrated Planning Big for Future</p>
<p>The brand is still preparing to scale further as it’s currently only running in Colorado. And will be launching in more states as it’s preparing for a more scalable solution. 888 director of business development John Atkinson welcomed the adoption of this new technology and said it would further enhance the player experience. He further added:</p>
<p>“Delivering a first-class betting and gaming experience is what SI Sportsbook was created for, and a key part of this is offering players a diverse suite of payment options.” 888 director of business development John Atkinson</p>
<p>Sports betting is expanding throughout the United States. Earlier this year, Sports Illustrated announced its resorts concept that was designed to attract more mass consumers in the tourist sector. The company announced that it will focus on building actual resorts across the United States and beyond.</p>
