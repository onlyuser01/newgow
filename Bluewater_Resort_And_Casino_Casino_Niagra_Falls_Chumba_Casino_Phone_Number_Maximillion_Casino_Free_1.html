<p>It’s time for the penultimate race in the regular season of the 2022 NASCAR Cup Series. The race in question is the 2022 Go Bowling at The Glen, which is on the program on Sunday, August 21, at the Watkins Glen International track in Watkins Glen, New York. The race consists of 90 laps over a 2.45-mile course, meaning that the total distance cars have to cover is 220.5 miles.</p>
<p>The first NASCAR race to take place on this course was in 1957, while the company has been holding events at The Glen without interruptions every year since 1986. Hendrick Motorsports is the most successful team on this course with a total of nine wins. Their driver Kyle Larson is the man who won the event last year.</p>
<p>Oddsmakers expect him to do well in this year’s race too, although he’s not the #1 favorite to triumph on Sunday. Instead, the #1 in the Drivers’ championship is the betting favorite. The man in question is chase Elliott who’s priced at +500. Just behind him is Tyler Reddick with +600, while Larson is the only other driver with three-figure odds. His odds are +900.</p>
<p>What’s interesting is that the winner of the previous two races, Kevin Harvick, is sitting in the #15 position on the list of The Glen 2022 favorites.</p>

<p>Top Favorites to win the 2022 Go Bowling at The Glen</p>
<p>Chase Elliott is the betting favorite for several reasons. First of all, he’s the leader in the Drivers’ championship. He’s already booked his place in the NASCAR Playoffs, but he is without a win (or even a podium finish) since July. Getting a win on Sunday would certainly put him in the right mood for the postseason.</p>
<p>Another reason why Elliott needs to be thought of as the favorite is that he loves racing at The Glen. He likes these types of courses, as evident from the fact that he already has two The Glen wins in his portfolio.</p>
<p>Just behind Elliott is Tyler Reddick, another driver who excels in road-course racing. The winner of the 2022 Verizon 200 at the Brickyard and the 2022 Kwik Trip 250 is the second favorite to triumph on Sunday. This guy also has the motivation on his side as he’s currently 14th in the rankings, meaning that his place in the Playoffs still isn’t secure.</p>
<p>Then, there’s Kyle Larson, the winner of the 2021 race. He’s third in the Drivers’ championship standings, but he is without a race win since February. Maybe this Saturday is when his drought ends?</p>
<p>2022 The Glen Prediction</p>
<p>Anything can happen in this race, but our pick is Tyler Reddick. This guy is brilliant when racing on courses like the one at The Glen. Further, he needs to do well to secure a spot in the NASCAR Playoffs. We think he’s going to win, but even if he doesn’t, he should finish in the Top 3.</p>
<p>Pick: Tyler Reddick to win</p>
