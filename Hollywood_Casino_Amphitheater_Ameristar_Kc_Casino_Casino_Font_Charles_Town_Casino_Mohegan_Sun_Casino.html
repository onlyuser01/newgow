    <h1>Hollywood Casino Amphitheater Ameristar Kc Casino Casino Font Charles Town Casino Mohegan Sun Casino</h1>

<p>Hello, I have been scammed by this casino. On Sunday 12 December I deposited € 300 and during the same day and the following day, playing lightning roulette and a slot machine, I reached a balance of € 5450. I immediately requested the maximum weekly withdrawal of 1500 euros by bank transfer. On Monday 13 December around 10 am, when I log into my account, I get the warning that my account is suspended for an internal investigation. I immediately ask for explanations via email and chat. Laura my vip manager wrote me that the account was suspended because two weeks earlier I had asked for a refund on the deposits made as I had sent an email requesting the closure of the account which was ignored for two whole weeks and I continued to pay and lose. In total I have paid € 5500 to this casino since it opened. Since I kept losing I had asked for the closure of the game account via email as they do not allow it via chat. I have not received any response for days, my account remained open and I continued to deposit money and lost it all. I then sent a complaint email to obtain a refund of the deposits from the date of the account closure request. No answer, account remains open and I continue to pay. Until Sunday arrives when, after about 6 days from the last deposit made and lost, I make another 300 euros and for the first time I win and win a lot, up to the figure of 5450 euros. At that point, as already said at the beginning, I ask for the withdrawal and they think well to suspend the account. As long as I was losing money, everything was fine for them, but when I win for the first time they block everything. So, as said, I contact the VIP manager and she reassures me that everything would be sorted out because there was a misunderstanding about the complaint I had made about the deposits to be repaid and they had to understand the situation. I replied that I had never received an answer to the complaints and since my gaming account had remained open, the winnings obtained were legitimate and to be paid naturally without requiring the reimbursement of previous deposits which in any case added up to the same amount as the winnings obtained. She replies that she would have notified the finance department and that it would be alright and not to worry that it was all a misunderstanding. Result? Today Wednesday 15 December I find my account closed with my money inside. I therefore ask you for your help because here we are faced with a real casino scam that used the excuse of requesting refunds which, however, I did not have for not paying the winnings. So they kept the money from my disputed deposits as well as the winnings. Of course, I want my winnings to be paid to me because they are legitimized by the fact that they were obtained with an account opened two weeks after the request to close the account. I have saved all the screenshots of the chats and the mails sent and received. Thank you in advance</p>
