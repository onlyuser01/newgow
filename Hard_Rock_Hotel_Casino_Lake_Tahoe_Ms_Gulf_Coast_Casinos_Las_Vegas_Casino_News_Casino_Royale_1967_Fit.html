<p>The last time the New England Patriots played against the Pittsburgh Steelers, Bill Belichick’s boys won 33-3. Three years have passed since and it doesn’t look very likely they’re going to blow out their opponents again. In fact, online bookmakers expect a close game on Sunday, which is when the Patriots vs Steelers Week 2 game is on the program.</p>

<p>New England’s Offense Needs to Do Better in Week 2</p>
<p>The third season without Tom Brady as the New England Patriots quarterback started with a 20-7 loss to the Miami Dolphins. The man in charge of signal-calling is second-year quarterback Mac Jones who was very impressive in his rookie season, but who didn’t do great in Week 1 of the 2022 season.</p>
<p>Jones went 21 for 30 for 213 yards, passing for one touchdown (scored by the Pats’ new WR Ty Montgomery), but also getting one of his passes intercepted. Not only did their QB have a quiet game, but so did his teammates from the Pats’ offensive team. As a result, New England scored just seven points in total, getting shut out in three-quarters of the game.</p>
<p>New England’s defense did an okay job in Week 1, despite conceding 20 points to the Dolphins. They did come close to forcing a Miami turnover on two occasions when the ball was fumbled, but the Dolphins managed to recover it each time.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh Coming Off a Win Over AFC Champion</p>
<p>The Pittsburgh Steelers must feel good about themselves ahead of Week 2, following the win over their archrivals in Week 1. As a reminder, the Steers beat the AFC champions, the Cincinnati Bengals 23-20 after overtime. The best thing is that they did it on Bengals’ turf.</p>
<p>Their defense did great in the game, especially in the first half, when we saw them turn over Joe Burrow four times. They went to the locker room with a 17-6 lead, but the Bengals somehow managed to equalize the score by the end of the regulation. They even got a chance to get themselves a win with a field goal, but the Steelers’ defense stepped in again. This time, it was free safety Minkah Fitzpatrick who saved the day, blocking the three-point shot.</p>
<p>After 10 minutes of play in the overtime, placekicker Chris Boswell brought Pittsburgh their first victory of the 2022 season.</p>
<p>Patriots vs Steelers Prediction</p>
<p>Both teams are great in the offense, but neither New England nor Pittsburgh can be too proud of their offensive team. Still, we do think the Patriots have the potential to do better offensively. The Steelers? Not so much. Their QB Mitchell Trubisky just isn’t great, and we don’t expect to see him do much against the Pats.</p>
<p>Picks: New England Patriots to win; under 40.5 points</p>
