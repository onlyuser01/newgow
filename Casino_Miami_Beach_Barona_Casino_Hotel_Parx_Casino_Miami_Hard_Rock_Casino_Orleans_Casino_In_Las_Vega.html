<p>The new content agreement will expand Wazdan‘s presence in Switzerland and will cement Golden Grand its sixth client in country</p>
<p>Wazdan, an award-winning provider of iGaming titles and solutions, announced that it has entered into an agreement with Golden Grand, a Swiss gambling operator. Under the deal, Wazdan will supply the operator with a selection of its finest games.</p>
<p>As agreed, Wazdan will make some of its most engaging slot games available to Golden Grand players. This will include fan favorites such as 9 Lions, Power of Gods: Hades, Magic Spins, Sizzling Moon and Sun of Fortune. The provider will also power Golden Grand with its premium engagement-boosting features, which include mechanics such as Collect to Infinity and Hold the Jackpot.</p>
<p>Golden Grand is an iGaming brand owned by Airport Casino Basel AG. It was launched more than a year ago and is now considered one of the fastest-growing iGaming sites in the country. As a result, the deal will help Wazdan bolster its Swiss presence and reach thousands of new players.</p>
<p>The iGaming brand will notably become Wazdan’s sixth partner in the country. The provider has been keen on augmenting its footprint in Switzerland, which launched its online gambling market in 2019.</p>
<p>Golden Grand Is Sure Its Players Are Going to Love the New Content</p>
<p>Golden Grand’s director of online casino, Adrian Schiesser, commented on the agreement with Wazdan. He lauded the developer’s titles as “some of the most advanced and exciting games available on the market” and said that his team is delighted to be able to offer them to its players.</p>
<p>Schiesser is certain that the new titles will resonate with local audiences.</p>
<p>We are highly confident that Wazdan’s innovative gameplay, unique features, and high-quality graphics will have a lot of success on Golden Grand. Adrian Schiesser, director online casino, Golden Grand</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Andrzej Hyla, Wazdan’s chief commercial officer, said that Switzerland remains a jurisdiction of top priority for his company. The country represents a great opportunity to expand the company’s overall European reach, Hyla noted. He added that he is looking forward to working with Golden Grand.</p>
<p>We are delighted to partner with Golden Grand and deliver our comprehensive slot offering for even more players to enjoy. Andrzej Hyla, CCO, Wazdan</p>
<p>The deal with Golden Grand is the latest in a string of agreements amid what has been a very successful start of the year for Wazdan. Some weeks ago, the provider also expanded its content reach in Spain thanks to an agreement with Versus Casinos. At the beginning of February, on the other hand, Wazdan released an update on its partnership with Play North, saying that it has been a very productive one so far.</p>
