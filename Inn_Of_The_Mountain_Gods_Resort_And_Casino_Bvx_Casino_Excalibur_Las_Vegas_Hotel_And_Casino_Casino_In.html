<p>Fred Done said that raising awareness of prostate cancer is just as important as the donation</p>
<p>Betfred, a British gambling operator, has made a donation to Prostate Cancer UK, a charity organization that supports people with prostate cancer. The donation comes in the wake of the Betfred British Masters golf tournament.</p>
<p>The total donated sum is £84,000 (around $107,000). It follows the operator’s promise to donate £500 for every eagle made during the competition. In addition, the operator had pledged to donate £500 for every successful drive to the green on the Belfry’s 10th hole.</p>
<p>In the end, a total of 42 eagles were made through the four rounds, securing £21,000 for the donation.</p>
<p>Finally, Betfred had promised a donation of £50,000 for any hole-in-one made on the 14th hole at the Brabazon Golf Court – a feat that Sir Nick Faldo achieved in 1993. The one to score the feat this year was Matthew Baldwin who singlehandedly increased the donation by £75,000.</p>
<p>Betfred, which has collaborated with Prostate Cancer UK for a while now, has raised almost £200,000 ($254,000) over the last three editions of the Betfred British Masters at The Belfry.</p>
<p>Raising Awareness Is Just as Important</p>
<p>Prostate Cancer UK’s chief executive officer, Laura Kerby, commented on the event, saying that it has been unforgettable. She thanked everyone who made this event special, including Matt Baldwin and his “incredible life-changing hole-in-one,” as well as the players and personalities who wore the Man of Men badge.</p>
<p>Kerby also thanked everyone who came to the event village to participate in Prostate Cancer UK’s Long Putt Challenge.</p>
<p>From Matt Baldwin’s incredible life-changing hole-in-one, to players and personalities wearing our Man of Men badge and supporters flocking to the event village to take on our Long Putt Challenge, talking to our volunteers and perhaps having a portion of Faldo’s Fish and Chips we’re proud to have been a big part of such an iconic event. Laura Kerby, CEO, Prostate Cancer UK</p>
<p>Betfred’s owner, Fred Done, spoke about the charity initiative. He said that what matters is not only the money but the awareness Betfred and Prostate Cancer UK rose. Done emphasized the importance of letting people know that they should get checked.</p>
<p>I’m very pleased with that [the donation], but promoting it is as important as giving the money. Fred Done, owner, Betfred</p>
<p>In other news, Betfred recently joined forces with Spotlight Sports Group to work on a sponsorship opportunity with Racing Post’s “What a Shout” show.</p>
