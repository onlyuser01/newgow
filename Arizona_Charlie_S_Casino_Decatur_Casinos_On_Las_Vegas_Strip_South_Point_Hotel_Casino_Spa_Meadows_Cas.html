<p>William Hill, one of the oldest gambling companies in the United Kingdom, has signed a new agreement with the Randox Grand National Festival, a major annual horse race. As announced by the operator, it will serve as the festival’s official betting partner for the next three years.</p>
<p>In addition to becoming the official betting partner of the Randox Grand National, William Hill will also be designated as the sponsor of three ITV-televised races during the festival. These include the Grade 1 William Hill Aintree Hurdle on April 13, the William Hill Handicap Hurdle the following day and the Grade 3 William Hill Handicap Chase on the day after.</p>
<p>The Randox Grand National 2023 is a three-day race that will start on Thursday, April 13. This means that William Hill will have a presence during all days of the event. In addition, the leading British operator has already secured a presence at the Liverpool track and will have several on-course shops.</p>
<p>William Hill used the opportunity to announce that it is the first bookmaker to go Non Runner, Money Back on the 2023 Randox Grand National. This announcement follows the success of the similar products the operator offered during the Cheltenham Festival. The popularity of the offering saw bet365 launch its own NRNB bets.</p>
<p>Horse Racing Is in Hill’s DNA</p>
<p>Daryl West, William Hill’s head of sponsorship, socials and PR, commented on the agreement with the Randox Grand National, praising the festival as “one of the pinnacles of the national hunt calendar. West noted that his team is glad to be involved in the festival by serving as its official betting partner.</p>
<p>The sponsorship head added that horse racing is a vital part of William Hill’s essence, which is why the decision to support the festival was a no-brainer.</p>
<p>Horseracing is a vital part of our heritage, and it was an easy decision for us to support not just the biggest race in the sport but a huge event in the annual sporting calendar. Daryl West. head of sponsorships, socials and PR, William Hill</p>
<p>Dickon White, Aintree &amp; North West regional director at The Jockey Club, also commented on the agreement. He welcomed William Hill as a partner and praised the company for choosing to be involved with the event.</p>
<p>William Hill is synonymous with horse racing in this country so we are thrilled they are going to be involved with our flagship meeting at Aintree for the next three years. Dickon White, Aintree &amp; North West regional director, The Jockey Club</p>
<p>In other William Hill-related news, the company just signed the former Jump jockey and 2003 National winner Barry Geraghty as a horse racing ambassador.</p>
