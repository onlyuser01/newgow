    <h1>Pechanga Resort Casino Comic Casino Hinckley Mn Casino Las Vegas Best Casino Shelton Casino Lucky Da</h1>

<p>Dear Kris,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about the issue and understand your frustration. I carefully checked the Bonus Terms on the website, and this is what I found (here):</p>
<p>„Bonuses Terms and Conditions</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>The maximum wager when a Bonus is pending, or actively being turned over is 5€/$ or currency equivalent. This includes Bonus Buy features, where the total cost of the purchase is applicable. You may lose your winnings if you do not follow this rule."</p>
<p>We would like to see casinos implementing systems that would prevent players from placing higher than allowed bets, but, unfortunately, this is not a standard practice yet.</p>
<p>If you are aware of placing higher bets than the allowed ones, sadly, there is not much we can do to support your case at this time. I would strongly recommend reading all the T&amp;Cs carefully before you start playing to avoid any misunderstandings in the future. Casinos try to design their bonuses to be as attractive as possible, but the rules must always be followed.</p>
<p>However, please do not hesitate to forward your game and bonus histories along with any relevant communication to petronela.k@casino.guru if you feel that you’ve been accused mistakenly, otherwise, I will be forced to reject your complaint. Thank you in advance for your reply and understanding.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
