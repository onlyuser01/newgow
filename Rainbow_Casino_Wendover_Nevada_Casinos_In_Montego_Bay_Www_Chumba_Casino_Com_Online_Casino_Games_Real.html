    <h1>Rainbow Casino Wendover Nevada Casinos In Montego Bay Www Chumba Casino Com Online Casino Games Real</h1>

<p>While engaged in a captivating game of 88 FORTUNES online via the Caesars Sportsbook &amp; Casino mobile app in New Jersey, Stacy M. from Edgewater, New Jersey, won the progressive jackpot that stopped at $308,914.50.</p>
<p>“This Can’t Be Real!”</p>
<p>It only took Stacy 20 minutes to spin the reels on her $2.64 spin before she managed to land the watermarked Phoenix symbol on all five reels and score the big win. Originally, the shocked Caesars Rewards member was in disbelief, thinking the win was “a mistake” and that it was “only supposed to be a $3,000 win.”</p>
<p>Besides the monetary win, Caesars also hosted a special celebratory dinner at Gordon Ramsay Hell’s Kitchen at Caesars Atlantic City for Stacy and her family. They were also offered a complimentary stay as a means of honoring the “historic win.” Stacy M. said she was planning to pay off all of her debts with the money and also put a down payment on a new house.</p>
<p>Caesars Digital’s senior vice president of iGaming, Matthew Sunderland, congratulated the winner on behalf of the company for managing to claim “the first big win of the 88 FORTUNES Jackpot Festival.”</p>
<p>He further explained that the respective jackpot and the overall experience that they offered to their lucky customer in Atlantic City was an example of their ability to turn digital wins into world-class opportunities at all of their destinations.</p>
<p>Sunderland called Light &amp; Wonder’s Jackpot Festival “an exciting digital complement” to their current offerings provided at their land venues, praising the superior gameplay which can trigger important winnings.</p>
<p>At the start of February, Caesars also introduced an upgraded traveling and rewards experience that would give visitors better prices when planning vacations and trips to Las Vegas and beyond.</p>
<p>How the 88 FORTUNES Jackpot Festival Works</p>
<p>The wide area progressive jackpot which can be accessed via Light &amp; Wonder’s OPENGAMING platform gives players the opportunity to win larger jackpot rewards with the help of a prize pool generated by several casino operators within the same state.</p>
<p>In this particular case, the jackpot win was generated via Caesars Digital’s partnership with Light &amp; Wonder which allowed the iconic brick-and-mortar game to online players who are customers of the casino.</p>
<p>Light &amp; Wonder’s vice president of game development Rob Procter spoke about the importance of progressive jackpots that “are intrinsic to land-based casinos across the United States.”</p>
<p>He further added that Light &amp; Wonder was now turning them into a “must-have product” included in their Jackpot Festival series, calling the first big win that was secured via the wide area progressive Jackpot Festival proof of the big stakes and connected thrills.</p>
<p>Procter also took the opportunity to wish Stacy “huge congratulations” while expressing pride for having created a tool that can bring next-level engagement to casino operators while letting players enjoy life-changing rewards.</p>
<p>In February, Caesars announced it would extend its Caesars Rewards program to New York merchants.</p>
