    <h1>Doubleu Casino Free Chips Update Lucky Eagle Casino Hotel Toppenish Casino M Resort Casino Gold Coun</h1>

<p>Kalamba Games, a respected and innovative developer of iGaming content, has signed a landmark content partnership with Pariplay, a fellow developer and provider of aggregation solutions for the sector. Thanks to this new partnership, Pariplay will be able to leverage its aggregation platform and feature premium quality titles by Kalamba moving forward.</p>
<p>The partnership is facilitated through the Ignite development program and marks an important success for both participants. Kalamba Games will clearly benefit from this opportunity as it will have a much better reach across international markets and strengthen its own position with Pariplay’s network of partners, which features some of the most prominent names and developers in the industry. The partnership was naturally welcomed by Kalamba Games CCO Andrew Crosby who said that the opportunity to team up with the renowned aggregator was excellent.</p>
<p>He noted that the company was very pleased with the fact that it will indeed be expanding its reach in markets that it finds valuable and worth adding to, mentioning North America, Romania, and South America. "We’re confident that our content will resonate with more players than ever as a result," Crosby explained.</p>
<p>The titles offered to Pariplay partners via the aggregation platform feature some signature-style games that have helped build Kalamba’s image and reputation as a top-tier developer of iGaming solutions. Another thing operators have to look forward to is the Phat Cats Megaways title that will be launching shortly, the companies shared in a press release. Pariplay Director of Partnerships Callum Harris was stoked at the opportunity to have these titles added.</p>
<p>"We’re looking forward to maximum coverage immediately on launch, leveraging our regulated network and proven technologies. Kalamba’s content is a fantastic addition for our operator partners," Harris said.</p>
<p>Pariplay is serious about making its presence felt and so is Kalamba. Kalamba now has the opportunity to seek and reach more players in some of Pariplay’s main jurisdictions, including Greece, Romania, Portugal, the United States, the United Kingdom, Italy and so many other worthwhile markets that will no doubt appeal to both companies.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Pariplay has had a string of successful business moves. The company recently appointed Linda Sliede as its Head of Account Management. The company also secured a license to enter as a supplier in Connecticut, another important market in the United States that is linked to iGaming and the rapid expansion of the activity in the North American market.</p>
