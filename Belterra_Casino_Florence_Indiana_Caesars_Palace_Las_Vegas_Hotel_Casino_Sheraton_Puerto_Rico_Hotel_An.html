<p>This places NOVOMATIC among the top 30% of electronics companies</p>
<p>ISS ESG, a sustainability rating agency, has updated NOVOMATIC’s sustainability rating to C, marking it as one of the best companies within the electronics industry.</p>
<p>ISS ESG, which is one of the best sustainability experts along with Sustainalytics and Moody’s ESG Solutions, assessed Novomatic’s business, examining its environmental, economic and social performance. As usual, ISS ESG formed its rating based on approximately 100 industry-specific markers.</p>
<p>In October, ISS ESG upgraded NOVOMATIC’s rating to C. This places NOVOMATIC among the top 30% of electronics companies, aligning it with the likes of Apple, Dell and Hewlett-Packard.</p>
<p>NOVOMATIC reported that its business made significant headways in a number of areas, including the following:</p>
<p>Employees and suppliers</p>
<p>Society and product responsibility</p>
<p>Corporate governance and business ethics</p>
<p>Sustainability Means a Lot to NOVOMATIC</p>
<p>NOVOMATIC addressed the matter, saying that ESG is an integral part of its corporate strategy. The company noted that it remains bullish on making continuous improvements as part of its comprehensive sustainability program.</p>
<p>NOVOMATIC board member Ryszard Presch echoed this sentiment, saying:</p>
<p>As an international gaming technology group, we have always assumed social responsibility and act conscientiously and transparently in all areas of our business. Ryszard Presch, board member, NOVOMATIC</p>
<p>Johannes Gratzl, another board member, thanked ISS ESG for its recognition. He praised the top rating, highlighting its importance to the company.</p>
<p>With this rating, we have made a great leap forward, and our level of transparency is now at the highest level. We are also well above the industry average when it comes to the core issue of working conditions and standards. Johannes Gratzl, board member, NOVOMATIC</p>
<p>This is not the first time NOVOMATIC’s sustainability efforts have been recognized. Previously, NOVOMATIC emerged as the industry winner of PwC’s ESG Ranking 2023.</p>
<p>In September, NOVOMATIC published its H1 results, reporting strong growth across multiple metrics. The company’s EBITDA increased in all markets where it operates, highlighting the strength of its business.</p>
