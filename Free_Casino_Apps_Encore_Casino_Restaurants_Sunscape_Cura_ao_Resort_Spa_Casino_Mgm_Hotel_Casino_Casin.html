<p>Vontaze Burfict just wanted some pizza while in Las Vegas over the weekend. Well, not just some pizza. This secret pizza is located in a hidden corner of Vegas’ Cosmopolitan.</p>

<p>The former Cincinnati Bengals linebacker, who earned a reputation and several suspensions for dirty hits on the field, was arrested Saturday morning at The Cosmopolitan. According to TMZ, Burfict and his group searched for a pizza place. While unsuccessful in their search, they accused casino security of tailing them.</p>
<p>Pleasantries were exchanged, and the guards alleged Burfict hit one of them. Hopefully, it wasn’t like the hit he laid on Antonio Brown nearly five years ago.</p>
<p>Las Vegas Metro Police arrived and arrested Burfict. He now faces a misdemeanor battery charge.</p>
<p>Burfict signed with the Bengals as an undrafted free agent in 2012. He played seven seasons for them through 2018. He signed with the Oakland Raiders last year, but he drew a 12-game suspension for another helmet-to-helmet hit. According to SBNation, Burfict has drawn fines totaling more than $4.5 million in his playing career.</p>
<p>He did not hang on with the Raiders after they moved to Sin City. The 30-year-old is an unsigned free agent.</p>
<p>What is Secret Pizza??</p>
<p>So, about that pizza place. The Cosmopolitan has a joint called Secret Pizza. It’s hidden somewhere on the third floor of the hotel. It’s so secretive, it’s not even mentioned on the Cosmopolitan website, and there’s no signage indicating the entry.</p>
<p>Supposedly, it’s easier to get to Hogwarts than it is this place.</p>
<p>It’s like a speakeasy for pizza — a hidden eatery located at an unmarked location on the Cosmo property,” TMZ reported.</p>
<p>Apparently, Secret Pizza is a love-it-or-hate-it kind of place. There is no in-between.</p>

<p>Cosmopolitan Increased Security in Recent Weeks</p>
<p>As a rash of violent activity has broken out across the Las Vegas Strip, The Cosmopolitan like other casino resorts has taken additional steps in recent months to bolster security.</p>
<p>Among the steps now in effect at the resort is restricting entry on Friday and Saturday nights to individuals with hotel or restaurant reservations, or who belong to the casino’s rewards program.</p>
<p>The casino also stations Las Vegas police officers at key entry points. In addition, it checks guests and their bags before they can enter.</p>
<p>And The Cosmopolitan has had its share of controversies with minority celebrities and athletes. Last year, rapper Meek Mill claimed the resort went “to extreme racist levels” after refusing him to attend another rapper’s concert there. The casino subsequently issued an apology via social media.</p>
<p>Nevada gaming officials arrested former NBA star Charles Oakley at The Cosmopolitan two and a half years ago, accusing him initially of attempting to cheat. He eventually pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of disorderly conduct and paid a $1,000 fine.</p>
<p>Former Teammate Busted Last Year at Indiana Casino</p>
<p>Burfict isn’t the only former Bengal accused of a run-in at a casino.</p>
<p>Last year, Burfict’s former teammate Adam ‘Pacman’ Jones was arrested at the Rising Star Casino just outside of Cincinnati. In the incident, he was confronted by Indiana Gaming Commission officials, who were alerted of a player possibly cheating at a table game. He allegedly threatened to kill an IGC official.</p>
<p>Jones eventually pleaded guilty to lesser charges. A judge sentenced him to two weeks in the local jail.</p>
