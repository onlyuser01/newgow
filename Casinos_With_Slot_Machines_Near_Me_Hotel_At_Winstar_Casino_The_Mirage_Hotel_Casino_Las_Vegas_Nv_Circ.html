<p>The deal is expected to grow Blexr and help it expand its portfolio and business-to-business product offering</p>
<p>Top-performing marketing company Blexr has reinforced its business through the acquisition of The Players Online Gambling Guide (ThePOGG), a British affiliate site. The former company noted that the new deal will help it expand its portfolio and business-to-business products.</p>
<p>We’re thrilled to announce that we’ve acquired this top-rated UK-based website and premium alternative dispute resolution (ADR) service to expand our portfolio and B2B offering. Blexr announcement</p>
<p>ThePOGG specializes in reviews of online casinos and provides its visitors with information about different gambling brands. Users can also find comparisons between iGaming sites, helping them to pick the best one for their preferences.</p>
<p>In addition to reviews, ThePOGG also provides alternative dispute resolution, allowing gambling companies to settle disputes through ThePOGG.</p>
<p>The financial aspect of the deal was briefly mentioned with Blexr saying that the purchase cost it a six-figure sum. However, the marketing company refrained from disclosing the exact number.</p>
<p>The Acquisition Will Reinforce Blexr’s Business</p>
<p>ThePOGG was founded in 2011 by Duncan Garvie, a former mathematics teacher. At the time, the iGaming industry was still immature and mostly unregulated. ThePOGG took it upon itself to help players navigate this chaotic landscape and help them find the best online casinos. The affiliate helped a myriad of players find gaming brands that are fair and support customers when disputes arise.</p>
<p>When the online gambling sector became more regulated, ThePOGG adapted accordingly while continuing to provide players with trustworthy reviews of iGaming brands.</p>
<p>Garvie addressed the new deal, saying that he feels very proud to join Blexr. ThePOGG’s founder noted that his team has worked very hard to provide exceptional service to its clients over the last decade and has developed the highest standards in the industry.</p>
<p>I’m really happy to be joining an organization that shares that same commitment. Duncan Garvie, founder, ThePOGG</p>
<p>Paudie O’Reilly, Blexr’s founder and chief executive officer, said that the new acquisition will help the affiliate grow its business. He said that the acquisition of ThePOGG will be a great addition to his team’s existing product portfolio.</p>
<p>O’Reilly praised the hard work of Garvie and his team, lauding ThePOGG as a trusted service that is “second to none.” The current acquisition, O’Reilly said, represents an enormous opportunity for his team to further grow and develop ThePOGG.</p>
<p>O’Reilly teased that his team has big plans for the iGaming space and cannot wait to see how it will grow in the next few months.</p>
