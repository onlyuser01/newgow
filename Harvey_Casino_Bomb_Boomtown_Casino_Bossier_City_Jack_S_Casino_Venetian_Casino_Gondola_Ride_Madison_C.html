<p>The race for the NASCAR Cup Series continues with the Federated Auto Parts 400, and a bunch of contenders is coming in hot into the Saturday race. Held on September 11 at the Richmond Motor Speedway, the race will pit the likes of Kyle Busch, Joey Logano, and Martin Truex Jr. against each other once again. The odds between them are slim enough to make this a difficult call.</p>
<p>This is even more so when you consider that the Cook Out Southern 500 turned out completely unexpected with Denny Hamlin making it out first of the race with 57 points. Originally, it was thought that Kyle Larson would win with Hamlin given the fifth-best chance of succeeding.</p>
<p>Overall, though, Larson continues to be in the lead in the standings with 2106 but the gap is closing in.</p>

<p>Where and When to Watch Federated Auto Parts 400</p>

<p>Martin Truex Jr. Leads the Way by Sliver</p>
<p>Richmond is traditionally a much-contested raceway. The 0.75-mile motor speedway will definitely present some challenges to all drivers. As to Truex Jr., he has been historically doing well on this raceway. He hasn’t won many times, but he seems to be almost always in the first top-five finishes and it’s this consistency that gives him a great foothold.</p>
<p>He has also been one of the best drivers to have been able and lead most of the laps at Richmond, although not necessarily winning. Posted at (+400) he’s a toss-up for a winner with both Hamlin (+500) and Logano (+700).</p>
<p>Truex Jr. will start third behind Hamlin who will be second and Kyle Larson who will be in the lead. Kurt Busch is fourth and Kevin Harvick is coming in fifth. We believe Truex Jr.’s advantage is not allocated by chance, as he posted a consistently good performance in the track and is tipped to make a big showing on Saturday.</p>
<p>Kyle Busch and Keselowski to Look out For?</p>
<p>Kyle Busch has slipped a little in the overall standings and he added insult to injury when he crashed last week and was subsequently fined $50,000. His generally irritable attitude has not helped argue his case.</p>
<p>Yet, Busch is posted at good (+700) for the upcoming race and he definitely needs a win to shoot up through the NASCAR Cup Series standings once again. Currently starting at 15th position in Richmond, the younger of the two Busch will have to remain composed and show what he has got.</p>
<p>Then you have Keselowski who claimed Richmond last year. He is currently 8th in the overall standings with 2038 points and a win can really help him get closer to the top. He finished 7th at the Cook Out Southern 500 but ended up 34th as he couldn’t finish during the Coke Zero Sugar 400. Keselowski is a long shot here as he seems to be capable of being among the Top 10 drivers but not able to push much beyond that. Yet, he is a good long shot at (+1000).</p>
