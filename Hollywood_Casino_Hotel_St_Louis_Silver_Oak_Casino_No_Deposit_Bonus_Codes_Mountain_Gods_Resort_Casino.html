    <h1>Hollywood Casino Hotel St Louis Silver Oak Casino No Deposit Bonus Codes Mountain Gods Resort Casino</h1>

<p>I was playing at Iwild with a bonus.....the moment when the bonus conditions were fulfilled, I was at about €500-700 (at that moment the balance should have been reduced if at all)...so after the bonus conditions were met, I won another €1200, thus bringing my total to €1900.</p>
<p>I requested a payout, of course, I had to send some documents multiple times via email.... and just before I finally get the verification confirmation, I receive an email stating that from the €1200, a total of €1050 will be deducted, as the maximum payable amount from the bonus would be €150......the bonus conditions have already been met and the €1200 was won afterwards.</p>
<p>If the bonus conditions were fulfilled while €700 was in the account....how can they deduct more money from me afterwards (that I won with supposedly "withdrawable" money) than I won in the bonus....</p>
<p>The casino could then deduct money from me months later after a turnover of €50000 outside of the bonus conditions, as has happened in this case.</p>
<p>According to my lawyer, this is a scam, as I was no longer operating within any bonus conditions.</p>
<p>The support team has not responded to my emails for days.</p>
