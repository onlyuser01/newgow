    <h1>Resort World Casino In Queens New York Soaring Eagles Casino Tampa Hardrock Casino The Point Casino</h1>

<p>One of the world’s leading testing gaming labs has made a new appointment at the top, bringing Mario Zilevski in a new SVP role</p>
<p>BMM Testlabs Australia, which is a leader in the provision of certification services for gaming companies, has brought in Zilevski as its latest SVP of client services. In his new role, he will work directly with the EVP and general manager for the APACAF region.</p>
<p>Strengthening Client Services and Technical Understanding</p>
<p>The appointment will see the seasoned specialist join Kirk White’s team, who serves as the EVP and GM for APACAF and help advance BMM’s standing as a leader in the provision of outstanding services for partners.</p>
<p>He hailed Zilevski’s experience and knowledge of the industry and what he brought to the table, commending the man as an established industry specialist. Zilevski’s strong qualities include a deeper understanding of the technical side of the business as well as a good rapport with clients.</p>
<p>“Mario is exceptionally qualified to provide guidance and support to our clients, and his promotion to Senior Vice President of Client Services is well deserved,” White said, hailing the new addition.</p>
<p>The man was excited about the opportunity to be a part of BMM Australia’s team and increase his responsibilities within the company’s structure. He mentioned that he has been working with the company from various global offices over the past years and has accumulated important in-depth technical knowledge that spans numerous international markets and customer engagement models.</p>
<p>Zilevski Has More Than Two Decades of Industry Experience</p>
<p>This knowledge can now be put to good use as part of his new position within the company. Zilevski’s journey with the company has been a long one. He joined in 2000 when the company was still starting out and has spent the last 20+ years working at BMM and helping advance industry standards for safety and responsibility.</p>
<p>The company previously promoted Rubén Baptista to EURSAM SVP of operations. BMM Testlabs has also been expanding its North American footprint. Presently, the company is focused on strengthening both its geographical footprint through license acquisition in individual jurisdictions in North America as well as with the addition of qualified and trusted members of staff.</p>
