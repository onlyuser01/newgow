<p>Gaming Laboratories International (GLI) has successfully audited three of Vivo Gaming’s studios, allowing it to sell its accredited goods to the Isle of Man Gambling Supervisory Commission (GSC) licensees and further expand its controlled business footprint.</p>
<p>Vivo Gaming Is Scheduled to Launch First Isle of Man-based Operator in Near Future</p>
<p>Vivo Gaming is expected to go live with its first Isle of Man-based operator, Ableton Prestige Global, following a successful audit, which will see the supplier integrate its solution with the Europe and Asia-facing operator.</p>
<p>GLI offers high-quality testing and auditing services to suppliers, operators, and regulators, allowing them to confidently meet or exceed regulatory requirements.</p>
<p>Vivo Gaming’s studios in LatAm (Colombia), Europe (Bulgaria), and Asia were thoroughly audited by GLI, a GSC-approved independent test lab. The Live Studio Audit was conducted with the aim of finding any real or possible instances of lack of compliance, vulnerabilities, or weaknesses, as well as ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data under Vivo Gaming’s control.</p>
<p>Following the satisfactory completion of the audit, GLI will be able to work with an increasing number of Isle of Man licensees. In full, the leading provider has more than 60 live dealer tables in service across three continents, serving 150 customers and streaming in Asian, Latin American, and European styles 24 hours a day, seven days a week.</p>
<p>Baccarat, blackjack, roulette, poker, and Dragon Tiger are only a few of the games available, many of which come in more than 27 languages and 178 currencies, including several cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>Isle of Man, Colombia, and GLI 19 Standards Compliance to Boost Vivo Gaming Offer</p>
<p>With the opportunity to supply its live casino services through Colombian and Argentinian markets, Vivo Gaming is expected to gain even more from the Isle of Man, Colombia, and GLI 19 standards enforcement.</p>
<p>Last December, FSB received GLI 33 certification from Gaming Laboratories International for its sports wagering offering after passing a pre-compliance product test against the GLI 33 Event Wagering System’s requirements.</p>
<p>The Isle of Man is one of the world’s most well-established and rapidly expanding managed jurisdictions. In March, the GSC processed the largest number of new licenses it has ever processed (55), a 30% improvement over the previous year.</p>
<p>Head of account management at Vivo Gaming, Nadine Thys, said: “We are delighted to have successfully completed the audit process of three of our studios with flying colors. This allows us to open the first regulated live casino offering on the Isle of Man, which is a huge milestone for us as a company and will take us to the next level as we rapidly grow our regulated footprint.”</p>
<p>Thys further stated that The Isle of Man is experiencing rapid growth, and she is confident that Vivo Gaming’s exciting bundle of globally focused content will appeal to all of the company’s new customers.</p>
<p>Vice President of Sales at EMEA at GLI, James Illingworth, said that GLI understands that this is an exciting moment for Vivo Gaming and its Live Dealer businesses.</p>
<p>Vivo Gaming’s team was found to be supportive and competent during the thorough audit procedures, and the organization enjoyed working with them. GLI hopes that this will be the first step toward further development for both Vivo Gaming and the Isle of Man’s jurisdiction and that GLI will be able to continue to help both.</p>
