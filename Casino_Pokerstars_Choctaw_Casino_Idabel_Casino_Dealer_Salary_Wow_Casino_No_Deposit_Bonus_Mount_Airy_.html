    <h1>Casino Pokerstars Choctaw Casino Idabel Casino Dealer Salary Wow Casino No Deposit Bonus Mount Airy</h1>

<p>Nederlandse Loterij betting and gaming brands TOTO Sport and TOTO Casino have teamed up with Trustly, a prominent payout solution provider, to enhance the banking experience at the websites and ensure that customers are having a streamlined process from start to finish.</p>
<p>The payment solution deployed with the two websites covers Trustly’s instant payout options which will make it easier for players to withdraw their funds and further strengthen TOTO Sport and TOTO Casino’s ability to engage and retain customers, enhance loyalty and overall deliver on experiences that players enjoy.</p>
<p>Based on official data provided by the payment specialist as part of the official press release announcing the deal, eight out of 10 players who use Trustly confirm that fast payouts are important when it comes to choosing an online sportsbook or casino.</p>
<p>Commenting on this new opportunity, Trustly VP of Gaming Vasilije Lekovic welcomed the chance to see the company partner up with both TOTO Sport and TOTO Casino and once again demonstrate that Trustly is indeed one of the best payment solutions in the Dutch iGaming market.</p>
<p>"Our unparalleled instant payout product, in combination with the rest of our open banking payment offering in the Netherlands, has established Trustly as the partner of choice for multiple operators in this market and we’re very excited that TOTO, one of the market leaders, has joined that group," Lekovic said, adding that the company was now looking forward to seeing how the partnership progresses and how TOTO’s audiences receive the payment solution.</p>
<p>Nederlandse Loterij CFO Arjan Blok was similarly pleased with the opportunity to welcome an established payment provider such as Trustly. He argued that players in the Netherlands were already familiar with and actively seeking out instant payments that considerably strengthen their enjoyment of the experience.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the Netherlands has been a very active market in Europe. The newly-regulated jurisdiction has seen interest from dozens if not hundreds of suppliers and operators that have sought to quickly establish a footprint in the region and deploy their brands.</p>
<p>The Netherlands’ rather stricter regulator framework has not dissuaded companies from seeking to obtain licenses and operate in the market either. Now, Trustly can provide market-leading solutions for two new local partners, benefiting both the payment company as well as the local brands.</p>
