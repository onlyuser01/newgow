<p>Esports and mobile gaming company Skillz Inc. has hired Orrick Herrington &amp; Sutcliffe partner Nicholas Green to spearhead the company’s public policy. This most likely reflects on the company’s broader ambitions to pursue new verticals within the regulated gaming and betting landscape in the United States.</p>
<p>Orrick Joins Skillz to Help with Public Policy</p>
<p>As part of Orrick, Green worked on sports laws and assisted with the legalization of sports betting across numerous US states. His appointment dates to January 24 and has been confirmed by Bloomberg Law.</p>
<p>Skillz has made a name for itself over the past years. It has been able to pay out seven-figure prizes to its most talented players who play titles such as Solitaire Cube and Jewel Blitz for a chance to top the rank lists and earn a hefty payout.</p>
<p>The company was founded in 2012 and has received backing from numerous essential investors, including the National Football League’s venture capital division, 32 Equity.</p>
<p>Bloomberg looked into a job positing that supposedly led to Green’s hire. The company claims that the gaming industry is set to outstrip any other form of entertainment, whether this is cinema, music, or books. It has already happened, the posting reads.</p>
<p>Skillz Doubles Down on Legal Hires</p>
<p>Green’s expertise encompasses stints at various companies, either as a direct employee or as an advisor. He has previously provided outside counsel to Skillz on a variety of matters. Green is working directly under the VP of legal, Charlotte Edelman.</p>
<p>Skillz has been actively looking to hire more lawyers, seeking to better comply with the fast-evolving landscape of gaming and betting regulation. The company has plucked top talent from IBM, bringing Natalie Wilmore as head of corporate and securities. It has also invited Dalar Abolian as associate counsel from Los Angeles-based Yo Mohandesi.</p>
<p>Skillz has also been paying attention to the esports industry, as it acquired Aarki in a $150 million deal last summer.</p>
