    <h1>Alina Casino Casino Theme Cake Casino Chukchansi Lakeside Casino Epiphone Casino Zombie Carnival Fre</h1>

<p>Zombie Carnival review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Zombie Carnival is themed around a ghoulish troupe of entertainers.</p>
<p>Players will step into a colorful carnival filled with lights, candy, and rides. However, things are not quite as they seem in this fantasy world, and soon the undead are running the show.</p>
<p>Fans of horror will appreciate the macabre vibe of this slot, and those looking for a cheerful atmosphere will not be disappointed either.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The eerie soundtrack is filled with haunting bird calls and tension-inducing notes. Players will feel immediately drawn into the world of this creepy carnival.</p>
<p>The whimsically unsettling animation may remind players of Tim Burton films. The carnies are all zombies with bulging red eyes and devious smiles. A green-haired clown is especially striking as he nearly bursts out of his reel.</p>
<p>Letters also appear among the symbols in shades of blue, green, and red. Each letter nods to a carnival game with balls, mallets, and canons.</p>
<p>Beyond the reels, players will see a brightly-hued carnival scene with striped tents and fireworks exploding above. It’s fun to imagine how shocked the fair-goers would be to enter this contradictory realm of death and fun.</p>
<p>Together, the soundtrack and graphics create a creative combination of dark and lighthearted aesthetics.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Zombie Carnival is a six-reel, four-row slot.</p>
<p>Wins are awarded for landing matching symbols in adjacent reels, starting from the leftmost reel and going towards the rightmost.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Scatter symbol appears on reels 2, 3, 4, and 5. When players land 2 or more Scatter symbols, the Free Spins feature begins, starting with 6 free spins. Special reels are used for this feature.</p>
<p>When the Free Spins feature begins, the Scatters that triggered the feature transform into Wilds and remain on the reels for the duration of the feature.</p>
<p>Whenever additional Scatters land during the feature, players will be awarded an additional free spin. The Scatters will then be engulfed by the Wilds and contribute to the Wilds’ multiplier.</p>
<p>If more than one Wild is included in a win, their multipliers are added together before being applied to the winnings.</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all regular symbols and only appears during the Free Spins feature.</p>
<p>There is also a Mystery symbol which transforms into a randomly selected symbol whenever they appear during the base game and the Free Spins feature.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of Zombie Carnival is 96.50%, nicely above our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.20 up to a maximum of $/£/€100 per spin.</p>

<p>Conclusion</p>

<p>With an impressive RTP and sky high volatility, Zombie Carnival is a great find for mathematically-inclined players.</p>
<p>The unique animation, attention-grabbing theme, and bonus features add even more fun to this engaging slot.</p>
