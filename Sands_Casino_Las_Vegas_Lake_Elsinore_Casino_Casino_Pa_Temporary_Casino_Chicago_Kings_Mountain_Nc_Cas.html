<p>Eye of Horus Megaways review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Hieroglyphics and a gloomy temple setting immediately catapult this slot into the generic obscurity of dozens of other Ancient Egyptian slot machines.</p>
<p>It doesn’t bring much new to the table. No modern adventurers dead set on tomb raiding. No artistic flourishes to the hieroglyph designs. In fact, it seems to have taken away many of the things that make Egyptian slots interesting to look at.</p>
<p>When a theme is done as many times as this one, you need to try harder than Eye of Horus Megaways to stand out.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>Unusually for a maker that has sprung for the license on the Megaways system, the graphics on this slot are pretty unimpressive. Decent, but unimaginative, renderings of Egyptian images.</p>
<p>The animations are perfectly acceptable, but lack flare and character. Which is also true of the soundtrack. The win and spin sounds appear to have been grandfathered in from other BluePrint Gaming slots and are utterly without atmosphere or style.</p>
<p>This like of customisation can work with some themes, but in an Ancient Egyptian slot such things contrast with the tone of the game and end up throwing the player off.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>The Megaways system comes from Big Time Gaming. This system randomises the number of symbols on each reel every spin. It also uses an any way wins system where wins are counted from left to right starting on reel one, regardless of where on the reels the matching symbols land.</p>
<p>The number of win ways changes spin to spin. Though it is always between a minimum of 64 (two symbols per reel) and a maximum of 15,625 (for five symbols on each reel).</p>
<p>The free spin bonus has some fun "upgrades" built into it (see below for details). All in all this adds up to some quality gameplay that makes up somewhat for the slots many other failings.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter symbol. When a Wild lands, it expands to fill its entire reel.</p>
<p>Three or more Scatters trigger twelve free spins.</p>
<p>During the Free Spins, each Wild that lands on any reel adds an upgrade tablet for the remaining spins. The first upgrade tablet turns all of the lowest paying symbols into the second lowest paying symbols. The second upgrade upgrades them all to the third lowest. Etc...</p>
<p>Wins are going up with each wild symbol hit and following an upgrade</p>
<p>Additionally, each Wild that lands awards the player more spins. One spin for one Wild. Two Wilds in the same spin add three spins to the player's total. Three Wilds at once add five spins. And four Wilds add seven.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 95.49%, coming in well under our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.10 up to a maximum of $/£/€10.00 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is medium, which makes it a poor match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility. Coupled with a low RTP, this excludes this slot from getting our recommendation.</p>
<p>Full paytable for Eye of Horus Megaways slot</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>If bland theme and visuals, with borrowed sound effects and animations do little to enamour us with this slot – then the low RTP and medium volatility hammer the nails into the slot’s sarcophagus.</p>
<p>Some solid gameplay mechanics and a good bonus game are not enough to make up for that.</p>
<p>It should be noted that, although we do not recommend this slot, it has proved popular. So be aware that your mileage may vary.</p>
