<p>Join the Zombie Infestation</p>
<p>Avatar UX’s new game presented by Yggdrasil Gaming features a 5-reel, 4-row layout with as many as 6,250 pay lines. The game has been nicely designed with the apocalypse theme in mind, with plenty of horror and Halloween-inspired elements that portray a world infested by frightening zombies lurking around. As one of the few survivors, your main goal is to run away from the undead while watching them grow with the help of a Multiplier via the special MultiPop game mechanic.</p>
<p>Free Spins and Multipliers</p>
<p>To trigger the Free Spins Bonus Round, players must come across a minimum of three brain scatter symbols. This will instantly change the grid into a 5×5 one while locking it for the entire duration of the bonus round. During the Free Spins bonus round, players can fill up the board with Multipliers and gain even more free spins thanks to the Multiplier that will keep growing between. The maximum a multiplier can reach during this round is 10x. When all reels are packed with multipliers, players receive two more free spins.</p>
<p>With the help of the MultiPop feature, players also get to witness a series of Winning Combinations with the upcoming symbol on the respective position receiving a multiplier. Hitting a progressive win on the same symbol slot will boost the value of the multiplier for the same spin cycle. The game that pays both ways can bring players a maximum win of up to 20,000x. During the base game, gamers can take advantage of the infectious multipliers popping up whenever a maximum multiplier is revealed. When this happens, between four and 12 cells receive an automatic upgrade with an extra 1x multiplier.</p>
<p>The Gamble Wheel</p>
<p>Prior to entering the Free Spins bonus round, players can try their luck at the gamble wheel. Here, they can potentially grab even more Free Spins, depending on their luck. In some jurisdictions, players are allowed to use two bonus buy options. AvatarUX’s game is powered by Yggdrasil’s GATI technology similar to RagingPop, a savannah-themed slot released in August.</p>
<p>Yggdrasil’s head of company Stuart McCarthy praised AvatarUX’s desire to keep innovating and creating “exciting content.” He further explained how the “forward-thinking brand” has once again “pushed the envelope” with Zombie aPOPalypse, a pioneer slot introducing the fresh MultiPop game mechanic for the first time.</p>
<p>AvaratUX’s chief executive officer Nicola Longmuir emphasized their excitement regarding the launch of the new game that has allowed them to take their portfolio further with fresh game features and mechanics.</p>
