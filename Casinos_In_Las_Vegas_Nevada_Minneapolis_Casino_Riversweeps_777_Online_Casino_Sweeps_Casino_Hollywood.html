    <h1>Casinos In Las Vegas Nevada Minneapolis Casino Riversweeps 777 Online Casino Sweeps Casino Hollywood</h1>

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>I have problems with 1XBET casino!</p>
<p>I'll tell you about everything in order.</p>
<p>On November 19, I sent a photo of my passport to the casino.</p>
<p>On November 21, at the amended request of the casino, I sent a photo of pages No. 1,2,3,11 of the passport.</p>
<p>On November 22, I sent screenshots of the Neteller profile, the last deposits from the payment wallet, a screenshot of verification, a screenshot of the payment cards section to the casino.</p>
<p>On November 23, I sent a selfie with a passport in my hands against the background of correspondence with the casino security service.</p>
<p>On November 24, I was unable to log into my account due to its blocking. The casino did not provide any explanation. I did not receive a response from the casino to my questions regarding the reasons for the blocking. The casino indicated the need to follow the instructions to unlock the account.</p>
<p>On November 30, I filled out a questionnaire in my personal account and sent a screenshot of the deposit, as requested by the casino.</p>
<p>On December 08, at the request of the casino, I uploaded a screenshot of the payment wallet, a screenshot of the last deposits, as well as a screenshot with received winnings from other casinos to my account (these funds were used to deposit at the 1XBET casino).</p>
<p>On December 12, the casino requested the provision of documents: a notarized copy of the passport, screenshots of the payment wallet by mail. I mailed these documents as soon as possible.</p>
<p>On March 11, a photo was sent with a sheet of paper with the specified code and the current date.</p>
<p>I also passed the video verification via Skype.</p>
<p>Later, the casino accused me of violations, BUT no evidence of my guilt was provided.</p>
<p>The casino gave me the option to withdraw my deposit, but they confiscated $630.</p>
<p>I need your help in resolving a dispute with a casino.</p>
