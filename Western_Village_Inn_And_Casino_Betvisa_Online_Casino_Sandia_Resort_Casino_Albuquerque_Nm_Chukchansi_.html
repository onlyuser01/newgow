    <h1>Western Village Inn And Casino Betvisa Online Casino Sandia Resort Casino Albuquerque Nm Chukchansi</h1>

<p>The leading multi-channel supplier of live betting services, Sports Information Services (SIS), announced it boosted its existing long-term deal with the leading operator bet365. Under the terms of the latest collaboration, SIS delivered a new product for the leading operator.</p>
<p>The new live lottery product is called Lotto365. For the development of the product, SIS selected its 49's Live Numbers brand. Now, thanks to Lotto365, bet365 further extends its offering by delivering an innovative lottery product. At the same time, the operator benefits from reaffirming its leadership position within the growing online betting vertical.</p>
<p>In a statement released on January 4, 2023, a spokesperson for bet365 explained that Lotto365 further extends the quality offering of the company. "It's a key product for many bettors within the bet365 group, and this new offering will be highly appealing," added the spokesperson.</p>
<p>Finally, the company acknowledged: "SIS and 49's have a long history of producing best-in-class lottery content and SIS were the partner of choice to support the development of Lotto365."</p>
<p>Jessica Mills, SIS' Head of Product Proposition, added that the company is delighted to boost its existing partnership with bet365 and deliver a new product. "Our 49's Product team have worked very hard to support the creation and development of Lotto365," she explained.</p>
<p>According to Mills, Lotto365 is a testament to the quality and reliability of the company's 49's portfolio. Moreover, she explained that SIS has been delivering live-draw games for more than 25 years. "It's been a real team effort with bet365 throughout this project and we're confident that the product will attract a wider audience of players," said Mills in conclusion.</p>
<p>Lotto365 brings unique live action for the players 23 hours every day with a live draw every five minutes. The new live draw game is streamed from its broadcast studios located in Milton Keynes. According to SIS, the new five out of 36 format of the game grants players a chance to win up to £100,000 from betting as little as £1, given that all five numbers are guessed correctly. Besides major prizes, Lotto365 offers many smaller prizes for players that have only a single matching ball.</p>
<p>In addition to betting on numbers, the live draw game grants players a variety of betting markets enabling them to wager on the colors of the balls which are drawn. Just like the colors from bet365's current branding, bettors can wager on yellow, white and green.</p>
<p>Players who place wagers on Lotto365 can see the live results on 49s.co.uk. Although initially, the new draw game launched in English, SIS explained that soon, it will be streamed in other languages as well.</p>
