    <h1>Mgm Springfield Casino Rohnert Park Casino Triple Crown Casinos Edgewater Hotel Casino Suncoast Casi</h1>

<p>The correct disputed amount is 15 mBTC =~ 0.015 BTC</p>
<p>I was sent an email promotion from the operator offering a certain amount of free spins from the game provider Platypus depending on the deposit amount (Figure 1). So, I decided to make a deposit (Figure 2) and received 22 free spins in accordance with the Bonus Terms &amp; Conditions (Figure 3). As you can see in my bets history (Figure 4), I decided to play with my account balance first in a game named "Muerto En Mictlan" and saved the 22 free spins from Platypus for later in the case that I win so that I would be able to cash out immediately without being tied down to a bonus. Unfortunately, I had lost all of my deposit amount and was left with the 22 free spins in my account. I had selected the game "Book of Light" by Platypus to play my 22 free spins in. The total amount that I had won from the free spins is 0.0007 BTC according to the operator's support staff via our email conversation (Figure 5) as these spins were suspiciously left out from my bet history that I had requested shortly after the incident. With the 0.0007 BTC winnings coming from the Platypus free spins, I decided to try my luck in the game named "Big Heist" by Booongo and ended my session from the game "Book of Light". My account balance went up to 0.01969482 BTC while winning in the game Big Heist when suddenly, I saw my balance drop to 0.005 BTC without doing anything. So, I immediately contacted their support through chat and email (Figure 5) and the operator along with its support staff keeps insisting that the cause of confiscation of approximately 0.01464482 BTC was that I had gone over the maximum win amount of 0.005 BTC according to their bonus T&amp;C (Figure 3). Completely baffled with the reason given as the amount I had won from the Bonus free spins is 0.0007 BTC, I reviewed the Terms and Conditions of the bonus and there it states:</p>
<p>"The maximum winning from</p>
<p>22 FS is 0.005 BTC / 0.1 ETH / 0.9 BCH / 2 LTC / 1700 DOG / 100 USDT / 330 XRP / 1000</p>
<p>ТRХ / 230 ADA / 0.5 BNB...."</p>
<p>In this clause it states the restriction win amount and where the amount is to be enforced the restriction on which is from the 22 free spins. Their support keeps insisting (Figure 5) that the clause states "The maximum winning from 22 FS and all winnings derived from it while the wagering requirement is unsatisfied is 0.005 BTC...." but that's not what's stated in their T&amp;C. I have tried for a whole week to reason to their support staff and make them understand this with no avail so now I ask of your help in recovering the unrightfully confiscated amount of 0.015 BTC back to my account available for immediate withdrawal as I had finished the wagering requirements for the 0.0007 BTC I had won from the Platypus free spins.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time and consideration and I'm looking forward to your feedback.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Chester</p>
