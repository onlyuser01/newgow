    <h1>Hollywood Casino At Greektown Casinos Council Bluff Iowa 777 Casino Drive Cherokee Nc 28719 Arizona</h1>

<p>The leading betting and gaming operator, NetBet, announced it forged a new partnership, allowing it to grow its offering for customers in Greece. On Monday, the company revealed it joined forces with IGT's award-winning digital iGaming products provider, IGT PlayDigital. Under the terms of the new content agreement, IGT PlayDigital agreed to supply its games expanding the offering of NetBet for customers in Greece.</p>
<p>The latest collaboration expands the iGaming operator's offering, delivering thrilling and engaging games from the leading iGaming content supplier. NetBet confirmed that the new content agreement helps strengthen its offering and complements its commitment to providing legal, safe and responsible forms of entertainment for its growing customer base.</p>
<p>Claudia Georgevici, NetBet Greece's Public Relations Manager, was excited about the freshly minted agreement with IGT PlayDigital. In a statement, she explained: "We are delighted to announce our content partnership with IGT PlayDigital and offer the company's excellent services and high-performing games to our players in Greece." Finally, Georgevici said: "It is our simultaneous commitment to ensure that our customers play responsibly while having fun in a safe and secure environment."</p>
<p>Under the terms of the new content agreement, NetBet's players in Greece will be able to access top-performing games from IGT PlayDigital. Such include Cleopatra, as well as Cash Eruption, among other player-favorite and engaging titles from the renowned iGaming content provider. Undoubtedly, the deal will help boost the strong position NetBet already holds within the market while at the same time expanding the reach of IGT PlayDigital's games to new players.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, NetBet boosted its gaming portfolio via a partnership with Revolver, a fast-growing provider of games for the online gambling sector. Under the terms of that agreement, the iGaming content provider agreed to deliver its fan-favorite games for NetBet Casino, powering its offering in different markets.</p>
<p>More recently, NetBet strengthened its Italian casino via a deal with the leading developer of games for the online gambling sector, ELK Studios. Announced last week, the deal saw NetBet Italy grow its offering, delivering new games from ELK Studios. As a result, the company's clients were able to access Book of Toro, Pirots, as well as Tropicool 2, among other immersive and quality titles that stand out with rewarding features and unique themes.</p>
