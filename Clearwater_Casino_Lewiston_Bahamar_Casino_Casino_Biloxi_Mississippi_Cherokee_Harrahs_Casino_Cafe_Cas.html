<p>Americas Cardroom promised that it will match players’ winnings when donating to the United Breast Cancer Foundation</p>
<p>Americas Cardroom, a US-themed online poker site, will celebrate International Women’s Day with a special charity tournament. As announced by the company, it will donate funds raised during the event to the United Breast Cancer Foundation.</p>
<p>Poker enthusiasts can join Americas Cardroom in celebration of the occasion and compete for a $10K guaranteed prize pool. The tournament has an entry fee of $55, making it accessible for players of all skill levels.</p>
<p>In addition, Americas Cardroom has decided to make the event even more appealing by providing entrants with an additional $55 tourney ticket. Players can use this second ticket to enter any future $55 tournament hosted by the company.</p>
<p>Americas Cardroom added that the prize pool will be paid out to players. The company will, meanwhile, match the total prize pool and will donate it to the United Breast Cancer Foundation.</p>
<p>A Twitch Live Chat Will Boost Engagement</p>
<p>Katie Lindsay and Ebony Kenney, Americas Cardroom team pros, and Nikki Lomo and Caitlin Comesky, prominent poker celebrities, will bolster engagement during the tournament by hosting a live chat on Twitch.</p>
<p>In addition to discussing the ongoing event and the latest developments, the women will also speak about the importance of raising awareness of the dangers of breast cancer and how important is for women to conduct self-exams at home.</p>
<p>Kenney noted that this wouldn’t be the first time the poker company has organized a tournament for Women’s Day. Last year’s event, she said, was a resounding success. Because of that, Kenney is excited to be a part of the celebrations once again. She said that there is nothing that beats playing poker with friends while supporting a good cause.</p>
<p>Playing poker with some badass friends of mine while also supporting a good cause?! Yes, sign me up! I am honored to be a part of the positive and intentional movement happening for women in poker. Ebony Kenney</p>
<p>Lindsey added that she still fondly remembers the last time Americas Cardroom teamed up with the United Breast Cancer Foundation.</p>
<p>It was so wonderful working with the United Breast Cancer Foundation for our last charity event and I’m super excited to be able to do it again with another great group of women. Katie Lindsay</p>
<p>Nikki Lomo and Caitlin Comesky also released statements on the upcoming tournament, saying that they feel honored to be part of the initiative and join so many talented and inspiring women.</p>
<p>In February, Americas Cardroom ran two satellite events, providing four full poker vacation packages for a Super High Roller Series in Vietnam this March.</p>
