<p>The jackpots for two of the most popular lottery games in the United States survived once again and now continue to grow</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the 14th largest Mega Millions jackpot will be up for grabs, after it survived the drawing on Friday, July 7, 2023. This Tuesday, the jackpot is estimated to hit $480 million or $240.7 million with a cash option, marking the 24th roll for this growing prize.</p>
<p>Some 1,175,091 lucky players secured a prize from the drawing on Friday within all different prize tiers. But while many prizes were handed out, no one hit the jackpot that requires the correct guess for five white balls and the Mega Ball. Still, one ticket, sold in California, guessed correctly the white balls 8, 10, 17, 55 and 66, allowing the lucky player to secure a $1 million dollar prize.</p>
<p>On the other hand, 28 tickets guessed four white balls correctly plus the Mega Ball. This resulted in a win of $10,000 each, while three of those winners paid an extra $1 for a Megaplier, which boosted their prize to $30,000 each.</p>
<p>The last time the Mega Millions jackpot dropped was on April 18 in New York. Since then, there were more than 12.7 million winning tickets within all different prize tiers, excluding the jackpot tier. Since April, there were 16 second-tier prizes of $1 million or more won in 12 different states, including Florida, Illinois, Iowa, New Mexico and others.</p>
<p>Sold in 45 states, as well as the US Virgin Islands and Washington DC, Mega Millions is the only lottery game that has awarded four jackpots that surpassed $1 billion dollars. The first such jackpot was awarded in 2018, then in 2021, 2022 and 2023.</p>
<p>Powerball Jackpot Grows Too</p>
<p>Powerball is the other immensely popular lottery game in the US. The gameâ€™s jackpot survived the drawing on Saturday and now continues to grow for the drawing on Monday, July 10, 2023. The jackpot prize for the upcoming drawing of the Powerball is expected to be approximately $650 million or $328.3 million if a cash option is selected.</p>
<p>On Saturday, no ticket was able to match all six drawn numbers that included white balls 7, 23, 24, 32 and 43, as well as the red Powerball 18. Still, from the recent drawing, three tickets managed to guess correctly all five of the white balls. This granted a $1 million dollar prize for each of the ticket holders in Illinois, California and Colorado.</p>
<p>Besides the million-dollar prizes, 42 tickets matched four of the five white balls along with the red Powerball. As a result, 32 tickets secured prizes of $50,000 each, while the other 10 tickets benefitted from the Power Play option for an additional dollar that boosted their prize to $100,000.</p>
