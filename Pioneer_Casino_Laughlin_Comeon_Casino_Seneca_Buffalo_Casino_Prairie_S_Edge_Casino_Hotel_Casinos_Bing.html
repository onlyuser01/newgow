<p>Tiger Woods No Longer Named in Wrongful Death Lawsuit, Open Championship Odds Lengthen</p>

<p>The 15-time major winner was informed at the PGA Championship that he had been named in a wrongful death lawsuit filed by Immesberger’s estate. The 24-year-old was known to have an alcohol problem, and attorneys for the man claim he was overserved after finishing a shift in December.</p>
<p>We’re all very sad that Nick passed away,” Woods told reporters in May. “It was a terrible night, a terrible ending, and we feel bad for him and his entire family. It’s very sad.”</p>
<p>Immesberger died in a one-car crash around 6 pm on December 10 some 16 miles north of The Woods restaurant. His blood alcohol content was more than three times the legal limit.</p>
<p>This week, Woods’ name was removed from the wrongful death litigation. His lawyer stated, “The decision was clearly appropriate and reflected the fact that Mr. Woods should not have been included in the lawsuit in the first place because he had nothing to do with Mr. Immesberger’s death.”</p>
<p>The lawsuit remains active, however, and still names Woods’ girlfriend, who is the restaurant’s general manager as a defendant.</p>
<p>Major Struggles</p>
<p>Tiger Woods has had issues both off and on the course since winning the 2019 Masters in April.</p>
<p>The Masters was Woods’ first major in more than a decade, but the future hall of famer hasn’t been in serious contention since. There’s likely no need to panic, as he’s only played in three events.</p>
<p>Woods missed the cut at the PGA Championship after shooting rounds of 72 and 73. He played better at the Memorial Tournament, finishing T9 at Jack Nicklaus’ Muirfield Village in Dublin, Ohio, but a full 10 shots from winner Patrick Cantlay.</p>
<p>Woods was also never in contention at the US Open, finishing T21 and 11 shots behind winner Gary Woodland. Tiger is currently out of the country on vacation with his family, and isn’t scheduled to play again until the Open Championship at Royal Portrush Golf Club next month.</p>
<p>Open Odds</p>
<p>Perhaps because of Woods’ average play since the Masters, or limited schedule, but sports bettors aren’t flocking to back Tiger for the Open, which tees off July 18 in Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>After opening Woods at 12/1 to win his 16th major, and fourth Open, the Westgate SuperBook in Las Vegas has lengthened his line to 14/1. Meanwhile, Rory McIlroy, who also opened at 12/1, has shortened to 8/1 after printing numerous ticket slips on the Northern Irishman.</p>
<p>Brooks Koepka is the favorite at 7/1. McIlroy is second, and Dustin Johnson and Woods next at 14/1. Justin Rose rounds out the top five at 16/1. Italian Francesco Molinari – the defending champion who won last year at Carnoustie – is next at 20/1.</p>
<p>Jordan Spieth is now ranked No. 29 in the world, and continues to struggle. He has just five top 25 finishes in 18 starts, and no wins this year. The 2017 Open champ is at 25/1.</p>
