    <h1>Hard Rock Hotel Casino Hollywood Fl Indian Casino Dottys Casino Lincoln Ri Casino Horseshoe Baltimor</h1>

<p>Players hailing from Malta, Sweden, and the Netherlands will be the first to benefit from this partnership, with the United Kingdom set to follow suit</p>
<p>Following a series of distribution deals inked in Q2 2023, Swintt has announced an exciting partnership with Kindred Group, a renowned player in the online gaming sphere. This new alliance will see Swintt’s games making their way onto Kindred Group’s platforms licensed by Malta Gaming Authority (MGA), Sweden’s gambling regulator Spelinspektionen, the Netherlands Gambling Authority, Kansspelautoriteit (KSA), and, soon, the UK Gambling Commission.</p>
<p>Swintt’s Strategic Move to Bolster Its Presence in Regulated iGaming Markets</p>
<p>The primary objective behind this move is to strengthen Swintt’s presence in vital regulated iGaming markets. The shared values and ideologies between Swintt and Kindred Group also make this partnership a perfect match. However, the real excitement lies in the enriched gaming experience that awaits players on Kindred Group platforms, thanks to Swintt’s impressive portfolio of titles.</p>
<p>Players can now delve into a world of captivating themes and innovative bonus features offered by SwinttGames. Notable titles in this collection include “The Crown,” “Aloha Spirit XtraLockTM,” “Candy Gold,” and the recently launched sensation, “Electric Elements.”</p>
<p>For fans of classic slots that evoke the charm of traditional land-based casino games, SwinttPremium offers a diverse selection. This category boasts popular “Book” slots like “Master of Books Unlimited” and “Seven Books Unlimited.” Moreover, Dutch players can now enjoy their favorite land-based slot titles online, including the newly-released “Duolito Gardens.”</p>
<p>Swintt’s CEO Enthusiastic About Partnership’s Potential for European Brand Exposure</p>
<p>David Mann, CEO at Swintt, expressed his excitement about this collaboration, stating: “By making SwinttGames and SwinttPremium releases available to such a wide cross-section of customers, we’ll be able to further raise the profile of our brand across Europe while helping Kindred Group on its ongoing mission to deliver a safe and enjoyable online experience to all casino players.”</p>
<p>Gareth Jennings, head of RNG Casino at Kindred Group, expressed his agreement by stating that Kindred Group believed it had partnered with a company that delivered on both fronts. He also mentioned his anticipation of incorporating Swintt’s innovative range of titles into Kindred’s brands in Malta, Sweden, the UK, and the Netherlands.</p>
<p>Another recent partnership saw Swintt collaborate with ZEAL Network, a leading online provider of state-licensed lottery products in Germany, to expand its game offerings in the country. ZEAL Network integrated Swintt’s complete portfolio of slots, including the popular SwinttPremium games, to enhance its offerings and strengthen Swintt’s presence in the regulated German market.</p>
<p>In June, Swintt further expanded its reach in Malta and Germany with a partnership with NetBet, while in May the company also expanded its presence on the Lithuanian market with a deal with 7Bet.</p>
