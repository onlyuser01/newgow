The company similarly covers international meets from Latin America, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, the United States, Canada, Dubai, Germany, and beyond.</p>
<p>In addition, SIS also provides greyhound racing content from Ireland, Mexico, and the United Kingdom. This commercial partnership is SIS’ latest expansion and an opportunity to continue bolstering local markets in regional markets, which is why it’s working Jolibet in the highly-lucrative Africa region.</p>
<p>Jill Sone, managing director at Jolibet, welcomed the opportunity to further enhance the operator’s offering and provide players with the opportunity to pick from SIS’ excellent offer.
