    <h1>Epoch Casino Yabby Casino Log In Rio Casino Vegas Austin Casino San Juan Marriott Resort Stellaris C</h1>

<p>Dear Bastian,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem.</p>
<p>Could you please forward all the emails or screenshots showing that you have sent requests for your account’s closure? My email address is petronela.k@casino.guru. Did you specify in those requests for how long you wish your account to be closed and clearly stated the reason why?</p>
<p>I have checked the general terms and conditions on the website, and this is what I found https://www.netbet.de/help/terms-and-conditions/terms-conditions:</p>
<p>„22. RESPONSIBLE GAMING</p>
<p>22.1 NetBet undertakes to provide a secure and responsible platform on which players can take advantage of the offers. NetBet is committed to helping players who show signs of potential gambling addiction or who may be at risk of becoming addicted in order to counteract their problems and to obtain the necessary advice and support.</p>
<p>22.2 The player is provided with extensive means to protect himself, such as the right to choose financial limits, the right to limit the length of the session, the right to lock himself out for a certain period of time or permanently, and a 7-day relaxation period starting on the day NetBet received notification from the player.</p>
<p>22.3 After registration, the player can request to be temporarily or permanently excluded from NetBet's offers at any time.</p>
<p>22.4 If you want to restrict your gambling, you can do this via the release and self-exclusion functions in the help area and via your personal account (&gt;&gt; responsibility).</p>
<p>22.5 You can also make use of these options by contacting our customer service. Upon completion of this process and after your confirmation, we will close your account and return any outstanding balance to you. Any outstanding bets that have already been placed will be void and your stakes will be returned.</p>
<p>22.6 Once the request has been processed and the account has been blocked, no further bets will be accepted and the account will be frozen. The player will not receive any further advertising from NetBet. If a player contacts NetBet to apply for temporary self-exclusion, NetBet will ask the player to determine whether the remaining balance should be returned to their bank account / credit card (depending on the payment method) or to NetBet during the time of the exclusion should stay.</p>
<p>22.7 You can lock yourself out or permanently exclude yourself for a period of at least six months and a maximum of 5 years. If you decide to lock yourself out, you will not be able to access or use your account during the period of self-exclusion. During the period of self-exclusion, all measures will be taken to exclude you from using our offer. Under no circumstances may you try to take advantage of our offers and we cannot be held responsible or liable for any consequences or losses (however caused) resulting from the continued use of our offer, including the creation of further accounts falls by changing some of your information during registration or by entering incorrect"</p>
<p>Is this informationen@netbet.com the email address you have sent your emails to?</p>
<p>I hope we will be able to help you to resolve this issue as soon as possible. Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
