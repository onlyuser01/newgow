<p>DraftKings is not slowing down. The company spent $1.2 billion on various marketing initiatives in 2021. It secured a $6.5-million 30-second ad spot for the upcoming Super Bowl LVI and is present in 18 regulated gambling states in the US Washington would make the 19th market entry.</p>
<p>DraftKings Enters Washington for More Retail Betting</p>
<p>Now, the company is expanding its reach through an exclusive market partnership with the Tulalip Tribes of Washington, which will allow the betting agency to enter the state of Washington and bring its unique sportsbook experience to local sports fans.</p>
<p>As a result, the DraftKings Sportsbook will spring at the Tulalip Resort Casino and Quil Ceda Creek Casino, which are both located 30 minutes north of Seattle in Tulalip. While the sportsbook is still pending regulator approvals, DraftKings plans to introduce 5,000 square feet of betting space along with a 50-foot video wall and over 20 kiosks, eight ticket stations, and more.</p>
<p>The Quil Ceda property is still in the early planning stages, but it should replicate the experience at Tulalip Resort. Commenting on this opportunity, Tulalip Tribes chairwoman Teri Gobin said:</p>
<p>“We’re ready to take our gaming experience to the next level. Like Tulalip, DraftKings is committed to excellence and, together, we’re going to give sports fans a one-of-a-kind experience. We can’t wait for our customers to share our journey as we build the newest addition to our entertainment destinations.” Tulalip Tribes chairwoman Teri Gobin</p>
<p>The partnership was well-received by the sports betting operator. Retail Sportsbooks at DraftKings, Michael Kibort, welcomed the move as an opportunity for the company to expand in the Pacific Northwest. DraftKings is fully committed to bringing the desired sports betting experience to fans in the state across all major professional sports leagues, Kibort added.</p>
<p>DraftKings Remains Committed to Safe Gambling</p>
<p>Kibort was adamant that the company would seek to bring the most worthwhile real money gaming experiences to the state and local audiences. DraftKings is further committed to forwarding its DraftKings S.E.R.V.E.S program, which focuses on numerous aspects of the betting experience, including responsible gaming.</p>
<p>DraftKings continues to pioneer groundbreaking technology, which it believes would give sports fans an advanced betting experience. This is another launch after the most recent rollout in New York, in which DraftKings debuted on Saturday, January 8.</p>
