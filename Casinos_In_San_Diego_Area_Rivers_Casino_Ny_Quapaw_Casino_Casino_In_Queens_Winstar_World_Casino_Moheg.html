<p>An ex-assistant manager showed up in court this week to face a charge for allegedly embezzling over $100,000 from a restaurant in Connecticut’s Mohegan Sun casino.</p>

<p>Six-Figure Haul</p>
<p>The attorney representing Adam G. Johnson, 43, of Griswold, Connecticut, entered a not guilty plea for his client on Monday on a single count of first-degree larceny. The charges stemmed from Johnson’s alleged theft of $103,568 over three years from the Ballo Italian restaurant at Mohegan Sun where he worked.</p>
<p>The Day newspaper revealed that Johnson gambled before he came to work and after he finished his shift, according to fellow restaurant employees.</p>
<p>But Johnson told police a different story, saying that while he had taken the money while he was supposed to be totaling up the day’s receipts, he’d used most of it for family expenses and also shared some with the restaurant’s bartenders.</p>
<p>Checks and No Balances</p>
<p>According to investigators, Johnson voided charges on customers’ restaurant tabs that had been paid in cash or entered invalid promotional codes through a computer “point of sale” system.</p>
<p>Johnson admitted that he often voided items off checks, particularly on weekends, and would pocket anywhere from $150 to $800.</p>
<p>It started in 2015, when he allegedly altered 49 checks and voided 91 items. That year, he stole $2,134. From there, his patterns escalated, moving from $5,119 in alleged stolen monies in 2016 up to $63,370 in 2018 until he was caught. In total, over the four years, Johnson allegedly changed 1,304 checks and voided 4,603 items.</p>
<p>The embezzlement was revealed last September when an employee — taking part in a contest among servers over who could sell the most appetizers and specialty drinks — noticed that five items she served were not listed. After checking totals, the general manager confronted Johnson. He was fired and said, “You got me,” according to The Day.</p>
<p>In October, tribal police were notified of the thefts. They investigated and charged Johnson in January of this year.</p>
<p>This week, Johnson appeared in New London Superior Court and a judge continued the case to March 14. He has been released after posting a $50,000 bond. If convicted, Johnson faces up to 20 years in prison and a fine of $15,000, according to Connecticut’s state statutes.</p>
