<p>Beauty Fruity review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Set on a warm tropical beach and hosted by a hot bikini-clad blonde, Beauty Fruity is not aiming for the heights of sophistication with its theme. The sales pitch here is more or less: fruit machine plus cleavage.</p>
<p>So the reels sport a range of mostly tropical fruits, while the background and soundtrack do their best to put you on a sunny beach while a woman bobs her head and pats her thighs in an unnaturally mechanical manner.</p>
<p>There is no doubt an audience for this sort of thing, after all: sex sells. But it is hard to exactly work out what player would opt for the slightly trashy artwork of this slot rather than just playing a better made fruit machine while reading the lingerie "adverts" in GQ.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>Wazdan’s usually excellent art department seem to have taken a lot of half days and liquid lunches while working on Beauty Fruity. Ironically - given the title - the slot looks a complete mess.</p>
<p>The background with its limpid blue water and palm trees is pretty well executed, but it is all downhill from there. The babe has been drawn in a style that makes her appear like she has just arrived fresh from the uncanny valley, and the nonsensical reel designs look cheap and dull.</p>
<p>The high-quality music and animations do their best to salvage the whole sorry affair, but their quality just throws the art style into sharper relief.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Beauty Fruity is a three by three slot machine with each symbol on the grid spinning on a separate reel.</p>
<p>Four or more symbols anywhere on the reels will pay out a prize. Any prizes can be gambled immediately in a double or nothing game in which the player picks from between two baskets, one containing a fruit and the other containing rotten banana skins. Picking the skins loses and picking the fruit wins.</p>
<p>There are also two free spin bonus games with slightly different rules, the full details of which are in the next section.</p>
<p>Overall, this simple gameplay is perfectly adequate.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>There is no Wild symbol in Beauty Fruity.</p>
<p>If the player lands three Girl symbols on the middle line, they trigger nine Love Free Spins. During the Love Free Spins, all Girl symbols are sticky and remain in place for all subsequent spins. This makes payouts with other symbols much less likely but builds to a potentially big payout with the ménage of Girl symbols.</p>
<p>Three Fruity Sweets symbols on the middle line trigger nine free spins with a x3 multiplier applied to all wins for the duration of those spins.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.27%, a touch over our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.10 up to a maximum of $/£/€100.00 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is set by a toggle switch in the bottom right hand corner of the game near the right thigh of the lady. This button, when caressed, switches between high, medium, and low volatility. We suggest putting the game on the high volatility setting, as our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Beauty Fruity is a rare misfire from Wazdan who normally do solid gameplay mixed with good visuals and great music. Here they seem to have so badly missed on the visuals and the theme that Beauty Fruity struggles to recover.</p>
<p>Despite this, the gameplay is pretty good and the music is what you would expect. The RTP is slightly above average (though a little lower than many Wazdan offerings like Magic Stars 6 and Riders of the Storm) and the volatility is adjustable which we like, since it allows us to choose the highest possible setting.</p>
<p>Overall, if you can get past its tacky facade, Beauty Fruity isn’t all that bad.</p>
