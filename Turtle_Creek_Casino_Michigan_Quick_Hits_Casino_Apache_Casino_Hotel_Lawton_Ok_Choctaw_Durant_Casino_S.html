    <h1>Turtle Creek Casino Michigan Quick Hits Casino Apache Casino Hotel Lawton Ok Choctaw Durant Casino S</h1>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>At first I tried to log in to Hyperino, but I received an error message and was therefore unable to log in properly.</p>
<p>I noticed that the private mode of my browser was switched on and switched it off and tried to log in again and did not use umlauts in my name when registering because I thought that the logon failed because of this.</p>
<p>Lo and behold, the registration and verification of my email address then worked without an error message.</p>
<p>I deposited a few hundred euros and fortunately, after a series of zero rounds, a few winnings came.</p>
<p>I then operated the payout function and wanted to have the money withdrawn to test the speed of the payout.</p>
<p>First came an email that my order will be checked with id 117869.</p>
<p>Then came the disappointing news that my withdrawal request had been rejected.</p>
<p>Support told me I should get an email and nothing could be said until then.</p>
<p>It may be that the first failed login attempt is considered a registration and the casino will give this as a reason to prevent the payment, although the casino did not suffer any disadvantages due to the failed login attempt and I did not create two verified accounts because I only have one have a working account and my first login attempt failed with an error message and could not have been verified.</p>
<p>As a result, my player account was blocked for deposits and withdrawals, but I was still able to play with my existing balance.</p>
<p>A few days later, I was able to create another withdrawal order that was reviewed and rejected again.</p>
<p>In the chat I am always put off, you can only tell me something after the email from the responsible body.</p>
<p>I hope you can help me.</p>
