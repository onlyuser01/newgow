<p>Flutter Entertainment Plc, a leading global sports betting and gaming provider, accelerates its strategic plans with confidence, reporting total revenue growth of 32% to £1.485 billion in its first quarter of 2021.</p>
<p>Flutter Reports Rapid Growth in Q1 of 2021</p>
<p>Flutter Entertainment Plc (FLTR.L), a leading global sportsbook and gaming provider, has reported a growth of 32% to £1.485 billion in its Q1 of 2021, compared to the previous year’s revenue of £1.126 billion. The company reported online revenue growth of 42% and an average online player growth of 36% or 7.6 million globally, as opposed to Q1 2019, when the company had 5.6 million players. In its Q1 trading update, the gambling group recorded growth in all of its core divisions.</p>
<p>Flutter CEO Peter Jackson stated that the company is off to a good start in 2021. He said that the group continues to grow its global player base which is the main driver behind the 42% online revenue increase.</p>
<p>Flutter Flagship Brands Establish as Market Leaders</p>
<p>Flutter has expressed confidence that it will continue to establish its flagship brands as market leaders. The company’s UK&amp;IRE division of Paddy Power, Betfair, and Sky Bet brands recorded a revenue increase of 16% to £568 million. Flutter reports an increase in digital activity as its active players increased by 23% to 3.16 million.</p>
<p>In Australia, Flutter’s Sportsbet AUS unit recorded a 59% increase in revenues to £279 million, compared to the first quarter of 2020, with £161 million.</p>
<p>Flutter’s International PokerStars unit recorded a 7% increase in revenue to £351 million, compared to the first quarter of 2020, with £334 million. However, online poker registered a player activity drop of 9%. According to Flutter, it will be corrected by future investments in marketing and product retention.</p>
<p>Flutter’s US sports wagering unit recorded an increase in revenue of 135% increase to £288 million, compared to the first quarter of 2020 to £132 million. The unit breakdown showed that Flutter’s FanDuel accounted for 91.6% of US revenue, and for 2020, 89.1%. FOX Bet, which includes PokerStars US, accounted for the other 8.4%.</p>
<p>Jackson also mentioned a possible US listing of a small shareholding of FanDuel Group, even though no decisions have been made.</p>
<p>Safe Gambling Remains Flutter’s Priority</p>
<p>Jackson stated that safe gambling remains a top priority across Flutter’s key markets. The group has partnered up with Gamban in the US and continues developments on the planned Affordability Triple Step in the UK.</p>
<p>In March, Gamban and FanDuel inked a partnership to boost the operator’s responsible gambling strategies in the US. As a result of the agreement, FanDuel offers its customers Gamban’s software free of charge.</p>
<p>At the beginning of April, Flutter Entertainment added a credit card ban in Ireland to stop excessive gambling. The measure means that users cannot carry out payments through a credit card on Flutter’s Sky, Betfair, or Paddy Power.</p>
