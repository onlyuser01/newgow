<p>Boasting substantial management experience and industry insight, Westbury should be the perfect candidate for the position. His new responsibilities will focus on fostering growth and bolstering Sport Generate’s worldwide brand recognition. The appointment is part of Digitain’s ongoing expansion plans as it strives to provide the best possible service to its growing client base.</p>
<p>Westbury Is a Skilled and Industry-Savvy Professional</p>
<p>The new Sport Generate CEO boasts nearly twenty years of management experience, primarily in the iGaming world. Westbury’s work for Digitain spans almost four years and has seen him rise to become the developer’s chief business officer. Digitain and Sport Generate founder Vardges Vardanyan recognized Westbury’s vast skills and industry insight as the leading factors for his promotion to CEO.</p>
<p>We are thrilled to have Simon Westbury on his new position, and we know that he will bring Sport Generate to new heights with his leadership and expertise. Vardges Vardanyan, Founder of Digitain and Sport Generate</p>
<p>The new position marks a new high of Westbury’s career, capping years of hard work and perseverance. After graduating with a Master’s Degree in Politics from the University of Exeter, he tried his hand at management positions across various industries like energy and media before ultimately finding his home in the iGaming space.</p>
<p>His four-year tenure at virtual sports betting product developer VSoftCo provided him with significant industry insights, bolstering his successful track record in business strategy, executing sales, account management, and marketing. His work on delivering B2B and B2C solutions impressed Digitain, which onboarded him as head of their international development department, eventually propelling him to his current position.</p>
<p>The New Position Comes with Significant Responsibilities</p>
<p>Simon Westbury’s vast experience and familiarity with Digitain’s inner workings make him the perfect candidate to take over as CEO of Sport Generate. The company primarily focuses on popularizing and developing professional sports as a tournament organizer. Sport Generate currently engages with 100 professional athletes, referees, and coaches across sports like table football, e-football, and e-basketball.</p>
<p>As CEO, Westbury will be in charge of Sport Generate’s direction, guiding the company’s strategic growth and helping the management team implement innovative and engaging products to complement Digitain’s overall goals. The new CEO expressed gratitude for the opportunity, pledging to fully utilize his skills and help Sport Generate make an impact in the market.</p>
<p>I am honored to be given the opportunity to lead Sport Generate at such an exciting time in the industry. Simon Westbury, CEO of Sport Generate</p>
<p>If Westbury succeeds in his mission to propel Sport Generate to new heights, Digitain should also reap significant benefits. The developer primarily focuses on Europe but maintains substantial worldwide expansion ambitions. International Sport Generate success could provide the perfect opportunity to propel Digitain forward and bolster its market reach.</p>
