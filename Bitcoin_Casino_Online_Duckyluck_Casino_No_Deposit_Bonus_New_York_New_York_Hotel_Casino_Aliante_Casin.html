<p>The funding will help CHIPS secure wheelchairs for an additional 20 kids suffering from various disabilities</p>
<p>Genting Casinos UK, the British subsidiary of the international casino and integrated resort developer Genting Group, has unveiled a new charity initiative. As announced on its LinkedIn page, Genting’s UK arm will provide funding to CHIPS, a charity raising funds for children with disabilities.</p>
<p>The casino company said that its donation will help CHIPS improve the well-being of an additional 20 children. CHIPS, which was founded on behalf of the UK Gaming industry back in 2001, seeks to change the lives of children with disabilities by providing them with specialized powered wheelchairs.</p>
<p>The CHIPS charity committee is formed by senior members of the British gambling industry. The organization works for free, deducing no expenses and using every penny available to “provide the quality of life that is the right of every child.”</p>
<p>In these last two decades, the UK gambling industry has helped CHIPS raise over £2,000,000 ($2,490,000 in USD, current conversion rates). Thanks to this, CHIPS has been able to provide more than 500 wheelchairs to kids with disabilities.</p>
<p>President Willcock Praised CHIPS’ Work</p>
<p>Genting UK’s initiative was addressed by the company’s president and chief operating officer, Paul Willcock. He said that CHIPS is a charity that is very special to him and that he believes it is great to see the UK gaming industry join forces to help those in need.</p>
<p>It’s been incredible to watch the UK gaming industry come together over the years to raise these vital funds that enable us to support so many young people. The powered wheelchairs really are a life-changing piece of equipment and provide disabled children with independence and mobility. Paul Willcock, president &amp; COO, Genting UK</p>
<p>Willcock added that he feels honored that his team is able to make a new donation to the charity and support its “amazing work.” The president praised CHIPS for doing everything it can to change the lives of more and more deserving children.</p>
<p>Genting UK Recently Closed One of Its Properties</p>
<p>Genting Casinos UK now boasts dozens of casinos in the United Kingdom and is one of the biggest operators in the country. The company employs thousands of employees across its venues and has two brands in provincial areas, namely Genting Casino and Genting Club.</p>
<p>Genting UK has been focused on growing and providing its clients with more and more exciting casino experiences. Despite that, the operator was recently forced to close its Genting Casino Nottingham property because of “commercial considerations.”</p>
<p>Many of the locals said that The Cornerhouse leisure complex where the casino was located will feel emptier without it.</p>
