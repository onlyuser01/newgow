<p>Information about Stakelogic Games casinos</p>
<p>Stakelogic is a software developer that creates in-house casino games for the iGaming industry. Originally set up by Greentube, Novomatic's interactive division, it now operates as an independent company.</p>
<p>Many online casinos offer Stakelogic games to their customers. This page will help you locate the best Stakelogic casinos, with information on how to conduct an effective casino search. You'll also find out about Stakelogic's history, which of its games to look out for, and where to look for Stakelogic casino bonuses.</p>

<p>Stakelogic: Novomatic's former interactive division that's now an independent entity</p>
<p>Stakelogic entered the iGaming industry as a division of Greentube – Novomatic's interactive games arm – in 2015. With Novomatic keen to keep its status as a leading provider, Stakelogic's mission was to produce innovative multi-channel slot games for iGaming websites.</p>
<p>It was only three years later, however, that Novomatic sold Stakelogic to outside investors, and a new chapter of the company's history began. The company immediately started to release new slot games as an independent entity, and struck deals with other providers and major gaming sites through its partner program Greenlogic. It also added the Gambling Commission (GC) license to its armory, a respected authority that holds providers to the highest quality standards.</p>
<p>Stakelogic also expanded geographically. In 2020, it opened a new headquarters in Malta, possibly to make it easier to obtain the MGA license, and it also started to operate in Portugal, Italy, and Greece. Megaways slots became part of Stakelogic's collection, too – you can play some of these for free on our Stakelogic Games page – while the company also won several awards from organizations such as SIG.</p>
<p>Apart from its extensive slots collection, Stakelogic operates a live casino game program that offers blackjack, roulette, and baccarat games, allowing players to experience the feeling of being in a live casino setting while at home.</p>
<p>Stakelogic slots and casino games</p>
<p>Stakelogic has a reputation for producing interesting slot games, and this is helped by several Megaways games in its collection. Some examples of them are:</p>
<p>Black Gold 2</p>
<p>Candyways Bonanza 2</p>
<p>Super Joker</p>
<p>Giants Fortune</p>
<p>Mystical Santa</p>
<p>Black Gold 2 is a notable example of the Megaways game structure. Combining typically high volatility with a detailed Wild West-style design, it offers an entertaining playing experience. The game's 'Any Way Wins' system – where wins are awarded for matching symbols in adjacent reels – is something to look out for, while players can also double their bet to activate bonuses with the Super Stake feature, or wager their current win by betting on red or black or drawing cards.</p>
<p>You'll also find that Stakelogic caters for another side of the market: those players who prefer simpler, more traditional games than the all-singing all-dancing Megaways. Club 2000 Deluxe is one such example: it's literally just an old-school six-reel virtual slots machine set in a bricks-and-mortar casino. The retro design comes with retro gameplay: you simply aim to get fruit combos in exchange for payouts. The scatter symbols, including the bell, watermelon, and grapes, pay out 25x your stake, while standard icons pay out 20x for three, and 4x for two – that's it, that's the game.</p>
<p>Similar classic Stakelogic games include Multi Fruits Quattro, Hot 4 Shot Deluxe, and Big Runner Jackpot Deluxe. Some retro titles do also include Megaways gameplay, namely Sizzling Peppers, Super Wild, and Runner Runner.</p>
<p>As mentioned, Stakelogic also offers a host of live-dealer games which give an interactive edge to your playing, so try these out if you'd like to experience the atmosphere of a traditional casino.</p>
<p>How to choose the best Stakelogic casino online</p>
<p>Stakelogic games are available to play in many different online casinos, but not all of these sites are a wise choice to play on. Sometimes online casinos cause problems for players; maybe they take a long time to pay out a big win or have bad customer service; so, with all the casinos out there, why bother with them?</p>
<p>This is what this page is here for: to help you avoid the unreliable sites. Instead, Casino Guru has compiled a rating and review system to guide you toward only the best Stakelogic casinos.</p>
<p>The 'Recommended' tab at the top of the page is where we advise you to start. By clicking this, you'll see the Stakelogic sites with the highest Safety Index. This is the score we assign to each site based on objective factors, such as how many complaints it's received and the quality of its related casinos.</p>
<p>You can also view the newest Stakelogic casinos by clicking the 'Newly opened' tab. These may not have the best rating, but they often have exclusive offers for new players as they seek to build a positive reputation.</p>
<p>There are other filters you can use to refine your search further, including:</p>
<p>Payment Method</p>
<p>If you'd like to play for real money, then a casino accepting your chosen deposit method is essential. You can find the Stakelogic sites that accept popular options like Visa and PayPal with this filter.</p>
<p>Casino Games</p>
<p>Slots are Stakelogic's trademark, but the casinos that offer them may also have some attractive roulette, blackjack or video poker games. Click this filter to find them.</p>
<p>Bitcoin/crypto-friendly</p>
<p>Crypto-friendly casinos are growing in number, so use this filter to locate those.</p>
<p>Currency</p>
<p>We hear a lot about USD, GBP, and EUR, but you can find alternative currencies using this section.</p>

<p>Stakelogic online casino bonuses</p>
<p>If you're on the hunt for casino bonuses, then Casino Guru can help you find the best ones. The most common type, deposit bonuses, are awarded after you put money into your casino account, but you may also get the chance to use a no deposit bonus just for signing up.</p>
<p>To see bonuses offered by Stakelogic casinos, do the following:</p>
<p>Go to Casino Guru's list of casino bonuses</p>
<p>Choose 'Stakelogic' from the list of game providers</p>

<p>You can also arrange these bonuses according to their type. For no deposit bonuses, for example, just choose 'No Deposit Bonus' in the Bonus Type filter. You can get the same offers by going to our list of no deposit bonuses and choosing 'Stakelogic' there.</p>
<p>You should always get up-to-date offers thanks to the Casino Guru team's hard work in keeping the list refreshed.</p>
