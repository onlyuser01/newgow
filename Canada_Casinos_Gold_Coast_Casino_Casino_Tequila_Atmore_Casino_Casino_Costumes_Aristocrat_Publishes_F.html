    <h1>Canada Casinos Gold Coast Casino Casino Tequila Atmore Casino Casino Costumes Aristocrat Publishes F</h1>

<p>CEO Croker said he is proud of the company’s annual achievements</p>
<p>Aristocrat has published its full-year results for 2023, posting a robust revenue and EBITDA gain. Between September 2022 and September 2023, the company recorded operating revenue of AUD 6.3 billion.</p>
<p>Now licensed in 103 countries and 327 jurisdictions, the company also reported EBITDA of AUD 2.1 billion. Based on normalized results, operating revenue recorded year-on-year growth of 13%. This is notably the lowest increase recorded by the company and was driven by strong performance in Aristocrat Gaming in North America. Pixel United’s performance was impacted by a variety of factors.</p>
<p>Aristocrat also reported net profit of AUD 1.3 billion, representing a 21% increase. In the meantime, the most significant growth was from the company’s earnings per share, which increased by 26% to 189.6c.</p>
<p>Aristocrat’s results highlighted operating cash flow of AUD 1.79 billion. At the close of the fiscal year, the gambling giant also reported cash debt of AUD 809 million.</p>
<p>In addition to posting strong results, Aristocrat reported strong growth of Premium Class III and Class II installed base, which grew by 8.2%, exceeding 64,000 units. Aristocrat remained the leading supplier in the US market, achieving portfolio performance of 1.4x floor average. Aristocrat also featured 19 of the top 25 Top Premium Leased games, 17 of the Top 25 Mechanical Reel games and 14 of the top 25 Class II Video games.</p>
<p>CEO Croker Praised the Results</p>
<p>Aristocrat’s chief executive officer and managing director, Trevor Croker, commented on the results, saying that he is proud of the company’s annual achievements. He said that the “high-quality result” achieved by the company “demonstrates the ongoing resilience, competitiveness and diversification” of Aristocrat’s portfolio. Croker added that the results also attested to the sound fundamentals in the markets in which Aristocrat operates.</p>
<p>FY 2023 also saw the company sign key partnerships with many major companies and organizations. This included a partnership with the Formula 1 Heineken Silver Las Vegas Grand Prix, upon which the gambling supplier’s machines became the event’s official slot machines.</p>
<p>The partnership represented an opportunity for the company to expand in professional sports.</p>
