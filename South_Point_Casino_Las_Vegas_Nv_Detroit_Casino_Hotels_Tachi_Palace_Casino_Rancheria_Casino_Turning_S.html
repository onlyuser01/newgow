<p>Gordon Ramsay has become the new CEO of Australia’s Alliance for Gambling Reform, the country’s most prominent organization of responsible gambling.</p>
<p>Gordon Ramsay Was the Attorney General of ACT for 19 Years</p>
<p>The Board of the Alliance for Gambling Reform, the leading gambling awareness organization in Australia, has found its new CEO. It has appointed former attorney general of the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) Gordon Ramsay. He served as the Attorney General from 2016 to 2020. During his tenure, poker machines (pokies) have been reduced by 20%. Ramsay also oversaw the establishment of the country’s gaming legislation with “regulatory improvements.”</p>
<p>Ramsay has a rich background, working for two decades in community service and advocacy. He helped develop the UnitingCare Kippax group and helped to turn it into a well-known social service organization. He worked as an executive minister at Kippax for 19 years.</p>
<p>In his statement commenting on his appointment, Ramsay said that he was: “proud of leading a public health approach to gambling in the ACT, and of cementing relationships with advocates, regulatory bodies, industry, and people with lived experience to reduce gambling harm.”</p>
<p>Ramsay Has Received a Warm Welcome from the Alliance</p>
<p>Board Chair of the Alliance, Sharon Dickson, said that Ramsay’s extensive experience would be beneficial to the Alliance and its community of partners. The organization’s goal is to reduce gambling harm, which is a health issue in Australia.</p>
<p>She said that Ramsay’s unique skills and experience in advocacy and justice make him the ideal person for the job. He has experience in politics and gambling reform and can lead the organization in the right direction.</p>
<p>Dickson also expressed gratitude to Tony Mohr for his contribution to the organization. He has worked with the Alliance and has created a solid ground for the new CEO of the organization.</p>
<p>Rev. Tim Costello Confident in the New Hire</p>
<p>Alliance Chief Advocate Rev. Tim Costello said that the organization was impressed with ACT’s ability to handle the pokies scheme with Gordon as its lead. He said that this proves his ability to help reform gambling in Australia.</p>
<p>Costello said that there is much momentum to build on when it comes to gambling reforms. He is confident in Gordon’s capabilities and expertise in political and social justice areas.</p>
<p>In an interview for Gamblingnews.com, Costello recently said that gambling harm is a significant public health issue in Australia. He said that gambling is connected to many mental health problems, family issues, including domestic violence and even suicide.</p>
<p>He said that “New South Wales and Australia have the opportunity to kill two birds with one stone.” In his opinion, a proposed gaming card could help reduce harmful gambling and illicit receipts from poker machines in Australia.</p>
