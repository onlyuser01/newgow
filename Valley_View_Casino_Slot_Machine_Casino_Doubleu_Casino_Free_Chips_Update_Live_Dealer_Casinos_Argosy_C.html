<p>Day 1 of the 2023 Royal Ascot is on the program on Tuesday, June 20. There are three Group A races on the program that day, starting with the one-mile-long Queen Anne Stakes race</p>
<p>The 2023 Royal Ascot action kicks off with Queen Anne Stakes, a race that was first held back in 1840. It’s been a Group 1 race for 20 years, with 4+-year-olds racing over a one-mile distance. Charlie Appleby’s Colt Modern Games is the No. 1 favorite, with John Gosden’s Inspiral being a close second on the list of 2023 Queen Anne Stakes favorites.</p>

<p>Modern Games and Inspiral Seen as Two Top Queen Anne Stakes 2023 Favorites</p>
<p>Priced at +163, Modern Games leads the betting action but is closely followed by Inspiration, which is the No. 2 favorite with the Queen Anne States odds of +175.</p>
<p>It’s really no surprise that these two horses are seen as the top two favorites. Modern Games is the most prolific runner on the card, with a 53.33%-win rate (8 wins in 15 starts). Further, Charlie Appleby’s horse has only finished three times outside the top two in his life.</p>
<p>Then, there’s Inspiral, a filly with six wins in eight outings. The last time she ran was in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes last October when we saw her end in the 6th position. Before that race, however, she was nothing short of impressive. She did start slow, but we saw her completely outclass her rivals near the finish.</p>
<p>However, she hasn’t competed since. The Queen Anne Stakes on Day 1 of the 2023 Royal Ascot is going to be her first competitive race in eight months.</p>
<p>Queen Anne Stakes Contenders Worth Checking Out</p>
<p>The No. 3 horse on the list of Queen Anne Stakes favorites is another Charlie Appleby runner, Native Trail. With the odds of +550, this horse isn’t expected to win the race on Tuesday, but we could see him get a good finish.</p>
<p>The runner-up of the 2022 G1 2,000 Guineas has the pedigree to do great on June 20, but the problem is that this horse spent months without training due to wind surgery.</p>
<p>Native Trail is the last horse with the odds in the form of a three-digit number. Behind him is Chindit, whose odds are currently +1000, followed by Mutasaabeq at +1600. Light Infantry, Cash, and Tripple Time all come with odds of +2500.</p>
<p>2023 Queen Anne Stakes at Royal Ascot Prediction</p>
<p>Modern Games is the main Queen Anne Stakes 2023 favorite for a reason. This horse is a born winner who’s in great form. The proof of this is that the colt is coming off a win at Newbury, which saw him finish in front of his Royal Ascot rival Chindit.</p>
<p>It was a close race between the two of them, but Modern Games finish by more than three lengths in front of another two Queen Anne Stakes rivals, Mutasaabeq and Lusail.</p>
<p>He’s already proven that he’s better than all of them and we think he’s gonna finish before them on Tuesday, But what about his main rival for the No. 1 place, Inspiral? We think that this filly’s just had too much of a hiatus to be considered a strong favorite.</p>
<p>Pick: Modern Times to win</p>
