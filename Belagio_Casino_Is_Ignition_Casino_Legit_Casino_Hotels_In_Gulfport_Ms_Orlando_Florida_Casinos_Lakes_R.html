    <h1>Belagio Casino Is Ignition Casino Legit Casino Hotels In Gulfport Ms Orlando Florida Casinos Lakes R</h1>

<p>Australian casino powerhouse Star Entertainment Group has reinforced its team with the addition of the experienced Zhan Spalding as general manager surveillance Queensland. This appointment is in line with the company’s gender equality efforts.</p>
<p>Spalding Has an Impressive Track Record</p>
<p>Spalding is no stranger to the gambling industry. She boasts over three decades of experience with gaming and hospitality companies from all over the world. During her career, Spalding has worked as a surveillance officer for many businesses and has a lot of experience in what she does.</p>
<p>Spalding’s career began as a hotel manager at Interhotels in the Czech Republic. In 1990, she joined Casinos Austria in Prague where she worked as a croupier and later a manager. Spalding decided to stick with the gaming industry and later occupied many gaming positions at companies in various countries. Between 1992 and 1993, Spalding worked as a pit manager for Le Grand Casino la Mamounia in Morocco. She later moved to New Zealand and had tenures at Christchurch Casino and SKYCITY.</p>
<p>In 1998, the experienced gaming worker returned to Europe for a two-year stint with Casinos Austria in Romania. She later moved overseas to Latin America and worked for a handful of companies in Argentina and Venezuela. In 2006, Spalding went to Russia where she worked as a group director of security and surveillance for Tilley Entertainment. Spalding stuck with the latter company for a while and later returned to Prague as project director of Tilley’s Czech arm.</p>
<p>The experienced woman then had a short stint as surveillance manager of Aspers Group in the United Kingdom before finally departing for Australia in 2014 where she remains today. Spalding’s latest experiences include several years at various surveillance-related positions at SKYCITY Australia.</p>
<p>Spalding Will Help Star Meets Its Diversity Quotas</p>
<p>Spalding’s experience sets her apart as a cosmopolitan worker who will be a great addition to Star Entertainment’s team. As general manager of surveillance in Queensland, she will assist with Star’s post-inquiry recovery and help the operator become a highly-respected brand once again. Spalding’s job will be to oversee The Star Gold Coast and Treasury Brisbane, Star’s two venues in the Australian state.</p>
<p>Speaking about her new position, Spalding said that she is glad to be joining Star Entertainment and hopes to help it grow its business. She noted that during her career, she has often been the only woman on the surveillance team. Spalding said that this is rather sad, which is why she is passionate about inspiring other women to join the industry.</p>
<p>I also want to shine a spotlight on the breadth of the role, which is complex and challenging requiring knowledge of technology, compliance, policy, procedure, data analytics, crisis management and more. Zhan Spalding, GM surveillance, Star Queensland</p>
<p>Jess Mellor, chief operating officer of Star Gold Coast, welcomed Spalding to Star’s team. He praised her extensive experience in surveillance tech implementation, multi-site management, restructuring and streamlining processes. Mellor emphasized that the team will be relying on her experience a lot.</p>
<p>Her appointment underpins The Star’s growth and investment in Queensland as well as bolstering our female leadership ranks. Jess Mellor, COO, Star Gold Coast</p>
<p>Star Entertainment hopes to diversify its ranks. When it comes to the leadership team, the company has a target of 45% male, 45% female and 10% non-binary people.</p>
