<p>Among the companies that work with Salsa Gator are such suppliers as Evolution and Pragmatic, Spinomenal, Spribe, and many others.</p>
<p>RSA COO Lucas Vinicius Alencar Alves has welcomed this new opportunity and said that Latin American players have particular demands that Salsa Gator is going to meet in full, bringing instant benefits to partner operators.</p>
<p>Alves and RSA are confident in Salsa Technology’s ability to deliver and meet market needs. As to Salsa, Company Head of Marketing &amp; Sales Eliane Nunes said that teaming up with RSA is an opportunity to further expand the company’s footprint in Latin America.</p>
<p>"Our carefully curated casino library will add momentum to the first three strong years of RSA growth," Nunes said teasing the benefits RSA is in for by teaming up with Salsa Technology and the Salsa Gator solution.</p>
<p>This is not the first time in recent weeks and months that Salsa Technology has driven a foray into the Latin American market. Previously, the company announced an alliance with Weebet, a company focused on stats and software development.</p>
