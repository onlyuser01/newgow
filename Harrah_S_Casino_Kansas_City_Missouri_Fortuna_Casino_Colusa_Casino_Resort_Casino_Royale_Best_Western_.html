    <h1>Harrah S Casino Kansas City Missouri Fortuna Casino Colusa Casino Resort Casino Royale Best Western</h1>

<p>Dear krxz123,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. I have checked the general bonus terms and conditions, and this is what I found (here):</p>
<p>"The maximum winnings that will be paid out resulting from any cash bonus, cashback, personal bonus, free chip bonus (including, but not limited to Welcome Package, Weekend Reload, Special Bonuses for VIP Levels, Comppoints, Tournament wins, Lottery wins, etc.) will equal the bonus amount multiplied by 10 unless otherwise stated. Any winnings exceeding this amount will be forfeited upon withdrawal. Please note that until withdrawal of relevant balance is processed, funds on the balance will be considered a subject to maximum winnings rule."</p>
<p>I would like to emphasize, that according to our Fair Gambling Codex https://casino.guru/fair-gambling-codex-for-casinos#win-limits, we consider imposed win limit to be unfair and predator, only when it’s applied to a real money game, however, we accept bonus T&amp;Cs that restrict the maximum cash out from a bonus play.</p>
<p>Please understand that it is nothing unusual to have a maximum cash out applied to any promotional winnings. Do I understand correctly that you received a withdrawal of $500?</p>
<p>Looking forward to hearing from you.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
