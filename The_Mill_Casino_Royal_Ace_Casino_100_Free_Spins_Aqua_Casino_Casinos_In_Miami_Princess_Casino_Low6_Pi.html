    <h1>The Mill Casino Royal Ace Casino 100 Free Spins Aqua Casino Casinos In Miami Princess Casino Low6 Pi</h1>

<p>Sports technology company Low6 has teamed up with Sporting Minds UK in a bid to raise awareness for organizations that are making meaningful and positive changes in sports. A particular focus of the collaboration, and the charity, is to encourage and nurture positive mental health in sport, an industry that has known to face challenges in this regard.</p>
<p>Low6 Chooses Sporting Minds UK as Charity Partner</p>
<p>The sports gamification company is confident that Sporting Minds UK is the right choice of partner for 2022. Commenting on this collaboration, Low6 COO Jake Johnson welcomed the opportunity and said:</p>
<p>“Professional sports provide so much joy for all of us as fans, but the highly competitive environment can be very challenging mentally for all athletes.” Low6 COO Jake Johnson</p>
<p>Johnson added that Low6 recognized the “gap” in promoting and supporting the mental health of young athletes, for one. The partnership will benefit Sporting Minds UK as it would allow the company to push its support services, boost awareness for its products and garner exposure on social media channels and through merchandise, group training sessions and more.</p>
<p>Sporting Minds UK founder Callum Lea welcomed the opportunity and said that the organization was thankful to be teaming up with Low6 and become the company’s charity of the year:</p>
<p>“They have all been extremely supportive of the cause already and I can’t wait to see how they will go about raising funds and awareness for us throughout the year.” Sporting Minds UK founder Callum Lea</p>
<p>Sporting Minds UK has been helping athletes extensively. So far, the organization has assisted more than 1,000 athletes who have experienced mental health distress. The collaboration with Low6 will only help raise more awareness for the charity’s mission.</p>
<p>Mental Health of Increasing Importance in Sports</p>
<p>In the meantime, Sporting Minds UK has been able to add a number of prominent athletes as its ambassadors, including Cricket Club player Will Smeed and Welsh Rugby Union winger Louis Rees-Zammit.</p>
<p>Mental health has become an increasingly part of the betting and sports industries. KaFe Rocks, an affiliate service in the industry, said it would give employees unlimited paid vacation time so they can work through issues such as burnout or just boost their mental health.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Tyson Fury has refused to promote gambling, alcohol, or nicotine products arguing that he was aware of how hard these habits were to shake off and saying he would not line his pockets at someone else’s expense.</p>
