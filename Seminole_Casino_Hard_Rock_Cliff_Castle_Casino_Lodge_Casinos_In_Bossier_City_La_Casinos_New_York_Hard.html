<p>Casinos in Detroit are prepared to reopen on Wednesday, following an executive order by Governor Gretchen Whitmer allowing them to return back to work in a limited capacity.</p>
<p>Detroit’s Casinos Reopen Doors on Wednesday</p>
<p>Detroit’s casinos are planning to reopen this week, having been shut down for over a month. All three properties have laid down plans how the restart will take place and follow green light by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer who issued a reprieve for casinos and other entertainment venues, allowing them to return in a limited capacity from today.</p>
<p>This is good news as all three casinos have been bleeding cash, projecting $50 million in losses by the spring should they remain shuttered.</p>
<p>MotorCity Casino Hotel and MGM Grand Detroit have confirmed that they will restart operations on Wednesday whereas Greektown Casino is still trying to pin a date, and will have to “check back for an official date” first, the casino tweeted:</p>
<p>“As we prepare for our reopening, we ask that you remain patient while we continue to work with the Michigan Gaming Control Board, public health officials, state and local leaders. We look forward to opening a safe gaming environment for you soon.”</p>
<p>With Michigan moving towards a regulated gambling online gambling and betting markets, the state’s casinos are looking for ways to cushion what has been a moribund financial year, to say the least.</p>
<p>Results dropped by over 55% across all three Detroit properties for the first 11 months of the year, the Michigan Gaming Control Board (MGCB) reported. The current order will last through January 15, 2021. Further limitations may be introduced should need be.</p>
<p>Health authorities are limiting gatherings of more than 100 persons within any space with the sole exception of arenas hosting sporting events, where up to 250 persons may attend, an official order by the state explained.</p>
<p>The Slumbering Giants Awake</p>
<p>Reopening is good news for the casino business. Detroit’s casinos have had a lot of fits and start this year, a surely tiring and uncertain model of operation for any business. Results for both October and September were down significantly prompting physical casinos to seek a restart.</p>
<p>MGM Grand Detroit is opening up on 5 pm Wednesday and it will allow access to its slots and video poker machines and the BetMGM Sportsbook. Commenting on the reopening plans, Midwest Group President, MGM Resorts International, David Tsai said that the team is ready to welcome guests back. Visitors will have access to the 150,000 square feet of gaming space while complying with social distancing measures.</p>
<p>MotorCity Casino Hotel will restart earlier, though, with the reopening planned for 1 pm Wednesday. Customers will have to comply with mandatory face masks, social distancing, and temperature checks.</p>
<p>The city is also relieved to see casinos return, albeit at limited capacity. At the best of times, Detroit’s casinos have been contributing $600,000 in tax revenue for the city’s coffers per day. This amount has been greatly diminished in 2020.</p>
