<p>Habanero has strengthened its foothold on the European market by obtaining a business-to-business license from the Swedish Gambling Authority</p>
<p>The provider of world-class slot and table games popular in Western and Asian markets, Habanero, has expanded its presence on the Old Continent.</p>
<p>The company with a portfolio that spans no less than 22 worldwide markets thanks to a plethora of agreements inked with big operators like Betway, Entain, Sportium, and Sisal has been granted a new business-to-business license from the Swedish Gambling Authority.</p>
<p>Habanero, Authorized to Offer Its Entire Portfolio to Domestic Operators</p>
<p>According to the new license, Habanero is now allowed to provide its entire catalog of more than 150 HTML games including slots, video poker, and table games to operators in the area.</p>
<p>The list includes successful slots like Santa’s Village, Hot Hot Fruit, and Mystic Fortune Deluxe.</p>
<p>Commenting on the fresh Swedish license, Habanero’s head of business development, Arcangelo Lonoce, explained that the fact that they have been awarded a Swedish license was “both gratifying and exciting,” helping their plans to scale up their operations in the respective market.</p>
<p>The fresh Swedish license will also assist Habanero with its goal to sign new partnerships with fresh stakeholders in an attempt to introduce its universe of games to a larger number of players.</p>
<p>Lonoce called the new license “a testament to our dedication to our adaptability as well as our commitment” to explore and comply with new global regulatory landscapes.</p>
<p>Perfect Fit for the Swedish Market</p>
<p>Reevo’s head of sales, Petra Maria Poola, also commented on Habanero’s “diverse, boundary-breaking games” and their admirable fast expansion while commenting on the company’s ability to align with the continuous regulatory efforts in Sweden.</p>
<p>Poola also mentioned the recent Swedish Gambling Authority’s five-year license extension granted to Videoslots, which came in spite of the penalty that was imposed on the same operator because of a series of problems related to anti-money laundering compliance.</p>
<p>In mid-October, Habanero launched Slime Party, a fresh slot with multipliers and free spins. The developer also obtained an MGA license and a series of approvals in a number of global regions, including Romania, Panama, and Buenos Aires.</p>
<p>In June, the company was granted the prestigious ISO-27001 Certification that allows it to deploy more products and get licensure in individual European markets.</p>
<p>Habanero’s games work seamlessly across all types of devices and can be played in landscape and portrait modes on mobile. Players can also enjoy several games simultaneously, configure their jackpots, set up their preferred bets per game, and wait for new titles to be released every month.</p>
