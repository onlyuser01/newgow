<p>Golden Nugget Online Gaming (GNOG), an online casino and sports betting operator, has inked a new deal with Butler National Corporation and its Boot Hill Casino &amp; Resort team. The agreement will help Golden Nugget launch its sports betting offerings in the state of Kansas.</p>
<p>GNOG Inks a Deal with Boot Hill Casino</p>
<p>Butler National’s casino subsidiary will facilitate the foray of GNOG’s sportsbook into the Sunflower State. As per Kansas gambling law, Butler National’s gambling brand is allowed to ink agreements with up to three sports betting operators and offer their products at its Boot Hill Casino. However, the launch of GNOG’s sports betting content in the Dodge City-based venue is still subject to approval from the state’s regulator.</p>
<p>Kansas prepares to launch its own sports betting market on September 1, just in time for the next National Football League season. After the launch, all non-excluded adults will be able to place punts on sports and access the licensed sports betting operators.</p>
<p>Butler National Corporation received a license to offer sports betting a week ago. The Kansas Lottery allowed the company’s Boot Hill Casino to ink agreements with sportsbooks and offer their products at its premises.</p>
<p>Butler National’s CEO Is Excited about the Launch</p>
<p>According to a statement by Butler National, GNOG will offer sports betting products that are sure to appeal to sports enthusiasts. Butler National described its new partner as a recognized and established provider of sports betting. The former company is, therefore, happy about the opportunity to work with Golden Nugget and is looking forward to the launch of sports betting in the Sunflower State.</p>
<p>Clark Steward, president and chief executive of Butler National Corporation, is excited to see Kansas legalize sports wagering.</p>
<p>We’re excited for Golden Nugget Online Gaming to be able to bring Kansans a seamless, safe and premium sports betting experience through its Golden Nugget Online Gaming-branded sportsbook, subject to receipt of requisite regulatory approvals. Clark Steward, CEO, Butler National Corporation</p>
<p>Steward added that he believes the legalization of the sports betting vertical will improve the local economy and attract tourists to Dodge City and Kansas as a whole.</p>
<p>As Kansas prepares to launch sports betting, more and more companies are hoping to launch their offerings in the state. A few days ago, Catena Media, a renowned content and affiliate company, received approval to launch in the state.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Attorney General’s office disagreed with some of the proposed gambling regulations and sent them back to be fixed.</p>
