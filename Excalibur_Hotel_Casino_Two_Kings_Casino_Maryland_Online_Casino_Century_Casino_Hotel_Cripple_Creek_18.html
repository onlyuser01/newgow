    <h1>Excalibur Hotel Casino Two Kings Casino Maryland Online Casino Century Casino Hotel Cripple Creek 18</h1>

<p>Inter Miami vs Orlando City could be the decisive game for the postseason future of these two teams. The thing is that they both have 45 points, each with a 13-6-13 record, and are occupying the last two playoff spots in the Eastern Conference. Just behind them is Columbus Crew, a team with 45 points but with fewer wins (10-15-7).</p>
<p>What this means is that the winner of the Florida Derby would secure a spot in the MLS Playoffs. So, which team will win tonight, if any? To see what we think, make sure to read our MLS preview until the very end.</p>

<p>Inter Miami Hoping to Beat Orlando City for the First Time Since 2020</p>
<p>Inter Miami is currently in the #7 spot in the Eastern Conference, the last one that leads to the postseason. Unfortunately for them, Columbus Crew have the same number of points and is just one spot below. Inter Miami have more wins, meaning that if the two end the regular season on equal points, they will advance to the postseason.</p>
<p>What this practically means is that unless Inter Miami beat Orlando City, their playoffs fate will be decided by Columbus Crew. That said, you can be certain that Inter’s players are going to give their utmost to win the Florida Derby.</p>
<p>The big question is whether they have the manpower to pull it off. What needs to worry them is that they haven’t triumphed in the Florida Derby since October 2020.</p>
<p>Orlando City Must Not Lose Against Their Interstate Rivals</p>
<p>Orlando City only need not to lose against Inter Miami to secure a place in the MLS Playoffs. The good news is that they tend to do well in the games against their interstate rivals. The bad news is that their recent form isn’t great.</p>
<p>Orlando City lost three of their previous four games, conceding eight goals along the way. Their only win in September happened against desperate Toronto FC. Orlando beat them 4-0 at home.</p>
<p>Inter Miami vs Orlando City Prediction</p>
<p>Right now, Inter Miami look like a stronger team than Orlando City. Still, knowing how important this game is for both teams, we expect to see a real battle on the pitch. That said, we should see plenty of goals in Florida, with Inter probably getting the win in the end.</p>
<p>Picks: Inter Miami to win; over 2.5 goals</p>
