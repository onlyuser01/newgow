<p>Stakelogic has expanded its reach in the United Kingdom with the company signing a new content alliance with a leading brand in the market, Paddy Power Betfair. This collaboration will enable Stakelogic to deliver its award-winning games with a number of household names and brands in the UK market.</p>
<p>This is de facto the biggest content partnership Stakelogic has been able to negotiate, marking the long way Stakelogic has come as a developer of innovative games and products over the years, with the Flutter-owned company now reaching out to seek these innovative games as part of its own brand portfolio.</p>
<p>The games deployed by Stakelogic feature a range of excellent experiences, powered by 7s, BARS, and Bells, Multipliers, Free Spins, and Wilds Symbols and game features. In terms of specific titles Paddy Power Betfair players will experience, these include Money Track and Money Track 2, Treasures of Ra, Greedy Fox, and Spartans vs Zombies Megaways.</p>
<p>Each of these titles has been developed with the player in mind, delivering on experiences that online casino gamers appreciate and actively seek out in brands’ game libraries. Stakelogic also deploys cool features such as its own original Super Stake and Spin to Win options that are designed to bring players even more excitement.</p>
<p>All of this is underpinned by a robust Random Number Generator technology that allows players to also have safe gambling sessions online. Stakelogic CCO Olga Bajela welcomed the opportunity to work with Paddy Power Betfair and deploy the supplier’s games with the brand and its websites.</p>
<p>"That our games are now live with these renowned brands is a testament to the quality of our classic and video slots, and proof that they are in high demand in core markets such as the UK," Bajela said.</p>
<p>She added that the company is now looking forward to seeing how this partnership shapes up. In the meantime, Stakelogic has been expanding its global footprint at an enviable pace.</p>
<p>The company teamed up with 711 in the Netherlands and it expanded in Greece with Fonbet. The supplier also managed to gain a foothold in the Latvian market with Fenibet, and it has secured licenses to enter Pennsylvania and Sweden both.</p>
<p>Overall, Stakelogic’s commitment to creating solid gaming experiences has allowed the company to rapidly scale its presence in regulated markets and deliver some of the best products in each jurisdiction it operates in presently.</p>
