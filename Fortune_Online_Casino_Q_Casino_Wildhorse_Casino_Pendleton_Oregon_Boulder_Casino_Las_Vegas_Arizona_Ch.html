<p>White Hat Studios, a fast-developing iGaming content supplier has made another decisive stride in the regulated iGaming market in the United States. The company has confirmed that it is growing its North American presence through a successful license application in Connecticut, Casino Guru News learned via an email press release.</p>
<p>As a result, White Hat Studios will make its games available in the Constitution State for the first time. This means that operators that hold official licenses to operate in the state would also now be able to negotiate content partnerships with White Hat Studios and introduce a number of excellent games to players. White Hat Studios features more than 60 games that have been approved by GLI, a certified testing agency, and are compliant with local laws in Connecticut.</p>
<p>Some of the absolute best games delivered by White Hat Studios include branded titles such as Ted, The Goonies, and an upcoming slot released based on the acclaimed TV show Peaky Blinders.</p>
<p>The provider also brings the exciting Jackpot Royale mechanic which will provide players with brand features that allow them access jackpots and high-performing table games on top of the strong slot library the company already features.</p>
<p>White Hat Studios has been putting quite a bit of momentum in its US pivot. The company has already obtained licenses in New Jersey and Pennsylvania and launched its products there, with the most recent launch in Michigan, taking place in 2022. Connecticut is another important jurisdiction for White Hat Studios.</p>
<p>Commenting on this new opportunity White Hat Studios CEO Andy Whitworth said that the studio was determined to continue growing in the US market and provide operators within Connecticut with an extensive portfolio of fan-favorite games.</p>
<p>"We are the home to iGaming’s leading branded games, which are proven to attract new customers to an operator’s platform. We are confident that the launch into Connecticut will prove just as successful as our other state launches and are keen to see the reception they receive," Whitworth concluded, confident in the company’s future success in the Constitution State.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Casino Guru News spoke with White Hat Studios’ Daniel Lecher who said that the studio was a major disruptor in the iGaming sector by offering a strong variety to its players.</p>
