    <h1>Diamond Joes Casino Harrah S Ak Chin Casino Resort How Much Do Dealers At Casinos Make Casino In Tuc</h1>

<p>Good afternoon! Parimatch Casino unreasonably accuses me of violating the casino rules (section 80.4) and confiscated all my money in the amount of $2,745.</p>
<p>On April 9, the casino indicated the following violations:</p>
<p>one Client has several game accounts (multiple registration, multi-accounts), including under a new name. The Betting Company does not recommend making bets for two or more Clients from the same IP address (one device, local network);</p>
<p>one Client uses the data of other persons to register new gaming accounts, including members of his family;</p>
<p>bets are made by a group of Clients acting in collusion in order to circumvent the restrictions set by the Betting Company.</p>
<p>I do not agree with the accusations of the casino.</p>
<p>I only have 1 account at Parimatch casino.</p>
<p>I have not used other names to register at Parimatch casino. I live alone. My parents, who live apart from me, do not play in the casino. Distant relatives are not members of my family, and I cannot and should not track their gaming activity.</p>
<p>I play alone. I did not create any groups acting by prior conspiracy and did not take part in such groups.</p>
<p>I know the rules of the casino and the responsibility in case of their violation.</p>
<p>I declare that I did not and do not have the intention to violate the rules of the casino.</p>
<p>I did not commit illegal actions indicated by the Parimatch casino.</p>
<p>However, the casino allegations are very serious and offensive to me.</p>
<p>I ask for your help in resolving the dispute with the casino.</p>
