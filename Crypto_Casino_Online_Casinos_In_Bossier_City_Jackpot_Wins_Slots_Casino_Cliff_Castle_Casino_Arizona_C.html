    <h1>Crypto Casino Online Casinos In Bossier City Jackpot Wins Slots Casino Cliff Castle Casino Arizona C</h1>

<p>Bragg Gaming, a B2B gaming technology, and content provider continued with the talent shopping spree with the addition of Chris Looney as its Chief Commercial Officer.</p>
<p>Targeting North American B2B iGaming Space</p>
<p>The appointment of Chris Looney is set to add further depth to the global market experience already present at the company, which hired new CEO Richard Carter at the start of the year and brought industry veteran Lara Falzon to the Board of Directors.</p>
<p>“We’re thrilled to welcome Chris to our management team. He has an impressive track record of driving growth and success, and his extensive industry knowledge will be crucial as we continue to expand globally into key markets such as the U.S., the U.K., Italy, Canada and anticipated new market openings such as the Netherlands.” Richard Carter, CEO, Bragg Gaming</p>
<p>Chris Looney is bringing a wealth of industry experience, having served as commercial director at Red Tiger Gaming, where his contributions were vital for the company’s growth and success. Prior to joining Red Tiger, Looney held progressively senior roles at another online gaming technology and content provider, Microgaming.</p>
<p>Commenting on the appointment, Chris Looney outlined the opportunity presented to him by Bragg Gaming to become the company’s chief commercial officer as one he could not turn down.</p>
<p>“The company’s global presence and proprietary product and content portfolio in the B2B iGaming space provide a solid foundation for further expansion into new markets.” Chris Looney, Chief Commercial Officer, Bragg Gaming</p>
<p>Looney expressed his strong belief that Bragg Gaming is well-positioned to succeed in North American markets which continue to open up, regulate and evolve, and he would be more than happy to become part of the company’s expansion efforts.</p>
<p>Strategic Vision for Expansion</p>
<p>Serving as Bragg Gaming’s chief commercial officer, Chris Looney will be working closely with CEO Richard Carter for the development and execution of the company’s strategic vision for expansion in the region, including in the US, where regulated markets present huge opportunities for growth.</p>
<p>To announce its US ambitions, Bragg Gaming entered into a definitive agreement with Reno-based technology and content company Spin Games to acquire the game supplier in a combined $30 million cash and stock deal.</p>
<p>The Canada-based technology and content provider followed on the agreement with Spin Games by acquiring Nevada-based slot studio Wild Streak Gaming in another $30 million cash and stock deal in June, and Looney’s addition is expected to build on the momentum to help Bragg Gaming advance its position in the B2B iGaming space in the region.</p>
