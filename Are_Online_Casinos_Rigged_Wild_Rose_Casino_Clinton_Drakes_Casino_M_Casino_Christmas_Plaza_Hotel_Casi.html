    <h1>Are Online Casinos Rigged Wild Rose Casino Clinton Drakes Casino M Casino Christmas Plaza Hotel Casi</h1>

<p>I've never seen anything like it. For weeks, one deposit at the other in this casino has fizzled out faster than you can see, there seems to be no more chance of winning. It now really looks rigged (manipulated). Nothing works with all slot providers, the RTP seems to have been lowered to the lowest.</p>
<p>Free spins in short supply and when paying these extremely low. I feel betrayed by now. Something cannot go right there. The homepage also seems dead. The live chat is seldom available, there is no contact mail or the contact section straight away. I have the feeling that they only collect money from the "stupid" ones and don't offer anything in return.</p>
