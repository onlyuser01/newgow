<p>Nitropolis 2 review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>This sequel game is themed around a dystopian, animal-led world.</p>
<p>Set in a gritty city that will bring Blade Runner to mind, this game has a dark and moody atmosphere. On the reels, players will meet animal characters armed with deadly weapons.</p>
<p>Players will warily explore this strange world and try to keep up with the cutthroat canines.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>This game’s soundtrack is upbeat and filled with the autotuned vocalizations of a macabre host. Sirens and dog howling blend with the music to make it clear that players are in a crime-filled city.</p>
<p>The richly animated world is teeming with detail from billboards to a glinting blue light coming from each window in the backdrop’s buildings. Observant players will notice signs forbidding dogs from defecating while a rebellious dog does just that underneath the sign.</p>
<p>The fierce and sometimes cute dogs on the reels have plenty of character and are dressed for a street fight. Whether brass knuckles or a shotgun, these dogs haven’t left their toys at home.</p>
<p>Overall, the animation adds a lot of style to this world and the soundtrack ensures that players stay immersed in it.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Nitropolis 2 is a six reel, four row slot.</p>
<p>Wins are awarded for matching symbols in adjacent reels from left to right.</p>
<p>Through a cascade-like feature, symbols are part of winning combinations respin as individuals to allow a new symbol into the position.</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Bonus symbol.</p>
<p>The Nitro Reels fall over two symbol positions while containing 4, 6, 8, 10, or 12 paying symbols.</p>
<p>The Nitro Booster awards a variety of special features including:</p>
<p>Respins</p>
<p>Winning combinations paying in both directions</p>
<p>Increased Wilds</p>
<p>Increased high value symbols</p>
<p>Increased matching symbols</p>
<p>When players land 3 or more Bonus symbols, this triggers the Bonus Game. While in this feature, every Nitro Reel will remain in play for the duration of the free spins.</p>
<p>The number of free spins received in the Bonus game goes up depending on how many Bonus symbols have landed:</p>
<p>3 Bonus symbols = 10 free spins</p>
<p>4 Bonus symbols = 15 free spins</p>
<p>5 Bonus symbols = 20 free spins</p>
<p>6 Bonus symbols = 25 free spins</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 95%, well below our average yardstick of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.20 up to a maximum of $/£/€100 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is medium, which makes it a less ideal match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We do not recommend this low RTP, medium volatility dystopian animal-themed slot.</p>
<p>Despite a unique theme, this game’s RTP is far too low to be a good choice. The middling volatility does little to make this game appealing to strategy-minded players, so, unfortunately, it is one to skip.</p>
<p>The effort put into the animation shows and the bonuses are fun, but this does little good without the substance of better RTP and higher volatility.</p>
