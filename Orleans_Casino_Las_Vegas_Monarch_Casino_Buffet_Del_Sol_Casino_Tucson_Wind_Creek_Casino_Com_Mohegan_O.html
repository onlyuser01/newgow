    <h1>Orleans Casino Las Vegas Monarch Casino Buffet Del Sol Casino Tucson Wind Creek Casino Com Mohegan O</h1>

<p>My account was verified and I made a deposit to confirm account validation.</p>
<p>I played in the daily tournament three days in a row and won. Played the first winning balance down, lost. Yesterday 4/21/23 I played and won. I played the 1x rollover and had 74.00 leftover.</p>
<p>Then today I played the daily tournament and won again. However I used my tournament winnings from yesterday to add on to todays tournament to make sure I was in the top 10. (Top 10 players win 100.00 each)</p>
<p>I then played the 1x rollover to satisfy the requirement for withdraw. I withdrew 178.00 and left 30 dollars on account. I signed back in and hour later and my funds were reverted back into my account. No messages no push notifications about why it was reverted. So I made another request for withdraw and sure enough 30-40 minutes later it was reverted back into my account. I chatted with a rep asking what the problem was and she told me it was on the block chain and should be in my wallet. It wasn't. So I let her know I would wait a little while and if it reverts back again I would contact them.</p>
<p>I then played for a short while with my remining balance and with a 47.00 balance left it disappeared from my account and a message popped up telling me I don't have anymore balance. I checked my transaction menu and it read "manager withdraw/coindraw approved" on 3 withdraws for 47.00, 142.00,16 I directly got in touch with a rep and she next told me I forfeited my winnings because I used tournament winnings to add on to todays tournament and that is forbade. so they sent back my deposit amount for 16.00 and zeroed out my balance. I don't even get the winnings from yesterday.</p>
<p>This is unbelievable. Why don't they have a warning message that reads "can't use tournament winnings for add-ons on any other tournaments?" Or block the use of tournament winnings when trying to add-on to another to tournament. I think we both know why.</p>
<p>Here in lies the rub.... I played my tournament winnings in the regular casino in order to satisfy their 1x rollover needed to withdraw. So that money was free and clear. They want me to withdraw the funds I have on account. Then make another deposit on the site in order to have funds to use as add-on to the next tournament I play????? Why would they have that rule?? That makes absolutely no sense. it was my money, 1x rollover completed. It might as well have been a deposit but they use this rule to keep money honestly won. Then return my deposit amount so they don't look like thieves. Well I consider this a crime. I won the 2 tournaments fair and square. Fulfilled their 1x rollover and made a withdraw.</p>
<p>If I had not completed the 1x rollover I could at least understand it was a rule and I didn't read it so its on me. But I did complete what they asked of me and now they want me to withdraw said funds then make another withdraw??? Only thing that would do it cost me about 10 to 15 dollars in fees from my bitcoin wallet and the fees they collect on the site.</p>
<p>I hope this message reaches the proper channels. I've been playing online for years and I was skeptical at best about this site but I thought Id give it a try, it was only 15 dollars and the other sites I use don't have tournaments like this. Only blackjack tournaments and I am not a blackjack player.</p>
<p>I thank you in advance for anything you can do for me and reading my novel of a message.</p>
