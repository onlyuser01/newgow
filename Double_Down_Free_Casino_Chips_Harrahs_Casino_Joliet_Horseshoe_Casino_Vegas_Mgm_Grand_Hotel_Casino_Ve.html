    <h1>Double Down Free Casino Chips Harrahs Casino Joliet Horseshoe Casino Vegas Mgm Grand Hotel Casino Ve</h1>

<p>I'm just looking at your case. Your posts are showing up except the last 2. One includes sensitive data and the last one needs to be approved. You also mentioned that the email we gave you isn't working, but Petronela already informed you there that she received everything you sent without any issues.</p>
<p>From my point of view, you did 3 mistakes:</p>
<p>First of all, you, your aunt and your sister played in a casino with a very bad reputation (0.8/10), which I would never recommend to anyone.</p>
<p>Secondly, you mentioned in your complaint that:</p>
<p>"I opened this account for my aunt, but when I was registering I had mistakenly put my name instead of hers. I wanted to go back to change the name, but I was not able to do so."</p>
<p>Lastly, you used your aunt's card to make deposits on an account that was registered under your name.</p>
<p>This would be regarded as a breach of terms and conditions even by casinos with perfect ratings, because you can't open an account for someone else, you need to fill up all data correctly and you definitely can't use payment methods registered to other people on an account registered to your name.</p>
