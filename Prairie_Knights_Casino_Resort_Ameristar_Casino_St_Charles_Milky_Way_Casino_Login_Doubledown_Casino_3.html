    <h1>Prairie Knights Casino Resort Ameristar Casino St Charles Milky Way Casino Login Doubledown Casino 3</h1>

<p>Leading odds comparison site Oddschecker has announced that it has bolstered its ranks with the addition of Rob Painter as its new Chief Marketing Officer.</p>
<p>Return to Online Gambling</p>
<p>The appointment of Rob Painter as chief marketing officer (CMO) means a return of the former marketing director of Sky Betting &amp; Gaming to the online gambling industry. Painter, who will assume the CMO role on an interim basis, left the industry in September 2020. In his new role, Painter will report to Oddschecker COO Rob Wilson.</p>
<p>Commenting on the appointment, Painter said that his primary focus for the next 12 months would be to make sure the Oddschecker and WhoScored brands increase their resonance with recreational players in the UK. He asserted, “With this audience in mind, Oddschecker’s early foray into co-branded content has proven very successful and our efforts here will soon be bolstered by a purpose-built studio at Oddschecker’s Hammersmith headquarters. Oddschecker has one of the most sizeable and engaged betting audiences in the country.” He also stressed the importance to “champion safer gambling.”</p>
<p>Painter also has one year serving as CMO for the UK Tote Group under his belt, as well as five years as a marketing director at SBG in Leeds, where he had responsibilities with people, culture and marketing. He has plenty of experience in news, having spent more than 15 years in various roles dealing with insights, strategy and marketing at News International. He currently works as a consultant to the wider industry and serves as non-executive chairman at marketing and creative agency Fall off the Wall.</p>
<p>Oddschecker Changed Hands Recently</p>
<p>The odds comparison business founded in 1999 was a subsidiary of Flutter Entertainment, but in April of this year, reports surfaced that the gambling group hired the services of New York investment bank Moelis &amp; Company as an advisor to the sale of the odds comparison and bettor referral platform.</p>
<p>Consequently, Flutter Entertainment, which acquired the business as part of its merger with The Stars Group in 2020, decided to sell Oddschecker to US private equity group Bruin Capital for $215 million, of which $190 million as an upfront payment and another $25 million subject to undisclosed conditions.</p>
