<p>Zitro has signed another partnership for the deployment of its GLARE cabinet line with a prominent land-based operator in the Argentinian gambling market. Moving forward, the company will partner with Grupo Boldt, which holds a number of properties in the country, allowing Zitro to consolidate its international footprint once again, and put a particular emphasis on its Latin American expansion.</p>
<p>The company has already deployed 160 of its dedicated cabinets which will be spread across several casinos owned by Grupo Boldt, not least the properties in del Mar and Melincué, Santa Fe, and Trilenium. The games that will be available to players include the likes of Link King, 88 Link, Mega King, and other worthwhile titles, all of which are player-favorite and easily some of the most prominent games that players can enjoy directly on Grupo Boldt’s locations.</p>
<p>Zitro has said that the company is very happy with the latest rollout and is confident that its new releases will strike home with local players and help immerse them in engaging gaming offers and products. The news was welcomed by Boldt Entertainment Chief Operating Officer Gustavo Pernuzzi who said:</p>
<p>"By adding Zitro’s games to our slot portfolio, we have secured a product that will appeal to customers, while investing in a high-profit solution from a supplier with a strong and proven track record."</p>
<p>Pernuzzi was similarly hopeful about the future, arguing that Zitro and Boldt would be collaborating together in the long term. Meanwhile, Zitro’s Regional Director for Latin America, Alejandra Burato, was equally pleased with the opportunity to be teaming up with Grupo Boldt. Burato added that Zitro remained committed to further strengthening the company’s footprint in Argentina and ensuring that the supplier and manufacturer of state-of-the-art game cabinets remains a leader in the region.</p>
<p>Zitro has been in the news a lot in recent months, with the company gathering momentum in pivotal markets and seeking to expand its clout and reach in new places. The manufacturer has international clout in the land-based gaming sector and has delivered cabinets for Grand Casino Baden in Switzerland the company also expanded in the French gaming market in August.</p>
<p>Zitro has also been committed to limiting its environmental footprint, ensuring that the company remains focused on slashing CO2 emissions, and announced this year that it had reduced its carbon footprint by 80%.</p>
