<p>With the weekend packed with events, F1’s British Grand Prix will pit Max Verstappen vs. Lewis Hamilton. Here are their odds to win.</p>
<p>British Grand Prix 2021 Places Verstappen as Favorite</p>
<p>Before the big break in 2020, Lewis Hamilton seemed unstoppable, with the British racer winning one F1 event after another.</p>
<p>However, he is now on his longest winless streak, and while he still shows a lot of confidence, Max Verstappen seems to have stolen the limelight from him. Now, Verstappen is once again tipped to win the upcoming British Grand Prix, which will take place this Sunday, July 18, at the Silverstone Circuit.</p>
<p>As the rivalry between Verstappen and Hamilton follows its natural trajectory, we take a look at the available odds. All sportsbooks seem to agree that Verstappen is the favorite, but Hamilton is a close second.</p>

<p>Lewis Hamilton’s Performance Questionable</p>
<p>We have become too complacent, expecting Hamilton to win every race without a real challenge to his authority on the raceway. After finishing fourth in Austria a few weeks back, though, Hamilton will have to improve significantly to drive to victory at Silverstone Circuit.</p>
<p>Historically, it’s a race that favors him. In fact, Hamilton has the most wins at the raceway with seven total titles, which should give him the motivation and confidence boost he deserves to race to victory or at least a secure one at the podium.</p>
<p>Of course, placing in the Top 3 is still a little short of Hamilton’s fame. Verstappen has stepped up his game a lot recently, meaning that he will have strong opposition. After all, Verstappen took an entire season trailing Hamilton until he finally found that breakthrough that allowed him to establish his dominance this season.</p>
<p>Verstappen Posted as Favorite, But Is He?</p>
<p>Of course, Verstappen has worked long and hard, and this season, it definitely shows. He has won the Austrian GP and Steiermark GP for a hat trick of victories after the French Grand Prix, which he also won.</p>
<p>Be that as it may, Hamilton is intimately familiar with the raceway, but then again, Verstappen did win at Silverstone in 2020, meaning that he surely has the momentum to build upon. However, he never actually won a British Grand Prix on the track, with the last seven years results as follows:</p>
