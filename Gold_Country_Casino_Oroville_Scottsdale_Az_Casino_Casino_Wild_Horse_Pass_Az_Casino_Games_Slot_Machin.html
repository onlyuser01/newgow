<p>The Memorial Tournament this May will present fans of golf with a week of betPARX-branded fan experiences</p>
<p>Online betting and gaming brand betPARX announced its partnership with the Memorial Tournament presented by Workday and The PGA TOUR has launched mobile sports betting in Ohio.</p>
<p>‘Fast, Easy and Fun Experience’</p>
<p>The launch of betPARX in Ohio brings the betPARX’s mobile betting experience to the passionate sports fans in the state and marked the latest entry into the state that officially launched its market on January 1, 2023.</p>
<p>Thrilled to announce the mobile sports betting debut of the brand he works for, Matthew Cullen, senior vice president of Sports at betPARX, hailed the brand as “one of the leaders in mobile betting and iGaming in North America” and its “superb technology, products and best … marketing promotions.”</p>
<p>“We are excited to partner with the PGA TOUR and the Memorial Tournament to offer a fast, easy and fun experience for sports fans,” Cullen added.</p>
<p>betPARX partnered with The PGA TOUR last spring after legislators in the Buckeye State had passed the bill to legalize sports betting. Following the agreement, betPARX became an official betting partner of the professional golf series.</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to align with betPARX and to provide sports fans throughout the State of Ohio the opportunity to download the betPARX app and start placing bets on all sports,” said Dan Sullivan, executive director of the Memorial Tournament presented by Workday, adamant that the betPARX app will bring an extra impetus to Memorial fans and patrons during the week of May 29.</p>
<p>Branded Fan Experiences</p>
<p>Hosted annually at Muirfield Village Golf Club in Dublin, Ohio, the Memorial Tournament this May will have betPARX as its exclusive mobile sports betting sponsor for the second year in a row, and the operator is planning to offer branded fan experiences throughout the week of one of the leading tournaments on The PGA TOUR since its inception back in 1976.</p>
<p>The launch in Ohio will enable sports fans in the state to place wagers on golf, professional and college football, basketball, baseball, hockey, MMA, tennis, and soccer in a safe and secure betting environment and with a variety of betting and payment options.</p>
<p>To celebrate its entry into the state, betPARX is offering a special promotion for new bettors who place a minimum of $10 sports bet – if the bet wins, betPARX will give them $125 in sports bonuses. For all new users, there will also be an automatic entry into a drawing where one user every week will be awarded a $25 sports bonus.</p>
