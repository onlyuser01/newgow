    <h1>Map Of Biloxi Casinos Casinos In Montana Usa Pittsburgh Casinos Usa Casino The Brooks Casino Flutter</h1>

<p>Flutter Entertainment has decided to strengthen its board of directors by adding Carolan Lennon as a non-executive director. This announcement comes after Michael Cawley announced in February that he will be stepping down, together with fellow director Zillah Byng-Thorne.</p>
<p>Lennon’s Appointment Will Be Effective on July 1</p>
<p>Although the main news of the annual general meeting of Flutter was Cawley and Byng-Thorne’s departures, a follow-up announcement was made and that is when Lennon was appointed as the new non-executive director.</p>
<p>Currently, Lennon is working as both senior independent director and non-executive director at Allied Irish Banks, but she resigned from those positions, effective June 30. Hence, her new appointment at Flutter will be effective on July 1.</p>
<p>The current chair of Flutter, Gary McCann, commented on Lennon’s appointment and stated that the process of finding a new candidate was extensive and that he’s happy to welcome her as the new non-executive director.</p>
<p>McCann added that Lennon has tons of working experience working in consumer-orientated digital businesses in regulated markets and concluded by saying that her appointment is in line with the company’s growth process.</p>
<p>Back in February, it was also announced that Cawley’s place as chair of the audit committee of Flutter will be taken by Holly Keller Koeppel. Byng-Thorne will be replaced as Flutter’s chair of the risk and sustainability committee by David Lazzarato.</p>
<p>Flutter Recently Announced Its Strategic Future Plan</p>
<p>Recently, Flutter has outlined its future goals by launching the Positive Impact Plan, which is orientated on the company’s global goals through 2030. In this plan, Flutter named three key areas of focus. First off, it intends to improve the lives of over 10 million people by using “the power of sports and play,” as well as the skills of the team and the brand’s reach.</p>
<p>By 2026, Flutter aims to introduce the Play Well tools to over 50% of the users that will use at least one of the said tools. This number is set to increase to 75% by 2030. Finally, Flutter aims to create and develop teams that will represent the locations where the company works and lives via a DE&amp;I strategy.</p>
<p>Peter Jackson, the chief executive of Flutter, commented on the Positive Impact Plan by saying that this is a “comprehensive and challenging strategy” that paints out Flutter’s agenda for a positive change. He went on to say that through the three goals, Flutter wants to help customers play well, empower staff to work better and ultimately, work with the communities to do more.</p>
<p>Aside from the three main goals, Jackson added that the Positive Impact Plan outlines the need to reduce Flutter’s environmental impact.</p>
