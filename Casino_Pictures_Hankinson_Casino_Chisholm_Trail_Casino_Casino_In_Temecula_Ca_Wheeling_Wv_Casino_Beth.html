<p>Social betting platform Bethereum has posted several important milestones in October, 2019, including crossing the 1-million bets threshold.</p>
<p>Bethereum Recaps October with 1 Million Wagers Placed</p>
<p>Social betting platform Bethereum has posted its October 2019 recap, successfully accomplishing several important achievements last month. The company passed a long-anticipated milestone of over 1 million bets placed on the platform.</p>
<p>Similarly, the company pushed ahead with its 3rd F2P betting contest, allocating 12 million worth of BETHEREUM – the namesake token in prizes. As a reminder, the gaming platform supports a number of traditional sports and electronic sports.</p>
<p>Bethereum was also showcased during the CGC Kyiv 2019, one of the largest blockchain conference held on October 10 – 11. Bethereum Chief Executive Giacomo Tognoni presented the company in front of the crowd in Kyiv, discussing how gamification and social elements can lead to better engagement and retention in betting platforms.</p>
<p>The team also held the monthly Ask Me Anything (AMA) which shed light on important progress milestones, such as how close the company had come to obtaining a license that would allow it to launch in full.</p>
<p>Bethereum Close to Obtaining a License</p>
<p>Bethereum explained that all the necessary legal paper work has been completed and investors have okayed the go-ahead. Further, the company specified that it would never allow itself to run without the proper regulatory approval.</p>
<p>Tognoni explained that a number of blockchain companies had done just that and launched without a license, operating in a legal grey area. Bethereum was asked what the real value of Bethereum was in terms of how much money investors were prepared to commit, but the team specified the information was confidential.</p>
<p>Bethereum explained that while opportunities to add new verticals and sports were considered, for the time being the platform was perfectly happy with the number of markets that it had.</p>
<p>The company also marked another landmark partnership and started trading BETHER/EBASE on Etherbase. Bethereum also pointed out that the team has put in a lot of effort to keep the platform afloat during the period executives described as ‘crypto winter’.</p>
<p>Much of that success was owing to feedback from iGaming community members and investors who have helped Bethereum achieve better results despite limited resources.</p>
