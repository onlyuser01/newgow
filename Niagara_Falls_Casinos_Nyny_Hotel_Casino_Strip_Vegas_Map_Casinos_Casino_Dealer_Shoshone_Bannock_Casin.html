    <h1>Niagara Falls Casinos Nyny Hotel Casino Strip Vegas Map Casinos Casino Dealer Shoshone Bannock Casin</h1>

<p>HORRIBLE THIEVES AND LIARS. By the way, do you want a continuation of this story? Dear players, this casino will ROB you like it did to me! At first, they tried not to return my winnings to me, and wrote a letter that they would keep my winnings for themselves, and would give me only the deposit. BUT I just received a letter from them that they will not return my funds, including my deposits! 270 euros! Let me explain: the casilando.com company belongs to the casino group, which includes 5 casinos with one management. Therefore, I warn you against playing with these companies, with them your MONEY WILL BE IN DANGER. YOU WILL NEVER GET YOUR MONEY BECAUSE THESE COMPANIES WILL ROB YOU. So I registered with the 21casino company and sent them my passport and utility bill. After that I received a letter that my account was confirmed. I will attach the evidence in this comment below. And when I registered with the casilando company, I did not need to send my documents for verification again, because they have one family, and it is enough for them that I have already passed the verification on my 21casino account. And when it came to returning my winnings to me, in the amount of 396 Euros, casilando asked me to send again the same passport documents, a document confirming the address, and a selfie with my passport. I sent them the same documents that I sent to the 21casino company. And do you know what these THIEVES came up with? They wrote me a letter that none of the documents I sent them could be confirmed! You understand ? They accepted my documents at first, and when the conversation started about the fact that the player should be paid 400 Euros, they simply told me that they could not confirm my documents! The same documents. What it is??? Why then the first time they verified my account with the same documents??? I am asking the casino gurus to downgrade this family of companies because they are CHEATING THE PLAYERS and do dishonest checks, to embezzle players' funds I AM ATTACHING PROOF OF THIS BELOW!</p>
<p>If Casino Guru is interested. I can forward the letters that I sent to both companies for verification, so that you can personally make sure that I sent the same documents that I was approved for the first time, and which the casino casilando rejected with the explanation that none of the documents that I sent were accepted. So that you can check for yourself and understand that they are scammers!</p>
