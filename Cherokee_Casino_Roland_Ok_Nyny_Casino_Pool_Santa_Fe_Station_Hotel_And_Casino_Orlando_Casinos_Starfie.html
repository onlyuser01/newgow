<p>Evolution Gaming will supply BetMGM with state-of-the-art live gaming solutions as part of both companies’ push to secure a bigger share in the United States’ expanding live casino market.</p>
<p>BetMGM Secures Landmark Deal with Evolution Gaming</p>
<p>GVC Holdings and MGM Resorts joint venture, BetMGM, has teamed up with Evolution Gaming to roll out a live dealer portfolio across various markets in the United States where BetMGM is present.</p>
<p>Evolution Gaming will begin by launching a series of live table and live show games across BetMGM websites in the states where the brand has secured a license. Meanwhile, Evolution Gaming is building two dedicated studios in both Michigan and Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>That coincides with BetMGM’s own plans to roll out online casino operations there as well. Commenting on this tie-up between the companies, BetMGM Vice President of Gaming, Matthew Sunderland, had this to say:</p>
<p>“Evolution offers everything we need to enable our brands to roll out an extremely rich, world-class online live gaming experience across the US and their new state launches roadmap is very much in accord with our own alongside building on our current leadership position in gaming in New Jersey.”</p>
<p>He was joined by Johan Nordstrom, Evolution Gaming Malta’s chief executive, who said that the brand was honored to work closely with BetMGM.</p>
<p>BetMGM Seeks to Expand into New States</p>
<p>Evolution is also looking forward expanding into the US market for live games and to build up the existing relationship with GVC Holdings and the company’s brands. BetMGM has been looking to cement its position in the live segment just as well.</p>
<p>Previously, the company struck a partnership with Ezugi, which was later acquired by Evolution in January, 2019. The deal was announced late in November, 2018. Ezugi is committed to supplying the New Jersey’s live gaming market as the Garden State is one of the first to embrace online gaming. Yet, Ezugi is also expanding elsewhere.</p>
<p>BetMGM is also heading for West Virginia, another frontier state for online gaming. The company has teamed up with Greenbrier and intends to offer a range of casino games to residents.</p>
<p>BetMGM has also signed a string of pivotal partnerships. The company teamed up with VSiN to provide sports fans with a better sports betting coverage. In addition, BetMGM struck a partnership with NASCAR and the PGA Tour becoming both organizations’ authorized gaming partner.</p>
<p>BetMGM is one of the most active betting agencies in the United States, offering a mix of sports betting opportunities, online casino games and poker card rooms.</p>
