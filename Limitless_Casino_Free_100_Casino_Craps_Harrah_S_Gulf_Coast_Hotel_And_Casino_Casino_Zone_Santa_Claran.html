<p>Sports betting monitoring firm US Integrity and live content provider Spectation Sports have announced a multi-year partnership deal.</p>
<p>Focus on Regional Combat Sports</p>
<p>Sports wagering monitoring firm US Integrity Inc. (USI) has inked a multi-year partnership deal with Spectation Sports, the first live content provider to add sports betting odds to combat sports live broadcasts.</p>
<p>USI has been advising Spectation Sports since last year, as the content supplier sought states with broadcast-friendly sports wagering regulatory markets. Spectation Sports plans to develop its regional combat sports production portfolio with online sports betting firms looking for high-quality content over the next two years.</p>
<p>USI CEO and co-founder Matthew Holt said the company is excited at the opportunity to work alongside Spectation Sports, which has noticed the lucrative opportunities of the fast-growing market of regional combat sports. The content supplier understands that regional MMA, like minor league baseball, has a devoted fan base, Holt added.</p>
<p>“Legal, regulated wagering is another way to engage those loyal fans, but it’s critical that fans feel that their wagers are being monitored by an independent integrity provider.” Matthew Holt, CEO and co-founder of USI</p>
<p>Game-Changing Partnership</p>
<p>On March 27, Spectation Sports made history in the sports betting industry through its live broadcast of the Showcase MMA 17 from Kingsport, Tennessee, with the state’s Action 24/7 Sportsbook providing viewers with betting odds before the matches. Tennessee residents were able to connect to the Action 24/7 platform to put wagers with a single click and go back to the stream with one swipe.</p>
<p>USI provides its proprietary product to various teams, clubs, leagues, universities, as well as sportsbooks across the US. Customers can obtain access to hundreds of data sets, including account-level betting information, to spot potentially unusual wagering behavior and suspicious contest-level trends.</p>
<p>According to Timothy Stevens, Spectation Sports’ spokesperson, this deal with USI is a game-changer. USI is a perfect partner for the content provider because of their understanding of the regulatory system, partnerships with industry power players, and one-of-a-kind integrity services.</p>
