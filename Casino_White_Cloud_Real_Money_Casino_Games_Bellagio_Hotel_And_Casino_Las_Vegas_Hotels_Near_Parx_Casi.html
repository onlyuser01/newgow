    <h1>Casino White Cloud Real Money Casino Games Bellagio Hotel And Casino Las Vegas Hotels Near Parx Casi</h1>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>Since I have not received a single answer to 3 tickets for 3 days now, I see no other way than to file a complaint.</p>
<p>to the problem:</p>
<p>I received a May in which the said casino was advertised with a 100% bonus + free spins and I visited the homepage. When I registered and was still considering whether to give the casino a chance, I received an email from jinni in which 200% and 100 free spins on the first deposit had already been advertised. So I have a chance at the casino and paid the small sum of 12 euros. To my astonishment, there was only 100%.</p>
<p>So I looked for the live chat (which doesn't exist) and finally found at least one contact form. Completely relaxed, I reported that there was a small mistake.</p>
<p>I meanwhile looked around the site and found the wagering requirements € 12 bonus: € 0 / € 600 ..... in the terms and conditions it said 25x and in the email 40x that is 50x. So the next ticket opened and described or asked what the problem is.</p>
<p>I thought, then I'll just play the free spins while waiting.</p>
<p>None of the many isoft games worked, all of them stopped with an error (there is a problem with the game .... etc).</p>
<p>Now I felt like I was really shoved! The whole thing has been going on for 3 days now, without having received a single reaction.</p>
<p>Today I received an email from my "personal advisor" for the casino:</p>
<p>"As your personal concierge at Jinni, it is my job to always offer you the best service!</p>
<p>Since I have an individual offer as your personal advisor, I would also like to offer you another casino bonus on your next deposit with us, namely 100% bonus ! ....... "</p>
<p>Now I felt final, neither respected nor treated as a customer, and completely ripped off.</p>
<p>I still thought "ok, then I ask my concierge" so everyone explained again.</p>
<p>Well ... I don't need to mention that the mail has so far remained unanswered.</p>
<p>I am aware that this is a small sum. But I really think that NO casino should treat you like this</p>
