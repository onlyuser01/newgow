<p>By using Bet Easy, BetConstruct’s partners can get their own platform in 4 to 5 weeks</p>
<p>BetConstruct, a global award-winning technology and service provider to the iGaming and casino industry, has unveiled Bet Easy, a new cross-platform solution for creating mobile betting and gambling apps.</p>
<p>In line with BetConstruct’s dedication to constant improvement, Bet Easy seeks to revolutionize the betting and gambling apps landscape. Offering options for both iOS and Android users, Bet Easy allows its parent company’s clients to create engaging mobile experiences.</p>
<p>Bet Easy differs from traditional native app development as it doesn’t require two separate teams to work on operational systems. Instead, a single team can leverage BetConstruct’s latest solution to deliver a unified UI/UX across all mobile services. This improves the user experience while cutting costs for gambling operators.</p>
<p>In addition, Bet Easy provides a bunch of integration options to BetConstruct’s clients. Thanks to this, they can implement a variety of tools, such as Casino &amp; Sportsbook functionalities, Betinsights, Recommender, Chats and Personalization directly in their platform.</p>
<p>Bet Easy notably offers simple integration processes, making it intuitive to use. The user-centric app speeds up the overall process of setting up the app. One of its other highlights is a flutter feature that enables simultaneous development across multiple platforms.</p>
<p>By using Bet Easy, BetConstruct’s partners can get their own platform in 4 to 5 weeks, allowing them to meet their customers’ demands and remain ahead of the curve.</p>
<p>According to BetConstruct, the new solution enhances integration and engagement and improves gamification aspects. The rollout solidifies the provider as a visionary in the betting and gaming sector.</p>
<p>BetConstruct Continues to Innovate</p>
<p>In other news, BetConstruct also just launched iGaming Bot, an application designed to operate within Telegram. The solution integrates popular online gambling functions into the social platform and presents a “streamlined and accessible experience that complements traditional website and mobile application offerings.”</p>
<p>Another testament to BetConstruct’s drive for innovation, the product allows gamblers to enjoy multiple gaming-related features and services through the Telegram app. The iGaming Bot is backed by reliable functionalities, seamless deposits and withdrawals, and account and payment method verification. The solution also offers 24/7 live support to customers who encounter problems or have any queries.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, BetConstruct also embraced the Metaverse, launching BCverse, a solution that provides customers with the opportunity to transfer their business into the Metaverse. Earlier still, the provider signed an esports betting-oriented partnership with BETER.</p>
