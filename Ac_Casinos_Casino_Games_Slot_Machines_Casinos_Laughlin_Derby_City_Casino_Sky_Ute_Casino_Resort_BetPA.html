<p>Greenwood Gaming and Entertainment in collaboration with the world's largest online gambling software supplier, Playtech, announced the launch of betPARX, a mobile casino and sports betting app in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Greenwood's wholly-owned subsidiary betPARX offers retail sports betting services at the Parx Casino.</p>
<p>However, betPARX also offers best-in-class online/mobile sports betting and iGaming services in Michigan. Thanks to the recent launch, now the application is available in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Besides those three states, a launch in Ohio is expected to be completed soon.</p>
<p>Under the recent launch, Pennsylvania and New Jersey customers will have the option to choose from more than 50 Playtech titles. Such highly-popular games include Playtech's "Mega Fire Blaze" series. Moreover, the application offers live dealer games, as well as progressive slot games such as Cleopatra and Divine Fortune.</p>
<p>Residents of New Jersey and Pennsylvania can also enjoy table games and multiple third-party games from leading suppliers such as AGS, IGT, Konami and more. Sports betting fans will find compelling bet types as well as risk-free promotions.</p>
<p>With that in mind, Playtech's IMS platform offers operators a complete online solution that is applicable for sports betting as well as iGaming. This helps operators increase their offering and launch multiple products within different states.</p>
<p>Players who select betPARX can deposit and withdraw their funds at any time during the day. Additionally, the app features a secure sign-up process, while at the same time it is easy to use, fast and reliable. The new mobile casino and sports betting app is available for both iOS and Android for players located anywhere within New Jersey and Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Residents of the two states that create an account will receive a $20 free sports bet or a $20 casino bonus. What is more, new sign-ups within the two states can enjoy a free sports bet if their first bet was a losing one or benefit from a 100% deposit match up to $750 and 500 free casino spins.</p>
<p>In a statement released on March 16, betPARX's SVP of iGaming and sports, Matthew Cullen, outlined that the brand is proud to launch its services in collaboration with Playtech, the leading gambling industry software provider. He explained that betPARX offers simple sign-up, deposit and cash-out process.</p>
