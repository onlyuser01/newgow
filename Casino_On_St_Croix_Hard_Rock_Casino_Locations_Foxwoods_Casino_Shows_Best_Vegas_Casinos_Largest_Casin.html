    <h1>Casino On St Croix Hard Rock Casino Locations Foxwoods Casino Shows Best Vegas Casinos Largest Casin</h1>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I logged into my account and found that £33001.84 had been removed, when looking at the account statement on there site it seems as though it's been transferred to a debit wallet, the same sort of reference that appears from my withdrawals. The company are stating there t&amp;c 9.11 &amp; 7.12</p>
<p>Why would they have jackpots that can be won that go against there own t&amp;C's?</p>
<p>Any bonuses applied to my account were put on there by them as loyalty bonuses. I played through one of them thinking it would up my withdrawal amount, as it confusingly stated at the bottom</p>
<p>Honestly feel like I've been scammed, as they had no problem with taking my money and letting me spin thousands of winnings but when it came to withdrawals this is when they have taken it.</p>
<p>They left £2000 in my account.</p>
<p>Please any help would be much appreciated</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
