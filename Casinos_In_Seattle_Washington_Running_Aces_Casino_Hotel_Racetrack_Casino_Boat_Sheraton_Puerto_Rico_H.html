<p>Dear PJT,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint and forwarding all the creenshots. I’m sorry to hear about your issue. Please could you confirm that the promotion that you have activated is the following one: https://www.europacasino.com/promotions/easter-calendar? I have checked bonus terms and conditions, and this is what I found:</p>
<p>"Players can qualify for daily promotions between 03.04.2020 to 12.04.2020; promotions run from 00:00 until 23:59 GMT.</p>
<p>All Calendar offers require players to enter the relevant day’s Promo Code in the ‘Promo Code’ tab in the Cashier menu before player can begin meeting qualification for that day’s offer. Please see daily door T&amp;Cs for specific qualifying conditions.</p>
<p>All Calendar offers are valid only for relevant calendar day. Any remaining/unused bonus at the end of the day will be removed from the player's account. Any pending winnings still attached to the bonus with outstanding wagering requirements will be removed as well.</p>
<p>Winnings from Free Spins have a wagering requirement of x40 before they can be withdrawn. Please note only bets made on slot machines can contribute to the Free Spins Bonus wagering requirements.</p>
<p>All bonus wagering requirements must be met on the day of the offer."</p>
<p>If I understood it correctly, when you have started to play, you had approximately one hour to finish wagering requirements. Could you confirm that you have completed the wagering? I hope we will be able to help you to resolve this issue as soon as possible. Looking forward to hearing from you.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
