    <h1>Mohegan Casino Ct Casinos In Tunica Boomtown Casino Bossier City Casinos Cercas De Mi Osage Casino P</h1>

<p>I would like to place a complaint about unfair bonus rules, casino has been sending me a lot of promo communication for the past weeks (13 emails since being registered for 3 weeks) and suddenly I wasn't eligible to receive the bonus, quoting some buried unfair T&amp;Cs, that I've so far never seen anywhere else on the internet, as well as removing my winnings:</p>
<p>I've had only issues with this casino, their 3x wagering on cash deposits is a joke, some games cannot be used to wager a bonus (not specified in bonus T&amp;Cs neither).</p>
<p>They allowed me to redeem that bonus which was showing in the list of available bonus from their Bonus page, I could activate it in cashier and wouldn't have deposited if I knew that bonus was not available.</p>
<p>They also let me play with the bonus, which generated little to no winnings (60 FS on Secret City of Gold with no wager, for about 15 USD winnings).</p>
<p>I've continued playing on that machine until reaching the wagering requirement on the deposit (x3 deposit) at which point my balance was above $200, I've played it down to $125 and decided this would be enough. Withdrawal was initiated to bitcoin as I also use bitcoin to deposit.</p>
<p>If I had lost my entire balance while playing they wouldn't have said anything about not being eligible.</p>
<p>I find that rule extremely unfair to the customer and very vague (I "risk" loosing, meaning some may loose and some may be able to withdraw depending on their value I guess).</p>
<p>It should have been stated when I selected to redeem the bonus. As I said, I wouldn't have deposited without that offer and wouldn't have deposited this amount (offer had a min deposit amount attached to attract higher deposit).</p>
<p>Afterwards, I lost my "refunded deposit" trying to wager it again before being allowed to withdraw and closed my account with them and other sister casinos (which are also quite predatory).</p>
