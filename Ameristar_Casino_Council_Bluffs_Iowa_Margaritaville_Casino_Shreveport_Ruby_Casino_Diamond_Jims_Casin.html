<p>Genius Sports Limited has signed a new partnership with MaximBet, the sports betting platform, and company based on the popular lifestyle brand. Through this new partnership, the official data and technologyspecialist will be able to help MaximBet and provide the sportsbook with PreMatch, LiveData, and LiveTrading solutions, Genius announced.</p>
<p>All of these are delivered with the help of real-time feeds and pin-point pricing technology. These feeds will cover a number of sports followed worldwide, including NCAA, EPL, NFL, NASCAR, and FIBA. MaximBet will further have access to more solutions developed by the technology company, such as its NFL product suite, and access to real-time statistics.</p>
<p>The sportsbook will further benefit from Next Gen Stats, official sports betting data feeds, and more. Genius Sports is also an official partner to the Mid-American Conference, a Collegiate Sports division, which will feed MaximBet with even better insights as the college season unfolds and creates new betting opportunities in authorized states. Genius Sports will further deploy marketing solutions to assist with the company’s growth in the North American market and more.</p>
<p>MaximBet launched its first sportsbook back in September 2021, in the state of Colorado. Since then, MaximBet has rapidly scaled its offer across the United States. Welcoming the new partnership opportunity, MaximBet CEO and Founder Daniel Graetzer said that in order to continue to deliver a premium betting experience, the sportsbook would need to benefit from the best exclusive content, which is precisely where Genius Sports comes in. He continued:</p>
<p>"We are the only true lifestyle sportsbook, offering players incredible, money-can't buy access to MAXIM parties, courtside seats, and more. Combining that with the real-time data our players need gives them a full offering not found elsewhere in the marketplace."</p>
<p>Genius Sports’ EVP North America, Sean Conroy, was similarly pleased with the opportunity and said that the company will help play an important role in securing MaximBet’s long-term objectives which are to achieve sustainable and better growth in the North American market.</p>
<p>This partnership comes in the context of Genius Sports’ strong second-quarter financial results which saw the company continue to surpass expectations and its EBITDA guidance. Genius Sports has been collaborating with a number of other companies as well, including Bally’s Interactive signed last month.</p>
<p>Genius Sports agreed to provide Bally’s with data and leading streaming solutions to help improve its standing in the market and reach new audiences. The company remains a fixture for sports data solutions and a trusted partner to leagues, sportsbooks, and sports teams.</p>
