<p>888’s director of business development, Yariv Lavi, has decided to bid farewell to the company where he spent more than 13.5 years</p>
<p>Yariv Lavi took to his social media to make the big announcement. The “highly experienced International Business Development executive” who specializes in finding, assessing, and implementing strategic deals has shared that he would be “leaving #888 this week” at the end of what he described as an incredible journey.</p>
<p>Lavi, “Appreciative for the Opportunity” to Be Part of the 888 Team</p>
<p>Speaking about his rich experience with the company, Lavi praised his collaboration with his “talented” managers and colleagues from whom he had a lot to learn while expressing his pride regarding the results they achieved together over the years.</p>
<p>Among other responsibilities that he has as part of the group, the Tel Aviv University graduate was responsible for leading 888’s first acceleration program and creating fresh alliances and strategic partnerships aimed at helping the company penetrate regulated markets.</p>
<p>During the same announcement, Lavi expressed his gratitude for being given the opportunity to collaborate with some of the most reputable gaming operators worldwide while also working together with “amazing partners across the industry.”</p>
<p>He also took the opportunity to thank everyone who has made his time at 888 “so special” and wish them good luck in the future while looking forward to seeing what the future has in store for his own career path.</p>
<p>From November 2009 onward, Lavi has been in charge of corporate development, product business development, commercial leadership, initiating and leading re-negotiation rounds for high-profile product agreements, including a deal with an important games platform that generated a year-on-year saving of 25% and up to $1.5 million per annum, and business development.</p>
<p>Some of his most noteworthy achievements count helping 888 acquire William Hill’s non-US assets last July or supporting the group with its growth plans in international markets.</p>
<p>Before joining 888, Lavi was BVR Systems’ marketing director, Israel Aerospace Industries’ sales director, and Spacecom’s marketing manager.</p>
<p>888 Team Bidding Farewell to Lavi</p>
<p>888’s chief executive officer, Bjorn Krantz, recalled their first content deal they inked over a decade ago deal on New Year’s Eve, calling it “a true pleasure to have been connected all this time” while wishing Lavi the very best in his upcoming next adventure.</p>
<p>888 Holdings’ chief product officer, Roee Peled, also wished Lavi good luck while speaking about the “big impact” that he made on their gaming products and saying it has been “great” working with him for so long.</p>
<p>Dror Altman is another important 888 Holding figure who has been part of the group for over 12 years as director of economic analysis and performance, and director of commercial and financial planning and analysis, among others. Altman also replied to Lavi’s announcement, saying it has been “a pleasure” working with him over the past years “pushing 888 with many business opportunities and deals.”</p>
<p>Former 888 Holdings CEO Itai Pazner also wished Lavi “lots of luck” in his new path while describing him as a genuine asset to 888 and praising his negotiator skills that landed the group “some of the best gaming/betting provider deals in the industry”.</p>
<p>Towards the end of March, 888 announced a media partnership agreement with Wavemaker for UK brands.</p>
<p>For the time being, the UK Gambling Commission has put 888 Holdings’ operating license under review as a result of alleged bribery accusations under investigation.</p>
