<p>Galaxys has inked a new partnership agreement with Mostbet, agreeing to provide the popular platform with its Skill and Fast Games</p>
<p>The 2009-launched Mostbet sportsbook platform that also offers casino services currently gathers more than one million customers spread across 93 countries. With the help of the newly signed agreement, the platform will now put Galaxys’ cutting-edge games on full display for its impressive database of players.</p>
<p>Galaxys, “Happy” to Start 2023 with the New Partnership</p>
<p>Galaxsys’ head of sales Teni Grigoryan has expressed the company’s excitement to begin the year by going live with Mostbet. Grigoryan called Mostbet a brand with a “wide presence and strong roots in many markets.”</p>
<p>Moreover, the head of sales called Galaxys’ games an ideal addition to Mostbet’s current offering while expressing confidence in the new partnership’s ability to make their numbers “grow firmly.” Grigoryan also spoke about the shared goal of constantly delivering exactly what players want that the two companies have in common.</p>
<p>Galaxys’ senior vice president of sales and business development Gil Soffer stated that the company was expecting “mutually successful cooperation” that would introduce their Fast Games and Skill Games to a larger number of passionate gamers.</p>
<p>Mostbet on the Road to Success via Hard Work</p>
<p>Soffer also discussed Mostbet’s “exceptional position in the betting industry” that, to his view, is a direct result of numerous years of hard work put in by the company that constantly follows the freshest trends in the online gaming and betting sphere. With the help of Galaxys’ Skill Games and Fast Games, Mostbet can expect to reach even more fresh markets worldwide while increasing its profit and revenue.</p>
<p>Galaxys’ Skill Games require players to use a mix of skills and luck and they are presented as cutting-edge products created with the help of state-of-the-art technologies and a talented and experienced team of pros. The list includes titles like Hexagon, a freshly developed strategy board game, Backgammon, a game of skill and strategy, Dominoes, a mix of skill and luck, Pasur, a fishing card game with origins in Persia, and Hokm, an engaging trick-taking card title.</p>
<p>Galaxys’ Fast Games have been created to enable partners to boost their offering while generating more growth and improving their player retention and player acquisition policies. Sic Bo, Keno, Hi Lo, Keno Express, Blackjack, Penalty, Crash, Rocketon, and Cash Show are the hottest Fast Games available on the Galaxys platform.</p>
<p>F Mines, a diamond-based game, Plinkoman, a game that promises simple gameplay and easy wins, Golden Ra, a game meant for players who don’t mind taking higher risks for higher payouts, and magic-themed Mr. Thimble are upcoming Fast Games announced by Galaxys.</p>
<p>These fast-paced games can be integrated with ease and they are accompanied by a management platform that is packed with features. These features are meant to help partners smoothly rule, set up, and supervise their businesses and reach their goals.</p>
<p>Last week, Galaxsys agreed to provide its content to the Powered By Relax aggregation platform.</p>
