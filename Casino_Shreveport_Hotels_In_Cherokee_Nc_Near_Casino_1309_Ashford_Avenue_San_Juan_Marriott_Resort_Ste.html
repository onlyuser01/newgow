    <h1>Casino Shreveport Hotels In Cherokee Nc Near Casino 1309 Ashford Avenue San Juan Marriott Resort Ste</h1>

<p>Global betting operator and tech provider Parimatch has signed a new partnership to reaffirm its position in the esports industry through 00NATION, an esports team, and organization. The partnership is effective since October 1, 2022, and clearly outlines Parimatch’s stronger commitment to the competitive video gaming vertical.</p>
<p>Through this contract, Parimatch will have access to 00NATION’s exclusive rights. The partners will work on a series of market activations to boost awareness and extend the reach of their products, striking home with fans as they go along.</p>
<p>Parimatch Tech Head of Esports Stepan Shulga was pleased with the partnership and welcomed the opportunity for his company to be teaming up with 00NATION. "This collaboration will help strengthen our ties with the international esports community and provide users with the best of both betting and esports worlds," Shulga noted.</p>
<p>Shulga argued that both Parimatch and 00NATION have something he described as a "fighting spirit" that will no doubt lead to meaningful opportunities for both organizations. In the meantime, 00NATION has been present in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.</p>
<p>The team has fairly modest winnings of $17,625 according to Liquipedia, an open public source that tracks the esports progress of individual teams and players across a number of video games. 00Nation has been established in July 2021, and the team already has a respectable following, enough that it seems to pique Parimatch’s interest.</p>
<p>The team is also confident that thanks to this Parimatch support, it will be able to continue expanding its reach in the Americas, its preferred stomping ground, with 00Nation Head of Americas Ricardo Sinigaglia welcoming the opportunity as well. He noted that Parimatch has been a committed backer of esports growth and initiatives and was honored that the company had chosen 00Nation as its latest partner.</p>
<p>Sinigaglia assured that 00Nation was stoked about this opportunity and that the team was looking forward to new opportunities to realize in esports together with Parimatch. Parimatch has been a vocal supporter of esports and an outspoken critic of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The company has continuously offered financial support to Ukraine.</p>
<p>Esports have become an increasingly important part of the betting industry. During the latest SBC Summit Barcelona 2022 which Casino Guru News attended, there were a number of panels focused exclusively on the growing role that competitive video gaming plays in the industry. Many industry specialists said that it was high time that we invested in the vertical.</p>
