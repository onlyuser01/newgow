<p>Betfair International, an international FTSE 100 sports betting and gaming operator, has reinforced its team with a new brand ambassador. The one joining the company is none other than Ronaldo Nazário a retired Brazilian striker.</p>
<p>Ronaldo Joins the Betfair Family</p>
<p>The deal will see Nazário will serve as an ambassador and will promote Betfair’s brand. As an ex-soccer elite, the operator’s new partner will be a valuable asset. His expertise will help Betfair connect and engage fans of the sport. In his position as an ambassador, Nazário will be joining Rivaldo Vítor Borba Ferreira, another former Brazillian soccer professional and Rivaldo’s former teammate.</p>
<p>Betfair acknowledges Ronaldo’s great contribution to the history of professional soccer. In a celebration of its partnership with the former star, the operator uploaded a promotional video where it highlights the former pro’s feats.</p>
<p>The soccer legend will officially step into the position of a brand ambassador on June 30. This date holds a huge significance as it marks 20 years from when Brazil last won the World Cup. Back then, the striker himself scored two of the goals, helping his team grab the victory.</p>
<p>As a player, Ronaldo played for Brazil’s National team, as well as with Inter Milan (1997-2002) and Real Madrid (2002-2007). As part of Real Madrid, the player helped the team win the prestigious Ballon d’Or two times (once in 2002 and once in 2006).</p>
<p>“Fans can expect a lot of news from Betfair and Ronaldo”</p>
<p>Ronaldo spoke about his new position as Betfair’s brand ambassador. He admitted that this is an honor to him as he will be able to once again “wear the same shirt as Rivaldo” – something they haven’t done in 20 years. Because of this, Ronaldo is sure that the partnership with Betfair will be fruitful. He hopes that it will bring a lot of value to fans of professional soccer.</p>
<p>In a year of World Cup, fans can expect a lot of news from Betfair and Ronaldo together, every result is possible. Ronaldo Nazário, brand ambassador, Betfair International</p>
<p>Kimberley Daly, the managing director of Betfair International, welcomed Ronaldo to the Betfair family. Daly said that the Betfair team is glad to have Ronald on board and can’t wait to work with him.</p>
<p>With such high-caliber ambassadors, Betfair gets closer to Brazilian sports fans and bettors, and we are keen to deliver the most premium experiences a betting company can offer. Kimberley Daly, managing director, Betfair International</p>
<p>The agreement with Ronaldo is Betfair’s way to prepare for the upcoming World Cup in Qatar. The event will kick off on November 21 and will provide tons of soccer content to watch and bet on.</p>
