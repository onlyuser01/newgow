    <h1>Virginia Casinos Casino In Spokane Wa Shreveport Casino Yaamava Resort Casino San Manuel Blvd Highla</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>In that case we would like to say the things from our point of view. We believe that we followed all the legal procedures according to our Terms and Conditions, with faithful and respect to the player.</p>
<p>The mention player he did his registration to our casino at 19/07/2022. At 13/08/2022 he send an email to support@godbunny.com and he claimed that he send us some mails threw the contact form on the casino. After investigation we found an email where he was asking a Cashback bonus and what about our "Store".</p>
<p>We answer to him the same day, offering to him some Free Spins and we informed him that we was in processing to add some rewards in our "Store" section.</p>
<p>Furthermore he still insist that he send us some mails, which we couldn't find them and we informed him that we didn't received something else. He never send us any proof for that mails, he only said that was for "Self - Exclusion". We informed him immediately that according to our policies, if he want to self exclude his self he will not be able to reactivate his account before a minimum period of 6 months.</p>
<p>At 14/08/2022 we proceed with deactivation of his account, and we informed him. At 16/08/2022 he send us again an email asking for the mails which he claimed that he send threw the site form, where we already informed him that in our database we didn't found something, we mention to him again that his account is deactivated.</p>
<p>At 13/10/2022 the mention player he contact us, with the bellow message:</p>
<p>"Hello, i would like to be able to get into my account to use my points that i've accumulated through deposits thank you"</p>
<p>The same day we informed him that according to our Terms and Conditions we cant reactivate his account in less period of 6 months.</p>
<p>Furthermore on 13/03/2023 he asked again for re open sending the bellow message:</p>
<p>"Hello, my account should be reactivated/open but it's currently not, its been over the 6month period since i closed it on 14/08/2022"</p>
<p>On 14/03/2023 and 15/03/2023 he continue to send us mails with request to reopen the account and at 17/03/2023 we received one more mail with request to reopening the account.</p>
<p>According to our checks and because he never mention to us at the past any gambling addiction or something special reason for the Self Exclude, we answer to him at 20/03/2023 that his account is open again, after the passing period of 7 months.</p>
<p>The next days we was having communication, he was asking for Bonus, for Cashbacks etc but he never mention a Gambling Addiction issue, till the 31/03/2023 where he send an email to our Complaints Department, where for first time he was informing about Gambling Addiction, mention that he didn't withdrawal any funds even if he win big up towards 6,000 euros.</p>
<p>On that email he was asking to return him the amount of 2,969.77 euro.</p>
<p>We answered back to him, informed him that his message was forwarded to our legal department and we ask him to confirm that he agree to disable his account. Once he confirm that we closed his account.</p>
<p>At 04/04/2023 with the confirmation he write also to us "In regards to the legal department is there any update from them in relation to this? I would like to settle them between us but if not i will have to take the CEG route and lodge an official complaint through their license".</p>
<p>We informed him that his account is permanently closed and we would not accept him anymore as a player, we mention to him that we follow all the legal procedures and that he never said about any addiction before, in addition he was asking us self-exclude because he didn't manage to win. Furthermore we informed him, we was believing that he was trying to blackmail us because we refuse his last request for Cashback bonus.</p>
<p>At the same day he answer back, saying that he was agree that one of the reason for account closure was because of Cashback bonus. He insist also that he mention before for Gambling Addiction, but we never received any mail in the past and he never provide us with evidence that he send us that mails.</p>
<p>At 04/04/2023 we answer to him back, mention again the closure of account and that in according to help him with gambling addiction we will not answer to him again.</p>
<p>We strictly believed that we react and we follow all the legal procedures. We wouldn't have any problem to return the funds if we was doing something wrong from our site, but we strictly believed that the behavior of this player and that complain is just a method to take back the funds where with his responsibility he was playing.</p>
<p>We are ready to provide you with all the conversations with that player from his registration day till 04/04/2023 where we stop to answer to him.</p>
<p>P.S. His last deposit was made at 31/03/2023, before to ask Self-exclusion.</p>
