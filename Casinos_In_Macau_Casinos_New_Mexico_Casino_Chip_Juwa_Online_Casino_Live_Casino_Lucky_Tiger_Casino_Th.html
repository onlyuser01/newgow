    <h1>Casinos In Macau Casinos New Mexico Casino Chip Juwa Online Casino Live Casino Lucky Tiger Casino Th</h1>

<p>I got sent the so called proof of me apparently betting over requirements but I no that there made up game sheet wasn't acaraute because I No I didn't do those bets on first bonus...as a matter a fact when I first started playing I bumped it up to 6.25 and played three times on pinguin palooza and I should of gotten paid pretty good on those spins on that high of a bet but I got paid nothing instead so the game wouldn't let me bet over 6.25 at first so I just thought that was because it was set like that automatically because of the bonus game...and I also hit for I wanna say 12.00 0r 1300.00 as well on palooza right about the same time I made the 6.25 bets and I didn't play the pig game until the very end of me even playing and for some reason none of that shows anywhere on the documents they provided to me...but with that being said I already can see how this is going to end and most definitely not like it should cause let's face it I don't have the proof to show otherwise...so with that being said thank u anyways for your time and effort but y'all should really change y'all's reviews on them it don't look good for y'all to say they have a good reputation...which they have a good rep due to good games but that's it paying out, good customer service that don't lie to u and be rude should of played a bigger part in evaluation since that's what means the most when playing on line not the graphics and bonuses etc...u can go ahead and close this complaint out not going to waiste and more time playing these games with lucky tiger...it is what it is</p>
