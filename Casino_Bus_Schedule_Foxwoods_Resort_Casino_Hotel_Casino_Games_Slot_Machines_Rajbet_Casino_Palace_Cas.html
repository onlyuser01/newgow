    <h1>Casino Bus Schedule Foxwoods Resort Casino Hotel Casino Games Slot Machines Rajbet Casino Palace Cas</h1>

<p>Good afternoon,</p>
<p>I found your email on a forum online and I am wondering if you could help me. I deposited €40 with casino765 to receive a 300% deposit bonus (total €160) with wagering x45 total €7,200. There is an option on the website to view tour bonus status and how much wagering is remaining. From the get go this has been the status</p>
<p>As you can see the deposit is showing as 0, even tho I deposited 40. This has meant that it isn’t accurate of what I have wagered, after spending a few hours on slots and sure I would have wagered it all this still hasn’t changed. I decided to download the game history onto excel and sum how much I have wagered, which totalled over €10,000. My balance is now still split between bonus money and real cash. The customer service online chat has been very unhelpful and advised the email support, I have emailed 4 times and had no response. The slots I played and within the terms and conditions with 100% contribution. Please could you help or give advise</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>
