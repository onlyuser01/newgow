    <h1>Buffalo Bill S Resort Casino Treasure Island Casino Welch Mn Rising Sun Casino Route 66 Hotel Casino</h1>

<p>I have been registered at Casino Classic for about 2 years and in May 2021 I won the above sum after making a deposit at various games. I was repeatedly asked for new forms (passport, driver's license, bank statements, etc.) for payment</p>
<p>and that went so far that in the end they asked me to do them</p>
<p>Announce my deposit number. I was perplexed by such a claim, since everything appears when I pay the casino. I also have to say that I am smaller</p>
<p>I got the winnings paid out by the casino without any problems! As a result, the amount paid out was transferred back to the gaming account, which meant so much to me that I didn't get the money.</p>
<p>There was no response to e-mails, chat calls and phone calls. I have</p>
<p>Still trying to get in touch with the casino, but that was impossible. Ask for an answer!</p>
