<p>Continuing its expansion across the US, EveryMatrix announced it has gone live with DraftKings in New Jersey</p>
<p>The provider of content, services and iGaming software for sports betting and casino operators, EveryMatrix, continues its US-facing expansion after announcing a new collaboration. The company confirmed Tuesday it has gone live with the leading betting and iGaming operator, DraftKings, delivering its engaging content for customers in New Jersey.</p>
<p>A statement released by EveryMatrix reveals that the launch of the company’s content with the operator was facilitated via SlotMatrix, its leading business-to-business (B2B) aggregation and content provision offering. Besides New Jersey, the company currently holds licenses in other strategic US markets such as West Virginia and Michigan, as well as important North American jurisdictions like Ontario in Canada.</p>
<p>Only recently, EveryMatrix secured a license for Connecticut, while it is also after obtaining one for the market in Pennsylvania. In light of the latest launch with DraftKings in New Jersey, the company confirmed that it plans to expand to more jurisdictions across the United States by the end of this year, subject to regulatory approval.</p>
<p>Thanks to the recent launch, DraftKings customers in New Jersey will be able to experience EveryMatrix’s games such as Armadillo Goes West, Mythological Mayhem Supreme Streaks, as well as Fortune Dragon Queen Exotic Wilds. Players in the state will also have the option to tap into recent hits, including Wild Willy’s Gold Rush and Hot Hot Honey, among other popular and engaging titles.</p>
<p>The Company Continues Its Global Expansion</p>
<p>The launch with DraftKings in New Jersey comes during a busy period for EveryMatrix. Only recently, the company confirmed it secured an international B2B license from the Isle of Man. This B2B software license enables the company to expand significantly the reach of its technology and services to new markets and partners around the globe.</p>
<p>Before that, EveryMatrix signed a deal with ELA Games, a leading provider of content for the online gambling vertical. Per that deal, the provider of iGaming content agreed to bring its games, powering EveryMatrix’s CasinoEngine aggregation platform. This partnership enabled the fast-growing developer to reach new audiences and strengthen its position within the iGaming vertical.</p>
<p>“Integrating our content with market leaders DraftKings is a significant milestone for our U.S. business and we’re delighted to be working with the team there.“ Erik Nyman, president EveryMatrix Americas</p>
<p>Erik Nyman, EveryMatrix’s president of Americas, shared his excitement about the recent integration with DraftKings. He explained that the collaboration represents an important milestone for the company’s growth in the country. Additionally, Nyman confirmed that EveryMatrix remains committed to joining forces with leading iGaming operators across the US and bringing them its leading content via SlotMatrix.</p>
<p>Speaking about SlotMatrix, he explained that it offers the “largest games library and game-changing promotional features” in the world. Finally, Nyman said that EveryMatrix is excited to continue growing its presence in North America.</p>
