    <h1>Longhorn Casino Hotel Topeka Casino Casino In Gulfport Ms Poconos Casinos Golden West Casino Eventus</h1>

<p>Eventus International has reminded interested parties of one of the most highly-anticipated gambling industry gatherings in South Asia. SPiCE Sri Lanka 2023 is due on July 26 – July 28, 2023, and it’s expected to gather some of the most prominent industry specialists from the region and beyond.</p>
<p>The event has set out to redefine gaming in the region and see how it can be paired with the tourism industry. Apart from gaming, SPiCE will discuss betting and invite C-level speakers to help discuss the particularities of regional gaming. Held in Colombo, Sri Lanka, the event will span the course of three days and will seek to bring value to participants in different ways.</p>
<p>For example, Day One will start with "SP’iCE’s Breaker Welcoming Reception" which is designed to be a social pre-event gathering during which delegates can come together and discuss anything they want to over drinks, food, and entertainment.</p>
<p>Day Two will then broach the more serious and focused topics and discussions. During the day, delegates will learn more about the future of land-based casinos and the fast-evolving lottery sector in the jurisdiction and the region as a whole. The day will see a number of respected local experts participate, including PM International’s Dmitry Belianin and Shweta Dubey of Aadhya Digital Marketing.</p>
<p>Day Three will then see more topics front and center with expert speakers in attendance, including Navneeth Srinivas, founder of Metamine Gaming, and Asmita Guptafrom Spectatr. The delegates and speakers in attendance have already hailed the event as a significant way to bring the region’s best and brightest together and help shine a light on gambling in Sri Lanka and beyond.</p>
<p>Registrations for the event will remain open until July 21, 2023, giving companies and industry specialists interested or keen to attend sufficient time to pounce at the opportunity. SPiCE Sri Lanka 2023 already promises to be an important stop on the iGaming calendar, and especially if you are looking to deepen your knowledge of the region.</p>
