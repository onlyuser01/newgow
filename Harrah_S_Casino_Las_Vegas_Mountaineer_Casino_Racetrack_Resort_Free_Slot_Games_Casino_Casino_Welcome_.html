<p>The global gaming, sports betting and entertainment provider, Flutter Entertainment plc, released its latest trading update, covering the three months ended September 30, 2023. Released Thursday, the new unaudited results reveal that the company’s total revenue in Q3 this year hit £2.04 billion ($2.5 billion). A comparison to the £1.89 billion ($2.32 billion) result from the corresponding period in Q3 2022 shows a year-over-year increase of 8%.</p>
<p>Providing a breakdown, Flutter revealed that its revenue from sports operations for the latest trading period hit £1.12 billion ($1.37 billion), down by 2% year-over-year when compared to the result from Q3 in 2022. On the other hand, the company’s gaming revenue in Q3 this year soared to £914 million ($1.12 billion). A comparison to the same period in 2022 shows that this year, the company’s gaming revenue increased by a solid 22%.</p>
<p>Not unexpectedly, Flutter revealed that the average monthly players (AMPs) for the third quarter this year increased as well. In total, the company reported 11.1 million AMPs, a result that marks a 16% year-over-year increase when compared to the 9.6 million result reported for Q3 in 2022.</p>
