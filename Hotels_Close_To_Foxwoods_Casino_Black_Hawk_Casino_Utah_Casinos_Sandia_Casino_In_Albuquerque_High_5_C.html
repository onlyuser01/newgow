<p>The American Gaming Association (AGA) has tried to alleviate fears in light of the newly-adopted Department of Justice (DoJ) Opinion, threatening to undo much of the progress that has been achieved in the online gaming world over the last several years.</p>
<p>DoJ’s Opinion – The Story So Far</p>
<p>The turn of the year brought hopes that online gaming &amp; sports betting will be expanding across the United States at a decent clip. In New York, Senator Joe Addabbo submitted a new bill aiming to legalize online poker &amp; gaming.</p>
<p>Majority Floor Leader for Michigan Mike Kowall expressed his confidence that regardless the challenges, online gaming was coming to the state. The entire world seemed to move towards a legalized gaming industry – until disaster struck.</p>
<p>The Department of Justice (DoJ)’s Office of Legal Counsel announced that it would reverse a previous interpretation of the Wire Act of 1961 (which effectively bans sports betting) to cover other activities as well, including online gaming and poker.</p>
<p>The community was in an uproar and fear was palpable in the air until someone said – it might not be enforced.</p>
<p>It was as if U.S. Attorney General Rob Rosenstein heard, so he announced that the new interpretation would be enforced three months after signing, giving businesses 90 days to comply before a coup de grâce was struck.</p>
<p>What the American Gaming Association (AGA) Thinks</p>
<p>AGA has long been proponent of minimum involvement into the gaming &amp; betting industry. The Association has sought to explain the importance of having a regulated, but competitive market that isn’t under the thumb of the federal government. AGA’s opposition is well-documented, outlining the areas in which the government should be involved to begin with:</p>
<p>While federal regulation of sports betting will continue to be a non-starter for the gaming industry, we appreciate the sponsors’ recognition that more must be done to curb illegal sports betting operations.</p>
<p>Today’s stance on the legal course charted by DoJ reflects AGA’s firm belief that the market should remain unblemished by overreaching regulation:</p>
<p>It is unfortunate that the Department of Justice departed from well-established practice in reversing its previous opinion without a compelling reason to do so. – AGA SVP PR Sara Slane</p>
<p>Ms. Slane explained that while the Opinion was an upset in the long-term plans of the industry, it could not in any way impact the ability of states and tribes to legalize their gaming industries when it came to separate states.</p>
<p>She concluded by saying that AGA is prepared to investigate any cases of illegal gaming and work with shareholders and the DoJ to shut down such enterprises.</p>
<p>In the past, Regulus Partners, an analytics firm, has said that such overextending meddling in the gaming industry could lead to years of ill-defined legal boundaries for any operator in the sector.</p>
