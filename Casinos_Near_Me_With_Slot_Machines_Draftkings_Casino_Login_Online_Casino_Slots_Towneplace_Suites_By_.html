<p>Hacksaw Gaming will supply the Italian operator StarCasinò with games thanks to a deal that was made possible by Light and Wonder</p>
<p>Hacksaw Gaming, a provider of top-level slot games, scratchcards and gaming solutions, has unveiled an expansion into Italy. This move, the supplier noted, was made possible by an agreement with StarCasinò.</p>
<p>Hacksaw Gaming Forays into Italy</p>
<p>As agreed between StarCasinò and Hacksaw Gaming, the operator’s content offering already includes many of the supplier’s best games. This includes popular hits such as Wanted Dead or a Wild, Hand of Anubis and Stack ‘em.</p>
<p>In its announcement, Hacksaw Gaming noted that the operator will include more of the studio’s games in its portfolio in the following weeks, further deepening the ties between the two companies.</p>
<p>StarCasinò is an Italian gaming operator owned by the Betsson Group. Four months ago, the parent company also announced the launch of StarCasinò Bet, its Italian sports betting division. Back then, the operator said that its goal is to “broaden the brand’s positioning as a point of reference within the industry and to further engage with customers.”</p>
<p>The addition of new titles to StarCasinò’s offering will help to popularize the brand among Italian audiences, helping Betsson grow its local footprint.</p>
<p>StarCasinò Is Excited to Expand Its Offer</p>
<p>Hacksaw Gaming is excited about the agreement. Gabrielle Star, the company’s chief commercial officer, spoke on the matter, saying that the opportunity to launch content in Italy has been a “fantastic one.” Star said that her team is very proud to make a foray into a new market and is excited to work alongside StarCasinò.</p>
<p>This was the latest territory that we’ve begun operating in and to announce the expansion by going live with StarCasinò within one month of launching in the market is a proud moment! We are looking forward to working together in this partnership and making Italy the next big thing for Hacksaw Gaming. Gabrielle Star, CCO, Hacksaw Gaming</p>
<p>Stefano Tino, StarCasinò’s managing director, also shared his thoughts on the new agreement. He noted that the addition of Hacksaw Gaming content reaffirms the brand’s desire to become a local powerhouse. The company wants to provide its Italian fans with an increasingly innovative, wide-ranging and engaging offer, allowing them to live out premium casino experiences.</p>
<p>Tino proudly stated that in 2022, the casino operator added a whopping 1130 new games to its portfolio and inked agreements with 7 new international providers. This helped the company channel more players toward its platform, boosting customer engagement and loyalty. Tino vowed to continue enhancing StarCasinò’s offer with new games in 2023.</p>
<p>Hacksaw Gaming, meanwhile, continues to grow its global presence. In November 2022, the company secured a provisional license in West Virginia. A month later, it released Rotten, a horror-themed slot.</p>
