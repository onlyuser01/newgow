    <h1>Vernon Downs Casino Bally S Casino Las Vegas Nevada Posh Casino Login New Orleans Casino Hotel 7 Ced</h1>

<p>Dear All,</p>
<p>We understand that Mark has made a complaint regarding the decision made by the Casino to void Mark's winnings owing to irregular play.</p>
<p>Be aware that the Casino expects all players to read all the terms and conditions prior to their registration to make sure the rules fit them.</p>
<p>Before we shed light on this case, we must disagree with Mark's allegation that the casino is deleting the player's game history.</p>
<p>Be informed, that all of the gameplay is recorded and can be found on the player's account settings.</p>
<p>As for Mark's winnings, they were voided for breaking the 30% Rule.</p>
<p>In this case, the deposit in play is deposit ID 3455355 of 45 Euros. Therefore, according to the Terms and Conditions of the Casino mark is prohibited to bet more than or equal to 13.5 Euros.</p>
<p>According to Mark's game-play, he has made more than 8 over-bets between 60 Euros and 270 Euros on the games "Jack and the mighty Beanstalk" and "Thai Blossoms" - this is the reason why Mark's winnings were voided.</p>
<p>Please be advised that we view "over-betting" as a violation of the service we provide, and an attempt to deal unfairly with us. If a player attempts that, confiscation of the winnings accrued is in order.</p>
<p>The casino support staff had let know Mark about his breach multiple times and he was well informed that his withdrawal will be canceled.</p>
<p>Given that Mark had been playing with the casino since 20/03/2020, we have cause to conclude that he had ample time to become acquainted with the casino's terms and conditions.</p>
<p>We'd like to assure you that the casino is honest with its customers, as evidenced by the following:</p>
<p>Mark had been consistently winning and cashing out dollars from the casino; in fact, he had 28 successful withdrawals.</p>
<p>In view of the foregoing, the casino acted in compliance with its terms and conditions when it chose to reduce its gains due to irregular play.</p>
<p>This case is now marked as resolved.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Lord of The Spins Casino</p>
