<p>Blackhawk Network has developed a new gift card, Game On, intended at sports betting audiences who want a payment solution that allows them to fund their betting accounts safely.</p>
<p>Blackhawk Adds a Revolutionary Way of Funding Sports Betting Accounts</p>
<p>BlackHawk Network has developed and launched a smart and easy way to fund sports fans’ betting accounts through Game On, a new type of gift card geared towards the US betting audience. The solution allows consumers to top up their betting accounts conveniently and adds a layer of security on personal financial information.</p>
<p>Upon their debut, the cards will be available in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, and then expand in other sports markets. So far, there are over 20 states where sports betting is legal in the United States, giving a significant opportunity for BlackHawk Network’s Game On card in terms of adoption potential.</p>
<p>The Game On card, developed by BlackHawk Network, which is a global branded payment solutions provider, is released by Metabank, N.A., Member of the FDIC. Commenting on the launch, Brett Narlinger, head of global commerce at Blackhawk Network, had this to say: “Perfect for sports betting enthusiasts and gift card lovers alike, the Game On card pairs a fun, digital way to fund sports bets with the convenience of a gift card.”</p>
<p>Sports betting online is getting more and more popular. According to a survey completed in 2019, four in ten people bet online at least once a week. Based on another research conducted by Blackhawk and titled ‘Online Sports Gambling Survey’, sports fans have been actively turning to baseball, basketball, and football as their most favorite sports to place a wager on.</p>
<p>Game On arrives at a time when by Blackhawk’s own estimates, the global sports betting market is expected to grow by a third within the next five years. So, the game is on when it comes to this new revolutionary funding option for sports fans. It is easy to use, secure, and fun. The players will also be able to share the sports betting experience with friends and family.</p>
<p>Better Security and More Privacy</p>
<p>According to a Blackhawk Network survey, currently there are many concerns regarding privacy and how player funds are being managed. People who place sports bets are anticipating a payment option that will give them more privacy and control on spending, instead of linking their banking information to fund their sportsbook accounts.</p>
<p>The Game On card helps to address these concerns, and more. After purchasing and opening a card, players can see the card’s number, CVV, and the expiry date for online use. They can log into any of the sports betting sites that are listed on the front of the card and transfer funds to their sports betting account. Players must be physically located in the state where they have established that account in order to place their bet.</p>
<p>Players can Fund Their Accounts across Multiple Operators and Casinos</p>
<p>After the launch, players in Pennsylvania and New Jersey will be able to purchase the Game On cards online, at grocery stores, and at retailers such as Giant Eagle, ACME, The Giant Company, Stop and Shop, and many others. This revolutionary way of funding will be available in other states too, if they are subject to law and state approval.</p>
<p>With Game On, players can fund their accounts using their Game On card bankroll at other operators and casinos such as BetRivers/PlaySugarHouse Sportsbooks, DraftKings Sportsbook, FanDuel Sportsbook, BetMGM, Parx Casino, and more.</p>
