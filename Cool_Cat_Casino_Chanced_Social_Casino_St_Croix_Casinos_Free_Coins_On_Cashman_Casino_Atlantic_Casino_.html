<p>The Tulalip Tribes of Washington have reached an agreement with the Washington State Gambling Commission, bringing to the state in-person sports wagering at the tribe’s casinos or online bets if players are physically present in the casinos.</p>
<p>Washington and Tulalip Tribes Reach an Agreement</p>
<p>The Washington State Gambling Commission has reached an agreement with the Tulalip Tribes of Washington, which would bring in-person sports betting at the tribe’s casinos or online betting, allowed if players are in the casinos physically. Upon the agreement, the Tulalip Tribe, which owns 2 Class III gaming venues on its reservation in Marysville, may use its gaming compact to provide sports wagering.</p>
<p>The agreement comes a year after Governor Jay Inslee signed HB 2638, allowing sports betting at the tribal casinos and many negotiations with the Tulalip Tribes and is the first sports betting compact agreement in Washington. Initially, it allowed betting only at the tribe’s Class III betting venues.</p>
<p>Sports Wagering Revenue to Create More Jobs in Washington</p>
<p>The Washington State Gambling Commission Chair Bud Sizemore said that the commission believes in a careful approach towards this amendment could ensure spots wagering with the highest integrity possible, meaning conducting legal gambling with honesty.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the new compact will help resolve future sports betting regulation issues regarding licensing, sports integrity, and law enforcement.</p>
<p>Tulalip charwoman Teri Gobin said that sports betting is an exciting new activity for Washington residents. Like tribal gaming profit, sports wagering revenue would also stay in Washington, making more charitable contributions, benefiting communities, and creating more jobs in the state. If approved, the bill would take effect before 2021 NFL season</p>
<p>The Gambling Commission will vote on the bill on June 10, and if the commissioners approve it, it will pass to the Tribal Chair and Governor for signing. After that, it would go for review and publication in the Federal Register by the Secretary of the United States Department of Interior.</p>
<p>If everything goes to plan and the bill passes, it would take effect before the 2021 NFL season, which begins this September, would benefit the tribe’s launch of its in-person and online sports wagering.</p>
<p>In February, leaders from Washington asked lawmakers in Olympia to pass a bill for expanding sports wagering, claiming it would boost the state’s economic recovery and bring $100 million of tax revenue annually. SB 5212 was discussed during a public hearing of the Senate Committee on Labor, Commerce &amp; Tribal Affairs on February 4, 2021. The legislation is a part of a bigger plan for the post-pandemic recovery of the state.</p>
