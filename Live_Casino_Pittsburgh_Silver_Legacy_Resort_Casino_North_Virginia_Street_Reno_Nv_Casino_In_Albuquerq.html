<p>Smarkets, a dedicated sports betting exchange, had made the next step towards excellence, by reaching out to PandaScore to elevate its own esports betting product. As a result, the two companies will collaborate on providing bettors with the best esports betting feds, courtesy of PandaScore’s dedicated products for the vertical.</p>
<p>Smarkets will proceed by integrating PandaScore’s feeds that feature hundreds of esports betting markets, and relevant competitive titles such as Dota 2, Counter-Strike, and League of Legends. To make sure that punters are having the best possible experience, PandaScore will deliver its dedicated BetBuilder tool, empowering the esports wagering experience for Smarkets customers.</p>
<p>PandaScore Senior Sales Manager Dasha Kirilishina has welcomed this opportunity and said that it was good to see Smarkets actually choose to onboard the company’s betting feeds and products, all of which are designed to provide a superior experience to relevant audiences.</p>
<p>"The esports betting market is big and it’s only getting bigger. Forward-thinking operators such as Smarkets can use our solutions and products to engage players now and to form a deep, genuine connection that leads to long-term loyalty before their rivals get in on the action," Kirilishina added.</p>
<p>The news was naturally welcomed by Smarkets Head of Technical Ryan Caruana who was similarly excited about the chance to expand into the esports vertical, cautioning that the market itself was vastly different from what Smarkets usually did, and therefore requiring the special treatment that PandaScore was able to provide.</p>
<p>"This partnership allows us to offer esports in an authentic, meaningful way, and we look forward to engaging new bettors while also providing significant added value to those that are already wagering with Smarkets," Caruana added on a high note.</p>
<p>PandaScore has been actively building up its proposition in esports betting, and the company has had several successful tie-ups with important and prominent companies from the gambling industry. In July, PandaScore announced a partnership with Dabble, and before that, PandaScore’s feeds were integrated into Betfred, an established British bookmaker covering regular sports.</p>
