    <h1>Casinos Southern California Oyo Hotel And Casino Casino Hotel St Louis Mo Winstar Casino In Thackerv</h1>

<p>Malta-regulated online sports betting and gaming operator Betcris continues to be hyperactive in Latin American markets. Having recently launched a dedicated website localized for Brazil, the operator now entered into a first-of-its-kind agreement with a restaurant chain in Mexico.</p>
<p>Sports Bars as Alternative Sportsbooks</p>
<p>Betcris and Buffalo Wild Wings (BWW) sports bar brand announced a new partnership in Mexico, in which both parties would join forces to bring sports betting to the restaurant chain. So far, the agreement allows Betcris to enter in 10 restaurants under the BWW brand, but there are provisions for more locations to be added in the future.</p>
<p>Betcris will launch the new offering with modules located at Mundo E and Paseo Interlomas in Mexico State, Acora Delta in Mexico City, Plaza Paseo Quintana and Juriquilla in Santiago De Querétaro, Midtown Jalisco in Guadalajara, Distrito 1 in Chihuahua, Centro Comercial Las Misiones in Ciudad Juárez, Plaza Gran Vía in Mexicali, and Baja California Norte and Plaza Colosio in Aguascalientes.</p>
<p>Under the term of the partnership deal, Betcris will place modules at strategic locations inside the properties and will allow customers to experience firsthand everything the gaming operator offers on its app and website, including sports betting, casino, eSports, and sports simulations.</p>
<p>Restaurant guests will also have the opportunity to take advantage of the Betcris Arena loyalty program, the operator’s Affiliate Program, instant payment options and others. Besides the deposit and withdrawal options at customers’ disposal at all times, Betcris modules will allow bettors to collect immediately their winnings.</p>
<p>New Experience for Fans</p>
<p>The agreement between Betcris and BWW represents a type of partnership never seen before in the gambling industry and a brand new experience for sports fans. It allows the online gaming operator to gain exposure to customers of the sports bar chain and tap into the potential the numerous fans of BWW present in terms of betting and gambling opportunities.</p>
<p>Betcris is expecting the latest endeavor to prove lucrative and supportive of its expansion in Latin America. Starting initially with sports betting, the operator later added online casino gambling to create an alternative for gamblers and diversify its business exposure.</p>
<p>At the same time, Betcris continues to use its popularity and leading market position to paint an image of the gaming industry as a successful commercial activity operating within legally established regulatory frameworks across South America.</p>
<p>In July, Betcris entered into a partnership deal with Major League Baseball (MLB) to become the official sportsbook of the league for Latin America, and in September, a similar deal was struck with another of the major professional sports leagues in the US, the National Football League (NFL), to make Betcris the official betting partner for the league.</p>
