    <h1>Aztec Casino Las Vegas Cliff Castle Casino Niagara Falls Canada Casino Soaring Eagle Casino Resort B</h1>

<p>Kambi Group plc has entered into a strategic partnership to provide its retail and online sportsbook solutions to Affinity Interactive, an omni-channel gaming and betting industry leader. As a result, AI will now benefit from Kambi’s products and power its own retail, digital, online sports betting and DFS initiatives, all of which are in the pipeline, an official press release stated.</p>
<p>AI stands to benefit from an array of Kambi’s proven software and tools, including but not limited to best-in-class betting solutions, compliance, and odds tools, as well as customer intelligence and risk management, which are increasingly important aspects of the sports betting experience in highly regulated markets such as the United States.</p>
<p>Breaking Ground in Regulated US Markets Together</p>
<p>The partnership between the company specifically focuses on regulated states, making it a multi-pronged approach to the evolving US betting market. Kambi CEO Kristian Nylén said that he was thrilled to be able to provide Kambi’s software to the talented team at Affinity Interactive:</p>
<p>“This agreement is an exciting opportunity to showcase the strength of our product and leverage our experience to succeed in the competitive sports betting market. The combination of Kambi’s advanced technology, DRF Sports’ multimedia information capabilities and Affinity Interactive’s regional casino assets makes for an enticing sports betting proposition.” Kambi CEO Kristian Nylén</p>
<p>All of these tools and solutions are created based on the Kambi dedicated software platform. Kambi also stands to benefit as AI’s footprint in the United States is already beginning to grow. In fact, AI owns the Daily Racing Form, a 127-year-old provider of premium data and editorial coverage about horse racing and sports enthusiasts across North America.</p>
<p>AI Fully Prepared for the Digital Age</p>
<p>This is just one of the assets the company is proud of. Then, you have DRF Bets, which is a quickly expanding online and mobile wagering platform. Both of these assets will allow Kambi to leverage its data, technology and services and deliver it to customers. For an entry point, Kambi and AI have picked Iowa, but the state is one of many to come in 2022 and beyond, the press release explained.</p>
<p>The news was equally welcomed by Affinity Interactive chairman James Zenni who said that the partnership marked an exciting time for the sports betting industry and the company. “This is the first step in our strategy of rolling out the DRF Sports brand to online customers for sports betting and iGaming,” Zenni explained.</p>
