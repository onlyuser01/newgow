    <h1>Charlestown Casino Cape Girardeau Casino Casinos In Michigan Map Casino The Movie Cast Crocs Casino</h1>

<p>Lars Kollind, an experienced iGaming specialist, has joined Swintt’s team and will serve the company as its new head of business development. He will be responsible for furthering the provider’s momentum.</p>
<p>Swintt, an established provider of casino content, has reinforced its team with the addition of Lars Kollind. As announced by the company, Kollind, a seasoned industry veteran, will join as its new head of business development.</p>
<p>Kollind Joins the Provider</p>
<p>The addition of Kollind to the provider’s team demonstrates Swintt’s ambition to continue growing its business. In his position, the new hire will oversee the company’s long-term business strategy and will be responsible for implementing its growth plans. In addition, the new appointee will be responsible for securing sales opportunities across the multiple jurisdictions where Swintt operates.</p>
<p>A main focus for the provider would be planned forays into Romania, Greece and Ontario and additional partnerships with various Tier 1 operators all over the world.</p>
<p>As mentioned, Kollind boasts years of experience in the iGaming sector, having previously worked for many notable casino brands. Swintt highlighted some of the hire’s previously held roles, including his tenures as iSoftBet’s head of business development, Playson’s senior business development manager, and Aspire Global’s global gaming and global sales director.</p>
<p>Swintt recently entered the key UK market, allowing it to provide its content to operators in one of the biggest gambling markets in the world. It also struck notable agreements with companies across the Baltics and is now seeking to maintain this momentum throughout 2023. To that end, Kollind will help the provider further expand its business by building on the existing foundations.</p>
<p>The Hire Is Happy to Join Swintt</p>
<p>The new appointee spoke about his new position, saying that he is happy to join such an established and innovative brand. Kollind praised Swintt for becoming a casino content powerhouse in a relatively short time and said that he believes the provider is ready to take on some of the industry’s most influential companies.</p>
<p>Kollind said that he is looking forward to working with Swintt’s “fantastic team” and that this new job is a “dream come true.”</p>
<p>Hopefully my experience can help secure new commercial opportunities as we look to establish the brand as a household name in regulated markets worldwide. Lars Kollind, head of business development, Swintt</p>
<p>Meanwhile, David Mann, Swintt’s chief executive officer, welcomed Kollind to the company. He lauded the new hire as someone who would bring crucial experience to the company’s team.</p>
<p>As a software provider that has already enjoyed phenomenal growth over the past few years, we’re confident Lars can help take our brand to the next level as we look to form new global partnerships and implement a successful and sustainable long-term business plan going into 2023 and beyond. David Mann, CEO, Swintt</p>
<p>Swintt is a reputable supplier known for its impressive portfolio of online slot games. In November 2022, the company further expanded the reach of its content by penning an agreement with the leading gaming aggregator Pariplay.</p>
