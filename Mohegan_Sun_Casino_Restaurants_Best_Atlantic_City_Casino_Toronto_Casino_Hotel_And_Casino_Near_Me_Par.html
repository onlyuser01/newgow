<p>Richard Schwartz, president of RSI which operates the SugarHouse Online Casino brand, congratulated the woman on her huge win. He said that the fact the lucky player hit the record-breaking jackpot “is not just a triumph for RSI but a monumental moment for the entire online gaming industry.”</p>
