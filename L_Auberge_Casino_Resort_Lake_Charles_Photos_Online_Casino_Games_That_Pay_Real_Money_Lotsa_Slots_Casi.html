    <h1>L Auberge Casino Resort Lake Charles Photos Online Casino Games That Pay Real Money Lotsa Slots Casi</h1>

<p>I am afraid that you are the one who does not understand me. We always try to stand on the player's side, but it is not always possible and we cannot blindly advocate for everything. As I already mentioned, we do not solve complaints about self-exclusion from the whole group of casinos. Unless the casino has the MGA or UK license, there is nothing we can do, because the Curacao authority does not legally bind sister casinos to enforce self-exclusion in all of them.</p>
<p>Since this casino is licensed by Curacao and Dux Casino by MGA, they most likely are prohibited from sharing personal information about their players (GDPR regulations). They are different establishments, operated by two different managements, therefore Winz.io Casino probably didn't know about your self-exclusion from a completely different casino.</p>
<p>Even if these two belonged to the same group in the past, they do not now and they would share the Curacao license like all Dama casinos do, which as I already explained does not enforce self-exclusion for all associated casinos. And even if they both had MGA licenses (which again - they do not) they would have to share the same license seal in order for us to proceed with your case as failed self-exclusion. If Curacao casinos decide to do it voluntarily, that is great, but we do not insist on it.</p>
<p>We believe that the casino must block you only after you request self-exclusion due to gambling addiction, otherwise, you asked for a simple account closure and the casino can reopen your account anytime. This means that if you didn't mention it the first three times, the casino could reopen your account. However, your account was blocked after you mentioned your gambling problem, so, unfortunately, I don't see anything that can be done here and I don't see any valid reason to request a deposit refund or other compensation. We would really like to help, but it is impossible for us this time because the casino did nothing wrong.</p>
<p>If you do not agree with our decision, you can always contact the licensing authority. They have more options and tools to help players.</p>
<p>Due to the aforementioned reasons, this complaint will now be rejected. Thank you for your understanding, I am sorry we could not be of more help on this occasion. Please do not hesitate to contact us if you run into any issues with this or any other casino in the future.</p>
