<p>Clarion Gaming has made a huge announcement today confirming that its iconic ICE London and iGB Affiliate events will be finally relocating to a new home and away from the ExCel London to the Fira de Barcelona starting from January 2025.</p>
<p>Fira de Barcelona has shaped itself as an iconic venue for industry meet-ups, with SBC Summit Barcelona, proving one of the most successful and populous formats and events to be held on-site. Clarion Gaming will host ICE Barcelona and iGB Affiliate Barcelona at the 240,000 sq mt venue which will accommodate delegates on January 20 and January 22, 2025.</p>
<p>The decision to pack up and leave was not made lightly either, with the entire process costing the organization significant effort. There were more than 30 factors to consider when choosing the new venue, including the future of the events, their format, and how they can be developed to better accommodate the needs of the industry and the show itself.</p>
<p>This relocation is endorsed by the ICE Advisory Board which voted mostly in favor, with five out of the 23 member organizations preferring to remain in London, the United Kingdom instead. One party did not vote.</p>
<p>Alex Pratt, Managing Director at Clarion Gaming, has hailed the effort that has gone into researching the potential new venues, with four shortlisted cities, and the impressive bids placed by interested parties. He also hailed Clarion Gamingâ€™s efforts in overseeing the entire process and ensuring its smooth running. Pratt said:</p>
<p>"This was a complex, customer-led undertaking. The process enabled us to identify the city that our customers believe is best equipped to be our strategic partner for the future and is able to host two world-class events which meet the needs of businesses of all sizes and locations across every part of the gaming and ICE Community."</p>
<p>Pratt said that Barcelona was a successful bid for at least several important reasons, including its world-class facilities, hospitality infrastructure, logistics, and so much more. He said that this collaboration with Fira de Barcelona would allow the company to create an "important legacy for the future" which will define ICE London and iGB Affiliates for years to come. In the meantime, the 2024 editions of the shows will still be held in London.</p>
<p>The contract signed with Fira de Barcelona covers an initial period of five years, including 2025 and 2029. This news comes after 12 years of successful collaboration with ExCel London.</p>
