    <h1>Pacific Spins Casino Login Aztec Inn Casino Sunset Station Casino Henderson Nevada Escanaba Casino C</h1>

<p>Dear Peter,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. Let me explain to you what the difference is between closing the account and self-exclusion:</p>
<p>Some casinos use lots of tools for responsible gambling and I would not mention them here. What players can do if they’re unhappy in the casino: Close the account or self-exclude themselves, that's the two basic choices.</p>
<p>Closing an account is simple and has almost no impact - the player can reopen the account anytime, the casino has no obligation to the player, and they can still try to persuade players to stay and continue playing.</p>
<p>On the other hand, self-exclusion (an option for players experiencing gambling problems) does. If a player successfully makes a self-exclusion the casino agrees not to open this account or if yes only under particular circumstances (after cooling off period and this cannot be done for players who’s are addicted/with gambling problem).</p>
<p>In this case, you’ve requested a simple account closure due to being dissatisfied with the services, therefore we see nothing wrong with the casino sending you promotional material, not to mention you can always block the email address.</p>
<p>I am afraid, that we aren’t able to help here. If there is anything else we could do for you regarding this case, do not hesitate to let us know.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Kristina</p>
