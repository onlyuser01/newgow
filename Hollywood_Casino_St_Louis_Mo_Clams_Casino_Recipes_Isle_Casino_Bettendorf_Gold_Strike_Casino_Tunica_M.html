<p>Poker fans are in for a treat after earlier this week, the dates for the most popular tournament in the poker industry, the World Series of Poker (WSOP), were announced. The 54th annual WSOP edition of the tournament returns to the gambling capital of the world, the Las Vegas Strip, starting on May 30, 2023.</p>
<p>The prestigious tournament will take place at Paris Las Vegas, as well as Bally's Las Vegas, which is expected to become Horseshoe Las Vegas soon, a statement released by Caesars Entertainment reveals. Rolling out at the end of May 2023, the tournament will go through July 18, 2023.</p>
<p>The upcoming edition of the WSOP will mark the second time the prestigious poker tournament is taking place at Paris Las Vegas and the future Horseshoe Las Vegas. The event also builds upon a legacy between the WSOP and Caesars Entertainment, as the first such event was played back in 1970 at the Original Horseshoe casino in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>The most anticipated event as a part of the tournament, the Main Event, returns next year starting on July 3 and will run through July 17. In addition to the Main Event, Caesars revealed that the 2023 WSOP tournament will include other flagship events such as "Mystery Millions" and more events that grant entrants a chance for big prizes.</p>
<p>Additional details and the full schedule of the 2023 WSOP, according to Caesars, will be released next year. With that in mind, the upcoming 54th edition of the tournament is expected to attract, as usual, some of the best poker players in the world.</p>
<p>In fact, this year, the 2022 Main Event, hit the second-highest field of entries by attracting 8,663 entrants who helped generate a staggering $80,782,475 prize pool. Keeping in mind the high interest in the event, next year, there will be four starting days for the players between July 3 and July 6. Caesars explained that due to the "deep stack nature of the event, players can also choose to buy in during either of the Day 2's on July 7 or 8."</p>
<p>Celebrating the announcement of the 2023 WSOP tournament dates, Caesars announced reduced rates for its Las Vegas resorts during the dates of the tournament. The company explained that visitors that want to take advantage of the special rates can book a room and apply a code "WSOP23."</p>
<p>Ty Stewart WSOP's Senior Vice President and Executive Director, said about the recent announcement: "The historic debut of the WSOP on the Las Vegas Strip delivered in a big way, and we're excited to announce our Summer 2023 dates in time for the holidays."</p>
<p>He added: "Poker players and fans can now officially mark their calendars and maybe even book their loved ones or themselves a trip to the WSOP as a holiday gift." Stewart said that the WSOP is excited to come back to Paris Las Vegas and the Horseshoe Las Vegas for the new edition of the tournament.</p>
<p>Jason Gregorec, the SVP and General Manager of Paris and Horseshoe Las Vegas, added that the WSOP is undoubtedly one of the most-anticipated events and acknowledged that there are just six months until the start of the tournament. Finally, Gregorec said: "We can't wait to see the first WSOP Main Event champion crowned at the new Horseshoe Las Vegas."</p>
