<p>Igaming and sportsbook software supplier Altenar has revealed in a press release shared via email that it has finally been granted a Gaming Related Supplier license by the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario (AGCO). The new development comes three months after the company confirmed that it had arrived on the Canadian market.</p>
<p>The Gaming Related Supplier license applies to Altenar’s sportsbook which marks the company's sportsbook debut in the regulated market. This sportsbook comes with 0% margins on specific big events, the company said. Altenar offers a variety of competitive markets to pick from.</p>
<p>Players will be able to wager on baseball, basketball, American football, college football, hockey, and electronic sports. Plus, the Altenar sportsbook is available on both desktop and mobile devices. According to Altenar, the company has been enjoying steady growth in traffic and results.</p>
<p>Altenar places strong emphasis on virtual sports, sports data, and electronic sports. Meanwhile, Altenar Director of Operations Antonis Karakousis welcomed the opportunity. The executive said that he was thrilled to be bringing the company’s "best-in-class services" to the regulated market in Ontario.</p>
<p>"We look forward to bringing a bespoke, rewarding betting experience to the customer base in this exciting new market, specifically tailored to cater to their needs – and the result of extensive research and development.," Karakousis assured, adding that it had taken the company long preparations to make sure that it can obtain the AGCO license.</p>
<p>Specifically, Altenar needed to obtain a permit and be audited by an independent test lab. Now, the company is finally able to provide local fans with a strong sports betting product. This comes at a particularly interesting time for the provincial iGaming and sports betting market in Ontario.</p>
<p>There has been a string of companies entering, with Playson revealing its entry this week as well. The province has also posted its first quarterly results, indicating a strong interest in interactive gambling, although further improvements could be made.</p>
<p>At the same time, Ontario has remained vigilant in terms of what operators should and should not do. Several companies have already been fined since the market launched in April. Unibet was among the companies to receive a penalty over promotional inducements most recently.</p>
<p>Regardless, Altenar feels confident about its own place in the regulated market and cannot wait to bring its sportsbook offer to fans to experience.</p>
