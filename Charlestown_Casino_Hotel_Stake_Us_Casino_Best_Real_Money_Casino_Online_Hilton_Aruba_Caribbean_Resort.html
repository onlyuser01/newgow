    <h1>Charlestown Casino Hotel Stake Us Casino Best Real Money Casino Online Hilton Aruba Caribbean Resort</h1>

<p>Hello I joined silveredge casino back in late November and got their free300 chip and an extra 25$ for being new or something.. the total no deposit bonus was 325$. I started winning and kept winning. I would ask how much playthrough I had left and noticed they were not telling me the truth about how much I was going through each time I asked so I kept track once and realized it was pretty much 50%. So I actually did the playthrough twice or actually probably more.. I login in today and was told I still had 1000 to playthrough. I knew it was bs but set my bet to 10$ which I'm pretty sure is the max bet while using a bonus. ( I have followed ALL rules perfect and only played slots with the money) I read through their terms and states max cash out is 2x the total no-deposit bonus. Ok. So 650$ pretty nice!! I still have almost 1300$ in my account. More than enough to cover the cost of the bonus and then the bonus x2. I go to live support and let them know I'm ready to verify myself and I send all needed pictures and info (no banking ,card info yet and still haven't entered it) the support agent tells me I can put in a query to cash out for 100$. They refuse to pay me anymore than than that and I red everywhere.. even if words are twisted up there is a place in the terms that says all no deposit bonus withdraw are caped at a maximum of 1x the total of the bonus unless otherwise stated. ( which it was for the 300$ one I received) I am told the casino has the right to change the rules whenever they decide to.. I ask if he could show me where those rules changed and that question is ignored.</p>
<p>I don't know what to do.. I'm scared if I don't take the 100$ I'm never going t ok get a dime but if I take the money does it deny me from being able to legally win it somehow. I KNOW FOR FACT IM100% IN THE RIGHT AND DID NOT VIOLATE ANY TERMS THEY HAVE.</p>
<p>Please help!! I have photos of my last 2 conversations with tech support, my account information. Date created. What bonuses I've got ( only the one 325$) and the guy said he cleared my verification pictures. I sent my license front and back me holding the license front and back and a picture of a shut off notice from rge my gas company.</p>
<p>My family has been affected by covid 19 greatly and I am still unable to work. That 100$ could REALLY help but I know I deserve much more and feel as if the 100 is a bribe or something. They could just oops close and loose my account. Seeing as I doubt many people turn their 300$ into over 2500 which was the most I had during my neverending playthrough..</p>
