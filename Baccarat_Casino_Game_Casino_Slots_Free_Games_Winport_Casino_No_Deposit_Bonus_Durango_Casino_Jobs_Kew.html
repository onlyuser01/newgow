<p>Regardless of what the intent is, the rules are clear, and there have not been any exceptions in this regard. The NFL’s strict restrictions imply that this is part of the league’s integrity, and Kosar’s situation shows that integrity comes above all else.</p>
<p>Cleveland Browns Fired Bernie Kosar</p>
<p>His bet was for $19,000, and he placed it on the Cleveland Browns for their match against the Pittsburg Steelers. He announced his bet publicly but by being – contractually – part of an NFL team, the bet was against the rules, which state that NFL participants are strictly prohibited from placing bets on NFL matches.</p>
<p>The reason he had announced his bet, presumably, was not to boast, but rather to inform the people that all his potential winnings would go to charity. No matter the intent, though, he was fired, and this is going down as the story of the first legal bet in Ohio made through the Tipico Sportsbook, as Kosar’s own tweet named it.</p>
<p>Kosar was previously a quarterback for the Browns from 1985 to 1993 and has become a part of the team’s history with 21,904 passing yards. After that he became part of the larger fan community However, as he was hired as a radio voice for the team, he – at least in some capacity – continued to be part of the team as well.</p>
<p>NFL Rules Clear on Betting Restriction</p>
<p>The official statement regarding Kosar’s firing was – understandably – rather dry, as Kosar was a beloved voice and part of the community. It made clear that the move was not against Kosar personally but was made as NFL policy requires it, and the team must adhere to all regulations, with rules about betting by NFL members being very strict.</p>
<p>“Earlier this week we notified Bernie, that per league policy, we were required to remove him from our pregame radio coverage for the season finale after he violated the NFL gambling policy by placing a bet on an NFL game,” the statement read on Mary Kay Cabot’s Twitter account. She continued by acknowledging Kosar’s community legacy.</p>
<p>Regardless of all of this, however, the NFL has historically been very serious about its personnel’s betting restriction, and Kosar’s case adds to the list of people excluded from the league for breaking these rules. Multiple players have been suspended from the NFL over placing bets while actively taking part in the league.</p>
<p>At the beginning of March 2022, Atlanta Falcons wide receiver Calvin Ridley was suspended “indefinitely” over placing bets on NFL games. His earliest reinstatement date was scheduled for next month, on February 15, so his name might yet be part of the news cycle again very soon if it’s deemed appropriate for him to participate in the league.</p>
