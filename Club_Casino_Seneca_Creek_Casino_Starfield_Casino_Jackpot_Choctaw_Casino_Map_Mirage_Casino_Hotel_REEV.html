<p>REEVO, a company that develops in-house content and aggregates games for third parties, has signed a new partnership with a prominent industry supplier</p>
<p>The alliance has to do with Endorphina, a fellow developer and studio of excellent iGaming titles among which are slots such as Little Panda Dice, Diamond Chance, Retromania, and many others.</p>
<p>REEVO Strengthens Library of Games with Endorphina</p>
<p>Reevo has a long and established tradition of providing players with some of the best products possible, as its portfolio of proprietary and third-party content products has been scaling rapidly, courtesy of the dedicated aggregation platform run by the company.</p>
<p>Endorphina will be bringing more than 100 of its own games to the aggregator and use it to grow its offer significantly. REEVO on the other hand will benefit from diverse and real-money content that will be an outstanding opportunity for the platform as well as its network of operators and partners to elicit stronger engagement with their own player bases.</p>
<p>Endorphina is also a well-known name in the industry which means that it will automatically be driving a lot of attention to its products. REEVO is happy to have secured this partnership, too, says Petra Maria Poola, the company’s head of sales.</p>
<p>“We’re thrilled to have Endorphina on board, a studio we really admire for their professionalism, expertise and creativity,” Poola said. She hailed Endorphina’s games as noteworthy additions that will truly consolidate the company’s reach and presence in global territories and markets.</p>
<p>REEVO has been growing its offer at a rapid pace with the company adding a string of prominent suppliers to its aggregation solution. 3 Oaks Gaming joined the platform earlier in June and REEVO further expanded its library with Turbo Games. Other recent partnerships include ELA Games and Red Tiger, both of which became suppliers and part of REEVO’s library of games.</p>
