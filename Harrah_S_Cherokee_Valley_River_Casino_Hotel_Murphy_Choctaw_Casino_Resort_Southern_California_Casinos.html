    <h1>Harrah S Cherokee Valley River Casino Hotel Murphy Choctaw Casino Resort Southern California Casinos</h1>

<p>Lewis Hamilton and Max Verstappen are returning in the highly-contested F1 season that has both drivers gunning hard for a career title. While Verstappen had the upper hand in the first half of the season, Hamilton has been posting the more consistent performance of late and has been able to top the overall standings.</p>
<p>Even though Hamilton finished fifth in the Turkey GP, he will be looking to win the US Grand Prix on Sunday, October 24, a feat he has not accomplished since 2017. Verstappen in the meantime is listed at (+135) making him the runner-up to secure the checkered flag once again.</p>
<p>The race will be taking place at the Circuit of the Americas in Austin, Texas on Sunday. You can tune in and watch Verstappen and Hamilton vie for yet another race with Valterri Bottas in the midst of another title push.</p>

<p>Hamilton vs Verstappen: Another Betting Opportunity</p>
<p>Verstappen and Hamilton have been where most of the betting action has gone to, and Hamilton is now listed as (-135) favorite in the latest DraftKings odds. While the Englishman hasn’t secured as many first-place finishes in the season, his great performance has allowed the Mercedes team to continue dominating in the F1.</p>
<p>He recently slowed down during the Turkey GP after he had to sit out a penalty because of a quick engine upgrade. Regardless, he managed to pull in fifth in the overall standings at the race. Never mind the more challenging competitive circuit this season, Hamilton has the markings of a true F1 champion. He will not be settling for anything but a win at the US Grand Prix, but the fact he hasn’t won in the circuit in four years is also significant.</p>
<p>Verstappen on the other hand seems to be far more confident in his ability to perform in Texas this weekend. He is still on the top of the overall rankings, not least because of a highly controversial win during the Belgium GP a few months back.</p>
<p>Regardless, his performance this season has been quite impressive. However, Verstappen will have to acclimatize himself to the sultry weather in Texas and that is a thing. He has not been able to win in the United States yet and particularly in Austin. He still remains a worthwhile contender in the race.</p>
<p>We have every reason to believe that he will be able to give Hamilton a good run for his money. Meanwhile, Hamilton managed to clock victories in the 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017 races. However, he couldn’t repeat this feat in 2018 when he ceded to Kimi Räikkönen and in 2019 when Valtteri Bottas won. The event was canceled in 2020 due to the pandemic.</p>
<p>This one is a bit of a toss-up. We feel Hamilton has what it takes to win first and secure the US Grand Prix, topping the F1 charts as well and that is precisely what we will be betting on.</p>
