<p>FSB, a global B2B supplier and provider of iGaming and sports betting solutions, has teamed up with leading European betting and gaming operator Olympic Entertainment Group, and its brand “OlyBet”. The partnership will see FSB provide the latter with a range of casino gaming solutions.</p>
<p>Covering Both Land-Based and Online Gaming</p>
<p>The partnership will focus on FSB’s iGaming platform and assist OlyBet to expand its reach across several European markets. FSB will deploy its proprietary player account management services and a selection of more than 10,000 games to ensure that OlyBet players have access to some of the best titles out there.</p>
<p>FSB will launch omnichannel solutions that will make it possible for consumers to enjoy in-person and online casino experiences without any issues. The company will integrate its over-the-counter solutions at various Olympic Entertainment Group land-based venues and ensure that players can use their online credits at those facilities.</p>
<p>FSB CRO Ian Freeman welcomed this opportunity and said that it marked the efforts the company put in to make sure that it comes across as a trusted and safe partner to Olympic Entertainment Group. He added:</p>
<p>OEG has a great heritage as well as being a highly skilled operator, our selection is further testament to the strength of our Tier 1 omnichannel tech stack and the fantastic team we are building at FSB. FSB CRO Ian Freeman</p>
<p>Olympic Entertainment Group CEO and chairman Corey Plummer added that the company was excited to be working with FSB and the tie-up was an important step forward toward expanding in CEE markets. Through this collaboration, OEG will have the opportunity to roll out products and solutions that it knows its customers and players truly enjoy.</p>
<p>FSB has been able to expand its reach globally, striking important partnerships in North and South America. The company was unanimously recommended for a supplier license by the Nevada Gaming Control Board last week.</p>
<p>Prior to this, FSB launched a new headquarters office in Colombia as the company seeks to establish a regional presence that will allow it to expand its technological solutions to both emerging markets in Latin America and the already developed ones in North America.</p>
