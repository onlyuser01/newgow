<p>AffPapa has continued to build momentum by securing new partnerships and ensuring that it remains the one-stop-shop for all things affiliate in the iGaming industry. Now, the company has added JustAffiliates, an established program and company, to its list of trusted partners. The tie-up will help JustAffiliates to explore new business opportunities and help grow its own offer as well that of AffPapa’s.</p>
<p>Presently, JustAffiliates promotes established brand names such as betspino.com and justbit.io. Both brands operate under a license issued by Curacao. JustAffiliates prides itself on its loyalty program, but also timely withdrawals, and what the company describes as a "positive crypto gaming experience." As to affiliate partners, they can choose from either pre-existing plans or collaborate with the program’s account managers and embark on their own plans that they can design and tailor to their business needs.</p>
<p>Commenting on this new opportunity, JustAffiliates Affiliate Manager Artem Mnishchenko welcomed the chance to be a part of AffPapa’s extensive network, which bestows its own brand of advantages. Mnishchenko had this to say in the official press release shared by AffPapa:</p>
<p>"Excited to establish a long-term cooperation with AffPapa! We must admit that we love the friendly and professional attitude. The team responds promptly and is always eager to assist. Also, I cannot ignore the amount of information I was able to learn about the world of affiliate marketing through AffPapa."</p>
<p>The news was similarly welcomed by AffPapa Head of Commercial Yeva Avagyan who was similarly pleased with the development and said that having JustAffiliates join the directory was a success for her company as well. Avagyan confirmed that AffPapa was fully committed to helping affiliate marketing efforts for its partners and clients.</p>
<p>AffPapa has been a passionate advocate of affiliate marketing and has built the entire business model around this concept. In a recent interview, Avagyan spoke at length about AffPapa’s mission, the success of one of its freshest concepts, the iGaming Club, and the mission that affiliate companies have in informing customers and aiding business to better the industry.</p>
<p>AffPapa has been teaming up with a number of operators and affiliates, helping connect those parties and guide them on the core principles of good marketing. Before JustAffiliates, the company teamed up with Velobet.</p>
