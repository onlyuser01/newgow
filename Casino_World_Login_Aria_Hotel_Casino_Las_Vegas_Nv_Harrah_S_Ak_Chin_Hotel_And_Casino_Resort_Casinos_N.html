<p>BetMGM continues on its mission to add more quality iGaming and sports betting experiences to its platform with the latest move focusing firmly on the online casino vertical. The company has teamed up with Atlantic Digital, a developer of casino content that is making its first foray into the United States through BetMGM, and which develops proprietary games and draws inspiration from film and TV titles to bring a unique experience to its players.</p>
<p>Moving forward, these games will be available to BetMGM which will benefit from the likes of The Godfather slot game along with others. The Godfatherslot game is a considerable focus of this collaboration, the official press release reveals, as BetMGM Director of Gaming Oliver Bartlett spoke highly of both Atlantic Digital and their prominent game.</p>
<p>He hailed The Godfather as one of the most prominent movies in cinema first and said that he was proud to see BetMGM introduce the slot to the United States as an exclusive game. "We are always looking to partner with brands our customers love and game studios that are creating new and engaging content," Bartlett added.</p>
<p>Atlantic Digital is similarly happy to be part of this journey into the jurisdiction, backed by BetMGM, and bring its iconic The Godfather slot to the market. Atlantic Digital has always been focused on the land-based sector and bringing players unique experiences, said company CEO Sam Hobcraft, adding that through this collaboration with BetMGM, the company will also be able to deploy its distinguished IP to the online gaming sector in the United States.</p>
<p>Atlantic Digitalâ€™s games are joining a bulky portfolio of online titles featuring over 1,500 games. This comes at an important time for BetMGM in general as the operator is looking to expand in new jurisdictions and maintain a robust standard for responsible gambling. BetMGM in fact rolled out in the United Kingdom in August, and the company is leveraging its portfolio locally with both its sports betting and casino offer.</p>
