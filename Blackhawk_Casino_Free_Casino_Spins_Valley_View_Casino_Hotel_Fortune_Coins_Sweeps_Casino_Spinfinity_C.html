<p>The Casino Guru Awards is the latest project by Casino Guru inspired by guiding the dialogue on consumer safety, and it reflects on the company’s ambition to acknowledge and reward achievement in the gambling industry, specifically in the sectors Casino Guru has contributed to – responsible gambling and consumer education. Casino Guru Awards is the result of this long-term commitment to making gambling safer, fairer, and more accountable for all participants.</p>
<p>Drawing on years of experience as the defining affiliate service in the industry, Casino Guru has transcended its core model to make global changes to the industry, including through its Global Self-Exclusion Initiative, Casino Guru Academy, Fair Gambling Codex, and other initiatives.</p>
<p>Now, the company is stepping up its responsibilities as a gambling industry custodian with the Casino Guru Awards which will celebrate the most committed operators in the industry and the professionals who shape its future. The inaugural edition of the event is designed to raise awareness for the Awards and help the most deserving companies serve as good role models industrywide and reach a broader audience.</p>
<p>To participate, companies may nominate themselves through the end of November 2022. Casino Guru will also select worthwhile nominees that will be added to our list in a process that is fair, transparent, and above all else, distinguishes and focuses on merit. A shortlist will be announced in December 2022 with the official ceremony held online in February 2023. All decisions regarding the outcome of the event will be carried out by hand-picked judges.</p>
<p>Casino Guru Awards will feature judges from some of the biggest companies that are well-established names in the industry, including Kindred Group, Betsson, Gamban, Epic Risk Management, Gordon Moody, and more. The panel will include close to 15 external judges and five of Casino Guru's own specialists. Commenting on this project, Daniela Kianicová, PR &amp; External relations Lead at Casino Guru, said:</p>
<p>"Casino Guru Awards is a natural continuation of the efforts Casino Guru has put into making gambling safer, fairer, and more transparent for everyone. We worked on the Awards and the categories with the idea to emphasize areas of the industry that are crucial to consumer safety and can always be improved on.</p>
<p>Our commitment to safer and responsible gambling is unflinching and I am honored to have the opportunity to work alongside the industry's most distinct professionals to make gambling safer for players. It's clear to me that Casino Guru Awards will be a benchmark for companies in the industry and a high accolade for any entity that wants to help write the gambling world of tomorrow."</p>
<p>Casino Guru Awards will run in several categories which will focus on a mix of business achievements and consumer needs. The company feels strongly that achieving a level of excellence across these verticals will result in better gambling industry for all. The categories include "The Fairest Bonus Policy," which assesses the fairness of Bonus T&amp;Cs and whether a bonus accounts for breaching applicable rules by accident, among other and equally important criteria.</p>
<p>"The Fairest General T&amp;Cs" category will focus on how a casino’s T&amp;Cs ensure that customers are protected and safeguarded and that they do not fall prey to predatory or hidden rules and details. In true Casino Guru spirit, "The Most Impactful SocialResponsibility Initiative" will focus on those operators and companies who understand the importance of responsible gambling and problem gambling prevention.</p>
<p>There is a separate category that will independently assess "The Best Implementation of RG Tools" and "The Most Transparent Casino." Another important category will be "The Most Effective Handling Complaints," which is another area where the Casino Guru team feels improvements can be made, giving operators an incentive to operate in a clear and consumer-centric way. Casino Guru is experienced in this particular area having established the Casino Complaint Resolution Center which has thousands of closed cases already.</p>
<p>Last but not least, there is "The Voice of the People" which will be decided by the players, without any intervention. You may find out more about the Casino Guru Awards on the official page, including details about submitting a nomination, who the judges are and what to expect in the months that lie ahead.</p>
