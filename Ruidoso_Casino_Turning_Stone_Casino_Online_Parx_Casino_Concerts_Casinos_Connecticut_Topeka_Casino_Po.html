<p>PokerBaazi and the Asian Poker Tour (APT) are coming together for an exciting new opportunity for Indian poker players who will get a chance to partake in the inaugural APT India Online Series on January 15, 2021.</p>
<p>First-Ever ATP India Online Series</p>
<p>Indian online gambling giant PokerBaazi.com has announced an exciting new partnership with Asian Poker Tour (APT) – the largest poker event organizer in Asia. The partnership is set to bring about the first-ever ATP India Online Series in the coming year and is likely to entice many players, especially given its massive reward pool of over ₹ 81m (~$1.1m).</p>
<p>The series is set to launch on 15 January 2021 and will be exclusive to Indian players. Participants will fight over the substantial prize pool in dozens of tournaments over a period of 12 days. The finals will take place on 26 January. The main event holds a guaranteed prize of around $270,000, while the rest of the pool will be divided between the remaining 47 tournaments in the series. The event will be held on PokerBaazi’s own online gambling platform.</p>
<p>Players will also be competing for prestigious trophies and rings. The winners of the Main, Mini and Championship Events will be awarded an ATP trophy and a ring, in addition to the monetary prize. The winners of nine of the other events will also receive ATP trophies.</p>
<p>Tickets to the main tournament can be earned through a series of satellite tournaments. The satellite tournaments will be hosted on PokerBaazi from 9 December onward.</p>
<p>Mutual Benefit and Respect</p>
<p>This strategic partnership is likely to be highly beneficial for ATP as it would extend the company’s reach into the lucrative Indian market. The Indian gambling market has been growing at a staggering pace, especially the online gambling and gaming scene. PokerBaazi is already a well-established player and will benefit from the further increase in engagement that the event will likely generate.</p>
<p>Baazi Games Founder and CEO Navkiran Singh stressed the importance and significance of this partnership. He added the Asian Poker Tour is one of the most valuable poker properties across the globe and that Baazi Games was honored to work alongside the company on this endeavor.</p>
<p>“This truly is a great time to be a poker player in India.”</p>

<p>The ATP holds international renown and commonly sees participation of big-name professional poker players. The company is already enjoying a growing player community in India, which will only be further enhanced by the tournament.</p>
<p>According to APT General Manager and Executive Tournament Director Lloyd Fontillas, the most exciting aspect of this mutually-beneficial partnership is PokerBaazi’s live poker room. Mr. Fontillas has hinted that in addition to the upcoming ATP India Online series, players can look forward to a possible live event before the end of 2021.</p>
