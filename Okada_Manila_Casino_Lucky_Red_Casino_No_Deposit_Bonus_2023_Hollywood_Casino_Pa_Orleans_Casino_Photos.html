<p>Swintt will provide Bragg Gaming with its Premium and Select suites of content, expanding both companies’ presence in the Netherlands and beyond</p>
<p>Gaming content studio Swintt has joined forces with the leading iGaming provider Bragg Gaming in a new deal. As per the deal, the former company will supply Bragg with iGaming titles.</p>
<p>Swintt to Power Bragg with Games</p>
<p>Swintt made headlines by inking a number of important deals in 2022 and is now continuing its momentum by signing an agreement with yet another notable supplier. The deal will see Bragg distribute Swintt games to its client operators in the Netherlands and beyond.</p>
<p>Following this arrangement, the games from Swintt’s Premium and Select ranges will become available to Dutch customers, thus expanding the studio’s global presence. Bragg is one of the go-to suppliers in the Netherlands and is working with many of the big companies in the country, which will further help to popularize Swintt among local companies and gamblers.</p>
<p>A selection of around 150 games in total will be brought onto Bragg’s platform. This will include both classic games for traditional casino aficionados, as well as a selection of modern and innovative slots for those wanting to try out something new. Hit series such as Swintt’s Books will now hit the market providing players with a rich variety of traditional games to choose from. Innovation enthusiasts, on the other hand, will be able to enjoy the exciting Xtra series or the exclusive The Crown slot which stars Vinnie Jones.</p>
<p>The large suite of games Swintt has to offer will be a welcome addition to Bragg Gaming’s portfolio in a deal that is sure to benefit both parties.</p>
<p>Swintt’s chief executive officer, David Mann, spoke about the agreement. He noted that Swintt has been hard at work expanding the brand, inking important deals with many new operators and suppliers. As a result, the studio is delighted to kick off 2023 by inking yet another agreement, this time with the famous Bragg Gaming Group.</p>
<p>Mann said:</p>
<p>The collaboration will enable Swintt to capitalize on increased market access by connecting with Bragg’s numerous online casino partners and offering our award-winning selection of slots to their customers, particularly in the Netherlands, where Bragg Gaming Group has an incredible network of clients. David Mann, CEO, Swintt</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Lara Falzon, Bragg Gaming Group’s president and chief operating officer, believes that the agreement with Swintt will allow her company to further consolidate its power in the Netherlands. The ability to provide Bragg’s partnering operators with content from the most sought-after suppliers is key to the company’s strategy.</p>
<p>By adding Swintt Premium and Swintt Select slots, the supplier will be able to provide its casino clients with further choices and more exciting games for their customers.</p>
<p>Two months ago, Swintt inked an agreement with Pariplay, further bolstering its global footprint.</p>
