    <h1>Royale Casino Cast Casino In The Poconos Seminole Hard Rock Casino Hotel Casinos In Tucson Planet Ho</h1>

<p>Entain has become the second company in as many days to announce that it will be scaling down its flagship esports B2C business after Real Luck Group confirmed a similar move, as reported by Casino Guru News at the beginning of the week.</p>
<p>Since Thursday, October 9, Unikrn has not been taking any more customer deposits and the affiliate program has been shuttered, as communicated to partner companies in email. Whether this constitutes a withdrawal from the exciting but often difficult to pinpoint vertical is difficult to say right now.</p>
<p>Entain confirms that it is "repositioning" its B2C operations with Unikrn to ensure an effective structuring of its business. In a voice that resonated with Real Luck Group’s own downsizing, Entain said that it would now leverage Unikrn’s industry-leading capabilities focused on esports betting to give a boost to its other brands around the world.</p>
<p>Unikrn is a standout company in the world of esports, and it was founded by Rahul Sood in 2014, promoting esports betting, an underserviced vertical in the gambling industry even to this day. Entain bought Unikrn back in 2021 for close to £50m although the specific price tag is still subject to some speculation.</p>
<p>The website was under tight wraps with Entain promising to reveal a revamped look and functionality for Unikrn.</p>
<p>The entertainment giant pinned much hope on Unikrn, and called the brand its official launch into esports betting in a more serious capacity at a time when opponents are moving tentatively on the segment, and some companies, such as Rivalry and Pinnacle have embraced the segment wholeheartedly.</p>
<p>Unikrn remained active since its relaunch and entered various partnerships, notably with the BLAST, a tournament host that runs some of the biggest Counter-Strike competitive gaming events around the world.</p>
<p>As to an actual commitment to turning Unikrn into a B2B powerhouse for the esports industry, there is nothing substantial yet, but Entain is not a company that leaves its assets just gathering dust.</p>
