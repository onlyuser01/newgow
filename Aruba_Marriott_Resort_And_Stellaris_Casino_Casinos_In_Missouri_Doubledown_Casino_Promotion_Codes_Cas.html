<p>Hello, zorans71. I have read the link you shared, &amp; it has opened my mind indeed. Thank you! I am fairly new to all of this, Gambling. I just turned 64 last month, on May 16th &amp; before last year I didn't like gambling. The only gambling that I ever did was on my own skill in bowling &amp; golf. I couldn't see risking hard-earned money on something where I had no control over the outcome. I know lots of people who lose thousands in video gaming &amp; still continue doing so. I have an analytical mindset &amp; understand risking money on a push of a button is crazy. About 2 years ago while online, roulette came into my life. I believed it was almost impossible to win. Predicting where the ball will rest requires ESP or luck &amp; I wasn't going to risk money on either. It wasn't until I looked into the rules of play. I believe you cannot judge anything by its cover. I found out that roulette was more than placing a wager on a number. There are 11 ways a wager can be placed &amp; by combining 2 or more can increase the odds of winning, &amp; here I am. It took over a year before I wagered real money. I played demo roulette every spare time I had, trying hundreds of systems. I have won over 2 million or more in practice roulette. I was involved in a car crash 2 years ago &amp; couldn't work. I'm retired on a small retirement &amp; decided to play roulette to supplement my income. I started with $611 &amp; decided $1500 a month would be enough. That comes to $50 a day. I started doing 1 session a day, ending when I had won $50 or so. 30 days later I had won $10,385. That was the most money I had made in a month. I started the next 30 days on a faster pace. With a bankroll of $2500, I had reached $10,690, in 25 days. While I was doing that I went on a spending spree with the $7800 I withdrew from the previous month. This time I withdrew $5690, leaving $5,000 for my bankroll. That's when I lost my mind. In practice with $5000 bank, I had doubled that at least 15 times, &amp; that was what I intended to do. Yes, that was stupid. I lost it all in one session. Why doesn't the system that I used to win thousands, struggle to win now? That is why I suspect cheating.</p>
<p>My monthly bills is more than my pension &amp; that's where what I had won has gone to. That was 4 months ago. Since then I had on 4 occasions with $200- $300 each played roulette without success. I'm due to receive compensation from that car wreck soon &amp; I'm planning on assigning $2500-$5000 towards my bankroll.</p>
<p>I came up with this mantra when I started this it's..." Be disciplined, be smart, stay focused &amp; play without emotions." I didn't do that &amp; lost. I'd love to get your rules if I may. Honestly, because of what I had accomplished playing roulette, I intend on continuing playing roulette. $1500_ $2000 a month is my target, but after winning about $20k in 2 months, I'll be tempted to win more. I believe that if I can control my emotions I'll be alright. Thank you for taking the time in reading my experience. I truly appreciate you.
