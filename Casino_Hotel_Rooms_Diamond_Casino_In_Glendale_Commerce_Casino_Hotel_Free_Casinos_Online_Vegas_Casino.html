<p>FanDuel has become the exclusive fantasy, sports betting, horse racing, and gaming partner for Boardroom, a Kevin Durant and Rich Kleiman-owned sports business media network. The companies have signed a multi-year partnership that will allow them to work on fan-focused content in the coming months, and FanDuel will become the exclusive odds provider for the network.</p>
<p>Content Is King in FanDuel, Boardroom Partnership</p>
<p>FanDuel is looking to define its brand to the point that it is synonymous with sports betting. It’s in this spirit that FanDuel CMO Mike Raffensperger noted that it is important to him to “build the American sportsbook of record,” something that will be accomplished through the newly-minted collaboration. Raffensperger further noted the inherent value of bringing great content to customers:</p>
<p>“Content creation has always been a focal point for us as we bring our other premier real money gaming products to customers across the US.” CMO Mike Raffensperger</p>
<p>The partnership will allow the companies to distribute their content across the web, video, audio, editorial, and social media while promoting FanDuel as Boardroom’s exclusive partner for sports betting, fantasy sports, horse racing, gaming, casino, and poker.</p>
<p>The partners will co-create and distribute a show across both companies’ channels as part of the deal. FanDuel will also benefit from having a weekly section on the network’s newsletter, “Boardroom Breakers,” that will be dedicated to its latest odds, data, content, and promotions, while Boardroom’s editorial team will contribute monthly articles to FanDuel’s content site, The Duel.</p>
<p>FanDuel Continues to Reach Audiences in the US</p>
<p>Boardroom and Thirty-Five Ventures Co-CEO Rich Kleiman expressed his high hopes for making incredible content and extending the partnership into the future. According to Kleiman, the sports betting business will remain a major force, and the opportunity to partner with FanDuel is exciting.</p>
<p>FanDuel has more than 12 million registered users across 14 states. The company turned heads when it signed NFL-punter-turned-media-personality Pat McAfee for a four-year $120 million deal. It also has partnerships with Charles Barkley, Jordan Spieth, TNT, and publications like The Gist and The Ringer.</p>
<p>FanDuel has also signed on a range of similar content partnerships. In January, the company teamed up with Sports Gambling Guides to reach the website’s 10 million social media users who are avid sports fans and bettors. The company has maintained a strong presence with some of the most significant competitions in the United States, including a recent partnership extension with the PGA Tour.</p>
