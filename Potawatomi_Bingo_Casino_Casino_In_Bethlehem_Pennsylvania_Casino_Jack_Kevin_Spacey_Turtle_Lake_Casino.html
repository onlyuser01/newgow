<p>Philadelphia Eagles vs. Seattle Seahawks is the MNF game of Week 15. It’s taking place at Lumen Field in Seattle which is where the Seahawks are undefeated against the Eagles since 2008. Will that change on Monday?</p>
<p>The Philadelphia Eagles dropped out of the No. 1 spot in the National Football Conference after losing their last two games. This, however, doesn’t mean their form has decreased. After all, they played against two really tough opponents. However, alarm bells would start ringing if they lost to the Seattle Seahawks on Monday night.</p>
<p>Judging by the Eagles vs. Seahawks odds, such a thing is not very likely to happen. In fact, practically everything is going in Philly’s favor ahead of the Week 15 MNF game apart from the fact that it’s played in Seattle.</p>

<p>Philadelphia Eagles Coming to Seattle to Get a Win</p>
<p>The Eagles are 10-3 overall with two of their three losses happening in the last two games. It sounds bad, but there’s an explanation – they lost to the Dallas Cowboys and San Francisco 49ers who have been in top shape throughout the 2023 season.</p>
<p>Before that, we saw the Eagles beat a number of heavyweights, including the Buffalo Bills, Kansas City Chiefs, Miami Dolphins, and even the Cowboys.</p>
<p>Given the circumstances, that is, a very ugly schedule, these guys have been fantastic in 2023. This goes particularly for their offensive team which is sixth-best in the league with 26.3 PPG. With QB Jalen Hurts in top shape, it’s no surprise it’s been like that.</p>
<p>This guy is 10th in passing yards and tied 12th in passing touchdowns. He’s also been great when it comes to running the ball, scoring 12 rushing TDs already. The reason why these stats are important is that Philly’s next opponent isn’t great at defending against runs. In fact, the Seahawks are the NFL’s fourth-worst defense in rushing TDs conceded.</p>
<p>Will Seattle Seahawks Finally Lose to Eagles?</p>
<p>The Seattle Seahawks have won every single of their last seven duels with the Philadelphia Eagles. However, they haven’t played against them since 2020. Fast-forward to December 18, 2023, and neither team looks the same as before.</p>
<p>The Eagles are now a team with Super Bowl ambitions while the Seahawks are struggling to challenge for a Wild Card ticket to the postseason. Pete Carroll’s boys are 6-7 in 2023, which isn’t bad at all. However, they did lose each of their last four games.</p>
<p>But there’s a caveat. Two of those games were against the 49ers, one against the Cowboys, and one against the Rams. Plus, the loss to the LA-based team was by just one point.</p>
<p>Philadelphia Eagles vs. Seattle Seahawks Prediction</p>
<p>We don’t think the Seahawks have the player quality to play in the 2023 postseason and their 6-7 record is a sort of a glitch.</p>
<p>Sure, they did put on a good fight against some real heavyweights, but we just can’t see them doing much against the motivated Eagles. The boys from Philly are coming to Seattle determined to win and no one can stop them.</p>
<p>Pick: Philadelphia Eagles -4 (-110) &amp; over 47.5 points (-110)</p>
