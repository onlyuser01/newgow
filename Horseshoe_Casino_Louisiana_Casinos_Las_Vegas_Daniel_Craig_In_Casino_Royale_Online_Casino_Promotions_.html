    <h1>Horseshoe Casino Louisiana Casinos Las Vegas Daniel Craig In Casino Royale Online Casino Promotions</h1>

<p>Dear Sir or Madam,</p>
<p>I made a profit of EUR 4,000.00 at Tipico Casino. I was really happy about it and had the payment paid to my bank account at about 0:45 at night.</p>
<p>I waited about 5 days for the payment. Now I was taken aback because the money wasn't there yet.</p>
<p>When I researched my online Tipico account, I was horrified to find that the payment was canceled at around 8:30 a.m. on the same day the payment was made, paid back into the online casino and paid in full in EUR 125.00 steps (max ) was allegedly gambled by me. Of course I didn't do that.</p>
<p>After doing some research, I found that I am not the only one affected and Tipico very often deducts this stitch at higher winnings.</p>
<p>I consciously say that Tipcio is pulling this trick, because with common sense it is clear that I was not hacked or anything like that, as a hacker would try to transfer the money to his account and not to pointlessly downplay the profit. The only person who has something from this process is Tipico himself, since the credit does not have to be paid out and the customer can be accused of gambling addiction.</p>
<p>I find it astonishing that I read forum entries from 2014, in which exactly that is described and Tipico can still pull off this stitch without consequences. I actually thought that a well-known company like Tipico is serious. Well thought wrong.</p>
<p>The problem has been reported to Tipico. I was held up for about 6 weeks until I finally received the notification that no outside influence could be found. So money is gone!</p>
<p>With the hope that you can help me in some way I stay</p>
<p>Best regards</p>
<p>Bilal</p>
