<p>Hi Nick,</p>
<p>The verification started on 11th of September, and i provided them my ID, selfie with ID, payment confirmation with deposit method verified, and proof of address. After uploading all this they confirmed it and released $750 of the $1361 to me. Shortly after, they sent me a message saying they needed to verify over skype to confirm my identity, then withdrew the payment of $750 which was taken back out of my payz account. I tried to contact them to schedule in a Skype call as they requested, which was ignored for a few days. I sent follow up e-mails and a member of their team apologised for missing my email and then scheduled a call with me. When they called, i spoke with them over Skype where my video was on so they could confirm that it was indeed me on the call. They asked some questions like my name, address and email which I confirmed with no problem. The only question I wasn't sure about was when they asked me exactly what game I played - and I told them I could not recall at the time as its been around 2 weeks since I played and I also play on other casinos. To add on to this, my account was disabled so i could not log on to check my game history. After this the person I spoke with said he would call me once he had an update regarding my withdrawal. A few hours later after the call i received an email with them highlighting the anti-fraud terms and conditions. I had told them i read it very thoroughly and believe i did not breach any of the terms there, and they could call me again over skype if there was any misunderstanding at all, or ask for literally any document for me to confirm my identity. After requesting this, they refused to review my case and said it was their decision to close my account and they will not review my case further. This is extremely unfair on my end as I am willing to provide any document they ask or get on a call again to verify whatever they were unsatisfied about last time, but they are not willing to even try. At this point it feels like they have just stolen money from me.</p>
