    <h1>Hotels Near Hard Rock Casino Cincinnati All Casino Action Silver Sevens Hotel And Casino Sands Casin</h1>

<p>During an in game session my balance suddenly dropped from 175 (aprox) to 45 euro.</p>
<p>Out of nowhere the balance was just removed.</p>
<p>However even weirded, my balance states a total of 35, 44euro in bonus and NEGATIVE 9 euro in cash. I've asked chat how this could be and they would investigate. After several days still no answer, i send an email that took 7 days to get an answer for, only to admit something was wrong (after I had to send screenshots,?) , but if it would be OK if they would give me 35,00 in bonus instead? (SERIOUS??)</p>
<p>I said no and that i wanted my balance back.</p>
<p>Now anther week and a half went by and still no answerrs, chat is almost never available and tonight i finally got a rep on the chat. The answer was pretty simple from his side: "the department is not available today, TRY again tomorrow".</p>
<p>This was my first (and last) ever deposit at this casino.</p>
<p>They seem to lack any communication, have no idea what is wrong, remove balance from account and hope that players accept a little refund in stead.</p>
<p>Scam casino for sure</p>
