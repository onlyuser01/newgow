<p>Thailand may be pushing ahead with a plan to approve up to five casino resorts in the country, largely seen as drivers of additional revenue that dovetails nicely with the country’s high tourism profile. The matter was discussed by a committee at the Thai National Assembly, which is currently trying to gauge whether the benefits to society outweigh potential risks.</p>
<p>However, there is some clarity as to where the five locations of potential sights for the casino resorts are. The committee mentioned by name a number of possible sites, in the north, east, and south. While only five will be shortlisted, the potential locations are more than the licenses that will be granted, guaranteeing that Thailand actually has a good card to play when looking to establish a casino resort, or five.</p>
<p>Should the committee clear the idea, it can then submit it to the national government. If it does, its passage would depend on an amendment to the country’s Gambling Act which should be pitched to the government at some point later this year, sources close to the matter said. Thailand certainly sees the benefits of these projects.</p>
<p>The country hopes that it can attract foreign investors and capital, create new jobs locally, and make sure that the economy is chugging at a good pace at home. Of course, there will be guardrails to ensure that not everyone is allowed to enter the resorts.</p>
<p>For example, the committee is said to discuss 20 as the cut-off age for gamblers. Anyone younger than that would not be able to enter. Individuals would have to also be in a financial good station, which probably means presentable and having the means to gamble. How such controls would be enforced, though, is yet not clear.</p>
<p>The initial plan as it is laid down now reportedly is going to seek 30% tax on casino gross gaming revenue, but this is still open to debate. The main concern here is to not over-regulate but to also make sure that casinos are paying their due. A recent overhaul of the Macau gambling system came with no leniency in the tax code despite the pandemic.</p>
<p>Yet another objective set out by the committee is to make sure that illegal gambling in the country is tackled once and for all. While an ambitious goal, building more legal alternative options to play at home without breaking any laws is a welcome move by the country.</p>
