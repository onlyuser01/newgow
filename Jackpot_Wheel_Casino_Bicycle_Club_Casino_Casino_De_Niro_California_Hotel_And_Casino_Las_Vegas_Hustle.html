<p>British fans will get to see famous music and comedy festivals for free</p>
<p>A few months after inking a boxing partnership with Wasserman, trusted British betting operator Ladbrokes has unveiled a new rewards platform for its fans, allowing them to win various experiences. The new scheme is called Ladbrokes LIVE and will provide players with chances to earn free tickets to a variety of live events.</p>
<p>The launch of the new platform is made possible by Ladbrokes’ partnership with The O2 venue, the music brand NME and the event organizer AEG Presents.</p>
<p>Under the agreement with these parties, Ladbrokes will establish a Ladbrokes LIVE Private Box at The O2 where subscribers will be able to get premium tickets.</p>
<p>The new platform will also provide Ladbrokes players with chances to grab tickets for other shows, such as the Just for Laughs comedy festival, the Luno Presents All Points East music festival and other festivals across the United Kingdom. Fans will also be able to secure access to NME’s Club NME events.</p>
<p>Ladbrokes Wants to Connect Fans and Celebrities</p>
<p>Representatives addressed the launch of Ladbrokes Live with Georgina Iceton, AEG Global Partnerships’ director of partnership activation saying that her team is “pleased to welcome” Ladbrokes as a brand partner. Iceton also expressed her excitement about welcoming Ladbrokes customers to world-famous venues, such as The O2 and other festivals.</p>
<p>Iceton said that the new Ladbrokes LIVE Private Box will “bring an exciting new dimension of entertainment” to all visitors of The O2.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, NME’s chief operating and commercial officer, Holly Bishop, shared her delight to announce the return of the legendary Club NME. She promised that it will continue to provide fans with “unforgettable live music experiences” at premium venues across Britain.</p>
<p>The partnership with Ladbrokes will allow the company to make tickets completely free, allowing more customers to attend the events.</p>
<p>Finally, Kelly Rose, Ladbrokes’ head of brand, commented on the matter, saying that the launch will allow Ladbrokes to enter “an exciting new era” of connecting thousands of fans with artists and talent.</p>
<p>In The O2, AEG Presents, and NME we’re working with three of the biggest and most iconic brands in the entertainment industry and this means we will be able to reward our audiences with the chance to attend some of the most exciting live shows in Britain for free. Kelly Rose, head of brand, Ladbrokes</p>
<p>Despite its intentions to connect fans with celebrities, Ladbrokes recently came under fire by the ASA, which deemed its new promotional Tweets, especially one featuring celebrity Jake Paul, to be “irresponsible.”</p>
