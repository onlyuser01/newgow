<p>Even as Macau’s gaming future has a certain air of uncertainty surrounding it, casino operators continue to push forward as if everything is normal. In some cases, it’s obligatory. Melco Resorts International already has a lot of money invested in its Studio City property and will see it through to the end. To help support the $1.3-billion expansion of the project, Melco is now bringing in a global hotel name. Marriott International will be included in this next phase of the resort.</p>
<p>Melco Partners with Marriott in Macau</p>
<p>Melco announced a partnership with Marriott this week. The hotel’s W Hotels Worldwide brand will be added to Studio City Phase 2.</p>
<p>W Macau – Studio City will open in December of next year. It is expected to have 557 guestrooms, including 127 suites. There are also wellness facilities such as a spa, gym, and indoor swimming pool.</p>
<p>Melco said that it will also aim at enhancing Macau’s social scene through “high-energy public spaces and culinary experiences.” It will include Living Room – W’s signature hotel lobby design – and the social hub WOOBAR. The W Sound Suite, which includes an on-site recording studio, is also part of the package.</p>
<p>Two restaurants will be offering a variety of international cuisines with an Asian flair.</p>
<p>“In line with Marriott International’s ‘Brand + Destination’ development strategy, we are excited to be partnering with Melco Resorts &amp; Entertainment to introduce W Macau – Studio City and bring the brand’s luxury lifestyle to Macau,” Henry Lee, Marriott International President, Greater China, said in a statement.</p>
<p>Conferences and Conventions Important to Macau</p>
<p>The hotel will have 11,840 square feet of event and meeting space. This is in addition to the many new attractions at Studio City Phase 2, which include an indoor and outdoor water park, a six-screen Cineplex, and world-class residencies. Melco chief operating officer – Macau Resorts, David Sisk, stated:</p>
<p>“W Hotels is, without doubt, one of the world’s iconic luxury lifestyle brands that will elevate Studio City’s hospitality offerings to a new level. Together we look forward to bringing new experiences to our guests and further strengthening Macau’s proposition as a world-class leisure destination.”</p>
<p>Macau is in the middle of a major transition, the outcome of which still isn’t entirely clear. In addition to the almost certain and complete exit of the city’s junket market, Macau’s new gambling laws still haven’t been revealed. There is also a question over how the new casino concession structure will look next summer. With increased pressure from mainland China, Macau is likely to shift slightly away from casinos to focus more on other forms of entertainment.</p>
