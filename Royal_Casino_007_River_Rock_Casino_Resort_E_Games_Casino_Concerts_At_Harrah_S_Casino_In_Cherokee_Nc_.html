<p>PowerPlay.com has expressed confidence in the expansion in Canada, hailing the jurisdiction as one of the best places where the gambling brand can launch and gain momentum and traction with local players. The new website is launching in Ontario, Canada, as the province legalized private betting and gaming in 2022 and has been reaping the benefits thereof ever since.</p>
<p>Ontario Gives PowerPlay Go Ahead to Enter Regulated Market</p>
<p>PowerPlay has plenty to offer when it comes to sports and gaming both, bringing betting markets for ice hockey, NFL, MLB, European soccer, basketball, and more. The website’s portfolio is also strengthened by the availability of a dedicated casino suite that hosts slots and live casino games.</p>
<p>Sports fans can expect to find in-play and pre-match betting options around the clock as well as all iGaming products they can ask for that will run 24/7 as well. To access the Ontario domain, players need only visit PowerPlay dot com which will automatically redirect them to the dedicated website that is operated for residents of Ontario.</p>
<p>PowerPlay is also happy to introduce its offer through dedicated iOS and Android apps that are readily accessible to local players. PowerPlay CEO Dean Serrao has welcomed the opportunity to see the brand launch in the regulated market in the country, and in North America’s potentially biggest iGaming markets.</p>
<p>Our worldwide teams have been working around the clock to ensure players have the best possible site, and the fact that players can now seamlessly access the platform across multiple localized instances will further enhance that experience. PowerPlay CEO Dean Serrao</p>
<p>PowerPlay’s Ongoing Canadian Story</p>
<p>Serrao was similarly excited about Canada in general, arguing that the country has been a pivotal part of the company’s growth strategy since 2018 when PowerPlay originally launched there. Ontario, though, is a brand new opportunity for the brand, website, and the team that has worked so hard to get the company to where it is today.</p>
<p>PowerPlay provides a variety of payment methods as well including popular options for Canadian players, which include Paysafecard, credit and debit cards, and Interac.</p>
