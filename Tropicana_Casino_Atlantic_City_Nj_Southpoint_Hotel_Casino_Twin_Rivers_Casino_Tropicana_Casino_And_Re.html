    <h1>Tropicana Casino Atlantic City Nj Southpoint Hotel Casino Twin Rivers Casino Tropicana Casino And Re</h1>

<p>Hey.</p>
<p>I see you guys can help with problems with online casiono etc, the complain sections didt work on your homepage so i wonder what i should do.</p>
<p>I done a withdraw there 3 times and they cancel it withing 24h and ask for different documents everytime instead of all in one after first withdraw request.</p>
<p>But still i accept that and all 3 times i sent them the documents they needed and it got accepted right away within 24h so i try new withdraw after every time.</p>
<p>So now when all document accepted like:</p>
<p>Passport Accepted</p>
<p>Proof of Identity with face beside of passport Accepted</p>
<p>Proof of adress Accepted</p>
<p>Credit Card i deposit from Accepted</p>
<p>Utility Bill Accepted</p>
<p>And now also i send in bank Bank statement that they hast even ask me for and im fully KYC veriefed as i been since i register on the site.</p>
<p>Now things start to go really slow and say that this "payment department" has alot to do every time i ask every day after 72h (as stated on the homepage that withdraw should take) whats going on with my pending withdraw and its not get accepted.</p>
<p>It took less than 24h to cancel it 3 times berfore when they ask for more document but now when they have it all nothing happens and it on "pending" for over 1 week now and i can still cancel it by myself so they hast don anything and still get kinda Auto respons from the support bot in Chat and on email and it looks like this</p>
