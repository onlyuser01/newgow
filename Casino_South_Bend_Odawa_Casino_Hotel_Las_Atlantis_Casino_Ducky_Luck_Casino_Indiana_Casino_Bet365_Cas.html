<p>Dear candotti2002,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. I have checked the terms and conditions, and this is what I found:</p>
<p>1.3 Per quanto riguarda i metodi di pagamento che richiedono un intestatario specifico, per effettuare versamenti occorre utilizzarne solo uno di cui si è titolare. Nei casi in cui bet365 dovesse rilevare che il nome dell'intestatario non corrisponda a quello registrato con bet365, si riserva il diritto di considerare i versamenti effettuati sul conto come non validi (e le eventuali vincite derivanti da essi come nulle).</p>
<p>Furthermore, please check our Fair Gambling Codex for Players:</p>
<p>"For deposits and withdrawals, you should only use bank accounts and credit cards held in your own name. If you don't do this, you might get into trouble when trying to make a withdrawal. This rule is mostly in place to prevent credit card misuse and also because of international anti-money-laundering regulations."</p>
<p>Please understand that this rule has been breached. Some exceptions might be allowed by casinos when depositing or withdrawing funds using a joint card or this possibility is communicated beforehand. Technically it is very difficult to check who’s the owner of the payment method at the depositing stage. This can be checked only during the account verification, which is usually done when a withdrawal is requested. Therefore, it is a player’s responsibility to use allowed payment methods only.</p>
<p>If you’re not able to prove that you are a legitimate owner of the payment method and you haven’t received approval from the casino allowing you to use a third-party payment method, I’m afraid there’s not much we can do for you.</p>
<p>Thank you very much in advance for your reply and understanding.</p>
<p>Best regards</p>
<p>Veronika</p>
