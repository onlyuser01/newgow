<p>After agreeing to divest its UK lottery business last month, Ontario Teachers' Plan agreed to offload its lottery exposure in the US</p>
<p>Allwyn, the winner of the Fourth UK National Lottery bid, and the owner of the current UK National Lottery operator, Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan, announced an agreement for the acquisition of Camelot Lottery Solutions group of companies for an undisclosed fee.</p>
<p>Expanding Operations into the US</p>
<p>The acquisition of Chicago-based Camelot LS Group allows Allwyn an entry into the US lottery market as the group has long-term agreements to operate the Illinois Lottery as a private manager via its subsidiary Camelot Illinois LLC, and with the Arkansas Scholarship Lottery to enhance the lottery’s operations.</p>
<p>“We have always viewed the US market as an important part of Allwyn’s future growth story, and the acquisition of Camelot LS Group, is the right step,” commented chief executive officer of Allwyn Robert Chvátal.</p>
<p>Outlining that Allwyn’s objective has always been to leverage technology, efficiency and safety to help lottery operators enhance player engagement and raise more funds for good causes, Chvátal stated that “both Allwyn and Camelot share a passion about the lottery business,” committed to delivering “value to [their] customers and growing lottery returns to communities.”</p>
<p>Besides managing the Illinois Lottery and partnering with the Arkansas Scholarship Lottery, Camelot LS Group provides products and services to lottery operators and their players in Europe and North America via its technology arm. It is a subsidiary of Camelot UK, the operator of the UK National Lottery which will also be acquired by the Czech-based lottery group.</p>
<p>Business Objectives Remain Unchanged</p>
<p>Camelot LS Group chief executive officer, Wayne Pickup, outlined the company’s commitment “to serving [its] customers, engaging players and growing lottery revenue” to bring benefits for the communities in which the lotteries operate.</p>
<p>He also added that the company, as a manager of the Illinois Lottery, has established close links with the Department of Lottery, collaborating “to drive responsible and sustainable growth to maximize revenue for the state,” and convinced that “combining the resources, expertise, and talent of Allwyn and Camelot LS Group” will be beneficial for all parties involved.</p>
<p>Allwyn announced that the Camelot LS Group leadership team will remain unchanged following the transaction completion and the business, enhanced with Allwyn’s over decade-long in-depth experience in operating and improving lotteries in Europe, will continue to serve its lottery partners.</p>
<p>Camelot LS Group will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Allwyn upon transaction close which is anticipated to happen in the first quarter of 2023, subject to customary closing conditions. The transaction will expand Allwyn’s current lottery operations in Austria, the Czech Republic, Greece, Cyprus and Italy.</p>
