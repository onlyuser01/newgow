<p>Resorts World Cruises to Tour China on First Cruise</p>

<p>Resorts World Cruises, the phoenix that arose from the failed cruise experiment of Genting Hong Kong’s founder, is ready to set sail. The company is going to hoist the anchor with Resorts World One, a ship that will take guests on a trip around Chinese waters.</p>

<p>Resorts World One, previously Genting’s Explorer Dream, is the first ship announced by Resorts World Cruises Pte Ltd, a company launched by Genting Hong Kong founder Lim Kok Thay last April. Now that China is relaxing its anti-COVID-19 rules, the vessel will become the first to operate around China.</p>
<p>According to Fleetmon, a ship tracking tool, the new cruise ship will sail from Singapore for two weeks as it takes over for Resorts World’s other cruise ship, Genting Dream. The cruise ship can accommodate 1,856 passengers in its 928 staterooms, though Resorts World hasn’t indicated how many guests will be on the maiden voyage.</p>
<p>Fair Winds and Following Seas</p>
<p>Resorts World One will launch its inaugural “repositioning cruise,” a cruise that has different embarkation and disembarkation points, on March 3. It will be a five-night trip from Singapore that has port calls in Ho Chi Minh City and Da Nang in Vietnam as it makes its way to Hong Kong. Anyone who wants a slightly longer trip can board on March 2 in Port Klang, Malaysia.</p>
<p>Dream Cruises, the cruise company Genting started, owned Explorer Dream until January of last year. The company had to file for liquidation after COVID-19 forced its sea-going plans into drydock.</p>
<p>Bills piled up and passengers found themselves left high and dry when debtors began to call. Genting then began selling off its assets after failing to secure new funds.</p>
<p>Since then, Genting founder Lim Kok Thay created Resorts World Cruises, which he asserts has no relationship with Genting other than the name. Genting is also behind the Resorts World casino brand, with operations in Las Vegas, New York, Singapore, and elsewhere.</p>
<p>Resorts World Cruises hopes to run Explorer Dream alongside its second ship, Genting Dream. That ship is already in service, but will need to take a break soon for maintenance. As a result, during its two-week downtime, Explorer Dream will take over any trips it would have made.</p>
<p>Genting Close to Wrapping Up</p>
<p>In the wake of the trouble it’s experienced and its inability to weather the storm, Genting Hong Kong will hold a meeting with creditors and other backers beginning Wednesday. They will discuss the appointment of a permanent liquidator to oversee the company’s assets for its reorganization.</p>
<p>They will hold a second meeting on Thursday, if necessary. In accordance with Bermuda law, all creditors of Genting Hong Kong and Dream Cruises have already received notification about the gatherings.</p>
<p>Creditors and backers will have the first shot at helping determine who will be the permanent liquidator. They could also form part of a committee that would be responsible for managing the process, should such a committee be necessary.</p>
