<p>There is a growing need for data on the efficacy of self-exclusion programs implemented by physical and online gaming operators</p>
<p>Geolocation technology and services provider GeoComply announced it has teamed with the International Center for Responsible Gaming (ICRG) for a research project on self-exclusion programs.</p>
<p>Is Enhancing These Programs Beneficial?</p>
<p>The two-year research funded by GeoComply will study the long-term effectiveness of voluntary self-exclusion schemes implemented by land-based and online gambling operators to determine whether these programs would be beneficial for the industry.</p>
<p>Arthur B. Paikowski, president of the ICRG, commented on the partnership and the need for additional research on the prolonged efficacy of voluntary self-exclusion programs, explaining why further assessment of these programs is needed.</p>
<p>“There is a necessity to determine whether enhancing these programs would result in more customer participation and whether this would be beneficial,” he said.</p>
<p>The research will seek to provide answers to questions about the most effective long-term form of self-exclusion; the ideal time for a player to utilize a self-exclusion tool – both, online or at a land-based gaming venue; operator or regulator criteria for letting people who have self-excluded back into gaming; the potential stigmatizing effect of self-exclusion blocking people from using these tools; the most suitable way of registering; and others.</p>
<p>Happy to Support the ICRG’s Research</p>
<p>Highlighting the company’s commitment to responsible gambling initiatives since its inception over a decade ago, Anna Sainsbury, co-founder and chief executive officer of GeoComply, outlined the industry need for further evidence about the effectiveness of self-exclusion programs.</p>
<p>“We need more data to support the industry’s actions around RG, and I am really happy that we can support the ICRG’s research in this important area,” Sainsbury stated.</p>
<p>Dedicated to promoting responsible gambling practices worldwide, the ICRG is seeking to prevent people from experiencing problem gambling and reduce the harmful impact of excessive gambling on their lives by working closely with governments, regulators and industry stakeholders to promote responsible gambling policies and industry best practices, as well as engaging in research on gambling behavior and the risks of gambling.</p>
<p>The results of the two-year research on self-exclusion programs funded by GeoComply will be published in October 2025.</p>
<p>Last month, the geolocation technology and services provider announced that Super Bowl LVII registered 100 million geolocation checks, with 7.4 million user accounts accessing the service over the weekend and many bettors choosing to wager from the stadium while watching the game.</p>
<p>Also in February, GeoComply saw its patent infringement case against competitor Xpoint dismissed in court after a federal judge ruled GeoComply’s patent invalid, stating that it sought to patent subject matter that cannot be patented.</p>
