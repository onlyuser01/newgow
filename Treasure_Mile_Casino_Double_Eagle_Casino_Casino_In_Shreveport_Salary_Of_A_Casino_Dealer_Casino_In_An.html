<p>The unnamed winner is a New Jersey resident who placed a 10-cent bet while playing Extra Chilli Megaways on DraftKings Casino. The Mexican-themed game is produced by Big Time Gaming (BTG).</p>
<p>The recent win was DraftKings Casino’s largest jackpot to date, Thomas Winter, DraftKings iGaming North America general manager, said in a statement released Monday.</p>
<p>This record-breaking jackpot marks our second million-dollar winner in the last two months,” Winter added.</p>
<p>Recently, DraftKings Casino’s progressive jackpot winners saw combined winnings total more than $8.7 million.</p>
<p>DraftKings began providing cross-game, genre-linked progressive jackpots for DraftKings Casino players in New Jersey in October. Eligible games include slot and table games, according to the company.</p>
<p>DraftKings offers hundreds of slot games designed on many different themes. The company’s table games include video poker, roulette, blackjack, and craps.</p>
<p>Caesars Palace Sees Four Players Win Jackpots</p>
<p>Four players won sizable jackpots within a four-and-a-half-hour stretch on Saturday night at Caesars Palace Las Vegas.</p>
<p>The lucky winners won between $100K and $240K starting at 7 p.m. The four jackpots totaled more than $650,000, according to Caesars Entertainment spokesperson Rudy Cavazos.</p>
<p>The first winner received $200,750 at 7 p.m. while playing video poker. Another video poker player won a $100K jackpot an hour later. That person made a $25 bet. At 11 p.m., a $121,500 jackpot was won on a slot machine game. A half-hour later, a video poker player won the evening’s largest jackpot of $240K.</p>
<p>Each player is a Caesars Rewards member.</p>
<p>Suncoast Casino Winner</p>
<p>A Suncoast Hotel and Casino player won more than $138K while playing Fortune Pai Gow Poker earlier this month.</p>
<p>The unnamed visitor to the Boyd Gaming property in Las Vegas bet $40 at the table game on April 16. He wound up with a $138,062.69 jackpot after hitting a straight flush on his fourth hand.</p>
<p>The player also wagered $1 on the progressive bonus and $6 on the fortune bonus. That led him to collect $6K more.</p>
<p>No word on how the player will spend the money, Las Vegas TV station KSNV reported.</p>
