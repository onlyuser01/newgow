    <h1>Casino Tucson Ocean Shores Casino Free Casino Free Spins Punt Casino Login Linq Hotel And Casino Bet</h1>

<p>I recently attempted to withdraw approximately $330 from BetFury in USDT. A few hours after this, my account was blocked.</p>
<p>The notice provided to me via email states it was for multi-accounting abuse. This is a surprise given I only have one account.</p>
<p>I reached out to their support live chat for clarification of the alleged abuse (transcript provided). Support was kindly able to advise it related to "bonus cabinet abuse" but otherwise would not provide more information. I am unsure which bonus is concerned. Bonuses that I recall using are the Fury Wheel, Cashback, BetFury Boxes, and most recently promo codes for deposit bonuses. I am assuming the allegations relate to the promo codes for deposit bonuses given they are the largest and most recent.</p>
<p>I used 3 promo codes provided to me via email newsletter in the last several days. These are the bonuses (all with a x35 wager requirement):</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Deposit 20 USD, receive 100 spins at bet value 0.20</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deposit 40 USD, receive 100 spins at bet value 0.40</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deposit 100 USD, receive 100 spins at bet value 1.00</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I completed 3 deposits for each bonus in USDT and played all bonus spins in the required slots game. I received a bonus balance of around $170. In the last few days I completed wagering requirements for bonuses 1 and 2 from in-house games and slots with one slots game being the main contributor. Wagers were done only from the main balance.</p>
<p>I requested a withdrawal of my main balance of around $330, forfeiting remaining bonus balance from bonus 3. I checked my account over the next couple of hours until I suddenly found I was unable to login and there was an email stating my account was blocked for multi-accounting abuse.</p>
<p>I maintain that I have actively held and used only one account. To the best of my knowledge, no one in my household has an account, and I have not knowingly used a proxy or VPN to access the service. The deposits for the bonuses, wagering and attempted withdrawal were all done from the same device on the same network in a timespan over the last few days.</p>
<p>My account was made in 2020. I have made deposits and withdrawals in recent months without issue. I have used the Fury Wheel, Cashback, and BetFury Boxes throughout the time I've had the account but have not used deposit bonuses before this.</p>
<p>I genuinely believe that some mistake or technological issue has occurred because I do not have more than one account. I am hoping that BetFury can provide evidence of the allegations to Casino.guru so that it can be reviewed independently.</p>
