<p>FanDuel boosted its responsible gaming commitment by signing a partnership with Gamban. Under the new agreement, players that would want to self-exclude will receive access to a free Gamban subscription.</p>
<p>Gamban and FanDuel Ink Partnership</p>
<p>FanDuel Group announced on Wednesday that it inked a key partnership with Gamban, a company that is a leader in gambling self-exclusion technology. FanDuel’s partnership complements the company’s comprehensive responsible gambling strategy.</p>
<p>As a result of the recent agreement, FanDuel, which is a part of Flutter Entertainment, will offer Gamban software to its customers. The service will be free of charge and available for patrons who would choose to self-exclude from the company’s real-money gaming sites or people who consider having gambling problems.</p>
<p>Furthermore, under the recent agreement, FanDuel customers who would like to self-exclude will be offered a free Gamban subscription. The subscription effectively would block the users from accessing thousands of gambling sites from up to 15 personal devices. Here, it is important to mention that regulatory approval of the agreement in the United States is still pending.</p>
<p>Exciting news: Gamban has partnered with @FanDuel to provide device-level blocking protection from gambling websites and apps to all those looking to self-exclude from FanDuel platforms.

<p>The Partnership Boosts FanDuel’s Responsible Gaming Commitment</p>
<p>The new agreement comes at a time when FanDuel committed to the American Gaming Association’s “Have a Game Plan” campaign. The multi-million-dollar commitment aims at educating consumers to bet responsibly and within limits.</p>
<p>In a statement, Carolyn Renzin, chief risk and compliance officer at FanDuel Group revealed that educating consumers about the importance of responsible gambling and betting within limits is not only ethically right but also a business imperative.</p>
<p>“Offering Gamban’s software to those customers signaling they need help adds another layer of protection for our customers, our program, and to the industry.” Carolyn Renzin, chief risk and compliance officer, FanDuel Group</p>
<p>Furthermore, she acknowledged that FanDuel already offers multiple tools which help consumers enjoy responsible sports wagering. In conclusion, Renzin said that by adding Gamban’s software, the company adds another layer of protection for its customers, its responsible gaming initiative, and the industry.</p>
<p>Besides Gamban’s software, FanDuel customers already have access to several tools which can help them wager safely. They can set deposit limits, time limits, as well as wager limits. Furthermore, players who would want to self-exclude can also use the “play safe” tool. This tool allows the users to self-exclude across all FanDuel sites and products.</p>
<p>The Recent Tie-up Marks a Long-Awaited Achievement for Gamban</p>
<p>In a statement, Jack Symons, founder of Gamban deemed the partnership a “massive moment for the industry“. Furthermore, he stressed that the company has been pushing to achieve this since its launch. Symons acknowledged that FanDuel is the largest real-money gaming provider in the United States. In conclusion, he said that with the partnership, FanDuel is showing other operators in the industry that offering self-exclusion support for vulnerable customers is important.</p>
<p>“This is a massive moment for the industry and one we’ve been pushing to achieve since the launch of Gamban.” Jack Symons, Gamban founder</p>
<p>FanDuel customers that choose Gamban’s self-exclusion services would block not only FanDuel websites but all real money gaming websites. Those include legal, as well as offshore operators, poker websites, online casinos, and others.</p>
<p>Last week, Gamban inked a similar agreement with another major industry player. The company inked an agreement with Kindred to provide its software for players in the US.</p>
