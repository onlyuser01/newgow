    <h1>Casino Joe Pesci Paddy Power Casino Casinos In California Ohio Casino Best Pa Online Casino Inter Mi</h1>

<p>Inter Miami continues its race for the 2023 MLS playoffs on Saturday, September 30, when the Herons will welcome New York City FC at DRV PNK Stadium in Fort Lauderdale</p>
<p>Lionel Messi missed Inter Miami‚Äôs last two games and we saw that the Herons really need him. They drew 1-1 with Orlando City in the MLS, followed by a 2-1 loss in the US Open Cup final to Houston Dynamo. He‚Äôs expected to come back on September 30 against NYCFC in a game that‚Äôs super-important for both teams.</p>
<p>The boys from New York are sitting in the last available playoff spot at the moment, with five points more than Inter Miami. However, the Herons have two games in hand, which means that if they win on Saturday, their chance of making the playoffs will skyrocket.</p>

<p>A Must-Win Game for Inter Miami</p>
<p>Inter Miami‚Äôs playoff future is in their hands. If the Herons win their five remaining games of the regular season, they‚Äôre going to book a spot in the postseason. So, can they actually do it?</p>

<p>The answer is yes, but only if Lionel Messi is healthy. The best player in the history of soccer missed two previous games, each of which Inter Miami failed to win. According to coach Martino, Messi is struggling with an old muscle injury, but is on a day-to-day basis and could return on Saturday.</p>
<p>The coach also pointed out that not just Messi but all of his players are jaded due to a tight schedule. Unlike most other teams, the Herons have been playing two games a week, while some of their key men also had to fulfill their national team duties earlier this month.</p>
<p>New York City FC is a Force to be Reckoned With</p>
<p>NYCFC is in great form with two straight wins in the MLS, the result of which is that this team has moved up to the No. 9 position in the East. It‚Äôs actually strange that the New Yorkers are struggling to book the ticket to the postseason given that this team has a pretty good roster.</p>
<p>The evidence of this is that just two years ago, New York City FC was the team that won the MLS Cup. Many of the players from the title-winning generation are still on the team, meaning that they‚Äôre a force to be reckoned with.</p>
<p>There are, however, some things going against them ahead of the Inter Miami duel on Saturday. First of all, they‚Äôre in trouble if Messi returns. Secondly, even if he doesn‚Äôt make a comeback, they‚Äôre likely to struggle because the game is played on Inter Miami‚Äôs turf. The last time they played there they lost 3-2. Plus, this season they‚Äôve been dreadful on the road, winning just one of their 15 away games in the MLS.</p>
<p>Inter Miami vs. NYCFC Prediction</p>
<p>Inter Miami‚Äôs plan is to get to the spot that‚Äôs currently occupied by NYCFC. The way to do it is to beat the New Yorkers on Saturday. With Messi on the field, they should have no problems doing it, but the question is whether he‚Äôs ready to come back.</p>
<p>We think he will return, but he probably won‚Äôt play for the full 90 minutes, which in turn, will make this game more interesting than what the MLS odds suggest. Nevertheless, we think the Herons will win. It won‚Äôt be easy, but they‚Äôll do it.</p>
<p>Pick: Inter Miami to win and over 2.5 goals</p>
