<p>Hello Adisa37,</p>
<p>Kindly note that you have been provided with the following information via email:</p>
<p>"On the 20th and 21st of April 2023, the game "Kings Vault" by Skywind experienced a configuration error and malfunction on PokerStars Casino. The game did not perform in line with the game specification and was subsequently removed from the website.</p>
<p>As such, anywinnings provided to you in relation to this game on these dates, were confiscated in line with out terms of service.</p>
<p>The following is stated in our General Terms, which are available at: https://www.pokerstars.eu/tos/</p>
<p>Errors, Malfunctions and Interruptions - when we will void transactions and recover or not pay winnings</p>
<p>Errors, Malfunctions or Interruptions in the Services or Software may or may not be apparent to us or to you at the time, and they may only come to light as and when settlement instructions, Game outcomes, winnings or withdrawal requests are investigated and analysed by us retrospectively. You must not abuse or take advantage of any Error, Malfunction or Interruption which is or becomes apparent to you (for example by exploiting it to obtain winnings). If any Error, Malfunction or Interruption is or becomes apparent to you, or you suspect that it may be occurring to any part of the Services you are using, you must stop using that part of the Services immediately and tell us about it.</p>
<p>If, as a result of an Error, Malfunction or Interruption in the Services, your Account is credited with winnings, funds, rewards and/or other credits that you would not have received were it not for that Error, Malfunction or Interruption ("Erroneous Credits"), we will void the relevant transaction and withhold or recover the Erroneous Credits. This applies even if the relevant part of the Services could have produced the same or similar amount of winnings/funds/rewards/credits absent the Error, Malfunction or Interruption and applies whether or not the Error, Malfunction or Interruption was apparent to you or to us at the time. If you have withdrawn any Erroneous Credits, you must pay them back to us as and when we ask you to."</p>
<p>Thank you for your understanding and for your patience while the review was conducted.</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>
<p>PokerStars Casino</p>
