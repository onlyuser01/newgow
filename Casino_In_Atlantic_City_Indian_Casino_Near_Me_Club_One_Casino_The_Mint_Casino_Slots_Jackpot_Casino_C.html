<p>Caesars Palace, Las Vegas, has announced its multi-million-dollar makeover, which will be completed by New Year’s Eve.</p>
<p>Caesars Palace Will Include a Statue of Augustus Caesar</p>
<p>Caesars Palace, Las Vegas, the Caesars Entertainment property known for its inclusion in the movie “The Hangover” and others, has announced that it will soon begin its multi-million-dollar renovation of its porte-cochere, entrance, lobby bar and table games casino floor. The exact price tag of the renovations hasn’t been revealed.</p>
<p>In May, the casino filed all of the paperwork regarding its reconstruction project with PENTA Building Group, its contractor/construction group, which will oversee the makeover of the casino, expected to be completed just before New Year’s Eve this year. During the renovation, rideshare pick-up and drop-off would be at the exit doors next to Vanderpump Cocktail Garden.</p>
<p>The construction, which is set to get underway this month, will include new pedestrian tunnels, bringing guests safely into the resort. The existing statue of three goddesses, placed in the lobby of Caesars Palace, would be replaced by a 15-foot tall statue of Augustus Caesar.</p>
<p>The resort plans to build two state-of-the-art gaming areas and remove its circular table games section. In 2014, Caesars reconstructed the lobby bar, located a few steps from the check-in desk, and replaced it with a 24-hour Galleria Bar. Caesars’ lobby bar could become a hallmark feature again, as it used to have a floor-to-ceiling wall sign “every great hotel deserves an exceptional lobby bar.” The casino hasn’t revealed more details regarding its new lounge.</p>
<p>Caesars Entertainment Building a New Casino in Nebraska</p>
<p>Caesars Entertainment is recovering quickly from the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to the massive upgrades being made to Caesars Palace, it has also recently announced it will build a Harrah’s Casino and Racetrack in Nebraska. The casino giant inked a partnership deal with Columbus Exposition and Racing (CER), a horse racing operator, to develop the new project.</p>
<p>The casino would cost around $75 million and would be located near Highway 81, Columbus, Nebraska. The casino would feature a one-mile horse racing track, a sportsbook, and a 40,000 square-foot casino, which will feature more than 20 table games and 400 slots. The venue would include a restaurant and a retail space. The project is expected to be complete at the end of next year.</p>
<p>With this project, Caesars Entertainment also aims to show its commitment to the horse racing industry. Caesars’ CEO, Tom Reeg, stated that Harrah’s would be “a perfect fit” for the state, as its residents voted for gaming at racetracks. He also mentioned the company’s extensive experience in horse racing and its dedication to the casino industry. He shared that the company is looking forward to creating this experience for people in Columbus, Nebraska.</p>
