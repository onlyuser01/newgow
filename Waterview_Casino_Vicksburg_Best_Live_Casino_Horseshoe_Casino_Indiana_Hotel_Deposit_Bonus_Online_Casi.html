<p>The NBA Finals are moving to Massachusetts after two games in California. The series is tied 1-1, with the Boston Celtics favored to take a lead this Wednesday. The main reason for this is that this team is fabulous when playing at TD Garden in Boston. They will have their fans to cheer them on in Game 3, but there’s one thing that needs to worry them – the Golden State Warriors obliterated them in the previous game.</p>
<p>Played on Sunday evening, the game saw the Warriors win 107-88. It was their biggest win over the Celtics since 2014. Thanks to the impressive victory, Steph Curry &amp; Co. are probably feeling very good about their chances in Game 3. Are they right to feel that way? That’s what we’ll discuss in our preview of Golden State Warriors vs Boston Celtics Game 3.</p>

<p>Golden State Warriors Boosted by Their Performance on the Weekend</p>
<p>After a surprising loss in Game 1, the Warriors made it 1-1 in the NBA Finals with a win on Sunday. They absolutely destroyed the Celtics, doing great both in the offense and defense. Sure, we’re used to them doing great in the offense. After all, they got Steph Curry on the roster, the man who scored 20+ points in 15 of his previous 17 matches.</p>
<p>What is kind of surprising is that the Warriors were able to keep the Celtics to just 88 points. They were marvelous in the defense, putting on one of the best defensive performances of the season. In fact, they conceded fewer points just in one game in 2022.</p>
<p>Boston Celtics Tend to Do Great at Home</p>
<p>With a 28-13 record at TD Garden, the Boston Celtics were one of the best home teams in the regular season. In the playoffs, they haven’t been as impressive on their turf. In fact, since the start of the postseason, we saw them lose four games in Boston. The most recent of those was the loss to the Miami Heat on May 27.</p>
<p>This Wednesday, oddsmakers think they’re going to win. It’s not just about the fact that they play at home; it’s also because some of their key men have been superb in the NBA Finals. Jayson Tatum was their best scorer in the previous game with 28 points, as well as six rebounds and three assists.</p>
<p>Jaylen Brown was also very great, scoring 17 points while making the same number of rebounds and assists as Tatum.</p>
<p>Golden State Warriors vs Boston Celtics Game 3 Prediction</p>
<p>Online sportsbooks see the Boston Celtics as the favorites in Game 3. However, judging by what we saw in the previous game, we think the Golden State Warriors mustn’t be underestimated. They definitely have the manpower to make it 2-1 in the NBA Finals.</p>
<p>Picks: Golden State Warriors to win; over to hit</p>
