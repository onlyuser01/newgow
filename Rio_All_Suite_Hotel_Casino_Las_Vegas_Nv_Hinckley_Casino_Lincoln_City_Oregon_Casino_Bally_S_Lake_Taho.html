<p>It‚Äôs time for the second round of the 2023 Gold Cup, and the USMNT is looking for its first win of the tournament</p>
<p>The United States men‚Äôs national team (USMNT) is a -5000 favorite against St. Kitts and Nevis, suggesting that anything but a win for the hosts of the 2023 Gold Cup would be a huge shock. In fact, it seems that the only question ahead of the St. Kitts and Nevis vs. USMNT game is how many goals will Team US score.</p>
<p>These two have never met before, but the American team has already blown out a Caribbean micronation this year. In March, they demolished Grenada 7-1 on the road. Can they do something similar this Wednesday in the US?</p>

<p>Saint Kitts and Nevis Started the Gold Cup Campaign Badly</p>
<p>In the first round of the 2023 Gold Cup, Saint Kitts and Nevis lost to Trinidad &amp; Tobago 3-0, but it could‚Äôve been much worse. The opposition had 14 goal attempts that day while having the ball in their possession for 66% of the time.</p>
<p>St. Kitts and Nevis also had their fair share of goal attempts. They created 10 goal chances, but only one of those was actually headed toward the net. That‚Äôs actually no surprise, considering that this team‚Äôs weakest spot seems to be the offense.</p>
<p>In the current squad of St. Kitts and Nevis, the best scorer is Keithroy Freeman who‚Äôs playing for St. Paul‚Äôs United in the domestic league.</p>
<p>USMNT Looking for a Big Win on Wednesday</p>
<p>The USMNT played 1-1 in the first round of the 2023 Gold Cup. They were the worst of the two and very lucky to win a point in the end. Jamaica dominated the game and even had a chance to score a goal from the penalty, but Leon Bailey missed his chance.</p>

<p>The USMNT scored the equalizer in the 88th minute of the game when FC Cincinnati‚Äôs striker Brandon Vazquez found the net. He came in as a substitute in the 82nd minute, which was the time when the Americans went all-in on the offense.</p>
<p>They‚Äôll have to play offensively on Wednesday as well if they want to record their first win of the 2023 Gold Cup. The trouble is that their best forwards ‚Äì Christian Pulisic, Timothy Weah, Florian Balogun, etc. ‚Äì aren‚Äôt in the Gold Cup squad.</p>
<p>Saint Kitts and Nevis vs. USMNT Prediction</p>
<p>The USMNT have a decent defense, meaning that they probably won‚Äôt concede a goal on Wednesday. When it comes to their offense, we‚Äôre 100% certain they‚Äôre going to find the net against St. Kitts and Nevis. However, we doubt they‚Äôre going to score too many goals. Bookies have set the margin to 5.5 goals, and we think ‚Äúunder‚Äù will hit.</p>
<p>Pick: USMNT to win &amp; under 5.5 goals</p>
