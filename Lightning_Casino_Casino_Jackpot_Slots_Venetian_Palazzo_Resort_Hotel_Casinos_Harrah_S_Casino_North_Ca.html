<p>Esports, sports, and media company Rivalry Corp. has received responsible gambling accreditation from the Responsible Gambling Council in Canada. The RG Check Accreditation is granted to companies that can prove that they operate in a way that promotes safe and responsible gambling practices and that is aligned with market expectations and focused exclusively on consumer protection.</p>
<p>Rivalry Corp. Receives Important RG Check Accreditation</p>
<p>Commenting on this distinction, Rivalry CEO and co-founder Steven Salz welcomed the news and said that it was an important milestone for the company and a testament to its long-term success in the industry.</p>
<p>Receiving our RG Check Accreditation is important for us as it signals to our customers, the gambling industry, and the gaming and esports community more broadly, our continued dedication to creating a safe environment for customers to play in. Rivalry CEO and co-founder Steven Salz</p>
<p>According to Salz, the RG Check is the golden standard against which all companies should be measured when it comes to protecting consumers and players. He added that maintaining a high standard of consumer protection also bestowed a particular competitive advantage on the company as it made it capable of advancing its business in new regions and expanding its reach.</p>
<p>Further, Salz explained that Rivalry uses innovative RG tools that make it simple for consumers to seek help if they ever need to. RG Check Accreditation Program is now an official requirement for any company that seeks to break ground in the market in Ontario, which is moving quickly forward and expanding its reach. Players who are new to the market have to maintain very high standards of player and consumer protection.</p>
<p>Rivalry Goes Above and Beyond to Protect Consumers</p>
<p>This also comes at a time when unregulated operators have a very short window to leave the market, with the deadline set by October 31. Commenting on the accreditation, RGC CEO Shelley White said that Rivalry has been able to successfully complete its accreditation, which covers the esports gambling products offered by the company. White added:</p>
<p>This achievement is a clear demonstration of Rivalry’s commitment to player protection throughout its operations. RG Check is an invaluable tool for managing risk and monitoring the overall effectiveness of RG programming and RGC is proud to provide ongoing support to Rivalry’s harm minimization efforts.</p>
<p>Rivalry has been one of the fastest-growing esports and gambling companies worldwide. Listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange, the company started originally as an esports betting platform but rapidly translated that success into other verticals. Today, Rivalry offers sports betting and iCasino product on top of its massive esports platform.</p>
