<p>Leading gambling technology supplier Playtech announced today it entered into a new partnership deal with online betting and gaming operator 888, to deploy a range of its innovative Live Casino and random number generator (RGN) games on 888casino platform.</p>
<p>Strengthen 888’s Leadership Role</p>
<p>For the Gibraltar-based 888 gaming group, the new partnership is expected to boost its product offering in online casino and further strengthen its market leader position in iGaming.</p>
<p>“At 888, we are constantly looking for partnerships that strengthen our product offering and I believe Playtech’s Live Casino and RNG content will do exactly that.” Guy Cohen, SVP, Head of B2C, 888</p>
<p>As part of the partnership deal, Playtech’s Live Casino in Riga, Latvia, will host an 888 branded studio, featuring a number of highly popular live casino games and content from the technology company, including Live Slots, Spin a Win and Adventures Beyond Wonderland titles.</p>
<p>“The new games will expand upon our existing suite of games to provide new, exciting, and engaging gaming experiences within a safe and secure environment. I look forward to welcoming Playtech’s content onto 888casino and growing our partnership together.” Guy Cohen, SVP, Head of B2C, 888</p>
<p>Entertainment-Led Experience</p>
<p>Edo Haitin, chief executive officer at Playtech noted that the significant investment made by 888 and the commitment shown to the Live Casino vertical signified the importance of having the ability to offer to modern players “an entertainment-led experience.</p>
<p>“Our partnership comes at a time when we are launching more new games and variants than ever. We’re delighted to be working with a market leader like 888 to deliver an exciting, innovative Live and RNG offering for their players.” Edo Haitin, CEO, Live Casino, Playtech</p>
<p>Playtech’s commercial director Yori Arami added that agreement for RNG content will ensure 888 have access to most of the newly developed online casino games by Playtech, including branded titles such as the Sporting Legends Suite and the one launched recently, Rubik’s® Cube, packed with some of the most popular progressive jackpots in the industry.</p>
<p>“We look forward to continuing the successful partnership across many markets over the coming years.” Yori Arami, Commercial Director, Playtech</p>
<p>For Playtech, the new partnership deal will also distract media focus away from the upcoming shareholder revolt due to the governance failure of the board at the FTSE250 technology group to appoint a high-profile chairman, following the departure of Alan Jackson.</p>
