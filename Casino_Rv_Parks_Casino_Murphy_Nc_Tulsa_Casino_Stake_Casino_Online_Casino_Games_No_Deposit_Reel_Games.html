<p>Reel Games will be responsible for Merkur Games products manufacturing and development in Central America and the Caribbean</p>
<p>Merkur Gaming, the international sales and development arm of Merkur GmbH, announced it has agreed upon a sales partnership with Reel Games, Inc. effective January 1, 2023.</p>
<p>Marketing and After-Sales</p>
<p>The partnership reached with the Florida-based manufacturer and distributor of reel and video slot machines, multi-player roulette terminals, progressive jackpot systems, slot tournaments, and table games will see Reel Games assume responsibility for Merkur Gaming’s marketing and after-sales service in Central America and the Caribbean region.</p>
<p>Commenting on the new sales partnership, Tomás Mieles, business development manager, Casino Spain, and coordinator, Sales LATAM, at Merkur Gaming, noted that by reaching the agreement with Reel Games, Merkur Gaming has “gained a strong and reliable partner” and whose expertise will be key to expanding the company’s presence in the Central American and the Caribbean regions.</p>
<p>“While we are already very successful in this region, we expect the collaboration with Reel Games to further significantly increase demand for our products,” Mieles outlined.</p>
<p>As a leading distributor of slot machines, roulette terminals and progressive jackpot systems in the US for several decades, Reel Games will leverage its expertise to manufacture and distribute Merkur Gaming products in Central America and the Caribbean under the collaboration.</p>
<p>Anticipating a Successful Collaboration</p>
<p>Sean Smith, president and founder of Reel Games, also commented on the agreement, appreciating the trust placed in Reel Games by Merkur Gaming and looking forward to establishing “a close and successful collaboration with its European partner.</p>
<p>“We are proud to be offered the opportunity to further strengthen and expand Merkur Gaming’s diverse offering in Central America,” Smith added.</p>
<p>With service offices and sales teams in Mississippi, New Jersey, Oklahoma, and the Caribbean territories, Reel Games is licensed to distribute gaming machines and equipment in over fifty US jurisdictions, and also serves as the main supplier for major cruise lines.</p>
<p>Part of the German-based Gauselmann Group, Merkur Gaming is responsible for the development, production and sales of games and amusement and gaming machines, as well as adapting the company’s products to the specific requirements of the particular gaming jurisdiction and the gaming preferences of the local players.</p>
<p>The group’s land-based division, Merkur Slots, has been particularly active in the UK last year, having opened adult gaming centers across the country as part of its nationwide £10 million ($12 million) investment plan. Gaming venues appeared in Aberdeen, Blackpool, Crawley, Kidderminster, Rayners Lane, Taunton, Sunderland, Stockton-on-Tees, Streatham, Dover, Brierly Hill, Bradford, and the latest in Spalding.</p>
<p>Merkur Group UK ended the year by donating £12,000 ($14,400) to three charities – Action for Children, FareShare and Willen Hospice – to confirm the operator’s commitment to supporting good causes.</p>
