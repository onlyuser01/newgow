<p>Former heavyweight boxing champion David Haye becomes a permanent addition to Team Grosvenor Poker.</p>
<p>David Haye Joins Team Grosvenor Poker to Take on More Challenges</p>
<p>Retired heavyweight boxer David Haye will support Grosvenor‚Äôs efforts to recover from the post-COVID-19 depression. The casino and Mr. Haye first inked a partnership back in 2018 when he took up on the challenge of learning poker and participate at the 2019 Goliath event.</p>
<p>Mr. Haye did well, entering a contested field of 9,300 entries, and came out as the 40th best player in the event. Not bad for someone who spent a year learning the game, although quickly developed an appetite for it.</p>
<p>How Mr. Hayes Went from Heavyweight Boxer to Poker Player</p>
<p>Grosvenor was happy to bank on his new-found flair for poker and has just signed him in as part of a sponsorship deal. The deal is live, three months after the whimsically called ‚ÄúDavid vs. Goliath‚Äù documentary, which is a word play on the names of both Mr. Haye and Grosvenor‚Äôs flagship tournament.</p>
<p>IT'S OFFICIAL! I'm going back in the ring as @GrosvenorCasino's NEW sponsored poker player ü•äüÉè</p>
<p>If you think you have what it takes to knock me out, join me for the #HayemakerBounty tournament TOMORROW at 8PM where you can win some incredible prizes. Full details below üëáüèæ ‚Äî David Haye (@mrdavidhaye) July 13, 2020</p>
<p>Meanwhile, David vs. Goliath is already available on Amazon Primer for anyone interested in following Mr. Haye‚Äôs story from rags to a decent poker player with a zeal to learn at an exponential pace.</p>
<p>Grosvenor has probably never expected to see Mr. Hayes so enthused about the event, but thanks to his natural interest in the game, and somewhat of a talent, he is now a permanent member of Team Grosvenor Poker.</p>
<p>Commemorating the partnership, Grosvenor has launched the Hayemaker Bounty Tournaments, another play of words and an allusion to Mr. Haye‚Äôs career as a pugilist. Players may begin joining the Hayemaker Bounties as early as tomorrow, Tuesday, July 14.</p>
<p>In the MTTs, players may find themselves facing none other than Mr. Haye himself. Once live poker returns to the United Kingdom, however, Mr. Haye will head out for the GUKPT events to face off with other worthwhile contenders.</p>
<p>Grosvenor Looks to Recover from Covid-19 Doldrums</p>
<p>After a moribund few month, Grosvenor is looking to pick the action up a notch. Many competitors signed up distinct partnerships in the past, including with Cristiano Ronaldo and another boxer, Carl Froch, in a bid to boost awareness and send a clear signal that the cardrooms are open for business.</p>
<p>However, the Grosvenor‚Äôs parent company, the Rank Group, has not yet been able to restart operations in the United Kingdom specifically. Mr. Haye‚Äôs visibility should help offset some of the economic downturns while Grosvenor‚Äôs bids its time in the poker ring.</p>
