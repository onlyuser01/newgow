    <h1>Hard Rock Casino Events 50 No Deposit Bonus Casino Extreme Treasure Island Casino Hotel Atlantic Cit</h1>

<p>Online casino operator PressEnter Group, formerly Betpoint Group, has introduced its Ultra Casino in Peru and Chile. This marks the company's debut on the Latin American market.</p>
<p>Ultra Casino boasts a sleek and fashionable design, seamless UX, and innovative gamification that provides a unique player experience. Ultra Charge is a loyalty program that offers daily rewards and individual rewards.</p>
<p>Focused on technology and design, Ultra Casino uses very new mechanics and search engines, which help users find what they like. The system creates affinity patterns through an interface that is inspired by Netflix.</p>
<p>Not only can players access thousands of live slots, table games and dealer titles from all major providers, but they can also deposit and withdraw money safely and quickly, as PressEnter Group collaborates with the most important banking institutions in Peru and Chile, as well as all other e-wallets.</p>
<p>In announcing the launch, David Plumi, PressEnter Group's Regional Managing Director for Spain &amp; LatAm, said, "Entering the LatAm market by launching Ultra Casino in Peru and Chile is a milestone moment for PressEnter Group and marks the start of a long and successful presence in the region."</p>
<p>He explained that Ultra Casino offers a "supercharged" player experience that offers a wideselection of games, the most payment options and an innovative rewards system that delivers customized bonuses every day.</p>
<p>Plumi added, "We believe players in Peru and Chile will not have experienced anything like Ultra Casino before, and we are here to not only meet but exceed their needs. Of course, once we are up and running in Peru and Chile, we plan to launch into additional LatAm markets."</p>
<p>PressEnter Group stated that it plans to expand in Latin America in the coming year through the launch of Ultra Casino in other countries.</p>
<p>PressEnter named Plumi, an ex-Betsson executive, its new Regional Manager for Spain and Latin America earlier this year to launch the online casino operator.</p>
<p>Peru and Chile both are in the process of reinvigorating their gaming industries. Peru has a new set of laws on the table for the iGaming space, and Chile is also advancing its online gaming regulations.</p>
