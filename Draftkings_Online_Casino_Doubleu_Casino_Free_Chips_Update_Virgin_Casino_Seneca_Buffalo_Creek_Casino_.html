    <h1>Draftkings Online Casino Doubleu Casino Free Chips Update Virgin Casino Seneca Buffalo Creek Casino</h1>

<p>PART 1:</p>
<p>Good morning ,</p>
<p>this is a really delicate situation. I have felt hostage to this day and still am, as my last withdrawal will only be possible on Wednesday 22.04.2020.</p>
<p>Attached are the emails confirming my winnings, but now I make a brief summary of everything.</p>
<p>On my gaming account, following a big win I came to have around 75,000 euros. From there the collapse began.</p>
<p>On the day of 09.03.2020 I receive a first email from a VIP manager, in which I congratulated me on my big win on the casino in question.</p>
<p>My answer was to be able to withdraw my funds and to continue playing later (11.03.2020).</p>
<p>On 12.03.2020 I am denied the possibility of withdrawing as per their terms and conditions and therefore I decide to set the limits per game, so that I can have my balance safe and be able to withdraw it, albeit with very long waiting times long (limits are attached to this complaint).</p>
<p>Magically on 16.03.2020, although I have active limits, I am contacted by the VIP manager, who proposes to increase my withdrawals, going from € 2,500.00 to € 5,000.00 per week. Initially I refuse, and I continue to maintain my balance, but then with their constant insistence I decide to remove the limits, mostly to try to withdraw more funds. (IMPORTANT: THE LIMITS CAN BE REMOVED ARE AFTER 7 DAYS FROM MY REQUEST. THEY CAN REMOVE THEM THE DAY AFTER).</p>
<p>From there I lose everything and arrive to have about 20'000.00 euros on the ocnto. I try again to ask to be able to withdraw them all after showing the amount played and from there I start to notice their non-answers towards me and systematically, by cutting short the conversations simply refer to the limits in the conditions, without ever even referring to the increase of the same, as done previously based on the volume of play made.</p>
<p>PART 2:</p>
<p>My wife finds this casino and decides to open an account. Enter your data as residence etc. Play 1,500.00 euros, as per attachment. Use my credit card, already connected to an account. I realize this, I communicate to the casino to make a refund on the part she played, also because the casino in its terms says not to accept multiple accounts in a family and that they are blocked instantly before they can make the deposit .</p>
<p>Moral: I ask for the return of the amount of 1,500.00 euros played by Miriam, with my credit card, and compensation, relating to my account (part 1), to be discussed with the casino in question, as it violates the relative conditions to protect players.</p>
