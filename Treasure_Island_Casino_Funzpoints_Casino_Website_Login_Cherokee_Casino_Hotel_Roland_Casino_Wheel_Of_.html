    <h1>Treasure Island Casino Funzpoints Casino Website Login Cherokee Casino Hotel Roland Casino Wheel Of</h1>

<p>As of 04/21/2023 I have redeemed the coupon "LENNON". The minimum deposit for this no-rules bonus was $99.The amount I deposited in Bitcoin was $102.00. Upon completing my play and deducting the bonus, which amounts to approximately $350, I ended up with $1299.78 and requested a bitcoin withdrawal. The last two times I have requested a bitcoin withdrawal from Slots of Vegas, I was able to receive my winnings within 24 hours. After 48 hours, I contacted customer service via chat to inquire about my withdrawal request as it had not even been processed. It was informed to me that coindraw's timeframe is based on an algorithm that assesses customer activity and that my withdrawal would be processed within 3-7 days and every agent I have followed up with since then has told me this except for today. The agent I chatted with said withdrawal requests are reviewed on a case-by-case basis. In most cases, this process takes approximately seven business days, and that is if you have been verified and your payment method details have been approved. Upon approval, funding takes seven to ten business days. Once the funds have been sent, the time it takes for them to be received will be determined by the method used. Although it is recommended that I wait 14 days to submit a complaint, they have not even begun the withdrawal process despite everything being in order as this will be my third withdrawal. It is a common theme with Slots of Vegas that the first two withdrawals are received within 24 hours, and any withdrawals made after that suffer from extended delays for a variety of reasons. Let me leave it at that. Any help in this matter is greatly appreciated.</p>
