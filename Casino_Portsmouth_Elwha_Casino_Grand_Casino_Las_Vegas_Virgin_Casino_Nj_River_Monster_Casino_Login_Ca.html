<p>The gambling regulator in Massachusetts, the Massachusetts Gaming Commission (MGC), released the latest results outlining the gross gaming revenue (GGR) for the state’s three casinos in July.</p>
<p>Encore, MGM and Plainridge Hit $99 Million in GGR Last Month</p>
<p>July was a good month for Plainridge Park Casino, Encore Boston Harbor, and MGM Springfield, which cumulatively reported $98.7 million in GGR. A breakdown provided by the MGC reveals that Encore Boston Harbor had the highest GGR in July. In total, the property’s GGR hit $64.7 million. From that total, $35.1 million were reported from Encore’s slots operations, while table games contributed $29.7 million. When compared to the $59 million in GGR reported for the same period in 2021, an increase of nearly 10% is observed.</p>
<p>MGM Springfield reported the second-highest GGR, according to the gambling regulator in the state. The operator’s total GGR in July hit $21.5 million, of which $4.2 million came from table games, while slots contributed with $17.3 million. While GGR increased for Encore Boston Harbor on a year-over-year basis, this was not the case for MGM Springfield. Last year in July, the property reported $23.7 million in GGR. In other words, the result this year marked a decrease of 9.2%.</p>
<p>Last but not least, in July, Plainridge Park casino reported $12.5 million in GGR. When compared to the $13 million reported for the same period a year earlier, a slight decrease of nearly 4% is observed.</p>
<p>The Casinos Continue to Boost the State’s Coffers with Taxes</p>
<p>Overall, the three casinos in Massachusetts contributed $27.7 million in taxes to the state’s coffers last month. It’s important to mention that both MGM Springfield and Encore Boston harbor are subject to 25% tax. On the other hand, slots-only Plainridge Park Casino is subject to 49% in state tax.</p>
<p>Not unexpectedly, Encore Boston Harbor contributed the most with taxes last month. In July, the venue paid a total of $16.2 million in taxes, which is more than what MGM Springfield and Plainridge Park Casino paid cumulatively. The MGC revealed that Plainridge Park Casino was responsible for $6.1 million in taxes last month, while MGM Springfield paid $5.4 million.</p>
<p>Focusing on the bigger picture, since each of the casinos opened their doors, they contributed $1.2 billion in gambling tax. From that total, Plainridge Park Casino contributed $507.7 million since it opened its doors, while Encore Boston Harbor paid $425 million in taxes. MGM Springfield also boosted the state’s coffers by contributing $222.1 million in taxes since it opened back in August 2018.</p>
