<p>Hop N Pop review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>This slot has a wholesome fruit machine theme.</p>
<p>Players will arrive at a cosy farm and discover a set of reels filled with colourful fruits. Under a blue sky, they’ll harvest as many of the treats as they can.</p>
<p>This game provides a rural twist on the classic fruit machine aesthetic. It’s a good pick for players who enjoy fruit machines, but want a little taste of novelty as well.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The soundtrack is a chilled out beat of shaking maracas. As the reels spin, there is a click and a rather silly boinging sound. This may make some players feel as though they are playing a childhood game, though others may not love the juvenile sound.</p>
<p>The reel is filled with cartoon fruit and veggie symbols. Players will find classic fruit machine items such as cherries and grapes, but also some unexpected newcomers like carrots and eggplants. This variety of produce adds to the farming aesthetic.</p>
<p>Each fruit and veggie is animated with bright colours and glossy highlights. This makes them look especially appealing and helps keep the game engaging.</p>
<p>The setting is an idyllic farm with green grass, a blue sky and a wooden barn. It’s not hard to imagine that this is harvest season and the reels represent a plentiful field.</p>
<p>Overall, the graphics and music create a playful world that brings to mind a youthful videogame.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Hop N Pop is a seven reel, seven row slot.</p>
<p>Wins are awarded when players land at least five symbols connected anywhere on the reels. In total, this creates 12,500 possible ways to win.</p>
<p>The Cascade feature means that symbols that are part of winning combinations will vanish so that fresh symbols may take their place. Cascades will continue until there are no more winning combinations of symbols.</p>
<p>Players have the option to buy into the slot’s special features by clicking the Buy Bonus button.</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Free Spin symbol.</p>
<p>As the game begins, players will have a multiplier overlain in a randomised position on the reels. For every new spin, this multiplier will jump into a new place on the reels.</p>
<p>Whenever the multiplier overlaps with a cluster of winning symbols, the multiplier is doubled or broken into two parts. The multiplier will also be applied to the player’s win. Any new multipliers created will jump to randomised positions on the reels.</p>
<p>When players land more than one multiplier on a winning combination, the multipliers will be added together before being applied to the win. Multipliers have a total value of up to x64.</p>
<p>If the multiplier hits a winning combination of symbols, all the symbols of that kind will vanish from the reels.</p>
<p>Orange sun symbols will double the value of multipliers, while Green sun symbols will break multipliers into separate multipliers.</p>
<p>The Free Spins feature will be triggered when players land at least 3 Free Spin symbols, starting with 10 free spins. Players will also receive one multiplier of x2, but if they landed 4 Free Spins symbols, this will increase to two multipliers of x2. If players landed 5 Free Spins symbols, they will receive four multipliers of x4.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.2%, just above our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.20 up to a maximum of $/£/€100 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is high, which makes it a good match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We recommend this high RTP, high volatility farming and fruit-themed slot.</p>
<p>The slightly above average RTP and ample volatility alone make this game a great choice.</p>
