<p>Everything Going in Real Madrid’s Favor</p>
<p>Los Blancos are undefeated at home in all competitions since April last year. Their most recent game at Estadio Santiago Bernabeu saw them draw 1-1 with Atletico Madrid. It was a game in which they were the dominant force. The reason why they didn’t win is that they probably needed a rest after pulling off a major comeback just a few days earlier.</p>
<p>What we’re talking about is Real Madrid’s performance in the Champions League game with Liverpool, which they won 5-2 after going 2-0 down.</p>
<p>Their form is good and the mood in the locker room is superb. Los Blancos look satisfied with their life under coach Ancelotti, who’s turned them into real world-beaters. These guys have a chance to win three trophies this season – the Champions League, Spanish La Liga, and the Copa Del Rey.</p>
<p>Barca to Miss Several Key Men</p>
<p>Last Sunday, Barcelona suffered a shocking 1-0 loss to Almeria in La Liga. Three days earlier, they lost to Manchester United 2-1 in the UEFA Europa League, which meant the end of their continental journey. They still have a nice lead in La Liga with seven points more than second-placed Real Madrid. Still, the season is long and anything can happen in the next couple of months.</p>
<p>When it comes to the Copa Del Rey, Barca’s chance of advancing to the next stage looks slim. This goes especially if they get hammered by Real Madrid in the first game of the doubleheader. Unfortunately for the boys from Catalonia, such a scenario seems very likely.</p>
<p>Robert Lewandowski will miss Thursday’s Copa del Rey Clásico first leg with a hamstring problem—he’s expected to miss around two weeks, per multiple reports pic.twitter.com/6XEUzygNFJ — B/R Football (@brfootball) February 27, 2023</p>
<p>The thing is that apart from not being in great form, Barca have many other worries. One of those is the absence of their scoring leader Robert Lewandowski.</p>
<p>In addition to the Polish scoring machine, coach Xavi also won’t be able to count on several other crucial players – Ousmane Dembele, Ansu Fati, and Pedri.</p>
<p>Real Madrid vs Barcelona Prediction</p>
<p>We’re almost 100% confident Real Madrid will win El Clasico on Thursday. Everything seems to be going in their favor at this point and they need to take advantage of that.</p>
