<p>Dazn, a global over-the-top sports subscription video streaming service, has inked a partnership deal with the famous heavyweight boxer and two-time champion Anthony Joshua. The agreement will allow Dazn to stream Joshua’s matches. It will also see him work with the company and provide it with valuable advice.</p>
<p>Joshua Joined Dazn</p>
<p>As per the agreement, Joshua will allow Dazn to stream all of his future boxing games on its platform. In addition, Joshua will join Dazn as a shareholder, a brand ambassador and a special advisor.</p>
<p>As a brand ambassador, Joshua will promote Dazn’s brand and will work to popularize its content. As an advisor, Joshua will join the company’s strategic advisory board. He will use his expertise with boxing to help Dazn improve its offering and appeal to fans of the sport. By extension, Joshua will help Dazn to expand in Britain, its home market.</p>
<p>This is not the first time Joshua has joined forces with Dazn. The heavyweight boxer has previously worked with the sports company and is familiar with its team and its offerings. Because of this, he readily signed a long-term commitment to Dazn and is happy to continue working with the brand.</p>
<p>Dazn Welcomed Joshua and the Crowds He Attracts</p>
<p>Joshua himself addressed the partnership deal. He pointed out that he has worked with Dazn in the US for years and has come to understand and respect the broadcaster’s passion and drive.</p>
<p>Joshua noted that he had been very busy recently as he was opening a new chapter in his career. This means that he had to change his training environment, work with new coaches and also work with a new broadcaster. With all that into consideration, Joshua is happy to have finally wrapped up the negotiations. He will now fully dedicate his time to achieving new victories on the ring, much to the delight of fans and Dazn.</p>
<p>“Negotiations at this level take time so I am pleased to have it all wrapped up and now I can fully focus on giving the fans and Dazn what they want, knockouts in the glamour division.”</p>
<p>Shay Segev, the chief executive officer of Dazn Group, is happy to deepen his company’s relationship with the heavyweight champion. He is sure that this will help Dazn grow even further. The CEO lauded Joshua for the “vast audiences he attracts” and said he is delighted to have him on board.</p>
<p>On a final note, Segev said that Joshua’s willingness to join forces and invest in Dazn attests to the success of the broadcaster’s business.</p>
