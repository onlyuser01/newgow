    <h1>Lucky North Casino Lake Las Vegas Casino River Wind Casino Harlows Casino Casinos In Vicksburg Missi</h1>

<p>Dear representative from Parimatch Casino. Please note that I owe nothing to you and your support team for such requests. It is you who are obliged to fulfill my requirement to close the game account at the same moment when I indicate to you the reason for the closure, namely the game addiction.</p>
<p>and as proof of my words, I refer to the game liability policy, which also fully applies to projects under the Curacao license. And you, as an operator, are simply obliged to follow this policy. If you do not, then you are violating the terms of the license. So this is what it is about:</p>
<p>"Actions on receipt of requests from players"</p>
<p>"When a user contacts the casino team through any available method and requests to close his account / set any limits, the casino team is obliged to find out the reasons for making this request. If the reason for such an appeal is gambling addiction, then such a request should be processed immediately, after Initial mention When a player's request is fulfilled, the casino team is obliged to leave a comment (for example, "gambling addiction") in the player's profile.</p>
<p>If the reason for such a request is not specified in detail or does not relate to problems with gambling addiction and the casino does not have solid reasons / solid evidence to be sure that the player has problems with gambling addiction, then the following options are possible:</p>
<p>1) The casino team can fulfill the user's request.</p>
<p>2) The casino team may offer the user a bonus / promotion to prevent their account being closed.</p>
<p>3) The casino team may ask the player to contact them using email to fulfill such a request "</p>
<p>Please note that perhaps this is not a literal wording, but the meaning of all the rules is conveyed absolutely to everyone who is familiar with them. I also ask you to draw the attention of the Casino Guru manager that I have repeatedly written to the support mail of Parimatch casino, using my personal mail, and provided my passport, although this is not even a prerequisite, according to the terms of the gaming liability policy. In any case, I gave the support team of this casino more than enough information to immediately close my account. They violated the terms of the license by not closing my account immediately after giving the reason for gambling addiction. I will also have to go directly to the person who issued them the license to report the violation and get compensation, as I have suffered from these violations. If I can't solve this issue with the help of Casino Guru, then I will have no choice but to seek help from representatives from Curacao.</p>
