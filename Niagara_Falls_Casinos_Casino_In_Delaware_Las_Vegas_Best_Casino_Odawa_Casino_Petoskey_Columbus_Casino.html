<p>Mr Green is meant to become the center around which 888 Holdings will gradually build its presence on the German market</p>
<p>Online gaming group 888 Holdings, the parent behind 888, William Hill, SI Sportsbook and Mr Green brands, announced today the launch of Mr Green in Germany.</p>
<p>Building German Presence</p>
<p>The launch of Mr Green in Germany represents the first time when the online gaming brand is available to play on the 888 proprietary technology platform following the acquisition of William Hill by the Gibraltar-based gaming group in July last year.</p>
<p>Commenting on the launch of Mr Green in Germany, Amit Berkovich, vice president of poker and managing director, ROW, outlined the important role the online gaming brand is expected to play for the wider group in the country.</p>
<p>Mr Green will be the Group’s spearhead brand in the German market, alongside our 888 brands,” Berkovich said, hailing the launch of the brand as “a great example of what focus, collaboration, and dedication can deliver. Amit Berkovich, VP of poker &amp; MD ROW, 888</p>
<p>“We’ve been live since late March, thanks to the existing 888 platform in Germany and the powerful collaboration of all teams across the business who have enabled a totally new set-up in record time,” he added.</p>
<p>The gaming group sees Germany as one of the markets offering strategic growth opportunities and is planning to build a strong presence in the country by enticing local players with a customer-focused approach and best-in-class products and brands.</p>
<p>We are excited to introduce thousands more players in the market to our enhanced offer, and look forward to bringing other Mr Green markets onto our single technology platform in the coming months. Amit Berkovich, VP of poker &amp; MD ROW, 888</p>
<p>Following the acquisition of a gaming license in early 2023, 888 Holdings moved quickly to launch its Mr Green brand, leveraging the group’s in-house proprietary technology platform and the strong existing brand awareness across European gaming jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Mr Green’s Regulatory Woes</p>
<p>It was not all smooth sailing for Mr Green in European regulatory waters, though, after the brand faced some headwinds in the Netherlands, where the Kansspelautoriteit (KSA) sanctioned it in 2018 for taking bets from Ditch citizens without a license in 2017, and last year Mr Green lost the legal battle.</p>
<p>Another market where Mr Green faced significant challenges was the UK and in August last year, the brand announced the end of Mr Green Sportsbook in the country, while keeping its sportsbook offering in Ireland operational.</p>
<p>The flagship brand acquired by 888 Holdings from Caesars Entertainment, William Hill, was also subjected to regulatory enforcement actions after being slapped recently with a record £19.2 million ($23.67 million), of which £3.7 million was allocated to Mr Green.</p>
