    <h1>Harrah S Casino Las Vegas Facebook Cashman Casino Davinci S Gold Casino Isle Of Capri Casino Doubled</h1>

<p>While the company plans to go live during the second half of 2023, it is not yet operational despite receiving the license</p>
<p>LeoVegas Group has been granted a gaming license for online operations in the Netherlands. The five-year license encompasses casino games, live casino, and sports betting, allowing the group to establish a strong foothold in the Dutch market.</p>
<p>LeoVegas Group Eager to Capitalize on Dutch Market Potential</p>
<p>The license was issued by the Dutch regulatory authority KSA (Kansspelautoriteit) to LeoVegas Group through its subsidiary, 21 Heads Up Limited. This marks a major milestone for LeoVegas Group as it expands its reach in the rapidly growing Dutch market. The Netherlands has been identified as a region with great potential, and the company is eager to capitalize on the opportunities it presents.</p>
<p>Gustaf Hagman, the CEO of LeoVegas Group, expressed his excitement about the licensing approval, stating: “LeoVegas Group has been granted a gaming license in the rapidly growing Dutch market. We are thrilled to look to the future and fully focus on resuming our Dutch journey: the Netherlands has great potential and we look forward to it becoming an important market in our global growth journey.”</p>
<p>The Dutch market has recently undergone a regulatory overhaul, and LeoVegas Group is eager to comply with the rules and regulations set forth by the Dutch authorities. At the beginning of June, Rene Jansen, Chairman of the KSA, discussed upcoming changes to the regulated gambling market at the annual Gaming conference.</p>
<p>Jansen emphasized the importance of data vault systems (CDBs) for licensed Dutch gambling operators to comply with Anti-Money Laundering regulations. Additionally, Jansen addressed changes to gambling advertising regulations, with a focus on untargeted advertising for land-based offers versus online gambling activities.</p>
<p>LeoVegas Group Makes Strategic Moves in Sweden, Denmark, and Germany</p>
<p>The Netherlands is not the only European country where LeoVegas has been setting its foot. The company also recently expanded its presence in Sweden, Denmark and Germany. In June, LeoVegas Group secured three new Swedish software licenses, enhancing its B2B efforts and expanding its gaming software offerings in the country.</p>
<p>In May, LeoVegas announced the relaunch of the Expekt brand in Denmark as part of its strategic plan for expansion in the global betting vertical. The reintroduction of “nye expekt” aimed to reaffirm LeoVegas’ presence in the Danish market after a ten-year absence. While in March, LeoVegas Group received approval from the GGL to launch its LVSports Limited brand in Germany, allowing the company to offer and market virtual slots across all sixteen German states. The expansion into Germany represents a significant opportunity for LeoVegas as it aims to innovate and reshape the online gambling ecosystem.</p>
