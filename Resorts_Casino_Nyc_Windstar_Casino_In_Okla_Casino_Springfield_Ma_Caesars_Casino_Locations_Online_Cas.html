<p>The new name and logo coincided with the release of an innovative software that is expected to elevate the experience for poker players</p>
<p>Americas Cardroom, the leading online poker site, announced a major change regarding its operations. The poker site confirmed Wednesday that it will now operate under the name ACR Poker, bringing in a brand-new modern logo as well. Additionally, the rebranding coincides with the release of ACR Poker’s innovative software that brings extensive features combined with a modern look and feel.</p>
<p>In light of the recent update, players that upgrade or install ACR Poker will be able to immediately tap into the new features of the platform. Such users will instantly access the new and improved navigation that makes finding games, stakes and tournaments easier than before.</p>
<p>What’s more, ACR Poker users will be able to benefit from plenty of personalization and customization options. Informative features offering a glimpse of important data involving tournaments, final tables streaming, as well as player traffic will also be available.

<p>Improving the Gameplay for Pros and Recreational Players</p>
<p>The latest update provides convenient options not only for seasoned players but for newcomers too. Multiple features improve the gameplay and help protect players from predatory behavior. Thanks to the update, now players can start a single game at a time within a cash group and are not allowed to “sit on waiting lists” and target individuals at specific tables.</p>
<p>ACR Poker’s website has also gone through a redesign, resulting in a more user-friendly experience thanks to a cleaner design. The poker room has also introduced special merchandise via its new and improved store.</p>
