    <h1>Asheville Casino San Diego Casinos And Hotels Nc Casinos La Area Casinos Bovada Casino Online BetMGM</h1>

<p>Internet betting and gaming giant BetMGM reported on Wednesday that it had suffered a data breach. The incident dates back to May this year but was only discovered in November. BetMGM has already undertaken mitigating steps to safeguard customers. The extent of the damage suffered by patrons varies from one account to the next, the company said in a press release.</p>
<p>The information that may have leaked in the breach concerns identifiable and financial data, such as legal names, contact information, both electronic and physical, along with phone information, a hashed version of the affected customers’ Social Security Numbers, and other information related to the account specifically, such as player ID and screen name.</p>
<p>BetMGM has not been able to confirm whether patron passwords or funds have been affected but said that no such information has come to the company’s attention. The appropriate actions have been taken and the operator has already contacted security experts and law enforcement to look into the issue.</p>
<p>In the meantime, BetMGM is taking all the necessary steps to up its security and ensure the incident does not repeat itself. As further mitigation measures, BetMGM has arranged for affected customers to be signed as part of credit monitoring and identity restoration services for the next two years.</p>
<p>The company will cover all expenses related to the monitoring. BetMGM has stressed that it understood the seriousness of the issue at a time when sports betting in the United States is legalized at a breakneck pace and cybercriminals may be looking to exploit repositories that contain thousands of unique customers’ information.</p>
<p>BetMGM CEO Adam Greenblatt reiterated that security is an uppermost priority for the company and added: "We are taking this matter very seriously and are working quickly to investigate it. The security of our platform and our patrons' data is a top priority for BetMGM. We regret any inconvenience this may cause."</p>
<p>The press release has urged consumers to remain vigilant of any suspicious activity concerning their accounts and not hesitate to contact BetMGM or the appropriate authorities. BetMGM also used the official publication to remind patrons that they are entitled to one free credit report annually to ensure that they have not become victims of identity fraud.</p>
<p>In such cases, patrons must contact the appropriate agencies and institutions, and in the case of New Jersey, the Division of Consumer Affairs. BetMGM has also set up a page with a FAQ section that goes over the data breach found at betmgminc.com. This is not the first place a high-profile betting company has been impacted by a similar issue.</p>
<p>Earlier, DraftKings, a fellow betting giant in the United States, said that the login information of some users was compromised. The data of 67,995 users was exposed, Yahoo News said, in what is an increasing frequency of attacks on gambling companies in the United States.</p>
