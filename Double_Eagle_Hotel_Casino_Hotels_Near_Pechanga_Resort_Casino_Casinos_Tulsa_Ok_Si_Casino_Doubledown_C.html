<p>The leading publisher of online gambling games, Yggdrasil, announced the launch of a new space odyssey slot game. The company revealed Tuesday its latest release called Hyper Respins, a new slot game that is the result of a collaboration with ReelPlay, a leading global iGaming content provider.</p>
<p>The new grid game delivers engaging experiences by leveraging the highly popular and innovative cluster mechanic. The space-themed Hyper Respins slot features different gems as symbols, as well as rewarding bonus features that provide thrilling experiences for the customers.

<p>The New Slot Delivers Engaging Features, Bonuses</p>
<p>Yggdrasil and ReelPlay’s new slot game is powered by GATI, a state-of-the-art technology by Yggdrasil that enables pre-configuration. This technology allows the game to be ready for deployment within different jurisdictions, reducing the time this process takes.</p>
<p>David Johnson, ReelPlay’s CEO, shared his excitement about the new game acknowledging that it offers engaging features that help deliver big prizes. “The action flows with every symbol drop and we’ve been careful to pace the action in line with the intergalactic theme,” he said. Johnson explained that the 6×6 grid delivers a familiar feel from the Hypernova games series. Finally, he said that Hypernova Respins is definitely a game that is replayable and fun.</p>
<p>“Hyper Respins offers truly high-octane gameplay thanks to its lucrative Hyper Symbols and Bonus Respins.“ Stuart McCarthy, head of product and programs at Yggdrasil</p>
<p>Stuart McCarthy, Yggdrasil’s head of product and programs, was similarly excited about the launch of the new game. He pointed out that Hyper Respins offers bonus features that make the game more attractive. “We can’t wait for players to explore the depths of space in this thrilling new release,” said McCarthy in conclusion.</p>
<p>The Intergalactic Cluster Pays Slot Brings Zaps and Bombs</p>
<p>To secure a payout within Hyper Respins, players need to land five or more adjacent gems from a single type. Once this happens, the gems explode and the space they free is filled in by new gems that fall into place. This creates engaging gameplay that can also result in big wins.</p>
<p>Moreover, engaging features offered by the slot include different Bombs and Zaps. Bombs that appear on the reel can remove the symbols in a 3×3 radius. On the other hand, Mega Bombs clear the icons within a 5×5 radius. The new slot also offers different types of Zaps. Those Zaps can remove symbols vertically and horizontally. If a player lands a HyperBomb, all tiles pay out at once, explains Yggdrasil.</p>
