<p>Hello. How may I help you?</p>
<p>Christyman2519 03:19</p>
<p>Hello I think I need a manager I finally calmed down enough to discuss this</p>
<p>it took a week</p>
<p>Christyman2519 03:21</p>
<p>i had a withdraw set that I had won from my personal deposit ! After I had the pending withdraw I contacted the representative who told me I could play with 175 chip which I lost almost immediately</p>
<p>I had requested to be paid out 300 because that was 10x my deposit! The withdraw was rejected because I was told I had to win 360 if I wanted to cash out the max amount! So I said fuck it I’ll try!</p>
<p>Christyman2519 03:24</p>
<p>Well I got it up to 360, again this withdraw was created by my personal money! Well some idiot told me last week my withdraw was again rejected and somehow indicated that I hadn’t achieved play through which I had verified I had indeed achieved</p>
<p>I have no idea while I continue to get this horrible treatment!</p>

<p>I’m not a happy camper , last week I blew a gasket!</p>
<p>I just don’t understand how you guys mix things up this bad?</p>
<p>Sofy 03:28</p>
<p>As I have checked with our records, the withdrawal request raised on 23/05/2020 was cancelled as the withdrawal conditions were not meet.</p>
<p>I request you to kindly wait for 5-9 minutes so that I can have deep check on it and get back to you.</p>
<p>Christyman2519 03:30</p>
<p>Right! Did you read why? Because I had 300 because they also took back the 60 bonus I needed to have won 360, instead of just processing it for 240 like normal people</p>
<p>the crazy thing is that I had it over 3k , the guy told me the most I could cash was 300 but failed to tell me I had to stop at 360 if I wanted to withdrawal the max amount</p>
<p>Why wouldn’t someone have reviewed this already knowing how angry I was with the casino?</p>
<p>I do appreciate you don’t get me wrong , it’s not you but geez you finally win then the crazy run around begins</p>
<p>Take your time</p>
