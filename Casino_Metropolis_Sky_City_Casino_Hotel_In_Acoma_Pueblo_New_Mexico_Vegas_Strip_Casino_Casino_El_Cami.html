    <h1>Casino Metropolis Sky City Casino Hotel In Acoma Pueblo New Mexico Vegas Strip Casino Casino El Cami</h1>

<p>Hello. I made a withdrawal from this casino on September 19, they blocked my account when I requested the withdrawal but once I sent everything they activated it and allowed me to make the withdrawal, confirming that my account was 100% validated.</p>
<p>I made the withdrawal to my credit card which never reached the site, after a week I contacted redbet again to see what was happening and they told me that my account was not validated and they returned the 300 usd that I had withdrawn to the account of redbet. So I sent again all the documentation that I had already sent in the beginning, the problem is that now they started asking me for other documentation such as my bank account statement (I never made a deposit from my account) or my skrill profile (I never deposit with skrill), I sent everything anyway. After this, when they no longer had anything new to ask me, they began to tell me that the IBAN code should appear on the account statement of my credit card, which obviously was not there because this code does not appear in any account statement in my country. Therefore, since I do not have a document with this code, I cannot withdraw my money, after verifying my account dozens of times and wasting hours talking to support.</p>
<p>The only thing I ask is that you give me my 300 usd, hopefully by skrill since I can't wait any longer. Thank you</p>
