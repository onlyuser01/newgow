<p>The initiative is the latest addition following the GameSense integration with BetMGM</p>
<p>Sports betting and gaming operator BetMGM announced that its marketing and advertising campaigns will feature responsible gaming messages starting from March 1.</p>
<p>Responsible Gaming Messaging</p>
<p>The brand co-owned by MGM Resorts and Entain will align with the Problem Gambling Awareness Month initiative by introducing responsible gaming messages within its mobile app and across all advertising channels.</p>
<p>“As the legalized sports betting and online gaming industry continues to expand, it is vital that we not only equip players with tools and resources for how to play in a responsible and safe manner but that we also make a significant commitment to showcasing responsible gaming in our advertising,” commented BetMGM’s CEO Adam Greenblatt.</p>
<p>Developed in partnership with GameSense, responsible gaming messages will appear on physical billboards, prints and on-property signage within BetMGM Sportsbooks in the US and Canada, as well as on television, radio and BetMGM’s digital and social platforms.</p>
<p>GameSense’s integration with BetMGM’s digital platforms allows the gaming operator to provide its customers with spending limit tools, information about the basic rules of gambling and access to highly trained GameSense Advisors, essentially guaranteeing the same experience GameSense ensures for them at MGM Resorts properties nationwide.</p>
<p>Moving in the Right Direction</p>
<p>The president and CEO of MGM Resorts, Bill Hornbuckle, and the CEO of Entain, Jette Nygaard-Andersen, also commented on the announcement, highlighting the importance of responsible gaming for both the industry and its consumers.</p>
<p>“With the continued growth of sports betting and iGaming, it’s imperative that our industry remain committed to supporting the best interests of our guests and customers,” said Hornbuckle, commending BetMGM for their commitment to responsible gaming.</p>
<p>“Technology is the key enabler in providing a safety net for our customers [and] building these tools with GameSense into the BetMGM platform is the best way forward,” said Nygaard-Andersen, reiterating Entain’s commitment to providing the safest gambling platforms.</p>
<p>The launch of responsible gaming messaging represents a significant step forward for BetMGM and the gambling industry in the US as it continues to grow but it is just the beginning of a process that requires continuous efforts to progress and evidence to step on, underscoring the essential role of research to tackling problem gambling.</p>
<p>To support research-based evidence and ensure the highest level of protection for players across the country, BetMGM partnered with the International Center for Responsible Gaming (ICRG) in November and provided a $180,000 grant to support the organization’s objective of educating people about the threat posed by problem gambling, the role of gambling advertising and best responsible gaming practices.</p>
