<p>The gambling regulator in the UK released a new update, outlining the progress it has made in improving gambling data collection</p>
<p>Proper collection of data plays an important part in analyzing the gambling sector and determining adult gambling participation as well as problem gambling. The gambling regulator in the UK, the Gambling Commission, has an ongoing goal to improve the methodology for collecting data for the participation of adults in gambling activities across the country.</p>
<p>Continuously striving to improve the way data is collected, the Commission believes that robust data can help improve regulations. At the same time, improving the methodology for collecting gambling data can positively impact changes to the sector, ensuring evidence-driven actions and the protection of the sector, as well as vulnerable individuals.</p>
<p>For three years, the Commission has been seeking ways to improve the way gambling data is collected through a number of public consultations. On Thursday, the regulator’s head of statistics, Helen Bryce, shared details regarding the progress of the Gambling Survey for Great Britain. She highlighted the extensive efforts, including money, people and time, invested in the project that seeks to improve the way gambling data is collected.</p>
<p>The Gambling Survey is one of the Commission’s ongoing goals and it is a part of its priorities for the 2023-2026 period. Ultimately, by improving the Gambling Survey, the regulator seeks to deepen its knowledge and compare results with data provided by operators and improve the regulation of the sector.</p>
<p>“We believe that better evidence, driven by better data will lead to better regulation, which in turn will lead to better outcomes.“ Helen Bryce, head of statistics at the Gambling Commission</p>
<p>New Methodology to Improve Data Collection</p>
<p>Bryce spoke about the incredible progress for the project that was achieved thanks to help from stakeholders in the sector. She explained that more than 60 respondents participated in the 2020 consultation, while in 2021, some 70 stakeholders completed an engagement survey. “We have also worked closely with the government, who spoke in the white paper about the importance of regular and reliable statistics to inform policymaking,” outlined Bryce.</p>
<p>The progress so far resulted in the publication of experimental statistics that were based on responses from approximately 4,000 participants. Data was collected between April and May this year. “The purpose of publishing them is so users can become familiar with and understand the impact of new methods and approaches on the findings before they become official statistics,” said the head of statistics at the Gambling Commission.</p>
<p>The gambling regulator also joined forces with the London School of Economics’ Professor of Quantitative Social Science, Patrick Sturgis, who will review the Gambling Survey’s methodology. The findings of his analysis will be published next year, head of the Commission’s implementation of the new statistics.</p>
