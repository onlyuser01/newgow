<p>G Games, an innovative iGaming company seeking to create slots with video game elements, has made a foray into Spain thanks to an agreement with the gambling operator Luckia. As per the deal, the supplier will power its new partner with its full suite of games.</p>
<p>Under the agreement, Luckia will secure access to G Games’ roster of disruptive titles, including its latest slot El Diablo. As a result, Spanish players will be able to play some of the best titles the provider has to offer and see what makes its games so special.</p>

All of the games available through the OpenGaming platform are notably supported with a full set of safer gaming solutions that customers can use to moderate their playtime.</p>

<p>Helen Walton, G Games’ founder and chief commercial officer commented on her company’s entry into Spain. She called this a “very exciting launch” and noted that G Games has deep roots in Spain. Seeing its games go live with Luckia, which is a big and respected local site is a big milestone for the supplier, Walton concluded.</p>
<p>Ibai Goikoetxea Peña, Luckia’s casino manager, also shared his thoughts on the agreement. He praised G Games’ slot games for being so fun and light-hearted while remaining innovative and exciting. The manager noted that the love the studio put into the making of these games really shows. He praised G Games for being so keen on trying out new things with its titles.</p>
