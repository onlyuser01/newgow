    <h1>Casinos Near Dallas Tx Southpoint Bingo And Casino Casinos In Deadwood Casinos In Albuquerque Nm Sta</h1>

<p>Hi, the other day I was referred over to check out Mbitcasino. I made a hundred dollar deposit and started playing. I ended up winning over $8,000 on the Roaring Lion slot. I know I'm bad about losing everything I won, I decided to request a withdrawal for $2,000.</p>
<p>Fast forward an hour, and I receive a message saying that the casino has a real quick security check to run that is standard.y withdrawal will be cancelled and returned to my account. Why my withdrawal couldn't just process after the security check, I'll never know.</p>
<p>I've played at Bitstarz for years and know KYC process can speed this type of thing up. So despite the representative telling me that no other information was needed at the moment, I proactively sent over all my KYC documents (front/back, Rogers invoice)</p>
<p>I waited the entire day and tried again to process a withdrawal for a smaller amount thinking that surely the quick security check was complete, especially considering they now have my documentation. However, this withdrawal was quickly just put back to my account.</p>
<p>Since this started, I've started taking screen recordings as I play, because it certainly felt a lot like a stall tactic where the customer is going to end up giving back winnings. And sure enough, I'm down to $5500 after I lost over $5000 in an hour across the absolute worst run I've ever seen in my life of gambling. Sure it could be terrible luck, but it all seems a bit suspect.</p>
<p>Why is the response to a security check to cancel a withdrawal and put the funds back in my account. Why is it a simple, standard security check is holding up my account still despite having my paperwork? I've tried contacting them multiple times and either get no response or I'm told to contact the payments/security team for more information.</p>
<p>I enjoy the site, but not if they are going to create hurdles for withdrawals in the rare event a player wins.</p>
