<p>iSoftBet games are now available on LeoVegas.it</p>
<p>LeoVegas to benefit from iSoftBet services.</p>
<p>Further expansion plans expected in the near future.</p>
<p>Renowned online gambling operator LeoVegas has recently expanded its Italian operation through a lucrative partnership deal with online casino solutions supplier iSoftBet. With the new partnership deal, iSoftBet is set to secure even greater exposure for its wide range of online gambling products while LeoVegas will be able to offer its customers a wider range of gaming titles.</p>
<p>As such, regardless of whether they are playing online or on mobile, the LeoVegas.it customers will now have access to a wide variety of popular casino games including Vegas High Roller, Merlin’s Magic Mirror, and The Golden City. There is really so much that is in store for the customers – a decent number of propriety video slots, table games, and even branded titles.</p>
<p>In addition to being able to offer the gaming solution provider’s amazing selection of online casino games, LeoVegas will also benefit from using a host of other services. These will include a number of marketing and real-time gamification tools such as the incredibly popular In-Game toolkit.</p>
<p>The series of gamification tools that area availed to iSoftBet partners are primarily designed to enhance the player experience. This is achieved through such things as tournaments, leaderboards that are based on achievements, and points or rewards. The points and rewards schemes extend well beyond iSoftBet games and can also be enjoyed on game titles provided by the software provider’s partners.</p>
<p>One other notable tool that LeoVegas is likely to utilize is iSoftBet’s Game Aggregation Platform. This platform gives online casinos super-fast, one-time integration to content from over 30 of the industry’s top suppliers of online and mobile gaming content.</p>
<p>LeoVegas’ Expansion Bid</p>
<p>The partnership deal between LeoVegas and iSoftBet is part of the former’s massive expansion bid that will hopefully see it grab a significant share of the European gambling market. Both companies are looking forward to a long and fruitful partnership.</p>
<p>“iSoftBet have a reputation for developing highly exciting and immersive content, and we are very eager to offer its games to our customers,” Paola Maia, the operations manager at LeoVegas.it, commented.</p>
<p>Italy aside, LeoVegas has been aggressively pursuing other newly regulated markets over the past few months and its efforts are slowly beginning to pay off. For instance, earlier this year, the online gambling operator was among the first to debut in the newly reorganized Swedish gaming market. Similarly, it was granted a Spanish license in June after which it launched its online casino.</p>
<p>iSoftBet has also not been left behind. It has been able to tap into a number of regulated gaming markets where it has partnered with some of the world’s leading online gambling operators.</p>
