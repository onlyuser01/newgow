<p>The Australian Communications and Media Authority or ACMA continues to clamp down on unregulated gambling in the country. It’s one of the most ambitious global moves to suspend illegal operations and while nobody thought it would work, ACMA has hit some of the biggest casino and affiliate websites. A further nine such websites have been now blacklisted in the latest round of bans by the media authority.</p>
<p>Blocking of Unregulated Gambling Websites Continue</p>
<p>Using the Interactive Gambling Act 2001 for the legal basis of enacting this change, ACMA has targeted nine high-traffic websites that have been aggressively advertising or targeting Australian players without a license to do so. Presently, online gambling of any sort, other than sports betting, is prohibited in Australia.</p>
<p>Regardless, several brands have tried to make their products available to players within the country. The list of newly-suspended websites includes some prominent names in offshore betting, to name:</p>
<p>Stay Casino, Bambet, Dazard Casino, Level Up Casino, Rocketplay Casino, Wild Tornado Casino, Cobra Casino, Cobra Bet, Casinority and Pokies Lab. ACMA’s list of newly blocked websites</p>
<p>So far, ACMA has been able to successfully cut access to no fewer than 481 illegal gambling websites. The measure was originally introduced back in November 2019 and was originally met with some skepticism. Over time, though, ACMA proved that it has the resources, patience, and expertise to muster a strong response against rogue gambling operators.</p>
<p>ACMA similarly reported that at least 160 websites have pulled out of the market voluntarily, realizing that sooner or later, ACMA will target their business as well. The regulator said that consumers should be on the lookout and not blindly participate in gambling operators, even when they seem legitimate.</p>
<p>Australians need to stick to only regulated and licensed gambling operators that are based in Australia or else face the risk of losing their money or even sensitive personal information.</p>
