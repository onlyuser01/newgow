<p>With three Day 1s to go, partypoker is on track to hosting the biggest-ever online poker tournament.</p>
<p>Only 600 More Players Needed for PartyPoker to Smash Last Year’s Record-Breaking Guarantee</p>
<p>Currently, partypoker is in the midst of hosting its 2019 $20 million partypoker MILLIONS Online, offering players the chance to become millionaires. The event could be the biggest online poker tournament in history, after attracting record numbers on its first two Day 1s.</p>
<p>On Day 1A, 709 players entered the event, which generated a prize pool of $7 million – over 35% of the event’s $20 million guarantee. While the numbers were impressive, there were still 80 fewer players than in the previous year’s Day 1A.</p>
<p>This led members of the online poker community to doubt that the 2019 event would surpass the 2018 prize pool which reached over $21.8 million. There were even suspicious that an overlay would occur.</p>
<p>However, Day 1B changed everything. By the end of the day, a further 699 players entered – almost triple the number of runners that entered on Day 1B last year. At this point in the 2018 partypoker MILLIONS Online, the prize pool was just over $10.2 million. This year, over $14 million has been generated, and there are still three Day 1s left to go.</p>
<p>All that’s needed now is for another 600 players to enter the partypoker MILLIONS Online. That’s just 200 runners per day, which is an entirely reasonable expectation. Last year, the final three Day 1s saw over 1100 entries, so the 2019 partypoker Millions Online is certainly on track to surpass its $20 million guarantee.</p>
<p>If everything continues going at the current rate, partypoker has the potential to smash the record for the biggest online poker event in history – a record that the brand broke last year. The online poker site continues to strive to raise the bar, and this is the perfect example of how hard partypoker works to satisfy its players.</p>
<p>As a reference, these are the biggest online poker events so far:</p>
<p>2018 partypoker MILLIONS Online: $21.835 million</p>
<p>2011 PokerStars Sunday Million Anniversary Edition: $12.432 million</p>
<p>2019 PokerStars Sunday Million Anniversary Edition: $12.268 million</p>
<p>2010 WCOOP Main Event: $12.215 million</p>
<p>2011 PokerStars Sunday Million Anniversary Edition: $11.825 million</p>
<p>We’re certainly looking forward to seeing how this all plays out, but there’s no doubt that partypoker will be paying out much more than $20 million in its upcoming online poker tournament.</p>
