    <h1>Island Resort And Casino Harris Michigan Pulz Casino Santa Barbara Casino Circus Circus Hotel Casino</h1>

<p>Swedish betting company Cherry Spelglädje has chosen Hans Martin Nakkim as the operator’s new chief executive officer. Nakkim will be replacing the company’s former CEO Aron Egfors.</p>
<p>Nakkim Becomes Cherry Spelglädje’s CEO</p>
<p>Nakkim will become a CEO with the intention of driving the company even further. Cherry Spelglädje teased that the new change in leadership coincides with the operator’s ambitious plans to reinforce its positions on the market and diversify its betting offerings.</p>
<p>Nakkim is honored by the trust put onto him and is grateful to be able to work for Cherry Spelglädje and its team. “I look forward to exploring new business opportunities and investments in the gaming sector for Cherry Spelglädje,” he said.</p>
<p>Cherry Spelglädje used to be a subsidiary of Cherry Group. However, when the latter was acquired by a Bridgepoint-led consortium, Cherry’s iGaming division was rebranded to ComeOn and Cherry Group to EE Intressenter. Cherry Spelglädje is currently a part of EE Intressenter.</p>
<p>Egfors Is Happy With the State of Affairs</p>
<p>Egfors is happy to have worked as a CEO. He described the six years in the position as ones filled with “both fun and challenges.” Egfors made many new friends among his colleagues and has cherished memories from all the meetings and trips with the other members of the company. The former CEO is grateful and will happily continue being a part of the company and push its development forward.</p>
<p>Egfors is absolutely positive that Cherry Spelglädje’s development is far from over. He is keen on helping the company maintain its leadership position in the Swedish casino industry.</p>
<p>Egfors will remain as a part of Cherry Spelglädje but will adopt a new role. The announcement didn’t reveal much on that, other than implying he will work within the company’s business operations. In his words, he is more than happy with it as it will allow him to help the company’s development in a more direct manner. Egfors mentioned that his new role will allow him to directly visit the company’s venues and meet more of his colleagues.</p>
<p>IGaming in Sweden is currently undergoing a sharp rise. The second quarter of 2021 saw double-digit growth in the North European country’s online betting business. The popularity of online gambling prevails over retail gambling and many retail sites are closing and transferring their business online.</p>
<p>Because of this tendency, the Swedish regulators have started taking action to better regulate online operations. Recently, the country started considering measures against offshore operators who make their offerings available to Swedish citizens without having a license.</p>
