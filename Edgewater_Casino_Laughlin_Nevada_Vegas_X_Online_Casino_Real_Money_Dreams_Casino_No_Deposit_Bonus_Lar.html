    <h1>Edgewater Casino Laughlin Nevada Vegas X Online Casino Real Money Dreams Casino No Deposit Bonus Lar</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>first a kind reminder: please use the "reply" button, otherwise the person you wrote to will not be notified. Thank you ðŸ™‚</p>
<p>Regarding the bonus, I agree with you, this is not a convincing strategy for how to support players and make them feel wanted. And that's why I suggested the complaint. You know, we can't simply lower the rating solely because of your posts, we need to investigate first, this is when the complaints come in.</p>
<p>I guess that you should read more about the resolution center and then decide whether you'd like to place the complaint. These are the consequences:</p>
<p>"If the complaint is justified and we are unable to resolve it , it is closed and categorized as being 'unresolved'. This happens when the casino either does not respond to us or refuses to do what we consider to be fair in that specific situation . You will not get your desired outcome but the complaint will be saved in our system, the casino will be punished with a lower rating from us and our review of the casino will warn other players of what happened. What's more, if the casino wants to improve its rating in the future, it will be forced to address the complaint , so there is a chance that your complaint will be resolved at a later date."</p>
<p>It's up to you. ðŸ¤”</p>
