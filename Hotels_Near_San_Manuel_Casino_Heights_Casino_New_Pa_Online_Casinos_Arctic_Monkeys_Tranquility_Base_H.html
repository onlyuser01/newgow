    <h1>Hotels Near San Manuel Casino Heights Casino New Pa Online Casinos Arctic Monkeys Tranquility Base H</h1>

<p>Good morning, I am very upset with Mystake casino.</p>
<p>I have put that amount, because I really don't know how much I have to claim.</p>
<p>On April 20, I started betting on this website, guided by the good reviews on the internet, my fault.</p>
<p>The minigames on this page are a real scam, as an example, the chicken game with only one chance of failing in 25 you always failed the first time, just like the portal with a probability of failing 1 in 20 and it's the same, always you lose. I claim from mystake only the money wagered on the minigames, for not complying with fair gaming. I'm not saying always win, but I really gave away the money.</p>
<p>Now I am in the place where I cannot prove it because it does not record it, and mystake has decided to delete my transaction history, only the deposited and withdrawn appear. I am attaching a photograph that the transaction history has disappeared. This seems like a total hoax to me.</p>
<p>It also happened to me that the payment page gave me an error, when paying with a credit card it was not reflected until some time passed that this money had been collected, even putting an error in my bank application and an error on the page and the money does not appear on the mystake page but deducting it from my bank account.</p>
<p>How can I know now how much money I have really deposited and how much they have charged without authorization for making an error? I have no way to do it, because when you bet on other games, the winnings took time to add up, thinking that what I won was adding money directly from my bank account due to their mistake!</p>
