    <h1>Free Casino Online Games Grand Casino Shawnee Boombet Casino Casino Spokane Wa Ameristar Casino Kans</h1>

<p>I've had a fully verified account for 7 months over 2k in deposits last week I get a balance to withdraw 500 euro.</p>
<p>24 hrs later withdrawal canceled address needed verifyed "even tho was verified until I carried out my first withdrawal" recent bank statement was sent then tried to withdraw again and again cancelled due to them not accepting bank statements. this happened 3 times till I informed them that it's in their T@Cs that bank statements within 3 months are suitable.</p>
<p>My address was accepted, yet again tried to withdraw and cancelled again this time they wanted another bank statement showing bic and swift codes.</p>
<p>I tried to inform them that my bank don't show these on the statements and if they look at swift code I sent them both my sort code and account number on my bank statement match the codes I sent.</p>
<p>My bank has informed me they won't send me copy's of these codes as they are on my app "which I have already sent to betzino" these requests are unjustified and unreasonable especially after 2 k in deposits and zero withdrawals.</p>
<p>The disputed amount is now â‚¬1000 I done my homework on this casino and thought they were safe to play at but it's really starting to look like I was wrong..</p>
