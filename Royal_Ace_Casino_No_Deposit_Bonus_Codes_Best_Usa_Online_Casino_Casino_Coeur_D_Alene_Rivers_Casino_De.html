    <h1>Royal Ace Casino No Deposit Bonus Codes Best Usa Online Casino Casino Coeur D Alene Rivers Casino De</h1>

<p>Sorry. I forgot to write earlier. Yes they withdraw money very quickly!!! Probably thanks to the intervention of Casino Guru !!! Thank you very much!!! If it wasn't thanks to the intervention of Casino Guru, it was a miracle :)</p>
<p>Can I ask one more question? I have big problem with Lilibet (but it's not in Casino but in Sportsbook and I see in Casino Guru there are issues only from Casino - it is possible to help me by way of exception, please???)</p>
<p>In short. My login - Y<strong>*</strong></p>
<p>I deposited 150E (in March 2021!!!) and get sportsbook bonus 225E. After rollover I had 360-370 Euros. They stole from my account (210-220 Euros due to "breaking bonus rules" - of course I didn't break any bonus rules, I was very careful about that!)</p>
<p>They didn't show any evidence since almost 24 months/2 years!!!. They withdraw deposit several days ago (after almost 23 months!!! in spite of I send verification documents many times in previous months). So they detained my deposit for 23 months (due to inflation rate that money has much less value now)</p>
<p>I wrote about that to many sites - for example</p>
<p>AskGamblers (they rejected few times my complaints without any trying for help!!! despite they have affiliate Lilibet links)</p>
<p>CasinoMeister (they tried to help but Lilibet replied to them, they won't talk with them about that because they didn't cooperate at any time).</p>
<p>So Casino Guru is "last resort" for me. I can even transfer some part of that 210-220 Euros to CasinoGuru for help!!! (but after almost 2 years Lilibet should pay much more - they held/turnover my money).</p>
<p>Once again, thank you very much and I will be delighted if you can help me a second time!!!!</p>
