<p>SkillOnNet has extended the selection of available payment methods with the addition of Apple Pay as one of the methods for deposits and withdrawals. As a result, Apple Pay will be a viable payment option for SkillOnNet’s numerous partners in markets, such as Germany, Canada, Portugal, Sweden, Denmark, Spain, and the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>Safe, Flexible and Private Payment Option</p>
<p>SkillOnNet’s partners include a variety of established casino websites with sizable player bases in regulated markets. Commenting on the arrival of the new payment option, SkillOnNet said that Apple Pay offered a safe and flexible payment option that is preferred with customers worldwide:</p>
<p>“This is partly because players can make payments to an online casino without having to share their bank account details. Payments are quickly validated either with a passcode, Touch ID, Face ID or by double-tapping the side of their Apple Watch.” SkillOnNet</p>
<p>With this addition, SkillOnNet has extended its variety of payment options that include other player-favorite options such as MasterCard, Visa, Neteller, PayPal, Skrill, and other options. SkillOnNet also focuses on introducing localized payment methods to specific markets with the addition of toditoCash, Euteller, and ecoPayz, as they serve their specific markets.</p>
<p>SkillOnNet’s Michael Golembo praised Apple Pay’s high levels of security and privacy. “This is certainly the case for online casino players, who like the speed at which it allows them to make deposits and withdrawals securely,” Golebo added.</p>
<p>More Fulfilling Experience to Partner Player Bases</p>
<p>He added that SkillOnNet remains committed to building the most fulfilling gaming experience that includes strong payment options and solutions. The addition of Appel Pay is a way to reaffirm SkillOnNet’s commitment to the company’s partner casino brands and help them stand out as world-class gaming sites, Golembo concluded.</p>
<p>SkillOnNet has been building up its presence globally, and not just in Europe. The company made another foray into the Latin American market through a partnership with Ortiz Gaming in January. The company similarly entered a partnership with PlayUzu for Mexico at the beginning of the year.</p>
<p>SkillOnNet did face some regulatory headwinds in Sweden after the national regulator targeted the company for violations of the country’s bonus ban. The company remains a robust pillar in iGaming in Europe and Latin America and the addition of Apple Pay continues to introduce new opportunities for partner casinos and players.</p>
