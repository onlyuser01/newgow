    <h1>Casino Chandler Az Pokerstar Casino Okc Casinos Barona Valley Ranch Resort Casino Cherokee Casino Ho</h1>

<p>I played evolution online BJ 2 week ago via my bet site Unibet</p>
<p>There was couple time my bet and some of other table bet get rejected but the money was reverse so it's alright. But after about 4mins - one hour later the technical issue back again rejected my bet but not one table I played with. So maybe it's my internet or something. So I logged off and logged back in but I was really shock I found my balance missing Â£320 as I look at my bet history the bet I was placed and got rejected and never get dealt by the dealer but they took the money and hasn't returned till now. So that night/early morning I reported to the live support of the evolution then they have me Reference code and told me to tell my provider or UNIBET. so I reported the story and almost everyday I asked them via live chat and gave them some evidence like my bet history and and the ID of the bet. They always told me still under investigation. IT HAS BEEN 2 WEEKS. Don't use UNIBET please people.</p>
<p>I'm still waiting for the investigation finish.</p>
<p>Costumer service is horrible.</p>
<p>No one seem able to help you.</p>
